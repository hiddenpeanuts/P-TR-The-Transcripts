 FOREVER! DOG!  The place where Oakland Raiders merch is sold  A sublime hot topic and bill of bong  A place where you can purchase a candy thong  So let's go take a walk  Let's all go to City Walk  Tonight  Podcast The Ride presents  The City Walk Saga  A 19 part, extremely necessary series  Exploring the stores, restaurants, and wonderful magic that make up  Universal City Walk Hollywood  Welcome to Podcast The Ride, The City Walk Saga, Sector 2  We're here, we're very early in the run of this  Great endeavor  And I want to say, because I don't think we said it in the first one, our theme song  For this saga, music and lyrics by our very own music maestro  Mike Carlson, who is here today  Vocalz, sung by the great Zach Reno  Our dear friend from the Off Book Podcast  And of course, Scott Gairdner  Am I looking sharp today?  You are looking sharp, and you're  The finder, Scott, you always impress me with  Oh, now we're just being nice to each other, that's nice  You find these amazing oddities of rides and theme parks and you're very good at searching archives  The research is very good  That has been a nice thing about this podcast, I have always had this weird  Wanting to dig and find some little off  Find one thing that's not on the Wikipedia of the rides  I think we owe the audience that  There's some fun odd stuff in this sector and throughout this whole  Series, I'm looking forward to it, and in case people didn't realize, this is the proof  That we really are, we've never done two days in a row of episodes  And we've certainly never done 19 days in a row, here we are  It's really happening, and the other thing that's really happening is that we are joined once again by  The great spirit who overlooks City Walk and guides  Us into these sectors, it's the Sector Keeper  Hello Sector Keeper, very good  Good to see you, your strength brings me strength  Wonderful, we have a long way to go, we have to rebuild you  All the way up to being alive again  Yes, being alive and then allowing me to die and go to heaven  I guess that is what we're doing  And I thank you, you're on this journey  This journey is exciting, yes?  You already look a little better since the first one  I can feel the blood coming back to my face  I can feel that as you  Go into more sectors, I will grow more into my soul  And also on top of that, color is coming back  To your face, and you're also becoming less translucent like a Back to the Future  Photo, and we can see you much more clearly  Now, I think your opacity levels have raised at least 3%  Yes, check out my shirt  Oh, that was one of your favorites back in 1993  When you left this mortal coil  Yeah, don't read  Well, we don't want to get into it  Billy West, on the other hand, still a prolific great  Voiceover actor, and he ended up taking over  For Ren, and in some ways was even better  Yeah, absolutely, very nice  So there's still good men out there, and I hope we're among them  Oh, then we can help you  We're in Sector 2 today, great Sector Keeper  Boys, gather round, gather round, in order to attain the Sector 2 Stone  Please discuss Dodgers Clubhouse Store  The Crepe Cafe, Sock Market  Future Italian Restaurant, and  The now retired Upstart Crow  Okay, can do, we are ready, willing, and able, yes?  Sephora also part of this  He was testing us to make sure  Well, I can understand why you wouldn't want to  Bring it up, but sorry, we have to do the accounting  In case you're joining us for Episode 2, Sector Keeper Perish in the City Walk  Fountain, which we'll cover in a few sectors, and that one might be a dark one for you  We'll try to keep things light, and we can keep things light right now by talking about  The Dodgers Clubhouse Store  Go Dodgers! They're one of the great LA teams represented at  City Walk, well the only great LA team as the Raiders Store  Has not been an LA team for some time  But the Dodgers certainly are the pride of LA  And it's a great store.
 I can recognize, look, I'm a guy who likes  Like collecting crap, you can see it in the apartment, I have a lot of toys  There are graphic novels, which by the way  Right as I was talking, I got a little distracted, because I was looking at your Leonardo  Over there, does he have a penis? No, no, no, that's his tail  His tail, let me see if I can actually move it, so you're right, it does look like it's just got  A little dangly penis happening here  It's kind of just stuck there  We're going to have to pose it very much like his penis  Yeah, give it a tug until it's clearly not a penis  There was a limited run  Dynamic forces, limited run of ones where you did see  Leonardo's hog, but no, that's definitely supposed to be a tail  It's supposed to be a tail, and it's probably anatomically correct as far as a turtle is concerned  If a turtle was standing upright, his tail would just be dangling there right between his legs  Why did they need to represent this? Because that's not on a suit or anything  This is a mondo turtle, mondo is a company that makes posters and  Different toys, and there's two different heads, one is the red bandanna  For Leonardo, because they all had red in the original Mirage comic, they did not have  The color bandannas, so I believe this is more of a gritty  Ninja turtle, a more original design, and I think the original designs  Had the little tails, had the penises, had the little penises dangling  Not Fort Shildren  It probably says that on the box, adult collectors  You keep it out and open, you display penis  Well I think it's cool, because it's a nice design for the toy  In future, all adult men have Ninja Turtles with penises  Okay, let's get back to the dodger story  Kind of a mic specific  I have just some collectibles, I call them collectibles is what happens  They're not toys necessarily, that's your euphemism for your sex toys  Adults buy toys  It's a lot to explain, in a future sector there's a store  That sells collectibles like this, things from another world  So we can probably talk more about adult collectibles then  This is how much we're avoiding  Talking about sports stuff, I was just trying to talk about turtle dicks  I steered it right into stuff I liked when I was six  This is you getting in the head of a sports freak  That's what I was trying to do  Right, I was imagining, say this was a Ninja Turtles store  And it was at City Walk, if they had the amount  And different types of merchandise and clothing, I would be in heaven  If it was just multiple different Michelangelo toys and t-shirts with Casey Jones  And every version of Casey Jones, it was movie Casey, an early cartoon Casey  And Mirage Comic Casey, but also Archie Comics Casey  Which is a different set of turtle comics that were running at the same time  I would have been, oh my gosh, it would have been heaven for me  So I'm saying it's a good store because I imagined my interest being the Ninja Turtles thing that I liked  When I was a little boy  This metaphor would apply to anything though, Sephora, imagine if Sephora instead of makeup  You have Ninja Turtles things and you've got every type of  Well now you're making all the stores sound really great to me, so you're right about that  I'm just saying the amount and the quantity of things even more so than even  Like if we're talking about Billabong  Which I felt didn't have as much merchandise and didn't have as many options  For whatever, their board shorts and their skateboard decks or whatever  I'm talking about Dodger's, the place was packed, it's a crowded store  I don't have any merchandise, that's sort of especially what I'm saying and that's why I'm trying to pay it a compliment  Do I care about any of it? No, I don't give a shit, it's the Dodgers, it's baseball  I like going to the game, I like all that stuff, but if we're talking  If it was a Ninja Turtles store  Here's a fun fact about the Dodgers, the name comes from, the Dodgers were originally from Brooklyn  Yes, yeah, another fun fact in and of itself  Yeah, and once when I was in New York I took one of those double decker bus tours  And the real New York guy giving the bus tour was very  Adamant about, the Dodgers should have never left Brooklyn  Even the name is Brooklyn, because there used to be these very cumbersome  Trolleys that would come down the avenues in Brooklyn and that's how people  Would get around in the early 20th century  And they would spark, they were constantly sparking from the top  But then they also didn't have great braking systems, so people would dodge out  Of the way when the trolleys were like coming down  That's a weird, so they named the baseball team after like, getting out of the way  Of public transit, that's weird, that's very weird  And those were the days man, leaping away from fires  And giant gnarling mechanisms that might smash into me  You used to name baseball teams after avoiding accidents  Yeah, can't believe they kept that name when they moved to Chavez Ravine  Texas duckers, you would have to duck out of the way of gunfire  Oh the gunfire, they're always shooting those guns down in Texas  The duckers should have stayed in Texas, okay, the Baltimore  Maymes, I guess they're Maymes because they aren't the  Maymers, if you're getting the maimers, the collateral damages  The collateral damages, damages, damages  Oh yeah, I guess that works too, collateral damages, maybe, correct, yes  I'm sure there are in all sports teams related to the hurricane  Avoiders, the punch blockers  Local maladies should always be the source of team names  That is interesting, that is fun, I agree  Can you imagine being a sports fan listening to this, we can't name one player  People punching their radio or their phone  Stop it, feeding up their own podcast  You wanna hear about Pweeg, you fucking nerd  You seal Pweeg  So yeah, I gotta say, it's a great store, I thought it was cool  It's a lot, if you're a Dodgers fan, you'll find something there  It's packed, it's like everything they have at Dodgers Stadium, all in one tiny  city walk location, you can make a custom jersey which I think is cool  You used to be able to get Dodgers dogs up there, oh is that true, in that store  There was like a hot dog stand next to it, or outside of it, but it's gone  They did used to have Dodger dogs within the park, and I would get those  on my lunch breaks as a tour guide, and then I remembered  that hot dogs are not good to have many  times a week, no yeah, nitrates, too many nitrates  I love hot dogs, you and me both sector keepers  You are a child, we miss the days when we could eat  this way, although for Jason those days persist  How many hot dogs a week are you eating, 5, 6?  Well here's the thing with hot dogs, when you're a single man and you buy a pack of hot dogs  You're gonna want to freeze some, because you're gonna get sick of them quick  Cause like, you know, if I buy hot dogs, I'm gonna be eating hot dogs  for a few meals that week, you still buy hot dogs in the store?  How often other than a cookout are you buying hot dogs?  Once every 6 weeks or so?  You buy hot dogs once at home? Every sector keeper, you look shocked  Like what? You eat hot dogs at home?  That's interesting, cause I haven't bought hot dogs for a while, maybe I did it once  like 7 or 8 years ago, I'm not anti-hot dog  If I go to a baseball game I have a hot dog, but I haven't bought hot dogs other than for a cookout  in years.
 Well sometimes they'll switch it up and do like a kielbasa  Or like, if that week, if it's like, oh I'll make  pasta, you know, pasta with sauce and sausage  You could buy a sausage.
 Cause like a hot dog really is just bologna  It's the exact same thing as bologna really, it's just like this weird  processed meat.
 You get the good ones, you get like the kosher, you know, the Nathan's  Well of course there's quality to bologna as well, I'm just saying if you get an Oscar Meyer hot dog or Oscar Meyer  bologna, it's basically the same thing.
 You've really turned me off with that, I've never been a bologna  guy.
 Oh so now I've put you off of hot dogs even more  See we weren't a bologna household, but we were a hot dog household, we always had hot dogs  I'll say we were a bologna household and a liver sausage household, which is insane  Oscar Meyer liver sausage in that like tube, sector keeper  you know what I'm talking about? Did you have that when you were alive? Yes, my father would  eat liver sausage sandwiches and you spread it  Yes it's a spread.
 So this is different than liverwurst, which is similar  We would have liverwurst, scrapple, east coast we would have  I've heard of scrapple.
 I've never had that.
 This is all like, I don't know why we were eating like depression  era food in the 1980s and 1990s, but we were.
 And in the 2010s  Well for Jason, yes, he's still eating scrapple  I, look, I still, my baby boomer parents, you know, I still like  go to the grocery store, it's like alright, need bread milk eggs, you know  I'll often be like, mom why were we eating liver  sausage? Like it's crazy, it's like what even was it?  My family eats very traditionally and I'll get text messages  from my younger sister who's, I think  prone to misspellings and the autocorrects don't always work out and she was complaining  about the poor quality of the meal they had, ham over rice  but also, which is a horrible.
 Ham over rice? Over.
 I was  like, why was it dressed up with over? Did my mom tonight  have ham over rice? And you would not have that as a child growing up.
 No, that was not a common  that's apparently new in the Gairdner household, but the other thing was  she was complaining about the smell of the food that was being prepared all day  in the cock pot.
 This was a text message  I see, I see.
 That's good, that's funny.
 So funny, seeing cock pot  in print.
 Leonardo cooks in a cock pot.
 He's a walking  cock pot.
 See, a nice ham dinner, I would, I feel like we  defaulted to all gratin potatoes.
 Yeah, that makes sense  That's a fancy potato.
 Rice is not a thing anyone does.
 Were you a ham family?  We were not.
 Oh yeah, ham, pork loins.
 Pork loins, really?  Yeah, pork chops, I feel like we stopped, we used to be  a lot of pork chops, but I think as we got older, we were all like, these are  dry and kind of like, and then we switched to pork loins, which tend to be a lot  juicier and flavorful.
 Interesting.
 If you're just joining us, this is Podcast  the Ride, the podcast about theme parks and rides  and amusement parks.
 And processed meats.
 And processed meats.
  We ate as children.
 And facts about, oh no.
 Oh, sector keeper, we have to keep moving.
  Boys, boys, please continue with  the crepe cafe.
 Well, this is, I mean, this is all me, cause I  This ties right back into food.
 Yeah, this ties right back into food.
 So I went to the crepe  cafe.
 I had a caramel crepe  and I thought it was good.
 I really like crepes.
  I don't get them often.
 I feel like it's not a thing you get  like on the go or out and about in America a lot.
 It's not like  an everyday, it's not like a hot dog.
 Yeah, it's not like my beloved hot  dogs, but I do like crepes.
 I mean, this one was essentially like, you know,  caramel syrup or spread in the kind of thin  crepey pancake.
 My big complaint about this  crepe cafe though is they served it to you on a styrofoam plate.
 If you had  a crepe before, you kind of got to saw through it like a crepe.
 You got  to saw through it a bit, but like when you're doing that, when you're putting that  extra oomph into like cutting it, if you hit the plate, it's  styrofoam, like that, you don't want bits of styrofoam  like flying everywhere.
 When you were trying to cut the crepe, did you ever like meet the  metal of the table with the plastic knife?  Well, no, because I had the plate was on a tray  and I never cut through the plate, but I like, you know,  ding the styrofoam a bit.
 I scored it.
  So I would say like crepe cafe, switch to paper plates.
 Come on, what are you  doing? Also styrofoam in this day and age, like we know it's bad.
 But paper plates look so,  so cheap.
 Don't you think the presentation would suffer if you weren't?  No, you can get nice higher quality paper plates.
  Stock paper plate.
 I think styrofoam looks cheaper.
 I can help.
  Oh, yes.
 Yes, I'll put in a word.
 With the distributors?  Yes, yes, yes.
 I think that's smart.
 It seems like it's a  maybe a profit margins situation.
 It's, I'm sure  styrofoam is cheaper than like heavy duty paper.
 Do you think the crepe  cafe is having financial troubles and all crepe  restaurant outside of the.
.
.
 It's been there a while though.
 This is hanging on.
  It's survived a few generations of city walk.
 Was there a crepe craze?  At some point? I feel like there's been attempts at it  but like.
.
.
 It's been in fits and starts with the crepe craze.
 It never hit like frozen yogurt did.
  It never hit like donuts did.
 Which is interesting that you bring that up because  the other thing about the crepe cafe is they have a whole side of the menu  that is like European style, like Belgian fries with  a variety of dipping sauces.
 Which is  interesting because it's like there are savory crepes.
  Question mark, not me.
 I don't, it seems like they're like  the crepes aren't cutting it.
 We need something else.
 And fries are  I mean that's a profit.
 Do we know is that, is there anywhere in the world where  a crepe in a Belgian fry is a meal? Maybe in Europe  I guess.
 Perhaps in Europe.
 But like Jason's Kitchen  Oh, I'm not, these are labor intensive foods.
  He doesn't have a fryer.
 I don't have a fryer.
 An oven fryer, I don't know about oven fries.
  Like that's a dicey proposition.
 You don't buy oven fries ever? Not usually, no.
  A bag of oven fries? Not, yeah I don't think.
 You're making a face like I'm making you sick.
  No, I mean I like to like slice up a sweet potato  and dress it with olive oil and bake that a little.
 That's real good.
 So it's like  it's kind of like a fry.
 It's kind of, but like I find oven fries like those  orida oven fries in a bag.
 I hear what you're saying.
 Very dry.
 You just gave  a clue if any young eligible podcast the ride  fans out there want to seduce old Jason Sheridan.
 I made you  your favorite sweet potato drizzled in olive oil.
  With hot dogs.
 With hot dogs as a side.
 And a scrapple  in a glass.
 A scrapple is like a loaf, it's kind of a loaf  a meat, meat-ish loaf.
 What a first word  to describe to make something attractive.
 This is a breakfast meat.
 So you cut slices  and you grill it up so the inside is soft and the outside is crispy.
 If you go to  a diner outside of Philadelphia or in South Jersey and you look at the breakfast section  your meat choices are many and various.
 You're talking  bacon, sausage, hot Italian sausage, sweet Italian sausage  scrapple, pork roll.
 Keep going.
 Leonardo  dick.
 Leonardo dick.
 You're a ghost  too? No, I'm very much alive.
 I'm  a 32 going on 33 year old band.
 You talk like from the 1930s.
  I don't, you know, you just, you watch enough  like Nick at Night and syndicated like Colgate  variety hour shows that should have burned up in fires  but were somehow preserved.
 I like that by the end of this we'll realize that Jason is  truly a child ghost from the 1930s and is beginning like hard  tack.
 Who was diving out of the way of a  cable car careening down the hill and maybe the spark  created kind of a lightning bolt back to the future thing.
 And he wanted to be a  Pittsburgh diver, a baseball player when he was older.
 Pittsburgh diver.
  Anyway, I liked crepe cafe fine.
  I think that $8.
50 caramel crepe was okay.
 I  thought my popcornopolis experience was a lot more fun so  I didn't try any of the savory crepes.
 You like popcornopolis sector keeper? So many  flavors.
 It's great.
 Very fun.
 It's a fun name.
 Fun.
 Yeah.
  Well, you know, there's right next door there's a lot of flavors  of socks at, well it's not right next door never mind.
 Fuck.
  I want to talk about the sock market.
 That's what I'm saying.
 Sure, yeah.
  The Los Angeles sock market, not to be confused with the  Las Vegas sock market or the San Francisco  sock market.
 So this is a, there's three of them all told and the name  changes depending on where you are.
 Obviously it's a great pun.
  Did you guys clock it as  a stock market? Like  something about removing the T, like the pun was not cleared in the end until I thought  about it for a while.
 I, like many people that  pass through City Walk for the first so many years of living in Los Angeles and going to City Walk  I didn't even register that it was there.
 But then when I was aware of the  name, the sock market, I think I did not think about it until  maybe we started doing this series, we talked about doing this saga  and then it was like, oh the sock market, oh  okay, oh stock, okay.
 Like it was truly not a  like I didn't, the first time I saw it I didn't like stand there looking at it and laughing and going oh my  god that's the greatest.
 The best jokes take years to hit you.
  The logo makes it kind of obvious but they really should have gone  harder with like a graph of arrows pointing up and there's a little of it  but it should be like.
 Like a picture of Ben Bernanke or something.
 There should be Ben Bernanke  there should be Alan Greenspan.
 Well on the  website of the sock market there is  some literature in the About Us about the head of the Federal Reserve  Board, I'm not sure why that's changed.
 Why there's a D at the end of that.
  Don't know, but the head of the Federal Reserve Board is Alan  Seem Span.
 So they did Sockify  I'm getting all these but I don't care for them.
 Like I don't  Yeah getting does not equal approval.
 Yeah it's that, that bugs me  when like you can tell when a company is putting a joke or something out  there but it's like god it's making my skin crawl how this is like  was approved but it's not landing.
 Uh huh.
 Well  I think the sock market itself is full of things that might hit that same  criteria.
 Oh for sure.
 There's a lot of great sock  comedy going on.
 Oh my gosh.
 I mean everybody feel free to  call stuff out.
 What I think this if you had to ballpark  it does this it's not a bit it's a retail spa that is  not any bigger than this this living room and I think there are I think there are  seven thousand types of socks.
 Yeah it's like more almost as  packed as the Dodger's store.
 And it's split between like novelty  and like porno socks.
 Like sexy  socks.
 Mike I can see on your computer.
 Well they call it X-rated is what they have.
  If you go on the website there's different categories and they have men's, women's and kids  and then there's shop by design and that says like you can shop by age, animal  argyle, comic, fashion, name socks, novelty patterns, sports and there's collections  flag, artist, photo, NFL player, sports team and then  X-rated.
 And of course you gotta go right to  X-rated and I'll just start with my favorite sector keeper.
  So we're gonna do some bad language here.
 So if I  get I have some allowance would you boys  go in and buy me some? Oh cause you can't go in and  buy it cause it's too it's X-rated so I wouldn't feel right.
  I feel like I could go to jail if I buy you some of these socks.
 I'll buy you some Homer Simpson socks or  like some Batman socks but not that.
 I'll say  this though sector keeper you're not aware is that now in this  modern age a lot of things are online so if you can get your hands on  a credit card.
 Online? Computer, computer like in the lab  at school.
 People have those in their homes now.
 Where you play Oregon Trail on?  Yes.
 So they're like much more advanced now and you can buy things on  the computer so I would say if you can find a credit card  you could buy socks and just pretend you're an adult.
  Oh well I'm dead so.
 That might be dicey.
  It might be hard.
 But maybe maybe.
 Can you pick pocket  like a person at city walk and get their credit card?  It says you have that ability? Yes well yes I could do  that.
 I have to continue my training much like Patrick Swayze in the  movie Ghost where.
 Oh right.
 So I'm still working  on this.
 Your ability to manipulate the real world.
 Yeah my abilities my abilities.
  You can appear on podcasts and hold microphones but reaching into somebody's  pocket is a little complicated.
 It might be a little complicated.
 So there's like a Vincent Schiavelli  type at city walk also that you've been training with? Another ghost  man I guess? City walk is  filled with ghosts.
 Oh wow  really? Yes.
 Really? They walk amongst the entire city yes.
  So dimensionally you'll never see them.
 But you  will never see them.
 But I see them yes.
 That sounds horrible.
 Yeah that's like a scary thing.
 That's like part of your burden  to bear.
 Um yeah it's awful.
  They just took out the upstart crow which is in this sector  in the crow's nest and that had a big scary crow on the  outside.
 I mean it was for children but it scared me.
 Is that crow  stomping around city walk and only you see him? That crow is  the devil's best friend is what we call him.
 Oh my gosh.
 Yes yes.
  Are you afraid of him like snapping your head off  or something with his giant ghost beak? Sometimes yes but other times  I'll cut deals with him and I'll feed him Menchies and he'll leave  me alone.
 Oh okay you know how to distract him.
 Yes.
 This is your  smart for a little one.
 Oh thank you.
 Yeah you can manipulate  ghost birds.
 I would just be careful of that like ghost artful dodger  that's training orphan ghosts at city walk to pick pocket  nests.
 Boys boys boys this is why it's so important to  rescue me.
 Oh okay right right.
 We're not even close to okay let's talk about these  X-rated socks to save your soul.
 X-rated socks alright.
 My  favorite sock and the X-rated sock section is  a sock that has like clouds and like stars maybe and it  says carpe the fuck out of this DM.
  Uh.
 Yeah so sorry for  swearing and cursing.
 That's hurting my spirit.
  Yeah so that's like the first sock you see when you're on the X-rated section  the next sock.
 When I thought you said wine.
  The next sock is as aggressive  and it just says but it's less clever even which the other one wasn't clever  it just says don't let anyone fuck with you and that's  it.
 What? It just says don't let anyone fuck with you.
 I don't  know if you're a person who needs that reminder on their socks if you really get  strength from that and you're going to your job and you know some supervisor  is gonna give you a flack.
 You're like yeah cause like  there's a big or yeah you're like I gotta talk to the boss today and you're like I'm gonna put on my  don't let anyone fuck with you socks.
 Put on my agro socks  my encouragement socks.
 No one's gonna fuck with you today.
 You're the  star.
 Are you trying to distribute that information to someone else  because it's facing out so other people will read it.
 Well no it's not facing out  it's on your feet.
 It says don't let anyone fuck with you like on  this part of your sock.
 Oh okay.
 So it's just for you.
 It's just a little special surprise  for you.
 If you take your shoes off.
 Yes.
 Or if you're wearing  sandals.
 Sandals with garish printed socks? Yeah  which case you're probably a great candidate for someone to fuck with you.
  Yeah.
 Those are the two  I would say from X when they're calling them X-rated  those are the only two with like F's fucks in them on the website.
  Okay good.
 But then when we were in the store I noticed there are  actual like lingerie and fishnet stocking  but there is actual like sexy stuff for sale.
 That's one of a few places you can get stockings  Hot Topic being the other one although they're of course deemed to Harley Quinn  at Hot Topic.
 Sure.
 But yeah you can get stuff like that  Yeah they call them X-rated.
 Oh you know I take that  back there's an F word on a woman's sock and it just says I gave a fuck  once.
 That's one of them.
  So cynical.
 These socks are so cynical.
 Sorry sector keeper.
  I'm just going to run.
 I'm going to read a bunch of them real quick.
  Alright these are the women's socks.
 Get shit done later.
  Don't judge me.
 Good slash bad weed.
  Hellraiser.
 I don't care.
 I'm high.
  I hate everyone.
 Kick this day in its  sunshiny ass.
 Love you weirdo.
  My favorite salad is wine.
 And then stay away  from assholes.
 My favorite salad  is wine? Yes.
 This doesn't make any more sense to us  the adults who are a lot.
 Future weird? Future weird.
  Future Winter is like random.
 It's like seriously random.
  If you knew how random it was in 2018.
 Random equal  funny? It does.
 For some people.
 Yes it does.
  Commercials think they're funny and they do a lot  of random humor and then people will say like oh that's  so random.
 So that's like what it's like in 2018.
  That's a random punchline? Well  sometimes not.
 Yeah these are all socks  for someone who you would describe as like lot going on or  coming in hot.
 But there's other  there's other socks.
 There's other socks.
 There's lots of  cute like dogs and cat socks.
 Well and socks through which you can  proudly represent your sexual preferences  like the sock with an arrow pointing up at you  that says under that I think he's gay.
  Really? What? He must feel while wearing that.
 Or the sorges  talk about pride.
 The sock that just says proud with rainbow letters.
  I mean that's nice.
 That's good.
 Next to which and proud is stacked  between bitch and boobies.
  This is quite an array.
 Lesson.
 And just a couple of notches  over from bacon.
 Yes I see on the website there's a lot of bacon stuff.
  Oh so that's another 2018 comedy thing? Bacon and stuff being described  as epi- bacon.
 It's hopefully on its way out.
 People love  bacon.
 Again tiring.
 Things being called the pizza of other things.
  Beyonce is the pizza of music.
 I thought you were going to say pizza of bacon.
  Beyonce is the pizza of bacon.
 Jason is trying to push  Beyonce is the scrapple of bacon.
 Yeah I think it's  time.
 I think it's time we moved on to bacon and I tried to do pork  roll a few years ago but the north jersey people got very upset because they call it Taylor Ham.
  It's a whole thing.
 It's a whole regional fight.
 But now we have an audience so if our audience would  please say instead of like bacon or pizza say scrapple  please.
 Well scrapple is the new thing.
 And  beseech the- go to the- find the official Twitter of the  sock maker gumball poodle and demand that they  put next to their bacon sock.
 A sock that says  scrapple.
 And then maybe Jason you could get one of those and another one that says proud.
  So you could have proud and scrapple.
 Sure.
 So you could show your pride for your  scrapple.
 Elon Musk will like tweet scrapple when he's talking about  like a cool thing.
 That's when we all will have made it as a podcast.
 Elon Musk is a  cool man in the future.
 He's good and not at all bad.
  Oh yeah if you were curious who the coolest man is in 2018.
 He's  a bounty hunter?  Well I mean he certainly is a company he's gonna set up to do  that.
 But it's gonna be in 20 years it's gonna be made.
 Only hunting rabble rousing  union drive organizers.
 That's true.
 No as far  as I know I think he's just like hanging out with the Rick and Morty  staff.
 But he's not a writer.
 He doesn't help with Rick and  Morty but he's with them a lot.
 Funding like  real shady comedy endeavor or is he-  we don't know.
 There's a lot going on in Southern California.
 He's stealing  the staff of the onion.
 Right stealing the staff.
 There's some juxtaposition  that I noticed in the sock market.
 There was  a weed leaf socks but they were  right next to the NYPD socks so  that's a lot.
 That's a trap.
 That is  a trap.
 And also  my favorite juxtaposition in the store a sock  with a screaming Donald Trump on it placed next to  a sock with Vladimir Putin.
  Which to me is like I do think if I posted this  on the Donald's reddit it might create a furor  like what are they doing? They're trying to at  you know at these Hollywood these liberal locations they're trying to  you know marry these two figures in people's heads via  socks but there's no collusion.
 So like yeah Trump would go on  a tweet storm railing against the sock market.
 I think Trump might tweet  about this if he saw it.
 Or he might say why can't  we why can't I be on a sock next to a sock of one of our so-called  enemies? What bad does that do for us? I think we should do this.
 We should post  this on reddit.
 We have people we know who are on reddit a lot.
 Maybe today  yeah let's see how far it goes.
 We will get this going on the  day of this episode and see if we can will will Trump tweet about  it by you know four hours later.
 And I will make  a sock puppet account no pun intended.
 Oh I see.
 For like  our the resistance and say like the sock market is clearly  a Kremlin backed psy-op.
 The sock  market and clearly Wolfgang Puck  had early knowledge about it because Wolfgang Puck Express or  Wolfgang Puck dining got out of there.
 They got out of the next door location.
  He got out of it.
 Yep.
 Mueller knows all this  or Mueller is daddy or 76 year old.
 And Mueller is  dressed as Rocket Raccoon in a meme that you post.
 Yeah.
  I want to how about the proud you wear one sock that says proud and  another sock that says QAnon.
 Why aren't they appealing to the QAnon crowd?  You know we could also just go back and like start to  make our own juxtaposition.
 Like you could just take the Trump sock and put it  next to different ones and then be like look what they're stocking next to.
 Like we could  create our own narrative.
 Oh yeah.
 Via the socks  and create maybe a whole like conspiracy theory web of  like a narrative that the sock market is trying to push.
 Yeah.
 And really get this thing going.
  The sock market is creating a narrative and planning clues.
 A real number  23 sort of.
 We could also make  our own socks and like put them in there.
 Like try to  like add them to the show.
 Like so like make a Stormy Daniels sock  and just add it to the like the pin next to the Donald Trump  sock.
 We could do a whole.
 I mean that's maybe a bit too ambitious  but it's a good idea I think.
 We can do the low five version of this.
  Yeah.
 We might be able to imply that Trump is interested in seizing the fuck  out of this DM.
 You know he'd say what you want  about Trump.
 He seizes the fuck out of every DM.
 Yeah.
 From like 11 to  3 PM.
 He seizes the fuck out of a  small percentage of each DM.
 He's on a European work day.
  Oh.
 Oh yeah.
 We've been at this extra  for a while.
 Boys please move on to future  Italian restaurants.
 It's okay.
 Future Italian restaurants.
 Is it going to be open by the time  we.
 I don't know when the opening date is.
 So it's  called Il Vino and this is an Italian restaurant concept that Universal  first introduced.
 Universal Orlando CityWalk is coming here.
  It seems like it's well reviewed in Orlando so I'm excited to have a new food  option at CityWalk.
 It used to be a Wolfgang Puck.
 I  don't know that a full spot more like a.
 Are you going to keep going to restaurants  at CityWalk when this is done? Well it's new.
  But not a full spago level  Wolfgang Puck experience.
 I'm just saying I've consumed my body's weight  and sodium while doing all this.
 Yeah I mean I went to.
 We're only two  sectors in.
 I went to Margaritaville.
 You've got to drink some water.
  Drink some electrolyte water.
 For not the CityWalk saga I  went to just Margaritaville the other day just with my friend to eat.
 How dare you.
  So like I'm just saying I'm still going casually.
 Yeah.
  Oh boy.
 I think I might be.
 I might need a break.
  But we'll see.
 You know things are still.
 We've got a long ways to go.
  That's a long and short of the Italian restaurant.
 That place is replacing  Wolfgang Puck.
 Yeah.
 Again kind of a more like  casual Wolfgang Puck.
 I never really ate there.
 It didn't  seem like the full Wolfgang Puck experience.
 It seemed closer to like the Wolfgang Pucks  that are like at LAX.
 Hey guess what.
 I've got a  yeah it was okay.
 I mean by CityWalk standards it was decent.
 I've actually got a fact  about one of the neon signs that is above.
 I'm not sure if it's above  this restaurant but it's in this sector and it's restaurant related.
  So all of the neon signs at CityWalk were all bought by the Museum of  Neon Art and Universal cut a deal to bring up all of their  you know their biggest signs and display them.
  Make it as you know kinetic street art up there and there is a sign  for a place called Condi's which I think was maybe in like Altadena or in the  San Gabriel Valley somewhere and there's two where there's a face  of a chef on it and apparently there was two  brothers and they would switch off who was facing the public and  seating people and who was back in the kitchen making the food so they would change the sign  every six months based on which brother was going to be cooking.
 Oh my  god that's so fun.
 Yeah.
 The Museum of Neon Art if you're ever in  Los Angeles very cool.
 Which is now in Glendale.
 Now in Glendale.
 It has moved  to a different mall, the mall where Bug Main lives.
  There's several attractions, the Museum of Neon Art  and omnipresence of Bug Main and Susan Lucci?  Yes that is the rumor that Susan Lucci.
 Oh.
 Are we allowed to say  that? Is this a dox? Well I think that's more public I think than the spirit  of Bug Main.
 I mean Bug Main is all around us.
 It's part of the mythology  of the mountain.
 Oh okay.
 He lives there I think.
 Alright as long as that's public.
 Yeah  but anyway much like Bug Main and his  multiple identities this Conde sign would change  and shift shapes.
 That's cool.
 Yeah that's just a fun fact.
 That is a fun fact.
  I'm not sure which, like is it  well he's got a chef's hat so I guess it would be the chef one  who they would portray.
 But anyway next time you're up there appreciate  that Conde sign and in fact all of the great neon art.
 The neon art  yeah terrific.
 And okay Wolfgang Puck we talked about Sephora  I don't know what I got to say about Sephora.
 It's a  yeah it seems nice.
 It's one of the new locations at both downtown  Disney and City Walk.
 Present at both the other being Starbucks.
 Both sides of  the line.
 Yeah.
 I hate to be such like a little boy about it but like Lindsey  goes in there and I like kind of wander around and be like oh well I'm gonna go to another store  oh I'll meet up with you later mom.
 Like that's basically the feeling of like my mom would go into  like the you know what I'm saying? Right on.
 I know we're talking about  something you can relate to.
 Yeah yeah.
 Go to a fun place.
 Yeah  I run over to Hot Topic and I look and see if they have any Ninja Turtle  or Harley Quinn stuff that I'm interested in or toys or something.
 Well you know it's a store with  some fun stuff.
 Well it's no longer there but the Upstart Crow.
 Yes.
  Which I forget is which is the Italian restaurant replacing that or which  I don't know I'm all discombobulated.
 Fallen Brothers.
 Yeah.
 Fallen Brothers.
 That's right.
  We call them Fallen Brothers the former stores and the Upstart Crow  is there for a long time.
 It's a  some article that I found where they were talking about you know what  residents want.
 There was a minute where Universal had to pretend that this was a real city  and they had to talk to locals about what would you want to see in a  thriving shopping living dining community  and apparently quote this article, Residents wanted a bookstore  which explains the presence of the Upstart Crow bookstore and coffee shop.
 A tiny  intellectual oasis with a big black bird perched on it.
  There he is.
 Sorry he haunts you this day.
 Yeah yeah.
  Look what they, I blame the residents for this.
 Yeah.
 That's why that  Crow's wash is in now.
 Especially the 1990s resident because bookstore with a little cafe  one of my favorite kind of shops because I was a child of the 1990s  like that is a 1990s ass-wrapped store.
 And every  because every sitcom Friends is a little bookstore  coffee shop.
 Frasier, Ellen, this was  the 90s.
 Coffee was new and books were  briefly popular again.
 You've got Mail is about a big bookstore with a coffee shop in it.
  And also, Rest in Tea, I'm sorry to tell you this, Sector Keeper, Borders has since gone under.
  Barnes and Noble is still going strong.
  And there is a Crown Books, even though that company like went  under, there's a Crown Books in a weird mall over on the other side of the 405.
  Yeah there's a couple of those.
 There's like just like Outliers but they're still exist  Borders gone? Yeah I know it's hard.
 I always thought  Borders was the cooler one.
 I always liked Borders more.
  How do I buy Lethal Weapon  for $30? On VHS is that where you would go  pick up because they had that big media section.
 Well now everything  All the books are, now you buy books from a guy  named Jeff Bezos who's even cooler than Elon Musk.
  Jeff Bezos, he's a race car  driver? He's probably driven a race, when you have that much money  you can do whatever the fuck you want.
 He owns the books and the  markets.
 Yeah he's telling groceries.
 Buying stuff online, he  sort of like figured out a way to do that and figured out how to like  cripple local economies and pay people  low money wages.
 We found a new way for just 10 people to be in charge of everything.
  That's back in a big, that wasn't  in your childhood.
 Yeah that's in Jason's childhood.
  Yes, your Carnegie's, your Melons, your  Rockefellers.
 Pre-New Deal stuff, you know, stuff Jason knows from his child.
  You like this one new Boss Tweed?  I thankfully was a nemesis of Boss Tweed.
  Me and FDR took him down.
 So he's confirming that he was a child, he is a child  from the 30's.
 Wow, you guys have so much in common.
  Yes, brothers.
 Both are so ghost.
 From different eras but  with a big commonality, your ghosthood.
 So yeah the Upstart Crow  like it was a bookstore but then it also sort of has a section  well much more so than a bookstore.
 It became  it's like Hollywood junk.
 Yeah so I'd like to read this Yelp review to show you  what exactly.
 Yeah.
 Oh this illustrates the transition.
  Well yeah so this is from, I won't say the user, but this is a  person who posts a lot on Yelp.
 It just says no more books  just a bunch of the same old plastic crap they sell on Hollywood Boulevard.
  Who needs another fake Oscar statue anyways? With the S at the end.
  Upstart Crow died in the flames of tourism and the bird that rose from  the ashes is a real turkey.
 The great coffee house and bookstore is  long gone.
 City Walk needs to take down the sign or change the name to Store  Full of Crap.
 And then there's a William Shakespeare quote.
 I must be cruel  only to be kind.
 Thus bad begins and worse remains behind.
  That's an interesting choice because the term Upstart Crow  comes from Shakespeare's rival Robert Greene  in his groats worth  of wit.
 He describes Shakespeare as an Upstart Crow  beautified with our feathers.
 So  bodied, owned, Shakespeare eat it.
 So this was  a good quote to put into this Yelp review of the Upstart Crow at City Walk.
  Apropro.
 Apropo? I still don't know.
 Did you say  Aprocrow? Oh I wish I did.
 Oh I wish I said Aprocrow.
  You can from now on.
 Yeah but an Upstart Crow beautified  with our feathers I guess because people would throw feather, tarzan feathers.
  I don't quite understand this bird.
 You aren't that old  of a bird.
 No I'm not that old.
 But you know  in the defense of the Upstart Crow there is some excellent  culture going on there which specifically  they sell a very cool item which is  driver's licenses of some of your favorite  stars.
 This was a big loss.
  I have a pile of photos of this nature and  you know, well first of all if you're in the fake ID  market, if you're a youngster like yourself actually if you wanted to  get a drink you could get one of these and you could pose as John Lennon.
  People might believe that you're John Lennon.
 I could use John Lennon's ID  to get naughty socks.
 Ah yes.
 It's true.
 Go straight next  door.
 Well you gotta get this from a different location now.
 I think now  your only option for novelty driver's licenses is  35 stores on Hollywood Boulevard.
 But if you get that head up the hill  and get some rainy socks.
 Yeah once we free you, once we release you.
  The first place I'm going Hollywood Boulevard.
 Hurray for Hollywood.
  This ghost boy is getting a prostitute.
  You're making up for lost time.
  Let's learn.
 But let me read  there's a lot of great details about all of these driver's  licenses because like a real driver's license it has a lot of different stats.
  You know birth date, the day that it expires and then an area  called restriction.
 So let me read some of John Lennon's stats  here.
 You get just height, weight, regular stuff.
 But then you get license number  FAB4.
 That's fun.
 His birth date, his real date  in 1940 and then expires 12-8-1980.
  That's insane.
 That's the most morbid thing I've ever seen.
  Real date of John Lennon's murder.
 I cannot believe they would do that.
 Why would they do that?  On this fun thing where we remember old cool John Lennon.
 We have  to remember the date he was shot.
 Wait what is his address on it too?  Is it the Dakota? It's the Dakota apartment.
 Jesus Christ.
  That is so crazy.
  It may as well be covered in blood.
 Like let's be honest.
  What's his name? Chapman.
 He would love this thing.
 When it was a  bookstore was this next to a rack of the catcher of the ride?  You could use this as a bookmark.
 And then this odd  kind of freestyle section, restriction, where in all of these they kind of do  whatever there.
 His restriction is listed as Yoko Ono.
  That's fucked up too.
 What does that even mean? Yeah very odd.
  There's a license, if you keep going there's a license plate for  a driver's license for Jack Bauer.
 A.
K.
A.
 Keith or Sutherland.
  Keith or Sutherland.
 His restriction is  terrorists and he expires never.
 And of course his license  number 24.
 If we keep going down the line  Carlos Santana  his class is smooth.
  Well that's for sure.
 I would only buy that if I could  buy the Rob Thomas one.
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 Restriction.
 Give me your  heart class.
 Make it real.
 Address or else forget  about it.
 The driver's license  for Halle Berry.
 She is  a license number, this is very appropriate, license number 34  2236.
 Upsetting.
 Yeah, her class is  Oscar, that's true, good for her and her  restriction is diabetes.
 Does she have  diabetes? Evidently, I sense of Google.
 God damn it.
 But that's a fact  you learn from this novelty driver's license.
 And then  yeah this is, these are incredible.
 And then one more right under  that, Megan Fuchs whose restriction is Decepticons.
  And her across the top says smoking hot.
  This is a great area of  merchandise.
 I would have bought all of them except  I realized why spend $45 when I could take photos  and talk about them on a podcast two years later.
 If the place was open it would  that is worth investigating like what company made that to really figure out  like to dig deep and figure out like and same with the stock market figure out who is  there's different companies that do it but like figure out the joke writers  maybe like I think one or two big companies own a lot of those  sock lines and just sell them as different like  it's like a Jeff Bezos style scam where it's like  all the same company but they have like different shell companies and they name it different things  yeah or how like Old Navy Gap, Banana Repo  that's all like one umbrella with different lines.
 Yeah those licenses  the Lenin one is the craziest.
 It expires.
 It's insane  yeah if they did that for Princess Diana  and Prince and restriction  fentanyl.
 Opiates.
 Like what?  Why is that a fun? Yeah maybe Christian Science  maybe Jehovah's Witness  maybe Good The Store Clothes  maybe Good.
 Could be true.
 Alright so not every fallen brother  is a bad fallen brother.
 Justified.
 Yeah yeah  ran its course.
 Stop insulting the dead.
 Was mine? Aren't you  offended as a dead person? Yes.
 If they listed if you if they made that  for you and your restriction was disease filled fountains.
 Yeah if my restriction  was staph infection.
 And it listed your  expiration the day that the accident happened? Yes and I expired  a week before Mighty Ducks came out  on that sale right? Yeah.
 You were looking forward to the Mighty Ducks.
 Yes  oh man.
 Well you know what under class for you sector keeper  I put first.
 I think you're a first class kid.
 Yeah.
 Boys  thank you boys boys you give me strength.
 Hey  and by giving me strength I give you this  stone.
 It's the sector 2 stone.
 Go ahead hold it  and take a look.
 Oh wow.
 Beautiful.
 Wow it's shaped like the Dakota  apartment.
 That's right.
 And John Lennon's body is lying outside of it.
  On the back side of it it says Carpe the Fuck out of this DM.
 Yes.
  Wow.
 You know what that's a more beautiful piece of poetry than anything  that idiot John Lennon ever thought of.
 Yeah so I mean  thank you for the stone and I feel good about this journey like I really do  I think we're gonna do.
 I'm so excited to see where it takes us.
 Your opacity  has increased I think 2 more percent since we started.
 Yes you brought me great strength and  I thank you so much and just remember to keep on the journey  and to obey the sector scrolls.
  Okay.
 Yes.
 We'll make sure there's no deviation from  these sector borders that have been set up.
 Right if it's sector 7  and it's 4 different places we'll stick to those 4 places  and that's what we'll do.
 Be real firm about this.
 Yeah.
 Alright we'll come  back tomorrow for more fun.
 Uh for more  city walking.
 Okay.
 And a lot of fun stuff tomorrow and for the  next 17 days beyond this.
 I'm going  back to purgatory I'll talk to you later.
 Okay.
  I'll be in every now and then.
 Take care.
 See you.
 Bye bye.
  Thank you.
 See you tomorrow.
 Good guy.
 Alright.
 You guys we'll see you tomorrow.
