 joints  Born with Northfort  Upbeat music  Started with a complete blues  Upbeat music  Alright, nice leisurely Club 3 beginning.
 None of that pressure, you know?  We get to just like ease into the pool here.
 Yeah, I like it.
 This is none of the pressure of having to remember your guys names  We can just start and it's no one needs to know our names  Just like just easing into it like we're all just unclothed easing into a jacuzzi together to hang for two hours  We are recording this at the Los Angeles Los Angeles famous we spa  The spa in Koreatown would someone I think suggested we do as an episode topic  I was confused by that suggestion.
 Yes a spa is a as a themed experience  It is a themed experience.
 I think there's some tropical ish rooms  Yeah, I know I think that's actually a good idea.
 I don't want to do it maybe right now, but eventually I mean  I'm not just the bar with themed car washes of what yeah  Yeah, I don't you'd answered it with their tropical stuff  Yeah  Cuz I when I I was in a I went and got a massage years ago with the Planet Hollywood  casino in  Las Vegas and I remember going into sort of the room with the showers and everything and it felt like I was like  It was with my friend Luke I was like it feels like we're on planet like Vulcan  We're in like some kind of like futuristic kind of otherworldly place in here.
 I really like this.
 So okay  Yeah, I think I place making and yeah, so what you're saying is partial nudity feels alien to you  Full nudity feels  Yeah, I was like look at all the dicks around here.
 This feels like planet Vulcan.
 This is like the Vulcan  This was a spa not just some particular this wasn't some this wasn't a Star Trek convention after hours  And this was in the Las Vegas Star Trek convention at like 11 p.
m  One of the bunch of guys naked wearing the Spock ears  And some some people who decorated their penises the way that they think maybe  Like a Klingons penis would look right what does Klingon circumcision would look like with the war blade that they do it  It's not it's a ritual that we all know  Sure, right  Yeah, yeah  Well, well, okay  Well, there's an idea right there because we have to talk about I don't mean to start these episodes and immediately go to what we're  Doing in the future.
 No  Yes, how do you decorate your penis properly at a Star Trek convention is a viable topic?  But to talk about a couple other  Topics that came up in this month's poll.
 There's one I want to say really fast  I'm really excited that people want to hear me do the universal tour  I'm very flattered by that, but I will just say there's bigger plans for the tour down the road  This has been talked about for a while.
 I don't know when it's gonna happen.
 I don't know.
 That's the next year thing  So don't worry.
 That's that's coming.
 We don't got a club three it but there is another  thing and  Before we get to Disney dollars, which is which is today Disney dollars was the winner  But we established the rule that the runner-up  Lives to fight another day that they're up in the next round and I just want to say a quick word about  Let me read the full  suggestion from Shane Cannon  Show your penises to each other at Los Angeles is famous.
 We spa  All right, thank you Shane for that thought and yeah, we're absolutely down and  showing if you want  No, no, no, that's not wait a minute.
 We're reading the wrong Shane Cannon  Suggested this please discuss the failed Canadian Garfield restaurant  Garfield eats the failed Canadian Scooby-Doo frozen food brand Scooby-Doo eats and the founder of both of them  Archetypal guy quote-unquote and noted hyper narcissist Nathan Masri now  It was too much to put that all I don't know.
 Maybe we could have put that full text into the poll  I'm not sure but I just left it at failed Canadian restaurant  Garfield eats  never has a  Suggestion called to me so strongly.
 This is a this is a true siren song  I'd go across the ocean to to discover to learn more about  Garfield this were this really this just this just hit me  I don't know how you guys feel but I wanted to take a second to vouch for  And and look I'll just say I and endorse the idea  Failed Canadian restaurant Garfield eats the reason it's so attractive now on its own Garfield eats Scooby-Doo eats, whatever that sounds great  We would love to look into that when you add in a guy a new guy  Guy using the term guy  Happy makes me so happy to cake.
 Yeah, so that's why yeah, it sounds so intriguing  We are dying to learn about guys  Yeah  Dying to go into spas and dying to learn about guys  Yeah, and then he that he kept going is what I like.
 I think there was a minute where I'm I'm loving the polls  I'm fascinated by the moment.
 I start to watch them and like, okay, this one's breaking ahead  But these two are neck and neck like this  Failed Canadian restaurant Garfield eats was neck and neck with the Universal Studios GameCube game where you have to pick up trash  And I love both of these  I know I didn't want to be fighting for one over the other but then Shane gets in the comments and starts  Campaigning further and I'm gonna read his full quote  But just to again just be I in to further his campaign because this I saw it turn literally he wrote this and then there  Were more votes after it sure way out of the pack  People listen to me.
 This guy is fucking insane Nathan Masri  He's at fashion cafe levels of insane if not more this story's got everything copyright disputes  Bizarre original characters weird one-off attempts at doing a reality TV thing insane corporate  terminology self-help books  Entergaging digital content that is some of the corporate terminology  He invented the acquibius term of entergaging Wow the deification of Jim Davis  Garfield creator very intense anti-boomer sentiment and more so please please please vote  Garfield my gosh, what a list got more tantalizing than lasagna is the Garfield.
 Mm-hmm.
 Yeah.
 No that sells it pretty well  Yeah, yeah, so we're not gonna tell you what to do  No, you got a pretty big Disney theme park  Pretty pretty bit.
 It's kind of like a blockbuster like with Netflix  You know surprise it's the Super Bowl and when the game's over you get a new Cloverfield movie on Netflix  You know, I think that's how that release panned out.
 I may be conflating  I think you're right.
 I think it was a new color when there's just a big  unavoidable thing in culture like the gray man when there's something that each and every one of us is talking about that's  Dominating every conversation we're having like the gray man is right  Yeah, we run into on the street with our family and friends our parents the milkman  Yeah, the milkman as well tips his cap.
 We're all little red notice boys  And now we're all little gray men boys and where the boys go now.
 Where do we go? I think maybe we go to  Orange, I mean I guess we're red.
 We were little and now we're orange  I guess we backtrack and we've become spider head boys, you know  You guys know spider head spider head is the big budget blockbuster starring Miles Teller  Yeah, and the Hemsworth that play store  It's based on a yes.
 This is the came from the director of  Mission of top Tom Capric that came out right after and yet.
 No one was talking about that  Yeah based on a George Saunders short story  I think from right around when he went one of MacArthur genius grant acclaimed author George Saunders and it just  Dropped right as Maverick was in the middle of like demolishing the box office and I have not heard any  Mention of it Wow.
 Well people are look we we flew with miles  we watched him make the offer we watched him and  Very accurate Al Pacino  Go through all the steps of making the godfather.
 So maybe people just ready  I can't believe I'm saying this  Maybe people are ready for a little miles break and I just mean for like three weeks  Like it was just weird to do with that.
 Sure.
 Yeah, absolutely  We'll be back.
 Yeah, you know, hey, that'll be one of the topics next time to just talk about Miles Teller  No notes.
 You don't get notes  You just get to just talk on the top of your heart about your love of Miles Teller free associate  Anyway, are we just like condemning other topics? Yes to the yes.
 This is oh boy  It is this that maybe this is collusion is this what would you call it? What is I don't think we said any rules  I don't think there's a constitution that we have to abide by no.
 No, I think we're okay  I think we're not breaking any I don't think so, but do maybe people want to try maybe that will like  Turn against it fight  Again, like maybe people want to try to take it down to slay the beast, right?  I mean, maybe I can just yeah, I mean obviously I threw out the idea that Liberace puppet  ventriloquist performance  Yeah, throw that in so stuff so so yeah, I don't know maybe either people could rally around this or people would feel like you  Can't tell us what to do and then they'll vote that we need to review  Everclear songs from an American movie part two or something.
 I don't know  That seems like the strategy is gonna be such a grand swell for Everclear songs from American movie party.
 Yeah  we will see  but I just I just wanted to give that some some time and  And boy, I don't know I when there's a guy calling to you there's a guy  Yeah, yeah.
 Yeah, so leave your comments below what you want to hear if you want to try to if we want to try to take on  Garfield eats.
 Mm-hmm  But I don't know babe best of luck to you're gonna be you could be the spider head going up against the top gun  It's gonna be like a midnight and like a patreon club 3 subscriber  Well, their phone will ring and it'll be an unknown number and it'll be a muffled voice  And go look I just need you to do the right thing here  I need you to vote for the right thing and like Scott is that you and then the hang up and then that'll happen with  Everyone and I know we're very loyal.
 I know we're very smart  50 extra looking for all I'm looking for is  200 extra votes for Garfield eats and if it doesn't work, you know what you're gonna do you have to send Rudy out  And he'll find him  Crack team that's right  It's done somehow and if not, we'll get our revenge in four years  Damn it you pay him and Rudy will go and try to get people to vote for Garfield  He doesn't give a shit as long as he's good thinks he's getting money.
 Oh, that's true.
 Yes  All right, if somebody sends this to Rudy Giuliani, yeah  Your starting rate will be three thousand dollars an hour right money that you will definitely receive and Rudy if you don't take it  You know Robert Davi will that's true  What did Robert Davi do for I don't know.
 He's just kind of a Trump guy.
 Oh, yeah.
 Yeah.
 No, he's a sleaze  I didn't but I was like, babe.
 Was he actually deployed along with the sit down?  I don't even really believe it.
 Yeah, I don't he might have been working pro bono, you know trying to get in the yeah  Well for you working for exposure  He's working for exposure to get in the like whatever the Hollywood version of like pure flicks.
 Whatever you call their  the Kirk Cameron movies  The Gina Carano ex-kirk Cameron movies  He'd be in as the king of the heavies if he's already doing stuff like that.
 I forgot.
 What is he famous for him again?  Why do we know Robert Davi like old like he was just I think he was a supporting actor in some movies  There's like a big one.
 It's like under siege or something like that big action.
 I don't remember  Has a license to kill.
 Yeah  Okay  Records probably goonies.
 Yeah, that's what I yeah because he did a he did a funnier die video and part of the  stipulation was that he  Get to it some like turn to camera and say and buy my album Davi does Sinatra  Always in die hard.
 No first I heard.
 Yeah.
 Oh, yeah.
 That's like a number one.
 I think  I believe that's either funnier and I'm remembering season music if you can believe that something that a very Trumpy guy is also  Is it?  Okay, threat Trump fan and creep.
 Can you do you believe it's possible?  I hard believe  Okay, we are here to talk about the today's time.
 Let's focus on today's topic  Which was which one after the previous round?  It came back and got it  Suggestion from JF co the original crypto Disney dollars company script  Corporate script as Wikipedia points out.
 This is company money  Yeah, yes.
 This is a private company in the world making their own money  For you the the consumer to spend because there's another I think there's a tie  I don't know the ins and outs of script.
 I remember this idea existing at school  But there's like script that you give to your employees  Yes, that's now what's happening here because we are the customers and we can choose to get their script the  like like  miners  Mining companies would pay their you know, it's kind of stranded in homestead like kind of can't leave the wilderness  miners in company script that you could use at the company store.
 Oh  I see so it's like if Amazon paid in Amazon bucks their employees which we're not that far off, you know  No, well, wasn't this the Elon Musk's revolutionary plan is that you get you go to Mars and you get paid in Mars bucks  Well, I yes you get paid a Mars bucks and you work off your trip to Mars.
 Yes  Yeah, everyone on Mars is an indentured servant.
 Mm-hmm  Yeah to their well-toned boss God Elon Musk  Yeah, he had the many secret babies  That's most either people reinventing the concept of buses or reinventing like slavery  Mm-hmm.
 They all figure it out.
 They'll crack it.
 He had to bring it into the 21st century, right?  Yeah, just with a spacey futuristic twist and it made sense that they would be the whitest man  The you know, the literal whitest man you've ever seen a white South African who could have foreseen  Who could have foreseen that coming?  Look, this is not malicious like that.
 I don't know think Disney dollars  I was like I was waiting for in look I'm we're gonna learn about Disney dollars  I think I was waiting for the malicious turn and I don't think I found it other than it's like a way for Disney to  Make lots of money by making money literally  But that's isn't this what they do?  All the time and now they do it in these ways that are dull and not ways where you get  Fun looking money.
 I think it looks fun, right? I always liked it.
 Oh, I loved it.
 I definitely had some Disney dollars  It was a fun like little souvenir  It was a fun like way of like, okay, you have five Disney dollars to use on souvenirs.
 Like how are you gonna use it?  It was a good it's a good little  practice money  Situation for kids.
 Yeah, and I would always say I mean I definitely have some at my mom's house of the the blue and pink  $1 one the early generation ones  But I researching this I saw somewhere I was like I had no idea about some of these designs  Well, yeah, I was shocked as well.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah, they went into what 2014  2016 Wow.
 Yeah, that's pretty far.
 So that's time to incorporate  Lots of characters into the fold.
 Oh, yeah does not have to stay at Mickey goofy many  No, a lot how many friends started to appear? Yeah, it could be Iron Man at that point and all his his friends  And I found a page there is still a page on the Disney World website of how to use Disney dollars  Because while they do not print them anymore  They still accept them as legal tender at the domestic parks in America  Okay, Disney Cruise Line some locations at Castaway Key  You can be a swimmer.
 You're on the private island  You're swimming around and you can have Disney dollars with you to bartender and Disney dollars and Castaway Key  That is my one one of my questions I had was there a high roller  You know people if they're playing blackjack or or poker and they they throw a chip when they're leaving for to tip the dealer  You always got to tip your dealer.
 Yeah, we're there where their Disney lounge lizards  Who would like tip the bartender and Disney? I'm sure there's no way there weren't right? Yeah, no way there weren't  I don't not good.
 That's not good.
 Now.
 We're in this now.
 We're in this I mean, I think well you could you could redeem the dollars at least  Seemingly pretty easily for regular American currency  Yes, I think you I think completely the the extent of your Disney dollar day could be hey  I have these can I get money for them? Yeah, so you could do that  But it's just with the somebody you're tipping you're just adding another step they have to do but maybe they had it in the register  I don't know that's so maybe they don't make the exchange themselves.
 So who knows? Yes, but yes, there's got to be like  Weirdo Disney people that keep the keep a keep a Mickey for yourself  Did anyone bribe someone with Disney dollars now that's a question  Oh boy, like can you get us to the front of this? Can you get us the front of phantasmag? If you know what I'm saying?  There's a Captain Jack Sparrow in it for you  Or there's a pirate skull whatever it was.
 There's like a skull logo  Disney dollar.
 Did you see those the pirates? Yeah, the movie one.
 Yeah, I read the movie parts of the Caribbean  Yeah, a Disney dollar.
 Yeah, I bet somebody did  Try to bribe someone with that before did anyone I know this is a thing in Vegas  I've never tried it.
 I want to try it.
 Do you know about the $20 trick?  when you put the $20 in like your  Slide use a slide trick.
 We're trying to bribe somebody right? It's even easier  It's when they say can I just need to when you're checking into hotel?  Yeah, they say I need to see an ID and your credit card  You put the 20 between them and you ask are there any upgrades available?  Okay, but there's mixed reviews some people  Works others say like if you're staying at like win or  Win or encore or like a Bellagio or something  There's high role like those are high-end places.
 You might have to try a 50 or a hundred  Too rich for my blood, but I do want to try you've never tried the 20 trick  No, I want to I do want I want to and I wonder if people try it at Disney  I've never tried it Disney, but I did try to tip the person was really nice who checked me in when I stayed at  pop century and  They were with the college program and I asked them about it and I tried say I said thank you  And I tried to tip them they're like, oh front desk.
 We can't take tips  I was like, come on.
 You're in the college for come on.
 I know they don't pay you a lot like I and she's like no  I'm sorry.
 I can't interesting.
 So that 21  $20 a trick won't work probably Disney.
 Yeah, I don't know about that  But if you're gonna do you're gonna try this and they you're going to Vegas.
 I am going to Vegas  I am going to try it.
 What tell right? Huh? What hotel? I don't know when this episode is coming out.
 That's after that  park MGM  Make sure it goes out tonight now.
 Yeah, I'm gonna put this episode  No, it's not not the month yet.
 It's not the right month yet.
 You're fine  Are you seeing so so in or get in a car get to Vegas and this is your chance to see Jason  Yeah, are you seeing soul sonic? What are you doing? What are you doing there? Sole son? Oh the  Yeah, yeah  It's great.
 Yeah, I bet it is great.
 I think it's 250 at least you're in for 250 if you want to sit anywhere good  But it's probably awesome.
 Oh sure  So try the tree this is wild.
 Not bad.
 Yeah, we'll try that night.
 No, but it'll be in September  Yeah, the Aerosmith will be back  So, okay to try the 20 trick  Yeah, see if you can get into our show back  I I have heard people say like if they're not down for it  They'll just say thank you, but I there's nothing available right now and give you the 20 back.
 Okay.
 Yeah  I think it would be really funny if they kept the 20  Said there's nothing available.
 I would be laughing the whole trip  Yeah, sure not like  Furious months later, I'll be furious  It's like gambling you know, you only gamble with money you're willing to lose sure, you know, of course, yeah, yeah  But this money this not this  Sort of fake money except not I guess it's not I mean like that  I mean, I think that the thing that makes this stand apart  Where it's not just a fancy way of doing gift cards is that the legal tender nature of it?  Yeah  And it is that they went all these steps to make it like real money to print it in a fancy  Manner that there are the security measures.
 Yeah, they really did this up like cereal numbers  What yeah serial numbers here on the various raised the paper is raised  So it's like you can tell if it's fake or not I recall the the texture of it  I remember it feeling you know, it's yeah, it's elevated.
 It's better  It's better than just a piece of paper.
 Oh, yeah was I don't I think my this is my memory of it  That I always wanted Disney dollars, but my mom was like why we just use our money.
 Let's use our money  Very good question.
 You're like extremely good quiz like we don't want to get stuck with a bunch of Disney dollars  So I was just like, oh, come on.
 I want fun money.
 I want characters  I know I don't want yeah fucking presidents who gives a shit but Mickey.
 Yeah, Mickey on my money makes sense  but but the more I think about it like  When you had it, do you remember like where you know money is dirty and gross was who are Disney dollars  Do you remember were they like fresh crisp or were they like?  Oh, yeah, this has been in somebody's pocket for six months.
 Maybe they didn't I don't think they were giving them out as chain  I think they maybe had one turn around the horn.
 Okay, cuz I wasn't sure about that up  I just don't remember seeing a dirty Disney dog  It makes sense that they didn't give you a dirty Disney dollar  But I don't think that yeah, I don't think they're handing you and the one and two and three  But I didn't see it when I was was looking through this stuff  I was like, I'm not sure cuz I  Imagine yes, they would be like if some Disney dollar looked like it had been to the mill like there no way  They're handing out to a guest.
 Yeah  No, I think they're keeping it crisp it's like the parks themselves like they've always got a look spick and span right?  Make sense.
 Yeah, you don't want you don't want to start getting it's like phone numbers  Written on it and like, you know  Crude objects or body parts pointed into our favorite characters.
 No, that's true.
 No, we don't want that mommy my my  Disney dollar says  Clinton crime family on it.
 What does that mean?  Yeah, no, so so I don't know I  Wonder I'm sure they would have to yeah, Disney would have to take a dirty Disney dollar  But they would not ever hand up a dirty thing.
 So and they're brighter.
 They're brighter than dollars  They were also slightly larger than us  Okay, more difficult to fit in your wallet.
 Yes.
 I kind of remember that I remember the envelopes  I remember the envelopes are very reminiscent of the old Disney store with kind of the like the very like 80s pink stripes  Yeah, and I remember them existing.
 There's you ever seen an original in there.
 Oh, there's the envelope  Yeah, someone is selling on eBay this one which comes with the envelope and this I had never seen before this is a  2000 it's got the 2000 Epcot ball on it.
 Okay.
 Yeah, they would do like anniversary  Batches, which I know I don't remember seeing any of these like these other ones.
 I just remember  Classics.
 Yeah.
 Well, it's if this was happening now  Jason I think especially would be on the blogs being like, oh my god  Did you see what they're putting out like you got to see this like lightning McQueen has his own Disney dollar  We got to go down and get the new dollar.
 Yes  Yeah, if it was happening now, even though it was happening while we were still obsessed with other stuff  But we just weren't it wasn't on our radar.
 It didn't occur to me.
 I think that it was still going  In the 2010s and it also didn't occur to me that like it was over until they're like yes done  We're not doing it anymore.
 I do think if he wants a cheap win a cheap pop Bob Bob  Chay Peck if Bob Chay Peck was like we're bringing back Disney dollars.
 I think people would go like yes  I think so.
 I think yeah, even though it's just a literal like financial exchange.
 Yeah  It's something about I don't know it's just more friendly and  Silly than a lot of the other stuff lately  The one dollar bill has the big red panda from turning red and the five dollar bill has Grogu baby Yoda  And people are just like oh my god  I'm carrying a wallet.
 I'm using cash again and then ten dollars has George Clooney from Tomorrowland on it.
 Oh, yeah  beloved three beloved characters what else would it  Starts in May 1987 we start with Mickey on the one goofy on the five  1990 mini joins on the ten and I think other denominations  Showed up after so maybe talk about the the starting  Of it.
 J.
C.
 You were alluding to there's there's a couple versions of the story of why they started doing this  Yeah, you were saying one of them.
 I  The name I kept coming across was Harry Bryce who was credited as the silhouette cutter on Main Street and  He went to a Disney Anna convention, you know collectibles and tchotchkes and stuff  And he was like man people are spending money hand over fist on this stuff  What if they just what if we had what if Disney just had their own money?  Mm-hmm people would probably and he is probably it this story is probably, you know apocryphal  But like he is right and I'm sure there was the thought of and then people are gonna collect those dollars  In addition to using them as dollars and he's right because I have been to there's a Disney on a convention every now  And then I'd like the Anaheim Wyndham and there are vendors gone to that.
 I went to one of these a few years ago  I haven't been back but I get their postcards every few months  and  One or two of the vendors just has binders and binders of brochures napkins Disney dollars  There's like all paper product vendors.
 Okay.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Well and then just also as far as  the idea of gift cards alone  Gift cards are I believe a very big moneymaker because there's some percentage of gift cards that just go unused  So it's a really good way for businesses to make money in general because if you  Force people to have to spend the money at a business  Oftentimes people will forget or they will lose the gift card and I don't know what the percentage is  But it's a very good moneymaker for for a lot of businesses because they will not have to redeem all of the money  That people are putting into their gift cards  I saw a number a guess from a Disney executive about how much money there is in unspent  Disney dollars  Disney dollars that were never put back into so that are sitting somebody's drawer  20% I don't think or not a percentage just a number  How much money did Disney make on Disney dollars that were never given back to them one million dollars?  25 million dollars two hundred  Two hundred  Millions and millions of bill of literal bills.
 Yeah.
 Yeah, we probably had it seems very positive  I thought before this I should probably go check my my childhood bedroom  Yeah, because some of the intent of it was like I'm not gonna sell this and this is like  If we keep it crisp, that'll look nice later  I feel like there was the intent to oh, let's see if it accrues value  Which I they have but not to like I still don't know how you're like  I don't but there are probably people who've made good money  Well, if you the Disney dollar collecting if you look on eBay, I feel like it's like maybe three times  What the currency says around that?  I think even well, I mean I kept seeing like there's depending on what it is for sure  So the the 2001 that comes with an envelope  I think that was going for like 30 bucks on eBay.
 They go for even more on  Hold on.
 I gotta find these website names.
 They're so good  Those are like Disney collectible specific.
 No, no the bank note collecting websites  So they go for even more on bank note world calm and they're really high on boolean sharks  And I gotta say once I started digging in it reminded me I love little peaks into niche areas of  collecting  That I I I just get the gist of it and it's like there is a whole other world  He little terminology little terminology  Damages and little like nicknames for things and it's joyless  It's not they have not had fun doing this for decades some of them  But some of them are probably slogging through it.
 Yeah  Yeah  The what is it their departure website our departure board calm?  I think is the website I found and they talk about like you want to buy a bank note album  Okay, and you'll either get like a three slot  Pages or two slot pages now that Disney dollars are a little bigger  So you probably want a two slot page and you don't want steer clear of PVC  Polyvinyl chloride because it can degrade the notes the album below is made of  Museum quality PVC free acid free material and you got a new mess.
 It's a new miss brand  So, you know, you're not willing to pay for new miss then don't then stay out of the game  Yeah, just throw it in a garbage can light it on fire.
 You know, why bother?  Do you have one of those in your bag here that you're gonna show us?  I started I was gonna say and they couldn't bring a new miss out in the elements.
 Yeah, you're right  That's to the human  Yeah, you want to keep that room completely perfectly climate controlled.
 Yeah.
 Yeah, give it its own room get it  Yeah rent an apartment with a bedroom that you only put your new missus in no PVC a mile mile nearer  That's restraining order against  Absolutely  Yeah, no, it's this very specific word, but it's I clearly like patience required to  Get it up to the point where it's making you  Because that this is one of the things I wanted to I was wondering about is this initiative this premise from  JF co who suggested the original crypto is there is there any truth to this?  How does it compare contrast to crypto now?  Here we have it  There is a very literal people have it as a crew like I kept it and then in the years since now  I'm able to sell it for this on eBay.
 So there's growth there.
 So here's what it is  Here's what I would say comparing it to even of any currency  The big thing with Bitcoin that people say is good is that there's a finite amount  You can never print you can never make more  so  Mm-hmm  so it will accrue value because because the like, you know when inflation happens stuff oftentimes is because  We've printed a lot of money in like American currency  so I feel like Disney dollars became more like Bitcoin once they stopped making them because there is a finite amount now that's  processed like  So the real they made that shift exactly  Yeah  So now it is a little bit more like that when there is a fun unless they start printing again  Which I guess always possible right now.
 There is a certain fixed supply now.
 We don't know what it is  I'd be interested to know how many dollars exactly were printed.
 Do we know that I don't okay?  Somebody might and if somebody should know it if they go through the records, but so again, I cite our departure board.
com  As a full list of Disney dollars that are like the letter are  Our departure board  Pirates oh  You are departure board.
 They have a list.
 I don't know if it's I'm sure it's not everyone in circulation  I think it's all the serial now all the varieties.
 Yeah, and you can have that document for 750  Seven dollars fifty cents.
 Oh, okay, and it says all the varieties that have ever been made  I believe that's what it is, but it doesn't say how many of each have been made or does it?  Well, if it's got the serial number ranges, I guess you could then  Do the math.
 Oh  I see.
 Yes, that's you're right.
 If it does have the serial number we could figure it out  We have to get our hands on this document those go from zero zero one two  Yeah  Number things I know okay, so there's this the serial numbers sequence of numbers  There is a letter at the beginning and at the end the one at the end doesn't seem to mean anything  the  Prefix which is the letter at the beginning?  Tells you where this dollar is made for  ABE was for Disneyland D F is for Disney World  T was for the Disney Store  This is similar to if you look at a dollar bill  There's a letter on the serial number that tells you what meant that dollar bill comes from there's like a dozen  Or no, I think there's seven or eight big mints across the country  So on the letters the letters on a dollar bill go through like a through  Whatever it is J or K.
 Maybe it's 12 so you can get a full set of like eleven dollars  One from each of the mints does that make sense?  If you're a money collector you look at the serial numbers and you can tell like oh I want to have  Yeah, something from this bill for me a year from every mint.
 Yes, uh-huh, right and then you put it in your thing  What is it called?  banknote no, but the book the book the  Was it cold? Oh  Forgot already new miss new miss.
 Thank you.
 Okay.
 I need to write these things new man for future  Everything new miss the phrase I was trying to remember was philatist which is stamp collector stamp collecting  Wait is a philatist philatist  Ph it does sound probably saying it wrong  Phil at e li st  Mm-hmm  Philat I mean, how would you sure are we sure on that pronunciation?  I was reading the dictionary calm  the  phonetic  The philatist.
 Yes, that's not can that be real Israel? I mean, I know that's the word  fully  flately lately specialty in flately.
 Yeah  for lately for lately  Wow  Yeah, how else are you gonna pronounce that word?  I had like two losses a little kid where I went maybe I'll collect stamps  I am going to be a flattest mother  They put out the Elvis stamp and I was like, maybe I'll collect stamps.
 I just started taking them off  Letters that had been sent like birthday cards  Only like a quarter of them were new stamps and then a bunch of them were just to use stamps  I was like, yeah, I think I'm done with this and then every few years I'm like, oh, I gotta get the Pixar stamps  I gotta get the Bugs Bunny stamps and then they sit on my desk and then I go like why I need to use  Stan I need to mail thing like I'm not gonna save the wall  You've made attempts at being a philatist.
 Yeah, but then it's like well, I gotta pay my tax  So Bugs Bunny and the mermaid Bugs Bunny is going to the government.
 So he drafted in.
 Yeah  latest I mean for a for a  Hobby that you would get made fun of for for it to have that name is pretty insane  A hobby that you would get picked on for being like a nerd is pretty crazy that that's that's the word to describe  Yeah, that's one you only use among, you know fellow travelers  So, you know, that's you don't use that you don't tell your kids at school that you know  Are we we're missing an L guys, isn't it?  philatelist  Philly which I think helps it  Philatelist is what I'm seeing unless that's a different.
 Okay.
 I guess yeah, here we go  I think that I think the L does a lot of heavy lifting.
 We're not it.
 We're not in the fellatio realm  Of course it has an L  That's madness  Do it how to pronounce sing on and it's  From it we just wasted  Philatelist here's the thing from the latest to philatelist in the course of a few minutes  My god, I love this  No, did you wait a minute? Did you have the L in your notes or to bail?  No, I mean I was looking at the like upside down letters spaced out  Pronunciation and I just kind of was a typeface.
 Yeah  Yeah, that list is in there philatelist  Yeah, philatelist now here's a quick now  We say a lot the people are screaming into their phones the right thing on this now  I would be shocked if there's more than one person listen when I look at the philatest philatelist it says for lately  so  Dam collectively, so it's philatelie.
 So that's where I thought  So it's fuzz.
 It's a pH.
 So I don't think we're not even pH is fair.
 Yeah, it's pernet  Yeah out loud.
 It works better than written.
 Yeah, I'm looking I'm staring at the written word philatelist and I see no issues here  No, you're right now that when I'm looking at the actual word, it's not that's if I scroll lower.
 Yeah.
 Yeah, you're correct  I don't think we're gonna have stamp collectors mad at us  I think we're gonna have trivia experts mad at us to like know this term because it was his jeopardy answer  It was a bar trivia scrabble.
 Oh scrabble is a good one  A lot of points on that only you don't if you won a game with philatelist that might be the only way  This is in your head.
 I've looked up philatelists  And I don't think that's actually a word so we'll be okay.
 All right  There's something that says diary of a voracious philatist  But I'm not  A film  What media are we talking? It's a live journal I think oh  Jesus that could go any direction.
 I'm not gonna read it.
 I don't want to just think this is called three  I understand but then that club random, okay, we're not gonna get that saucy  But  Let's how let's let's get back into the realm of dry and talk about an old man who used to run the  Disney Jack, no, not Jack  Here we go an hour but now we're gaining steam where they were going down the roller coaster Jack Lindquist everyone's saying this was a  I always liked the vibe of this guy  This is like this seems like a nice old man who was the it wasn't always old I guess but he was part of Disneyland  From like just a few months in he was working for another company  And then he visited Disneyland while I was getting built and he said he fell in love with the place  So then somebody from Disney called him asking for somebody who's good at marketing and he said what about me?  And he was there just a few months later  And then that led to a career that ended in him being the president of Disneyland the first  President of Disneyland there was no such thing as this.
 He's like kind of like that winky old man  Does he do what I'm saying? Like he kind of has that little wink charm  Does it make sense? I need a little more context.
 Are you saying?  Winking or a wink Martindale? No, not wink Martindale.
 I'm saying like, you know kind of that like I'm an older man  Hey, how are you doing there slugger winking when you say that?  Yeah, wink mean he's a folksy kind of guy.
 There's nothing malicious about no.
 No, I think it's a pure  It's a way it's like a sparkle in his eye.
 He's like an old st.
 Nick like  He has a st.
 Nick  We're saying refresh my memory  When we did the Toontown episode was he the one at the ground break the older guy at the groundbreaking saying this is a very exciting  Endeavor yes.
 Yeah  You seem to think someone was weird about I think you didn't like him is what I remember  Oh, it was weird about that speech  I forget there was something about the speech that might have bumped for me and I but I don't remember what it was now  Mm-hmm.
 I think maybe it was  the like  Background guys the guys dressed as like costume construction guys and like  They were sweeping or they did his intro really weird.
 I don't know if it was him  I think so.
 I think that's right.
 He would have been open.
 He like is he still there, you know  They look like probably retired right before Indiana Jones open  But he was there when they started building it was pushing ties nerd  You got to do a second park and was still alive  To say and then that led to California adventure, which I didn't think was very good  Yeah, then he's been said but I liked the you know when then cars land and they figured it out  But he was still as there's a lot of the old Disney hands we're gonna run for a while.
 Yeah, sure  Yeah, he got out cut out on top.
 I feel like feeling period  He didn't like yes, unlike, you know people in the Senate.
 He enjoyed some retirement  He didn't just like well, yeah, like drive his brain into them into mush and oh, yeah better  Like what if I leave when I'm happy and everybody's happy to see me?  Your golden years like chewing down warm corner bakery salads like  What a way to go  This guy brought a lot of things to the park grad nights.
 He's attributed to having invented  Wait, did I not say this is Disney dollars are associated with him?  This is like we considered one of their things that he yeah, there was some brought some there was some I was a video  Which video does so but like this I've heard that the guy talked about that story about the silhouette painter  But also then like some people think it was just Jack who did it.
 It was Jack's idea  I really listen to the recall on or this part was intense on Mouse Planet where  The writer and his Jim Cork has said  He says he thought of it not the silhouette guy and this wouldn't this is not a man who I think would lie  He's a straight shooter and I take him at his work.
 So they're calling out maybe silhouette guys alive  So so I don't be a liar quirk is still he digs deep  I mean he seats has done a lot of Disney history stuff.
 He came up on the contemporary episode.
 Mm-hmm  Mm-hmm.
 So he might know I  If you looked him in the eye with Santa lie to you would old st.
 Nick tell you a fib  I don't think so.
 I don't know somebody who's winking all the time.
 That's fine.
 That's true  I'm waiting for me in a lot of things.
 I suppose not sure like oh, yeah, I invented did he Disney dollars wink  I  Guess that's a different right there all those winks.
 Yeah  He invent, you know, he did like any of those anniversaries the 30th and 35th where they're given cars away  That was all this doing they didn't really celebrate anniversaries.
 That was something that occurred to him  Why don't we we need little reasons to like that's such a funny thing that they didn't and that's the one guy thought of it  Yeah, now everybody does that every place every part excuse any yes.
 Yeah.
 Yeah feels like something  Alright, right.
 He even was like he said like people don't really celebrate 30th  Anniversaries and whatever who cares.
 Let's try it and we're great.
 All those were really fun.
 Yeah  Disney dollar anniversary anniversary Disney dollars specifically.
 Oh, that's right.
 It all tied together because he did  Yeah, here's a print for the 35th or for the 50th or whatever.
 Yeah  Another weird thing I found out about Jacqueline quest is from theme park insider  something that he was doing in the 70s was  spearheading the initiative to get different countries to participate in  World showcase to have a little pavilion version of the country in Epcot and  The interviewer asked what was your favorite thing you got to do as part of that and he said well  I'd have to be when I spent those five weeks in Iran.
 I  When I spent so much time with the Shah with the Shah of Iran  meaning Muhammad Reza who was the  The last Shah of Iran because when so Jacqueline quest is hanging out with him  And they're talking business about the little theme park that maybe they'll do and then a year later  He is deposed in this huge crazy  Revolution.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yeah.
 Yeah the shop famously a brutal man  famously brutal ruler installed by the  United States  intelligence agencies helping along  He I think are  Probably when jet when old Jack is talking to him about and then there'll be maybe a boat ride about the history of  Persia and the heat they had that ball ago interesting.
 I like that  Maybe I don't want to get wet.
 This is happening and he has like  50,000 prisoners of war like political prisoners  He's torturing also as in this year because it's okay.
 So all these meetings are a year with a year to go  Before he's  Exiled and then he dies a year later  Cancer is ravaging is by horrible horrible cancer is ravaging his body and he's still taking the time to like  Maybe a restaurant would you know, we're gonna have a Ben Franklin animatronic.
 You should see it sometime  His idea is kind of cross-boundary, you know borders and you know, it's styles of government  Everyone could learn a thing from mr.
 Franklin  It's called future worlds and you'll be able to see it  Yeah, okay.
 Well, what sorts of hats do you like here where I could see our way into putting Donald in one?  Sounds good.
 Hang on.
 I'm being called to the other room  Grenades who is this ayatollah character?  Jack  The ayatollah is asking for me one second  I have been putting off this call for weeks  Jack's just like sitting there like not paying attention.
 What's going on the back room?  You eating it like a Mickey ice cream bar and like just like smiling  Exit from  Iran was very much like Argo sort of situation, but it was more mr.
 McGooey  Yeah, I was just enjoying it's like I really come come to like rosewater and in food  For those usual sounds on the plane and it was like it's like the entire city is exploding behind.
 Yeah  Great big beautiful tomorrow.
 I love that song.
 Don't you? Yeah, then weeks later what happened in Iran?  I guess we won't be putting that in the ride.
 Oh good golly.
 I had no idea  That was the nicest looking hotel we had drawn up shame  You know that too.
 He's trying to figure out the Persian Hotel.
 Oh, yeah  Really weird so look Jack was was everywhere and coming up with great ideas and hanging with great people  And that kind of came he traveled so much and he said I was flying back from a trip to Europe  And I was going through my change and there's there's Franks and Deutschmarks and pounds and I thought you know some of these countries  We just visited they you know, we do more people per year than their population.
 So why can't we have a currency?  It is it is right it is funny it is also like we are  Very powerful and we should have our own money there is that's also part of it  I suppose it's that you could now it's this is the other if now shape back did it  Then like the the Santa's faction would all be so enraged  Oh, yeah, yeah as if this hadn't happened in the 80s.
 All right, right  This would be used as the sign of their out of their mind  Well, you know, they'll be saying, you know, this is the great reset Disney is gonna accelerate the great resets of the word New World Order and  That's what is the great reset  Believe it's like where you like everyone's currency goes to see I could I really actually don't know  but it's like a full reset of the like worldwide economy and and global politics and yes, it's sort of a I  Guess it's a fringe idea, but I wouldn't be shocked if it was like 15% of people in America are worried about it  Yeah, I mean there's also along the same lines.
 I bet some of the same there's some crossover with the people who  Do you guys know about the denar the Iraqi denar?  So this was this was a currency in Iraq  and  It essentially became worthless after Saddam, I think was deposed  and  Or maybe it's the current currency in Iraq.
 I forget very low exchange rate, but  People were buying it up in droves because they thought Donald Trump was going to  Go like one Iraqi denars now worth one US dollar so they would have stacks and stacks of denars.
 Oh  That would were worth people were doing this  Trump judge Trump people like the same people Americans are buying people who are complaining about the gold standard  Okay, and just tweeting at Donald Trump every day.
 Mr.
 Trump, please  RV I feel like they would say RV the denar and that was some term of like reset it  Reset and make it worthwhile  It's some of them may have been soldiers in Iraq and just got out with a lot of denars and they're like I know  They've got a lot of work.
 It's like Confederate money.
 It's worthless  Yeah, it says Donald Trump supporters think the president will make them rich if they buy Iraqi money.
 Yes, 2018  So, you know  So there's a couple yeah a couple things going on.
 So yeah, if Disney all of a sudden today did their own currency  Yeah, they would think that they were like this is part of it.
 This is book and speed.
 Yeah  This is money for pedophiles only or something.
 This is pedophile money that if we don't have the you need the right kind of  Blacklight you bright you get through if you get a lot like you have to switch it between  Three different types of black light really fast and then you'll see like the secret symbols  Right the American dollar and the American dollar will be worthless in five years  But the the money with Mickey will be that will be the one that will be the world currency in five to ten years  It's a Disney dollars.
 So we'll have to go to their parks and yeah learn their agenda.
 Yeah, they're fascist pedophile agenda, right?  Yes, that's right.
 It's both of those things.
 Yep.
 Same time.
 So yeah  Yeah, it would be interesting if they try if they did it  They bring it back because people yeah people will go nuts  But I honestly the stuff we're saying there will be article people will be Alex Jones will be saying the things we're saying about  Disney dollars.
 Yeah, that's not crazy  That will go on  The the way that Disney dollars arrived on scene  There is some like odd kind of real-world intensity  To it.
 Yeah, anybody see the video Scrooge maybe  Yes, because this is important the Disney dollars are signed by the treasurer Scrooge McDuck.
 Yes, that's so everyone  No matter what character is on it.
 Scrooge McDuck is considered the official Disney.
 Yes  And so and Tinkerbell usually is on the front  Uh-huh kind of like, you know symbols their symbols on our US dollars Tinkerbell is the symbol  If Mickey even Mickey's not on it  There's some sort of character or landmark on it and there's a Scrooge McDuck signature, which is pretty funny  That's a pretty good detail.
 Yeah.
 Yeah, I do like that  And not only that but on this particular day on the launch in May 1987  He showed up in person  In duck to make the first handoff  Earlier today an armored truck arrived  Scrooge McDuck McDuck is the Disney dollar treasurer and after he made the drop-off  The Magic Kingdom money became available to every Disneyland guest  including Tom DeArcey who came to Disneyland all the way from Pennsylvania to buy over  $2,000 worth of Disney dollars  This guy's getting huge stack  But the point that why I wanted to show that and I'll post that somewhere is that that it's a that an armature that a Brinks  Truck arrives pulls up into the end of the hub or not the whole whatever the plaza  Scrooge McDuck gets out has a big sack and just kind of smacks it onto a ticket counter  really aggressively and follows that up with just kind of like a smack of the just pounds the  Really like aggro a real aggro move from this old duck.
 Yes.
 It's very  Violent I love any especially funny because he's four feet tall.
 He's very barely gets above that counter  And he's a giant old duck.
 Yes  And then there's a man who appears to have backpacks from Pennsylvania like that's a hiking backpack  Yeah, he's got a he's got a funny vibe.
 Yeah, he looks like when Mark Parosh was the yo-yo guy  Talking about yes for any old backpack.
 Yeah  stack of  Two grants somebody I think bought  Ten grand the first day some people were saying this is my kids college fun  This is like there were there were high you know for what which you never I don't know  Maybe if they held out and are these the people who were making these eBay transactions or these  Our financial ladder I forget the name forgetting all the specifics if you can imagine I would yeah  I would love to hear their plan at the time because obviously like I  When you go to the airport or when you fly overseas, there's always you know conversion rates between currencies between so like were they hoping?  That that would have what something would happen.
 We're like Disney dollars would decouple from the US dollar  Like what was their long-term plan here for this being?  What's the man in that like the dollar would have to weaken?  Yeah, the Disney dollar is so strong right then you just you say you can live like a king, right?  But I don't think in America.
 It's possible.
 I don't think that's possible unless  Disney was using Disney dollars for everything they were doing they were paying the government and Disney dot like yeah  You would have to be yes all of their money would have to be and you couldn't like cuz you all the exchanges happen in  Disneyland or Disney Disney stores so you would have to  Like they you have to be like the cashier is like crying or don't make me hand you this cat  We can't afford this.
 Yeah, so we're just we're hemorrhaging money if uh, uh, yeah  Cuz I would know to go back to the crypto Disney dollars when they were printing them  I think were pegged to the that's the phrase pegged to the US dollar  So if the US dollar appreciated or depreciated Disney dollars would go up or down  So I think the only time that they would have ever  Gained value would be now when they were years ago when they stopped printing them when it's speculators when now space  Are selling them on the secondary market?  Right and it's mostly for kitschy weirdos who want to do that.
 I guess but  Money isn't real anyway  So you're saying not just not since they got rid of the gold standard.
 That's a good gold standard.
 That's right  Well, so I don't know how it worked out for the ten grand  I don't see they they they made more than two million dollars worth in the in the first round  The the first run the first run of it was it was a guy who just bought  $75 worth a  Buena Park hairdresser and he left with and Mickey came out and shook his hand and I mean that makes it work  He's and he got a plaque and the first Disney dollar was  Embedded in it.
 So I think he won because he spent less money  It's not like they gave the plaque to the ten grand guy spent 75 bucks and he got to meet Mickey and get a plaque  That's pretty good.
 Yeah, it's pretty good.
 I I'm realizing a flaw as we talked about  Change that if you have a $10 Disney dollar and you bought a $5 toy  Or let's say a five  That cost five dollars and sixty cents with tax  You are getting coins back  Yeah, American currency are getting probably American regular currency.
 I guess you could get four Disney dollars and forty cents  That's probably if you wanted it, they probably give you the option  Depending on if they had the the change  This is something that occurred to me as a weakness in this whole thing.
 This is fun  We got ones and fives and then tens and twenties.
 Where are the coins?  Where the Disney we like our tokens we we liked the coin from  Zalem from a lead of battle.
 Oh, yeah.
 Remember the coin from Zalem.
 Yeah  I still have my coin yet.
 It's worth the money.
 Yes  I probably had anybody with 80 bucks.
 I think she's really at least a year or two ago  Who's the kings of silly money now?  It should have been coins though, obviously like well and I maybe this is this might be worth a little thought  If these are just equivalent is it penny nickel?  dime well, so  Here's what I was they supposedly they were floating the idea of doing three dollar bills and seven dollar bills initially  Yes, I love that.
 That's so funny.
 It's so funny and they should have done it because well why though because of  character yeah little pigs  Seven chores Wow, right.
 Yes, so but if you start  That I think that's so fun that it's these insane amounts, but I started going like, okay if I alright  I'm gonna exchange I have $60 and I want  Sevens how?  Like you're in the you're in a theme park in the heat.
 You're trying to divide seven into  60 or whatever it is.
 Uh-huh.
 That's a brain breaker  Yeah, it's not it's not as that the five C ones fives and tens simple it's very simple easier to yes even numbers  I think that being said  Everybody has to learn a little advanced math for the sake of fun  Yeah, you know, that's your belief in Jenna.
 That's because that's why you like  Everything that Disney World is instituted because it requires advanced math  To get on a ride.
 Well, yeah, I don't like the thing that's been happening apparently where you have to what is it?  Like stay up till midnight and then get up at six o'clock  To like complete like whatever the reservations you need the next day.
 Whatever it is  Has it gotten worse? What are you talking about?  You're now locked into you have to stay up insanely late and get up insanely early  I pray if you want to get like your full like to get to be able to like get the fastpass or to get the  The genie plus what's the midnight? What do you get it?  I'm trying to remember there is some if you want to get I should look it up  But it's like look it up because when I was down there it was just setting my alarm for like  655 to just constantly refresh an app first off get off the Wi-Fi to refresh an app  It's so funny because that I'm like I must be crazy, right? It can't still be this bad and then trying it  I'm like, okay the Wi-Fi still this bad and all of the blogs of like how to do this thing get off any Wi-Fi  Use why do not be on Disney Wi-Fi, but do be on the app.
 Yeah, do keep refreshing  This is madness.
 How have we ended up here and that it's just like, okay, there's a new ride if you think okay  I'll just wait for it.
 Not an option fuck off  Buy it or you had to be really good at refreshing our notoriously bad software apps  It's just I saw somebody  Saying like I don't know if I agree with Scott and reheam that he's recently saying how Universal's winning the war and I don't  Know if that's across the board, you know  Universal Hollywood has its issues and lacks of magic here and there despite having the definitive greatest ride in the world  but I'm more mean the like  For I cannot wait to stay at Universal Orlando  Next time there is a Florida trip and not deal with any of this fucking horse shit.
 This is insane  What are you taught every new detail that gets added is crazier and crazy  So it looks even so relaxing and there's so many rides, you know, I got to do any of this and universal  Yes, okay.
 Here's what it is  So at midnight is when you can then purchase the genie plus for the next day, but you cannot start reserving  Reservations until 7 a.
m.
 So you're if you want to do it all you're at you're fucked because  You have to sleep for six hours on your vacation  So wait, so can you you can't buy individual lightning lights at midnight you say you are buying Disney plus for the park  Jeannie plus yes, so it's like 1201 or whenever it rolls or 12 o'clock you that's when Jeannie plus and Jeannie plus does run out  Apparently, okay.
 That's why you have to do it at midnight  Oh god, but you can't make your first reservation of the day until well, but it is it's hotel guests  I think it's seven and regular guests at night something like that  That's why it's like they're forcing you to like get six hours of sleep or seven hours of sleep  Which is just a very bad system on a vacation on your  I mean you're in a hotel and now you have to yeah  Get up early and ostensibly you have entered this property past giant sign some of which I know they're deconstructing and rebuilding  That say the word resort on them  Which I have mentioned this before that does have certain  Connotations to it what that dude's gonna be pleasure  Relaxation I don't forget that some of the hotels take like an hour to get to  Via complicated transportation means so let's add that to it as well, right?  Yeah, but again the math of universal it's like, okay, we got three hotels that are more expensive granted, but  You could just show your room key at the park and walk on any ride basically.
 Yes  Yeah, it's working if it's working a lot and a lot of the rides have been so good lately  Yes, like the best so  Yeah, yeah, and you might not be able to do that at the brand new rides  You'll just have to wait in line, but then it's equal.
 It's an equalizer.
 Everyone just has to wait in line.
 Mm-hmm.
 You know, yeah  Insane  Here's one thing that universal didn't do  Better is the money I didn't know until today that there was a time when they tried  It starts it starts off bad Disney dollars.
 Oh neat alliteration  Universal dollars does those don't you didn't do anything there.
 You try to make that fun in any way  I don't know what you call them  Yeah bucks.
 Well bucks.
 Yeah, it's dollars or bucks, right? You're only the two options  Well, I got one now.
 I got one for modern minion money  No, that's great  It's all the difference Bob and right right right.
 Oh, that's great.
 Yeah, that is good  Yeah, although I get maybe you need more distinctly different characters  too because you'd be confused by you'd have to branch out to the girls and grew and  That would help.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah, I need grew to be okay.
 Okay, but minion money is very good.
 Yeah, minion money is good  Yeah, but this was there was McDonald land bucks  You know there was a lot there were a lot of places doing stuff similar to this yeah, yeah  This definitely existed out there  I think Disney did it the best with the like high quality of printing and that it was really committed to the Universal ones seem  Just like yeah coupons essentially.
 That's what McDonald no recollection.
 I didn't need I've been the idea zero  This was like early 2000s.
 It seems like other parks didn't start doing this still a little bit later  Can anyone guess a character who was on the Universal money in the early 2000s  Let's think about their well of IP.
 That's some of the other it's like Mickey and Donald and goofy and then a universal you got  Woody woodpecker.
 Yes, what he would put Woody woodpecker is their Mickey  That's their one.
 I guess a lot of ways we find that Woody woodpecker is their Mickey  Can you really say universal is winning in general when that is what's happened a character who who's only  Presence in the last 60 years has been an unpleasant straight to Netflix movie  Well, I I did watch that video series  Recently and it did shock me that Woody woodpecker's kid zone  Was a late 90s edition because that's when they're like, this is our guy.
 This is gonna be our Mickey Mouse  There were probably yeah, there must have been big animated movie plans that build on when would epic universe  When will the Woody woodpecker mega land to be built? That's my question  Is that in the first four or we have to wait for the expansion for that?  He's were will find a world to his birdhouse  Detail do people this people we met do people like Woody woodpecker that much  No, have you ever met anyone? No, not when chilly Willie is on the table  I do like chilly Willie.
 I don't agree with that.
 But I was never like a kid is  Like yeah, Woody woodpecker.
 He's annoying.
 Yeah, he's awful  But yeah, does anyone like him out there somebody go? Oh, yeah, that's that was my favorite character as a kid say what you haven't seen  You haven't seen the other good Woody woodpecker novels that were written in 1951  Okay on the inside universal  Message board someone says I still have my mummy returns five dollar universal  That's pretty good like rotting mummy.
 Yeah, is there an islands of adventure currency?  Like is there anything that has like the the light tower or anything? It's all general resort.
 I believe  Which they like I they don't even own that no  Using to zone by Warner Brothers.
 You don't even think of scooby-doo being in the parks  You know what I  Mickey and boop is there any mini and maybe the answer for them is teaming up with a half interest in these two characters  Maybe nobody really cares about boop.
 People really care about woody people care about boop  I'm not sure why exactly but people fucking go nuts for boop.
 The people do love boop $10 $10 Spider-Man bill  Oh, that's pretty good.
 You should get that.
 Yeah, you should buy that but boop.
 Yeah, we should do a full boop  Episode cuz I honestly I don't I don't know a lot about but I don't know anything about boop  I don't know why but she's around super popular still to this day and I'm always shocked at how popular it's a license like any  if you if you would go to like a souvenir shop or like  Like a mall like go to the Grove  Go to the Grove and go to one of those like just kind of souvenir shops and boop is everywhere every way  Yeah, and but especially like towns that have like  Small malls and then there's just a store selling Elvis and I love Lucy lunchboxes  You're gonna get some boop there.
 Yeah, she's every she's everywhere and it's for some reason still selling  I think if you watch the Charles Fleischer cartoons, they're weird.
 I have  Great, but I was so strange.
 We should what we should do some boop.
 Yeah, we'll do it.
 Let's try to figure out why I mean  There's a why and a lot.
 Yeah, almost all the universal main states  We got a kind of an angle why we should do Woody too, but I'm less interested in that.
 Yeah, that sounds annoying  It sounds we don't have to do it.
 Yeah, do it don't don't  Don't tell us they're on  Woody when Garfield eats the main thing we know about Woody is the ha ha ha ha ha ha like the noise the noise  Yeah, of course would I don't think I was about to say people willingly watch this I don't think they did I think was a short  Before other stuff they're probably like god dammit of all the characters  I'm gonna go to try to force some pee out and I hope that this cartoon is over before the movie  I came here to see I mean I kind of like I think the the walk around costume solid like walk around Woody  That was kind of without his personality.
 It's fine.
 Yeah  Visually, yeah  but as far as  I'm trying to think if there's a cartoon that I like less that I watched as a kid or just like again  Woody was like on and I would see it and I wouldn't have said like oh I hate this but I'm trying to think  Of anything that I thought like found more unpleasant  Boop bucks if they called them boop box is good.
 Sure.
 That's true  But then you're a little then you're limited and like so that's so wait what it's but it's I can spend this anywhere  I could but yeah, it's boop bucks.
 What about Lucille ball and calm ball bucks ball bucks pretty good  Ten dollar.
 Yeah mummy returns for ten dollars  Jurassic Park gets ten and ten note.
 Yeah dinosaur burst and dinosaur that's  That's what I thought I had a dollar bill.
 I thought that was normal and then a tiny t-rex  ripped through the paper  Jurassic points that doesn't sound as good.
 No  That's I'm trying to think.
 Yeah, I don't know  Fred Mertz money  Ethel Mertz money.
 No, they don't have Fred and Ethel in the parks, which I've written written letters about but  They still haven't they haven't done there are no yeah, there is no Fred Mertz no walk around Fred Mertz  No walk around like you with a cane  JK Simmons  Oh, is it Mertz or is it the JK Simmons Mertz? Well, it's Frawley.
 He's Frawley.
 He's Frawley  They can all they can both coexist.
 I guess that's all is a different Captain America's right different  Yeah, the people are gonna want to see both  Encourages you to stick around all day, of course  Anyway, they they messed up that's not good  But you know what is good and and I'm gonna go ahead and say well  No, I don't want to say did you guys run into the other theme park that did this that had money?  No, I don't think I did Dolly dollars  All right, that's pretty Hollywood  I don't mean to shit on the topic that we're doing and that was chosen for us  But Dolly dollars are better.
 Look at these  Glamorous person who has ever been on money.
 Look at all the the gold and the frills  Look at the beautiful like it's her it's her on the front.
 You get to see every type of wig and every area  Oh, yeah, oh my god treasurer Dolly Parton.
 She's all of it  There's only one character at Dollywood  So she just has to be everything and then here's a count country fair on the back and here's Dollywood  Boulevard and oh it just gets me guy  We got to figure out how to get down there that'll really be the great colors great colors  So they're so vibrant the hair is better in each one than the previous  Each wig better than the last.
 Yes.
 Yeah  These these are joy.
 I don't know if they're still doing these good question.
 Yeah wonder  Yeah, Dollywood rules  why in the Disney has to  Desperately invent all of these these lame excuses for characters when Dollywood had it is just they retired at one  There's a 2010 Dolly dollar  So yeah, they're recently at least  Huh? Yeah.
 Wow, these are years like decades of them at least these Universal Studios dollars are going for a lot on eBay  So these are we maybe we're the fools.
 Maybe these are all doing great  I mean, this was a great thing to invest in and we all messed up or wait a minute  We were children our parents messed up  That's their parents should have been like these people there on the first day when Scrooge pounded his money bag into the onto the counter  My boy, I'm gonna next time I see my parents.
 I'm gonna say why didn't you spend ten thousand dollars on Disney dollars in?  1987 yeah, I could have a life then I went to the I gotta say though  I went to Universal Studios a good amount in the early  2000s and I have only the famous recollection not even of doll of these images  No, these aren't for this didn't take at all.
 Yeah, usually there was always standee signs of like  Your photos get all your photos in one place or like there was always the  Fucking internet cap like print out all your photos of the day on a CD and take that home with you  Universal's just getting around to some of the good ideas that Disney did 30 years ago as much as Merch is concerned and obviously back then  Anything that we're gonna do is half-assed by and large  So that means in 30 years Universal Orlando is gonna be perfect super  Unpleasant complicated.
 No, I'm so they're gonna be the whole thing.
 They're gonna figure out a way like alright  So you go to bed at 2 15 wake up at 2 30 we're doing it prison style and we make you do it  We start banging on the doors get up get up  Do you want to go on men and black alien attack or not? Uh-huh.
 Yes, they'll catch up then  I feel like I did see like there's a survey going around among annual pass holders  Would you like to reserve the day you're coming to Universal and everyone's like fuck you? No  Good yeah off  There is the rumor is that there's an original  Universal Hollywood horror Halloween horror nights maze called prison this year  Yeah, yeah once that's also the weekend is getting his own maze.
 I'm so excited about this  Weekend music blasting loud in a horror maze.
 This is awesome.
 I'm so excited  I'm sure they're in the liner notes or something.
 There's an explanation with the bandage gimmick.
 I've no idea what it is  See in the maze.
 Yeah, we'll learn you said you're going to this year.
 I mean, we'll see we'll see wait a minute  I don't sound like doing it  Wait, what is this? What are the quote? What are the what are you gonna decide? You know what this time?  We cannot make that judgment  We're talking by the way here we're about a month out from haunt season, so you're gonna decide quickly  Oh, yeah, because that you have to reserve in advance  This is the opening day the opening day of of Hollywood Halloween horror nights here is the 8th of September  Hmm or the 6th you got to be sure but you got to make these decisions  I'm gonna make mine right now.
 Am I gonna go? No, it's easy done.
 You never promised that you never you never  Simple but frightfest maybe  I hated six flags in the regular day so much  Oh  Or not.
 If you want to go to nuts, we'll go to nuts.
 Not nuts is the best one  Not says the coolest seemingly but hornets awesome to most passionate.
 Yes, you got you got a variety  I've said this before but you get you get those teams.
 You're right.
 You've got a lot of been locked down  There's a lot of sliders at knots though.
 So you don't like those  Can we just talk about  Disney dollars we came across that we liked that's a good get out of here  I gotta say I do appreciate I think this was a pretty canny move  They made a $50 note.
 There was only two thousand of them made and they only sold them on one day  1955 you can see 1955 to  2005  50th anniversary of Disneyland.
 Okay, I think that's pretty smart.
 Mm-hmm thinking  Yeah, is that like when you when we're saying this these are the ones we would have wanted if we were into this  Like what what struck your yeah, like here's a $5 with goofy on the front  And I think it's the Liberty Bell riverboat on the back  Yeah, I used this I looked at the serial number and saw it was for Disney World  So I don't think it's the Mark Twain use the Shazam that you have for river boats  Look the first angel investors seed money is not coming in  There is not interest in don't need this apparently.
 Mm-hmm.
 Yeah, there's a lot of good  There's like them.
 There's the space Mountain one.
 That's that's on one of the first  Images there was a little run towards the end looks like 2014.
 There was the Mountain series  Yeah, where it's the the ride on the front and Mickey riding it on the bat, those are pretty sharp  I think by the way the style of all of these I mean my favorite is just the classic  basic Mickey wave in and it's a really  picturesque castle as is the the Liberty Bell the steamboat on the back I  the riverboat rather on the back the  I don't know.
 I the basic style of them stayed pretty great  Yeah, goofy the goofy $5 bill is funny because he's like snooty.
 He's like got his nose turned up  Which is not a choice.
 Yeah, not how Mickey and Minnie are they're like their normal happy selves  But goofy looks like he's like full of me stuck up or something.
 Yeah, here's a mixy Mickey 60th  65th  birthday  It's a Disneyland one because it's got the a and here's his house and the weird car.
 Mmm, the weird car.
 Yeah  Bulbas car with eyes the cars alive.
 We don't know its name.
 Mm-hmm.
 It's uh, what there's so many  There's like big.
 Yeah, you were saying there's the other rides.
 There's big thunder and yeah  That's a very Fleischer studios thing like an inanimate object with eyes and it's a lot like I feel like every guy  Mickey's on the ride in these he's not it's not like a ride car with eyes that I'm looking at.
 Yes  Yeah, this face man one.
 He's just in the space mountain  But yeah, there's so many there were some opening California adventure  Ones which I don't always love that DCA 1.
0 aesthetic, but I kind of like it  Mixed with the stately aesthetic of currency like here's I do really like Mickey  Climbing the the mountain like like with the bear mountain behind with grizzly peak behind him  Seeing that bright yellow kind of annoying original logo  On a dollar bill I sort of like well, there's the Disneyland.
 Oh, no, sorry.
 It's just a regular resort  But I was gonna say these are I guess from around the same time, but it's got Mickey and Minnie with sunglasses on  Yeah, like tourists.
 Yeah vacationing Mickey and Minnie, but it is the Disney.
 Sorry.
 It's a Disneyland resort, but it's got the bear  It's the it's the castle and then the bear.
 Yeah, so obviously California venture was there at that point  Is the bear still are they still pushing the bear?  Is the we were all we talked about on the grizzly river rapids we were all kind of confused about the  Years, yeah, which is great.
 I really think it's cool, but we all didn't quite know what it was  Yeah, we had questions icon if you grew up out here and you're looking at the state flag with the cool bear on it  Maybe you'd make the can I'm a you're more thing about? Yeah, that's true  But it is yeah, there's just so many Disney dollars that they made  Well, you got a Pirates of the Caribbean one and maybe here's a quick  souvenir smackdown  What do you think is the top?  This is the on stranger tides bill a one dollar on stranger tides bill  It's got the skull keep in mind.
 It's got the skull and  Swords and then the ship the black pearl the black would not cherish this want this  What do you think the top version is going for on eBay and these have not sold yet  This is the what somebody's trying to get somebody's trying to get I know if they're more rare  And this is like a you know tie-in to a movie.
 So there probably was not as many made.
 It's just  Regular Mickey or regular goofy.
 Mm-hmm.
 So that might put it in more rare.
 So  I like I said, I think the millennial one with the Millennium logo and the Epcot  You know the wand and the 2000 that was going for 30 with an envelope  I'm gonna say like 75 for this one.
 Mm-hmm to 50  Again, this is the top right the most  Okay  $10,000.
 Okay.
 Okay most expensive  That somebody thinks they could get he's saying what was yours to 50 and 10,000  You're saying 10,000 now I am yeah cuz he said that's the that's the highest one somebody's trying to ask somebody's asking for  I'm gonna go lower.
 I'll say 1000  somebody's trying to get  $500,000 for  Stranger Tide go to sold and or click on sold and completed on the left and see what it is selling for  On the left you should see if you scroll it should do you mean like if somebody  That'll show you what the recent stuff is sold for basically  Okay, if you see sold I'd have sold or completed and then it'll show you what's what the actual total people  I'm not as eBay if I'm not seeing that on here  Disney doll see if my before my phone dies here.
 I'll look for it strange.
 Did you look up stranger tides Disney dollars?  I think I think it's just Disney dollars and most expensive.
 I see Disney  I'm gonna look up stranger tides and they have an IC the listing you're talking about for five hundred thousand dollars  And completed sold let's see here in edge keep it's the user elite coin one Disney dollar  Has sold with the logo for 1499  before that  One  Let's see.
 Was there something spot? Yeah, it doesn't it seems like all these are like 50 or lower  This is you try to find the biggest rube paper money guarantee.
 It looks like it's been assessed  It looks like it's it says exceptional paper quality  So they're there.
 Yeah, that's gonna get you up into the 300 thousand dollars produced.
 They are out of production, but still accepted  Elite coinage company is proud to offer the largest selection of certified Disney dollars  Yes, because there's graded and ungraded Disney dollars  This is like comic books in the sense that certain comic books are more once they've been graded by the official  I forget the company that does it that grades them.
 So if you have an action comics, that's like a  9.
2 that's gonna be a lot more money than action comics  4.
9.
 Yeah, you slab it you put in a giant plastic case so no one can touch it  Okay, and those are worth more just like the guys have here the two most reputable  reputable Disney dollar grading companies in the world are  PMG and legacy grading previously known as PC GS  So if you got some Disney dollars and you want to get a grade it you got to give it to one of these companies  I'm sure the people at Bank Note world or billion shark a bullion sharks  But keep it keep in mind that PN PNC and the I don't know what you said  Well, they've changed names, but I mean the quality the quality work is still there  I just want to know where a philatist goes to get their stamps assessed.
 I  Mean there's all again.
 These are whole other worlds  I know we have just we haven't even cracked the book on we're just seeing the cover  Burgeoning philatist and I'm wondering should I be putting my stamps in a new miss?  Yeah, I guess great question, thank you for coming to the seminar you'd be tough to go wrong with the new miss  You know, it's a great starting.
 I use them quite a bit.
 They're very standard, you know  I oh wait one more that the let the bill  The I as I was saying I find a lot of these aesthetically pleasant and I miss seeing them out in the wild  It's only one there's only one that where they fucked up and it's this an area where they fucked up putting this anywhere  Chicken little get the fuck out and I hate you chicken little  Look bad at this movie.
 Am I being harsh?  This movie looks like shit everything they ever put up in the parks that big balloon that looked like shit chicken little you met Disney  You fucked up over and over again.
 I get it.
 I keep swearing chicken little makes me angry  You've seen a little character.
 No, I've never seen it.
 Oh well now folks the sky is falling I guess  What am I am I gonna watch it and fall in love with with little you know?  All that stuff it's so much weight is on dizzy plus now and I got a I've been meaning to watch bolt chicken  Little brother bear home on the range like I just there is a to you want to I'm just so curious  I want you I want you to watch it  The only thing the thing I like about chicken little is that there is an original bare naked lady song on the soundtrack  Okay, called one little slip.
 I've never seen the movie  Mm-hmm, but the song is like kind of a ripoff of it's all been done  They kind of like did the same they just maybe turned in a demo  I think the Disney were like give us a new it's all been done and they did  Yeah, it's like Mickey Mouse Minnie Mouse for sparks.
 They're like, yeah, we'll just fuck it.
 Hey, no get out of here  That one those are both great.
 I just mean the thought process we tied the band  Cynically thought of but they still have a good thing.
 No, it's got a web address.
 It says summer 2005 on it  www.
disney.
com slash chicken little hit your web address out of here  I don't am I wrong everyone that bit there was a big inflatable chicken little thing somewhere  A couple of right there was a dog in the pole big chicken little hitting the pole change my mind  I'm sure you little chicken have the new have like everything now the cycles of nostalgia  Are happened so quickly has the chicken little nostalgia come yet online.
 Have we seen it?  I think we're gonna find out and either it'll be one person or it'll be  Definite.
 Yeah, I don't know.
 We're in where am I one little slip fans at the bare naked ladies song  Maybe they remember it for that reason too  I don't know.
 Well Zach Braff's the main voice.
 I see her to guess that this movie will change my life.
 I swear  I think that's fair.
 Yeah  so  Besides the chicken little buck besides the  Flawless except for chicken little in your eyes.
 Yeah, otherwise they did great idle.
 These are nice  I think maybe they could do it again  You know, what's interesting is that these were they stopped making them Disney dollars died just a few months after their creator  Jack Lindquist died and  Mouse planet said it was nice that the father of Disney dollars died before he saw his creation eliminated  Was it? Yeah, that's I'm like  if I invented some fake money and  I could get six more months on this earth, but I had to learn that they stopped making my fake money  I think I'd vote for the the more time months.
 Yeah, I think that's right on store  Yeah, I think that's right.
 I mean who knows maybe that was like every morning Jack would go like my is my money still around  And they go yes, Jack.
 I'm already so maybe it was important to him.
 Maybe I'm crazy  You need to go.
 Okay, and he give you the wink and then he'd go down about his day  But I don't know any winked his final wink right and there or did he did he up to heaven?  Did he find out like there was like oh, yeah, they're thinking about getting rid of the dollars and goes  Oh, no, and that was it and when your wife dies and then you go, right? It's like  Padme a Queen Amidala dies of the broken heart at the end of Revenge of the Sith  She couldn't go on because of what happened Anakin they could now do  Star Wars money and that's you know, that's great.
 They have all that like they you're supposed to do that double speak in the gift shops  And yet they don't they don't have is you're walking around with Star Wars money  Well, they did though they and I they have the gift certificate  There was a little piece of metal a gift certificate like opening day or the first couple months you could have bought  That was like worth I forget if it was a specific  Denomination or if it was you could just add it like I think you had to add a yeah  I don't know it almost bring this back kind of yeah  But there wasn't a full like system like credits and you couldn't play the Lando card game or anything  You could flip one of those bad boys on eBay easy, right? Oh, yeah, those are sold out those are sold out quickly  I believe at least I don't know forks.
 I don't you write the for the spork things were selling they don't do those anymore  But yeah, they should have done a full credit system.
 They should have gone all the way  That would have been awesome and confusing and  Extremely quickly.
 All right, never mind  And they shouldn't bring it back cuz everyone will be think it's a conspiracy and that's true resetting there  Okay, so you know what? Does he actually does he know is perfect.
 It happened and it's gone dad dad trying to use Star Wars credits  To buy overnight oats and he's mad because it's cold.
 He's like when is opium cold  look  digital Disney dollars  Mm-hmm crypto Disney dollars and if Disney dollars have they gotten into that that game?  Yeah, no, but don't view you're crazy.
 I don't think there are people right now working on it  I believe Marvel had some truly atrocious golden  Things.
 Oh NFTs you mean or yeah.
 No there everyone's figuring it out  I just tried to do like hey, it's an NFT of amazing fantasy 15 and it's like come on man  That's like free on it.
 Come on.
 Well, that's a whole thing.
 Yeah, but but Disney I would be I would I would bet they're investigating  Yeah, I mean probably this digital Disney dollars at the very least with the metaverse  Wasn't that a thing that well I Iger's on his own track with that  But I feel like before he fully left Disney's like gotta look into the metaverse.
 Iger is looking into the metaverse  He invested in Funko  He's done a lot John Stewart is try to get him to start his own news network  There's a lot going on with mr.
 Iger  Yeah, metaverse metaverse possible.
 I mean there's  it'll be it'll be interesting to see what they try on all these avenues because I feel like they're  Traditionally kind of a conservative company and they will get into it later  There's a question.
 Let's go back to this crypto point.
 Yeah, if you had ten thousand dollars  Do you put it into Bitcoin or do you put it into?  I  Guess now Disney chicken little bucks.
 Do you buy nothing?  Do you buy as many chicken little bucks as you can for ten thousand dollars? Yeah, why not today now?  Okay.
 Yes, what I would say to that.
 Uh-huh.
 I would say  The probably Bitcoin is the answer but I would say look into  How many chicken little bucks were made? Okay, that's what to figure out how scarce chicken little bucks are  I think it's probably not so desirable because of the property is not so desirable property is not desirable  But the rare ones either like certainly the misprinted ones are very  Expensive, but I think like the shorter run smaller run  Disney dollars are the ones that really sell yes exactly.
 So  It depends it depends what what they're going for  Well some money they are in the range of  $500 so that's how much they've accrued in what 17 years  So by that logic if it goes from one if these trends continue  We could we could probably do a full.
 Okay, I see a pre-owned it looks kind of dirty this Disney dollar this chicken little Disney dollar  $15 I think it's a buy it now.
 It's probably more I do it  And then you can best offer it because you can wash currency there there are well, yeah  You get another business and you wash it that way.
 No, I mean like  Okay, yes, I think you can wash currency.
 Yeah, I do wonder yes was their money laundering done with Disney dollars  Well, did they how did anyone get that did a stripper get tipped with Disney dollars?  This is a question I had to is anyone ever made in Orlando.
 Of course they did.
 Did people make I'm living  I'm on vacation.
 I'm on top of the world.
 Yes, I'm making it rain Goofy's there's no doubt it happened  It didn't happen.
 Did anyone do the you know Snow White?  Railroad  Okay, with it, yeah, Michael Eisner did  Let's be honest  Think about it.
 Just think we have money now.
 I see.
 All right  I'll be right back.
 I'm gonna this Walt's laughing place office still preserved.
 I'll be right back  What are you talking about  I want to get out of skates right now.
 I'm playing you and hockey.
 Let's get on the roof  What if Mickey me you a bad club sandwich?  I just saw clerks one.
 I want to play a roller hockey on the roof  We're making a school and we're making a movie of the character  Well, I think we just solved something we never put together Disney made their own money in the 80s right then my class  Craziest spree.
 All right, we figured it out  Even though we're on to you, please still come on the show  Yeah  Wolf of Wall Street cut the Disney dollar scene number one question  If we ever talked to Bob Gurran here is did you do cocaine the Disney dollar?  He's cool Roley has talked about doing psychedelics  So there if one guy did a mushroom then for sure the CEO of the Disney Company did a talk with  Yes.
 Yes.
 No question.
 Yes.
 So  Now we figured all that out you survived podcast the red club three your bravery saved the podcast.
 Well done freedom fighters and  You know, I guess let us know what you want to happen next month  Extravaganza  Nor the other coverage.
 You're the other proof.
 I'm not that cuff first cough cough the brush you pop
