 Forever.  Dog.  Warning, the following podcasts may contain middle-aged ghosts, tedious boat lines, askew elevators, and a themed hotel that started with an intricate story that had to be experienced throughout three attractions in sequential order, but now is just a place where people do e-sports and carrot top does prop comedy.  It's the Luxor on Podcast the Ride, Sin City Nights.  Welcome to Podcast the Ride, Sin City Nights, the sleazy desert cousin of Podcast the Ride, much like Snoopy's cousin Spike. I'm Scott Gertner, joined by Jason Sheridan.  That's right, we're like Spike. We grew those long mustache danglies.  Yeah, those very concerted, we all grew eight hairs, eight thick hairs out of our face, that's all we can do, Mike Carlson.  I'm here and I've also grown those long mustache danglies, says Jason, it's not just a long mustache, they're mustache danglies, in case you don't know.  It's a desert term, is what it is. Yeah. You'd know if you were sleezing around in the desert, says we have been.  Well that's what Spike is, he's a desert guy. You know? Yes. Yeah. That's what I said, but yes. Yeah.  I'm agreeing with you. Now this I was checking the levels, so to be fair, I wasn't zoned out, I had things to do.  I came in with show energy. I had things to do, I'm sorry.  For sure, no, your ability to focus for the most part, given that you're riding the levels, is admirable.  Listen, I'm going to dive right in with something that is not Vegas related, and I don't want it to take over the episode, and I fear that it may open Pandora's box.  All right. But I feel like I got to say it because it is part of the series, even though it's not Vegas related.  And it is this, if you can imagine, I've been doing some further thinking about Space Mountain fans.  This came up in the MGM Grand episode two weeks ago. There was a little discussion of disagreement.  You might say a loss on my part, that was how I chalked it up in the episode.  The notion came up of whether Space Mountain speed is partially simulated due to the fans, due to fans that are potentially blown on you, that blow cold air as if to simulate space travel or something that a faster roller coaster might do.  Right. This was something that Jason brought up. I balked at this notion.  Mike went a Googling and you discovered enough results that made me feel in that moment as if perhaps though I balked, it seemed like, well, that's enough people who have maybe brought up the idea that the speed of Space Mountain is simulated with cold air fans.  I didn't like taking the loss. It didn't feel good to me. I kept thinking about it.  It seems like you didn't stop there.  No, no. If you can imagine, it seems like the best thing to do in the moment was just to admit defeat.  But I've realized that the best thing to do for the podcast in general is to rip this thread wide open again.  Hey, in Vegas, you got to double down, you know.  Yeah, I wonder if I already did. I think this might be a triple down on my part.  I'm reopening this again. And here's why.  I felt a little pummeled by the amount of source. This is what you were indicating where you were sitting. Mike was like, I don't know. There's a lot of things that are bringing this up.  I started feeling like, well, if there's a number of them and not just one weird source, then maybe I should admit defeat here.  But as I'm thinking about it, I'm like, what are these sources exactly? And I went looking. I looked in a couple of places.  Theme Park Center. Yeah, we all know theme park. We're all hanging out on theme park.  That one on the episode, I said one that one out as like a do we know that?  And we're like, maybe we don't. I'm looking at we've never been to theme park center.  We've never been to the travel dot com. We've never been to an expired Tumblr called Disneyland secrets.  And then the main source and this was obviously flagged when it came up was that this this fact was touted by inside the magic.  I don't know if they're the most trustworthy. If their headline is ladies still swooning over Johnny Depp's perfect abs, you can, you know, audiences demand Johnny Depp's rippling abs back in the Pirates franchise.  You can trust them on that. Anything depth related. I'll give that to them. That's their beat.  They were on a terror about woke Cinderella this week. Woke live action Cinderella. Right.  And the right one that happened already. No, it's going to Rachel Zeigler Academy Award winner Rachel Zeigler.  Are you sure that Disney didn't already remake Cinderella? I'm sorry. Snow White Snow White. I get them always. I get them mixed up.  Oh, my God. Yeah. All right. Well, yeah. So they you know, they have their things that yeah, they're they're experts on woke culture.  But are they experts on Space Mountain fans? I don't know. I looked at their article. This is how much I want to.  I'm really sorry that I clicked and came close to giving them any ad revenue or anything, but I did give them a page click.  And it's one of those in classic Inside the Magic fashion. It's like Disneyland is a park that has entertainment over the like let's let's do 19 paragraphs where we say every key phrase in theme park world and  By petal humans enjoy amusement and vacationing.  It names. It's like you have to get through the entire existence of man. They go through the Book of Genesis.  They Jesus is discussed for a while. And then before and then finally they bury what you're actually there for.  And they say, well, a fan figured out that actually fans are used to simulate the speed of and then it's just it's a tick tock.  It's something called the mouse lits and they say, did you know that fans are used to simulate cold air on the all right for more facts.  Check out the mouse lits on and I just started thinking, where is the good source on this? Yeah.  Where is and I'm this isn't about me saying Jason's wrong. I actually would like to take that out of it in this.  I'm just trying to figure out what's what I'm trying to take fake news out of the equation because I think we're dealing with a lot of fake news here.  And in what I've just said of where this is discussed, what haven't I said I founded on Jim Hill, Lentesta Expedition theme park, Martin's vids.  None of these sources that we usually go to that we usually tout say anything about Space Mountain simulating with cold fan.  Now there's also some Reddit threads about it. Right.  And I'll give it that. But but I don't know if you can trust a TIL today.  I learned as a definitive source on this issue and I'm not saying there isn't a definitive source out there.  This is just this is why I bring it up. I want to know I want a source that we can trust to verify that fans are used on Space Mountain to simulate that it doesn't actually because I'm just not I don't see the proof.  I'm not buying it right now. Truthfully, I had already forgotten about this and I thought you were talking about Space Mountain like enthusiasts and I was like, oh God, what discourse did I miss this in between the like, you know, Haunted Mansion going like I'm going to run to the rallies next door for a burger to calm down.  You know, like the product placement, the aggressive product place, the the recent Internet trend where I wake up every day and learn a new of like bizarre thing about the Haunted Mansion movie.  Yeah, no, it's been it's been a pummeling lately. A lot of strange decisions. Yeah, apparently I haven't seen it. But apparently it's like, let me get out a pad and paper that I got at CVS.  Really weird. No, no, no, you moved on, Jason. You moved a lot. You took your victory and you moved on and I stayed in the weeds. I said, wait a minute, wait a minute. And I've been I've been connecting yarn on pins ever since Charlie Day meme or yes, I am a living Charlie Day meme right now.  Right.  But what do you now that now that I've brought all this up emotionally, Jason, are you like, go ahead, do your thing or do you feel confident in this fact? Still, do you think I'm the crazy one? Do you think it's possible that I will be disproven again? Or I don't know.  How are you feeling that I bring? No, I'm happy to see. I mean, I, I, you know, when I brought it up, it was mostly going off of like memory and, you know, going through the lights on once or twice on both coasts, you know, and like, I swear I saw a fan and like, it's very cold on my face going through here.  It seems far too cold for it to be 35 miles per hour. It's a cold room. I'll give you that. I say what we said the previous time this came up. I don't doubt that it's possible that there are fans in that building.  But that to me is different than fans with the explicit purpose of blowing on you. The writer, like if you think about the physics of it, Aaron brought this up back. She was like, if you stuck your if you were driving 35 miles an hour and you stuck your head out the window, you would be getting a general wind flow there.  Right? Yeah. Yeah. Imagine what would have to get added to that to register to even like enhance the effect. You know, that would have to be they would have to be like head on fans in that instance. Correct. Which seems harder to do in my mind because where would you put the fan?  There's that one need to be in the car with it. Just be super powerful air conditioners. I mean, making it colder traditional fan for you. You know, I think you have to count a big air conditioning unit and a fan that's a traditional.  Well, again, I that's a good point. I do think that I mean, if I think there is air conditioning in the building, that's not what you pointed. If it's like an air conditioning unit pointed at you on like a turn.  Turn that one because I don't know what is one going to do? The facts is implied by inside the magic and the mouse. Let's and my beef is with them, not with you, Jason. At this point, this being presented definitively as if this is a crucial part of the space.  Can we contact the mouse lits and find out who are they? I would love that. That's a viable way. First of all, who are the mouse lits? Where? Secondly, where are you getting your information from?  Are they just tick tock only? First of all, I'm going to become a mouse lits fan regardless of what the answer to these questions are, because do you have a tick tock account? Do I? I do. But I'm not. I'm not post or anything.  Just for lurking. I yes, I lurk on a lot of places. Yeah. Reddit. Oh, I know. Yeah, that's part of my thing. I lurk. Yeah. So Pleasure Island Facebook group. Pleasure Island Facebook group. I love the pleasure Island Facebook group. Yeah. So I think okay. If it's air conditioning units, you would consider though that Jason was still correct. I'm not saying that's not even a discussion of would it matter? It's not. I to me. Here's where I'm drawing the line. If there are air conditioning units, I'm not saying that's not even a discussion of would it matter.  Here's where I'm drawing the line. If there are air conditioning units in the building, that's not enough. Not enough. I agree here from a source that's quoting an Imagineer or somebody involved in the ride that there were especially large amount of air conditioning units put into Space Mountain.  Good looking. And your  that gets the speed. So I'm willing to say I'm wrong.  Yeah, sure. Well, which is again why I'd like to divide it. I think  I think the beef is not here. I think my beef is with these  sources that are quoting nothing because I like here you are maybe  bending what you think is happening in there and that's great. These places  that have published this thought with zero evidence.  Yeah, that's why I think what I I'm sure I'm trying to take these guys down.  I'm trying to take theme theme park center. You're in my crosshairs already gone  Tumblr Disneyland secrets. You're in my career. That's why they're gone  because they're publishing. I think so. News. I mean also in  addition to this, I because there are reddit there's a number of reddit threads  saying this is possible. But in the comments of those reddit threads you also have people  saying I don't know how this myth got started. And I've also  I also and I don't know if you could trust this but somebody said my professor  was an Imagineer who worked on the original design for this exact ride at Disneyland. He confirmed  that there were no such fans along the track. I don't  know. You can't trust that maybe as much as or you could more than you could trust  anybody on reddit. But isn't this I'm just  interesting. I think it's interesting. That's more why I bring it up than any particular  thing. However, I will acknowledge this that this does  go back to you said something I scoffed. I  seem to have been proven wrong in the moment and I might be proven wrong again. So though I don't  want to keep it personal Jason. Here's what I'm going to offer. If anyone  and this is where the listeners come in. I say contact who you got to contact.  Let's start digging things up. I'll save you the work of watching  the behind the attraction episode that Disney put out because I did  and there is no mention of the fans. But if we I think I think this is very possibly a job  for Jim and Lynn. If anybody feels like. Yeah yeah yeah.  There was ever a job. This is a big one. I think but if I am proven  definitively wrong in a way that we can all agree on. Here's  what I will offer you Jason. Oh my gosh. On three occasions  in theme parks or generally themed environments or just anywhere out in the world.  If we are near a place where a treat can be  purchased or achieved. I will not only purchase you this treat.  I will offer up the humiliation factor of if you  to know that you are in the mood for a treat. I will allow you to say  oh treat boy and then  I will go and buy you and will pay for on three occasions.  I will do this. I want there to be speaks to this. That's how much  I am I'm invested in this thing and would like to figure this out.  Hungry. I will  accept that. That can be part of it. You can't you can say hung we with a W.  So listener and I think it would probably behoove this entire  situation if all three of those were filmed and posted to our social  media. Oh yeah. So that's what I'm  putting out there. I don't want to you know  I'm more invested in this than you are maybe so I don't want to force you to  do anything but I would put out the possibility of if I'm correct  and proven definitively correct. If on one occasion  I am in the mood for wine. Yeah I was going to say do you  want some wine. Monsieur. Monsieur.  I do like that. I mean I was just going to do the same of a wine boy.  Maybe you follow it up with like a wood varietal Monsieur.  I mean I think all  of us are having fun either way. It keeps it in the run of fun if mild  humiliation for somebody. But does everybody sign off on this plan?  Sure. Yeah we have an impartial witness. I think you can help weigh  in on this. If you're feel free to make a ruling of I'm  sorry Scott this does seem like a credible source. But I really  feel like it's got an imagineer has to be involved. There's got to be a book.  It has to be because I think Disney likes to reveal their little secrets.  I think typically some of them yeah. Yeah yeah some they keep mysterious like a  Haunted Mansion thing like what you know which CVS the pen in the pad came from.  Yeah they're sharing a reveal ad in the film. But otherwise I think they  like to own up to this stuff and I think it's suspicious that this has never been.  Well I completely agree with what you're saying. On the Disneyland  Space Mountain there is a large like asteroid or something  that you know what I'm talking about. When we first enter sort of space. Yeah.  And you're slowly waiting to actually hit the fast part of the ride. Yeah. And you  can't really see it. You kind of have to squint to see it. Sure. And I'm just wondering like  does it count if like there's a fan somewhere pointed at  the car up there even. And you're saying it's like  part of space atmosphere. Right.  So it's even before the speed happens. No I think this is about  speed. And even though I think Jason's point of view on this  is adjusting. I accept that to create a spacey  cool atmosphere that there are little like swirls and gusts  of air conditioning. That makes sense to me. But again I'm going to the  letter of the law here with these articles and I'm saying that these I think it has to be involved  in the simulation of the speed. Specifically. Specifically  speed. I think so. Because that's the part that I think is  weird. I think ultimately the ride doesn't go that fast. Right.  But these are big weighty vehicles. And I think you have to have absolute  cannons to have any impact beyond what just gravity  is already doing. And like the tightness of the turns.  I think that's in the darkness as we said. Well I will say this  I will be impartial. On the  hyperspace mountain it is a lot more lit up in there.  So I guess we would have seen. I'm trying to think where the fans  would be. I feel like you would have seen something. Well and not only that  there's a lot of ride through. You know everybody's get. If anybody gets the chance  to ride space mount with the lights on they're turning their camera on. Yeah that's  true. And they're putting it to YouTube. You can watch YouTube's. I don't see where these fans.  I don't even see like big old fans at the top of the building. I'm not seeing fans.  Sometimes I'll see a little something and I'll say could it be. And then I think that's a camera.  I think that's a speaker. But if. But if. This is another way a listener can be helpful. If you  want to go through videos like that. Yeah. In Peru. And don't just photoshop  fans in there. I want to see.  There has to be a way to verify. And if. Don't just take a picture from a Sears catalog.  And just drop it into a frame.  I don't know. I want to see what talents our listeners have.  I would like to see that. I would like to see their photoshop skills. If you do that then you have to say  parody like the rules of Twitter. I'm sorry.  Or XR now. Where if you're going to do a parody account of something  it has to say parentheses parody. And don't bring like a big  office fan on the ride with you and during the photo op hold it up.  That's not funny and it's dangerous. I'd say it's very dangerous.  I mean it's funny. I take it back. Yeah. I was going to say it's very funny. It's funny but it's dangerous and don't do it and then we'll be responsible.  So don't do that either. If it just drops and it doesn't hit you  then you got cars below you. Two employees. A lot of bad things can happen here.  I don't know. So don't do that. I don't want it to become the new Flash Mountain  where people are bringing fans on the actual ride.  I would be impressed if you were able to smuggle one and then like  be in a seat belt. Is it a pull down? What is it on Space Mountain?  Yeah it's a pull down I believe. Oh then how are you even. Boy.  Or is it lap? I can't remember. Oh it's lap. It's pull back on lap.  Oh okay. I've only been on it a hundred times.  Yeah right. It's just been a while. Yeah it has. I oddly have not been on Space Mountain  in a while. And maybe if I went I would plainly see fans right away.  That's possible. And realize the foolishness of my way. I might get kicked down  real fast here but I'm willing to do it because I think it's interesting.  I think it becomes a little hunt that the audience can help with.  You know hey everybody's a winner if Jim or Len get involved.  Let's just see what happens here. Well Len tried to do a big one. I am very willing to be.  I think I was using fans and air conditioning like strong air conditioning  interchangeably. I just like. There's a lot of air flow.  The fans is enough repeated online that I think you probably saw that somewhere.  Probably infected yeah something in my brain. Oh and a listener  said like I've known my mom told me about this when I was growing up. I thought this was common knowledge.  And I hate to be I don't mean to be sounding like your mom was wrong.  But is it possible that this is one of those like urban myth things  that sounds cool. I like the idea of it. Yeah I just don't know if I buy it  in practice. I'm being a skeptic here. Sure. Well we'll find  I think we'll find out quickly. I think so too. And boy and we  will try to you know we'll just make a moment. If  it happens quickly and I'm wrong we'll try to make a moment happen quickly where I am  I become treat boy and I'm forced to fetch a treat for Jason.  We'll knock one of those out in a non-theme park environment. We'll just run to downtown Burbank.  You good with the Ben and Jerry's? Yeah I was going to say yeah plenty of basketball.  He's good with the prices of Ben and Jerry's. That's six thousand my friend.  Yeah. Hey you know maybe I'll put on a little costume too.  We're going to have fun either way.  These are the stakes and I'm sorry that's a bunch of non-vegas but  it's a runner in the series now. We'll find out by the end of the series. No maybe  hit a local. Yummy cupcakes is pretty convenient for most spots in  Burbank. That is the real business. How much is a cupcake? I don't know I haven't  been in a little while. I would assume a few dollars at least.  I feel like there were like four dollars. I feel like there were four dollars  like ten years ago. So I don't know. I feel like  reasonably it has to be a treat for one person to have. I feel  like it cannot be a dozen of something  and then you like put them in the fridge. Well I feel like when I've had  it before you're either buying one or you're buying a box of the four  big ones and you're taking them to something or  splitting. Oh I'm not going to make you buy a box of cupcakes. Like I'm not.  The price of cupcakes nowadays you know. Well thank you for taking  that into consideration. There's a crumble cookie coming.  That's a chain. That's a popular chain. We should probably get to Vegas before we list every  different treat in Burbank. Specifically in localizing.  I haven't called that localizing in a while. Well Randy's donuts by the airport is delicious.  Cookie dough dreams over downtown Burbank. Yeah you know I've had that a couple times.  I don't like it that much. They do strawberries sometimes. No you're right we're done. We're going back  to Vegas. We're going to a different  strange piece of sloped architecture  with rides inside multiple rides inside. We're talking about the Luxor.  The of course the Egyptian  themed hotel and casino.  Which I think has gone a little astray. I think it's lost  a little. Yeah yeah yeah. I mean we'll get into that.  I think as with all this is a great example of  the theme that will come up you know multiple times in this series  of the family friendly Vegas of the 90's where now they've made efforts to make it  just kind of generic and all the stuff you'd usually want  in a casino but in the 90's this was  an indoor theme park. This was like the primary thing  almost was like a new concept in a  themed entertainment center. It was nuts. It was nuts in the 90's. Yeah one of  the most ambitious themed experience of like three  interconnected attractions and a  boat ride that goes around the lobby. Like a boat ride  with pretty bad per hour ridership I believe. Very bad  I believe. Very bad. Yeah. Well this is the experimental nature of it.  There's a lot they were just they were willing to try all of this stuff as  foolish as it might be. Badly priced or as badly  enumerated as it might be. But it's  really notable and worth talking about and a lot of things about it that are like  just big and unprecedented and stupid.  And that's why it deserved an episode here on the main strip. Yeah it is stupid  and I knew a little of it but then like just watching and reading you just like  oh my god. Like they really  gave them like carte blanche to just make up their own mythology  and make up characters and make up technology  and like stuff that doesn't even seem like it would be popular. It seems  like this would be. Yeah. Not because of any  lack of effort on the part. Right. Or imagination. Masters putting this thing together  but it just sounds like maybe we just we know this  in retrospect because we've seen a lot of things like this  where it's not IP and it's an original world and that's cool and to be  commended but it's certainly everything you hear about the story of it and the world of it  you're like that sounds like something that will not do well. Of course. Unfortunately it's  way up our alley. We love it but yeah. For like again like dads especially  90s dads. Yeah. Oh yeah they're going to track like this  pre-Egyptian like society. It's a story  that takes place in past present and future. A perfect pyramid  of tales. Yeah and like it's just so it just seems so like  impenetrable to know what's going on versus just any like generic  Disney thing where it's like pirates are yelling at you. Got it. Great. You are  in a haunted mansion. That is true. You know what and I was going to open  the bigger narrative of why doesn't original  theme park IP work better out in the world. We love  what look what's original pirates and haunted mansion and you answered it right there.  You understand what those are before you're even in the gate. You look at the  sign. I don't think you understand you need a lot of  explanation to figure out what is it all called. It's all called secrets of the Luxor  pyramid. Yeah. And yeah that doesn't tell you much  of any that doesn't tell you you're going to be time traveling and with archaeologists. No and it's  by the way I love this. Yeah I really do. I think there's better  versions of what they conceived of that would have worked much better.  But I do love it as an idea and a concept so I don't want to say I don't want to  put it down but it's not like oh yeah you're going to go get chased by  a mummy or something. Oh it's Egypt. Got it. It's mummies. It's pharaohs  done. You're right. Maybe it should have been a little more basic  Maybe. Maybe. And there's things that are basic. I'm  actually I'm going to propose here backing up a little bit and like entering the building  because there are things about this place that are very impressive and unprecedented  before you even get in there. Yes. You know beyond just the  attractions. So let me step it back to  opening which is October 14th 1993. It's 93  like all of the 93 now it's clear the end of 93 the peak of  the pyramid peak of insane family. Yeah. Las Vegas. Because I think  Treasure Island. Treasure Island. Pirate shows around then. Luxor  and MGM Grand. Luxor only for  like a few days was the tallest building  I think on the strip and then Treasure Island immediately built  beat it. Wow. Oh weird. Oh that's crazy.  It's also I mean first things first it is an actual  pyramid and it's not built in some fake way  that makes it not a pyramid. It's not a simulation of a pyramid. It's a real  pyramid and as such it's one of the tallest  pyramids ever built. It's taller than only two  of the actual Egyptian pyramids. So it's in the top ten pyramids  ever built. It's I forget the amount of like  is there a bigger pyramid. Oh well if you can't you know what's a pyramid is the  Transamerica pyramid in San Francisco  which has some other there's like a more of a traditional building shape. Right.  Caked into it but you know what I mean the San Francisco pointy building. There's an  interactive like chart where you can see how big it is compared to other  stuff. Unfortunately it did not include the Bass Pro Shop  pyramid. No I know. I mean that's the only we have the same  thought we're looking at real history stacked up against the Luxor and we're both like  yeah but what's the where's the pyramid I know. Yeah. The weird one in Memphis.  I guess it's too small. It doesn't rate. Right.  But the Luxor rated. The Luxor is huge. Thirty six stories.  Entire establishment three hundred seventy five million dollars to open.  Built by but no longer owned by  Circus Circus. So I think there's a through line and we aren't  doing an episode about Circus Circus this round but Circus Circus  we're talking about like why does all this happen. The the family vacation  of Vegas and some of it you got a tribute to Mirage I think that that's a big  Disneyland free attraction and that  popped a lot of eyes. But then Circus Circus has got to  get a lot of credit too. Even though that was going since  the 60s right. I mean that and yeah. The guy's name is J  Sarno. I didn't find enough about him to make him like an official guy. Right.  The thing that we did but the he sees his powers too and  it he kind of combined. How do we lure people in well with some  big gaudy theme. And so he kind of  revolutionized Vegas in that way. So I guess it makes sense  that Circus Circus thinks what else can we do. How do we go further  and how do we kind of like Disney Worldify elsewhere  on the strip. So they're responsible then for Excalibur.  Which is like  I mean I remember hearing about Excalibur when I was a kid.  Get me there. I want I love Disneyland.  But I don't get to stay in the castle. Yeah. I get to live  in a castle. Like not knowing the actual vibe. Right.  Excalibur would be if I were to go. Yeah. Yeah.  I mean I still felt that whenever I the first time I went to Vegas was like  2007 and even just seeing Excalibur even in its like decaying  state I was like hell yes. I didn't stay there but it was still  like that kid kid brain of like yeah. Yeah. I want to stay in that  dumb castle. Yeah. Yeah. You also I love looks or  for the existence of it if not in practice. I like  in the same way that I love all these where as  the stuff pops up in the early 90s and I was saying I think some of it's got to come from like  Disney Decade and Eisner era that there's a pyramid  next to a castle. Yeah. And then you're not far  from the pirate ship and the it is like it really starts to feel like  Disney World where you're like here's the here's the Hawaiian one and here's the future one and  here's the Caribbean one. Yeah. I mean I like that stupidity  of Vegas. What makes it feel like a big miniature golf course. Yeah.  Yeah. Just like random landmarks. Yeah. Yeah.  And various monorails and people movers connecting  true each other. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. With an aesthetic that has nothing  to do with the hotels that it's passing by. You're right. That is exactly like Disney  World. This is probably at the root of all of our love of Vegas. It's all like  you know we've all separately like fractured into different things that we  like about Vegas. But like isn't it like it's like a  stupid or trashy or Disney World all like crunched and only  the hotels. 100% Yeah. 100% it is.  Just seeing this dumb nonsense when you're walking down the street is so  important to people with theme park brains. I just  want mini golf courses so right on. I just I want the world to  be like a huge miniature golf course. Yeah. I was looking when I was there  because I stayed one night at the Luxor and I stayed two nights at New York.  I forgot where your first night was. Okay. It was at Luxor because I  didn't know if I was going to be there and then I got a cheaper room. So that was the Luxor.  It seems like that's the thing by the way. It seems like Luxor is a  last minute really cheap room spot. But New York, New York  I was looking at it as I was walking down the street and I kept looking at it going  okay this would be a good basis for a  Marvel area with the height of a New York  skyline like this in a theme park only do what you know that we've talked  about these photos from this never built Marvel thing that was going to be in Dubai.  I think so. Yeah. But I was just looking at it and I was like I was like imagining New York, New  York in a different context as like the hotel itself because it's  if you haven't seen it it's just giant. They're not as tall as the  skyscrapers in New York but they're very tall. Yeah. Like the scope of them is so big  and crazy. And then all like mashed together as like the you know the New  York that never was. Right. And they're all like a little more. It is very  Marvely. You're right. Yeah. So I get like I just add like Dr.  Octopus's tentacles coming out of a window and add like  Spider-Man on the side of one. And I'm like man we're like this is so close  to what I want. Yeah. Which we won't ever get I don't think. No I don't  think Marvel. I don't think Disney is going to license out Marvel to although they should. I mean  look if they're trying to you know crank up some profits  here. It's too. Why not. Yeah. It's going to be too realistic like everything's going  to be realistic. That's the yeah. That's because of the movies.  This kind of dull take. Yeah. Yeah. It's fun. It'll be another ten  years before they learn that one of the most important characters in the Marvel  universe is the city itself. New York  City. Yeah. New York City. Yeah. Yeah. Hopefully they'll realize that.  Hopefully they'll realize it. New York New York and to  some extent Luxor obviously the theming has been pulled back but there's still  a bit of it in Luxor. But I have found those casinos  in terms of just like sitting at a slot machine  and like posting are very fun. New York New York  especially with all the fake city streets and all and the facades  and all. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. New York New York and we'll talk we'll talk more  when we're talking about our trip but New York it is fun and especially it's fun and I wasn't  at this point in this trip but it's fun if you want to  like really get hammered and have a  piece of pizza and go into a piano bar and just be  annoying with a bunch of other annoying people and I mean that in a good way because I saw  that happening every night or both nights. Oh sure.  $25 a head at that piano bar to get in. Is it that much? You're guaranteed a seat  if you pay that. It is small so that's actually maybe not bad. It is very small but you can also just  hang out outside and hear the piano kind of. There was a lady  screaming the lyrics to like piano man because I walked by  and I was like I'm not in the mood for it right now but they're  depending on the trip sometimes you are in the mood to enjoy  something like that. I don't think there's any amount of alcohol that  could get me in the mood to enjoy a dueling piano. What if she was  singing that Beach Boys problem child song.  And it was five o'clock on a Saturday. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I guess  well I would do a double take but you know I'd also be upset that even  a non classic was getting ruined. Okay.  I okay so big thing about this I remember  very clearly when this place opened because we'd  get like in LA we're not far so we're getting local news reports about it.  I'm like oh alright something's happening in Vegas and I for sure remember  like the news or my parents telling me how yes there is  there is a pyramid hotel and there is a light that shoots out  of the top of it and you can see the light from space.  What a stupid thing. I love that it was nice to see it. I don't think  they run it as bright. I think they tone down the brightness. Yeah. Yeah.  At some point it brought down two satellites probably.  Started a war. Yeah. McCarran Airport now a Harry Reid  Airport. Not a fan of the light I believe. Oh sure.  Because you can like I saw that you could see  you could see the light potentially from Los Angeles. At cruising altitude  yeah you can see the light. Let alone you're in the airport  literally next door. I saw the phrase strongest  beam of light in the world and yeah.  So dumb. So pointless. Who went in there because of that?  It's a very good question. Did it ever did it help business? Do they have to do it?  It seems like an aggro move of like our light is the fucking strongest  light on earth. Like we will signal  like did you see Reid that it has its own ecosystem?  Ecosystem? Essentially enough animals. Yes.  Enough animals and species are up there because they're so attracted to the light.  So there's like moths but then there's also bats and I don't know the intricacies of it  but I saw that in multiple sites now I don't know I didn't source it but  it seems like they've set up shop there. Certain animals have set up shop there.  And it's like a you know upside down ecosystem  because it has its own rules where like you think the bats are in there to eat the smaller animals  but actually like the bats and the moths get married.  Yeah yeah yeah. They're monogamous. Right. They treat each other really well.  It's one of the some of the more loving relationships. It's beautiful actually.  And if you saw them make love you would weep. It's also I believe  it was 2012 there was a UFO sighting.  I don't know if you guys are UFO-pilled like I am in the last few months  because there's a lot of UFO stuff and this is totally sincere. There's so much UFO stuff  going on. There's a big hearing like a couple days ago.  A bunch of people on the record like pilots and people in the military just being like  here's the video. Here's how fucking crazy this little  object was behaving. I don't know what it is. And then there's other people  in the government that are saying crazier things like yeah we have had  contact with alien species. They have killed humans. There are  agreements in place between humans and aliens.  So like it really. No I have not tracked down. This stuff is not I don't know why everyone's  not like at least talking about it. I'm not saying this extreme version of  this guy's details. I always catch a little of it and I'm always  interested when it comes up. I do know I saw that the one of the  people testifying about it was really into like other dimensions  and he's like well of course Mussolini and the Vatican  found aliens. Yes that's the Mr. Grush is his last name. Yeah.  He's a government official who people say is credible  but he's the one who's definitely saying the wildest shit about aliens  versus other people who have just. There's like so many pilots who just have  videos from their ship just like of like a little craft just  justifying the laws of physics. Just so many of these videos where people are like  it's scary. It looks scary. We don't know. So there's all this going  on but apparently there was a big sighting in 2012.  We're in the from there. To the beam of light. Yeah yeah. And I haven't found the  video. I should go find the video before and post it if they have it. Did aliens find the light?  Because you could see it from space. That's what I'm wondering because the light was so strong.  Maybe it did attract some of the aliens to the light.  It's ironic because Luxor and the Egyptian like  employee costumes do come into play in the movie Mars Attacks.  Oh right. Yeah right. Oh yeah yeah. So that light  I do believe maybe has attracted alien life.  It's so strong. It's shooting into the universe. You think anybody you think any of them  are up there or is anybody bothered to ask one of the bats are you an alien?  I don't think they have asked probably. And then they just immediately like alright you got me.  They kind of like unzip their body and then they're 10 feet tall.  I crunched all my organs up here just to blend in to simulate one of  your human bats. Anyway I'll tell you my deal. I'm 5000 years old.  Came from Xyral 4. Somebody's got to climb up there and figure it out.  Yeah. It'd be a good place to introduce them to us.  The Blue Man group can communicate to them with sound and  visual things and then you can show them the bodies exhibit  which is like yeah we don't know where these ones came from but this is what humanity is.  This is all it's in us okay. You can trust us. Look  our literal insides. Our heart is on display for you.  You can trust us. We'll show you that titanic exhibit. We'll show you  our folly. We are but flawed creatures.  When we try to build might it blows up in our face don't you see.  That's a heart. They couldn't turn that down is what I'm saying.  No better play and then human and alien can all laugh together  at the universe bonding comedy of Carrot Top.  Oh yeah.  He made a toilet seat do what?  Even we understand the Monica Lewinsky references.  We knew all about that in Xyral 4. It's like an Mars Attacks Alien  and like a human with arms around each other guffawing at the same time.  So you got a big light  that's attracting bats and aliens. I don't know  when this stopped because I specifically when I drive by it  if I'm on there or if you're going to see the sign that's something we haven't  talked about is the famous Vegas sign which every once in a while like  okay I'll do the sign and only then will I pass by like  the front garden of the Luxor which now  kind of sucks. It's specifically like a bad area and often  like they ruin the grandeur of the pyramid  with just like a big poster for their eSports arena.  eSports arena and then the other side is the biggest  Bet MGM logo you've ever seen. I know I pulled into the parking  garage and it's just like this big fuck hole like it looks like shit.  It's pretty bad. This is what they've all the aesthetic of at its worst  a lot of these like dumb it's the fusion of  dumb 90's aesthetics that we like with just modern trash  and they think like the funky blend of it will be  what's interesting. Why a pyramid with an eSports but really it just doesn't  work at all. They've got other problems too. I watched a local Vegas news  report where viewers wrote letters to the news  and asked why is the Luxor so dirty?  Did you find that when you were there? Yes.  Did you feel it from your window? Did you see like gunk caked on?  Or was it just like in pulling up? No just pulling.  I got to the Luxor episode.  I got there. There was the longest line ever. I was going to try to see if I could get like an upgrade  or something. I don't know if it was going to be a $20 trick. Probably not. But the line was  so long so I just checked it on my phone and I was trying  to get to the hotel room and the elevator I was trying to get to  was broken. And I was like oh god. And the hotel, the carpeting  looked extra dirty. There's bad vibes in there. It's just a bad  vibe. Especially when you go up. It's just kind of a bad vibe.  I don't mean to correct you Michael. The inclinator.  I was waiting for a pause to say inclinator as well. I'm going to talk about the inclinator.  The diagonal elevator. I'm so sorry. I am so sorry.  Which I tried to pitch to Jane once. What if we stayed at Luxor  for a night? You know you take an inclinator. It's a diagonal elevator. And she's like  I watched some videos looking from the higher floor. She's like absolutely  not. Here's a reverse pitch. What if we stayed somewhere safe?  Yeah. Well that is funny that you say safe. Oh no.  So I'm trying. I have bags. I have my Comic Con exclusive toys.  Which are going to come up every episode this month. I just unboxed Ernie Reyes Jr.  It's a great toy. He's got his little scooter. Kino from Secret of the Use.  I got everything. I'm just lugging this shit. And I'm just like oh  where's my room? So I'm walking, walking to find a different elevator.  So I get to this other bank of elevators. It's not the right bank.  It's like one through eighteen and then eighteen through whatever. Like you have to find  certain. Okay. Oh it's not the right one. Alright I go to another one. I finally find  an elevator that looks correct. I get in.  I scan because now your phone is your room key. I scan the room key  on the thing, on the whatever, the button pad in the elevator  and the inclinator and it's not working. It doesn't fucking  work. I didn't get a real key card because I skipped the line. So I keep scanning.  Not working. I just want to go to the room and put all this shit down.  I hate the Luxor in this moment. I'm so mad at it. I'm so mad that I didn't spend like  fifty more dollars to stay at a better place. So all of a sudden the elevator  door closes or maybe it was closed already. All of a sudden the elevator  starts, inclinator starts moving. Now it's, I'm like okay  I guess somebody at the top maybe hit the button and is looking for the inclinator.  I don't think this is what happened because there was no one at the top. I  shoot up from first to thirty six or whatever. I forget exactly  what the floor is. It is the rickety-est ride  I've ever had and that includes Tower of Terror simulated rickety.  It's rattling. It's like this. I didn't know that.  And I'm literally, I'm freaked. I'm completely freaked out. I have all  the, like I'm so tired and I'm just like, it's, you can hear  like stuff rattling and I'm going and I'm like when is this going to stop? I'm  expecting it's going to be like Charlie in the great glass elevator. I'm going to shoot out the Luxor.  It's going so fast. You gotta say goodbye to your loved ones  Ernie if I don't get a chance to tell you. I love you.  I give Ernie a kiss. I rip open the box.  Which is ironic. I'll bring this up now since you're talking about  elevators. I took the elevator out to my room at the Park MGM  done floor 27 once, opened on floor 24. Who did I see?  But the Carlson family, Mr. and Mrs. Carlson. Well because you were all  staying at the same hotel. We were all staying at the same hotel and we just high  by. That's a different, yeah those elevators work. That's a cute story. Anyway, back to  your horror show. So it's rattling and I'm just like oh my god.  So I end up at the top floor and it opens. No one's there.  But it's not my floor so I'm not getting out on the chance that  I can get back down again. So then I go  back down. And it's just as bad  and scary. And then it's like I'm so freaked out. You know like when you're in elevator  and it seems like there's an extra like five seconds and sometimes your brain goes  are we stuck? Is that ever happened? Yeah. It feels like  45 seconds in my memory. Oh god. Of the door not opening.  And then I'm like scanning and scanning. It might have been 20 seconds  of a panicked 20 seconds. It feels like 45 seconds.  So like scanning, scanning, scanning. Finally the door opens I think because somebody else  had hit the button. And then somebody else scanned me up to the right  floor finally. I think, I was honestly, it's so  blurry now. I may have just gotten into a different elevator.  But I was just like so freaked in  that moment. And none of the other one, because I went in a couple different ones the rest  of the day or the day and then the next morning. And none of them were that bad.  But that one was crazy. I've never been in a scarier  elevator situation. And here I am imagining  especially Jason like we should stay at the Luxor for the inclinators.  The might of man. The inclinator.  I'm going to die in this inclinator. It was  really awful. I did read, wait I don't remember  where this quote came from. But somewhere printed  the phrase inclinator. An elevator that ascends at a 39 degree angle  and rocks like a ferris wheel carriage. Yeah I guess maybe that  I went into, because it was the set of inclinators  that went to the top. They go fast. So because of the  angle that just is normal. That is so upsetting to the, well between  this and the New York New York roller coaster, this corner of the strip is just  shaky ride alley. Shaky. Luxor also, if you  look up the phrase Luxor cursed or Luxor haunted.  There's a lot of different, like some obviously  people have died. It's a hotel that's been open for a while.  But then some of the deaths are fucking bonkers. There was like a car bomb  that was rigged to like, alright I'm just going to put an upside down  cup in this guy's car and there's an explosive in there so if he turns  the cup over the thing.  Truly crazy deaths have happened. A pipe bomb  and I believe it did kill the intended target. A guy worked at  the Nathan's Hot Dogs in the food court because the  bomber's ex-girlfriend was now seeing him.  And the two bombers were sentenced to life in prison. They avoided  the death penalty. Jesus. Oh my god.  Wow. Well first of all, RIP to a real one. To a  Nathan's Hot Dog employee. To a Nathan's True Blue Young. But also like isn't that the  like you wedge yourself into a relationship. You cause a break  up. It probably does not occur to you that the person might have  a vast knowledge of how to build successful bombs.  Of car bombs. I think someone also may have gotten grievously  injured or died falling down the shafts of one of the  inclinators. No. No. Yeah. And then you go look at the  article. It says here it happened in 2023 and his name was Michael Carlson.  Michael R. Carlson. Ah! And then Mike disappears.  What was that? There was a flash of Luxor Escalate and then Mike  was gone. Wouldn't it be cool though if a ghost was your third host?  Yeah. I mean as long as I showed up. Yeah.  As long as you put in the yeah look I'm not splitting the Patreon money  with an apparition. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Cause I understand. Did you guys see  in somebody said this that the rumor  was that the whole place is haunted because it was a place where  mobsters used to kill and bury their enemies? That's what the  property was? Yeah. Yeah. I mean I'm sure that's probably  every place that there was a hotel or there's a hotel now.  Well I also saw that in construction a handful  of workers died but it was like oh estimated  three but it might actually be seven. And like  that's haunting. I saw one video that said it's cursed  because if you build a sphinx to protect a pyramid  you have to build two and they only built one.  So there's so many old fads. There's so many. Like curses  that haven't been awakened in this century. They defied so  many law. They defied so many different laws  essentially. They built on a burial ground.  They didn't do the two sphinxes. Mobster curse, mummy curse.  I don't know if there were any others. I don't know the other types of curses.  Well they probably built two fads. I mean this whole thing was built in 18  months. It's like poltergeist probably. One of these days it's just gonna like  get absorbed into a ball of energy and go to hell or something. Sure.  I don't know why it hasn't happened yet but. That's a good way  because I love my Vegas implosions but how do you top that? Well by the entire  entire Luxor being taken back to hell.  If hell could take back a casino that would be the ultimate  implosion. That's the one it's eyeing. The video I was watching  these couple who do like Vegas videos. They were like oh there's a  middle aged man in like a pinstripe suit that walks the halls.  That's a ghost at the Luxor. And you're supposed to like get out of his  way. Like that's how we just make sure you get out of his way. No problem.  And everything is fine. Good rule of thumb. Yeah. They didn't  Did they film him? Did they get him? They did. They did. I got a release.  You can't. You have to get out of his way but he will sign a release form for YouTube.  He understands how media works. No I get you. Yeah.  I was saying you release. I know. Hey we know an other worldly  Yeah that's true. Pinstripe suit man.  They got a jewel store in here somewhere?  The Luxor for sure is haunted. You can feel it. There's a  weird vibe in there. And all the Vegas hotels have a weird vibe but that  one does feel haunted to me. That doesn't surprise me that it's haunted.  But also I won a hundred dollars playing slots  there a few years ago so who's to say. What slot machine?  I don't. It was a very generic. It was one of the ones where  it's like. Adventures in babysitting. It only plays 80's movie.  I did and we did okay on the Wizard of Oz slot machine  at the Bellagio. Okay. That was pretty fun. Little shop?  Little shop treat you. Hide a little shop story. We'll save it for another episode.  Okay that's a good Patreon tease. It'll be on the trip report. Park MGM  does not feel cursed to me. It doesn't feel haunted. No and that's  Circus Circus Entertainment at some point did own 50%  of the Monte Carlo which is what Park MGM was  before. And if you there's some very there's like  2012 videos of like walking through the Monte Carlo and it  looks busted. Like it's like oh this got redone it  just the right time. They got all the ghosts out of there before.  Some of the best vi. We found ourselves back in there over and over again.  Really good. Okay so Mike didn't die. Mike didn't become  one of the unhappy haunts of the Luxor.  Didn't succumb to the Pharaoh's curse. 99.  If that story kept going.  So then we're getting I know I'm getting afraid and now they see the numbers climbing like to  I'm sorry I'm on floor a thousand and then the roof of the  elevator dissipate just turned it just scattered into  ashes and then I went into a ghostly Pharaoh's mouth.  He screamed your soul is mine forever and I went  into it and then I can't even describe what I saw in there.  Well I met 900 dead mobsters.  The genre I like you know what I like the genre  mash up here of the mobster ghosts plus all the  Egyptian stuff. This is a real Cowboys versus Aliens. Yeah yeah.  It's mobsters versus mummies.  This would have kept it open if this was the sort of basis for all of the rides  and experiences. It's a little bit of a streamlined yes. Yeah. Easy to wrap  your head around. Right. I wonder Scott do you know about  how that got me like that that was  in the mid 2000s they made it as  a comic book first Cowboys versus Aliens.  And it seemed like a thing where they were like practically  giving it away at stores where it's like I don't  how is this making money like and as it came out they were like there's a movie  like it seemed like really shady.  Sure to be hit movie. Sure to be hit movie. Yeah.  So I am wondering like oh are their stories going to come out  if they haven't already come out of like the Ponzi scheme that got  Cowboys versus Aliens made you know. I'd love to know.  Well let's start a Ponzi scheme for mummies versus mobsters.  Yeah. There's gotta be some shady financier  out there. Look we might be talking asylum if we're lucky it's asylum. Yeah  we'll go sub asylum if we have to to get our vision of mummies versus  mobsters which is a bit which is a more of a mobster versus  mummies versus mobsters. Mobster versus mummies I think. Yeah. Okay. All right.  Yeah. I do I know I said I was I was thinking  that we don't have any commercial pilots in our audience and I have yet to be proven wrong.  I think there's pilots in our audience but not commercial pilots. That's what you want.  But is there any are there any shady movie producers in our audience.  I hope so. If so what are you doing.  If you're a fan of this you if you're a fan of this podcast you know  we're chomping at the bit to make the worst movies ever made. Oh my god we would love to.  We could do it all together. We could each have our own bad movie and you could finance  them and hang out with us. Come on. And also with like  mobster like you can get like it's a genre  where you can get like great actors who have  played mafia characters before you can get you can get Al Pacino  living soprano actor. Well that's true. So easily just like  but a modest amount of money. Pacino will do it. Yeah that's true.  Give him the earpiece and just feed him the lines and he doesn't even need to yeah  see a mobster. He's maybe not to spoil it but he's maybe a  mobster who you realize is secretly a mummy. Of course he's a mummy.  Of course he is. A mummy. A mummy this whole time. And nobody  knows. The Tribeca Film Festival is solely  to gain life force for  his mummy spells. The Tribeca Film Festival?  Are you confusing De Niro? Did you say Pacino? Yes. Oh I thought  you were talking about De Niro because I know De Niro has done a lot of  those direct. You said you had to listen to the impression and then still thought it was De Niro.  He can get pretty mad. He can get pretty  mad. I don't know. I don't think De Niro is shouted in a movie in 30 years.  He is not able to shout anymore. He's physically not able to get that  excitable. He's gentle. He's like he's the intern. You know? He helps  everyone out. Pacino makes Pesci and De Niro look like  he's 15 and they're 80  in the Irishman. He has so much more energy than they do. Thank God.  When Pacino loses the ability to scream that'll be like the snuffing out  of the great art of the 20th century.  But I know Pacino is still hanging out with Guy Fieri and  Sly and everybody. He's doing great. He just had a baby.  Oh he's hungry. Oh that's why you got confused. De Niro and Pacino both had babies.  That's right. Proud Papa. Proud Proud Papa.  Was that De Niro or Pacino?  I think a modern De Niro person is just like  doing good. Yeah. Excited to be.  I don't know if that even picked up. People in watching Killers of the Flowers  the Flower. Killers under the Flowers? Killers of the Flower.  Killers of the Flowers? I don't think I'm under. What am I thinking? I think it's under.  I was saying people are going to be watching that in the Paci  and the De Niro scenes. They're just like turn it up.  Can't hear him. You can just hear the volume. Sit closer to the speaker in the  theater. It's the only way. Plement seems like he's screaming in comparison.  Somebody's riding the levels on that. You can hear  the hiss of the white noise in the background. That's the sound of the moon.  No we put it in there on purpose. Okay keep getting through rides.  You have a ride before you. You have a ride that I think initially  you didn't even have to pay for. And the ride, well I don't even know if it had a name  initially. It became the Nile River Adventure.  Okay so confusing history here  where this was, oh first of all with this giant pyramid  space we now have the largest atrium in the world.  Yes. You got to fill that with a lot of stuff. And you have a  kind of marvely little indoor, it's a little bit New York but  mixed with Art Deco, mixed with Egypt.  It's real strand. That's still there. They can't get rid of that. They still have  to like, I don't know, whatever nightclub crap we're doing  has to work under this weird Marvel city. So that's there.  But this boat ride was initially a big  part of it where you would, it was crazy reading the phrase  that you would climb aboard the boat, the reed boat, not far  from the check in desk. Mike you described this difficult  process of finding the right elevator. What they imagined for you  is that you're whisked away on a reed boat. Alright just  follow the boat sir and then you climb aboard a boat and that takes  you all across the world's largest atrium. So it was meant to be a  boat that took you around the hotel or the lobby  until they realized that doesn't make any sense. Well and the waits were  like 90 minutes to get on the boat which I don't, who  didn't bring this up? This is one of the most, well you know what's going to happen to you  right away on day one is lines will form.  Yeah this is really weird. I understand, like this, no one brought  this up that like, this is going to back up. You know you can see  great footage, there's a very slick  special, like 27 minute special about the opening of the Luxor.  Yes, great special. Which we'll pull from a lot when we talk about these, the big  ticket rides. Yeah. And you see a couple funny things about the  boat ride. One, within the first few shots of the special there's a  massive crowd waiting for the boat ride. And two, later on  you see one of the boat ride hosts  doing the spiel, holding the script in a microphone  to an empty boat as they're putting final touches on the  whole place. And that is very funny to see.  Well the notable thing there is that she is practicing her spiel and  welcoming people on board the boat for when it opens and she says, hi my name is  Cricket. I'll be your, I also noted that her name is Cricket.  That stuck in my mind too, yeah. Wow. That's cool.  I hope Cricket had a good run before the Nile River adventure wrapped up.  So basically, so this was meant to be like a transportation boat, this was meant to be more like  the Epcot boats, so the Island of Adventure boats, but that doesn't make  any sense and really just what it leads to is weird imagery of like  here's the, because it's also, okay, all the rooms are facing that  atrium, so it's like the world's largest motel basically where  you don't have private hallways. It's all like as soon as you're out of your room you are  public facing. So that's the case and if you're on one of the lower  floors you walk out, if you're on floor two you step out and maybe there is  a reed boat full of tourists going by immediately.  So the creepiness of the boat just moving through the  little hotel corridors is very strong. Really weird.  Yeah. And I think it's smell, I think it was very  chloriney or whatever, or like pirates water smell, like that was  really, that wafted through the entire lobby. Oh, had to be.  And I believe, correct me if I'm wrong,  I think I saw the mention of like this and some  of the other attractions gone by 1996.  I think so, I think the main Luxor things made it a little  while. But 96 kind of, that's where it all started.  Unraveling. Because 96 is when all that Wizard of Oz theming we  talked about on Club 3, that's when that went away. And I think when  half of MGM Grand, nearly half of MGM Grand Adventures was gone.  So 96 was a big like sober up moment for this weird  family time. Boat rides gone, most of MGM Park is gone.  But you could probably feel, like it always seemed to me, Theme Park Vegas,  Family Vegas, it seemed like by the second or third week of running  this stuff, they were like the contempt, the people running  it probably just had for this stuff, you know? Yeah, really.  The idea, again, just from somebody who you get done with your long drive,  you've probably got bags with you, you're waiting to check in,  you check in and the next thing you have to do is wait in a 90 minute line  to get on a boat just to dump your shit.  And keep in mind you don't have to, you could just  walk to the elevators, which undoubtedly will be faster.  Well sure, yes. So this notion of  transportation boat ride is just defeated instantly.  Yeah, but they were obviously encouraging, I would assume a lot of people  wanted to do the boat. Because you go, we're going to this big crazy hotel,  let's get in line for the boat. But then the boat takes 90 minutes and you got your shit  and you just drove. It's not even like, oh we hop right on the boat, we go right to the room  or whatever. The idea of this extra  two hour chunk before you get to your room is crazy.  I don't know who thought this was a good idea. The larger Vegas casino  hotels, I am skeptical of  the relaxing, like when it's like New York, New York is a little  like this too, where it's like, oh if you're in that tower you have to cross the casino  floor with your luggage to check in.  Yes, that drives me nuts with a lot of these places. Because the thing we like about Park MGM  is like the check in desk is right there, right behind it is the  elevator bank. Yes, you know exactly where it is.  I was at Bedaro, which is part of Aria and that's completely the deal there too.  You don't have like the silly fun, but you're close to the silly fun.  You can maybe get a little calmer escape. Not a bad thing.  Yeah, this is crazy. So they stopped making  this, they threw out the transportation element of it and it just had to become a  ticketed boat ride called Nile River Adventure. But I don't think there was much  to the adventure. Because it wasn't supposed to be, it was just like going through  hallways. Some of them quite narrow. It's a little creepy. You go through like very  little, because probably right above you people are walking by to the rides of the restaurants or  whatever. So there's some low clearance. And then like  a guy on board, all of them, there's somebody on board, like Storybook Land.  I only found one video and they are  not making jokes really. This is like real, they're pointing out real hieroglyphic  stuff. But it's all fake and they're trying to incorporate  sometimes the mythology of the rides that we'll get to.  Our main archaeologist, Mack McPherson,  was spotted around these parts. Which again, I love. This is  so on my alley. This dumb boat ride in this part, like connects to the other.  Love it. But it's being said by this gruff Brian Doyle Marie  sounding guy who does not seem to be thrilled with having to  parallel. And then there's no animatronics. You don't like encounter, it's  a pirates without anything to look at besides stuff that you could just walk past  in the hotel anyway. They thought that, yeah, they thought the idea of  it being transportation would be enough.  Obviously they didn't think it was just going to be a ticketed ride, but they thought they didn't have any  foresight that that boat ride should have some sort of really unique  theming or robots or anything to it. Yeah, anything.  Yes, it's just, it's pointing out hieroglyphics that are  not ancient. They were put up there three months ago.  Similarly, this place also had a recreation of King Tut's  tomb, which are like, why? Who would care if it's not a real,  well, what if I told you it was green lit by the Egyptian ministry  of antiquities and they oversaw it to make sure it was like  the real tomb? Well, I would say still then  it's just a, if it's a simulation of a real tomb, but it doesn't have like a  mummy trying to get out of the tomb and try to send me to hell and spit scarabs  at me, then why bother to make it realistic?  It's a very good point. Really weird. Some of these, I'll say quote-unquote  artifacts, because they were all recreations  when they were closing stuff down or pulling back on it, they did donate  to a local Vegas museum, so that's nice.  You can see, so now a real museum has a fake King Tut tomb. Has fraudulent  artifacts. I think there's still  some sort of like King Tut exhibit.  In the Luxor, with the Titanic  and with bodies, you know. Okay, okay. And the  fantasy, the topless review.  That's at Luxor? I didn't see, I forgot to go see it.  You did? Yeah. Just kidding, I didn't see bodies,  I didn't see dead bodies and I didn't see nude bodies.  Well, they were both nude actually. It all sounds a little  bawdy. That does it. Bodies. A couple spellings  in place. That's my new, yeah.  Did you scribble that on the feedback card when you were like checking out?  Put clothes on those bodies. Every time  I walked to the Luxor, I was like angry or for some, like I was just like  oh, I just like, get me, transport me to the other side is dumb place.  So there's no boats. The idea was you get all,  you would just wait 90 minutes for a 15 minute boat ride. Yeah.  Yeah, rest your feet. But it was not to be. But, look,  ultimately, you know, if there were some flawed concepts  here, it's because the big money was put into the center  piece. The trilogy of attractions, of  high end theme park attractions, secrets of the Luxor  pyramid. And again, we will recommend the special that's on YouTube,  the making of Luxor. I think that'll find it for you.  And where you can watch the creation. They have cameras present for  every step of putting together really high end, the highest  end outside of Disney Universal. Maybe higher than some of what they  were doing at the time. Yeah. This was top tier stuff.  Plopped into this casino to be mostly unappreciated.  The work they put in for, the work they put into  the appreciation ratio has to be off the charts.  I don't know how to explain. You know what I'm saying? The amount of work, the amount of  effort versus the amount of people that actually gave a shit.  Yeah. When you compare it to like. It's just so much versus so little, I assume. Same era.  Indiana Jones Adventure. Right. And it is like,  it comes out to rave reviews and people still are just like, trembling  when they, I love it so much in reunion panels and it's the great,  I want to take my kids on it and pass it along and they refreshed it  and they, I, like the emotion present in, and I'm not  saying these were better than that, but it was like  top tier themed entertainment talent. Yeah. Getting nothing.  Did anybody tell him I liked it?  It's possible no. I guess I'll say if somehow someone  is listening who's part of these, I can't say I liked it because I didn't go.  I wish I could have gone. These seem incredible. Yeah. 100%.  The thing I had always heard about it was the one guy  associated with Douglas Trumbull who worked on  Back to the Future the Ride. Directed it. He's the reason for  like, the reason for the premise. He saved it. It was like  potentially going to be a disaster that just made people nauseous.  They built a theater that was not to his liking and he's like, what can we do?  And he figured out how to make it work. And he remade that  one of the greatest rides ever. Yeah. And I think another was known  for the special effects on close encounters of the third kind.  2001. 2001. 2001. Yeah.  Blade Runner. Star Trek motion picture. At some point went to  left Hollywood and started working  more in themed entertainment. Under the shadow of  Natalie Wood's death which occurred while he was directing her in a movie. Dear  God. Yeah. And he like, I'm sure I said this before, but yeah, he's  just on the record. Like, and after what happened to Natalie, I just, I didn't want to be in this town  anymore. And I, crazy. Can you imagine that? You're like, no. You were the  person with her when this still mysterious thing occurred.  Wait, he wasn't on the boat. No, no. You just mean he was working? Yeah. I was like, wait, I didn't read that.  I can't believe what happened. What someone else  did and I won't say who, but you can, hey, it's up to you to  go ahead and do your own story together. Check out this big miniature.  It's pretty funny, right? It's giant, but it's tiny. The rides are gonna be fun.  That's what we should focus on. But no, a giant in  the field of early special effects. Yeah. Who, and also in  experimenting with different frame  rates to create different crazy effects. So you don't  have, I don't think, what Peter Jackson later did or  James Cameron later did with, you know, not standard  frame rates without this guy. And especially in this ride  forum, because he started doing everything 60  frames a second, which did not happen much then, but  worked really well for ride purposes. Yeah, one of the attractions  that, the names of the attractions, by the way, Insert of the Obelisk,  Luxor Live and Theater of Time. Insert of the  Obelisk, kind of the straight, more straightforward simulator ride,  Luxor Live, like starts as a talk show with in-person  actors and then becomes more like CG  footage and then Theater of Time is like, that's  the future one. That one I think pretty quickly replaced with just an  IMAX theater. Regular IMAX. Yeah. So it's all  screen based, but in this like,  you know, when that was nearly impossible to do  in a way that really worked and where you needed people  who were part scientists to do the math and to  build the domed screens. What they had to do to do  this, because, okay, so he, for Back to the Future, the ride  was not happy. He had to like, we already built the theater, we're stuck,  can you save it? And he had to like work around that. He got to build these theaters  from the ground. This guy had a huge say in the layout of the Luxor  in general. Was involved in building the theaters. He was  involved in creating a custom robot to paint  the screens so that the screens were even and you could  light them correctly, which is also admirable. And then  you just read about the history of this, that like, the film started going to shit, that nobody  was maintaining it properly, which happens so often.  Like it's so, I appreciate the optimism that  we can put a really top tier technical process  in this casino and that somebody will take care of it. Because  I don't, I think a year in, maybe less, maybe as soon as  Doug Trumbull left town, they're like, alright, and put a 14 year old in there and  we aren't good. You know it got bad so fast.  Unless he was, I wonder like, does he, how long does he even stay on  I don't think this is documented at all, but like how long does he get contracted for  past opening? Okay, it all works. Does he  check in on it every six months or after a year he's out? Maybe not, because  if there's no, yeah, assuming there's no new money in it for him to  then why would you? He can't. I think  the whole thing was part of, I found another interview with him where he was saying this was part of  something, okay, he coined this term. He was imagining  a world full of high impact entertainment centers.  He wanted there to be a ton of things like what he did  in Luxor. Every city has something like this where it's a theme park  and it's high end original movies with a story and that was part  of it to him. He thought of making them all correlated. They said we want three rides,  he said the rides should be connected so that you get more invested in these characters  as you go. You know Schomburg was going to have one of those.  I suspect somewhere around me would have had one Glendale Galleria or whatever.  Like, we're King of Prussia Mall. We all, if he got in his way,  we would have had such insane arch stories  that our dads don't understand and we're  begging to keep going back to these weird things that are too adult for us  and scare us, but we're chasing the scariness. God, I wish he'd got  his vision of the world. I really have to get behind here  because he's, we've said this from day one on this podcast, like  more stuff like this and just like malls. It's exactly what he wanted.  Film based micro theme parks in shopping malls,  multiplexes and casinos. That was his whole detailing of his  vision. Any bit of it that we ever see, we're like, oh look,  one of those. He wanted there to be everywhere. There was the Vi, I mean,  there was, you know, Disney Quest. They wanted it everywhere.  Blockbuster. Blockbuster had that entertainment  and there was only ever one, maybe two of them. What's that called?  Entertainment City? Something like that, yeah. And there  were Sega in Australia. I think there was a Sega  sponsored thing. There were multiple kinds of things in Japan. There was a Sega thing here. There was  something called Virtual Land in Luxor too. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Where you could get  in those like orbs that spin around and go 360. Oh yeah,  massive arcade here. Yeah, yeah. And rides and  three attractions, a boat ride, like they were going for the Disney  dollar here. Oh god. If I ever, just listener, wherever  you live, just imagine where you know it would be and imagine  what year it would have disappeared. Yeah. Probably 96 to  99 sometime. Imagine what the fond memories you would have  in 1995 of going to this barely attended  too dense of story theme park near you, you know,  in whatever, in like Glendale, Arizona. Right. I,  oh god, oh the world of these I wish was there. There's, I still,  we're not done yet. This still is trying, like it's not the same thing,  but like the void was trying even though now that's over. Like this is still  an idea to put so much more themed garbage everywhere.  Yeah. I think it can, as we get older and as we  theme park pill our kids more, I feel like we're just  priming the world for it. And as shopping malls die, and  we don't know what else to do with them, they're big crazy spaces, why not  just turn them into, you know, Meow Wolf we were saying on the second gate  is a good, you know, they're trying to do these off the beaten path. The thing is, you know,  crazy experiences in, you know, not the three  primary cities and without like a billion dollars to do them.  I'm hopeful. And how long did that Austin Powers Bar last  in Glendale? That's a themed bar that lasted a couple years. Enough  for me to go a couple times. I think I went twice. For me to feel some sticky textures of chairs.  Yeah. See some shady people. Yeah.  Yeah. Yeah. The dreamers of the world, the trumbles and the  powers is. The fake powers is. The unauthorized Austin Powers  Bar. Oh, there was an unauthorized Star Wars bar on Hollywood Boulevard.  Oh, it's still going. I believe so. Kevin Smith does his shows there still.  Oh, okay. Pretty sure. I'm pretty sure I see him in front of. So the dream is alive. Yeah.  I'm pretty sure I see him in front of like the bar. Like the mausoleum looking bar  when he's talking, talking about flicks. Okay.  So I think it's still there. I'm saying that it exists. This idea  exists. It's not dead. Douglas Trumbull had a dream and I think  it's still alive. Does Kevin still have a key to the Kevin Smith podcast lounge  on the top floor of the John Lovitz Comedy Club, formerly  Wizards, you know. What is it now? What is it now? It's nothing.  It's nothing. It's a bunch of boxes. It's storage and the signs. Bats and bats.  Is it the third floor of the. I thought it was.  Yeah. So in the circle in the bamboo ceiling  area, it was the third floor. It was like at above Carl's. It was later. It was added on  later. I know, but we're actually, this is really, I would like to know, do you know specifically where it was?  I don't know. I was never there. I wasn't either and I feel bad that  I wasn't. There's no diagrams of this. There's no Martin's vids breaking down  where the Smodcast theater was. But it had to be like above the  what is it now? What is Carl Strauss now? Oh, it's  Starbucks, isn't it? Starbucks. It's a Starbucks.  So above the Starbucks maybe was where John Lovitz. I think you know, no, the other side.  It's above the. It was next to. Johnny Rockets.  Oh, OK. I think. And then Wizards, because Wizards, you see the pictures  of the. But Wizards was the Carl Strauss in Starbucks.  Or am I completely my geography? I don't know.  This, it's not well recorded. Interesting.  It's almost like they thought no one would care about this. No one should even  we don't need to write down one bit of where any of this is. It's like we have to do, it's like  we're going to have to do more city walk, though. Yeah.  Let's keep moving.  Let's talk about what these actual rides were.  So they're all there's like a there's like a kind of an aesthetic  that is strewn through all of them, which is  like the future of Egypt. And you hear people mention  in the special how it is the like millions of  years down the road version of Egyptian  technology where like they're like anything that the Egyptians  thought of now is in use in the highest tech way  and it works great. So every all tech, all human technology  is ancient Egypt based. But also don't do they say at  some point and this is a society that came before Egypt  where it actually got less technologically advanced. Yes, they  do say that. And because they say the pyramids are like less good versions  of what were originally built. I think they say both.  The Luxor is supposedly like a better pyramid than the real pyramids that were  built because it was built by the people before the  whatever society before the ancient Egyptians.  So your hotel is shittier than whatever was there  before that we don't remember. No, no, the hotel is better.  The hotel is better than those fucking garbage pyramids in Egypt  and the crap old casinos. Yeah, yeah. Then the real pyramids.  I'm sorry, then the crap old pyramids. Yes, that's right.  I think that's what I got from the special at least. Wow. Okay. So we're  introducing like an entire race of people  that has mostly vanished and then also a whole  future based on ancient technology. Yes.  All right. So Dad with a big yard, are you  ready now? So are you ready to learn about ancient but future  technologies and peoples? Yes, yes. Dad who just wants to  gamble and just take a nap.  Gamble with the big cup. The cup that had your quarter.  Yeah, your coins. Oh man, yeah. Do you miss the big cup?  Did you ever do the big cup? Growing up so close to Atlantic City,  there were definitely relatives who would like, if we would see them  they'd be like, hey, here's a big cup. You know, this is good for the beach.  And honestly, the big cups were good for building sandcastles.  Oh, so you get their big coin cup but it was empty. Yes. And I hope  cleaned before anything was drank. Oh, cleaned. My mom was definitely big on like,  yeah, clean that because it's probably disgusting. Yeah, clean your  coin cup. Clean the coin cup before you take it to the beach.  So, first one, you were  supposed to do this in an order. Yes, yes. And Doug Trumbull was  frustrated that they did not force people to do it in the order  that he wanted. I love this maniac. Yeah, I was able to do the second one first  and the third one, the second, and I went, oh, it all went haywire.  So, but if you did it under Trumbull's vision, you started  within search of the obelisk. Can we even  How would, I don't think I am capable of describing  the story of in search of the obelisk. These things, and they're not  There's precisely one video of the actual ride other than brief  clips in the special and it is like, it's somebody filming one  corner of the screen. You don't know what the hell is going on. Yeah. It's tough.  Let's try to, as if sifting through ancient ruins, can we put it together?  Okay, you're in a ride vehicle that is called the monolith?  The monolev. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Mono-lev.  A monolith is a full, I know. I believe the architect character is like  oh, I guess you're coming with me. Mack. Yes.  Yes, an archaeologist. Yes. Mack.  Wait, I had it earlier. His last name. It was Mack.  Tonight. It's Mack McPherson. Okay. It's Mack McPherson.  And then you've got Cricket. No, that was just the one woman doing the ride. Cricket's not in the video.  Cricket's not in the rides. And then you've, he has, Mack has a friend  named Karina. And Karina is gone because she is in search  of the obelisk. So we need to find Karina  because she's my friend. Right. And maybe in doing so  also get the obelisk. Now I don't know what is crucial about  this obelisk. Maybe we don't know yet, actually. Yeah. That might be something we don't  learn until Luxor Live. So  do we miss anything? Well, I mean there's like villains. Well, yeah, you go through, well, okay,  just like what happens, I guess. Yeah, yeah. But yeah, with the villains you want to.  Well, I don't know. I just, I don't really know what they are. He's fighting a villain, like Mack, so  you're in a basic simulator, like Back to the Future something. And on the screen  Mack is basically on the front of your vehicle.  So it makes it look like he's hanging out like right on the tip or the hood of your  obelisk. He's on there with you. Yeah. Or model. Kind of surfing it.  Does he steer it? He like has a steering mechanism. Yeah. Yes. Up there too.  From the pictures, that's sort of what I can decipher. And yeah,  you're going through like a grimy looking  practical effects sets shot with cameras.  Giant miniatures, motion control cameras.  And by the way, like, you know, regardless of story, which is  hard to figure out, the cool thing is if you like Back to the  Future the Ride very much, it is same director and thus it is  really similar aesthetic, shot on similar film, shot on  same kind of camera. Like just the  degree of visual effects are very similar. And like compositing  and the way he lights it and the way light is treated. And Alan  Silvestri score as well. So this was kind of a  second Back to the Future ride that was only in Las Vegas.  So that's pretty notable. It is. Yeah. And it is. It is. Look, it looks some of some of the  scenes almost look like Mortal Kombat, the movie I've talked about Mortal Kombat  recently. Yeah. A fan of Mortal Kombat. You've seen Mortal Kombat, Jason? I  years ago. You got to watch it. Yeah, I got to rewatch. We should. There's some broader  way. I mean, we will certainly throw in movies that we want to watch. Yeah.  And talk about them, especially on the second game. But is there some way to frame it that it's like the PTR  Canon? Just that we are we talking about the films that we think are the most fundamental to us  as people, but also better the most theme parky and the most in line  with like. Oh, yeah. Like David Hasselhoff, Nick Fury.  Yeah. I mean, I've never seen it. I'll put it in the PTR Canon. I can only assume.  But if people are down for more of that  then you get some Batman forever, I would imagine. Well, of course. Yeah, you'd have to.  If you have a better name, if you have a name for the PTR Canon, throw it out there too. Good question.  But mainly find proof of the fans. That's  task number one. I send you in search of the fans as Karina is  in search of the obelisk.  I love I do love what I can see from this. Yeah.  Yeah. Big fights happening on the front of the going through like  it's an underground pyramid and there's a bunch of giant floating  obelisks, but not ones you can grab. Yeah, those are like  levitating. You got to weave through them and not crash the I almost  think there's no I'm trying to think and back to the future. No one's ever on the  hood of the car and back to the future. No. Yeah, that's a lot more ambitious. All the  characters are on the screen in front of you. So that's way more ambitious. This is almost like a precursor  to Spider-Man, the Islands of Adventure ride.  Where you're really getting it's a simulator, but you're getting characters up front  which gives you that, you know, personal touch that you might want from  a dark ride. Intimacy. Intimacy, if you will. Well, some of the  stuff is also precursors to like the  soaring fly like they figured out like, OK, here's how we do kind of a  flying theater before the soaring flying  theater comes along. Yeah. Yeah. Also you mentioned Spider-Man  a company that worked on that later worked  on this called Kleiser-Wolzak. Oh, I did do that.  Also part of Honey Has Shrunk the Audience, part of Azillian Things and seems like  one of them is a prolific director, but one of either Kleiser or Wolzak  built the sculpted the Michael Jackson history  statue. Really? Remember that? Remember when they were sending big scary  statues all over the globe and one of them is still in a McDonald's  parking lot? Oh yeah. In possibly Russia? Am I making  that up? It's definitely somewhere weird. I don't know. There's still  Michael Jackson's scary statues floating out there all over this world  of ours and made by the same, which I understand like aesthetically I see  what you know, the big ancient ruins and statues make sense. So  you have, yeah, some Spider-Man folks cut their teeth on these. To keep  in perspective the CG and the footage  stuff, at one point they talked to like the engineer, like the  computer guys working on this and they're like, and we've got a specially  made computer and like one image from this is 90  megabytes and that would fill up someone's home PC  instantly. Oh my God. And it's like, I think  I clipped, I think I screen recorded a clip from the special  that probably is like around 90  megabytes. Oh it's got to be more probably depending. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. No, our notes files.  Like 20 seconds of HD footage, of HD footage  of standard death special. My God. Yeah. Wow.  There is some bad looking CGI in this too. Oh yeah. But that's  to be. You got some typical mummy kind of,  right. But there's so much practical stuff and it looks, it just looks  like a weird kind of low budget 90s  movie like this. I don't know. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, totally.  Which is, you know, and it's shot well where you even take, you know,  even like some dumb movie is still like,  is there a movie called like the Great Panda Adventure? Does that sound familiar?  Let me not go into that movie. What about like Warriors of Virtue? Even Warriors of Virtue  shot on beautiful pristine film movie. Yeah.  Nobody's really seeing or liking. Apologies to Virtue heads out there.  The poster for the ride looks bad, I would say. Yes.  The poster looks shitty. I think the cityscapes look best.  Cause they're just practical miniatures. What you're showing looks like some  like creepy. It's like,  I was gonna say a Christian movie, but I mean like the shadiest  of Christian movies. A Christian movie with an agenda.  It's the ships that the Animorphs travel in, you know,  on the covers. There's things I like about the poster, but the poster overall  doesn't look as cool as it should. Pretty cruddy.  There's somebody named Claggart and he's yelling  get off of Claggart! But I don't really know what  Claggart is. And then there's also, there's another enemy whose name  is Dr. Osiris. I forget if he's part of this  first one or if you meet him later. But Dr. Osiris is also part  of the Luxerverse. The secretverse.  The Piraverse. I'm not sure which verse it is.  Do you think, cause I don't know, I forget what year  MGM bought this, but does MGM now own the IP  of all of this? Oh fuck. Probably. I don't know. Or does Circus Circus  still? Or yeah maybe. And what is Circus Circus anymore? Did Circus Circus  get swallowed into something? Cause the hotel itself I think is only  that. I don't think they are major landholders in general.  Yeah maybe. So yeah, does like Circus Company, I think the name  was the Circus Company maybe? Could be. Before, yeah did they own Mac  and Dr. Osiris? Dr. Osiris. I'm now, I love a good  crazy doctor name. Yeah. I want to know what else can be done  with Dr. Osiris. Yeah we'll put that into the- I don't think I know what he looks like or how to find  a picture of him or if anyone saved a picture of him. Doesn't matter, we'll re-imagine  that. I love his name. I think Circus Circus might technically  be under the MGM brand. Is that right? Cause I think it shows up  in some of those iPhone games. You can go  to Circus Circus. Oh right, right, right. Yeah maybe. That's probably right  if they're showing up there. They might be trying to sell it off although  if you look up Luxor and like  there's lots of Google question results of like will the Luxor  be destroyed? Like will it be demolished or closed?  Yeah will it suck inside itself and go to another realm? Yeah.  There's talk about different floors being like, has the basement  been condemned? Wait a minute.  I was just gonna say MGM bought it in 2007 so like all this stuff was long gone  but I wonder if in the language of the sale they  said and we also buy the rights in perpetuity to Dr.  Osiris, Carina, Mac,  the Obelisk. The Obelisk itself, the Maglevs. Yeah right.  Yeah. Is it just floating out order? And if they ignore it, I say if you  find that contract and you do a little find and search and you don't  find Dr. Osiris or Maglev that means they're up for grabs and  we can make a very frustrating graphic novel about all of this.  Oh yeah. Yeah. Oh and trust me any of the publishers  that would, there's a lot of indie comics  publishers now that it's like yeah we'll get your comic out, we'll get a public  and they like pay dog shit rates and they're like and of course  we'll keep the intellectual property and we will immediately  start selling it to the major studios. No way. We're not doing that.  We have to learn the lesson of Aaron Fector who would not give up his  intellectual property of his characters, the beloved  Rock of Fire explosion and he kept them and he holds them proudly  they're the greatest weapon in his arsenal. Oh my goodness. As soon as he figures out  anything anybody wants to do with them he's back on top.  He crushes Chuck E. Cheese because he wouldn't let them pilfer  his valuable IP. Don't count him out yet.  He's scheming in that warehouse that has room for 400 people but  it's just him and a bunch of like Billy Bob's robot  oil spilled everywhere. He has a bunch of rotting Billy Bob's  that will sometimes move and he's like oh is it coming, is my creation  becoming real and then just a bunch of rats crawl out of it.  He could have had some of the Five Nights at Freddy's money, he could have had  like the at least the current weird Alf where it's like oh  yeah, Alf's back. They're doing some short  they're doing mobile commercials? Yeah the Mint Mobile like Ryan Reynolds  has teamed up with Alf for Mint Mobile commercials. That's so freaking epic.  Yeah, you better believe it.  Okay I think that covers In Search of the Obelisk  except, spoiler, you do not get the Obelisk.  You get what's important. You save Karina, Mac's best friend  or lover or associate or maybe he has better friends. I don't know.  Karina matters to Mac and you get her. On to the Maglev.  But you don't get the Obelisk. So we're still in search of the Obelisk  after In Search of the Obelisk. Do they call in that special, do they call like the  two of them like quintessentially 90's or something? No maybe. They describe  then? They say that within the 90's? Maybe they don't say quintessential but they definitely  say both of them are like typical 90's people.  And by that they mean white? I guess. Yeah, the most generic  white humans. Boring?  So then if you continue  the story or if you realize that this is what you're supposed to do  apparently, I think this footage where you enter the ride and it says episode  one really big on it as if like, so you get it? These rides  are episodes and I think the tourists partially drunk probably  did not. But if you went to episode two that was Luxor  Live. Luxor Live is an out of this world talk show where you will behold  a fabulous 3D solar eclipse. It's kind of like a campy  version of Geraldo. Now I'm lost.  What does this mean? Now I'm in! I just don't think I get it.  Luxor, okay, so and now we're in the present. That's the idea.  The idea here is that Luxor, the casino you're staying at, has  a live Geraldo-esque talk show. Yeah. And  It's not like the serious Geraldo show that you're used to.  The straight ahead, very played, like a news  piece of serious news Geraldo show. No, no, no. This was the wild  times with the weirdos where he's getting into fights. Yeah.  I guess. So, alright. The visitors  are part of a studio audience of a fake TV talk show with a debate  between, well when Luxor Live, today Luxor Live,  alright everybody having fun at the casino, you're hanging out by the pool. Well today we've got a treat  for you. We've got archaeologist Mac McPherson and Colonel  Claggart and they are going to have a debate about ruins  and whether we should use technology to get  items from the past and bring them to modern times.  I guess, I guess. Yeah. I suppose. This all happens  in front of a talk show set that has a Johnny Carson-esque  cityscape but it is not of Hollywood.  It is of the two properties that Circus Circus owns.  So there's a big Circus Circus clown and there is the Excalibur Castle.  And in this setting there is a debate about archaeology that happens  before a live studio audience. Now here's what I've always tried to figure  out. I first saw this special a few years ago.  Did they have the actor who played Mac McPherson  on retainer to be there in person or did they  just like, alright we need a white guy with brown hair.  They can't have right. And he's far enough away. Well they'd have to have  multiple Macs I would assume. I would assume. I think maybe that's the idea.  I bet. I bet that's just like Terminator 2 kind of deal.  I would think. Yeah. You couldn't count on Mac forever.  Something that I'm confused about though is when it transitions from  live to movie because a comment  I read somewhere, somebody described being there as a kid and then  thinking this thing was confusing and unremarkable until one of the actors exploded  into particles. And so then I don't understand.  I don't know if like what if all, it seems like it was live actors but what if some of it  was projected or I don't know or there was a screen in front of them that made a  I don't know. Whatever was going on here maybe this ended up being actually the coolest effects  wise due to the surprise of it. And then like the screen cracks apart  and you go into like a fully. It seems like Terminator 2. It does seem  like T2. Like that really like there's. You don't know it's screens  until something crazy happens. But then you watch a bunch of  Crystal dance. Oh I love the Crystal dancers.  They are touting the liquid. Are they Crystal dancers or liquid dancers?  I saw Crystal. Crystal figures. But I don't know what I got this from.  They are talking up those Crystal figure dancers in that special  as well where they're like and they like captured real life human  movements to make these new. Like they're really blown away  by these and obviously. They did MoCa. They did MoCa. Yeah essentially  original avatar. Yeah. Yes. But it sounds like  dry description of this. First liquid human beings  emerge from the life giving source of water then solidify into male  and female glass dancers moving in harmony. But they  soon grow wary of each other. Put on armor and start fighting.  Culminating in a nuclear blast. This is sounding  a little obtuse. A little or like  too pointed or I don't know.  I'm very. Would I love Luxor Live or  does Luxor Live collapse this entire experience? It's a good  question. I could see there being a lot of cringy stuff during Luxor Live  but I don't know that the dancers were as impressive as they thought.  But if somebody blew up into particles. It does look like the  eventual TLC waterfalls video.  Which was very impressive to the MTV viewers of 1995.  However, the technology was probably  better then. You accept things a little jankier in a  music video maybe. I don't know. This when I was  reading at Luxor I discovered. I had seen it years  ago but I didn't put it all together. Or it didn't  really mean anything to me. But the getting jiggy with it music  video is filmed in the Luxor lobby and then they're in front  of the Mirage volcano and then they're in front of New York, New York.  Yeah. It's kind of like traveling  all over but by way of just Las Vegas.  It really encapsulates that era and all of the big silliness  going on. And specifically the one side of Las Vegas Boulevard.  Yeah, yeah true. Does he not do kind of like walk like an  Egyptian dancing? Is he not in sort of a headdress?  I believe he is. He is and the backup dancers are. Yeah  there's a lot of Egyptian stuff.  Maybe he saw these shows and started thinking about like wow so there's some crazy  stuff out there. I should maybe pursue like you know I passed by this building  that said Scientology on it. I wonder if that has anything to do with  the. That's very possible. Is Colonel Claggart  part of that? Is there a scientist part of that obelisk obelisk in  Scientology? What are the secrets of the obelisk? Maybe Scientology will open me  up to those secrets. Is this Douglas Trumbull was just maybe trying to create a  religion based on an obelisk? Maybe obeliskology. Yeah  this is different. The Luxor was going to be the center of obeliskology.  The celebrity center of his new religion. All hail the obelisk.  Did someone find the other like pop music connection?  No I didn't. That when Tupac Shakur was killed  in Vegas. He took a picture here the night I saw  he was staying here. Whoa. Oh I didn't know that.  He gets killed elsewhere in Vegas.  He was staying. Someone of his wealth at the time  was staying at the crappiest hotel. Well maybe  in 96 it was still okay. I don't know. Wow. Do you think  I'll just type it into Google. Did Tupac meet Dr.  Obelisk and Colonel Claggart? Did he go to the rides?  Very good question. That's so creepy. There is a room at that hotel  that is the, it could have been where you were staying where it was  like the room that Tupac did not return back to that night.  Jesus. My God. Yeah. This place really  is, this place does need to fold into itself.  Like a priest needs to come or an army of priests from different  religions. From a real religion. Yeah from the good religion, Christianity  the one that makes sense. The ultimate 90's religion.  Get the top priest from each state and  get them over to Luxor to get the spirits out of there.  Everyone hold hands, surround the building. Yes. Then and only then  will it return. Now of course Carrot Top can keep playing there. He's not part of the  curse. No he's good. He helps fend off the curse. He balances the  life. He balances the bad with the light. Carrot Top is a force of light.  Wikipedia says so Tupac was at the Tyson  fight at the MGM Grand and then there was a brawl  and it says after the brawl Shakur returned to his hotel, the  Luxor Las Vegas. Wow. He went back there? Yeah.  He stopped there first. Whoa. That's insane.  I believe he was killed closer to Flamingo Road. I forget the  intersection. Yeah I've been there. I was in a cab and somebody was like  you know where we are. Oh god. East Flamingo Road and Koval  Lane. Koval. Wow.  Crazy. He might have waited the 90 minutes for the boat ride.  Maybe he got them. Maybe they're like oh we'll take you.  They should have let him cut the line. He could have met Cricket.  Or he got. Tupac and Cricket could have met on this  if he'd been on the boat ride. If he'd done it. If he'd been patient  and then waited. What if he like then people were like looking for him but he's  having a blast on the boat. Yeah it's possible. He's in a secret  tunnels of the Luxor. Anything's possible. Do you think a crew guy  on the Will Smith video is like you know Tupac was staying here when he was killed. It's like  Jesus don't tell me that. Like  a fucking haunted Egypt hotel. That was what  cursed Will ultimately. That's what led to what happened 30 years later.  Took a while. It took a while to manifest.  Okay so now. Well basically the special says like  the audience shares Karina's discovery of the true meaning of the obelisk.  Okay again. It's hard to imagine.  Okay so now Nell armed with my knowledge of the true  meaning of the obelisk. Now I can proceed to the theater of time.  And the theater of time is set. So this  I don't know if you stole it on this too. You encounter a big sign and the sign  says enlightened society for global transformation.  Which also sounds like a Scientology. I was going to say the full logo looks like Scientology.  It really does. The phrase looks like Scientology.  This might have. I'm deciding it. This open Will Smith's  This started him on the path. This picture that I'm showing  of the sign. This is what would greet you as you entered the theater of time. And now  it is at the neon museum. This is sitting around somewhere.  If you go there in Vegas, which I'm not but I would like to. I'd like to see that sign because it's actually  a lot like Alien Encounter or something. It's very like very 90's theme park.  And then. And this was a. This was like a  screen tipped. Like movie screens are thin and  long ways. Imagine if you turn that. If you went 90 with it. If you go  90. If you do Quibi freestyle. You turned it on its head. They did  it. So it was a big. It was a tall long screen.  Is what this was. A tall TikTok.  I think of it as the original TikTok.  And eventually this just became a real IMAX theater. They just like  put more screen on there. Why do we have just one. We can only play one kind of  movie. Much like what befell Quibi ultimately. Yeah.  Maybe having some more flexibility in what you could show here is good. There's not a lot  about theater of time. Did you guys. I don't really understand what's  happening in this one. It seems. Is this a mainly a sit down movie?  But with a little bit of movement. It's not a full simulator.  Yeah. It seems like it's just sort of an IMAX.  Like a little bit of an elevated IMAX. I guess.  I've seen some of this stuff. Seen a little proof of concept.  I think it was. Cause he's like this is my chant.  I have like. Doug Trumbull found this rare pile of money.  To prove his high impact entertainment center concept.  And I wish it had been proven better.  I know. It's like I admire his big reach  for the nonsense. Like just doing this much dumb nonsense.  But it's yeah. It's like if it just it was a little bit more accessible.  At the very least it could have lasted longer than this stuff did.  Well it's obviously mobsters versus mummies. That is the  very clear story. Much like Pirates of the Caribbean. You know what it is  when you're going into it. He should have had the idea that we just had 30 years later.  I agree. The only other pitch I had on it is that he licensed William Shatner's  Tech War. Of course the William Shatner verse.  It is surprising Tech War is not part of Luxor.  Like today. Oh not today. Oh good.  Visit the Tech War experience. It will open in 2006.  The William Shatner supposedly created future story of the illegal  drug known as Tech. Is it just in our world or  like it's not. Tech War is not in another universe. I believe it's in the future  but I actually don't know if it's in another universe or not. Okay. Yeah. Tech War is definitely  in the canon. Tech War is in the PTR canon for sure.  Because there's a variety of things we need to watch and read.  I want it filmed at the Eden Center in Toronto. Well I'm on board.  The future as seen through a big tall mall. Sounds good to me.  Hey that you know I got a couple things. One Douglas Trumbull  credited it with working on the first flight simulator ride.  Which I think you can see footage of online. It's called Tour of the  Universe and it was in the basement of the CN Tower.  Of the Tower. In Toronto. Pre-Star Tours. Pre-Star Tours.  The other thing you know we were speculating about like how did Luxor  get made. How did this all happen. And there's  a clip in that special.  This is Clyde Turner. He's the president of Circus Circus  Enterprises. And this is I mean when you see this clip  when you hear him talk about it it's just the most dynamic thing you've ever  encountered. But the vision is somewhat big.  And what happens is that you then seek out the best and the brightest  of all you can find. And you have intense brainstorm sessions.  And out of that comes ideas. He's just describing  the creative process. If that's making you like  you're probably electrified hearing that 20 second clip of  this man who appears to be falling asleep on camera.  And then it cuts to the table.  It cuts back and forth between the table of like this is the casino manager. This is Douglas  Trumbull. This is an engineer. And it's the.  You've never seen so many receding hairlines in one place. No offense.  No shade fellas. I'm right there with ya. But it's like  yeah there ain't a woman or a person of  color around for miles and miles.  Sure. Yeah well look this  thing I don't think it went away right away. I don't remember when they start. I think you know  it just the theater of time became a regular of  IMAX theater. I'd like to know more about theater of time but it's not. You can watch a big clip  of it on one of those Mind's Eye videos that keeps coming up. You can watch a big  extended like a minute and a half sequence of it. And it's very impressive. It's very  you know what it's like. It's like being in Hill Valley 2015 in  the Back to the Future ride but you're not rushing through it. And there are cars and stuff  coming at ya. None of that exciting shit. What if you could just hover above  a gentle Hill Valley future. I like that. Sure. It's pretty  cool. But then I take it back there is one woman and one person  of color at the table of bald men. Not a single. No one's gonna be found.  I just wanted to clarify. You're sexist racists. Wouldn't allow them in the room.  I just wanted to clarify. They were stuck at the door. Get out of here.  These very bald men did let a couple people.  You were right about the baldness. Yeah I was right about the baldness.  So these things start disappearing.  The attractions they can't really get rid of these facilities. They're  baked into the building like certain theme park like Yeti.  So they started using it for other stuff. When I was first in  Vegas as a not child in 2006 I remember  that one of the presumably formerly the Obelisk ride was home to something  called Reboot the Ride. A ride based on the  early CGI television show. Reboot the Ride is maybe  worthy of its own episode. I don't know. I assume. I'm not gonna try  to rush some version here. But it was at  a number of theme parks I think. And somehow provoked  a second one. I'm sorry. Okay so it was at Adventure Dome  first. Formerly Grand Slam Canyon. My favorite name.  And then moved to the Luxor. And then somehow. I don't know  where this was. If it was the Luxor. Oh I think it was in Canada maybe somewhere. There was somehow  there was not only Reboot the Ride but later Reboot the  Ride V2 Journey into Chaos. So we got  two Reboot rides to grapple with with a full methal.  And unlike the Obelisk verse which nobody is tracking and taking care of  Reboot fandom is massive so we can find every detail.  So we'll get into that. Is Reboot doing Mint Mobile commercials  yet? I don't think so. I don't know. It's been calculated if he's epic  enough. Maybe Mac tonight. Or not Mac tonight.  The Mac and Me. Maybe if Alf meets Mac and  Me. How much does Mac cost these days? Ryan Menels  did do it. He's gonna do Biker Mice for Mars. That's true. That's not a joke.  Everything this guy does is so epic.  It's kind of like a Spiderverse version of. I shouldn't talk my name.  This could be a job for any of us. Oh yeah. I grew  up with Biker Mice. I loved the mice. I remember  all of their names and I'm checking my hand for an unrelated reason.  When the name them all. When the Biker Mice play an exhibition  game against Wrexham Football Club. Oh boy.  It's gonna be something. Welcome to Wrexham Biker Mice for Mars.  The weirdest thing though about all this.  The Luxorverse did not just stay in the rides.  There was also a CD-ROM. Which makes all the sense  in the world because this aesthetic of all of this is very CD-ROM. There was something  called Secrets of the Luxor. I took a shot of the box. It has  the pitch of what this thing would be. And it has all. By the way this is  Dr. Osiris. It's the characters. It's all of it.  This morning you were just another archaeologist exploring an ancient pyramid.  Just another archaeologist. Yeah.  Now you're 300 years in the future trying to convince a madman  not to blow up the sun. Some days you wish you  just stayed in bed. And I downloaded an emulator  of it. But I don't know why I have no emulator program. But anyway we can play Secrets of the Luxor.  Explore Dr. Osiris more fully. See if he's worth  trying to explore in an IP sense. I bet he. First of all we know he is.  But of course we need to watch. Or play. Excuse me. Not just watch.  This is. I wish  this had worked in some sort of way. I mean is there really like  I know we're simplifying it but is there a way if  everything was just better would it have stuck around in a way where it was like you can't  get rid of this. Or is just the nature of Vegas that everything is so disposable. That it's almost  impossible. Maybe then. Maybe if it was like due to the experiment  that like ultimately it's not a family destination. This is not a place to do  story rides. Yeah. Like that inherent footwear. I think this  could have worked. Maybe this you know this transforms Niagara Falls  and Myrtle Beach and all those cities where all the weird crap is.  It was just the wrong. It was the wrong market. But Drumble had to grab it while  he could. Much like an obelisk. See what power he could wield.  It is an admirable yeah. An admirable idea at the time.  If we're. The name Jim Grand Adventures  episode I brought up Blackjack rules. Hit stand. Double down. Cash out.  I think clearly the answer was double down. 100%.  Let's literally double. They didn't provide enough material to make us  care about Mac and Karina. They needed to do six attractions not three.  They should have added every year. They should have kept hitting and hitting  and hitting. And they should have gotten rid of the hotel rooms. Turn those into mazes.  You knock some of those out. Now there's nowhere for Tupac to stay. Maybe he changes his mind.  Doesn't come to Vegas. And we're still getting Tupac albums to this day. I mean we are  because he puts. He's the most prolific posthumous artist of all time. But I mean  actually new made by an alive Tupac. I think you've just yeah that's a future  that we can get behind. And if we had just gotten behind Douglas Trumbull's vision  that in his work like in his world you think  there were like every hotel had  interconnected like like you would see Mac in  different hotels in different contexts like you could believe this story into different  hotels. Yeah. Like in the grandest vision of everything.  It's a huge like Disney like see Disney not Disney see the theme park but  to see the organization which is decease. Now you go into a pre Rome universe  that was better than Rome and a future that uses Roman technology.  Right. And now Karina is in search of the column.  Of course the column. I'd love to see Mac help this would get the mag  Lev to help Karina find the column. The crossover potential  like the Avengers of the Vegas casino  universe. All different characters for each each one and then they all  get together and like they all meet up. Yeah. That experience  the slot machines and cheap drinks table games  shrimp cocktails that'll bring the people in you know. Yeah.  You got to give them something else to do. What do you do how do you make them stay with great  storytelling and the problem is there wasn't enough of this. They should have taken over  Mirage and that's about like a society of volcano people which  is that not kind of what Avatar 3 is going to be about. That is absolutely what it is.  I hope they would have gotten on that first that needy idea and then  like you know if they and if they didn't feel like well how are we going to come up  with all this volcano related mythology. Well it already exists. It's from the mind  of this writer Elrond Hubbard. Then you just plug in all the Dianetics  stuff. So now that's what I want. I want that it's 1998  and Douglas Trumbull is helping Elrond Hubbard achieve  his perfect cinematic three rides that tell the story of Dianetics.  You go into the volcano verse with Mac and  Karina. And the New York skyline these are these were buildings built before  the people built New York. They were early societies that  the ancient New York the ancient old Orchians. The ancient Orchians.  I don't know why I dropped the Y. Sure. Orchians. And  eventually that roller coaster what do they get.  Well they get you know Samsung  touch phones in VR lenses and it's  aliens. Oh right. It does become an alien thing. Yeah.  It was always heading there. The Trumbull is not supporting Trumbull.  Trumbull should have had three rides a trilogy of rides in every single hotel.  And that is the reason. And then it wouldn't be a gambling city  anymore. It would be Trumbulltown. Trumbulltown. Trumbulltown.  Well this makes me hate Las Vegas. This makes me want to get out of there. I agree.  I'm not going to talk about it anymore. But it's too late we're stuck.  And thus you survived podcast the ride Sin City Nights.  I wish it was Trumbulltown. I wish they would have changed the name for him.  There was this brief time where they flirted with gambling and they  hadn't discovered the power of storytelling and the power of the obelisk. Oh yeah.  Dark times. Yeah. But as it stands  because they didn't do it the Luxor should absolutely fold into  itself. Yeah. Oh yeah. Disappear and take all of the  lost souls with it. Or spit them back up. Bring  spit Tupac out on your way into crumbling. Yeah. I mean I  was just looking at it. Specifically the UFOs above in 2012 were orbs.  So the orbs could also absorb the whole  Luxor and take it back to its home planet or they could blow it up too.  Or implode it. Well now I told my wife and  child they could come back in the door because we've been recording forever. So now I'm going to actually wrap  up while they come in and probably as she washes my son's hands. So  you survived podcast the ride Sin City Nights. Sin City theme courtesy of Mike Carlson.
