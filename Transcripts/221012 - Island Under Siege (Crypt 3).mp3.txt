 Crypt Three Welcome to haunt cast the fright club freak?  Club freak?  I pose to you guys that's a pitch could be yeah I was like why don't we sort this out just in the  you know club freak like me because it's in the same universe yeah yeah it is a little  applicable characters well imagine like the logo that we have and then it's spray painted over  with freak yeah that could be okay yeah yeah but that's a little middling the other pitch is club  eek exclamation point do you okay did you encounter the phrase streaks and foons  okay so could be club treak oh I don't know if they have the copyright of club treak we I'm very  excited about treaks and foons but we are now marrying ourselves to something very obscure  well look it's it's another island so it is adjacent but I'm sure it was going to come up  eventually well let me look I'm not sure either of those are uh home runs so if there's something  else if it occurs to you now or we have to keep I mean we got only like a day to figure this out  but club club three headed dog you would like the like from hell like a cerebus uh-huh yeah how  about that club three headed dog that was a kind that's good so enthusiastic about anything yet  no one's been that jacked well yeah you know we'll sleep on it that's interesting it's interesting  that the listener will know what it is and when we don't currently um and if we landed at one of  those then you know we threw in the towel or maybe you have better ideas uh well we'll figure it out  we're at club something and uh today we are discussing the topic island under siege  which is a it's a it's the marvel scare zone from islands of adventure I will get into that  right after this just just to say this poll the most nail biter yes of a poll there has been  by because often what's happened you know look we spelled out what to do with garfield eats we  pretty much said hey you know vote vote for it we you know we might have cranked the meters  yes hi didn't do any politicking for this one seemingly no no I don't think anybody had a super  a super dog a three-headed dog in the fight I mean I was very pleased with the results it certainly  seems like something I would suggest yeah absolutely uh uh and then I'm delighted because  it's a thing I've never heard of and that's always good to stumble on too because if we exhaust  everything that we know about already in the podcast but if we find out about new things  it can go forever and ever forever uh forever um this one this topic won by five votes wow  that's how low that's how close of a margin with a lot of it with the highest voter turnout yet  uh people really came through that percentage is going up and up but just let that be a lesson don't  say that voting doesn't matter if any if anyone ever tells you according to twitter it seems like  there's a lot of people walking up to randos on the street and saying voting doesn't matter and  then they keep walking so if that ever happens to you don't listen because every vote counts in this  I thought we were maybe heading to to run off here but uh it squeaked it out yeah no it's a good point  and yeah for sure vote in every club three poll that's the number one thing you should vote for  yes this nove and the next one is november that's true so this november vote look I know you and you  might end up exhausted from voting so I understand if you only want to vote for one thing and of  course we want that one thing to be the topic hershel walker oh okay well depending on where you  live of course no no all right if you're there get the vote out for hershel yeah for hersh but  will one of his secret children be the deciding vote in he just by like you know like based on  stats it seems very possible that we have one of his secret children in the audience it's entirely  the audience is growing and it's like oh we could see a repeat of kevin costner's swing vote is it  kevin costner starring griffin newman yes yeah starring griffin newman yeah wait no no no no  that's oh he's oh he's the one yelling at the I got the weird kevin costner movie run but you  all agree that's that seemed right right to me uh-huh no not swing vote draft day draft day I  just want to say I there's a little slogan to remember to vote vote uh vote in okay wait vote  in the ptr no matter who you are that's the wait let's punch that up uh vote for club three and  ptr no matter who you are you know vote blue no matter who vote in club three or like vote  vote in club three no matter who are the okay that's better that's better better better good  punch up that's how it works that's how good ideas get formed maybe some of these creative  juices will eventually be funneled to whatever we're calling this uh yeah or you well no we  know the name of the episode we don't know the name of the thing we don't know what the yeah well  we'll put our heads together because we have to because we don't have a lot of time so uh the  runner-up which barely lost spirit halloween yeah moves to next halloween yeah so we'll put a big  pin in that and now we head into november need you to vote this november and we go back to non  spooky topics unless you still got really good spooky ones sure in the hole in your pocket but  let's open it up to uh to anything and uh the returning fighter of course is suggested by  william evans is uh that we watch all of bob iger's master class now that is a um 12 hour  endeavor is that is it longer or less long uh not sure i can look it up while we some of those are  like four hours i feel like but i don't know okay i think it depends i think it depends how much  wisdom the uh person has to impart yeah so or how much other work they have to do right oh no no no  13 video lessons totaling two hours and 11 oh okay that's not so bad and you know what i will  make a club three promise that in this case i will not tap out at 38 minutes okay this i'm  because this i can learn from yeah i truly thought these were like i i guess i was too  naive i thought these were like great courses plus you know you can borrow those on a few apps for  free on like library lending apps these are scams oh okay that makes sense these are big scams yeah  where's somebody sits for two hours and just does an interview and they cut it up got it yeah that's  true if you yeah i guess you would know well we'll find out well we will one of the things we would  report is does iger ever change his shirt which might indicate that a second day was put in or  at least like a shower i it doesn't feel like it no way um so that's the one to beat but uh will it  win i don't know depends on what you guys suggest so uh keep comments suggestions coming in the  comments we appreciate everything's been great as evidenced by this where all these things were so  close uh monster cereals in there too that i was rooting for that one but we'll but it goes to the  crypt now paul and paul paul and got really betrayed i feel like jason threw it out and  yeah uh-huh it seemed like the you know we weren't nudging people that hard but right i'm interested  to know i mean there's a it looks like it's a good split between what people's interests are because  there's i i'm impressed that marvel won not that i know marvel's popular and we like marvel a lot  but but it's a very this is not the marvel of today right this is this is very much a different  era this is coming out of bankruptcy era marvel and like license like handshake well not handshake  contract but like not not fully watching the shop marvel like nowadays which is beautiful which is  happened potentially yeah so this is an era where a little more fun was being had a little more  random fun was being had obviously yes there's a reason uh maybe it didn't happen again is because  there was too much fun being had but we will address that license well yeah let's talk about  that later because i got some bones to pick with that oh that theory bones all right here just as  a way in let me read the full suggestion and this was suggested by eric b madden island under siege  the short-lived marvel superhero island scare zone that featured carnage and dead superheroes  yeah that is the an entry point and a nice synopsis um didn't know about it until now um basic stuff  about it 2002 yes was the year this is the first universal halloween horror nights  that was held in islands of adventure yes halloween horror nights 12 12 okay retroactively 12  uh i think if you go back to the early halloween horror nights like the first year or two it was a  pretty sparse affair okay and even this one if you got some of the video clips of it and stuff  they don't have all the ips yet you know there's a fear factor house on the other side of islands  of adventure but there's not like a halloween house and big horror weekend yeah big horror ips  yeah this it is but i'll say this the footage of it makes the whole thing seem creepier  oh yeah seems odder and weirder and not polished and feels like you might be more unnerved now it's  possibly it's also partly because of the vhs footage that exists this the small amount of  footage i should say but not a lot to work with here well do you guys know about the art of the  scare did you watch that i saw a comment some listener thank you led me to art of the scare  yes so this was a special for where and what i could not tell um i think it was traveled channel  okay and i think they filmed at islands of adventure at horror nights to that  20 2002 and then aired the special in 2003 okay i'll maybe promoting the next year which then was  also fully at islands of adventure that's there to clarify that that there were at this time it was  not both parks it was either or so for a couple years it went to fully islands of adventure and  then i think in 2004 there was enough uh interest in halloween horror nights that it was at both  places yeah and then eventually just back to the original universal park okay okay uh although that  and that's still how they there's nothing i believe so yeah i don't think there's anything at islands  of adventure well there's uh they have the death eaters the death eaters are there yeah um but yeah  so this was what is it 20 years ago already when we're discussing yeah it's the 20 year anniversary  of island 20 years ago i would have never stepped foot here that being said i didn't even know about  the marvel thing did you know about this at the time i did know about this from reading universal  message boards in college after the fact though after the fact because you were yeah i started  college what fall 2003 so after the fact i learned like oh holy shit there was a marvel  like haunt thing so my first question is would it have gotten you to go uh that may have gotten me  to go because i'm trying to think i think it would have gotten me to go but i'm not sure  i may have still been a chicken to do it would it get you to go now uh now i i think it would  you think it would i think it would you take would you take a flight would you go across the country  to go to this well that's a good question park podcast yeah i'd consider you would have to go  i feel like i would yeah but now they they just wouldn't no i know it's oh i mean yeah it's not  going to ever happen but i'm just i'm just trying to think of would this have like started you on  going to a haunt just because it's such an attractive like ip that you like yeah because  i i'm maybe i'm trying to figure out if i would have done it back then i don't i might have still  been too scared obviously right now i would be amazed it would be amazing to do it but  i'm just wondering if this would have gotten you into haunts 20 years ago well i don't know that  the walk-around characters at island of adventure wherever like a big uh uh selling point you know  yeah sure but i just it's such a fun crazy narrative it is a funny idea uh scott is there  an ip 20 years ago that would have gotten you into haunts what did you love 20 years ago was it uh  saturday night live if there was like uh like uh it's like wes anderson movies and punch  trunk love if there was a punch trunk love oh yeah themed yeah because i was new that year  so i would although well it wasn't i don't think it was out in october so it was in the fall yeah  it was in the fall year around then i feel november is what's in my head but i don't quite recall but  yeah if there was something uh if it was a simulation of uh the valley of north hollywood  around where i used to live a simulation of the the french restaurant and a used car lot and all  the ut and different utah brothers are jumping out at you and and threatening your car with crowbars  and saying they're gonna they're gonna hurt your girl yeah and then uh uh what does he smash the  like the back door or the glass door in the movie yeah like you'd have a well maybe there's some  like you know i feel like it's maybe a trope of mazes that you're like in the the head of one of  the great villains or even like the weekend it seemed like a weird like fever dream that the  weekend had so if you're yeah you're in barry egan's head and like seeing what causes the rage  fits and maybe going it oh that's another way to get a lot of characters in there you have people  playing the the many sisters that he has which causes him to to freak out and right yes the  dinner party you you go through the bathroom as he's beating it up yeah you get to be part and  maybe there's multiple barry egan's all beating up the bathroom um this would have gotten you to go  yeah yeah yeah yeah this or the royal dead and bombs the funny question i asked it as a funny  question but i do think there's like all there's like this is the butterfly effect you know you go  to like 20 years ago something that would have would have gotten you to go the butterfly effect  is the movie the butterfly yeah yeah it was that would be my uh top ip 20 years or me put uh how  about punch drunk love hate rising yeah that's good yeah so that would have done it um because  yeah this might have done it for me this marvel or a butterfly effect action yeah um uh well it's  fun to think about where we were at then and what would it because you need the more extreme  uh teen tastes i guess to yeah to get you in there and this is like this is appealing to a  pretty specific angle on marvel fandom this because there's like there's like uh i get you know i'm  not a big marvel person but there's like there are the materials for if you want like edgy  fucked up like there there is that sure there was in the comics at the time and this is playing  into that completely yeah this is right at the start of marvel max and the mature readers line  carthin is carthin is dirty nick fury book punisher is that when he started doing punisher  you know he did a marvel knights and then that switched to max okay where it could get dirtier  and violent her well i don't know that i've ever read them was it like r rated or was it like pg 13  it was like vertigo it was like dcs like there was like naked jessica jones and luke cage having sex  in the first issue of like nudity or yeah some nudity like butt uh yes it's heavily implied that  they have anal sex in the first issue really yeah heavily implied this was scandalous i this  at the time passed me by alias bendis right yeah yeah okay interesting bryan michael bendis uh  comic book writer yeah uh so okay this might be by the way with what just occurred this might be a  good time to tell you that something that was set up in an earlier episode in the dr doom episode  is still in effect the paper never left my garage oh yeah the fun fun fun facts if you don't  remember oh please yeah sure about no no i'm not doing it now i'm just saying uh that i i wanted  to come with protection you want to be prepared for situations like you don't want to use it  necessarily but if you don't remember what this was right and this is this will just be around in  the future that if there if marvel talk that i cannot penetrate um if i'm sorry to say penetrate  so soon after the anal sex reference uh but uh if i if i fill on the outside of i do have uh  10 beach boys facts okay that are uh not funny but i will i i will read one of no  uh choice but to deploy yeah yeah exactly yes great i also want to make it clear though when i  said but i just meant is there a picture of a but i didn't mean is there any else any well it was  such a perfect transition no you're right it's a one i want to be clear that that's not what i was  asking for i was just saying is there nudity yeah not sexual content anyway so yes they were  that happen in this and at the theme park did they pay tribute to the anal sex implication scene  is there any anal sex at island adventure i don't know that's a good question no it's not  question i don't answer to well i think the the real answer is the comics were more leaning  towards r-rated and this is still pretty pj 13 yeah now let me ask you this because  do i'm sensing now that you may not like this concept at all which concept really concept of  i'm asking jason because because there was a phrase in one of the wikipedia's that that said that  like you know this is obviously the kind of intense for kids or whatever and and i've said this  before the anecdote about jason seeing the first infinity war when half the superheroes are turned  to dust and he said i don't i didn't like it because all these kids are going to be so sad  i you you i i am not wild about it but not for that reason oh okay see interesting i sense this  because i somebody served up a marvel topic and jason's wild i love this i i think this is great  sorry i i'm not let me go back i do like this concept i'm not wild about the objection  to this concept oh okay so you do like so the opposite i misspoke yes oh okay no then you  then you like it i am into i really like this i'm into the uh i thought this would come later but  i'll say it now the objection to it from like somewhat at marvel's side some dummy at marvel's  side was like this is terrible we can't have this what if children see this the superheroes are dying  by 2002 marvel had pumped out so many storylines it was pat to do the the heroes are dead the  villains all won this is mere years after a story called onslaught where all the fantastic four  and avengers sacrifice themselves seemingly they die really they just go into a pocket universe  and then there was another story called legion quest where professor x's son goes back in time  to try to kill magneto in reality what happens is professor x dies this causes an apoc the age of  apocalypse to happen they never do it do they they never do something they never do it i was all  when i heard about the movies i was like whoa shit really they killed everybody like yeah but they of  course they didn't do it right they had around the time of a one-shot comic called the punisher kills  the marvel universe where he does that he does okay okay all right so great now we're talking  now see well now i'm coming from the perspective of i don't care about any of this  so kill everybody as far as i'm concerned sure so like a world where that's that's the deed that  like the we're on marvel superhero island and the heroes are no more and the villi so they're all  gone yeah yeah or like or they're you know they they like ran screaming they like they ran in fear  they're changing their names yeah um bloody captain america shield mounted oh god i saw a  headless spider-man body mentioned but i didn't see a picture of it but that's pretty funny  uh-huh i there's a uh like a wolverine corpse i i read uh that sounds right or impaled impaled  oh do we see a there's a there's not that many pictures because there's a couple videos and  they use some of the same footage and it's like maybe there's like a like a beaten up dr strange  walking around whoa or like a she hulk that's like kind of like looking like she hulks i think  yeah that was she hulk right yeah walking around with a gun she looks yeah like really like she's  seen some shit at this point uh yeah but yeah there was yeah was i like thor's hammer is like  everything's bloody shield uh bloody thor's hammer bloody iron man's helmet bloody because  they're all dead they've been killed stanley sweaters bloody uh-huh uh-huh broken glasses  broken like orange aviators you know red mustache hairs yeah really uh really disturbing stuff um  so well we haven't even said i mean like if you feel comfortable talking about this one there's a  i mean you probably i'll just say it there's a neon sign for one of the restaurants that i think  typically says dine but they didn't light up the n it says die it says diner it's the captain  america diner diner okay i'm sorry diner all right diner well and they turned off the r2 clearly die  it says it's the same gag as mel's diner becomes die okay they love this gag it's a good one yeah  it is a good gag yeah it's easy yeah it's good well it's fun to think about a hero uh you know  you guys know i don't know but just you know or i'm sorry about a villain walking around going like  okay we gotta fix this place up all right oh you know we should do you know what we gotta do  look at the size of diner here look at that okay just like with your fingers cover up the  end and cover up the r guys mephisto bullseye magneto come here come here look at this perfect  perfect because that is carnage is in charge of everything carnage is in charge and carnage is  like venom but worse crazier yeah venom well yeah explain that relationship to me as i don't know  about this venom have you seen the venom films no okay do you know venom he's uh uh i know the  rap song about him the best is a great song uh great song uh so there's a symbiote which is an  alien life form uh and and when it's the comic the first story is that it like attaches itself to  spider-man it turns his costume black he starts to feel bad and like evil or whatever and then  it jumps off and it jumps onto eddie brock and that guy turns into venom but it's the same type  of symbiote that like attaches itself to cletus cassidy who's a complete psychopath a serial  killer serial killer okay so he's like and even like eddie brock is like a bad guy but not like  so bad his nickname is the lethal protector yeah there's like times when he's good there's times  when he's bad there's different people who had this the venom symbiote uh but cletus  cassidy carnage is a crazy madman fully only bad or if yeah so they've made him the main guy who's  in charge of all the signs at islands of adventure he is in charge of making all make sure all the  signs are clever and uh halloweenified well it's nice that he keeps up the theme park tradition of  yeah yeah clever wordplay does carnage speak or does he just growl he speaks yeah he speaks  i actually i will admit i have not seen uh venom 2 where he is played by woody harrelson oh that's  who okay i might like that i tend to always like woody harrelson sure i mean he's great he's in  everything i mean he's he's out of hand in every uh universe at this point maybe one maybe the  only actor where i get excited if he's added to a franchise like the like planet of the apes  hunger games uh well i still now that still didn't get me but if i end you know hey next  time i want to play i will i will try to watch every woody harrelson movie available on planes  at least uh and then you know what you also got to do watch this club random uh anyway moving on  yeah so so carnage is like he's up in like uh what would you call it cherry picker he's not a cherry  picker but it's sort of that vibe but like here i am i'm he's like mickey uh conducting uh like  the water fountain or something and like in a cherry picker in a cherry picker like in the  epcot yeah yeah so uh yeah he's like kind of shouting directions and controlling traffic  from up there he's he's activating the fog yes which is firing off a lot of fog yeah so uh uh  just looking at the vhs footage of all of it with the fog directing the chain link put the  chain link fence there put the barrels there put the burnt cop cars there and it's not so well  lit in these few videos i've seen too where like you go to horror nights now the whole thing is  lit well the music is loud and it's like scary but it's kind of not it's kind of a party atmosphere  i don't know watching these videos to me there i felt more unnerved because it felt closer to  being like oh something's wrong at the park yeah like there is like a bunch of fires that were set  and it doesn't it didn't feel so polished which makes the whole thing feel more unnerving to me  i wasn't there but that's the vibe i'm getting from the footage yeah yeah yeah i think especially  the footage of the house on the island which is called maximum carnage right which was like a 90s  storyline and video game and video game yeah and uh it is unnerving because it's just a lot of like  seems like they're using the dr doom or the spider-man overflow queue and it's a lot of  you know those pneumatic drills they have that they just put on scrap metal and waterfall effects  and uh lighting effects and people dressed as like nuclear mutants or uh henchmen  so it's just kind of a little more chaotic yes it's not it's it's watching the actual maze itself  because i guess we could take a step back real quick is that there was they were trying they  they had it like an overarching theme narrative to the horror nights of the time yes oh yes right  but they had two yes it's kind of yes so initially it was a little girl everything in the same way  that starlight express is taking place on like a little boy's head oh yeah they had this narrative  of a original character named cindy of a little girl and all the different areas of islands of  adventure all the different haunts were like visions she was having in her head is that right  uh yeah that was like her toys and her play things wreaking havoc right but the wiki says  that there were a lot of child abductions at the time and they decided to change this character  into uh what the care the caretaker caretaker yeah uh uh hhn legacy says unfortunately a slew of  child abductions within central the central florida area caused universal to scrap the idea of cindy  and create the character of the caretaker out of her father paul bearer yes which is also a  wrestling man it had been for yeah 12 years yeah it's crazy there was so many florida abductions  matt gates wasn't even around yet oh yes i mean he was around but we don't know where he was  so they had like yeah so they they had tied all the ip to these this original lore this universal  lore so there was like a a seuss they didn't have a maze yeah they did like fog up the seuss area  and turn off all the rides and it was called oh it's uh boo what is it booville thank you  yes this is where to be this is where i got excited because i was a little like  it's a marvel thing is this interesting and then like starting for the special that you mentioned  jay's weight that's already the scare is the special yeah uh because they take you through  they show the map at the beginning and very seriously say all the but to seuss landing  becomes booville port of entry is now port of evil um something's called scary tales  yeah which one is that oh is that the lost continent yeah maybe yeah i don't know what  to do with that one so that becomes scary fairy tales that had nightmare it did was what's that  become an icon i think would come back ah they were like what's nightmare what is he oh sorry  he's just a creepy uh like demon guy okay you know i i am interested in the horror night's lore  you know you got the caretaker you got the director you know you got nightmare and fear they're  different sure i don't know any of this but we will that seem people seem to want to hear but that  so we'll figure that out we'll know i think i'm more interested in diving into all of that stuff  than actually going to horror nights while you're going next year okay we'll see  there's gonna be a smile house people smiling yeah there'll be a lot of smiles they're gonna do like  five on five off because everyone's faces are clenching because they're smiling so much is there  a strain of weed that you know of that would not make you anxious and would make you so chilled out  that you would be like just laughing your way through the whole night oh i don't know you'd  probably want an indica strain for that all right but that would probably just make me sleepy so  well if you can get through a couple houses before you go to bed that's true yeah you know although  i didn't make it through the monsters that's true and you that was you that was a strain that was  an edible though oh yeah you can't do an edible before this too potent okay this fear might be the  real fear might be that he just doesn't just falls asleep in one of the maze in the us house  right that's like a very cozy room yeah yeah yeah and like the exorcist he falls asleep next to the  what's-her-name linda blare linda blare look alike some people walking in there's just a man  sleeping while there's a puppet vomiting puppet vomiting that's so creepy it's just the still  animatronic just a mannequin there it's a nice change of pace from my childhood where i would be  the one up at night vomiting i was a pukey kid what are you gonna do which horror look people out  there have been every horror nights for 20 years which house which classic horror nights house would  you want jason to take a nap in that's my question to you oh yeah if you know the full way of the  land because there's been there's plenty of iconic beds in in 20 plus 30 years of horror nights so  like i said i was very intrigued by this house when i first learned about in college  but in the last couple years i got really interested in the haunt they did walking around  the floor of the mummy ride oh on the tr- whoa on the ground like with the track above you  that's pretty crazy it might have been the floor of kong whatever it was the ground's gotta get  you're probably not totally clear of mummy although maybe i don't know i don't know  i forget which one it might have been kong and you saw some of the city it seems so dangerous to me  there's so much universal horror night stuff i'm not aware of and i feel like it's not even that  well preserved yeah yeah because like this thing this thing you would think there would be so much  maybe people just didn't and it was an awkward era for there's not a lot of internet and people  don't have cameras is readily available and then low light for sure not um even just doing a history  of horror night seems good like it seems like we could get we could get uh three plus hours yeah  content the uh pictures make it seem very blair witch like taking like the old transition from  film camera to digital camera yes sure early digital camera yeah it may add to the creepiness  of it a little bit would you sleep in one of those killer clown like kind of pod things that they put  people in like they trap them in those kind of big balloon maybe i don't know anything about that  okay well they they sort of like have these we're killers in it a bullet yeah that's true  they like kidnap people and they put them in these big like hanging cotton candy  oh sort of sacks it kind of said oh and i kind of like that it looks like a babeson chair but a killer  pod isn't gonna be good well but i forget it's not really that so okay so yeah you could take a nap  in one of those um i guess a simula yeah wait because like the the pods in the matrix are very  scary i don't want to be in one for real but maybe a simulated one you could get a nice nap in yeah  please as long as i don't have to have wires in my head yeah exactly so so there's a lot of options  yeah um if you want to talk about like inventiveness and like oh they use that area for a  for a maze the special kind of goes into a jurassic park one oh yeah yeah this is what's  interesting about this year is what they're figuring out well how do we do a horror version  of marvel and of sue subuville sure nailed it uh but jurassic park what do we do and they used the  walkthrough attraction triceratops encounter where and and had to make use of like  basically that is like going to see a very gentle uh not i forget if sleeping but like kind of  docile yeah word um you know it's a very serene kind of little attraction so how do you turn that  horror it is very like twisting and winding so i guess i'm like oh that makes a lot of sense  but they had to turn it into a scenario where there's an evil there's a bad genetics lab guy  dr burton and dr burton's doing some bad experiments and they just by hiding some  stuff in shadows and blood and flashes and then there's an impaled or like a uh a hung up  uh dr bird decapitated dr burden or something uh um and it's and then they get they made another  triceratops they made a triceratops head that was fully ripped off with a bloody spinal cord  that's coming out of it yeah isn't that's kind of crazy you talk about i mean the thing we're  talking about marvel is like oh something that's kind of darker than the franchise at large  that's there's nothing that fucked up in a jurassic park that's kind of crazy so i i'm like oh this is  a this is kind of a bold situation and yeah these uh the people putting this thing together thinking  outside of the box yeah it's they're experimenting obviously because they pulled it all back  pretty quickly a little bit the one thing you can like you can murder and you can maim but you cannot  mess with intellectual property that's really the lesson here uh because yeah marvel now at  avengers campus they are doing at least doing stuff like you can see the zombie captain america  and werewolf by night is out which is a little short that michael giacchino just directed oh uh  which is like pretty we watched it kind of fun and man spoiler alert man things in it who's like  yeah swamp thing for marvel okay uh basically he's cute he is cute uh that's true so cute he's funny  uh so yeah but they're not gonna they're not gonna go nuts yeah yeah yeah this is a it's a nuts time  and then there's there's one more if we're talking about the lay of the land and the best phrase to  hear said by the the creepy voiced narrator of art of the scare which is the boy i was excited when  i heard the aforementioned phrase treaks and food this is what they did to tune lagoon which is the  home of our king features syndicates pals right from dudley do right and popeye that's pretty  specific to what the hell do you do we have to make a scary zone but also you'll see dudley do  right there and i i can't say i know exactly what they did but they've used the phrase treaks and  foons which i guess is freaks and tunes mixed up they're kind of like killer clowns they're  kind of bouncing freakish things that's what it is the treaks they were like original characters  original characters but i think we're burying the lead they pump the land full of foam foam party  foam an upsetting amount of foam that you have to walk through pretty much to get  to jurassic park unless you go counterclockwise uh from port of entry like a real sicko you and i have  been in a play we had to walk through foam a couple years ago we ended up at the end of a foam party  yeah in a bar that was not far from where i used to live yeah um and you got like lost in the foam  at one point and we went we went out on the patio yes there was a full foam party happening with like  naked like semi-naked people happening in a bar down the street and you had to go through it  no we didn't want to get to the bathroom you did wait but why were you there to begin with i mean  if the answer is you were there to go to the party that makes sense we were not it was the only bar  open till last call it was memorial day weekend like seven years ago and there was a play was it  called michaels no uh and mj mj's maybe yeah it was across the street from the gelsens which used  to be the disney studios and we said was there anything open and somebody said oh there's mj's  it's a gay bar oh but it's the only thing and we go oh yeah let's go over there so we went over there  and it was not just a bar it was a rave happening there were men in their underwear in a foam party  and i was like this is happening right like it's not the like the street where you would assume  big parties like that are happening sure so we were like okay well we're not prepared markets yes  i am not in the shape to have to strip all my clothes off and have a foam part didn't feel in  foam shape at the time i was not if all the bartenders were fucking jacked i remember we  gave them some money like they would just slap it on their chests to stick the dollar bills there  and we were like well let's let's just sit on the terrace i mean we were the five or six of us none  of us prepared to a party in foam and it was a cold spring it was a cold spring it was not in  the weather to be getting in the mix a novel phrase is the beginning of a novel you kind of had to go  through the phone to get to the bathroom which we all went to once and i remember jason disapproved  through the phone and i told turn to the everybody else who was with us and i went we're never seeing  him again he's gonna get lost in the foam i the bathroom i got lost because i was reading there  was a printout much like your printout of beach boys facts there was a sign on the door of the  regulations for the bathroom which were all different ways of saying please do not have sex  in the bathroom yeah and everyone in the bathroom they were everyone was really nice but they were  everyone's in their underwear and they were like why aren't you in the phone like what are you  doing man and i was like look i didn't know we didn't know we didn't know i'm not in the shape  i'm not in the shape to do this we got here 10 minutes before last call we just want to drink  a single newcastle each and leave i'm not against get foamy you only drink if you're foamy i was not  against the part i always wanted to go to a foam party in college i never did it never seemed to  come up um but i was you love your big douchey parties and you haven't been to a foam party  never went to a foam party in college and yes i was wildly i did i went to one really rito  rosarito which one is it really were you sure great town i don't believe no i don't believe  it was required or uh it was uh very bad and it stung my eyes oh okay you're not missing out on  much i went to one as he uh had died down so everything was just kind of clammy and soapy  like everyone was like oh that was fun but we didn't buy enough detergent like someone had  just covered an apartment in tarps oh wow that does not seem like a good usually don't you get  like a warehouse for that yeah you probably should yeah so but anyway so we've learned that the time  to go to a foam party is not the very end nothing in both cases this place maybe not in where i went  in mexico so that your eyes don't sting yeah there's nothing sexy about that yeah yeah  up higher quality foam won't sting your eyes um but yeah then this place closed down the street  and it was replaced by a place that had a bunch of like bad reports of like people drugging drinks  and stuff which might still be there primarily known uh among our friends is like oh don't go  there people keep getting roofied yeah so that's uh they're not doing foam parties i can't even  remember the name is very stupid and i can't remember it so anyway don't go in don't go  anywhere with a stupid name anyway treaks and foons treaks and foons so they're a bunch of weird  little bouncing freaks treaks and foons bouncing around i saw them giving people hugs in the foam  they were popping out of the foam and scaring people do you think that they there was a clear  delineation between what is a phone and what is a tree there was i know what it is i i think they  said in the special they said what makes one is one boys and one girl yeah one is male one is female  wow why what it's so interesting because like why didn't they just do the same gimmick in  tomb lagoon all the good guys are dead and it's the best oh bluto and snow and snidely whiplash  and like uh and uh and kathy's enemy ice cream ice cream is alive uh and what the the wife lock  horn is alive because she's the villain of that strip right i hate this there's a lot i don't know  man lock horn hate his wife jason is that the gimmick of that they hate each other okay so  maybe they're both dead the undead lock horns yeah the um the the the kid from family circus is uh  dead they're all dead and there's just the there's like a little like sprite that one of them could  see they told him to do or like tisk tisk them i don't know the name offhand put that in the  comments but not as a suggestion for an episode i don't think that's strong enough unless it is  maybe i might be strong enough yeah it could be uh so yeah so like that i'm wondering why they  didn't even go that way because it feels like people would be even less precious about those  characters but i guess it doesn't maybe thematically make sense king feature syndicate  might have been in better financial shape than marvel at that oh for sure at that point yeah  that's true so maybe they had more sway maybe they maybe they were presented with an idea like that  yeah it was they spelled it with an i it was king features syndicate right and they just for this  event they replaced that marmaduke photo op where you're holding on to the leash and they like a dog  skeleton was put in the marmaduke oh i thought you were gonna say they turned it around and he was  running right at you running like through you or biting you yeah killing you who's marmaduke's enemy  an empty bowl i mean for sure that is was there a bad was there a villain in the mar is there a  villain in marmaduke it's a good question i don't know the seems like it'd be like a real estate  developer maybe or like the dog catcher did uh uh did nancy nancy had enemies but was there a main  nancy enemy uh in the current run of nancy she has like a rival okay so a very studious rival  gotcha did in the like in the 40s did they all was hitler all their villain in the strips i guess  so yeah i mean and fritzy kind of has an antagonistic real yeah but she loves and fritzy  and nancy she does they do love each other but she's not a true villain yeah um i just passed by i  went oh what's marmaduke walker duel and then it turns out that was something from the civil war  okay all right it's not i'm so i'm no longer interested no boring real life snooze all right  but we've done this full circle around uh the islands was it the islands of fear  uh was that the larger i think the bigger name was islands of fear yeah like that um there's  there's one thing to say about it yeah about this the special really quick before we get back to  marvel because my favorite thing from the special has nothing to do with any of the specific mazes  it's like a general thing for about like maze craft and this is just a little behind the scenes  tidbit that i found interesting scenic pieces play a major role but how do they keep all the  visitors from fingering the props stop that really quick how do they and they're showing the visuals  there by the way or it is like a it's a disembodied hand though do they still yeah fingering that was  that afraid that word was used to mean steal for more right at a certain point like just i don't  know that the shift happened post 2002 i think people were talking about we were we were not  no right we do not have fingering on the brain we don't mean that we were worried props were  getting stolen from our favorite theme parks anyway how do you stop the guests from fingering  oh simple smear them with the gooeyest concoction you can find petroleum jelly  want to prevent fingerings better get yourself some petroleum jelly that's a good just in general  if you don't want anything to get uh uh stolen just cover it in petroleum jelly are you worried  about a rough spade of fingerings if you lube up with jelly pocket pick you know you want to  prevent a pick pocket from picking your pocket just a jelly up your wallet lube in there lube  up your big wallet they're not going to be able to get grasps on anything nothing a pocket full of  jelly this special uh i really like this special uh in the sense it's it's very dry but it's a guy  doing that voice for 48 minutes well that bird wasn't so dry thanks to all the lube all the lube  my other favorite thing about that special is the uh editor in chief of haunted attraction magazine  who appears to be named lennard pickle cool that was a good yeah kind of an unfortunate uh pause  that i showed them um lennard pickle seems fine but he you'd think he'd be very excited being on  television um but he's more of a just the facts man he's like they're all so stressed about with  fingerings yeah focus they go well we got a whole month of fingerings ahead of us the rat lady's  pretty enthusiastic she's pretty chill about it all yeah you get to see a rat lady she actually  is in a little bed uh little glass coffin with a bunch of rats yeah she's very casual yeah they  get in little spats sometimes but it seems pretty domesticated yeah yeah they used to use when we  were at nots they said that they had some they did some weird rat stuff back in the day but then like  people were upset by that so yeah well this as we talked about the animal actor stage like the  the theme park turn away from using animals unnecessarily i think that's kind of a later  2000s thing yeah so in this day and age the rats were running wild um but not on her rat lady was  okay but so yeah that's look there was a lot going on this is a good excuse to get a general lay of  land of 2002 of islands of fear but the most fun thing seemingly is this topsy turvy superhero  dead world yes yeah i think for sure yeah they were having the most fun with this even though  there's still stuff where you go like oh i there's so much more they could have done but for the time  it feels like they were really like swinging for the fences yeah and i want to get it let let's get  into that can we talk about the villains that were used sure they're walking around i mean carnage we  mentioned he was the big one his big bad guy a pretty popular character 90s character 90s character  used a lot over the years comes back a lot um and then the other name uh well i guess the other big  one was the cat in america uh villain crossbones who was played by frank grillo in the movies the  the current movie not in the parks not in the parks no uh played by what looks like a very  gaunt man and then a whole bunch of other guys they had a bunch of crossbones walking around  with chainsaws they were the chainsaw guys we're looking at like seven of them some of these guys  look perfectly cast like they are jacked yeah they look like they worked at that bar that jason and  i went with the phone party yeah those guys are in good shape good shape um crossbones pretty easy  costume to do like a tank top with bones on it and a skeleton mask the other big character i saw  mentioned was craven the hunter this is a spider-man villain um scott just from the song i know him  he's from the david larry performance if you'll remember he's like kind of a big burly guy here's  here's one drawing he's kind of bane-esque kind of bane he's a hunter he likes to hunt  game and man the most dangerous game the most dangerous game of course um this is what he looked  like at islands uh of fear uh he had frosted tips and he was real lean oh yeah yes click on it real  quick oh sorry just zoom in yeah the the most popular craven story is one in which he kills  himself is that what i have never read that craven's last time he's like he's not around  anymore i don't think they did that on the island of adventure but it's craven's last the other  villains try to stop him let him know that the way we love you no uh but yeah that's that's an old  story um yeah he's old his time yeah so uh uh i guess 1987 is when the story is from yeah he did  not have frosted tips in that story 2002 you know no wonder he killed himself geez  now he looks cool yeah yeah yeah um so yeah so so it's an interesting mix because they would have  different they had different villains inside the maze and different villains roaming around  yeah but there's no and then there was like i i think early on there were plans of like and this  film's going to take over this ride and this film's going to take over this ride but it doesn't  seem like they got very far right because it would make sense for the hulk an incredible hulk coaster  to like to be taken over by the abomination which is one of his main villains yes or the leader or  the leader tim blake nelson's character who's going to return in captain america 4 i believe  something like that for the norton hulk has this character and now we're getting norton hulk stuff  in you know we're in the ruffalo and we're gonna have to have a hulk we're gonna have to have a  spider-man with the hulks with banna norton and ruffalo and uh mizlani yeah you know it's interesting  there's a real life villain who maybe bears mentioning oh no he's from uh and i'm speaking  of course of murray wilson the uh brian's abusive father is also the manager of the group uh you know  it's interesting it's fun fun fun that brian wilson's first number one hit wasn't recorded  by the beach boys it was surf city by jan and dean and murray the abusive father was irate that  brian gave away their first number one hit to another group and he called jan barry a record  pirate a record pirate record pirate that's no yeah that's that's quite a slight you wouldn't  want to see any of those walking around islands of fear who is scarier brian wilson's father or the  leader who i don't know let's tell the audience decide what let's just square them off what do  we know about the leader uh he's got a big brain uh jason what help me out with the leader at a  false eye leader has his eyes okay let's see the leader is very intelligent the gamma radiation  made him super smart in the way that it made banner super strong he's very smart too he put  out his own record the many moods of murray wilson and he loved to tell brian hey brian i'm a genius  too okay so they're pretty evenly matched so far this the leader looks like this he has a big head  yeah well that's scarier murray well but is it scarier that just a plain man like murray wilson  could be such an abusive monster that's you might know what's coming for you from the leader that's  true you know if we're talking about gamma radiation we should mention the storyline old man logan  similarly the villains won all the heroes except like hawkeye and wolverine are dead  for the most part um and there's a bunch of inbred hulks that control a part of the country right um  that storyline would go on to inspire the movie logan nominated for oscars that's true some  inbred hulk are they so are they dumber than yeah they're dumber and yeah i would probably  like old man logan i bet this sounds good it's fucking weird and gross yeah here's the one big  cover of it okay i don't see any inbred hulks on there no that's what i want to see they're kind  of in the corner they're these weird little guys in the corner oh i see are they little no it's just  an interpretation they're little well because that's a way that a hulk could be inbred is it  end up very small instead of very big uh it's a yeah it's it's fun it's got some shock humor  you might or shock uh violence as well okay i won't spoil it i mean you're not gonna  wolverine gets mind controlled by mysterio and accidentally kills all the x-men he thinks he's  killing like villains but then like the mind his mind like it's clear and he realizes he just  killed all the x-men wow and then he swore to like like never pop his claws again wow  and they kill you kill him for real yes in this story yeah it's else worlds and whatever what i  want i want permanence to these deaths mysterio also the big villain in kevin smith's daredevil  arc from the right around this time period okay so there you go you're not going to the facts now  after you get hit with something like that well you have kevin smith no fun fun fun facts after  this i have had attention sorry if i spoiled that uh 20 plus year old uh story line for anyone 15  year old story at this point yeah i spoiled some of the story of the film love and mercy  uh well spoilers abound on club three uh but yeah there's other villains in the maze  and one of them i'm really excited about uh do you have the list of them here because i'm really  tell i was having there was kind of a red skull is that right uh yeah let me just find the thing  here because my i just got a weird google ad that took over the webpage i had loaded  oh wait here this is just a sub fact to fill the time brian wilson played the teacher mr  hawthorne on the new leave it to beaver in 1988 well i'd love that that's have you ever seen that  no i haven't he acts he has to do how is it it's so bad yeah yeah now listen to me mr huskull you do  not pass notes in my class as a man not meant to act yeah uh so here we go so the scare actors  they've listed here they have uh uh just chainsaw henchmen vermin they have toad listed  okay zorn listed really yes wait no that can't be accurate that's what it says yeah okay that would  be accurate i guess so zorn has like been both good and bad he's been used the most during  grant morrison's uh new x-men yeah um and zorn again i think i've spoiler alerted zorn on this  podcast before but in case i haven't zorn is uh actually in that run he's raising a human kid and  he's a cartoon and sheryl hinds says no no problems with him uh uh zorn is magneto in disguise in  disguise the whole time oh so people don't know that i don't know that there was a reveal in this  maze but i'm a big fan of the zorn character and reveal that's a deep pull right this is why it's  exciting they did not have magneto they did not have kingpin right there's a list hold on  dr doom was right there yes um but then one was which makes it better because if you're a comic  book fan it's a creepy design kind of a weird design yeah he's got kind of a skull head um  yeah but yeah they had uh electro uh mephisto not mr mechphisto bono's character this is mephisto  the devil is a devil in marvel universe kind of walking around the scare zone too  walking around he was just walking around oh would you be more afraid of the marvel universe  devil or bono's mr mechphisto from the zoo tv i don't know i don't know enough about the other  i mean somebody with the ability to take over your tv feed because bono is the devil too they're both  the devil mr mechphisto is the devil if you're if you're if you hear fisto then you might be  dealing with a barely disguised devil right it's not kit and it's not the door's character kit  fisto not the devil not the devil so not all the stows are devils not all fistos are devils um  this mephisto and mechphisto this uh wiki says the punisher was there oh yeah okay and also guy with  overalls with wearing overalls with a gun scary character that's a real world villain there's an  infinite amount of those the punisher i think i was watching one of the videos and they said the  punisher was like under some mind control so he was like firing at people with his gun uh they also  supposedly had i think they scrapped the idea that there would be snipers on the roofs of this uh and  but apparently in the maze there were laser pointers to make you feel like you were in sites  of characters which is very scary that's really scary uh so they were doing some intense things  i would say that they don't do i haven't seen them do that more psychologically scary a little bit  yeah there was a tunnel with like holes in it they do this trick still where you walk through  something that's like a like a cylinder that rotates yeah that looks cool that's very  unset that's like something from a corn video yes yes it is i don't even mean that's like an insult  the corn videos were very well done freak on a leash yeah where there's holes in the  yeah that but spinning yeah was the video was the jonathan davis video with the chris angel  uh vegas show was it as good as free connelly i don't think it was but it was still similar  i don't now i don't i this sounds vaguely familiar but you saw the original i know you've obviously  seen the new the new um chris angel show but did you see the one prior to that yeah i do look  i'm pretty a mystic of fog that's it's hard to keep when he's clearly topped the previous show  there is a i don't remember no jonathan davis i remember getting blasted with trash okay fair enough  but jonathan davis does do the music for mine his regular mind freak show and i think there is a  music video component uh as well but it's not yeah it's not on the level of the iconic freak  on the leash video so yes there is a freak on the leash style uh thing happening in this maximum  carnage maze cool um but i'll say this just from looking at the video the actual um like  location that you're being put placed into is not that specific in the house no that if i had a  punch up it would be that like give me some more marvel like iconography in the actual maze because  the maze just seems like it's a bunch of chain link fences and like walls and it i was watching  the special and i lost track of that this was the marvel one yes so that tells you it is so not  specific right so it never because this is we know this will never happen again there will never be a  scary marvel or at least not a fully murderous thing like this yeah um so if this was their  chance it does not necessarily give you the full like herbal fun house it would have been awesome  i mean i know they couldn't have done this and kept putting like kept putting it back each night  but like if they had taken the cue of spider-man which is the daily bugle office like and fucked  that up and made that scary that'd be awesome i don't know like cletus i don't know do cletus  have a famous villains layer that i'm forgetting even just something that like they made up some  sort of industrial thing that like felt specific or like a villain's i don't know something specific  to him it well he just feels like some of these costumes are like kind of done generically and on  the cheap compared to like the caretaker or nightmare which were like very intensive  makeup and costuming right yes so like even just something that was a little bit less  fence based little like less fence wire fence based what's look in music videos uh from then  and ever since what is scarier than a chain link fence that's a good point you put it in front  behind the performer and it's a little scary you put it in between the performer and the camera  it's true it's very unsettling very unsettling yeah so yeah i guess look there could have been  some fences but it didn't have to be all of them like it didn't have to be don't rely on fan if  they don't make fences your when you have scary villains at your disposal yeah so but maybe the  budget wasn't that high you know so i would say definitely the budget cheap yeah but it's a bummer  that it like that them doing this coincided with the budget maybe not being as high as it is now  for horror nights and for for uh marvel things we see great iterations of these costumes now that  disney is doing it yeah back in these days um the werewolf by night did you see what i'm talking  there's werewolf he's like on top of avengers uh i haven't seen whatever it is they did like a little  like patch of something up in top and there's like full moon and there's a guy dressed as a werewolf  and like he's howling and you're like yeah pretty good yeah like things are cool yes you want like  this little this little carriage of parades um i do want to know though like what level was the  person from marvel going like we're mad you can't do this again like well it's kind of like a vp or  a licensing person like because writers and editors wouldn't give a shit you know yeah they'd like this  probably yeah who knows and also this is very unofficial all these like halloween horror nights  things are not so officially they feel like in general the story seems to be marvel got mad you  can't show kids dead superheroes don't do this again but there's no real source on that no doubt  that happened but it's so vague but it didn't happen again and seuss i don't think they ever  did anything near halloween again yeah but they yeah it feels like the whole thing the whole  concept of this sort of went away pretty quickly so yeah it's weird because you would think they  would have had to like somebody a marvel would have known what they were doing yeah so that's  it seems suspicious to me that it's as simple as just like you're going to scare the kids  versus marvel saying like it would make more sense to me where marvel said oh it's cool that you're  doing something at horror nights just let us approve what it is because like just doing villains  night at islands of adventure would be cool just say yeah this okay the difference is you can't  say the captain murk is dead you know what i mean like that's why that's that seems like a simple  explanation for why it didn't happen it took over but the heroes will return villains take over i  do think does that shit all the time yeah yes so i don't know it seems simplistic as far as a  reason maybe it's true but it feels like uh this is the reason somebody said no don't do this anymore  yeah so so they did keep doing stuff in this they still used it as a scare zone the next year but  the marvel affiliation was gone it then in 20 2003 it was known as toxic city and if we don't have  all these villains to use how do we fill the space and the answer was foam the aforementioned here we  go from shrieks and shrieks and foons became all right let's move that foam over here and the idea  is toxic city you are in a toxic city and this is toxic foam and some of it is green foam so aware of  the uh the green foam that's spewing everywhere it creepily says you've broken quarantine and  entered a city plunged into a biohazard nightmare uh i don't have to read all of this copy um it  says can you escape this biohazard nightmare or will the toxic avengers get to you first  but is it then is it the toxic no but it sounds so why are you the toxic avenger because that'd be  awesome yeah i said don't use the word avengers if you don't have that yeah copyright or yeah or the  toxic avenger which is a movie and a cartoon yeah great toys really detailed toys the playmates  there the playmates made them and they very much fit directly with the playmates turtles at the  time did you ever know that makes sense i remember it more as a toy thing yeah knowing what the actual  property was yeah me too that and bucky o'hare i remember the toys more than anything completely  the bucky o'hare gang could sit next to the turtles no problem yeah yeah they had a very hard to find  arcade cabinet every now and then we'd be on vacation i'd find the bucky o'hare cabinet  somewhere and i'd get so excited say well mom dad this is where i am for the next five days  this is where i am but you're like me i had the nintendo game i had all the comics and i had all  the toys and now i have the newer toys of turtles and i have a perfect layer oh bucky o'hare okay  i so uh you know they try to do something else here but they lost the moral thing i don't think  toxic nobody's telling us to do an episode about toxic city um so it didn't have the same the the  boldness of killing beloved superheroes ironic because there are like a million toxic based  heroes and villains i feel like in marvel yeah but they don't want any part of it by now so when the  sun goes down you lose the license this would be disney's dream of how it could play out i think  they would bite on that it's okay we at night you get to have marvel at disney world great done can  do great works for me sure we'll buy we'll buy the rest out somehow they've been doing like at the  at the oogie boogie bash in disneyland they do little excuse me they do like a challenge trail  they turn it into like foggy thing with some villains i forget what it's called i feel like  there's not enough room for them to even do anything at disneyland right now no you like  a fun i was there the day an oogie boogie bash was starting and it's very funny how they can't  tell you to get the fuck out but they're kind of telling you you have to leave right like we were  eating an ice cream bar and next to the starbucks and they let jane go in for napkins but someone  went in to try and buy coffee and they're like uh uh no you don't have you don't have a badge you  can't go in you know they got to do that yeah with every like horror nights in the regular park goers  too yeah i had two manhattans and i thought i could outsmart it but with no plan i was like here i know  let's just you me and the child let's just walk into the park confidently immediately oh badges  okay never mind bye oh so you weren't even in the park to begin with oh we were in the park we just  like like what if we try to stay i'm sure no one's ever thought of that before we took our time and  it was fun to hear the music change over it was fun to see some people had very good costumes  when we had left the grand california and people were already entering that entrance  grand california was packed tons of people were staying there and clearly going to this the the it  was like a block long line from that hotel entrance to the park to the lobby there was people i would  this is just a side note this seems like it would be fun to go to but it never seems like there's  enough offerings like a horror nights for me to spend what is 150 bucks which is like a day ticket  well i just didn't think of it this year and then when i was there i was like this does look fun  i'm sure it's like it sells out in a day yeah you have to be at your computer it's so popular the  headless horseman runs down the street during the parade which is fun okay so it sounds like fun but  it always feels like it's not quite enough for me especially because usually i have an annual pass  which i don't know going forward what that's going to look like because we're all so confused and  irritated by the changes i just got a new magic key magnet in the mail because i renewed behind  oh you did oh right right okay hell yeah man they really appreciate you it's blue now  it's blue and the mailing was addressed to magic key holder so no more names no more names  did i say immediately having the child that lindsay has gone from her stance of like we're waiting  till the baby is two before we go to disneyland too we should take the baby soon right  jason keeps saying the baby's free which is really what the attractive part of it is  no we're not doing it imminently but at least she's a little flexible on the on the time table  try anything crazy like trying to get a lunch reservation because you're fucked in that respect  sure uh so anyway yeah disney we should do one of these parties one of these days but  it just feels like you're there all the time it's like am i gonna go and pay more money it doesn't  if it was like eight mazes i've said this before where disney if they did like elaborate disney  mazes that they erected only for halloween season then okay maybe but it just you're like is it  enough to justify in my mind i'll say this the vibe was good i'm sure it was jack to be there  sure that's the case the vibe at the 80s night was great yeah people are so excited to be there  for a themed event and when like when the ambiance is a little different people get  excited like when you go they're playing pop music on main street it was a very suggestive excited  there was a little eyebrow raise there was that seemed like foam party maybe maybe i was a little  excited at the 80s night i saw micky in his tracksuit from uh the mouser size and i got excited  that's why when i was dancing we got a film filming singlet totally mini that night  so maybe that's what is what i'm talking about i i um memory came back a friend of mine from high  school went down to disney and universal around halloween and they went to horror nights  and you know again it was not as built up as it is now but uh there were like margarita stands  like every 20 feet and the only distinction between alcoholic and non-alcoholic was like  either the cup or or a parasol in it or something so our parents just kept buying  her the alcoholic ones and doing the thing to the cup and she was just like yeah i was just  going into haunted houses and we were all hammered by some point  well you can you can get hammered at disney at ogee boogie bash yeah and meet they card a lot  more aggressively nowadays that's true yeah this is having done a lot of these podcasts like  bodiness hammered is one of those listeners do a drinking game with mike and jason with the word  hammered i do you guys are you guys aware of the amount of i think a 16 17 year old has much of a  tolerance you know i think even team part i'm just saying you use the hammered becomes the word i  think of it a lot because you know what always comes up is that irish bar that's next to despicable  me that i say and it's always like you get because you go there and get hammered i you get you get  hammered there's a big wind up always i like the fray i like hammered i mean is it just a fun  yeah it's like thors hammer i just see people who can barely stand it's how tides walk around that  upper lot coming from that bar yeah what would you say your go-to word to mean that is  oh i have to no i think i say a few too many  well we can go to that we made me feel like a trick and a fool we can start saying it like that  so i this one i'm not gonna i like saying hammered and i will still say this is just listen for it in  past episodes and in the future now that i've made it a thing you listeners play a drinking  game with it and you yourselves will get hammered hammered you will get hammered hammered it's always  it's the bit the h gets a lot of hang time i'm trying to think of it a good other way i would  like to say it uh i'm trying to think there's a move john c reilly says getting drunk in a funny  way and i'm trying to remember how he says it i got something whatever okay it'll come to me  there's another way i like to say it but it's not hammered so maybe i'll replace it with with this  thing i can't think look that one up and then you'll straight uh um is there anything else about  i'm worried he says it's in it's in ricky pittson tell it good night he sees uh they're improving at  the table with it when they're saying he's saying he's improv in that movie yeah believe it or not  they have do some riffs he says he's in the front row of a lennard skinner concert and he says i'm  hammered drunk it is hammered yeah it's hammered it might have been the birth of the maybe the love  burrowed into our brains yeah uh the only other thing just there's so many easy things to do like  if they did a maze with doom like as doom's embassy which is the queue for oh yeah the like  why not a great villain there doom embassy like or something carnage it seems like as it was  developed it kept it was going to be in the extended queue for storm accelerator storm force  accelerator and then i think they just built a warehouse because they're like oh we'll keep  using this it's called the carnage warehouse and i believe now it's being used for storage  yeah so put in the carnage warehouse so people yeah carnage warehouse and it's just yeah there's  a lot of chain link fence in there and uh some like uh uh drink cups that we're gonna need when  we run out cylinder with a bunch of holes in it we just spin it around i wonder cylinder i wonder  if it's a pain in the ass to run horror nights at two parks spread out over two parks i mean i'm sure  yeah logistically because i i am surprised as it gets bigger and bigger it hasn't gone back to both  parks yeah i don't know i don't because it's sold out every night so i don't know if they yeah i  don't know maybe it's just easier to stay at one yeah i don't know good question for what's his  name murdy john murdy oh yeah maybe you talk jason talked to him once yeah i think he's mostly out  here though sure but he might know he may know yeah may know don't make me get the list  um  i guess i did establish rules of when the list comes out yeah uh um okay uh a little quick thing  we forgot one thing about the about horror nights 2002 and we've talked about a lot of things in this  episode we have talked about uh unorthodox villain team up super team ups we've talked about uh  intellectual property being done a little sloppily maybe the costumes not being the best  and we have not mentioned the ultimate iteration of all the things i just said and that is the  bill and ted halloween show oh right very well might have talked about this specific one when  we did an episode about that with uh with brad and nick years ago uh but just in case just to like  set the cultural scene that island under siege chill came out chill yeah fall of 2002 cool  progressive yeah yeah yeah great attitudes towards sexuality uh um so the well the big  things this year uh hey well see if you can guess them honestly if there's a 2002 do you have any  that's a good thought what's big what is the big pop culture in 2002 and i'll i'll save you uh i  it's not what i said before barry egan from punch trunk love does not appear it's not the mattress  man does not oh why didn't they say oh the mattress man is that car manage that oh yeah  uh is it the war on terror yeah i was gonna go war on terror as well they get all the guys in  rumsfeld yeah is that it colin fell the playing cards haven't happened yet iraq hasn't been  invaded yet but they're still trying osama bin haydn oh yeah yeah um no amazingly none of that  is referred it's uh why of course it's uh uh well dr evil and but dr evil takes on uh the most  sinister henchman that he could which is serlina from men in black two what yeah you know oh yeah  is that larvalyn boil yes the lingerie uh model who gets taken over um so then all right agent j  comes out to battle dr evil and serlina but mini me fights out and jumps out and fights agent j  and by the way just hearing about agent j you're like oh bill and ted why can you not  be here to have now certain characters in 2022 say keep my wife's name out your fucking mouth  say that to um i uh try guy ned probably that's right yes the team up of uh will smith and try  guy med yeah yeah wait how does it work because he's well he's well will smith is a is an ardent  defender of marriage and try guy ned fucked up and broke the marital vows right in a way that  the try guys seem to feel has never right occurred in history before so they'd be at odds right yes  so they would yes that would team up and then maybe it's keep your wife's name out your fucking  mouth when he tries to apologize but the apology is not because he's dreaming of the food baby  so will smith has to remind him what matters so will smith is the hero i think doing the slap  right that's that's good i think you know you maybe put too much thought into it because it  might just be like then like dr phil comes out and interrupts them yes probably still in 2022  2022 right dr phil comes out because my temptation was is it dr oz because he's topical but i think  mike's right i think it is dr phil because someone on the staff who someone who's there can do a  doctor phil yeah yeah dr oz how do you do that he's just like a weasel then you would just have a big  inflatable because john federman is a massive man he's a tall tall guy this is two of the weasels  but if you could just have a giant inflatable like foot come down and like step up like the  monty python foot on dr oz oh no john federman john federman but if it was florida then like  oz pushes up on federman's boot and he raises up the boot and he wins  dr oz beats everyone cheers you sure well well then they would have to get desantis  yeah that's true yeah yeah probably desantis like he's in the show for real he says he shows  every night he actually shows up in the white boots that's what he wants in the dallas cowboy boots  and tell us cowboy shearley are boots that he's wearing he goes up to dr fauci and says keep the  word lockdown out your fucking mouth right crowd cheers slaps the actor for real even though they  talked backstage please mr desantis uh-huh this sound won't even be audible they're gonna put in  a sound effect but he's too tough of a guy yeah i'm too tough i talk like this and i'm like yeah  i'm a very tough man and he gets the slap and then the whole crowd goes wild they're spilling their  mikulov ultra can bottles everywhere you know some illegal immigrants try to sneak into the show and  give some a free trip to martha's vineyard in the phone booth oh yes oh wow and villain ted go cool  not in the show very much so far i i thought they i thought drag i neck would trying to be like  hide me bill and ted and they're like no way man you're gross yeah look we've done a lot of  bad stuff and we've said some bad slurs about gay people but there's one thing we won't stand for  which is your affair try guy nid and then the audience takes like a couple like a minute of  like contemplative silence then actors playing the try guys respectfully not like those lunatics on  saturday night live actors respectfully come out and reenact the apology video but with no jokes  oh this is not a laughing matter oh i just okay that kind of negates my pitch which  the couch is actually in a big toilet and they all get flushed out of the toilet  i think all the show should end like that oh yeah they could bring it back and it's just everyone  getting flushed down a big toilet like every character epic universe i'm billy eichner i'm  mad about the movie people didn't come out flush down he goes where are the cast of amsterdam  biden falls up the stairs that flush  anyone yeah anyone who's in the news gets flushed this will be an epic universe they're building a  big toilet for epic universe for this new bill and ted show to skewer the center of the park  that's their their castle that's their center of the park anything topical that's happening  will be flushed we see a coca cola dream world what epic universe is like we're bringing back  villain ted every night in the middle of the esplanade might be i don't know we don't know  that could be the biggest weirdly that could be that's the end one more thing there's been  yeah there's been no leak about that there's a lot of leaks about other rides but we don't know  yeah uh well get billed in that big toilet yeah and by the i think also i think they could always  end with how they ended 2002 which is darth vader and gandalf fight and gandalf comes out victorious  darth vader reveals that he is actually martha stewart  that's what snl needs to learn from that's that's funny yeah that's back when comedy used to be  funny then yeah i don't know they just now they don't have their facts straight add the flush and  i'm laughing that's all i say add the flush kind of ever well look you're editing this so feel  free to put in as many flushes as you want uh but that's just if you have time otherwise you  survived haunt cast the fright oh i don't know all right it's been a little time does club freak or  club eek have any fruit to it now i still like my club three-headed dog okay all right we'll see  we'll discuss that one discuss it off mike all fan i'm sorry we didn't handle this but i figured  just get it out you know because this is about communication this is about intimacy which is why  we say thanks for subscribing your bravery saved the haunt cast well done freedom fighters um and  topic wise send us whatever direction you want next time uh hit the comment suggest some stuff  that isn't spooky and if you want to just hear me read the full fun fun fun facts list i'm uh i'd be  willing we could i could be talked into it great and i have the way the perfect way to take us out  oh there's an ad shit it's gonna be a perfect not so perfect oh that gives me time to uh wait  the beach boys did the first album record entirely in pro school  the flush oh oh all right those are loud planes so we should just let's uh that'll do it  unless they want most people want to hear the entire plane pass by
