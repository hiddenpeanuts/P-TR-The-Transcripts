  Dog!  When your town has let you down  When your port has fallen short  When you're too worn out to run  And need some ribs or a Cinnabon  You need a place, a place for rock  A place for roll  A place where Oakland Raiders merch is sold  A sublime hot topic and billabong  A place where you can purchase a candy thong  So let's go take a walk  Let's all go to City Walk  Tonight, tonight  Next to a theme park  I'm Scott Gardner, one of the madmen participating in this grand experiment  The others being Mike Carlson  Hi, yes, this is a terrible idea just in general  Like, this is ill-advised to people  We say it to people and they think it's a joke  It is not a joke, we are doing this 19 days in a row  We're examining all of the stores and restaurants and water fountains for children  Signage, neon, and you know, the characters hanging off of buildings  The sidewalk, the actual bricks are up for grabs  There's things to be learned about every single detail of this place  And we'll probably still not even get through all of it  No, there's no way, I mean there's so much there at City Walk, also  Also, Jason Sheridan  Hello, you know, there's a saying that goes, fortune favors the bold  Used by either the British military or the French Foreign Legion  Or like a coffee ad or something  Or like a coffee ad as well  It's translated from Latin, I forget what the Latin term is  But you know, I feel like a grand experiment is a good way to put what we're embarking on  Yeah, but I mean, this is the type of thing we need to get into  We've done, you know, six months of podcasts about rides and stuff that everyone examines  We decided to take something that universally is regarded as like a hated thing  Most people say, oh, City Walk is terrible, this is a horrible place  I disagree with that also, I've always disagreed, I'm on record  I have tweets that go back five, six years saying, I like City Walk  We can find those tweets  Yeah, well, you know what I think I've done throughout my life is pretend I didn't like it  Made fun of it  If I wanted to do something there, I would couch it in kind of an ironic way  Wouldn't it be funny to go up to City Walk?  And now after months of this podcast, I feel free to come out of the City Walk closet  And just own that I always wanted to go there  Every time, it was genuinely what I wanted  Amen  Yeah  Amen, also  I'm scared of being persecuted on this issue of having to go up under slightly false pretenses  with friends who know actually what's going on  And let's clarify, this series is about City Walk at Universal Hollywood  Not City Walk at Universal Orlando  That is an entirely different entity  We will not speak about that at all  At all  This is only for Hollywood and yes, now  That is also lovely, it's a lovely place  Yeah, well in an endeavor like this requires rules and parameters  Right, and which is why, you know, we've carefully caged ourselves in with the 19 part system  Yes  Now where did 19 come from?  I feel like because they aren't necessarily all even in the amounts of stores and restaurants  But there's, I think 19 is a perfect number  And I don't want to question perfection, but if we had to analyze what is it about 19  Why is that the perfect amount?  You know, one of the impetuses for doing this is that like we met a guy  I think a guy almost undervalues what he is  A mentor figure maybe or a voice of authority  Boys  Oh yeah, he's here  A sector keeper?  You know who could have said it better than the man, the being himself  So yeah, joining us today on the podcast is we call him the sector keeper  He keeps the different sectors of CityWalk  Universal CityWalk sector keeper, please  Universal CityWalk Hollywood sector keeper actually if I may correct you, I'm so sorry  Yes, my spirit can't cross the country  You start to dissipate when you hit the Mississippi  I lose strength, yes  Yeah, so when we talk about 19 sectors, this is sort of a number that's been around for as long as time  Like the number 23, the significant number of the Jim Carrey film  19 is a, it exists in many different codes and it's embedded secretly all over the CityWalk property  That's fair to say, correct?  Yes, yes  That's another worldly meaning  CityWalk is a powerful place, a magical place  And so you must divide it into sectors to experience more than a sector provides would be dangerous  Yes, if we have too much fun and too much discussion about like maybe say two sectors at once  It would be too much for sort of a normal mortal man or woman to handle  So that's why we've divided it up into different sectors  Because if we were to talk about all of CityWalk at once, who knows what would happen  I don't know, we would just be exhausted, you know  Or we'd be here all day, all week  Well, and many people in this city or visiting Los Angeles from other cities have gone up to CityWalk  And I can only imagine, I mean there's no wrong way to do CityWalk, but there's also a perfect way to do it  And it seems to me, SectorKeeper, that by laying out the divine sectors, you are providing your ideal way of experiencing this mall  I would call it a perfect sort of roadmap  Yes, look at it as a roadmap, a roadmap that will provide you many things  Discoveries of popcorn, popcornopolis  Discoveries of board shorts at Billabong  Discoveries of watches at Fossil  Discoveries of water massages at ZenZone  And discoveries of well-priced women's fashion at Angel  Oh, just like scarves and stuff?  Yes, like scarves and dresses  But at a reasonable price  Fashion forward, but at a reasonable price  And that is your first sector  Sector 1, Billabong, Popcornopolis, Fossil, ZenZone, and Angel, my boys  Oh, we're your boys now?  Venture into the sector, discuss, but be careful  If you go outside of the sector, my spirit will burn in hell  Wait, what? Oh no, I spit out the drink out of my mouth  Really? That's what's at stake here?  Yes, each sector will help piece together my soul  Once you accomplish each sector, you will get a sector stone  Okay  19 sector stones make up my soul  Oh my god  So please go forth, be careful, and I'll be here watching over you as your guardian  So we're setting you free? Sorry to bring you back real quick  Yes, I'm still here  So we're setting you free? So you can hang out, but we're setting you free basically  Are you into Casper where you have unfinished business?  Yes, I have unfinished business in the city walk  I can't get into the details, I'll tell you more as you discover more  But just know that I will go to hell if you don't do this  Okay, well that's a lot to put on us  Is there a precedent for this? Was there ever a podcast that tried to analyze the King of Prussia mall in Pennsylvania  and it wasn't done correctly and the King of Prussia sector keeper is stuck in hell now?  Yes, he's there  Okay, that exactly happened  Yes  Weird  I mean that's the great puzzle of podcasting, conquering the mountain that is the King of Prussia mall  As someone who grew up going to the King of Prussia mall complex  Oh, you did  Oh yeah, it's quite a place  Are we now just declaring that we're going to have to eventually tackle this King of Prussia mall?  I wouldn't  Okay  To free him? Do you know him? Is he worth freeing?  No, not really  Oh  I mean, let's say you can find good prices on airfare maybe, but don't go out of your way  Okay, like you don't want, you know, I mean nobody is bad enough to rot in hell, but you know  You're a better guy, you're more worth saving  Yes, well I'm not just a guy, I'm a child  Whoa, what?  Hold on  What do you mean? What do you mean by that sector keeper?  You've asked us to be frank with you just as you are with us  Sure, I'll be frank, I'll be straightforward, boys, my boys  I was a child that was playing in the fountain outside of City Walk unsupervised like many children  The dancing fountains that Abercrombie  So yeah  Finch?  Fitch  Fitch, not Finch, Fitch  If you've ever been in the City Walk there are these like fountains, there's lights in the floor  And they shoot up fun little like, you know, streams of water and kids run in and play and they get soaked  And like parents laugh in delight to see their child have so much fun with what  Sometimes the parents aren't even present, it seems as if the children are just there, but this is a different sector  Yes, he's right  Keep yourself on track  But yeah, you were in the origin  So you were lost  You were in the fountain  Yes, I was in the fountain and my parents wandered over to Bubba Gum Shrimp to put their names in  And I perished  Oh my god, whoa, whoa, this is a real downer here  Is it too much?  I can't, you know, you can't question this guy's reality  This kid's reality  This child's reality  That was many years ago though, I am ancient  So I guess when I said Casper, it is literally what's going on here, Casper  Pretty similar to Casper  Because Casper was a child who was deceased and had unfinished business and  Now he's in hell  What? Casper is in hell? No, that's not good  We've established when attractions go away, they go to hell  So  Oh yes, yeah, you've made us aware of this  I've made that point multiple times  So, but Sector Keeper, I mean, I feel like, you know, not everyone listening is as familiar with your kingdom as we are  Yes  So just to reiterate for the listening audience, CityWalk is an outdoor shopping and dining complex next to Universal Studios Hollywood  Yes  I would call it a mixed use area  It's been called a faux street or a lifestyle center  A faux street and lifestyle center?  This is in an article about the history of it that Scott dug up  It's sort of a popular sort of development style that has grown in Los Angeles with the Grove or the Americana or Hollywood and Island  Many other major cities have a similar  Caruso  What's that?  Caruso, the man who builds the Grove and the Americana  Yes  Yes, this was a precursor to the Caruso properties  He was inspired  Perhaps the Grove and the Americana would not exist without CityWalk  And the original idea for malls in America were kind of a simulation of like a small town main street  You know, suburbia, planned communities in the 50s and 60s kind of inspired such a commuter culture, car culture  That we, America by and large lost that sort of main street drag  So the original architect who designed the first ideas for malls envisioned sort of an outdoor shopping and dining potentially with housing or services like a post office  But eventually that was kind of shelved in favor of like the indoor malls that are common throughout America  Many of them dying as online retailing has caught on  But those really rose up in the 60s  Yes  And supplanted genuine town squares  And malls often in suburbia and off to the sides of cities and the outskirts of cities as opposed to in the vital center of a genuine city  Yeah, and I mean this is almost a simulation of like a popular, a populous city street  Like downtown city center, small town main street  It's like a mutant version of it  I mean like Disneyland and main street, you know, is kind of a quaint, tinier scale version of a main street  The city walk version of like a main street is like giant, gaudy, you know, King Kong  It's like aggressive, it's very, like it is really, I can see, I do really, really like city walk  But I can see where people like find it nightmarish  Like, you know, my memories of it is just overwhelming it so much  It's like similar to Vegas maybe  Dystopian  Well, you could say it's dystopian  I mean I would say, what's like right before dystopian?  What's the word for that?  Mid-topia  Mid-topia  It's mid-topian  Like it's not, like if the King Kong was like, when we finally get into like a horrible war and like King Kong is blown up and his head is off the sign and stuff  That'll be fully dystopian  Like that would be the scariest place to be, is like a dead mall or a dead theme park  Yeah  Well, this is related to the fact, I don't know if this is the same article you were pulling from  But I read a genuinely cool article from PBS about the rise of city walk in the wake of boxed-in malls  And how they were like kind of sleek and Jetsons-esque when they started  And then by the 80s they were sort of growing predictable and homogenized and kind of just dull, not fun places to be  And they brought up the, is it Dawn of the Dead?  Yeah, that takes place in a mall  Yeah, where it becomes this realm of horror where it's like a refuge for people but they end up feeling trapped  I think people started feeling like boxed-in closed, it just became like a very stale format by the 80s  And the people were looking for ways to revitalize this concept  And so that's where we enter the architect or the designer, the man behind city walk, John Jurdy  He's the, I mean the sector keeper, your.
.
.
  Father  Yes, yeah, I was curious about, it's kind of a holy trinity thing  You are he and he is you, but you're separate entities as well  And one day we'll send someone in our image down to city walk  A third entity who is a combo of John Jurdy, a deceased architect, and you who are.
.
.
  A deceased child who drowned in dancing fountains  And who somehow preceded the existence of the fountains  You were there before it, but it was there before you as well  Precisely, Scott  This is duality to the fountain origin story  Yes, speak of Father, please  Yes, well he's a great man  Here's where, this is so genuinely my wheelhouse because I'm a fan of architecture and a fan of malls  And let me say what this guy, what John Jurdy is behind  We're talking Glendale Galleria  Yeah  We're talking, this is for my Valley or my LA Orange County people more so  The Northridge Fashion Center mall that was savagely destroyed by the Northridge earthquake  But came back and is stronger than ever today  City Walk notably survived the Northridge earthquake  I don't think anything particularly happened up there  Yeah, congrats, it was built to last  Well it had the eternal powers on its side  You got Fashion Island which is down in Newport Beach  That was a boring boxed in mall that was starting to bum people out  And he added all of the outdoor streets and corridors all around it  All of this stuff very European, it's like trying to create little tiny European towns in boring Orange County mall areas  And then in Las Vegas, Treasure Island is this man  Wow, really?  Yeah  This is like the Tony Baxter of malls  That's absolutely correct  Not only that, he and Tony Baxter were friends  What?  Yep, I found that out this morning  I read John Jurdy's eulogy or what's an article in a newspaper  An obituary  An obituary, you are wise and all knowing, thank you Sector Keeper  I read his obituary which was written by a long time Disney Imagineer  Who talked about how John Jurdy came and spoke to them  And he spoke to them from what he truly is  A father of mixed use retail space  But I think he took Imagineers on a tour of the West Edmonton Mall  He and Tony Baxter led a walk around  And they talked about, which is another, that's one of the biggest malls in North America  And Tony Baxter learned from his teachings  Truly a Christ-like figure, it's true  He also designed the color scheme and all of the temporary, what do you call it?  The temporary stuff, I don't know what the hell is the word  Temporary stuff  I'm no architect, but temporary stuff into Olympic Village in 1984  Which in Los Angeles  Temporary modular buildings  Yeah, yeah, yeah  Things that were like a bunch of flags and peach triangles flapping around in the wind  Which is so my aesthetic  Decoration is another good word  I wish I always had somebody here to give me vocabulary words  So I didn't just say stuff and things  This is exceedingly helpful  But anyway, all of these temporary decorations for the LA Summer Olympics  Which all moved when it was done to Videopolis  So you got some John Jertie stuff intermingling with the parks  And then here's something I didn't know until today  It was pretty mind-blowing  John Jertie, years before City Walk, designed something called  And you know it, you could say it with me  Satellite Newtown  There you go, I knew you knew it  Satellite Newtown was a shopping complex  Designed by John Jertie  Which was supposed to be the mixed-use shopping development surrounding Euro Disney  Oh my god  Disney Village, which we maligned for over two hours on a recent episode  Would have been designed by the man who designed City Walk  And in fact, many of the ideas he had, he was able to finally implement in City Walk  So that, as I said, the least magical mall in all of Disney-dom  It could have been a City Walk  It could have been the first one  It could have been a City Walk  It's almost like we've been called to this place by the things we love  It's almost like you were with us all this time, Sector Keeper  Every time you've purchased a snack or  Validated parking  Validated parking or went to see an IMAX premiere of a Marvel movie  I've been by your side  That's actually very comforting to know  Yeah, and listeners, lest you think like a lot of  What do we care about Southern California malls?  A lot of the places we named Glendale Galleria, the Northwich Fashion Square  Are so close to the movie studios, often used as locations  In television and film  So you've likely seen or experienced these places  These places have likely implemented, implanted in your minds, excuse me  As an idea of like a mall or a retail center  The idea of somebody who's made so many malls  Like I immediately I don't know why this is  This is just some like baby boomer bullshit in my head  But like I start thinking of his malls as different albums  So like he's U2, like the Galleria might be like Joshua Tree  It's a real classic, it's good, it's very  It works very much as a standard mall  But like City Walk Hollywood is like U2's pop  And some people don't like it  It's a lot, it's a body, it's in your face  It's abrasive but it's risky  But it's risky, City Walk is more of a risk  It's a different type of it  It's a later part of his career I think  I think because of sure  How would you then rank, I left a few out  I left a major one out  The Mall of fucking America  Really, he was the Mall of America guy  So what's that in U2?  No, I said Joshua Tree Galleria  What's the biggest U2 album?  Well, Octon Baby is my favorite  But maybe that would be like a double album  U2 never really had like a double album  So I mean maybe  The Mall of America is so good  It's as good as a non-existent U2 double album done at their peak  Something they were too lazy to get around to doing  John Jertie did, it's called The Mall of America  Which album is stuck in the moment on?  That's from All That You Can't Leave Behind in 2000  That's when they came back with Beautiful Day  That's sort of your return to form album  Did he have a return to form where he made like kind of a Galleria type?  Like it was a later period but sort of a standard mall  It wasn't very risky  I don't know if this qualifies as that but  Maybe the Bellagio  Oh really?  I saw a sketch today of that main atrium  That they change out for every season in the Bellagio  And I saw this guy hand sketch what that was going to look like  So that's a good, that's like a later, an essential piece  Many years after what you might think would be the peak  And by the way, Sector Keeper, you know, you're very busy  You've had a lot going on over all these years  But there were Sam Goodies back in the 2000s at CityWalk  You know, you should have checked out U2 while you had the chance  I know, I regret it  There's digital ways  You could still listen to U2 though, the albums are available  No, I can't  Not until you free me  Oh man, you can't listen to music until we free you?  You can only hear Despacito or whatever loop they're playing up at CityWalk  I can only hear what's being played at CityWalk  So you probably know a lot of like top 40, you know, broad stage urine kind of  Yes, but don't ask me too many questions about it  Okay, sounds good, yeah, we don't want to get too off track  We have a lot to cover  You're not a music guy, you're a mall spirit  No, I'm a spirit, yes  You're a mall spirit  But you try to be aware of other topics  Right, and sometimes it just sounds like a cacophony of sounds  because many of the different buildings are playing their own music  So Margaritaville will be playing Mr.
 Buffett's music  And The Raiders Store will be playing its own music  The Raiders Fight Song  The Raiders Fight Song over again  And you just see how those two things mix together and it just sounds like a disaster  That's a note that I wrote down when I, this is a different sector  So I'll keep it fast, please don't punish me  But I had a brief meal at Wasabi and I jotted down that CityWalk is truly the capital, the world capital of competing music  Which on the Hard Rock, we talked on the episode and that was, and I'm forgetting the man's name, Hard Rock Park guy  Who created the park  John Binkowski, right?  John Binkowski, yes  John Binkowski was very proud of his theme park for not having music bleed  He would have a fucking fit if he went to CityWalk  Maybe he's been, maybe that's part of why he inspired it  You know, I made fun of that music bleeding thing  But now when you go to a place that is full of music bleed, it does show not that there's anything wrong with it  CityWalk is perfect  We don't want to offend you, Sectorkeeper, by saying there's too much sound bleed  But you know, if we had a minor note, that might be it, one of them  It's okay, thank you  I'm open to constructive feedback  That's very good  I thought you'd be upset about that  I'm open to it  I'm a yesander  I took, I took classes at UCB  Oh wow, really?  Still got a chance  That's good  That's great, yeah  Jason and I did a couple years ago  Okay  Well, I guess he doesn't want to talk about that anymore  I'm impressed  With, you know, that's fair  Everyone in the city says they do UCB now  So according to their resumes  If I can use sound bleed as a jumping off point into our first sector of discussion  Absolutely  Boys, I'm getting weak  Please  We have to talk  Please discuss Sector 1  Uh huh  Yeah, so we went and experienced Sector 1  Yes  May I remind you what Sector 1 is?  Yes, please  Sector 1, Billabong, Popcornopolis, Fossil, Zenzone, Angel  Yes, and the  Thank you, Sectorkeeper  The, you know, the sound bleed we definitely experienced at the Zenzone  I felt like  Oh, I see what you're saying  So we're going to start, do you want to start with Zenzone?  Do you want to start or should we build?  Is that allowed?  Or do we have to go in order?  Do we have to go in order?  That gives me strength, yes  Start with Zenzone  So we're going, yeah, we'll start with Zenzone  So yeah, so the Zenzone, we had to put a little teaser in  This is how I always start with Zenzone  Is a place we could go in a coffin and get massaged by water  That's what it looked like to me  It was like this big weird thing where they would put like a half MRI machine down on you  And then somehow water would massage you  I never went in there, I never  We were curious to go in there  We were never curious, yeah, I was like, ah, that must be just some, like  Like I never got a massage at a shopping mall  Yeah  Like, which is always like, I just, I don't know, my brain doesn't even think about it  Without even, it's just, there's no door, there's no back area of this massage place  It's just facing out to the open marketplace of CityWug  Right, so  Yeah, this is not a traditional like massage place with private rooms  Where you strip down to a level you're comfortable with and then aren't solid  It's one of the things it says, I should have, I don't have it written down  But it says like, keep your clothes on  Keep your clothes on and also you will not get wet  Yes  Because everyone thinks like, oh, I'm going to get drenched  Right, which I think you would prefer because you love to get wet at a theme park  Oh, I love to get wet, yeah  But this is not the case, it's basically like there's water jets  But there's like this like kind of tarp thing that separates you from the water  And it massages you through it  So you're basically getting hit by the tarp  Like the tarp is massaging you  Yeah  But it's using the pressure of the water that's shooting  We'll put a picture of this on because it might be confusing  Like a power washer shooting at your body  Yes, thank you, that, yes, exactly  With a tarp in between  And yes, the tarp in between is making sure that you're not wet  It's like you're driving through a car wash  Yes, right, and because it goes up and down your body  And you're on your stomach like you would be  Now we've all experienced this  We all went and did this  We all went and did it  We all went and did it, yes  And my wife came and took some photographs  Which will be up on the Twitter, you're welcome  She said before we went  Well, I got to go and get pictures of you guys in like the aqua suits  I think in her mind we were going to put on some weird like  Oh, oh  Blue tarp suits  So everyone is unclear of what before this we started  No one knew quite how this worked  Yeah, and unfortunately we don't have photos of us in aqua superhero wardrobe  We just wear our regular clothes, which is very convenient  Yes, and then obviously it's designed for somebody who's like walking away from the park or to the park  Because they don't there's no time for anything here with a massage  There's no time to put a towel on you  Like they want to make sure if there's a demand  Which we'll get to in a second  There will not be a demand  There very rarely seems to be a demand at this place  And we should mention we beat it open  We were there before it opened  We even gave them all time City Walk opened at 10  We were there at 1030  When 11 rolled around it's still not open  Just rolling up the doors  We were like lazily open around 11  We were able to  What's that?  I went recently  Oh you popped in  Michael brought me  Yeah so  What you guys were hanging out without me?  So basically so yeah so we went yesterday  The sector keeper couldn't make it yesterday  He was busy  Understandably  I'm not sure what it was he can if he wants to explain he can  But yeah so we went again today I took him today  Or he was there already excuse me  So I didn't go back in there but he experienced it again  Our associate said I'm so glad you're here  I haven't talked to anyone today  Yeah so the gentleman that was helping us there  Very nice yeah he was  He clearly wanted to talk to another human being  No one had been in there  Which is the same thing we had found yesterday  Well we were the first ones there  We were the first ones there  So yeah especially in the morning this place is a low trafficked place  And we have to give credit to the woman working there when we were there  She was very nice she gave us extra time  Yeah so we were trying  So we're breaking it down like there's different like it's you can do a seven minute version of it  You can do a ten minute version you can do fifteen  So we're trying to break down with her  Like so what's the difference like do you get an extra relaxing one if it's ten minutes and she's like no it's just longer  Like fifteen minutes is just the same thing but it's longer  And it's like okay well then we'll just do the short one  And she's like no one's here we'll give you extra time  Which I wasn't quite clear on so I was expecting a seven minute massage  Yes and then his time is dragging out it's like  Did they forget about me?  Yes I have noise cancelling headphones on has some apocalypse occurred and I'm just left here  That's funny because the sector keeper said the same thing this morning when we were there  He said he expected to come out and the whole world was different  I was like in rags or something like come on we have to go there's a there's an attack of some kind  It does feel fitting that we were all essentially baptized to begin this journey  Yes  Father was happy  Father was pleased with that  Father was pleased  Bless you John thank you John  Bless you John thank you John  Yeah so she opens up this like this top of this like it looks kind of like a tanning bed basically  She opens up the top and so she loads yesterday we were talking about yesterday  She loads the three of us on them  Three of the four of these and we're immediately taking up three of the four spots  Which maybe has not happened in weeks at ZenZone  Yeah this is the most anyone's ever talked about ZenZone too at this point  We've already hit the record  And no one's ever talked more about it than this  So yeah so we get face down and she puts these noise canceling headphones on  And she tells me there's two buttons  One button is to stop the jets  So say the jet hits you in the lower back and man does that feel good  You hit the button and you use a blast your lower back with water  The other button is to stop the thing if something's going wrong or you feel scared or something  And I love the fact that the button to stop it is a big comical red button  I think that which is a great design I mean it's hard to mess up  Yes but it looks like Wile E.
 Coyote has one of his controls  When he was trying to blow the Roadrunner up he would hit this button  Very ACME  Yeah ACME branded buttons  So the three of us load in which has to be a funny photo  Is there a picture of all three of our heads sticking out somewhere?  Yeah all of us with the headphones on face down  Because you're in the regular massage chair  Help me with vocabulary again if you can with this little donut opening  The Zen Zone  Oh that's the zone, it's the hole in the face rest  If you get like a sitting massage or like a face down massage  Yeah there's usually a hole for your face sort of thing  This is like being massaged by the ocean  By the ocean  So we're in there for a while because we all thought we were doing 7 minutes  Or when she said I'll give you a little extra I thought she would give us like maybe 10  5 minutes yeah so like extra 10, 11, 12  At a certain point I went I've been in here for 30 minutes  It feels like I've been in here for a half hour  I don't know if that's true we never actually confirmed how long it was  That would have been a good question  By the least Scott's way I said it was about 20 minutes  Oh it was 20 okay  How long was the sector keeper in?  Oh today so I think that you were in I think it was 15 minutes  15 or so  But also all eternity  But also we were supposed to be in there for 10  But yeah so I think it's just when it's running low  They will really give you a deal they'll give you a nice the nice thing  So show up at opening that's your city walk  That's a good tip  Yeah get there not at 10 it's not going to be open at 10  But when they like decide to show up for an 11  Which I you know hey I can't fault them for the late entry  Because they were so awesome once we were doing it  And also most of the other stores we tried to go to before 11 had not yet opened  Yeah I mean they obviously know the audience  They know that there's not a line forming outside ZenZone at 10am every day at City Walk  They've probably figured this out through trial and error  Even Popcornopolis I may have been the first customer of the day at like 11.
30 or something  That's not the first time that's happened though  All right  Zing I got you  Sector keeper likes that  Right  He's like 10 mega clouds  Jason yelling let me in outside Popcornopolis  Yeah no no of course not no one does that  No one lines up outside City Walk they're trying to get to the park  The theme park  That's a thing you know a lot of these stores certainly at 10 in the morning  You'd have to regard as you know essentially flyover states in store form  Yes  They're being blasted through  You know what I missed by the way entirely in the history of it is that  Like they basically like needed a path that would get you from the parking garages to the park  There may have been some I forget where you parked initially in the early days of the pre City Walk days  The shameful pre City Walk days  But also the path was set up to connect the theme park to the movie theater  And the movie theater never moved  That's a strange thing about it  But like cars used to drive right out front of it  Like that was just a regular street up there  So the whole impetus of City Walk besides to create a glorious Xanadu of perfection  Was to connect the movie theater to the theme park  Much like the time lapse footage of cities growing or like the opening sequence of Up  Where a city of rises around Carl's little home  City Walk rose from the ground  I can't wait to see Up  When we say you're free you can do it  There's so much great pop culture  I'm familiar but haven't seen it  You get to see posters but not the actual films or listen to the records  So you know you pretty much know of many things  You don't know a lot of things specifically  Yeah you'll eventually  I mean what's big in the 2000s  You got a couple of those Da Vinci Code movies  Angels and Demons I think was great  Robert Langdon yes  You got a lot to look forward to there  Yeah 2000 era I mean Bruce Springsteen album The Rising  Sort of the back of the E Street band he came back with them  The White Stripes Lego music video  Ah fun  We fell in love with a girl  The Strokes I guess  Cool  They were a good band  This show called Will and Grace was on for a long time  And then they went away and then came back  It was a show not just with one actor  It was an ensemble show  You got all kinds of things  We'll try to motor through this whole series  You see how necessary it is right  We're trying to set your soul free  We're moving I think as fast as we possibly could through all of these stores  I think everyone listening would agree we're gunning it  So yeah Zenzone I guess  Yes thank you we're back  Yeah I mean I think we all two different  I think we all kind of agreed like oh that was nice  It was pretty pleasant  Yeah so yeah you're in there and you're face down and the thing is going up  And at first yeah like it's odd you get used to it  Because you're getting shot by a tarp  Like you're getting watered  Water via a tarp I don't know which better way to put it  Very repetitive  Yes it's the same up and down up and down  And it tickled my legs and feet  That was the thing that happened  But then she came by and she goes  Do you want it harder  And I said yes I do  So she cranked it up on me  As did I  And Jason also requested it harder  Scott did you ask for harder  I did not I don't remember being asked  Did she ask you  Maybe not  She may have noticed  We were also using the  I was using the button a lot  I was really focusing it on my shoulders  Were you using a button either  I tried it once and I don't think it stopped it  I don't think it stopped  On a pressure point  But I kind of wanted  I got accustomed to it but I initially  Hated it like the first few seconds  I looked up at my wife  Like oh god get me out of this thing  But by the end  After you know  500 back and forth  If you ticklish like the key  If you ticklish like the keeper  Is  The leg section is tough  Yeah yeah yeah  When it like traveled  Like you know  The up top  Midpoint the butt and the feet  I felt great but the middle  Runs I had a hard time  Not to be crass but I think it really  Tickled my bottom  Now that's not crass  Look I noticed that about myself as well  I was feeling very ticklish on the bottom  I think that it like  It was like jostling and like you could  If you I would stop it in certain  Places and one time I did like stop it right  In the middle  It's not a bad  Tickling no and I wasn't trying to do  A sex thing or anything I was just like  Trying to like stop it in places and see how  It would feel or whatever and I think I got it right  In the middle of the butt and that  Yes that is I  Probably giggled I think  My nose cancelling headphones  Didn't let me know you couldn't know how embarrassing  The noise I had made was  Now the sound bleed I had mentioned earlier  I had to say at some point they  Turned on what I can only describe as  Zen house music oh yeah and  I was hearing that and  A little bit of the city walk  Ambience  Like through  The headphones but that  May also have been because I experienced  Something I don't know that you guys did  Being a shorter man  I kept scooching backwards  To get further into the  Coffin  Because I wanted it to get my neck  But then when I got it to a spot  Where it would hit my neck and upper shoulders  It was knocking against the headphones  So I think it knocked the headphones loose  A little okay this makes a lot of sense  Because I got out first  So I got out first and you guys had a couple minutes  Left yeah because it kind of staggered us  Getting in so we all got out within a few  Minutes of each other right so I'm  Looking at both of you guys heads face down  And Scott just looks his head is face down and not  Moving I looked at you you look like  You were getting pummeled you look  Like you were rattling like I guess it's to the higher  Water pressure but I was like it looks  Like somebody's beating him up like face  Down someone's punching you in the head  I was trying to get it like on  My shoulder and I felt  Great like for much  Of the rest of the day although I woke up this morning  And a different part of my  Shoulders felt like shit now that  May have just been I was tossing and turning at night  I don't want to chalk that up entirely  To the Zen zone but  I did think like a lying  It's not the Zen zone okay  But when I got out of the coffin  I did find like where  The capsule I guess coffin is  A little it's also like a little like the photon  Torpedo when they put Spock in at the  End of search or the  End of Wrath of Khan when he dies and they put him  In the photon torpedo and shoot him out which by  The way is a crazy way to send a man  To bury a man  Is to shoot him out in a torpedo  Where do you get into the space  Shoot him into space I mean it's search  For Spock like they have to find it which is  Why don't you just keep his corpse around  Which doesn't make any sense but anyway  It's similar it felt similar to that like  I was being loaded into a torpedo I was  Buried in  In the Zen zone oh  In one of the it was used as a coffin that was  My coffin oh my god yes  Well one thing  The associate told us when  Michael and I visited is that  For a used capsule  It's sixteen thousand dollars  For a new one it is twenty five thousand  Dollars yeah we talked about  The new you found out the prices of yes  The sector keeper was the one who asked the question  I thought it was actually a very good question because the  Machines look a little old to me too it looks like  I think sector keeper pointed out this  Looked like something that would be in Barbara Streisand's house  In 1992 like  Like a rich person would be like  This is how I relax this new fangled  Piece of technology  Which I think is very accurate I think  It was an early city walk  Location I don't know if it's been there since opening  But it's been a long time through all  Of the two thousands it would seem  Yeah it's a very it's a sharper image  Kind of yes extremity  Yeah  Would  Would you get one would anyone  Get one I would  What if it cost more reasonable  What if it cost a thousand  Dollars well I'm very  So you're so you're set  I don't know  I mean I liked it  I don't know if I would do it all  The time it's got look it takes up a lot  Of room first of all a lot of room  And you need a voltage  Converter the associate told me  Is that did you ask  I did ask that yes  So they have that built  Into the side yes I would be interested  To see I would have to try  I would just go back to the Zen zone and try it a few more  Times to really see if I could get the most of it  Like I would be interested to like to see if  I could turn a little bit of my side see if I could get it  To like hit me at different angles I  Would love to see if we could crank it up even more than  What the water pressure was like let's  See how far we can take this like let's see  If it actually like if because they probably  Don't want you getting hurt in there obviously  But maybe if it was a little higher water  Pressure like it would really like work some stuff  Because I didn't feel like when I would stop it on certain  Points in my back I'd be like man that is  Like stretching me out like yeah  So I don't know I mean I  Found also I didn't think  Was outrageously priced I mean  Everywhere around here you have to  Account for like a theme park  Tax like you have to pay a little more of a  Premium yes and  And what happens is which they don't tell  You and this happened to  Me and then to you guys after you got  Out is that you're not  Only getting just the water massage  When you go in there there are some  Little add-ons perks that perks  Yes that they give you and they don't  Even ask you if you want them they just start  Doing stuff to you yeah  Little massage rollers little  Head scratchers yes are getting sprayed  Down you get sprayed down I wasn't  Marbles on you they put marbles on you  I wasn't even doing anything today I was  Just sitting and watching the sector keeper enjoying  His aqua massage and  The the gentleman came over and he  Goes I'll hold your hands on I go what and he's just  Just spraying me down and I was like oh I'm  Okay I'm doing this too I guess  So like they will just  Aromatherapy  So yeah so what happened yesterday is I was done  And I decided to spend the extra ten dollars  And do the oxygen bar as well  A real holdover from  The early to mid  2000s oxygen bars were  The hit of the Jersey Shore for a  Couple of oh really yeah did you ever  Go as a you know absolutely not okay  But the the parents no no  No no no okay it was a very  It was a trendy thing  It was a trendy thing I think  People some people maybe it made them a little  Little light headed yeah well oxygen  Makes you high I learned that from Brad  Pitt and Fight Club  Yeah I think from the plate  Right they pump in oxygen if the mass  Comes down yes Tyler Durden  Tyler Durden yeah so where's the movie  You're gonna love it sector keeper yeah  He says that you're as peaceful as you do  In the behalf of Choke as a kid but  Oh wow that's one of the things you got  Before the accident yes  Oh okay looked up shit before your  Spirit ascended yeah that's a  Bummer I'm sorry it's okay okay  So you did the Electroshock  Thing you did the oxygen bar  I got the oxygen bar I chose Bayberry  As the flavor of oxygen  Because I wanted to revitalize  It was the silly I always do that I picked the  Silliest name I wanted to revitalize which is what it  Said it would do to me and then they like  She like  She gives me basically what you  Wear when you need oxygen in the hospital  Which is scary I thought it was  Gonna be like a fun caterpillar hookah  Like I'm gonna have this long thing and I'm gonna take  Puffs and I'll be very provisorial  No it's an oxygen line  It's like a plastic oxygen line that goes into your nostrils  Yeah these two little things that go into oxygen  I sent a text to my girlfriend Lindsay  And she goes oh my god it looks like you're sick  And I was like yeah it does and it's like  It's a very weird look and I'm like  Just looking out onto all the people  That are walking to the theme park and I have this thing  Stuck in my nose and I'm just inhaling  Bayberry  But to give again to give them credit  I didn't really feel like  Upsold  They had lots of  Kitchy holistic crap  In there and they did not really  Like push that hard  So after so I'm doing this and then she comes over  And she just starts with these like weird what did you call  Marble what it like it's like a weird  Massager attached to a glove  Something my mom would have bought  In 1998 or something like  Most of the technology seems like it's a little  Old  Yes yes  They buy all their stuff from  Brookstone and she starts rubbing my back  And I was like oh okay and I'm like oh no  Is this going to be like there's  We'll see on the bill like three dollars for  Rubbing you with marbles you know two  Dollars for whatever for rubbing  Your head with that weird like I don't even  Know what to call it like these like pronged  This pronged thing that they started rubbing all of our  Heads with  That old timey  Brain and head shape science  That is not  Phrenology  Yeah it seemed like a phrenology implement  Like they were measuring us for some reason  Head scratching calipers  My mom does have that  That a head thing not the measuring thing  The actual head  Massager she didn't like make you compete  With your sister  No no no  No she was not like that  She would never do that  So yeah I thought that was all going to be  Added up and they also  Hooked electrodes to my back  This is again and they did this to me  Again today even though I wasn't buying  Anything they just hooked this  Gentleman hooked things to me again  And the sector keeper as well  So in the last 48 hours  And set it to 40 minutes  Yeah he would have let us  Sit there getting electrocuted  We excused ourselves  I almost did that when I was  Up there like I almost said like  Oh you know what I gotta use the bathroom can I  Pay can I cash out  Yeah I was getting antsy and  Aaron's plan  Was to like go into the park for a second  And go on you know one of the rides  That's 20 feet away  But she's initially like oh 7 minutes  I'll just wait around and then we're there for a full hour  She could have gone on Harry Potter twice  This was like Zen Zone  Is the equivalent of like  A lonely guy who just  Wants to hang cause like  Yesterday again they didn't say  Like oh would you like complimentary  Electrode service where we electrocute  The muscles by your neck and shoulders  All of a sudden she's just like oh hold on a second  And I'm like wait one second  Like sticking things to my back and then I go  Like this thing just like  Jolts you every couple seconds and you  Have a little thing that can  Control how strong it was  So the Sector Keeper and I today were trying to see  How hard we could go with it  And it goes up to what 10?  Yes Sector  Keeper could only handle 7 Sector  Keeper went up to 7 I tried 7 for  A second and it was like I was  Being tortured like  It was no fooling like you could  You could get information out of somebody  By using this thing also  The control looked like a Sony  MP3 player yes  We had 10 years ago oh so yesterday  Yeah so yesterday I had one that was wired  Today we had bluetooth controlled  So he used the better tech on us  And we were holding this little thing  And he set it to 40 minutes yesterday I think mine was set  To 30 minutes and I was like 30 minutes  When you're just with losers like  Us you don't get the full bluetooth treatment  But when you're hanging with the Sector Keeper  He's just trying to impress him  I think the gentleman today also liked us  A lot I think he was very interested  In the woman yesterday very friendly  Very friendly very nice guy he kind of  Clasped my hand a little bit when  He put the control in my hand yes  Yes very  Just a massage therapist  Vibe yes and he actually  I think was he targeted  So yeah so I'm sitting there waiting for the Sector Keeper  To finish and all of a sudden  He just comes over and sprays me down  And he's like oh uh uh uh uh cause then  I'm like oh is he gonna give me a charge? Did he ask if you were  Allergic cause they asked me yesterday  He just could tell  This guy's been at it so long he can tell  What my allergies are so all of a sudden  He just comes over and he goes oh turn around  And I go oh okay and then he puts I'm like oh  Fuck I'm getting electrocuted again  I'm getting more he just snuck you  Into it without your consent  He warmed up a uh  A shoulder pillow and put it on  Our shoulders we both got shoulder  Pillows and we're getting electrocuted and he's like so what do you do  And we're like oh okay  Like and we're like he's just  Like this it's like the same you heard  The trick where when you see like a person outside  A supermarket that wants to sell you something or get a donation  The trick is you put a book  In their hand cause then the book sort of  Ties you to that person so you don't  Leave them and then they can give you the whole spiel  Of whatever they're trying to sell you or something and then  At that point like hopefully you just fork over  Money or agree to something he has a different  Tactic it's put a warm heating  Pad on the shoulders and an electrocuter  On their back  And they can't go anywhere they ain't running  Into the theme park they're not going across the way  We were stuck there  It's only it's not in pursuit of more money  Cause you didn't pay more money it wasn't in  Pursuit of company yes  Cause that's what I was like oh no is he gonna like charge me  Like ten dollars now cause like yesterday  Cause like yesterday your wife  Erin did not  No one came by her and was like sit down  Here I'm putting a thing on you it was like clearly  Like oh she's not doing a service not the  Case for me I got the full  Extra treatment other than  Being in the water coffin  It was so and then not  You didn't pay a cent  I did not I mean I tipped now I had  The tip extra which is the whole thing because  If somebody does a sort of a free service  I still feel like oh I got a tip probably what the tip  Would have been if I had the service  I the sector keeper feels  He was happy  The employee was happy that  We were sober  Cause he told a tale of a  Drunk man who went into the  Water coffin and shot  Out like superman  Yeah he was drunk and he  Crawled out the front and like before  It was over before he was sober he used his  Arms to just propel himself out of  It and so I think he  Was happy yeah he was  Did he pee on his way out  He leave a trail he did not  Mention any Erin but he said that was the  Craziest thing that he had ever seen is a  Man drunk crawling his way  Out the front which if you see well you see this photo  It's a pretty small opening  And you shouldn't do it he should have just hit the  Comically large acme stop button  Right so yeah we  Were very calm he did other guys  Came in though yes and did  A quick one and he massaged their  Head and then they left  So I don't know why he didn't  I don't know why he didn't  Like give them the full service  You were with the sector keeper I guess  That you know what now it makes a lot of  Sense I they probably also  Seemed like less engaged  In what was going on  There maybe what was happening around  I gotta say I was happy to see  After we got out and we were like finishing up  The woman  Working there went around and disinfected  All the bits that we were in  I was happy to see that let me bring this  Up and this is I'm sure you  Probably noticed this sector keeper because I know  You like you germs and stuff I know  Historically that you don't love germs  Correct  I didn't drown in the fountain  I died of a staph infection  Oh really? Geez oh no  So that's why  Your urine and blood got in your eyes  So that's why  Now I understand why the germs  But apparently they're in there for  Seven minutes and yet  So the gentleman today  Brought over other instruments  That hadn't been used on me  Yesterday oh and he  Started doing a thing where he would use  The same instrument on  The sector keeper than me  So he would have like a look for lack of a  Better word a buzzy dildo kind of thing  And he'd come over and he'd like  Drive it into my back a little bit which by the way he did  Know what he was doing he could find he could feel  What was happening he did a very good job then he would take  It and he'd go buzz the  Sector keepers back and I would be like  Mmm okay shouldn't you be using  Two different dildos for this  Skin to skin  Yeah and then like the same with  With the head thing too he would like  Put it on yeah your head and then my head  And I'd be like shouldn't we both have different head  Things again I wasn't worried  But like I guess he assumed we knew each other  And we were comfortable sharing  A head massager  Yeah you know each other's  Lice situation which hopefully  Is minimal.
 Hopefully we have a few  Lice in our hair.
 But if you end up in hell  You'll have nothing but lice  Yes that's been one of the threats  That's one of the things that happens to you  It's a bunch of millipedes running around  Your hair.
 Yes  Please please  We'll try to save you from it I mean one way  That we could help you is by  Moving on to a loose clothing store  Boys I'm getting weak  I'm getting weak I need you to move on  Oh okay okay okay  Are you sure? Please  If it pleases you we're also happy to keep talking  About ZenZone for another hour  It is time to move on  ZenZone has been an object of interest  Of all of ours for many years  It's understandable why it would linger  On it.
 I think we can  Let's through some of these others a little more quickly  I don't think every store will go through  For as long but probably most  Probably most.
 I mean we  Yeah when we were talking about doing this  I think we were like well you know some of the things  We're not going to be able to talk about a lot  We've hit the hour mark already on this episode  Ah very good  Let's keep talking about time  Let's talk about talking  Right or left?  Walk out of the store you're facing Ludo's chicken  I need you to go left to Billabong  Billabong  Billabong really is the first  Store if you're  If you were leaving the park for the day  That's the first one that you see  And it was a very  You know notable  Part of the city walk skyline  In that the roof of the building is a big surf  Board.
 It's the big surf board  Fin and I remember at some point  In time it was painted kind of like  Cowhide colors  So it was a big piece to let you know  This area you're going to enter is going to be  Crazy kooky  Sure and it's a little more  Tasteful in its color scheme now  And I went and poked around  This is something I want to bring up for future  Episodes I think we have to  When it's a store that's in lots of different  Types of malls we have to talk about  Well how have they  City walk a fight at? How have they stepped up  Their game on this major  Stage? Well that's an easy  Call for this one because there's a  Fucking wave pool right out front  Jason it's Jason it's  Jason it's gone  Jason I didn't even  Notice.
 It's gone the sector  Keeper said hey what about the water in front of Billabong  I think it's gone it's gone  They got rid of it.
 The wave pool  How did you not notice this yesterday?  I we were so.
 Sector keeper don't get angry  I'm going to leave  Okay you better not pull that  Shit every time something happens  I mean look  It was probably very  Wasteful during the drought during  The year long drought.
 A boring  Answer but universal is all about  Wasting of water and blasting  It into your face and giving you massages  With it.
 God.
 I want as much  Water wasted at universal as possible  And it was one of those things  Like I don't know why the first time you guys went to  City walk but I grew up with it and it was  My family and I would make a special  Trip every Christmas  To go see city walk lit  Up at Christmas time  And it was  Like it was a pretty like  Special experience you know we'd go  We'd also pop into things if we went  To universal studios but  You know city walk visits were a big deal  And I remember the first time walking through there  Thinking like well there's just like a little  Miniature beach thing  Like we stood and looked at it for a long time  I loved the wave pool.
 I remember the wave pool  Yeah it was cool.
 It's now a ledge  Where tired parents sit  Yeah they do need as much of that as  Possible universal.
 Makes sense  Real quick  A billabong is an Australian  Term for a lake or pond  Left behind after a river  Changes course.
 Really?  Very common in Australia  I thought it was like a droga like not  Bong necessarily but it felt like a hipper  Kind of that's like a real formal  Sort of name  It's a company that a surf company  A surf style company that  Originated in Australia  Billabong mentioned  In the Australian folk song Waltzing Matilda  You guys know Waltzing Matilda?  It is  It's old enough for the Sectorkeeper to know it  Yeah it's not in the 90's  I like it for Jason to know it too.
 My favorite song  It's about a swag man who  Can't buy a billabong.
 It's a song filled  With like Australian  Terms and stuff  Can you sing us the part where billabong is said?  Yeah  Down came a jump buck to drink  At the billabong  Jumped the swag man and grabbed him with  Glee.
 He sang as he jumped  The jump buck in his talker bag  You'll come a Waltzing Matilda  With me  Wow  And then the chorus Waltzing Matilda  Waltzing Matilda  You'll come a Waltzing Matilda  With me.
 He sang as he shoved  That jump buck in his talker bag  You'll come a Waltzing Matilda  With me  Jump buck is a male sheep.
 A talker bag  Is what like a traveling itinerant  Australian man  Carries  Scott is the sectorkeeper's  Thing  I feel weak too  I feel weak too  Anyway I know  Of billabong  I was never like a  Skate wear  Street surf wear  Kind of kid  I've always worn Vans a lot I guess  Or Tucker pants or whatever  What would you wear when you went  Waltzing with Matilda  Like a puffy shirt  Like a peasant shirt  I was in school  With Matilda  So you waltzed with her  Yes  But it stopped there because you're  You're a gentleman  A gentleman child  Billabong the shop is  Beautiful because it's always 1996  Inside  Yeah it is  Gives you a vibe of like  Not like 90s pop punk  Even though that's not what they're going for  But that is what I associate with it  Everything was beautiful and nothing hurt  Jesus  That's what I think  Of the 90s  The child ghost  Hey well I think it's  Time to keep moving on  To  Fossil the watch store  Yes thank you thank you Scott  What is Fossil doing at City Walk  Is my question  That one of all of them is not even  That's not elevated at all  There was never a wave pool  Not a big surfboard  There should be a giant watch  Bare minimum  I feel like it's gotten more Apple story  As the years go on  I feel like Fossil stores I used to associate  With a lot of inventory on the floor  And now it feels like  There's barely anything on the shelves  A quartz watch  Yeah  And like high fashion  It's trying to go more for high fashion  I guess that is what maybe City Walk  Is trying to now do in general  Because there's a Sephora there which is a little bit of a fancier store  But like I think  There should be like  Some made up clock store  Like Clockface's watch  Watch Emporium or something  There's a Clockface man  It's not fantastical enough  Yeah and I think maybe that's probably unfortunately  The way City Walk is going is they're probably going to start putting  Maybe more high end-y stuff like this in  Although this has been there  For a while  I feel like it looks newer to me  Yeah it's maybe gotten  Blender inside but yeah I agree  We're just getting into it's just becoming  Kind of a standard mall  As all malls are getting  You know you don't have the  The mall I grew up next to  Had a food court called Chowzers  With a Z and every  Store had a toothpick  With like the little toothpick  Frilly  Confetti on the end of it  And like you know  There's no reason to have that  You know production  Value and cartoon  Silliness but it made me love  Chowzers and remember it and talk about it on  A podcast and the more City Walk  Gets bland the more it loses  Grounds to places like The Grove  And the Americana  Yeah that's true yeah I mean if this was all  Just sort of a high end like  You know Beverly Hills mall  What's the point what is it City Walk anymore?  I mean I get the idea of people  Splurging when they're on vacation  But like Fossil is like a  That's a  That's a real  Like that's a like a $200  Messenger bag  It's a lot of leather goods  It's a lot of chunky watches  Yeah  Has anyone here bought a Fossil watch ever?  My sister did in the 90s  With a  Heyday of Billabong? Yes  I hope you'll be reunited with her  When this is all set up That would be lovely  I have a Fossil wallet  Someone gave me for Christmas  A few years ago that I use every now  And then but I was  I'm not like really a leather guy or a watch  Guy  The Fossil store  I'm disappointed a lot of fans  Some people like  Leather  You're not a leather daddy?  I  We try to keep it a little cleaner  Here Sector Keeper  I try to keep my personal life off of this  I'm sorry Your child mind  Is more perverted than it should be  The Fossil store at  City Walk Universal  City Walk Hollywood  Not only lacks imagination  Michael and I noticed  It lacks watches  There's a whole empty rack  That's supposed to be like watch like display  The very first rack  It is completely empty  As if someone had  Stolen all of them  It's like a kid just running by  Collecting them all on his arm  It's interesting because they're trying to  Compete too in like the smart watch  Category so they have  Giant facimiles of their  Smartwatches in the window  The Google powered smartwatches  You can get a  Buckner NS City Bag  For $118  You can get a Nasher  Backpack for $128  So it's not so bad  That's a little expensive for people  Let's demand the fans chip in  And buy Jason one of these bags  Get him a Buckner or get him a  Rory Courier Bag  Or if you want to go high end  There's one called the Defender Portfolio  That I think would look nice  That looks sharp on Jason  Oh you know what never mind I take all that back  Get him the Estate Casual  Leather Backpack  Because he's a leather daddy  From here on out  You were too definitive that you weren't a leather daddy  Thus now you are  You didn't deny it buddy  Alright  Oh no  Oh growing weak  Boys  I think it's time to go  To a city within a city  It's time for  Popcornopolis  I'm sorry we've left you hanging for so long  You know what all comedy  Podcasts should have  A weak ghost to keep them on track  Boys, boys  Don't bring Bugsy back let him die the first time  So Popcornopolis  I did patron I went into  Popcornopolis and  I figured should sample some  Of the wares and bought a cone  Of churro corn  Tried a couple flavors  You can get free samples  They offer you free samples  Can I ask how  My feeling on samples  Is that I will never ask  For samples I only pick and  I eat I don't know what it is  I feel like I'm wasting their time  I know this is an unpopular opinion  I know you will get a sample of as many as they tell you  They'll say limit three and you will get three  So you're being a  Sweets and treats boy  Is usurped  Overridden by you being a good boy  Yes I think that is sort of what I feel  I feel like well I haven't paid for this  So I feel bad even having a little ice cream  Or a little of the popcorn and also I feel like  Maybe from being raised by my mom  Telling me that I was not a picky  Eater that I go well I'll enjoy it  So like anything I order  I will like if I order ice cream if I order  A meal I'm not I'll never see  This is horrible like I'll just enjoy it  So you're a helpful trade  In a theme park  I want to know what I'm getting into I only got two  Sample I sampled the Chicago style  Which is caramel corn and cheddar corn together  Which I liked fine but the sign outside  Add Truro corn and big  Letters I'm like oh I'm interested in that  I like a cinnamon like  I like cinnamon as a flavor  Or like roasted  Cinnamon nuts or  In this case sweet cinnamon  Popcorn and it was really tasty  I thought it was good I had a little bit of it  I've had  I've had their popcorn before  Pretty good pretty good quality  Pretty good I do think it's very funny they call it  Gourmet popcorn like every  Now and then you see gourmet blank  Right I always wonder what does that really mean  What does that really mean  I mean they have a lot of interesting they had a cupcake  Flavor of popcorn  Yes they had a lot of I mean there was no way we could  Like they didn't know we were theme park  Journalists because I think they would have rolled out the red carpet for us  If they shared and they would have had all the samples  Probably out like laid out and we would have been able to kind of come behind the counter  They were willing to give samples though  Very willing to give samples and I said oh I like  I'll take the Truro corn and  Just a small  I didn't want that much and they gave me  A like  Foot long  Cone like it's a cone  It was a giant amount of popcorn yeah  I'm still it's it's  I shared it with you guys and with people  Afterwards and I still have  A bunch left with the massage therapist  With the massage therapist  We should have gone into popcorn apples first and you could have  Eaten it while you were getting the massage  I feel like that would have been  Too distracting or we could have had someone feed it to you  Through the hole well now that sounds  Gourmet that someone had  Zenzone would have done it without being asked  I'm sure yeah if you had  Popcorn on the counter yeah they would have gone over  All of a sudden you would have felt like it being shoved  Into your mouth popcorn apples lean  Sweet yeah I would  Say so yeah they have a lot of sweet  Flavors that the sprinkles  Yeah so there's not as zebra  Oh yeah yeah yeah  I think my mom's a fan of zebra  All gluten free I found out  All varieties gluten free  Some of them kosher  A handful of them are certified kosher  And they have other things there too they have  A whole display case of candied  Apples that are like Disneyland style  Insane decorated with candy  Or confect sprinkles and stuff  You got something there you said  Yeah so I said I should  You know I should experience something different than the popcorn  And I got a  Frozen banana covered in chocolate  And sprinkles and  I forgot how big a banana can  Be because on the picture I  Thought oh a banana you know  Five inches skinny  Banana I thought  Okay this will be a nice quick little treat  It was not a tiny skinny  Banana I will show a photo of what it  Looks like and I'm in the picture  For a size comparison  Big hard raging  Banana much bigger than that buzzy  Dildo that was used on mine  And the sector keeper's neck earlier  Here's how big it was  You're making  A face  I was like oh no  Why did I do this? The sector keeper directed  Michael to smile  Because he seemed  He must be posted  Here's a picture now I'm happy  I can't zoom in but  Now I'm happy  It was very good  I mean I was not but I was just like oh no  All the calories and it was a thick  Chocolate shell  With sprinkles and it was good  Yeah it was very good  We don't do a ton  Of talking about restaurants  On the podcast but with city walk  We'll be going to a lot of restaurants  I feel like it would be helpful if we had some kind of  Like rating system to  Rank the food right  If it was rated on a scale of  1 to 4  Some sort of utensil or something  Would be good  What if we rated it on the scale of  1 to 4  Forchettas  The Italian word for fork  Oh that's nice I love Italian  First of all it's just one of the romantic languages  So I just think that and we're very like  A romantic podcast so that makes a lot of sense  I think this makes it an extremely  Original idea I think you're right  I mean I initially saw  A lawyer some sort of podcast  Lawyer coming through  Like standing at the patio door  Here and then when he heard it was  The word in Italian he like  You know tore something up and stopped  His feet in anger  I can't get him now I was checking the  Italian translation so I missed  All of that I'm so glad that this  Is in the clear I'm not sure what he would have been  Mad about but this is  This is a pretty original measure he's probably  From hell  He's trying to get me to come oh geez  Okay well we gotta keep him off your back and  Keep moving so if you guys had to wait  What are the uno  Uno due tre  Quattro do they go up to  Do we go up to five  No five would be insane cinque  No cinque how would you  Rank your banana  Can you give me the numbers again? Uno due tre  Quattro I mean as far as  What you're looking for I'll go  Quattro cause I mean look a nice frozen banana  Banana was a good quality  Is giant you get a lot for your money it's six bucks  A little expensive but it's a giant thick  Hard banana and it was  Good it's thick chocolate and the sprinkles it very  Much the shell very much  Reminded me of my favorite  Dipped cones at Disneyland so you're getting  That that's a solid treat  I've always liked it so yeah  I'll go four I'd go quattro  As well yeah  The cone of popcorn was seven  And I honestly really didn't  Want that much but  You know I respect  That you I think you are certainly getting  A shareable quantity  Worth and you're getting a lot  Worth and I respect the business  Angle I know the margins are very good  On like stuff like that popcorn that you  Can make on bulk and sell for a lot  More than it sure actually costs  And again very friendly  Good service sure everywhere we went  To up there and you guys want to put  Either the banana or the popcorn into  The club the Targa  Dioro which  Translates to Golden Plate Club  But whether we won't refer to it as that  Is coming back oh sure okay  No club it's not in the club there is no club  And I guess we should  Keep moving to the final  Store in the sector yes  Boys boys keep moving please  You'll take a right out of popcorn  Opolis and you arrive  You'll arrive not in  Heaven but in a place  Called  Angel  But not spelled with all of the  Letters A N G L  This is a shop that  Their website describes as California's  Hottest club dresses and  Trendy women's clothes  And that  Seem with what we know about women's clothing  Does it would you think it was  Trendy next to nothing  Yeah I mean I would say  So I really only peeked in it  A little and I looked at their website  But from what I know  Of the price points of  Casual women's clothes  Or evening wear that sort of thing it seems  Reasonably affordable  Price on a leather  Dress a leather  Dress oh I see  Where you're going with that  You're getting my ass  I see what you're doing there  You wouldn't know that  You're a leather daddy yeah yeah  I went in with a frozen  Banana I was eating it in  Angel today and I felt uncomfortable because Angel  A lot of honestly  A lot of clothes I have a lot of opinions on clothes  I thought a lot of the clothes looked nice I liked  A lot of the designs  But it's so close in there all the things  Like fossils very spread out because it's watches  It doesn't take up much space  Angel was very claustrophobic  I felt as a store they crammed  A lot of stuff in so I'll be honest  We didn't get the full experience because I felt uncomfortable  Wielding chocolate covered banana  In there that I would just like let  Some sprinkles fly and they would hit some women's clothing  Next to like summery crop tops and maxi  Dresses and that's what I said yes I didn't want to  Ruin the maxi dresses but it seemed very  Eclectic  Lots of options right I mean  Maybe they could  Have more of a specific style  If I was critiquing Angel  Sure sure  If you call something California it can be  Anything  California is a catch all  Avocado could be swiss cheese  You know is the California on a menu  It's a loose genre isn't it  Well this is I'm kind of disappointed  That Angel  Is the use of that location now  Because when City Walk opened  This was one of the  Landmarks City Walk stores  It was called the Nature Company  And the Nature Company  Or from their own website  At the time the Nature Company store  Features a rainforest exhibit with a replica  Of a banyan tree  Wow and if you were anybody  We've talked about that Warner Brothers studio store a little bit  Where you'd walk into a little spaceship  Or some or a little movie studio or whatever  It was if you're a kid who's  Bored in a mall if they're like a thing you can  Go into like that little  Imaginarium door  That stuff's always great and this thing  Yeah you've got to walk through a little  Rainforest which is very  Cool and very well done and the big thing  That I remember about this  I've been withholding this fact from you guys  In my recollection  This was the second location  On the Universal Studios property with  The E.
T.
 Ride smell  Really? Oh sure  It had that same like that magical  Fake pine  Combining with that heavily  Chlorinated water  Yeah that  That magical effect  That was only on the E.
T.
 Ride was also  In this other place so I was really happy  There was another little zone where you got a  Quick little hit of that  And you always recognized that like from  The first time you went in did you oh it's the E.
T.
 smell  Like did you immediately it's so  No one told you oh that's the same smell  It wasn't like a  It wasn't a thing it was there was no  You know Twitter accounts  Devoted to the E.
T.
 smell or a message  Report talking about it right I remember like  When I started when I first started talking to people  Who were also grew up around here and were fond  Of Universal that E.
T.
 smell would come  Up so frequently and  I don't think I was the only one  Let me ask this question because you worked at the park  Did you ever see  The canisters of smells?  No no  As I'll get into  At some point I did get to see you know  Rotting botanica so I mentioned that  On the first episode  I'll bring that up again later but the  But I and one time after  The Back to the Future I closed I got to see a big  Like a stack of lots of  The DeLorean  Cars like they were they were all  Piled up in a junkyard way which  Was kind of depressing to see  And I went up there I snuck up there  To see if there was any like little piece I could break  Off like a license plate or a  Flux capacitor or something  But it wasn't really it was all like the  Big blunt pieces of it  So no no smell canister I never got  Any insight as to where the smell  Came from but I did get to experience  That King Kong banana breath on the daily  Of course well another one of the great  Universal smells that would have been a  Crazy score though if you could have like  Stolen a canister of theme park smell  And then like  Just like when you were feeling the mood  You go over and you like open the valve a  Little bit and take a big whiff  Now that's aromatherapy  I should use that at Zenzone  Oh boy what a good plus it up  Sector keeper  It really is yeah if they want to cater  To the locals and the people with  With universal nostalgia  So like Dennis Hopper's character  In blue velvet but instead of laughing  Gas you're taking a smell  Of that like  Kind of mildewy water  In plastic  Or a bromide smell  Of theme parks  Now I feel like I'm in the  Forest outside of  The Tongo  The inexplicable pine forest  I'm in Maggie Simpson's mouth  Baby powder  Smelling Shrek's farts  Those sort of like  Nature stores or  Discovery channel stores  Which eventually bought the nature  Company  That you know they all sold  A lot of educational toys  And rain sticks and that sort of thing  I was always interested in that because even as a kid  I was like how does this place make money  Like they were  Always at the most expensive malls  And you can play with everything  You could buy it was out of  Box already yeah and  It's you know it's parents walking around  With their kids going like is this the souvenir  You want for the trip is this your one souvenir  And all the kids  You just go like nah I think  I'm done I think I'm good  By the time you've already  Played with it and had time to  Decide you don't want it you probably  Dig your hand into that pile of gems  Oh my god this is great I'll stick my  Hand in this all the time to relax  Me five seconds past  You know what never mind I will leave with no gems  Yeah they didn't  Didn't stick the line I guess there's nowhere to buy  Gems anymore I don't know where you go  In Los Angeles in general if you want a rain stick  Yeah that's a good question  If you guys know of a good  Other listeners if you know a good rain stick place  Let us know  Where would you go?  I thought you were gonna have  I didn't have anything  What is Los Angeles?  Oh boy that's  Too much you're within  You're up on high on the hill  Universal city  That's how little Los Angeles  Affected you  Why would you need to know about Los Angeles?  Why do any of us if we could only be in  CityWalk?  We would maybe like to just trade places  With you I guess?  I could arrange that  So if my spirit was freed yours would be  Incarcerated  Maybe would we be willing to trade?  But would we get to be in CityWalk?  You're not in city well you can go visit  As you did because you went to the Zen Zone  Yes yes no I can stay within the bounds of it  Oh okay  You're kind of in this limbo between death and life  And you have to stay within CityWalk  And only eat CityWalk food  Yes correct  That's already where we're kind of heading  That's essentially the jail we've put ourselves in  For the next 19 days and our listeners  And in fact we're heading there  Right from this recording  Not to tip  We are going to be at CityWalk a lot  In the next 19 days  Yeah we are  We sure are  Part of it is I think maybe we'll be frustrated  But part of me thinks maybe by day 19  We're fucking energetic  And we're like riding like a cocaine high  Of CityWalk like we may not like  Limb to the finish we may dead sprint  To the finish of the series  We may evolve to another plane of existence  Yeah well I'll say this  I'm afraid of where  This is going and where my  Stamina will be by the end of it  However at the moment  I feel very optimistic  And I want to just like  Commemorate that optimism with a little  Audio presentation  For this the first part of the 19  Part series  Mike if I could ask you to hold this up  Hold my phone up to the microphone  And press play  And I will begin this little opening day  Audio presentation  CityWalk this way  CityWalk this way  CityWalk this way  CityWalk this way  Just give me some PINGS!
