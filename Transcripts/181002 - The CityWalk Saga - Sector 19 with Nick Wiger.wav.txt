  Dog!  When your town has let you down  When your porch has fallen short  When you're too worn out to run  And need some ribs or a Cinnabon  You need a place, a place for rock  A place for roll, a place where Oakland Raiders merch is sold  A sublime hot topic and billabong  A place where you can purchase a candy thong  So let's go take a walk  Let's all go to City Walk  Tonight, tonight  The Saga Finale  We're there!  We're gonna get through all 19 sectors  Now available on our T-Public store  A t-shirt, I survived the City Walk Saga  Go to our T-Public  The award you have is to buy a shirt from us  Is to buy a shirt on sale, like all T-Public shirts  New design launched, on sale for a few days  Also, I believe, classic I survived podcast array too  Oh yes, that also, a new shirt  On the show in general, hey we have a T-Public store  That's the big overall news  And some of you have already bought shirts  And we've seen them and we're so happy you're getting them  But a new line, the survived line  But I want to institute a strict moral code here  An honor system, you may only buy the shirt  You may only get the reward of giving us money  If you actually did listen to all 19  Imagine the shame somebody would have to feel if they wore that shirt as a lie  Yeah, this is like if you were to go to Disney and the gift shop  You were not allowed in it unless you truly went on the ride  Which I honestly kind of think it should be enforced that way  Well there is merchandise that only annual pass holders can buy  So think about it like that  A little bit, I'm just saying you gotta go with the experience though  You can't get any, you know  We would like if people would tweet at us  Screenshots that show listened to and the dates  That would be good  Show the timecode and that you made it all the way through  And then you may purchase merchandise from us  And also tweet at us pictures of you enjoying anything you've gotten from us  Again you can click the link in the description of this episode to go to the T-Public store  Okay good, that question  Yes, it's in the metadata  The description, depending on your podcatcher  There's a link in there, you can click that  And we appreciate it  And then we have a little tantalizing tease without saying too much  I think here's the big way that the City Walk Saga has affected us, the podcast, the Ride Boys  Is that we now have a taste for doing far more content than should be legal in this country  We are, we're just thirsting to ramble about more topics deeper than Theme Park World  And that is why we are proud to announce here today in the grand finale that at the end of this month  We will be cutting the ribbon on Podcast the Ride, the Second Gate  Ground is being broken as we speak  This right now is the groundbreaking ceremony  Yes  It's a whole new world of bullshit to explore  So we're talking about Patreon exclusive content  That's correct  Just in case people don't know what Second Gate means  Because there's probably people that may not know  They're not insiders like we are with the Theme Park terminology  It's an industry term, that's what happens when a park opens  A second park next year  Yeah, so they call it a second gate  And the gate is where you.
.
.
  This is, it's like California Adventure to Disneyland, but we got to it way quicker  And it is going to be way better out of the gate  This isn't like cheapo original California Adventure  This is a top tier e-ticket experience  And all you need to do is purchase a Patreon park hopper pass  And then you may enter a fantastic world  With hundreds of new digital acres of discussion  Of rides and hotels and treats and all of the things  A lot of the things we've been talking about, specific characters  There are robots that literally have no backstory that we would like to talk about for an hour and a half  We have a lot of fun stuff to talk about  There are alien robots that we're obsessed with and we'd like to talk about  That's all we'll say  There's a lot of fun coming, we won't explain everything yet  But this is the groundbreaking ceremony  We're all inserting pantomime shovels into your floor, Mike  And will be a fun way to kick off our one year anniversary too  Yeah, we're heading to the one year anniversary  There's a lot of stuff going on  But let's get to the thing that is happening right now  Our guest is here  You know him as the guy who all podcasters rip off their business model from  Ladies and gentlemen from Doughboys  Returning to the show, Nick Weiger is here  Hey man  Guys, thrilled to be back  I'm so excited about Podcast The Ride getting its own Surfers Cove  Which as we know is the water park that's next to Legoland  Of course, all the surfers  Yeah, so I mean, I think we're all waiting for it to happen  It finally is here  I was actually honestly I'm like a little deflated  Because I was going to come on here and I was going to castigate you guys  For releasing 19 bonus episodes for free  And not figuring out that this was something that you could monetize  Especially with the enthusiast fan base that you have  But I'm glad that you're doing this because this is like  In addition to because you guys put a lot of work into the show  It's a very good show, it's a very entertaining podcast  One of my favorite podcasts  Thank you  And you know, but you haven't really  Have you made any money off of this?  You've been losing money on this, right?  Yeah, absolutely  You've been losing money  Yeah, yeah  Yeah, we made a little from the t-shirts  The first round of t-shirts  Don't tell them that  We made nothing  We need your help  The economics of podcasting are tricky  Because even the ads that you run are like  You know, you're sharing that with a network  And there isn't necessarily great money for those  So like, you know, some sort of paywalled content is the  Is really the only way some people can make money off of it  And I'm glad you guys are doing it because you should do it  Because it's a good show  And I'm sure you have listeners who will be excited to support you  So I'm very excited for this, this is great  Thanks so much  I really appreciate that  I'm having on day one  Oh, boy  Oh, geez  Well, we had also talked about and thought about  Do we put some of this behind a paywall?  And do we put this episode behind the paywall?  Just one episode  It would have been really cruel  Right  But yeah, we I don't know  We wanted to be nice and generous  Before we get real rigid  And put up big old barbed wire fences  Like the ones you don't even see on the outside of Disneyland  But you're there  If they're there, if you try to jump a wall  There's hardcore security  We're going from like humble artists  Just happy to do something for free  To like we're about to merchandise the hell out of this  I want, if we could  And somebody tell me if this is possible  If we could have a Jason Plush doll  Oh, my God  Within a year  So if somebody knows of a way to do this  Where we're not going to lose a million dollars  And the scale on this would be one to one  All right  It's going to be one of those episodes  Wow, this is just going to be like the other 18 sectors  I think now that you say one to one  It's just it's called a real doll, I believe  So that's possible  That's a high that's a high priced item  You can feed hot dog dinners  With an opening in the mouth  Nick, you have a relationship with the real doll manufacturers  Wait a minute  You have a full dining room tables worth  You dine with every evening  Yeah, I dress them up  We have dinner parties  It's a blast  We'll have Jason to your collection soon  In a Dunce's cap in the corner  Hey  What?  That edition is hurtful  The Dunce cap  The Dunce cap is where it went too far  We've all got to have a code  We've all got to have a line  Back off, Carlson  I said there was going to be an expensive doll  People would have sex with  That was you  Four speed hot dogs too  But the Dunce cap  Well, that's because Jason is  I think his spirit is from a time when Dunce caps actually were applied  He remembered how hurtful those were in the 40s  No greater shame  Yeah, we've lost track of  Sure  You know what?  I'm so sorry for the Dunce cap remark  Okay, thank you very much  That said, podcasts are right  Dunce caps will be available on T public  Oh, yeah, yeah  We'll get sell them all day long  That's fine  Okay, so Nick, thanks for being here  I feel like for  I imagine over the many years of Doughboys now  You have like  There's a high concentration of chain restaurants up at CityWogs  You must have been up there many a time for the show  We've probably overlapped and covered a lot of stuff that you've covered  For the show  Specific CityWalk visits we've made for I think four chains  Margaritaville  Johnny Rockets  Tony Romas  It's the only Tony Romas I think left in SoCal  And the other one we did up there is  Bubba Gum Shrimp Company, yes, yeah  And you know, it is  Yeah, not just for chains  But specifically those chains that tend to be concentrated in touristy areas  Places like Bubba Gump and Margaritaville  Like that CityWalk is the place to find them in LA  Either there or Hollywood Boulevard  The Hollywood Boulevard area is so horrible  I mean, like the city  Like if you guys are doing like 19 Hollywood Boulevard episodes  We'd want to kill yourselves  It's such a dingy unfun area  Versus CityWalk is at least something approximating a fun spot  Yeah, and it's possible to have fun there  We had fun there because  We should say before we  Explain every step of this thing that we all  The four of us  Literally did walk through every parking garage  We didn't like go stand in every space or anything  We might have skipped levels  But we did want to get a general gist of what all these places are  And that was fun  I thought we were all pretty exhausted by the end of it  Yeah, I had my full backpack which I have with me today  Because I was carrying around with all my work stuff  That was an added layer of challenge for me  But I did find it  I did have a blast  It was a real hoot  And that wasn't the only thing we did we should say  That we did other things on the  That we did other things on this trip that made it more conventionally fun  But even walking through the parking garages was fun  I like that  Yeah, and you get some odd  Some genuinely cool views of stuff  Right  There's a lot of weird talking points  But I might say that walking through the parking garages is more enjoyable than having to park in the parking garages  100%  Which not all of us did  Which all of us actively avoid to do  Yes  In all of our visits up there  Oh, wait a minute  But wait, are we talking about the parking garages today?  I don't think we know  We haven't gotten the official actual assignment  But how are we going to be sure?  Boys, boys  He's here  He's in the room  Yes, yes, I'm here and I have more strength than ever, boys  The Sector Keeper  You look great  It's like one of those milk commercials where you start small and have grown and grown  Exactly  And you're a big strapping lad now  Oh, thank you, thank you, yes  I'm so excited for Sector 19, boys  You've alluded to it  Sector 19 is parking garages  Yeah  We have it officially  Thank you  Charles Atlas, hero of the beach  Yes  Around everyone  He started small and he became the hero of the beach  I couldn't have put it better  Charles Atlas  Charles Atlas  We're all making Charles Atlas  We're all making the 60s comic book hero Charles Atlas  That guy that you worshiped when you were a young man  Yeah, I would nail away  So bullies would stop kicking sand at me  Sheridan, put down that periodical with a picture of Charles Atlas on the cover  Go sit on the corner with a dunce cap on your head  No  We did put him in a penalty box  Yeah, he did get a dunce cap  He's asking for it  Sector Giver, we're in Sector 19  Were you ever worried that we weren't going to make it?  Were you fearful during this journey?  There were times where I wasn't sure  It seems like you were getting distracted by treats at times  Oh, no, that was all pertinent and tight conversation  Yes, of course  And at other times I thought maybe I enjoyed purgatory  I wasn't sure what heaven would be like  There was a time where I met a little boy named Colton Burpo  Wow  He went to heaven once  Yeah  And he made a movie about it  Heaven is real  Heaven is real, boy  And I wasn't sure and it scared me  But now I'm getting excited  I'm getting excited because Sector 19 is the final sector  It'll be the final Sector Stone and my soul will be complete  And ideally, well, I don't know what's on the other side  But hopefully it's good  Yeah, hopefully  We're minutes away  We're only, I can assume, two and a half hours away  Based on how we do these things  But with every minute that we get through this thing  Maybe you probably don't even want to rush things along with your coughs  You're probably a little scared of what's coming at the end of the episode  I've never really mentioned this  But for every Earth minute you spend in the show  It is a hundred years for me  Wow  Oh no  You're trapped in a weird time paradox  Yeah, it's difficult  But I do understand that this sector is very tenuous and very detailed  There's lots to talk about  And it's a sequel to one, I don't know if you've talked to any other  Like anyone who keeps sectors over at Downtown Disney  If you've heard about when we did this before  But we did an episode about the Mickey and Friends parking garage  That was excruciatingly detailed  And I can't imagine being any vaguer than that time  Right  No, yes, just keep in mind a hundred years for every minute, that's all  So every minute that I'm just going on and on and on  And not getting to the point  Those minutes, you're in hell for hundreds of years  Like this one right now, this is an eternity for you  Yeah  You wouldn't believe what I've seen in the past 30 seconds  Oh my gosh  Sectorkeeper, during this time, are you like  Does it like, you feel like a hundred years worth of  I haven't eaten a meal, I haven't had a drink of water  I haven't had an hour of sleep, I haven't used the restroom  All of those, all of those  God, that sounds miserable  Everything heals slower too  Right  So if I were to pull my hamstring, it would take a hundred years to heal  And you're working your job, checking people into purgatory during this time too?  I'm still working on missions at purgatory  Oh God, well I want to say that as soon as you're free  I have a gift and I will tell you what it is  It's a DVD of the movie Gladiator  And it's just because he hasn't been  He's not supposed to pop culture before his time  After his time, excuse me  Gladiator?  Gladiator, yes, so there's a DVD of that I have for you  And that's just something to look forward to at the end, is what I'm saying  So this might feel like forever, but  Considered one of the best films of the period that you've missed from 95  Starring Nitro?  No, not starring an American Gladiator  A man named Russell Crowe, he was mostly working in Australia when you would have been alive  And then he became a big star in America  Some people think this is a bit of an art house movie, but I think it's a real crowd pleaser  Thank you, thank you  You know, I actually, Sector Keeper, and I didn't tell you guys this  But I actually have a gift for you as well  It's a CD of the debut album of Russell Crowe's band 30 Odd Foot of Grunt  So if you just want to catch up on the best music of the era  That you're not familiar with, you have that as well  Boys, you bring me strength, you really bring me strength  Thank you, thank you  You're welcome, yeah  Well, we gotta get you listening to this album and watching this film and watching all the Crowe fest  So let's get down to it, we're talking about the parking garages today  I feel like a subtext of our Mickey and Friends parking garage episode  Is that the Disney garage is so efficient and relatively pleasant for being as sprawling and teeming as it is  And it's just stressful to park there, especially with a family, no matter what  But they keep it pretty pleasant as opposed to Universal  Yes  Which is a big fucking mess  100%  It's just chaos when you go to Universal, you don't know where you're going to be parking  It feels frantic from the moment you get off the freeway  And you're approaching those parking structures, there's cones just arbitrarily blocking your way in different directions  You don't know where you're supposed to go  I feel like until the moment I'm turning into the garage, I don't know  I feel like I'm turning down the wrong way down a one-way street  It's so stressful  And then you're assigned to one of five different structures  Although in my experience I've only ever been pushed into one of three structures  The other ones are kind of enigmas to me  But the structures are.
.
.
wait, no, it's six, right?  It's actually six, as we discovered  There are four structures  And then two surface lots  Oh, okay, alright, but they are still separate parking.
.
.
what's the word to use?  Zones  Parking sectors, thank you  We have six mini-sectors within sector 19  So we'll label these 19A, 19B, 19C  Thank you  And then the spaces are.
.
.
it's like they're smaller spaces  They're not easy to park in  It always feels like when I'm parking at Universal, it feels like I'm parking at a mall during Christmas  It's so busy and everyone's so crazy  And you just are turning and you feel like you're going to plow right into a stroller that just appeared out of nowhere  And it's gotten to the point that when I go to Universal now, I take the train or I take a lift  I try to avoid driving to it because it's such a pain in the ass  And hey, that also lets me get a little more crunk, you know what I'm saying?  Oh yeah, you know what I'm saying  Yeah, in fact, this time, we've parked up there a lot recently because we've been up there so much  This time, I think the only one of us that actually parked up there was you, Mike  You're correct  Because you were running a little late  I was running a little late and I wanted to try something out  Okay  Yeah, I don't know if it's the time to reveal or.
.
.
  Should we maybe talk about more regular parking experience?  Yes, I agree, I agree  Before we.
.
.
 which I guess we'll just talk in order  Well, how about this? The broader parking situation  I am looking at a chart that explains how the parking works  Okay  And it is divided into several categories  It shows you the general parking, preferred parking, front gate parking, valet parking  And $5 movie parking  And then it shows you what those cost before 6pm and after 6pm  And there's various little notes within all that of how those prices differ from Sunday to Thursday  And if you're in the City Loft Club valet parking zone  Or if you have validation from a full service restaurant  Or if you've valeted for under two hours or over two hours  And here's what I have to say  This is way too much  And Universal Studios, I think particularly, caters to tourists from out of town  Yes  Who do not speak the language of English  And imagine if you just know the most basic English words  And then you are confronted with a super complicated parking diagram  Right  With vastly different quantities and prices  Like, truly, like day-changingly, you're already spending a lot of money at a theme park  And then if you go one minute over one thing, that can be $30 more, it's true madness  How could this chart be this complicated?  Yeah, it's too much  And also too, and I don't know if you were touching on that in the validation  Did you mention the movie theater?  No, we haven't  Well, that's a whole thing  A little bit in the episode  Or did we? I don't know  But that is, they do, the movie theater will validate  But the way the movie theater validates is you give them your parking receipt  And they give you cash  Well, that is how they have been doing it up till the last month  Wow, they've changed that policy?  Yes, and that might play into what I'm talking about with the hack  Oh my goodness  Oh, you used their own flaws against them  I feel like, now I've teased it too much, I guess I gotta say  Yeah, you gotta do it  With all of this, let me say a couple prices  Sure, go for it  If you're just going to, if you're going to a regular day at Universal Studios, you're paying $25  Which is more than Disneyland  Yes  $5 more than Disneyland, crazy  Disneyland is 20 all day if you go to that Mickey and Friends garage, but at least it's consistent  And I'd say Disneyland is better than Universal  Of course  Well, yeah, I'm kidding  Oh, the theme park you mean?  Oh, I was just meant the parking garage  I thought you meant the garage, too  $35 is preferred parking, which takes a couple of minutes out of your wad  It's a little less of a wad to get there  Front gate, I'm not sure where that drops you off  $50, valet if you're over there for over two hours is $45  These are heavy, priced at $45 for a two-hour, minute-long meal  This is all the stuff that you're seeking to avoid  It's why I've spent a lot of time, because I'm from here  I've spent a lot of time finding the places to park down the hill, walking up the hill  Yes  Just figuring out what's the shortest lift route to where I can get off more financially, Scott Free  There's so much to avoid, and that's why, Mike, I'm curious what you figured out to avoid  Well, I'll start by saying I think this works, because you're not supposed to park in the metro lot  No  And they're monitoring that now more than they used to  How, though?  In 2003, you were set  Well, I don't know, maybe they aren't  There's more cameras, signs are scarier  You just gotta pay  Where is the metro lot?  It's right down on Lancashire  First of all, this is not the hack  I'm just giving you another idea for a hack  But I used to do that, and now I don't feel as comfortable, because they put up a lot more signage  They have more signage, but you pay $3  Oh, it's just three  So it's $3 for the day  This is a good first hack, it's not your main hack  I have not tested this out, so don't maybe do this if you're worried  But go pay, pretend you're walking over to the escalator, and then just keep going  There's no way they can start arbitrarily towing cars that they think  As long as you paid  So that is a good way to do it  Someone would have to be watching you carefully  I would say maybe if you're going with a family, and you're clearly going to the theme park  You're wearing minion gear or whatever  Then you're going to be someone that they'll target  Like, okay, I know this person is pulling a scam  But if you're just a couple of adults  Just going to like, you might be riding the metro  Leave your thing one and thing two shirts at home though  Don't telegraph that  Or change into them up at City Wall  That's fine, put them in a bag  Keep them underneath a hoodie and not underneath a Harry Potter cloak  Or if you can, take the red line  Because it leaves you at the bottom of the hill  I've done this a couple times, walked from Ventura up the hill  The sector keeper and I walked up, just parked on Ventura  I guided you  Yes, he had two sets of footprints  We talked before in a previous Sector, Sector Keeper  About how when Mike has waking nightmares  Caused by blackout curtains  That's you calling to him  You've been summoning him for years  As he has these horrifying dreams  That's right, yes, yes  Yeah, we just figured it out  We just figured it out  Why are you doing that?  That's very mean, I think  Oh, I thought you liked it, my bad  You thought he liked it?  No, I was like, my sleep would be disturbed  Oh, well, you know, it's like a sleepover  First person that falls asleep  It's like a sleepover inside me?  Yeah, it gets razzed  Sleep in it?  But it sounds like you've been giving him a taste of your hell when you do it  Yeah, well in hell no one sleeps, only sleep paralysis  Oh, my gosh  Well, that adds up  I have another question  We've started to feel your presence looking back throughout our lives  And wondered if we had encountered you in some way  Let me just ask  If you remember the day, and I bet that you do  When you perished in the Dancing Fountains  Yes  Was it because you got in an especially long Jodie Moroney's line  And the last person in the line was a short brown haired child  Wearing a Future Lakers Club t-shirt  And that was that the thing that made you go  Oh, how about I do the Dancing Fountains instead?  Oh, yes, it's all coming back to me, yes  I think I might be responsible for your death  Oh, my God  What?  It was me, and I didn't mean it, I just wanted a hot dog  You, you, you caused my death?  I mean, it could have been anyone, I didn't, it just occurred to me  Lakers Club Boy, in your friends with Sparkies?  I don't know Sparky, I really don't, I swear  He took my place  I am not in alliance with that awful man  I know I'm in alliance with Nick Mundy now  But there's other people, otherwise I'm not to blame for anything  Bad man, bad man  Bad man, Mundy, bad man  I don't think I'm a bad man  This episode has not been released yet, I don't know what went down with Mundy  I'm very excited to learn  He tried to rearrange the order of the sectors  We all learned a lesson about friendship from it anyway  I just, if I was in any way responsible  But you would have, look, visiting the Dancing Fountain should have been a fun thing for you  No, it was fun, and I can't hold you responsible, I hold Sparky responsible  He took my place in heaven  He's the one, he's the bad man, he's the bad boy  You're not bad boys, you're good boys  Thank you  We are good boys  I think you're really backtracking here, it sounded like he was directly responsible for your death  And now you're just like, I think you're saying this to make a film out of it  Mike, tell us about that part  We gotta get to the hack, we gotta get to the hack, Liger  Who cares about the person responsible for it  I took in mind one minute, a hundred years  Yeah, that's true  You can get over a lot in a hundred years  Don't dig deeper in your memory and realize that this hypothetical boy cut in front of you and pushed you out of the way  No, no  Because that didn't happen  But I do remember that my parents went to put their names in a Bubba Gump  I was lured towards the fountains  Alright, so you were also waiting for the.
.
.
 your parents.
.
.
 it's your parents' fault  They killed you, dude  Yeah, yeah, it's their fault  Also, I had a staph infection, give me some fucking antibiotics  Whoa!  Wow  Whoa, he's learning out of Kurt  He's learning, he's truly becoming a real boy  You've given me strength, also I gotta hold a new medal  In gaining my consciousness  Oh, you know about like Limp Bizkit and stuff?  Yeah, it's awesome  Oh yeah, isn't that dope?  It is cool, yeah  Do you like West Borland and stuff, his makeup?  Oh, West is cool, his eyes, his eyes are cool  Yeah, that's hell yeah they are  He's like a devil  Homework sucks  Hey, oh boy, you're in a lot of attitude as the years come back to you  So, the hack  Alright, this is very important  So first of all  I think I know what you're gonna say  Probably, because it's sort of similar to a different hack that I've mentioned on the show before  And I honestly am a little worried about saying this because we'll lose this hack, I think  If someone listens to this, somebody will figure out a workaround  Jason is literally spinning a Mickey fidget spinner  Is that what that is?  Yeah, it's been a long day  I've been doing this occasionally  And you're so stressed out about the hack disappearing  I'm so excited, it is very calming  So anyway, I'm excited to hear about the hack  That's such a modern thing, I expect you to be playing with like a cup and ball or something  Yeah, it lights up and everything  Some jacks  It lights up, not like toys from the 1930s  I'm surprised you even know how to use that technology  If you are listening and you hear a slight whirring sound  And you'd like to complain to us about it, write us on Twitter or on iTunes  Or keep it to yourself  The hack, Mike, the hack  Boys, boys, the hack  While you're talking, Jason's just gonna push a little hoop around with a stick  Like every episode  Got a maple in here?  He's one of the little rascals, let's be honest  Okay, hack time  Here we go  Again, I'm scared, I don't want to lose this hack  But I think we have to say it  So here's what you do  Now they've taken the movie theater discount  Which is knocking it down to $5  But you should just be handed out in a dirty piece of cash  Now it is.
.
.
  Which is insane, by the way  You walk up and they give you cash  They just hand you $15 in cash  Because you paid $20, $25  If you paid $25, they'll give you a $20  You just have a 22-year-old handing you a $20 bill at the end of your movie  It's like you're doing a drug deal  A lobby of the Universal Cinema  Which is crazy to think about how many 20s they have to have on hand  Because if you see, what, 500 people see a movie at a weekend  So you gotta have.
.
.
  Somebody do the math  Oh, way more, way more than that  $10,000 in 20s?  There's a fucking heist to be done  Oh, wait a minute  Maybe that's why they changed the system  Yeah, because now that I think about it  They still have this cash system in place  Because it doesn't work if you book it through a fandango  It doesn't work if you book it through several other movie sites  Oh, got it  You have to book it through the AMC website  I wonder if there was some way to find out where the vault was  If there was some sort of omniscient being that knew all of the secret places of the city  Boys  I guess we'll have to talk to you off air about this one  Or behind the paywall  Patreon episode one is how to rob CityWalk of $10,000  You pay us five, but you'll get a guaranteed $10,000 down the line  Pretty good deal  Yeah, that's really good  All right, hack time  Now it feels like we shouldn't even get to the hack, right?  No, just.
.
.
  Come on  All right, here's what you do  We're going in the parking garage  I thought of this last second  So this made me feel really great  Because I was doing this on the fly  I was like, you know what I can do?  I bought a movie ticket for an hour from now or whatever  For the house, that Jack Black movie that Eli Roth directed  The house with the clock in the walls  The house with the clock in the walls or whatever  And I was like, I know that they now have a digital way to get the rebate or whatever  So I bought the ticket  Got an email that said, here's your parking code  Have them scan it at the thing or whatever at the booth  And right before.

  Let's add this to the Mission Impossible score, by the way  Or the Ocean's Eleven movie  And right before I got to the booth  I canceled the movie ticket and got a refund  Wow  So I showed it and I was like, I wonder if this is going to work  Because if it doesn't, then I can actually just do the same thing again in a second  Or be like, oh, I just got whatever  I'll have to do the manual thing and go get cash or something  Right  I showed it to him  It was a tense 25 seconds  And now again, I'm a good boy, so I was sweating pretty hard here  Right  He scanned it, he goes, alright, here you go  And $5 was the price  Now the only extra thing I had to pay was there's a service fee that's now refundable  So it's like $1.
50  Okay  So $6.
75 or $0.
50 parking hack with my movie theater canceling trick  Wow  So you waited to cancel until like right before you were exit  Right before I exit  That being said, I think you can cancel after you've done it too probably  Yeah, that's the next try  So again, this is, don't tell, guys, if you're listening, don't tell anyone  Because I would like to use this in the future  Did you buy, sorry, for the movie  It was a movie that was going to be starting after you knew you were going to leave  Like you timed it out that way  No, I just, it was in an hour  An hour from when you parked or an hour from when you left?  It was like, like I said, we parked at 6.
30, it was 7.
30 movie  So this was a movie that you didn't, like you didn't, but wouldn't it have started?  How did you know, like when the, I guess I'm confused about when the transaction took place  I bought a ticket at 6.
30 on my phone for a 7.
30 movie  We went into the parking garage at 6.
35  You're paying as you enter the parking garage, not as you're exiting  That's the trick now that they've changed and now their system is susceptible to my trickery  Yes  What if they start now like geo-tagging it somehow  They might  They prevent you from buying one within 100  This is the danger of me saying this on this show  First of all, what they should do is like how they, when the government finds hackers  And they're like threatened to lock them up, instead of locking me up, they should hire me  Yeah  That's what they should do  To help them make the parking more expensive?  Yes, I will find ways to clamp down on the holes in their system and add more tiers of parking  If there's an extra 30 minutes, it's another $25 in valet  Let's figure out ways to get more money out of people  I'm willing to join the team  I am willing to hire me is what I'm saying  You deserve the Frank Abagnale Jr.
 treatment at the end of Catch Me If You Can  Yes  You get rewarded after your life of crime with a plumb job at the FBI  That is exactly what I'm asking for  So there's the hack  That's a great hack  That's amazing  Amazing hot off the presses news  I had a hack, past tense  But I think I spoiled the hack for everyone  And it's not a hack that anybody else would have had  But here's what happened  I largely stayed on the schedule as a universal tour guide  In order to get free parking  In order to still be able to use the employee parking  Which you park in the Frankenstein lot, by the way  And the.
.

  So I would do a shift there  Even though I had a full-time other job  I would do a shift there once a month  Partially to keep the parking situation  And to get a slight amount of money in return  But then they took me off the schedule  There were enough people they didn't need me  I was fired from that job via a letter  A form letter that went to six other people  So then I didn't have it anymore  But I still had my ID  So here's what I did  I scanned it in  I believe whenever the year needed to change  In Photoshop, I changed the expiration date  Now, I probably could have taken this a step further  And laminated my false badge  But it was always inside a plastic lanyard thing  So I just put the paper one  With another little punch card for a sandwich shop  Behind it in order to increase the thickness  And so I would go through  You can name the sandwich shop  What's that?  You can name the sandwich shop  I don't think I know the specific one  It could have been a Jersey Mike's  I don't recall  But any sandwich shop will do  I thought you were being coy with it  I apologize  No, no, no  Any sandwich shop card can help with this scam  To get free parking at Universal Studios  So I would just  Those people are not paying a lot of attention in the booth  I'd flash that thing real fast  Oh yeah, I go through  One day after successfully doing this  Six or seven times  The guy started  He half-wayed me through  And then said, wait a minute  Oh no, a nightmare  Yeah  Stop me  Heart-beating  Good boy  Trying to keep it calm  It's like I was pulled over drunk driving  Though that certainly has never happened  This is the worst driving thing that's happened to me  This was like a hundred years for you  Wait, this waiting period  Busted by security  It was a purgatory  And so the guy eyes it  Opens the zipper  Takes out the false ID with nothing on the back  And then just looks at me and goes  I'm gonna keep this  You turn around  And he watched me turn around  And go out the main gate of Universal Studios  Wow  You fucking cad  Yes, this was something  I think I'm a more good boy today than I was then  I was really pushing it  I was young  I was dumb  I wasn't afraid of risks  So, but here's what ended up happening  Was that  The  I was worried I was gonna be put on some list  And I wouldn't be able to go back up the city walk again  But instead  The badge was handed to somebody in the front office  It was thrown down on somebody's desk  And it was, and they said  Hey, put this thing on file  We gotta watch out  This guy, Scott Gardner, who used to work here  He's now, he's using a false badge to try to get free parking  So I don't know  Just like keep an eye on him  Put him on some list  Whatever you gotta do  The person whose desk that landed on was a friend of mine  Wow  Who immediately texted me and explained  What happened?  I just got a paper ID on my desk  That's so crazy  So she was able to just crumple it up  Make sure it was like nothing ever happened  Oh my gosh  So you and I both, you're screwed  Like this is very revealing in terms of  Maybe we have to  We better cover all the other Universal rides soon  Because we might end up on some  And Jack was here  He revealed a lot of the secrets  Oh yeah, Jack was real bad  Sneaking into Universal  Right  Without paying  Wait a minute  Can I reveal mine?  Yeah  Yeah, oh my god  So this one I feel like is kind of known though  And I haven't tried it in a few years  But when I interned on the back lot  You know, I had a generic Universal kind of badge  And I would want to go up there  They told us like, oh, go to the Frankenstein lot  Go park in the Frankenstein garage  And usually just flash the badge  And they wave you through  Right  I was also like later told by someone  After I had to give that badge back  Like, oh, just go park in Frankenstein  Tell them you're there for a shoot  Or like you're going to the town office  Just tell them that  They don't give shit  That's it  That was it  And you haven't tried it in a while  I haven't tried it in a while  But you did it  I think I tried it like once or twice  Seemed to work  It worked  I've heard other people say it works  But I don't know  They may have changed that now  Because Extra wasn't shooting their extra shoots up there  And now there's a lot more production going up there now  Say you're there for Street Smarts  That's the new one  Street Smarts  Yeah, I'm just going to Street Smarts  They'll let you guys do it  That's great  You just keep abreast of what the production is  That's going on in that Universal lot  That's a great idea  Look up the name of the host of Street Smarts  I don't know it offhand  But look it up  Say you're his assistant  You got to get up to the  You're late for the Street Smarts shoot  I'm here for a Snapchat thing  They're shooting it on Snapchat  Street Smarts bonus content  Verticals  I'm a slam ball player  I thought Jason's dark universal confession was going to be  That he stole a bunch of butterscotch from Popcornopolis  Like unprocessed butterscotch  Cook it at home  Put it in the microwave  Before they mix it in the corns  Just the industrial blocks of butterscotch  It makes sense because you have a fresh glass of butterscotch every morning  Buttermilk  No, buttermilk  That's not true  I took a sip of buttermilk once  And it's disgusting  It's mostly used for baking  It's very strange  I had a joke about your eating years ago  That you regularly ate curds in way  Oh, my toughness  Yeah  God bless  The next heist that we do  Once we figure out the movie theater heist  Then we figure out the butterscotch heist  That's really the key to this  Doing all 19 sectors is we know the ground so well  That's true, yeah  Maybe this is the birth of us becoming bad boys  Maybe that's the little punch list  Bad boys  Sometimes it feels good to be bad  Whoa, wait a minute  Sector keeper himself  The influence of corn  Yeah, so have you been bad in purgatory?  Because you're always a good boy  I'm a good boy, no  But maybe you guys are rubbing off on me  Oh, okay  Our coolness is making you cool and bad  Yeah, I feel like I'm running with the cool crowd  The way you describe adulthood rules  Did you know that chocolate-covered starfish is buttholes?  Hey, whoa, Jason  Whoa, hey  I'm still a kid  Okay  But you were listening to that?  Never mind  Have you gotten to that Al Olimpiscate album?  Yeah  Oh, you have?  Yeah, I started  Have you broken any stuff since then?  Yeah, all the time  Oh, damn  Oh, boy  Wow, there's going to be no purgatory by the time you're left  Yeah, well, I just feel like I'm so close  You guys are doing so well and you're giving me strength  Oh, yeah, but I guess we'll really give you all the strength  if we start talking about each individual parking garage  Yeah  Here we go  Get ready, listeners  That's what's happening  Unless there's more hacks to go through  Not right now, at least  Nope  All right, let's go in the order that we walked through them with  Yes  So we started in Curious George  Right  You know what?  I'll hold off my thought on the theming  I will say generally, because there's one thing I want to zero in on  a few garages from now  But in general, the theming is chaos  It's completely incoherent  There's nothing running through it  It's kind of like, you know, you've got the Toy Story lots over at Disneyland  and it's kind of, you know, you get that, okay, these are all Toy Story characters  They've zeroed in on something specific  Mickey and Friends, they're all Mickey characters  They're like the canonical main Mickey characters  Here it's just sort of like it's all over the place  There's stuff for kids, there's stuff for adults  There's like classic movie monsters  There's modern franchises  It's just like Universal's library of franchises  It's just all over the place  And some are characters  Some are characters  Like you see in Curious George, but some are a whole film  Some are a whole film  It's very confusing  But Curious George, you know, I will say that I like the signage  The signs look nice  And it's a five level parking structure  At least that's what my notes say  The view, so actually parking at Curious George is not pleasant  This is one of the three structures that I parked at before  You know, none of them I think are  None of them are appreciably better or worse than the others  At least that's my take  That's my layman's take  You guys are experts, you may have a better, a more nuanced view of the lots  as we can comparison to each other  But they're all like kind of like unpleasant to park in  But the, you know, I guess we're going to  What we did is we went to the top levels of each of these structures  And the top level of Curious George has pretty good views of downtown Burbank  Good views and good views of universal backstates  Yes, that is actually nice  We were looking over the big like holding area where I discovered Botanicus  Back in the day  The rotting Botanicus  And we saw some stuff back there that is maybe a spoiler  Or it was just something temporary that they are storing  It's half a dinosaur next to a bunch of port-a-bodies  Right  And we wondered out loud if that's a dinosaur being added to the Jurassic World's re-theme of the Jurassic Park ride  However, I think if that was a complex animatronic, they wouldn't just leave that sitting around  But Botanicus was just sitting around  Botanicus is out and obviously he was not being installed into the ride, but still, you know  So yeah, or it could just be like less mobile robots, you know, maybe they're adding a couple other things  Who knows? It was big though  And probably just for a photo op, but who knows  It looked like it might have, what is it?  It's the I-Rex, is that what it is?  Oh, the Indominus Rex  The newer Indominus Rex  It looked a little different than Indominus Rex though  Was it the one in the new one?  Is there another new one?  They engineer a hyper killer one  That's worse than the I-Rex?  That's worse than the I-Rex  Because the I-Rex was bad  They can aim like a sonar gun at a target and shoot it and the dinosaur can track the sonar at that target  Oh, okay.
 I don't know if that was this one  But so if you go to the top of Curious George, you maybe get some universal spoilers along with getting an actually amazing view of Burbank and Toluca Lake and a lot of the San Fernando Valley  I will say this, I took a lot of photos while we were up there  Some of the prettiest, nicest photos I've ever taken on my phone camera  It was kind of around sunset, I was getting some cool lens flares  And somebody gave us the tip, and I don't know if we take this because we're good boys, but in this episode maybe we're turning a little  Maybe we're becoming bad boys  But somebody on Twitter or somewhere told us that's a good spot to maybe roll up your car, roll down your window, get a little high  Wow  Would you guys ever?  No  Do we dare?  I think it was a listener said like get a little stone and watch the sunset from Frankenstein, I think Frankenstein gives a different angle  But the top of Frankenstein is the theme park  So you wouldn't be able to go to the top of it  But yeah, beautiful views of the sunset up here and the San Fernando Valley and the mountains  This is a good tip I would say, if you're coming to LA for the first time, taking out a towners, go to the top of this garage or the one next to it that we'll talk about  Great views, great photo spots  And similarly, if you want a good picture by the Hollywood sign, look up the Hollywood Reservoir and the Hollywood Dog Park  That's really where you want to go to find parking, get photos  Just a nice little tip because you don't want to go up the streets that a lot of people live on  Bother neighbors and stuff  It's also too, and I think people can perhaps infer this from our tour of these garages  But you can, unlike some theme parks, you can very easily just walk into each of these garages if you so desire  You can just go ahead and go on a walking tour through them if you want to get to the roof and check out those views  Which we did  Send us those pics if you do it, walk in our footsteps, do the legendary walk  Like Christ's walk up the hill with the cross  This is now the second best walk to do a tour of  Speaking about the parking, so the actual process of parking, I feel like the  Actually pulling up to the gates is fine  It's not like once you're in the structure, I don't feel like I'm  It's too chaotic in terms of figuring out which gate to go to to pay  But I think once I'm actually inside the lot, there's less direction than I would like  I like at a theme park when they're just waving you into a specific space and you're being guided down a different  You almost don't have to think about where you're going to park  Here I think there's a little bit too much discretion left to the driver  Which creates bottlenecks and also creates additional stress  And also I feel like too, the ceilings for these levels I think are a little low  It feels a little cramped  I also feel like I'm pulling in and there's an employee there who suddenly starts gesturing in a way of like  No, no, no, that way, that way, suddenly it's really hurried and you're doing something wrong  But why? I don't know what the problem is here  One person calls in sick, the whole thing could fall apart  Because they seem to have half the amount of people flagging and waving people in than Disney does  Because Disney literally, as you're saying, walks you through it, it makes it dummy proof  Here we went in, this is one of the many parking stories we have  A couple months ago, Lindsay and I, she has an electric vehicle  And they put a little thing on the front of your car that says EV and then they point you to where you go  At a certain point, there was no employee anywhere to tell us where to go  There were three choices, we chose one, it took us out of the parking garage and into the Curious George parking garage  Which does not have electric vehicle parking  So we were like, what the hell?  Like we were trying to figure out where we were going  We went out of the ET parking garage into Curious George  Then had to exit Curious George, exit all the way  And then go back into the ET and go like, hey we just paid, where are we going?  And they're like, oh, go and then they pointed us and we finally figured out what to do  But that shouldn't happen  You should be flagging, you should be really hardcore on every car  Because it's a big confusing place  Conversely, when we were up there walking through  The most universal employees I've ever seen because it was the second weekend of Horror Nights  So they had cones everywhere, there's people everywhere, there's tons of people  What was that for?  Horror Nights  Oh yeah, it's scary to us too  When you're a full grown bad boy, you're going to be into that  Yeah, you're going to think that's cool  Okay, I just always think, what if one guy takes it too far and really gets in your face  It feels like there's not a lot of oversight, I don't know  What if all the seasonal hires who are not usually around  Were just there for that month and they would essentially hire anyone  What if one of them brought a knife into their job for the day  Or they put the chainsaw they have that doesn't have the blade on it  What if he snuck the blade in somehow?  He swallowed the blade in a little bag  Oh, because he knows he's a sicko  Not that, because he gets to go through a metal detector  So maybe he put a lined bag with the blade inside his stomach  And then he shit it out and put the blade on to  That's true, could be a ceramic blade doesn't set off a metal detector  Could be a ceramic, you could probably 3D print a blade now  And you could take a plate from any universal restaurant, shatter it, use the piece  Shove it into the throat of some Halloween Horror Nights ghost  You're making me not want to go as I've continued to not go for many years  I said we should go this year, Jason of course said no  And I said it would be funny, but we'll talk about it  We'll talk about it, and we've got some stuff coming up for this  The most spookiest month of the year  Maybe Sector Keeper you can go when you're free and you're real  Do they let fourth graders go or is that too young?  I think you can go, right?  I think you can go, I think they advise against it  If you're with your cool uncles  Then you could go with  Yeah I should mention, you're my guardians  Oh, wait, that's the deal?  Like once you're free we take care of you?  At the moment, yeah, I mean I'll do my best, but  Oh, because he doesn't know where his dad is, or where his family is  The host of podcasts, the writer, your legal guardians?  Yes, and then when they can't do it, you can, right?  I mean yeah, I guess so  The most read, the last guest out the door in the Sallena Saga series  Would have to take care of  If that's okay  I'm okay with the wider part, certainly as for us  I mean is this some binding document that if from the afterlife  Like it's kind of above our heads so we have to do it  Or is this just like you're where you just want us to be your uncles?  Is there a difference in your hearts between the two?  Great question, legal responsibility helps make the case  Why don't we just see what happens when we get all 19 stones together?  Who knows, maybe you transform and you're the age you're supposed to be  Oh, that's interesting  You won't need a guardian  We're not, I don't know  But he'll be like big and he won't know how to live on his own  Right, right  You saw big, that was in your time  Yeah, yeah, I loved it  Well you might end up living a big life, we'll see  It also sounds like Weger will watch me, right?  I mean, if we've established like a line of succession  I think the odds are pretty low that all three of these guys are going to be  A separate malady  Yeah, they're all gonna be incapacitated and I'm gonna have to take control  So I guess I'm okay with that  Okay, cool, alright, let's keep going  Boy, be careful, yeah, I get caught on a technicality  Well, let's go to a more pleasant, less scary character than these Halloween Horror Nights murderers that we've been discussing  Let's talk about our old pal ET  Yes, so we took a land bridge from Curious George over to ET  Which was, we were very, we were actually like a little, you know, speaking to you guys being good boys  We were like a little worried because there was a universal employee at the end of this ramp that connects the two structures  And we were a little worried that this guy was going to give us some guff walking over there instead of driving on this, through this roadway  But we just went for it  Can the listeners guess who was the most worried about this?  Who was the most hesitant?  I'm trying to even remember who was it  Who do you think?  Jason?  It was me  It was you, sir  Yeah, I felt like you were very hesitant to step foot even onto the-  I was hesitant because it was a pathway but it was kind of like a blocked off path  Let's say this though, we shouldn't have been walking there  Right  Probably not  Because if a-  If it's open to pedestrians and there was a little-  There was a little walkway but the walkways had things jutting out in front of them  So there was no clear sidewalk to walk  Yes  So I think in the official universal rule book that was against the rules  And I think that that's for sure  What is the line for if not for pedestrians to walk in?  I thought it was just a shoulder  I thought it was just like a little bit of-  Fair  Semperi shoulder  A freeway doesn't have a sidewalk  Yeah  They don't want- there's no practical reason to have people walking from parking garage to parking garage I don't think  Yeah  I mean that's-  To get to their vehicle in the dense web of many confusing parking garages  If your car breaks down on the tiny bridge between ET and Curious George  Then you need a place to go out there and wait for the tow truck to come  So you go over and-  That's very true  That's just shit on the little sidewalk there  I was initially nervous and then I gambled like this guy probably doesn't give a shit  Or like-  Your gamble was correct  Yeah or this guy was distracted by the incoming-  He had a job to do  There was a lot of cars coming in  Right  And that's what he had to do because yeah Horror Nights was like an hour from starting  We survived the pedestrian- not the pedestrian we survived the auto bridge, the first obstacle of our journey  We made it  Yeah  We made it into the ET structure and went up to the top and went to the furthest space that you could possibly park from the theme park  Yes  Which the number was 7W  Yeah so this is a 7 level structure  If you're in ET 7W you are the furthest from the- which if you think about that the furthest corner of Universal Studios is probably the Transformers ride all the way  It's like miles away, it's a literal miles long walk  I- when we were up there because there was that level was huge and completely vacant  The exposed roof level and I was just thinking like man how fun would it be to ride some bikes up here?  Sure  Just like this giant open space to just ride around, that'd be a hoot  They might let you, there's bike racks in these lots now  I bet if you brought a bike there and you went to the top level and you were just riding around while it was unoccupied you could do it for a while without anyone bothering you  Yeah I would be a little stressed out doing it  Yeah definitely  I mean I'd be stressed out doing it too because I mean I would- it might be fun to try  Sure  A little stressed out doing our little- we did a little photo shoot up there, we took some pictures  That's true  You were stressed out about that?  You know what I was more stressed out, Nick and I talked about this when we were up there  This stressed me out more, they had blue light phones like every few spots  Yeah  If you have been on a college campus you might know the blue light phones of like pick this up if there's an emergency  Right  And they built those into the new garage  That stressed you out?  Yeah  So it indicated that there was not extreme security and that maybe like a Segway car, a Paul Blart might take a long time to get up to that level to help you  Well I think Jurassic Parking is so close to CityWalk, I don't think there's a lot of that there  All of it is close to CityWalk  Yeah but this is like the farthest away from like if you needed security or something  Yes  So I think it was a call box essentially  Yeah and you know maybe it's for auto trouble but I don't know and maybe it's something that was put- installed in the years before you know widespread cell phone ownership  But it did make me think like oh this is a high crime zone  Please  Well and I don't want to dwell on this but there was a murder in a CityWalk parking garage  Wow  And it's really bad, it's not a funny murder  Oh my god  It's an awful murder and it does indicate that there's enough uncovered ground up there that something bad could happen  Sure  And now one of you make a joke  Yeah  What in your mind would constitute a funny murder?  Clown dying?  Well I guess it would  Yeah sure, I don't know somebody, I guess somebody falling off the structure wouldn't be funny  No yeah  But if he you know if he landed flat and a marching band walked over him like they could gun then yeah  Oh if one person falls in an open manhole, oh no that's tragedy  Yes  As he takes a flick of his fidget spinner and looks wistfully into the distance to think about years gone by  A million people die, no yes comedy one person falls in it  I was more reacting to what you did after the thought  You know what I realized on the back of the little petals of this fidget spinner there are drawings of fidget spinners  That's cool  Yeah  That's awesome  Post pics of that for the audience  I think this is the quote, I think it's a version of this, it's comedy is one person falling into an open manhole and dying  Tragedy is when I stub my toe  It's like the idea that something that happens to me is tragic no matter how small and something is comedic if it happens to someone else even if it's like horrific  Right that's it  You know since we're talking manholes to get us to a lighter point  I'm probably jumping around I think this was in the Frankenstein lot but I'm not totally sure where but in one of the universal parking garages in the 90s  There was an event that was only open for two weekends where you could go down a manhole and who would you meet but your pals the teenage mutant  Oh my god  Yeah you love them  I would have lost my mind  They're still around they're still kicking ass there's a promo for this I'll put it on the Twitter but yeah seeing kids like sneak down they turned the top level of a parking garage  That's so cool  Into a sewer  Oh my god  Legitimately cool there were TV ads for it that were fully produced even though it was only open for two weekends apparently but a friend of mine David Love went and in addition to that you could get like crazy turtle kinds of pizza  You could get pizza with gummy worms on it and stuff like that  That's so awesome  Oh heck yeah  Yeah that's your kind of food  And I just somebody was just telling me about this because I got to do it when they were a kid and you would get a free figure  Yeah  You would get a free and it looked like it was original  This is insane  It was original line figures it was all the original like you know just the turtle splinter shredder April you would get a free one and he said like you would just go back in line and get like you could go every day  This sounds like something that your liar friend would say at school  Yes  You know except that it's true  Yeah  You know like your liar friend would always be like oh they're working on Super Mario 4 and it will be out like next month and you'll be like what are you talking about  I have a Ninja Turtle version of Liar Kid he goes I saw that I don't know what he called trailer the preview for the Ninja Turtle movie he goes there's a in the movie Leonardo takes his sword and slices Crane in half  And I was like what?  Whoa  Oh my god  It's much more grizzly than anything in a turtle movie  But I thought that that was going to be in the movie when I saw the movie  It's not true  You didn't see it? It was out  Yeah I know I think about it I saw it  That seems like you're lying now  That seems like you didn't see it  It's okay you didn't see it  It's okay to say it  Yeah I just I don't know I just wanted to fit in  Hey Sector Keeper good news there's like three or four more Ninja Turtle movies you can see and like a dozen different cartoons with different animations  There's so much content  Cool  Yeah  They should make cause like now in this era of you know they've got we're building Harry Potter land we're building Star Wars land in this era they should build a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle sewer that you could go into and hang out in and you could just sort of like  They've got a pizza joint down there they've got turtles walk around characters they've got kind of like their sort of lab laid out I mean that would be fucking amazing  Yeah dads and sons and daughters and moms would all enjoy it  Yes all the types  All the types would enjoy it  All the quadrants right cause Ninja Turtles has reached a point where people who grew up watching it now have kids yeah well they should 100% do this that actually described it sounded amazing  This is one of the great properties that is untapped in theme park world and only was for two weekends apparently and there was a live show in Disney World but that wasn't much  Yeah but they would have to settle on one style of turtle unless it's a historical thing and they try to do all the styles of turtle  Well I mean you know they've got a color scheme they've at least decided upon that  Make them the theme park exclusive turtles a different design there's already 10 different designs let's make the 11th be the theme park exclusive turtles  And give them a little dick like you're Leonardo  Yeah post a picture of that little dick  We will post a photo of Leonardo's little dick with a set of cupids right over your shoulder  Yeah I love it's cool  Yeah somebody said a turtle's sex organ is in his tail so that is Leonardo's dick  Oh the toy  We're all staring at a turtle dick  Whoa Weiger Weiger easy you're gonna okay alright you're gonna break the toy  Make us put you in the penalty box again  So yeah turtles  He climbed over me to get it  I just want a closer look  So the ET garage this is new though you mentioned like oh did they put the emergency phones out there  This was built in conjunction with like oh we need more parking for the Harry Potter  This is two or three years old  Wow this is that recent  Yeah  Okay  That's why they have the electric vehicle charging in the bay in the lowest level  And then cool tunnel the ET tunnel  The ET tunnel is fucking awesome  Yeah it's this blue lit up hallway looks like something from a music video  Right  And ET's there and the moon is there and the bikes are there  It looks great and honestly it's like one of the best photo ops I think in CityWalk  Like it's just such a cool like that's worth the trip over to that ET parking garage if you like just cool shit to look at  I am surprised though hearing that this is a recent build  Why call it ET which is not the most irrelevant of properties in this day and age  Especially if it's built for Harry Potter demand  Like why not a Harry Potter  You know I wonder because there are no Harry Potter lots  I wonder if because there's no levels either right that ever have Harry Potter  I wonder if that's in the JK Rowling agreement that like Harry isn't a fucking parking garage character  Right  He lives in Hogsmeade or whatever in Hogwarts castle  I wonder because it seems like that they have such a specific like hold on that to not use it in certain ways  Like Harry can't just be hanging  Like for instance if Harry was around when that Trump photo was taken with The Apprentice  Harry would have been barred from appearing with Trump  There's this crazy photo where Trump is like clearly in the middle of you're fired  And he's with Curious George and Frankenstein  And Shrek is there  Bizarre tableau  They're all dressed like Trump except for the mummy who doesn't have Trump pants  He has his regular mummy legs  Right  Otherwise and since they're all suited characters they're all looking in different directions  So Shrek doesn't know where the camera is nor does Frankenstein  It's great  And if that had been the furthest Trump had ascended in power  I would love Trump  He's friends with Shrek  Of course  A friend of Shrek is a friend of mine  Do we have more about ET or do we keep marching?  ET is the best parking garage  Yes that is  High ceilings even though we got lost in it  They just really the problem with it is the cleanest they need more employees directing  But like when you go down to electric vehicle charging it's very spacious  I mean the ceiling is high it's fairly nice  You go right to the escalator there's a little bridge and then you're over there  If all the parking garages were like that I think you've got it's a whole different ballgame  Absolutely  Half the size of Mickey and Friends for those keeping track of fans  Interesting  Wow  That's a pretty mighty parking garage and still only half the size pretty crazy  Let's keep marching to Jurassic Parking  Which we tried to walk into and we got up to the end of some stairs that led nowhere  Even though there was a big sign that said Jurassic Parking  I think everyone likes that it is Jurassic Parking  That's fun and you see people Instagram that or tweet that  I just wanted to mention real quick because you were talking about walking up those stairs  One of the things we walked by climbing those stairs were some bad kids sitting on the stairs vaping  And that's just like an element that you have to compete with at CityWalk  Because there's some roughnecks about it  And I kind of like  It is the kind of thing where I'm so much more of a Disney guy that that element of CityWalk  When I'm around like oh I might just stumble upon some deviant youth  I'm just like I'd rather not deal with that  I'd rather be around some wholesome families having a good time  Yeah say that for the walk over like I did  When you're down at the metro stop  But yeah Jurassic, the pun  Okay I like the pun in isolation  But in the context of the other lots it doesn't work  Because one is called Jurassic Parking  And then the other just named like the name of the property or the name of the character  Frankenstein Parking  Exactly you have to make some sort of effort at puns for the rest of them  Or you don't do the Jurassic Park one  Because that's also too that's the one that's not a character  Like a lot of them yes, Curious George and E.
T.
 are the names of the franchises  But they're also the name of the characters  Jurassic Park is not a character  It is a I mean in a sense Jurassic Park the setting is a character in the film of course  In the same way that New York is a character in Woody Allen's Any Hall  Oh fuck I never thought of it like that  But it's like it's so  But it should be like the Ian Malcolm lot or something like that right  It should be like a character from Jurassic Park  If it was the Velociraptor lot  If it was that sexy Ian Malcolm that everybody likes online  And that with that artwork  That would be great  I mean that's a little too body for me  It's also bleeding  Everyone forgets sexy Ian Malcolm is bleeding  Make it as you're saying E.
T.
 is a little old  Like make it the new character you know the main character of Jurassic World  That character that we all can name right now  Oh you Chris Pratt's character  No but his name we know his name  One two three four Owen Grady  Of course right  Owen Grady everyone said it  I definitely didn't say Jonathan Borg I said Owen Grady  I think is Grady's last name?  Yes  Yes it is  There will be no further discussion at this point because it is  I agree  Jurassic Parking is really where it gets chaotic  That's where chaos theory unfolds  That lot sucks  Yes I think that's I think I would call that the worst  It's the most claustrophobic and it's the one where  If you park in there you don't know where you're going to come out  You don't know if it will be in the food court  You don't know if it will be above the Bubba Gump  I think there's still another one like under the Skechers  It has many exits and you don't know which one it's going to be  If you're trying to meet friends you don't know how to meet them and where  A lot of times you have to immediately like walk to the edge of it  And then go down to get to what feels like Gramp  But like it can trick you into thinking like wait no I thought I was on Gramp  But it's like no you might have to go down one or two escalators  It has a light tunnel too similar to ET  I think it's just not as good  No it's not  It also has an area that has caused us a lot of turmoil  And that is the valet lot  And we have several instances of parking in the valet lot to talk about  I think Peter complained about this a little bit when he was on  But we've had some incidents as well  Would you like to talk about I believe you have one but there's also another story  I have a valet  I tried valeting in both of the Frankenstein and Jurassic Park  Mr.
 $90 huh?  Well there were seven they were $7 because I had meals  Set a timer and sprint to your destination  Yeah man that's stressful  I did the Jurassic Park honestly the Jurassic Parking valet even though it's not as nice aesthetically because it's older  That went or no excuse me I reversed that  That one actually is nicer than Frankenstein  Frankenstein valet  Well do we save it for Frankenstein?  Yeah that's what maybe  Because the other story we have is about Jurassic  So should I is that what you're getting at?  Alright so here's what's happening earlier in the series in a previous sector  We pre-recorded some thoughts about a valet incident with our guest Jason Walliner  And now we turn to a pre-tape  Hey future us it's we're back here in sector three having just recorded with Jason Walliner  Yeah what are your lives like now I want to know  How is it going up there in three weeks from now?  Yeah you got to be having a blast especially wandering around the parking garage  Anyway so we're here to talk about our experience with Jason while you're here  Because you utilize the valet parking at City Walk and had a particularly odd experience  Yeah I found out because I was going there to meet a friend a couple months ago at Margaritaville  And they said if you valet you can get it validated at Margaritaville or Bubba Gump  Or any of the sit down restaurants not the fast food places  But any of the sit down restaurants validate and instead of 25 bucks it's like 7 dollars  So I valeted and then we went and checked out sector three  And then you guys kind of walked me around and talked about the other sectors  And then you guys had wisely parked outside of the camp property  I was dropped off by my wife you guys walked from very far away in the neighborhood  So I was going to give you guys a ride back to your car  So I got it validated at Bubba Gump having not eaten there  Which is kind of a hack that I came up with  I walked into the gift shop and I was like hey could you validate this  And she did  So I didn't say that I had eaten there  Do I come off bad in this anecdote?  No I mean we're good boys as you know on this podcast  So we're a little uncomfortable by it but we've straight here and there  We've done some things similar to this  Jack Allison ripped off City Walk more than any other guest  So you're not as high on the spectrum as Jack on the ripoff spectrum  How did he do it?  Well the audience has heard this now back in whatever sector he was in  But he snuck into Universal he put highlighter on the back of his hand and said it was a stamp  Oh that's much more than just elevation here  But you were punished then  That actually, slightly less future us knows that  Past us maybe shouldn't know that  Oh boy we're hitting some paradoxes  So then we went to the valet and to pay the $7 I was planning to pay  And then the guy was like $45  I was like what? No I got the, do you not see the Bubba Gump stamp on my ticket?  And he points to the sign which says, I can send this to you guys if you want to put it on the Facebook group  Should we blur the guy's face?  So the unvalidated it's $25 for 2 hours, 45 after 2 hours  Validated it's $7 for 2.
5 hours, 15 for up to 3.
5 hours and then 45 after that  And we were like just over 3.
5 hours or I was because I got there a little earlier  So the tiers of this to say those prices again  Yeah it's $7, 15, 45  It comes from 15 to 45  It makes sense that once you get to 3.
5 hours if you have the balls to present them a validated ticket  Thinking you'll get a discount but you spent 3.
5 hours there  They want to say to you no you're not getting any discount  Like you obviously, you didn't come here just to eat  You came here to enjoy this place and you're going to pay like anyone else  But Mike was saying, well there's the trick  The upside is he knew a trick that when you valet they give you a golden token  Official golden City Walk coin I'm holding in my hand for a coffee machine  A sort of instantly or hot chocolate  You know you pick your drink  One side of the coin says City Walk, one side says Cup of Joe  So these are specially made  Oh yeah and he told us that while we were walking over he was like you gotta get that token  You have to ask for it because I've seen people not ask and not get it  And so I was like $45 I validated it and he's like look at the sign  It doesn't matter after 3.
5 hours and I was like well can I at least have my token please  And he went yeah sure and handed it to you and then we went around the corner  And the machine has a giant Aldebaran sign on it  And there's no way he didn't know that the machine is broken right  He would already have gotten into it a little with him  $45 what do you mean yeah that's what it is it's on the sign  Okay can I have the token?  Just give me the damn token  Yeah go get your coffee white don't you  It's like the last little bit of  He got a dig in at you at the end  Yeah  The reveal as we rounded the corner that the coffee machine that you spoke of so highly  You as if clear dialogue in a film you have to get the token to get that coffee  Oh that sounds good I love getting free coffee at places  Yeah there was  Alright let's go get the coffee turn the corner out of order  Also he should have given us four tokens for our troubles  Good point every time  That was never going to happen  He's only been one so yeah that seems that seems like a pie in the sky kind of a thinking there  That's too much money they don't want to piss away  So this was a disastrous encounter  As well as my valet parking experience  Presumably I'm not sure how this is going to plug into the episode but we're probably about an hour and 45 minutes deep into  Complaining about other parking issues so this settles right in and helps us  And we'll pass the baton to Nick Weiger now and see where he takes this discussion  But I'd like to just point out though that this makes Jason Wollner a four time guest  I don't know if that really matters  Four time is cool  Oh wow  Yeah well congratulations  Anything you'd like to say to Nick Weiger  Wish him luck on the episode  Yeah good luck and yeah just go for it just you know yeah here's the baton  And just like me in the past I now hold that golden coffee cup point in my hand  There it is  From the story from 15 sectors ago  From the very story  Wow  I've held it on to my person this whole time  Is that ebayable  Maybe  It is now with photos with certification  Well as we learned from Jason in the prior episode if we get a photo of Leah Thompson  Signing it or something next to it then that validates everything  But anyway that story just meant to show the madness and the depths that the valet situation  Can lead people to $45 cards and coins there's so much confusion  Yeah I was just gonna say I set it off there but I should have set it on my story is worse  Wow  Yeah exactly but when we get to Frank I mean maybe we'll write here but whatever you're gonna say  Well the other lots I don't have much to say about  The last thing I'll say about Jurassic Parking is there shouldn't be a situation at a theme park  Where people are stalking people leaving  Which is one of my I hate when people in a parking garage wait and sit and wait for somebody to pull out  I agree  There's gonna be another space just move you're stopping the whole thing from like  Oh that's the worst  Following people but this parking garage is constantly it's happening and it's so narrow  That it's hard to go around sometimes it blocks the whole thing up  Yeah  Like it's the worst parking garage there  The most bottlenecks  And that especially like because there's you know there's no employees there and at that point  It's been filled up because I think they must fill this one up early  Well this one I think is kind of where you it's not a guarantee but if you're coming from Lancashen  This is probably where they'll direct you again no guarantees  I'll say this about Jurassic Parking it's got a nice little the valet part has a nice little lighting  Yes that's nice  Popcorn lights  That is nice  And when I went up for my solo buka meal  I got the coffee machine was working and I had a nice  Oh hell yeah  Oh there you go  There are happy endings  So that was good  The first time too when I went up and I did the Jurassic Parking valet that's the cough  That's when I learned about it I went I got Johnny Rockets validated and I had like a hot  Cocoa in my car on a 90 degree day  With no lid filled right to the top  With no lid yeah  But it sounds like we've had two positive experiences and two negative which is not a great ratio  So yeah as far as Jurassic Parking that's those are my thoughts  Jurassic Parking should be chained  They need to do some work  They gotta do something  Demolish it  Blow it up like Jurassic Park itself  Yes  It's time for a site two  Yeah  Bomb it like they did at the end of the first book  In the book and not  Isla Nublar was bombed I believe yeah that's right  Because they weren't thinking about it the sequel  Right like the Jurassic Park franchise the  There's just so much peril and danger and honestly like inconsistent quality in Jurassic Parking  And you know I mean that's just an issue  I would say that for hearing your guys' valet stories I've never attempted to valet universal  But it seems like the valet hacks are high risk high reward  Like the reward is like getting $7 parking that's great  But the risk of getting $45 parking is just so punishing  Like that is just it's such a  It's crazy and I'll say bigger picture I think the general parking rates  It really seems like early generation CityWalk  It seems like they wanted the locals to come  Now it seems like they're trying to keep people out  It's pretty hostile in terms of how expensive it is  Yeah I mean even like I guess like oh after six o'clock $10  I guess that's okay but you can go to other malls in L.
A.
 and park for free  It's just a mall you can go yeah it's like you know what's another comparison  The Grove the Grove parking is no is you have to pay at the Grove  But it's nowhere near as expensive as it is at CityWalk  And there's much better stuff to do there  There's more stuff there  It is better  Yes  So why how does CityWalk hang on and especially how do they hang on when this is how they treat their parkers  It's just such a it's a small amount of real estate  Yeah  That's the problem because there's a if there wasn't a theme park attached to it that's the issue here  Right  Because the theme park lives on sucking parking money out of people  Yes  And there happens to be one that's just plugged in next to it  So it's impossible to take that element out of the because everyone would be parking up there for free then  It's serving dual purposes and that's its downfall  But if you went to Shoe Palace and bought like a 50 or 60 dollar pair of sneakers  And they won't validate like that's crazy  Yeah  And then you spent $25 for parking  But they probably worried about like a trick where you would like get it valid  Like there would be so many ways to validate general parking it would be like crazy  Yeah I mean the only way to live in LA for sustainable amount of time is to figure out all the tricks  Sure I hear what you're saying  These tricks that we're giving you if you're thinking about moving to LA  These will be crucial  This might be  Or you could not go to CityWalk at all  But don't do that  That's not a way to live  You want to go to the Americana  You want to go to the Americana park at the Galleria by the Target  It's free  Let me do my story then  Yes please  Let me ask what we got for Frankenstein  We'll start here  Okay  So this was at the Bucco di Beppo episode  Or Pepo as Jason called it on the episode  Remember everything  What is it supposed to be called?  Bucco di Beppo  B  B not a P  Where did you get Pepo?  I think I was saying Beppo  You said Pepo and Scott says like oh he doesn't even say it right  Beppo  You said Pepo  And in that one episode you did say that's a good note to go down on  Hey 24 7 365 something stays on my mind right folks?  No  Oh whoa  Do you know what that even don't even  Do you know about Runaway?  The Kanye West song  You know you don't even know who he is  No  Jason's being naughty  Yeah naughty  Okay so  So we're back to  I think if I remember when I was amongst you during that time  You blamed it on having Philly mouth  Well I did that is true  You mush mouth it a little bit  Philly mouth  We get so angry sometimes we can't even finish the words correctly  Bucco di Pepo but it's Beppo  Beppo?  Yeah  Yeah you're saying it right now  The sector keeper told you a long time ago  So you did think that was Pepo  That was not just a Philly mouth  No I know it's a B  Oh you do  Beppo  You're saying P though  You're definitely out loud saying P  Pepo  And I guess you're thinking about P too  Tell us your fucking story  Okay my fucking story  Frankenstein valet it was the Monday episode  And Monday and I were running a little late  We had just come from an important digital content  That we were involved in some digital content  Very cool  On Wilshire  Really?  And yeah so we were running a little late  And we were coming  I was like you know what  We're gonna valet  It's gonna be right there  It's gonna be no problem  I thought we were going to the Jurassic valet  It's impossible to figure out how to get to  One specific parking structure  Like if you're coming up Lancashire  I'm like I know where we're supposed to go  And I thought we were going in the right spot  But we ended up in Frankenstein  Which is on the other side of City Walk  From the Bucco di Beppo  And so we went in  I go no problem valet  We just walk across City Walk  It's still you know six seven minutes  But not a big deal  We go to valet  Everything's fine  We have the keys  We have a nice time  I get a free hat  It's lovely  We go back  And it's about 9.
30  It was not a late night  We got there at 7.
05 or something  And I know  Because I checked texts of like telling Scott  We're here  So I go up  I put the ticket down  And the guy goes $25  And I go no no no  I go it's I was here  For under two hours  And he goes no you were here at six  Like 15  And I go no  There's no way I was here for six  At six fifteen  He goes the card says six fifteen  I was like but  And I'm just like I don't know how many  I go I can show you text messages  That say I'm here  I go there's no way  I got here at seven oh five  That's not  I'm not crazy  And the guy's like it says six fifteen  $25  And I was like but you don't understand  I'm not trying to scam you or anything  I go it's truly I ate dinner  And then we went to the hat store  And we're here  I'm not he goes  And then I see the valet  So now I'm to a person that's just watching this go down  I'm a madman  I see a valet  I go hey oh hey hey  You remember like I came in  Like a little while  He looks at me like he's never seen me in his whole life  And he's like oh I don't hey I don't know  I'm not sure  I go but I came in earlier  And I go you know it was like around seven o'clock  And the guys are going I don't know man  I'm so I don't know I don't know what you're talking like  He just was like I don't need to deal with this maniac  And I go back up there I'm like I don't  And Monday was just sitting over  Like far away just looking at his phone  He was not involved in this at all  I kind of wish he was  Because I think he would have like put his fist through the glass  He's always saying he'll stick up for us  Right  And beat somebody up for us  This was his chance  He loves  He didn't say it  He loves talking about how like  The acquaintances of his  He would like bring a gun and meet them  Somewhere downtown if they asked him to  He said that about Evan Susser  He said I don't know Susser that well  But if he needed me to kill somebody for him  In the middle of the night I would do it  Quote Nick Mundy  He did say that yeah  We were talking on the phone  And he's sitting there ignoring  This crisis you're in  Yes he could have come in and like  He I'm not a tough guy  He's a tough guy  He could have really intimidated this guy  And this guy and I are just having a standoff  And I'm like  I'm feeling crazy because there's no  Chance  That we pulled in at 6.
15  There's no chance  Hold on so was the card time stamped  Yes  So what must have happened is somebody  Timestamped a card before  I was even in there and they didn't even realize it  Yeah that's shady fucking business  That's so crazy  You're supposed to use  You're paying a premium to use the valet  You're supposed to get a different level  Of service  And it wasn't even like  The guy who couldn't  And again these people are  Who knows how they're paid or treated  But like the guy could have given a fuck about  Like he was just like  Either I don't believe you  I don't care  I paid $25 to get my card  Like I felt so crazy  That sucks  Like I was trying to prove every which way  And no there was no  So I was like fuck  This is the worst  What a nightmare  Denied at every turn  Using logic  And you don't feel like you're being heard  It's like the American people right now  You were a make up for  You weren't represented  Thank you  It is exactly like that  Someone had to say  So is it  So you had the card in your possession the entire time  Yes and then they validated that at Bucatibepo  So the fraud took place before you were handed the card  Right so what must have happened was  Either somebody came in  And they thought they were going to have to go valet  And they pulled out  And they stamped a card  And then ended up just putting it on the thing  Or there's some funny business going on  Or they transposed that card with a different card  Like they should have handed you a different thing  Maybe  I mean they  The problem is then too  Is that the guy had already taken the card  So I never got a chance to take a picture of the card  To sort of like figure it out  I should have  You know I really should have emailed and complained about it  I was waiting to say it on the show  I can still email and complain  You're waiting for a fan to write all this fan  And them to email it  They owe me 18 motherfucking dollars  They absolutely do  Yeah let's get your 18 dollars  But we need to get Jason's Lowry's points back  Landry's points  Landry's points  That's my mistake  We need to get our 15 dollars each  We paid Jason Woolitor  Boys, boys, boys  Yes  Rob the vault  Wow  Why aren't we talking 18 dollars  When we could have 10 thousand dollars  Good point  He's really been listening to that new metal  The situation you've described  You would have had to  Enter from Lancashire  You would have had to avoid it  The little turnstiles to go into Jurassic Parking  Taking the road down  Past the hotel that kind of wraps around the Hilton  To get to Frankenstein?  No, no to get to Jurassic Valley  If I wanted to do that you're saying  If you wanted to do that  You would have had to take this little road  Right, right  That goes by the old box office for the  The late Gibson amphitheater  And then gone up the entrance from Cuenca  Yes, that's correct  Which is craite  Such a pain in the ass  Right  Why isn't there just signage directing you towards these lots  Why isn't there just a clear way to get there  Kind of is, but it's rough  The problem is  The problem is it's too much information  As far as which valley you're going to go to  To convey to a person driving  Right  Like they're on opposite sides of City Walk  But it's going to be impossible to be like  Where are you going in City Walk on a sign  And say here and then direct people  Like it's that's  I get it that it's just like  Valley parking this way  And if you came up here you're going here  And if you came up off of Ventura you're going here  We know City Walk better at this point  Than any other human being on the planet  And it's still  Other than the people who built it maybe  Yeah  To figure it out  There shouldn't be complicated verbal maps  That have to be described  There shouldn't be tickets with false timestamps  No  And coins  No  That don't lead to free coffee  This is all madness  It's madness  And you know we could keep talking about  The other parking garage  Throw in anything else you have  But this is all  It's led me to a higher point  That  Okay  In the first episode we talked about  Some general stuff about City Walk  And the founding of City Walk  And what it was trying to do  And what neighbors wanted out of it  But there were  I didn't get into this in episode one  There were a lot of people  Who were angry about City Walk  Authors and social critics  And that kind of thing  Wow  And I have some quotes from a couple different sources  But it starts with  A book called City of Quartz  Excavating the Future  The author Mike Davis  Who sighs at the mention of City Walk  And let me  The bigger  The entry point for all this  Is that people were upset  When it started  That you know  Like town centers should be  A vibrant part of the town  It should be up on a hill  And only for the super wealthy  It is like City Walk is trying to get people  Without money to stay down  To not climb up the hill  Right  If you are a poor person in a wheelchair  Who can't roll your chair  Up the freeway overpass  And to get up to  The Golden City on the hill  What do you do  So authors that people were tearing apart  City Walk in 1993  And here is a couple of choice quotes  I consider  Mike Davis  I consider it the moral equivalent of the neutron bomb  MCA executives have always stressed  The most popular parts of LA are now too dangerous  The city scene is a criminalized third world  So now they go off the real world  To simulators  Buzz buzz  There is a struggle going on today  To save the democracy of public space  I think City Walk ought to be burnt down  Wow  That is harsh  From social critics  Here is one I don't know the source of this  You can Google this quote  Or I will figure out where it is from  This guy gets even heavier  City Walk sneeringly mocks us  As it erases any trace of our real joy  Pain or labor  City Walk is the moment when  Baudrillard, not sure that is  Draws a huge satisfied breath  And draws deeply on his cigar  It is the simulacrum of the simulacrum  And then there is further quotes about how LA's  You know, the MCA executives did say  Downtown is too dangerous  We built a city for you  So you don't have to get into gunfire  They said real brazen stuff like that  And that leads this author to this quote  This author predicts  That as economic problems worsen  The territorial carve up of LA  Will lead to a Brazilian or Filipino style  Final solution  Private death squads protecting the enclaves  Of the super rich from everyone else  Wow  Yeah, kill me with a gun  Universal death squads  Whoa  So this is  By episode one  I thought this is silly  So that is pretty insane to derive all that  From just putting a fake city up on a hill  But after all of this parking madness  I kind of think Mike Davis, author of City of Quartz  Is onto something  And now I'm getting real worried about those death squads  Yeah  Well, Uhteriard is a French philosopher and sociologist  Often quoted in like college  You know, meta-textual papers and stuff  And in comedy stuff written by Harvard dudes  Right  I see, okay, very good  So anyway  Yeah, the kind of people who read Howard Zinn  There's George Will quotes in year two  There's a lot going on  Wow  Oh, God  I wish there was baseball up there  You know that bitch loves baseball  George Will, you a bitch who loves baseball  Now that's one for the Harvard guys  So, I don't know  Don't these quotes ring a little more true to you  Having been in these, you know  These awful confined quarters  In these parking garages  Here's the thing  There's places in Los Angeles  Up in hills  Like little places to shop  And you really get the sense that  These are for rich people  All the shops are for rich people  And it's like it's literally up a hill  So if you're homeless  There's no way you're walking up that hill to go get up here  I think there's truth to it because of geography  If City Walk wasn't just full of trash  Right  And I mean food  I mean  They're protecting the flip flops from the poor  If it was a much more attempted high brow experience  I would more agree with what all of these people are saying  But  And I say trash  Mostly lovingly  It's full of trash  We had a good time  I've ended up being more positive in this series than I thought I would be  But this parking garage  The more you lay it all out  You hear Jason's tale of woe  They're frustrated  Here's the issue  And this is what Mickey and Friends gets right  Is that the start and end of a day of a delightful day  Is as stress free as a stressful thing can be  Right  And here I feel like it's the most stressful parking situation you'll ever encounter  Both parking and exiting  In particular hearing your guys' stories about valets and hacks gone wrong  It's just you potentially could be left with a very large bill upon exiting the lot  Exiting CityWalk slash Universal Studios where you've already spent a lot of money  Where it was already an indulgence  It's like an extra fuck you out the door  Sure  And that is not what a parking structure should accomplish  To the quotes you were talking  CityWalk is not an exclusive enclave for the super wealthy  It is not the Brentwood Country Mart  It's very different than what those people were anticipating it was going to become  Because to Carlson's point it is just a trash place  It's just a junkyard  The super enclave for the super wealthy don't usually have an upside down pink Cadillac with a cow in the driver's seat  Not all the way, they might  Yeah  There isn't a giant candy store  It's a tacky place  It's very tacky  It's a super tacky place  It's a touristy place  The parking structures I think suck  Frankenstein lot I've never parked in  The thing I liked about it is that it's underneath the Minion Mayham ride which is great  That's kind of cool that you're just underneath it  And I think the signage there is actually kind of fun  There was a Frankenstein restroom sign that you took a picture of  That I thought was just in a nice  Where the bathroom silhouettes, one was the hair of the bride of Frankenstein  And one was like a Frankenstein monster  Which is great, that's a lot of fun  I would like that  Thanks for getting back to a positive note  I think the theming at the Frankenstein lot is okay  The other lot there that we didn't touch on  There's the fabled King Kong lot which I've never even seen in person  We found that at the very end of the night  So that is sort of like a little surface lot during horror nights  Where a lot of pick up and drop offs are  It's adjacent to the, again, the old Gibson amphitheater standalone little hut box office  And now it's used where like crew trucks will park too if they're shooting  Got it  Nice and simple  Paints an easy mental image  The Woody Woodpecker lot is a surface lot adjacent to Jurassic Park  And that's the one where if you pay $35  Which, alright dude, why would you do that?  Like that gets you, I guess a little closer but not real  The main thing it does is you end up skipping City Walk  Which is maybe something you pay $10 to do  But also why would you? Especially after all this  Wait, you skip City Walk because it dumps you out right into Universal Studios  Closer  But you can backtrack still into, you're not banned from going into City Walk  Okay, right  What confuses me early on like as you're talking about this  Like the newer restaurant Vivo, it's an Italian place, just opened  That is like a higher quality than a lot of the places we ate up there  And a lower price point than say like a Bubba Gump or a Margaritaville  So like I kind of, I don't understand, so the parking is going up  But food prices are going down, same with Ludo  Like Ludo is cheaper, like you get a little bit of a premium charge on that  Because it's a little better ingredients than like the Panda Express  Because they made the chicken extra cold for you  Yeah, because they pay for the cold  They're not perfect  But the Panda Express is the same Panda Express that is a few blocks down on Ventura  For like two or three dollars more  The economics of it makes no sense  It's kind of confusing and I think that's the spot where City Walk is weak  Where it's like, oh even Jason's parking that did go over  There's at least a minute logic, there's at least a logic to that  It's the stuff that there seems to be no internal logic  Or it's grown bigger than it can control  It's a weed, it's out of control  It's a weed that's out of control, yeah  I think it doesn't have to be this way, I think there's hope  Look at that, that Vivo situation, there's more reasonably priced restaurants  Where you actually get the value that you're after  I think that, here's what I, and I think they have to do this  With places like The Grove and The Americana  Which are total successes, everyone, snarksters love The Americana  This mall in Glendale with a little trolley and everything  Super cynical people, go have a great time  I think it's, some parts of it have like Disney level theming and production value  They did a great job  And City Walk I think has to step up their game  I think you'll see a lot more local traffic if they ease off on all this  Why do they have to be such greed mongers in this parking area?  Right, yeah, it really doesn't make any sense  But you know what's gonna happen in response to this is that they're going to add like  The Fiona lot from Shrek  That's like, they'll pick that character for some reason  And then parking there will be like $55  Unless you get there before 5.
30  At which point it's $8 if you stay for 4 hours or fewer  It's like they're gonna have a more complex solution that's gonna make this even more  Complicated and convoluted for customers  I just think like, I don't love getting there and getting out of there  But I kind of do have fun when I'm there  City Walk, yeah, like Jason was touching on the economics of the different establishments  Don't make any sense, they're wildly inconsistent  Some places are overpriced, other places are resembling a value  The movie theater I kind of like  I don't know why I'm getting into my general thoughts  We're supposed to be in Sector 19  We're wrapping up the saga, say whatever you want  Okay, because I was worried the Sector Keeper was glaring at me  Go for it  But yeah, a lot of the businesses there suck  And a lot of them are really bad  There's a few diamonds in the rough  And it's also just kind of like a fun thing to walk through  If you're going to Universal Studios  It's like a fun little bonus  Like the same purpose that Downtown Disney serves  So I like it for that reason  But yeah, I just wish they'd figure out the overall experience  By the way, we think of all the lots  King Kong, Woody Wedpecker, E.
T.
, Frankenstein, Curious George, and Jurassic Park  Just like the most incoherent Avengers movie ever  Like what is happening here?  And the E.
T.
 attraction long gone  The Curious George play area gone  I guess he walks around still  Frankenstein definitely walks around  Maybe they should just re-theme them all to characters from one of the movies  Right, just make them all minions  Just make them different minions  And then kids get to see minions on their way in  You get to see Bob, you get to see Stuart  You can tell which.
.
.
  I mean, that could be confusing because the minions do look pretty similar  So maybe that's not a good idea  No, it's the three-eyed one  It's the one without goggles  But you could be in the minions garage  Or the Gru garage  Or the girls garage  The Pharrell garage  Yeah, the Pharrell  I was going to say just make them all E.
T.
 characters  E.
T.
's depressed mom  E.
T.
's depressed mom  Depressed Elliot  Depressed Elliot's sister  Maybe they're all just versions of Elliot  Isn't every character depressed in that movie?  Sick Elliot, healthy Elliot  Obviously the garage that you want  Hashtag Botanicus  Yeah, he would cheer everybody  And he'd be a nice kind of like guide on the way  To start your day  And put the robot, what's left of the robot in there  Yeah, he's still bumming around  I hope putting the photo out there can help us track down where Botanicus is at  God, it's so sad  Yeah, have him welcome you  This way he can explain all the rules  $45 if you're here past two and a half hours  You know, I think this is it  I think this is what the solution is  I think you keep Jurassic Parking  And use that as a baseline  And you go around and you make the other lots named after dinos  And then so you've got  Because dinos are different sizes and they look differently  And that's also fun theming  And then it's all like Jurassic Parking  It's all like part of that  And you've got the main hub  And then you've got the peripheral raptor lot  And the T-Rex lot  And the Triceratops lot  Was there Triceratops in Jurassic Park?  I don't remember  Oh, that's right, that's right  And you know, and  Big pile of poop lot  Right, there you go, yeah  I agree  Here's my idea of a solution  Private death squads protecting the enclaves of the super rich from everyone else  Well that sounds like Universal's The Purge series  Oh yeah, oh name them after all the different purges  There you go  Anarchy first year  From Fitzr  I have a radical idea  That's my idea for what City Walk would be in ten years  Oh, I'd like to hear it  I think they should just get rid of all the parking garages  And there should be parking garages  Like kind of far away  But then there will be like a high speed  Something, a high speed gondola  Something to shoot you up into City Walk  Because we need so much real estate now  For more City Walk  For more theme park  And that, those parking garages  Take up a lot of space  And the way we're going, if they keep expanding  There's only going to be more people  So we're running out of space as it is  Let's get rid of all parking up there  Except maybe for an employee  Let's let the employees park up there  Yeah, move it a little bit  Get a little bit further off site  Have some sort of, what was Elon Musk's  Cocaine dream for Dodger Stadium  Magic roller skates you're getting on  Yeah  Fucking George Will-ass bitch  Hahahaha  Hahahaha  Let's get Elon Musk to build a high speed gondola  That will shoot you from  Like some Burbank parking garage  To Universal in 25 seconds  I think if you tweet that at him  There's like a 30% chance he'll just  Say yes  We're working on it already  Yeah, we're already underway, we asked this one guy to build it  But he's a pedo  Yes, once again the diver is a pedo  And I will get on top of that  But yeah  Abolish all parking at CityWalk  Yeah, I think that's great because also too  That solves a lot of the confusion  You got one central lot and that's how a lot of theme parks work  You're directed to a lot  And then there's a shuttle that takes you to the facility  Why shouldn't CityWalk be modeled on that  Helicopters, like Jurassic Park  Yes, fine, great  They're running helicopters all day  And you park up in the Burbank Hills  And then you see  CityWalk and Universal Studios  Approaching as you fly over it  I don't want to just walk right into my  Segment, but maybe I will  Then you can make a big  Sort of lake out by Margaritaville  A little man made lake  And then you can fly Jimmy Buffett's Hemisphere  Dancer plane, the plane  Famously shot up by the Jamaican government  That he wrote the song Jamaican Mistake  Oh, okay, thanks for reminding me  Would there be a  Walkaround Bono character on this plane  As he allegedly was  Oh, that was scary  Close call  I've got a radical solution  For this radical problem  Yank that Were the World set  Wow  Get it out of there  That's a huge plot of land  That's been there for so long  What do you think about this  It's such a hit though  It's so amazing  Such an amazing set  Radical problems require  A radical solution  I don't know, it's time for the new  Would you keep Whoville  Always keep Whoville  Of course  Whoville is the only thing keeping the Grinch at bay  I don't know  The War of the Worlds  I like War of the Worlds better than I like  The Fast and Furious ride  Part of the tram  Practical  I like seeing what a horrific plane accident  Would look like in real life  Versus the kind of screeny  But better than Diagon Alley  Wait, we're not talking about Diagon Alley  We're talking about parking specifically  If you're telling me  I have a choice between Diagon Alley  Or a plane that's been  Crashed  Yes, I agree with you, put Diagon Alley over there  What if the crashed plane was  The Hemisphere Dancer  In an alternate reality where the plane  Was brought down by the Jamaican government  That's a fantastic idea  And there's a slain Bono on the ground  His sunglasses  Cracked in half  And Horror Nights gets even more graphic  Body riddled with anti-aircraft fire  The Edge controlling  The gun  The Edge killed him?  That's the sort of scary twist  That you expect from Horror Nights  Yeah, I'm okay with that  I'm fine with that  Can I just, one more thing on the parking garages  It does kind of make City Walk as part of the city  Kind of an eyesore  Those parking garages are  Super aesthetically pleasing from the outside  But I will say  That in the last couple years  They made the trip down the hill  At night  A beautiful experience  You align them with palm trees  The lighting looks really nice  So when you finally find your way out of this crazy labyrinth  And you're going down  I feel like it's a very nice and pleasant  And better aesthetically than when you're leaving  Making friends  Some of the universal heroes  Saying hi to you, King Kong, the dinosaur, the Simpsons  All your pals waving goodbye  This is true, there are signs saying have a good night  Good night humans  And this gives me hope for the future  Of City Walk and parking  The infrastructure that they've done  In and around the area  Yeah, that hill is nice, those signs are nice  All the metro improvements  Recently  That stuff is good, some of that stuff is more  Aesthetically pleasing  There was a lot of concern from residents about  That they removed a freeway  Overpass and that it was going to cause a lot of congestion  But it's actually been fine, they did a good job  So there's been some good universal things  And I say all that just to say  Please let us come do live shows there  And don't kick us out just because we set all the hacks  And because I tried to sneak in with my paper ID  Yeah, we opened the John Lovett's comedy club  So these guys can go into a live show  Yeah, let us perform in the abandoned space  I don't want to rain on your parade a little  But so having crossed over from the metro a lot this time  More often than not  The escalator up to the bridge has been broken  So it's just kind of that weird sensation of walking up an escalator  That's just stairs  I hate that  I hate that  I hate that  So I took the elevator the other day  The elevator fucking beat up  Oh no  Flywood and duct tape  Someone like punctured the glass elevator door  Wait a minute  I think I know who did it  It's this newly brazen  Limp biscuit listening brake stuff  Sector keeper  Sector keeper?  Yeah, that's right  Oh my god  Violence rules  Oh shit  We're better to rebel  Than in your own home in city walk  Where you're trapped  Yeah, I'm sick of this place, it's dumb, I want out  I think that's how I feel  Sector keeper  I don't know, you kind of imagine  I can't take it anymore  I'm lashing out  These are like my teen years, man  He's got a cool  He has a cool leather jacket on  He's dressed like Shia LaBeouf's Matt Williams character  Matt Jones 4  He's got a lighter with a body  Forties babe on it  I don't care for that, could you please not show that to me  I like babes and I like motorcycles  Vroom vroom bitch  Watch out, he's got a switchblade  He's flipping it around his hip  Just to come  Oh my god  You got us  SK, you got us again  I messed up the elevator good  Yeah, well I mean  Wait a minute, but also if you're able to  Manipulate the space around you  And if you're in your teen years  And you're wearing these greaser clothes and everything  I feel like that means that your strength is getting all the way back up to its final state  Yes, you've given me strength  I think I have a reason for that  It's because the Sector 19 stone this whole time  Why it's been the City Walk gold cup of joe token  That's right  We got it early on  We didn't know the meaning of it  It's just been sitting in your pocket  You could have lost it, you could have used it as a laundry coin or something  No, no, I kept this close to my heart  It was yours the whole time  You had the key  And it only cost you $45  For which you didn't get coffee  Yes  So we've got all 19 is what we're saying  We've got all 19 stones  Boys, boys, you've given me great strength  You sound so much older now  That's right, I'm feeling great  Whoa  Wow, you sound like a guy who just did all 30 days of like Whole30 or something  Yeah, yeah, I'm feeling really good  Oh my god  Wow, you've been so many years all of a sudden  Yes, it's all coming back to me, all of it  All the years that I've missed  And boys, I have to say that not only do you give me strength  You give me great knowledge  I've learned that through this journey  There are other places I want to visit  You do?  Boys  I have to say that  There's one more mission  You're kidding me  As a boy  I heard of a place  A place like CityWalk  But it wasn't just a city  It was truly downtown  Boys  In order to complete my soul fully  Oh my god  The journey continues  I need you to take me to downtown Disney  Oh, right  You son of a bitch  Damn it  Watch your head, this old ass motherfucker  Look what he led us into  Oh no  Now that you're older I'm gonna kick your ass, you prick  Please, please, I need to experience it  Take me around, the entertainment, the food  I don't want to see it all  Wait, you seem pretty like, corporeal now  You seem like  You just drive yourself  You're just like a guy now  Alright, well, is that an employee badge?  Do you have a job now?  Do you work at the ESPN zone  At downtown Disney?  It's been closed though  You got a job at a closed ESPN zone?  It might be reopening it  The hotel's not getting built  I'm looking for a place, if anyone  knows, has any leads  Right now I'm crashing in Alta Nina  That's a rough commute  It's a hell of a commute  All our places are pretty tight  And it's all pretty close  to Universal Studio  We all live close to Universal  And you know that, you want to get into a different  part of town  I know a guy who lives in Santa Monica  who probably has some space  Mr.
 Weiger?  Can I stay with you?  Look, Sector Keeper  I'd love to help you out, but as we've already  established, I'm fourth in line  for succession, so I mean if some tragedy  were to befall each of these three gentlemen  then that would be the only way I could possibly let  you into the home in Santa Monica  that I share with my lovely wife  Well, thankfully we're all  in great health, nothing will happen  to us, we all eat right, we definitely  we get all of our hot dog  nitrates, and I'm not afraid  of anybody having any sort of  heart incident  Jason has plenty of apple strudel all alone  For dinner  That's right, Nick joined us on our hotel outing  where the waiter owned my ass  Well, I like the  waiter said to you, I guess  we're going on our own round too  Oh boy guys  Here we go again  Oh boy  Well, I guess with that being said  Nick Weiger, you survived  Podcast The Ride once again  You survived the City Walk Saga  and all of you at home survived  the City Walk Saga  Incredible  To commemorate the closing out  I'd like to do something  I was inspired by Scott  starting the City Walk Saga  in a triumphant manner  and I'd like to close it out on a similar note  Sector Keeper, if you wouldn't mind putting  your microphone toward  the computer and I have not  rehearsed this, so let's see if it happens  Can you put down your Jules Sector Keeper  Alright, here we go  I always knew City Walk was a great  place, now baby I'm sure  I love sugar for the candy  even though  it's steaming's mature  I love Hard Rock's new doll mascot  her name's  Harper Ray  Jason's washing himself  with a donut  What more can I say  Alright everybody  No, you now  City walking on  City walking on sunshine  City walking on sunshine  And it doesn't feel good  Wow, I know you don't need it anymore  but does that give you strength?  Oh man, I don't know what that gives me  it gives me something  Well, I can't  think of a more beautiful note to end on  other than my beautiful  note to end on because I also  did the same thing  that you did  Same song? No, no, no  I was getting a little worried  I thought of a different one  and what I thought  of kind of stems from, you know, in the first  episode we were comparing all of the  architectural works of  John Jertie to different  U2 albums and we were just talking  about U2 now, about Bono's  body shot down in the War of the Worlds  area and yeah, yeah  and you know  I just feel so bitter sweet at this moment  and I, it's just  I feel like what I've learned  through all this is that City Walk is more  than just a theme park adjacent  retail center  what it really is, is the  mall that you can't leave behind  Here, Mike  hit it  It's a double encore  And if the popcorn  upless  no longer  pops  pops  And if the LA  sock market  runs out of  socks  The Raiders still aren't  in LA  So indoor  skydive away  You can fly  Sector Keepers  fly, you're free  now, goodbye boys  Walk on  City Walk on  If you park  you can rebate it  with your movie theater  ticket, park on  City Walk on  It's five o'clock  somewhere  There you have it  Wow, there you have it  Boys, boys, you give me so much strength  Thank you, thank you  Now why don't you do yours  Yeah, I mean  I was gonna do mine, but first  I wanted to let Jason do his rendition  of Walk on By  by the Stardust Jazz Singers  Were you Googling an old song with Walk in  I was looking for something like  Count Basie Big Band or something, that was the best thing to do  There's that song Walk Right In  Step Right Down  So I was going, yeah, I was like, boots are made for  walking, I thought about  Walk On  It would have been funny if we both, we had two different  Walk On  I had been trying to figure out how to  make the chorus of the  Videopolis thing song  We're going to the walk to the city walk  and that's about as far as I got  That's pretty good, wait, do that one more time  though and just super commit, maybe we can lay in music  We're going to the walk to the city  walk on a shopping  time till we drop at the city walk  Great, great, wow  We all did songs  and Sector Keeper  boy, I thought we were going to  I was worried I was going to have to say goodbye to you  and we'd never see you again, but I guess  see you in Anaheim  See you in Anaheim  Just be careful, you're spilling your dip cup  Oh yeah, your char cup  I chew skull now  Wow, that's cool  I spit it into Mountain Dew Code Red  bottles and I throw it  Well, here's the roast  So you've gone from like a 50's greaser  to like a Mid-Aughts  dirt bag  I'm still finding my way  Please forgive me if, you know, when you see  me next it's nothing like this  You know, I'm figuring it out  You're going to have some tribal tattoos and a  tap out shirt  Is it possible that you're going to sound like you're being  portrayed by a different actor  entirely? Potentially, yeah  depending on schedules and what not  So that people with audience would have to forgive  that if that was the case  You know, I think no matter what the case or cadence  or sound of my voice, you know  you'll see me one place and that's behind  a paywall  Oh, very good  I like the way you think  SK  I like the way you think, like the way you look  which is kind of like a Phil K.
 Dick  like morph suit from Skinner Darkly  where your identity is constantly  changing so as to disguise  your real nature  but I guess that's between the worlds  you're walking between the dimensions still  Right, that's right  Well, you're one of those and  us three, good but  increasingly bad boys are going to be  heading down to Anaheim  with a lot of trips with a teenage  dirt bag  Eventually, with no  timeline attached to it  With absolutely no month commitment  whatsoever or an amount  God damn it  I know the sector keeper doesn't know  the amount of sectors  It would have to be more than City Walk, right?  I don't know if it would have to be  I think there's an argument to be made  that it would be less  The problem is that we'd have to review all the businesses on Harbor  Oh no  Yes, most definitely  Captain Kidd's Buffet  Let's cut this thing off before anyone gets  The Mimis on Harbor  Harbor is a many miles boulevard  Yeah, yeah, just a couple miles of it  Oh no, alright  Well, see you for the 67 part  Downtown Disney  Saga  Someday  Alright y'all, you did it, we did it  Goodbye  Subscribe to our YouTube channel  Follow us on Twitter and Instagram  At ForeverDogTeam  Thanks for watching
