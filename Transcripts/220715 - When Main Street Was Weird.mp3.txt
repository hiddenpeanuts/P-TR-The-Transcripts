 Forever.
  Dog.
  Warning, the following podcast may contain devil dung,  buttermilk farts, blushing hubbies,  and bras, bras, bras.
  We stroll to the turn of the century by way of 1955  as we talk weird old bullshit that used to be on Main Street  on Podcast The Ride.
  ["Wild Wings of the Sun"]  Welcome to Podcast The Ride, a podcast about theme parks,  but also shockingly often weird old meats.
  I'm Scott Gardner, joined by Jason Sheridan, hello.
  Meats, M-E-A-T-S?  Yeah, not meetups, no.
  I wouldn't say that today is largely about weird old meats,  but we are talking about weird old stuff on Main Street,  and that includes restaurants, and restaurants in the 50s  at Disneyland had to include weird old meats.
  Oh yeah.
  It just didn't, doesn't count as a restaurant  unless there's something you would never  put in your mouth today.
  Yeah, absolutely.
  And joining us, hmm, hmm, the video watchers.
  This is a video one, by the way,  and you can find that on the Forever Dog YouTube,  but the video watchers can already see an empty chair.
  The listeners, you'll figure this out with us.
  Mike Carlson, hello?  I did feel about like 150 pounds lighter or so.
  Mm-hmm, his private is more than that.
  I don't know, I have to give him,  but it's by sheer height, by sheer height.
  Yeah, yeah, by sheer amount of him.
  I didn't want to go too much more than that and be like,  you know.
  Well, he's not here, so you don't want to start saying,  yeah, that 230 pounds, I don't believe so.
  No, Mike, this is, so he's late.
  This does not happen usually,  and I think normally we might just wait on it,  but we're here at the glamorous Forever Dog Studios.
  We want to get moving, use the slot that we have,  he texts us that he's late and just start without him,  so this is all being done with his permission.
  You know, this feels, this is interesting first of all.
  I think this has, and we've done one just you and I,  but not one where we will start just you and I,  and then there will be this burst of absolute panic,  just sheer.
  I love it.
  The most, and we all get it together.
  The listeners get it, the watchers get it  on the Forever Dog YouTube channel.
  The bundle of stress that we're,  like Santa Claus is coming.
  I love it.
  Stress to Claus, stress to Claus.
  I absolutely love a little bit of chaos,  a little bit of uncertainty,  and maybe it's just the hunger,  maybe it's just the hunger of not having done improv  in three years.
  It's just like a little bit of the unknown.
  Yeah, well, sure, sure, you know,  we've done our little, we've done our live shows,  but we aren't like, you know, we haven't done a ton.
  You have this weekly slot  that you have not been back to,  but the people who were up live all the time,  the Chris Rocks and the Dave Chappelle's of the world,  they've had the wild cards of people trying to kill them.
  You know, you haven't had that level  of something unaccountable from the audience.
  No, I have not.
  I mean, I guess my equivalent would be like  a hungry coyote trying to steal like the ham sandwich  I packed in a Ziploc bag in my bag.
  Like, hey, get out of here, pal.
  Does that, has that happened?  No, it hasn't.
  No, I'm saying that would be my equivalent.
  No, I'm not saying anything too incendiary  that someone would be coming after me.
  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, just general interest  in things that people might have.
  Yes.
  Your weird meats.
  Yeah, my weird meats.
  A man-o-mole might want your weird meats.
  But so, we'll just see.
  We'll see when the bomb goes off.
  I don't know if it will be in 10 minutes.
  I don't know if it'll be later than that,  because does he remember that today  he is at the Glamorous Foreverdawg Studios?  Well, yeah, I did something similar a few weeks ago  where I was a half hour off.
  And so, I was driving over when he texted me  and was like, where are you?  And I'm like, in the car, what do you mean?  And I was like, oh no, it's one, not 130, isn't it?  And so, I started using an old shared,  I have a podcast to write, like Google Calendar,  that I think I mostly used it.
  You should get the listeners on that too,  so you know what's coming up.
  Yeah, I'll put it on.
  You know where we are, and that we are producing  the episodes, there's more going on with Club 3,  so if you wanna keep track of our iCal,  make sure we're hitting these dates.
  So, I'll remind him that that is,  he can punch that into his calendar app.
  The calendar is, yes, I use the calendar, yeah.
  I'm on the calendar, you send me those invites.
  And well, the issue that you have with Mike though,  is that you get him on those alerts,  and then you get lost in an avalanche of 100 alerts  of like, there's a new kind of Batman sticker releasing.
  There's new, you can get a deal of two fries for one  at a restaurant that he doesn't like.
  Right, that's right, I forgot about all his notifications,  because I said I turned all of mine off except reminders,  and text messages, and phone calls.
  So, if I get a weird notification, it's like,  oh, fuck, I downloaded a new app, gotta turn that off,  fuck that up, you know?  But he's like-  Mike just, the more that he can,  he's like, through the looking glass,  every day is like the end of 2001.
  Yeah, he's still somehow getting Circuit City notifications.
  It's a, yeah, zombie accounts, closed stores that are,  yeah, Fry's Electronics, he's getting alerts about the deals.
  He's getting the HBO Go, like,  this app is no longer supported,  please download HBO Max to continue watching HBO programming.
  Well, it might come back, I mean,  the effort it would take to shut off the alert,  like in that time, you might as well just leave it on.
  Yeah, yeah.
  Mm-hmm.
  Well, we'll see when it happens.
  We'll, and boy, this is a good one for video,  because the empty chair,  I'm just looking up at our monitor.
  The empty chair is a very funny visual.
  I'd also so think it's very funny if he comes in  totally prepared for a different episode.
  That's possible too, yeah.
  Yeah, if he's like, oh, god,  so what does everyone think of the King Arthur carousel?  That's fine, we can pivot, we can half and half it,  you know, we'll just, we'll leave an index for the listener.
  Or, okay, so if you want King Arthur's carousel,  remember half of it is in the weird old Main Street episode.
  Oh, yeah, that was a thing for a little while.
  I don't think it lasts a smart podcast with chapters,  and I think the image would change as you went through.
  I don't think this caught on.
  Mm-hmm, it sounds exceedingly complicated.
  Absolutely.
  More effort than we wanna put in,  but we do like complication, so if we can create a scenario  where there's gonna be a lot of different arrows  drawn to different podcasts, I mean, we've done that.
  We have a podcast series that picked up two years later  with one with a secret title.
  I feel like a lot of people still haven't figured out  the secret title.
  If you go to our Patreon and listen to the episode  Universal Cruise Line, you'll see that.
  The cruise line.
  Yes.
  A little Easter egg happening in there.
  Yeah, yeah, which was, I mean, that was still fall 2020.
  We were all insane, and so I think we were,  oh, a little bit, we love doing little surprises.
  And listeners seem to like it.
  I don't think a lot of other shows do surprises.
  That's well because they don't care.
  They don't give a shit about you.
  Yeah.
  But we do, the two of us do.
  The two of us do.
  The two of us who cared enough to be here on time  for you and pointing in this video iteration,  again, at the Forever Dog YouTube channel,  because people seem to get confused where that is.
  All right, so yeah, there's confusion with that too.
  What goes where, what episodes are where.
  But let's kick it off proper, and we'll allow Mike  to give any introductory thoughts.
  Yeah, we'll give him the log line and yeah.
  Remind him what it is.
  But today's episode, I mean, look,  I don't think we've landed on the name exactly,  but in my head, at least what it is thematically  is weird old Main Street bullshit.
  That's kind of what we're addressing today,  which is to say attractions, and I say that  with like the floppiest, limpest quotation marks  I could possibly do.
  Things that visitors could experience  in the first five years or so in Disneyland's  beginning area of Main Street USA.
  Yes, yeah, a lot more exhibits, a lot more sponsored tie-ins,  and not just like this restaurant is sponsored  by Kraft Foods.
  Sure.
 Like an exhibitor sponsoring,  and maybe showing you the history of something,  showing you their products over the years,  and solely to cover some of the costs,  because that was what an interesting fact I found out  these leases, it was like a five-year lease,  and Walt won it the first year and the last year upfront,  so he could have a little operating money.
  So the other ones you can pay like regular retailer rent.
  Oh, interesting.
  Well, and it was like early Disneyland  was such a weird risk and calamity  that that's sort of a big ask.
  If Walt is saying, hey, I need you through 1960,  and give me some of that cash, they might be thinking,  what if there is no Disneyland in 1960?  I think that was a very real possibility.
  Extremely, especially given some of the things  that we will be talking about, because if this is what,  like I think we've had some of these stray,  like oh, I heard they had this in the early days,  and this and that, and when you look into it,  you really start to go, how did Disneyland make it?  Disneyland was sort of like, this is what they had,  all the hype, they hype it on television for a year,  and then it has, well, we'll get into it,  but it's, a lot of it is extremely mundane, I would say.
  Yeah, and some of it makes sense.
  I'll throw out a kind of a generic one,  the book and candle shop.
  Okay, sure, like candles, kind of a go-to  when you travel to tourist destinations.
  That's like, oh, it's a nice thing,  it'll remind me of the trip,  I can bring it home for myself,  I can bring it home for a gift.
  Makes sense, especially the idea of Main Street being,  I was telling you before we started recording,  there's so many articles just saying,  it's based on Marceline, Missouri,  and kind of, the answer is kind of.
  It's more based on, like John Hench  and a lot of other Imagineers talked about,  it's based on the idea of a perfect Main Street,  in the past, there's a little bit of nostalgia here,  and memory is kind of a difficult thing.
  Because you're saying that,  if it were more literally based on where Walt Disney grew up,  you said it's not a particularly glamorous place.
  Yeah, I mean, I think a lot of places back then,  the Main Streets, while they were,  like everything you needed in town,  so everyone could walk there,  or take a horse and buggy, or early cars,  it was filled with mud,  and everything was painted like one or two colors,  and there were newly installed power lines everywhere,  like it's kind of gross,  it doesn't look like the World's Fair, you know?  You had to go elsewhere in Disneyland  if you wanted a bunch of mud.
  There definitely was mud.
  There was mud, they did get that,  but the idealized perfect Main Street,  they were trying to keep spick and span.
  Sure, yeah, yeah, yeah.
  We're doing this, by the way,  I think this episode will be landing  kind of right around the anniversary,  that mid-July point, which is Disneyland's birthday,  I think the 67th anniversary, I believe,  if my math is not.
 I think that's right, yeah.
  Happy 67th.
  You doing anything for the 67th?  I don't know.
  I think I blacked out for a little while.
  We're celebrating by not going,  even though we gave them a bunch of money.
  Yeah, yeah, yeah, blacked out on the past,  not blacked out on Walt Scots Mist or whatever.
  I don't know, that's an idea, though.
  We'll see how I feel when July 17th rolls around.
  Oh, that's something to do on July 15th.
  That's an episode.
  Eat, drink, and smoke like Walt for a day.
  Yeah, yes.
  Well, you know what I discovered over the course  of this bit of research is there is a book  called Eat Like Walt.
  There's a handy guide to how to do exactly this  that we've been talking about.
  I have seen that book.
  Is it in an official Disney book?  I don't believe so.
  Oh, okay.
  Because every now and then there's some very specific books  and it's like, oh wow, Hyperion Publishing.
  You know, like.
  Yeah, I'm not sure.
  Here's what I can say is that I went to the website,  eatlikewalt.
com, and the mouse ears that I saw on it  seemed not standard issue.
  Like the, you know, it's a circle and the two circles,  but they seemed like maybe calculatedly  like legally in the clear.
  We make them a little smaller, a little asymmetrical,  then maybe Disney can't come after you.
  But anyway, that's what I think like, you know,  it's opening day week.
  We did this episode two years ago that I enjoyed so much  about Disneyland's opening day,  which seemed like such bedlam and such just odd wild west  where obviously there was the wet cement  and there wasn't working water and there were monkeys  with organ grinders and then the host of the broadcast  cheating on his wife live on the air  while hopped up on meth essentially.
  I've just been so, that just made me go like,  wow, Disney really was, even the clips that they choose  to show you of that opening day special  can still kind of give you the man.
  It's Art Linkletter and it's Ronald Reagan  and then like that's Americana right there.
  But I think if you get past kind of the wall  that they've set up and see like what that park really was  for the first year or so, it was weird and sloppy  and it is kind of amazing it made it  and it's such a like tent pole of culture now.
  Yeah, you know, when I, we first,  I started reading stuff about this and everything  and I was like, oh, am I just, you know,  looking at it through like 2020 eyes?  Like is it, was it stuff people actually liked at the time?  And to an extent maybe, but then also you see the like,  stores that aren't stores, you see that like,  I just need a little operating money.
  Like I'm just trying to get anyone who will take it,  you know, in here and then you start to dig down  the specifics of like, no, that can't be,  I can't be right, no, that, oh my God, it is right.
  Yeah, yeah, I mean, some of them are just boring.
  Like, honestly, and I don't mean to like say  that this won't be a good fun episode,  but truly like the things that I don't have  a bunch of stuff prepared about,  there were things that were so boring  that I did take like a hard nap yesterday  because I was looking at a big article  about the Disneyland baby shoes store.
  Like, there's gotta be something interesting  in here somewhere and then, oh my God,  I went out just like a brick.
  Oh, is that grandma's baby shop?  You know, confusingly not.
  It's not grandma's baby shop.
  I did come across grandma's baby shop,  but separately there was something called  blue bird baby shoes.
  So grandma's baby shop is not blue bird baby shoes.
  Because I didn't see much on it,  but as soon as I saw, in reference to another place  we'll talk about said, it's right past grandma's baby shop.
  And I was like, grandma's baby shop, let's fucking go.
  Yeah, I was upset there wasn't more information  about grandma's baby shop.
  Yes, I, you know, I think Yesterland,  one of them, Yesterland, a very good website  about like stuff at the Disney parks  that's not there anymore, pretty thorough,  quoted someone, another website or another article  was like, there is not a lot of documentation  on the book and candle shop.
  And it is so weird to see these places  that are pretty thorough say that.
  But then when they say right after grandma's baby shop,  it's like, is that the funniest phrase on Yesterland?  Right after grandma's baby shop.
  It's only for like, yes, I want some things for my baby.
  No, get out the door.
  This is for grandma's to buy for babies.
  Yes, it would be, all right, if you're a grandma  and then you also have your own new baby, that's allowed,  but no mom's buying things for babies.
  No, no.
  Grandma's only.
  So, all right, to start getting into some of these things,  and by the way, like just the way this has played out,  is this the first episode in months  where the phrase bad boys of Boston has not been said?  So far it hasn't.
  We've made it like 15, 20 minutes,  well I did it, I did it by.
  You did it, let's not tell him we mentioned that.
  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
  And let's see if it comes up organically.
  Let's see if he naturally, if he comes in so guns blazing  and knowing what has been lacking in his absence,  he's just gonna come in and start shouting,  Green Day, Green Day, Green Day.
  He's gotta make up for it within a 30 second span.
  Yeah, and also the idea, there's not a,  I'm not gonna dox the man,  but there's not a straight shot from his place  to where we are on a freeway.
  So he's on surface streets.
  And this, for whatever reason, this type of year,  the San Fernando Valley has decided,  time to get some construction projects done.
  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
  And I'm checking that still now,  this is a very late mic, this is an extremely late mic.
  But it doesn't matter.
  Let's start talking about these old timey stores.
  There's one I'm gonna save for him  because he wanted to talk about it.
  I'm gonna wait.
  Oh, I don't know what that one is.
  I'll just sit here, I just won't do it for the time being.
  But what do we do in the meantime?  Let's, okay, so one thing, all right,  so here's a general thing to say about Main Street.
  You go there now and it almost feels like  just one big run of Disney Store, right?  Like there's separate store fronts,  but you kinda just walk through all of them  and there's subtle, like all right,  this one has more shirts and this one has more toys.
  And then there's ice cream and candy and whatever.
  But it definitely feels like,  it does not feel like 15 distinct businesses or anything.
  No, with some, with a rare exception of like,  okay, that's the coffee, the current coffee shop  and it's a Starbucks now.
  There's a jewelry and watch store.
  That does connect to the other stores,  but it's kind of on its own.
  Yeah, yeah.
  But besides that, yeah, it's just sort of like,  it's all places where you buy stuff  that is cute and Disney-ish, essentially.
  Not so much the case when it started,  because they knew they wanted this Main Street area  and they knew they wanted,  or we wanted to feel like an old timey town,  but then what is in these places?  I feel like they were starting to build the stores  and didn't know what was going to be in them.
  And then once built, what you ended up with  was a bunch of, was literally a bunch of different businesses  that were all often competing with each other  for business of the, like restaurants specifically.
  This was not a Main Street thing,  but there was a name that struck me a couple years ago  whenever it came up, that there used to be a restaurant  in Frontierland called Don DeFour's Silver Banjo Barbecue.
  And that you had to learn who's Don DeFour,  just a guy could have, and not a character.
  This isn't like, you know,  like Sleepy's Pillow Hut or whatever.
  Yeah.
  You're a real life man, Don DeFour.
  And like, because those individual businesses  made money separate from Disney,  they did, they had to compete against each other.
  So like, he was worried he was gonna lose people  to the chicken plantation  or whatever other old timey place there was.
  So he had to like start putting spotlights  on the restaurant.
  Like the park had to let him point a bunch of spotlights  at his own place, just to get people to come to his,  because it was kind of like tucked away and easy to miss.
  So this is an early thing about Disney  that I think is interesting,  that all the stores were fighting each other.
  Yeah, I think another distinct, and I hear keys,  could this be, nope.
  Nope, false alarm.
  Get in here.
  Oh, here he is.
  Go, and there you have it.
  Well, the walk of shame begins.
  Why does this have to be on video?  Why does this embarrass me?  You're not on video yet.
  You can collect yourself.
  The listeners have been watching an empty chair for.
  There's a stain on my shirt.
  It is such a shit show.
  In my life right now, everything's fine,  but it's such a shit show.
  If it makes you feel any better.
  Look at my, oh, I look awful.
  You look great.
  I'm so sorry to the listener.
  Sort of sorry to the listener who's just listening,  but there's video component, and I look like crap.
  Look at the video to see how crappy Mike looks.
  Look at this stain, look at this stain.
  What is it?  It's wet.
  Mike, if it makes you feel any better,  I have a small stain on my shirt,  because this is a real, I'll tell the story about this shirt.
  This is a real vintage Epcot shirt.
  I bought it March 10th, 2020.
  We had just recorded the Islands of Adventure  preview episode.
 What happened March 10th, 2020?  Oh, I went to a crowded Trader Joe's.
  Jason loves, you love any like,  and guess what the week was?  It may have been a March in a certain year.
  And I went to a very crowded Trader Joe's  to buy canned goods like a blizzard was coming.
  And sure enough.
  So you got a giant bean stain on your, what's the stain?  I bought a $2 vintage Epcot shirt at a Salvation for Me,  or some sort of thrift.
  There's gonna be a time when you're in like a kind of,  like a retirement home and you're gonna start,  you're gonna start like conflating that March week in 2020  with 9-Eleven.
  You're gonna be, you remember March 9-Eleven, 2020?  I bought a can and a shirt.
  A much more annoying Irishman hours.
  But hey, let's not dunk on me.
  Let's dunk on Mike a little more.
  This is an opportunity.
  It's not Jason, it's time to dunk on me.
  And I deserve it.
  I deserve it for the way I look on camera, first of all,  but also for my tardiness.
  Hey look, in the interest of solidarity, there.
  I just dumped water on myself.
  Now I am also stained like all of you.
  It's a clear stain, but you can kind of,  I am sopping wet.
  So if you feel more.
  Sparkling water.
  Noted for removing stains.
  No, Scott's making it better.
  Well.
  He's making his stains better.
  Preventing future stains is what it's doing.
  Well, I have nothing stain making on my person, so.
  You okay?  How you doing?  I'm all right.
  I'm a little stressed out.
  A little stressed out right now.
  We had the discussion of do you,  did you, we were like, well I hope he knows it's here too.
  Oh, I didn't know.
  Well, yes, you're right.
  You're correct that I assumed the opposite.
  So that was correct.
  But I did have a half second to double check that  before I left.
  And when all shit, it's farther.
  It's farther than we oftentimes report.
  You were slightly delayed because the iMessage  search feature is still this many years  and it's just absolute dog shit on Apple's part.
  I did look, because yeah, I don't want to get into  the weeds of how this organization runs.
  But.
  We did a little.
  You'll have to listen and find out.
  I will have to listen.
  So yeah, yeah.
  I did do a quick search.
  I definitely wrote it down wrong.
  Look, there's secret reasons that I can't reveal yet.
  What's going on in my life?  It's like Doughboys.
  Like Mitch, you're also in the Twisted Metal show.
  You can't talk about me yet.
  I am also, there's a new character they're adding.
  But it's so secret they can't talk about it.
  No, it is nothing a career, well I guess acting wise,  no, it's nothing like that.
  I forget, we were recording, right?  Yeah, I know you walked into it.
  We were recording for half an hour.
  Listen, we decided to live stream this.
  Everyone's watching it live too.
  Did you do any of the episode or did you just roast me?  We were just kind of getting into the generic stuff  about early Main Street and how they had to fill the space  and first to last year rent up front.
  We did discuss how even if you had a calendar alerts  correctly that it would get lost in an avalanche  of alerts for restaurants you don't like  and stores that have closed for good.
  Yes, that's true.
  And like two dollars off like a new Marvel legend alert.
  If there was a toy that was a slightly discounted toy,  I would be getting alerts and it would cover up  what I was supposed to be doing.
  Yes, that's true.
  So anyway, I am here.
  I mean, feel free to destroy me if you'd like.
  I do deserve it.
  I'll take my lashing.
  You already have the stain.
  You bear the scarlet letter that is the stain.
  Any idea what the stain's from?  I think it's just probably water.
  I think it might be gone already.
  Not mine.
  I poured a bunch on my, which is not visible  as far as I can tell.
  If you both want to throw water on me during the show,  I'll take that but there's equipment.
  I guess the equipment might be hurt by it.
  I don't want to mess up their equipment  and I would only do it to help people.
  I would only do it if there was an ice bucket challenge.
  Yeah, if there was some sort of charity events,  then yes, okay.
  Would it be a viable episode to go back and do  to just cover a bunch of people's ice bucket challenges?  Because it was a great thing that like hit everybody.
  Everyone did, lots of weirdos did  from Mike Love to George W.
 Bush.
  Yes, that's true.
  Everyone got to put their stamp on the ice bucket challenge.
  Every once in a while, I'll go back and like,  you know what I'm watching tonight?  Ice bucket challenges.
  Is that true?  Yeah, a little bit because I like the George W.
 Bush one  because Laura Bush has to act.
  One of the worst actors up for on the Earth.
  Oh sure, yeah.
  She's supposed to do it and then she comes in  with that smile of nervousness  when you've never been on camera before.
  And like, I didn't know how to do it.
  I didn't want to mess up my hair.
  I think that's viable.
  Mike Love does it.
  It's in a concert and it's such a gun point  and not understanding what it is.
  And then it is so sad when he challenges Mick Jagger  to do it because like, dude, Mick Jagger's not watching  one of your YouTube videos.
  And he didn't do it?  No, he, no, if Mick Jagger ever did an ice bucket challenge,  I don't think it was because of Mike Love's  challenge being issued.
  I see.
  Well, I felt like the celebrities were like doing that  in sort of conflict.
  There was some sort of plan, but maybe that's wrong.
  Maybe they just picked somebody they liked.
  I'm not sure.
  I think some of that, that's an interesting study  you could do if you were analyzing ice bucket challenges  is unanswered ice bucket challenges.
  Oh, that's a good idea.
  And ice bucket challenges outside of your league,  like reaching for somebody.
  Somebody too high up the tier.
  I know you're sort of famous,  but like Obama's not gonna do it because you said to do it.
  Who, Jamie Kennedy, I don't know who.
  So like if we had said like Pod Save America guys,  we challenge you, they're out of our league.
  So they would not have answered us  and it would have been embarrassing.
  Obviously, yeah.
  I mean, we'll get to their league someday.
  We're trying, but the more we're late  and the more we're, that's why, if for only that reason,  to just catch up to Pod Save.
  Sure.
  Yeah, we just need to vote a little harder.
  And then maybe they'll dump a little ice.
  Yeah.
  They'll finally answer our ice bucket challenge  seven years later.
  Here's what, but you know what?  This isn't about roasting and it's not about being mean  because we haven't really gotten to a specific location yet  in weird old Main Street bullshit.
  And we saved the one that you wanted to talk about,  which is the bank.
  We saved the bank for you.
  If we really were vindictive,  we wouldn't have let you talk about the bank.
  After all that, after half an hour,  all right, we're there everybody.
  The bank is what we're.
  I'm crying on the way over here.
  I wanna talk about the bank plate and get to the bank yet.
  I wanna talk about there's a bank on this.
  An actual bank, a functioning bank.
  Yeah, it's a functioning bank.
  Just a bank.
  And the first thing when you came in,  if you go into Disneyland now  and off to the right is the Disney Gallery  and maybe that corridor of bathrooms  are the first you use when you come in.
  But so Disneyland's here, you're in its Disneyland,  the realm of magic, here's a bank.
  Yes, it's like now, yeah.
  I like, I'm trying to think of what's better.
  I think it is better that you can buy a Mickey statue  where he's tugging on a firefighter's outfit  or something there now instead of it being a bank.
  But if I'm thinking about Disney as a real place,  I do really like the idea that there's just a bunch  of stupid daily tasks you could take care of on Main Street.
  So there's something fun about it.
  You would have liked to,  you might have saved banking to do.
  100% I would have saved banking for Main Street.
  Don't you think you would have done it?  We would have done a little bit,  these two, we're the first guys to ever think of this  10 years ago, been like,  you wanna go down and make a deposit?  And be like, yeah, Jason and I would have two envelopes  full of cash that we were gonna deposit at Disneyland.
  And be like, this is how we do all of our banking.
  We would have absolutely done that if it was still there  when we first started going to Disneyland.
  Because again, I do wanna emphasize  that it's an actual bank.
  Because some of the places were simulations of business.
  It weren't actually their businesses.
  Or like, I bet there's people in Florida.
  Because Florida still is a barber shop.
  Really?  Yes, right, right.
  A functioning barber shop.
  You can get your haircut on Main Street?  You can get your haircut on Main Street.
  I have heard some people like,  oh, it's time for baby's first haircut.
  We're getting it done on Main Street at the Magic Kingdom.
  Oh, because they're happy to be at Disney World.
  It's like a first thing, it's a first time, yeah.
  Yeah, and I'm sure there's Orlando locals  who it's like, time for a haircut.
  I'm gonna make a reservation and make a park reservation  to get a haircut on Main Street.
  Would you not do that?  I would also do it.
  I would probably do that if I was close by.
  Not every time.
  If there was a Disneyland haircut,  I would have tried it probably by now, at least once.
  I wouldn't have, and I'll tell you why.
  Because it would suck and cost $250.
  Well, it would suck, because it's $250,  but don't you think they'd have some sort of whimsical  80-year-old man who's cutting  and he's gonna give you the hot shave?  It's like, why don't you do it once?  You do it in.
.
.
  One time.
  You're in the window on Main Street  and you're kind of a display, you're kind of an attraction.
  Oh, they make you a little show.
  Yeah, yeah, I suppose so.
  Maybe once you would do it?  Yeah, I would consider doing it next time  I was in the Magic Kingdom.
  Well, yeah, well, you got it now.
  Well, now we have to do it.
  Now all three of us have to do it.
  Ideally, at the same time in chairs next to each other.
  Oh, can they do that?  I don't know.
  Is it like a sport clips?  Is it like multiple chairs?  I was picturing the old couple, well, like one or two.
  I feel like there's two chairs, probably.
  Okay, can they do colors?  I don't know they do dye jobs.
  I'll dye my hair on Main Street.
  I've never dyed my hair before,  but I will dye my hair on Main Street.
  In an old timey barber shop, you're gonna go bright blue.
  I wanna get as much as you can get there.
  Hmm.
  I don't know if he has blue.
  Well, I don't know.
  That feels like that would take a long time to color.
  Because if you're going different colors,  I think you have to bleach,  and then it would have to dye it yellow and then go blue.
  And you're on vacation also,  so now you're using hours for this haircut.
  But it's content for us.
  That's true, yeah, yeah, yeah.
  Do they have the menu, what you can do?  You gotta get your eyebrows removed.
  All of your arm hair.
  I wanna see if there's like a menu.
  How much hair will they touch?  Yeah.
  Now I'm wondering, have they relegated this to the app too?  Is this now like, in theory, simpler,  but more of a pain in the ass?  Because you can't specify,  you can't talk to a human over the phone.
  Yeah, that's a good question.
  Child, okay, services available, child haircut,  my first haircut, adult haircut, beard trim.
  So they're not gonna color your hair there.
  I don't think so.
  They're probably not gonna shave you either.
  Well, the beard trim, yeah,  you're not getting the warm razor out.
  No, but I'll get an adult haircut.
  It doesn't, starting at $21.
  Cheaper than Floyd's, cheaper than local chain Floyd.
  Not so bad.
  I guess I may.
  Yes, you have to do it.
  Well, let's see how those hidden fees stack up.
  Aren't you suspicious of this?  At current Disney World, a service that in the real world  is usually much more expensive,  is $21.
  Do you, yeah, $21 gets you the high and tight  or gets it shaved all the way off?  Sorry, that's the price.
  $21 is the cost for a haircut.
  We cut one hair.
  Do you want us to cut the others?  That's just the going through the door fee is $21.
  One hair, I cut one hair, that's a dollar.
  Another hair, yet another dollar.
  And like Mickey's just got a calculator next to him  and it's like, $1, $2?  You have 1,000 hairs.
  Shapek approves of this, not just because of  all the hidden fees, but because he's like,  hey, make haircuts as expensive as you want.
  Not a problem for me.
  That is gonna, that will,  that is definitely on his to-do list.
  He's got like a big board.
  It's like, he says like, evil board or something.
  And it's like, make haircuts cost at least $500.
  What is left to make more expensive?  All right, charge per brick that you step on.
  That's the new Disney and Magic ankle bands.
  We track, it's a fun thing where we track  every step that you take in the park.
  And it helps with fitness and you get a little sticker  at the end and Goofy says, good job.
  And yes, then we charge you for all the wear and tear  that you put on bricks and cement in our park.
  We're helping your heart, so pay us.
  Or pay us for your heart help.
  But yeah, so they had a bank.
  They had a bank.
  I like more mundane stuff.
  I like, I would like more of it is what I'm saying.
  I would like more things like that available.
  I know they did have it, obviously.
  We're talking about that.
  Well, you say it's mundane, but here,  like here's a description I read of what you could do there.
  You know, there's a vault.
  You pass by the vault that is holding money and documents.
  And then the branch manager, Leo Wagman,  sits in a nearby armchair behind a roll-top desk,  nodding and smiling at the visitors.
  So you come back from Disneyland.
  How was Walt Disney's Disneyland?  It was great.
  I saw Leo Wagman.
  Who's that?  Is that a character from a movie?  No, he's a guy at a bank.
  You know, like a fun movie about a bank  or like the Mary Poppins bank.
  Mary Poppins bank guy?  No, bank guy.
  He's a real branch manager for Bank of America.
  This guy is a famous Disneyland character, though.
  Now, I mean, we're getting him out here now.
  Yeah, we're getting the word out about Leo Wagman.
  Leo Wagman.
  Some of my information today came from a really strange book  that I think is called like Fifty Fivers or Class of 55,  something my parents gave me for Christmas one year.
  It is a book that tracks every single human being  who worked at Disneyland in the first year.
  Wow.
  Wow.
  And like, then you read, like they tracked them all down.
  There's at least a little information.
  Like this, he's from Fullerton,  but then he died in La Palma.
  The stories are not magical.
  They aren't interesting.
  It's just like, here's people.
  Do they claim to have everyone?  Yeah, and there's, I mean, there's hundreds of little.
  Sure.
  Is Leo in there?  Yeah, yeah.
  There's an entire, like I don't have it with me.
  There's a whole separate, besides what I just read,  there's a separate Leo Wagman section  where you find out where he was born and I assume died.
  Wow, has anybody here ever known the name of a bank employee  that they would go to a lot?  No.
  Like they might've like thought I did  if I went more than once, but I didn't remember their name.
  Did everyone go to the bank as like children  to open up your first savings account?  And like, it was a big deal  because you sat at the desk with your parent?  I did not have that.
  You never did that, Jason?  I think, yeah, I did something like that.
  I mean, we had the like, the bank was next to the post office  and they were both across the street from the high school.
  Right, and you got like a little book  because it was 100 years ago when we were children.
  Yeah, yeah.
  You know what I'm realizing now  is that I'm potentially introducing  a new second gate character  because I believe I got a mascot character for our bank,  the Harris Lion.
  Oh.
  I believe I had a plush.
  Let me look him up.
  You got any info on Harris Lion?  Is the Harris Lion cute?  Let's see, he for sure is cute.
  There's no doubt about it.
  But that's like more of a Midwest, I think I've got bought.
  Yeah, I got bought by BMO, BMO Harris.
  BMO Lion? But they kept Harris?  I guess so.
  BMO, Harris Bank, here he is with a bull's jersey.
  I mean, he's not the cutest, I'll be honest.
  No, no, not really.
  I like him.
  He's not not cute.
  Yeah.
  Oh yeah, there's this bank.
  I mean, I've had this bank as well.
  A bank, you mean a piggy bank?  A literal bank, yeah.
  A lion bank.
  That does look familiar.
  So this is a new guy, Harris.
  Oh, that's fun.
  I'll do this, hold up to the.
.
.
  There you go.
  Mike is now here to show you banks,  a little bank that he had.
  And hopefully, my biggest fear during that  was that something that's happening right now,  I wasn't gonna get a bunch of panic text messages  and show those to the camera.
  But luckily those came before and will come after.
  That's another thing.
  No, you have full transparency to the listener.
  I guess that's the bank.
  So you got to do it.
  The vault is still there.
  Did you say that?  No, no.
  The vault is still there and it's still being used  to house very expensive things you can buy  from the Disney gallery.
  Oh yeah, there is that little nook.
  And it's big, it's a big, thick bank vault door,  which I never questioned what it was.
  I thought it was just theming.
  And I was like, oh, that's fun.
  They made a vault for the special things.
  But I've walked by there before and they had a full.
.
.
  It wasn't on an animatronic,  but it was like a recreation of the guy  in the haunted mansion with the dog.
  Sometimes it's just like some sort of statue.
  Sometimes it's like a one of a kind artifact.
  And sometimes it looks like it's just a picture in there  and you're like, well, that's not as.
.
.
  This feels like it should be some crazy expensive thing.
  But sometimes maybe they.
.
.
  Or people's actual financial information,  which is what used to be in there.
  Yeah, sometimes it should just be like ledgers,  bank ledgers and withdrawals and deposits.
  And yeah, I mean, that's gotta be in there somewhere, right?  Maybe it doesn't.
  Like in the wall somewhere.
  But there weren't safe deposit boxes there.
  No.
  That would have been amazing.
  You couldn't do your escrow services.
  You couldn't do that.
  Right.
  These surfing bank robbers from Point Break  did not try to heist the Disney World Bank.
  But what a great novel for your new novel series.
  Oh, yeah.
  Bodhi is back.
  He did not totally eat shit at the end of the movie  and die in the big wave.
  Jason Sheridan presents The Main Street Files.
  Disneyland, it's a Disneyland meets Point Break adventure.
  Yeah, it's Disneyland meets Point Break.
  They're 70 page paperback novels that Jason writes.
  They're like those series of the guy  with the adventures at Main Street.
  The Main Street Files.
  You could write one of those.
  For our patron, Jason's gonna say  he's gonna write a 70 page novel for the highest tier.
  When did I say that?  Just now in my imagination.
  Oh, okay.
  Yeah, on the car ride over,  did you have a conversation with me?  Do I just appear when you're running late?  You are like my great kazoo.
  You show up all the time in my life.
  It's not 11, dumb dumb.
  It's not the right time, dumb dumb.
  Also, I'm going to write a novel.
  There's a weird video of Jordan Peterson going around  where he's in the scare, he's in like a Jack Skellington suit  and he's doing this odd screed about.
  Oh, Elliot Page?  Yeah, yeah, but the only part I saw is this weird like,  we'll see who gets canceled.
  Yes, that's it.
  I was like, this is like great kazoo a little bit.
  He's like a big tall great kazoo.
  He's like, yeah, so long, woke mob.
  I forget what he says.
  Woke moralist, you dumb morales.
  You dumb.
  Yes, it's lit because he's joining Ben Shapiro's  Daily Wire now as a contributor.
  Same family as Gina Carano's movie.
  That's right.
  All the best content.
  Terror on the Prairie, which as somebody pointed out,  sounds like a 30 Rock fake movie.
  Yeah, so they've shot a video.
  I don't know, I was just like,  do we have to explain to this guy  in the middle of Main Street?  Jordan Peterson is like an annoying guy  who's like mad at trans people and always crying.
  And like trying to get kicked off Twitter.
  And yeah, he said something derogatory about Elliot Page  and then Twitter kicked him off.
  And now they made a little super villain video of him  for Daily Wire.
  He came back.
  We'll see who cancels who.
  We'll see who cancels.
  He says like, we'll see how,  yeah, like it's a weird, did somebody write it?  Did the writer of Terror on the Prairie  write this little monologue?  He came back after attempting,  his daughter tried to get him to eat an all meat diet.
  And then he was addicted to Benzos.
  And then I think she took him to like a weird  stay in rehab in Russia or somewhere in far Eastern Europe.
  And somehow came back.
  Somehow he's doing the rounds again.
  And there was like the most fragile person.
  Yes.
  Why are we talking about this guy now?  Hold on, hold on.
  We can stop.
  Keep talking.
  I'm sorry, this guy is insane.
  He's a crazy, like he was mad.
  Clock's ticking.
  When the, all right.
  It's 11.
33 right now.
  No more, 11.
34, we're done.
  He was mad about like the Sports Illustrated cover.
  The woman didn't look like a woman  from the 90s on the cover.
  And he was like, you're not fooling me with this.
  I won't be tricked.
  This woman is not the same weight as the woman in the 90s.
  And people were like, what's wrong with you?  Well, and what's important is that anytime this guy  farts anything out of his mouth hole,  that we, Twitter needs to make it be trending.
  Well, that's an issue.
  There is no other choice.
  We're trending it now, but it is like,  dude, what's wrong with you?  This gaunt crying man who clearly has consumption  has some thoughts, has some thoughts on light year.
  And Jason summed it up.
  All right, so the door slammed, vault door slammed.
  We're shoving Jordan in there.
  You brought up heists.
  There was a heist on Main Street.
  I'm gonna dive into that story.
  Oh yeah.
  Yeah, you ran into this at the restaurant,  the Red Wagon Inn.
  This is now the Plaza Inn, I believe,  down at the end of Main Street.
  And there was a heist there of some kind in 1960.
  It's a really weird story where a guy at the restaurant  was taking, he was moving money from one place to,  from the back of the restaurant  to technically the backstage.
  And then a guy came out, he felt something against his side  and uh-oh, and he had to give the guy  the full $10,000 that he had,  which seems like that's a lot of money  for a Disney restaurant to be moving.
  And that was, so this became a matter  for the Anaheim police and they're like,  and there was, somebody had a gun in Disneyland  and this all, this seems weird and it's a lot of money.
  So they talked to the employee again.
  Two days later, he failed a lie detector test,  confessed and showed the police where in,  they did the women's locker room.
  He hid most of $10,000 and returned it.
  Why would he hide it there?  They'd never, why would a man be in the woman's room?  It's the perfect crime.
  Yeah.
 Yeah, geez.
  He just lied.
  Only in Jordan Peterson's America.
  I didn't say it, I didn't say it.
  Doesn't mean we have to keep talking, let's go, all right,  quick.
  But yeah, it's like, I would think if you would  steal a bunch of money, you'd try to not keep it  within 50 feet of, like, try to get it out of there.
  Yeah, really strange story.
  And the idea that like, I don't know,  I don't think we had metal detectors at that point,  but I also don't think people were bringing guns  to Disneyland.
  Yeah, right.
  I don't think.
  It just seems like this was maybe a plan  that wasn't well thought out.
  Yeah, yeah.
  This was a very, this was the William H.
 Macy of his day.
  Oh yeah.
  Immediately.
  Usually.
  I told you the story, what do you want?  If you're gonna heist like $10,000 like that,  which is probably worth like 10 times as much in 2022 dollars.
  But usually you don't just have one doofus who lies  and is very bad at lying.
  Yeah, and his plan was like, himself on like,  I'll be good, I can handle this.
  Me, a like, assistant manager at a theme park restaurant,  I mean, I can hold up to the police for more than two days.
  Oh God, no, I'm sorry, you're dang it.
  Come to the women's room with me.
  That's like the three of us are probably,  if we were little and we took like an extra piece  of candy, we would have like within an hour  of been like crying and be like,  well you have to confess something, mommy.
  I ate an extra piece of candy after dinner.
  100%.
  Yeah.
  I lied about something.
  Three big bucklers.
  At the time, three little bucklers.
  That's what we'll call ourselves from now on  because we're not three childless men in our 30s anymore.
  Three little bucklers.
  That could replace Cliffords too potentially.
  The list, we can't put this on the listeners.
  The listeners are bucklers for sure.
  If they listen to us.
  This is unfair, we've already put on them  that they're like the creepy little Martin Short character.
  You Cliffords, you're also bucklers.
  They also would not hold up against police  or parent scrutiny over a piece of candy.
  Let's ask them.
  Hey, tweet at us if you're a little buckler,  a nasty little coward with no integrity.
  I'm glad you're in the main video  to seek for that, for asking that question.
  Well, I mean, what a boy.
  I mean, if they truly are bucklers,  they'll buckle because you asked that.
  A nasty little coward.
  Yes, I am, sir.
  The podcast I listen to yelled at me, I buckled.
  I think we got a lot of bucklers in the audience.
  I think we have a lot of people  who could easily give us wedgies too.
  Yeah, I know.
  You come in late and then you insult,  then you say that everybody,  our whole audience is gonna buckle.
  Who is this Mike?  I don't know.
  I'm not sorry though, I'll tell you that.
  I'm not sorry for what I said.
  I'm like Jordan Pierce.
  You won't cancel me.
  You won't get an apology from me.
  You won't cancel me for calling you bucklers.
  That's right, bucklers.
  We'll see you buckles against you.
  No.
  I regret nothing.
  Here's some other things I have to say  about the Red Wagon Inn.
  This is my intro that you missed.
  It was, mainly what we did was laugh  at my opening joke for 10 minutes,  but I said that there were a lot of,  you know, like weird meats come up on the show  and it's gonna happen here  because it's original Disneyland.
  Kids menu at the Red Wagon Restaurant.
  A couple odd things going on.
  This was a Yesterland poll.
  Why Red Wagon Restaurant serves  genuine Swift's meat for babies.
  For 25 cents a can, choose from strained beef,  strained veal, chopped beef, and chopped veal.
  Swift's is the foremost name in meat for babies.
  100% meat.
  Now, Scott, you got a two year old.
  What is his favorite chopped or strained meat?  And do you buy Swift's?  It's so frustrating that it's not easier  to find strained veal.
  It's been my biggest complaint since becoming a parent.
  Where's all that used to be on every street corner?  I took them to Disneyland.
  Where's your veal?  It can be strained or chopped.
  Will it slide?  He prefers chopped, but you can strain it.
  You know, a fun fact that Mike found out in the app,  you can order, you know, a kid's meal of strained meats.
  You don't have to have a kid.
  You can just do it in the app  and it'll be ready at mobile pickup.
  And can you get it a little cheaper  if you say doesn't have to be 100% meat?  Yeah, yeah.
  But that's a.
.
.
  A couple cents off.
  They can't do that in an app though.
  You gotta ask.
  Yeah, you gotta stand in line to get it a la carte  or to get a little more filler, a little more sawdust.
  Veal.
  I want the, I'm here for, I need the baby veal,  but it doesn't have to be all veal.
  Meat for babies is also just.
.
.
  Really disturbing, Nate.
  I guess babies have meat.
  Sure.
  Mine doesn't so much.
  Not a lot.
  You don't need a lot of meat.
  No, I don't think so.
  You certainly don't need veal for babies.
  No, that's what's, and veal is babies.
  It's babies eating babies.
  Oh yeah.
  This is the world that Walt wanted in the food.
  This is what he was trying to.
.
.
  I wanna look down the street  and see nothing but babies eating babies.
  There was a whole wonderful world of Disney  about babies eating veal.
  He was presenting that to the American public.
  The most beautiful American sights there is.
  Jason, did you eat veal when you were a little baby?  No, I don't think so.
  I don't think as a baby.
  I've never had veal.
  Really?  Yeah, I still don't, no, yeah, I wouldn't.
  I feel like chicken Parmesan and veal Parmesan  are just kind of standards at like where I grew up.
  When was the last time you ate veal?  I don't know, a few years ago?  Veal piccata maybe?  Never.
  No?  I don't even know that it's been offered to me.
  Like I don't even know that I've seen it on a menu.
  You must have been in a restaurant with veal.
  Probably.
  I think so.
  It just wasn't, nobody offered it out loud.
  Nobody pushed it on me.
  Can we make you buckle?  We know that stain is veal.
  Buckle now.
  I was eating a little jar of baby veal,  of baby food veal on the way over here  because I haven't eaten in days  and that was the close.
  That was.
  Lap, lap, lap, lap with your tongue.
  The closest store was a baby food store  and I just grabbed stuff off the shelf  and I was just shoveling baby food veal into my stomach  and yeah, I got some veal juice on my shirt.
  The cans are mostly juice, you gotta get them.
  Yeah, because it can't be big pieces for baby.
  Yeah.
  Yeah, baby needs.
  You put juice in the bottle.
  Baby needs juice.
  My baby needs juice.
  Baby.
  We're bottle feeding him.
  Veal juice.
  Veal juice, of course.
  No formula, no breast milk.
  No, the formula shortage has not affected us at all.
  Well, that's because we mainly give him veal juice.
  Veal juice.
  No, not beetle juice.
  No.
  Well, you also, then you'd have your,  you'd give baby strained veal  and then they'd wash it down with buttermilk.
  It's just weird this time.
  What was going on?  And then also, and then just past that,  then there's a full, okay, there's a page from,  they don't call it the kids menu,  they call it the menu for young Americans.
  And then there's only five items on it  or types of meals you can order.
  Two of them are problematic.
  I'm not gonna say those out loud.
  Oh no.
  Two of them in various ways are characters  who are problematic.
  Oh, got it, got it.
  And then one of them is,  this, you know, like one meal is just the Casey Jr.
  And then that's unrelated.
  It's a sirloin patty.
  But then one is Danny.
  And it's a little happy black sheep,  or a black lamb, I guess, from So Dear to My Heart,  the 40s Disney movies, So Dear to My Heart.
  And he looks so eager and happy  and like he's gonna go run and play.
  And then his meal is broiled lamb chop.
  It's like clucking chicken.
  It's like a Saturday Night Live sketch.
  Yes.
  Weird.
  Like have lamb chop, sure.
  But why put this, like we have one lamb character  in the entire lineup and we're gonna have him.
  That's a decades long trend, I think,  that maybe around the time of that clucking chicken sketch,  people were like, wait a minute.
  Didn't wanna think about the face of what they're eating.
  Yeah, it was like, oh yeah,  we'll have a cute picture of the thing you're eating.
  And finally, after decades, people were like,  well, maybe that's a little weird.
  Maybe that, people don't wanna see that.
  Yeah, and why have that when one of them is chopped meat  and then a side of jello represented by a smiling train?  What was the smell back then in these places,  just like everyone eating the most meat possible,  just like churning out meat in the kitchen?  I mean, I guess it probably wasn't that insane, but.
  Well, I have that question in general because there's,  well, there's not only that,  it's all meat and buttermilk everywhere,  but then also to transition  into the other smell making materials,  there's a tobacco store.
  The tobacco is.
  Right, you're just buying tobacco.
  And everyone's farting too.
  So I think we've talked about  how much farting was going on back then.
  No, we must've discussed the degree of fart in the air  at early Disney Land.
  Because everyone's eating heavy meat for every meal,  smoking like a chimney,  and that gas has to come out.
  And I don't even think we've answered the question of how,  people didn't just let it rip in the 1950s or 60s, did they?  Or would they say, well, excuse me after they did it?  If they were in line for the train, would you fart  or would you have to squeeze it out?  What would it be?  What was the protocol back then?  Obviously it's not.
  Was everyone just wearing so much wool material?  Did it just get absorbed?  It would muffle it.
  It would muffle it.
  That's why you dressed that way.
  It was soundproofing.
  Yeah.
  Yeah, yeah, it was such a thick material  that you just hear like,  it wasn't like that far.
  It would bounce off though.
  It's as much as two hands rubbing against each other.
  That's what it ends up sounding like.
  Right, so you just hear that constantly.
  And then this.
  I'll say, just an unsettling little shuffle.
  And then just the worst smell imaginable.
  But you were used to it  because that's what everyone smelled like.
  Well, no, but just the smell is muffled  by everyone's nasty hair products and pomade  and unfiltered lucky strikes.
  So you're saying a meat fart in the 1950  was a better smell than just what was going on.
  It would be overpowered by everything else.
  Yeah.
  Okay, that makes sense, honestly.
  There were so many other smells going on.
  It wasn't even a big deal.
  And also, I mean, a lot of plastics nowadays still stink.
  Early plastic, first few decades of plastics  probably smelled atrocious.
  Maybe, yeah.
  Interesting.
  Well, but the tobacconist didn't help.
  It's the time more than anything.
  I'm not like, this wasn't perverse, I don't think,  for Disney to have a tobacco store.
  But it's just weird that now you can't even smoke  in the parks in any way.
  Right.
  But at the time, it's cigarettes, cigars, pipe tobacco.
  You just buy them on Main Street, walk right out,  and start smoking, probably on the rides.
  On the rides, which is what I've said many times,  that I don't wanna smoke cigarettes,  but I will smoke a cigarette on Pirates of the Caribbean  if I was allowed.
  Oh, yeah.
  Well, I realized a couple times recently,  I had the thought, like, oh, I have never smoked  inside a U.
S.
 Disney park, and I guess I never  will have that option, because it's now a smoking,  smoking areas outside.
  Yeah, when did they get rid of the inside the park  smoking areas?  It was more recent than you'd think.
  I think it was like 2019.
  Because we went with a friend of ours.
  Some article said like.
  In the last decade, and he smoked.
  All right, Disneyland has ceased having indoor smoking  in the year 2000.
  It's like, oh no, that is much later than you would think.
  Yeah, well, that's when it all changed, I guess.
  Late 90s, too, yeah.
  But yay.
  So out of step, I guess.
  You could get your hair cut and smoke a cigarette  in Disney World in 2000.
  And if certain products were blown into your hair,  it would light your hair on fire.
  That's true.
  Yeah, is that blue sanitizing liquid  that they keep combs in, is that flammable?  Barbasol?  Seems possible.
  Isn't there a light alcohol component to that?  Yeah, I think so.
  No, Barbasol is the shaving cream.
  It is something close to Barbasol, I think.
  Are you sure?  I think so.
  I mean, Barbasol could also just make that, I don't know.
  Hmm, let me look.
  Barbasol is a thing.
  Everyone here be quiet while I do this.
  That's right.
  We'll wait.
  Barbaside.
 Barbaside.
  Barbaside, that's it.
 Barbaside.
  Yes, I apologize to the listener.
  Barbaside is blue and yes, alcoholic  because it's killing germs.
  Here's, there's not a lot of photos of the tobacco store  and not a ton of information about it.
  But I found a photo from the front door  and the front door had a little poem on it.
  And just, okay, you'll be able to tell with my voice  where the text goes from just black italics  to all caps red.
  I think I'll be able to signal it.
  So this is what, if you want to buy a pipe at Disneyland,  here's what you read at the door.
  Tobacco is a dirty weed.
  It satisfies no normal need.
  It makes you thin.
  It makes you lean.
  It's the worst darn stuff you've ever seen.
  I like it.
  That's what, look at this.
  Look at this.
  Wait, there's for the listener.
  There's the watcher.
  I like it.
  I like it.
  What is this?  This wasn't Disneyland.
  Wild thing to put in there.
  This I would buy.
  I would love to own this sign.
  John Stamos probably paid like 200,000 for that.
  Yeah.
  Bastard.
  I mean, it's funny to look at nowadays,  not just because they don't let Nick Fury  have a big cigar in the Avengers movies  or the really insane detail of,  yeah, there's photos in Carthay Circle  where it just looks like Walt's pointing at stuff  because they Photoshopped the cigarette out of his hand.
  And let's not forget Krusty the Clown toy  is not allowed to have a cigarette.
  These things you both have said  are like five-timers clubs in the last six weeks.
  Yes, for sure.
  Well, stay tuned, folks.
  This is the third time for this.
  There's more cigarette content coming.
  That's right, that's right.
  That's true.
  But I think it's weird to look at the tobaccoist  because I feel like Disney, Main Street,  they have removed anything that's potentially objectionable.
  Like the candle shop they wouldn't have on Main Street now  because a child could like,  can't let the idea of children being by flame.
  So much is so like, well, you can't have that  because a child could use that  to stab themselves in the arm.
  Yes, yeah, yeah.
  But this is acknowledging that it's like bad.
  Oh, yeah.
  Like this is basically saying like  sometimes it's good to be bad.
  Oh, that little poem?  Yeah, yeah.
  It's saying it's bad,  but it's also saying smoke them if you got them.
  Yeah, yeah.
  Well, it feels like it's like a mockery  of somebody who likes poems  might think this stupid thought.
  Right.
  But me, I say, I like it.
  Isn't it absurd?  I like it.
  Yeah, who wrote it?  Yeah, no, it's not attributed to anyone.
  Did Walt just compose it one day?  He started talking like, you there, take a note.
  We're putting this up on the side of the wall  or is it a fame?  Maybe it's a famous thing we don't know about.
  Well, I know some of the,  I think I was saying for, if you got here,  that they asked for,  they would say to get businesses to be on Main Street,  we're gonna build a building, okay?  We're gonna take care of the decoration of the outside.
  You have to do the inside or we can help you.
  But yeah, who knows if that was  whoever was running the tobaccoist  or if that was like Disney's little touch.
  It's outside, so I guess it would be Disney.
  You would think so.
  Yeah.
  You know what else he said before you got here?  You stink.
  Jason said it.
  Roll the tape back.
  He wouldn't stop saying it.
  Jason said that?  We have to change the topic.
  Just because he's not here doesn't mean.
  I bet he's gonna come,  that stinker's gonna come in with a stain on his shirt.
  Because he was eating meat and smoking  and going back in the car.
  He was smoking.
  He's stressed out so he's just chain smoking  in the car on the way over here.
  He was pounding his Virginia Slims.
  He was sipping a Nalgene bottle of veal juice.
  He's a stinker and a buckler.
  Let the record show.
  There's a lot of ways to describe me.
  And I accept all of them.
  A stinkler, a buckler.
  Put that on a shirt, folks.
  A Clifford, a stinker, a buckler.
  I like it.
  And I like it.
  I'm kind of mentally going from least weird to weird.
  This isn't that weird to me.
  But we've talked about it.
  I feel like, Mike, you've noted the oddity of this,  that there is a Wurlitzer store.
  It was a piano and organ location.
  Right.
  This doesn't make any sense for Disneyland to have this.
  But it is cool.
  Yes, definitely.
  Well, because that's what I,  so I was like,  I was like,  do you, could you buy a piano at Disneyland?  And then they gotta load it into your car?  Like you can, you just see people moving pianos  down Main Street?  Yeah.
  But no.
  Yeah, it wasn't,  because there's no room to hold house,  like a piano warehouse.
  Yeah, yeah.
  Probably not more than a couple pianos.
  So I just happened to come across this,  right when we started talking about this episode.
  Twitter user, at MysticFlights,  who I believe is an artist  who has worked for Disney Imagineering before,  posted a postcard of the Wurlitzer store.
  And on the back, it says,  Wurlitzer, the name that means music in Disneyland,  proudly represents the entire music industry  in the fabulous spectacle.
  The Wurlitzer exhibit is located  on the quarter of Main Street USA and Disneyland.
  And then it says,  you're cordially invited to visit our store today.
  And see here play Wurlitzer pianos from 495 up.
  So they've priced it out, by the way,  with the inflation calculation, $495 in 1955,  is worth $5,398.
75 today.
  It's a pricey purchase.
  Yeah, so it's like go to Disneyland and stop in,  order a Mac Pro and a Retina monitor.
  Well, it's the price of that Star Wars drink  on the new cruise ship.
  Yes, which is like multiple cocktails,  a shot of Pappy Van Winkle bourbon,  which is very expensive on its own.
  And a trip to Skywalker Ranch.
  A ticket to get into Skywalker Ranch  comes with a special $5,000 drink on the Disney Wish.
  Oh, so it's not icy.
  A bottle of Lucas Fincher's sparkling wine  sent to your hotel room.
  So it's more like another trip.
  A free cameo from George Lucas.
  Yeah.
  He'll whisper what his episode seven through nine  were gonna be.
  That's right.
  All about what the Wills were gonna do.
  Let's talk about the Wills, yeah.
  So, yes.
  There's Wills in this drink.
  It's a shot of Pappy but infused with Wills.
  So they do high ticket, high price items sometimes at Disney.
  What is the most expensive like souvenir  you can get from Disney right now, I wonder?  Oh, is it in the vault?  Maybe it's in the vault.
  It's in the vault.
  I mean, there was a bunch of like $500 Marvel statues.
  That's up there.
  That we've looked out before.
  I think that's up there.
  It's gonna be something.
  But there's pieces of art in there  that I'm sure are more expensive and stuff.
  Yeah, Giggly Prince, is that the term?  Oh, G-I-C-L-E-E?  Yeah.
  Or how do you know how to,  I don't know how that is pronounced.
  You might be right.
  I don't know how it's pronounced, yeah.
  So yeah, you could get a piano.
  Yeah, I think though it was mainly about,  in that way that we found with City Walk  that it's less about they make a lot of money  at this location.
  To advertise.
  And more about getting the word at, yeah, yeah.
  So I think it was more about,  I think they would even give you information  about where to get pianos and organs closer to you.
  Right.
  But they also, they did organ concerts every night.
  Like a guy would sit and demonstrate,  and they'd patch it into all of the Main Street speakers.
  So I didn't know that, that in the early years,  at five o'clock, there'd be an organ concert of Disneyland.
  Yeah, that's cool.
  Of instrumentals of Disney songs.
  It's competing with the lowering of the flag.
  They're playing taps.
  And someone else is playing an old time rag.
  20 feet away.
  Scott Joplin playing.
  So that, yeah, that was organ music,  which is much more like a baseball game.
  Yeah, there was a guy who used to play organ  at Disneyland every day,  and then he left that to play organ for the Dodgers,  in fact.
  There you go.
  And then now it's just, now there'll still be a person  that plays the piano over by the hot dog store.
  Yes, there's that, yeah.
  So you still got a little of that old time feel.
  I just love the hubris of like,  we're like, sir, we represent the entire music industry.
  Sure.
  They made a deal with Walt to be presented that way.
  Well, that's what a lot of these things were about,  and it's a lot of why these places were there,  is they were flexes, they were flexes of your business  and of your Walt relationship.
  And due to Walt's friendship with a particular CEO,  you ended up with a pharmacy in Disneyland,  the Upajohn Pharmacy.
  Walt and this guy were smoke tree ranch guys together.
  Of course.
  At the famous ranch where they're building Cotino now.
  Of course.
  We all knew about smoke tree ranch  before a couple months ago.
  No, smoke tree ranch's still going.
  Cotino is inspired by the league.
  It's not the same place.
  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
  He liked the Palm Desert in general.
  Can we become smoke tree ranch guys  if it's still around?  Or is that like a rich person's club?  I think it is a rich person.
  I think there are vacation rentals or stuff.
  Yeah, I don't think it's the most,  I don't remember the nature of the property.
  But to become smoke tree ranch guys,  do we have to have a membership  or can we just go there once and call ourselves that?  We should look into that.
  Look into it.
  We'll hang at smoke tree ranch.
  Yeah.
  In an episode on location.
  So this place, the Upjohn Pharmacy,  this is one, I was probably initially glossing this over  as like, that doesn't seem like anything,  but Jason, we found the same thing.
  This place is weird.
  So much detail, there's so much on,  specifically there's one mouse planet article  called the story of the Upjohn Pharmacy at Disneyland.
  And it is so detailed both because people still had  the pamphlets they would give out.
  And there's also like the internal Upjohn newsletters,  like reproduced, which sounds like,  it doesn't sound like a human being really.
  So like, we are not in the entertainment business.
  As you know, we are in the pharmacy business.
  But this is a chance of solid,  interesting advertising opportunities.
  And it's like, all right,  don't have too much fun there, buddy.
  You want a pharmacy copy to be fun.
  Yeah.
  Pills, pills, pills.
  Get them now.
  Hey, they literally say at some point,  it's like, I know this may seem weird.
  This might be totes random, but  we're gonna do a pharmacy and a theme park.
  This was like, but the main feature of it  was that it was a turn of the century,  a recreation of a turn of the century pharmacy  with old turn of the century stuff.
  So you got to see old syringes.
  Yes.
 Yay.
  It was like, it was kind of like,  it's a wonderful life pharmacy thing.
  Remember he's like delivering the medicine or something.
  Yeah, he delivers medicine and then  the pharmacist like smacks his pad here.
  Oh yeah, that's right.
  The pharmacist hits him in the head  and it's a wonderful life.
  So I don't think that would happen.
  Bailey is like, you filled those capsules with poison.
  Right.
  I know you didn't mean it.
  Oh, because the pharmacist is losing his mind.
  Well, yeah, because he's drunk himself into a stupor  because his son died.
  Yes, that's right.
  Jason knows this movie very well.
  I do know.
  Then what happens?  Well, in the alternate universe  where George Bailey is not born,  he's not there to stop the pharmacist  from poisoning a child with pills.
  Yes, that's right.
  We were living in it's a wonderful life  for a minute of what if Mike was never born?  I know.
  If Mike wasn't on the show.
  And thank God it was short  because what a nightmare.
  What a nightmare for somebody.
  There wouldn't have been that tangent about it.
  It's a wonderful life if I wasn't here.
  Can you imagine?  I can't.
  Imagine your life without that.
  So yeah, picture of an old timey pharmacy,  which again, I kind of wish they had it there  and that was just the candy store or something.
  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
  I wish at least it was themed after it.
  Yeah, yeah.
  Right, where there was old time medicine  but it was just a Gobstopper.
  It seems like a lot of emphasis on mortar and pestles.
  Which are cool.
  Which are cool.
  Also a jar of live leeches.
  Yeah, we got a photo of that.
  Can Brett through there?  Brett, bring up that leeches photo.
  Pull up the leeches please.
  Yeah, this is a really creepy situation.
  This is scarier than anything in Disneyland.
  Now this was not a real pharmacy.
  No.
  The bank was a real bank.
  This was not a real pharmacy.
  Oh, here we go.
  There they are.
  Yeah, there's a girl just staring in horror  at leeches that are very long.
  These are three inchers, three inch guy.
  They were bred on leech farms.
  Like these medicinal leeches were bred  to be good at medical stuff.
  Right, they were trained.
  Yeah, yeah, they like whispered at them,  suck out bad stuff, not good.
  Don't just make people bleed and that's it.
  Yeah, oh yeah.
  They definitely didn't stop using leeches for a reason.
  Yeah, were leeches happening so much in this era?  I feel like no.
  If we're saying this is turn of the century.
  I feel like this is a fun thing they're using here.
  Because I think they're touching on,  before pharmacies there were apothecaries.
  And I think if you go back far enough,  you get to like, oh no,  leeches can take out the bad blood.
  Right, but this wasn't happening  as much in the 50s and 60s.
  No.
  I think the, well not 50s and 60s certainly,  but if we're like tributing turn of the century.
  Right, like mainstream timeline.
  What I saw is that maybe,  like they were around a little  and that you'd find them at bars and barber shops  to treat black eyes.
  So got punched in the face,  put a scary black worm under your eye.
  Would it just suck the blood out  so it would not look as bruised?  I think that's the idea.
  That's right, some dentistry.
  You used to go to the barber to get your hair cut,  a shave and get some bad teeth pulled.
  Whoa, that's wild.
  Buy a leech.
  All right, leeches gonna start,  leeches gonna yank this tooth out.
  Also how often are you getting a black eye as an adult?  Well in the turn of the century probably a lot.
  I guess probably a lot, yeah.
  Rough and tumble time.
  Bullies everywhere.
  You hit a wrong note in your barbershop quartet  and they gang up on you, that's three against one.
  Blue-dos, Popeye's, blue-dos everywhere.
  Hey, I'm ready to, I gotta kiss ya.
  I'm gonna take you out and give you a suck ya one.
  I'm gonna suck ya one.
  They're just mumbling constantly  and you gotta stay away from them.
  Yeah, and that guy was the secretary of state.
  Yeah, for many years.
  Again, not a real pharmacy  but did employ two real pharmacists  whose names are Frederick August Esteem  and Philip Milton Harvey.
  So they could answer your questions.
  They would dress in, they were wearing  the period appropriate attire.
  They would talk to guests  and they would talk about the exhibits.
  Great, so you watch Leo Wagman waves at you  from an old banker desk and Frederick August  tells you how they used to grind up Sassafras.
  I wonder, is there enough room in there for a real pharmacy?  Probably not, because you gotta get a lot of different,  I mean, I guess around that time,  I don't know how many different drugs they had  just being used in America.
  They're limited, so be like a,  it maybe fit in more of the hotel,  where it's not a hotel store, it's like a little,  it's like one shelf of necessities.
  So yeah, now you can basically just like,  you can buy Tylenol on a leave and stuff, right?  Yeah, you can get those,  yeah, you can buy those at a lot of the shops.
  You can also just go to First Aid  and they'll give you most of them for free.
  Oh, load up.
  Good tip.
  Yeah, that's their way, that's your Disney Land bargain.
  Save yourself some money, folks.
  You bring a little duffel bag and just say,  I have 15 children with headaches.
  And then just open the bag  and then the doctor will dump it in.
  Don't do it if you're a buckler.
  But don't do it, yeah,  because you'll start crying in a minute,  you don't have 15.
 Do it for me.
  I'm too cheap for a leave.
  My only choice was to pay $120 to come to Disneyland.
  My 15 kids don't have headaches.
  They're fine.
  They're fine.
  They're thriving, okay?  Especially the quintuplets.
  They're queer.
 Both sets.
  Clear headed and fine.
  I think I told this story on the trip report  when I went to Disneyland last fall.
  You five timer.
  A five timer.
  But it was still very funny to witness someone  who had a very specific ailment  and knew exactly what they needed come into First Aid.
  I think I was just in there getting an ice pack  and they went, excuse me,  I just rode the Millennium Falcon and my,  I have a stomach ache.
  Do you have Dremamine?  They're like, eh, we have a generic version.
  Here you go.
  So that was funny?  I don't know.
  They were just so, they were just so,  good day, madam.
  Do you have Dremamine?  I have just ridden the Millennium Falcon Smuggler's Run.
  You're saying they knew exactly what it was.
  They didn't have any,  they weren't like me when I went in there  and I was like, there's something in my eye  and I needed help and they were like,  I don't know what to do.
  Yeah, I wasn't sure,  I think I was just not sure if Disney First Aid,  if it was like the school nurse  where you really had to sell  that you needed a single Tylenol,  like please, I have a headache.
  I just need one Tylenol  and they would act like they were giving you  like a Xanax or something.
  They would act like they were giving you  a controlled substance.
  I only went to the nurse once.
  Did we talk about this?  Are you serious?  In all of school years?  Once.
  I went like once a month when I was in elementary school.
  Oh really, you were a nurse?  I was a nervous guy.
  You were a nurse kid.
  I was puking.
  I was always seemingly dehydrated.
  I didn't know you were a nurse kid.
  I was a nurse kid.
  Because there were kids.
  Nurses' pet.
  Yeah, there were kids who would always go to the nurse.
  And sometimes they would just be like,  the solution was like, go in here  and lie down for 20 minutes.
  Wow.
  On that paper bed.
  On the paper bed, yeah.
  I came in there because somebody scratched my eye  in gym class and the nurse couldn't tell  what was wrong with it.
  But she called my mom and she was like,  he says something's wrong with his eye.
  I don't really see it.
  But I think it's probably real  because I've never seen him in here before.
  Like he's never come into the office  so I believe he is not lying.
  Because she would see liars constantly.
  Because kids are lying all day.
  Jason was probably doing it when he was a kid.
  Oh, we all tell a little white lies.
  That's much respect to the guy who heisted that restaurant.
  Yeah, you can just lie your way through things.
  If he had been a little better at lying,  he could have gotten away with it.
  Yeah.
  10 grand from his job.
  So that was the only time I ever went to the nurse once.
  Hey, we were jumping in the pool  in a kid's little red shorts.
  Their scratchy little red shorts.
  I was saying I got a lower half injury.
  Michael has a testicular trisian  due to his little red shorts.
  No, no, no, it was that a kid's,  the bottom of his shorts went against your eye.
  Oh, yeah.
  That was high school with the little red shorts.
  I did not wear little red shorts in elementary school.
  Even though it would have been cute.
  Ballistic, great nylon shorts.
  I wasn't old enough to wear little red shorts.
  I wanted, look, if I could have worn Mickey's  little red shorts when I was in elementary school,  I would have.
  But it was not an option presented to me.
  Yeah.
  Scott, do you have what they gave away  at the Upchon Pharmacy?  Yeah.
  So, well, if you have a more official description.
  I have a very, very detailed description  from Mouse Planet again.
  The shop gave away free postcards,  as well as a free square miniature glass bottle  of orange colored unicap vitamins.
  Inside a red box, a white silhouette  of the Disneyland Castle logo containing a description,  a descriptive pamphlet stating,  a souvenir of Disneyland Upchon with a history of Upchon.
  The bottle was one and a half inches tall  and contained 12 vitamins with an expiration date.
  Yes, I love it.
  Give me more hyper detailed descriptions  of the tiny free vitamin bottle in a box.
  So how, okay, how big was the bottle?  How many vitamins were in it?  How big was the box that held the bottle?  Right.
  So it was the degree of.
  Specificity.
  Yes, that our listeners,  I struggled to get to the word specificity.
  My language has no specificity.
  You were becoming so bored by what you were talking about.
  You just trailed off.
  Little bottles of vitamin of box of.
  Is there a Jim Hale about vitamins?  Is there anybody, is anybody like,  is Kevin Perger done a big Disneyland vitamins.
  An Upchon episode.
  Yeah, Upchon episode.
  I wanna know, were there kids who would dare each other?  Like, do you guys know about the TikTok trend,  gentle minions?  Yes, indeed.
  Where like just tons of teens will go see  the new minions movie in suits and be rowdy.
  I don't know this actually.
  Where they are.
  Aren't they like, I think they're very like, yeah, yeah.
  I've seen footage of them all watching it very intently  with their arms up in this sort of.
  I think it's a mix.
  I think some are rowdy and I think some are, who knows?  But we're there, I'm saying we're there kids  who would go to Upchon, get the free bottle of vitamins.
  Like, I dare you to take all those vitamins.
  I think that being a little stinker  was not invented until the 1960s.
  Oh.
  Like no child had ever misbehaved until,  it was Dennis the Menace really helped kick the idea.
  Just the idea, it was invented by perverse Hollywood writers.
  Oh man, Jordan Peterson's right.
  And that is when everything went off.
  The world gets you Dennis the Menace.
  It will get you Menace too.
  The rowdy antics of Dennis the Menace  destroyed this America.
  Dennis is lost.
  He doesn't, he's looking for meaning.
  He's crying out and society is ignoring him.
  That's why he has to have the little slingshot  poking out of his back pocket.
  We're all Mr.
 Wilson, aren't we?  Aren't we all trying to get the rowdy boy to behave?  Isn't this what we all feel?  You won't cancel me.
  What would Walter Mathau say if he was still with us?  Even Don Rickles in the sequel, the director of the sequel.
  Playing Mr.
 Wilson.
  I was confused by it, but now I understand.
  Wow, that's a pretty solid, like.
  Rickles is Mr.
 Wilson from Mathau to Rickles.
  Well I think Mathau to Rickles, that's pretty good.
  Yeah, Rickles acting career, interesting.
  Yeah, you're right in terms of prominence  and interesting person, but yeah, I guess,  it's an acting trade down.
  Yes, 100%.
  Oh yeah, and I'm sure that was the only shift in quality  in the Dennis to Menace sequel,  which started very, high bar by the way,  the Dennis to Menace Walter Mathau movie.
  Dennis to Menace?  Of a great film.
  Are you calling it Dennis to Menace?  I didn't, but that's a good idea.
  That's what I thought I heard.
  I don't know.
  Did I accidentally say Dennis to Menace?  Maybe not.
  It should have been that.
  Well, that's maybe too, you already had Menace to society,  so two and Menace have already been in a title together.
  That's right, Dennis is a Menace to society.
  Dennis is a Menace, I'll tell you what, two, society.
  I'll get you.
  So weird play, they also, they had a weird,  the movie that's slightly less weird than The Leeches  is that they had something called asafoetida gum,  which is a type of root or spice,  or something that comes from a root or something,  and the nickname for it is Devil's Dung.
  Folks would wear it in a little sack around their necks  to ward off diseases.
  So go to Disneyland, go see the bank teller,  go check out the Devil's Dung, try some strained veal.
  It's at this point, here's maybe a broader question  with this topic that I wanted to bring up,  that's what your main street is.
  Your main street is leeches and Devil's Dung,  and your dad makes a deposit at the bank,  and there was a lock store, they had a history of locks,  you could see a lock from ancient Egypt.
  So you do all that, and then you go,  and that's just your opening act, to then go to a park  which has an unthemed hill and mules that kick  and bite you and piss, and a cloth dumbo  with eyes as black as death.
  Mickey and Minnie with holes in their face.
  Yes, with grates.
  Grates, four grates going down their lower part  of their head, yes.
  I think what I'm getting at is, how did it make it?  In this first year, and I don't even mean that,  because I always said there was fun stuff  at Disneyland even to begin with,  but then there was all this, and what was it  in that first year that got them through?  Because everything we have listed is either boring  or insane, and then a lot of the rest of the park  was that too, what do you think the takeaway,  when you came back from early Disneyland,  what was like, and then they had this, a castle?  I bet the castle and the Fantasyland rides,  and I bet those went a long way.
  Oh yeah, Jungle Cruise was almost what it was,  because that was roughly the same,  just with less animation and the figures,  and the trees hadn't grown out yet.
  But that's pretty, yeah, in 1955,  that's pretty crazy and immersive.
  Yeah, and that's kitschy and fun.
  No jokes yet though, don't forget.
  No jokes, serious.
  We're just saying serious facts about tigers.
  Yes, very serious.
  So I bet it's that, I do think probably  having it be turn of the century Main Street  felt novel to people and reminded them of their childhood,  or some of them, depending where they lived.
  So that was a nice nostalgia hit for them.
  I mean, I guess, look, I'm somebody who goes  to the saddest malls I can find,  because they feel like 1983, so that's roughly,  that's like a 50s person trying to visit a weird town  from 1902.
  Well, it's like me when I drove through the Taco Bell  a couple weeks ago, near where I live,  and I was like, oh, they repainted it,  and it's the 90s purple.
  Like they're using 90s purple on a lot of Taco Bells again,  which is very exciting.
  It still doesn't look like the same  as 90s Taco Bell inside, but it made me feel good  seeing 90s purple on the outside of the building.
  That does sound nice.
  Yeah.
  I love Taco Bell.
  Yeah, it's fun.
  Yeah, it's like the preserved Burger King  that was going around Twitter.
  Oh yeah, they uncovered the Burger King.
  From the Concord Mall in Wilmington, Delaware,  which I used to go to all the time,  and I was like, yeah, I recognize that Burger King.
  I recognize that Burger King.
  Like.
  It was just like sealed up, and they never.
  Sealed up?  Yes.
  It's a woman posted, she's like,  I worked at that mall one summer,  and this was our overflow store room,  and there were just boxes and boxes  among the booths and stuff.
  It reminded me of when the turtles  find that untouched subway station in Secret of the Ooze.
  And make it their home?  And they make it their home  because it's been abandoned, no one knows it's there.
  Yeah, so they just found.
  Oh, oh yeah.
  Perfectly preserved.
  Yes, yes, yes.
  Like I was like, I think I was sitting there  after Toy Story, I think we bought extra toys.
  A little toy, whatever.
  For Toy Story.
 Google it.
  Yeah, yeah, oh boy, oh I will.
  So.
  I'll try to find like a VR helmet  that'll let me just wrap myself in those.
  So yeah, so if we were imagining what,  like the version for us, if there was a new theme park  and Main Street looked like just a mundane mall  that we went to when we were little,  with like a retro Burger King, a retro McDonald, like.
  Yeah.
  If a.
  Like.
  No, it's an old circuit city.
  Babbage's, what is that?  Oh, Babbage's, yeah.
  The old electronics store.
  I don't know if Babbage's.
  Babbage's and electronics boutique.
  Electronics boutique.
  An old hot topic.
  An Aladdin's Palace arcade.
  Oh, Aladdin's Palace, fantastic.
  Yeah, so if it was like all of that,  I'm going back every weekend.
  Yeah, yeah.
  If it's like that hardcore.
  They have, they have a Mervins, wait for it, California.
  A Mervins California, who would care about a Mervins, but.
  So yeah, cause like even our parents who like Disneyland,  that's still, like they didn't live  during the time of Main Street.
  They're maybe fascinated by.
  And yeah, so I think, you know,  when you were going in the 50s,  there was a much higher percentage of people  that had lived through the time period it was representing.
  Yeah, yeah.
  For sure.
  And it's like the most like clean, idealized version of it.
  Yes, there's no problems there.
  Well, and also, all right, so in asking that question,  what were the hits?  What were getting people to leave Disneyland  and talk about Disneyland?  I think that brings us to the big dog.
  I was wondering like, oh, are we wrapping up?  No, no, no.
  Are we just building up this?  No, no, no, no, no.
  Is this its own?  No, no, no.
  Is the wizard?  Look, it should be its own, but it will do it here.
  It should be its own.
  We'll do it here.
  Let's do it.
  If we can, if we can contain ourselves.
  We're gonna get really nervous.
  And that is, okay, we're gonna buckle.
  We're gonna buckle even talking about it.
  Well, we'll ease ourselves in  because we're talking about a store  called the Intimate Apparel Shop.
  It's not the Intimate Apparel Shop contain,  but the incredible, the immortal,  the wonderful Wizard of Braz.
  Is there a way to turn these studio lights red?  Oh.
  Turn up the heat on us in here?  The table red is a red table talk.
  We're getting real.
  We're getting real about bras.
  So yeah, Disneyland had a bra store.
  I mean, what it said, okay, so outside of the store says,  if you can pull it up, the outside,  there's like people standing on the steps or something.
  And the, well, here we go.
  There's, well, there's the wizard.
  There's the wizard, C.
V.
 Wood in front of him,  an early, important figure in early Disneyland,  who I later went on to other projects outside of Disney.
  And I have heard described alternately  as an interesting character and kind of a con man.
  But I haven't really dug into.
  Yeah, me neither.
  Yeah, I need to learn the show.
  Oh, that, yeah.
  Yeah, that's a good tease.
  We'll figure out what's up with C.
V.
 Wood.
  But okay, so this exhibit was sponsored  by the Hollywood Maxwell Bra Company.
  And they had the tagline, the Wizard of Braz.
  The viewers can see that here.
  Included, and with this odd piece of art,  where we are looking at two women,  one is in a bra and one is in,  the outside of the store says,  "'Torsolette,' a word I have never heard in my life.
"  I guess that is a corset.
  I believe that's what I would think it is.
  That's an old-timey way.
  But a lovely torsolette.
  And these, it's very bridal.
  It says, the bride chooses bras for beauty's sake.
  The whisper wardrobe, lavished in lace,  wooing a wide world of fashion with straps to,  blah, blah, blah.
  But anyway, the headline of what we're looking at right now  is these two women kind of demure and looking down  and changing into their beautiful torsolettes.
  But then there's a fucking creep behind him.
  Look out, one of the it follows creatures is behind you.
  There is a murderer.
  Pressed against foggy glass?  I don't know exactly.
  It looks sort of like Eric Idle making a goofy face.
  Big wide eyes.
  And is that the Wizard of Bras?  Is this the Wizard of Bras?  Yes, that's the Wizard of Bras.
  There's the Yesterland posts on this  have a little illustration of him.
  It's not much better.
  He's like a weird little, not quite a jester.
  Yeah, he's like Zoltar.
  He's like a dude.
  There you go.
  He's like a little Zoltar-y.
  He's a little like the person in the medieval movie  who it's like, oh, they're a total liar.
  They're snake oil salesmen.
  And they're trying to weasel their way into becoming king.
  I wouldn't trust this man to sell you a brassiere.
  Yeah.
  Creepy attitude.
  I mean, if anything, he should be selling neck doilies,  whatever the hell those are called.
  Yeah.
  You know, what Shakespeare wore.
  What are neck, I mean, is it neck doilies?  Why not?  Oh, I know that thing.
  Yeah, you know those puffy's that people wore  because they were dumb in old dumb times.
  That is a very good question.
  But then what's he holding in this picture?  Is it a key?  Is it a leech?  Is he trying to make these women have leeches?  Is it like, you're not beautiful enough.
  Let the leech suck more beauty.
  Suck the ugly out of you.
  I will remain young forever.
  Well, in the illustrated one,  he has a, like, it looks like he's holding a needle.
  Like a weird little.
  A needle.
  Like stringing it through his ears.
  Yeah, I don't know what this.
  What's he doing?  Oh yeah, he's pulling a needle through his ears.
  Why?  It's like an old circus trick.
  What are you doing, wizard of bronze?  Does one of the torso let,  does it like unlock like some sort of chastity belt?  Maybe from the back?  And he's like, I've locked you in.
  A knot will unlock until your wedding night.
  Your groom's in for a nasty surprise.
  Certainly I have the key.
  I will be there at all your important moments.
  I am the wizard.
  He's really a great Disney villain.
  He should be up there with a Chernobog, quite frankly.
  He's one of, yeah, he is a scary,  I mean, yeah, they should be using him in Phantasmac.
  Why not?  We should have seen the wizard of bronze fight Mickey.
  He's in Phantasmac.
  An evil champion of women's chastity.
  Yeah.
  He's really strange.
  Nick, can we go back to that other photo  where he's on the steps?  There's some stuff to analyze here.
  So I guess this is the same guy,  but now he's got like a big cartoon head.
  And oh, there's the needle.
  Okay, we're doing some sleuthing here.
  He's holding that same needle.
  So that's an important.
  Yeah, and of course there's Hernan J.
 Norris.
  Herndan.
  Herndan.
  Herndan.
  Herndan.
  J.
 Norris.
  And they're both staring at a bug going by.
  I don't know what they're doing.
  President of the Hollywood Maxwell Brazier Company.
  Also should be noted,  the designer at the Hollywood Maxwell's company  who would often go to Paris fashion shows and stuff  was named Theo Devo.
  Wow, yeah, that's a cool name.
  Ooh, neat.
  I mean, without a picture of the wizard of bronze  putting the needle through his head,  I think it's like it's a knitting needle, right?  I guess so.
  He's sewing the torso in.
  Yeah.
  Right, but I mean it would help  if it was some string attached to it  and there were like two knitting needles,  but I assume that's what's going on.
  Now we're getting to a more fun territory  with the full picture of this character  because he's like wearing fish nets, right?  So that's fun.
  He's wearing the products.
  Like stockings?  Yeah.
  Yeah.
  Is this the same character as the character  from the other picture though?  Yeah, I think this,  well, this looks like a walk around one,  but there was like a mechanized one, right?  I think we're looking at the mechanized one.
  We are looking at.
  I don't know because it's the best photo that exists.
  Yeah.
  Of that.
  And by the way, just in your question, Michael,  who is the real wizard of bras?  I also saw one that's just like a cone  and who's just like a little cute cartoon guy.
  He's a cute, like a left breast of a bra?  I wouldn't say that.
  Even though this company did sell the 50s pointy bras,  I wouldn't say that because he was longer  than those would probably be.
  He was just a cone.
  He looked like a big wizard's hat,  but then the top part of him  was his own little wizard's hat.
  Okay, so it wasn't like a Madonna cone bra.
  I don't think he was one breast of a cone bra, no.
  So there's a lot of ways to represent,  like Mickey, there's a lot of different wizards of bras.
  Yeah.
  Now, while this picture is up for people viewing this,  that man on the right who's looking at an ant infestation,  the one in the darkest suit,  he is the voice of the wizard of bras.
  So I don't know this for sure,  but my best guess is that there was a mechanized figure  that looks like, or that it is,  this stocking-clad vizier, whatever you want to say he is.
  Who would tell you about the history  of underwear and intimate apparel?  Mm-hmm.
  And with this guy's voice,  which you can only imagine is like,  I don't wear bras, like how else is he gonna sound?  And a couple things here.
  First of all, there's info about this  on the Ripley's Believe It or Not website.
  Because then, by the way, wizard bras is one of these things,  if there's ever a list of the weirdest things  ever at Disneyland, wizard bras is in there, definitely.
  It's not number one.
  So you see it a lot, but still not a lot of info  to pull from it.
  But it was enough that Ripley's Believe It or Not  talked about it, and they called the little show  that you watched an underwear history lesson.
  Ha ha!  And let's see.
  So there was a couple bits to this.
  It was a store where you could buy bras and torsillettes.
  So you could do that.
  But there was also a demonstration aspect to it.
  One bit seems to be that you would look into  3D illusion boxes, and you would turn your head  in the illusion box, or one of those pens you would get  that makes ladies clothes disappear.
  Of course.
  So you would look one way, and it was a woman fully clothed.
  And then you'd look another way,  and she was just in a corset and pantaloons.
  Okay.
  So it was a place in early Disneyland,  an opening day Disneyland, where you put your head  in a box and watched a woman undress.
  It was a peep show.
  It was a little peep show.
  It was a little peep show.
  There you go.
  And you'd think they'd lean into,  and this stuff is utilitarian, and society's opinions  have changed on it from here to there, and that's it.
  But they are a little bawdy about it all.
  They are a little bawdy.
  And Jason's getting emotional and upset about it.
  I don't understand.
  How could they, they're grooming.
  It's grooming.
  It seems like there were some interviews,  websites would note it, that they would talk to people  who worked there, talk to cast members at the time,  and they'd be like, okay, yeah, the parents and the kids  didn't really care.
  The grandmothers would giggle, and the older,  the grandpas would be scandalized that this was here.
  And I guess that's just a side, that's progress for you.
  That seems to be the.
.
.
  Grandpas were scandalized?  They were like, I'm so upset with this.
  They weren't upset, they were just like,  oh, I can't be in here, I have to get out of here.
  Well, you're discussing, you're describing passages  from a Disney-produced article from an internal newspaper  called Disneyland News with the headline,  If Hubby is Shy, Watch Him at Main Street Corset Shop.
  Hubby is so shy.
  Hubby is shy in the corsetaria.
  It's just a weird article in general,  but it's the older generation of men  who are the most polite.
  They invariably remove their hats upon entering the store.
  Oh, there's pantaloons nearby, I best remove my hat.
  I mean, people would remove their hat  anytime they went in anywhere.
  That's old, for people's favorite thing to enforce,  is hats on or hats off.
  And they loved getting apoplectic at like,  the guy hasn't taken his hat off in this diner,  in this 24-hour diner.
  Meals ruined, birthdays ruined, any occasion destroyed  because a guy like 100 feet away had a hat on.
  If you could have monitored everyone's blood pressure  as they walked in there,  I bet it would have jumped 30 points.
  I need to calm down, I need to go get some tobacco,  three doors up.
 Some baby veal.
  Yeah.
  I need to calm down with some baby veal.
  You can't eat baby veal in the store,  you're spilling it on the torsolettes.
  It is crazy, I mean, I'm sure people have said this,  and maybe we've like, Walt famously didn't want  Annette Funicello to wear a two-piece bathing suit  because she would show her mid-drift in movies.
  But he had a bra store where you could see,  I mean, maybe they weren't showing their belly.
  He was upset with the belly.
  You put your head in a box,  he would have happily had Annette wear whatever,  but you have to have a special box to view it.
  But if it's a room open to anyone,  and a grandpa or a hubby might walk in and be scandalized.
  Was it some sort of a box that would protect you from Jesus?  Like Jesus is scorned?  Like how Magneto has a helmet to protect him  from Professor X?  So if you put yourself in this box  that would protect you from religious or God's scorn,  you could gawk at a woman's bare belly.
  Yeah, I think so.
  Well, you can make Jesus sort of magically appear  in items when you want to.
  So yes, by virtue of that,  you could make him disappear from a box.
  So Walt could have like a priest like bless a box,  a reverse blessing or something,  or have like a church of Satan guy bless the box  to prevent Jesus from getting into the box.
  So whatever hubby does in that box,  Jesus doesn't find out about.
  Yeah, I think so, yeah.
  We're opening in three days.
  We haven't had the Church of Satan  chase Jesus out of the boxes yet out of the bra box.
  Now, I don't go for you, you characters a lot of the time,  but there's one thing I need you to do.
  You're good at chasing Christ away.
  Protect hubbies when they're getting a peek.
  We don't want Jesus here in the bra store.
  So please put us put a first put a spell on them  to ensure that their hats get removed.
  Because if they don't, their hats are going to fly off.
  It's going to blow off their heads.
  Steam will come out their ears.
  We need a satanic draft in the entrance of the store.
  And he'll blow hats back then.
  Yeah, so this is stuff Walt had to deal with.
  He apparently was against having this store.
  He did not want this to be here,  but he had to flesh out the street.
  There had to be things in the street.
  Sure, he was against it.
  He's the guy in charge.
  Hollywood is the story.
  Hollywood makeup even Max Factor,  the actual Max Factor, told him to fuck off.
  And it's like, OK, guess we can't have a makeup shop.
  What else do mom, grandma, and little Sally like?  Pantaloons.
  I don't know, underwear.
  They need dresses and underwear.
  Laces, toilets.
  Undergarments.
  They smoke cigarettes.
  Oh, fuck, we already have that.
  Women in the park should smoke cigarettes  with little bits of lace at the end.
  The cigsigalettes.
  Fire again at Disneyland due to the lace cigarette trend.
  Like, there should have been.
.
.
  There were other things he could have done.
  If you really like pudding, like pudding works.
  Someone's like a pudding store on Main Street.
  They didn't have to put this here.
  He was pretending he didn't want this here.
  Second candy store.
  Sure.
  Or so to fowl.
  You know what, between the carnation and the candy,  the carnation ice cream and the pharmacy,  there wasn't, I'm sure there was regular fountain soda,  but there wasn't an old timey, you know, sarsaparilla soda.
  I still think pudding works is a good choice.
  If they had just a full-time pudding radio,  a good Disneyland pudding place.
  J.
L.
 Pudding's pudding works or something.
  There are a couple pudding places in Los Angeles.
  Really?  I think, yeah.
  Where, do you know?  Santa Monica?  I don't know.
  Is it like hipster pudding?  I think it's like, yeah, it's like a paper version of pudding.
  So you load it with toppings and stuff.
  Yeah.
  Interesting.
  High-end Silver Lake hipster pudding.
  Yeah.
  You heard it.
  I did not know about this, Trevor.
  We gotta go.
  The thing that's like $2 at the grocery store, guess what?  They found a way to make it $10.
  Man, I wonder, is there like a Mike Gambusa of pudding?  Or is that maybe you?  Could be, yeah, yeah, the door's open.
  Yeah.
  J.
M.
 Sheridan's pudding works.
  J.
M.
 Sheridan's trifle world.
  Puddins and trifles.
  The Wizard of Trifles.
  Before we wind it down, there's a clip that we have,  if we could play that, because there's no audio of the,  what then the Wizard of Braz did,  which is very upsetting that we can't look at that character  and then know how Gruff and William Frawley is.
  Yes.
  But what if there was some even weirder audio  that people cannot seem to find,  or it seems like the most I found was,  this may have been at a print-on-demand kiosks.
  This was possibly part of when they did,  I guess, the 50th anniversary or around then,  you could burn a CD.
  You could pick what tracks you wanted on a CD and burn it,  and this might have been one of them.
  Which could have been like a song from a ride  or it's Groom Grinning Ghost or something,  but then it could also be this odd 90-second snippet  of the Wizard of Braz show.
  So this isn't the wizard, let's be clear.
  She's setting up the wizard.
  So I don't remember a lot of what this is,  but let's just experience it together.
  Look in the mirror and see the story of fashion.
  Like all stories, it has two sides,  but since fashion is a lady,  the world can only know half of it.
  The truth is that even in Granny's day,  being a doll required a lot of pull.
  Those 90s were supposed to be gay,  but it took a lot of work to be stylish,  and most of it was undercover, as this makes clear.
  Needless to say, Granny's secrets were well hidden.
  Why, she turned green with envy if she could see the lift  today's girl gets from our low-cut Viet.
  I want you to pause between every third word.
  Cheeky pauses.
  Then for a change of mood,  there's the new and intoxicating pink champagne  that lends its own sweet shape to you.
  You see, modern girls have so many fashions to choose from,  it takes a wizard to keep them in shape.
  That's why Hollywood Maxwell designs a bra for every fashion.
  To see them all, just ask at your favorite store  for Hollywood Maxwell, the Wizard of Bras.
  My favorite store?  Favorite store, yeah.
  My favorite store is Fry's Electronics.
  I don't think I could ask them for Hollywood Maxwell bras.
  I went into the Woolworths and said,  do you have Hollywood Maxwell's bras?  And they're like, no.
  One thing that's striking me from that is that music.
  I was going to say the music is so.
.
.
  Vrooom.
  Doot doot doot doot doot doot.
  Vrooom.
  That's still used as lazy comedy music in certain movies.
  Yeah.
  You're like, oh god, the comedy music.
  Yeah, good old sneak around.
  Sneak around music, yeah, it is sneak around music,  but it is trying to lighten the mood.
  It's trying to lighten the mood of this like, dolekit.
  It's uncomfortable.
  Well, the hijinks that, you know, like,  Steve Martin might get into,  try to get his way at the wedding and father of the bride.
  Yes.
  But in this case, it's the hijinks of a woman  hiding her.
.
.
 giving herself some pull for hubby.
  A woman, but you can only know how a woman is this.
  Just clothes, I don't know.
  Humans are so fucked, like, it starts to close.
  Come on.
  I mean, I'm not saying like when I was younger  and you'd like walk into a Victoria's Secret,  I wouldn't be like, what am I?  I can't look at anything.
  Like, I was like that, but like, this is society I live in.
  This is the society.
  What do you need to do, ladies?  Spend an hour and a half getting little hooks and pulleys  to jam around your body,  make you very uncomfortable all day  so that you can sort of look like you are half a pound lighter.
  I wonder if Hollywood Exile had the reputation  that I have heard women talk about Victoria's Secret,  go like, it fucking sucks.
  Like, none of the sizes are correct.
  They don't measure you right.
  Like, an actual apparel, like, women's apparel store,  actual, like, bra shop, they're like,  you've been wearing the wrong size bra for two decades.
  You're saying like, teen mall employees that work there  might not be measuring people correctly?  Yeah, it might not be totally correct, yeah.
  Well, the Hollywood Maxwell bras from these pictures,  if I'm gathering things correctly,  they were the perfect size and shape  for women's pyramid-shaped breasts,  which I assume that they had until the year 1959 or so,  until they evolved to be less pointy.
  Until the 60s when they started burning bras.
  Like, they were burning.
.
.
  They started over as the Great Revolution.
  We had to reinvent what they were even like.
  Yeah, yeah.
  What a strange place and show.
  Oh, but here, just before we wrap up,  one thing that's interesting about this,  this odd, creepy show with that V.
O.
  Oh, buh-buh-buh, and I don't know.
  And then whatever the wizard sounded like.
  And I don't know what the wizard did,  but he at least probably like turned  or shook around violently.
  But he was mechanized.
  And keep in mind, in 1955,  there were not mechanized characters at Disneyland.
  Lincoln was almost a decade to go,  no Enchantiqui room.
  So it's possible, possible that technically  the first audio animatronic was the Wizard of Bras.
  Wow.
  Yeah.
  That's pretty wild.
  Again, don't know what he did.
  Probably just like his ears steamed.
  Yeah.
  At the mere thought of like a, you know,  of a half inch of skin revealing itself.
  If he rotated, it made the sound of like an ax being sharpened.
  Like, it was just horrifying.
  He sparked, he would spark.
  Again, if those sparks tumbled into the barber shop,  into the barberside.
  He's the first ever robot that could get horny.
  That's what we're trying to say.
  He's the first.
  Now we have many robots like that,  but back then that was very rare.
  Yeah, look, and if you played that like tinkling little music,  you were allowed to be a little horny.
  Disneyland could have a little horny as a treat  if you had that.
  Because it would make it comfortable.
  Without the soundtrack, it would go right to hell.
  Society would fall apart.
  But unless you play the Mickey and Goofy sneaking around the haunted house music.
  Walt came into Matching Ring one day and he goes,  here's what I need you to do.
  We need to make a robot who's a little horny.
  Not a lot.
  A little horny.
  Can we do it?  All right, see you later.
  And he walked out and he went to see Hazel George  and get his polo injury worked on.
  His laugh in place.
  Yeah, yeah.
  Okay, ladies, that's the presentation.
  Now all eyes on the wizard who's about to get hard.
  What a wall person.
  I said a little.
  I didn't say anything about an erection.
  I'll allow a 20 degree angle.
  He can go 20 degrees up, not a full 90.
  Not a full one.
  No full 90s, not on my watch.
  If I say a 90, we're shutting the store down.
  Roy comes in.
  He's like, this is too expensive to give a robot a boner.
  Walt, we're going broke here.
  The Bank of America won't allow this.
  I'll ask him for 50 grand more.
  No problem.
  Here's what I'll do.
  I'll stage a robbery.
  All fake robbing the bank so we can pay for this wizard robot boner.
  If the chicken of the sea people can cut the amount of tuna used on sandwiches in half,  we'll save ourselves a bundle.
  Have a scoop, fellas.
  We got rusty robotic erections to pay for.
  Well, I think that's a little window into what Main Street was like back in the early.
  It was exactly like that.
  And if you manage to not get sparks in your eyes that flew off of the Wizard of Braz,  you could have yourself a pretty nifty day.
  You survived Podcast The Ride.
  And thank you for putting up with an episode that did not have full host content,  much like a chicken of the sea sandwich.
  It was thin on host for a little bit, but I hope it was an assumptuous meal anyway.
  I want to apologize to everyone for my little secrets.
  I will be on all the episodes going forward unless other little secrets get in the way.
  Little secrets, sorry.
  Little secrets.
  Well, while we wait to see if he makes good on that or buckles,  you can find us on all the socials at Podcast The Ride.
  Merch is available in our T-Public store.
  This video will be up on the Forever Dog YouTube.
  We've got a YouTube and I'll put on a playlist there.
  You'll find it.
  You'll figure it out.

  Well, what a wonderful trip into the past.
  I hope that it was an entertaining look at things that were largely not entertaining.
  But did keep the lights on.
  That's right.
  And leeches.
