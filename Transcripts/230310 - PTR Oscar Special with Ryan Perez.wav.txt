 A frightened 22-year-old dressed as Snow White!  And there's the man of the hour, Ryan Perez,  who joins the boys for the first ever Oscar special  on Podcast The Ride!  It's a wonderful night for podcasts, podcasts, podcasts.
  Let's begin.
  The three hosts of Podcast The Ride are me,  Scott Gardner, Jason Sheridan.
  I was driving over and I was like,  is anyone going to do it?  It's a wonderful night for podcasts, podcasts.
  Should I do it?  And so I'm so happy.
  I wouldn't mind if you did it.
  You can still do it if you want.
  No, that's fine.
  No, I don't want to take the glory.
  You can make it a wonderful night  for podcasts.
  It's wonderful.
  It's wonderful.
  It's wonderful.
  It's wonderful.
  Resistance the  years.
  And then the Schindler's List year, he was like,  I'm not gonna do, I mean, I don't know,  maybe he already had his fill or whatever,  but like he purposefully sat out a year  where I think it would have been tough  to be super, super funny or upbeat or whatever.
  The Schindler's List song would have been  the most difficult job of his life.
  He probably tried to crack it though and couldn't do it.
  He probably thought about that and then he was like,  ah, I'll give it to Whoopi.
  Yeah, there's drafts of a song he was trying to work out  and they were horrendous.
  Yes, there were some, I'm sure he got bruised.
  Even a blanch at the Hotel Roosevelt,  just like a pen and a pen, just like, what do you think?  It's gonna break me, it's the one I can't do.
  I think he will do it one more time.
  Okay.
 I hope so.
  Yeah, I could see them in a weird hostless year  being like, well, Billy's open to it  and he's getting up there and one more time for nostalgia.
  Yeah, was 2012 the last time he did it?  The most recent time?  Oh, I don't know the year.
  He says, I've hosted it nine times.
  I watched it 2012.
  I think so.
  Moment, and even some of that was like,  oh, I don't know if he'd make that joke now.
  Like, there was a joke about Jonah Hill dropping some weight  and it cuts to the Moneyball-like people  and you just see he is really not happy.
  And fair enough, because it was kind of mean-spirited.
  It didn't really have like a-  Like, lay off the donuts next time.
  Yeah, and then he's given, he's tossing a softball,  he's just going up to Scorsese and he's like, oh, Marty.
  But that was funny, because there was just like  an uninterested, I'm assuming Scorsese's daughter  sitting next to him and she was an uninterested pre-teen  and I'm like, wait a minute, the math,  is that the one that does the TikToks with him in it now?  Oh yeah, probably.
  I think so, yeah.
  Oh, I haven't been keeping up with the  Crystal TikTok content.
  Oh wait, no, I'm sorry, not Crystal, Scorsese's daughter.
  Scorsese's daughter.
  Oh right, this I've heard about, okay, okay.
  Will do post TikToks and occasionally  she'll get him to be in one.
  She'll like, wrap his Christmas gifts in Marvel paper.
  Yes.
 Like Marvel comics.
  Yeah, she'll get his ass.
  And as usual, Marty, great sport, great sport about it.
  Sure.
 Yeah.
  He probably, he acknowledges it as some new kind of form.
  You know, it's like, I gotta help.
  Audio visual entertainment.
  It's fun to do audio visual entertainment content,  but you know, yeah, he's probably,  he's probably on some level appreciates it,  that she's a burgeoning little filmmaker, TikTok filmmaker.
  Yeah.
 I don't think so.
  I think he probably hates it  and I'm gonna cancel him on Twitter.
  Next chance I get.
  Nothing I love more than holding him to the fire  every three months when that comes around.
  We're all being mean to Marty today.
  Since you mentioned Twitter, I have been wondering,  I have been thinking about the Billy Crystal,  like song and dance openings a little bit lately,  because recently there was the thing  that took on the life of its own,  the Ariana DeBose number at the BAFTAs.
  And I watched it a couple of times  and I talked to Jane about, I'm like,  what are people talking, what is the issue?  Is this because she's out of breath?  It's because she kind of delivered one of the lines  and she's like, I think, yeah, it just kind of caught fire.
  Like it's just getting roasted on the internet,  but you can see when it cuts to people,  like the older people in the,  like Jamie Lee Curtis is like, she gets it.
  Michelle Yeoh gets it.
  But like the younger people are just like,  what the hell is this?  Like they don't have the context of Oscar, Oscar, Oscar.
  What does she do?  I haven't actually watched it.
  I'm aware that it's been roasted a little bit,  but what is she doing in it?  I mean, the thing that really caught on was she said,  was it Angela Bassett did the thing?  Angela Bassett did the thing.
  Yeah.
  Like really, truly just that one line,  slightly breathless saying, Angela Bassett did the thing  is now we're obsessed with this.
  Everyone in the world is obsessed with this  really embarrassing moment.
  This, oh my God, what an embarrassing moment.
  You look at it, you're like, what?  Like, especially if you're looking at things in the context,  like I've been looking at a few musical numbers,  Oscar numbers in the context of preparing for this show.
  And I'm like, this is, there are 9,000 moments like this  in every single Oscar's opening number ever.
  Yeah.
  Like.
  Yeah, skin crawling.
  There are moments, I've talked about this before on the show.
  This comes up in theme park shows a lot,  but if I am really mortified by something  that the hairs stand up on my arm,  I get embarrassment goosebumps.
  Especially the main thing I get it from  is cheesiness in musical numbers.
  Yeah.
  And it will happen in the next couple hours.
  Oh yeah.
  Guaranteed.
  I guess, so maybe that's the, I should watch this thing  and see if it gives me,  makes the hairs on my arm do anything.
  I mean, it's a little corny,  but I feel like award shows have always been a little corny.
  You know?  And so I think what the reality is,  well the thing to blame here is  they probably rehearsed this once, maybe twice,  and they didn't clock,  this was an elaborate dance number,  this is an elaborate costume to get off,  to then run across the stage and then start rapping.
  It was probably like,  oh, I don't think the stage manager thought this through.
  Sure, sure.
  And just like, if anybody is complaining about this,  maybe, I just assume anyone complaining about it  has not seen Kevin Spacey at the Weird Sports Awards.
  Yeah, oh yes, yeah.
  The laureates.
  I mean, if you're missing basketball shots  and offending Tony Hawk,  there's no way whatever you're describing is worse.
  Well also, Ariana DeVos did the Tonys, I think, last year  and was fantastic.
  This is a very extremely capable musical.
  Musical theater pro.
  Musical theater performer.
  And given the task of a bad song,  like what's, okay yeah, a bad song, what's new?  They're all bad.
  There's never been a good musical number,  lyrics-wise, in an award show.
  Yeah, yeah.
  Which we will prove this evening as we do this for sure.
  Ryan, in terms of your Oscar experience,  I don't wanna put the term Oscar fan on you.
  Oh please don't.
  That doesn't seem right.
  So I wanted to poke around what would be better than that.
  I don't know, I mean, it seems like you,  I feel like you have been fascinated by  or engaged with the Oscars at least forever.
  I don't know how you want to calibrate  your Oscar affection or otherwise.
  Oh sure, yeah, I think, I mean,  as a byproduct of really loving movies,  you're always interested in the Oscars.
  I mean, if you like movies, at least when you're young,  you have a curiosity about them.
  I think even as a young person, I learned very early  that the Oscars don't really have a ton to do with movies.
  Sure, sure.
  Like it's not like your favorite ones  are winning Oscars or whatever.
  So that whole, like the competitive element of the Oscars,  I became disenchanted with like very young.
  But I watch them every year  and watch them kind of closely every year  because I think they're unfailingly,  it's almost like the State of the Union or something.
  They're almost like a bellwether of the climate  of the industry and the political climate at the time  and everything.
  And it's also like a weird game show  where people are winning an award  and have to like pitch themselves  and the rest of their careers at you  over the course of a minute or two.
  And so it's just a fascinating,  really high pressure event to watch in terms,  and also just the spectacle and everything too.
  But I think they're like,  I like the Oscars in particular.
  And award shows, I've never been to one.
  I don't really care to ever go to one,  but to watch them is tremendous fun.
  But you can't take it on the surface.
  I think people watch them and they say,  well, that Oscars was not entertaining.
  But if you watch on a surface level,  they aren't entertaining.
  The Oscars do suck pretty much all the time.
  But you have to be able to read them.
  If you're able to read them and read what's like going on,  they're very fascinating.
  Oh, sure.
  It's like one part of the text is the ceremony itself,  but everything else happening.
  That's why the slap is like the most interesting thing  because it's like, whoa,  like real hostility that maybe you could have guessed  or sensed or whatever suddenly broke through  and it became like a real thing.
  Well, and you had to fill in the back,  not all of the information was there on the stage.
  Because when it happened, it was like,  that joke caused that?  We all had to learn that she,  I assume I had to learn that she had alopecia.
  I don't track every move of Jada Pinkett Smith  and I don't think Chris Rock does either.
  So like, okay, that, wait,  and he made some jokes that was,  she was offended by years prior, okay.
  Yeah.
  Oh, and Will Smith is out of his goddamn mind, okay.
  That's also important.
  Well, the legitimacy of the moment was in question too.
  There was a big debate raging of was it real or not?  I had that thought.
  I definitely had that thought.
  Yeah.
  We were all watching it.
  The four of us were all together.
  We all processed the slap.
  Jane, I feel like called it as real immediately.
  Mike, you also did.
  I was a real truther the whole time.
  And I was on the fence.
  I watch fake combat sports regularly.
  Well, that's what, yeah,  we were trying to figure out if it was kayfabe,  but then the sound got real fucked up.
  Like when the sound got fucked up,  I feel like that's when I was like.
  Yeah, that muddied the entire,  like the slap itself, I feel like,  still could have felt like a bit potentially,  especially if you didn't hear the sound of it,  which was like very raw and clearly injured him.
  But then once it cut to that shot,  once it cut to the screaming,  was where like, uh-oh, this would not be happening  in a bit, I don't think.
  It would have been more fun after that.
  If it was a bit, it would have been like a fun thing  at the end there.
  Yeah.
  Well, because you know, I'm an envelope truther.
  I think I.
 Oh, right.
  It would come up.
  I think that, and I, and I,  and no one has told me that I have no actual  foundational belief in this,  but I do believe that Kimmel,  known for his pranks occasionally,  staged some kind of prank or whatever with producers,  probably did arrange something that went awry  and the response was bad  and they've not really admitted to it.
  That's okay.
  I don't have, and I, and no one,  I have no reason to believe this  just beyond my own thinking of it.
  So I was already in the mindset of like,  oh, they're going to try it again.
  What if this Will Smith thing, another envelope thing,  which is fake in my mind.
  Do you, do you, do you have a full theory  that like they sent Warren Beatty out there  with the wrong envelope and just like hung them out to dry?  I think Warren Beatty is probably in on it.
  Oh yeah, okay.
  And I think there's probably a very small handful  of people that are in.
  If this is, if this is.
  Right, right.
  I'm just wondering what your theory is.
  I base it just on the idea that I've watched 20 years  or more than that worth of Oscars.
  This has never happened.
  There's never been a, an envelope mix up  in the entire history of the awards.
  And it happens to happen during Best Picture  on a year when, when semi prankster Jimmy Kimmel  was hosting.
  It was like, everyone's like,  and the only reason it's not come out is  because the initial response was not positive.
  If the initial response was, wow, that was super fun,  then, but the initial response was no Moonlight,  an important American film was robbed chance.
  It's, it's, it's proper chance.
  Those are bad optics for sure.
  Yeah, and it's kind of the more bubble gum movie.
  Like, like there's sort of different films.
  So you can't rot.
  Like, so there's someone making songs  in the show and there's lists here.
  It's kind of weird.
  Yes, but I think that was the, that was the reason was like,  oh, this movie's, this movie should have had its own moment.
  And instead the Moonlight people had to share the stage.
  Oh my God, this back, I think it backfired.
  I think it was a prank that backfired.
  This is, this is some conspiracy stuff  I'm spreading on your show.
  Yeah, this is like Alex Jones stuff.
  Hey, come on guys.
  Have you really, what are the chances  that the long walker make it out to the stage?  Ah!  Well, thank you for presenting your theories.
  I, what other questions did I have for you about this?  Oh, oh, in terms of like your,  when you, like growing up and watching the Oscar,  do you, was there one that you recall as being like,  that you, where you kind of like came to,  like this one where like, oh, I like watching this.
  It feels like your initial idea  of what a classic Oscar telecast is.
  Yeah, the truly the best, the best Oscars  and the best award show I've ever seen period  is Billy Crystal in 1992.
  Yeah.
  So this would have been for the movies of 91.
  And this is the year that he did,  he came out as Hannibal Lecter.
  Yes.
  And he did a medley,  it was the second time he'd done the medley,  but he did it, it was like just a fun medley.
  It was the Jack Palance pushups.
  And it was the best joke.
  And they've since recounted this,  him and the Lanchard people have recounted this  enough to where I don't like it anymore.
  But at the time it was very funny where Hal Roach gets up  and he introduces Hal Roach,  who's the great silent film director.
  And Hal Roach like gives a speech where he can't,  he gives it off mic.
  So the whole thing.
  I like you, I like you, I like you.
  And then Billy Crystal's response is that was appropriate  since Hal began his career in silent film.
  And that brings back.
  And so when I saw that as a kid, I was like, wow,  this is a real, it was a genuinely entertaining show.
  I mean, I know everybody has like conflicted thoughts  about Billy Crystal now, but like he hosted that.
  And when Ellen DeGeneres hosted the first Emmys  after 9-11 were like genuinely really great hosting jobs.
  Like I can point to it's that.
  And maybe like when John Waters,  there's been like when John Waters  did the independent spirit awards,  like there's a handful of like hosting jobs where you're like,  well, those were really good,  but that one was like a really good show, 92.
  That's exactly my answer to it.
  And especially, and I was of the right age  and being like a Disney kid as we all were,  that's the year of beauty and the beast.
  So it's all those songs.
  So they're big songs,  which has like almost immediately stopped being the case.
  Like, I don't, I can't remember when a popular song won the,  or was even in competition for it.
  They're all like weird.
  Sometimes it's almost like they don't do the category,  but that year it's like huge songs,  Sons of the Lambs, huge, every movie's huge.
  Did something from Beauty and the Beast win best song?  I think Beauty and the Beast.
  But it was three of the five were from Beauty and the Beast.
  It was always, and then like the Disney ones won,  I feel like every, the Disney ballads.
  Yes, which always upset me as a kid.
  Cause you like the more fun ones.
  I wanted Under the Sea to win.
  I wanted Be Our Guest to win.
  Did Under the Sea win?  It may have won.
  I think it might have.
  But from then on it was always.
  Kiss the Girl wasn't enough of a,  wait, no, or was it, did Party Your War?  I don't know.
  Like Hakuna Matata did in the wedding.
  Hakuna Matata did not.
  No, no.
  Circle of Life probably.
  Or Can You Feel the Love Tonight?  Jason, Look at our Love Tonight.
  That's what it was.
  I'm looking up Little Mermaid.
  I can only do one at a time.
  I, you know what's a funny one is that  Colors of the Wind won over  You've Got a Friend in Me.
  The Randy Newman ones are really spotty.
  Oh, interesting.
  Where it's less popular, Randy Newman ones won.
  But in looking at, in general,  looking at clips of the last 20, 25 years,  I think Randy Newman has performed every year.
  Since, you always have.
  Did Randy Newman win for Michael or something?  Yeah, probably.
  Oh, here, Jordan's got it.
  That's Under the Sea winning.
  Okay, Under the Sea did win.
  With Dudley Moore and Paula Abdul presenting.
  Wow.
  What a pair.
  Original score and original song.
  Oh, Little Mermaid.
  So it got two.
  Yeah.
  But I think you had the ballads from then on.
  Kiss the Girl was nominated.
  Sure.
  It's a fun one.
  Kiss the Girl.
  Kiss the Girl.
  Morgan Freeman's Kiss the Girl.
  That should have been that.
  The original Alex Cross adventure.
  One of the great, one of the great notes.
  Tyler Perry took over the role.
  Is that what that is, really?  Tyler Perry played Alex.
  Kiss the Girl's the same thing.
  It's the same book series.
  Kiss the Girl, Along Came a Spider.
  Oh.
  And Alex Cross.
  Alex Cross, yeah.
  Oh, wow.
  I didn't know that.
  Okay, so in terms of,  let's just start diving in here.
  And I'm excited to have you for this, Ryan, also.
  Because I feel like you're, you are a cinephile.
  You're a fan of high art.
  And we tend to gravitate to the lowest.
  Gutter.
  Yeah, we tend to.
  Waterless toilet full of art.
  I like the toilet, I like it all.
  Ryan likes the toilet.
  But that's where, these things, I think,  really square off on the Oscar stage.
  And especially did, we're gonna be so 80s centric here,  I feel.
  And I'm gonna start there with one.
  I couldn't not do this one.
  And this might already answer the question,  what's the most theme parky thing  that ever happened on the Oscars?  And for this, I go to 1988.
  Jordan, I believe the file is Peewee One.
  Do you guys know this offhand?  Can you picture Peewee Herman's Oscar appearance?  I think I've seen this, yeah.
  Okay.
  Yeah, this is like, I mean,  this is like designed to get five-year-olds in  and watching it for the rest of their lives.
  It's so crazy.
  Oh, wait, I'm sorry, stop it for a second.
  The context here is that Peewee Herman  is presenting an award,  but he's been, a PA has come on stage  and whispered in his ear that there is a giant robot  that is making his way to the theater.
  And he says, yeah, I'm so sure.
  And then goes about his business,  and then this happens.
  It's Ed 209 for the listeners.
  Roll the cop when you need one.
  Oh my God.
  Oh.
  Ed 209 is now shooting,  and Peewee is flying up into the rafters.
  Peewee can fly is what we're learning.
  Ed 209 is, by the way,  open fire on the audience of the Oscar.
  Yeah, he's pointed more at them than at Peewee.
  Yeah.
 And either way,  he's hitting people in the balcony.
  Yeah, no, this is a mass shooting.
  Yeah.
  This is more deadly of an event than in RoboCop  and in the conference room.
  Massive body count.
  The choice to make him fly in that is the fun.
  I mean, I like everything that happens.
  I think that's a great, if I saw that today,  I would eat my shorts.
  That's a terrific little bit.
  It's really fun.
  That's just fun for all ages.
  It's just good.
  If you want to see a little of the aftermath of Peewee 2,  Jordan, just to see it in reverse, RoboCop does appear.
  You'll be happy to know.
  And I skipped most of the extremely analog,  old TV mixer laser fight that occurs.
  It's the wimpiest laser beams you've ever seen,  but it really goes and goes.
  And then, do we have the clip?  Let's see what it is.
  It's like it's a laser that using a Johnny Carson sketch.
  Johnny Carson sketch.
  Thanks, RoboCop.
  All right, Peewee.
  It's safe to continue giving the award now.
  Thanks, RoboCop.
  It's silence.
  RoboCop just in the aisle.
  Doesn't know his exit.
  Peewee just lowers slowly.
  He should have been sitting somewhere.
  It's cool if Peter Weller would have  reprised his role though for the little appearance.
  I mean.
  That's good.
  I mean, John Wick should interrupt the Oscars or something.
  Yeah.
  Like, yeah.
  That'd be awesome.
  They should do stuff like that.
  Yeah.
  You know what?  We're all so concerned, like as if nominating  the right movie is gonna get everybody excited.
  Like, and then it's not gonna win.
  You know, like what's the Top Gun Maverick nomination  actually gonna do in terms of like,  oh, there's movies people like it.
  What they need is Maverick crash landing  in the theater.
  Mini like drone control planes racing through.
  When I was a kid, I never thought like,  why isn't Batman nominated for best picture?  Like, it's nominated for like visual effects or something  and then that's when you see Batman.
  Like there is a time and place in the ceremony  as that was for RoboCop to show up.
  Right.
  And they would make a point.
  I don't know that they do that kind of thing anymore.
  They should have Maverick crash landing in the theater.
  And then Tom Hanks's Colonel Tom Parker should try to,  you put on a hell of a show and he should try to do  all 10 accents he does as one character.
  I did not kill everybody.
  It is not true.
  Singing to Santa Claus, singing.
  This is not, why are they giving away golden statues?  They have not sung Santa Claus.
  My pitch for a movie actually is Tar versus  Colonel Tom Parker.
  Maybe they can do that at the show though.
  It's like start with, she's like conducting,  like open on her conducting and then Tom,  and then Colonel Tom comes out and says,  no, no, no, she will not,  Tar will not conduct Santa Claus.
  You sing rocking around Christmas tree.
  That is what you do.
  He picks up the same baton.
  For him it goes limp.
  And then all that he tries, I will do it myself.
  And then all the tubas.
  I love, they should, like, you know what?  Well, it's clear what they have to do.
  They gotta get Bruce.
  There's only one way out of the mess.
  Like when you think about when did the Oscars  start going off the cliff?  I don't know exactly when he stopped working on them,  but I can only, you know, he hasn't been doing it  since the early 2000s probably.
  Does he have a credit?  This is a good question.
  We've looked this up, I think.
  And it feels like he has it, but maybe again,  Jason, you have to look this up.
  When did Bruce stop?  Yeah, well I know that he,  because I read an oral history of it recently.
  Get Bruce's information.
  Let's get him down here right now.
  We should get him on here.
  If you don't know also, Bruce,  but we should probably contextualize Bruce Vellanche  the kind of like.
  I don't think your audience needs a context.
  Yeah, okay, bye, after.
  He comes up every three episodes anyway.
  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
  I just said it, maybe I said it for the first time  that Ryan and I have seen Mr.
 Vellanche perform live  as the Widow Twanky.
  Yes, yeah.
 That's true.
  That's true, Mike and I had a special day  many years ago in Aladdin Live.
  And do you remember what happened at the brunch before?  What news you received on your phone?  Yes, it was a Sunday morning  that we saw Aladdin's winter wish.
  And right before we went in,  I remember I looked at my phone  and Peter O'Toole had just died.
  It wasn't just a text that said he is risen.
  No.
  It wasn't just a text that said he is risen.
  No, no, it wasn't that.
  Well, and if we're addressing tales of this nature,  I think I've told you, Ryan,  the tale of you meeting Wallace Shawn  has been told on the show more times  than I could possibly count.
  You've been a presence in the show ever since five years ago  when you did it by this story being told over and over.
  I think it's where Five Timers came from.
  Five Timers for us, Ryan, are not people  who've been on the show five times.
  Stories that have been told five times.
  A lot of times when I'm saying something,  I'm like, oh, this is one of the things that makes Scott mad.
  Like if I bring up Brian Setzer,  if I bring up Green Day or something,  I know for sure, like I'm in the middle of it,  but I'm like, well, you know, I'm telling you about it.
  I wandered right into retelling the Wallace Shawn,  Andre Gregory story.
  And he was like, you've told this before.
  And I went, what?  I thought it was just, like, I had no idea.
  I had told it this many times.
  So it's just something I say.
  Also, because some of these things  are also told in our day to day life.
  Sure.
  Oh, sure.
  It might not be Five Timers on the show,  but I have heard them in person so many times  as opposed to the clown.
  I had such a good time seeing you go up to them  and talk to them and then the whole experience.
  It was not even Gregory's birthday.
  It was his birthday.
  We all sang happy birthday.
  We all sang, you thought about getting a piece of cake,  but I think you decided not to.
  Oh, okay.
  Which would have probably been fine, honestly.
  We all should have gotten cake.
  It was like a group of 20 people.
  We were just like standing there to say hello to them  or something.
  And we realized we were in the middle  of a birthday celebration for Andre Greger.
  Yeah.
  Yeah, that would have been a good,  I don't know why we didn't do that.
  I know, I feel a little regretful of it.
  I liked that little, that piece of it  where a detail that was important to you, Mike,  and that you've told every time it's been told,  Ryan thought about getting a piece of cake and then didn't.
  Or something that didn't register with Ryan himself.
  Well, he.
  And then here's what makes it a great story.
  Yeah, but it does make it a great story though.
  It does really, the idea that I thought about eating cake  and then really kicks it up a notch.
  I think it does.
  I guess it indicates your respect for these men  such that you would not.
  Yes, you don't want to suspect them.
  Wait, so what do you find,  what is the best part of the story?  It was how excited I was?  Well, I think,  Well, first of all, it's Walsh-Sean  being part of it at all.
  I love Walsh-Sean.
  Because another thing that's happened on the show,  you have argued to no one about,  I've watched you go like,  and if you don't think Walsh-Sean is great,  then fuck you.
  Like you've argued to no, to an invisible party about like,  I think I have,  you want to tell me Walsh-Sean isn't great  in Haunted Mansion?  He's always great.
  Well, I was yelling at Jason in that.
  Yeah, yeah.
  I've read a few of, during lockdown,  I read a few Walsh-Sean books.
  So I started to appreciate Mike Stewart's a little more.
  It's gone to a different level,  especially that play that you all saw.
  This is what you'd say about a grandparent.
  Now I have the context to know that they've lived in a chain.
  I shouldn't roll my eyes at his stories.
  I used to think grandpop stories were boring and bland,  but then I realized the wisdom he was trying to impart.
  I'll take it, honestly.
  I'll answer the, I jumped on the,  what makes it,  what is the crucial part of the story for you?  Well, okay, there's a,  I don't want to rehash the whole thing  because there's so much stuff I loved about the situation,  including that Armand Schimerman was sitting behind us,  who played Quark on Deep Space Nine.
  Oh, that part makes it come up a lot.
  And I peed next to him,  and then at the middle of this, again,  this is, I've said this on the show before,  but it, in the middle, at intermission,  Armand stood up and he goes,  huh, I thought it was over.
  Well, I guess we'll just see what happens next.
  Which is so funny.
  He forgot how a play works.
  He forgot how to play.
  He clearly was done.
  It was a long first half.
  Yeah.
  Quark doesn't know how plays work.
  Mike pees with Quark.
  I peed with Quark, which is so fun.
  I love him.
  He's one of the best characters.
  He's great.
  All of that was fun.
  It's fun seeing it in a small theater.
  And then we were,  just ended up in this little celebration,  and I was just delighted by the whole situation.
  I was delighted by it.
  I haven't been back to the Red Cat in COVID times,  but at that same theater,  I don't think it was this performance.
  It was a different performance.
  I saw Philip Baker Hall.
  Oh yeah.
  And he was on Oxygen, and he was in his,  he was, he died not that long ago,  but I also saw him there, attending a play once,  and said hello to him.
  He was very gracious as well.
  You had to say hi to him before you went.
  Yeah, that's cool.
  Yeah, that's a little secret.
  I think that's kind of a,  if you want to see like really great actors,  go see plays at the Red Cat, you'll see.
  Cause a very small, I mean small theater.
  It's a small theater,  but they do like plays by the Wooster Group,  and like, it's like,  you'll see sometimes stars on stage,  but a lot of times respected actors in the audience  watching, I feel like.
  Right, wow.
  Where's the, what city is Rick heading?  It's like downtown, it's by the Disney Concert Hall.
  It's like, it's connected to that big structure.
  Oh, gotcha.
  And then maybe you'll get to eat cake,  or think about eating cake with one of the actors.
  If you're lucky, you will get to consider cake.
  You get to look at cake.
  And then I think you came back and said,  Andre Gregory was telling somebody like,  you must come up to the cabin sometime.
  That's a good quote, that's a good quote.
  I think you did a good impression on much better.
  You did a very good impression of him,  as my memory is full.
  Anyway.
  Okay.
  Let me throw this out into what we were talking about  before that sidetrack.
  Ryan, what you said about like,  you knew that the silly stuff would happen  in the effects categories.
  This isn't the funniest clip in the world,  but I wonder if you'll remember it.
  This to me is the epitome of what you're talking about.
  That like, with those ones, that they feel technical,  but it's about the big movies that everybody likes,  and we have a little fun with these.
  Can we show the clip Elijah?  Does anyone remember this offhand?  I don't think I know this.
  May I have the envelope?  Young Elijah Wood.
  Oh wow.
  What's that sound?  Oh!  Oh!  It's a T-Rex poking out from.
  That's a big build.
  Yeah.
  You can kind of feel the flatness.
  I think this is, you know, a facade style.
  They only did one side of it, but it's huge.
  Yeah.
  You got the context when little Elijah Wood walked up.
  That's little Anna Paquin there.
  Little Anna Paquin who won.
  I don't know what that award was going to, Jurassic Park.
  But Anna Paquin won that.
  The one that year won for the piano.
  Yeah, yeah.
  Big year for kids.
  Big, big year for kids.
  Big year for kids.
  That's fun.
  That's Elijah.
  Let's see, he would have been coming off  the good son probably.
  Yeah.
  With old Mac.
  Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
  I think I was surprised that wasn't Mac.
  I assume Mac had his Oscar, he must have done.
  I'm sure Mac had an Oscar moment at some point.
  Well, Jason, do you have a say?  I feel like you got a list brewing or something.
  Do you want to throw in something?  I need a few.
  If you have, do you want to jump to 98?  Sure.
  Yes.
  Okay, let's jump to 1998.
  This is, I looked this up, this was the year  the most viewers, like the highest rated.
  So 50 million people tuned in.
  Is this the Titanic?  Yeah, this is the Titanic here.
  And I think one thing I think about the Oscars,  you mentioned the State of the Union, Ryan.
  This time of year, it's like State of the Union  Super Bowl Oscars.
  And I feel like I just always kind of related that,  of these are live events, everyone's gonna watch  these sorts of things.
  All equally exciting.
  All equally exciting.
  Well, look, the Oscars was most exciting to me.
  But when it comes down to viewers, the Super Bowl in 98  had 90 million viewers and the Oscars had 50 million.
  And so I think that used to be the norm,  a little bit like 50%.
  And.
.
.
  Now it's like negative 12 million.
  Now it's like, the Super Bowl has held steady  and gone up to like 110, 120 million a few times.
  And the Oscars last year, I think was 16 million.
  Wow.
  Yeah.
  And it's grimmer and grimmer.
  I mean, as with, you know, Ryan, we watched  the train station Oscars together.
  Which turned out to be a train wreck Oscars.
  Not because of the movie either.
  That wasn't that year.
  No, that was the most.
.
.
  Then you hear the numbers and you're like,  of course no one watched.
  Why would anyone?  I think it's hard to come back.
  Honestly, after Union Station, it's hard to come back.
  You can't keep them, you can't get them back on the farm  after you've been to Union Station  with the glen clothes twerking.
  And that was the fun part.
  That was the only bit of fun.
  That was the only, that was like the slice of cake  they considered having.
  As good as it got.
  But better times, 98.
  Yeah.
  Jordan, if you can pull up the first clip.
  So just to set everyone up,  Billy Crystal comes out on a big Titanic.
  He's like up by the ceiling.
  Of course.
  And then the ship sinks.
  But while sinking, it gently lowers him to the stage.
  So it kind of serves two purposes.
  And there's just like two song moments in this  that really stuck out to me.
  I think the Oscars too, were a good demonstration of like,  when the culture was much more of like a mono culture,  with like, here's the reference point,  and everyone in the crowd knows what they're referencing.
  Sure.
  Oddly, the only thing that's gotten us back to that  is the slap.
  Yeah, it is.
  Finally, the thing at the Oscars  is the only thing everyone was talking about.
  Yeah.
  But back then.
  My films nominated for best picture are,  The Judge, Right Back to the Theater,  The Tale of a Giant Ship,  that started many years ago with an over budget script.
  20 year old show.
  The Borg was a loud director man,  who made accountants sick.
  Two studios teamed up to pay for a three hour flick.
  Everybody got three hour flick.
  That's good, like what else?  That's so clean.
  People like it.
  Yes.
  And then.
  Some other films deserve a break,  like My Giant in Three Weeks,  My Giant in Three Weeks.
  Oh, that's a room for My Giant.
  I've gotta tip my hat to Gilligan,  the skipper to.
  That's Jimmy Cameron.
  Jimmy Cameron, yeah.
  The propeller guy and the eye.
  The movie star, the professor and Marianne,  here on Oscar's Big Night.
  Yeah, going well.
  So like that, it is clean.
  It's very clean.
  Everyone gets it.
  It works.
  There's a classic like,  and then you just leave the last one in the list,  is just the actual one.
  Yeah.
  That's exactly what I would do in anything similar to that.
  It's funny to not change it.
  Replacing the wife,  and his wife with the ice.
  Ice.
  It's really funny.
  It's really slick.
  Well, this is a question maybe,  is where does,  because I've been grappling with this in my own head,  where do we all fall in terms of,  do we like the Billy Crystal medleys?  What's, where do you put it in terms of ironic like,  or just like?  Do you even know?  That's a good question.
  Yeah.
  Because we loved it when we were,  I mean, we would look forward to it.
  Loved it, we paid, everyone got it.
  I think, you know, it's a few crossovers  with theme parks for me where it's like,  oh, I know the reference before I saw the thing.
  Like I knew this joke about Gilligan's Island at Titanic  before I ever saw Titanic.
  I have to give credit for,  I have to say that these like,  Mark Shaman arrangements are good.
  Like they're, they're like,  they flow in a way,  like as to whether or not these are good or bad,  like lyrically they're corny or whatever.
  They, they're not always like the most inspired,  but like I do like listening to them as well.
  Like, you know.
  And he pulls them off music  and it utilizes the full orchestra that's always there  and sounds great.
  And it makes it feel like elevate,  it doesn't feel like some talk show bit  because there's a grandeur to the orchestra,  to the stage.
  And soon to have a theme park credit to his name  because he was one of the people  behind Rodgers musical from Hawkeye  that they're putting in California Adventure.
  Mark Shaman is really?  Yeah.
  Wow.
  Okay.
  I mean, he's good.
  Yeah, everything his name is on is good.
  Ryan, when you,  I don't know if it was last year when you were doing this,  but you, you were like ranking the Billy Crystal songs  on Instagram,  Yeah.
  which was a delight.
  And to see ones that you particularly responded to,  do you recall what was number one?  I don't offhand.
  Number one was the Full Monty was in the top.
  It might've been like number three or two.
  And it wasn't really ranked by the best.
  It was more ranked by what like was lodged in my head.
  It was more like a subjective rating of like,  of a line.
  And if I think about it sometimes while I'm driving  or something that it's the thing,  but number one was the year it was the,  he had done all the movies for 1990.
  It was in 93.
  So it would have been the movies in 92.
  So it's unforgiven, few good men or whatever.
  So he sings unforgiven.
  If it's to the line,  it's to the music of unforgettable.
  Unforgiven a few good men sent of a woman,  the crying game.
  And if you get a man,  that's the list of all five nominees.
  Now before I slide down on my knees,  da da da da da da da da da da da da da,  Mr.
 Saturday night.
  And everyone's like,  which he was plugging at the time.
  The film.
  And there was talk that maybe he would,  the film would be up for Oscar.
  I think David Paymer did get an Oscar nomination for it.
  Oh really?  But, but, but yeah.
  And so he was, it was this thing.
  It was just so raw.
  Yeah.
  Him wanting that, that, that, you know,  a joke, but also like I made it.
  It's kind of like my giant, you know, kind of like.
  Right.
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
  Very, very bald, I guess.
  The one that I think I told you this  when you were posting those,  the one that's lodged in my head forever.
  And I couldn't even remember what movie it was for,  but it was, it was George Clooney for sure.
  And I mean, now I know what it is,  but the song I just remembered was  George is cracking up because his wife is shacking up.
  George is cracking up because his wife is shacking up.
  And then he's got in a comatose.
  And I don't remember it from there.
  Yes.
  Yeah.
 That's the private descendants.
  The descendants.
  And I had to look, I only,  I only in a list later did I realize that's like,  that's some Hawaiian hits, like pops.
  That's like a Don Ho kind of song.
  Oh, the Hawaiian tie.
  Or it's, or it's too like a traditional Hawaiian song.
  I don't, I don't know exactly, but like, yeah,  I couldn't place the melody on.
  Isn't it in the Tiki Room, I think that song?  Dun ka dun ka dun ka dun ka dun ka.
  Maybe.
 I think so.
  I don't know the name of it,  but it's, I think in a lot of stuff.
  I, this brings me to a question that I had,  and I wonder if we could, if we could just do,  put on our writer, put on our Bruce hats.
  Do we think that we could think of a plausible  Billy Crystal song for this year's nominees?  And I say that, and I don't think we,  we don't have to flesh out the whole thing.
  Just be the vaguest idea of it.
  And with this, I don't mean to make it tougher  to tie your hands behind your backs,  but I remind you of the Billy Crystal rules,  which are it, preferably a song from before 1959.
  Oh, okay.
  And, and if possible, you know,  with the Jonah Hill one being the exception,  a song that is nice to the people involved.
  Right.
  And he likes them.
  Yeah.
  That's just, that's just, that's just bonus points.
  But does any, at this point,  what you gotta do is just like,  and I don't look, I don't know a lot of these songs,  but if we, maybe we can work backwards from like  the Cole Porter catalog or a song from a musical.
  Yes, you have to know the great American song,  Rodgers and Hammerstein song.
  That would help.
  Like my favorite things.
  I know we did once.
  I think if we can think of a,  just a song from a musical at all,  I think we could go backwards.
  Yes.
  Well, okay.
  Let's just take a title.
  What's a title from this year?  With Bright.
  What are the movies?  And then, and then rhyme it with something from there.
  Well, Tar has, oh, thank you, Jordan.
  Oh my God.
  Oh, All Quiet on the Western Front.
  Okay.
  Women Talking.
  Okay.
  Oh, here, let me, well, let me admit it guys.
  Cause since I came in with this in the pocket,  I did, I did this, this thought exercise  on the couch there in a little while ago.
  And she said, oh, you know what,  what about like a boogie woogie bugle boy?  And I thought for a second, and then I think,  wait, can I remember it?  I think it was, oh, it's there,  the fuss and feud and fable men's of Phoenix AZ.
  All right.
  Now you're talking.
  But don't let me take fable men's off the table.
  Oh sure, yeah.
  You know, Tar, there's a lot of rhyme schemes for,  everything everywhere all at once.
  I think, I think there's probably something in like,  you're the top gun maverick.
  You're the top, I think that's Cole Porter.
  And whatever, and we're gonna give you no static.
  You know, and you're the top Tom, we love you Tom.
  Yes, we genuinely love you Tom.
  The song was nice.
  You would only agree to be here  if we didn't make any Apatow style jokes about you.
  I actually thought of one for top gun maverick as well,  which is, okay, it was,  start cheering for Cruz.
  Tom's flying the planes.
  Oh man.
  He wants to bring the theaters back, maverick, maverick.
  I should have texted you guys, we could have come in.
  I cheated here.
  You were, yeah.
  Is there one for like, does anything,  oh, go ahead, Jason.
  I think I have one for Avatar,  but it's a little bit of a journey.
  Sure.
  Like the film itself.
  Like the journey.
  Yeah.
  Again, Cole Porter song to lovely.
  It's delightful, it's delicious, it's the Navi.
  I think that's great.
  That's right on.
  Thank you.
  What about like the lonely goat from Sound of Music,  like lonely Eekron or mighty Eekron.
  The mighty Eekron, yeah, assuming.
  I mean, if you use that phrase.
  Like, oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Eekron.
  And you can switch it to the, what's the other,  the animal, wait, the, wait, the whale is the,  Pyocon is what, why am I not remembering this?  Wait, Pyocon.
  Toqun.
  Oh, the Toqun, yeah.
  Yeah, well, you could go through all the ee-hoo and toqun.
  That's how you switch it up.
  I would also propose a Gershwin,  like someone to watch over Navi.
  Does anything scan with Oklahoma?  Yeah, maybe.
  Could you, well, you could just do,  I mean, you would think maybe he would do Elvis  with an Elvis song, but I kind of like the idea.
  I think that would be the cheat.
  It would be, yeah, like, right, you know.
  But you could also just like, oh, it's Elvis.
  It's the most fun movie of the year.
  That's what he would do.
  The plot lures great, but look at Tom Hanks' waist.
  Okay, how about this?  And I hate to break the rules of this, but.
  You can, I mean.
  But the song is over 20 years old,  and it is another thing I say sometimes to annoy Scott.
  This Everclear song, Everything to Everyone,  comes into play.
  Or like, damn.
 Maybe Billy's daughter would.
  Damn, damn, damn.
  You think that you're everything to everyone.
  All at once.
 All at once.
  The idea that he would do that.
  I like the idea that Billy Crystal,  like what are some of the newer songs?  Yeah.
  This is when you're writing for it.
  Oh, I know, Everclear.
  Oh, well, this is one of the hottest  everybody's still talking about, Everclear.
  This is one of the hottest rock and roll songs  around, Mr.
 Crystal.
  Okay, good, I'll go home.
  I'll look at it.
  Send me a tape.
  Oh, listen.
  You do what you do.
  You go to the parallel universe.
  You try to go everywhere.
  I had another thought also,  which is that you would do,  like, you know, it's about a conductor,  so you could just go to Tar, Tar, Tar, Tar.
  Oh, yeah, you could do a classical.
  Well, Beethoven is definitely more than,  older than 1959.
  Tar, Tar, Tar, Tar, Tar, Tar.
  She didn't.
  She made her.
  And then Crystal.
  And now she's dead.
  She's getting canceled.
  She's getting canceled.
  How about, I mean, it's not that old of a song,  but like women talking around the sewing circle,  women talking.
  And you know.
  Oh, Pretty Woman.
  Pretty Woman.
  Oh, no, I think he would do early rock and roll.
  I think now that's what he would bring fresh to the table  for the 2020s.
  Yes, he'd be like.
  He's doing rock and roll now.
  Right, right.
  I like that.
  Any other quick hits before?  Are we missing?  No, wait, we got them all on screen right now.
  The Banshees, that's just a weird title.
  You know.
  You got to learn how to.
  It's something about like, inner Sharon, is that right?  I don't know how to say inner Sharon.
  Like, I can't think of the song, though.
  I feel like there's jokes,  so I feel like I've heard that title said  multiple different ways.
  Yeah, inner Sharon, and Sharon, inner Sharon.
  You say inner Sharon.
  I say inner Sharon.
  I say inner Sharon.
  You say inner Sharon.
  Inner Sharon.
  Let's call the whole flick great.
  That's a, all right.
  Wow.
  We put on our Bruce hats.
  All right, all right.
  That's wonderful.
  Some of these, a more recent host,  I always love the joke,  when Hugh Jackman did a musical medley,  and they were just doing a weird dance,  and he said, the reader,  I didn't see the reader.
  That was really funny.
  That was a great joke.
  Yeah, and it catches, I like when he laughed while doing it.
  I think Jackman was kind of, who we liked lately.
  Do we like, I've liked all the Kimmel, I'm happy it's.
  Yeah.
  I'm happy it's Kimmel, because for the first time,  we will get a joke on the Oscars about the slap.
  Yes, all right.
  I like it when there's a host.
  That's what lately what I enjoy.
  Controversial stance.
  When there's any host present.
  For some reason, Kimmel does it twice,  and then they go, all right,  we need to lay off the whole host thing.
  Yeah.
  After that envelope that he did the first time,  but not the second.
  Why did the host disappear?  Now they're just back to him.
  Yeah, yeah.
  Really strange.
  I was looking up some older ones,  because I was trying to think pre-Billy Crystal,  and they were much more reserved affairs,  usually Johnny Carson hosting,  and he would get some lines in,  but then there were some weird moments, like 1981.
  The day it was supposed to happen,  John Hinckley Jr.
 shot Ronald Reagan.
  And so they pushed the ceremony 24 hours,  but then in a weird turn of events,  they already had a pre-taped welcome from Ronald Reagan.
  So Johnny Carson is talking about Reagan  being in a hospital room and requesting a TV  so that he could watch the Oscar ceremony,  and then they cut to a videotape  where he's in the West Wing,  talking about the magic of the movies.
  And it was just very weird.
  The other weird-  From the bottom of my intact heart.
  Yeah.
  That's when they said,  we're going to cut to a video of Mr.
 Rao.
  I was like, oh my God, is he in a emergency room?  We're gonna cut to him in the middle of surgery.
  Yeah.
  And just so you know, Jodie Foster didn't,  she's not impressed, sir.
  Yeah.
  America Soldier's on.
  Mission not accomplished.
  But 11 years before, I found an odd segment  I didn't know about where Bob Hope and Fred Astaire  gave out best documentary and best documentary short.
  And this was purely a way to set up Bob Hope  to kind of pimp Fred Astaire into doing some dancing.
  And this is 1970.
  Fred Astaire was born in 1899.
  So he was 71 doing this.
  And he's still pretty good, but I was just like,  wait, how old is he when this is happening?  And the answer is he was 71.
  From the 1800s.
  Yeah.
 Wow.
  Terms of kind of questionable performances of that nature.
  I'm gonna head to some stuff that Ryan brought to the table.
  And this is 1983.
  And well, the first performer in this list  is Liza Minnelli, makes sense.
  This is how they open the shows with this musical number.
  Ryan, would you like to introduce the rest?  Oh yes, this is 1983.
  Now I actually don't know where, I think this sat  probably at the beginning of the show is where I think it does.
  I think so, yeah.
  The performers, it's a medley led by Liza Minnelli  who had done the show before.
  Natural, gifted, when you think of,  what basically Billy Crystal is parodying  to some degree is something that Liza Minnelli would do wonderfully.
  Yeah.
 Dudley Moore, who was her co-star in Arthur,  not a musical guy so much, but you know,  could choke his way through it.
  Richard Pryor and Ed Walter Mathau.
  And if you have the question, can those people sing?  Prepare for it to be answered.
  Let's do Liza Minnelli.
  There are thousands of craftsmen and women too loaded with technical skills.
  There was many a worthy crime.
  And also, and if it was a little unclear how that divided up,  Dudley Moore gets through his little part OK, but then he coughs  and then goes to Pryor who just doesn't, he loses it.
  Yeah, he does not have it.
  He's trying, he doesn't seem embarrassed or anything,  but he is just not.
  So why would you think of him to sing?  Yeah, so I'm more amazed at is why did they agree?  Like now no one agrees to anything and they're like, yeah,  we'll come out there and try to sing with Liza Minnelli.
  Yeah, I think a person now would be like, like my sense of I mean,  I was starting to bring this up earlier that Bruce,  I know that Bruce Philanche at least worked on the kind of notorious  Anne Hathaway, James Franco Oscars.
  And that one, I guess that 2011, I looked it up to that 2010,  2011, where the last one she was credited.
  Oh, well, OK, OK.
  That might have been the last one.
 Yeah.
  But I, you know, I mean, rightfully so given how it went,  it seems to me from this oral history of that one that I read,  and I was like very, very frightened and copped to it several times  during the show was just kind of out of her wheelhouse.
  And she can sing, though, and she was still and then prior,  just like, yeah, sure.
  Like zero nerves.
  What I would say is like the Anne Hathaway that failed might have been.
  I don't think that one failed as a failure of Anne Hathaway's hosting.
  If anything, she was the capable host.
  Yes.
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
  I don't know.
 I haven't gone back and rewatch it.
 Who would?  But like at the same time, it's like that probably maybe was maybe.
  I don't know.
 There was some element.
  She's she's if anything, she's closer to like Eliza Manelli,  who can like she can go out and carry the whole thing.
 Maybe.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
  That one, because I went and looked around for like,  are there clips of that for this episode?  And it's just kind of it's just that the whole thing is off.
  There's no moment that's the drug.
  Yeah.
 Mainly that just doesn't.
  No, no, I just like it's they aren't that crazy to look at.
  It's just even the oral history said it's not that one thing was really bad.
  It was like death by a thousand cuts.
  There's like a mood in the.
 Yeah, I remember that.
  Yes.
 The whole night versus like, yeah, doing something crazy.
  James Franco, I think like by the time he came out and dressed as a woman  or something or there was some kind of drag thing that didn't play.
  And by then, you're really not right.
  Well, this is what we got.
  This is the one idea that they agreed to.
  There's one more of can we play math out as a math prior to just to get one more  hit of that sweet math that was singing.
  I wouldn't have thought that the loser of the fun.
  I just didn't know what he like.
  Maybe he's like an old man.
  Maybe he knew how to sing.
  But then the answer is this.
  And what about tonight?  Now there were 2000 taxes and cummerbunds  waiting for people to wear and buy those are of Hello Dolly, by the way.
  Oh, right.
 Totally unfamiliar.
  Yeah.
 Come on, Bonzo.
  We look to the sky.
  But he's like singing to a different song.
  It's yeah, he's all he's got on beat.
  Pretty nice even tries to help her line says now.
  What do you think now? Now?  Now, now, now, wait.
  But but, you know, as as kind of disastrous as this is,  they just laugh their way through it and it's fine.
  And it's all made up for by what Ryan you alerted me to at the end of the clip.
  Can you play number three?  They didn't know the audience remembered this song by the time this thing happened,  which is just legit good that we explain the voting procedures.
  So here to read the rules, here's Mr.
 John Maschietta.
  Know that name off and you know who this is.
  The voting procedures work like this.
  All Academy members vote on nominations for the five pictures of the year.
  Oh, the fast talk.
 Yeah.
  Micro Machines.
  They remember sending those nominations.
  That's that you get you get the idea.
  I mean, that's just that's just funny.
  He gets a huge applause at the end.
  Ernest Borgnein loves it.
 He's like, ah, I love it.
  That was probably before the Micro Machines campaign.
  Ever even.
 Oh, yeah.
 Yeah.
  It might have just been like something he was doing for bits and  options or something.
 This guy.
  If campaigns are on the table, have flow.
  The progressive lady and the guy code Gecko have them come out together like, well,  we don't usually share the stage.
  We don't usually share the spotlight.
  Well, and the guy from the Hulu pool.
  Yeah, please.
 Oh, yes.
  Hulu executive before.
  Yeah.
 Let's get you out there.
  I'd love that.
  What does everyone here want to host the Oscars?  No.
 Sure.
 Would you do you like that?  It's really I'm asking you like as a kid, was that something you were like,  I like to do this as a kid?  Yes.
 Now, you know, it's just such a like trap.
  Like nobody comes out a lot like you're damned if you do damned if you die.
  And I think it's possible because of podcasts, the right.
  You guys could be asked.
  It's well, it's possible.
  We've I've been trying to get us to host the Theo Awards, the theme park awards.
  We've been turned down just even getting free tickets to it.
  I think a hosting trio could be in your future.
  And I think take any hosting job.
  I think host.
 I think when people like it's amazing to me that they can't find a  host for the Oscars.
 That is absolutely mind boggling.
  Right.
 That they that there's not comedians.
  And I'm sure there are.
 There has to be a small list.
  Don't you think? Yeah, I think the list.
  I think the list is too.
  The list is too small.
 Yeah.
  And and and too many people are too afraid of I don't know.
  I guess what happened there and it was just like one thing is going to be  pulled out and their career is going to be over, I guess.
 Right.
  You know what I think? I think they I bet what we don't know about  is that I wonder if they aim way big.
  Like you always hear they want Dwayne Johnson.
  Yeah.
 And then maybe they try that for four months and then it falls apart.
  And then they have to scramble.
  And then like people who actually would be good at it are not available  or they have to go to like their third choice on the I bet they lose a lot of time  pursuing.
 That's why Hathaway and Franco happened is that they were trying  Timberlake for a while.
 Oh, yeah.
  Yeah.
 Which would it because the whole idea was like who do young people like  like last time it was Steve Martin and Alec Baldwin, which was good also.
  Like that's a strange calculate.
  Then the next year they just completely flipped.
  I think the extra was Billy Crystal.
  Like, who cares? Oldest, oldest thing.
  Oldest back.
 Oldest new.
  Yeah.
 Oh, good.
  Well, I have a clip  from a way that the ceremonies used to begin,  you know, which was everyone arriving while a narrator  named who you're seeing.
  I love those.
  And I I forgot how much I liked them.
  And then I discovered a moment where I'm like,  well, this is a thing we bring up on the show.
  We like like the old Disney parades or like the old clips where it's like  the fifth Mickey, like it's not the A or B voice for Mickey.
  It's like the D or E voice they got.
 Oh, yeah.
  And this is kind of just one of those unscripted moments.
  Jordan, if you can bring up it's labeled 1996.
  And this is they're loading people in.
  The interviewer who is going so fast is Oprah Winfrey.
  This is not current, like last 10, 20 years, Oprah,  where she is sitting down and thoughtfully slowly conducting.
  She is rapid fire going like, who are you?  What are you wearing? What are you here for?  You know, that sort of thing.
  And she is talking to  Nicole Kidman and her then husband.
  Well, she's just talking to Nicole Kidman.
 OK.
 OK.
  Hello, Mr.
 Kidman.
 How are you?  To die for.
 That's what you look like tonight.
  Just to die for.
 And you were.
  What do you think?  You're presenting.
  Yeah.
 Yeah.
  Oh, my goodness.
  Introducing babe.
  Introducing babe.
 Yeah.
  How do you feel about that?  For the listener, Tom Cruise is back here saying nothing.
  Of course you do.
 Yeah.
  Love this choice of colors.
  Hasn't been acknowledged.
 Oh, thank you.
  So he's Tom Cruise standing there.
  He's got the biggest Cheshire grin on his face the whole time.
  At one moment, he had turned to a bandstand to wave.
  And you just hear dozens of people scream in excitement  because one of the most famous women in the world has waved to them.
  By the way, he has not been named on camera.
  Yeah.
 No acknowledgement.
  And but my favorite thing is that a very relatable, very human moment.
  He doesn't know where to stand.
  It's like he doesn't know where to go.
  Well, they organize these.
  Now these things are little sets and you have marks and everything.
  Yeah.
 It's a whole like geography is like they know exactly where they're moving people.
  And in some of the other footage, you can see people arrive  and suddenly like jump and wave to someone in the press crowd  in a very elegant gown.
  And it's it's clearly Joan Rivers.
  But that she used to be like the big exciting part of the pre-show coverage.
  But this footage was so funny because Oprah Winfrey is just talking to Nicole Kidman  and clearly wants to talk to Nicole Kidman.
  But it's just an odd run of questions.
  Like you're here to present, babe.
  She's like dissing.
 I mean, it's a kind of a diss.
  There's no way she doesn't recognize Tom Cruise.
  And then the very last question is, I have never seen you in that color.
  Like she's like commenting on the purple dress.
  Is this why Tom would later go on a jump on her couch in an angry manner?  You know what? I'm going to get your attention.
  I'm getting it now.
  On this show, Mama Needs a Movie that I do.
  We recently talked about Interview with a Vampire with Alan McCloud.
  And I was reminded of this is this is babe.
  This is 95 in 94.
  Tom Cruise went on Oprah and Oprah was like, I don't like this movie.
  Oh, she said she showed the movie to some whatever.
  They screened the movie for her.
  And the audience or whatever.
  She was like, I didn't like the movie.
  I walked out and prayed with my friends in the lobby.
  Really?  Oh, I think there was an I think that might be awkward.
  Oh, this is all tied together now for me.
  Oh, OK.
  This is key.
  They later made up with the couch.
  But I think that might be post Interview with a Vampire awkwardness.
  Wow.
  That's really fascinating.
  Yeah.
  Wow.
  Which seems so wrong.
  That adds another level to it.
  I just could not get over him just walking right through between the two of them.
  And then just it's just a big grin after he waves.
  And everyone just seems a little uncomfortable.
  Like everyone and Oprah is not doing a good job.
  That thing where you talk into the mic and then hold it over to someone.
  Yeah, you're not supposed to go like, so funny.
  Yeah.
  Yeah.
  Like, this is so beneath Oprah to be doing this.
  But all three of them are such like longtime professionals.
  It's just a weird like pick up.
  It's just a weird moment.
  Sure.
  Wow.
  Wow.
  Well, it was saved by the presence of Martin Landau, which drove the audience.
  Martin Landau.
  And that brought the ratings up.
  The stern face of Martin Landau.
  Oh my goodness.
  There's a little more Landau to come potentially.
  You might even see if you can spot a Landau later.
  Let me get to another thing that, Ryan, that you brought in, which let's go back to Crystal  and to jump around.
  And this will take us to the 2004 Oscars because we've talked about the opening numbers,  but we have not talked about the opening films where he felt very revolutionary at the time.
  That he's inserting himself into all that was like a new in his bag of tricks.
  That was a new trick.
  I feel like in the Titanic year, which made that one big too, that he's in Titanic.
  He's talking to the guy who drops off at the top.
  And I feel like the first few were great.
  But then this one 2004 were getting a little dicey, I feel.
  Yeah.
  And then they'll continue to be dicey after that.
  Well, yeah, this was I was searching for in particular 2000 because that was the year  that he did an American beauty parody.
  And that has been that scrubbed.
  That's really.
  Wow.
  Good luck finding that one.
  But this is 2003.
  This was the movies of 2003.
  So Lord of the Rings was the big movie and they kind of cut it, I think, more in a trailer  form.
  This is probably this is directed by Troy Miller of Dakota Pictures up the street.
  Yeah, this is I think this is from the ceremony that year.
  Yeah, and this is I just I cut it down to what I feel like are the crucial moments,  the moments that hold up the best.
  So here's the highlights of the 2004 opening.
  I must control.
  You must.
  They are counting on you.
  That's funny.
  I haven't been to the Oscars since they were taken over by the evil wizards.
  You mean the orcs?  No, the Weinsteins.
  He's blind in one eye, but I ain't deaf.
  Oh, no.
  2004 blackface.
  Now we're in the rings.
  Nothing would stop his journey back home.
  Stop this war.
  Shame on you hobbits.
  Shame on you.
  This is a fictitious war.
  This Lord was not elected by the pocket.
  Michael Moore shows up to be crushed.
  Yeah, that'll show him for wanting a war to end.
  Yeah, give me some advice.
  Light him up, Bill.
  And Jack hands the magic sunglasses, the magical sunglasses.
  This has several endings, I feel.
  Light him up.
  And then he puts them on.
  Kill him, baby.
  Is it kill him, baby?  Kill him, baby.
  Light him up, kill him, baby.
  Keep it all in, Troy.
  Keep every.
.
.
  I'm going to give you a lot of options.
  Keep them all in.
  Keep it all in.
  Keep that steady cam spinning and spinning.
  What's that contraption you're writing around on there?  It looks pretty cool.
  That's a segue.
  Interesting.
  This is full disclosure, and I'm not going to say anything here,  but there's a friend of ours, a friend of all of ours,  who worked on this exact opening.
  Oh.
  Who might be listening and worked on this and is flashing to a lot of memories,  and I am not in a position to tell their stories,  but I just want to broadcast this message that if you ever want to tell the stories  about the 2004 opening with Sammy Davis Jr.
 and the magical sunglasses,  we would hope that you would consider us to be the venue should you decide to go public.
  And you're not talking about Jack Nicholson.
  All right, fine.
  He started listening after we showed all those pictures.
  With him and the hoagie in the boat.
  Yeah, with him and the hoagie.
  That happened last week.
  He really likes that.
  So he's like, I love the attention, guys.
  Thanks for remembering your love.
  Finally, nobody's building me up these days.
  Yeah.
  By the way.
  Light them up, good boys.
  Jack Nicholson, primo seats at the 2012 Oscars and those 1970 Fred Astaire Oscars.
  Always.
  That's the thing.
  We love it.
  Jack's in the front.
  It is fun when Jack's in the front.
  It is exciting.
  Yeah.
  I won't lie.
  He ain't going to be in the front no more.
  When the days are over.
  Yeah, that's true.
  Mike, do you want to throw anything in?  Oh, yeah.
  I know you brought a couple clips.
  So both these clips, I think.
  So what I like about the Oscars, especially at this era of the Oscars, like 80s ish, is that  Hollywood has changed, but the Oscars hasn't.
  That's something that kind of is over now, but there's still obviously the music.
  They want musical.
  They want some schmaltz.
  But I feel like when I'm watching some old clips from 80s, I go, what the hell?  This guy's alive?  And then especially when they're talking about certain movies.
  Let's start with Jordan, the file named Liberace.
  This is 1982.
  And I was watching the 1982 Oscars.
  We are so far into punk.
  We're like beyond punk now.
  Well, right.
  So much has changed culturally.
  Right.
  And movies have changed.
  And we're still doing.
  I've read this over metal as in.
  Yeah, I've read, you know, I've read movies change in 1969.
  I've read the book, Easy Rider, Raging Bull, whatever.
  Yes, the rebel.
  I read the book.
  But it was of the celluloid back lot.
  It's 82 and Liberace is going to play a medley of all of the scores of the movies of the year.
  Light them up.
  So let's play this.
  Just a little bit of it, just because I like seeing Liberace.
  So he's played a little intro.
  He does a little joke up here.
  The theme from Rads.
  Thank you very much.
  Well, I've done my part for motion pictures.
  I've stopped making them.
  That joke goes pretty well.
  The writer of that screenplay, he's gone back to writing books.
  His name is Irving Wallace.
  No applause.
  What?  Smatter applause.
  He's just rolling through it.
  I never stopped attending them.
  In fact, ladies and gentlemen, I'm enchanted by the music.
  1982.
  I think it's consistently the most original music written today.
  Mr.
 Conti, will you help me remind everyone of this year's live comedy?  Bill Conti.
  Oh, yeah.
  Bill Conti, a lot of years.
  Beginning with Chariots of Fire.
  Well, that's cool.
  I mean, it's cool.
  I like it.
  And I don't have the full.
.
.
  You'll listen a little bit of this.
  Listen a little bit of this, but then Liberace is an awesome piano player.
  It's nice for him doing this.
  This is good.
  It's cool.
  This is good.
  And then he does all of these.
  This is the year Angolden Pond is nominated.
  iconic score.
  So I don't know.
  From Angolden Pond.
  I mean, this rules.
  I love this.
  The titular song by Joe Strummer.
  So you could stop playing it.
  And then he does.
.
.
  Stop making sense.
  I mean, I love it.
  But yeah, again, it's just like it's funny because he's old school Hollywood, but it's 82.
  Can I do one from 82?  Since we're talking about that.
  Oh, yeah.
  This is Ryan, actually.
  And another thing that I just think is good.
  This is from.
.
.
  Oh, what did I call it?  Did I call it Sheena Easton?  This is a performance of the Bond song for Your Eyes Only.
  One of my favorite.
  It could be my favorite Bond song.
  And they.
.
.
  Ryan, as you put it, this is a rare occasion.
  This is just the Oscars turn into a stunt show.
  This is close to a stunt show as I've ever seen it be.
  There's a little bit of song, but then things get real stunty.
  I wonder who produced it.
  Oh, yeah.
  And you got the real henchman, by the way.
  I don't know.
  I am not a Bond enough person to.
.
.
  Oh, yeah.
  The old.
.
.
  Richard Keele.
  He's the big tall guy.
  What a gown.
  Sheena.
  Morgan Discoey here in 82.
  Yeah.
  A car pulls up on stage.
  Is it Bond?  Who is it?  Well, it's a dancer.
  He does a kick.
  Maybe that's.
.
.
  I guess it's.
.
.
  Later you find out it's Bond, but he's in an orange jumpsuit.
  It's weird.
  He stabs someone with a sword.
  James Bond and his fucking sword.
  Lasers!  That's the same laser from.
.
.
  The RoboCop.
  RoboCop.
  Guitar wailing.
  James Bond.
  And it looks like the universal The Cone in the Barbarian stunt  show.
  It looks so much like that.
  It's multi-tiered.
  Whoever produced 82, I got to hand it to them.
  I like both of these things.
  When was the last time a fake punch was thrown at the Oscars?  I don't know.
  We know the real one.
  I know.
  We know the real one, but I just want to know.
.
.
  When was the last time a wrestling.
.
.
  You say a worked punch.
  Yeah.
  They don't pull punches.
  I think they did stop doing this kind of thing.
  Strong?  Yeah.
  I think everyone would like it.
  It's a bit like we're going to just do.
.
.
  The Avengers are going to fight on the.
.
.
  The Avengers should fight.
  None of them are famous.
  It's all just generic dancers.
  It's just dancers.
  Dancers are just pretending to fight with big high kicks.
  Just get the Rockettes to dress as the Avengers  and have them high kick each other.
  People would like it.
  Did you have another one, Mike?  Yeah.
 Let me go quickly.
  It's, I believe, 1987 and I was looking at some lists for things.
  I was just looking up bad Oscar moments.
  And the intro to 1987, which I had to do a little hunt for,  and I found it pretty easily.
  Again, sort of the juxtaposition of the movies that came out  versus wanting to do a big Hollywood number  of something that would be in the 40s or something.
  So I'll let this unfold.
  There's a lot of elements that I enjoy,  but you'll be able to tell pretty quickly  which ones I like.
  So there's the dancers.
  Star Trek 4 logo.
  And they're dancing on the movies that came out this year.
  And they're appearing behind him.
  So you have to listen to some of these.
  The fly.
  The fly is in the background as they're dancing like it's an old school.
  So listen to the, they'll start singing soon.
  It's Anna and her sisters in the back.
  Anna.
  Platoon.
  Platoon is Salvador.
  OK.
  And they're like, these dancers are like,  they're like dressed like newsies or something,  and they're shimmying and they're big high kicks.
  And we love platoon.
  So here we go.
  Here comes Dom DeLuis!  Telly Savalas!  Sloppy Telly!  I cleaned up for the big night!  Pat Morita!  Yeah!  Wow!  Does it seem a bit under-rehearsed?  Yeah!  This is a guys and  dolls reference.
  This is like Walter Mapp out singing  a regular song.
  Famously!  I'm a man of two  and platoon and got  blue velvet and salvador  Star Trek 4!  I want some more!  El Salvador!  And I'm here and this is Thursday  here!  This is 1987!  This isn't  1965!  This is 1987! Decades after  the Brando Sinatra  guys and dolls.
  Maybe there was a revival.
  Blue velvet came out this year!  The only  thing wrong with this is you shouldn't open  with a show stopper.
  How do you top it?  How do you top it?  We should have thought of that for  Billy Crystal.
 He would do  you got your western front, it's all quiet  here,  and the Germans are running in with diarrhea.
  She's tar!  She's tar!  That  is a song that you can  if you look on YouTube you can find a  million like high school productions of  guys and dolls.
 And that is an  opening number.
  That's like a great search to do.
  Were you in guys and dolls ever?  No I was not in guys and dolls ever.
  Unfortunately.
 But that is  very fun that people have cut  compilations together where you can just find  that element of the song.
  Because it's watching 15 year olds in  ill fitting suits try to do the  three people singing slightly  different things at once.
  It's very similar to  Dr.
 Deluise.
  You gotta get  telly.
 It's 1987.
  Who do we  gotta see?  I found that clip in there for some reason  like a browser closed.
  And then I was like searching for it.
  And I found  the opening when the hosts come out.
  And I go well Cheryl Ladd  and William Shatner hosted the Oscars  this year? And then I went oh wait this is a Golden Globes  show.
  I was like when did William Shatner host the Oscars?  Oh okay.
 Golden Globes.
  Got it.
  That goes to show you though what Billy Crystal  that's a really good context of  the Billy Crystal thing though.
  Of what it was reactionary  of what it was reacting against.
  So when Billy Crystal showed up and did what was  essentially an ironical version of that  it was  like a funny parody version.
  You forget that  context.
 I recently  rewatched the first one or the second one  and he did couch it as like  I know you don't want one of these big  musical numbers.
 It's so  annoying.
 He did that for like three years.
  And I think when younger people look at it they're like  oh that's corny.
 He's doing like  a medley and like no he's  doing a parody of what was  persistent on the Oscars for  many years.
 You have no idea  how bad it was.
 Yeah.
 Which maybe  takes us into the  big ones that are remaining.
 Oh yeah.
  Are from 1989.
  And  are we going to move on to  89 because we need to spend a little  time in 89.
 Oh yeah.
  I have something for the end but I'll  save it for the end.
 Okay sure.
  So  89.
  So I mean I don't need  to say the whole context.
 One thing  that happened in 89.
 The context  is this is not the worst thing that had.
  Although that's up for debate because  Ryan you put this on your list.
  I'm honored to have apparently exposed you  to this one.
 You didn't show this to me first.
  And your argument  was this is the listeners might know  where this is heading.
 Like what are they saving  as the worst thing that ever  happened on the Oscars.
 You might  know.
 But this is a solid  candidate.
 You said maybe this is worse.
  This is more skin crawling to you.
  This is the most  oozy.
  Like you talk about your hair  standing up.
 This is the hair standing up for me.
  I think I've ever seen on any  award show.
 Yeah maybe  ever.
 Yeah  this is the clip  is called Stars of Tomorrow.
  And this happened deep into the show.
  And these people are introduced as maybe  the future winners  of Academy Awards.
 The sequence  starts with Blair Underwood and  Holly Robinson who by now we know  for the many Oscars they've won  as have everyone in this segment.
  It actually is a high percentage.
  There are a lot of people in this who've done  great things.
 It's not bad.
  It could be a much lower number.
  You maybe could have forgotten about all of  these people.
  But wait was there one more.
 Oh the only  other piece of context.
 I've tried to be a little  like sparing with these clips and these  ins and outs.
 But this one I'm like I  think you have to just sit in it  and deal with it.
 Maybe we'll cut it off.
 And if you can't  take any more.
 Okay we'll tap out.
 Yes please.
  Are you going to show the intro?  Yeah.
 Oh wait well not the people  not Bob and Lucille.
  Okay well that's a little bit important  that Walter Mathau comes out and introduces  Bob Hope and Lucille Ball who are  about as legendary as anyone  is at that time.
 And then they introduce  this.
 They get an intro  a legend introduces two  legends who then set  up this.
 Let's  hit it.
  Someday I'll be the one who walks up here accepting the prize.
  And he's at a podium where you would accept the Oscar.
  Someday my Oscar's come home.
  I don't know who Holly Robinson is.
 She can sing.
  Is she Holly Robinson Pete now?  Oh god.
 And I forget  sitcoms, big TV shows.
  And now there's dozens more.
  Like Joey Fisher later from Ellen.
  Hey little spry guy.
 Keith Kugen.
  Jackie Kugen's  grandson.
  Wow.
 I just realized that.
  He's from Adventures in Babysitting.
  Tyrone Power Jr.
  It's not the people themselves.
 It's this number.
  Ricky Lake.
  Spangly jacket and hat.
  I got some Alora Harden.
  Who's that busting those Michael Jackson  moves? Is it Michael?  Oh, Cory.
  Cory.
  Still wearing that jacket.
  I made it up through that.
  I mean Blair Underwood and Malora Harden have worked quite a bit.
  But this is such a  weird pressure to put on someone.
  It's nothing to do with the actors.
  Yeah.
  It's everything to do with who put it together.
  Like what jokers put this  song together? Well according to  Lucille Ball at the beginning,  it's Marvin Hamlisch, then the  winner of several Oscars.
  What did Marvin Hamlisch  do?  Big ones.
 Way we were.
  Yeah.
  Fred Ebb wrote the lyrics, the lyricist of  Cabaret in Chicago  and the song New York, New York mentioned  earlier.
 Well, I'll say.
  Major cred.
 What I will say about this number  is that it's not a good  song.
 And there is a, you can tell  literally by the progression of  notes and the idea that Ricky Lake  and Julie Fischer are on  a stage singing a song that's like  ra-ta-ta-pa-pa-pa-da-ta-ta-pa-du-da-da  or like  da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da  That's bad.
  That's not a good, I'm sorry  Marvin, that's not  Rat Packers should not be singing  that style  of like and Hollywood  tonight will find me here on the  stage.
  It's just not a  good song.
  Skin crawling moment for me is  it was in that clip when Ricky Lake says  the word statu-etter  I'm a statu-etter  I hate things like that  like made up words and Broadway  song.
 Oh that is  so lame.
  There's a lot of nepotism on  that stage.
 Let's face it.
 Tyrone  Power Jr.
 is there.
  Eddie Fischer's daughters or So-and-So's daughters  It's like two Eddie Fischer daughters.
  It's like if the New York Times  NEPO article were  instead of an article it was a  stage show.
 That's what that is.
  I'm gonna make, I'm gonna make the best show  you've ever, Sam Levinson  and  and and and and and they'll scream  when the idol premieres  on HBO I'll take it  over from Amy Simons and here  we go.
 You know what? It's not  a fix.
  It's  not a fix I have.
 Well it is a  maybe it is a fix.
 If you just take  everyone's name away  from it it's not gonna make  the song sound better but  then it doesn't put like the pressure on  everyone to get the  when they don't get the Oscar in 30 years.
 You know what I'm saying?  Then it just looks like a stage of young  performers.
 That's right.
 Everyone's sort of  on the same level.
 But you don't know who  the fuck they are.
 I know  but then they're just sort of like nameless  actors and you're saying oh look at this  young actor like it's not putting any  pressure on the specific performers.
 I'm not saying  it's good.
 I'm just saying it might be a little  bit better unless like presumptuous  that we're just like ordaining these people.
  Maybe that's what the audience saw.
  Maybe the audience was like who are these talented  singers?  So it was appropriate for the people sitting  in the theater.
 Yes but at home  being introduced to  I would have  fired my agent if I was like  later on like Patrick Dempsey  shows it like Kristen Slater is in it.
  It's a wild thing to watch at  full length but like  it's such an embarrassing way  to be presented I feel.
 Yeah.
  Well never stopped Corey  Feldman from doing anything.
  He takes the lead in this next  little part.
 And he was also famous then.
  He was famous.
 He was even the star of a bunch  of movies.
 Maybe it's just that he said yes  and that like maybe they were getting  desperate and he's like can I do my moves?  Fine, fine, whatever.
  Let's just get a little bit of like  I don't think Marvin Hamlisch wrote that into the  performance.
  Plus some of your moves.
  Corey we can't bring out the angels  but you can bust your moves.
  You can bust my stars of tomorrow  too.
 Like minutes past.
  This is so long.
 Like  a bunch.
 I skipped a bunch.
 And then  it gets to this.
  Woo! Wow!  Woo!  Corey Feldman  does Michael Jackson  dances but not as good.
  Work it.
  Work it.
  I think you're going to footloose?  No.
 It's just no.
 It's generic.
  Keith Coogan slides  and wiggles.
  Wait, does it split through though?  Say what?  Say what?  They're holding, waiting for some cue that  didn't happen.
  Say what?  Say what?  This is one more of these.
 I don't think I want to see it.
  I think I'm done with stars of tomorrow.
  The sword fight.
  Christian Slater's in a sword.
 Alright, Jordan's  making us.
  You wouldn't want to be seen doing  this.
 Do you want to be seen  watching it? I don't want to be seen watching it.
  Then this guy  walks to a podium.
 It takes a long time.
  Don't know who he is.
  The Oscar goes to.
  Run back, run back, run back.
  Everyone at the stairs.
  As fast as you can.
 Hurt yourselves.
  They'd all spill to the bottom of the stage.
  They would be the best thing that ever happened.
  They should do a salute to the movies  that may win in ten years.
  Oh yeah.
 Try to guess?  Yeah, just guess the names.
  Finnean's Love.
  What's that?  Guessing titles?  You'll be on the floor when I'm the star of Godfather  4.
  Yeah, it's all sequels.
  When I'm taking home the  for playing Rain Man again.
  I'm taking home the gold for  When I play Rain Man Jr.
  Rain Man  Rising.
 Definitely  be great.
  Amazingly, this is not  the worst or  longest musical number  involving a low brother  in this year's Academy Awards.
  Because now we go to  the inevitable where else could it be?  And they've had a lot of chances to do  something worse.
 They've done things that are more  notorious and  stranger and slappy.
  But they have not done anything this  crappy.
 And it is  of course the  1989  Snow White sequence.
  Have we all had experience  with this?  You can't not run into it.
  I feel like mostly in  montages.
 I don't know  if I've ever seen a big chunk of it.
  It's like it's  War and Peace.
  I've seen it all.
  I've seen Red Sea Pieces.
  Spin on the lid.
 Spin in the queue of crap.
  I studied it in college.
  My thesis was on it.
  I was showing the big  ones.
 This one.
  I've seen a lot of Tar movies and this one.
  I'm waiting to show it to my child.
  Let's just  dive right in.
  We can do more context.
  Let's just see what the viewers saw.
  First we're in the  lobby.
 We're outside the Oscar Theater.
  And then Army Archered.
  A reference no one's had to know for the  last 30 years.
  To their credit  was well known as  he's the guy that  introduced people.
  He greeted you.
  He was a variety writer.
  He was a variety writer.
 When I first  moved to LA the first celebrity  I saw when I was living in Westwood  going to UCLA was Army Archered.
  I saw him at a screen.
 I went to  the movies.
 I saw Nurse Betty.
  Three months after  it came out and Army Archered was like a  row behind me.
  It actually  distracted me.
 I was like  Army Archered.
 What happened with me and Armin  and Andre? We're sitting behind us.
  If I cough weird he might put it into  a review.
 Oh no.
  What if I end up at the  star?  So  he's in the lobby  of the theater and  he introduces the special guest who  is Snow White.
 Let's see the first  one.
  And now ladies and gentlemen here's one of the great  legends of Hollywood.
 She's back with us tonight.
  Miss Snow White.
  Good evening.
 Oh good evening Mr.
 Archers.
  It is so exciting to be here tonight.
  I'm a little late though.
  Can you tell me how to get into the theater?  That's easy Snow.
  Just follow the Hollywood  stars.
  Follow the Hollywood stars?  Oh! Follow the Hollywood stars!  A couple of star costumes  walked by her and then the stage  is full of them.
 This is what would be  like a high school fashion show.
  89.
  Wait did I leave in  the stars? Did I leave in her talk?  I guess I don't have her.
  Then Snow White comes  in and  walks through the front  row, like the first couple rows where the big  stars are and she sings  to this.
 She sings an amended version  of I Only Have Eyes For You.
 Yeah.
  She's bothering  the Glyne close.
  She wasn't ready to twerk yet.
  Exactly.
  She was nervous back then.
  Even the twerking she was freaking out because she wasn't sure if someone was going to appear  at the ceremony and start singing  to her.
  She was trying to distract everyone.
  It was a panic move.
  She's singing to  Robert Downey Jr.
  and Tom Hanks  and Michelle Pfeiffer.
  And  according to this woman's  recollection, Eileen  Bowman, the actress,  who is a complete unknown.
  She's never done anything on television.
  This is her first time on television  we're watching and it's this.
  And she has to go face to face with all the biggest  stars in the world.
 And she  was very nervous but she got to the  stage and she saw her friends  who were the dancers who were the stars  and she thought maybe I will have some fun.
  And she tried to take Michelle Pfeiffer's  hand who gave her this look like  get the fuck away from me.
  And refused the hand.
  And she realized uh oh this is not  going to work and I have 11  minutes to go.
  She goes down the aisle.
  There is one person who is  very sweet and nice to her and that is  Martin Landau.
  Which like just holds  her hand and oh  which is in keeping with things  I've recently heard about Martin Landau.
  I'll see you later.
  I'll see you after the show.
  You have time to write your number down.
 I know you're doing a thing.
  But um anyway  maybe now I just  that's what the viewer got without  context.
 So the viewer is  baffled.
 Why is Snow White, who is  this? Why is it Disney Snow White  but who is playing? It's like at a theme park where  who would this you don't know who the  actress generic person is playing.
  The greater context here  is that this is the year that  Alan Carr produced.
  70's 80's mega producer.
  Did a lot of musicals.
  Did Grease.
  Great.
 Grease.
  Did this Village People movie.
  There was a massive bomb at the time.
  Can't stop the music.
 I've been in Alan Carr's  home.
 What? Really?  Formerly owned by Alan Carr because  I've been in Brett Ratner's home.
  He bought the  home owned by Alan Carr.
 Has an  underground disco.
  He's filled with all his stuff.
  He has like Clockwork Orange props?  Yeah he has a collection of props including  the phallus from Clockwork  Orange.
 He says it was real.
 Actually  now I'm doubting that.
 Not anything about it.
  He might have been lying.
  Anyways that was a weird thing of its own because  because  Ratner was  thought he could produce it.
  I think at the time when I saw him in his  home he was trying to get Eddie Murphy to host  SNL.
  He had that ability that he was enough  of the Murphy whisperer.
 He thought he was like  a Murphy whisperer.
 So he was trying to get Eddie Murphy  to.
 I can talk about this now because I don't  hope to never see Brett Ratner again.
  Let's all  hold his arms.
 Listeners too.
  Let's all just hold hands through the podcast  space.
 That's kind of the inspiration  for it follows.
 You just in the  distance see a fuzzy Brett Ratner  following around.
 You're like oh I hope I didn't  see that again.
  But yeah he was like he was like I can get Eddie  to you know Eddie's going to host SNL for a  Tower Heist or whatever they had done.
  And then that didn't  happen.
 And so when years later it was  rumored or they were basically  set up I was like this isn't going to happen.
  The chances of this happening.
  Anyway but it was all Alan Carr's house.
  Wow.
 So he had been  and his Oscars fell apart.
 So he  it was the curse of Carr.
  Exactly.
  There's a car curse.
 And not  a car scene.
  So that's Alan Carr.
  Oh well  that's good Conti.
 Yeah.
  He's deep in party mode here.
  He was like a he was a party guy.
 I think he  was a manager.
 Hosted a lot of part work  with Hugh Hefner.
  So in addition to being a big producer  of stage and screen  everybody knew him from  parties.
 So it just made sense  that and he  in taking over the Oscars he actually  said he what he said was I don't want  it to be one of these boring stodgy affairs  like we've been having lately.
 Meaning  all the ones we've just been watching  the year before was Robo  Coffin at  2009 in Peewee.
 That was a boring  year.
 Alan Carr's mind.
  Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 The fascist  robot showed up.
 No thanks.
  Let's party.
 Come on.
 We need  glamour.
 We need elegance.
  And that's what I'm going to do.
  And we need the longest musical  number ever attempted on live television.
  Yes.
 It goes.
 Yeah.
  OK.
 We've all watched the entire.
 I mean it's almost like  if we really wanted to punish ourselves we  could just watch it and do commentary.
  Do we really want to.
 We're adults.
  We have been a lot of lives  talking for a while.
 Yes.
 Yeah.
  No I'm not suggesting it.
  But that's really the way to experience  the pain.
 But I kind of I've called  I think it's also what's bad about it is that  like there are as we have seen  almost every year the musical number is  bad.
 But  what's unique about this  Alan Carr produced thing which I really  do think the  the burden falls on him.
 I don't think  it's Snow White.
 I don't think it's Rob Lowe.
 I don't think it's  Eileen.
 What's her  name.
 Bowman Bowman.
 She was  a young probably talented person  Vincent Price and Coral  Brown.
 It's a price and Coral Brown.
 Certainly  not.
 It's not Roy Rogers and Dale Evans.
  I'll tell you that much.
 They just sit  and enjoy.
 By the way probably the last  time I saw their appearance they  any of those people ever made on the Oscar stage.
  Oh yeah sure.
 Yeah.
 The last round of applause  they got was in this thing.
  Merv Griffin also comes in.
  Merv Griffin's doing a whole singing number.
  But I think what it is  it's that you sit  just when you think it's going to end it goes  for another three minutes and just when you  think it's going to end it goes for another three minutes  and just when you think it's going to get it goes for another  three minutes.
 There are different movements of it.
  It's like a sweet  it's a Russian nesting doll.
  It really is that there's like  sets within sets within sets  which now we're doomed to do as we  describe it here at the end of the episode.
  OK you said some of the things  that happen.
  She makes some stars  very uncomfortable and then  is reminiscing about times in old  Hollywood.
 And the reason any of  this is happening is because Alan Carr saw a  show called Beach Blanket Babylon  in San Francisco.
 Big  campy show that involved that was this  it was like a tribute to the 40s and Snow White  takes you through different 40s  scenes.
 He's like I'm doing that.
  We're opening the Oscars with that  which none of none of us know that  like this is the viewer  is like has no sense.
  A viewer I was trying to really  context I was trying to put myself in the mind of a  1989 viewer.
 The viewer thinks this  is Disney.
 They know Snow White  from one thing which is Disney.
 And this  seems like a disneyfication of the  Oscars before Disney has  had its ups with this is early  in 1989.
 Little Mermaid  doesn't come out till the end of 1989.
  So Disney's still in the doldrums  of like Disney's not like cool  like now if Shrek  came out not Shrek that's not Disney.
  But now if like there was an incanto opening  or something people go oh it's cool.
  We're not a big hit song  or yeah yeah yeah.
 This is not the  Snow White is no longer cool at this moment.
  No and it's clearly it is so much  the Disney Snow White.
 The character  and the voice absolutely.
  And apparently and the costume  is from a Hollywood Boulevard rental  place because it's a little  off.
 They put rhinestones  on a Hollywood Boulevard rental  costume.
 So she's  recalling her Hollywood glory  days and then suddenly  the curtain opens and you're at the coconut  grove and  the ambassador ballroom  and then of course who  else would be there the emcee but  Merv Griffin of course  and he's of course singing I've  got a lovely bunch of coconuts.
 We know  we know he did that song.
  That's not just a song you faintly recall  from like preschool or something.
  1989.
 1989.
  Merv Griffin.
 How many of  those locations.
 Not the Emmys either.
  Were standing.
 How many  of those located the coconut grove  and the ambassador  the ambassador.
  That's yeah.
  Merv Griffin's notably  so he's a talk show host.
  Talk show host producer.
 Producer of all the game shows.
  And it was considered kind of  like a lame guy.
  Like a schmaltzy guy in the 70s.
  Let alone  89.
 But a nice guy.
  But still 89.
  What? Why?  It has no association  with movies that I am aware of.
  By the way when I first watched this I was delighted  to see him.
 I'm not saying I wasn't.
  I know that Mike Carlson was delighted  to see Merv Griffin.
 But I don't think Alan Carr  did it for me 30 years later.
  Unless  it is.
 Yeah it's a tenant.
  Unless it's a simulation.
  Which we've been talking about lately.
  We'll have to ask Mr.
 Slap.
  By the way  Ambassador Hotel notorious for where  Robert Kennedy was killed.
  That's what that is.
  Still not the worst thing that's  happened.
  Not demolished until 2005.
  Yikes.
  Very much what you're saying.
  So what now? Who now?  Merv Griffin? Huh? And then he  introduces a bunch of people.
 All the stars.
  Like alright Alice Faye.
  I'm going to be honest I don't know who Alice Faye is.
  Dorothy Lamour.
  I kind of know that name.
  Somebody on our Patreon.
  Cicharise is in there.
  I don't really know Cicharise.
  I'm going to be honest.
 Somebody on our Patreon  was suggesting this before Club 3  but we brought it up to the big stage.
  And in their suggestion they said  it's a bunch of introductions of movie  stars only Jason would know.
  Cicharise probably the most.
 Cicharise  has a big dance number in  Singing in the Rain.
 And the  apocryphal story  is that like oh well she her legs  were famously insured for a million  dollars.
 Oh and she's the one who's like  okay in this.
 She does like a big kick.
  Yeah she did a lot of kicks.
  And she's still got it.
  But most of the people as they start  rehearsing this thing.
 And Alan Carr  has it in his head and all of the greatest  stars will be there.
 But he's picturing them  30 years ago.
 Merv Griffin at his  height.
  Okay if this were 60's Merv Griffin  no problem.
 Oh my god.
  It would have been cooking.
  The audience would have been turned on.
  We've got Merv Griffin centuries.
  If you've got Vincent Price.
  Vincent Price is here.
  Vincent Price hot off Dr.
 Goldfoot  in the bikini machine.
 Now we're  talking.
  But 89 Price?  No way.
  So they have to start like okay maybe we can't  have all of these people be in the musical  number.
 Maybe we say their names and they wave  politely.
 They stand up from a table  and leave.
 Assuming that they're able to  do that.
 Well you need the Coconut Grove audience.
  I mean who's celebrities have to  be enjoying the Merv Griffin performance.
  All of it.
 Roger's,  Vincent Price is crazy.
 Sorry  is it Vincent Price's wife?  Well there's a clip that I  think it's on a Gilbert Godfrey podcast where Michael  McKeon is doing.
 They're doing dueling  prices.
 And they both have very  good prices.
 And Michael McKeon points out that  Vincent Price always.
 Vincent Price  I don't know if I'm wrong to say  probably a gay gentleman.
  But was married to this woman Coral Brown.
  And the speculation would be that he'd always  say her full name and title.
  And the actress, my  married to the actress Coral Brown.
  You could say it like that.
  The woman, the female actress.
  Is there a sexualism I.
.
.
  Right.
  So yeah I don't know  a movie or anything.
 All I know  her is from this clip.
 So this is a little  like can my wife  come along on the.
.
.
  That was I believe his speculation.
  Now who is your wife again?  The actress.
 Coral Brown.
  That's what  Michael McKeon says.
 I don't know  for sure.
 But  yes.
 So  all the big stars.
 To get Vincent  Price you gotta bring Coral  Brown.
 Right.
  We've talked about  Vincent Price being on the  Horror Hall of Fame  awards.
  Which would be after this.
  So Coral Brown would not be with  him.
 I'm not sure when she died.
  But he at least.
.
.
  He would go somewhere without Coral is really what I'm saying.
  I think.
 As long as he was  being honored in some way.
 Yeah.
 For the  Horror Hall of Fame he went to his backyard.
  That's right.
 Yes.
  He was via.
.
.
 I think he went in person one year.
  Okay.
 He was there one year.
  But yes.
 His backyard for one of them.
  Produced by Alan Carr.
 I think that's what he had to do  after this.
 He took over the Horror Hall of Fame.
  But  hey.
 They realized it  can't just be a bunch of old fogies.
  We gotta get some young blood  in this number.
  And that is when Snow White  meets her blind date.
 Let's go to Snow White  too.
  Meet your blind date, Rob Lowe.
  This is so wild.
  I just watched it  a couple hours ago again.
  Oh Mr.
 Lowe.
  I'm such a fan.
  Really?  Processing him being part of it.
 Beyond what's  about to happen.
  I mean.
.
.
  No.
  No.
  Now the performance here.
  The way he chooses to sing  is so.
.
.
  What is that goodbye?  And then.
.
.
  Okay.
  This is a year  after the thing too.
  Actually.
 Well it's a year after  the thing happened.
  The thing is not public.
  So it's about.
.
.
  But they don't know the camera rolling line  that he ends on here?  He's still in movies.
  He wants cameras to be rolling.
  That's an often confused thing.
  It was  public right  soon after this which was part of the curse  of the sequence.
  About like six weeks after.
 Which in 1989 time  is like six days after.
  He already  took such a big career hit from  this.
 And that adds  to it.
  I.
.
.
  And if we aren't afraid of being struck down  by the Doughboy's curse we can talk about  Rob Lowe a little bit.
  We can't talk about Rob Lowe?  We'll try.
  We can't talk about.
.
.
  I mean.
.
.
  The most insane.
.
.
  The voice.
.
.
  I've thought about.
.
.
  Grubby and sleepy.
.
.
  Forever.
.
.
 And the voice crack  on it.
 The delivery is  so.
.
.
 I.
.
.
  You can't.
.
.
 I mean.
.
.
 I.
.
.
  I don't know if he ever thought he could sing.
  It doesn't feel.
.
.
 It feels like he was asked arbitrarily.
  As with Richard Pryor.
 It's like doesn't matter.
  Big star.
 He's gonna be great.
 A big star  can probably sing right?  And then he's just thrown to the wolves here.
  Yeah.
 I mean you could talk.
.
.
 Again people can talk  sing.
 There's like.
.
.
  You can get away with a lot.
  As long as maybe you're not doing a weird voice.
  Dudley Moore I feel like.
.
.
  Richard Pryor following Dudley Moore  already doing the talk sing.
  That's unfair to Richard Pryor.
 You can't.
.
.
  You can't let everyone do the.
.
.
  Yeah.
 You gotta throw some other  ringers in there.
  Don't have three talk singers in there.
  Yeah.
 Sure.
  To Rob Lowe's.
.
.
 I think Rob Lowe can sing.
  Some.
  The thing I read about this today was that Rob Lowe  did this performance  and then went backstage and was mortified.
  I believe Rob Lowe is on the record  for telling this story.
 He was on some show.
  He went backstage and Lucille Ball  was there to comfort him.
  And held his hand and said I really like your singing.
  A young man.
 I didn't know  you could sing so well.
  He had a blue smoke in his face accidentally.
  Because remember she introduced Stars of Tomorrow  right at the beginning of this.
  She's had her own debacle for the evening.
  By the way that's the only universal character  I want to tell me that she's proud of me more than Optimus Prime.
  Oh my dear boy.
  If I could go in a tiny room with Lucy  and it's filled with smoke.
  What a singer you are.
  You're wonderful.
  Gary thinks you're wonderful too.
  Who's Gary?  Gary Morton.
  Gary Morton.
 My new guy.
  My new husband.
 I'm not so thrilled with him.
  But he's nice.
  Michael you're doing a great job.
  Were there any  Ornette's children in the Stars of Tomorrow  segment?  Oh I don't think so.
  Too old maybe.
  They were the Stars of Tomorrow in the 60s.
  Yeah in the 70s.
  Here's Lucy it already happened.
  They missed their chance.
  He sat with Lucy  for an hour.
 They held hands  and they talked about Hollywood  and then she passed away.
  Again the car  curse.
 She passed away  like five six weeks later.
  This was her last time on television I think.
  Really?  Oh my god.
  To introduce Jolie Fisher and Corey Feldman.
  It was the last time she was.
  Immediately after.
  At this point it might bear mentioning  that I did the show Moonbeam City  for Comedy Central.
 Rob Lowe  was the main voice on it.
 Ryan Perez  was a writer for the show.
  And you may recall  that maybe I  wasn't so vocal about it.
  Tell me if I was.
 To me  when it went to.
 Wow.
  To me  when it went to series  when I realized we were going to have an opportunity to fill  a lot of episodes with Rob Lowe.
  Priority number one to me  became we have to get him to sing.
  Being a fan of this  we have whatever reason we could possibly  find to get this guy  to sing.
 You in fact  wrote an episode.
 A fantastic  episode of the show called Cop Con.
  That is full of like  themes and it's a very  prescient piece about  police brutality and police  violence.
 I should say so.
  Check that out somewhere if you can find it.
  Possibly on the way out  the door.
 You know it was on Pluto.
  Before I came over here.
 The legend of Circuit  Lake.
 Oh there you go.
 Pluto TV.
  They do air it.
 Yeah yeah.
  It really means a lot to me that they air it.
  You can see.
 Well in that  one you can see the line that you wrote which delighted me so  much.
 An episode that's a big tribute to  Free Jack.
 The Emilio Esteves.
 Oh yeah.
  Free Jack.
 And that has the line  now I can free Jack  into the system and jack off  that dazzle no bag.
 Oh there you go.
  That delight.
 That made me so  happy.
 The first time I saw it.
  But anyway you wrote this episode.
 There was  I give you entirely the credit for like the  like the like the  weighty quality stuff in it.
 And I think  my main contribution my only contribution  was we should get Rob Lowe to sing  a song in it.
  And I believe he sings two relatively  close back to back in the show.
  He sings like a rockabilly song.
  Yes.
 Yeah.
  He sang at Rad's wedding.
  Oh yes yes.
 He sang Cop this Town  and he sang Wed this  Bride.
 Which is all  on Spotify.
 I forgot that it was  Cop this Town.
 I'm very  proud.
 I don't know how much singing.
  Rob Lowe had done since this performance.
  If he sang on Perks  and Wreck I don't know it.
 There's not a  lot of Rob Lowe singing out there.
 I made  it a point.
 We're gonna get some time with this  guy.
 I make you sing in a song  a song which to tie a bunch of things together  was the song that we put in  just because I thought Brian Setzer  is stupid.
  That's the song.
  I'm gonna have him sing a dumb bad  Brian Setzer song.
  Did it cross your mind though of like  you think you do roll it  on a river.
  Oh we did.
  I guess I wanted to get him into a new  bad genre.
 A new bad type of  songs that dad bands would play.
  And  just about that experience recording  it I will say that is the number one most  fun thing I got to do  making the show.
 Making him sing that  song was so much fun.
 However I  was a little bit disappointed he was not  a worse singer.
  I kind of thought I was gonna get the  grumpy and sleepy.
 But he's a  perfectly capable dad type  singer.
 I thought  he was not.
 I think he  I bet he was like collapsing under the pressure  of because I get 42 million  people.
 Oh and I  wonder what the direction was because I feel like the direction  was like you're really into her.
  Like that felt like that's  where he's coming from.
 Yes I mean  there's a shot later on where  it's like a downbeat moment and  it's like a zoom in on him.
 He's looking at  her.
 Yes.
 And it's like  he's playing like in love.
  This is like a dramatic moment in the middle  of a.
 Yes.
 And lust I would say.
  And lust was so white.
 Yes.
  And I feel like it.
 It's very  sensual.
 The whole thing.
 It's still not  as weird as when Travolta grabbed Adina  Menzel's face in that Oscars.
  That's the most scary  moment I think of any Oscars.
  They thought they were gonna fix it  with that.
 Alright this Adele Dezime  thing was weird.
 Let's make it right.
  Let's get them together and then  can I touch your face?  Can I touch your face?  I want to  take your face.
  You're so wickedly delightful.
  He's like squeezing her skull.
  Those are the most wonderful  nostrils I've ever put my fingers  in.
 It's such a mafia like  threatening.
  Anyway  that is not the last of the Rob  singing because then things kick into gear.
  This could have been the end of the entire  what we watched a little bit ago could have been  the end of the whole thing.
 That could be two whole  separate numbers already.
 Yes.
  But Snow White 3.
  I don't think he's bad.
  He sounds better here I'll say  than before.
  Well they also gave him a thing that is not  what he.
.
.
 Rockabilly  this is your genre.
 I figured it out.
  We figured it out.
  Oh boy.
  But really in that part  it's less him and more these  the animated  mama.
  Is there any.
.
.
  Was it just meant to be like this will be  just the kitchiest only appreciated  tongue in cheek or are they thinking people are  going to really respond to this message of keeping  cameras rolling.
  Hollywood's been rolling for years and we're not stopping  not tonight.
  I think that makes more sense that it was in  line with like a sincere celebration  of Hollywood and also  I'm going to be an Oscar winner.
  That's the skeleton key into understanding  this is that like.
 Oh right.
  This is it.
 Also by the way  this is the end.
  Like Billy Crystal takes over the next  year.
 Like this is the last one you ever got  of like the old ways.
  No irony.
  I think later on they said it was  kitschy but that's what feels like a cop  out.
 Yeah.
 I think  Alan Carr is like we are celebrating  we're bringing the glamour back.
  It's going to be full of sparkles  and sparkles on stars that look like  the backboard to a high school  science project.
 Yeah.
  When is the Tina Turner  version of that song come out? So it's fairly  recent I guess as far  as you know 60s.
  Oh yeah.
  We know she had a different but she had a newer  version.
 Wasn't she had a newer version of it as  a hit I think.
 Rollin on the river.
  Am I wrong.
 I don't  know the ins and outs of the newer  or am I thinking of didn't she have there was a  performance or something.
 Am I crazy.
  I don't know.
 Jason saved me here.
  She had an 80s resurgence.
  Is that what I'm thinking of.
 I don't know.
  I don't think we're within the decade.
  I'm trying to help out here.
 I'm trying.
  It's a little bit like saying it's a  reason like people don't cover Stevie Wonder.
  It's the same thing like Tina Turner is like  that's also not an easy  task.
 Like go sing.
  Go sing that actor.
  Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
  This is meant to be like a show stopping  number.
 Go sing that song associated with  Tina Turner.
  It's only the most dynamic performer  in the world.
 You guys got this.
  This is your first time on television.
 You could do a proud  Mary.
 Right.
 You're not singer.
  You very scared.
 Twenty two  year old who's never been on television before.
  Just be Tina Turner.
 Go go go.
  Also what made what maybe  should be said is that behind them are  tables and place settings.
  But those are people who then like  in that part of it they're swaying their  heads back and forth and they have flower pots on their heads  and then they all stand up.
 It's like be  our guest.
 It's a bit  of pre be our guest.
 Be our guest might have  got that idea from that possibly.
 Yes.
  Yeah.
 The Broadway inspiration  comes where you least expect it.
  This thing this goes and goes.
  And you say all right that coconut grove.
 All right.
  Are we are we done.
 We don't know the coconut  grove moves away and the  revealing a Chinese theater.
 OK.
  Now surely we must be no.
 Then  part of the Chinese gate moves  away and there's a  kick line and then a different part  moves away and then the  top of the Chinese theater  becomes the top of a wig  on Snow White's head.
  Yeah.
 And it zooms out from  this and there's wowie  and the and then where else can it go  but Snow White having the biggest wig  in the world.
  But then she gets covered up by  a flight of stairs that Lily  Tomlin walks down.
 Yes.
  And by the time all this has transpired  this has been 11 minutes  of live television.
 This is almost  Super Bowl halftime show length  and they still have stars of tomorrow  to go.
 They they stopped.
 And by the way  Lily when Lily Tomlin walks down  she has a good joke.
  Uh huh.
 Yeah.
  This is a Bruce.
 This has to be  you got they got Bruce.
 Yeah.
  The joke is  I agree to do the show if they could  only come up with an entrance.
  OK.
 Yeah.
  Pretty good joke.
 But on  the stairs behind her  there's like a gag where  like a guy's like somebody's  reaching for a shoe or something.
 It's like a  Cinderella.
 I don't know what it is.
 It's like a shoe  on the stairs.
 They do not convey what it is.
  I think it's Cinderella.
  But it's Snow White.
  I think it's good.
  And then there's like a  performer like Hamily like reaching  for the shoe.
  And this is going this is fighting  that's the worst thing I actually think in  that number is that all  could be forgiven if she  could just come out and say hey you know what  I want an entrance or whatever.
  The joke is and it keeps  going.
 It's like it's it's  it's it's it is cursed.
  Yeah.
 Yeah.
  Well and the car curse  unspooled through the as we said  Lucille Ball  passes away.
  Watching this  performance in the theater  Jeffrey Katzenberg and Roy  Disney Michael Eisner is  attending to the parks in Orlando.
  He gets on the phone to the  entire Disney legal team and says  are you watching the Oscars.
 Yeah.
  All right.
 Do your thing.
  Lawyer Disney lawyers stay up all  night so that they can have  at 530 in the morning a  legal document ready to review  which by that afternoon is sent  to the Academy.
 We are suing  you for unauthorized use of Snow White  because they did not  clear it.
 They did not.
 And they're  thinking Snow White's in the public domain and they use  it in Beach Blanket Babylon.
  Well not that Snow White with those  colors and that voice.
  Yeah.
 Yeah.
  So and another bit of context  as soon  as this is over as soon as it goes to commercial  break finally after 11  minutes the very first thing it cuts to  is a Chevy Lumina commercial  which is a cross promotion with the  about to open Disney MGM Studios  theme park in which there's  Chevy Chevy Luminas are pulling up  outside the Chinese theater  and Disney characters are coming out including  the dwarfs.
 So  to a viewer they're like  oh Disney did that.
 If I'm  seeing a Disney commercial right now  surely Disney was  part of it.
 So they it's in the  press within 24 hours we're  suing the Academy.
 They have to  issue they ended up settling it.
 They didn't go  to court or anything.
 They just apologize  profusely.
 Frank Wells got Frank Wells  called the producer immediately.
  So this guy he's on the phone  with a bit like hey how you doing Frank.
  He thinks he's calling to congratulate  not so good.
 Disney's not happy.
  So immediate lawsuit right out  the door.
 Then guy  hangs up the phone then gets another  all right.
 You hear about the letter.
 No what's the letter.
  There is a letter going out  that's going to be in all the trades from  a group of esteemed actors  criticizing the performance.
  Do you guys know.
 I don't know this.
  OK.
  This is a letter.
  The 61st Academy Awards was an embarrassment to both  the Academy and the entire motion picture  industry.
 It is neither fitting nor acceptable  that the best work in motion pictures be  acknowledged in such a demeaning fashion.
  And this letter is signed by  among other people.
 Julie Andrews  William Friedkin Stanley Donin  Blake Edwards  Billy  Wilder Paul Newman  and the main  person who pulled this together.
 Gregory  Peck.
 Wow.
  Wow.
 Made a point of  we have work to do.
  I've written a letter.
  This  cannot stand.
 Wait  so.
 I an animated  mama.
 An animated mama.
 Bill Friedkin  Bill Friedkin  here saying  that's not how you open an Oscar  ceremony.
  Wait OK.
 This is  independent of the Disney lawsuit.
 Yes separate.
  It all happens with it like in one afternoon  everything unravels for this  entire production team.
 I mean I  feel like Mary Poppins is telling you you  suck.
 That hurts.
  That really hurts.
  Was not  practically perfect in every way.
 The stress  of this killed Lucille Ball.
  Just watching it.
  Yeah.
 Yeah.
  Maybe she hadn't like maybe  maybe she hadn't watched the opening  really.
 She's like quick second of it.
 Found out  later.
 Oh I complimented that  boy.
 I was wrong.
  Gary taped it.
 I was so nice to the  boy.
 Gary showed me the tape and  I thought I was dreadful.
  And I decided to pass  away.
  Gary I'm gonna die.
  And all my affairs.
  Gary  you're good for nothing.
  As for Alan Carr  it's he like  he went into a restaurant the next day  expecting to get a standing ovation and  instead no one would look at him.
  He never produced a film or a television  show again.
 And  the  Oscar's producer Gil Kates  many years later said  if he had just made that number shorter  I think he would still be alive today.
  Oh my gosh.
  I mean he's right.
  He's probably right.
  So the joke I made about Lucy is true.
  I think so.
 Yes.
 There's a  body count.
 So he had to go.
 He basically  went into exile.
  Yeah.
 Yeah.
 He was like embarrassed and  ashamed.
 There's a whole documentary about him.
  It was apparently a huge deal when there was  he thought I want to  re-release Grease and get all the love about  Grease again.
 And it probably helped start  the fire which now like Grease is  eternally popular.
 And it was like a  meaningful thing for him.
 So he got like a little bit  of like glory  at the end.
 But like he  didn't do anything new.
 He was Mr.
  Hollywood.
 Before that Billy  Wilder somehow created  a new Norma Desmond.
 He just  wouldn't leave his house.
  I'm doing it for real this time.
  So  yeah this might  be the most cursed.
 And now I'm worried  that something bad is going to happen to us because we talked  about it.
 Oh no.
  I think we're fine.
 I mean I think it's over  it's also overstated.
  I mean like it's not I think in context  it's not it is bad.
 It truly  is terrible.
 But like  Dom DeLuis and like  I mean that's two years before.
  Like what are we imagine that  was 12 minutes.
 Maybe that's  the issue.
 It was quicker.
  I think yeah I think that is  what it is because we have seen  performance.
  I think that's the lesson to take away.
 There are  performances of comparable  shittiness.
  But it's really just  what are you asking people to endure?  Sure.
  I would have still partied at Alan Carr's  house after this.
  Who gives an underground disco?  Yeah who cares.
 Yeah you said that about  Brett Radner says that he had a disco in his  house and that is from Alan Carr.
  Wow.
 Yeah.
  We all want that in a mansion  of ours one day.
  Yes.
 It's a little flying  too close to the sun kind of  story.
 Yeah maybe  something else needs in your house.
 Maybe a disco  floor.
  Yeah boy.
  You have a brighter spot.
  Well you know it turned well obviously  there are no hard feelings in the long  run between the Walt Disney Company  and the Academy because it's  aired on ABC for a long  time which the Disney Company has owned for a long  time.
 And  I was looking up because  for a while I couldn't find it  they were doing it this year.
  They would show the Oscar broadcast  on the Main Street Opera House.
  They would show that in the Main Street Opera  House on Main Street and  Disneyland.
 Yes.
 This year  what I saw they have  and they have this every year a big step  and repeat and giant Oscar statue  at the Grand Californian Hotel that  you can take a picture with  and a milkshake with a bow tie on it.
  You can buy in  California Adventure.
 But  something actually of merit  at the Carthay Circle  Restaurant on loan  from the Walt Disney Family Museum in  San Francisco they have the  Snow White Oscar  with the little Oscars.
 With the seven  little Oscars.
 With the seven little Oscars.
  So you can go see that right now  in the restaurant that is a  replica of the theater that Snow White  premiered in.
 That's pretty cool.
  That's pretty good.
  Well that's nice.
 But that's I don't know  that's not my Snow White.
  My Snow White is a petrified  inexperienced actress who's  chased out of the business put on a  gag order to where she can't talk about  this for 13 years.
  True fact also.
  Really? 13 years? Yeah I think so.
  Now she's spoken about it.
 But  yeah to me Snow  White has to be couched  in tragedy.
  I mean I don't know where else  to go from here.
 We've fully explored  the depths of will the  will the ceremony  this year have anything  as memorable as this?  Will Michael Eisner step in somehow?  Because this is back to back.
 We just  on a Patreon episode discovered that Michael Eisner  put an end to a regional  Los Angeles kids show called  King Koopa's Cool Cartoons.
  What? Just recently?  No.
 In the early 90's.
  He wrote a letter to, this is again according  we talk about it on Patreon but  according to this Wikipedia one of the writers  on the show said he wrote a letter to Barry Diller  and got the show cancelled.
  So we're learning just like obviously we knew he was  powerful but this man wielded so much  power and will he step in  this year is really what my question is.
  Well he's expending all of his power this year  making sure those pesky crank anchors  don't show up and cause mischief.
  I'll bet you.
 I mean  I'm just glad he left Aladdin's winter wish alone.
  That's you know.
  Because Ben  Verin didn't know what he was  in that production.
 Oh my god Ben Verin  was in it.
 It's so fun.
 I think he  was like hey everybody Disney like he  didn't know.
 So the whole  go back to Aladdin's  winter wish.
 There were  elements of it that were clearly just ripping  the Disney version off.
 It wasn't totally  Disney because Bruce Flange played  the widow Twanky which is a character that does  not appear in the Disney  Aladdin but Ben Verin was the  genie and he made a joke  about the Lion King  and he referenced the character Mufafa  from Lion King  and I don't think he  knew the character but obviously somebody like threw this  name at him and he just did his best and  honestly that was the most fun to see.
  It was great seeing Richard Carn as the  sultan but Ben Verin  as the genie truly I was very  excited to see him.
  This is Alan Carr level casting.
  I mean if Carr could cast.
  Well you gotta go  to the stage to get Carr level  quality now.
 Ben Verin was on a show called  Jubilee Zoo when I was a kid.
  As mayor Ben and he had like  an animal nose and it's  terrifying but I was a big fan  from back then.
  But we just should  honestly just remember it as the day  that Peter O'Toole died.
  Yeah that's maybe a moment of silence  and we'll hear it.
  Okay and  Ryan Perez you survived  Podcast the Ride.
  Well you got it.
  It's an Oscars episode you gotta have an in memoriam.
  That's right.
 Oh yeah exactly.
  But now 34 minutes of show everyone.
  We're still  going.
 We got we reached a  down point but now we're coming back  for the best actor best actress.
  Well let me be like Armie Archer and say  hey what irons do you  have in the fire.
 Let's exit through the gift shop.
  Mr.
 Perez is there anything you'd like to  plug.
 Oh boy Armie there's so  much going on.
 Oh yeah no if you want to  hear me talk about movies more go over  to Mama Needs a Movie where  my co-host and Raymond talk about  movies a new movie every week.
  Scott's been on the show.
 We got everybody's  going to be on the show you know.
 It's one of  another podcast to add to.
  I know your podcast options are many.
  But consider adding  one more movie podcast.
  And some of the stars  you have coming up are crazy.
  Jolie Fisher.
 We got Jolie Fisher.
  We got  a Chad  Wood.
  Ricky Lake.
  They're all going to be.
 We got Tyrone  Power Jr.
 Oh geez  I was going to say I was maybe  not going to listen until you threw that one.
 I was waiting  for Tyrone Power Jr.
  I heard Gary Morton is going to be on  this.
  This is a  first turn.
 Pull up the logo.
  There we go.
 Mama Needs  a Movie.
 And I don't know wait in what  order these things are coming out but I'm either  going to be on it sooner or just been on it.
  And I'm talking about Mommy Dearest.
  That's right.
 Oh wow.
  A movie I've never seen.
 Should we put  that up before the Oscars or after the Oscars?  Maybe before the Oscars.
 Well people are  going to be thinking about Faye because  of her involvement.
  Maybe and again we  all remember she got out of there fast.
  She actually read the name  and then was never seen from  never seen again as opposed to Warren Beatty.
  That's true.
 So  relevant.
  She might have really been the  She read the name though.
  So I don't know.
  My conspiracy theory I think still stands that  maybe they  were in on it.
 Maybe not.
 Whatever.
  You know what you  were saying was  the trickster Kimmel was maybe  it.
 But think about who's presenting  it.
 The ultimate criminal  Bonnie and Clyde.
  The writing is there.
 It's all  there.
 You just have to look at it.
  One last heist.
  That might have just been an Oscars  producer who's been doing it so long  was still mad that the movie started going  when they nominated Bonnie and Clyde  that's going to took a turn.
  No nice movies  for the nice people.
  Well yeah well check me out on there whenever  and other episodes.
  You're great and it's great and so happy to have you  for this Ryan.
 Thank you so much for having me.
  You guys I haven't been on the show since  I was in.
 I would think I was  in the first 10 episodes.
 Yeah.
  At the time I did nots Berry farm  and I legitimately thought you guys  were going to do like one park per show.
  That's what I thought.
  Maybe you'll do maybe you'll do like a  few more because you'll do the lands.
 Each  land each land will  get an episode.
 I never would have thought you guys  not only have you guys done a great show  you've done it now for a  such an enduring show and  I never thought you would get as granular  and as entertaining as  this.
 No this is neither.
  It's been a great joy to watch and  listen to this show.
  There's multiple episodes about nights  and white satin.
  That level of that level of  I never would have thought  you guys could  do it but it's great.
 Thank you.
  You harken back to another time like  that nots Berry farm would only get one  episode.
 Now we'd be like  an episode for each pie.
  Each pie available.
  That snuck in early.
 Each jam.
  You got away with something.
  We didn't know our pace as has become a catchphrase  from the Cars Ride.
 Slow down  you ain't racing yet.
  We're going as  slow as we can as we roll  next week with more infinitesimal  topics.

 You gotta watch out  you gotta watch for  I think I see something.
