Forever.
Dog.
When your town has made you frown.
When your square has made you swear.
When life gives you one more punch.
You need a doughnut soaked in Captain Grunge.
You need a place, a place to stroll with alcohol.
A place that features part of the Berlin Wall.
Where steampunk robots sell chocolate snacks.
A place where you can tattoo your lower back.
So let's go take a walk.
Let's all go to City Walk Orlando tonight.
Podcast The Ride presents the City Walk Orlando Saga.
Multiverse of madness.
A daily, extremely necessary series.
Exploring the shops, restaurants, and cosmic wonder.
That make up Universal City Walk Orlando.
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, the City Walk Orlando Saga.
Multiverse of madness.
Scott Gardner here, Mike Carlson there.
Jason Sheridan, different over there.
Over here.
Where he is.
We're day seven.
We've landed at one week into this.
Curious how you all are holding up.
Not a business week, a full week, a real week.
A calendar week.
A calendar week as they call it.
The kind of week you're alive in.
Not just business hours.
But no rest for us right now.
We're in the thick of it.
And luckily we're joined by somebody else willing to get into the thick of it with us.
A survivor of the downtown Disney ordeal.
Former Rainforest Cafe employee.
Current writer, Julia Prescott.
Hey!
We're here!
We made it!
I survived so many…
I survived the writer's strike as well.
Let's not forget that.
We all did.
We all did, yes.
I survived those chicken fingers from the Rainforest Cafe.
And the volcano.
And I'm just glad that you're willing to participate in a saga again.
Here's what I'm doing.
I'm apologizing in advance.
Because there's been a runner so far of bad things keep happening to the guests.
We really wasted Evan Susser's time after a long laborious day.
Eve Anderson got food poisoning.
We don't know from where yet.
I hope…
Pleasant.
And I'm not going to spoil my experience.
Oh, jeez.
I don't know.
My question is, has anything bad happened to you already because we asked you to do this?
Right.
I would say that nothing bad with a capital B has happened to me.
But in regards…
And I just want to say, I'm very respectful of the rules of the sector.
Thank you.
So, you know, I'm a stray.
And I'm very open to you reeling me in.
Reigning in.
Okay, okay.
Because you are one of the guests who was kind enough to go to…
Who was in Orlando and who, like, thought about this while you were there.
And asked about this to make sure that you could help repair the rift in the multiverse.
Listen, am I a patriot?
Yeah.
You know, am I a friend of the pod?
Yeah.
You know, am I a friend of multiple pods?
That's not something I want to discuss because we don't talk about ex-lovers.
I just want to say…
If you're now, that's the important thing.
My promise to you guys and to the Clifford's listening is that when I am in a themed environment, I'm always thinking of you.
I do it for you.
Thank you.
Oh, my God.
That's nice.
That's very touching.
And I'm not sure if you guys know, but it's going to come out that the visit that I took to one of the locations in this sector
was a solo week-long Disney World trip I took.
Oh, no, I didn't know that.
A year that was that was full of things that I should be feeling more like an adult and acting like more like an adult.
I think I bought a house in this year.
And yet I decided that I, I, mama needed some solo time at Disney World.
And my takeaway is that families ruin Disney World.
And the only way to fully experience it and descend to heaven is to do it by yourself.
And you're not even talking about just like kids.
You're talking about like grandparents ruin it.
Oh, yes.
Ants and uncles ruin it.
Yeah.
Anyone in addition to me ruins it.
Yeah.
I mean, look, you know, I have not been to Disney World since having a child.
I've been several times without the family.
Usually when I'm telling people I'm doing that, I'm asked like, are you going with the family?
No.
Well, you can say you're going for work.
Yes.
Yes.
Yeah, yeah, we are.
We are.
No, it's work, though.
It's for work.
It's not weird.
It's for work.
It's for there's a multiverse of madness.
And it got to fix the rift.
Speaking of all that, you know, we haven't seen him in a couple of days.
I wonder if we can we've just popped in for our quick little missions.
I wonder if we can get him to stick around for a little bit.
S.
K.
Boys, boys.
He's with us.
Wow.
It's good to see we've just had these quick poppins.
We haven't really gotten to catch up.
It's been a while.
It's been a while, man.
It's been three old days.
Sector keeper, hearing you say my name, and I mean this as a compliment, rings the same as hearing E.
T.
say my name at the end of the adventure.
Oh my God.
High praise.
Thank you.
It touches me deep into my heart.
The most emotional experience that there is.
I did cry the last time I did it.
Oh, yeah.
Man.
Sometimes you just kind of cry the word friend.
Okay, we've been doing a couple of episodes, but we haven't had like the long sit down with you.
First of all, thank you for setting us up in Orlando with your your cousin and your friend.
It seems like the level keeper.
We had a good time with him.
Good.
He treats you guys well.
He's good.
Yeah, he did.
But I realized he stole my City Walk shirt from the kiosk.
He was wearing it.
He was the one that stole the City Walk shirt from Emerald.
Yeah, that's right.
From the Emerald kiosk.
Emerald stages where the kiosk is on the north side of the waterfront by the water taxi.
No, I know.
In phase one, in phase one, sector three, it's phases now.
And that's yeah, it was in sector three.
Just to catch up, Julie, there's there's phases and sectors, but there's also jump points and portals and there's also back doors, back doors and front doors and trap doors.
And there's also a galactic fence that you have to walk through on the side of a cosmic house, a cosmic house.
OK, and that's different than the other galactic fence at the other park.
Yes, yes, yes.
Yeah.
Alpha and Omega.
If there's one in Hollywood and Orlando, there's an alpha and Omega and the alpha and Omega names are based on which one opened first.
Of course.
Yeah.
Yeah, you're fine.
You're you're more at ease with it than we have been.
That's true.
I am glad someone here is calm.
He stole your shirt.
Yeah, yeah, he's wearing it at the live show.
Bad keeper.
Yeah, he was nice otherwise, but yeah, he was.
And he didn't give it back to you afterwards?
He might have, but he stole it and he was wearing it.
That's all I know.
So he gave it back.
He maybe tried to give it back or he did and I maybe lost it.
Maybe there's too many maybes flying around.
I don't know what's happening.
I don't know.
I'll have to figure it out.
Once I was at your house and we were going to go somewhere, but you couldn't find your keys and you came out and you were like they were on the floor under the bed.
Yeah, they were.
Okay.
But at first, did you say someone stole them?
No, I didn't say that.
I don't say everything I've lost is stolen.
I don't say that.
Somebody stole some ruffians must have stolen it from him.
There's only one answer.
I lost the keys.
The shirt, I wasn't sure.
I'm not sure where it is.
That's a different thing.
Maybe you have to go back.
Yeah, it's possible I have to go back.
I made a they have a spray like airbrush tea kiosk and I had a guy make I love City Walk on the shirt.
I love that shirt.
It was worn by the level keeper at our live show.
With permission or not?
With permission.
Okay.
All right.
Well, and that's okay.
Well, you know what?
My thing is you've been saying that these cousins are your relatives have been coming after you for your Powerball money.
That's right.
But you also said the level keeper is on the level you like point two billion isn't that much after taxes.
All right.
That's true.
Yeah.
And do you get it all at once or in installments?
I chose installments.
Oh, dude.
Oh, you got to invest.
You didn't want the curse of the lottery.
Yeah, it's the curse.
Right.
I've read the reddits, man.
These things are bogus.
The plane that was playing that quick pic was the worst thing I've ever done.
And I include dancing in the fountain.
Oh, no.
That killed you.
Which is what killed you.
Yeah.
Which is what took me down.
It's worse than your dime.
Wow.
Oh, my God.
Sector keeper, I hate to pry into your business, but I see some tickets.
Are you still playing the Powerball?
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Don't harsh my scratch offs, man.
These are just scratch offs.
I'm not playing Mega Millions.
You're holding them for a friend.
I'm holding them for a friend.
Yeah.
They're stocking stuffers, dude.
Yeah, it's a great birthday or Christmas gift.
This one knows what he's talking about.
I know.
I talk Pennsylvania lottery when it's around Christmas time.
They're always doing ads of like, and give the gift of winning.
Have you gotten scratchers for Christmas?
I think from extended family, yeah.
Okay.
So, aunts and uncles.
Can you do that, give the gift of winning clean?
That act like a jolly, I don't know, what kind of guy is saying that?
Is he like a?
Maybe Santa Claus or like an elf.
Let's throw it out there for any like Christmas commercial purposes
or just do it clean.
Hey, give the gift of winning.
That was good.
I love a podcast that can double as a self tape.
Yeah, sure.
You know what, while you got the microphone set up.
Right, of course.
Why not?
If you need to put yourself on tape for anything.
I would love, maybe at the end.
Yeah, sure, yeah, do it at the end.
I don't do a lot of on camera stuff, but I don't not do it.
But you know, this also, this wouldn't be in a way
because nobody could see you.
So this is more if you want to audition for like being like an NPR host or a voice.
Right, right.
That's really what this could be good for.
You joke, but I have auditioned for multiple California lottery commercials
and never been hired.
Oh, really?
Yeah.
Ironically, playing another lottery that you are not winning.
I know, because they can tell.
It's a conflict of interest because you play so much.
Yeah, yeah.
Right, right.
You're yeah, in your heart, you're yourself sabotaging out of principle.
You know, it's one of the special things of the Philadelphia Airport.
Multiple Pennsylvania lottery kiosks.
Really?
Yeah.
For like scratch off tickets.
Yeah, for scratch offs.
Yeah.
Well, it sounds like a future saga that we're going to have to get into.
Oh, boy.
Well, they did in the 90s, they did turn it into a mall and they're like,
come do your shopping at the airport.
Like go to the airport.
Go to the airport.
And don't, what do you mean?
Who would do that?
Really?
If you weren't even going on a flight.
That's right.
That got shut down real quick a few years later.
Did anything happen that shut it down or was it just not like any money?
9-Eleven.
That's what I thought.
I was going there.
All right.
I pretended I didn't know.
But I knew.
Of course.
You wanted to get Jason's catchphrase.
I wanted Jason's other catchphrase.
If you're asking if there were any robberies or fights, like, yeah,
just the normal level of Philly, you know, riledness, you know.
Sure.
I do know.
You've told me.
I would, I'd caution you, Sergei Kuber, to just be careful about a couple of things.
If, if you think about playing again, I don't think lightning's going to strike twice.
I wouldn't, I'd say the odds of you winning it two times don't seem very good.
And also I'm glad you said nice things about the level keeper,
but I'm also a little worried with the shirt stealing.
Obviously, you know about his thing, his thing where he hits a cowbell with everything that he says.
That's his thing, which he did in the live show.
But I'm starting to worry that he stole that cowbell.
It's possible.
Can I, can I ask a possibly dumb question?
Oh, no.
Only because you may have covered it in previous episodes of the City Walk Saga.
When it comes to the multiverse or I guess the wider family of the sector keepers or the level keepers.
The other keepers are family cousins.
I guess this is more a question for you guys.
Sorry, sector keeper.
But like, what's the vibe?
Is it like when we all meet Homer's relatives and they're all variations of Homer, you know,
some are dumber than others or like, you know what?
I do know the connection between all of us, but I'll let you.
Oh, well, if you know.
Each place that we represent, we've all died on the premise.
But non declared, just like Disneyland.
Yes.
Yeah, that makes sense.
They wait till you're off.
Right.
That's how they get you out.
They make sure the corpse is cold.
Yeah, they said I died on the 101.
So like American Dream, the one keeper might have died like, like while they were building it, like a wrecking ball.
Oh, yeah, that's possible.
Accidentally.
He rolled.
He might have rolled all the way down the unfinished ski slope.
Right.
Oh, yeah.
But we don't know because the police just declared him dead like two miles away in like a river somewhere.
What do you what do you think would be the funniest way to die at City Walk Orlando?
Oh, interesting.
Funniest way.
I mean, like if the if the I guess if the hemisphere dancer Jimmy Buffett's plane suddenly turned on and you're having drinks under it, the propeller turned on and kind of like chopped you up real quick.
That's a cartoonish death.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's a mistake.
That's good.
Forgive me if I may have shared this on a previous episode of this fine podcast.
We've all done it many times.
It's kind of my thing.
But as as given, we're talking about let's call it City Walk East.
I will always love City Walk East.
It always hold a special place in my heart because I witnessed truly the wildest thing I've ever witnessed, which is somebody on stilts visibly lost.
And that happened.
I don't remember this.
That happened.
It was clearly a Margaritaville Stilt Walker, and I've never been on stilts.
But from what I hear, you have to just keep following momentum.
And I saw this Stilt Walker, like very far away from Margaritaville being surrounded by people trying to take a photo.
And you could just see on their face all they wanted was to turn around and figure out where the fuck they were.
So I just wanted to share that.
Maybe that's part of the silliest way to die.
You are a lost Margaritaville Stilt Walker.
And then you end up going face down into the fake lake.
Maybe that's good.
Yeah, that's good.
I do remember the early days of Margaritaville out here was full of Stilt Walkers.
I recall us going those first few weeks multiple times and seeing people on stilts.
It wasn't just opening.
They kept going for a little bit.
That's right.
As recently as 2018, I saw one.
Wow.
Wow.
I feel like some of you were friendly enough with one that you recognized us the second or third time.
What an honor.
I feel like I know that this is treacherous, but I feel like the proximity of that Margaritaville to the sky zone would create a really crazy situation.
You shoot up.
Close your eyes and imagine.
Clacking around in there like a giraffe got pulled into that car dealership.
Oh, no.
One of those guys.
Oh, yikes.
How do you end up lost as a Stilt Walker?
What did I know just like went out the wrong door or first day doesn't know.
And there's a I don't know.
Wait, do I work at Margaritaville or do I work at Lone Palm Airport?
Right.
I'm having as existential crisis of self in the middle of City Walk.
A despondent like Stilt Walker, somebody who just doesn't know what they're doing anymore.
City Walker, Lano, that's a bad place to get lost is still so long because there's a lot of stairs and decorative stairs like.
And just a lot of slopes.
You could find yourself up a slope and then you're in front of the frozen Margarita place.
And, you know, there's somebody playing jazz and you're like, OK, that's nice.
But where the fuck am I?
Yeah.
And if it is your first day, like walking on Stilt at all is one thing, but like slopes, they didn't tell me there'd be slopes.
That's a future lesson.
I haven't done the slopes class yet.
You know what?
Actually, speaking of which, I think, you know, hills and elevations, I think that's kind of what we're dealing with here in this new phase.
Let's get the official assignment sector.
That's right.
We've entered a new phase.
It's phase three, the up the weird stairs and ramps phase.
Wow.
And when you just get chills.
Thank you.
We're finally there.
I got chills approaching it.
Because of the altitude.
Yeah, because of the altitude.
It gets colder as you go.
What's in it?
This is phase three, sector one.
Bend the bow, bread box and menchies.
I knew you'd like to say that one.
We know you.
That's up your alley.
Well, yeah, this is if you know, if you've never been there in person, there's this is this odd zone that turns like really zigzaggy.
Like there's stairs and ramps at the same time.
And the ramps get very zigzaggy.
And when we were there, I was saying it's like San Francisco.
And sure enough, this little zone, when it was added, was called is called Lombard Street.
Unofficially.
So if you felt a little little whiff of San Francisco while you were there.
Yeah, that's why.
Or you were hallucinating.
I don't know why I'm so offended by that.
I don't know.
There's like I feel like there's there's a limit to how cute my theme park company is.
Mainly because it doesn't at all look like Lombard.
It's just because it's it's it's steep and it's zigzag.
That's all you got there.
You know, they don't.
Or get out of here.
Yeah.
Well, it's not an official designation, so they at least they aren't too offensive on that end.
But this is where we start.
You know, that's the direction we're going.
We're kind of climbing up to the food court, but not quite at the food court.
But there is food stuff up there.
It's like a secret little place almost.
You could miss it entirely, but we we did miss it.
No, that's another thing we didn't know they have here.
Cosmic Nooks.
That's part of the multiverse.
It sounds like an item on the bread box menu.
The cosmic nook.
Here's what I'll do.
I will I will quickly knock out Bend the Bow unless anyone has other thoughts about Bend the Bow.
This is what I can offer because the City Walk Saga was in my mind when I went to Orlando on a bachelor party two and a half years ago.
Like I better get something here.
We got these sectors to worry about.
So two and a half years ago or more, I went to Bend the Bow.
It's kind of like I mean you could picture what bows are.
But like it's you know the optimal version of it kind of like a steamed bun with meat inside.
This is more like tacos but with a puffier bun instead of a tortilla.
The results are mediocre to that.
The bows are pretty dry.
The ingredients don't feel super fresh.
I didn't recognize what ingredients I was looking at in the photos from two and a half years ago.
One definitely shrimp which I remember was dry bad shrimp.
The other I I just don't know.
I also remember it took forever to arrive.
I did not like Bend the Bow.
That's Bend the Bow.
We did it.
Per usual.
Opening summer too.
That was it was new then?
When it's 2021 is when it opened.
That's the best they had.
That's like before.
Well I've been understaffed from what I've read at some of these locations when they first opened.
A little overwhelmed.
Yeah no one wants to work.
No one wants to work at Bend the Bow.
Like Kim Kardashian said you know.
Get back to bending the bow she said.
What do you mean there's no jobs?
There's bows to be bent.
Now Bend the Bow is that also is there a bend it like Beckham kind of time that we could.
Like is that a turn of phrase?
What does it mean?
What the hell does that mean?
Isn't it but the what is there's what's the thing it's like if you do the other spelling of bow BOW when the bow breaks baby will fall.
That's a stretch.
Maybe that's the best design.
I'm just trying to give them something.
Is Bend ever in that?
I guess because it's like you said it's the variety of bow that's like it's not a puffy bun.
It's more like a taco.
And this is a crucial mistake that they make to because like that's what's good about a real bow is that there's it's imbued with filling inside not just something's like slopped in there and just happened because they know there's a big rush.
We've had three orders.
They're taking us a half an hour to do.
It's not their fault.
I don't know.
This is just something wrong by by design here.
This is a kind of seen other places.
However, the traditional like bun bow very easy to make in huge portions like very not easy.
Excuse me.
I don't mean to diminish the quality, but it's like you can make them in batches, you know, as opposed to.
Yeah, these things much harder to make because it took forever.
Yeah, I didn't like it.
The only thing that I liked is that this is where while while waiting around your cut, you kind of end up next to the second floor of the movie theater where we got to go right where I went with the level keeper.
And that was where my dream began of wanting to see what was on the inside because from the outside you could just squint in and see a really sun bleached Pelican brief poster and a really sun bleached Philadelphia poster.
And I was like, I want to know what the rest are.
And then getting in and discovering that there are a lot more old posters and that one of them is a second Pelican brief poster.
It took two years to get that information.
I didn't let me triples is best.
That's my only note for them.
I came out when I was still.
Yes, you know those movie.
All of them are.
It's Roger Rabbit and Cape Fear is one Roger Rabbit.
Yeah, that's cool.
It is cool.
And the one where like his silhouette is made with a film reel poster.
It's nice to see that in person.
I think all of these movies predate City Walk entirely.
Yes.
So you're right.
It didn't exist.
Why did they maybe they just bought all those.
You're learning.
You're learning.
Oh, that's the rift.
That's right.
City Walk Orlando is built around the poster.
Oh, they were there.
They were they were hovering on the second floor.
They've always been.
They built a theater around it as totems to teach the future generations.
Yes, that's right.
Instead of nailing the poster into the wall, they built the wall and then thrust it into the poster, which had nails in it already.
They're load bearing.
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
So there you go.
I'm happy to check that one off the list.
I would I'm not sure which direction to go now, Julie, if you want to put into that is a Menchie's bread box, bread box Menchie's.
Any strong leanings?
Just take a ramp or stairs.
That's all I have.
I mean, I definitely walked past Menchie's and I've been in a Menchie's before.
Yes, great.
That's enough.
That's enough.
I guess, of course, of course.
I eat it.
We eat Menchie's, Jane and I.
All right.
That's more than enough.
Little little chocolate.
You can see some strawberries, some cookie dough, some nonpareils and some chocolate rocks on there.
However, by the time we got to the bottom, it just kind of looked like black sludge.
That's a chocolate covered Oreo that looks like it's been in an oil spill.
It's kind of a genre of dessert where you're really chasing those first three bites and then you know you're getting weird soup by the end.
Well, but I got all the soup at the end.
I got the nonpareils and chocolate rocks covered in sludge.
Wait, so you told that story and then look how it ended up.
Pretty gross, huh?
And then the end of the story is you ate all of it.
Oh, yeah, I love ice cream soup.
Yeah, I love it.
It just looks very it was like no light was escaping from this chocolate frozen yogurt.
And you created it yourself in that Menchie's?
Yeah, I think we both went back and forth adding stuff.
You scooping things because like Pink Fairy recently has gone to the model of they do all of it for you out here.
Ever since the pandemic.
Ever since the pandemic.
Which I feel like used to be their model.
Well, maybe they maybe did they always do it?
I swear you could.
I don't know.
I think the A, I think that's true.
And B, I think this all was said in the first the first time we talked about fucking Menchie's.
It absolutely was because I like what they do.
I don't want to do it myself.
Yes, that's right.
Every beginning is an end and every end is a beginning.
Yay.
I'm just trying to see if Menchie's in Orlando is still doing it that way.
You serve yourself.
OK, got it.
That's not she likes chocolate rocks and I like nonpareils and we make it work.
Somehow.
Somehow.
These people.
Yeah, yeah.
No cordials.
Both alike and dignity.
I understand.
Yes, exactly.
Yes.
How did you find it to be compared to other Menchie's just as a desert estate like quality,
cleanliness, any of that?
Yeah, it was very clean inside.
It was totally deserted in the middle of the day, which is becoming a running theme in City
Walk or Lando specifically.
Yeah, it was fine.
There was a lot of options.
You know, I feel like when I serve when I do serve yourself, I either do like very little
or like way too much.
And it's like, oh, this is eight dollars now.
You know, the weight.
Yeah, because you just forget you just start putting toppings on you.
That's what they want, Jason.
That's what they want.
That's what they want.
You know, if they have like those animal cookies and you're like, well, I need to like seven
of those pink and white animal cookies, of course, frosting on it, then that that weight is
that's going up.
That's that chocolate Oreos.
Those are real heavy.
Heavy.
Heavy.
You know, what you should do is you should get all the ingredients at home, weigh all
of them so you know next time you go how to save money by getting the lighter ingredients.
That is a level of checking.
I I never thought that you would ascend to how would it have it took me seven years of
this podcast to figure it out.
Right.
Yeah.
And becoming a father.
Well, that's probably what it did.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, because you have to be paying for desserts down the road.
So if you can shave 90 cents off here and there, we need to get the lighter to college.
The literal lighter cookies, just less heavy cookies.
Ah, a bit heavy.
What?
It's fine.
I haven't been eating to.
No, no, no.
Not in terms of health, in terms of weight for cost.
Heavy is cost.
That's the issue.
Yeah.
If you could put like rice cakes on your Menchie's, that would be ideal because they're so light.
I have a question and perhaps you already answered it with the previous Menchie's episode.
I can't I listen to them all.
Wow.
I can't recall.
I don't recall anything about it.
Do you or maybe this is more like a question for CityWalk East and CityWalk West.
Do you feel like one is more of a locals CityWalk than the other?
Oh, that's a good question to ask.
Yeah, I don't know.
I feel like maybe Hollywood is less locals.
I think Hollywood is more locals if you're fucking nuts like everyone here.
Right.
But I was about to say, excuse me.
Yeah, no, no, no.
We're all part of that.
I live there, man.
I'm sorry.
These words come out of me.
I'm a little twisted.
But do real regular people in LA go?
I don't think so.
Maybe for movies only.
Yeah.
That's your way.
Where your local movie theater.
And then what about CityWalk East?
I think that's a lot of people on vacation.
It's a lot of people on vacation, but I do think the locals are maybe go more, maybe
not as much as they used to because it feels like the heyday was years ago when people
would just go hang like locals would hang there.
Are you I feel like you're judging all of this off of your one conversation with Matt
Cardona.
That's one of them.
But also when we've talked to the different people that work at the theme parks, I forget
last trip we took.
We were sort of like wasn't there like a you go hang at Disney Springs and you like you
party at CityWalk or something?
You party at CityWalk.
Well, and they both.
It's like the SNL after party and after after party.
Oh, yes.
Yeah.
They both have reduced their hours pretty heavily after 2020.
Yes.
They used to be more of a late night.
Closer to Pleasure Island and be open until like one or two every night.
There was somebody told us, yeah, like four or five years ago that that was more of a
hang at least at that time even.
So I think maybe because I also we talked about on the NBC Sports Bar and Grill that
I got the feeling that we're locals just watching sports at the bar.
It's a nicer.
Yeah, it's it's bigger.
It's a the water's there.
It's nicer.
I don't know who would really want to go up to the coldness of our CityWalk Hollywood.
Except us.
It's a place I think where you might want to be more because the water is genuinely
nice to look at, except then when you're there, then what do you do?
It was interesting for us to go.
Yeah, we aren't by these things all the time.
But like, is the local really getting their parking, taking the parking ramps, going
across, walking across the lagoon, going to like what's your weight tonight here at
Toothsome?
Eighty five minutes.
But to your point, I think the parking is a big detractor.
Not my solo trip, but the trip before with my family.
We literally got lost at the end of a long universal day for a full hour in that giant
parking structure.
Oh, wow.
We saw God.
Like we were the shells of who we once were.
You and me both, Julie.
Yeah, I know.
I see him all the time.
And so I feel like, you know, with CityWalk West, I know exactly where to park to like
take.
I like I have my perfect spot and I take that escalator right up to what is now that weird
collectibles shop, formally the Skechers store.
But I'm there in like minutes and I'm rolling into that AMC or Toothsome.
I don't think we found our spot and they guide you different ways.
We still go against their guide.
We were there three days ago and I said to Scott as I got off, I go, I still don't know
where I am when I come out of the parking garage.
Yeah, we're still confused.
I know.
I can lead the way.
If you enter on Cahuenga, they'll send you to ET.
And if you enter on Lankersham, they'll send you to Jurassic.
I do know that.
That took me years to learn.
But you could still, they'll still send you to Jurassic from Cahuenga.
It's happened to me many a time.
That can happen.
And then if you go in Jurassic, you can still end up coming out by Celebrity Authentics or
I have for some reason just come out by the Johnny Rockets and I don't know why.
It's another if you go another there's multiple exits to that garage.
Right.
I mean, I know what you're saying, but I don't say right as if I know what you're
talking about because I just end up by Johnny Rockets or I end up by Celebrity Authentic.
You're learning, boys.
You're hitting jump points.
Not to harp on this, but I do feel like if I were listening, I would want a clear, definitive answer.
And so I will share my answer to this entire conundrum.
You always enter on Lankersham.
And when they they're going to send you to Jurassic.
And so when you enter Jurassic, there is the on ramp that you can go to on the left that
usually the security is guiding you toward.
Betray the security.
We cannot.
It's impossible.
You will break your first rule in the parking lot.
Sector keeper, shield your ears.
I know.
Sorry.
Betray the security and pretend like you're going out back to like the on ramp toward
E.
T.
Pretend like you're going out, but then make a left into that parking structure.
There's like one more entrance into the parking structure.
And that's where all of the EV parking is.
But then also just like general compact parking is.
And you will be feet away from the escalator leading up to Toothsums.
Really?
Yeah.
Every time.
Oh, interesting.
Nobody's ever parking there.
And now it will be blown up.
But that's the answer, guys.
I'm going to need like a video to explain how to just make a video for me.
When she said Betray Security, Mike started sweating.
I don't like I'm worried about getting in trouble.
Mike, do you feel you betrayed security just hearing that?
Just putting this on a podcast that I am part of.
I feel you have to pay a wall just this part.
Yeah.
Here's another big parking thing.
Disney Springs free parking garage in the green parking lot.
Yeah.
All of them, I think.
Yeah.
So that's a plus.
The locals.
Oh my God.
Yeah.
Wow.
I'm going to try this parking hack.
Yeah.
I will try it.
And I will report back on this saga.
Yeah, that's a good thing.
I would also recommend getting that universal gold pass so that parking is included.
Well, I have.
Of course, I know everybody here has it.
Well, I had it, which has left me.
And then I let it expire because my kid costs money now.
Right.
And I kind of don't want to be in anywhere near Mario for a long time.
So now for now that we know we found out from the sector keeper, we got to go back up to
say, like Hollywood for various things as part of the multiverse.
So now I got now I'm parking on Coelho and walking up.
So that's what that's what I'm doing.
Hey, it's free.
That's a step.
And it is a track.
But you're very aware of all things City Walk.
And were you am I remembering correctly?
Did you do a Halloween costume where you were City Walk?
Essentially, it was the first couple's costume that I've done in many, many years.
My husband and was it pandering to you guys?
You bet your ass it was.
I'm asking about it now.
Did I hope to get retweeted or reposted from them?
Yes.
And they did not.
But that's OK.
I feel like we didn't either.
But I would apologize.
But I liked it.
I saw it.
I liked it.
I'm bringing it up now.
We'll post it when this comes out.
Yeah.
How did the costume work?
So I got a unitard and like a full like full length, full sleeve unitard.
And then my husband, Mike, is an artist, animator, director person who is very busy.
And yet I forced him to make all of the little like City Walk standees.
And he is like one of those cry cut like sticker maker, you know, machines that you get at Joanne's Fabrics.
So he like designed all of them and then printed them out and then we assembled together.
And so I had across my chest the big globe from the Hard Rock Cafe, Rest in Power King.
I had my 13th birthday party there.
Oh, wow.
Oh, I.
Two sums cannot hold a steampunk candle to what that was.
A complicated candle with lots of ears and screws.
We could talk about that for hours.
I'm ready.
And then we kind of and then we wanted it to be because it's spooky, all defunct, you know, Fallen Brothers restaurant.
So we had the John Lovett's Comedy Club, which I did do a set at when I was beginning my stand up career.
And it was one of the few times that my mom was in the audience.
And the host was very problematic.
So that'll forever be burned in my memory.
And yeah, what else did I have?
I had Jody Moroney's Sausage Factory, Jurassic Parking over my takes me my backside.
Just because that's what you should do.
We decided and a ton of other ones that I'm now forgetting.
But yeah, a lot of Fallen Brothers and just like we just assembled them all over my body.
And then my husband, Mike, made one of the most amazing costumes I've ever seen, which is the minion overlooking the one on one.
And he fully hit his face and he he worked on it like for a full week straight, like did not sleep.
Like he, you know, fabricated it out of cardboard and tested it many times.
And it's amazing.
Like stress tests.
Will this hold up?
Yeah.
Yeah.
And so structurally sound couples costume.
Yeah.
Damn.
Maybe more sound than the real thing.
Yeah.
Yeah.
One earthquake and then timber rolling downhill.
Yeah, I should say that, you know, obviously I love City Walk.
But my nickname for a comedy show I used to run was I'm the young pope of City Walk.
And I'm not sure I've ever shared that with you guys.
No, I don't think so.
It is my Twitter bio.
That all came to be because I joked one show that City Walk is California's Vatican City and I am its young pope.
It overlooks.
It sits on a crest.
It overlooks us.
It keeps us warm.
It feels like it's governed by its own entity that is separate from L.
A.
County proper.
Definitely.
Definitely.
The fact that Universal City is its own city or town or whatever.
Yeah.
That's my biggest gripe about that coaster going in is that we lost a Universal City sign.
Yeah.
We still got the other one.
We still got one.
That's OK.
But that's I mean, I've been looking at that my whole life.
You too, Julie.
I was I'm bummed about that.
Maybe they can rebuild it once it's up.
They better.
I hope.
Yeah.
And one last thing.
I've also always joked that the menu overlooking the 101 is our version of Christ the Redeemer.
So it is something else that we look to for hope in times of struggle.
I'm your sister.
Yeah.
Thank you.
You're young.
The young pope.
I'm kind of the young Sheldon of City.
Wow.
So you're canceled.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I.
My life was.
Yeah.
His life.
Yeah.
He is.
He literally is.
OK.
Anything about this Menchies before we we move to what we sent you to do.
Right.
Right.
Right.
Or wait.
How do we do we say some behind the scenes about how you ended up at at Bread Box?
Unless there's more Menchies.
I was.
So as I mentioned, I was at Disney World alone and universal alone having a blast.
I'm having a really good time.
It was also the holidays.
Oh, my God.
So I went, you know, when all the other families around me were feeling that holiday spirit.
I should also say that I did not tell my mom I was doing this until after I came back and was like, by the way,
I was at Disney World by myself last week.
And that was a fun fight.
That was very silly.
She was she was upset because she wanted to go.
Oh, and I went, that's that's not the point.
And she goes, but so anyway, I was I.
Yeah, we were texting Mike and I and I had offered I'm here.
What do you want?
What do you think I should do?
Yeah.
Send me in, coach.
I am your your team member.
I'm your soldier.
I am your servant.
And you seemingly covered up your eyes, looked full up a map, covered your eyes and just pressed somewhere random.
Basically, I knew ahead of time we would need this.
Yeah, everything.
OK, I'm glad bread boxes.
Yeah, well, guess we needed guests for this.
And I was like, well, this is important, I think it's going to be important.
Yeah, I did.
You know, before it was decided, I did research around and was like, oh, maybe I'll do that.
I mean, I'm not sure if I'm going to be like, you know, the frozen margarita place, that's super fun or, you know, maybe they'll send me, I don't know, to a sit down restaurant.
Wow, what a treat.
No, that didn't happen.
The guest, every guest there has been something bad has happened.
Yeah, it is.
I didn't even know what bread box was when I sent you to do it.
Right.
Well, what are we needed the most to find out what it is?
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, I didn't know.
Right.
I don't know about the indoor swing.
I know anything about it.
We'll get into the swings.
I don't know about this.
Okay.
I didn't know.
I still don't know after experiencing it.
I'll tell you what.
One thing I do not need after a long day at a theme park is a hot sandwich on a weird swing set indoors.
We can't get it right with anybody.
This is a good sector keeper.
Everyone's cursed.
We've sent.
I know, I know.
Yeah, it's bad.
It's bad.
It's like everybody's getting pulled into the rift.
We're all part of the rift.
We're all part of the rift.
I did bread box as well.
I did do it.
Yeah.
And I had a chicken salad sandwich and a hot cup of cream of tomato soup.
What a combo.
In the middle of a pretty hot day.
It wasn't summer, but it was hot.
It was definitely hot.
At least it was lunchtime.
It was lunchtime.
So yeah, I did get a little heat for my lunch.
So I had mine for dinner, which I would not recommend.
You don't crave a sandwich, A, at the end of a long theme park day and B, just generally for dinner.
I had the, I believe it was a heated vegan sandwich.
Heated vegan.
Or grilled or something.
Yeah, it was part of the hot sandwich menu.
Oh, hot vegetables.
I think it was listed as.
It was bad.
It was like, I didn't get food poisoning from it, but it's just like,
one of those meals?
Question mark.
Where, when you are served hot vegetables on a toasted wheat bread, it feels like the food poisoning.
Like you're eating the food poisoning is what I mean.
I felt like eating food poison.
Why does this happen every time?
This is what are we doing to ourselves?
To our pizza folks?
To people we like.
We're just, this is.
Every meal someone spilled that out.
This is the third time this has happened.
I did have the tater tots and those were good.
Okay.
But I will also say that I think my meal came out to just a hair under $20 for a sandwich and tater tots.
And that just felt, even though with theme park prices, it felt like a lot.
You're getting that back.
Oh, I mean don't worry about it.
It's lost to time.
We can't take away whatever damage it did to your system.
We can't do that, but we can at least, the money can come back.
So if there's a sir, we'll contribute to a GoFundMe down the road if help problems are.
I'm realizing now how many city walker restaurants offer tater tots as a side.
Yeah.
And that feels like millennials reaching older adulthood.
And it's like, but you still need your little tater tots like school lunch, right?
You know what I was thinking?
Wait a minute.
You're saying this?
You or Mike saying, oh, these people like their kid food.
Oh no.
No, I'm always thrilled when tater dots are on the menu.
I just want to know.
No, there's no, these are adults.
I'm just realizing like widespread how it's like, man, I didn't remember this many places having tater dots a few years ago.
I will say this and I, I liked my meal.
This is one of the better meal, better meals.
I had the sandwich.
I pray.
Yet more.
This was just like, you know, your mom bought some fancier bread at the store and I bought the salad.
Right.
The chicken salad was pretty good.
The soup tasted or whatever the tomato bisque, whatever it's called, tasted right.
And yeah, I ate it.
It was, I was like, oh, good, good.
And then, you know, it was just, it just looked, the presentation was fine.
What kind of bread did you, because the bread is the whole thing.
You don't know.
I don't know what kind of bread I should go back and look.
You put bread in the title.
The pressure is on the bread.
Is the LA restaurant all about the bread?
The bread's pretty good.
If you're putting bread in there, that implies spotlight on bread.
What's up with this bread?
Right.
It was, it seemed to be some sort of multigrain bread.
I don't know if they make it in house.
I do not believe that's the case.
I would severely doubt that.
I'm guessing they don't.
Is this a universal or original restaurant?
Is this a universal restaurant?
That's what I was trying to figure out.
Are there other bread boxes out there?
I didn't see a bread box anywhere else.
It's the one.
They're testing the franchise at the most expensive spot that you could possibly imagine.
Yeah, I think that might be the case.
Because like when you go at least down the results, like it's all Orlando.
It's all universal Orlando.
So I'm guessing this is one of the, yeah, because we've said.
They made this up.
There's no such place as bread box.
Here we are parsing like, oh, so this must be kind of an artisan bakery.
No, it's some fucking shit they thought of to make more money to understaff garbage ingredients.
That's the tourist close-up magic trick though.
And that's something that I feel like.
So I was just at CityWalk the other day, if you can believe it.
My husband had never been inside of Tootsums.
So we went to the, so I said, you simply must.
And we went into the gift shop and we played a really fun game where we covered the price tags on everything and guessed.
And we were always wrong.
It was always more expensive.
A bar of chocolate was 16.
99.
And there was nothing special about it.
Oh, wow.
Jason just fainted.
Well, I was actually at Tootsums yesterday.
So I am familiar with price.
Yes.
None of us learn.
We don't ever.
Not for the show.
Not for this show.
Episode after episode.
Restaurants bad.
Everything and all these places.
And then here we are again.
Boys, boys.
How do you keep doing this to yourselves?
We're doing it for you, sector keeper.
Don't you see?
We're trying to save your life.
To connect it back to Breadbox.
What I think his sentiment for Tootsums, I think is my sentiment also for Breadbox, which is we were walking through and like, yeah, in Tootsums, like a single truffle.
Question mark.
That's like the size of a quarter is four dollars and seventy five cents.
And that's like the cheapest thing that you can get in there.
And, you know, we were looking at it and my husband's comment was just like, wow, this must only, only, only be for people who have never been to city work before.
They have never been to California before.
Maybe see have never been to the United States before and or a chocolate place or a restaurant before and are like, well, this must be the delicacy date here.
And I accept these charges.
And I think that the same could be said for Breadbox, where it's like this must be a hip happening artisanal like bread sandwichy place.
And who am I to criticize it?
They've got porch swing chairs inside.
Now I've seen everything like that's sort of the line of thinking that we find ourselves in.
Why are there porch?
So you can sit in a swing.
And do they swing or are they stationary?
They swing a little bit, but those chains are pretty taut.
And it's the most uncomfortable chair.
Like it's just like hardwood.
And I was watching so many families, so many like 30 something people with like guaranteed lower back pain just muscling through sitting that in that chair for their meal.
Yeah, I didn't sit at the chair.
I didn't sit at the benches, swinging benches or whatever you call them.
But I sat at like a little booth right by the bathroom and I ate my my stuff there.
It was a nice.
We're trying to get away with something.
Why was that so weird?
I ate my soup and sandwich by the toilet.
It feels like you're on an airplane trying to chow down.
What's going on?
There was it was just a nice little cozy spot in the one side of the restaurant.
You found another nook.
I found a cosmic nook to eat my sandwich and my soup.
Yeah, I will say I feel like this place is trying to appeal to millennial parents, question mark, because it has that like vaguely mid-century modern 60s type of aesthetic.
But then there is also the reason why I asked about your bread, Michael.
Yes, is that the front counter?
They've got like these, I want to say, four or five giant lamps that each have like white wheat rye as if you're going to be voting or like as if those are specifically where those types of breads come out.
So it feels like there's this emphasis on the freshness of the bread.
There's this emphasis on that kind of all about the bread, you know, sort of restaurant design.
And yet the bread is forgettable.
Yes, yes.
There's also a wall of painted metal lunch boxes.
Is that right?
I will say that all good.
Did you mean you didn't forget it?
Yeah, it's stuck.
They're doing a thing.
You'll notice all these details as long as you're being forced to notice details.
Yes.
And then this is another thing how I paid.
I didn't pay with food poisoning, but I paid for being there for way too long because I took my job seriously.
Wow.
I took several photos.
Wow.
Wow.
It is chicken salad on.
It says tender chicken, apple crisps, arugula, walnut oil on multigrain bread.
Great.
So it was it was the multigrain.
I don't know.
Do they have a multigrain lamp?
They don't.
Does it?
It's not one of these lamps that says multigrain.
There's also you can get things on Texas toast, and that's not represented on these lights either.
So they're not giving you the full scope of white rye wheat.
And then I actually I can't read the last one.
The last one says walnut oil.
No, these are too small for that.
My problem with this and this is also connecting back to like, you know, Menchie's and my question of like, is this a locals park or not?
Because I feel like this bread box or at least like the concept of it should be inside the theme park because it is a lunch meal.
It's like, you know, the lunchboxes suggest that it is an on the go establishment.
It's an on the go meal.
So I feel like it should be either in the theme park or out of my face.
Yes.
Yes.
Those are the two roads that we find ourselves in the woods.
Do you have a place, a dream spot for bread box at the Universal Resort in Orlando?
Great question.
You can demolish an existing thing.
You could tear down Harry Potter, the castle and put it there if you want it.
I don't say that's a good idea, but I would say I would think bread box would be at home in the Universal Studios, not Islands of Adventure Park.
And I think that there, you know, the string of eateries next to the Richter's burgers, I feel like one of those can be swapped out for bread box.
And in fact, I think there is like a quote unquote New York deli around there.
That's like right outside one of the bathrooms.
I think you could swap that out for a bread box and have it be an elevated sandwich.
Hey, right by the bathroom.
Eat like that.
You can eat right by the bathroom.
You're a little nook.
My little nook.
I ate it there.
I ate my tender chicken at the little nook.
I'd sip my little soup, my warm little tomato soup in the nook.
Lick up my walnut oil.
They lapped it up.
I lapped up the last drop of the soup in the corner.
Yeah, I think it would be interesting to know, do they use the same multigrain bread across the whole Universal Resort?
Is that what it is or is it actually specific to bread box?
That would be interesting to know.
This is very, I don't think I've ever been so interested to know something.
I would like to call and ask a question of our listeners.
If you know, because people know things, if you think they use the same multigrain bread universally at Universal, please let us know.
And if you don't, go to all the places that have a sandwich and tell us.
Look, taste and take photos.
If we don't get an answer on this, I think Sector Keepers stand in hell forever.
That's what I think too.
Please, please.
We gotta know.
Sandwiches that have made everyone sick.
This is a rift in the multiverse and there's a rift with the multigrain.
I think we gotta solve all them.
I think this is and this is not a grain of madness.
We're in the multigrain of madness.
No, because like what flavor from a bite to bite is it?
You don't know.
Rifts form.
There's holes in my sandwich, just like there's holes in the mold.
I feel like there's also a lazy pun with Breadedict Cumberbatch for the multi bread madness.
Just to put it out there.
If we're doing like full like Muppet Vision 3D puns.
Sure.
This is more thought out than most of the businesses we've talked about.
Agreed.
I was just gonna say, Jason, did you actually take a look at any of this stuff in the menu or anything?
I looked at the menu.
I didn't get a chance to eat it.
No, I know that.
I just wanted to get, cause they got a grilled ham and cheese melt.
They got a barbecue brisket melt steak and cheese melt.
I just wondering there's New York style pastrami.
I didn't know if there was something that like would spark your interest.
I don't really like beef in barbecue sauce.
Yeah.
So that would probably rule out the brisket or brisket.
Ham.
You don't like a little barbecue sauce on a brisket?
No.
Really?
Yeah, maybe a little dip, but I don't get brisket or tri tip that much.
I once in a while get a brisket at the wood ranch over here in Burbank, dip a little bit in the sauce.
I'm more of a pulled pork hot link guy.
Okay.
But you're able to dip it.
It's not coming in slathered.
So maybe that's the difference.
That might be, yes.
Yeah, I don't like what happens to that bread, maybe it gets like too slothy.
No, yeah, it just becomes a sponge.
Would they sell a hot link to Jody Moroney's?
Probably, right?
I don't recall.
I wish Jody Moroney's could come back to me.
The Sausage Kingdom.
The Sausage Kingdom.
That's my city walk.
And Sector Keepers City Walk.
Can I share something that is name dropping only to this room?
Yeah, please.
I just remembered that I, in middle school, so I grew up out here in the valley and in middle school, I knew a kid whose uncle was Jody Moroney.
Damn.
And for some reason he was like, yeah, I have all these t-shirts.
Do you want to buy one?
So I asked my mom to give me the advance of my allowance that week so I could buy a Jody Moroney t-shirt and wear it proudly to middle school.
Wow.
And I held onto it for way too long.
Do you recall how much?
It must have been like 10 bucks.
Okay.
I was wondering if he was like up charging kids.
30.
Anyway.
You wrote on it with marker.
Before you ask, this was not purchased at the store like anyone could.
This came straight from the nephew.
A certificate of authenticity.
Yeah.
I'm basically a Moroney myself.
Anyway, continue looking at this shirt.
I wanted to say that I've not touched greatness, but I've been one degree from it.
Wow.
That is an important story for us.
One degree from Great Sausage.
I know.
Thank you.
I'm not sure if this is a good one for all of them, but this one seems like a good one to park and talk to the casting.
Brother a little bit.
Red box opened in 2014.
What closed was something called cigars with a Z.
This was the city walk cigar shop.
Please tell me the Z was a plume of smoke.
Oh, I don't think they were that creative.
They weren't at that level.
They were going for a vibe with the logo that was more classy.
It was very classy.
That's why you call it cigars with a Z is when you're chasing class.
And I think that the clientele was very classy as well from what I could tell from Yelp reviews.
First of all, on the outside, and this is some good city walk nonsense like a car that drove into the roof.
It was just like a big cigar jammed into the side of the.
Yeah.
I appreciate that.
We like that.
That's good.
But then they catered to some like, you know, this isn't just like tourist cigar rubes.
You could be a cigar expert and roll into this place.
And they did.
In one review, somebody encourages people to go to other Orlando cigar shops, including there was a downtown Disney one, apparently.
Closed not too long ago.
Really, really?
Like within the last five years, four or five years.
I think there's there.
Yeah.
They say go to this one because there you will be treated as royalty instead of human filth and excrement.
This is the worst customer service experience I've ever encountered.
This place is full of low life trash, including the bartending staff.
It was a bar as well.
Then.
So I read that.
Right.
And then I was like, do these extend to TripAdvisor?
And I read another review that was clearly written by the same person in which he continued the tale further.
He described the people he did, whoever served them as under the names putz boy, hipster, psycho, then says, my intention is to drive cigars out of business by spreading the gospel of what lousy, rude and erratic service they have.
Now I told this story a little bit out of order because now I'd like to tell you what it was that was so awful that he says he was treated as human excrement.
What happened was he ordered two drinks, one for him and one for his wife.
They said, where is your wife?
He said, she's out shopping.
They said, well, we need to see her ID too.
That's the story.
Oh, no.
That is the end of the story.
Something I'm sure has happened to everyone.
That happens at theme parks very often.
Don't you know who I am?
I'm a husband.
I got to put up with this.
Now you make me put up with this.
So crazy.
Just to confirm, Sosa Family Cigars at Disney Springs says it closed January 2nd, 2023.
It had been there for 25 years.
Wow.
Oh my God.
Well, I run for a cigar store.
Well, and you understand why it happened because they don't treat people like human excrement and make them and check a second ID.
The other story.
This is a guy named Mr.
From Dallas.
All right.
Whenever I go on vacation, I smoke a cigar.
I knew exactly what I wanted.
So I walked into the humidor and grabbed what I wanted.
I went back to the counter to check out.
They charged me for my cigar.
Usual price because I do this a lot.
Lots of cigars.
But the girl then prompted to tell me there is a tip line below.
For what?
You didn't help me to recommend anything.
Oh, no.
Me being an expert.
I walked right in.
I got what I knew.
I don't owe you anything.
You didn't curate a cigar for me.
This is not a big deal until I started to walk away and she goes, you forgot to tip.
I turned around and drew a big zero across this tip line and wrote no tip in bold across the receipt.
I wouldn't be surprised if she'd written one in if I continued to walk away.
That's Mr.
From Dallas.
Right.
So, you know, I know at the top of this episode, I said I was I was proud to be a patriot.
I was proud to be your soldier suggesting a U.
S.
Army situation.
I've never felt more un-American in this moment than hearing the biggest that terrible.
Yeah, that's happened in this country with somebody from this country.
I want to walk into the sea with rocks in my pockets.
I want to end it all.
Yeah, God.
Sir, do you need anything?
No, no, I don't.
I'm here all the time.
Haven't you seen me?
I'm going to the human order to get what I want.
I even know what the price is.
You don't have to tell me what it is.
Can I just throw money at your mouth and just throw it in your fat pocket and we can be done?
This is a tip.
Mr.
Wood suggests what I'm saying, though, that this used to be a place where people would go regularly to hang out.
If he's always going and always wants, this is what I'm saying.
The old days of city walk when you used to locals used to go party there.
That's what I'm saying.
That's fact.
Mr.
has confirmed it is fact.
People used to party that were local.
Yes.
OK, well, now we've confirmed people who were local who are the worst people on Earth.
That's part of the question.
The worst people on Earth used to party at city walk.
The worst tippers.
The real screen name should be the Riddler because every interaction with him is a test.
All right, guys, what are we doing?
Am I out of work as a comedy writer?
I think a little bit.
Time to throw me in, coach.
I need to dust off these cobwebs.
Anyway, I mean, that's what this is.
This is unfortunately what we sent you into.
You could probably smell the cigar.
If cigars still existed, would we all have shared not shared one, but we would all have smoked a cigar walking around the city.
How would we have done it?
I would have been like that scene in the Sandlot when they all chewed nicotine and then barked.
We want a bunch of children trying nicotine products for the first time.
Yeah, with and it would be edited the same with the same America that song.
I feel like that's the sequence that I'm saying.
No, I think you're probably right.
Jason, cigar.
You ever have a cigar?
I've never had a cigar.
I'm trying to think if I ever puffed on a cigar.
I don't know.
My mom would growing up.
Yeah.
Yeah.
With her friends, not like around the house.
Scott ever puffed on a cigar?
Yeah, like bad cigars in college.
That's like a pose in freshman year.
Yeah, I do this.
I do this all the time.
Fuck.
To thoroughly cover the sector, we should have brought cigars with us to city walk.
We could always go again.
Well, not up while Orlando.
You're right.
I'm truly ready to go to Moments.
Do you want to book a ticket?
We'll book one right now.
We'll go back to Orlando right now.
Tomorrow or tonight.
Yeah, maybe.
Okay.
Well, we'll talk about this.
I guess for now, I feel like we've feel like we've made it to the end here.
Boys, boys, Julia, you've completed the sector, the first sector of phase three.
Congratulations.
We got it.
You can see what's appearing in front of you.
There's the stone.
There's the stone.
It's a little dried out shrimp bow rolling down Lombard Street.
Zigging and sagging.
Will it zig again?
No, it's not going to sag.
Wow.
So crusty.
You could tell how dry it is even in stone form.
Well, it's beautiful.
We value this.
We cherish this.
And we thank you, Julia Prescott.
You survived podcast, The Ride, the City of Rock Orlando saga.
Malta, as you heard me saying it right.
City of Rock Orlando saga.
We got to get out of here.
Let's exit through the plug portal.
Is there anything you would like to play?
Yes.
I wrote on a show called Rock Paper Scissors.
It was created by the very funny Kyle Stigina and Josh Lerman.
And we are nominated for an Annie.
That means animation award.
Since people outside of the animation industry don't really know.
It's a good party for the people who do it.
Yeah, I think it's going to be funny and it's coming to Paramount Plus.
And I may be by the time this releases hosting a podcast called The Worst Place in the World,
sort of like how did this get made but with theater, Broadway, bombs, et cetera, probably featuring a lot of your faves.
And I should also say because I also feel like this is a plug I can only say to this room.
But I so I don't act on screen often, but I recently did.
And I can't say much about it.
I got to be in, let's say, a series of marketing things for Universal Studios.
That will be seen by people eventually.
Wow.
And I got to play myself, question mark.
So stay tuned for that.
Wow.
As vague as could be.
I mean, you dropped the key detail, but.
Yeah, I will just say that dreams really do come true.
Shoot for the minion.
You'll land among the stars.
Wow.
The star way.
But they stay tuned.
I feel a deep connection to Universal, not only being the young pope of CityWalk, but perhaps the ambassador.
That is exciting.
Well, yeah, well, thanks.
Thank you for shining your papal light on us.
Keep us posted on what's going on with that.
As for us, thanks to Aaron Gardner for the art, our own Mike Carlson and Zach Reno for the theme music.

I mean, we're deep into it.
I'm starting to feel like a real bucket of sludge.
I feel a little bit of dark sludge.
Yeah.
And hopefully it'll help us.
Where are we going tomorrow?
We're staying up the oh food court time.
Yeah, well established.
How much you like the food?
Oh, yeah, yeah, should be great.
That's right.
