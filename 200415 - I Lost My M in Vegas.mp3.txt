 Five, four, three, two, one.
  Bright Light City, gonna set my soul,  gonna set my soul on fire.
  Welcome to Podcast The Ride, The Second Gate.
  I'm Jason Sheridan, here as always with Mike Carlson.
  I'm here, Viva Las Vegas indeed.
  And Scott Kierdner.
  I'm leaving Las Vegas.
  How does that, that's a Sheryl Crow song.
  It's not really a big one.
  Switched it up.
  I don't know any lyrics beyond that, but I did what I could.
  What other Vegas songs are there?  A lot, I think.
  Yeah, probably.
  This Viva Las Vegas is if you ever rock Vegas.
  Right.
  So you're freshly back.
  Freshly back from Vegas.
  Vegas vacation.
  A Vegas vacation.
  Of course.
  Yeah.
  So did you end up feeling more like Rusty Griswold,  scoring big on all the tables,  pretending to be Nick Papagiorgio,  or did you feel like Sid Caesar having a heart attack?  Oh.
  Well, that's interesting.
  Like Vegas, you know, it's the highs to highs  and the lowest to lows, you know?  So a little bit of both.
  So you're saying you were up like $5 million  and then you were like, you know, like strung out with a hooker  in a $5 hotel room?  Well, not quite, not quite.
  A little uncomfortable and grumpy.
  Before we get to the main topic, let's just go through the trip.
  Tell us how you got there, all that type of stuff.
  How I got there.
  Okay, so because this is, we're going to talk about the M&M store  and the 3D movie within the M&M store.
  Yes.
  But I lost my M in Vegas.
  The primary.
  Rolls off the tongue.
  Just hits the ear like a beautiful symphony.
  But yeah, this is also a little travelogue.
  Yes.
  Like my adventure on the Queen Mary.
  Right.
  What did you, what were you?  I said just a little bit.
  What did you do?  You flew out there.
  I flew out to Vegas.
  Yeah, I went to Vegas for a few days.
  You were not alone.
  I was not alone as you guys and I've been seeing someone  for a little while now.
  Yeah, a while, yes.
  And we went to Vegas together, went on a little trip, flew in,  flew in and out, beautiful McCarran Airport.
  Meant to look up exactly what crimes McCarran did.
  McCarran, a notoriously corrupt Nevada politician  that the airport is named after.
  Right.
  That's okay.
  There's plenty of corrupt people that airports  have been named after, I assume.
  And full credit to her because she, you know,  we stayed at the Park MGM, which you have stayed at before.
  Two times, yes.
  Yeah.
  And she, there is, so there are these apps,  these slot machine apps you can play on your iPhone  called MyVegas.
  And she had been playing these for a while and had enough  that we like got a free night and I would like claim  two free drinks somewhere and a free appetizer.
  I mean, this sounds like heaven.
  This sounds like the perfect setup for a vacation.
  I love it.
  So, but, you know, so we went and most importantly,  she also picked great seats for David Copperfield,  Live the Impossible.
  Yeah.
  Yes.
  Yes.
  And if you don't recall this, then we did an episode  about David Copperfield's insane show at the MGM Grand.
  Mike and I had seen it and we were mainly describing it  to Jason who had not seen it.
  Now you have seen it.
  You've experienced Live the Impossible.
  And kind of I've been talking about like, oh, we should go,  we should go to Vegas.
  She had never been to Vegas before.
  And I've been a couple of times.
  But that kind of lit the fire under my ass.
  I was like, well, if we go, we have to see Copperfield.
  Yeah.
  Of course.
  And as I was saying, because I, that's, that's where my  response video was filmed.
  Right in front of the Copperfield Theater in the MGM Grand.
  Next to the Blue 32 statue.
  Yeah.
  To the Chay Pack.
  Succession news.
  Yeah.
  Yeah.
  And Jason Willner texted me after he saw that and he said,  what did you think of the show?  And I said, it was the greatest theatrical experience of my life.
  Yeah.
  It is really, so I don't think I was fully prepared.
  Even with you heard beat by beat.
  Beat by beat.
  But I, and I have to give the man credit because it's a very  interestingly paced show.
  It is, I mean, I kept saying the whole thing.
  I was reminded about Vegas.
  A couple of things.
  One, they, there are parts of Vegas.
  Uh, like our main chunk of this episode is like, if you build a  theme park infrastructure and went, okay, we will come back to  check on this.
  Never.
  Uh, and then there are other parts where it's design elements that  you kind of, you kind of recognize that this is art.
  Oh, David Hockney did this, but he drew it on an iPad and now it's  rejected on a screen and a lot of it, um, where it's like, oh, the  aesthetic is all aesthetics.
  There's a lot of hanging glass everywhere.
  There's a lot of hanging silver rock.
  Like you recognize it, but it's, it's just overwhelming.
  It looks good in the concept art, but once everything's been barfed on  and there's like, you know, plastic yard glasses littered everywhere.
  What people say theme parks are the simulation of reality, like  simulation.
  Oh, it's so fake Vegas kind of it.
  And I don't mean that like as a derogatory, but it is, it is very  overwhelming.
  I mean, I got back in two days later, we were at fries doing the fries  event and I was still mentally like, we were questioning this because you  were there and you were like, look, I'm just still exhausted.
  I've been to vape, but it was like this two day.
  That's a lot of days to recover from a no time zone shift.
  You seem like you're still recovering now.
  I'm still a little grog.
  But why, why I think it was just, there's just so much mental stimuli.
  There's so much sound and lights.
  There's so much of everything lights.
  There's too many lights.
  Yeah.
  Do you not think Las Vegas is overwhelming?  It is, but I'm I bounce back the next day.
  I'm not like, oh, it is funny.
  I mean, I got back from Vegas the week and a half ago.
  The, I don't know when, which episode will come out first.
  You were saying though, you napped immediately in Vegas.
  Well, I didn't feel very, we took the first flight out.
  And so I was like, seven AM, something like that.
  Yeah.
  And so like, I was like, I'm not going to do this.
  And so like, I was up to like, you know, get dressed and like,  get in a lift and every like four 30 in the morning and stuff.
  Sure.
  You flew out of Burbank.
  It did fly out of Burbank, which is a smaller airport.
  And it's very cool because you get to walk on the tarmac.
  Like, it's very, yeah.
  Pan Am or something.
  Yeah.
  So getting into Vegas at like nine 30 in the morning, checking in,  dropping the bags and making a beeline for the M and M store.
  You went, that was the first thing you did.
  Very first thing.
  And I have a suspicion here.
  I have a suspicion that in a more relaxed state, you would have enjoyed this  experience a little more.
  Well, I did enjoy a chunk of the experience.
  I mean, I had a great time in Vegas.
  I had a great time.
  I just did not sleep.
  I prefer, I read,  I like a lot better because you just kind of like zonk out on the flight,  but like I never sleep well if I have to get on like a seven AM flight.
  I just feel awful.
  And then I, it's the same time I were like, well,  maybe a cup of coffee will make me feel bad.
  It just makes me feel a hundred times worse.
  I would completely understand what you're saying.
  If I hadn't seen evidence, the contrary, when we went to Orlando,  Orlando is a different animal for you.
  I slept like a baby at your house.
  We only slept for like five hours before we had to get up.
  Yeah.
 But we were, you know, you have that juice, that show juice,  that positive vibe.
  That makes me more tired because the adrenaline's going from the show.
  And then when you wake up in the morning, you're like, ah, now I'm like,  I'm depleted.
  I mean that, I mean, that might also just be that like Orlando,  the Orlando magic, you know, as they say,  it's just interesting.
  He said as a basketball team,  I'm like, oh, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like,  I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like,  as a basketball team says.
 It's interesting.
  Cause you're saying I got up early for a flight and it devastated me.
  And I had to take a nap.
  Well, and, but in Orlando, we slept for our excuse.
  And in Schomburg, we slept for about five hours.
 We got on a, I mean,  not as quite early, but it was still like the turnaround was like five hours.
  We were up and then we were going.
  And I don't think you slept the whole trip.
  I was going to Orlando.
 I got a nap or two in.
 Don't get me wrong.
  Yeah.
 I, I, and I like Vegas, but like, it was also cold.
  And that's true.
  It was a little cold.
  Like I don't, I, the desert isn't my, I'll last a few days in the desert,  but it's not my favorite.
  Right.
 Vegas doesn't give you strength.
 Orlando gives you strength.
  That's my hypothesis.
  I did walk like seven miles a day in Vegas.
 Like you walk a lot.
  You walked so much in Orlando.
  We walked like twice.
 We all walked a ton and you walked like double amount  and you were fine.
 You were rare and go.
 Like you were, you know,  it's that Orlando feeling.
  That's what I'm, I'm just, it's interesting.
 Cause I think just Vegas,  the feeling exhausts you in general.
 Whereas Orlando, I think you're like,  you were just energized.
  I mean, look, I found some very relaxing.
 It was a little too cold.
  It was a little too cold for the pool, but like half of the Bellagio is just  nice alcoves with couches, like pleasant views into the courtyards and like  artwork everywhere.
 So you take a seat, you know, you have some slushes.
  We kind of did the, we did the slot.
  A lot of places doing the night like slushes in Vegas are very popular,  but like best friend, we went to the Roy Choi, LA celebrity chef,  Roy Choi has a restaurant and they have like nicer versions of the classic  like Tuesday slushes.
  Yes, I had a green apple slush in a little cup.
  We had like a ginger and Jameson one and we had a Hennessy and Coke one.
  Did you like the food?  The food was great.
 I mean, I was, I thought it would be different,  but it's like his hit.
 It's like, he's like Korean barbecue tacos and kimchi rice.
  And sure.
 It was very good.
  This is all nice, but I'm a little, when are we going to get to the fireworks  factory? This is one of my favorite store.
 I have a feeling you guys don't love this  thing as much as me.
 I'm just saying I want to get to it someday.
 No, it's fine.
  I hit the, I hit the, I hit the quick highlights and then we'll do a little  Copperfield and then we'll get to it.
 Sure.
 Thank you.
 My, thanks.
  A great hotel, clearly going for younger people.
 Italy.
 I mean, incredible.
  Scott, you, you Italy.
 It's an amazing Italy is like, how would you describe it?  It's like a block long Italian market with lots of stalls and everything's very,  where you can get a big pile of pretty cheap food, like really good meats and  cheese, but like for pretty cheap and cheap stuff started to find in Vegas.
  It's not hard to find, but it's like garbage.
 This is like quality food for  cheap.
 And when, when you are like, have a meal where it's like, Oh, let's just  go eat at the hotel.
 When your options are like pizza and fresh pasta,  places stay open pretty late.
  There's one stall that's just doing pizza slices and 3 AM if you want.
  Yeah.
 And the tell us stuffed fried dough, like on the, yeah.
 All night.
  Were you up? How late were you up every night?  Two or three one night we went to all on the record, which is like the speak easy  kind of, yes, I've been, I've been multiple times.
  Tenders told us like, Oh, it's not a club.
 And it's like after 10 minutes, it's a,  yeah, it's a club.
 It's a night.
 It's two.
 It's a lot.
 I'll ask about 30 minutes  because it was just so much.
  Well, there are, there are little areas that you can go and then aren't as  intense.
 There's like an outdoor ish area there.
 I mean, it's not really  outdoors.
 Okay.
 Maybe it was a very crowded night and then there's the secret  room there as well.
 That was very cool.
 That's where it was.
 There's a wall.
  That's a fake thing and it's a door and you go in and it's a little speakeasy  room.
 Just watching my beloved red and yellow melts.
 They're just melting in  the desert.
 Hey, private room or do this is the evening.
 It was very thin.
  Yeah.
 Eataly high marks is very funny because it's across the street from the  MGM Graham, which is a very nice hotel park.
 MGM nice, clearly going for a  younger crowd.
 There's no buffet.
 The food's all pretty good.
 Yeah.
 A reasonable  size, casino floor, not overwhelming a tram, a free people mover, a tram that'll  take you up to the Bellagio that is great.
 And gambling.
 Yeah.
 Slots.
 We really  liked my girlfriend won like 80 bucks on the Britney Spears slot, which is so  fun.
 It's got the bass vibrations.
 It's blasting clips of the music videos.
 I  won $80 on a Blake Shelton slot machine.
 We saw that was occupied.
 Cause it's  now they have a fun thing where like there's a computer console and you can  play a fake video game while you're doing the slots.
 So there's like extra  elements of just then the normal, like you pull the slot and you don't  understand what the amounts mean.
 Now it feels like you're actually doing  something else.
 You're probably, it's just a fake thing, but still it's fun.
 We  were both kind of up and down on the virtual blackjack where it's like the  fake dealer and no one's yelling at you.
 That's fun.
 I don't know.
 I probably  broke even.
 Oh, we, I don't know.
 I just put a little in the slots or,  okay.
 You did not see Aerosmith and the deuce is our wild tour.
 We did not see.
  And Gaga was not there.
 Neither of them were there, but we saw Copperfield.
 Yes.
  Now do I have some Copperfield observations written down and I have some  questions and I was thinking you guys could ask me some questions of like, did  he still do this, that sort of thing? Because I feel like, I think he does most  of the things.
 I think it's just the order in which he does.
 Are we still  shaking your tail feather? Do we still have a duck that is walking around to  shake your tail feather? No.
 Tail feathers are not being shaken.
 There was  no duck.
 Whoa.
 Okay.
 Duck is out.
 Cause it was really a fragment of a previous  thing.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 I think that didn't make sense already.
 So that's probably a  good trim though.
 I missed the duck.
 Alright.
 Skeleton, the skeleton of the  dinosaur.
 Of course.
 That's a big fan.
 Cause of course it was not in our show.
  That was not in yours.
 Not in mine, but in Scott's and on most people that go  see the skeleton.
 Maybe broken that night.
 The skeleton is after he waves to his,  does the symbol to his father.
 Right.
 So we are back to it.
 It culminates in, in  skeleton.
 I think because he, that is clearly just video editing.
 Like that's  just a trick.
 That's just, you edited a movie and I think he was like, and one  last thing, one last bit of the impossible, because that is what I was really  impressed by in the show.
 The first half is kind of a standard magic show with a  lot of like, Oh, wow.
 Like he makes, he appears on a motorcycle and then he  appears on a Lincoln.
 How checked out was he? I, I was hard to tell cause he was  doing kind of like the snide delivery, the like toss off like Jesus Christ.
 Come  on.
 Like he, that's the persona and I, I want, I have to go back and watch a TV  specialist cause I was like, I don't remember it being the sticky and the TV  specials cause he was kind of like winking at the audience a lot.
 Like, yeah.
  Were there people from out of town that didn't speak English that he would goof  on? Uh, I think one person maybe from Albania.
 Of course.
 Um, they're all  playing.
 I'm convinced they're all plants.
 I, I was convinced the person blue 32,  which incredible RC.
 We were maybe 10 feet away from blue 32 coming out of the  case.
 You don't know.
 And you hadn't heard the other patron episode.
 Blue 32 is a  blue alien that met David Copperfield's father when David Copperfield's father  worked at area 51.
 And there's a lot of story that we got into on that other  episode.
 But if you're behind this paywall, you can go back and listen to that.
  He is a being of pure love.
 His message is love and he also loves fucking poon.
  Yes.
 He is a big old horn dog.
 Yes.
 He is.
 As I was watching the show, I forgot  he is crass and horny in addition to giving a message of love.
 She likes hot.
  She's hot, David.
 Watching him like wiggle around and then they put some on the  box and he's like a little robot.
 Get lucky.
 We changed the song.
 Yeah.
 Does it  get lucky? Uh, he, I, I think when he's like the mayor Pete dance, they made it  topical.
 Uh, is that what he taught? He does this thing where he's like, oh,  my old flame, you still stripping and it's an old lady.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 I'm  convinced.
 I'm convinced.
 They're a plant.
 The lady's not there.
 There's no lady.
  It's just a shot.
 Okay.
 That's what I was trying to figure out too.
 Cause I  realized at a certain point, cause he did the like turning a tissue into a rose.
  Yeah.
 Six feet behind us.
 Like we were front row center.
 Like we were almost  underneath the UFO.
 Yeah.
 That's great.
 And get good seats for this is not the  priciest thing to get really good seats on par with other Vegas shows and cheaper  than like big musical acts.
 Um, uh, I realized watching that though, like the  cameras have a monitor on the front so he can see what in theory you would think  what's being filmed, but I'm trying to think if it's, if he is seeing what's on  the screens.
 Cause I think sometimes that's a live feed from those cameras.
 And  sometimes I think it's old video.
 It's like shot videos and he's just so precise  with his movements and wears the same outfit every night.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 He does.
  He did advance.
 Uh, when you guys saw it, did he play a clip of the Meek Mill Rick  Ross song, black magic? I don't think that goes David Copperfield, David Copperfield.
  No, no, no, no.
 This is a Maybach music track that they sample.
 Wow.
 In between  what, uh, Oh sugar sugar.
 You can't hurry love.
 Um, what were the, I'm a believer.
  He's playing all of these songs and then it cuts to an excerpt as people are filing  it of the Maybach music song.
 Wow.
 You got to see this again.
 It's like there's a  video where Rick Ross brings out David Copperfield to this song.
 So the Copperfield  is hung out with Rick Ross.
 Wow.
 Whoa.
 Oh boy.
 That's crazy.
 Exciting.
 Uh, uh,  ooh, hey here.
 Just, just, just so you see it, just to see these folks together.
  Oh my gosh.
 Yes.
 Very good.
 This is excellent.
 Rapping.
 Yeah.
 I have to say  this is some of the best wrapping I've ever seen.
 Ha ha.
 What's your name Rick?  Okay, Rick.
 Okay.
 So Rick and Rick has a beard.
 All right.
 Rick with the beard.
  Now why keep your hands on the handkerchief and uh, uh,  so I should say after the show we went out into the lobby and asked, and I feel  like one of you also asked this, is that statue of please blue 32?  Cause there's blue 32 above the bar and the merch stand.
 Is that for sale?  And we were told, no, that's from David's private collection.
 Whoa.
 David's  personal collection.
 And I said, do you get asked that a lot?  And she just nodded yes.
  The only merch besides a t-shirt with his face on it and the blue 32 fanny pack  available for sale was like a logo t-shirt for the Island.
 Mousha K.
 Yeah.
  Oh, you can buy Mousha K.
 You can buy a Mousha K.
 Wow.
 And also if you haven't  heard the episode, yeah, this is, well, it's his island where monkeys someday  will do things for you.
 Yeah.
 They'll hug.
 They'll hug you.
 I believe they'll  crawl over you and give you love.
 Wow.
 Yeah.
 Love.
 Love David.
 Monkey.
 Love  David.
 Uh, that's exciting.
 Wow.
 Um, but I mean you were in, even though you knew  it all.
 So this is good because if listeners listen to our episode and they  don't want to go to the show, so they think it's spoilers that maybe doesn't  matter.
 Maybe the experience.
 Yeah.
 It's all other thing to see it in person.
  Because again, like this sort of stuff, even if you see like a touring magic act,  like it's a pretty, I was surprised by how kind of intimate the theater was.
 It  was smaller than I was expecting.
 Everything was much closer than I was  expecting.
 And it's not a room.
 You expect a UFO.
 You expect a goddamn UFO to  be in.
 Jesus Christ.
 Like he kept, he would give like an instruction real fast.
  And when someone didn't get it, he would go, Jesus Christ, come on.
 Like, and it  was the right amount of body for like that kind of out of town audience.
 Uh, but  it's either all plans.
 I'm convinced they're all plants and he goes, Jesus  Christ, come on.
 And like it's the same bit with almost everybody where they  don't know what he's doing and he's making fun of them.
 I mean, it's all Mr.
  I mean halfway through.
 Yeah.
 The first half is a traditional magic show.
 And  then halfway through he turns to like, and this is a magic inspired story where  it becomes much more play like how, how is that? How great is that moment when  you realize, oh, here's the turn.
 Yeah.
 Sit down everyone.
 I imagine my father's  warehouse, uh, my father's secret warehouse and the things he left me.
 I mean,  it's just so you're like, oh, you're not, this isn't quite magic.
 That's a,  a puppet.
 Although blue 32 does appear, you know, I mean it in and of itself is  magically realistic.
 Yeah.
 A guy, an audience, a person helps with the thing  whose sister had passed.
 Was that in your shows? Yeah, that's always, that's  always there.
 They're always helping.
 Yep.
 Yeah.
 Fake.
 Is it possible?  Oh, what are you playing? This is a black magic.
 Okay.
 Hmm.
 I'm going to have  to plug that into the episode there.
 Yep.
 Yes.
 The idea.
 So, so he has a fictional  scenario where someone's sister died and they get to do magic.
 This brother gets  to do magic in honor of the sister, but it happens every show, every show.
 It's so  ridiculous.
 A lot of siblings die.
 You get the email.
 Yeah.
 So we all have the  email now.
 And mine of course had the skeleton in it.
 They didn't even take it  out.
 Oh, wow.
 They didn't even, cause yeah.
 So basically before the show you put  your phone in a box.
 They say like, you'll get an email and it's like, they send  you an email already and they said, don't look at it yet.
 And then when at the end  it'll say, it says everything that happened during the show.
 So it has all the  specifics and it has everything that happened, but they didn't bother to take  the skeleton out of our email.
 So it's just in the email.
 Right.
 So I'll be honest,  the illusion was a bit broken for us when you're reading a letter that's describing  what you saw.
 Right.
 It is some of it is not what you saw.
 Yes.
 I forget.
 There was  one moment where I was like, I think that video is not a lot.
 Like I would, there's  one or two where we caught, I mean, we're close enough.
 Jane was like, I think I  see a drone holding up the UFO.
 Like the, uh, like, is that what it is? Where that  like there might, the corners might be the propeller, like, but we weren't sure  we weren't a hundred percent sure.
 Regardless, it does go pitch black and then  suddenly there's a giant UFO.
 No matter how it's operated.
 That's it's very, very  impressive.
 That blue 32 has to see his family one last time to say goodbye.
 I don't  know that that part was thought out very well.
 He died.
 We can't rehash this, but  I'm going to, he's going to die.
 And then he doesn't die.
 I guess he's going to die.
  Cause he gave David a time stone.
 Yeah.
 The time stone.
 Once you get time stones  involved, you only get so many.
 And if, uh, your heart's, if your time stones start  failing or you give some away to a friend and that's the end of you, then your  clock, your clock's running out.
 Very, very simple.
 David, David, very simple.
  I used to have 10 time stones and eight of them.
 I gambled away and, uh, I was  drinking too much and it's shriveled up and you're getting my last.
 So that's the  end of me.
  If I should have been smarter about all this, you know, way I know about love, but  I don't know about time stone management.
 This is, if this sounds crazy, this is  the show.
 Like this is basically the show.
 Only in Vegas.
 Yeah.
 You know, only in  Vegas.
 It's cradling him like the Christ child.
 He does cradle him lovingly.
  As he does, he intones about love and they didn't listen.
 They'd only, you loved  me.
 Only you cocoon me in your arms.
 And David is like tossing the lines off as if  he's just doing the rest of the show.
 So sorry.
 I could, they've danced to you.
  Human beings are heathens.
 You never know the depths of cruelty that the human race  can sink to and they crucified you.
 You're thrown in the trash pile of life.
  Oh, well, and here we go.
 You gotta give him credit.
 Kind of predicted baby Yoda  before baby Yoda though.
 It is very, it's protecting a child.
 Yeah.
 The child  important mission.
 Yeah.
 Oh, we got pissed when he saw the Mandalorian.
 I bet he  threw something through the TV and you're telling me everyone in the world loves  this.
  But it's not like that.
 I mean, it's, it's not like that.
 It's not like that.
  And you're telling me everyone in the world loves this.
 And yet no one, I, I, I don't  it's, they just, you know, reveal it all at once.
 It's just available everywhere.
  Everyone's watching it.
 There's shirts of it.
 There's, there's no suspense.
 I've  kept blue off of merchandise.
 I've made it.
 You can't see his picture anywhere.
  That's the way to build suspense.
 You don't have to be an M life member to see  baby Yoda.
 Check the records.
 Mr.
 Mr.
 John Favreau must have been a fan of the  John Favreau must have been in the audience for one of my performances.
  Check the record.
 He must, he must have stolen this from me.
 He's of course  saying that he's of course saying that to monkeys on the Island of Muzhikay.
 Fetch  the tapes.
 Monkeys are going through trying to figure out if John Favreau ever was  there.
 That's the wrong night.
 No, not the political speech writer, John Favreau,  the swingers guy.
 The other one.
 The tapes, the heavier one.
 He lost a lot of  weight, but he's still a little, come on Roy.
 Joy's best friend.
 Don't you monkeys  know how to scan footage? God damn.
 How am I ever going to unleash you to give  love to my customers? And you didn't settle my lawsuit.
 It's the last time I  hire monkey attorneys.
 It's pretty good show.
 Honestly, you have Copperfield on an  island with all monkeys.
 It's sort of a cast away where he's the only one talking.
  You know, you do get emotion out of the monkeys.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 You fall in love  with the monkeys and they're not treated well.
 They got to get him on Kweeby.
 You  know, we got to get some more magic on these.
 I think Netflix is one or two magic  things, but they don't promote them a lot.
 Well, if they can't get him to get  Lance Burton, who's already a content creator.
 Well, yeah, like his restaurant,  just slide it down to Lance Burton.
 Lance, I don't Lance Burton.
 Yeah.
 Lance Burton  is made of course the movie Billy.
 Top it.
 Anyway, we got to do it soon.
 Yeah.
  Well, so I mean that was, that's kind of the long and short of it.
 Yeah.
 We had a  good time.
 Glad you're part of the club now.
 Um, and if we're, if we're talking  about nonplussed performances, uh, then that is a perfect segue into the realm of  the professor, which is the M and M's store on the strip in Las Vegas.
 Uh, and  it's mainly the three D movie within.
 I lost my M in Vegas and that's what  you're, you're in the store and you're watching the movie, but within that also  you're in the M and M's lab, the M and M's laboratory.
 Um, I, you know, but  before that, but if, so if you, if you've never been to this thing or if you don't  know where it is or how to get to it, if you're, so if you're staying in Vegas,  it's close to the MGM grant.
 MGM grant is probably the main hotel that it is  close to.
 It's part of something called the showcase mall, which is an  incredibly confusing complex.
 I was trying to find a movie theater there and  got way lost.
 I'm on a sky bridge that leads to nothing.
 And the Coca-Cola store  is part of that.
 Yeah.
 The Coca-Cola store is a few doors down.
 The landmark is  a hundred foot tall, a Coke bottle.
 Right.
 Um, this, this mall is pretty, in general,  this is like a hub of the kind of dumb nonsense that we like with that, with  like, okay, right now a hundred foot Coke bottle.
 There's Denny's in there.
 Yep.
  There's a hard rock cafe.
 Now let's hold on there.
 I, you can't undersell that  part of the complex because you go over, if you go from park MGM, the other side  of the street, like we're in New York, New York and park MGM are you cross a  bridge over Las Vegas Boulevard.
 And the first thing you are greeted by is a  three story building.
 Denny's on the bottom floor, hard rock on the top too.
  Kind of a fall from grace for the hard rock.
 Like kind of the upstairs neighbors  to upstairs neighbors.
 It's kind of obscured the sign by the sky bridge and  like it's competing for attention for like a Skechers logo and a Marshall  and Ross Marshall.
 It is the boringest store.
 This, they have this, this amazing  real estate and it's just a Ross there.
 That strip was like, that was the first  thing we did after we dropped our bags was go over to the M and M store and I'm  like, this, it's nine in the morning.
 Like this is too much.
 This is too much.
  I was like, this is sad.
 Our hotel is so nice and MGM is nice.
 I was like, this  strip is so odd.
 And then we walked into the M and M store and that smell,  you warned me, but I was not feeling very good.
 And I was like, we got to see  this movie.
 We got to get it.
 And then you're rushing through the smell.
 Like  it's like it's carbon monoxide smell.
 It's like trying to breathe it in.
 Hurry.
  Where is it? Fourth floor all the way up.
 I mean, by the time I got out to the  fourth floor, I was like, I feel like I'm going to be sick.
 I was going to tip out  of the fourth floor down on fall down onto the strip through the window.
 It's like  whatever canister smell canister they were using for their fake chocolate smell in  the M and M store.
 It's like mildew started growing.
 Like it's, it's just, it's  like off.
 It's like something's wrong with the smell.
 It ran out in 2000 and now  it's just like the specks of chocolate and Legionnaires disease.
 Or it's like if,  if like somebody does left a pile of M and M's behind like a heater in there  and no one's found it.
 And it's just like, it's sort of made it's the smell part  of the heating system.
 No, it's yellows corpse.
 Yeah.
 He's been running away for  years.
 Yes.
 The M and M's 5,000 couldn't find them.
 No one could hear his high  radiator constant screams.
 Now the theater does not smell.
 No, no.
 The smell does  not go into the theater, which is fine.
 Yes.
 So you're, I mean, there's not a lot  to say about the M and M store itself.
 There is a fun, once you get to the fourth  floor, this is where the attractions are because it also forget if it's still there.
  Maybe you could tell me if there's like a race car that's M and M's branded and I  have pictures with M's who are in like NASCAR racing gear.
 So that's potentially  something that's happening up there or used to, I don't recall.
 I think there was more  like put your face on M and M's.
 Sure.
 I mean, obviously the personalized, which I think  the cheapest thing you go buy was like $22 because you have to fill a contraption with  the personalized M and M's and it only makes sense.
 Oh, two candies.
 Great.
 Yeah.
 That's  that should be, that should only cost me about 15 cents.
 The one floor is just like fill  up a thing, like big tubes of M and M's that you could fill.
 I mean, it was a very, it's  a very thorough story.
 If you like M and M's.
 Yeah.
 And I'm a big peanut M and M guy.
  Really? Is that your top? I think that's my top.
 Like, Crafter, if you're on set, if I'm  on set, like there's, there's very good chance I'm wired on coffee and peanut M and M's.
  Just way to go way to ground to shoot.
 Wired.
 Scott, what's your preference? I mean, regular,  but then within that holiday, the holiday ones make me have interesting.
 I like just a red  and green.
 Okay.
 But like the norm, those are the normal flavor, but you like the festive,  the festive nature.
 I feel like I go regular or peanut butter.
 Peanut butter is solid.
  Peanut butter is very good.
 Sure.
 Sure.
 So you're, you're heading up to this movie theater.
  I didn't know about any of this.
 Now it's a thing I tell everybody, Oh, you're going to Vegas.
  You got to go to the M and M store movie.
 But I didn't know.
 We just stumbled into it.
  I just saw some signage that said free 4d movie.
 Yes.
 Oh man.
 You're kidding me.
 I remember  the first time we went to, I was on such a high, because via a strange in I had, I was able to  get a free meal, including drinks and drinks and drinks and drinks and drinks and drinks and drinks  and drinks and drinks and drinks.
 And I had a big old beer and the fat burger people could not  have been nicer.
 It was, I was just on the high from this experience, sandal and nice little beer  buzz.
 Uh, so I was, I was having a great day.
 This is what I think might factor into because  you're there, you're stressed out early in the morning.
 You're sleepless.
 Me.
 I'm like, I just had  a beer.
 I'm, I'm feeling fine.
 I, I, I, I'm, I'm in heaven.
 I took a quick nap, bye-bye.
  You resigned.
 And then we had pizza at Italy and I felt like a million bucks.
 Okay.
 So  the thing I like about Vegas is you can do whatever you want at any given time.
 You can probably  find where, and whatever your heart desires, you can, uh, nap.
 You can nap on the other side of the  bed.
 You can ride a free tram just back and forth.
 It goes to insane real estate.
 The largest,  the largest privately funded real estate project in the country, the city center Aria complex.
  Interesting.
 I like it in there.
 Uh, so yeah, so, so in my world, like 40 movie, oh my God, I  got it.
 I don't think I even noticed the smell.
 Did they agree that you guys did? That's what's  interesting.
 We've talked about this before.
 It doesn't seem like you registered the smell.
 I think  the way Jason was in Orlando, where he's ignoring any problem that exists, I think that's the  way I was in Vegas.
 Also give me a beer and I'm, uh, I'm, I'm a thousand percent.
 I'm feeling great.
  The smell rushing up the stairs.
 I don't notice this at all.
 The smell was so bad.
 I'm sure it  knocks down my enjoyment of anything in the store.
 I was horrible.
 Okay.
 You were, it was very early  for you.
 Beer for you.
 Was I, did I have a beer in me or anything? Yes.
 No, I don't.
 I, you know, I  think it was the smell of the beer.
 I think it was the smell of the beer.
 I think it was the smell of  that beer.
 I was not.
 My last time I was in that situation.
 I think that's what you were,  that's what is your last experience of flavoring.
 Yes.
 No, I don't.
 I, I think it was in the middle  of the day.
 I don't think we had it.
 Anything to drink.
 This is I think the crucial, you  have to be a little bit buzzed to love.
 And cause also the same day after that I had a bunch of  time to kill.
 I never been to the movie theater there and we ended up seeing in that same  complex, Jurassic world.
 And I think from that good mood, I didn't think Jurassic world was  like, it was that beer talking.
 Wow.
 That was more fun to love.
 It was more fun to be in a  loving mood.
 Sure.
 Yeah.
 I liked it.
 I liked it more when I watched it like with the Christmas  tree on with the whole family.
 Like that was, that was fun.
 Sure.
 Um, so you know, I'm, I'm  racing up the stairs and on the, on the way up, you're seeing movie posters because you're  going to see M and yellow or M and yellow, red and yellow who you love from the commercials.
 And  they're going to be in their own movie, their own non feature length film, their own nine minute film.
  Sounds great to me.
 And then you get a little taste of like what other movies would be that they're  in, including Ms.
 In black, uh, which has the tagline protecting the earth from the scum of the  candy bowl.
 Uh, not to be confused with women in black too, which we found at fries electronics  with the tagline, skip ahead, protecting the earth from the cum of the universe.
 I might still  prefer women in black too, but, uh, still happy to see a little men in black nod.
 Um, I, and you know,  and this is also a good reminder that you're going to see, you're going to see, you know, the  characters from this Christmas ad that is the perennial Christmas ad that will never go away.
  It's this and the Cadbury Easter.
 Uh, yeah, they will never refilm.
 Yes.
 Right.
 Uh, um, but that one  with Santa where Santa faints, he does exist.
 I do exist.
 Um, and the thing you always forget about  that, who the, you guys know offhand who the M and M's are.
 I do.
 Yes.
 Yeah.
 Voiced over great Billy  West, one of the greatest ever.
 Uh, and J K Simmons is yellow.
 I forget that fact a lot.
 It's so, it's,  it's so not his usual character, but he has done like he was in guys and dolls in the like nineties  revival with Nathan Lane.
 He was one of the, um, supporting guys.
 Yeah.
 He's one of those guys.
  Now you go back and see him and like, you know, little character.
 It's like, it's like when you go  back and see Giamatti in smaller roles and you forget, like you didn't think this guy would be the  main star of movies.
 Uh, at some point in time, if you add up that he's the, he's in this Christmas  bad that will never go away.
 And he's farmed.
 He's the farmer's guy.
 Yes.
 I mean, I've, I wondered  this about, uh, somebody Seth MacFarlane in recent episodes is does J K Simmons have $1 billion?  Yes, at this point.
 And not, not for that reason, but I was going to ask you this, Mike, do you  consider J K Simmons an enemy because he's farmers and you are team Allstate from your, well, I'm  not, look, they, I'm not under, I'm not getting paid by Allstate anymore, so I'm open to the highest bidder.
  I'm willing to flip now, like the sprint guy, if they want, they should just re film the Allstate  commercial I was in for progressive.
 Let's do it.
 Let's stick it to Allstate for not keep continuing to  pay me free money.
 You turn the camera.
 It's me, the guy who the Tess Haysbert voiced the woman  right.
 Yeah.
 So now I'm here for progressive.
 It'll be just as big of a campaign.
 Cause that sprint guy is still going.
  They're still, they're doing that campaign.
 He is truly firmly the face of sprint.
 It's wild.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
  Um, so no, let's flip Mike.
 Let's flip any insurance company.
 Yeah.
 Geico's revisiting old ads.
 Why not  visiting revisit? Not their ads.
 Yeah.
 I agree.
 Uh, so no, I'm well, I'm willing to get on the farmer's team.
  Yeah.
 Yeah.
 He needs a sidekick and it's me.
 His bumbling, like, uh, your, your, your papers, sir.
 Yeah.
  And then he's always like tour, looking around a museum or something.
 Yes.
 And you like trip the floors too slick and you slip and fall.
 Yeah.
  You can be mean to me.
 That'll be funny.
 Yeah.
 Um, I wanted to go full whiplash on the other insurance company.
  Uh, so, uh, you wait in line.
 And one thing I will say, was it a little crowded for you for, for either of you? Well, I went to the first show of the day and we were the first ones in line where we're like, when does it? Oh, thank God.
 It starts in 10 minutes.
  Are you saying there was a crowded in the theater? Yeah.
 Uh, no.
 See, I've been, and my friend, Tyler and Keough just went the pats full room.
  And we'll do it with a full room too.
 Like there are times I think depending on when you go, again, maybe I've just, I'm just glass half full on this thing.
 Yeah.
 I've seen packed psyched audience psyched to be there.
 There were like six, seven people in with us.
  Maybe there was like 10 other people.
 I mean, there was a decent.
 I've done it with less, but I've definitely done it where they can't like people have to wait for the next show because there's so many in there.
  My memory is that there was a child screaming before we started.
  Yeah, that was the child screaming.
 Oh yes.
 I think there's always a child screaming.
  We were up fourth floor.
 That's I kept going, the smell is, oh my God, the smell is insane.
 And there's a child screaming.
 There's like a couple of people in line.
 People would, I feel like we, there were people wandered up and like they would explain to them what the, like this is a 4D movie and they'd go, oh, okay.
 And they turn around and didn't go in line.
  They want to bet down mad.
 You got to, if you went in Rome, you got to check it out.
 Hey, I agree.
 So you're, you get into the theater and realize this is more than a movie theater.
 This is a laboratory.
 You're at the M and M's Academy, not unlike the farmers.
  This is a place of education.
 This is like the X-Men's mansion, the Xavier school for gifted candy.
  Oh, so this is officially the M and M's Academy.
 The room that you're in is the M and M's Academy.
 I don't know if any of the rest of the store is the M and M's Academy.
 Right.
 And there's no pre-show to lead you in or a sign that tells you you're in the M and M's Academy.
  Yeah.
 And it's like, that's just in that space is where that reality exists.
 Cause I think it's right outside that they have this big like 3D sort of display of the M and M's in like suits.
 And it's like Las Vegas plastic.
 They're like the rat pack what you're showing.
  Yeah.
 So it doesn't, that's me.
 I went with them.
 It doesn't ease.
 It doesn't ease you into the narrative.
 No, not really.
 You just go in there and then pre-show.
 There's no world building.
 Yeah.
 So it's a shock that you end up at an Academy, which is a science lab primarily.
  And even when you walk in the room, you're not sure what you're looking at because there's like computer panels and flashing lights, especially this one little space on the side with kind of a, I don't know, it looks like a test tube or a big, big tube or door or something.
  And, you know, full big, bright light bulbs all the way around.
 And that's the space that your host steps into.
 And this is where I fell.
 This is mainly the movie I could take or leave as parts of it, the story or it smells, whatever.
  But I just fell in love with when it begins and at least, and then, you know, there's a range of who you could get as part of this experience.
 But when we saw it the first time, the most nonplussed teenager walks in in a lab coat and, and says, hello, welcome to my laboratory.
  I am the professor and seeing a teenager declare that they are the professor just made me so happy.
 And you could see videos where people are giving it a little more, but even giving it more is just so no one doing this looks like they would be called the professor.
  No, my professor seemed like he was about to cry.
 I was not sure if he was supposed to be.
 I was not sure.
 I saw he was wearing a lab coat, which he immediately ripped a pocket like the pocket.
  He went, no, it's my pocket.
 I hate that.
 It was like, what?  I think you might have gotten the best professor.
  Sounds like your professor was the best.
  But he wouldn't put the headset mic.
 He just had it like around his neck.
 So we couldn't really hear him that well.
  It's one of the headset mics can be rough in general.
 They could sometimes just be faintly attaching to the quietest speaker ever.
 And that's the case here.
 Yes.
 A professor in a headset mic.
 Do you have a recollection about your professor?  I do.
 He was fine.
 It wasn't anything.
 Neither here nor there.
 It was neither here nor there, which I think did color our viewing of it.
  Because it is fun that a guy in a lab coat comes in, but he wasn't like, he wasn't an Emmett Brown type.
 He wasn't like a 15 year old who couldn't deliver lines.
 So it was just like, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, hello, I'm the professor.
  The last time we went, I took a video and the guy really had it.
 The guy was really good.
 Aside from the age being wrong, he's probably like 22.
 It's just is not enough time for someone to be a become a professor unless you're a Dooney Howser type.
  Yeah, you need someone who looks like the guy who played Professor Keen Bean from the Richie Rich movie.
  Is that in one of those films that is Eugene Levy?  It's not in the first one.
  I believe in the straight to video Christmas wish.
  That's Eugene Levy.
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
 I forget the guy's name.
 You know what I'm talking about in the first in the Macaulay Culkin Richie Rich.
  Yeah, who is it in the, yeah, I don't recall.
 I don't know.
 But yes, he's got to be old.
 He's got to be stale.
 He's got to be stiff.
 But this guy, he's definitely good.
 And there's like clearly a range where they can do a bigger like, allow me to introduce myself.
  I am the professor.
 But the main dialogue, and I'd prefer to do it as the first one I saw.
 Yeah, please.
 You never forget your first professor.
 Hello, welcome to my laboratory.
 I am a professor.
  And I'm here to introduce my brand new invention.
 This is a truck.
 I look at M&Ms all over the world.
 It's been very like that's that theme park voice.
 That is like announcement theme park voice when the person doesn't have like a take on it.
  It's similar to I'm sure I've said this before the show before.
 But when I the maybe the only time I ever saw the movie Golden Dreams that was in the this.
  What is now location of Little Mermaid that a non plus teenager said, please gather our belongings, including your dreams and exit.
  There's a right of the theater didn't register as a joke or anything.
 Just said so dead inside.
  We got a custodial here.
 We got a dream clean up some of their dreams.
  Their dreams.
 Please build a specially.
  I'm not going to make it to Broadway.
 Not gonna make it to Broadway.
  A lot of dreams got spilled in that Chip and Dale Acorn Treehouse in Toontown.
  Our kids have some so many dreams in here.
  So, yes.
 So this is the premise that you are in the Academy.
  And there's an invention that it's called.
  Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, I give you the M&Ms 5000.
  The M&Ms 5000, which has the ability to locate any M&M.
  Right.
 Wherever it is in the world.
  So it is like X-Men.
 It's like Cerebro, which is Professor X computer that he uses to track all the mutants in the world.
  And he puts on that's what that's his helmet.
  You've ever seen Patrick Stewart with the helmet like thing he puts on that is Cerebro, which tracks all the mutants in the world.
  This is all.
 So there's a lot of X-Men.
  Yes, I believe.
 Yes, it feels like that.
  When did the first X-Men movie come out?  2000.
 Yes, we're ahead of I believe this experience opened in 1999.
  It opened in 99.
 It won a theater in.
  Yes, yes, it could.
  I mean, the Cerebro is all of the mythology has been around.
  This could be a comic.
 Yeah.
  And there's the animated series was on very well.
  It probably was.
  It could have been or not.
  So before that, you know, red and yellow are supposed to be here today, but I can't find them anywhere.
  So let's get started without them.
  So then they power up a machine and you're watching kind of like, you know, early, you know, rudimentary 3D animation showing you this lab and this big gets just generic sort of zips and zaps kind of machine.
  Once they tap into it, there's a big scan of the world and we're going to find red and yellow and get them in here because that's who you're there to see.
  Of course.
  Red and yellow and it happens to track them to elsewhere in Las Vegas at, you know, that a generic casino, the Casino Generico.
  It's unlabeled.
  I've been blown up by this point.
  Yes, it's been long, long since demolished.
  Exploded.
  And they are at a roulette table.
  Yeah, yeah, it's a roulette table.
  They're placing bets that you get a shot and I forgot this to last time I went.
  You get a shot of the dealer.
  The dealer is played by an actor named Dave Rubrick, who is the host of Supermarket Sweep.
  Yes, we squealed with delight.
  Yeah, yes, we were very, that was maybe the highlight of the whole thing.
  Yeah, I'm glad you're equally fond of Dave Rubrick.
  Yes, he's like he's not as human as Regis, but he's still got his charm.
  You know what I mean? Is that right?  The kind of yeah, Regis type.
  He's like sort of an inoffensive host kind of guy.
  There's like nothing going on there, but that's I don't mean that as an insult.
  No, I don't mean it as an insult.
  Pleasant.
  Yeah, I could not tell you any characteristics of him.
  Nice.
 Good.
  He seems nice and I like him.
  Yes, but he's good likeable.
  Yeah, but he doesn't have any personality.
  Really?  But I mean more personality than some of these actors may be playing the professor.
  I guess, yeah.
  I guess I take that back.
 There's personality there.
  I'm very fond of Dave Rubrick.
 I'd love to have Dave Rubrick on the show.
  You know, also might be fun to talk to who is the writer of this film.
  Do you know who wrote this film?  Yeah, I did.
 That was what surprised me.
  Yes, a person not that far, a person, a fairly reachable person.
  Care to fill us in?  Yeah, David Cobb, whose current title is principal of creative development at the Thinkwell Group,  who we've mentioned on the show before.
  He's on Twitter, very active theme park Twitter person.
  Yeah.
  Who I was looking up other credits, wrote the Borg invasion at the Star Trek experience elsewhere in Vegas.
  Got a Thea for that.
  Wow, yes, multi Thea winner, David C.
 Cobb, wrote the pre-show for T2 3D,  which if that means the thing where Shaq gets the free throw and the claw and the doctor performing the surgery on the beach,  that's amazing.
 If he wrote that, oh my God, just that and it's a legend.
  And the short in Men in Black Alien Attack.
  The Goofus and Gallant sort of thing.
  Right.
  Yeah, that's a hell of a filmography.
  So he was working on Warner Brothers Dubai.
  Yes, Warner Brothers.
  Okay, okay.
  Also got a Thea for Caesar's Magical Empire, which I think was the show.
  Fountain show.
  I think it's the fountain show, which I don't know, is that still running?  Because I walked by it and I couldn't tell.
  Don't do as much as they used to.
  The statues come to life, but I think there used to be a more involved show and maybe even like then you went into a room and there was a bigger 40 adventure.
  I believe.
  So God, this guy was the king of Vegas themed entertainment, now the king of Dubai themed entertainment.
  We have to talk to this man.
  Let's try to talk to this man.
  So the M&M's 5000 turns on, they find Dave Rubrecht.
  Red is trying, Red's up, I think, and they're ignoring their responsibilities back at the lab.
  They're not saying hello to us, which they should be.
  Red's getting greedy.
  They're being like kind of lascivious, like they're a little bit like, they're a little rowdier than they are on the commercials.
  Also a little more textured.
  Yeah.
  Footage.
  I think the texture looks nice.
  The film quality, it's like rich film.
  It's clearly film.
  Definitely film.
  And I have some thoughts on that, but I'll keep describing the plot.
  I can explain why it was so good.
  OK, OK.
  But the yeah, they are pretty jerky.
  I was realizing, like, if I try if I try to talk like him, what's that line from there?  Like, I don't know.
  I never met that guy.
  Right.
  It's just going to be we Chuck and Leno and the Blue 32.
  That's that's that book voice.
  But he is pretty sleazy because he's like gambling instead of working.
  And then this is the height of his sleaziness.
  This is like putting your baby on the table.
  This is like a precious watch your grandfather gave you.
  You gamble with that.
  He takes his only belonging.
  I imagine if you're the writer of this, if you're David Cobb, you're like, what do I have nothing to what do the M&Ms have that I could draw from?  Well, there's one thing on their body and it is the M.
  So he peels off his M and puts it on red.
  Put it on red.
  And they spin the wheel and it is black.
  And and he loses his M.
  His M is cruelly, callously shoved into that little slot where all the money goes.
  Yeah, it's kind of upsetting.
  It's like taking your nose off your face and putting it on the table or something.
  Like it feels like a part of him.
  Like, yeah, it's not just a shirt.
  He's like, yeah, I got to get that back.
  He never seems too driven to get it.
  Yellow seems more concerned about getting it back.
  Like he knows the rules of being an M&M better than red does.
  Right.
 Yeah.
  That's your soul.
  You can't go more than 30 minutes without that.
  God won't be able to find you.
  He'll disappear like back to the future.
  You've forgotten.
  So then the entire time the professor is protesting all this and like, no, red, what are you doing?  No, I shouldn't be doing that.
  And then beams them to the lab, beams them in the lab.
  Now they're upset.
  They're in an addled state.
  And then we got to get that M back.
  So they has this work.
  Oh, I think the professor says you look like a skittle and then says, I'm out of here.
  You guys figure it out.
  The rest of it, you're just watching a movie.
  There's like wind in the theater.
  There's some effects like that.
  Yeah, that's pretty fun.
  It is fun.
  It does feel like 40 right there.
  They just turn the air on like real powerfully.
  Pretty much.
  I mean, it's still good.
  I know.
  Get me wrong.
  Why the chocolate smell won't leave is that all the ventilation in the building goes straight to the right.
  Right.
  The Academy is sucking up all that.
  Literally sucking it up.
  And then so then I get Aaron and I were talking about this how, you know, an alcohol might factor into this.
  But we're saying every time we've sat down to do this, we don't remember what happens.
  We're very fond of it.
  But yet we're surprised by Dave Ruprecht every time we do not remember that it becomes about going to the Department of Lost and Found.
  Oh, I can't get this out of my mind.
  This night.
  This I meant to look up.
  Yeah, because then they go.
  Then they go.
  Then they're kind of they sucked out again.
  Yes, I get fuzzy on wire.
  Yeah, they go to like a limbo ask hell.
  It reminds me honestly of like the Minion Mayhem ride at Universal in a little way, not aesthetically, but in the same like there's stuff happening and they have to like dodge it.
  And it's all coming at you so fast and furious.
  You don't know what.
  Yeah, I probably couldn't tell you what happens in Minion Mayhem.
  Well, you go through Gru's secret.
  I know that because they have to know the broad strokes of it.
  It's a part gun, but it smells like man.
  And I know you bump into them at one point and they all become a big minion thing at once.
  Yeah, which actually kind of happens here.
  Similarly, is there is a similar thing to that?  Similar thing in this.
  Oh, yeah.
  So that's why there's a yeah, there's a few similar beats.
  So we're at the we're at the Department of Lost and Found.
  Lost and Found.
  That's where he has to go to find his M and it's like a scary guy.
  This feels like a very 70s movie.
  Chitty Chitty Bang Bang kind of thing where a guy in big glasses and he's very judgmental and a lot of doors that lead to different lost things.
  And he says that he asks, what do you need?  It's an M like, well, that's not animal, vegetable or mineral.
  That's not classifiable.
  So where so that means that it has to go to the scariest place of all.
  Lost causes.
  Big, gratingly loud scream.
  They make a runner of playing this so many times.
  So many.
 And it's yellow.
  It's yellow screaming.
  But it's also extremely like sound effect.
  Like I think that's I recognize it from sound effects library.
  It is like a will.
  Is it the will?  It's not.
  No, but it's like a famous.
  It feels more like a woman's streak.
  OK.
  Yeah.
 Which I believe is supposed to be the running joke.
  It's like yellow.
  He has a very good voice.
  But then.
  Yeah.
  Really.
  I don't want to blow out the mics that they put a lot of if I have a criticism,  it's a big if I think they lean on the scream.
  They lean on the screen and it's very loud.
  It's very, very loud.
  Then they had to walk through the hallways from like the crazy bureaucracy from Brazil.
  Like you're in the Brazil building.
  There's like some good set pieces in this.
  That is what is impressive about it.
  The sock bar, the horrifying socks.
  Well, that's where we go.
  We're looking at different.
  There's different rooms, lost sheep, lost boys, lost time, lost sleep.
  And then we end up at the lost sock lounge.
  Right.
  Where all the single socks that came out of the dryer go and they're single and ready to mingle.
  Yes.
  They're all really thirsty.
  Thirsty socks.
  Yeah.
  Yep.
  And that's where we end up with a love interest for yellow.
  A yellow sock.
  Jason seems like you're pretty fond of this component.
  I was just where these CGI were the stop motion.
  I was trying to figure out.
  I find that a little interesting.
  Yeah.
  You can't quite tell what's going on.
  This is an interesting 40 movie.
  The movie looks better than most movies in the last 10 years.
  I feel like.
  Yeah.
  It's like a good CGI and film.
  Yeah.
  It is like a much more distinct style than most mainstream movies.
  And with that, we as Brazil and Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.
  It is right.
  Yeah.
  There's like something like visually and setting wise going on.
  There's like a vibe, like stuff.
  Mainstream movies are missing.
  Oftentimes like a vibe or like it's like a specific.
  I'm glad I totally agree.
  There is a distinct vibe of I lost my M&M's.
  Yes.
  You know, the kinds of the visual language.
  Yeah.
  Yes, for sure.
  Hell yeah.
  Did did Roger Deakins?  Is he the DP on this?  Do we know?  Well, I can tell you that I'll tell you about the DP.
  It's a pretty impressive DP.
  The guy's name is Isadore Manak Mancovsky.
  And he has one of the strangest DP filmographies I've ever heard.
  The Muppet movie.
  The original Muppet movie.
  So that yeah, it's the guy who shot that jazz singer.
  The Neil Diamond version.
  Oh wow.
  70s was this guy.
  He shot the TV movie Ewoks, the Battle for Endor.
  Yeah.
  Uh huh.
  He is a Star Wars guy.
  Wow.
  In that respect.
  Better Off Dead.
  He shot the Harry Anderson absent minded professor for the magical world of Disney.
  Wow.
  He shot a movie called Skin Deep with John Ritter that I'm very fond of.
  I've never seen it.
  It's a I really like it.
  A little kind of hidden gem.
  Blake Edwards, I believe.
  And the movie She Cried No, a TV movie of the week where Candace Cameron is being harassed  by Mark Paul Gosselaar.
  Wow.
  That's like a top tier good lifetime movie.
  Like really watchable.
  Watching him play Dark is really interesting.
  Right.
  So crazy lineup.
  But also I think the reason he's part of this, he was not the credited DP, but a he lent  3D expertise or I guess mainly more Muppet expertise to Muppet Vision 3D.
  They got a very light like they got you shot.
  It was a 3D expert and then he has done Muppets before.
  So they kind of worked in tandem to shoot Muppet Vision 3D.
  Wow.
  He actually and I know all this because there was a book about I just in Googling his name  discovered a book about 3D filmmaking where it seems like the interviewer wants to keep  it on track to I Lost My M in Vegas, much like me with the episode.
  He's like, let's go back to the Vegas movie though.
  And it seems like he does not really want to talk about it.
  The interviewer had probably had a beer at Fatburger before.
  It has to be that.
  What's he in the mood for?  Which I didn't remember.
  This is the very first thing I did in Vegas.
  The next day we went.
  We realized we were across the street from the Taco Bell Cantina.
  Oh, I didn't realize that.
  That was fun.
  It was I mean, it was pretty empty all the week.
  So that was like, oh, now you're saying this.
  I'm like, oh, we should have gone there on that.
  Then go.
  I did last time I went straight Italy to that.
  That's like ups and downs of the street for sure.
  I eat nice food and then this fun, stupid thing.
  There was a funny story about shooting the first Muppet movie where they have to build all the sets up really high because of the puppeteers.
  And then they have to put actors up on these elevated risers.
  But don't forget that the Muppet movie ends with an appearance from Orson Welles.
  Yeah.
  And thus they had to super reinforce that said if they were worried he was going to fall through it.
  I know this should have been on our fries episode, but I'm remembering now the manager told me of fries that Marlon Brando, speaking of actors of size, Marlon Brando was in the Burbank fries and they had to shut it down.
  What?  So you could walk around.
  They privately closed down.
  That's what she told me.
  Because he wanted to look at the monsters and everything.
  I can't believe I forgot to say that.
  But we've got to figure out if we can find.
  I just remembered it now.
  And that thing is like motorcycle dude.
  It's like young Brando.
  Yeah.
  Oh my God.
  We got to figure that out.
  Thank you for.
  I totally forgot that you're springing this on me.
  Yeah.
  This is delightful.
  This DP also has some bones to pick with Frank Oz because he picked up shooting after Muppet Vision 3D.
  Right.
  Yeah.
  Henson died.
  And Henson was very specific about it.
  It's going to be long shots, continuous shots like the lab.
  Right.
  And he also commented on that big deep.
  And this guy was like then Oz came in and shot everything close.
  He just like threw this guy who just passed visions at vision out the window.
  Wow.
  So he's a little mad at Frank Oz.
  Interesting.
  Changing Henson's plan.
  Interesting.
  I'll come back around to this guy a little bit, but we'll keep moving through this movie.
  But that tells you a really good DP.
  Excellent DP.
  So a sexy yellow sock is hitting on Yela with all that expertise.
  Then he films a sexy yellow sock.
  This is fairly disturbing because she gets really flirty.
  Yeah.
  He has a just full on love interest.
  And then Red's like, hey, come on, lover boy.
  But it's all her.
  She is just.
  She's pursuing.
  It doesn't pay off though.
  No.
  They don't end up together.
  You don't watch them do anything, which would it just consist of him climbing into the sock?  What happens in the lost sock?  Var stays in the lost sock.
  I would like to say my favorite quote of this thing is the way where they reveal that like,  we're not socks.
  We're colored candy.
  And then there's a record scratch and it gets very quiet.
  And then his socks scarily stares straight down the barrel of the camera and says, you're  not socks.
  I like that very much.
  She her name is Bobby, by the way.
  Okay.
  Bobby socks.
  She shows him the way to an elevator.
  They.
  I'm lost here now.
  I'm lost in this lost movie.
  They have to go to the sock bar to find out where the M would be.
  Yeah.
  This all is very confusing.
  Yeah.
  Yeah.
  It gets a little fuzzy from here.
  And then they, they kind of self reflexively, they kind of know that there's just the beats  that they have to hit because they go up and see a big scary furnace thing, which they  call a big scary furnace thing.
  It's like an alive monster that's chomping.
  Right.
  It feels very well.
  This is where it would end.
  Right.
  It's like a big scary furnace.
  Yeah.
  It's like Toy Story three.
  Of course.
  Much later.
  The M's on a conveyor belt.
  That's when you discover that they have a, they were given a device earlier that makes  time stands still.
  So they're, they're clock stoppers also.
  Yeah.
  The M's are clock stoppers.
  The M's are clock stoppers.
  So that's helpful.
  But they also have another weapon up their sleeve.
  A weapon of mini destruction.
  It's time for the secret weapon.
  The minis and they fly out towards camera and this is wonderful product placement and  new products at the time.
  At the time.
  Still around.
  I mean, they're still around, but I remember them pushing it a lot.
  Yeah.
  Yeah.
  Late nineties.
  Minis are at the top of their game.
  I like the minis.
  Yeah.
  I think they're delicious.
  You like them as characters?  They're more like a swarm or a hive, kind of a collective entity.
  There's no individuals.
  Yeah.
  Yeah.
  It's like the fish in Finding Nemo make the shapes.
  You're right.
  The minions do it at some point.
  They're so small, they're able to form like, they all together form like a helicopter and  that helps red fly around.
  They form a bugle like to do it.
  And they, I don't know, then they get the M back.
  What happens?  He gets it back and he seems indifferent.
  He never cared.
  There's one shot where I especially like, where I think the animation is good and the  texture of the M is also good flapping around.
  Yellow is sacrificing himself.
  He stretched out on top of a pipe and he's blowing the M to try to stop it from falling  into the furnace.
  Yeah.
  Yeah.
  That's not his M.
  Yeah.
  Yeah.
  I forget.
  Do they actually set something up in it that like he's going to die if he doesn't have  the M?  Not really.
  It's just like he's like lost a shirt.
  Yeah.
  Yeah.
  He lost a shirt that didn't even care about that much.
  And do M's, can you repaint one?  Can you have a fake one installed like it's a tooth?  Yeah, right.
  Or do you, can you grow one?  Like will it eventually retire?  He just like grits his teeth.
  Will he grow one?  But maybe it's more like a finger and you don't regrow it.
  But then, I don't know, get a prosthetic.
  I mean, that's, that's complicated to do with a finger, but you would have to think with  an M.
  A prosthetic M.
  That shouldn't be.
  It's not very fake in and of itself.
  Well, you would think they were in the academy and the professor has to have a solution to  this.
  There's got to be some kind of stem cell.
  Yes.
  Yes.
  Can we, are we able to grow like beyond meat?  Can we regrow M's artificially in a lab?  Whatever that clinic that, Swedish clinic that Quincy Jones goes to that he talked about  in the interview where he said they were going to keep him alive till 120.
  The go to that, like that version of the M&M, like a clinic for M&M's in Sweden.
  In theory though.
  Well, but is it on American soil?  That's the problem because medicine isn't approved as fast in America.
  Oh.
  Because that's why you have to go like to Brazil for certain procedures or if you want  to get your stem cell injection or Mex, yeah, wherever.
  Sweden, all these places, they have a little bit more advanced technology than we do.
  But Q should fill him in because he's friends with the M's.
  I mean, he knows all the major players in the world.
  He's like good friends with the Obamas.
  Yeah.
  So any, yeah, you know he parties with the M's.
  Of course.
  Yeah.
  So yeah, there's got to be something.
  Yeah.
  Help him out Q.
  Come on Q.
  So then we, yeah, we end, yeah, you're right.
  We end up back, we did it, M doesn't really care.
  And then we're back in the lab where we started.
  The professor comes back in.
  All right.
  Wait, let me take it down.
  All right.
  What's all this noise in my lab?  What have you guys been doing?  They say they found the M.
 That's good Red, but how'd you do that?  We just hit a few buttons.
  And then they do hit buttons again to demonstrate how they turn the machine on to go have their  adventure.
  They hit the wrong button.
  The wind machine starts blowing again.
  And then there's a pretty fun gag, not unlike the special effects stage that we talked about  where there's like a little blackout thing.
  The professor flies through a big flash of light.
  Professor flies through a door disappears.
  They like obliterated the professor.
  Oh, professor dies at the end of the show or there or he's just like he or she is just  like in a limbo state.
  See our professor, I have to give him credit because that flash happened and he was gone  and then the exit doors opened and he was there.
  Cool.
  So I think maybe that's, that's where he puts his panache.
  He just runs around real fast.
  Good for him.
  I like that.
  I watched a video on YouTube and at the start, a walk around red, the professor was like,  get out of here, red.
  We got to start the presentation.
  There was a walk around red in the lab and he walks out.
  What?  Then the professor goes into like, all right, well, I can find any M&M in the world.
  Let's find red and yellow.
  In that presentation, that the implication to me is that red walks out of the lab and  then immediately hits the tables.
  He just like slides down a chute, straight in the MGM grand floor.
  Human size, human size.
  Well, big size.
  Yeah.
  Wow.
  You know what they do say?  Should we look for the professor right after we hit the buffet?  So again, he doesn't care.
  He's so self centered, but that implies that the professor doesn't die.
  Yeah, that's true.
  You're right.
  You're right.
  The professor might, they might have like, they have a device to locate any academic  in the world.
  I remember though, when he went, when he disappeared, I remember when they, they, they kill him  off.
  They killed the professor off.
  It's questionable enough that I think a sequel is required and demanded.
  Well, it's certainly, it certainly should be.
  We should have David out and see if there, he can talk to the right people.
  Yeah, boy, if we could talk to him.
  Crispy.
  I mean, you can have crispy in there.
  You can have caramel in there.
  They've had it so many.
  And I think this is, I think like the female care, I think like brown is, is green.
  Is green is a female.
  Green and brown.
  Well, yeah.
  Well, why are we only dealing with the two?  It's time to flush out the ranks.
  Let's get everybody else in there.
  Right.
  I mean, this is green, green, green is on.
  They've, they're in the store.
  They're in the store.
  They're represented there, but they're just not in the film.
  Right.
  And if, if they're going to plus this up or refresh it, they might need to do some things  to be more to the liking of DP Isadore Mankowski.
  Of course.
  Because again, in this interview, that's all the interviewer wants to talk about.
  Tell me about the M&M's film.
  Well, that film, all together, well, that film is not very impressive, frankly.
  It was shot with stereo vision and I didn't particularly care for the quality or the,  of the lenses or the system.
  So he's not happy with it.
  It's not high on it.
  He says, I won't give that voice through this whole quote.
  He says, I didn't see the finished film until a number of years after it was completed.
  I went to Vegas to see it.
  When I went to see the M&M's film, I was absolutely horrified because if a 3d film isn't projected  properly, it's a waste of time.
  I went in there and got a headache right away because the images were out of focus.
  I won't disagree with that.
  I had a bit of a headache while watching it as well.
  That's not a credit you would give it.
  That's not, I like the, the spirit of the movie and the spirit of the professor, but  it's not the best circumstances to watch it.
  Not the, yeah, highest optimum viewing.
  It was just complete chaos as far as projection is concerned.
  I went out and talked to the manager of the theater.
  Beyond the fact that I had shot it, I was concerned.
  I told him about the fact that it was being projected atrociously and it had to be lined  up again and the audience would not get the full benefit of the production.
  He apologized and said he would attend to it.
  I don't know if he did that or if the film is even still being shown.
  The interviewer says, I believe it still shows.
  A friend of mine who went a little while back told me they didn't even take the house lights  down.
  Oh no.
  Poor as a door.
  What a bummer.
  I can only imagine as a DP how much there, and that's something you're, you know, they  aren't still showing the Muppet movie every day.
  Right.
  Or the jazz singer every day.
  This is his only chance to have something playing forever and they're, they're fucking  it up.
  You know, get, get it a little, I say give all the professors a little bump, give them  a little bump in pay and give them like, Hey guys, let's just run this.
  Let's you know, give them, give them a little, uh, you know, help to be the best professors  they can because they clearly have invested in the store.
  I mean, you can get any and every color or variety of M and M merchandise.
  Like it is very thorough.
  But the professor is the ambassador of the academy.
  Yeah.
  And you walk out of there thinking about your professor and uh, yeah, they have to be, they  gotta notch up their performance.
  Let's get the guy who played keen bean.
  That's all I'm saying.
  Let's just get him in there.
  Mike McShane.
  Very interesting.
  Was also in the Tower of Terror movie.
  He's a character actor.
  He's a Who's Line is Anywhere guy.
  Yes.
  And originally, yeah.
  And the British.
  Yeah.
  But if that were to happen, I do think that I'd miss the general tenor of the current  professor who has that up and down Theotra Wellkiddens and that wanting to go through  it as quickly as he possibly can.
  Could you do all of our now announcements like that?  I would I would love to if that's what we're doing.
  All right.
  You survived.
  Thank you so much for listening.
  We'll be back with more of this very soon.
  Be sure to check us out on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and for more subscribe to the second  gay pockets.
  Slash or pitch on dot com slash pockets.
  Right.
  Thanks.
  Thanks so much for being here and have a podcast for a day.
  There is something so comforting, honestly, about that rhythm from doing all these experiences  over our lives.
  Yeah.
  It feels very nice to do.
  I feel relaxed.
  Yeah.
  And I don't have to put that much energy into it.
  No, not having to enunciate.
  I feel like I have a particularly I try to enunciate when I speak and I end up feeling  exhausted.
  Why?  Maybe from now on and all the rest of the episode, should I just take it down?  No, not worry about hitting those T's and F's.
  Just kind of try to breeze through those words as smoothly as I can.
  One whole episode just to try that whole.
  Arbitrary.
  It's not about this or anything else.
  No, no, no, of course not.
  Yeah.
  Similarly, that was one of the reasons I think it took me a second.
  Then I realized that Park MGM is painted inadvertently.
  The color they have chosen for a lot of it is similar to Disney's Go Away Green that  they paint on things that they want you to just pleasantly fade into the scenery, into  the background.
  What if the plot of the next one is that green ends up in a place with a lot of go away green  and they can't find her.
  It overpowers the machine.
  That's good.
  Yeah.
  And she ends up feeling bad about herself.
  Like, why do I have the color that everyone wants to go away?  Yeah.
  I mean, look, we're going to make this equal to this.
  We'll just get it then.
  We will hire Isadore and we'll make sure to shot to his liking on the perfect old film,  not on this stereo vision that fucked him over.
  So right.
  Well, thanks.
  Thanks for listening.
  Jason, glad you had a good time.
  Glad you're part of the Blue 32 family now.
  I love it.
  Can't wait to go back.
  And thanks for watching this film that I care about deeply.
  Next time, do it with one fat burger beer.
  One fat burger beer, a good night's sleep.
  In fact, that's what Isadore should have done too.
  He would have been given a shit about the alignment.
  So Isadore, grab a beer.
  See you next time.
  Bye.
