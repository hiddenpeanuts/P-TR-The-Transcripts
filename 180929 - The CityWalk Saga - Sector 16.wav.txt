  Dog!  When your town has let you down  When your porch has fallen short  When you're too worn out to run  And need some ribs or a Cinnabon  You need a place, a place for rock  A place for roll, a place where Oakland Raiders merch is sold  A sublime hot topic and billabong  A place where you can purchase a candy thong  So let's go take a walk  Let's all go to City Walk  Tonight, tonight  Boys, boys, you give me strength!  You give me strength!  We're almost to the end, and we're pretty excited about this one.
  So yeah, tell us where we're going today.
  Yes, boys, today's sector is sector 16.
  Subway, Panda Express, Smash Burger, Poke Bar, Taco Bell, Pink's, KFC Express, Pizza Hut.
  It's a food court.
  Yeah, well, that's what's interesting.
  This thing was added, I think, in around 2000, they added this area called City Food,  which there wasn't really a lot of quick service options.
  Yeah, and City Loft would be considered part of the food court area.
  Or are you, sorry, sector, you're not?  Yeah, you keep going, keep going.
  Are you sure? You seem like disinterested.
  Yeah, you know, it's a food court, so you guys get it, right?  Yeah, I mean, it's like the Taco Bell stuff.
  I mean, I could talk, though, about like, there's slight differences between like this Taco Bell  and the one I, for instance, that's in Burbank here that I go to.
  And I did a lot, I looked up a lot about Pink's.
  I have a story about where I got into like a car accident at the other, the Pink's off of Melrose.
  We have like pages of material.
  Sure, I have a very funny picture for the Smash Burger.
  Hey, boys, here's the stone.
  Sector 16 stone is, I don't know, like a napkin or something.
  Oh, we just get the stone already?  Yeah, you get the stone.
 No one wants to really hear about this.
  Like, this is, you give me strength.
  Sure, I think the audience would be thrilled to hear about it.
  No, you give me strength, you give me strength.
  OK, yeah, we give you strength.
  All right, so that's it.
 So we just skip the sector?  Yeah, you skip the sector.
  I don't think we skipped it, we talked about it.
  Oh yeah, it's a Taco Bell.
 Yeah, I mean, you're right, it is a food court.
  You got it.
