 Five, four, three, two, one.
  podcast arrived, the second gate, the fancy upper class rich person edition  right behind that sweet paywall.
 My name is Mike Carlson as always joining me  Jason Sheridan.
 Hi Scott Gardner.
 Hey yeah if you if you're listening to this then I  assume that you have paid your $25,000 episode admittance fee and that in order  to continue listening to it you will pay your $10,000 yearly episode renewal fee.
  And if you haven't paid those things and there has clearly been a lapse in the  patreon system if you only paid a some $5 monthly then there's a big we're  missing out on a lot of funds.
 Someone had mentioned because about the patreon that  we should have like a club 33 like there should be some insane like $5,000  membership for some other specific like I don't know what it would be like being  sitting here watching us do this live that doesn't sound pleasant.
 I thought  the joke was that it was $33.
 I saw a different one I saw that too I saw a  different one though.
 Oh I saw another one person mentioned like an actual  tier I think.
 If we can think of a decent enough tier to yeah 33 is like cap it  because it's supposedly club 33 is like 500 members is that right? That's a  number I kept seeing pop up but there's it's not clear.
 There's a lot of like  numbers that aren't clear about club 33.
 I think it gets dicey once you incorporate  corporate membership.
 Right because some of the memberships.
 Yeah companies they  could be counting it as one they could be counting yeah.
 I think I think $33 a  month maybe gets you exclusive China sets each month delivered to your home  with the podcast the ride logo.
 Super fan so we have to find a China manufacturer  once we do.
 Okay that's good.
 We got a great perk.
 You get a new plate every  month and the longer you subscribe the more you end up with a full 30-piece set.
  Yeah that's a good look that's a great idea if we can find a cheap China  manufacturer.
 Don't tell them it's cheap no it's the finest quality real  gold leaf slated into the plates.
 Well we'll work on that is what we're saying  but thank you by the way this is the first one recording patreon where we've  seen the people actually are interested in the patreon.
 Yeah.
 And they like to thank you  It's super encouraging and it makes us very excited to do more stuff.
 Yeah we're having fun  patreon ideas all the time and I especially love that right away people  were commenting you got to do this you need to do one and so again this is this  is for y'all tell us what you want us to do and what we're very happy to get the  prompts and you know the more obscure the better over here you know.
 Yes.
  We're unfettered by people who you know we don't have to go back and explain what all the  stuff is we can just dive straight into yeah I don't want to ruin any surprises  I guess but we were talking about a well who is the character the in the in the  factory that you go oh yeah so so yeah we don't want to we will tease a little  bit of an episode that will be coming in the next couple months probably but  there's a character if you know it his name and he's a character I think he's a  real man as well but his name is Papa Steve and even just leave it at that  like will you write us and tell us if you know what Papa Steve is I didn't but  you guys have a long history with Papa Steve yeah I have multiple I'll just say  this I have multiple photos of Jason through the years I think at least two I  got to go back to the archives of Jason and a picture of Papa Steve and well  yeah let's just leave it at that I mean you guys are theme park nerds and  weirdos so you figure out who Papa Steve is fan favorite maybe that's what  deep-cut fan favorite yeah and that's what paid the patreon's all about yeah  I think maybe maybe what if it's that someone has to either email us or  comment on the patreon or tweet it as who Papa Steve is and that will unlock  the episode oh yeah then we'll have to do it like pretty quickly but somebody  has to name it yeah yeah yeah that's good I like that but otherwise maybe we  should just do it get it in the can but maybe it never comes out unless people  solve the mystery of Papa Steve sure I bet it doesn't take much well I don't  know it's a this is a good little theme for the audience to play I do think Papa  Steve is on the higher end of obscure Disney character although that's a too  much of a hint actually okay I said Disney but I think he's I think we'll  see we'll see I will I will will be surprised yeah  a licensed character there is not a park star of Papa Steve there's no vinyl  nation of Papa Steve as far as I know no t-shirts available yet no merch we  popularized Papa Steve with our audience and we and we profit off of his likeness  yeah the Papa Steve merch will roll we'll get a lawsuit from his estate  there's a state if you're dead yes okay sorry I don't know cuz I frankly well  I'll save it I'll save it for the episode but uh yeah when we sell Papa  Steve t-shirts and then the bootleg knockoff puff puff sativa shirts which  is just the Papa Steve shirt and he's got a little joy this map so everything  we talk about we're going to sell pot themed version like Bart Simpson kicking  Saddam's ass not sure if and I would have you Google Papa Steve the first  thing that comes up is Papa Steve's no junk raw protein bars and it's a guy  named Steve Dybald this is not Papa Steve we're talking about that's a good  hint that's a good narrow down right I'm really excited I'm glad we gave the  audience a little mission here and I'm excited to see if it's fruitful and also  Papa Steve 100% sure on Steve right oh yeah it's in the photo okay as long as  it's in the photo there's for some reason I got in my head Papa Mark but I  it's just a pizza place in Pennsylvania my family goes to sometimes no I mean I  I'm gonna look right at the photo here I sent it yesterday there's a picture of  you looking longingly at this photo and it says Papa Steve at the bottom okay  very good so confirmed Papa Steve but please send us when you discover Papa  Steve is and that will unlock the episode yep I'll give it hints Papa Steve is  from an active attraction it is not a dead attraction oh so you can find okay  yeah that's good oh that'd be the best way to unlock it send us a photo of you  and Papa Steve yes yeah huh interesting okay this is this is great well I think  you're gonna start I also think somebody's gonna get this immediately  yeah I think that's entirely likely yeah yeah also we have not when we say unlock  we don't mean in the patreon sense we have not recorded that episode yet just  general scheme of it'll force our hand there's a lot of terms yeah on that  website that we're still learning so look at this we're still to work we're  sending in on on the exclusive scavenger hunts this is a per this is a premium  experience already and which which is fitting with today's topic which is the  ultimate Disney Disneyland premium experience that we got to experience for  ourselves will this be a braggy episode potentially and I apologize to the  audience if it verges on that however you've been listening to us presumably  for a little while I hope that you're that you're happy for us that we got to  enter the promised land of of Club 33 so how do we and we'll talk a little bit  about you know Club 33 in general in the history of it and everything but let's  I guess explain our experience I think we alluded to it in an episode but we got  to go thanks to our our new friends as of the who made who made our live show  possible Richard and Nicholas Kraft who ran the that's from Disneyland gallery  where we did our live show which hopefully you checked out and also we  were at we were it was very fun to be joined by Paul Scheer who also did a  and to say thanks Richard brought us into Club 33 and specifically into the  into the lounge where which is a newer area of the club called Le Salon Nouveau  Le Salon Nouveau so we had a we had a super fun lunch that went on and on and  on that dragged out we were there for so long it was such a delight and don't  I was gonna say dragged on seems like it might be like a bummer but no yeah wrong  drag good in a dragging in a good way yeah like leisurely a leisurely drag  drag from what I understand about Europe absolutely yeah yeah yeah so hey this was  this was a blast how do we handle this do we talk about the the place in  general and we talk about our experience or yeah I guess I mean it was very cool  in general we went to that we Jason I went down with Paul a little early we  rode the Ferris wheel which is the first time I ever rode the Ferris wheel  around yes and that'll be an episode pal around definitely a patreon episode and  yeah and then so say is pal around separate from yes wheel for sure  separate from fun wheel yeah that's two different episodes no way we could  possibly contain fun wheel and pal around yeah the mythology is all different  from pal around to fun wheel yeah I well on the other rounds I don't well I don't  want to give away to my but I had a perfectly lovely ride on it and once we  got off you were like I was I had a comfortable I had a little mild panic  attack as the first who was going up and it probably didn't help we were loaded  in with a another party I didn't realize I thought like oh Ferris wheel we were  we will get our own car oh yeah well they got to pack them in because the  thing is such a bad loading that helped because they took a nice picture of us  yeah that was nice I where is that photo send that to me I haven't seen it Scott  hasn't seen anyway but so we went on a couple rides and then we met up with  Scott and it was a very crowded it was Columbus when it was Columbus yeah and  that was nightmarish around there like getting me getting into the park and  to like inside New Orleans Square which is where Club 33 is and I made a joke  loudly that we have ten minutes hopefully I don't think we're gonna make  it which is crazy if you know how close that is to each other but the crowd was  so bad and the crowds like the lines were being rerouted through pirates that  like we almost didn't make it it was just an insanely crowded day away yeah it  was so awful yeah which just really let us I think savor in writing in this  private calm location on an incredibly stressful day yeah that's I was gonna say this is why I  bring that up is because the park was so crowded and I remember I think I said it  to you or something my understanding always was that this place was sort of  packed every day that there was full of people dining and eating and the  Club 33 is you know the waiting list goes on for decades right and you know  you know maybe if you're lucky your child will get to go in after you're  dead or like it's so like the terms are so stacked but then but and yet we're in  there and had place to ourselves yeah basically it was wild so yes we made it  there just right on time and Club 33 used to be closer to where the Blue Bayou  was which is the Pirates restaurant.
  Yeah the restaurant that's in the launch point essentially of Pirates.
  Scott you've been there before you had been to that version of the entrance.
  I had yes so that's yeah Mike and Jason had not not been to Club 33 I got to go  thanks to my friend David we had a blast there good like you know five years ago  and yes we had been we'd been into that entrance which had a like private little  elevator yes French lift yes okay and it was like a which we in looking up the  history of this was something that Walt found somewhere and tried to buy it  from the building and they said that's impossible to remove it nor are we  interested in removing our elevator no matter the cost.
  We also need the elevator.
  Yeah yeah it's extremely functional so so he just so he like took photos and had  imagineers just build one to his specifications and it's yeah that's like  that's that was that was an incredible little experience to have going up that  thing and really takes you into the past but that is no longer there that is one  of the changes and this is a whole you know I think Club 33 was a certain  certain way in a certain amount of space until like 2014 2015 and then it's been  pretty drastically not drastically but expanded an amount of yeah mostly  expansion mostly a good thing mostly allows more space and more more room  more empty space where no one is yeah.
  But also controversial because they they took over the  which is this is like very peaceful manicured courtyard like New Orleans kind  of courtyard that for many years anyone could just go back there and take  pictures there's tons of photos online of people's engagement photos or  proposal like in the Court of Angels and I used to love going back there and  getting pictures and showing it to people because it is an interesting like  this doesn't exist anywhere else like this is only in Disneyland it it's not  an attraction it's not a show it's not a restaurant it's just a cute little you  know bit of place making and now it's gone and only for the rich yeah it's  over and X sing yeah people are shocked that Disney has made moves for money  making purposes right it does like it does it does make sense though to have  a better more out of the way area to load this place though I mean  unfortunately I it is a bummer that it's gone you can't just walk into it  because it was nice it was one of those spots where it was like a little  peaceful it was very yeah it was like a couple and it's still peaceful like that  well sure and there's little there's a locked or infused water for you to wait  before you are back in oh my god the infused water was so good yeah it was a  wasn't iced tea but it was like infused with like  the time I lavender I believe yeah yeah did I say when we were drinking the  water that like the employees were looking at us like we were two hobos  that had wandered into like a rich person's restaurant I mean it did feel  that way and the sheer number of napkins that I got out of that place oh yeah my  got crumpled over there they're sitting on the sound bar we all do this  I think so yeah not cloth napkins by the way paper like nice paper like the  bathroom paper towels essentially well do you worth taking home do you wipe  like your hands on a special occasion with them they've all been free there  there in 12 frames napkins and 12 identical frames if you got liquid gold  on your hands and needed to clean that off maybe that's that's when you break  open the frames and start using the fancy yes yeah so you're staying with if  you have caviar all over your fingers right I'll say this then they were very  this makes it sound lawless but there were very few rules at Club 33 the only  thing they told us you can take photos anywhere you can walk into but not the  bathroom yeah doc take photos in the bathroom so that normal rule of society  right club 33 but I would have taken a photo in the bathroom very a very nice  ornate bathroom with Chuck Berry wouldn't like it there no photos that's  his favorite pastime it's a good point what in the bathroom we're talking  bathroom already I was shocked that they have little vials of mouthwash yeah I  got oh you took some I did not take Richard and I both mouthwash together at  the sink and then that was I was like I thought about it but I was like I'm not  gonna take a handful of there were glass too or were they plastic they were  plastic they were plastic okay if Richard had taught you how to shave that  would have been the experience he's dabbing your cheeks he wanted to see if  I was good at flossing he wanted to see yeah that would have been better it was  in there the Florida ceiling doors on the stalls as well right yes and pull  chain toilets like oh I cuz I didn't go into one of them I have the pull chain  had the where the the water tank is like closer to the ceiling and stuff oh  wow like I should go in the stall how did you not go in the toilet well I go I  went to the urinal and I didn't think you didn't need to use right I didn't  need but of course I should have explored all the every inch of it I went  a few times because not to be gross but hard liquor just goes right through me as  I've gotten older what do you really yeah quickly that's weird it's weird it  is weird you just hard liquor but not water yes really is there have you  googled this is this a real phenomenon like you okay no no yeah I mean as long  as that songs there's a bathroom close by which again the laws of society I  want you to leave places that serve hard liquor have a bathroom close by new  episode title Jason shits at club oh no other other other side okay oh yeah no  that would be more oh yeah that's what yeah I thought hard liquor makes you  makes you shit oh no I just have to you're an oh okay okay yeah oh yeah no  that would be very bad that would probably mean I had some sort of  allergic yeah all right some sort of that's what I was picturing the way that  coffee like could so yeah coffee yeah yeah yeah okay I thought just like a you  know yeah like some sips of rum yeah I really don't drink that much except on  your birthday it's all right and then you let it then you let her risk yeah  let's all wag our fingers the wound is healed thankfully okay so entrance area  that one yeah I guess we're trading out a cool thing for a less cool or for  another cool thing the elevator is not there but you get to walk in this this  Court of Angels area that's now annexed and that that is cool like boy yeah  wonderful entrance beautiful staircase and the elevator they turned into a  booth so you can sit in the elevator and eat your meal that that's in the lounge  I don't think it registered with me that that's oh I didn't realize that they  moved the little like the tiny little pull chain door the elevator into you  can like sit in there and it's right next to a little table really yeah but  like one person can barely squeeze in it'd be a very odd place to sit and eat  that's for sure there was also a table in the back of the lounge with one table  one tiny table almost like an old-time school desk yeah and one chair looking  out on the bay windows looking directly at the train station hmm and if I was  popping by myself that is where I would request to sit yeah it's this little  private nook it's yeah it's pretty neat but then there's a lot of like cool  stuff all around like every table is neat I think there's said there's some  table that was a prop from the happiest millionaire this 60s Disney movie  period piece the host station oh is that it I think and then there was an old  there used to be a phone booth in the original okay I think not there anymore  I or in another room I didn't think to look for it but that came up reading  about the original Club 33 huh huh and beautiful beautiful paintings and all of  the yell so where is also what they call Richard craft absolutely that I mean you  like in his element I'll say that what are like you know what a blast hanging  out with them and like I don't you know I'm not gonna go telling stories that  he told us but this is like you may have heard in the episode he's like he  represents here's his Danny Elfman he represents Jerry Goldsmith he represents  Marc Shaman the writer of Hairspray and all that I didn't also and John Bryan  who but Mike I love him we just saw last night and in concert not been a friendly  way we paid to see him right and and also I don't know if it's him or if it's  the company but but air apparently really the craft management Wow yeah  like air yeah there's one of them their film scores are wonderful it's also he  represents like all the coolest like like Pat like past and present a wide  wide range of cool composers and he had like amazing stories from all that and  yeah super super cool to hang out and hear all of it and what else well we  went so like let's like let's step by step a little more so we go to go into  the back of like New Orleans Square toward like if you're headed if you were  headed to the Blue Bayou and we're Club 33 used to be you just keep going back  to the Court of Angels so then there's all it sort of indicates I forget how it  indicates outside that it's 33 it's not as big like it used to be that we  couldn't figure out how to do it like Hill people we were just knocking on this  right so we know this is the real door yeah so we eventually figured out that  that was the real door yeah and then I think Nicholas like a like scan a card  or something yeah I think that there is supposedly there's so much rumor about  exactly what it is but I think yeah you're right there's a card scanning and  then you go and you're in a tiny little room with like two or three employees or  something yeah and they have like two or three employees with a desk and a  beautiful crystal display case of all the Club 33 exclusive merch yeah merch  and collectibles and stuff which really caught me off guard I totally didn't  realize there was Club 33 exclusive merch which is embarrassing I didn't  remember no yeah which of course I went wild for and I'll say what I got later  so yeah it's just like a normal restaurant thing where they're like  looking up your name and then they basically send you into the Court of  that amazing water what was the flavor of the water do you remember it was it or  was just fruit and I said lavender oh you said it okay it was like yeah cuz I  had never had water that good I don't think I think it was the best water I  ever had it was really nice and I Jason I can only zoom lavender water treats  your body just fine yes do you think though you you weren't peeing because you  ate straight had so much lavender water earlier and then you had like a cocktail  I mean yes cumulative it probably out I had I saw you with your mouth on the  spigot just pouring the lavender water in yeah and you could see the water  going through like bumps in my body right yeah yeah yeah walking water bed  yeah and then we had I rolled you up the stairs yeah I mean I think I was  drinking a lot of water to begin with that's healthy yeah yeah so then we you  kind of down there and then did they call I'm trying to remember my memories  already he's kind of overwhelmed and there was a lot yeah it's it was like a  dream a little bit of a dream yeah and then you would just walk upstairs and  the bathroom is up sort of on the like Terrace type thing or in like the walkway  up there and then you go through big doors and you're in Club 33 and there's  tile display yes we have a photo of that yeah yeah and then they kind of like  make you wait a second and then they take you to the table yeah there's a  hostess I mean every door open for everyone greeting you very nice asking  if you need anything yes well that's what I've read is that there it's I mean  like the does this Disney standard of service that you find everywhere and  certainly in the restaurants and the hotels especially the hospitality is  always great but I think the Club 33 people are like hyper trained yes yeah  like many months of super hospitality training and yes and it showed and like  boy did they were they helpful with food and drink recommendations right and  they put like their most knowledgeable people I think on it too I mean the  person we there are waitress had been working there for many many years so  knew a lot of stuff but I think like they probably have to pass like extra  tests in like Disneyland history and I bet like I bet like they have to know  more they have to be like there yeah I mean she's just telling us about the  lounge she's like oh of course this lounge is new in the last few years this  whole physical space you are in used to just be storage for like the stores  right below or like other New Orleans Square area merchandise and stuff and  then they had to reconfigure all of that because the pictures is pre  refurbishment the bar was so tiny like the lounge bar area was so tiny and  like just had a few maybe a couch and a few chairs it was almost just like a  hallway mm-hmm yeah whereas now this is this giant ornate bar it's just  wonderful well should we hear should we talk about it's okay so we're we're  entering you go through this hallway that's very very dim that is on either  side of you is case after case of fancy wine bottles you know so my eyes were  bouncing out sure like the mask and my pupils turned into wine bottle shape we  all turned into cartoons at certain points it depends our star particular  things active and then when I went up to the merch I saw the merch thing the  cabinet with the glass I my tongue like shot out and my tongue was giant and  like licking the glass in front of the exclusive club 33 merge and when they  accidentally put the check in front of Jason Richard he turned into a devil  like the incredible five feet up in the air and my legs looking like legs and  we're just spinning tires like yeah the check came and then we just turn there  a puff of dust Jason's perfect shape yes he sped out of there to steal more  paper towels so you yeah you go through this it's this amazing hallway like mood  and they're just like perfect I couldn't pretend to know the type of wood but  right is very like old-school mahogany crazy wine cellar and then further down  this hallway on either side of you are a couple of booths yeah very small and  exclusive yes that are all in each one is themed to a different ride I believe  there's a Pirates one a Haunted Mansion one a Tom's Island one that's like is  if it's like Tom and Huck on on the island like watching the Mark Twain go  by and then is it a bit was it a big Thunder I don't remember the fourth I am  looking through my photos I have a picture of the pirate ship and I have a  yeah I don't know I truly like felt so weird and overwhelmed in there I don't  know why I didn't photos yeah I felt uncomfortable doing that I think I was  trying to play it cool as well yeah yeah I think I don't want them to be like oh  look at those rubes look at those like they were more than encouraging oh yeah  they didn't photos ask question that's we get it mm-hmm right that's my that's  my problem not theirs because yeah I think I didn't take these pictures till  later like we were walking in I was like oh cool cool yeah cool oh great oh  whatever well you don't want to do it right away but once we felt like at home  once we sure there for three and a half hours whatever it was but anyway yeah  there's like there's there's little bits of Disney magic throughout this  restaurant is really what makes it so cool and these paintings have little  effects you know the Mark Twain puffs smoke or that I don't know what they'll  do but it's very it's like the ship's a little boo oh okay okay it's it's very  similar to the effect that the effects they have it like Trader Sam's yeah yeah  we're like a volcano shoot like shoots up once in a while when you order the  right drink which to eat at one of those booths would have been great but we had  a bigger with a bigger party and we were somewhere kind of just like dead  standing up dead center of the of the lab Le Salon Nouveau we sure we were  there so long though we could have each for an hour just gone in our own booth  alone yeah yeah because there was enough seat out like yeah pretty quickly the  most we had the place to ourselves and we're able to the bar had effects going  to similar to Club 30 oh yeah our effects were very cool yeah so yeah in  the the bar has kind I mean it's just like it's it's you know it's it's very  like Maleficent essentially it's like sort of like apothecary weird like yeah  study with vials and stuff and then with a big like crystal ball orb thing in the  center and every once in a while the crystal ball lights up with a swirl of  magic and the swirl spreads down the bar to like a little trumpet on either side  and then a ghost appears and starts playing the trumpet back and forth  trumpet goes yeah oh cool that's my highlight a mate like a bar with little  and to be you know that it's it's that it's well done Disney magic it's not  some like half-assed theme bar thing it like yeah it was so like detailed and  subtle and it's yeah it's I have a picture of it when the effect is not  going and it just looks like I don't know if that's a trumpet or like I  guess a tie yeah it's just a tiny trumpet or like a flugelhorn maybe is  what it's called but it's just like sitting there are you laughing at  it is a funny name it's just it does like it's one of those effects where  it's not clear that an effect is coming or is going to happen it's just looks  like a trumpet or whatever is sitting hanging there yeah and then when the  effect happens a ghost is playing it and it's crazy and you're really not sure how  it's done it's wild yeah like there's a couple effects like a Tokyo Disney like  they're like that where you're like staring at it and going what I'm not  sure like so cool yeah very very cool thing like that but only the members  get to see or the roofs that they let join them right only Goldman Sachs  employees get to see that ghost playing a flugelhorn yeah and it should it  should be noted that the lounge they were saying it's like oh it's harder to  get a reservation at the lounge because for one thing you have to be with a  member right like a member can make you reservations for the dining room  although I saw one thing online did you guys come across this that like say  someone made reservations for you or I think even for members this holds if you  are going to eat in the dining room there was a food minimum oh yeah possibly  equivalent to a one-day admission ticket sure per person it's pricey yeah per  person or the full full meal I think per person mm-hmm yeah because they're and I  think this is the appeal of the lounge is that if you've gone there for dinner  you know for for the many decades this has been open it's been like a you know  fancy four course meal that you have to do and and probably liquor on top of  that and to make the minimum and which is great and it was it was wonderful  when I got to do it but you end up spending a lot and the but in the lounge  it's more casual you could do piecemeal stuff you can get you can get a burger  although even the burgers are like we're crazy fancy burgers and it's still like  elevated and great food but you can it's it's certainly more casual than I think  that the dining experience have been although would they we were offered  four course menu they're like here is the four course menu right a la carte  menu if you see something on the four course menu you can order it a la carte  it was lunchtime yeah we were there it's unclear yeah so so the thing I kept  finding is it's unclear exactly what the system is for like because there are  tiers now to club 33 membership as well okay for different lounges and it's or  it's unclear now exactly what level because I think there's only the top  tier gets you into the lounge in general I could I can be completely wrong about  this somebody easily can correct me I'm sure but it seems like access to which  we did go to later do we even talk about Club 1901 we probably have to right yeah  yeah sure but there's a club in California Adventure that is a lot  smaller and I think that is like supposedly you have to be top tier access  in Club 33 to do that and I think also lounge access as something like I think  there might be like a base level Club 33 that you can just go to the dinner and  lunch in the regular dining room it's unclear though is what I'm saying there's  a lot of missfully there's a lot of misinformation online there's like old  I think stuff a lot of stuff has changed the membership fees they list are all  over the map we should have called oh and I tried to figure out that number is  not public oh right we would have had to acquire it some oh there's an official  website for Club 33 but it says nothing you can't you write sign in as a member  right there's no FAQ where it tells you how much it costs like some Hollywood  agencies or production companies that essentially just they have a website  because they have to but it is just essentially a business card yeah yeah  pro website right yesterday Scott we were talking about this and we'll we'll  probably do this at wrap-up but now that I'm thinking about it remind like we  were saying like what our dream version of Club 33 would be like what we would  pay for and I've just I'm just now realizing I know the perfect thing so  let's remember to do this  we'll hold on to that at the end  where are we saying that?  misinformation about  you know what I keep finding is that when I tell people we got to do this I say oh we went to the  California Adventure one too they don't know 1901 I think people know yes and so  if you're so next time you're if you're at Disneyland you're waiting in line for  the Carthay Circle restaurant off to the right there is a sign says 1901 it's  sort of hidden and you have to put your card up and then the 1901 lights up oh it  lights up yeah fast pass but oh that's so it's like you know what is hiding in  plain sight too because if you stand under the marquee of Carthay Circle  straight ahead is the lobby for the restaurant slightly to the right is  direct entry into the bar I think and then next to that is the 1901 door yeah  and I didn't I I've heard of somebody told a couple years ago it was like  there's one in Carthay and I was like what are you talking about and then it  was confirmed that it exists I still did not know where the door was and we've  waited in line for Carthay a million times it's right next to the door yeah  we've we've been in there before I just was like all these two doors that don't  go anywhere but they go to 1901 it's like the it's like the Buzz Lightyear  astro blaster target in the hallway it seems to be the same technology where  it's like dark and then you shoot it and it kind of lights up in a little like  D way that's what it looked like to me when you like they put his card to the  1901 sign and it lit up as 1901 anyway to that and there should be a secret  target that you can hit in Buzz Lightyear that gets you lifetime oh yeah sure  Club 33 I feel would be a lot more incentivized to I don't know why they  need people to be incentivized but right I knew about the 1901 lounge but I  thought it was upstairs like cuz there's that patio that's what I thought too yes  I'm like wait how can I sit on that patio so I guess it's just outdoor seating  you know you can set up there for regular and Karthik yeah I've sat on  that patio before a car thing but I I thought it was upstairs somewhere they're  just like a magical upstairs place that I didn't think like I didn't know or it  was like I didn't think it was in like the tower and the tower whatever you  would call it's not a cloud that's a little private bar all the way up in the  That would be great.
 Yeah yeah yeah.
 That would be fantastic.
 Well here let's go back.
  Let's stick with Club 33.
 Okay well you want to talk food and such? Yeah because I also when you  talk about remodels and stuff that have happened there apparently was a room  called the trophy room that is not there anymore which I guess I recall now when  I was there five years ago I do have a picture there and it's a very like it's  product of its time so it's definitely what fancy people thought was like a  novel back in the 60s yeah yeah it is filled with I think Walt's original idea  was to have it filled with animatronic animals oh that didn't really happen but  we'll talk about the fanciest Chuck E.
 Cheese in the world yeah there are a lot  of mounted and stuff like game wild game animals yeah were there and then a lot  of photos and memorabilia including signed a signed fest part rifle signed by  fest Parker Davy Crockett and then a bottle of fest Parker wine signed by fest  Parker oh sweet I love the fest Parker wine that's cool yeah but so so my my  my cocktail it was a was called the trophy room cocktail as a tribute to the  what used to be there and apparently I was looking for something that like I  bartender at Le Salon Nouveau it was in the section Le Salon Nouveau originals  bourbon cognac maraschino, Cynar, whatever that is and bitters one of the best  drinks I've ever had insane so one of and like and high high content like  really good like the the thinnest drink there's like very little liquid in  there but man potent I was sailing it was great one of the best cocktails I've ever had  high marks for that I took picture because the drink menus were were  dressed up like you know old books yeah and then I was like oh that's a fun  container and then inside I'm like this is almost a novella length like there  were so many pages of drinks of like yeah the classic cocktails that are are  hard to find like you can they had a Vesper which is the drink James Bond  woulders in Casino Royale named after Vesper and it oh I I wanted to order it  and then I'm like no I will be under the tape because it's only vodka gin and  lilette which is I looked up or I asked someone and they're like oh it's a  fortified wine you would have been in the bathroom constantly for sure yeah as  it stands I forget the name I took pictures of the drink menus I did not  take a picture of the page the drink I ordered there's a picture I was like I  found a picture online it was called like a ship of the sea or something it  was called something was nautical both yeah you both laughed when I ordered it  oh really it's mostly it was rye and cherry bitters and something else  served up I think I just now I might I just have a base of enjoying listening  to you order in the wake of when we went to this City Walk Hotel or the  Universal Hotel and hearing you proudly say an apple strudel please it was done  with such gusto I feel like any probably just some boring drink item I would  enjoy hearing you order at this point yeah well look I know if I'm ordering  something a little sale with like a silly Dave or something I think you  are barely alcohol content you're gonna get at Club 33 can you make a  transformer I ordered their version of the transformer I think right well I  honestly I don't have like great photos of it I ordered the hurricane though I  think yeah you order the classic hurricane the paddle the original the  hurricane invented at Pat O'Brien's in New Orleans the drink and this was like  I didn't know the history version the original made with fresh fruit juices  and stuff nowadays I think people think oh a hurricane that's like syrup and  tea serve yeah I'm gonna get fucked up that looked very good although they  brought you a different drink yes I got double drinks you got double drinks and  they're like oh sorry we must have some wires got crossed just keep that one  we'll get your hurts you would do was the other one I'm trying to remember it  was kind of like a why it almost tastes like kind of a wine spritzer or something  it was very good it was like kind of like a subtly wine type of taste but I  don't remember the name of it did anyone just to refresh my memory did anybody  get the Louie the 13th rare cask cognac for $1,500 per one ounce serving I  stared at the cognac like locked cabinet uh-huh because those prices were truly  fascinating to like I didn't if I were sheer got eight of those right yeah and  had to be we had to call him a cab to get him home sure sure in a torius mess  yeah yeah yeah yeah and loves to spend money like loves him like loves a  $10,000 drink yeah he's like yeah this is this is nothing to me and then he  shoved all of us in the face I he's a monster usually has like a coke bottle  that he dumps the soda out of and pours crown into and he's like this is my fast  pass he kept saying this is my fast pass of course this is silly but we I get we  could probably say because he was Steve's you know joking around to everyone  with it that like he we stayed pretty late at the park and he's like I have to  she was working yeah she was shooting great of course well the fact that I had  forgotten that that she is in the cast of grace and Frankie as Jane Fonda's  daughter yeah which is a very fun so yeah impressive body of work June was oh  my god June was with Jane Fonda and sure was with Jason and Mike and Scott the  so all right so we're all we're all wasted on cognac we also ordered when  they asked if we wanted second like you and I both ordered beers like club 33  exclusive beer like I had a porter mm-hmm that they they explained they're  like oh this was made just for us it was aged in bourbon barrels that at one  point were used to make bourbon just for us oh cool and yeah sir they're like  it's a very small portion because it is potent and it was good it was like a very  I don't order dark beers a lot but I was very interesting like to have yeah this  beer there was another beer there was like a blonde ale made just for them  they're like we're out of that and oh I would have really enjoyed that I got  something that was well first but first I got a like giant goblet of wine that  was a Kurt Russell wine yeah so I'm drinking a Goldie that was that was a  blast and then I threw a beer on top of it and like walking up and we'd already  the meal had closed out and walking up to the bar and like paying for paying  for a big nice beer at the club 33 bar felt super cool and then we that post  our meal like we went outside to the veranda and said and like stood out  there I forget if you guys had drinks or not but I didn't we didn't you know but  then I like sipping a beer on a porch Disneyland incredible I do not take this  for granted that was super cool I felt just so like relaxed and posted the  picture yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah there's a little hint of where we were pretty  quickly caught on yeah yeah yeah it was there was so crowded too it truly felt  like you were we were king like kings ha ha ha we are here and quite like nice  air-conditioned we have a room to ourselves and I'll look at all of you  it's 85 degrees out and you can't move anywhere I am drinking a beverage that  you couldn't have in this park right tried until I until you've journeyed to  2019 until the evil Lucasfilm Empire yes sullies the park forever with the  novelty blue cocktail until Dexter Jekster serves you an alcoholic milkshake  at his diner well well we finally like as a return to form in tribute to the  old tobaccoist will will you be able to get deaths or death sticks were you  about to call him cancer sticks I was gonna call the cancer stuff fucked it up  I knew it was death yeah death sticks is the name for cigarettes and the prequels  oh that's really I have cigarettes and they call them death sticks Kenobi like  you know takes a trip to flavor country and one shot at Dexter Jeksters huh I  would just I would love that if they had a there's no way they're selling that  sticks at Galaxy's Edge vapes back in Galaxy's Edge there's no way I think  it's a good idea love Jules is the thing I've learned that's another cool  youngster thing you got me I don't know about jewel yeah by the federal  government or the New York State oh my god very cool movie past jewel all the  great companies currently under all the best all the best companies were founded  after 2012 all the coolest least corrupt most progressive CEOs hey I'm still  holding on to my Theranos that stock what's there I know there knows was the  blood testing startup that turned out to be a massive scam oh my god yeah and  this is very odd woman Elizabeth is Elizabeth Holmes I think like trying to  jobs and like it took a few years but there is a book out about it called bad  blood that they has been exited cheese cool and it's it's like a page turning  read like I've only read parts of the but it's like wow what a con like music  music man level con there's pictures of like Joe Biden touring this place of  like this is gonna revolutionize blood testing and they're gonna partner with  and it all just turned out wow I've never heard about any of this oh I can't  I can't wait for wait what's the name of the company Theranos there in us there  so this do we think Theranos has a corporate membership to club 33 or  juice oh yeah for sure crazy juice one where you could you could just squeeze  the packages yourself if not use the $400 $500 pressing machine it's a  you're paying for like a little prick the bag yeah you're paying for a  glorified sewing needle insane so it's really what you know in this situation  we are we are living like like CEOs essentially because like I don't think I  and looking into the history a little I didn't realize that a lot of the  memberships and the initial impetus for starting this place was it was to  entertain clients and sponsors right of Disneyland and that's a lot of the  memberships are like interchangeable like that company can send somebody to  I don't know what the companies are necessarily it's not public oh yeah I  guess I guess it wouldn't be but that's part but part of the the rumor about the  name is that 30 33 potentially was the number of sponsors at the time oh right  also but also 33 well people have said it's somewhere it's like mouse ears  turned on its side I think it's the address of the club is 33 Royal Street  yes but in terms of New Orleans Square storyline and might also be the address  on the liquor license yo and that's part of it's probably the literal need for a  an address was speed needed a separate address from Disneyland yeah but there's  also do you guys catch the crazy rumor but what club 33 refers to I don't know  like though that's how the Satanists greet each other it's you're not you're  not far off people think that Disney himself was a a 33rd degree Freemason oh  that's a level of Freemasonry that you can climb to and it's a it's a nod to  that and people have tried to pick apart like designs on the floor like this  spiral or whatever clearly is a reference to the to the Freemasons  that's like so I know like Denver Airport shit that's Denver Airport thing  oh the Denver Airport people like it is it's apparently a very odd architectural  creation and there's a lot of weird art and and people if I talked about this on  the show I feel like I've talked about this before but there's like art that  people are like no this is this is to summon the demon mullock and this is  like there's illuminati messages or Satanist messages which I think the  airport is now being refurbished and the Denver Airport is like having fun with  the urban legends and stuff like you know they should have find out what  secrets will be revealed yeah they're playing with it because it's now it's  just so old and such a thing it's a the mode it's a haunted Auntie Anne's yeah  it may also be a people mover that might be one of the few existing I believe  Houston had a Houston Airport has a people like a Disney a wed way people  yes I don't know about other words there's other other places have like  similar implements right I think theirs is an official Disney made anyway  I don't know that is bizarre that that's a 33 does have Freemason right  significance should I join the Freemasons sure how easy is it Evans I  don't know how much does that cost we talked about joining the Elks Lodge  yeah we should join the Elks Lodge like a like rotor rotary yeah and just hear  old men tell stories well I think that's what you go do this and oh shrimp boils  shrimp oils and like this I didn't realize that was part of it yeah there's  all kinds of cool clubs we could join in fact I was gonna propose to you guys  should should we like maybe the prep the perfect use of the patreon funds is to  just start a corporate membership for the three of the podcast the ride  corporate membership club 33 just all it all goes right to that I don't know you  know I know it's a great write-off we can entertain podcasts the important  podcast the right clients and guests you know like our girlfriends and wives I  think it's a good could be crucial to keeping up the relationships I don't  look I like what you're saying I think that it makes a lot of sense I think  maybe we start with Florida because it's cheaper I think initiation fee wise  all right okay I think there's one in each park and there's one in each park  new pretty new and the last very new yeah I think maybe they all are not even  open yet but I think it's they announced pricing for them so that's official and  I think they're like 25,000 to get in and then like 10,000 upkeep because I  think Disneyland if we want to do the good stuff it's a hundred grand now to  get in so maybe we start with Florida just because it's cheaper mm-hmm and then we  can entertain clients and it makes a lot of sense to have a membership to an  insanely expensive private club in your state across the country I think that's  right if we can get like some real Chappo Trap house fuck you patriot money  I think that's fair that if we start making that level of money sure yeah we  can do something dumb that it actually that it actually might behoove us that  it might be all right off if we make if you want to look up Chappo I forget how  much money they're making if we can make that amount of money we will send Jason  to Florida permanently and he will be a permanent on-the-ground cub reporter for  Florida so we can be bi-coastally represented he's looking to the sky and  he doesn't he's not upset about it well cuz I feel like last I saw they were  like a hundred thousand yes so now so now what we're asking people to do it's  not like okay help us out a little and then we can give you some fun bonus  episode we're relocating one of the hosts and I like to you know what I think  the issue would be if we were always Skyping with Jason they'd be it'd feel a  little impersonal and you wouldn't feel the dynamic presence of Jason in the room  T1 line it's a paper like t3 or or yeah well that could be a help in what I'm  proposing which is what maybe one better which is that way and an animatronic  Jason that he is operating like an avatar remotely yeah up to all of the  wires and the sensors like the guy programming the carousel of progress guy  so you what we need now we room and board for you in Florida and like phone  robot mechanism so that there can be a robot Jason here at all yeah here's what  we need we need three months of the El Chapo trap house patreon first month  hundred grand we can get you a house in Orlando for a hundred grand I was kind  of hoping for like whatever the highest suite at the boardwalk hotel you want  to live like telly at the boardwalk telly is probably healthier sloppy telly  tissue boxes on my feet as shoes that's gonna be a lot more expensive  unfortunately so maybe you're probably right so we're gonna have to up well  clearly all right latitude Margaritaville latitude Margaret that's  what I think we can do that I think that's two months worth of El Chapo  trap house we were looking at no no I screwed up yeah I can't screw it up  what's the highest level of patron and I think okay it's 33 grand a month which  gives you the satisfaction of knowing that your favorite host Jason has put up  in the nicest room and board possible we can get your family down there too like  telly yeah sure what would it be if we didn't move your parents also yeah I  think that's a great idea and then yeah paintings you need better but you need  to redecorate the suite also yeah oh 100% yeah this is a single visit to Club 33  has I'll put it on my so it's gone to my head I'm dreaming lavish tree yeah  I can't go back to coach because I've been in first class we're looted we're  mad mad now yeah I know we lost our minds yeah these new microphone stands  have really changed at Club 33 in these new microphone stands they've freed us  yes yeah expense number one microphone stands so you don't hear our wires  rustling around to relocation of a host in a robot in his place reasonable just  know that the page the patreon donations are going to real things that  we really yeah well so the food the food yeah so we order I had a cheeseburger I  had the cheeseburger so good it might be one of the best if you really cheeseburger I  it was yeah at least top two or three I don't even have the other examples of  what though are in the top three but I was like whoa this is legit awesome hmm  yeah and the fries were good very good but not like at the level of the  okay the cheeseburger had like bacon jam and it was a fancy cheeseburger  cheese they told us like just so you know the patty is made with the  trimmings of our sir Lloyd's and fillet so it is essentially a real right yes  exactly oh my god and that's like a rugel on it yeah and yeah like some what  was the cheese did you say that I had never it was it was similar to a brie  or like a goat cheese or something Andrews or post it I have a picture of  this yeah picture it was cheese squeezed out of the Big Thunder Mountain go they  had actually it produces cheese only for club 33 members and they were very  using robot I asked like oh do you because I was like oh the steak frites  are the burger and they're like the steak frites are steak frites but the  burger is very special yeah she pushed the burger and I choose right to do it  Andre cheese sauce Bernays tomato it's kind of like a tomato relish or  something and it cost $33 which I thought was very cute very cute yes very  charming I had a fancy fish thing that was great I don't remember a lot of  details about it but I love you know Carthay Circle makes really good fish  any whatever their catch of the day is always great oh yeah you had the catch  of the day and I remember it was served in lobster bisque cheese yes and they  caught it I would have like I think was lobster sausage yes or people like did  we are we do we sound horrible yeah it is a disgusting episode yeah and then we  then it was the most perfect sauce I'd ever have usually when I go to the park  like I stop at a grocery store to buy a bottle of water at a cliff bar ahead of  time so I don't have to yeah and I've like money there and I figured out all  the locations of the free water so that I don't have to buy a sunny  constantly yeah this is how it usually works this was a treat and we really  appreciate it and it was great we're not becoming monsters here's the test of  how when you will here's when we will become monsters is when you catch wind  that we go a lot and we don't talk about it that is when we truly will become  monsters because you will not hear about it we will keep our monster  monsters in his private right now we're just humble nice guys that are very  excited to go to a fancy place that we've dreamed about going yeah when  people on the social media are like hey I was in the park and I walked up to  what I thought was one of them and I said hey are you from podcast a ride and  and they wrote they replied no wouldn't make eye contact and walk away they  wish I used to be now I'm better they somebody walked under us while we were  on the balcony of Club 33 and they said podcast the ride guys save us and the  podcast the ride guys turned and said no hard rain hard rain hard rain fell on  New Orleans our rain of four dollar to Saudi water a school fall we know that  Club 33 is equipped with ropes you could pull us up to the balcony no drown  we're up here there's a reason we're up here I cheeseburger was great yeah so  so good I had so much catch of the day here's another weird Jason moment  because they said like oh it either comes like on a bed of a lobster bisque  or a bed of oyster stew and you heard it out you got excited to go to sleep I did  well I know what but I kind of cut in and I was like can I ask is it a  traditional oyster stew because traditional oyster stew is is you can  it in some set places in South Jersey it's mostly cream and some light spices  and fresh oysters it's pretty simple it's not the most robust flavor that's  a very acquired taste mm-hmm and it's very creamy and I they're like yes it's  prepared the traditional way and I was like yeah maybe get the bisque you did  help me out you gave me good tips and and the bend the wages was super helpful  and like recommended pretty like talked me through so much stuff it was it was  oh it was wonderful it was a wonderful like perfectly catered experience while  we listened to wonderful stories from our from our friends and guests and yeah  it was great time so also what another thing that happened is that Jason  celebrates his birthday like kind of for a month straight so like he had a  four days after my birthday but you are a birthday guy who loves to stretch it out  sign up for all these email programs that restaurants and stores have right  they've gotten pretty good they've gotten good this year I was very happy  because a lot of them were like this is good for the entirety of your birthday  but so I've not bought a lot of groceries no I know cuz you you are I  mean look I'm a guy who likes checking I'm a guy who likes deals I like to  promotions like just locked down I've never seen someone do it so much you'd  be like I have 12 free birthday lunches coming from various restaurants like you  have got it down I had a free pastry for breakfast for Panera on the drive down  yeah right I remember that and then you oh yeah because you were like hey do  you want this thing and you first you acted like you had just bought it for me  but then you know I asked if you wanted something and you say just get me what you get and I got a  you revealed it to me later as if like well I just in full disclosure I got it  for free you did say like you did I thought that was funny because like the  doughnuts they're just like no I just take it right which is another time when  you came over with doughnuts and you and the employee told you just take it we're  closing soon and I said it's like six o'clock they're not closing soon and  you're like I don't know right what do you mean all right that's that's I'm not  insulting you that's just what happened  yeah I know anyway sitting back and watching this is something the first no  no no scolds okay so this is so dessert related context for this all I was just  doing was goofing on you for celebrating your birthday for weeks I  wasn't goofing on you for getting those three donuts okay so you asked for the  button up for these look I got a free butter cake to go from California Pizza  Kitchen one day I was coming home from something I'm like oh I got a free  dessert and the fine print says you could do it for takeout so I sure walked  in and walked out with a piece of cake to eat it I believe I think that you have  some I think you have different drivers licenses every state in the country and  you do it do you do a birthday tour you it's a different birthday every three  weeks that is a great scam because you've worked out a string of CPKs and  Jersey mics yeah he's thinking about it also you should have bought went before  the upstar crow stopped selling those life fake licenses you should have just  bought those oh yeah it was right it's yeah it's apartments this I believe  there's you were born on John Lennon's death day it's a free egg roll you're  John Lennon you're oh you are John here you you want your free birthday scoop  but it says under restrictions diabetes I don't know if the good conscience I  there is a novelty drivers license the word that said Halle Berry's as it  mentioned that she has diabetes which is a fact that I didn't know and really  yeah I didn't know back to the city walk so basically so it does it can they  brought us dessert menu yeah well hold on going back a little bit one of my  favorite things is to go with you in the week surrounding your birthday because  you insist on the birthday button which is something I've never gotten it's like  too much attention for me for whatever reason but you get it and it's great  because everyone wishes you happy birthday yeah and sometimes you get  little and sometimes you get little treats which I guess honestly makes you  smarter than me because I should have to just do that every year one of my  favorite times we were walking down by the Grizzly challenge trail and a man  was playing like nice soft acoustic guitar and he's like happy birthday Jason  like I was like fantastic this is wonderful so we walked in and you got  asked for the birthday button and they say happy birthday so because you were  wearing that in club 33 they brought you a special dessert and you because no one  ordered dessert we got dessert menus and I'm like oh Valhura chocolate  absolutely chocolate mousse tart 100% but everyone else was like nah I don't  think they have a dessert and like your heart saint we heard it yeah and I  guess I could have pushed but I was also a little groggy from that burger was  really a lot yeah it was a lot the drinks for a lot so well the thing you  take me better for my body if I hadn't had full-size dessert I think the thing  is you take your cues from people who have taken you somewhere that's probably  if everyone had had a dirt road yeah so that's the only reason I would have  indulged with you that's all I'm just making an excuse yeah but they brought  me a very charming little dish of strawberry ice cream and a little Mickey  house butter cookie and it was delight it was actually worked out great was the  perfect amount of like sweet to have great yeah I know seeing you with a  little Mickey cookie on a plate on a oh yeah plate that was that was I have a  video of singing happy birthday to you oh that's nice so we can post that yeah  and they went you know this is the cookie you can get in the park it's just  a little bigger yeah that's what they hell yeah sure yeah right to your head  so that was fun again yeah usually I'm there like I'm walking in at the park  going like okay yeah this is my birthday child get the birthday button and then  maybe that'll get I can save some money on that this is that's the normal the  normal hustle to like you save money the day it actually is something we haven't  talked about off air or anything what is your I don't get let's all just try to  eliminate because we're talking a lot but like what is the birthday path you  take like what is the what are the places you have to hit when you have that  birthday button to try it yeah Disney I don't know I we're joking about but I  feel like I forget about it pretty quickly uh-huh there's not a specific  place you go oh you're like they're gonna give me a little this I didn't  have this on but when my family was last visiting we were eating at Napa Rose and  both it was like the week of it was right around both my dad's birthday and  and the person I was dating at the time's birthday and so I like snuck away  to the to our waiters to grab our waiter and like hey we have two birthdays and  and he's like oh okay I'll take care of it and so like after the meal they came  oh he's like I hear there's some we're celebrating some instances so what would  like for your your birthday desserts so he it wasn't like oh here's the little  birthday cupcake we have he brought the full dessert menu and whatever you two  oh wow he did once and then he looked at my brother and I were also there he's  like yeah you guys can order birthday dessert you can get this so like you  know that's like a few $40 $50 free thing at Napa Rose I will say this if  you haven't been to Napa Rose the level of service there is is very is pretty  close to Club 30 like they really take care of you there too I had a guy who  you know once I read an article that was of somebody who was I think  disappointed by the Club 33 experience or not maybe no it just like didn't  think it was like the greatest thing they'd ever they'd ever done even at a  Disney park particularly in terms of food quality and they argued that  Carthay and Napa Rose are both superior just pure food wise which is interesting  because Andrew Sutton the executive chef of Napa Rose was poached or shifted  over to be the newer executive chef of Club 33 oh interesting I didn't know  that huh this was an older article too so maybe that maybe the quality has  improved because of him so that makes sense but that's that's something I  don't feel like they will be lucky enough to get to go to Club 33 I had a  great time it was wonderful I don't this was not like some like earth  shatteringly incredible experience and you know that nor was the the food  exactly that's just the one thing I would say is like you know if you're  looking for top-tier nice Disney experiences Carthay and Napa Rose are  great and like super comparable mm-hmm to this I say just to like if you're  feeling like oh whoa is me I will never get to enter the Xanadu of Club 33  there's great those those places are like you know yeah right it right in  line yeah I mean your steakhouse 55 at the Disneyland Hotel supposed to be  pretty nice to I've never done I would like to do yeah I had a cheeseburger at  the bar once and it was very good I can't remember it was yeah I like that  bar it's a great chill option if Trader Sam's is just oh yeah going back to the  bottom of Trader Sam's is just out of oh yeah I mean like always yeah all the  time yeah well I don't know where what haven't we done we do well we mean we  Intermeal enjoyed enjoyed a truly relaxing beer on the verandah Club 33  where I forget if I said this on the podcast but I told it to you guys and  then the crafts how that in the previous time that I was a Club 33 that I had my  we got there before our before David Melissa who let us in and and we like  watched phantasmac finish out on that porch and I was like I had the ring I've  been like looking for the opportunity to pop the question to Aaron almost did it  there I was gripping it like is that this is pretty cool we're in this like  exclusive zone maybe maybe I do it and then I was like yeah but then we're like  the dinner will be so distracted by that like it'll be hey thanks for letting  us into this nice place anyway we just got engaged and that's more important  than I didn't want to end up in that scenario yeah  Disney Parks blog is here they wanted to write a nice little post about the  engagement yeah yeah Kayla cameras are on us now I don't but I don't but I was  very sad I that's another I've now I've between having a beer up there with y'all  and gripping my my wedding ring and thinking about popping the question five  years prior nice memories on that up on that porch and there's many memories that  come in Florida when we're constantly at Club 33 in all four parks when we shift  our operations on the coast yeah we could do a little Club 1901 well I mean I  think to to wrap up officially Club 33 oh it's a Disney attraction without the  gift shop yeah so so we walk out into the lobby and there's a big glass case  and I think I said I was like oh my god I didn't realize there'd be merch yeah  yeah there was some exclusive shag prints I think there was a print there  was a paint a shag piece in the lounge yeah made for the lounge mm-hmm and  there's a lot of like what they're like wine glasses with 33 the logo on it and  like polo shirts and a lot of golf stuff.
 That was the one thing.
 It's really saying like you know we know you're a rich guy you buy some of this golf crap.
  That was what I found like I like a baseball cap that's like a little  distressed or a little you know a little beat up and it was very like the one  baseball cap they had was like had a lot of those like ventilation hole like it  was very like glossy and it's like yeah this is for golf people yes right for  the rich yeah so I immediately my eyes fixed I was like where the character I'm  looking for like anytime I'm there's merch I'm looking for the character and  he's sitting up here now on the mantle and I'm still not sure if we're gonna  take take him out of the box we could probably will take him out of the box  because he needs to have like a stand like he was in the box yeah that's a  nice box it's a nice box but also like if you go up it kind of looks cheap to  me if you really look at the box well it's got a vintage aesthetic too I think  that yeah I'm torn about it so so anyway they have like a very old looking  distressed Donald Duck not that distressed but he's like his color  palette looks like it's a classic Donald stuffed plush and I was like oh I'm gonna  guy was like probably making a noise on his little foot and on his little foot  is a 33 the logo is on his little foot and this poking it's I'll post a picture  of it online 33 owns him like Andy owns would exactly yes so this is the Donald  for the rich this is rich persons Donald from the 50s I was like having I was  like I don't need glass with stuff and and I turned around and I was like oh  there's a second display case and I'm like there's a keychain and I I love  like good quality part keychain like that is usually my little you know I buy  t-shirts I have a Disney World hat but I don't buy a ton of stuff at the park  I'm pretty picky about what I buy at the park but I like to have a little fun  theme park keychain especially just if you're like doing errands or stuff for  your like like going through the day it's like oh there's a little bit of  parks to cheer you up if you're in a bad mood or something mm-hmm so I've had a  Ministry of Magic keychain which I like Harry Potter I like Harry Potter fine  but mostly I bought it because I'm like I like the park specific like that this  was like hmm a lot of the Universal Harry Potter stuff is very good quality  very detailed and that's kind of why I bought it and now right walk it out for  a little while for this Club 33 keychain nice little blue in the logo I'll take a  picture of it me I haven't swapped it out yet it's still in the nice little bag  Oh really you haven't done it?  No, they gave me this cute this very charming Club 33 bag  hmm right that's Scott you almost weren't you like looking at the wine  glasses you were thinking about it yeah then maybe I didn't have done it  there did there needed to be more characters I think in the merch it's a  lot of like clothes and like let's wear the action figures right like oh you're  Club 33 specific action figures I want to see formerly poor characters hmm like  the Cinderella mice oh yeah that'd be great fancy and snooty yeah like holding  Club 33 scepters yeah there should be like a toy where like Belle goes through  the doors of Club 33 and comes out with the dress on the big yellow dress  the characters in Disney who become rich there should be some sort of diorama  that that happens I know a lot of the design inspiration you know they talk  when they were redoing it they talked about taking cues from Princess and the  Frog a lot oh cuz that's in New Orleans and you could also because there's a lot  there was a jazz festival coming off in the club oh so you could have a toys of  the aristocats in tuxedos oh but they're fancier yeah they're not street riff  riff yeah they got a great gig that's fine they're like set for the year from  this corporate gig there and they're playing way it's not like fun 40s scat  jazz it's like very syrupy corporate you know acoustic guitar right yeah it's  yeah they're playing bony James type jazz adult contemporary you talk about  the design of the place I want to hit the before before we move on I want to  hit the the the two people primarily responsible for how it looks around  there and I think other areas of New Orleans Square because if you walk around  the rest of New Orleans Square it's the same level of ornate and detailed and  feels very authentically New Orleans and the it was based on the club is based on  sketches commissioned from by Walt from Dorothea Redmond Dorothea Redmond was  is considered the first female production designer in Hollywood history  worked on Gone with the Wind worked worked extensively with Hitchcock was  the production designer of rear window and Rebecca Wow I didn't know that yeah  so she did sketches that like set the tone for like what you know Hitchcock  showed to his DP and whatever on those on those films I think she did six seven  films with the Hitchcock all told she designed the private room above Pirates  of the Caribbean that Walt was going to move into which all right that never  happened but they did turn it into the Disney Gallery did you guys ever get to  the Disney I love that Disney Gallery yeah yeah that was really really nice a  Tony Baxter installation in the late 80s at Disneyland and now it is now it's  enclosed again and it is the Disneyland Dream Suite the private now it's not  the dream it's a private dining room now private above Pirates yeah yeah that you  can get for like 15 grand something crazy yeah like if you pooled 15 people  together and they each had a few hundred dollars for a meal like it is it is the  next it is it might be one level up from Club 33 because it's such an ordeal  that's insanity yes I'm incredibly please you can stay anymore I don't  believe so oh interesting okay very right yeah she's amazing her body of  work she also apparently helped design the space needle in Seattle well they  lived till 98 what a badass amazing body and then the actual the actual  interior was designed by the set designer Emile Curie who did production  design for 20,000 Leagues Mary Poppins it's a wonderful life and Hitchcock's  rope man so the level of I think that that really adds to the the authenticity  it's not like some fake fancy experience right like the you're like the the best  Hitchcock people were creating this environment so so cool and I you know I  honestly didn't realize till we were there and I asked the waitress about  this that that Walt's I didn't realize he did not set foot in the place it was  a year or 67 yeah year after he died so this thing designed his specifications  like a perfect place for him and he never got to go but we did so yeah that is  she mentioned and we think we looked at on the way out he used to be in the  trophy room there was a turkey vulture oh and the there was a room set aside  for an actor to be in with a microphone and there were microphones scattered  through out the trophy room with the idea being the vulture would converse  with the guests now that never came to pass and the additional animatronics  never came to pass but when they redid it they mounted this turkey vulture in  the lobby of Club 33 and now he does like wake up and talk every now and yeah  we did get to see him talk and what did he say do you remember it was really  brief yeah he say hello or like good afternoon right and then we like rant  we were like oh hey and then like we stayed for like a minute and we're like  oh that's it huh nothing more happened but that like I'm three drinks in of  like three of the finest drinks I've ever had like great beer great line great  cocktail and then I'm talking to a vulture it this was a perfect little  zone of time just wonderful but I will say I will duck Alfred the vulture points  in that I do he is not well here my personal animatronic of the month this  was not my animatronic highlight it but that instead would have to be as we  talked about before we went on the knots log ride and the bear turned to us and  said trick-or-treat sure that was cooler I have to say then then the vulture sure  so you know this premium robot experiences a lot of other places but  to use the new mobile ordering system yeah I ran over to his side of the table  and I was showing him how to order a dole whip that's true yeah I was  watching Mike in heaven like showing teaching yeah one how to check I was  trying yeah I was trying to teach Scott that when we were there later and he was  like I said I don't care I'm getting in the regular line and I was like I don't  know and then to prove a point I mobile ordered I mean it wasn't really to prove  a point I was just trying to use this system because I like using it and then  we got like our food at the same time but I got to sit down the whole time  instead of standing in line you got to turn to me and give a little look like  hmm see self-satisfied yep no blurring so I don't know self figure it out but  at the mo we're like on the way over like we're almost there like next to the  thing but it's fun as we'll and it's fun to mobile order but we get over to  California venture head and scan the secret thing to get into 1901 I had  also got into that thanks to my friend David and the like I was I was so  excited we get to go in there again because if you've been in the car they  circle bar imagine getting a zone like that but to yourself and I by that point  I do stop dry like I must begin to sober up for him in trouble but I was so glad  that you Mike ordered a drink that came with an orb ice cube well it's yes like  so they have the same drink menu as the car they launch which we've been to  oh what not hungry like exclusive yeah right they had a couple of things but  like I don't know if any of us ordered because we were also just like well yeah  so what so I was asking because my favorite drink at the car they lounge is  a car they Manhattan which has a beautiful circular orb of ice and I  don't know what did Richard say like they have the ice they'll show you how  to like they'll make the ice for you uh-huh which we had not experienced at  the lounge so I was asking away I was like do you make the ice at the bar or  could you make he goes we can do it over here if you want I go well we got to do  it so he brought the ice or making machine over to us and we got to see a  circular perfect sphere of ice be made in front of us that they take a big cube  right and using this gravity press machine it becomes a perfect sphere like  like technology that's probably hasn't changed since the 30s yeah and it just  slowly crushes it into an orb crazy bartending like the or I love this so  much I would watch that I wish I would I'd pay an extra ten dollars at that  lounge oh yeah the orb show that was that's how they made the orb that Trump  at the Saudi Arabia leaders that was that insane anti-terrorism center they  all realize the orb that was an ice orb too it was it was a cube first and then  they said but only he who is pure of hearts can turn it into an orb and Trump  of course the purest of heart and it became the most beautiful orb you've  ever seen he's been doing great lately really killing it 1901 I mean 1901  probably again we'll have to do a full episode on it but you know do we not  everything has to be a full episode hey we got a patreon we got a fill of a  patreon here is a cool what do you what sports cool lounge this cool photos like  the effects that drinks great snacks I'm done well the effects that weren't  working which there was that thing that looks there's tooth I think two of them  oh we saw the one we saw the one they said look at this it's the worst  animation you've ever seen oh it's it was a picture I think of Walt who were  one of the other artists yeah sort of then the arm started to move and draw a  character but it moved it like that wasn't jab.
com yeah that wasn't great but  there were two effects not working which they have wallpaper that look just looks  like wallpaper but then once in a while there's like in a silhouette of Walt's  that appears in like the wallpaper because 1901 lounge is named after the  year he was born right so it's very it's a very cool effect supposedly that's  what everyone says but it was not working the whole thing is very like  there's a bar in there there's a lot of comfortable couches it feels very much  like someone's was the word rumpus room is that the term like oh it hasn't been  for many decades right but sure sure but you that is maybe what I would be  referring to is that what a rumpus room was or no I thought it had a lot a lot of  the study or a day bar but then a little bit of the sort of craftsman accents  what room in the house would this be do you know he like a den or something  room dad's room that's all my dad's dead yeah the dead or a rumpus room is you  know I was gonna say rumpus room is appropriate because it's John that  character that was created 70 years ago yeah and he makes a joke about it  yeah John aka Jason so it's great I mean that was yeah that was wonderful it was  a hell of a time great great stories from these folks this was this was just  blast yeah yeah really really cool to have experienced it but we were we were  talking about this last night that while it is a while it is a wonderful  experience we had a wonderful time and wonderful meal it is I would not say  that it is some mind-bending Lee incredible level of Disneyland access  it's not as if like it's all very cool but there's no like thing that you get  to do or thing that you get to I mean having a drink out on the porch is  great but like I'm just I think I think what we were talking about is is there  if you're gonna pay that amount of money thousands of dollars every year to be  part of this club what is the the exclusive only for you experience that  that the club 33 membership could provide yeah that would really  deeply be worth all that money right and I think last night my first thought was  if club 33 was in like the top of Space Mountain or something like if you if  there was a bar the top of space money you look out over Disneyland there was  like like something like that yeah like and everything was very very hyper  stylized Space Mountain motif inside and like yeah if you could just generally  like in the dark they don't really change anything but there's just like  there's hallways and stuff there's like it's like a secluded little like bar  zone that leads you I like I like what you're saying about at the top if there  was some vista within Space Mountain right and then probably where you like  really have your meal and hang is where the ships take off like where currently  the employees are checking on the the Rockets but get them out of there move  them somewhere I want to have a like a purple drink in there yeah that I mean  like a blue bayou Space Mountain but exclusive club 33 yeah I almost think  three people at a time I know that sure small so yeah let's not we're not filling  that up yeah I want my exclusive rocket vista I almost feel like blue bayou if  it was exclusive would be cooler mm-hmm than like if you could drink and blue  bayou mm-hmm that was your exclusive club that kind of is a more highly  themed experience but I like that it is open to everyone well of course I'm not  saying shut blue bayou none I'm just saying it's a more themed experience  that is true that is more yeah no I'm not saying the rich should only be able  to access blue bayou we're starting to siphon off we're separating the cars  every if there was a if there was a much fancier radiator Springs I want it like  a butt like a book like a private I want a Maserati that's alive who like you know  at the other cars and who all who wins every single time sure he'd like I don't  know what kind of crowd on if Maserati's electric or whatever but it should be  like super gas spewing right the people you should win against the other car  guaranteed and a bunch of such should blow in their faces sure salt entry  that's great yeah we got a I've got a add-on I've got a club 33 at oh go ahead  yes you are you are given a key card and you to for the two for use at the  Grand Californian and you check in at the front desk and they're like all right  your nap suite is available and you're gonna because I mean that was a heavy  heavy so it's like all right we will come and get you at the end of four  hours so you have an hour to settle down get comfortable and then a ideal I  suppose just under three hour nap because then you need to collect  yourself so maybe you you use that hour 30 minutes before 30 minutes after to  compose yourself you get a nice so now you're saying that then you come back to  life and maybe they bring you that nice water at the end and then you're like we  hope you enjoyed your stay so for 50 grand entrance and then like 10 to 25  thousand a year you would if you could take a three hour nap at this a three  hour nap in a really not and I feel like hourly hotels are you presented  usually for seedy affairs frowns upon okay that's not a bad idea to add my so  what the mind the thought I had during the show which I realized is is  basically that the all the touches of of imagineering and theming are awesome in  club 33 but it doesn't feel overwhelming which is sort of the feeling you want  like a blue bayou it's like you're in it you're in the bayou whereas like oh  those are awesome effects here and there but even like being in Trader Sam's to  me feels like a little bit more of an immersive themed experience maybe not a  little bit maybe a lot more so if it was like adventurers club 33 mmm and it was  like as themed as that mm-hmm I think you'd obviously I'd have to be doing a  cool with actors and like the effect which they never did but like you could  talk to a ghost while you eat at the bar like if it was like that hardcore level  theming I think at that point you're like me and I mean that's hundred  thousand dollars but yeah I mean if you could hundred thousand dollars if I was  a multi-millionaire I guess we're talking yeah there's no way if I like  make a hundred grand that's something you order and the puppet general presents  it to you the adventures club that drink that he would have which was just  a bottle of Beefeaters but with like seven straws taped together so we could  reach up to him that's fun so like something like that again if I was a  multi multi-millionaire I would say I do want to go to that club a lot like  cuz that would seem like it would be really worth it to keep going back I  mean I get also that it would be this whole thing would have been more  enticing back when you couldn't get liquor anywhere mm-hmm but now you can  drink every so I've said many times you can walk 500 feet and get a drink so  it's not a big deal and in highly themed great places yeah so yes you know like  the point of like even if I had some money I still think like you probably  would it doesn't make sense to pay for this unless it would they've turned it  into something insane like crazy well that's mine mine would be I mean it's  Kick em out oh yeah right I'm hanging in there now and that is a perfect  vantage point for the big monitors and I want to be able to put whatever I want  on that TV there's a game on I'm watching the game oh you love watching  the game you know me yeah get the game on the big game I want for using the  copyright free would term that we're allowed to use we can't even say the  initials of the football organization you all know the big game yeah so I  that's how Doritos frames it yeah but I want to be able to like imagine this you  can like that maybe I don't want to cut it off from the the regular or you know  a space crew it starts or closes at five o'clock every day it's a that's a  private dining room I sit up there see 3PO and R2D2 talk to me they ask how was  your meal sir well they should be the waitstaff R2 brings the stuff on his  tray like he does a job as Palace yeah see 3PO is though it does you take your  order and Rex is just like sloppy telly he's just it's his little comes out in a  bathrobe and he chats with you and he you know he's got thoughts on the game  cuz he's got money right he's got credits riding on it oh yeah yeah yeah  and I want to hear how everything's going with him and Roxanne I think  they're married and they're doing great and he is one of the top DJs in all of  space he's he's in I want to hear all the wonderful details of Rex's wonderful  life oh yeah he's making Steve Aoki like Vegas money now that's fuck you money  yeah he's smashing his head into synthetic cakes so all right that's my if  I could be I would pave to turn the Star Wars TV onto anything I want and to be  best friends with Rex and now I'm paying 100 grand now all right well  hundred grand for you to live in Star Tours hundred grand for me to have an  adventures club or a space mountain hundred grand for Jason to nap in a  theme park done everyone's on sort of game here I do have I only have one I  should get a new one the figured out years ago where Disney supplies sources  the pillows for the hotels for the night so it tells everybody for really like  50 bucks bucks on Amazon save that for the Disney pillow patreon episode you're  gonna lead the way on that one down is a pain in the ass to care care for though  you can machine wash it but then you really have to dry it because it's a  little wet hey save it for the episode save it for the pillow and we don't want  to give that away here also I think the top tier are another perk of the 33,000  the the the super patreon tier is to is to be able to watch Jason nap oh yeah a  live cam of you nap all right you can access dot com slash you can make more  like twitch you could like how you could sleep in pajamas that are branded so  you're like you're sponsored getting money from Hewlett Packard you're  like what is which is policy on like people sleeping Street or like ASMR  stuff good question like ooh no we know there's some weirdness attached to it or  they're like as long you don't do anything openly dirty you can do it hmm  now I gotta look into well look into it you're the hip young one who knows what  the hip apps and programs do and I yeah I know about jewels and corrupt Silicon  Valley disgraced Silicon Valley blood testing companies and we're not we're  not advertising blue chew yet on the main show oh you don't know about that  Jesus anyway penis thing oh like yeah you know we're doing ads for a penis  thing not yet no but a lot of podcasts these days are doing those oh really  yeah why are we getting that penis money the blue chew penis money let's happily  we'll ask forever dog although maybe we can negotiate that for just the patreon  episodes Jason can cut a deal with the blue chew people on the side for just  the patreon line of discussion at one of our business meet one of our  organizational meeting I want to find out what like the ball enlarging pills  we can get to sponsor the fun alright we got a show sponsored you by WWE's  crown jewel oh boy that will have happened by the time people yeah that's  true or not I know it'll happen but it will yeah all right we gotta go Jason to  Saudi Arabia yep if we get enough money in the patreon you know what I'll put  you in a box of mail you to Abu Dhabi that's the second time that's all right  well we're here we're looping so we should wrap it up you survived podcast  the ride the second gate hey thank you so much hope you're enjoying everything  so far a lot
