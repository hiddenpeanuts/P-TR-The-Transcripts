 Podcast The Ride announces the arrival of a two and a half hour episode featuring droid radio stations, droid raps, droid girlfriends tolerating droid DJ side hustles.
  Kyle Mooney enters the cabin to talk star tours, original Rex version only, on Podcast The Ride.
  Welcome to Podcast The Ride hosted by three guys whose last wills and testaments will just dictate what theme park font they want on their tombstone.
  I'm Scott Gardner.
 Mine obviously would be the Epcot font prototype.
 I will make damn sure that's on my grave.
 Mike Carlson, any selections?  Yeah, I think it's going to be like Frontierland.
 This is sort of a side note.
 As I get older, I find myself gravitating more toward Frontierland than I did as a youth.
  I still love Epcot.
 I guess that is what it is.
 I love Epcot, I love Tomorrowland, but as I get older, I just love the calm Frontierland.
 I'm wistful for a place I never knew, I guess.
  So I'm going to say right now Frontierland maybe.
 Like somewhere in the world, maybe what's on the sign or maybe a big thunder sign.
  Yeah, that sounds great.
 So yeah, I think that'll be, it'll be like a wood and the tombstone will be a plank of wood.
  Wonderful.
  Jason Sheridan?  Yeah, sure.
 Like you had died of consumption on the Oregon Trail.
  Yeah, so just they had to make a makeshift grave and it's just a plank of wood they found on the side of the road.
  Yeah, I'll be a lot like Logan when I die.
  Sure.
 I'd have to say mine is, I don't know what the name of it would be, but it's sort of, it was on, I think they've used it for both Islands of Adventure and the Adventurers Club and it sort of looks like that kind of arching like greetings from so and so, like the old postcard kind of font.
  I can kind of picture that I suppose.
  Yeah.
  I also really, I usually, if I go to a place and they have one of those like greetings from whatever town.
 Okay.
 I usually get those.
 I like those.
  Cars Land 2.
  Yeah.
  That's almost like first generation California adventure.
  Oh yeah, which you said you liked.
  Which you said you liked a lot.
  The Living Postcard.
  You're the only person that's ever said that they miss the first run, first time around California Adventure.
  I associate it with like the, the post-war like American driving vacation.
  Oh, when you were young.
  Yeah.
  When you were a young man.
  Yeah.
  So your tombstone will say greetings from hell.
  Yeah, sure.
  Great.
 Perfect.
  And wait, I don't mean to back you into the, our guest into the, into the font corner.
  But he has to answer.
  I don't know.
  It doesn't have to be a theme park font because I don't mean to include you in that.
  But if you have any fonts you want to call out for a future tombstone, and by the way, so excited to have today from Saturday Night Live and from his great film, Brigsby Bear,  Kyle Mooney is here.
  Oh, yeah.
 Thanks.
  Wow.
 They're really excited about the font stuff.
  A lot of possibilities.
  I don't know.
  When I, I'm going with Ariel Black.
  Okay.
  Very solid.
  This will, you know, right up top.
  So whoever's picking the font set doesn't have to go too far down the list.
  Saves them a trip.
  I don't know.
 Is that, is that theme park relevant at all?  I'm sure it's in a theme park.
  Should I Google Ariel Black theme park font or theme park logo?  Yeah.
  There has to be somebody who used that.
  It's probably in there somewhere.
  And there's a myriad of fantastic fonts in that world.
  I kind of, maybe I want that Pleasure Island moon guy on my tombstone.
  Oh, yeah.
  Oh, the funmeister.
  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 I can never remember his name.
  I just call him the moon guy.
  Are we getting to add a character too?  If you want.
 Yeah, yeah.
  Like I don't want to stay on this point for forever, but feel free to interject, interrupt any topic and say anybody you want.
  But you probably want like a country bear on there.
  No, I want liver lips McGrawl probably.
  Hey, fantastic.
  Any other tombstone requests?  I guess I'm down.
  Are we talking icons are allowed or because these now we're talking about critters.
  And not just like lettering type.
  More like a lot of space on the tombstones.
  Sure, sure, sure.
  Yeah, why not?  Mickey's goofy Donald.
  Yeah, all the ones.
  The whole gang.
  Do you expand all the way?  Do you ever do everybody that a parking garage level is named after is church, Chippendale in there?  It's just those guys and it's an Ariel Black.
  Wow, sweet.
  And they're just like arms folded looking up like cool font.
  Yeah, so you already know what it looks like.
  Yeah, yeah, I can imagine.
  I got a pretty clear image.
  I looked up Ariel Black and just a bunch of Ariel little mermaid stuff came up.
  So there's no way we're going to be able to answer this question because that's not a spell.
  It is.
  It auto corrected me.
  OK, OK, so.
  Well, anyway, now that we've covered that important stuff, Kyle, welcome.
  Yeah, thank you.
  I'm such a fan.
  It's great to be here.
  Thank you.
  So excited to have you.
  And I know this is like some of the goal of this podcast, I feel like, was to bring theme park fans out of the woodwork.
  And I and I know that you are you are one of those.
  And thanks for being so publicly on our podcast.
  But I feel like you're pretty noted in your in your love of theme park stuff.
  Yeah, I don't know.
  But I do like going.
  Yeah, absolutely.
  Yeah, yeah.
  Well, I know you.
  You just say critters, which when you were promoting Grigsby Bear, I think I saw somewhere that you were you consider yourself particularly a critter fan, which I like using that term.
  Yes.
  Yeah, at some point when I was in college, a friend of mine started using the phrase critter pic, which kind of implies a genre of film with critters kind of like in the wake of ET and gremlins.
  There are a lot of these like little guy animatronic movies like Munchies Munchies Strikes Back, The Sand Fairy, Mack and Me is probably a noble one.
  I mean, you could argue you could put Alf in that mix.
  You know, I mean, yeah, yes.
  So like I think, yeah, like any creature like within Splash Mountain is considered a critter.
  It is greater country.
  Right.
  I also not to jump too far ahead, but I was I was unaware until this.
  Well, this was a blank spot for me.
  But I told this week in preparing for this episode, I had not seen Flight of the Navigator.
  Yeah, which is in addition to being a space movie is also a critter movie.
  Yeah, very seminal film for me.
  And especially like the part when is it I get around by the Beach Boys that blasts in there.
  Also insane that I never seen that any like thing that combines culture and Beach Boys.
  And there are a couple of notable things to me about that movie, one, it's so abstract and strange, the like use of like time and like how he's just it's very scary.
  He's like basically a young kid who all of a sudden wakes up and like his whole family is like several years older.
  But there's one scene where he's in like a hospital.
  And I think Sarah Jessica Parker is his nurse or doctor or something.
  Is this accurate?  You know what I didn't I skipped ahead to the parts involving the ship.
  Oh, sure.
  Because the ship is relevant.
  Sorry.
  Yeah.
  So you feel anyway, it was a good there's a he's gift.
  He's he wakes up.
  He's still the same age as he was like five years prior, but five years have passed.
  But you get a good look at like all of the gifts that his family or like friends have given him now that he's because he was missing basically.
  And it's like Transformers in the box.
  It's like just full on like toys from 1986 or whatever the movie came out.
  It's kind of a good good way to see what kind of cool gear one could have gotten that to KB.
  Sure.
  Kind of a snapshot in that moment.
  Yeah.
 Yeah.
  Yeah.
  Well, it's a good one.
  And I didn't if if you don't know the connection, I'm talking about the the voice of the ship, which is something shortens into Max is the is that that is voiced by Paul Rubin's who is, of course, the voice of Rex in today's time.
  Oh, right.
  This ship also was on display at MGM Studios.
  Am I wrong?  I think so.
  It was on the backlot tour.
  I believe I saw it.
  It's a miniature, right?  No, it's a it's a full kind of a full size.
  I believe like balsa wood full size.
  I did not know what the wood I didn't check.
  You know what I mean?  Like it looks like.
  Did it look kind of like it looked like a ship chintzy?  No, it didn't look chintzy.
  It looked good.
  Trying to remember trying to undersell the old flight of the Navigator ship.
  I'll wake it up to make sure.
  But every now and then there would be props on display at Disney MGM Studios where like even as a kid, I was like, I could punch through this.
  But that's the secret to movie making.
  That was cool.
  Like as a kid, you were excited to punch.
  I mean, like, oh, I could punch through this.
  But on the screen, it looks like, yeah, an alien ship.
  I never went to Orlando as a child, but I remember seeing images of the return to Oz like a gate that existed somewhere.
  Oh, sure.
  I don't know if you guys ever saw that, but I like that movie, too.
  Here it is.
  That doesn't look chintzy to me.
  Oh, yeah.
  OK, that is not what I was thinking.
  Sturdy ass ship.
  That looks like one of the Lost in Space, the movie ships from the 1998 movie that Gary Oldman, we all have in our brain.
  Yeah, I saw that opening weekend.
  Sure.
  Yeah, I just don't remember it.
  So we're lost in space.
  All the great films.
  Yeah.
  Navigator.
  I have another question related to you specifically, Kyle, which is that you have I feel like you're also it's fairly well known.
  You have a giant VHS collection and I'm curious what you're I'm curious what what and what treasures in there might be parks relevant.
  Sure.
  Disney relevant.
  I made this movie Briggs Bear with my friend Dave directed it, my friend Kevin co-wrote it with me and like a lot of the press we did was like basically people.
  So you're into videos, right?  Sure.
  I just like when I fell right.
  That's not an attack by any means.
  You should just go work for it tonight, Scott.
  But like, do you have fun making the meds?  It's something that I feel guilty about like talking about because like I know either know of or know people with like much more massive collections.
  So like I was getting nervous that people are like, you think you're the face of VHS?  Everything is terrible.
  Like as a grunt, like now the shots fired.
  Parks related stuff.
  Yeah, I mean, I'm sure I'm sure I bet you guys all have some of them overlaps like I couldn't I don't even know if I could come up with some of the titles.
  I'm right on off hand, but like, yeah, Epcot videos are like I remember back in the day before as a child, like, you know, those Disney sing along videos where you can, you know, like it would be like you'd go through Pirates of the Caribbean and like there'd be the, you know, bouncing Mickey.
  Yeah, that was a nice that was a great like formative video that let you like specifically the Disneyland one because it let you like watch Disneyland footage.
  Even when you weren't at Disneyland.
 Yeah.
 So you could stay thinking about it.
  Oh yeah, I got another thing that was kind of influenced on our movie was this show that was on the Disney Channel called Welcome to Poo Corner.
  I don't know if you guys remember that show.
  I got a couple of videos of that.
 Oh, sure.
  They've got like crazy.
 There's like crazy like stuff about strangers and uncomfortable.
 Yeah.
 PSA type.
 Yeah.
 And that was sorry.
 This is tangential.
 But the person who created that technology for those.
  It was basically like a head that moves this Kent this guy Ken Forsey who also created Ted T.
 Ruxman who worked at Disney prior.
 Oh, interesting.
  He also did the technology for a show called Dumbos Flying Circus, which was like the very same era.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 I don't think those have come up on here.
 Yeah, I remember those really well.
  And I liked them even though now looking back, there's something like grotesque.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Reversing like the way they're they're shot.
 Yeah.
 I don't know what it is.
  It's kind of like an icky soup and like seemingly low.
 It's like high production value in like the animatronics they're using.
 But then like just dumb background.
 Sure.
 Sure.
 Yeah.
 Just vaguely.
 Yeah.
 Exactly.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 That's how they did it.
  It was like it was miniatures in heads like like Teddy or like they were similar.
  Yeah.
 Yeah.
 But they're head.
 Right.
 Right.
 Yeah.
 Is that.
 Yeah.
 Well, they like had like a remote control head.
 Is that how it works? That's what the turtles were.
 The turtles had a head that was being controlled off by somebody else.
 There was somebody working like that.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 I didn't know.
  So then there's a toy of them behind you.
 So are the actual heads of the actors in the heads or they know they removed their heads.
 No.
 Yes.
 They were the heads were in there.
 It's just that to move the mouth and the teeth and to get something.
  I see what you mean.
 No way a human face could manipulate that.
 They're using like I don't know if you said like RC remote control car controllers.
 So nuts.
 And it's like a little when you see the mechanism, it's like an untressed Kermit head almost like just a little like a little sockish thing.
 Yeah.
  That's yeah.
 Sockish.
 Does that help you picture? No, I can picture.
 What's funny is like that technology has evolved so much to the point of like when force awakens came out, there was you had one of these the BB eights you could control with an app on your phone.
  And like it's the technology has evolved so much that not only did we get it in like consumer grade, we got bored with it.
 Yeah.
 I sold my BB.
 Like and that would have been like that was like a whole team working on that movie to like control these heads.
  Yeah, BB wasn't even ready when the when the movie came out because they were still working on the like the commercial cheapish version of the technology.
 Oh, gotcha.
 Do you still have all the things you could complain about about the new Star Wars and force awakens and stuff.
  I do.
 I think it's cool that BB eight is real.
 I think it's neat when he comes out on the Oscars.
 You can keep doing that.
 You know, like I like BB.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 As much as BB wants to appear.
 He's right.
 And it's like it makes me forgive a lot.
  I think that I mean, I don't know how quickly or soon you like to seg in to the topic anytime and with this one whenever well there's one note like that I think about that's notable to me about Star Wars Star Tours rather sorry and is it should we say we're talking about we're talking about Star Tours the original like the improv suggestion.
  Yes.
 Star Tours.
 One of the things I love, I love about it and loved about it.
 It was like scene C3PO or R2D2 or even Rex or whatever.
 These are to me they're real robots.
 They're that's just as good as the real thing.
 You know what I mean? It's not.
 Yeah.
  I think it's an animatronic trying to be a human pirate.
 This is for all in my eyes intensive purposes like a real robot.
 Yeah.
 And possibly real movie props used initially.
 Yeah.
 It seems like Disneyland once it seemed like they retrofit it with animatronic stuff in it.
  Sure.
 Yeah.
 Sure.
 Yeah.
 I agree.
 A very magical thing about it and something that's been said about Muppet Vision 3D similarly, although it's a movie but the characters were in the room with you like it is the same medium like a Muppet is a real thing and they're in the room with you.
  There was talk of more Muppet rides and that would have been very much you're there with Kermit and yeah that's a big thing that makes Star Tours great I think.
 Well yeah let's get into it and let's also clarify that this is in a classic podcast the ride split up of topics.
  This is we're talking about Star Tours original.
 We are drawing the line at the revamp at the adventures continue not in my mind because of any like we refuse or there's a quality because I enjoy the new one a lot but just for the sake of otherwise we're here.
  Which is good for you guys because you can do a second episode.
 Oh yeah we got to think the long game.
 Yeah.
 We can't burn off all these.
 You're so like we could do an individual video for every type of journey one has on Star Tours.
  Yeah sure I was just gonna say we should for sure do one just on Jakku and one for sure just on the crate sequence that leads to Batuu at Black Spire Outpost in Star Wars Galaxies Edge.
 I'm sorry I just got cross-eyed and say what?  Hey look any opportunity to drag these things out as long as possible which we've we've been having this ongoing discussion which I'll bring up and then everyone will tweet at me Scott is dead wrong and I hope he's torn apart by wolves but the podcast  we'll we've just yeah apparently but that we've been discussing there's been a steadfast refusal to do a split of Kung Fu Panda and Shrek 4D.
 Oh yeah yeah Jason I couldn't even convince to do a news slash Kung Fu Pan you were good and I so at this point I'm putting the onus on you I like let's build up as much as possible.
  The grand the grand ultimate Kung Fu Panda 4D episode.
 We walked out of Kung Fu Panda and Scott was like I don't really know I don't really have much to say about that and he was like we combine that with Shrek and Jason are like no way we are doing a whole two hours on Kung Fu Panda.
  I know I know this for some reason is an issue where I'm a fuss budget.
 I mean the effective DreamWorks animation alone on the Universal Studios landscape.
 That's right Jason's right that's gonna be 45 minutes right there.
  Scott is like really for a normal person you're like weird but for the people who listen to this show and Jason and I yeah you are very conservative.
  You can always land being a centrist can make you an extremist that's correct.
 Depending on where you are but anyway the point is this this split up is great and I'm very happy to be doing it but let's but but if I could pose the grand philosophical question what Kyle why Star Tours?  Yeah.
 Well I told you about the real robots.
 Yeah here's one thing that to me is notable about it is without even getting into necessarily the ride itself.
  I first went on this ride at Disneyland I'm from San Diego so we grew up going to Disneyland and I probably the ride opened in 87 I probably I'm born in 84 I probably went on it in like 1990, 89, 91 so around there.
  And I'm gonna give a little backstory here so I apologize.
 No, please.
 But I'm the youngest of three sons.
 And a lot of the stuff I was into as a child were things that were handed down to me.
  So like, I am really into like 80s children, children's television shows like in cartoons like Thundercats or Transformers, He-Man, but like I'm a little I don't know about you guys but I'm like a little off the cusp like it's like those weren't like, I feel like I'm more of the era of like Disney afternoon into like Nicktoons.
  I was born in 85 I know exactly what you're talking.
 Yeah, where you get Thundercats or Transformers but like you find them like I would always find them at yard sales.
 Yes, never got them new.
 Right.
 We just like see them that almost made it more mysterious.
  Yes.
 Yeah, Finn for me it was like my brothers had the toys so I got them.
 And then I'd like go to Blockbuster to rent the videos basically because it wasn't on.
 You couldn't see these cartoons on TV anymore is just like Transformers had just ended I just missed it I was like, probably so obnoxious to my parents  because I'd be like, I want Transformers and it's like well you can't anymore.
 You're late by like a year.
 How do you explain that to a kid though.
 Yeah, I would like I remember like as however old I was seven or six or whatever like going to like finding myself at a Toys R Us and seeing like a clearance aisle with a  Transformers sign I was like, oh my god they still have that like I was like aware, and then like coming through it and being like I don't see anything and then like asking an employee and they'd be like, no, sorry, no, they're on here.
  Anyway, the same goes for Star Wars I got that I kind of inherited all of my brother's Star Wars toys and was really in was pretty into Star Star Wars and what I like about Star Tours is that this is kind of like in the late 80s early night like going into the early 90s.
  It's kind of like I feel like a dark period for Star Wars.
 Yeah, it's like the last things that had happened where they made like a couple Ewok TV specials there was a droid series and an Ewoks cartoon series.
 Yeah, yeah, and then like, and that was like 85 maybe and return to the Jedi was 83 and those are  Steve if you like those they're not like they're they're they're like off.
 They're not incredible.
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
 Ewoks TV movies are upsetting right in many ways, giant spiders whole families dying.
 Yeah, really? Yeah, I never done them actually.
  But this was it felt like the only place to really immerse yourself in Star Wars at that time because it was prior to like special editions or like now you can go anywhere and buy Star Wars gear.
 Right? Yeah, yeah, yeah.
  There's never been a time at this point in time it felt like the Star Trader was like the only place where one could get like relevant right Star Wars merchandise early.
 Is that one Simpsons joke about how when Ralph wins the diorama contest with just with Star Wars figures still in their package and they get laughs out of skin or just saying the names and my favorite chewy and imagine doing that joke today.
  You just say the names of the character like they're so were hit over the head with them at all times but felt like a joke from a time where is Star Wars winding down.
 Yeah, it was it was like, it's not fair to say it was obscure because it was obviously a giant franchise but you just couldn't.
  You couldn't go to Kmart and get like, yeah, paste or whatever you know what I mean.
 Yeah, you too on it.
 Yeah.
 And now even if the run ever ends of a of a movie or two every year, the merch thing will never know it's like we're deep in it.
  Yeah.
 So that was cool like having a place to go to, to, to experience Star Wars and that felt like new and different from whatever media I had access to at home.
 And at that time the only before the other iterations the ride opened or any other themes,  Star Wars experiences like the only place where you could, you're in the world and you're, you're hearing the music and you're totally engrossed in and everything.
 And yeah, and I remember it like I had like a Star Tours poster in my room and one of those plush wickets I don't know if you guys remember those  I feel like from Disney.
 Yeah, they've read like they've had them again.
 Yeah, I don't know if they're making them currently but they were doing a whole line of the different walks, so you could get like pretty deep into the walk characters which is many characters I know, I don't remember a lot of these characters.
  That's a relief.
 Yeah, so that's why I didn't want me to go down a list of 10 he wants pod racers though I can do that, but we're not talking about pod racers like named like they there's it's like easier to know the names of the pod racers oh I disagree.
  Oh, really? Oh, it's not.
 They're all like, oh, actually, well they are named but I'm just, oh no they're not named in the movie you have to like, oh, that is a deeper dive.
  I don't know if you ever saw the ESPN graphics or whatever.
 No, no, I don't think so.
 As you'll find from that I don't know the films that well.
 The prequels.
 This will keep any of them in a way.
  I mean I know that I don't know I know it all but not.
 You were never an obsessive of us because I was absolutely an obsessed Star Wars kid.
 At no point in my life was I totally obsessed.
  Oh, for sure.
 Yeah, I was the perfect age for the special edition villain here again.
 Yeah, the special editions and the action because they did start Star Wars, and I think this around the same time like 90s.
  I think that a bit 96 97 special editions.
 Yeah, 97 anything yeah I think that's Transformers I remember to they started to bring back around.
 Yeah, like in 94 95 all these things kind of started to come back and always.
 Yeah, it was it was for a kid at that it was an embarrassment of riches between X men and power rangers and Star Wars and transform like all like one it was action figures.
  Yeah, Batman as well.
 Yeah, and that's the only things will ever get again.
  Those series of ideas.
  That'll be it forever.
 Yeah, there's always new.
 Yeah.
  Which is fine.
  Yeah, and I suppose that maybe it doesn't matter but like eBay didn't exist so you couldn't access any of that merchandise right away.
 Yeah.
  But yeah so that was very cool to me about it.
 And I think like just as a young child.
  It really, I don't know it opened my imagination in terms of like, I thought it was a cool play on the whole thing like it's just like, oh yeah this is like going to the airport.
  And like the conceptually I just I thought it was like super fascinating even as a kid and and and it kind of like expanded the universe because it's like oh yeah it's not.
  It can be more than just the movies like take a trip to Hoth and go skiing.
  It is like corners of this universe that there's enough there that yeah here's this little outpost for some odd things happening and there's something, though the ride culminates in blowing up the Death Star, the idea that like, we're not doing the stuff in the movie where it's not where it's not repeating all the events of it we're experiencing a new story that is like, in some ways very tangentially really especially when it when it was Rex and not see three PO.
  It's even a character you don't know it's like it's we were during the live show with Tony Baxter I asked him about Big Thunder when I was noticing like there's no human robots on the ride it's just animals, and it does give you a different feeling when you don't see something familiar another human.
  So it's in a similar way on the first Star Tours, where like you don't see a bunch of aliens that you know you're not running into Han you're it's like you're out here in the middle of it with this new robot that if you see your first time you've never met him before, and like you're going on this own adventure yourself so it's not like the new Star Tours where it's full of care like it's that's full of characters and alien races.
  So like it's a whole different kind of feeling.
 Also, in addition to that.
 Well, and there's no moment like in the, you know, in something like the Spider-Man ride, where the villains have taken over, but then you're like lost in the streets but then Spider-Man shows up.
  Oh, few he will get us right.
 Exactly.
 There's never that in original Star Tours some X-Wing guy shows up but you don't know him either.
 You know the general idea of the X-Wings will help you.
 Star Tours, what are you doing here?  I don't want to jump around too much but I love like in all of the Scott sent me some videos of like the ceremonies and stuff like anytime you see one of these X-Wing fighters I feel, pilots rather, feel like they all have like a dark mustache basically.
  Yeah.
  Oh, yeah.
  It's the only like face real estate they have to differentiate themselves.
 Yeah, that's and it really puts it in, in the in the 70s, which is a strange thing about Star Wars in general that went since there since summer made in the 70s and summer made in the 2000s  and summer now, but like undeniably in the middle there is a big run where it feels very 80s, and you have to reconcile that with the prequels and the end seven through nine, you really got to go what happened well why is it not like the 80s anymore.
  Right.
  Which is obviously it's where it's where they lose me.
  Well, and now with with a recreating people's faces for like Rogue One and stuff so you can fully recreate like 70s and 80s English character actors, as long as you have to get a couple stashes in there, I'll be, I'll be fine I was psyched for that when I saw my boy grandma  I was, I was okay with it.
 I wasn't psyched though.
 I mean I just like that old British like all the old be a Peter Cushing all the old British character actors show up in Star Wars, I like, I found the Carrie Fisher one a little more unnerving.
  Yeah, no that's weird.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
  Do you find it unnerving in Star Tour in.
 Sorry to get into some adventures continue the rules but is it we she was she had not passed by then, but on some by the time you're seeing her hologram but are you on some level weirded out that it's a digital Carrie Fisher,  because it's so small you don't notice the, like the effects and canny valley or whatever I'm used to seeing projected Princess Leia because of new hope, so that one less.
  Yeah, I don't know zoomed in on her face it might be weird, but they're not going to do that if you had to do all seen with her, or if she was in the little thing like the little box that pops up with it's usually reserved for like po dameron or whatever then maybe that would be weird.
  I was laughing the first time I saw Maz Kanata in her little jetpack show up that one I don't know if I like it or not in the new one but I was like you do like it I kind of liked it just because I was like oh it's easier.
  No, no, no you start to talk to you gotta go back.
 Yeah, let's go let's go back one more Maz Kanata.
 So I think one big thing for me on this traction that is like a big plus in its book is Rex is an original character.
  I was thinking about like you had said at the live I think you said it on stage we were talking about at least beforehand, asking Tony like, why do I like Big Thunder so much, and I was trying to figure out like why do I find, I find Rex so endearing.
  Well it is the spirit of his like character rides like figment and Rex both have like this very endearing like childish, and you get them right away.
 You understand who they are.
 Maybe I was thinking about this too and maybe I like Rex a lot because he's, he's nervous, and he's not super confident.
  And it's the first time I got on the ride I'm scared to go on the ride as I am on any ride, but that's he's like a conduit to let me know that that's that's okay is another nervous person who's who I who I can relate to.
  Yeah, that might be right that makes sense.
 And also his claws are cool, and his head is cool, and he's got that weird round mouth and his neck goes up and down, and he's, he's the best.
  He's got great design.
 He really is the multiple arm here look I brought toys, I have toys with.
 It's one of the only things I have toys.
 Do you have the park stars one of him, I don't have a star.
 I do.
 It looks really good.
  There's there's here's my full toy array well there that's coming out first the star speeder.
 Yeah, this, I bought this, that's got to be about what $300,000 I think so, gallery, I'm cleaning up.
  I got a range of decent split so I get some, but the, this is, I got this in France because they still, I got to go in France when original starters was still going.
 Let me play some.
 Oh, so you heard Luke him him.
  Yes, yes so correct I know I know about the dog now yeah yeah yeah when it opened up, and he said Bonjour.
  You know is the only one left.
 Yeah, but but you're in France and you get to hear the fridge.
 Let me play some sound effects.
 No that's doors.
  That's cool.
 He's sick.
  That's just that's functional.
  Yeah.
  We got an R2.
 Oh, great.
 Yeah, and then the doors open and there is a little Rex inside.
  You can take a look at that yeah yeah seeing the actual, the actual seed arrangements recognizing.
 Now I don't look at the, the image, the, the front window that we as an audience would be looking at that doesn't seem to be anything that we ever see.
  No, yeah that is like that's well it's a diagram of the ship.
 Yeah, that's true.
 Maybe that's something that Rex has to monitor before the flight but give sure sure sure internal that safe mode they booted up the star speeder 3000 and safe mode and then  you say, it's a screen saver.
  Please give it to me.
  Yeah, this is right in your wheelhouse Mike yeah this is like very interesting to see Scott.
  I don't own.
 Yeah, well because it's the only thing I like this much.
  It is so funny that like you like Star Tours more than you like Star Wars any of the movies I really do and it Star Tours came first to me, because I probably went on the first time in like 93 94, and the movies were not re released until 97 and my parents were not super into them.
  And in fact my dad, a couple years ago asked me to explain, he, how did he phrase it he said, Star Wars what's going on in that like I don't know the story who are they, who is the war with.
  Is it like the are the are the aliens fighting the people.
  It's kind of a fair question.
 Uh huh.
 Well, is it.
  The Empire.
  I think he thought he, my dad thinks that like, Hon Luke Leia are against C3PO and elevator, like anyone in masks right right anyone made of plastic.
  I think he made all the stranger by the fact that my dad is like a is a family friend of john Williams was like known him on and off for a while, which I really wanted to I they don't see each other super often but I said the next time you see him you  can ask john Williams.
 What is Star Wars, just to see what does he laugh at that or is he like can we change the subject or do you get like a beautiful eloquent simple distillation of what is Star Wars and I can say john Williams would not be a bad guess for your  podcast.
  That's true.
  Is he a parks fan.
  Like, I just mean I don't want to ask your dad.
  It might be, it might be a chore when he's gonna do these things.
  I always wondered you know when someone of that cat like john will like, there were so few people at his level and he's such a lifer and had such effect on film.
 Like what is.
  What do they like like what do they like for entertainment, like what do they want to know is john Williams, because my dad just asks any music.
 My dad is with john Williams doesn't know anything about Star Wars so instead he's like, so what, what about the beach  boys what do you think of those guys.
 He's like, for out for no reason it's just the only music thing my dad can think to ask and he john Williams just said oh I don't go in for any of the rock stuff.
  Oh, and his son has been the singer of Toto on and off for a very long time.
 And apparently he's like I don't get what he does anymore.
 He couldn't compose a score and I couldn't do a rock song like wow I think just doesn't have like.
  Yeah, so I think so he's like a piece pure classical music is the from what I can tell.
  So they have an understanding.
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, like the idea of john Williams talking about his son like yeah he's doing the on and off Toto thing.
  Why don't you get it comes back in one piece of a hobby that he's got.
  Where was the judge and when we were talking about ways and then I mentioned Luke Hamit I don't really know how to say it really.
  Dubs the voice of Rex in French, and in Japanese, it's an actor it was an actor named UG Mitsuya.
 Okay, both of them dubbed Michael J Fox in their respective languages translations of Back to the Future, both Japan and France.
  Yeah, well,  Mitsuya and Hamit did Michael J Fox and I think yeah at least in the Japanese one it says Back to the Future I think in the French, the French actor did a lot of Michael J Fox's stuff.
  Yeah, yeah, yeah, he's him and like everything from Family Ties to Atlantis.
 Yeah, and apparently the French translation of Family Ties is Sacred Family, which really makes it heavier, but maybe that's that's something to the like, that's some shared DNA like Marty is a guy who's not supposed to be there.
  Yeah, and Bex if he's not a super confident pilot or captain or any character kids like.
 I love Marty.
 We all liked Marty right? Loved.
 Yeah, of course.
 I'll say love.
  Now how I'm curious how aware were you guys when seeing Rex in action, who Paul Rubens was or what did that mean anything to you?  I knew Paul Rubens was I was a huge peewee fan but I did not know for many years past I did not know it was him until years later.
 Oh really? I was a big peewee fan too just watching I don't think I really had any I don't remember peewee toys that I think I have tons of peewee toys.
  I think that was another one I caught the tail end of.
 I have vivid memories of going into department stores and finding like a little cherry and finding all everybody.
 Whoa.
 Yeah, I have all of it still in my parents basement.
 I'll bring it out.
 I'll bring it out.
 I have a chair I have cherry.
  We learning peewee that Paul Rubens was peewee and Rex I think was like a thing I would have learned in like elementary school or middle school when I started to like piece together again what MGM studios die of like telling you how this is made and the people behind all this stuff.
  I thought like that was a really cool trivia thing.
 Were you aware of that when you when you went? I think so.
 Yeah.
  Yes, I feel like I came to an age you know every every boy has a moment where they learn that Rex is voiced by Paul Rubin right?  Father sits him down.
 It's important to tell you it's it is when you when you do realize that well a couple things one it is like it's it's it's remarkable how much it is a different character though they're not worlds apart but it's for sure like a till you don't hear that and then go oh yeah he's just doing peewee.
  It's for you hear little similarities and laugh for and everything but it's definitely a different character and also like I think it kind of blew up my brain as a kid in general like wrapping your head around he wait he's not peewee peewee is not a guy a real person.
  He's a character and that actor can do other things and it really made it so when he when Paul Rubin showed up in anything else you see you like it was so striking right absolutely his non peewee because like homography is so he would appear in things that a human actor would appear he would like you letterman or something like that he hosted Saturday Night Live he did a full I don't think he ever like put a he didn't like put on different clothes over the right or a white.
  I think it was just peewee and every sketch but like yeah that made it so confusing that how can he be different people but he's so great in Batman Returns and later blow and that's one Elton John video he's good.
  Yeah, I'm like is that the same video right with Timberlake yeah yeah I get this train don't stop yeah or something I believe that the Robert Downey Jr.
 was the first video that you want first Robert Downey Jr.
 lip dub this train don't stop here anymore as Paul Rubin's in Timberlake.
  I figured out he's a mystery man too remember that was his comeback after the year.
 I remember Buffy the vampire slayer the film yeah yeah he looks really scary in that.
 Which was like the first movie I saw I think that like I remember coming off of the incident.
  Uh huh yeah was it released after and they had to like downplay I couldn't tell I mean like in my as a child I remember I don't know when that movie came out but I think it maybe I think it was like the first kind of post peewee thing I feel like mystery man was like they're like this is his comeback fall from grace.
  That was 98 though wasn't it yeah and wasn't the incident a few years prior.
 The incident which in our modern world was much earlier.
 Which is kind of harmless.
 This seems not harmless but seems a lot more low stakes in 2018 I'd call it.
  Yes yeah I it's funny though that I was I was thinking about the incident and how he he he danced around it perfectly for us good boys but the that there was a time where Tomorrowland was running that you had Paul Rubin's in Star Tours and then a few doors away Michael Jackson in a bad Michael Jackson era.
  I remember how like uncomfortable it felt having EO open when he was in in a bad way right right there was a little like 95 yeah I don't I don't know that I like clocked it I might have like been to the park but not even gone to that sector.
  Yeah, yeah yeah well it's easy to avoid and like EO was like prob regardless of that probably on the decline to some extent right I remember when Michael Jackson my parents have been a really dancer it like me figure me asking questions about Michael Jackson and why does he look that way and what's going on.
  What did the news say about him and I remember being a real like problem for my parents like I remember them murmuring about like how do we tell him because I worshiped I love Michael Jackson that's a credit that must be a priority for any parent having to like you probably are so mad at the celebrity or whoever it is for like God damn it now I have to figure out how to frame this to my kid.
  Oh God.
 Yeah, yeah, I mean it's easier now when all the kids like favorite youtubers are like psychopaths or sex perverts like they hit 1415 and they're just crazy.
  So the kids know already what the kids know already tell me that the youtuber who does blackface is not an okay person.
  Tell me why won't ninja stream fortnight with women gamer.
  That's where the real young ones in the crowd.
 I'm glad I barely get that.
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know if I recognize what twitch you said I know what that is and I know what fortnight is it's a video game.
  Oh okay ninja is like the most popular game streamer.
 Oh, he has they were selling a man.
 Yeah, a sexist man.
 Well, he's what he's dancing around he's like well I got a wife and I just don't want to confuse things but like he did it really weird weird.
  He doesn't want to put he doesn't want to have female gamers guest on his stream because you know that could get a pencil rolls.
 It does sound it's very similar but like on the boardwalk in Jersey this summer I was like, are they so fucking ninja t shirts like with his logo on it next to like the Avengers t shirts.
  It's very weird.
 Strange.
 Now Disney don't do a 3d movie with it don't do a 3d movie ninja, but do keep working on the Jake and Logan Paul.
  Any of those as well as the ticket.
  We have we fully covered.
  We have Rex I mean we can go back what what because I, you know, this is such a rare area I have here to talk about Rex it's great and tease it was there's a couple other things this year only late this.
 These aren't on the ride things.
  I told you a couple years ago I think at this point I texted you and I said Rex is going to be on Star Wars rebels.
 Yeah, you were very excited.
 Yeah, to watch, and it was the world's biggest let down that was off.
  This guy.
 No, I don't.
 He was on a there was a cartoon a star a Star Wars animated series and and Rex was going to be on it they teased it voice by Paul Rubin's when we say teaser we talking like online commercials are like just a blog.
  It was maybe just a still in Rex is coming back.
 Yeah, it was like YouTube ad that highlighted it or something that was like featuring Rex and then like all the theme park blogs picked up on it.
  And it was a big deal and a trick Scott into watching it but live maybe.
  I read the schedule for it major event yeah yeah yeah cancel plans missed my mom's birthday.
  Here's, I wrote down one of Rex's classic quotes from Star Wars rebels.
 We are approaching Garell, please prepare for landing.
  I'm not sure if that's a line about like protocol.
 He has four lines it's the boring as shit I've ever seen I'm still mad about it was it was it Paul Rubin's, it was Paul Rubin's but he didn't sound like Rex.
  I felt like they, I don't blame him for not sure if you're clued into his own character like if I were, that was probably one or two sessions, decades ago, right, if I were doing the thing I would make sure he heard a tape so he knew how to conjure it up but I  think it was real lazy all around.
 I hated this thing.
 I, and I, you know what I am experiencing when I think about Rex on Star Wars rebels is, this must be how you feel all the time, seeing Star Wars characters not seeing your favorite Star Wars characters  not treated the way that you want.
 This is the only thing where I have the Star Wars rage, and luckily it's interesting 50 seconds of a TV show.
 It's not my whole life like with me.
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, I mean I still get, I'm still worked up about it but, you know, but if yes if if  Rex showed up in the sequels and I didn't like how he was utilized or if he was like killed or something.
 Fortunately I feel great because my favorite Star Wars character are those are the dice Han Solo's famous.
  You called the dice characters.
 I think the dice are kind of a character.
 Okay, well don't worry the dice have a lot of screen time in the last few movies.
 Are they in, I didn't see Solo, I hear they're in Solo.
 Oh they're in there.
  I'm sure they're in solo.
 It is possible though that, because I've heard you guys have spoken, or talked about a Rex coming back to the new Star Wars.
 Yes, a Rex so when I was, we're gonna say that I could imagine that could possibly make you nervous because that implies  a serious voice direction I would think.
 Oh yeah that's true.
 Are they doing, I don't think it's been confirmed if Paul Rubens is part of it.
 I would have to imagine that would be, he's still around.
 DJs don't always talk, he might be a silent DJ.
  Yeah, I know they haven't confirmed the details of it.
 When I first learned of it, and this is another situation where I texted I think maybe you will, for sure texted you, probably texted you as well though.
  But it might have been separate, it might have been not on the podcast yet so I think I texted you and you separately about this.
 Can you even remember this world?  Yeah it doesn't feel real.
 I was at D23, I was in the presentation for Star Wars Land and one of the first things they said was like, you know an old favorite is gonna come back to Star Wars Land, and that buddy's got a new job and then they put out on screen it was Rex and he was DJing, and the place went insane.
 The ovation that received like rivaled the whole land being announced.
  And then this, like, 5,000 nerds cheering Rex.
 I wonder if like Disney people ever like, have we fucked up everything? We should have just been exploiting this character, we built this entire land.
  Who would think? I hope so.
 Every time they mention like a figment or a Rex or something, yeah those big gatherings, those big fan gatherings, people lose their minds.
  Now that's there, now I could see a regular person going to Star Wars Land and not knowing what the hell's going on.
 Hey the DJ's stupid!  Watch me DJing! Watch me throw blue milk at him! Play Despacito idiot!  I do think there might be like a Sonny Eclipse situation though.
 I think so.
 Where you just eat and you can like sit right by him and eat fucking stuff.
 I think it's a little show man.
 Now again, I will adopt your habits and I will, that I will wait hours to get the Rex and Jason booth.
  Cause then we can spend more time with Rex as long as he's in character and voiced by Paul Rubens and we feel that they're doing him like right by our memory of him.
  Is now we can spend hours with Rex.
 We don't have to just spend three minutes with him in the Star Wars Theater.
 There's no door that goes up.
 I can stay there from getting a date and close.
  I think he's gotta be too like learning on his feet like he was in Star Trek.
 I feel like he's gotta be a Soundcloud DJ just learning it.
 He can't be like a Steve Aoki, Avicii, God rest his soul superstar DJ.
  And he can't be like a rich kid vanity project DJ.
 I think that the guy, whoever was on stage, it might have been Bob Chapek, head of parks and resorts at the time.
 He might have announced that like Rex, you know, he might not be so good at DJing.
  Yeah, I think that's the spirit.
 I think they teased that like, you know, he's not, he's a little in over his head.
 He's got a good heart and he's trying his best.
 Exactly.
 And that's probably what makes him so endearing.
  Have you guys ever thought about the fate of Rex after this failed trip to Endor? Well, oh yeah, did he get fired? He's gotta have been fired.
 Like he has to have been fired.
  I, I, I, this is, I want to stay on this, but like I did a little research about the droids in the queue, these G2.
 Yeah, the G2.
  But like they're also shitty at their jobs.
 It seems like so like Star Tours might just generally be a shitty company.
 I have a big, I have official, what seems to be Canon information about this.
  According to the Star Wars encyclopedia, and I don't know what that is and how much weight it carries, but RX-24's flight during the Star Tours ride, quote, proved something of a harbinger for the future of the Star Tours travel agency.
  Within months of the Battle of Endor, accidents and poor management drove the company to go out of business.
 Wow.
 So yeah, they were only, what we experienced in that ride was dead and gone three months later.
  So like we were essentially on like the mega bus.
 The Star Tours universe.
 That's fun.
 So that means that like this DJing gig is like, is like next thing.
 Yeah.
  He needs it.
 And he's like an Uber driver who also is a DJ.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 He totally like took some time to find himself, maybe got a little severance and maybe doing some odd jobs for a few years.
  I don't know about that severance.
 I don't think the unions are strong in space, Jason.
 Yeah, that's true.
  In thinking about a full Star Tours universe film or something, if you could see what happens to him right after him being chewed out by some, or is it, wait, would C-3PO or maybe C-3PO and R2-D2 kind of good cop, bad cop.
  Right.
 Rex and C-3PO understands because he's also kind of bumbly, but R2-D2 blurbles and C-3PO is like fired.
 Isn't that a little harsh?  That's a good point because it is R2-D2 who puts in the navigation to like light speed to end or R2 and then, and they overshoot it.
 That's not Rex's fault.
 That's R2's calculations.
  Good point.
 And everything from there, Rex is trying his best to.
 Yeah.
 Also, so maybe this is obvious to everybody, but does Admiral Ackbar work at Star Tours?  Yes, so that was what I was going to say.
 He's up in the.
.
.
 He's up in the crew stuff.
 That's what he's doing now.
  Well, R2-D2, they're all heroes of the rebellion and they've all taken a traveling agency job.
 That's true.
 Like real veterans.
  That's right.
 This is a.
.
.
 It's really a riot about veterans affairs.
 Finding your place in the world.
 Yeah.
  There are two.
.
.
 I was just.
.
.
 I was on the new Star Tours two days ago.
 There's two Mon Calamari, which are the name.
.
.
 It's the name of the alien race.
  Admiral Ackbar.
 Okay.
 And yeah, there are two of them up there.
 So they still work there? So they still work there now.
  But, oh wait, but the new.
.
.
 But Adventures Continue is a prequel.
 Are you aware of that? I think I did know that.
 But then.
.
.
  But it still doesn't make sense because they go.
.
.
 They have like Last Jedi, right? Yes, exactly.
 So Forced Awakens and Last Jedi pop in.
  So the whole timeline is full.
 Yeah, the timeline's a mess.
 But so either way, but then.
.
.
 So that's a job he got, but then he got recruited again in Forced Awakens.
  There was no younger Mon Calamari that could take his job.
 But then he gets.
.
.
 I guess he'll never work in Star Tours again.
  Then he gets blown up in the Last Jedi.
 Boy, bummer.
 So how long did Star Tours exist for some amount of time?  That means.
.
.
 Because we're talking Phantom Menace era to post-Return of the Jedi.
 Is that accurate?  Yes.
 And up until.
.
.
 Probably at least until Forced Awakens.
 I don't know how.
.
.
 Oh wait, maybe not because if in a couple months it fell apart.
.
.
  Yeah, I guess not.
 So yeah, that's still a decades long run and it's straddled multiple generations.
  Like in all of Anakin Skywalker's lifetime Star Tours was a travel option.
 Because there are pod races on the new one.
  Yeah.
 So then it makes it to.
.
.
 Phantom Menace to Sith is like what? 15 years?  I don't know.
 It's probably Phantom Menace is like 15 years I think.
 And then it's like 30 years from the end of Sith to New Hope.
  How old is Luke supposed to be? Like 22 or something? 20? Yeah.
  Now did Star Tours deliver Jefferson Starship to the concert venue where they perform like the Sky on Fire in the Holiday Special?  Which also, my Star Wars canon is number one Star Tours, number two Holiday Special, number three all that other stuff.
  Number three.
.
.
 I mean like that.
.
.
 Sorry, go ahead.
  Number three Return of the Jedi because it has the song that John Williamson did, the rock song Lapty Neck.
 And then the rest of it.
  Which they cut out for the special edition.
 I think that begs the question to me, which may we're going too far out, is there would likely be competing travel space companies.
  Right, it's true.
 Yeah.
 That'd be a fun Easter egg.
 One of those could be called Star Ride.
  Which is what Michael Eisner famously went to call Star Tour Star Ride and George Lucas was the deciding vote of like, no we like Tony's Star Tours better.
  Star Ride.
 Because he thought people wouldn't understand that it was a ride.
  The DJ's stupid.
  Star Tour? Sounds boring.
 Skip.
  Also, did you guys, I didn't know this until last night, do you guys know the other name that was floated around?  No.
 This apparently came according to some, well according to Jim Hill, which I don't, you know, you never know with his information.
  But, past the Fallon of Sidon.
 We're keeping the feud going.
  But there's other sources that say, somewhere, possibly Lucas, somewhere proposed that this ride be called Cosmic Winds.
  Really? Yeah.
  That is a very 80s Disney name, I feel like.
 Cosmic Winds.
  That would have been some, was pitched for Epcot.
  That would have been some, was pitched for Epcot.
  I love the name, but it doesn't make any sense.
  And if that were like an 80s smooth jazz record that I had, I would dig that and listen all the time.
 If it was a Dave Gruessen album, I'm in.
  But yeah, as this ride.
 But that, I think the, if we were all to pitch on a Star Tours movie, then I think the competing travel agency is Cosmic Winds.
  It is funny you keep mentioning like a Star Tours movie because like oftentimes, just in conversation, you're like, I want to make my own stuff in Hollywood.
  I want to do this.
 And then I'll be like, well, what about a Star Tours movie?  You're like, of course.
 The only property.
  I do a TV show.
 Whatever.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Go in on.
 Yeah.
  I gotta say, and I don't know how much I can say, I have a friend who pitched a Star Tours movie.
  What? Oh yeah.
 Well, be careful with details.
 But what can you say?  I think I can say this.
 It didn't work out.
 Okay.
  And maybe, man, I hope, I don't know if I'm, I heard that Disney kind of owns all Star Wars stuff.
  They don't want to do funny stuff.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
  I guess that's maybe true with like what you hear about Solo or something like that.
  For sure.
 I know that there's this entire comedy, the detour show with like, well, yeah, they rejected an entire, but there's a thing where like,  am I legally allowed to say there's a thing where Bugmane is Han Solo?  That an entire produced series and say somebody send me a letter if I'm not allowed to say this, but this is sitting in a can.
  This was made.
 Is this the sketch?  This was the one that, because they, that did not make it to air or did.
 It was a YouTube thing.
  People we knew were working on it for weeks.
 I wrote about this.
 There's this thing.
  And then there's a stupid buddies.
 The stop motion.
 Yeah.
 It was all done.
 And then they just, this is all because this is all in the process before Disney bought Lucasfilm.
  So like they were like very open and doing weird stuff.
 Because they were close to doing a TV show.
  Lucas always said he wanted to do like.
 That wasn't related to, I'm saying this is specifically was just that Disney had another like idea for the whole thing.
  I'm stay.
 The reason they didn't do that TV show is too expensive.
 They had it like 50 scripts written or something crazy.
 Oh, gotcha.
  I'm just saying the pre Disney purchase, there was like interesting stuff going on in Star Wars that we will maybe never see or only see drips and traps.
  There was also, in addition to all of this stuff that never came out is like Disney, I believe made the like proclamation that there will be no like cutesy like goofy as Darth Vader toys anymore.
  So they stopped all that stuff because that was everywhere in tomorrowland.
 I have Luigi and Giuseppe from Cars as R2D2 and C3PO.
  Yes, there was a lot of mash up there with the Muppets Star Wars where they were dressed up as the Star Wars characters.
 I feel like those were big hits.
  I feel like those were big money.
 Also, it would feel like it would go the opposite.
  You know what I mean? Like with Disney acquiring, one would assume that they would like I take advantage of their professionally with like the stuff, the clips and screen grabs coming out from Wreck-It Ralph 2 with like the portal, the Marvel portal next to the Lucasfilm.
  Go.
com.
 Yeah, and next to them, Disney Princess.
 The Disney Princesses all hanging out taking selfies.
  I saw that clip at D23 last year and when that happens on screen, they showed that in the portals or whatever and the audience was like, I don't know about this.
  It feels a little unnerving.
 It feels a little Blade Runner-y like the bad way.
  The Princesses came on and everyone loved that again.
 I will say, I think I've said it before, everyone was rabid the whole thing, the whole time and then they showed Nutcracker and the Four Realms and it was just silent there.
  Oh, but I was following the live tweets and I was hooting and hollering.
 I can't wait to see all four of the realms.
  Which we'll do a series of videos.
  But my feeling is like if Solo doesn't help prove this, like cooling it with the brand because like, okay, look, this is not going to be the populist opinion, but that holiday special is such a blast to watch.
  It's not that things should be like that, but I do miss things where like C-3PO's run around with Eddie Murphy or something or isn't like, are they on the like, what's that Earth Day special?  That's your pitch right there.
  I'll say action and cut and he can edit it.
  Aren't they, are C-3PO and RTD2 in that Earth Day special that everyone is in?  I don't know.
  Like ET is in it and Ghostbuster and.
.
.
  Oh, you're talking, not cartoon all-stars to the rest of the world.
  No, not that, the live, there's like a, there's a thing where like it's, you know, Murphy Brown and a Ghostbuster and ET and Doc Brown, like everybody's in there.
  Lucy Goosey then.
 Nowadays the contracts.
  I love everything like that where all the characters meet willy-nilly.
 You don't have to care about the continuity.
  I did, something bothers me about Adventures Continue straddling prequel and sequel, but also who cares? Get them all in there.
 Darth Vader's in there.
 It's fun.
 Like who, I think everyone needs to chill the fuck out about all this IP stuff.
  I agree.
 I think that Disney though, when they bought Lucasfilm, they were, they made a lot of conservative decisions and they were worried that like things would be silly or prequels were silly or people didn't like them.
  Even though the prequels made a ton of money, all three of them.
  So I think they got very nervous about, because there's no prequel characters, barely any prequel characters in those movies and people would go nuts.
  I mean, people liked Spoiler Alert, Darth Maul showing up in a solo, but that's about it.
  So I feel like, you know, they, they have to, you're right, lighten up.
 Let's have some fun.
 Yeah.
  Let's see some of our favorite comedians with C-3PO.
  I think I saw that clip of the, from, I think one of the videos you sent, which I had seen before, which was like the Star Tours TV special, basically.
  Yeah.
 I mean, I think like scene C-3PO rap is like an example of something that.
.
.
  Who wouldn't love this? You're out of your mind.
 Let me play it for, I can't not play it.
  The concept? Almost doesn't sound like Anthony Daniels.
  Well now, okay.
 See now I'm having logic issues because C-3PO is performing a rap that would have been performed like by the Fat Boys, like circa 1983 or something like that.
  So now we're like, is the contemporary music of where in which C-3PO and R2D2 are existing is like old school hip hop just beginning?  Is it advanced? All similar music trends were starting to bubble up in whenever Star Wars is set and then it all got, their civilization got wiped out, right?  Star Wars is all gone.
 It's a long time ago.
  So we just parallel formed the same ideas, but also this special exists in a continuity where the stars of a forgotten sitcom called Sidekicks walk up and say, I think the kid says, or no, the old guy says, C-3PO.
  He mispronounced C-3PO.
 Good to meet you.
 His name is Michael Eisner when he's like the opening ceremony of Star Tours.
  C-3PO? C-3PO? Oh, the opening ceremony.
  I got a lot on there.
 Everyone wants the opening ceremony.
 Oh boy.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Well, let's hear.
 We still haven't talked about the ride, but let's keep going over here.
 One of the things that I love about Star Tours so much, there's so much ancillary content.
  There's the special where the people from Sidekicks show up, whatever that is.
 It's the kid's name is Ernie Reyes Jr.
 who plays Keno years later.
 Also, Steve Ninjas.
  Oh yeah, that's right.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Great in all those movies.
 And so that's a great special.
 You get to hear that full wrap.
 And then two big opening ceremonies in 87 before the ride opens.
  The night before, there's something called the Interplanetary Launch Preview Party.
 And that's at night.
 And it's mainly about Mickey meeting C-3PO and welcoming him into the Disney family.
  I gotta say, this was awkward.
  Oh, I thought they got along great.
  That's Bud's right away.
 Now this is Mickey with the like rainbow.
 Yeah.
 His gear is tight.
 For sure.
 Yeah.
 It's so good.
 When all the characters are in the space suits and it's kind of EOS, that is the time.
 And then he greets him and then there's a Yamaha mashup of the Star Wars theme into  When You Wish Upon a Star and all the characters like march around to it and they all are also are in the space suits.
 So this is the finest live performance that had ever occurred until the next morning when the ribbon cutting happened.
  And Jason, what would you like to say about the ribbon cutting?  The ribbon cutting.
 Okay.
 So one of the few appearances of what the parks are called in parks face characters.
 So like Luke and Leia and Han Solo are there.
 Chewy is also there.
 R2-D2-C-3PO show up later.
  None of the face characters talk.
 They do a very elaborate choreographed like ballet sequence.
 Yeah.
 Han and Leia do ballet.
  Some hiding, some laser blasting.
 Han's gun.
 Han's blaster is not Han's blaster.
 It looks like they just grabbed it from a gift shop right before.
 They're like, oh shoot, we got to give him a gun.
  All of these opening ceremonies, all these feel like they forgot to plan what it was until the night before.
  They worked on this ride.
 Like everyone's just like getting it like working on it down to the wire and they're like, oh shit, we got to do something tomorrow.
  Half of the sound effects sound right and the other half sound totally wrong.
 Like no lightsabers, right? No.
 Well, Michael Eisner has one.
 But it looks like a clear baseball bat.
 It's not glowing.
 It's not colored.
 And then he just has to hold it for like a minute.
  Well, cause Mickey comes out after the interpretive dance and then Darth Vader doesn't perish but is chased away by fire.
 He's scared of fire like a bear.
 And then he runs off and C-3PO comes out and he and R2-D2 are supposed to give Michael, Master Michael.
  Master George, Master Michael.
 He hands him, he's supposed to hand him scissors but R2-D2 lost the scissors much like Hooter losing the map.
 And then Mickey comes out to solve this.
  But he doesn't have scissors.
 He like very gingerly marches downstairs from the people mover track and you really feel for the guy in the Mickey suit or whoever it is.
 And then comes out and says, like, it's like, like not to worry C-3PO.
 It's under control.
  And that is not Mickey's foot.
 That Mickey voice is fucked up.
 Oh yeah.
 It's a really odd Mickey voice.
 And I bring it up for another reason which is there in all of these, in all the many bizarre specials that exist.
 There's a moment that my wife and I are super fond of where you get a tour of Mickey's house in Disney World.
 Oh yeah.
  And he's in Mickey's birthday land and his house is not like a fun cartoon house.
 It just has like an office.
 And there's that say clearly that same Mickey voice that says this great quote.
 When I want to make a call, I use the den.
  It cuts to just like my dad's den.
 It just has a regular phone, not a fun cartoon phone, just files.
 He has like leather bound books.
 How much? Why did we have so many long distance charges last month? Are you talking to Richard again, Mickey? You say you were in contact.
 I'm going to call the phone company.
 I'll use the den.
  I'll isolate this moment and put it somewhere.
 It's so good.
 I mean the best Mickey line in this though.
 I have it.
 About having to wait.
 We'll just hold this pose for a bit while you photographers get your pictures.
 Oh yeah.
 And everyone is just standing rock like still.
  This is very still on stage for the assembled press.
 Eisner with this bizarre clear lightsaber, which by the way, Mickey saves the day quote unquote, but he does so by him going back to Minnie goes and gets the sword and then hands it to Mickey who hands it to Eisner.
 So Mickey is just a middleman in this scenario.
  I was also a little bothered by seeing our heroes in their new hope gear hanging out with Ewoks.
 Yeah, that's right.
 They had stopped dressing like that.
 Oh, and and looked at two.
 Well, and then after they finished their number and they run off and the Moss Eisley Cantina band, a bunch of other aliens and Rogue Squadron shows up and it appears it appears they get hammered on stage.
  George Lucas and Michael Eisner come out.
 They're just hanging out drinking like dry ice.
 Yeah, booze drinks.
 Not really saying anything.
 The Moss Eisley Cantina band is playing their famous song.
 Is this the only time other than Club 33 where alcohol was consumed in Disneyland?  I mean, who knows the chemical makeup of those space beverages? Good point.
 And then Han and Greedo were both there together.
 Yeah, right.
 And they shot at the same time.
 It was all wrong.
 Oh, disaster.
  Well, Eisner, yeah.
 How does Michael Eisner say C3PO? He greets them in a very funny way.
 He says, Hi there, C3PO.
 Nice to see you.
 And R2D2.
 Like, he's greeting like a mid-level executive like coming to pitch him something.
  Good to meet you.
 I'm the Redstone.
 Nice to see you.
 And then he stumbles and calls him Threes.
 That's what I have written down.
 We've I'm fine talking about this ceremony more than the ride itself.
 If you're listening to this, you know the ride, but you might not know the ceremony.
  I just take such delight in how uncomfortable George is.
 Yeah, like in everything.
 Existing on stage.
 I mean, he's always that's always funny.
 But like on stage in front of everyone, like he knows it's wrong too.
 Like he might not have even had oversight on this whole thing.
  Well, he just witnessed Darth Vader really grab Leia.
 Like really, really too aggressively.
 Or do we know this is a side note, but do we know where there ever those those characters ever walk around in the first few years? I have no I don't think so.
  Not that I've seen.
 Just Stormtroopers probably.
 Kind of odd that in general there's no presence of Luke, Leia, Han.
 Still, right? Are they ever?  Well, they have Rey now.
 Chewie.
 You can be Chewie, Rey, Kylo Ren, and Darth Vader and then start Stormtroopers are walking around.
 Oh, and in Florida.
 They have more characters.
 They have Captain Phasma in Hollywood Studios.
  Oh good.
 And they have some other like maybe like Cartoon.
 What's there's one Jedi female character.
 I kind of remember her name.
 I think.
 So there's there's other characters.
 I think Darth Maul might also be in Hollywood Studios, but that's not that many out here.
  I think the problem they run into sometimes with like face characters portrayed on screen by famous actor is like, but all the guests aren't.
 But the princesses are all human faces, but they're animated.
  Yeah, but that's even more drastic because one's a cartoon and one's a human.
 That's true.
 But the feedback of people when it's like when you meet Thor or like Captain America or it seemed like people were the reviews.
  Well, seeing Thor and Captain America was so funny because it's some like 18 year old college student.
 Right.
 Yeah.
 He's trying to like.
 Yeah, I don't mind doing that.
  I mean, they find good hunks for Thor, but like, yeah, I don't know if all of them go over.
 Spider-Man has a mask on, so that's fine.
 Sure.
 But like, I don't know.
  We've taken a photo together with Captain America.
 Taking a photo with Captain America.
 He shook our hands.
 Real firm handshake.
 Oh, yeah.
 He's got to have that.
 But yeah, no, they've never.
 All I'm saying is I feel like it'll be like Rey is in the park now and it's just a 20 year old.
 Yeah.
  It's not well, they got to do more acting.
 They could get away with having some fresh faced kid.
 Yeah, that's what I wanted as clean.
 I want it.
 Luke and I wanted to meet Art Carney and be Arthur from the holiday show.
 Yeah.
  Get them in there.
 They really should have every character in that Star Wars launch bay now.
 They just have a couple, like two at once.
 But you should be able to meet everybody.
 You all know while we're on the subject of other like auxiliary characters, you all know about Officer Zizek's.
  That sounds familiar, but who is Officer Zizek's? Officer Zizek's used to meet.
 He was a customs agent who you would meet at the end of the Tokyo version.
 Oh, no, I don't know him.
 He was like in a cage looking at all these monitors and he kind of looks like a weird like space rhino.
  So he's like the Patrick Warburton character that's on Star Tours now.
 Yes, but on the other side, you see him at the end.
 And the thing about Officer Zizek's, he is a he is the same mold as Sunny Eclipse.
 Oh, right.
  Do you know Sunny Eclipse? Yeah, I didn't until recently.
 OK, did you see him when you went down? I did.
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 Oh, sweet.
 Did you sit and listen to the space angels? No, it was more of a walk in and stand for nine minutes.
  Standing room only.
 Yeah, so you had to.
 I was trying to find a picture of him and I only came up with pictures of the philosopher and writer Oslavo Zizek.
 That's not it.
 No, not at all.
 How is Zizek spelled?  Oh, it's so many.
 The largest that will be the boringest thing you ever heard.
 But anyway, Officer Zizek's, I guess I think he he's now is listed on Wikipedia and Indoor Express, the the Star Wars specific Wikipedia's.
  So I guess he's key counts as part of the universe.
 And I also have to give a shout out I did in the live show also to Roxanne Rxn, who you is also kind of like a customs agent who speaks in multiple languages who you meet at the end of France star tours.
  And I don't you can't find a good video of her, but apparently she kind of gushes about Rex and has kind of a crush on him.
 And she still exists or does not know.
  Well, here's the awful thing when I was there, she was there, although her soundtrack was shut off.
 So she was just flapping around to no one.
 And now they put her in a crate like Rex and hers is a little creepy like hers has plastic.
  It let you know jail like a toy.
 Yeah, exactly.
 And she seems to be she looks a little sad and she seems to be reaching out like trying to get out of the box.
 So I think they screwed up with shoving Roxanne in a box.
  Yeah, and I want to know more about her and I was disappointed she didn't have a soundtrack when I was there and I'm just what a great advancement of the narrative of my favorite character Rex that he has a girlfriend or maybe a potential girlfriend's, although when he loses his job.
  I don't know if he's going to be able to hold that down.
  Will she be on in Galaxy's Edge.
  Somewhere to say no.
  No, she doesn't have the closest table like the closest table is just her.
  There's just going like I'm so proud of him.
  Yeah, talked about it for years.
 I'm so proud of him.
 He finally did it.
  Man, that would be great.
  Yeah, I think I think Kyle's right.
 No, is the more likely I feel like significant other to the DJ is like, yeah, he's still trying to DJ.
  Do you go to all of his shows? I try to make it if it's in town.
  Okay, have we covered enough of the auxiliary stuff that we should talk.
  Wait, hang on.
 We can keep delaying it.
 We can talk.
 We before we get to the ride.
 Let's talk about the line.
 Oh, yeah.
 I think an excellent line.
 Yeah, I would.
  I'm I you guys know this stuff better than me, probably, but I think it's one of the best cues if not.
 I don't know what's better.
  I have to agree.
 Yeah, I think maybe Indiana Jones topped it.
 But when you think about what was there at Disneyland in 87, what's a better line than that?  What like builds the story that as soon as you walk in that room, it's C3POs there.
 You don't have to wait till the ride.
  The advertisements on the planets on the big screen.
 Taking that a distance.
 It is funny to think about.
  Like, this is like a sightseeing tour.
 This is like Amtrak or an airline.
  This is a travel agency in Star Wars, and you wouldn't think that would be as dynamic as it is.
 Yeah.
 Well, they do a good.
  Yeah, it sounds like a boring thing.
 But those videos, I think, are really key in creating this kind of almost like 60s.
  I mean, it is like it's akin to America where there wasn't commercial air travel and you couldn't just go wherever you want, especially because countries are at war with each other.
  And now the war is over and you can go wherever you want.
 Places are friendly and dizzy.
  If you had wings, dream flight, like an actual airline terminals.
 Yeah.
  And a common with that.
 Also, though, with those videos and maybe I don't know if we're getting into this, but maybe perhaps a problem for some people with the ride and was maybe slightly for me as a child was just this promise of other places.
  Yeah, sure.
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 Which the new one does solve.
 Yes.
 And also the fact if you are really looking forward to going to Endor, you do not go to Endor.
 Yes, it doesn't.
  I feel like they could have ended it still on Endor and Ewoks celebrate your arrival or the Ewoks working at the airport.
  And then on the way out, there's like there's an Ewok customs agent or something.
 Yeah, I saw a couple interviews where George Lucas from that from the era when the bride is being introduced, where he's saying like the one of the cool parts about it is that it is reprogrammable.
  And that was their intent.
 Like reading Tony Baxter talk about making this, they did want to swap the projector in the film like in and out sometimes, but it was just too cumbersome and too expensive to do that for what it's for.
  It's four simulators out here, six in Florida, I think.
 Oh, OK.
 Oh, there's more down there.
 I didn't know that.
 Yeah, I think because that opened in 89.
 So two years after Anaheim, it was probably a real godsend when it opened because MGM studios had the great movie ride and a three hour, two hour long back lot tour when it opened.
  And that was it.
 And then later in the year, they got the Indiana Jones stunt show.
 And then at Christmas time, I think they got this.
 OK, which Disney, please never open anything at Christmas time again, because any time I've been at the parks at Christmas the last few years, it's just a crush.
  Well, that might be what happens with Star Wars land in Orlando.
 Yeah, that's terrible.
 It's delayed.
 There's also there is before the simulator thing came up, it was maybe going to be a space mountain type coaster where you chose you chose a path, the light and the dark.
  Yeah.
 And there's a lot of reference to like a black hole movie, a roller coaster based on the black hole.
 I don't know if that's the same thing or like the simulator was going to be based on the black hole was going to be there.
 Star Wars.
  It was going to be a big hit.
 Yeah.
 And that did not happen.
 But then then oh, and maybe also a Captain Nemo simulator.
 Oh, right.
  Open our 20,000 Leagues episode.
 So they were hovering around the simulator technology and actually new fact to me today, Disney was beaten to the punch on the simulator thing because there was a ride that opened in 1985 at the CN Tower, which is the big space needle type thing in Toronto.
  And in the base of it, there was a ride and I have more videos prepared for today's episode than any other episode.
 Y'all got to see this.
 This is this was a much more gentle ride though, the way I understand.
 Maybe I don't know.
  See what you really from the video.
  Right.
 See here and feel special effects in person for your Canadian Airlines interplanetary shuttle.
  Wow.
 Yeah, Dick.
  Could have been held like Canada.
 Very well could have been the music for sure.
 I believe you made that video.
 Like that's what you've been doing all summer.
 You made that and you're like, look at this thing I found.
 Yeah, you outed my my fake thing exactly in my wheelhouse.
  Yeah, it's all the elements.
 Canada doesn't exist anymore from the YouTube channel Retro Ontario.
 Shout out to that one of the best YouTube channels not to leave out retro Vancouver, retro Newfoundland or retro Winnipeg.
  But how dope does that thing look? And also, and like, and that it's it's bored aboard your Canadian Airlines flight to 2019.
 Incredible.
 So perfect.
  There's no on ride video though.
 Not that I could find.
 Yeah, there's a longer interview it seems like with about about it and people who had been on it but it was oh and also ride, I think, directed by Doug Trumbull who went on to do Back to the Future.
  Wow.
 Yeah, yeah.
 So all the, I wish I could experience this thing but so that was a, and it was the same type of vehicle I believe.
 You boarded from the back for some reason.
 Government level military grade simulators.
 Yeah, that's the term.
  And each one $500,000.
 Yeah, that's interesting because like Disney, Tony Baxter always talks about like you know they were the, I don't know if he says first or one of the first, but like they because like, and in the wake of that there's tons of simulators that get put into  shopping malls and it's a bunch of like crappy things, but I wonder if they knew about Disney, and they were trying to beat him to the punch.
 Oh, maybe.
 Or who knows like who knows exactly the chronology of events and they opened an unsafe ride that crushed many children.
  Sure, swept that under the rug.
 They're all in the basement of the CN tower.
  That thing.
 God that looks so good.
 But anyway, so they were so that was open so they're hovering around the, the simulator technology, and it oh and then well and the other thing in the story of star tourism I think Tony talked about this in our episode  that like Lucas was really gung ho about doing all this, but Eisner didn't want to wait Lucas wanted to do something else, like they both were like well this if this rides going to take forever.
 What can we do in the meantime.
  Yeah, let's make a movie.
 Captain EO.
  See so like get me the biggest music star, and the biggest director, and the biggest director, who we can get for a reasonable rate because cocaine has ruined him financially.
  That's you said this weird stuff to Coppola but to Tony and I was like what's I don't know if he shares your grim Coppola view.
 Oh yeah, what did you say about trash Coppola.
  I mean, it's a boon for Coppola to because the story of Coppola's career in the 80s is like uptown uptown uptown.
 I mean the winery is really what saved him.
  I mean, this all happened too because like Ron Miller and George, George Lucas had wine or he were like buddies.
 Oh yeah, they're a lot of auto these Silverado whiner yeah it's good that to rich weirdos like to wine together so they could make a very easy meetup on  two rich weirdos made wine, and then we all these kids got all the best ride that ever happened.
 Thanks.
  And I am Miller there to like, it sounds like a surreal experience.
 Yeah, glad it happened.
  So that gets us now we're in the line.
 Yeah, we're still.
  Yes, I don't know how much we want to talk about the star speeder being worked on.
 Yeah, hypothetically past that and then we get to also I didn't want to get out of order.
  The, the people mover used to go by the star speeder.
 And that's one of the biggest bummers because as we've talked about many times that was so cool to go and see it from another angle.
 Sure.
 Uh huh.
 And he had all those little like baggage cages or those little baggage trays that were floating around a conveyor belt.
  Yes, going to be there for a minute.
 Was there.
 Yeah.
 Oh, would he like go around the line.
 I don't know.
 I think this might have been a in status.
 Yeah.
 Oh, no kidding.
 Okay.
  That was exclusive to Anaheim in Orlando.
 We had a mini indoor forest and a full sized 80 80.
 Yeah.
  So unique there.
 Did you guys ever go on the star tours in Disneyland, the original.
 Yeah.
 Yes.
 Yeah.
 Is it the same as the Disney World version, the film is exactly the same.
 Yes, the entrance and the queue.
  Pretty similar.
 Yeah, you would come out.
 You would kind of come out and down into a store.
 Yeah, even that's similar.
 You're up.
 You're a little elevated and you go down a ramp and it leads into a store.
 Yeah.
  The France one is the same, except that there's this crazy space lady.
 There's this like Eurovision woman doing the the pre ride with kind of like, wow, cool space.
 That is very cool space here.
 It absolutely is.
  I'm like, just be a thing.
 Scott made though.
 Could be interesting.
 The Japan building looks very cool.
 I don't spoil.
 Well, we'll see.
 Building is star tours is in in Japan looks very neat.
 Anyway, Kyle, what were you saying before I cut you off?  Oh, no, I mean, like, I don't know how I don't know if I'm jumping ahead.
 But like, if you're walking through the line, you pass C3PO and R2 doing bits about the star speeder and star tours.
 And also, like I listen to it's like C3PO riffing on the off the video that's playing.
 So like an indoor video plan and C3PO will be like, we should I would like to go.
 I'm not going to fucking do.
  I think I magic.
 I don't know.
 Some dumb shit.
 Yeah, that's pretty much what the bit is.
 Yeah.
 And they do that for, I think, a couple of videos.
 But then you pass as you pass Admiral Ackbar and then you make it up to these G2 droids.
  OK, yeah.
 I'm curious your thoughts about the G2 droids.
 Well, I mean, I guess it's common trivia or fun trivia that these are stripped geese from America's things.
 You can see their tails.
 You can see this like like a little like thing flopping up and down.
  That's what was in the Carousel Progress Theater, which is now Star Wars Lunch Bay.
 All the all the other critters all went over to Critter Country to Splash Mountain.
 My favorite ride, which I love now.
 Right.
 And and these are the only two that's made it to.
  Yeah, I like these guys.
 Yeah.
 One of them has like, you know, he's listening to a song.
 Do you know this? Uh huh.
 Which I love that song on that little like.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 With kind of a radio filter.
 It's a little muffled.
  Is that anybody? Yeah.
 Is that song and available anywhere? I'd say I've listened to it like tonight.
 It's called Droid Room or Droid Rooms.
 Well, really? Yeah.
 Wow.
 I saw the title.
  There's also the thing I did see is that he says in the dialogue somewhere, I'm listening to K Droid, my favorite station.
 This is the latest hit from Danny and the droids.
  The name of the band is that might have been an 11th hour.
 Oh, yeah.
 We forgot to record something.
 Yeah.
 And then I want to the song is called I want to weld your hand.
  So yeah, I should have put Droid in.
 I want to weld your droid hand.
 Do you got the song? I think start to the droid rooms.
 Is that right? Yep.
 OK, here it is.
  This is great.
 Similar.
 Again, another something Scott made.
 Yeah, I think this is an area loop tomorrow and area loops sometimes.
  It's like those drum machine sounds.
 Scott is in heaven right now.
 It sounds a little muffled.
 The quality is a little so it sounds like a prince demo.
 It's like there's not a high quality version available.
  Doesn't sound like neon telephone or something.
 Yes, it does.
 Man, post that.
 I got to rip that thing.
 You know, while we're playing sounds, can I also.
  We're going to balance this out one day with Jason's series of just album by album journey through the they might be Giants career.
  The only music you like one band.
 For a time that was true when I was young.
 Let me just just a quick hit because like this is just this is crack.
  It's so perfect.
 Just the sound.
 Yes.
 And then related.
  Those things I was I was going on and on about how much I love those sounds.
 And Aaron said how if you got amnesia or something like that would be the key.
 They like bring that.
 Yeah, yeah.
  I would make all the memories come back or I would think I was Rex from that point.
 That's how we break the manchurian candidate spell.
  We stop you from assassinating or powerful finger activated or activated.
 That's when you know it is time to assassinate.
 Yeah.
 You have to pitch it up a little either way.
  If you want to send me on some mission controlling my mind with that sound.
 Not a problem.
 Sure.
 Anyway, that I got no commentary on all these things.
  They just you just like it.
 It's so good.
 Yeah, it is like all the elements are perfect.
 Really? Like, like it's it's hard to even goof on it.
 Yeah, kind of is.
  That's why I'm glad we had all the opening ceremonies and stuff.
 Yeah, yeah.
 It is just yeah, it's perfect.
 I also want to say just like texturally set design wise.
  Like just all the all the molding and everything and the way like the handles on the back of the seats and the room that you would you even call this when you're getting hit with just the pure strips of neon light and then those there's those little cut out gradings that you pass through.
  Kind of these like little Stargate passageways right by the right now where you get your glasses.
 What you're saying.
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 Very tall.
 Basically before you.
 Yeah, yeah, they feel like a little like scanning.
 Yeah.
  Space Mountain has similar stuff.
 They're just it's just the coolest.
 Everything is so well made and so well done.
 It is an attention to detail that I associate with Disney Imagineering then to a certain extent to Lucasfilm as well.
  Like those Star Wars movies.
 That's true.
 Yeah.
 A lot of great set design, a lot of detail.
 That's what you know makes the prequel still watchable is because all the set design and stuff and character design are cool and like whether or not you think maybe everything is so engaging.
  At least you like you got cool stuff to look at.
 That's where you move all that stuff.
 You go into those worlds in the ride and it's not so bad because you're only in there for five minutes.
 Sure.
 I don't.
  I haven't had any like latter day.
 I'm mad at JJ.
 So I like Jar Jar Binks now.
 But I but I don't like Jar Jar Binks but I like going to the Jar Jar Binks planet in that.
 But yeah, that's a really fun.
 That's almost the most fun one in the new one.
  I do think like I I don't really know.
 I mean I when I would go with my family as a kid and saw the prequels I enjoyed them and then later on the more I thought about it seemed like I was like yeah they're OK.
 I do in terms of like prequel revisionism.
  I do think it's kind it's kind of gross how we sort of did George dirty like as a culture at large.
 He's just like he made three more.
 He made he gave people so much with these first three movies and this attraction and his other work said that everyone's just like now fuck you for the prequels.
  Yeah, I don't.
 I can't imagine like the people versus George Lucas kind of people being super proud at this point.
 They shouldn't be.
 I mean they just announced this week Matt Smith was once Dr.
 Who's going to be in the next Star Wars movie and it's a shame the fans are just going to straight up murder him no matter what he does.
  He will be crucified on the hill for our sins.
 The hill of Golpah.
 Where do you land on Star Wars today.
 Do you like with what's going on now.
 Do you give a shit.
 Do you.
 Honestly I feel I'm like almost nervous to even like approach subjects because like it's  sure the level of controversy that surrounds it.
 Yeah I do.
 I think I don't just don't care.
 Like I think like yeah this notion of like I guess it goes back to what you're talking about with when Lucas put out the prequels but I've never like bought into the concept of like you raped my childhood or anything like that.
  Oh yeah sure.
 Or like I guess because like it doesn't that doesn't none of these things affect how those things affected me growing up.
 You know it doesn't change anything.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 I just think it's sacred and like if he made 50 Star Wars movies my memory of it isn't bad.
  I'm going to like see less of it.
 I mean like that what I just right now they come out so frequently that it's like I haven't seen Rogue One or Solo like yeah yeah I'll definitely see the new the follow up to last Jedi.
 Sure.
 Yeah.
  But it's just not essential or important to my life.
 It's like I kind of like like to do other things.
 Well you've got a very famously flexible schedule at Saturday Night Live.
 Yeah.
  There are people who have worked at that Saturday Night Live though who have made their time for all of this their Star Wars stuff.
 Oh I'm sure.
 Yeah.
 I'm working with one of those right now.
  Like Force Friday or whatever where the toys come out level of nerd.
 Are we talking.
 Probably I think so.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Absolutely.
 Toys R Us at 7 p.
m.
 Thursday night because they open early to get the toys or like I'm sure like sending an intern to do whatever work.
  Yeah.
 I mean as I recall sure.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 But yeah no I think it's I also like him just supportive of people making stuff.
 Sure.
 Yeah.
 People getting paid in terms of like you're not going to be like furious about the movie regardless.
  Yeah.
 I don't like so.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 I didn't love like it's like it's like Transformers like when those movies came out like I was kind of bothered by the design of the Transformers because they didn't look like the way I remember Transformers looking.
  Yeah.
 I just didn't see him.
 It didn't.
 That was it.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Well I think when you feel the obligation this looks awful to me and I'm mad but I have to go.
  And now I saw it and I am mad like I'm still a little upset.
 I should have a lot of people said about Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
  Well you.
 Well you gotta go.
 I mean I know it looks bad but you gotta go right.
 And I went I was like I didn't have to go.
 I should have just not done it.
 Yeah.
 And I think that's maybe I'm going to try to make that my policy although I'll do.
  Hey I'm I'm I'm in for a lot of hate watch and I'm sure.
 But yeah I also want to say I support lovers and haters.
 I actually I want to leave this like being neutral.
 Yeah.
  No that's fair.
 I think that communicated.
 OK.
 Already I think there's something about like I think me being more of a star tours person.
  It's like not a bad place to be because the movies I think also the fact that the rides kind of like it's separate from all those wars.
 It's more star than wars.
 Yeah.
 The whole thing just by its nature is calmer.
  And I'm not going to be mad about what they do on any of these planets and these new movies because in my mind I didn't know they were in the movies until.
  That's why I was I really like the first time I finally watched all the stars movies I was like oh hot.
 That's from the poster from Starter.
 I really went about it backwards.
 So that was like ancillary content for star tours.
  Basically films to me are just yeah there are these odd take homes of the experience which is the ride.
 I mean as a kid I probably like you have Starter is definitely if not my favorite one of my favorites because that's the one I went on.
  That's one where I helped my supporting friends my freshman year in college on my friends her profile star tours was one of my favorite movies.
  Was there were the rest actual films or were they yeah Billy Madison.
  Great great choice.
  I'm not saying you got to go to talk.
 I was sure I was definitely into memento.
  Entering film school in the same class.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 You're you're you're you got a rep fight club and little Donnie Darks.
  Oh yeah.
 Yeah.
  Classic.
 You got a what have we missed besides the right.
 So well there's not a lot to say about it but that the the nerves that you feel when you're watching that when you finally get up to the boarding area and there's those announcements like it's ready for boarding that voice kind of freaks me out in a cool way.
  And the sound and then the cool lady you get to see with the crazy loop hair.
 She's she's a perfect like 80s by way of start of the original all of that stuff.
  The original versus the new one is a little bit more.
 It's not scary but it's a little like now it's like the cartoon like character.
  It's a little less.
 It's a little it's a lot more cartoonish.
 So like the other stuff is a lot more.
 I hate to say it but realistic maybe and a little bit more scary and makes it cool grimy like you're going to be grimy and now they're trying to make them grimy but it's not.
  But yeah it's still kind of as that frequently shot shine to it which doesn't make it as cool.
 It's much cooler.
 The original where it's like kind of a dumpy space travel like an awful drab garage.
  Yeah yeah yeah good.
 I guess why to me is that better than a cute droid.
 I don't I don't know.
 I think it makes you more.
 It makes you feel like you're what you're going to get on is is real.
  Right.
 So like and then seeing the next because that star speeder my toy does not exist.
 This is painted onto a black box.
 But seeing a star speeder being worked on by boring mechanics really sells.
  This is a real thing in a real garage.
 You're going to get a real 747.
 It's kind of fucked like a little dinged up.
 Like some of the seats don't go back all the way.
 That is the reality.
 It's such a smart thing.
  And I'm sure this is in an interview or maybe I've read it and I'm just forgetting but like it is such a smart thing to show that star speeder in the line because the vehicle you can't see every almost every other ride vehicle you can see what it looks like before you're getting on.
  But this way you can go oh that's what I'm getting on even though it's obviously not painted exactly like that.
 Yeah I was going to I mean on that tip of reality within that pre show video you mentioned the maintenance workers what's fun about that.
  They do nothing.
 It's like they're not acting you know that I mean like in the new one.
 Yeah exactly.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Today those would be there'd be like comedy.
 Yeah exactly.
 It's boring.
  Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Scary with its black and white or night vision or whatever it is.
 And then that the video is oh it's just the perfect.
 Yeah.
 It's also something that I've always had this thing about like mixing film cameras with with boring video at a different frame rate and seeing Chewbacca or that weird creature with the three eyes with camera.
  Seeing Star Wars characters shot with like the on the same cameras that they use to film Maury Povich.
 Yeah it's so great.
 Now that is supposedly like in addition to the alien you're talking about the loading video.
 Yeah right.
 Yes.
 That is like imagine yours and their families.
  Humans.
 OK.
 I really like the kid who snaps a photo of Chewbacca.
 I don't know if you'd have to.
 He just has the dumbest.
 Yeah.
 His face is very funny.
 I like smoking.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 He's great.
 Yeah.
 Oh yeah.
 He exists just to smoke.
 He loves smoking.
 And then and then I don't know.
 I don't know off and the name of the actress who hosts that that thing.
 But she you know.
  Allison Janney is the droid I like but I don't like it as much as the original.
 It's not as good but she's in the new load in video.
 She's like you can watch her get on the original.
 Nice nod.
 Oh that's not to the old.
 But are we ready to get on.
 Should we get on.
  Now we're in 40 minutes and we'll get to the right.
 Or is it because I have I have some things that I love from the ride but compared to current stuff like makes me not makes me mad.
 OK.
 I don't want to.
 Well I feel like I mean the thing the most famous and I think Tony brought this up in our show.
 You know Rex yelling I've always wanted to do this.
 That is again so endearing like that is so like as a kid like I loved hearing that right before you went in the trees because he's in the  He's just a fan like we are.
 But that contrasted with like some of the more self aware.
 That is in theory self aware but it reads as very genuine to me.
 In some of the newer movies there's like little bits of self awareness.
 Like isn't there a thing in Last Jedi where.
 The phone thing.
 The message thing.
 No it doesn't.
 They're in the Falcon at one point they're being chased by.
  Thai fighters and and they look all look at the camera and say we're going to be in the last Jedi.
 Someone else are right on the tail and doesn't.
 John Boyega yell like oh yeah they love doing that shit or doesn't.
 Yeah like you see shit.
 What are you talking about.
 I don't know.
 He says there's like a gag or it's it's like they're always here we go again.
 Yeah something like that.
  And I don't know.
 It's rather me is like very constructed.
 I think it's on create.
 It's when maybe when they show up on create.
 Of course it's not good.
 It's it's in a movie and it's not in the right and the right is better than all.
 Yes.
 I'll say.
  We'll have to find whatever you're talking about and post it on the Twitter.
 I was told when I when I was there was a guide when I had this my special day with Jeff at Disney which is what I'll refer to it from now on.
 And there was a guide there he said the Ryan Johnson took some of the design from the ride video which like the crystals and stuff and put it in last Jedi that it was inspired from Star Tours like the old the comments.
 Yes.
 Yeah.
 Yes.
 Whoa.
  That's cool.
 And that makes it because the my favorite sequence of last Jedi I'd say is that crystal plan the red salt and everything that sequence that part is so well done.
 Keep going out of order.
 But like that it feels I know they sold that really well.
 You feel this impact is great.
  The excellent sound.
 I love the comments.
 You watch it.
 It feels kind of tipped and slow moving through there similar to like the back to the future ice age stuff.
 But they the way you the way it felt when it was actually in motion was so cool.
  Odd concept that you get lost within a comet.
 Sure.
 But think about.
 Yeah I think you're right on this thing of R2D2 like Rex nails it going through that if you're going to not as faulty ended up in a comet.
 Yeah.
 But he perfectly.
  Perfectly my friends like I'm not one to go like oh this fictional character is my friend but I think like R2 Rex and Spider-Man in the Spider-Man ride I go oh it's my friend.
 Sure.
 Also I would say Rex to like he doesn't crash the star speeder.
  He gets through like Rex is like Sully and he gets everyone safely on the other side and you're on the other side a Sully like trial.
 He probably ends up in a trial where they play a simulation of what happens.
  Right over again.
 That's the start to wrong way.
 Breaks breaks.
 There's a Sully like movie which is Star Tours.
 Oh that's the movie.
 That's great.
 And most of it is just him before and after and taking a jog and he's nervous.
  Yeah.
 Could you get some.
 Well it's just shot for shot.
 Then it's shot for shot.
 Sully with Rex.
 Man.
 Yeah.
 You might need a little more conflict.
 What about some flight inspiration.
 He has a drinking problem.
 Is that the twist in it.
 I don't really.
 I watched like half watched it.
 I just remember the plane being upside down at one point.
 You less than half watched it if you don't remember that he had a drinking problem.
  The primary.
 And John Goodman just going like yeah.
 Goodman having a real funny voice.
 You're thinking of you half watched the trailer.
  Ralph.
  Great piano.
 The.
 What else.
 I don't know.
 We haven't talked about that.
 Well let's go back into order.
 He goes.
 You stop you're going the wrong way.
 Break space.
 This part also again that that grimy garage.
 It's functional and not a fun Star Wars place.
 It is not.
 There's not a bunch of droids zipping around.
 It's just like weird misery in there.
  But I love that.
 And also a Lucas request because Lucas himself a giant Disneyland fan and he thought why there's all these places in Disneyland that say authorized personnel only and you always wonder what's back there.
  Let's for the first time in a ride go back there.
 Let's let's go to one of those odd zones and it's nothing weirds going.
 It's just like oddly functional and but I now I think it's really a trope of rides and especially universal rides that you know it's supposed to be this pleasant thing but then something bad happens.
  But I don't know that was really going on before Star Tours and I think himself in that's interesting.
 Well do we know if the simulator in 1985 the trip to Jupiter to do her went smoothly or I go figure that out.
  But yeah I know this is kind of where the word start this starts this trope starts kind of even though it's become mostly the trope for so many rides after it.
 But yeah the next time you're mean to Lucas and make fun of his his appearance.
  Remember he thought of the coolest ride thing.
 Yeah.
 Is there anything before this because all pirates everything on a mansion.
 It's just you're you're doing what you went in there to do.
 Exactly.
  There's no wrong turn.
 Big Thunder Mountain you know you're going on a wild ride right.
 I tell you that Matterhorn you're on a bobsled.
 This is I think the beginning of the ride went the wrong way and the wrong thing happened.
  And it's like happening to you and universal would use it well much more than Disney would in the years after this.
 So cool.
 Yeah.
 They stole it stole it from George.
 Wow.
  Everybody stole from George.
 Also the fact that Rex in general came out of Lucas liking the Jungle Cruise and thinking what's our equivalent of the Jungle Cruise.
 So he really got to like this maybe is the first example of a ride being made by a by a fan like a fan of the property getting to do his own thing with it.
  Ironically a thing so that happens to Lucas on his beloved world's.
 So not as like Cameron maybe not as big of a Disney parks fan James Cameron.
 I bet he's not probably not.
 You would imagine.
 But maybe no way to know.
  There's no way to know.
 Seen like Tom Fitzgerald other imagineer who worked on both versions right.
 I think you sent a video of him being interviewed for the new version and Tony talks about him working on the original version to seem like to be a big Star Wars fan.
  Yeah.
 And yeah it seems like he brought a lot of the cool innovations to it.
 What I guess with the ride almost.
  What's your favorite part of the ride Kyle.
  See I mean I well I think we're skipping over the reveal to like the shield that covers that comes up and down.
 It's gonna be a breezy ride over the.
 I don't know.
 This is not like necessarily a favorite part of the ride but just like stepping out of it just like the notion.
  I guess you're talking about like how grimy it is and I might be wrong but like these are all I feel like as a kid I was fully immersed in it and then like as a college like film student I experienced in a different way and I saw it from like a filmmaker's perspective.
  And it's like we are traveling through miniatures that mostly miniatures.
 Yeah.
 Which is pretty sick like sure.
 Yeah I think I would love I would kill to like see any of those spaces in.
  Reality like if those models are still around somewhere because that's all those pictures are always crazy like I've seen the pictures of the original Death Star models and they're like these I don't know what the scale is but it's they're bigger than you think they would be but they because they have to be because there's a camera that has to go through or like the Ghostbuster.
  You ever seen those Ghostbusters pictures with the guy in the state puff costume and then the full like city built.
 Sure.
 This is crazy how detailed that they have to be from like marketing stuff I remember this picture of as a kid.
  This is like clearly a miniature.
 Oh oh yeah yeah they're manipulating.
 Great I mean this was this was the time when also I think from a ride to the use of the of the TV with our two and the the pilots going back and forth that was really cool is yeah it was really cool.
  It's really cool.
 So hard back then too so it's incredible they were able to do it every like six minutes every day.
 It's one of the and it's a cool thing they they used also in the future the ride like the multiple screens.
  Yeah I need and I remember like her thinking like I bet those I bet and I hope the new actors Boyega and Oscar Isaac and stuff when they got to like film their new parts and like if I were me knowing like this is going to be on the little screen and star tours like that's really where you made it.
  You're part of the universe finally but that's my perspective.
 Yeah and you get your you get your cool X-Wing dude that guy's great.
 You get your I mean at the very end you get that guy behind the fuel truck who like ducks when the who like back in the day I remember the rumor was that that was like George Lucas I think if I'm thinking of the right guy.
  Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that guy that's what everybody thought yeah I'm not sure who I think it is he was another Lucas film guy obviously you go to the Death Star if you remember that part.
  Yeah I have an issue with so here's my issue with that reading about it.
 They made it worse like reading about the justifications that like the Lucas story wise story wise because it's like well this all takes place after Return of the Jedi and this is actually Death Star 3 which may have been a fake Death Star and actually a fade out and I'm like just shut up I don't care.
  I actively do not care I just think it's cool to go on the Death Star run.
 Well and I think I think it's possible that in the discussions that Lucas was a person he said well like we I think he wanted to be timeline consistent and he said let's have the Death Star like the Death Star happen why would we do that again and I have been told he was one of the parties who said yeah but like think about the like you know feel over function but you have to people are going to want to go through this.
  Yeah and he talks about what people expect from an experience that has like an IP on it and it's like well what would people want to do so I guess he was probably being like well there's two movies where there's Death Star runs people must want to do that.
  Yeah.
 But I must say yeah this is the third Death Star we could add a different ending let's be honest make a different big ship.
 Well also isn't it unfinished? Well yeah but it's always been unfinished.
  It's never been there's never been like a complete finished Death Star really where has there but the first one looks pretty complete New Hope but they're just turning it on in New Hope.
  Sorry visually unfinished like in Return of the Jedi the Death Star looks different.
 There's like holes in it.
 All this movie stuff I don't know what you're talking about.
 Yeah.
  Not part of the canon.
 I was just assumed it was the Return of the Jedi run it was the Return of the Jedi Death Star they got there right as Return of the Jedi was happening as a kid.
  Oh you were assuming that it was that one.
 Yeah I was just assumed.
 But for sure it's officially that they've started a third one.
 It's officially announced something else.
  Yeah so it doesn't make any sense.
 So they're building a third one.
 They're building a third one.
 Well they're trying to rationalize the idea that the galaxy is somewhat at peace and that's why we can kind of freely travel through it.
  Yes.
 So it has to be after the second Death Star.
 It has to be.
 Yeah.
 But it's still like.
 Or maybe it didn't blow up.
 Maybe all the pieces reformed perfectly post explosion.
 Black holes sucked them all perfectly back together.
  I think though I mean they don't there's a lot of questions when you see Force Awakens how all of a sudden the First Order is just there and they're so powerful.
 So maybe this kind of bridges that in a better way like the conflict really didn't stop.
  And this might take a Death Star every two years.
 Right.
 And they blew it up.
 So there's been like 50 Death Stars up until the giant one.
  They're not fixing the problems with this.
 They do the same one.
 God and then Starkiller base is the last one.
 Let's just get like two more security guards watching making sure no X-Wings are flying in here.
  Designs perfect.
 It's not a design problem.
 Yeah.
 There's something there's something about also I don't want to be this guy who's knocking the new one as opposed to the old one.
 But because there's a lot that I like in the in the new one.
  But I don't love all of the endings in Adventures Continue.
 And I think there's something to me about the cleanliness of you're in the Death Star.
 You know what this is.
  And you do like the ultimate Star Wars thing.
 And I think the new some of the new endings in Adventures Continue have a lot of the phrase I wrote down prequel a fluvia like I were I don't know what planet this is and it's not like a major event from one of the films.
  I understand being on the Jar Jar Planet or being in the pod race more than we're in this city with a lot of traffic.
 And I think well that's Coruscant.
 Okay.
 And that's a planet from Star Wars.
  The intergalactic government.
 But either way you know what I mean.
 Like it's not like you're not in a I don't know your man up your primary sequence of the Star Wars one ends with the ending of Star Wars and Star Tours to has you go to some more places.
  There are a couple of low key endings for the new Star Tours and I agree with what you're saying.
 There's a couple times I think Coruscant is the one you're talking about where you just kind of slide on that ramp and they're like we didn't die.
 See you later.
 Yeah.
 Like that's all it is.
  It's not a fun because I would say that there's first.
 Well this should be saved for the next one.
 But I'll say it anyway.
 I went on.
 We went on a couple days ago and the end was the Naboo one where you're underwater which I think is one of the best ones.
  We get things mouth.
 Absolutely.
 And then you slide into the whatever the hanger thing and the window breaks.
 Yeah.
 That's which is really great.
 And there's a funny little gag there.
 I didn't know this.
 The window didn't break this time.
 Oh wow.
  And I was blown away because I've been on this.
 I went in that scenario like five ten times.
 Who knows.
 And it always breaks.
 I went on it and if you Jason you do you know what I'm talking about.
 Yeah.
 You've seen this and then the point that usually goes through your window snapped off instead of the window breaking and then somebody threw pain at the window and I didn't know that existed.
 So that's one of the good ones.
 But I know what you're saying is a couple things can sort of low key versions of this.
 It doesn't feel like you've really finished this big like oh my God.
  It just feels like a whimper.
 It's just a harder like thing to wrap your head around like someone on the ship is a rebel spy and you need to get them to a secret hideout.
 Oh I see play it's a lot of fun.
 Yeah.
 A lot of the more bloody is the new one than the old one is very clean.
 It's very simple.
 Yeah.
 Although I'm curious.
 Kyle you ever been the spy.
 Yeah.
 And it was remarkable.
 I don't know if you got if it if it means anything to you guys.
  But there was for me like a lot of buildup in terms of like will this ever happen to me.
 And so when it did finally happen I was psyched.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 I would be excited.
 You guys have not.
 I've not.
 I've been twice.
 You've been twice.
 No one in Hollywood.
 I know that we're like this is obvious.
 We're talking about the other ride here.
 Yeah I know.
 Have you developed any do you have any ideas as to the picking process.
 I know I do know.
 I know a couple things too possibly but possibly.
  I was told on my special day with Jeff by the guy that one of the and this isn't foolproof but a lot of people fumble around very like during the pre part of the ride when you're putting your seat belt on putting stuff under that one of the things you can do is immediately sit down kind of look straight ahead and don't fumble with stuff because they're looking to get a clear photo of you.
 It happens so.
  Or it happens before it doesn't happen right at that moment.
 It happens before I think the ride starts so it's not even more insight on this.
 Yeah I mean I've heard I think the back two rows are are possibly this could be inaccurate are like you want to land yourself there.
  And I didn't I haven't heard that specifically but I naturally like just try to look as bored as possible because like seemingly all the rebel spies they choose are that.
 Yes and it worked and when I told my friend to do it it worked for him too.
  Wow yeah like maybe it's so yeah maybe it's a kind of a straight ahead like a board because I kind of want everybody to go haha like right at that face or whatever like this person that's not that enthused.
 So yeah that makes that makes sense.
 So if you can see a clear shot of the face and the face is like.
  Well then we have to put it out there if you do it if you get if you do it based off the tip and you are the spy I was gonna say send a picture but that's like it's kind of hard.
 You don't want your phone to fly into the front of the.
 But just let us know.
  And does it work hashtag I'm the spy.
 So yeah yeah get get in there get situated real quick and then like probably don't go like crazy with a dopey look on your face but make it very neutral make it a very kind of neutral face like maintenance guys in the original star tours.
  Exactly yeah yeah and real play it real do it to say story wise it's kind of lacks operational security to tell a flight full of civilians who the undercover operative that's a good point.
 Yeah that they shouldn't do that that's like when Dick Cheney outed Valerie Plame.
  Yeah very how about that material.
 How about that political material I enjoyed it.
 Well what else I you know I also I also like the other side I like when the gate goes up and Rex is still pleading his case.
  Yep yes I'm used to his programming he's so sympathetic there and I'm more sympathetic for him now realizing that half of it is on our to again I just don't believe that they fired our to I think our to had fame coming into it and that they had to pin the blame on somebody somebody to be a fall guy.
  Yeah yeah yeah yeah and they were sketched out by his DJing.
 So maybe he just quit.
 Or maybe he just got put on leave and then the company folded.
 Either way I'm fine with all these different ones.
  Or maybe he got a much better DJing job that pays way better and he and Roxanne are still together to this day.
 They are rich and very happy.
 Well I think we'll be able to tell this when they when they let us know how soon like how much after Star Tours is Galaxy's Edge and Batuu and Black Spire Outpost.
  Which are the old names.
 That's the name of the place itself.
 So you're saying Star Wars.
 So it's named all of these things? Yeah so Star Wars Galaxy's Edge is just the general area.
 The planet you're on is Batuu and the name of the little town is Black Spire Outpost.
  Okay so there that's those are the names you need to know.
 So it's like a city within a county within a state.
 Yeah and everyone is country called Star Wars Galaxy's Edge.
 And everyone's just gonna call it Star Wars land.
 Yeah as they should.
  Better.
 I'm getting used to Galaxy's Edge but still it's clunky.
 Kyle you excited about Star Wars? Any hopes you have for Star Wars land or Galaxy's Edge as fringe people call it?  I'm just generally curious.
 I think like I imagine most people are nervous about how it'll affect moving around the parks.
  Yeah.
 Yep.
 Might be good to.
 Well are you gonna stay away from it for a while or do you go in as soon as it's open? It should be summer.
 It's not something that I'm like.
 You're not thinking about it every day?  I have thought about Star Tours too before it came out.
 Like and I was there I don't know if you guys like this is like the first ride I remember where like maybe I just wasn't paying attention where there was like a celebration of the Star Wars Star Tours ending.
  You know what I mean? Like the last flight to end or.
 Oh yeah.
 They blew it up.
 Yeah.
 Boba Fett threw a thermal detonator and blew the building up and they set off pyro.
 Whoa.
 In Florida.
 In Florida.
  Well in here Tony Baxter came on board and said goodbye.
 He like he set up the final flight and says the force be with you because I won't be and then he walks out.
 Because Tony also ran he like operated the ride for the first few months it was open.
 Is that right? He went in in a flight suit.
 Yeah.
 Oh I didn't know that.
 Yeah it's in that e-ticket magazine I have.
 Wow that's awesome.
 Yeah he just for fun he just was like curious about the operation of it and wanted to help.
 So he was just like a shift leader.
  Wow.
 Isn't that crazy.
 That is crazy.
 Cool guy.
 But anyway yeah but you yeah how was that transition for you.
 Well so like we made it I definitely made I went to go on like one of the last I don't know that probably the last week that Star Tours was because do they not.
 I feel like they didn't advertise as much.
 This was only like what 10 years like eight years ago.
 Yeah 2010 I think it is like up to that point how many times the parks would advertise like when a ride was closed.
  But this was a time where people were aware that this was happening.
 Yeah and I think now they do it a little more like last chance on.
 Yeah I saw that like they're doing it for the Jurassic Park ride.
 Yeah.
 Which is going to be almost the same ride I think.
 I think.
 That's why I don't know whether they're making a big deal out of that.
 But I was psyched to see what the second Star Tours would be because I was so into this original incarnation.
 Yeah what did you think were you disappointed were you nervous it was going to be not the same.
 I can say I was always nervous when I like the very first footage I think.
  That you saw was the pod racing footage.
 Yeah and I don't know I guess just like seeing like how kind of digital it looked and like it looked a little bit like a video game to me.
 Yeah that made me nervous.
 Yeah.
  And that'll happen on rides here and there still that the footage you see on TV looks weird and you're put off and when you're there in person witnessing however it's projected and how it's meant to be shown it's much better.
 Yeah and I like I do definitely enjoy the ride.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 There were rumors for a long time that it was going to be all pod race and that made me very nervous.
 Yeah.
 I don't mind it being one step of it but it also wouldn't make sense that it's entirely pod race.
 So that's that's good.
 Yeah.
  I don't know.
 I don't know if this was initially too for the first incarnation but then I know for sure the second incarnation the blue sky was like it would like have windows and you could see stuff on the sides like you'd see stuff whizzing by on the sides as well.
 I'm not sure.
 I'm assuming that would be something they would try to think of the first time around but I remember there was like a blue sky version like where the ceiling would open up and you would see something like up like up like sky or whatever.
 If you were on Tatooine but that would suck you out of the shit.
 Yes.
  You'd have to be pod racing on Tatooine or be on Coruscant or be on Kashyyyk or be on.
 You couldn't be underwater.
 I don't know these words of which you speak.
 They're very old to all of these places.
 You should know that the last one I really don't know.
 What did I say.
  Kashyyyk.
 Kashyyyk.
 Kashyyyk.
 Chewbacca's homework.
 Yeah it's when the Wookiees are on the front sliding down.
 It's the Chewy Planet.
 It's a Chewy Planet.
 You're getting the name wrong.
 We didn't really touch on this.
 I always thought the art advertising  for Star Tours was just great.
 Yeah.
 The artwork was very good.
 You may have went away.
 Pull it back.
 I know what you're talking about.
 There's a bunch.
 We'll post a bunch of it.
 We're selling some of that stuff at the Van Eden Gallery.
 I was trying to do a little but it was all our projects.
  I had a Star Tours poster growing up and I've since collected the clothes at the paraphernalia.
 Do you have multiple? Do you have a bunch of Star Tours? Yeah man.
 I can send you.
 I got pics of me and my Star Tours gear on the last ride.
  Oh sure.
 We love Star Tours.
 Figure wise.
 Let's get the full line up of wardrobe.
 We've spoken and talked so much but this last ride I went on incidentally was the second time I went with Beck and Nick from the sketch group I'm in called Good Neighbor and our friend Clay.
  It was the second time I took the mushrooms in my life.
 Wow.
 That played a part too.
 How bad was that? Was that horrifying? Awful.
 Yeah.
  I was going to say I hate that.
 You know Star Tours was chill.
 Star Tours was the first ride we went on.
 They hit right as I got into the park and I could kind of feel it when we went to one of the bathrooms and just dealing with all these people and hearing the sounds of flushing and hand dryers go.
  It was like I was in a factory and then getting out of there and then just having to weave through people felt like a video game.
 But Star Tours was great.
  That was the only one.
 Then I went into Captain EO where I had.
 Oh my.
 It was exciting.
 They had that pre-show video of the behind the scenes.
 Which I loved.
 That music and that thing.
  It felt like it feels like they're like coked out.
 It's like Jordan.
 You know what I mean? It is an intensity.
 You get over there and you spin around.
 Exactly.
  But then like then watching Captain EO, which I love, like I just had this experience where like I was a struggling comedian and actor and like it's obviously difficult for a lot of us to like pay the bills.
 And it was one of those moments where I'm like watching this thing feeling like fuck.
 I'm never going to be able to do this.
 I don't know.
 I just had a very like self-aware moment and that kind of fully brought me to a negative place.
  You thought you wouldn't be part of a production as grand as Captain EO? I was just like oh man if I was on the set of Captain EO I'd be too nervous Steve.
 I'd pull this off.
 I just like had a lot of kind of like self-doubt and I didn't get to enjoy the movie because like I saw it as like a film production.
  Uh huh.
 Rather than like.
 I have that whenever I get a little bit high I do I have that where I like see through the like the narrative has gone to me and I can like see I could feel the energy of the production good or bad.
 Exactly.
 And usually bad.
 That's exactly what it's like.
  When we were at Desert Trip and I was watching Paul McCartney from like the pit and I was just like this old sack of bones.
 Yeah.
 And we both seen him in a more exciting setting before and now it felt like oh I've seen through the magic trick.
 And I could see he's sick of doing this.
 It's the same pattern he does before.
  Yes.
 Here we go.
 For John this is for John.
 And all the girls.
 And all the girls.
 The gentleman if it makes you feel any better the opposite where you just get really invested in the reality of like oh Moana's got a second family.
 I wish I felt like that.
  I don't know he loved.
 No no I just committed to I don't see the product I don't see the divide just like fully in mesh in the story.
 Yeah.
 He's sometimes good but then sometimes like very stressful if it's like so it's all bad.
 Yeah.
  Everything is like succession or something.
 It's all real bad.
 But that's kind of I got badder better.
 I got badder.
 Sure.
 They gave me some badder because I could tell.
 No I mean like I was looked out for and the big break like midway through the day we went to like the uva cafe and drank some beers and I was just like that's all I thought.
 I felt so good like that was what it took.
 Wait where? The uva it's the middle.
 Oh the middle.
 I've never eaten at the uva.
 I've never been to uva.
  I've never been to the uva.
 Oh that's Scott's favorite place.
 Oh really? Trio of flatbreads.
 Yes for sure.
 And the chorizo street fries or something.
 I haven't tried those.
 Have you been in the restaurant it's connected to or like.
 Yeah I don't like it as much.
 You don't like it as much.
 I like the casual open air.
 I feel like they typically have a good soundtrack too.
 I don't know if you've ever caught this but it'll be like.
 I can't play some music.
 It'll be like 80s it'll be like cool in the gang or something or like a little fire-esque.
 It'll be like.
 Oh sure.
 Yeah.
  Exactly.
 We're going to have to do an uva episode.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 You want to come back.
 I think you're signed up for the uva episode.
 I always get a pinnacle out of there that place is fucking tight.
 Would you have protested if that was part of the hotel's not happening anymore but like if they were going to do the hotel and they knocked down uva would that be something you would sign a petition for? To keep uva.
 Progress is progress.
 I don't know.
 I think I've been there, I've been to uva.
  Fair enough.
 But who knows how I would feel if it really got for better.
 If the reality were there.
 Hold on.
 I don't want to predict that by the time this episode comes out the hotel will be resolved but they're going to fix the hotel.
 That hotel will be fucking resolved.
 But somebody just pulled on a second here.
 This is I don't want to get with it.
 We're already two hours and 17 minutes.
 We're in the longest episode territory.
 Someone just posted on our Facebook a job listing for Earl of Sandwich employee.
 Whoa.
 So Disney is not  thinking that what you're talking about is going to be resolved.
 They're about to reopen Earl of Sandwich and who knows about ESPN's on a rainforest cafe.
 Could they come back? They might be coming back.
 That would be wild.
 I think this is going to be resolved within a few months.
 Exiles and then brought maybe that's like a kind of.
 I don't know.
 That's like to be your move now Anaheim.
 That could also be your yeah that could be like.
 Do you think this is a negotiating tab? Oh so they're going to be like oh well they're going to open their own  restaurant.
 I guess they're not going to please build a hotel.
 Disney please build a hotel and they're going to be like all right fine and then they fire those poor people they hired.
 I guess they would do that.
 They're very cruel.
 No I don't think they ever hire it.
 I think it's a red herring.
  I think it's a fake.
 I look at it.
 This is all more exciting than the Star Wars films to me.
 Yeah.
 Eternal politics.
 Anaheim v Disneyland.
 Well since we are getting into the longest one I had a feeling.
 I mean there's a ton here.
 Thanks for hanging and for so long.
 But anyway it's gone.
 We don't even I don't even know how to do a plus it up.
 How do you know.
 Can I.
 One thing I feel like we're not touching upon me.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 It's not fair to say that.
 But like.
  This is like also the prime example or I had not experienced this prior to this ride of like the dropping off into the gift shop like the exit through the gift shop.
 Oh yeah.
 Is it the I mean it's not the first it's a like as opposed to you go buy a merchandise cart.
 It is definitely that you were dumped into a specific hard to get out of.
 It's kind of yeah.
 Disneyland specifically because there's not really a gift shop on a mansion pirates like you can go to New Orleans Square but yeah.
  Immediately there I think for Disneyland especially because like in Orlando pirates kind of opens you opens right into the gift shop for pirates.
 Sure.
 But I bet it is Disney.
 But it's certainly a problem.
 I remember like as a child it got me pumped.
 Oh yeah.
 You leave the like Star Wars theme is playing and then like all of a sudden like there's all the Star Wars.
 That's when you're.
  I love that ramp.
 I love just that boring kind of like post movie theater ran those posters and and the Star Trader itself continues to have.
 I mean that's where I got like EO shirts when he was back.
 Yeah.
 And kids can build their own lightsaber.
 I feel like that store has been like active and vital.
  Yeah.
 Since it opened up.
 Yeah.
 Florida was Star Trader was always a big one for me as a kid and it's huge.
 And yeah I feel it was the only place you could really find Star Wars stuff at a certain point and then they started selling it at Merchant of Venus and Magic Kingdom when Alien Encounter was still open.
  And I was I was kind of like oh cool more Star Wars stuff but also I was like it's taken away from Alien Encounter merch.
 So I don't know how I feel about this.
 So and it's also the battle of original property versus IP.
  You know played out on a very microscopic scale.
 Sure.
 But one thing everybody can agree on and I don't know if this I don't know when this went up or if it was during Star Tours or not but Star Trader neon tumbling through space Mickey's man oh man.
  That is my Disneyland.
 That's my tomorrow land that I will throw a fit if it's ever gone.
 Yeah.
 That thing zero gravity Mickey.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Were I to shroom I would just sit and stare at that for a while.
 How about this.
 What if that was at the Van Eendt gallery.
  The actual the actual thing that might be a life saving if you if you had like say like 10 million in the bank which is a lot of money but you shouldn't spend a million of it on a thing at Disney.
  No.
 How much how much would you spend for that if I got a lot to readjust if I have 10 million dollars.
 Six wipe it all out.
 It's me a little bit.
 All right.
 Million.
 Pretty good.
 Great.
 Done deal.
 I don't know where I'll put it.
 I don't think I don't think a house has a lot of like neon hookups.
  I think a glass artist could fabricate one for you for a tenth of them.
 Well that's the only six hundred thousand dollars.
 I think if you have a house so it's going to be a neon room in the house.
 What do you think.
 Yes.
 Look if I to have this neon room if I have to go live in you know deep Bakersfield.
 Yeah.
 That's how this has to play out.
  Fine.
 But yes and I will recreate the entire boom boom city only open for two days laser laser tag for which I still have all of the props.
 That'll be my watch.
 I like the like the make Chuck E.
 Cheese the rockifier.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 And I'll have a rockifier.
 Yeah.
 Of course also.
 And a man.
  And a Chuck band.
 What are they called.
 Oh Munch's make believe they make believe man make believe band as well.
 I'm going to need a lot of this is less of a home than a compound.
 Yeah.
 I'll have to buy the silver or the Skywalker vineyards something like a childish play like a Neverland ranch type place.
 Yeah.
 Absolutely.
  It's got your Neverland ranch.
 I should buy the ranch.
 You should buy the ranch.
 Hey let's all go in on the ranch.
 I'll take care of it.
 Come visit me.
 It's only four and a half hours away.
 Sure.
 By helicopter.
 Nothing weird is going on.
 It's totally cool there.
 No nothing weird is going on.
  It's a thing you say when nothing very normal very regular.
 Would you buy if you could buy if you could buy it in any Disneyland or Disney theme park item.
 Kyle what's what do you what are you getting.
 I don't I don't have an answer prepared.
 It's a heavy question certainly.
 How about something from start to if you could remove an item from Star Tours any era.
  I just I don't know.
 I just I some of the robots.
 Sure.
 The answer is fighting in your living.
 You just plug them in to argue.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Certainly the G2 with the droids room boombox.
 Oh man.
 And there's just like a door in a little room in the house that that's just going all day.
 Power being wasted.
 But anytime you wanted to open it up and get a little.
  Hi I think I know you.
 Those are the bits that that droid is doing by the way he's just like roasting people that walk past him.
 Yeah.
 And just a lot of like I really like working here.
 Oh yeah.
 And then like the yeah then you'll hear on the big speaker like there seems to be an issue on sector five.
 The droid is not working accurate or something.
  That's it.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Much like an airport airport employee.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 All right.
 Well I got it.
 Get some dry.
 Somebody get Kyle some droids and Kyle Mooney you survived podcast the ride one of our one of the longest episodes and I thank you for but of course there was no other way.
  This is an epic.
 I'm sure there are other ways to do that.
 A concise.
 Time has to be wasted.
 Yeah.
 Plan it said to be listed.
 Officer Zizek said they had to get a full 15 minutes.
 But yeah thanks for coming and sharing your memories anything you'd like to to promote or send people to anybody listening.
  Yeah well you could see this movie we referenced early earlier Briggs we bears on Briggs we bear is on Amazon and iTunes.
 So great.
 And that's pretty much.

  Yeah.
 I do.
 I do wish that is how the show was.
 I do have you pitched to Darryl Hammond like she said it like this tonight.
 Yeah I do think I think he I think you get the best Darryl Hammond's pronunciation.
 Are you a real strong.
 Kyle Mooney.
  Yeah that's nice to you.
