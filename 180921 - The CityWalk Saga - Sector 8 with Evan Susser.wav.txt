 Forever.

  Dog.
  When your town has let you down  When your port has fallen short  When you're too worn out to run  And need some ribs or a Cinnabon  You need a place, a place for rock  A place for roll, a place where Oakland Raiders merch is sold  A sublime hot topic and bill of bond  A place where you can purchase a candy thong  So let's go take a walk  Let's all go to City Walk  Tonight, tonight  Hey, it's gonna be great.
  It's gonna be great.
  I was really all business there on that intro, that's the way.
  We gotta get to the guests.
 We gotta get to this, cuz, let's be honest.
  This is a lot of content.
  Yeah, um, let's bring them in.
  Ladies and gentlemen, you know him as Screenwriter, you know him from Dough Boys, you know him from just being a good guy.
  His name's Evan Suser.
  Hey guys, happy to be here.
  Welcome back.
  to think of my own hosted by three men who come on well guys we gotta have one  I feel like that's a signature we kind of really hired it for these so that we  could just get to business and also so we didn't have to think of 19 jokes.
 Guys I'm honored I love it a big  special event it's important obviously I'm associated with a big you know podcast event spectacular  yeah the Doughboys tournament of champions so that's why I was very  honored when you guys asked me to be the sector keeper and I'm thrilled.
 Bad news for you my man  hmm president sector keeper.
 Okay I'll take it.
 Well there's a guy I mean look how could we not choose this guy to be the  sector keeper he is the sector keeper that's his name.
 He's the ghost child.
 He's the ghost child who died in the fountain.
  So it's this is rough okay we'll power through.
 Do you think you can adjust? I can't.
 This is like getting news of a tragedy.
  Yeah I mean I don't know this probably come out already in the episodes that have already aired we were recording this  this spectacular has not yet begun I really thought I we agreed that I was I was gonna be the sector keeper I don't know who this new the original sector keeper is.
  Well didn't you wonder why we hadn't asked you to do anything yeah now well I kind of figured it was kind of my place to decide what I wanted to do.
  Does every anytime you go on a podcast that ended event do you assume that you'll be some sort of a basically I think that's a reasonable assumption for me to make I mean you can't argue with success guys.
  That's true but after the stunts you pulled on that ice cream invitational I don't know.
 I don't want to hear controversial.
 Guys let's get into it.
  You said on the other podcast you did our podcast this is a different type of podcast.
 This is a different type of podcast.
 This isn't full of antics this is this is a full straight ahead.
  We're rule followers and when the sector keeper has already been set up and dictated all the confines of this thing we can't switch that now.
 Yes.
  But I mean also feel free to if you boss us around in any regard.
 I'll do a little bit of bossing.
 We were too timid to clarify my bit did not work as well because I didn't realize in the lure of this podcast you're doing it that just the sector keeper is just a person.
  Oh you didn't know that.
 Oh yeah.
 I thought it was like an actor or a person who has that title.
 He's a real child.
 He's a boy.
  I didn't.
 I didn't claim as the sector keeper.
  This podcast hasn't gotten fantastical yet because it has.
 I did not know.
 There's a precedent.
 You know what? I'm saying that the podcast is fantastical.
 I am thrilled to hear it's fantastical.
  So episode four was a fantastical episode.
 Fantastic.
 So that's what I'm saying.
 After our after the smash hit debut of our first character right.
  Bugsy bones.
 Yeah.
 We figured why not go full tilt character.
 Well I could show you a Reddit message board that might explain why.
  Oh but you could show me that about anything.
 Well here why don't we then turn to our character.
 I mean our real boy that we know to give us the assignment of today's sector.
  Boys boys and you today's sector sector eight Abercrombie and Fitch it's sugar Sam Goody a former NASCAR thing the King Kong on the it's sugar and the fountains I died in.
 Good luck boys.
  Right there we have it.
 Well that one's complicated and it's it's it's rough for him to talk about because this sector does include the dancing fountains that gave the sector keep.
  Yeah it will have infection that brought him into the limbo state that he is currently in.
 I have a question.
 Yes.
 In that short pause that we just did.
  Right.
 Did something play.
 Yes for the listener.
 Yes because here there was just silence.
 The obviously you didn't let the power of the sector keeper into your heart.
  He spoke.
 Oh it's kind of like the Peter Pan play where you have to clap and believe in fairies.
 You didn't see him.
 It's exactly like this is I know I don't believe and I guess you aren't an adult child like we are.
  Now I see what's going on.
 You came in here thinking you were like a Deadpool like character and you were going to break the fourth wall left and right.
 Call stuff out not play into the reality of the situation and kudos to you.
  I know where this is going.
 I can see what's going to happen here.
 So yes.
 The answer is yes.
 You're a chop buster.
  All right guys.
 I'm coming in hot.
 I'm coming in hot to this podcast.
 I'm sorry I was a much better guess the first time I did it where I wanted to play in your playground.
  Now I'm asking you to play in mine but let us get to the sector.
 OK well we can experiment in a 19 part series.
  I'm not going to cut this.
 There's no time to cut things for this.
 No we got to get it up and out.
 Well so well here maybe we should talk a little bit about the dancing fountains which well let's let's inform our guests this sector.
  Just a reminder.
 We've done the reminders in every single one every single time.
 But you're probably right that we should because people might have zoned out.
  People skip just four.
 I don't know why anyone would bail.
 A lot of Susser fans are going to be tuning in just for this one.
  All right.
 That's a sereno out there.
 Abercrombie the dancing fountains.
 It's sugar.
 Well no he read the sectors.
 We don't have to read them again.
  I was doing it for the gas.
 Oh man this is a disaster.
 This all stays in.
 Do you want to play.
 Do you want to play your music.
 He has a boombox on him.
  We recap before we started what you know what I know.
 I came prepared.
 I did research.
 If you would concentrate and listen to the sector keeper he would have reminded you.
 OK.
  That's on me.
 But what you maybe don't know is that the disease ridden fountain gave him a staph infection.
 Oh sure sure sure.
 This limbo.
 No I know that.
  But the day.
 How do you guys who have not been killed by the fountains feel about the fountains.
 We're starting with the fountains.
 We're starting with the fountains.
  Well how do I feel about that.
 I love the fountains.
 I mean the fountains like that add some what they call kinetic energy.
 You know when you're talking about theme park you need movement.
 OK.
  So when you get in that big square there's all these little waters moving there's lights going like that's great.
 What does there not to like about the fountain.
 Yeah.
  And recently redone in the last few years by the same company Disney uses for the world of color.
 Here's here's my one.
 And I'm very happy with the sector that I have.
  Yeah.
 I'll just say that off the top.
 I think that when you think city walk the things in my sector I think are probably pretty close to the front of your mind.
  Absolutely.
 I think the dead center it's in the dead center.
 It is the heart of city walk the fountains.
 Here's the thing with fountains.
 There are two types of fountains.
  I think there are fountains that you play in as kids and there are fountains like the Bellagio fountains that you watch the fountains of city walker kind of in between where it's like kids do play in them.
  But also they're kind of like you watch them.
 For me I wonder what would be the ideal fountain for.
 Do you think they're perfect as is.
  You mean like is there a plus up to the fountain.
 Do you want something more.
 Are you saying it's caught in between you'd rather either participate or view to view.
 Yes.
  Okay.
 I mean I think though the here's what I think your problem is is that we cannot participate as adult adult men in their 30s.
 Even adult men who embrace the empires and love them.
  I would agree with that.
 It's a little yeah the closest I came to participating in something that I shouldn't have is when Jason and I went in that tunnel that's in the Grizzly Challenge Trail at Disney's California Adventure.
  That's usually just like a Chuck E Cheese tunnel.
 It's out where you can like climb on ropes and bridges and stuff.
 And you and I went in this tunnel.
 Right.
  That's where you go to find out your spirit animal.
 Right.
 Exactly.
 But that's fine to do.
 But I went in the tunnel and I went I should not have gone in that tunnel.
 That's for children.
 So that's the closest I've come to doing something like this.
  Enclosed space.
 Do you think it's okay to goof around in like a water area with significant other.
  Wait a minute.
 So if like your girlfriend to 30 year olds were frolicking around in the summer.
 What a very cute.
 I think if it feels organic.
 But if you if it's obvious that you plan I think do this center like staying there for a while.
  I think the size of the fountain at City Walk it's pretty small.
 That dictates the size of the person that should be in it.
 If it was a bigger fountain that was fun and shooting water then maybe you and Zoe Deschanel could frolic.
  But no not this one.
 This is not appropriate frolic for 30 year olds.
 Yeah it doesn't feel like a romantic fountain.
 It does feel kid oriented.
 But I see what you're saying that the colors are the cult the light show that's been added.
  It makes it seem like a show.
 It makes it feel like a nightclub or something.
 But a bunch of if like you know a dozen adults all stormed that thing that'd be creepy as hell.
 So you want firmer fountain lines is what you're saying.
  Do you have a fountain you prefer anywhere.
 Blasio.
 That's what I want.
 Yeah we're all about Vegas baby.
 But it's so big.
 There's not the room.
 Well yes that's an issue.
  I wish I could play in this Belasio fountains.
 Hey can I argue with that.
 Hey all right.
 I wish you could play there also.
 But be careful as the sector keeper knows.
 Let me say this.
 Those fountains as you mentioned Jason.
  Although I saw conflict I saw information saying they did not do the world of color.
 Oh I saw that specifically pointed out on a message board.
 What sources.
 That person could be wrong.
 I'm not totally sure.
 Yours was a message.
  It is a dense.
 The website for wet design is dense and has every possible credit of everything they did.
 So that would be so what are they credited.
 All as the city walk fountain city walk fountain but not world of color not world of color.
  Is it what I saw.
 Should we also make this a world of color episode or is that going to be too long.
 We have to ask the sector keeper.
 I think it's probably a different sector being that it's in a different city and county.
 Also we try to be conscious of sustainability of not doing five things.
  So the fountains at the Grove also made by this company the Bellagio fountains made by the same company and the Americana buzz buzz and the largest fountain in the world in Dubai which is at a mall I think also called City Walk though it's not affiliated with.
  Wow really city walks but these were all done by a place called wet design.
 Let me tell you another thing about wet design.
 A couple years ago I think 2012 the headquarters up in Burbank burnt to the ground.
 Whoa.
 Yeah.
  Wow.
 So all of ironically.
 The one water show they forgot the design.
 So car in the middle of the night crashed into a power transformer and which in all and live wires in the building got tripped and it burnt to the ground.
 Is it possible this is the age old theme park trick of burning something down for insurance money.
  Mike you're one step ahead of about 10 years prior the company's former headquarters also.
 What I was right.
 Something weird.
 Yep.
 Yep.
 This company to also is a theme park trick though.
 Yeah.
 This is a classic and their headquarters used to be at Universal Studios.
  Oh interesting.
 Universal Studios has been prone as we've discussed right to many odd fires over the years.
 Odd fires.
 Now I don't want to start throwing around you know any libelous words about the people behind wet design but it's a little odd.
  It was in the middle of the night.
 No one was there.
 So nobody died in a mysterious car just crashed into a pole.
 Doesn't that seem like the kind of thing that could be.
 Yes.
 Very suspicious.
 Staged like a water fountain show.
  The first thing I think water fountain.
 I was thinking of like disaster.
 I was thinking of like a disaster like the underground subway crash.
 That's what it does.
  Like the pole falls awkwardly onto the sparks.
 According to the police report the pole tilted and stuttered a couple times and then hit the transformer.
 They had five 10 gallon drums just sitting there that shot flames out of them.
 And a voice somewhere said oh no look but nobody could see who said it.
  Wow.
 Seemed pre-recorded.
 Man.
 So some oddity when you look into the old fountains.
 But.
 So they have still do we know their headquarters has been rebuilt.
 Is it in Burbank still.
 I think so because as I said a robust list of dancing fountains.
 This is the dancing fountain place.
  Also Epcot center back in the day.
 Oh.
 Journey into imagination.
 The leapfrog.
 Oh I would play those as a child.
 Even though you weren't really supposed they were kind of on you know planters and stuff.
 So easy to jump up and hit the water as it goes.
  Me and my brother would just kill like an hour just like doing that.
 So is that a superior fountain to you.
 Yeah.
 I mean I think all of the fountains that you've named are better than the city walk one.
  But do you.
 I mean it's like the classic like when they like hire like someone who's like done really good stuff it's like oh this is like the guy who like you know who directed this movie and that movie oh it's going to be great.
  I was like ugh.
 We got the Bellagio guy.
 That's the way this was sold.
 We got the Bellagio guys to do the city walk fountains.
 Is that your fear going into a meeting that fist fight is your Bellagio fountains and people will be disappointed by your pathetic spurts on people's heads.
  Yeah.
 Yeah exactly.
 I think he had a limited amount of space.
 They had a limited amount of space to work with here and I think they should not be held accountable for not living up to the standard of the Bellagio fountain.
  This is like a tiny rectangle.
 I like the fountains and I like that they've kept them there as opposed to the cowards behind cosmic waves at New Tomorrowland which was replaced long ago.
 It's only that rotating orb.
  Yeah.
 I guess just because the area under it became a receptacle of piss and poo and I don't even want to say the other fluids.
 No don't say it.
  And this is one of the they took away one of the water the bodies of water outside of the billabong store.
 So this is one of the last water things left at City Walk.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
  So I say keep it up.
 I think do you are you just do you think no color.
 No color is good.
 I guess the fountains are fine.
 But you just wanted something more impressive.
 You want something.
 I feel like left first of all left out of playing in them.
  Yes.
 I want to be a little more wowed by them.
 I think that and we'll get to you know the other parts but like you know I think that it's not one of the like premier attractions of City Walk the fountains.
 Yeah.
  Well they're still redoing stuff.
 This is not in the sector but the dragon could like shoot water out of its mouth or something toward the fountain like there's probably some yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and the dragon should have it they should have a light on it to make it orange.
  So it looks like it's like fire.
 Yes.
 Literally pointed at.
 Yeah.
 Maybe at a certain point they were thinking they were talking but then of course like dropping like a gallon of water from two stories up might like knock a kid down.
  Also in California is constantly in drought.
 That doesn't bother me as much as the kid getting hit in the head.
 We need this.
 But that could be like it's really missing.
  And then the red and it would look like it's good.
 Yeah.
 Well we plus that up.
 Yeah.
 That's a really good plus.
 Yeah.
 I'm into it.
 Well let's talk about the thing right behind the fountains which is the clothing store Abercrombie and Fitch.
  You guys have a lot of Abercrombie and Fitch.
 I spent a half hour in this Abercrombie and Fitch.
 Is it because you got lost because it's no no it is it is and we've I it's hard.
 Yeah I never went in it before.
  And it is like every other Abercrombie and Fitch store.
 It smells of cologne very strong cologne or perfume.
 I don't think I lasted 10 minutes because that fucking smell like I know is so aggressive.
 I've heard the jokes for you.
 I never really shopped at Abercrombie.
  And so I went into this one and yeah I lasted about 10 minutes and I was like this smells awful.
 They used to have just like a shirtless guy.
  Shirtless guy.
 That wasn't just City Walk that was all Abercrombies and I think it maybe was the movie Neighbors where you know Zac Efron that's the job that he gets and Zac Efron and Seth Rogan does it at the end.
  I think that maybe was like the final lampooning of that of that thing of having the dude decide because I will say with the shirtless guys I feel like of course it belongs to City Walk without the shirtless guys.
 It's kind of like why is this here.
  It felt like the ghost of like 10 years ago.
 Like none of the styles were very old.
 There was just so many like rugby shirts.
 There's a lot of rugby shirts.
 Everything is priced like at a higher rate.
 Everything felt like unique low quality but priced like $20 more.
  They had floral prints which some listeners might know.
 I'm way into floral now which is not.
 I'm not at the forefront of this.
 I'm just saying in the last few months I got way into the floral stuff.
 So they had some styles that looked a little bit more current.
  A little better.
 The one shirt I did want to buy they did not have in my size.
 So I have to mark them down for that.
  I was looking at like they just had regular you know Oxford casual button up shirts.
 They were so thick.
 It was like really weird.
 It was like Oxford beefy tea.
 Yeah essentially it was I don't know everything.
 Everything about this place rubbed me the wrong way and how empty it was.
  Mine was not empty when I was in there.
 I do think this is going to like accidentally fit in the new city walk that seems to be coming which is more like Fossil and Sephora.
 It's going to look more like a regular mall.
 So it's going it is I feel like it sticks out in the old city walk.
  But now I think it's going to magically fit because it's going to just be a lot of stores that are in a regular shopping mall.
 So how does it.
 It's very disappointing.
 Yeah there's no this existing never.
 This doesn't have what does this have a fun thing outside.
  Is there a surfboard or anything over the top of the white chatter in the kayak inside.
 I will say to go back a little bit the neighbor scene to which you refer was filmed at that location.
  So of course if this if you consider this the peak of Abercrombie and culture you would have to call this like the ultimate Abercrombie because that moment was captured for that film.
 I think they also had some lawsuits about their hiring and I think that's correct.
  Were you one of them.
 No well no because I wasn't even in consideration because like that was what the lawsuits were about like only hot people work here only people willing to take their shirts off in the shirtless audition.
  If they were still doing that we should all go and try to get the job.
  Sure.
  Well be good but they're not doing it anymore so well.
 Yeah we can't.
 I don't know that's about it.
 Someone else will have to sell their dog shit clothing.
  What I don't like about Abercrombie being at City Walk is I feel like City Walk is LA California baby and Abercrombie I feel like it's such an East Coast look and style.
 It's like Cape Cod the Hamptons.
 Colin Jost in the Hamptons.
 It's Colin Jost in the Hamptons.
 Yeah I see what you're saying.
 I'm conflicted because I know he is fashion.
  Wait now is he not football.
 Not football but he is fashion.
 All right.
 Is there any way is there some video that would prove which one he is or not.
  I guess we can only dream right.
 I hope if one exists let me know.
 But but yeah I guess because they have Bill LeBong which is very California surfer dude guy and there's that other one that's I can't think of the name of it that's like that.
  Oh the skate shop.
 Yeah the other skate shop that's very skateshield California.
 I think this area is covered and this is in a prime sector as we said the heart of City Walk.
 The heart of City Walk.
 It's a real bar.
 The heart of City Walk.
 Yep.
  And as you were now the Evan you were the heart of this series covering the heart of City Walk.
 But not the sector keeper.
 Not the sector keeper.
 He's the brains or the he's the soul of the series.
 Yeah yeah yeah.
  You're the brains.
 I think it's a bummer that that's like this primary location right in the center especially because it used to be a Sam Goody.
 This was like a landmark.
 What's the word for like when flagship.
  Flagship.
 It's a flagship.
 It was a flagship Sam Goody.
 Multiple stories and you feel when you're in that Abercrombie it feels claustrophobic.
 Yeah low ceilings but big floor space.
 Sam Goody makes more sense.
 It used to be multiple stories.
 I think they've turned some of that space into City Walk or universal offices.
  I think some of that is probably where I took my test and got my training to be a tour guide.
 Was it former Sam Goody.
 Yes I think so.
 But it was like you know it was big enough.
 It was like the Times Square Virgin Megastore.
 It felt very Megastore-esque.
 Wow.
  Like there were events and signings there.
 I tried to find out what some of those were.
 I didn't find a lot but here's a quick list.
 Some of peak culture of the 90s and 2000s happened at the same Goody.
 Hanson performed in store.
 No authority performed in store.
 Were they like also run boy band or I don't remember what no authority.
 I mean it's.
  I'm looking it up.
 That doesn't even.
 They were a boy band though.
 They were in the mold of.
 But I could be wrong.
 Also could be like OC skater punk but I'm not totally sure.
 Todd McFarlane did a Spawn signing there.
 Smash Mouth in store performance.
 And this legitimately cooled that Ricardo Maltabon did a signing for the DVD release of Wrath of Collin.
 Wow.
 Sam Goody.
 I'd like to go to that still.
 Hey Scott's going to be very excited about this.
  No authority was an American boy band who was signed to Michael Jackson's record label.
 MJJ Music.
 What.
 I don't think I know about his record label.
 Michael Jackson's record label.
 What else is on MJJ.
 Well we got to go down the rabbit hole.
 All right.
 Hmm.
 So they like.
 Yeah because there was this other one that was comprised of like Tito and Jermaine's kids.
 And Michael does a hook on one of their songs.
 That one's a that one's iffy.
 What was that?  Well we're no we're no authority kind of like were they like a bunch of like Aaron Carter.
 They look like that.
 Yeah.
 Blonde bleach blonde kids.
 All right.
 Brownstone.
 Don't know that authority.
 Rebi Jackson.
 OK well that's Jackson.
 Tatiana Ali.
 Oh yeah she did.
 Oh yeah.
 Men of Vision VIZ ION.
 Hmm.
 Good spelling.
 Brownstone.
 Quo Q U O.
 Quo.
  Three T.
 Quo is a new Star Wars character.
 That's an episode nine.
 Greg Grunberg is playing quo.
 I wish they would put.
 I wish Greg would be a new character in each episode.
 Yeah that looks like the major ones.
 Oh right.
 The heavy hitters of MJJ Music.
 So yeah this that's a close.
  Late 90s early 2000s.
 But that was bad.
 I also what I remember is a lot of like really good like a bit like the big row of listening stations.
 Just think I haven't thought about in a minute.
 I miss the CD store listening stations.
 I understand why there's no reason to have them now.
 But what is a new music store because they're not selling CDs.
 What's an I like what could what could go because I feel like that would be great at City Walk like a music.
  Like if there was an Amoeba location.
 Amoeba is too dirty for City Walk.
 Not used.
 They can't be used at City Walk.
 Apple Music Experience.
 I don't know what this is but they got to have some music at City Walk.
 Why because I miss this in general.
 I would go kill a lot of time in music stores and because you know you have books to leaf through and magazines and the listening stations and you could like you could spend a lot of time in them.
 I guess I understand why they're not around.
  But I mean I guess like posters and t-shirts but also but that's what Sam Goody had.
 Yeah.
 That's what was some of those other music land.
 Well records.
 Vinyl's made a big comeback in the last decade or so.
 So yeah I guess it's like probably like vinyl and t-shirts and Funko pops of like Lemmy from Motorhead and other store that sells Funko.
 I mean City Walk needs more Funko.
 Yeah.
 But they've also got the Hard Rock retail store.
  So music's a little covered and Hot Topic has a lot of bands and socks with bands and there's plenty of sock stores.
 It's pretty hard to think of an all new experience for City Walk to have.
 And just putting in an Apple I think would be would be dull.
 Yeah.
 But they might do that because they're doing dull stuff now.
  Music brings up an experience I had when I was up there sort of walking through this hardest city walk.
 I saw a band.
 There was a band set up.
 You know they got the live music throughout the walkways and stuff.
 And this band had an accordion player to violinists and they were playing all star.
  Wait that's it? I think there was a guy on either keyboards or bass but it was just the oddest combination.
 And the park had just let out so there was a huge crowd that was giving them a very wide berth to like there was like a huge group watching them but gave them like 20 feet of space.
  All Star might be the perfect song for City Walk.
 That's got me thinking because the other All Star.
  You're in the shadow of Shrek as it is.
  Despacito is another thing that I think of City Walk.
 And then of course the song Gasolina has been mentioned.
 But also A Different Way by DJ Snake featuring Lauv.
 I looked the name up of this song.
 I Shazam this song because it's been playing so many times when I was at City Walk.
  Can we play five seconds of it real quick?  Yeah it samples like Bollywood music too.
 You probably yeah forget what it is.
 It's called A Different Way.
 A Different Way.
  And what can we play three seconds before we get sued? I don't know we've broken that rule with plenty of music.
 We've played much of the Winnie the Pooh for President.
 Yeah and that's let's see here.
  It's the video.
  This sounds familiar.
 It's like that same production on the Justin Bieber's Sorry or something.
 Yeah yeah yeah.
 Those little plunks.
 I'll tell you some music I've heard at City Walk.
  I mean come on we have to play a little bit of it.
 We gotta play a legally clearable amount of one of the finest songs.
 A band that I've seen at City Walk that I've spent a lot of time thinking about is a guy named C.
G.
 Reich.
  If you're at not only Universal City Walk.
 I went to Jewish summer camp with him.
  I think he's significantly older but I don't know.
 He's a counselor or something.
 C.
G.
 Reich at Universal City Walk or Downtown Disneyland.
 If you're ever walking past and you see a guy with just a giant armada of every type of drum and bongo and gong and wind chime making like super generic world question mark music.
  It's usually C.
G.
 Reich.
 The pilot the first episode of Moonbeam City was devoted to this kind of music and the fact that you hear this kind of a name and stuff in that like Third Street Promenade.
  I love that kind of bullshit.
 Really.
 Another thing that I like you know the guys with the glasses where it's like they fill in like different levels of water or they're just putting their finger around the glass.
  I love that.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Guys like they have to set up.
 It takes an hour and a half to set up what they're doing.
 They can't be getting paid that much money for it.
  Seventy nine drums.
 And the first time you see something like that you were blown away and then every time after you just walk by it.
  Only with that stuff like playing the saw as well.
 One one.
 But I would just encourage every one performers at City Walk.
 Huh.
 Yeah.
 They have them.
 They do.
 Yeah.
 Because this guy I like.
 Yeah.
 Jason.
  Yeah.
 The accordion and the violin.
 They're on like the stage.
 Are you saying they're in the center court.
 They have crossed from the fountains.
 And I guess I have seen this a little bit.
 And then a little further down there was a guy playing like jazz sax with like a backing music.
  And then one person just one a single person watching them for like multiple songs.
 But they were into it.
 I wish they would have more like dance sax like in the Third Street Promenade because it's always usually just like an acoustic singer songwriter or a musician.
  But like on the Third Street Promenade you'll see like a guy in a bodysuit with a cage and you won't know what's going on.
 And like he's setting something up.
 I left my left the volume on.
 He'll be setting something up and it's like usually a letdown.
  This happens over in Burbank too.
 There'll be guys in like glow suits and they're like warming up for something.
 And you're like holy shit what's going to happen here.
 And then like it comes out and they're like just bad break dancing for 15 minutes.
  And like OK well that wasn't worth it.
 Well Burbank also gives street licenses to the evangelists.
 To like people screaming about the power of the Lord.
  Yeah I'm not advocating that CityWalk have those people.
 I'm not advocating.
 But you know what.
 Maybe it wouldn't be so bad.
  Make it feel like a real city.
 Well you know that Comic Con vibe.
 Right.
 You got a lot of people yelling about repent sinner at Comic Con.
 One of the best parts.
  Actually they're actually legitimately seeing then like you know like a hundred Spider-Men all jog by in some flash mob.
 Some forced viral event passed all the people who would listen to repent sins.
  I've never seen any jogging at the Comic Con from the Comic Con crew.
 A hundred Spider-Men eating hamburgers.
  A hundred Spider-Man doing a very lazy rendition of the backpack kid dance.
  So you're saying up the street performance game.
 Yeah.
 We were covered in the 79 drums territory but let's get some crazy pop.
 Yeah let's get some contortionists.
  Yeah some dancers and some just performance art in general.
 Because you have to audition for it.
 I've looked at the form.
 Some comedians like in the New York subway.
 Like comedians.
  Does that happen? Well I think that I mean those you have to like how you're trapped in the space.
 You do.
 I've seen the form to apply.
 I think I did say we should apply and do something.
  Well because we've discussed what we really wanted was to play at Margaritaville.
 Right.
 To be like a band that plays on that little Margaritaville stage.
  As long as Margaritaville stays open for another year we can do it.
 Will it? I don't know.
 And especially as desperation climbs.
 Yes.
 They will need to lower the bar to people who are.
  I would describe myself as like a 12% musician.
 What percentage would you put yourself at? Oh I got 60.
 Yeah.
 70 maybe.
 That's either right.
 And Jason.
  Susser's making a face like that's not right.
 Slow down.
 Trumpet, guitar.
 I can kind of play the drums.
 Piano.
 Get a trumpet right now.
 I don't have one with me.
 I didn't know about the trumpet.
 I played in band for years.
  Well a mark of a good trumpet would be owning a trumpet.
 Someone who's a 70% of a trumpet player owns a trumpet.
  I break out in sweat when having to sing in like performance basis.
 Oh and we made you.
 We gave you a solo in the live show.
 That may have been what I prepared for the most in that live show.
  That's very funny.
 Ah ah here we go go go.
 So I don't know but why shouldn't we be allowed.
 Oh yeah we should.
 That together those percentages equal nearly three quarters of one musician.
  And Jason takes us down a little bit but that's okay.
 It's not that much.
 All right.
 So if you want to hear some Jimmy Buffett fan fiction songs.
 Yeah.
 About how he hates the moon because it's the opposite of the sun.
 And what's one of yours Mike?  One of my songs.
 These are real songs we've written.
 Mine is called Hiding Out in a Pelican's Beak and it's about when you cheat on your wife or girlfriend and then you have to get away from her and you hide out in a pelican's beak.
  Does this imply that you shrink yourself to do so? No.
 It's a giant pelican because they have a big beak.
 Neat.
 Yeah so we'll do that eventually.
 Yeah and if you let us know on Twitter if you want to hear those songs or if we should shut up forever.
  Susser vote.
 I have heard Hiding Out in a Pelican's Beak and I will say it's beautiful.
 Wow.
 And it is it is the kind of thing that makes you say well the person who did this is at least 60 or 70 percent of musicians.
  Well you haven't heard I Hate the Moon parentheses.
 It's the opposite of the sun because it is not written.
 I like the direction.
 I like the direction.
 Yeah yeah it's a good area.
 I'll keep at it.
  Well let's keep at this sector moving on to well I guess It's Sugar.
 Oh well how would you guys say the name of this store? Because written out if the audience doesn't have it in front of them it's I T apostrophe S U G A R.
  But what how what do you think is the proper pronunciation? You know I'm not a hundred percent sure but I do want to make sure to get it right in order to you know pay proper respect to a modern day playground dedicated to immersing its customers in content that they just can't keep to themselves.
  Is that what it's that real? That is there this is us.
 That is there about us.
 Created to satisfy a universal sweet tooth.
 A place as the place where candy obsessed come to indulge in the sights smells and tastes of their favorite sweets and get immersed in the brand's irreverent voice and fun loving nature.
  And come is spelled C O M E right? Yes.
 Okay good.
 They did not they did not take my note.
 But with apostrophes after every letter.
 Yeah.
 I say it's sugar but I guess you could say it it sugar.
 It sugar.
 It sugar.
 It like it girl.
 Yeah sugar.
  But you don't space I guess that implies that it's one thing there's no space it's not it's sugar.
 It's it's sugar.
 It's sugar.
 It's sugar.
 No I say it's sugar.
 I say it too.
 I know you're not supposed to but I'm an adult.
 But is it like a sassy is it like a sassy F it sugar.
 It sugar.
 Like is it a sassy affect.
 You know what I'm saying.
 Yeah.
 Like it's sugar.
 No I don't think so.
 No you think it's sugar.
  You think it's that.
 Yeah I know sugar.
 You think it's said maybe.
 What do you think.
 How do you think you say it.
 I think it's just it's sugar.
 That's not right.
 That's for sure.
 Not right.
 Because it's like it it is it sugar.
 Like that's what it is to me.
 I think it's sugar.
 That's what I think it is.
 No wrong way to say it except Jason Jason says for sure wrong.
 It's too sterile.
 But here is my thought about it.
 It sugar is both the best and worst.
  Candy shop in the world.
 Yeah.
 Yes I agree.
 I'm glad you guys are on board.
 I wish Jeff Rubin CEO and chief gummy bear.
 I just read that now.
 Whoa what.
 This is his title.
 This is the title Jeff Rubin founder CEO and chief gummy bear.
 You are the chief gummy bear of this podcast.
 Yeah that goes without saying.
 I'm not arguing with that.
  I mean I'm kind of I was more distracted.
 The reason I probably didn't process that is because he created he also created a candy business for FAO Schwartz long since gone under called FAO coming back though.
  FAO Schwartz is it.
 Yeah.
 But is but is sweet sweet.
 Perfect for city walk.
 That is over Abercrombie.
 There it is.
 And also sorry New York.
 You lose.
 You lose.
 It's the new effort is going into Times Square.
 This is probably we're careful about not saying anything slanderous about anyone.
  But I would not in 2018 if I was a male powerful CEO.
 I just I'm not implying it was a Jeff Rubin was.
 I'm not implying anything about Jeff Rubin.
 I just think that a lot of these stories you just I don't think you want to be going around telling people to call them chief little hugger.
  Yeah I just think it's a bad territory to be in.
 I'll tell you this.
 There's a place where that sort of body this little more flies a little more.
 And that's where it sugar was founded Atlantic City New Jersey.
  I've been to that store.
 I don't know if it's the original location but I've been to the sugar in Atlantic City.
 It looks like all of the other it sugars which is kind of a knock against it.
 Another thing that a knock against it.
 You don't see any candy being made.
 All of this stuff is boxed or in bulk.
  Yes.
 Do you candy store.
 Do you see candy being made.
 Oh let me do it.
 In the decades and decades old Atlantic City saltwater taffy and fudge shops.
 It's right in the front.
 That's a feature.
  That's a feature.
 Different type.
 Like you know there's not a bunch of people like making runs in the front of the store.
 That's true but wasn't it.
 That's a detailed process that you couldn't you need a factory.
 Even if they're not making it you could have like they do have the bulk candy but it's not as like overwhelming and seeing the candy.
  This sums up it sugar to me.
 I bought for my dear friend and your dear friend Mike Mitchell.
 One of the big novelty boxes of sour patch kids.
 Yes and it's big and it's funny.
 And what are you imagining.
 I don't know if you've ever gotten that.
 What are you imagining if you open that up.
  I don't know the answer to this.
 Yes.
 I hold box.
 Overflowing or like just one big one.
 They sound like some just one big one one.
 No.
 No.
 Instead it's just a somewhat large bag of sour patch kids.
 That's it.
 It's just like it's so much box and nothing else.
 It's just empty space of the box.
  It's the most disappointing thing to open.
 But man how fun is that big box.
 It's very fun.
 How fun is it to see all those big novelty candies.
 Seeing a giant there was a giant watermelon slice made out made out of gummy.
 Yeah that would be great.
  It was like maybe I was scared of it because of because I'm scared of big things in small spaces.
 I think I was just like it was just so thick.
 It was like deep dish pizza but gummy which seems like you would get in what scenario you have to like wrap that up and save it for later.
 You're never going to in one sitting eat.
 Right.
  It's like a thick two inch thick gummy slice.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 To bring this back to what we talked about in my first episode was here.
 Hershey Park.
 Yeah.
 Those big Hershey bar is like now you're talking very sad.
 Very sad.
  Beautiful.
 Everything from it sugar or it sugar.
 Not so satisfying but fun.
 My wife and I are many times when we've had like a birthday party or something that were that's coming up.
 We've said let's get something like if we're by city walk and we know that's like happening.
  We're like oh let's get something from for them at it sugar.
 It'll be like a funny gift to show up with and it's kind of disappointing.
 No one's really ever that happy to get it.
  I speaking of disappointment I for all of you for this record bought a bag of candy there which was a bag of orange trumps.
 It was the packaging explains that the flavor is is huge.
 It explained that it is it is made in China.
  There was a lot of fun going on there and then I forgot I left it.
 I also thought I was to get something and I forgot to do.
 I thought so too but I didn't.
 Yeah.
 You bring up you bring up my point I guess that I was going to make is that this is pretty close to like a Spencer's  gifts as well and that's some of the least fun things in my mind but also fun to talk about like the the amount of like there's so if you've never been here inside in the middle is essentially the bulk candy is you what I'm talking about like a lot of gummy stuff runs you know candy covered chocolate covered stuff.
  Oh I got a lot on those that's all candy bins on the outside is like more box stuff you have your like giant novelty boxes your regular boxes of things and then in the back toward the back like right like straight back are all of like your Spencer's gag gifts and stuff and that's you know as I say as we say in the song the candy thought you can buy a candy thong and bathing suit for who someone I don't know who would be.
  I also thought what if in the episode I open my shirt and reveal I was wearing a candy bikini top that'd be funny.
 Yeah but then I would have had to you also probably would have like heard it rattling around under my shirt I forget if I hugged any of you upon seeing you tonight but you would have like heard a big crunch as our bodies pressed against each other.
  You are a chief hugger chief little hugger.
 I don't know what that word is I just like hugs.
 But anyway I'm sure the CEO who founded his company in Atlantic City and goes by chief gummy bear.
 There's nothing sketchy about it.
 There's nothing weird.
 But here's what I'll say about it sugar.
  It can disappoint yes but if I go to city walk I am walking in you got a girl.
 I don't walk in it might be my favorite retail store at City Walk.
  I mean that is like you guys are right FAO Schwartz would be perfect for City Walk these stores that like they might not necessarily sell a lot of stuff but a lot of people like to window shop there.
 Yeah I like the bulk candy in the store I like you know being able to mix and match stuff and like if you don't want that much you can just get a little sure.
  But a couple of things happen when I was up there one I saw them open up the cabinets underneath the bulk candy.
 You're about to ruin something for me because I have a ritual of movies I get candy and I don't want to eat.
  Well just the magic because I'm in those bulls have magic.
 I didn't think like elves put the candy in there underneath.
 What are you going to say.
 It's going to be so shocking.
  It's just it's just filled with garbage bags of the bulk candy.
 Are they black garbage bags.
 Are they white? Are they clear? Yeah like clear.
 Clear or white? Clearish what like.
 Clear makes sense to me.
 Clear I like.
 White grosses me out.
 I agree.
  Kind of like cloudy like clear but you can see like if you get fruit at a supermarket.
 Yeah that kind of bag.
 That's fine.
 It was just a little sterile.
 If it was a white garbage bag where you couldn't see through it that would be bad.
 But it was just bulk and I was like.
 How else do you want to transport them?  Canisters barrels.
 I think those are more dignified.
 That costs money.
 A barrel is true because they can't they can't then store it under the thing.
 Well like a smaller babble like a pony cake.
 Like a pony cake full of ruts.
 Okay this might be more exciting to you.
 I thought like I will go get one of my favorites.
  I always mispronounce it nonpareils.
 Yep.
 Like snow caps.
 And I went to look in the bin and the whole top level of them chalky.
 Like dark chalky chocolatey.
 But they're dark chocolate nonpareils and they're like really light brown and chalky.
 Like that's when you know chocolate is like chocolate keeps for a while but when it starts to get chalky you got to toss it.
 That bummed me out.
  It sounds like not a lot of people are having that candy.
 No I mean I think it's a thing that old people like.
 Old people of me.
 Well look all I know if we look if we want to get right to it I'll tell you what I get when I go in.
 Okay I'll tell you my order.
 Let's hash it out.
 I go in and I get one bag gummy one bag chocolate.
 No I don't even do chocolate.
 I rarely do chocolate.
 I'm the chocolate boy.
 I like chocolate now but I go for everything I would like as a child.
 I get the I get the ruts.
  I get the sour balls and then I like the fact that you can get the separate things of sour balls.
 It's not just multi flavored.
 It's the one where you can just get cherry you can just get blueberry and then they have fun like they have like a pink flavor of some pink lemonade or something.
  And then I get the Lego candies.
 Maybe my favorite of all the candies.
 Yes like that because you can I don't I don't do this but you can like the real Legos you can build things with them but I do not do that.
 I just eat them.
 And you like the taste of them.
 I love the taste of them.
  I think it is also a texture thing.
 I think I like a hard piece of candy in my mouth.
 You wanted to eat Legos.
 Because as a child I had a fetish for eating Legos and now I get to do it because of its sugar.
 Well I put Legos in my mouth as a kid.
 Those are interesting to rattle around.
 Yeah.
  So that's the type that's the lane I'm usually in when I go to eat sugar.
 What is your.
 Well in my ideal scenario I'm doing three bags.
 Have you done three bags before.
 Yes.
 OK.
 And the three bags are chocolate gummy sour gummy.
 Oh yeah.
 You don't want the mixing.
  Jason has heard that you would have three bags of candy and his head is rolling with the money that you must have.
 You know still they don't charge you by the way.
 Yeah.
 But I can afford I have twenty nine in candy rather than my standard six fifty four.
 I do gummy too.
 I will put gummy in but it's usually just sour gummy.
 What I like with gummy I like that the cherry coke gummy.
  I like cherry coke gummies.
 Yeah.
 That sugar.
 I like to put those in.
 I like some of that stuff but I do not like gummy without sugar around.
 Really.
 Yeah.
 Oh man I've really just gotten into like kind of simple gummy.
 There's like a big chunk of like something gummy that's even like what even it like not not even gummy bears like a gummy snake like a giant.
  Yeah.
 The sharks.
 The blue sharks are great.
 Yeah.
 Very good.
 I just like these gross things that are like just gross gummy creations that taste like nothing.
 That's honestly what I'm leaning towards these days.
 Don't please tell me nobody here likes the one the kinds where it's sort of gummy on the top and then it's like a white sub other.
  So that's the blue shark.
 The blue shark.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Flavor.
 Oh yeah.
 Oh yeah.
 I think the white flavor is OK.
 I've had a couple of those.
 I don't dislike what I just I shouldn't bring that up like that's the worst thing.
 But I don't know what I don't like is which when I saw which I think was only a few years ago blew my mind was chocolate gummy bears which is oh whoa.
  They did it.
 They flew high and touched the face of God and then I had it and I said I guess it is what it is but I don't actually like you know what the problem with those are they're all kind of the same flavor.
 Yeah.
 Not a different.
 It's not the different flavors of gummy bears usually.
 Yeah.
  It also feels like too much chocolate not enough gummy.
 That's fair.
 Yeah.
 I don't know what they don't.
 They did it but it doesn't taste like how I want it to taste.
 Yeah.
 I usually go pretty I usually get like a scoop of like dark chocolate almonds and milk chocolate pretzels.
  I think there is so much restraint.
 That's basically all you get.
 No I'll get a little gummy sometime but I just like chocolate.
 Those are like I think when you're covering stuff in chocolate pretzels get milk chocolate and almonds get dark chocolate.
 My issue with the butter cups can go either way.
  My issue with it sugar is it's the same buffet thing where I will get like one or two of yes absolutely 25 candies.
 I won't just say oh my favorite are the Swedish fish and whatever and I'll get like even though maybe that's what I want.
 I will for some reason not like I've never had these things before I have to taste everything.
 I'll do that.
 I'm mildly interested in.
 I'm getting at least one of.
 IKEA and I don't know if they're still do is the new IKEA have this the candy.
  Yes candy as well.
 Yeah.
 Where you just scoop it.
 It's then I had to do like two of everything to try all these weird.
 Yeah.
 I'm more of a conservative when it comes to taking the candy from a sugar.
 I will oftentimes go only 80 percent candy that I know I like and then I will experiment a bit but I don't go nuts like what you're saying.
  Well no but honestly the experiment's over because all these I've had before.
 Yeah.
 You've tasted every single candy in a sugar which by the way there's a lot.
 And also Jason thank you.
 You called me on it because I said just one of each one but you got to do two because what if you really like it.
  You really like it.
 You really like it.
 It's sad as well.
 Yeah.
 You're gonna really be kicking yourself.
 You don't have a second.
 On occasion I will throw in one of those giant hardball pieces.
 I'm trying to think what they're called even like they're not gobstoppers or they're not.
 What is it called a jawbreaker.
  Yeah.
 Similar to that and it's giant and like that's maybe the weirdest I go.
 If I'm feeling you know I'm in a mood I will go for like the giant thing that you have to like hold in your mouth for like 10 minutes.
 When you experiment if you think of your bag of candy as an episode of SNL you have your topical material your standbys at the top.
 Right.
 And then you got your weird 1250 sketch.
 That's mine.
 And that to you is the big odd ball.
 Is the big odd sugar ball.
 Right.
 Yeah that's right.
  Which of course and which sex there are SNL candies that that is another.
 Yes they have.
 You want to literally create an episode an episode of SNL in your mouth.
 They have sweaty balls.
 And it sugar they have colon blow added sugar.
 What is colon.
 Oh that was a was that Phil Hartman.
 I know he knows the sketch.
 What is.
  What is brand flakes right.
 Let me find the picture because that would be a very weird brand cereal.
 Now that I say that that's to be a brand flakes are like a dollar a box.
 Well that wouldn't be.
 No one's ever eaten.
 They look so novel.
  The only one blow to me they look like like a ribbon candy.
 It just says snack treats.
 But I guess maybe they're just like that kind of looks like fiddle faddle.
 It could be fiddle faddle.
 He's buying some colon.
  Maybe a colon blow ain't so bad.
 Mr.
 Gummy Bear Jason Sheridan.
 What's his name.
 Chief Gummy Bear.
 Sorry.
 I'm gonna call me there as Wade and you are Chief Gummy Bear.
 Oh they have ambiguously gay duo which is just licorice candy because rainbow means gay I guess is that's their feeling.
  Maybe you think that's odd.
 Oh it is.
 I mean that's H so well.
 20 balls does make the most sense to be in here.
 Yeah.
 You're you're curious you know from the sketch.
 Let's remove the double entendre.
 Let's say I think the sweaty balls sound pretty good from the description that is meant to do.
  They are describing a very good sounding candy or dessert or whatever.
 So I bet those are not as good as the home made.
 I would like to follow the sketch and make whatever is described in the.
 Yes.
 Take it as a recipe.
 I agree with that.
 They have dick in a box which is like a picture little dicks.
  It's a bunch of little dicks.
 Yes.
 They're like gummy dicks I think.
 And there was one other but I can't find it.
 But this is this is all in the novelty.
 This is all the Spencer's gift section of the store.
 And I don't know if you guys saw this but next to the SNL stuff is something called dingle berries.
  And here's a picture of the box.
 It's a little cut off.
 Oh little poop candy.
 It is poop candy and the picture is a giant cartoon but with like brown on it and like like a piece of shit hanging out of the butt.
  And it's called dingle berries and it's covered gummy bears.
 You're showing me if it were a full on poop log come like kind of like with a little poof coming out of a butt that'd be less gross to me than the little like hanging off.
 Yes.
  Like because that that's like a weird it's just it's like a more accurate biologically type of poop and that's not right not a fun cartoon.
 So they have that they have this is the type of humor they find funny.
 They have a coffee mug that says coffee makes me poop.
  So there's I know you say that I know you said that in a way where you like these people think they're funny and that but you also kind of out of context it just sounded like a prude.
 This is the kind of thing that people think is funny.
  That might be more of what I'm talking about is I'm offended by this in my candy store and I was a cleaner thing.
 I've never seen anyone laughing at a sugar.
  I felt like you walk in and be like oh oh check this out hey hey March check this out.
 I don't I don't see those scenes happening actually.
 Do you think Kevin Smith witnessed the box of dingle berries and that inspired him to send his famous clit brown taint area tweet.
  Well there's many years ago and this is a real famous.
 You have to really get a walk over to this joke.
 Of the three of you who knows what Jason's talking about.
 I know what he's talking about.
 I'm sorry.
 I think this reference is really shoehoring this reference in.
 This probably isn't the last Kevin Smith reference once we get to love it.
  You know there's nothing about dingle berries in that tweet.
 There's nothing about it.
 It's really this is a real picture of the but it's a real reach for this Captain Gummy Bear.
 He was up there recording a cast.
  Maybe some of the other some of the other stuff is there's hand sanitizer and they have funny names on them like oops I sharded myself and this one just says my job gives me diarrhea hand sanitizer.
  Mark can you come into my office.
 Hey listen gotten some complaints about your my job gives me gives you diarrhea.
 Yeah.
 You keep it in your suitcase but like don't have it flowing.
 What if that was an earnest plea from the person who makes novelty bathroom sprays for it sugar.
  Yeah chemicals they use in the factory.
 I was like that was like an S.
O.
S.
 I hope someone helped them.
 There's a picture of a woman staring into the distance so perhaps it's her and that's the vibe of the person.
 It says the number one anti-bacterial for work induced diarrhea.
  So that's that is very very funny.
 That's pretty good.
 So probably less interesting but more interesting in my interest.
 A thing I noticed the last time I was at sugar.
 Well two things one another appearance of the knockoff butter beer the copyright.
  Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Like butter glass bottle butter beer.
 The other thing they have a freezer of ice cream novelties you know your your snicker ice cream bar your Twix ice cream bar and that's fun because sometimes like I don't necessarily want a whole dish ice cream.
  Sometimes they just want like did you say ice cream.
 Huh.
 A dish of ice cream.
 Oh I thought you called it dish ice cream.
 Also two dollars bottles of water which at city walk prices that's a steal.
  So if you're going to the park stopping at sugar by bottle water for the day.
 A future a spinoff podcast Jason dishes ice cream would probably be.
  Sure.
 Get off the turf.
  Now we've heard a foul of your rules.
 I don't know this.
 Hey look pretty well established.
 Tournaments are one thing we're talking about Jason laying claim to a four hour weekly treat discussion podcast.
  I'm thinking about the clandestine bars in my house right now when I go home after the flavor another nice ice cream novelties left off of the one Sasser ice cream international summer.
  It was called the Evan Sasser ice cream.
 Invitational.
 Sure.
 Summer ice cream.
 Invitational.
 Reeses.
 Reeses.
 Reeses.
 Reeses.
 You have Reese's clandestine bars.
 Yeah.
  Really good.
 It's peanut butter ice cream.
 Those are good.
 But they're you're mispronouncing it.
 So you'll go home and like talk to him for a little while.
 Yeah you around it.
 Seduce it for 15 minutes.
  Well what do you say we get down to it.
  I go to line.
 The last thing I had about it sugar is that there is a weird trend for the sexy candy store because outside there's like schoolgirl dressed up and there's like lollipops and there's this weird thing and there's it's not as bad.
  There's a place that at least was in Vegas.
 I don't know if it still is but a place in Vegas called Lick and it was the exact same store but just called Lick and it was very it was even more sexual and I don't know why people think adults won't go into a candy store unless it's like dirty or something.
  I feel like they're overcompensating candy is not for children it's for adults and they're horny like I think you are I think you are in general bothered by PG 13 words being anywhere within like you know it seems unnecessary yards of a themed attraction.
  It seems unnecessary is what I'm saying.
 People have fun with it and people want to know themselves and I think people have less fun with I think they're over I think they're overestimating people's interest.
  I think they're overestimating people's enjoyment of sex and candy the Marcy playgrounds.
  Now the song is good the concept of we often played at Sam Goody one of their best.
 Yeah.
 So I just so everyone is against this they all like the sex theme with candy stores I like it I feel like you're like you like you.
  And you say sexy candy with a lot of disdain.
 Well look I think that you need to separate candy is its own thing it's no sexual connotation to it I don't think it's fun it's sugary.
  You also want you know like HRQ gob hum.
 Yes.
 Thank you.
 That is exactly what I want.
 You want to smiley mustache man with lollipops for hands.
  Thank you.
 That's what I want licorice mustache.
 You know I said I disagree because I said I don't see people running around in it sugar being like oh this is so funny but here's what I do see right outside it sugar all the time.
  There's a bunch of kids being like hey let's go let's go sugar let's go get sugar and then the dad is like no and then he sees it and he's like uh yeah we'll give it a stop.
  That happened all the time.
 Look Mike sex sells okay it's the 21st century get with the times.
 You got something for the kids you got to get something for daddy.
  Something for daddy let's be honest I know why they're doing it I'm just lamenting the fact that it has to be this way and then I can't get Colonel Gobstoppers Emporium.
  Sweet factory a simple name tells you what you're getting.
 I mean the rumor is tooth some is coming.
 But that's not a candy store.
  There is candy well there's a confectionary.
 Yeah but it's not the same candy store.
 Right.
 It's like a shop chocolate place I'm fine with that boy likes that if the lawsuit doesn't if they don't put them out of business with that lawsuit from the wonkos.
  From the wonkos.
 Or the health violation.
 They found much cockroaches in the Orlando one.
 Yeah.
  So what if you made it a what if you you get your initials in there and you invent a character named like GB HQ candy lickers.
  Now is it huh.
 What is candy lick suckers.
 What is lick sucker look like what is the character look like describe is it a sexy character.
  Or is he just like a stodgy old man character but his head is a gummy bear.
 Well I know that's the answer you want and I like a man with a human body and a gummy bear head.
  I like that too to be honest.
 Yeah.
 And if that if that's what the chief gummy bear was then for sure if that's a if that's a CEO pick making a phone call in a suit but he has a gummy bear head.
  No but no in this scenario I just described a beautiful woman.
 Is it like Lola Bunny from Space Jam or is it like a sexy kind of it's sugar it's it's sugar is what it is but it's GRB HQ lick suckers.
  But I'm saying like how sex is it like Aeon Flux like what level of is it heavy metal level.
  It's just like a rabbit level.
 No just like a girl in a bikini top like it like it's too much for me I think I think the Jessica Rabbit or the Lola Bunny I'm in for.
 You want like a 40s.
  Yes like a pin up.
 Yes that is yes that is yes that is what I want.
 So you require old timey sexuality.
 You're not anti sex you're just into weird.
  I'm into specific yeah yeah uses like things how it used to be you know back in the day where they left things to the imagination.
  It was funny what I'm analyzing without him taking their clothes off.
 That's right.
 You just have one little show a little leg and the leg also happens to be.
  I'm trying to think of a candy that looks like a leg.
  But it's varicose veins that are licorice.
 That's gross but I know.
 Yeah OK no one wants that.
 She's yeah.
 The gumball or a big gumball breasts.
  Now we're getting warmer.
 I think that's good.
 I'm confused about what.
  We're kind of changing it.
 It's been a lot of things.
 Yeah this is a little gummy but she could be made of care like candy or B.
H.
 Q.
 Lick sucker is now a 40s woman.
  Jessica Rabbit dress but she's made of candy made entirely of candy Frankenstein candy Frankenstein but she's very sexy for dad.
  So she the first day she is like out walking around torn apart walks around.
  She's a walk around character.
 She's like a sexy version of the AMP character but then gets ripped apart by people who carpooled up there from Friday Night Bonds big boy.
  You know the Wop Wop blue bob rockabilly maniacs.
 A very Burbank heavy episode.
 A very Burbank heavy episode.
 Yeah I guess we should have known.
  We're very passionate about this though.
 We love regular candy not forming a human body and we like the other as well.
  Really digging into it's sugar we should have known that would reveal Mike's sexual pathologies.
 Here's something that would be fun because you guys talk about Los Angeles and you talk about you know the theme parks a lot.
  I'm gonna throw it out to the listeners.
 People who don't live in Los Angeles.
 I would love to see people draw maps of where they think everything is.
  Where is City Walk.
 Where's Disneyland.
 Where's Burbank.
 Where's Beverly Hills.
 Where's the beach.
 I want to know how everyone's imagining all where's Disneyland.
 You know where is how are all right.
  Because I'm back here.
 I had a very different idea before I moved.
 Maps are not going to be good to look at.
 Don't draw the map.
 It's a bad idea.
 This is just a thought exercise.
  This is all I was.
 I just thought that was interesting.
 Seeing the map like what we paint is our Los Angeles.
 Which includes no like nightclub districts.
 No Silver Lake.
 Don't forget about it.
 You never heard that word.
  There is the Tam O' Shanter.
 There's no places to play sports.
 There's no places to exercise.
 No.
 Forget it.
 No.
 It's all it's all Ferris wheels and factories of candy women.
  That's our Los Angeles.
 Yeah.
 All right.
 Well we look forward to getting a lot of art.
 I.
 Yeah.
 We should.
 No it's a bad idea.
 The maps are part of the city characters.
 That's good.
 That's a better thing.
 Where was that?  Well I guess it was though it's not it's I thought it was a drawing but it's actually a walk around character.
 So we need 3D models.
 Yeah.
 3D model.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Sky drawing and then we 3D.
 OK.
 OK.
 Yeah.
 That's good.
 All right.
 We should keep we should talk probably quickly about the thing that used to be in the sugar space which was something called the NASCAR Speedway.
  People would be screaming at us if we do not talk about the NASCAR Speedway though I you know what I looked at they did not do a good job of keeping it in the public consciousness or in Google results.
 I know that there were two NASCAR's speeding down the facade of the store which makes it I believe at that point for cars all told in all of city walk on the outside of buildings.
  I could be getting my count wrong but that's a lot for pure square footage.
 How many cars are on building outsides.
 They should have kept that.
 I would like that so much of cars outside is one of the best things about city walk is the fact that every store should have one.
 Yeah.
  Every car.
 Yeah.
 Every car should have a car.
 The Abercrombie one should be exploding with shirtless men.
 Yeah.
 They're all jumping out to save themselves from the crash.
 Yeah.
 NAS does anyone know anything about.
 I don't know.
 I googled it.
 I just claimed I don't know he's joking that he has anything about it.
 I know quite a bit about it.
 He's smiling.
 He could be.
 They had cars.
 They had NASCAR cars.
 OK.
 This isn't going anywhere inside.
 You could get it.
  You could get it in the car.
 You could drive a car.
 You could drive the car.
 No I was not able to find anything about it.
 But I think that NASCAR.
 Well I agree that the ideas of the cars on the outside and all of that and the more cars the better.
 Again NASCAR is I wonder does that quite fit with the city walk idea of like is that L.
A.
 I mean it's just fun.
 So maybe it is.
  Sure.
 Well have you guys covered this.
 What is a governing philosophy of city walk.
 Well it is.
 They have like some sort of they try to pretend it's a city because they have like they had a college there.
 There's all this highfalutin stuff about like it's the Los Angeles that never was and always will be just like we you know putting all of Kuki L.
A.
 into one little space and shaking it all up and whatever.
  The cars flying out of the building.
 Who cares.
 That's fine.
 Hey that's the way we are.
 Los Angeles we improvise.
 It's like the U2 song and Spider-Man turn off the dark about New York.
 It's like all the weirdos are here tonight.
 This is what we do.
 We're the strange parts of Los Angeles.
 Some might even go so far as called a simulation.
  Does that answer your question.
 A little bit.
 Yeah sure.
 Or was it a bunch of confusing gobbledygook.
 Yeah.
 Which is sort of what city walk is.
 I mean that's the philosophy of city walk.
 Were you able to find anything about NASCAR sir.
 No I mean well I have my memory of it is that was it like a simulator or like like sort of souped up arcade games.
 Sort of like that's what I remember walking into it.
 We were like.
  That's what I remember walking into it once.
 I was always afraid the cars on the building were going to fall down.
 Those two cars you were those two.
 I like the other ones.
 But you mean because they were pointed down.
 Well they were.
 Yeah.
 That's the effect they're intending to produce.
 Yeah.
 Yes.
 So you were away.
 You would run in there because you didn't want it to be bad timing.
 I would either run in or one run past like a house with a scary dog in the yard.
 So you were afraid of this place.
 Yeah.
 I also do.
  Yeah.
 I also just don't have.
 I don't really have a take on NASCAR.
 I don't really.
 All right.
 Well we don't have to talk about anything.
 You know what I'm going to talk about.
 I think we're heading to the final thing.
 But I realize something that we need to add to the sector which like the final thing is some of that city walk famous street art.
  And now now you'd have to turn you'd have to go past it sugar and then look back towards the fountains and ever cry.
 But when you do you see up on the second level bridge you see that neon sign which I'll show to you guys.
 You know this thing and anybody who's been up to city work.
  It's kind of a circular design that's a neon woman and it says through these portals past the most beautiful girls in the world.
 And memory number one I feel like I may have said this on the show before.
 Apologies.
 But I remember when I was like 13 or 14 and thinking I would never go on a date ever in my life.
  I remember passing by that and thinking someday I'm going to be on a date up here and I'm going to I'm going to point to that to the girl I'm with and say that they're talking about you.
 And I don't know the for we'll get to this the first date of my whole life was at city.
  And I did not do it.
 No I chickened out.
 But you but at the time were you like I'm going to do it I'm going to do it and then you didn't.
 I think so.
 Oh great.
 Like going on rides.
 Yeah I think I do kind of recall like pulse pounding.
 Now's the time.
 Your dream is going true.
 You can also what your line to this day even with your wife.
  Your wife or if if I did it to my wife it was like as sarcastic as humanly possible.
 Not about her beauty but about the idea that you would say that maybe I need to cut away all these layers of irony and just say what I'm feeling to my wife.
  Yes.
 You're standing under it looking up standing next to the dirty strip man.
 Dirty bubble gum strip.
 I hear a muffled laughter come from the inside of a shrimp suit.
 That's funny because you're mocking when you said you were like ironically sarcastic.
  Can you imagine the way piece of shit who thinks that's a good idea.
 But that was you.
 Yes.
 Also like it's not really this is not a type that we know the person who says that there is no type.
 Type was me.
 Also what kid is dreaming of my fantasy about being with a girl was not about anything sexual was about commenting on a city walk while on a nice date.
  What else was part of the city walk date in your fantasy.
 Hmm.
 Maybe well I'm not sure that it was but now I want to include a playful romp through the fountain.
  There we go.
 There we go.
 Pointing to the King Kong sign and being like what if King Kong were here he would surely want to grab you and bring you up a building.
 You're as beautiful as Faye Ray.
 Hey you're more beautiful than Faye ever was.
 Twas beauty killed the beast babe.
  I feel a heart attack coming on.
  Please call 911.
 I feel a heart attack coming on.
 I'm a very unhealthy 15 year old.
 15 year old with a murmur.
 Okay let me say some stuff about this sign really quickly on my way out the door before this episode I was like is there anything up with this sign.
  There's so much more than I expected but I'll say it very fast because we've been talking for a long time.
 This is a sign that is a reproduction of a neon sign that was outside a place called the Earl Carroll theater.
 This was on let's go in LA insider again.
  This was around sunset and Gower across from the Gower Gulch right near Gower Gulch and it's it was it's a theater space that for a long time in the recent past has been Nickelodeon studios.
 I think like all that and I Carly and victorious and these kinds of shows were filmed in this space.
  Currently, side of an ongoing police.
  Sure sure.
 But at the time in the in the like 30s 40s 50s.
 This was a great classic LA Supper Club considered one of the best and outside the theater was this sign through these portals past most beautiful girls in the world.
  So this was like a real.
 This was like a part of classic Hollywood nightlife.
 Interesting.
 This sign.
 This exact center that a recreation.
 It was a recreation because by the time by the 60s this thing was like turning the US but they recreated it for city walk.
  But currently and I didn't know this until tonight.
 They are restoring that theater which on the inside still is beautiful.
 Really looks like the 30s art deco footage of a KTLA news broadcast of it like still like you know beautiful staircases and crazy statues.
  It's like so when they get this thing tuned up this will hopefully be a new cool concert venue in LA and they're going to put this sign back up so there's going to be a second to that's so crazy because that sign I've seen him.
  It does not feel authentic.
 No feels like made like 15 years ago to be this looks like kind of the stuff that was around LA so I'm kind of surprised to hear that.
  Maybe the old one would have somehow felt more of the time I know what you mean.
 It feels a little 90s.
  We haven't seen the picture of the actual one right there are some you know this put it in this footage like from the 50s when it's happening.
  But let me say also real quick.
 Earl Earl Carroll, the owner of the theater started dating one of the show girls and one of his shows barrel Wallace who is this girl more real person became the girlfriend of the owner of the theater.
  Wow.
 And then in 1948 both of them died in a plane crash together a plane crash that also killed the co founder of Esquire magazine.
 Whoa, there were only 48 people on the plane and one of them was a popular nightclub owner one of them owned Esquire magazine and the other is a famous neon guy's.
  I gotta leave and write my hot screen play.
  I have I have a tiny bit more, which is in 1926 during Prohibition Earl Carroll was hosting a party and liquor was not allowed but as part of the entertainment he brought out a full bathtub with a naked woman in it, and the bathtub was full of liquor.
  She's bathing in the liquor which first of all,  People are like, they're dying for alcohol.
 I got a bunch.
 And there's like a naked one is like, do you have any other alcohol.
 Hey splash around.
  So, but it's, you know, he's, he's doing like a cool little private Prohibition party he thinks the guests are going to be cool with this.
 One of them was the editor of the New York Mirror he ratted him out wrote a story about it, federal authorities to subpoenaed Carol.
  He denied that it happened but there were so many witnesses, and he was sent to jail for six months.
 Whoa.
 Yeah, for not selling liquor but putting a lady in it, and a very lady and I would lock them up for that.
  sexuality.
 Yeah, wait, hold on the lady was Jessica rapid.
  And then top of this story.
 This party was held in honor of someone named Harry Kendall thought and quote Wikipedia, in honor of Harry Kendall thought who 20 years earlier had murdered Stanford White.
  What, so this was a Prohibition party in honor of a murder.
 Happy 20th anniversary of the murder you did my man.
  Wow, what a crazy time women in bathtubs and jails and casual murder celebrating murderers insane.
 And then let me fast forward all the way up to this theater that his theater that I'm talking about which eventually became Nickelodeon studios but before that  1993 was re christened in honor of an exciting new late night endeavor.
 His theater became the Chevy Chase.
  And then he was revealed at the end, how much this is so much stuff you're right there is plenty for a script or something what a crazy world of stuff also the Jerry Lewis telethon was held there for many years, we glossed over, because it turns out this sign was much more interesting  but the King Kong neon side above it sugar.
  That's a main course.
  That's why I wanted this sector.
  Amazing.
 Here's my hot take better LA tourist attraction than the Walk of Fame.
 Absolutely.
 Yeah, you're right.
 Walk of Fame is confusing.
 You don't know where it even is, you can't drive by it, you can't really you can't make a picture of the Walk of Fame you can take  a picture of individual stars, it's confusing.
 It's Michael Jackson so you're at the wrong one is like, oh that's actually an old like radio broadcasters that's not the musician one, it's miles long there's some very problematic people on that walk of fame now  destroyed our beloved president.
  Something.
 But still we kind of small little disappoint yes a little disappointing also.
  I don't know, there are million Walk of Fame's.
 There's a studio city Walk of Fame there's like a Pasadena Walk of Fame.
 One in Palm Springs, there's a Palm Springs.
 This area is lousy with walk of fame.
  King Kong neon sign on the other hand is just like wow.
 This is LA.
 It's a great picture.
 It's fun.
 I you know I noticed when you guys you had your picture announcing our teaser.
 Yeah, and you had to have them in.
  Yeah, we now have a logo just for the city walk saga and it's our little icon done in kind of a Frazier nod and the King Kong is hanging off of the side.
 So it's the logo teaser photo.
 It's everything it's everything you want to say but I love I love everything about that I love that you're recognizing the Frazier influence.
  I love that King Kong.
 Absolutely.
 I mean you know I think that let me just say that that logo was made by one of the most beautiful girls in the world ever passed through any portal there I said it.
 Could you imagine someone say my wife she Aaron is swooning right now.
  Mike is sweating at the thought of.
 I don't like this woman.
 This phrase beautiful a little risque don't you think and I just love you like it's positioned perfectly aware to like we said it's in the heart of city walk so you can see it and you see it is in the heart of the city.
  So you can see the stores before it you see the stores after it.
 It really feels like King Kong is just in the middle of the action.
 Yes.
 And I thought about it up.
 I've thought about like are there things you know the plus up like, could he be bigger, could he be like moving, you know, but honestly, it maybe is just perfect.
  It's really, it's really wonderful.
 And it is like you walk in the city walk and you see King Kong and you're like this is fun.
 We're having fun.
 It's insane how much it is to park.
 It's also not really easy to get to a city walk.
  There's not very much good there, but you see King Kong and you're smiling and it's not even a thing to do.
 You can't pay money to lose King Kong.
 He's not asking for money.
 So sorry.
 You can't pay money.
 You can't like it's not an attraction.
  You can't buy miniature.
 Hey, hey, they got to sell those airbrushed five nights at Freddy's.
 They're not selling t shirts with him.
 That's okay.
 Well, they should be making more money.
 But in this gross, you know, city walk thing where they're grasping for your  dollar and every opportunity, somehow there's one piece of art just exists and is wonderful is this King Kong just looming above us all.
 And I, you know, I've never, I don't know anyone who's annoyed by King Kong.
  No, you hear a lot of different like points of view about everything in LA and you know, like, oh, like all that thing that you like that actually sucks.
 I've never heard anyone say King Kong at city walk sucks.
  Everybody likes King Kong at city walk.
 And this is why I wanted to do the sector because it's great.
 I love this passion.
 What a wonderful note to go down on.
  To go to note to go down on.
 What a wonderful note to go out on.
 I guess I've got a dirty mind.
 You and your high T.
 You're always thinking dirty thoughts.
 You're the alpha of the podcast and you're so horny all the time.
  And I, we see it all appearing.
 Suster just to loop you in a stone.
 We get a stone at the end of every city walk.
 I think we're wrapping up, aren't we? There's nothing after.
  I was told this was a mini so I've been here an hour now.
 Don't forget they have the there's a Santa hat for Christmas and you're in the summer.
 You wear sunglasses and that's great.
 And that's great.
 And cool.
  I said in a way that I could never say your enthusiasm made me so happy.
 Thank you.
 Well, I think that I was a little loopy coming in guys.
 I was coming in a little hot, but I was.
 I did have genuine passion for King Kong at city walk.
  And the stone has appears.
 And of course, what else is it? It's a little miniature King Kong and he's holding a little pennant that says congratulations on your murder.
 Murder is that from the bathtub woman from the person they were celebrating.
  The party.
 The party.
 Yeah, it's King Kong celebrating.
 Because King Kong celebrates everyone.
 And wait a minute, his face doesn't look like King Kong's regular face.
 It looks like it's made out of gummy.
 King Kong's got a gummy bear in it.
 And it's all a stone.
  Oh, well, thanks sector keeper.
 It's a wonderful stone.
 One of the best and Susser.
