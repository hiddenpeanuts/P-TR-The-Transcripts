At long last you can answer burning questions like "how many times was 'boys, boys!' said during the Citywalk Saga? (approximately 28)

These transcripts were created with StoryTookitAI: https://github.com/octimot/StoryToolkitAI 

I only kind of know what I'm doing with this tool, and with github. 

StoryToolkitAI is designed to integrate transcripts & captions into video-editing software, but it also happens to produce really good plain text transcripts for free.

Transcripts were done on ad-free versions of the episodes, available from a combination of Forever Dog+ and Club 3.

I haven't done any serious verification or corrections. The transcripts definitely have some issues that I've noticed while skimming:

-It's inconsistent around whether it transcribes the Citywalk Saga opening song & narration. I think the background music confuses it. 
-It does an impressive job with proper nouns, but isn't 100%.
-Good luck searching for any specific pronunciation of "buca di beppo"

I'm going to try and keep up with new episodes, likely every couple of months.

The Transcripts folder has the raw transcripts. Search through them there.

If you want to find the exact time something was said in an episode, use the subtitle files in the Timestamps folder.

Recommended workflow: Search in the Transcripts folder. Then open the matching Timestamps file to find when the phrase was said in an episode. Timestamps will be inaccurate if you're looking things up in episodes with ads.
