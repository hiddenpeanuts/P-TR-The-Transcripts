# P:TR: The Transcripts

At long last you can answer burning questions like "how many times was 'boys, boys!' said during the Citywalk Saga?" (approximately 28)

## Methods & Tools

Github isn't primarily designed to be a searchable pile of text files, but it let me put a search box in front of these quickly and for free. I only kind of know what I'm doing.

Transcripts were created with StoryTookitAI: https://github.com/octimot/StoryToolkitAI 

StoryToolkitAI is designed to integrate transcripts & captions into video-editing software, but it also happens to produce really good plain text transcripts for free.

## Structure & Use

Use the search bar way up at the top of the screen to search. You may need to create a github account.

The _Transcripts_ folder has the raw transcripts. Search through them there.

The _Timestamps_ folder has .srt subtitle files. This is useful for finding when in an episode something was said.

Recommended workflow: Search in the Transcripts folder. If you want to find the matching timecode, open the matching Timestamps file and search for the phrase. 

## Important Details

Transcripts were done on ad-free versions of the episodes, available from a combination of Forever Dog+ and Club 3. If you're listening to versions with ads, timestamps will be off.

I haven't done any serious verification or corrections. The transcripts definitely have some issues that I've noticed while skimming:

- It's inconsistent around whether it transcribes the Citywalk Saga opening song & narration. I think the background music confuses it. 

- It does an impressive job with proper nouns, but isn't 100%.

- Good luck searching for any specific pronunciation of "buca di beppo"

## The Future

I'll keep up with new episodes, likely every couple of months. I welcome collaborators. Sivako.
