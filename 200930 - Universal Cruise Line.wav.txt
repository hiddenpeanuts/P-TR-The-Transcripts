 Welcome to podcast the ride the second gate where today we set sail on one of the most ill-advised  ventures in theme park history pseudo theme park history.
 I'm scott gertner mike carlson how do you feel about this one?  I feel sort of sad that it didn't make it because in concept everything that I've  Seen online at least in concept.
 This seems cool.
 It seems like it could have been cool  But it was a disaster and why and why not try to I know it seems like an odd fit of brand and  Thing to do but like why should disney be to get the full cruise pie? It doesn't make sense.
 There's so much  Wonderful ip that universal has and uh jason charidan.
 Are you disappointed you didn't get to try this? Um,  Yeah, I guess um  Yeah, I don't know.
 I just uh  Sorry, I don't use I just feel a little what confused a little weird about  What's wrong? What's going on? What's what are what's happening to you right now? Uh  Well, you know, you guys know I I like doing the research for the show.
 I love digging digging down  We know that yeah.
 Yeah, that's one of your things one of your trademarks.
 Yeah.
 Yeah a little research boy and I  but um  You know, I found I found some like speculation of like when will universal try to tackle the cruise market, but I  I really didn't find a lot else about this  and I  I don't know.
 What do you I? I it's not like it was the deepest dive.
 I don't think I've  I know all about the shrek deck.
 I know all about hitch cocks the adults only lounge  Like why why was this so crazy? Um, he splat ets wet and wild the children's kiddie pool with the giant et  I yeah.
 Yeah.
 No, yeah, I I came across some of that.
 I don't I maybe i'm just feeling weird  Maybe we should have pushed this recording.
 I've just been kind of  Like I feel like weird stuff is going on.
 Like I like first off.
 I don't even know how we got  This zoom.
 I usually mike sends out the zoom email, but I just got texted a zoom link and like  Well, I was wait wait from wait a minute.
 I just that happened to me like yeah  It had no source.
 Like I assumed it was from mike, but then there was just it was just blank  It I don't know where the yeah, I thought that was a weird tip  Yeah, we showed up and it was you and I in the room and then mike and so  I just chalked it up to technical difficulties.
 But then I was I've been kind of rearranging like trying to  Purge and rearrange my room and stuff and like I came across the coffee coin you remember  Where like two years from city walk? This is the city walking.
 Yeah, the city wall coffee  We're about two years out from the city walk saga.
 And um, oh, yeah, we'll wait.
 Yeah.
 Yeah, we yeah  We were doing this.
 Yeah, well like two years ago right now.
 Yeah, and and I  It it felt like it was calling to me  And I feel like if I looked at it at the corner of my eye it it looked like it was glowing like pulsate like  what so are you uh, how much how much has the the pot smoking increased during I know it's like  It's that you've enjoyed it during the eat it.
 These people don't usually hallucinate.
 Jason, what are you smoking and can I have some of it?  You know, I that's  That's fair.
 I mean it's certainly helping with the the quarantine but but yeah, not not significantly that it would  It would be that bad.
 But I you know, I kind of I unwrapped the coin because it it was still  Had some painter's tape on it from the live show.
 Um, and I I gave it a wash.
 I gave I cleaned it just to see  Because I realized like yeah, it was really grimy, you know, you got to give it a clean coins.
 I yeah and I  I never noticed this before there was an inscription on the coin  An inscription, I mean, I guess I never got a good look at it, but there's wait  There's like something on it that you didn't see before.
 Yeah, and it was like, you know, I was like, I'm not sure  It's like something on it that you didn't see before.
 Yeah, and it it said when two years have come and gone  extra sectors lie beyond  What what what right boys  It's time what did you guys hear that?  Yes, i'm back  What are you talking about?  We got a surprise  Poppin that's like it started it got it was distorting and glitching out and then suddenly oh my god the sector keeper  That's right boys.

 All right.
 This is a big turn.
 I this is unprecedented  You obviously in podcast the right history.
 We've been asked to bail on the topic and a second  Theme song has been added when we're just now  This has ended up being a surprise the city walk saga is back.
 Oh my god, scott  Let me let me do the honors here.
 Welcome to podcast the ride the city walk saga sector 20  Yeah  I'm, so out of I didn't even think to do that.
 My name is mike carlson  And scott garner is very flustered.
 Boy.
 Yeah, I forget the protocols about all this.
 It's been so long  It was nice to hear that  Yeah, it was nice.
 It was a simpler time  Jason, sorry.
 I scrambled your brain  I you know if it's for the sake of quality  Podcasting i'm all for it, but i'm just happy i'm not being driven mad  Geez I shouldn't have I shouldn't have blamed it on the demon weed  Um that you were being called to and the sector keeper is back with us.
 How you been? It's been a while  I'm good.
 Yeah good to be back excited to talk about  the city uh city walk and  Uh, you know  Just a you know a place no matter what it never changes  Uh always feels good  It's like home  Yeah, yeah, well that's sort of true.
 I mean like  I I guess it's funny that this can there must have been  Something in the air because I don't it's all it's almost like like in a way  we knew that this was coming and that we were going to be called to do this because  strangely a couple days ago  The three of us gathered for the first time anywhere in six months  And we actually went up to city walk  All together we were finally we the three of us finally reconvened up.
 We went to city walk.
 Yeah.
 Yeah, it was crazy  It was crazy  so  Reconvened  Uh, yeah, because we haven't seen each other for a  A while and it's kind of weird to be at city walk.
 You haven't seen each other  summer break  schools out missing friends  Oh  Well, certainly the latter  He definitely the yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah, we we have a no does he I don't know.
 Yeah, we haven't recorded since  march  so yeah, there's  Do you know what?  There's something happening in the world right now sector keeper that is preventing a lot of people  from gathering  Let me think  Um, yeah, take your time in their houses watching the tokyo olympics  No, no, that's not it no, that's that'd be nice I wish yeah.
 No, that's yeah, I  i'm stumped  Um, I I don't know how to tell you you're a it's this is tough for anyone to hear let alone a child  Um, there is a we're in the midst of a global pandemic.
 There's a disease that is  Is all over the world? It's not even just just los angeles everywhere on earth is currently  Stuck under the shadow of this very bad disease and we have been for the majority of the year  Oh  Oh, wow, I I missed all of this I was uh  I was on a cricket wireless corporate retreat and we weren't allowed to have phones  What what you were even though it's a phone company  Yeah, that was kind of part of the theme it was about unplugging  so they took our they took our phones and we  Uh, we stayed in cabins and solving  For six months for six months, you know, we just kind of did retreat activities  about how um  It's better to have  Snacks in the break room than to have a union that kind of stuff  Oh, yeah learned about the family tree of the cricket wireless goo goo people  Yes.
 Oh, yeah, he showed up goo.
 We love goo  He did you know that the goo from cricket wireless is married to the mucinex mom?  Oh, that's like the voice of mickey marrying the voice of minnie.
 That's so cute  Yeah, that is that's nice.
 I hope they party with flubber sometimes  Flubber is their dog.
 I think  He can't talk it's like plow that's a pet  so you've got so sector keeper you  Famously in the last in the downtown disney ordeal you were looking for severance from cricket wireless  This sounds like you were looking for a  You famously in the last in the downtown disney ordeal you were looking for severance from cricket wireless.
 This sounds like you were hired back in a corporate setting  yeah, um, so  We I tried to take them to court and there was a settlement  Um, I don't understand a lot of it, but they let me sign the papers with a cool pen and i'm back  Wow, so are you just back in the retail uh sector to speak or yeah, I work the floor  Okay, so you have your old job back essentially.
 I got my old job back.
 I get paid a little less  I get to park a little closer  um  and uh  The work week includes saturdays  Includes saturdays.
 So the severance package was just resettling to  Essentially do the same thing but for less money  Mm-hmm  And a six month corporate retreat  Which sounds fun? I mean I wouldn't mind  Yeah, go into a cabin for a while.
 You might have had more fun than we've all been having lately  but one cool thing is they use some of my paycheck to put into a  Low interest savings account so that I can maybe afford surgery one day  Oh, well, well, that's nice how does does that work everyone pulls their money into a savings account? Yeah, it's like a swear jar  So so the first what is it like the first couple people get their surgeries if they need them  Yeah, it's whoever gets hurt first gets healed first  Oh, wow, uh, shouldn't you get preference here back?  Yeah  Can it like bring you back to life because you still exist in this sort of limbo ghost state?  I don't know if there's a surgery to make you a full human again.
 Oh, um, no pre-existing conditions  Don't count and my death would count as a pre-existing  condition  Oh shit, that's too bad.
 You know, maybe one thing to talk about  Right off the gate because there were a lot of odd changes that we encountered when we went up there  But the the place that put you into this condition  to begin with the city walk fountain  Uh is now inaccessible due to the disease  There's now like a red rope  Surrounding all sides of it.
 So it's only to look at and no kids can ever play in it again  Hmm  Only took global pandemic to realize unsafe  Yeah, I yeah, I guess I guess story didn't  Resonate.
 Yeah, that's true.
 If they had just  If there had been any attention called to your story whenever that happened the mid-90s  then maybe  A lot of kids could have been saved a long time ago  Yeah, your story sector keeper.
 I'm surprised it has not been co-opted by some sort of political movement and used in a  vast  Right-wing conspiracy to be honest with you  hmm  Well, that's something for the movies  Well, if only it stayed in the movies  Boys unfortunately robert kennedy jr is just everyone, you know, everyone's trying to save the truth.
 It's better  We don't tell you about this.
 Uh  Yeah, yeah, I would love for you to not hear about anything that's been happening in the last couple years the the boys boys  There's a lot to cover.
 There's a reason i'm here  Oh, yeah.
 Yeah, please get to it boys.
 So sector 20 is jam-packed and loaded with lots of food and fun  sector 20 is  on tojitos  havayanas  nbc nbc sports and brew  abracrombie kid  And tillies  Anything else anything you want to wish us  Good luck boys there  And remember  If you complete this you'll give me strength  Yeah, that's that's the stuff isn't this nice to hear I felt so  Unstructured during this entire pandemic like it's hard to set boundaries of when you work and when you don't like I've that I feel  My life just feels tidier having this assignment to do  Oh good.
 Good.
 Well, there's a lot to cover and i'm sure you boys have a lot to say  Um, we do um, and and it was it was a lot of fun to go up there  Um, and and we will talk everything that you just listed is new  At citywalk since we did this  Two years ago.
 Um, so that's that's good news for you that we can tell you that there's a lot of new fun stuff to do  shops and restaurants  Um, I do feel like we have to let you know  I forgot to mention  If you don't complete this i'm in grave danger  Wait how what?  Grave danger and I would have guessed I guess per usual in grave danger  That's why i'm back, but i'm back for a limited time.
 You see  The corporate retreat has not fully ended boys.
 I need you to complete sector 20 to give me strength to leave solvang  Yeah, you should that's where you're coming from that's where you're like astral zooming from  Yeah, i'm astral projecting from solvang not to over complicate it but yes, uh, uh  Lots on the line.
 Okay.
 Good luck  Oh, boy, I mean he should I I didn't want to say anything but like he does look like he's been mostly  eating able skeevers the puffy pancakes because  He's looking a little puffy right now as if he spent six months at solvang just eating pancakes  Yeah, jason, would you switch places with him? Uh  Out of the current I mean i'd consider it  All right  So if we don't just actor keeper if we don't do it if we don't complete our mission  And jason will drive up to solvang and dress like you and switch places now.
 Wait a minute.
 I thought that was a hypothetical question  No, no, you'll trade lives.
 Oh, that's fair.
 That's fair.
 My my boss is shaking his head.
 He says that's fair  Your boss is watching you podcast right now  Yes  Okay, very intrusive.
 Yeah  He just wants a body there.
 He just wants a head count  Yes, he wants yes  Jason's photo is on the wall of every avar skeever  Restaurant here in solvang.
 I like to support local small businesses  Is it like his headshot like at a dry cleaner?  Uh, yes, it's like a headshot at a dry cleaner also  It's almost like a competitive type photo where you were uh, you  You ate the biggest avar skeever and got it for free  Okay, well because what happens is if you do one of the places challenge  Then the then you can get the other challenges for free like they they you know, I have a system  Clearly yeah, you swept it  But boys boys boys, we must focus.
 We must focus  Please get in a separate challenge  All right.
 Okay.
 We got a lot to cover  There's different stages of clothes much like states phased reopening city walk has different stages of clothes  Yeah, what I was getting at surger keeper is that for there's five new things to do?  Uh, and that's good.
 That's progress but um  Uh, there there have also been some losses.
 I am sorry to report that there have been  Honestly a vast degree of fallen brothers  Fallen brothers  Yes, I saw some of raider store  Open.
 Oh, thank god.
 No raider images raider images open and thriving in the middle of the week  wide open  Mid pandemic raiders fans crowding store raiders crowds crowding store as raiders  Raiders organization moves to las vegas.
 Mm-hmm  Yeah, that's the city move when things are going wrong  Some things when things are going wrong.
 Some things are still right  Hey, we're all in this together, you know  I will say it's still there  Margaritaville is not open but the raider store is  Now, what do we think about this was one confusing thing about our trip is margaritaville closed  I don't think it's closed for good because it's not gutted but like is it ever open?  It wasn't we do it a wednesday afternoon.
 Yeah, I don't know if it's ever open.
 I'm not sure  Um, let's let's go through the things closed down permanently  Okay  Let's give the sector keeper space to breathe here because this is going to be tough  This is going to be like hearing a laundry list of relatives that have passed away.
 Okay, most recent ludo bird gone  uh  Let's see, what else hard rock cafe gone becoming toothsome chocolate  uh  And savory treat import whatever the place that smells upsetting in florida because they're cooking savory food and chocolate  simultaneously in the same facility  um now  There is I would sort of say there's a new  Dog that's debuting a spokes dog for the toothsome chocolate.
 Have we seen this? Uh, yes those boston dynamic  Robot dogs that will eventually hunt us down  Yes, uh  Jacques is the robot man that was there already, uh and  Dr.
 Toothsome is the female like steampunk woman and then latte is their dog and that character is new  So I just wanted to mention latte  Uh latte debuted right around the time, uh universal florida laid off a significant number of employees  But latte is working.
 They fired a thousand humans and hired one robot dog named latte  So anyway, go ahead city walk hollywood though, so hard rock's gone.
 There's still one on hollywood boulevard sublime  uh gone like  2016 perfectly preserved in amber the billboards for swell water bottles and patty wax candles still  Loom above the empty store front  Uh something from our theme song is gone.
 It's gone unless again to reopen this does this is it?  About a sublime hot topic and if so, the hot topic is still there and it is still sublime  Yes, i'll never say what my intention was never say these accursed homonyms  Uh potentially still relevant how let the moon gone move to hollywood boulevard  Oh go ahead what oh  That's correct, oh he howled himself i'm not sure that that hollywood boulevard one has opened though.
 I didn't see it on their website  Yeah, I don't know.
 That's that's yeah, they announced the plan.
 I don't think i'm  I was gonna say i'm sure it's not open, but it's possible.
 It's been open for six months  I I will look in a second.
 I believe I got a grand opening email and I believe it might have come  Right before a week before so everything shut down.
 Oh that might be it  I I was looking at the the locations on their website and it's a lot of  Cities, but then right in the middle of it howl at sea  so speed visiting at the topic we didn't get to there there was a  Uh, you can go to a howl at the moon on the norwegian escape  the cruise ship  um, which I  Wait, but then it's within a different it's how at the moon, but it's inside  Headliners a separate club entity within norwegian cruises  Uh, i'm confused as always very fitting irony.
 That is on a ship called escape  The main instinct one feels as they enter the doors of howl at the moon  uh  Uh  Now I  Now and I think this is very important.
 There's been some real big developments up at city food.
 Now city food is the second floor area  What yes  Um, are you okay city food city food is food court.
 Yeah, that's the food court  uh  Keep keep going  Oh, right, we still can't do it.
 We're still not allowed to go to the food court.
 All right  That's that's fine.
 I won't complain.
 We got places to go.
 Uh if things are talking about yeah, we have plenty of food to talk about  We have to talk about mbc's take on cheesy fries  Well, hang on you might be getting lax up there with your solving easygoing attitude, maybe we're the ones who have to reinforce  Uh the way we step through this and when we are not through with jason's tears of what has closed and to what degree  Please jason the floor is yours.
 Sorry.
 Mr.
 Scott  I guess i'm the the rule setter now  Uh, I think that's everything that's closed permanently.
 There is a yeah, no, no, but there's more there's more levels  Oh, yeah, so the next level right right, right.
 What was closed when we were up there and possibly might be closed forever  uh  And we can all chip in on this because I have I mean the big one that we saw was like samba the brazilian steakhouse  kind of  An inconvenient setup in current, uh times not open when we were up there  Yeah, I don't want to go to a buffet at this point like a just where meat is being tossed around the room  essentially  Mm-hmm  Uh samba.
 Yeah right by the margaritaville, which is closed again.
 These both could be closed forever.
 It is possible  Yeah, carl strauss looked wasn't open when we were there had no outside tables was unclear what the status of carl strauss was  Yeah, i've i've heard word from you know, the rumor mill that  Universal is trying to  Own everything that exists at city walk.
 So I do wonder if universal is using some backdoor machinations  To try to force certain things out of there so they can put in their own toothsome chocolate type things  With their own intellectual property and their own robot dogs  Yeah  Do you think they made the disease? Is this part of their plan? Well, you know, some people are saying  Some people are saying this a lot of i'm not saying they're saying it.
 Yeah, but a lot of people are saying it  That bathroom by the hot topic  I was gonna say something that would be made for a movie  Straight from the movies that's true  Yeah, I know but you you might not know the degree to which the actual world is getting scary  Like those scare the pg-13 movies you would watch before you died things are starting to feel like that a lot  hmm  Who else is close who else is close popcornopolis when we were there clothes zen zone I fly  the movie theater  Zen, so we can't go into a tube.
 We can't put people in and out of a tube where you fly we can't like  Uh have like a literal aerosol trap that you fly around in during this pandemic  Uh, yeah, they they I you know, there are some uh devices they have in the zen zone though that I feel like might be healing  You know, there's those  oxygen machines  Maybe they can put the vaccine in the zen zone oxygen machine and and get it in that way  Well, I want to show you guys, uh, um, you're set up with a screen share capability sector keeper, right?  Uh, I believe so.
 Yes, I would have to  Uh, uh, all right.
 Wonderful.
 So yes, brian's my boss  Um, uh, all right then brian can take a look at this too, uh, here's i'm just going to show you guys the uh,  This is what we found on the door of the zen zone or the water coffins  uh  Here is a number of  notices  About uh covid-19  regulations, let me just count the pieces of paper one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen  There are 17  Laminated pieces of paper on the door along with a padlock  so city walks, uh  Doing as good as ever I went and like looked at some of the handwriting to see like some of what I don't know if this is  What they have to do for the city's sake it just looks like they're trying to do something  I don't know if this is what they have to do for the city's sake it clearly didn't help them reopen the place  I'm, not sure the purpose of any of it, but I took one  Photo of some of the handwriting mike's upset outside.
 He can't he's very sore.
 I know I look like i'm sexually sexually posing  Very coy.
 Yes.
 Yeah, it looks like scandalous mask.
 We don't know what face you're making under there.
 Mike looks like pinup girl  Yeah, I really do.
 I thought I was selling a back injury a body 40s, baby, huh? I'm looking good  Um, so here's uh some of the copy like somebody handwritten wrote, you know how the  How does all the covet regulations apply to the zen zone and then listen to this our aqua massage have?  Zero contact it is self-directed from a machine with no human touch  Customers remains fully clothed  Just so surreal that these things that we experienced two years ago all have to one by one  Discuss with the city and the public the city of us the county of les angeles public health  Bureau whether they can do this  Reopen or not  This feels like there was an inspector like an inspector coming to city walk to like discuss with them if they could open or not  And the person never came and they're like, well, I print it all out.
 Just write just explain to them  We'll just stick it on the wall if they come by and then they'll just like put a big yes  They'll like leave a note that says yes open  And it never happened didn't happen.
 I'm not great at spelling tests, but customer was misspelled  There's a number of yeah, there's some pluralization issues  on this thing  um  You know, i'm just glad that you know, I think we we get into the weeds on these these daily podcast series and that's not daily  We're just doing this one and it's it was all two years ago  But I just know that the audience would expect us to read  Some of the bullet points on appendix r from the les angeles department of public health  And we are doing it.
 So, um, yeah for all your appendix r updates follow podcast  Can we should we find appendix should we find this document online somewhere and give it?  Post it on twitter and you can all out in the audience add your own reasons why zen zone is safe  You know, it'll be a fun contest  We'll have explain why the water coffins are okay during a pandemic like a coloring contest and whoever wins  gets uh  Their bullet point is law  Yeah, exactly  Yes, we'll look for we'll see if we can find this document  Full appendix are coming to twitter.
 Um, so yeah things things really exist in this strange, uh limbo  Um, you'll be happy here searcher keeper, you know, what's not open, you know, it has a ton of pieces of paper on the wall  sparkies  Sparkies ain't running right now  That's right boo him I don't hell  He might be he might have been sent to hell for poor health regulations he's bad  Yeah  He's a bad boy.
 It's very possible  Um, he yeah, he he purposefully coughed on a lot of people sparky.
 Uh,  Went to trader joe's and tried to film viral videos without masks  he  Went and coughed everywhere without a mask and then he got his propeller hat going which helped spread the virus faster  all around the market  And then the biggest insult the video didn't even go viral.
 So he didn't he didn't get what he wanted at all  I mean we better in case it was we better uh talk about some of these specific I knew going through his mistake  more, um  Popcorn opolis closed nectar bath treats closed when we were there.
 Um  um  et and frankenstein garages seemed  Impenetrable, I mean you might have been able to get it  Yeah, we were  Yeah, there was a lot to prevent us  I think et is where because I was very obsessed with trying to see the nintendo land progress, but  It was too hard.
 I think et would have been the only place you could have maybe gotten a glimpse  Yeah  um  You want to talk a little about um, just how it felt to to be up there because as I said  This was this is the first time we all have hung out since march  It was pretty crazy and I think we all felt it that despite all of the the oddity  um  And you know all the fears of right now that  Being in a place that we know so well that we've spent so much time in it was  Very comforting.
 I think we all were a little touched to emerge into the the center atrium  Yeah, so  We went yeah, we went we parked in the parking garage  We went to this little area where they were doing your temperature check, which is of course theater  It's just theater for people because you know, you can take tylenol and get rid of a temperature  Anyway, they do a temperature check.
 They have the hand sanitizer there  Don't forget one step of this though.
 You just you just glazed past the parking and this is notable  That how surreal was it to park at city walk for free? Yes  Yes with the parking attendant, uh in the little uh security shack  Being even more checked out than usual like when I pulled up  He did like this with his hand and I was like does that mean keep going or stop?  And then he handed me like a parking ticket  But I I saw no cars plenty of cars in the garage  I saw no cars on the streets driving up there  Mm-hmm.
 It was uh, yeah  Wow  I got I got a receipt as well.
 I definitely felt like I was getting away with something  And did you feel guilty did you like oh, sorry? No, no go sector keeper.
 I was gonna say  Actually free parking or did you have to?  Go into amc and do some strange exchange rate  Uh shockingly  For just pure free you but whether you bought anything or not  I think a couple of us bought a thing or two, but even if we hadn't yeah you it's finally is genuinely free up there  You're talking about when you uh pay for parking and then  Unless you use the app you have to go into the amc and they give you like a dirty 10 dollar bill  To redeem part of your parking the filthiest around  Uh, no, yeah, we didn't have to do that amc of course was not open  still had the onward posters and posters for  Minions coming soon.
 Well tenant.
 Yeah  Tenants up there.
 I'm very i'm very happy with a very obscure thing that I shot up there that I won't even mention  We'll put it on the social media.
 No one will understand what the reference is.
 I didn't get it  But now that I it's been explained to me.
 It's uh delightful.
 Yeah, so we'll put that up  but do you mike do you feel like  Does that take away some of the city walk thrill for you in a way that you didn't get to do?  An outsmarting of the system that you don't get to play that that mental game  of trying to park where I can  Yes, I can outsmart them all that's kind of what it is.
 Uh  There was a lot of other stuff going on in my mind that day  So it was not so high on my list  I think sometimes i'd have to I have to really like be in the pandemic city walk a few times to see  Where the system's weaknesses are there has to be something I can do  But I was just scoping it out this first time and i'm sure there's got to be a way  And I want a spoiler alert.
 I got a some sort of food to go  There might be some sort of discount I can figure out there can be some sort of twitter alert for a coupon perhaps  Uh, i'm i'm just at the start of my journey as far as pandemic city walk deals are concerned  Adjusting to the new normal the new the new normal way to try to get value out of this one  theme park adjacent shopping complex.
 Yes  Absolutely thrilling stuff  Well, someone got drool over the last six months  He used to be polite and like would pretend like he was sick or so  He was like he was getting sick and now he's just he's just goofing on me  That's fine he's grown that's character development that's you know, it's growth it's growth  Yeah, well if you didn't find that exciting let me talk about how uh, the the there is though the  Parking rates have changed and in some cases gone down by 45  There is one thing about the parking experience that has maintained it is still incredibly confusing  We all parked in different places  We didn't understand where we did and why we all had to follow a series of signs that took you into narrow corridors  The kind of thing you don't want to be in during a pandemic  Uh, it was as confusing as ever and but again normalcy.
 I kind of like that  Yeah, and they had  They had social distanced the cars  with with cones in between each space  which  What are we doing here folks?  Like there's some basic information about what's actually a concern and I don't think the cars are going to catch covid from each other  Uh, which is what I think that was signaling to me that they thought perhaps a car  Would get covid from another car and then infect a family cars get sick  Well, well in a certain universe like mater  Oh, so you've seen cars sector keeper you've seen the movie cars we have movie nights at the compound at the cricket wireless compound  Oh, wow, so you like you like mater  Mm-hmm mater's funny  Yeah, yeah  Calling it the compound is a little unsettling it starts that's where it starts to feel like sort of a um, you know a nixie  Situation you don't all like dress identically.
 Do you brian has a lot of good ideas?  Brian has good ideas and we'll get well every  Well every afternoon we get together and play kickball and listen to his ideas  Oh, that's his brand ever like just like loudly discussed  His iq test.
 Does he like say what his iq is a strange amount of times?  Yeah every day  Every day, huh? That's how we know you don't find that  Alarming or a little like uh, if somebody was really that smart they wouldn't have to  Say it no, he's like bill nye  Okay, brian from cricket wireless is like bill nye  Um, okay  I just I guess just be on the lookout that if you if it goes beyond ideas to way make the business better  And heads into I don't know like ways to ascend to higher  Planes or achieve better and I want to say a bad word in front of you  But orgasms if it gets into like that just be on the lookout for some for shady language from brian.
 Yeah, okay  I will  I'll tell you this.
 I I felt like I needed bill nye to figure out how to get out of that dang parking garage  They made walking through it as confusing as driving through it now with this uh security  Uh screening stuff.
 Well, they don't do security screening.
 No, no still no metal detectors to get into city  Yeah, orlando has the metal detectors, but universal does not holly in hollywood does not have them yet, right?  Um, they have yes the temperature check they have also and I really should have written down exactly what it was.
 They have the  virhovan  Cheery voice telling you to wear a mask and social distance at city walk  Oh, it's the classic universal voice.
 It was kind of nice to hear the voice again, even though it's saying scary things  Yeah that uh, there's like a line and like people in masks and then the classic universal voice  Telling you not to get sick  Uh, so I'll be honest I was a little stressed there that was stressful  but then when we emerged so we emerge out and if you if I had to  To bet a thousand dollars.
 I would have bet that we were coming out right by the movie theater  We were not coming out by the movie theater.
 We were coming out  by the the uh  NBC bar and grill or whatever and the the bamboo cage  Ceiling area of city walk and let's be clear that NBC grill is not it's completed  But it's empty and the tvs are all on outside  But and inside and inside but I don't yeah think it's officially open even though it has a decent sized outdoor dining  area  Yes  Um, so we can't really tell you much about the nbc sports grill and brew unfortunately, so keeper.
 Hope that's okay  Yeah, we know it's a good idea.
 We just don't know you can't even tell me if they have lester holt ribs  Well, i'm hoping  Yeah, we're hoping uh, maybe maybe don't know yet maybe you'll have to go back boys  Huh, I don't I hope that it gets that creative with the uh, you know blacklist burgers and uh,  What's uh, zoe's incredible?  uh pizza zoe's  That's good that's good  I will say, uh if for nothing else we have to go back to meet latte  So we'll at least get back there to meet latte  Do you think we're getting a latte or they just shipping that latte or they overnighting that latte to the hollywood one?  You're saying maybe they won't have separate lattes  Hmm  I don't know.
 It depends how how much longer we're in lockdown.
 That's true.
 But then latte could be a spreader  What if somebody gave latte?  Covid in florida and then it's shipped here and then it spreads it here  And then latte gives it to a car in the parking garage and all the other cars get it  They all their hoods pop up.
 They're all coughing  And then they give it to uh one of jay's cars in the big dog garage and then it's over all of burbank  My family they're all sick  I lost every last one of them  All 300  And the motorcycles too.
 I knew it was a problem when the motorcycles got it  the sweet innocent motorcycles  300 sounds low, doesn't it? Yeah, he probably has more cars than cars.
 Yeah  Uh, so we emerge we emerged in the bamboo cage ceiling area  And I think I said and I was feeling I go i'm a little emotional  Yeah  But uh, I haven't I really we have really not been out much late at all.
 We're very very uh locked down here  Uh, and it was like a mixture of being outside  And in a place I have a lot of fondness for  So it wasn't like bawling or anything, but I was like, huh? I'm a little touched  I'm a little i'm a little moved  I could tell it was affecting you guys in another way because both it seems like both of you guys like forgot how to walk  You're both well, like straining yours like mike you walked up like a half set of stairs and we're like, oh god  Never walk anymore.
 Well, I was oh, okay.
 You explain yourself.
 I'll explain myself  Well, I think cycle psychologically I get very i've only been into a couple stories.
 I would we're crazy about keeping inside so  I was in a best buy for like eight minutes and like I start to like I feel physical problems  Like I have a mental block of being around people a lot in this situation  Even if I kind of intellectually know  That this is probably fine.
 So I think it's something that you did it.
 I'm glad you you did this  Yeah, and also it's affecting the fact that i've mentioned this on the show before  Somebody once referred to my walk as the walk of a fancy horse  so I think that  Whatever anxiety I was feeling  And it was it was low anxiety wasn't like crazy or anything.
 But whatever I was feeling was certainly affecting my gait  It was certainly affecting the the manner in which I moved  Mike's trot looks weird  Mike's trot looks weird.
 He should have brought a salt lick along for comfort  Yeah, yeah, so that was that was I think probably any any strange energy.
 I was giving off  Well, and I just got I got a cramp so I have been  uh when when  The first few months of lockdown I was making sure to like walk like take a long walk every day  and then  Uh half the state of california caught on fire  So trying to do a walk hurt both my eyes and my chest  So I really had not been walking very much the air quality slowly clearing up  Um, I might still kind of bothering my eyes.
 But um  Uh, yeah, so if I don't like stretch I forgot to like stretch in the morning  So I got a cramp like and we we took a sit upstairs in the totally empty seating area  You gotta limber up.
 Uh, yeah city walk you gotta  I was very worried worried about you.
 I'll be honest.
 I was like I looked over and I was like what?  Well, yeah, we were coming up a slight incline and I was like my my leg was cramping up.
 So  But had an ice it for a few minutes and then I felt fine.
 So  Uh, I forgot that yeah, you're right  It has been harder to walk because of air quality and and I have I have something that circumvents all this as I said  Which is that i'm putting on daily dance parties, uh for a baby.
 Um  Uh sector keeper.
 I don't know if you know this.
 I have a kid now that happened since  Since I talked to you last.
 Yeah.
 Yeah  thanks, um, there is uh, i'm sorry to say that I have another child in my life and it's a little  More I have to defer to him over you i'm glad when you if you ever need it, let me know  No, no, of course, of course no, so good boy has good boy  Hey, that's that's how I felt about it  And the only thing that I do feel guilty about is that you know, I know you remember how we met all your cousins and  They sent us on all these different adventures that we got to do.
 Yeah  The expeditions are just I mean they're already tough because of lockdown and now with the extra time being apparent  I'm just like i'm not sure how many of your cousins i'm gonna get to  Hang with in the near future.
 It's just very imposing to do these  30 day series or whatever.
 Well, we met one of them not long ago.
 Yeah, he did.
 Oh, right.
 He was a jerk  Hey, we met the american dream keeper from new jersey.
 I don't know how well you know him.
 He was an absolute ass  Yeah, he was mean to us.
 Yeah.
 Yeah, I know i'm okay from um  From like christmas and stuff, you know when you get together.
 Um,  Oh, that's a bummer.
 I'm sorry to hear that.
 Uh, uh, hey, but scott.
 I know you're saying you're maybe a little low on time  Remember spirits live forever.
 So we'll we'll always have time for you.
 Well, you'll get to it  Well, that's nice  All right, so we'll do we'll get to we'll get through that full list when i'm like by the time i'm like  74  Yeah, yeah  74.
 Yeah.
 Yeah, and none of it's behind the paywall  And in the meantime since scott can't care for you, uh, sector keeper, whatever whenever you get out of the compound just move on with jason  Yeah, sure.
 Yeah, i'd love that.
 Yeah.
 Yeah  We just gotta make sure to do some some stretching and walk it with me because I clearly my body will just fall apart  Oh like visiting my grandpa  Yeah  Basically, yeah.
 Yeah  I'm, assuming uh grandparents also have allergy attacks in their eyes as well.
 Like I've been experiencing for about a week.
 So  And get tummy aches from drinking seltzer  That was me.
 Yeah, that was that was both  We both we both done that before.
 Yeah, we agreed on that boy.
 That was my favorite part of the kusamigos  Imagine me listening to that and like I can't respond to this right now kusamigos episode  I I was so amped up for it.
 I don't remember most of it  Hey, that was one of the yeah mike and I working on our marketing plan, you know  We met up to take pictures on uh los angeles city bikes  Oh, that's right.
 Yeah, you guys met up.
 Yeah.
 Yeah, but the three and after our big fight we hadn't convened  We had a person and we got to do it here  You know what would help you jason, uh, I think with future uh walks and posture and not sprangling if you say fruits and vegetables  I don't want to hear it again.
 No, that's a lost cause  Um, no, i'm i'm talking about you need some better  footwear  Uh big new big headline new we really buried the lead that the flip-flop shop is gone  and instead it's replaced by  Hawaii enos, hava  Anas, havaianas, uh, it is not havalinas the wild boar found in parts of the world  But have I not just full of boars when you open the door?  Um, yeah, it's the flip-flop shop has been replaced by a different store that sells flip-flops  wow, it's  It's a bit of a lateral move you might say  Not that that's bad extremely.
 Yeah  no, brian says there's no bad ideas  Oh, but see he's conditioning you i think brian might have some really bad ideas  What so havaianas did you get to go inside did you try on flip-flops  I I did I looked around a little bit.
 I asked them some questions.
 They said they were from brazil  I said cool.
 They asked if I wanted to try anything on I was like absolutely not i'm not gonna go  Like I don't think i'd be doing that anyway for foot cleaning  You don't want to try a barefoot shoe on during pandemic  During pandemic it didn't sound good to me.
 No despite how nice the person in there  Was made me feel awkward and then I left uh right away.
 So, uh, that's that's my report about  Havaianas shit.
 Yeah, there was three it said three customers could go in at a time scott was the only customer in  jason and I looked through the window as if there was some sort of uh  A bunch of chocolate being made or something.
 Yes, and I later learned that uh  Havaianas embodies brazil's fun and vibrant and spontaneous way of life and at  200 million sold a year.
 It's the most popular flip-flop brand in the world both of those  according to the havaianas  Twitter and website and that sort of thing  Yeah  uh, I was looking online because you know  We we of course talked about the sock market in the city walk  So I was looking online to see if there were any maybe like dirty flip-flops  With like a dirty message on them or an aggressive message  So you were looking for dirty mike carlson google's dirty flip-flop.
 That's not a foot fetish thing  That is just I was looking for for comedy  Like the sock that said carpe the fuck out of this dm  Mm-hmm famously, uh, but there's nothing like that.
 It's all there's a couple, uh, you know  stranger things and star wars flip-flops, but mostly  I mean the most outrageous thing is there's a skull  There's a skull on some flip-flops, I think  Wow  That's about the extent of how how crazy the brand is  Well, I guess that's that yeah, so  Hey since you you mentioned the sock market  There's exciting developments since we were there.
 We were there on a wednesday friday afternoon  There was an update on the city walk on the universal studios hollywood twitter account city walk update  Wetzel's pretzels and la sock market have reopened both are open friday through sunday only noon to eight p.
m  so  A return to normal, huh?  Yeah  For the weekend, yeah  Yeah, because wetzel's was closed where I have a picture of you despairing outside of it.
 Well, jason was happy.
 I was happy  I was happy.
 Oh because that you made the what defeated your stomach, uh before the  indoor skydiving the beast has been felled during the week.
 Yes.
 Yes, senator giebert  If sock market strong economy us economy good  I guess that's fair  Well, I mean the fed has been pumping the sock market full of  Liquidity actually during this last six to nine months  Uh, so some people would say that just because the sock market is strong.
 It doesn't necessarily reflect to the actual economy, especially right now  So I just say and there's been a little bit of a pullback lately, uh on the stock on the stock market  so people are a little bit, uh  Worried people are still cautious as far as the stock market goes and not maybe not willing to carpe the fuck out of this dm  That's what steve munchen and larry kudlow said, uh last week at least  They were they were really waiting for the the minions  Sequel socks and the wonder woman 84 socks and like all the stuff that's been pushed the black widow socks.
 Um,  Yeah, they're thinking that the stim if they're if they have to pass another stimulus for all of us before maybe there's more  More faith in the sock market.
 Hmm  Yeah, so  We figured it out.
 We figured it out.
 Yeah.
 Um, the what have we not  What's in that list that we haven't done to make sure we cover?  Anteheato's  Oh anteheato's.
 I can't tell if you did finish talking about nbc's  I  I think we did  There's just not a lot we can say it's the former tony romas  Um, and they did almost nothing to it except put on a tv that plays  For no one.
 Mm-hmm  Anteheato's I have been  Anteheato's a few times now before pandemic.
 Have you guys been I forget I did in florida  Not not here.
 I really like uh, I have not been  But you I went I went before horror nights last year  I went we were we saw some movie.
 I forget what movie and we saw we ate there before i'm i'm i'm into it  I like it a lot.
 All three of us agreed.
 We're not really like  ready to eat at a table with other people outside of our bubbles yet even outside so we  we uh, yeah, we did not eat at anahito's or the  Bubba gump or outside, uh bubblegump annex where the hat stands hat stands are currently inactive.
 No hat stands  Right now.
 Well, take it from someone who's died a good call  Yeah, hopefully no no ghost boys join you uh as much as you might like having some new friends  Yeah, my friend  Menchies was open was it? Yeah, I oh, okay minchi bad boy  Yeah, I guess menchies menchies is one of the people that's been around for a long time  I don't know if you guys know menchies  Minchi bad boy.
 Yeah, I guess menchies menchies is one of the people that early on was saying  We must keep the economy open.
 So  That's just I guess  Yeah menchies point of view I guess  You got to use gloves.
 I think I think that was a big change at menchies  You have to use gloves to because you because menchies you have to and we've talked about this before  I don't really care as much for scooping my own toppings on frozen yogurt  But this new change is not that they do it for you.
 It's that you just put on like disposable gloves  That seemed that seemed to be the vibe or you have to bring your own winter gloves into a menchie  They've got to be padded yeah  Leather gloves leather vortex at least bring a byo g.
 Yeah, that's right  Bring your own gloves tcby is now byo g  airtight and jason  Jason did not have his frozen yogurt gloves with I did not have the frozen  gloves  um  Uh, no, so we didn't end up eating anything up there.
 But you know what we did what we felt we had to do  Was support the local businesses of city walk and we bought some masks and not just any masks  but masks with the classic neon  Universal studios logo and we got some photos that will post of the three of us looking very happy and normal  all wearing  matching  cool retro masks.
 It's almost better.
 We have a new way to express ourselves.
 It's cool.
 It's cool  We cool.
 We we put them on we oh, they were sealed in bags  We opened up those bags put them right on and boy.
 Did they smell like industrial grade shit?  They stink to high heaven  Three just three boys and stinky masks.
 Well, surely these are not just repurposed novelty panties  We said as we put them on our faces  You think they're  like vending machine  Is this the debut of the word panties on podcast the ride no, I don't  We might just call it edible underwear, maybe I was gonna say I think that's the body word panties well, we're behind the paywall.
 Yeah  But it just felt like very thin like like joke gag gag material like it didn't feel like joke gag joke gag  Well it was like a Halloween costume  Yeah like a Halloween costume  We were wearing a sliced up Dracula's cape  Yes  But we were tricked into buying because it had a 90s thing on it  It fit fine.
 I mean it was fine.
 It's probably fine  I it was the first time I encountered small medium and large masks.
 Like I think we all just bought mediums  Yeah, I don't know my mask size.
 Yeah the hell yeah  Um, you gotta get sized you got you guys haven't gotten sized at a tailor for your mask  No  I'll be unfitted.
 Okay, my luxury mask.
 I went to Joseph a bank and got sized for my mask  That's weird, I thought everyone did that  You're gonna like the way you mask I guarantee it  Um, you bought uh, all the retro stuff is out at the studio store scott.
 You bought the mug you bought the coffee mug  I bought a mug.
 That was nice.
 Yeah, it's nice to see all the basic stuff in the studio store.
 Nice to see the retro  logos  um  Yeah, um just just nice to be there and be spending you know, I've  I've really missed giving my money to this place.
 I didn't give any money to abercrombie kids  Um, that's a new place sector keeper.
 You were excited about that because that's a kid's thing  abercrombie kids  Sort of like  off-puttingly  uh breathy  I feel  I guess you I guess that's just childlike joy, but abercrombie abercrombie  Is for the cool kid  Oh wow, so so the kids you know are all no I forget what is your age? What is your age at this point?  What?  I'm just forgetting because you're working so you're not like an eight-year-old kid.
 Are you i'm well, I i'm timeless.
 I'm i'm  I'm as old as I was when I passed don't oh don't drum that up michael  Oh, i'm sorry.
 Okay.
 I'm sorry.
 I'm so sorry.
 I didn't mean to do that.
 I didn't  Reopening wounds.
 Yeah, that's my fault.
 Um  Isn't it just like universal that if you're wearing abercrombie, you're one of the cool kids  That is universal and that's probably why universal chose to uh open it up there  Yeah, yeah  So basically there's a new there's a new door that says abercrombie kids so you can enter a different way  That's a kid section.
 I went up to the door you guys encouraged me to you have a kid you get in there  I started opening the door and I was like, I don't need to know what's in  Abercrombie kids I could see through the it's all I don't know.
 It's all like khaki pants, but little that's the end of that  Well, and we can get yeah.
 Yeah.
 Sorry.
 Go ahead  Oh, I was gonna say we're all this made because there was a new store called production central that replaced the old skate shop  Uh that used to be next to like hot topic around that area and that was closed when we were up there  It appeared to have the identical material for the identical product for sale.
 It's the studio store half a block down  But with a really bad logo a terrible font that they did add that yeah  um  What haven't we  Tilly's  Oh, man, well everyone buckle up for the 30 minutes of tilly's talk  Um, it's a small tilly's which mike and jason have go  It's like tilly's but it's small.
 It used to be angel.
 It's now tilly's  It's small angel is now tilly's.
 No, it's now tilly's  You know what? I'm sorry.
 Maybe i'm getting these tillies  Angel is tilly's that's a big adjustment for you to make I know  Hmm you're trying you're trying to square it  Is not angel  No, not the other way  Yeah, why even so much problem with so much of a problem with this  Tillie's is cool.
 Yeah  Angel is now tilly's  Hmm, he's you weren't brian isn't putting stuff in your water.
 Is he?  Brian no brian's no, he's just in his recliner behind me  He's writing in his journal  He's fully clothed, right? Yeah.
 Oh, yeah.
 Yeah  Can I ask is brian does brian like um purified rain water and grain alcohol?  Whoa, yeah, wait, whoa, you know brian  Yeah, yeah sure  Okay, huh?  Let's probably move on  I just think you should get out.
 I think I think you should get out of there and we should you guys are gonna  Help me get out of here.
 Yeah.
 Well if and again if we don't do it jason will come and help  Yeah, well if and again if we don't do it jason will come and replace you.
 Yeah  Get to hang out with brian and drink rain water all day as long as you can walk around and you can get some exercise  Jason there's a lot of land  I you know, I like that  Sounds good  Clear air up there when it's not on fire and brian will make you walk because brian monitors everyone's weight.
 Oh, that's true  Um  So a back to away from the ranch back to the compound back to city walk.
 Um, this is uh,  I I went a little above and beyond this wasn't on the list, but I did want to address something odd  That I found about city walks past  Somehow during the saga.
 There's a thing that completely  Eluded us and i'll explain how I got to it  Uh, um, I was uh, I mentioned a thing a long time ago on the show called shangri-la plaza this weird  failed pilot that actually starred alison mac aka  pimp mac of the nixxiom organization  uh  And uh, there was I don't know it was this weird like kooky pilot about a strip mall.
 Uh, I I did an interview about it  Uh, uh that a listener, uh wrote and for la magazine you can look that up  But I was looking up like who because there's a really distinct like vibe to this  Uh to this show in this place and I looked it up and it's a guy who was a production designer of uh,  Pee-wee's playhouse.
 So it's got that vibe and i'm like what else did this guy build because he's got a cool artistic sense  And I saw something that he built that i'd never heard of that was at city walk called the panasonic pavilion  And i'm going to show you guys a picture of the panasonic pavilion.
 This place is crazy.
 Um, check that out  Oh  It's a it's like a carnival.
 It's like a merry-go-round  thing  Um with a lot of neon and like a big circus  Tent i'm still sort of confused about what this thing  Is uh, but then the only description i've been able to find about it is that uh, let me find it  It is a a it has it's an electro a panasonic electronic showroom featuring an interactive merry-go-round  with robotic animals created by steven spielberg  What the hell what was this steven spielberg made a bunch of plastic animals  He handmade them.
 I mean  I think so.
 He overs  He was really active in all this stuff for a while.
 Obviously we have not done his restaurant yet.
 That's on the list  Oh, I can't dive.
 Yeah, uh  and he obviously, you know universal and  I I I don't know.
 It's it's looks cool.
 It looks cool as shit.
 It looked really neat.
 That's a cool vibe, right?  I wish there was more information about it.
 And if anyone listeners know anything about the very  Cool looking but dull named panasonic pavilion, but then I kept going like what else were there other things like this like kind of weird  The world's fairish stuff and this guy the same designer jeremy railton  Um also on his website.
 There was something listed called hollow world  hollow world was a restaurant in pasadena in the mid 90s  And when you hear hollow worlds, what does that sound like to you? What do you think hollow world is?  The hollow earth.
 Hello.
 Not that spelling of hollow.
 No.
 Oh, okay  I was thinking kevin bacon  Kevin bacon.
 Not no also again.
 Not that no  It wasn't a themed experience.
 It wasn't a restaurant themed after the the creepy film hollow man.
 Is it how michael eiser says? Hello?  hollow  Hello world.
 Hello  No, no, I heard hollow grah holo and I thought hologram was this some kind of hologram  Oh restaurant and then I kept looking and no the answer is it is an alien themed restaurant  Because it's an it's a restaurant where you learn the story of an alien named hollow  showello  um, it is hollow is a  alien  Who?  Is telling us about he when you go to the restaurant?  He narrates the story of our planet back to us how aliens built our pyramids stonehenge  He tells us about what area 51 is all about seems like kind of a cousin of blue 32.
 Wow.
 Um  So this was open in pasadena for like nine months.
 It was very brief  but  huh  It's called hollow world yet.
 It's about aliens and then it also has a laser tag that is about dinosaurs  And then also there's a volcano in the front that erupted every 20 seconds  Which seems like a lot seems like a lot.
 Yeah in barbaryttaville vegas that volcano goes off like once an hour  20 seconds is a ton of eruptions the lava fees alone  Uh, is there a photo of this anywhere? No, I don't think so  And again, I implore a listener if you have one or if there is one because I think other ones did open  I think they tried to do this in dallas and maybe atlanta  Uh, um, and it didn't work.
 I'm so confused by it.
 What's that?  And it did not work  And it did not work people did not want to go eat and learn the legend of hollow the alien  Um and play dinosaur laser tag  Um, though there was a big kickoff event where all of hollywood's biggest stars came to check it out  nichelle nichols from star trek  grizzly adams himself dan haggardy  Wow, really and uh the the biggest and brightest star kato kalen  They all gathered in pasadena to learn about hollow the alien.
 Is there a photo of that?  No, I looked on getty editorial like to see if there was a movie premiere picture, but there wasn't there's no grizzly adams  And kato kalen picture  You can't see grizzly and kato fighting an alien or fighting a dinosaur with lasers anywhere  Which kills me it kills me inside did not get to see this this feels fake  It's all very strange, but it's corroborated by if you I I  Forgive me for going on this rabbit hole, but I have to I made me feel so crazy  I kept googling and somehow discovered that gary coleman didn't just attend this  Opening he was the spokesperson.
 He was a paid member of the staff of hollow what?  Because gary coleman in general is very interested was very interested in  Interest it was very interested in arcades  Did you know that in 1993 gary coleman opened the gary coleman game parlor in fisherman's village in marina del rey?  california  The shooting location of arrested development.
 Um, it the motto of the gcgp  Was our games are easier so you can play longer it went out of business in 1994  1994 oh  What?  Is there a photo of that? No, there's no photographic evidence  What?  Why I gotta get off this compound man  This is this is like you're hallucinating all this  It's got whatever you're smoking.
 I want some of it  What kind of doobies are you smoking these days scott  Um, it's gary coleman lost 200 000 during this endeavor  In the brief year that it was open he was talking it up like it's great  Everybody loves it big success coming to my game parlor and not only that I gary coleman am developing a new sitcom  In the sitcom I play an arcade owner  The sitcom never aired and there are no photographs of it.
 Did they shoot a pilot? Do we know don't know that  I can't tell you that you said  the  arcade  Idea is games last longer  Um our games are easier so you can play longer.
 So there's no like super challenging games  Isn't point of arcade more quarters?  That's right  I guess it might be and with harder games.
 Maybe they would have had 200 000  200 000 more quarters  That might have been the problem with the business model  That's like a like pay what you want kind of I think it's kind of sweet that gary thought he could pull this off  Well, he's right those games especially for kids  You'd go this is so hard and i'm just spending so much money  so that must have been a thing of concern he had and I  I my head is off to him for trying to solve that problem.
 Yeah.
 Yeah  You tried but he sank  Uh, we'll cover that in the first  The first time we're speechless thinking about easy arcade games.
 Yeah  Wow i'm imagining being there playing and just for hours hours all on one quarter.
 Yeah, you show up at 10 a.
m  Gary coleman checks in on you.
 Hey you need anything? All right.
 Well, hey, i'm right here.
 I'm the owner  I'm gary.
 Let me know if you need anything and then 6 p.
m  Um, this is business manager his business manager comes up and he's like we've made eight quarters today  That's all we've made gary.
 This isn't gonna work.
 That's fine.
 We're gonna be here for 20 years at least  It'll pay for itself in 20 years  So that's we'll cover that in the fisherman's village, um fiasco fiasco  Yeah, great, um, well and we'll cover hollow world of course as well.
 Um, I yeah my sailor cousin stuck there  In fisherman village  So he's like at sea and he can't find a dock.
 Yeah, he needs a dock  He needs you all to build a dock by discussing everything  Has brian screened the lighthouse for you in the compound the will defoe robber paddison  No, we only have one copy of um of cars  on uh hd dvd  Oh, yeah that for that that was a pain  So you've watched cars at least once a week for six months straight.
 Mm-hmm.
 Yeah  Do you like doc are you a fan of doc? Yeah doc rules  Mm-hmm.
 Yeah, uh, how about  um lightning mcqueen.
 Yeah lightning mcqueen rules  How about uh luigi  Yeah, luigi rules  Where are we going with this line of questioning?  Hold on.
 I gotta get to the imdb real quick.
 Oh, no.
 All right.
 I'll get someone call off.
 Hurry.
 Um, I I mean what have we not  Talked about.
 Um, well, I mean we could talk about what I got  Oh, yes, let's absolutely so bubblegum shrimp was open and they were blasting all the cool tunes  And it was a good vibe going on and I said, you know what I don't really want to eat  At bubblegum, but maybe i'll take some food to go  Was the filthy shrimp outside?  The dirt, you know the man  The uh, you're talking about the shrimp mascot that always looks like he rolled in a pile of mud  Before coming out and waving to people  He he was not out there.
 I think maybe that's well, honestly that would might be safer for him  Or her whoever's playing the shrimp  Um, because you know you can that's a good barrier for  For air for aerosols  Um, but no that no shrimp  Um, so I went up to the menu  They told me okay.
 Here's here's what I should have done for the good of the show  And I didn't do it and everyone can be mad at me.
 They told me I could order an alcoholic drink  Right and they have and as maybe you may remember from the city walk saga.
 I thought I was drinking an alcoholic drink  I was not as eva anderson said you were drinking an ice cream smoothie  And two of them and licking the glass  I licked the glass sugar off the rim in my car  Yes, the rim in my car.
 I licked sugar off of a rim of a plastic  Bubba gum shrimp glass in scott's car on the way back to my apartment clean on the out team my memories this  These precious moments  That class clean on the outside cream on the inside ice cream smoothie ice cream smoothie  And she was like you can order whatever she's like  She can or you can order whatever you want and we'll wrap it up  But you can't drink it out here.
 You can't drink it like walking around  And then I was like, okay if I order a crazy funny thing  Should I go to the top of the parking garage and drink it or am I really going to transport?  An alcoholic drink in my car on the way back to burbank  What if it spills?  What if I get arrested so wait just you know, you could take it to go but you couldn't drink  Yes on the patio upstairs where we were hanging out  No, not there because if you remember how the moon has a policy of no drinking on the actual  Like sidewalk area they had to surf an alcoholic drink  You had to give your alcoholic drink over to an employee and you would go to their like like mandated patio  That was approved for drinking and then they would surf your drink  Literally two feet across the sidewalk to you and their other area that they said was okay for it  Right.
 It's not like public.
 Florida's different.
 Yeah, it was like public consumption  Law.
 Yeah, I I did see other bars  This is not an uncommon thing right after we did out at the moon  I did hear about other bars that had to do that  But it's very weird with city walk because this mix of public and private land that like yeah, you gotta jump through all these  You gotta drink the alcohol drink in at your home or in the bubblegum eating pens  So like I I wanted to force another like snow monster situation where I was trying to like hide and secretly drink  on the top of a parking garage and then I thought of the scenario like  I'll get arrested at the city walk jail and that would be great for  Be great for the content of the show  But then i'm going to be in a small place with people like people and I don't want that  So I apologize.
 The many people they arrested that day.
 Yes, the many people many city walk felons  Yes, yeah  So I apologize to the listener for not  making something clums like making myself have to do something clumsily or  Put myself in a weird situation.
 So I ordered instead I ordered the uh,  a southern charmed fried shrimp  Sounds like  Like sorry to interrupt  But sounds like unfinished business  Oh no  Yeah, I guess it is  I guess maybe I should go back and and do it and try to find the funniest silliest slushy drink and actually have alcohol  in it and then  Drink it in the parking garage somewhere.
 I guess I should have done that curious george  Yeah, I guess I maybe I should you know what I should do is I should prep for this more I should get like a big  brown paper bag  And bring it with me  You're and put the yeah.
 Yeah, Jason.
 Well, you're a tall guy  You could hike at the next to the studio store.
 They had a big green grass wall blocking you from going by the globe  So you should like hoist yourself up and like kick your little your little feeties like on the wall drink a big drink  You should sit on the wall the big grass wall.
 Oh, I should sit like humpty dumpty on the wall and drink a slushy drink  Well, that's a that's kind of advertising what i'm doing.
 I guess so  I'm trying to be incognito.
 I don't know.
 Sometimes it feels good to kick your feeties  Well, I can't argue with that  We should have tried to at least without even without an alcoholic drink  We should have tried to sit on top of the green wall, which is something we also have to talk about  Yeah, but uh to sum up I took the southern  charmed fried shrimp home and it was fine  What does charmed mean it was okay.
 What do you what is southern charmed?  Uh, it is fries and slaw served with cocktail and tartar sauce  That's what southern charmed it did not taste much different than uh,  Fried shrimp you'd get from the supermarket  And it and it costs what twenty twenty dollars.
 Yeah, it was  Thirteen dollars because it was a lunch special.
 Oh, okay.
 Okay  so that's if it was I there was  I was thinking about getting a surf and turf for like 45 dollars, but I decided against that  Driving home with a full surf and turf in your car.
 Yeah, I will I I will hear one strike against bubba gump  Is they don't have the name or logo on any of their to go?  Uh things the bag didn't say bubba gump the container that that got it in didn't say bubba gump  But I would really like a little of that  Because that would make me feel good having a bubba gump bag in the house  So lindsay probably didn't believe you.
 I don't know.
 I don't know.
 I don't know  There's no way you have bubba gum.
 She was very skeptical.
 Uh, she  Tasted it and she was like this isn't bubba gum, but she threw it against the wall.
 You're a fucking liar.
 Michael  Says no southern charm  There's no I can't even detect a spice.
 I can't even detect  Yeah, no, it's true.
 It's true.
 I was the liar that day.
 Yeah, um, I mean  I was the liar that day.
 I was the liar that day  Um, I mean, you know in terms of culinary experiences  Some of the listeners if you if you subscribed to any universal studios hollywood emails  You might have been here  You may have been getting updates over the last few months about some of the the opportunities there are to go  You know try foods and hang out with your friends and take pictures of food that you're having with your friends  I mean you got we we all subscribe to these email.
 We've been seeing the  Please go back to city walk emails, right? Yeah.
 Yes.
 I i've got some of my favorites in front of me scott  Did you have ones you wanted to share or I did I did a little bit here you go  We might we might have doubled up a little.
 Okay.
 Um, well i'll start with this one  Uh, I actually learned about this one from our an upcoming guest shared this online  um and uh  Date night at city walk missing date night.
 This is where it's at  When you're ready for date night city walk is here for you  So and then like we have enhanced sanitation measures and implemented additional measures for  Distance spacing and screen like everything has to have the scary copy right after  Yeah, uh, yeah every every email has a scary copy  I mean this all started back at the start of july when city walk reopened  Uh city, uh universal hollywood also promoting city walk  Uh city, uh universal hollywood also promoting city walk on their twitter account  They post some you know  They post funny memes about like pinocchio sleeping and they got some real flack because they posted one of those the day they  Permanently laid off like hundreds of people  Here's another favorite email get those steps in and enjoy the scenery at the same time  Did you know walking a circuit on city walk from the iconic universal studios hollywood globe fountain?  To the far end of the street and back will net you approximately one thousand steps  Do it five times and you'll be halfway to your ten thousand  Daily required steps ten times and score because you'll have reached your daily goal  Now that email was sent, uh august 21st when we were in the middle of a heat wave  Temperatures topped 95 degrees that weekend  And two weeks later was the hottest recorded day in la county history at 121 degrees in woodland hills nearby  So get up here get your steps gang bring the whole fam walk a few miles in a heat wave at city walk  Which uh, we could not famously uncovered very little shade city  Oh  And yeah by about that screen there's there's zero shade yes, there's zero shade and like there was a wall  There's a big green grass wall blocking us from the iconic globe fountain  Oh, yeah, you can't even get to the globe.
 Yeah  You can't even gram it with your besties  So jason, are you thinking though while the when the temperature drops though?  Maybe this is the solution to to limbering up your muscles  I mean we might be like becoming mall walkers michael like the the older folks who walk at malls because city walks pretty empty  You know, I think there was as many guests up there as there were security guards  Well, you know like they say, uh ten times and score  Ten times and score you've reached your daily goal.
 We're all saying it.
 Everyone is gamifying  City walk walking at city walk.
 It's sweeping the city  And then yeah scott.

Yeah, is it like the their their arms the arms of them all that are touching you?  Yeah, it's funny I don't know it seems like a lot of the language in these emails matches the cricket wireless compound manifesto  Oh  There's some  Well, how yeah how many?  You're showing me right now.
 You're holding up this big binder that says cricket wireless manifesto.
 How many pages is that sector keeper?  It's just over 600  Just there's also there's also a workbook  Could you could you open to a random page and just read a little bit from it for us sure  Sure, you want me to call out a number sure.
 Yeah  Uh page  521  521 that's towards the end  That is yeah, you're right.
 It is towards the end  He's getting there almost  Rippling through okay  Oh, this is uh, this is towards the beginning uh, or towards the beginning of the finals chapter  uh chapter 7  Right go ahead  Okay, so  This chapter is entitled.
 Uh, the power of the individual is stronger than the power of the collective  Okay, okay good, okay got it so um, let's see  When working at cricket wireless remember that your power is stronger than the power of the teams  There is no team  If you're considering  Forming a team  Remember that the team weakens  What the individual can deliver?  Everything you need is inside of you  If you ever see anyone trying to form a team say a  To form a team say in a break room  During lunch or even after hours getting drinks be sure to tell brian  Remember there is no power in the collective  Wow, huh?  Oh my god  Well, it also but also we can see the pages that you're reading from and there's a bunch of like smiling suns and colorful squiggles  All over.
 Yeah, that's sunny.
 He guides you through it  Oh some mascot  To conveying all these dark mess.
 I feel like it's tricking you  Um, I mean, this is a little bit of grim stuff to us that we haven't been onboarded  Yeah, I feel like maybe he means they mean something else by team.
 There's might be another word  that he was  Using meant to use there, but that's just kind of a feeling I have I don't know  I could be wrong.
 I don't know brian's heart  Yeah, well also you can color in sunny so that's cool  Oh, well, that's cool.
 He looks cute.
 Yeah, he's a cute mascot.
 He's a cute mascot.
 Would you call him a friend?  Oh, yeah, absolutely  Do you think you need some friend time? It's been too long since you've hung out with their friends  But when you get ready to roll city walk is ready for you  And that email came friday afternoon short, you know, just a couple days after we had been there.
 So they had our ticket, you know  This is what we did except that this photo of these girls in these cool hats outside of uh, voodoo donuts aren't  Distancing at all.
 No, no, man.
 There's no mask.
 Yeah, and they don't even have like the mask around  It's not even like they pulled it down to eat the donut.
 They're just no they don't even exist the man  Yeah, i'm gonna assume that they're in a cluster together for the sake of but even still they should be wearing masks for other  people  Um, but if you're gonna cluster together, why do you need to get out and go to city wall?  You're already having fun at home.
 Yeah, right if you're having a fun cluster at home why take it to city walk?  It's more it's more howl at the moon is even there.
 Yeah.
 Yeah, what's even the point? Um, I  I got there's one of these emails that I want to point out and I  Found it a little odd, but still kind of fun.
 Um, there's a picture  I think they're trying to do that kind of like instagrammable  snacks  sort of vibe  So I ended up with with this eats treats photo ops and it's a picture of one of those mini monster things  Whatever you're feeling we've got it grab a bite for dinner satisfy your sweet tooth with dessert  Up for a mini monster boba anyone try it  But if you don't like it do not dare waste it waste is shame  Hide your shame at all costs if you try to throw a mini monster boba away  Everyone will be looking at you hide your shame hide your shame  Good boys don't waste food when you waste food mommy cries rock out with your besties at city walk  Huh?  Kind of crazy  You didn't get that one.
 I didn't get that one.
 That's interesting.
 It's yeah, it's odd.
 Very very specific  A little it got fun at the end, but seemed a little  Um, yeah, yeah a little dark in the middle.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 I mean that makes sense  I mean, it's don't want to make mommy mad  I'm I'm I don't want to do that.
 That's one of the things i'm scared the most about  I think that was in the same email that email the subject line was don't make mommy mad and then  Oh, right.
 Right.
 Right intriguing.
 You want to click on that like when a politician sends you an email with your name in the subject  Right.
 Wait, something's up.
 Something might be wrong with mommy.
 I better click this better click this look  It's national eat outside day.
 Okay, but that's not as important as keeping mommy happy  Is let me can I ask a question and I don't want to get us off on a whole thing here  Is city walk mommy?  Oh  Well, it was very comforting during a very dark time and I felt like I was inside of a city walk  Hug right as we know is what families give and get that is right.
 You're right about that  So yeah, I asked this question and we don't have to even answer it right now, but is city walk mommy?  Hmm just something to ponder I think I'm gonna have a full workbook tonight  You better for else you're not sleeping right that's what you said.
 Yeah  I'm gonna get that I'm gonna guess that that workbook poses the question is  It already answers it that brian is daddy  Oh, well, I haven't gotten there yet.
 Wow scott.
 Have you been to the compound?  Uh, I haven't and i'm pretty busy.
 I got the kid.
 I don't know if i'm willing to come visit the compound  Okay  Well jason's coming anyway  Oh, that's right.
 Jason.
 Well, especially if we don't wrap this thing up and get his soul free  I mean do we have I mean like city walk his mommy is a wonderful thought but wait  Is there is there any way to anything else we want to say about this experience? What a crazy way  To go back to this place that means so much to us  Yeah, I I I liked being there.
 It was certainly odd  for a lot of reasons  Uh, I also just it completely take the pandemic out of it  I will say even as much as for hard rock fallen brother and we won't see harper ray anymore  uh  That I am excited by the idea that there's going to be this big gaudy ass  Uh toothsome chalk like there is city walk is changing and I think I I was kind of getting excited for the possibilities of how  Uh tacky it's going to look in a couple years like it's going to take tacky is going to be  Taken up a couple notches.
 I think with that toothsome  There and I think at that point  As I was saying universal maybe gets rid of more  uh  Non-universal owned things.
 I am excited at the future a non-pandemic future  with maybe a uh, uh  Attackier city walk to come like it seems like it might have been in the past  I have high hopes for I have high hopes for the tackiness of mommy  Tacky is backy  That's a great way to put it yeah, yeah  So it's really the main thing like stringing you through this era like the hope of getting to be done with this and go visit  the the toothsome jock and latte and  Yeah, um, oh wait, this is bad news.
 Oh, no, I just clicked on  CNN and it seemed I guess trump's probable supreme court pick has spoken  At length in the past  I guess trump's probable supreme court pick has spoken at length in the past against chocolate emporiums  They might all be shut down  once she is installed so  chocolate emporium out vatican 2 out  There's a chance by the way, there's a chance that is that you're not making a joke and that is real  I it seems like the kind of thing right as we find a future episode  Chocolate's illegal what as a future? Yeah future episode.
 We did a little run of of that.
 Yeah, it seems possible  Chocolate is illegal in america  Says it in the bible somewhere uh, sector keeper in the manifesto.
 Is there anything about chocolate?  Hmm, let me look in the index  And take your time, please  Yeah, yeah, yeah, we want to make sure we hear your manifesto, let's see.
 Uh,  What's um, this is cricket wireless cricket wireless location  Coffee no no chalk.
 There's nothing about chocolate.
 Oh, that's too bad  That's a bummer brian imagines a world with no chocolate.
 Uh, it's full of cars.
 Um, well  Hey, what a blast to go up there.
 I guess  Did we make it?  Boys, boys, boys, you give me strength.
 You completed sector 20.
 I'm so proud of you boys  Even when things are absolute shit you did it  I'm so proud of you.
 I'm so proud of you  How does it feel boys? Thank you  It's I can't believe it's so wonderful to hear that again to get that approval the kind of approval that  Usually only comes from mommy  Uh, we also we also need it from you and I feel like we got a big city walk hug from you today sector keeper  Oh, thanks.
 Thank you.
 Likewise and jason, why don't you take a look at that coin?  Wow the coin  It's multiplied there's two now  That's your coins and you they're they're valid at gary coleman's arcade  Wow a parking coin that's also a defunct arcades coin pretty cool.
 That's right  That's right.
 Well boys i'm  I i i i i'm ascending.
 I i'm moving out of solving  I'm free  Free wow, he left he oh, yeah  He's he's wow.
 He's I can see his his uh, this beam of light  Uh traveling over the solvang hills.
 I guess we I guess we got him out of what is it?  I'm a free  Little one  Oh my gosh, he's singing a song a song a song that he made up for a  Yeah, is that a made up song? I think it's made up  little  Good good and remember  City walk was there for you when times were hard  So it only makes sense that we go back when we can go back safely and do it all over again  And it's not behind a paywall.
 We'll see you guys soon  Wait, what do you wait? What do you mean? You mean like the original saga again?  Hey, anything's possible.
 It's gonna be 2021  And everything's gonna be fine  Fine, okay.
 Yeah, let's just so let's not have too many more  Refrains of that song or else.
 They'll say the children psychos are gonna be on us  Yeah, we're gonna get accused of some stuff yeah, we're gonna get we're gonna get cuties we're gonna get oh no  Cuties.
 Um, okay.
 Well, I guess we have our marching orders which is what to do the  City walk saga again.
 Maybe he'll forget.
 I don't know  Well, we're gonna have to be next year doesn't have to be  But if tacky's back you we gotta check it out, right?  Well, I guess he's got a fair point heck I might go up next week.
 I mean I could work outside that empty area, you know  You won't run into a soul.
 It is a socially distanced place.
 So I recommend it to  Listeners just don't go all at once don't go put on cool hats and share donuts with people.
 You don't live with  um, and don't get any alcoholic beverages and try to brown bag them on top of a roof or you will be arrested you will be  arrested, yeah, yeah  So I guess wow, it's nice to say it again you survived the city walk saga  sector 20  Uh the end question mark who knows?  This this thing could go and go forever if it can surprise us  In the middle of a universal cruise line episode then it could come back really at any time during any episode  Especially here on the second gate.
 So please stay subscribed  Um, and so we'll do when you want to get to cruise line some other time then  Yeah, we'll just table it for now.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 We'll finish it out.
 Um, okay.
 Well fun stuff  Talk to everyone soon.
 Bye.
 All right.
 Goodbye.
 Bye
