 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
  May the third be with you.
  It's the Star Wars-esque day here on Pod gets the Ride.
  The second gate.
 I of course am Ben Scott Gerdneros.
  You got it.
 Joined by Michael Carl Rissian.
  I like that, that's good.
  And, okay.
 Alright, I'm just gonna try it.
  And of course, Jace Sheridindoo.
  Oh, Mace Windu.
  I was like, should it just be Jace Windu?  But then there's not enough of the real name.
 I don't think.
  I don't know.
 Look, these are up for grabs.
 The Supremacist is new.
  We've only ever done the Halloween names.
 But why not?  We're sort of making a tradition.
 I think we've loosely done May the fourth week episodes.
  Star Wars names seems like.
.
.
 So if you got a better one, or you give me one down the road, Jason, we'll make sure you're hooked up.
  I gotta look at the list of the Podracer names.
  Do you want me to list them? For the first time in my life.
  Yeah, yeah, go for it.
  So Bulba, Juan Sandage, Team Toppa Galeys.
  Jason Sandage? I don't know if I like that many better.
  Yeah, no.
  Something was weird about yours.
 But Jace I thought worked fine.
  Yeah, there's gotta be.
.
.
 Yeah, whatever.
 We'll figure it out.
  Look, we're workshopping.
 But I think that's it.
 Look, I think we can keep doing that every year too.
  Yeah.
  Assuming that there are any more.
 They just might have to get a lot more tortured.
 And we're okay with that.
  But I like that we've been doing these little Star Wars things.
 And I think it's perfect here today because it brought us to the.
.
.
  I think maybe one of the key pieces of Star Wars mythos, the 12 minute Donnie and Marie Star Wars sketch.
  Yes.
  We're so on topic.
  Right.
 This is one of the most famous ones.
 All seriousness, I feel like this deserves more attention versus the holiday special.
  Which definitely has the crown of Star Wars crap of this era.
  But this is a stalwart piece of Star Wars crap, certainly.
 And I was less so.
.
.
 I maybe had seen this once a long time ago.
  Yeah, but this is.
.
.
 I almost think maybe.
.
.
 There's an argument to be made that this is better Star Wars crap than the holiday special?  I think, well, there's.
.
.
 You know what? The brevity, I think, helps.
 I think that it packs it all in.
  It feels a little more on brand, oddly.
  Yes, it does.
  Despite not having the full actual cast.
 Only some of the actual cast.
  Some of the actual cast.
  Which is pretty impressive.
  This is Lucasfilm approved, I saw.
  Wow.
  And that's why they were able to get real R2-D2 and C-3PO in there.
 They don't look cheap.
  This is completely the suits, yes.
 For a show that you know would do crappy suits.
 Of course they would.
  But then you see real C-3PO and R2-D2 come out.
  Yes.
  You know, to that end, this happened before the holiday special.
 I think at least a year before.
 This is in the year of Star Wars.
  Right.
  Star Wars is at the top of the summer and this is at the end, September of 77.
 This is way before the Muppet Show with Mark Hamill.
  Which is probably the most legitimate end of Star Wars variety.
  Yes.
  Which is an area that if you can imagine we're all interested in.
  So it's a little low-key important, I think.
 I think I'm with you on your premise completely, Mike.
  Yeah, and it is also like I was just looking into it and like George Lucas, like it was a request perhaps.
  I can't tell if Donnie's making this up or not because Donnie talking about this because like Donnie hosted like a Force Awakens screening when it came back because he's such a big Star Wars fan and he feels like they're a part of it.
  Because they were one of the first big places to promote essentially Star Wars.
  He claims he was like asked by George Lucas to do it because they had a big like audience of kids.
  Oh.
  Yeah, that is true.
  That he was asked or they were kids.
  Well, no, that they had a very big like young audience.
 I read a thing about that Donnie Marie show of like when it was confirmed that Donnie was dating someone officially there was like a steep drop off.
  Oh, of course.
  Of young women watching.
  That's the famous thing where you pretend like when Homer becomes a star and the B-sharps and his manager tells him he has to pretend he's single because women want to have sex with you.
  We want them to think they can and he explains it to Marge and she's upset.
  Yeah.
  So, and yeah.
  Now I feel like now we I feel like the culture is different.
  Now I think we stan our relationships.
  Yeah.
  I think we we make our fan cams and we we celebrate and I mean me I make fan cams of all of my favorite celeb you couples.
  Uh huh.
  I made so many of Taylor Swift and that guy I need not say.
  I won't say his name anymore in fact being that he's out of the picture.
  You moved on to Chalamet and Kardashian though.
  That's your new fan.
  Is that one real?  Yes.
  What? Is it really?  A Kardashian.
 I forget which Kardashian.
  Could be any of them.
  Yeah.
  Okay.
 Well we need to figure out who it is because so Scott gets more invested.
  Is it Kim?  I don't know.
  I know the names of the Kardashians but I'm not sure which ones are dating who.
  Meanwhile who's next for Pete Davidson?  Marie Osmond?  This guy dates everybody in Hollywood and next Utah.
  Could be.
  Oh God.
  He's dating the big asteroid worm from Empire Strikes Back.
  Typical.
  We saw her at the Knicks game with him.
  Sorry it's Kylie Jenner and Timothée Chalamet.
  Okay.
  That's sure good.
  Alright.
  Well a scoop from our gossip correspondent.
  That's right.
  Cub reporter.
  Cub reporter specializing in gossip.
  I have on some like email spamming thing.
  I got signed up for the Elite Daily newsletter and it's terrible and I have not unsubscribed.
  Because I like seeing which of my zodiac symbols or which Coachella act or whatever.
  I think yeah.
  It seems like you love it.
  Seems like you love it.
  You keep giving us this Elite Daily scoop.
  Sure.
  You parlay this into an Elite Daily shop.
  Immediately sued by Elite Daily.
  But then offered $50 an article right.
  Something could go up to $52.
  So we're talking about this is potentially the first Star Wars sketch on television right?  Couldn't it be?  And an official one.
  I don't think Saturday Night Live had covered this.
  Saturday Night Live is very new at this point.
  This is probably the first thing ever with song and dance and accurate Star Wars costumes.
  Yeah.
  So yeah.
  Watching it now it's like we've seen this so many times but this was fresh and innovative.
  Yeah.
  I think that's probably what everyone watching Donnie and Marie every week was thinking.
  This show is fresh and innovative.
  Should we take a second and explain what I sent you guys a couple days ago about the show itself.
  Donnie and Marie.
  Yeah.
  I think on the Sid and Marty Croft Facebook they explain.
  Listeners you're probably checking this already.
  You're probably already on the Croft group.
  Well I of course follow Sid Croft on Instagram.
  He's like 92 or 93 years old and he does Instagram Lives and he did one with David Copperfield a few days ago.
  Insane.
  Blue 32 discussed between them?  Talked about Blue 32 a little bit.
  Wow.
  Sid loves Blue 32.
  He's going to go out there and see the show again.
  He was explaining it to David.
  David is kind of goofing on him the whole time a little bit which is kind of funny.
  Seems snarky.
  A little snarky to this guy but obviously David loves him because Sid has all the stories about opening up for Judy Garland and the old days and Judy saw me do my puppets and she loved it.
  We opened up at the Sands or whatever in Vegas and David loves those stories of course and then David showed off his puppet collection which is epic.
  That's the only way to say it.
  I know.
  I heard about that in Elite Daily.
  David Copperfield shows Sid Croft epic puppet collection and 100 people were watching this video by the way and I'm one of them.
  You are one of them.
  It does not at all look like Batman's Batcave of the stuff he's taken from all his adversaries.
  Yes it does look like.
  Oh yeah the last piece of information from that is that David explained that he just completed on one of his islands the Cave of Wishes.
  Whoa.
  And he doesn't get into what that means.
  He just explains that they have 11 islands and that you can go there and we're told of course one of them being Mushikei which we've talked about on the show before but that it is some sort of like attraction that you can experience on one of the 11 islands.
  He doesn't say which island it is but he says we know we've just completed the Cave of Wishes.
  I'm concerned about what some of Sid Croft's wishes might be.
  Is there a cap on the kinds of wishes that can be granted in this cave?  I don't know.
  Sid Croft's wishes might just be to have a TV show on the air again.
  Yeah.
  I'm not sure.
  And I'm concerned that.
  A puffin stuff, a girl one that I can kiss.
  Well yeah.
  I'm concerned that you are going to try to figure out how to get into David Copperfield's Cave of Wishes.
  You should be concerned.
  So anyway if you don't know we've talked about Sid and Marty Croft made a bunch of shows, Brady Bunch Variety Hour, they produced HR Puffin Stuff, all these I would say visually interesting kids shows.
  I would say scary.
  I would say most terrifying acid trips of 70s kids television but then also you kind of forget dominated this cheesy 70s variety genre.
  In prime time.
  As well.
  Brady Bunch Variety Hour ultimately Pink Lady and Jeff.
  I forgot they were also Pink Lady and Jeff.
  One of the most notorious flops in TV history.
  Horrible show.
  But the beginning of it, this was before there would be no Brady Bunch Variety Hour without this.
  David also brought up the theme park, the Sid and Marty Croft theme park as well.
  He's like you know it's CNN now and I see the escalator is still there.
  And he's like oh yes I went there once on a tour and they exaggerate.
  They talk about the park on the tour but they exaggerate some of it.
  David goes what are you talking about, what do you mean exaggerate and he goes I don't remember.
  And that was the exchange.
  Fascinating.
  Don't just put this on Instagram.
  Get this in a more public forum.
  That's right.
  So anyway Sid and Marty Croft both still alive.
  Both still yeah.
  They both are.
  Both of them still alive.
  Wow.
  So yeah they posted this about Donnie Marie.
  In 1975 ABC executives Michael Eisner and Fred Silverman approached us about making a Friday night prime time show.
  They told us they had two very talented kids and that they wanted to work with but didn't have any idea what to do with them.
  So we went off and developed a show concept consisting of ice skaters, musical numbers, comedy skits,  celebrity guests and occasional musical adaptations of famous films such as Star Wars.
  This concept would eventually become the Donnie and Marie show.
  So our guy Michael Eisner yet again appears.
  It's crazy when we're not even looking for him.
  We're not looking for him.
  Just something is strange on television or we see a clip of it way later.
  Boy we got to talk about this and somehow he ends up being involved.
  Yes.
  Here's two things I want to say and they're two shots called and I know what the year is almost over essentially.
  You're half over.
  I think shots calling is permanent.
  Shots call is permanent.
  It could be for next year.
  I could call a shot for next year.
  You know how in May you're saying the year's pretty much over.
  That comment and that comment turn a phrase.
  That's true.
  Basically Christmas.
  Two shots called.
  Let me see what's more exciting to call.
  I have a guess that one of these I'm not going to like.
  There's one that you're going to be upset about.
  And I'm going to guess that excitement for both of them is not the first word that comes to anyone's mind.
  For us one of them is exciting and for the other one I think Scott's going to be like he's going to roll his eyes.
  And I think maybe we said this already years ago when we did the Sid and Marty Croft episode.
  I'll start with the one that we're going to agree on I think.
  Main feed Michael Eisner episode.
  Yeah.
  Just we got to have to find a way to present it where nobody thinks that it's the interview because I don't want to see a wave of people going oh I know it's not.
  We're going to put in the title not an interview with him.
  I'll reveal to you I sent another email to try to get him at our live show and it did not get no one responded.
  The one that's coming up.
  Yeah.
  This week as people are hearing this.
  I just sent a cold email again being like hey we're doing a live show.
  Well wait.
  All right.
  Spoiler audience.
  Not Michael Eisner.
  Wait you sent it really?  Yeah.
  And just said like will you come be in it?  Well I did a whole I explained you know we were the guys that hello.
  It's our account that has the hello because that's what got a response one time when we got the no to be on the show.
  And then I said you know I think I made a big I made it like an emotional plea essentially like I think Michael doesn't understand that the love that Disney fans have for him the nostalgia.
  And I think we think it would be really fun for him to experience that live because he doesn't get to do that.
  And we want to I didn't say well throw the softest ball questions at him.
  But essentially I did.
  So I made a little plea there and I was like you know it's a cool place.
  I said like it's a cool place too.
  Oh that'll help.
  Yeah.
  Would you like to leave the biggest compound in the history of Malibu and head down to MacArthur Park.
  That's right.
  We'll hey we'll get somebody to park the car for you.
  Yeah.
  We'll get a buddy.
  You don't even have to worry about that.
  Well Jason will park Michael Eisner's car for him.
  There is a garage right around the corner and it has the most unhinged handwritten how to pay for parking sign you've ever seen.
  See that Michael.
  You gotta see it.
  So I'll keep sending emails periodically just you know what.
  That's how this happens.
  You know you got to be a tenacious.
  Jason knows he's a cub reporter.
  You gotta be tenacious sometimes.
  Those who dare when you know.
  So send it.
  Sometimes.
  So yes you're right.
  We have to make sure people know this is not an interview with the man.
  This is just we're looking through the whole career.
  Yeah.
  Well if you know and if we do that we can talk about because I was curious if there was any mention of Donnie and Marie in his book work in progress and there is not.
  But he does refer to the first thing he ever produced for ABC as an ABC executive which was that he got he flew to Pebble Beach and got Bing Crosby to serve as the host of a special edition of the ABC.
  The host of a special about Marine World and then all right what do we need now I need the hottest musical sensation of right now the young rascals and their song Groovin and the special is called feeling groovy at Marine World.
  Wow.
  First thing Michael Eisner ever produced for television was a theme park special.
  Yeah.
  He like settled in this genre.
  That's where he started.
  Marine.
  It had a water skiing elephant in it.
  It's not on YouTube though so if anybody can find some odd way to I would love to review feeling groovy.
  We're all going to have to we're going to have to have to head to the Paley Center and like we're going to go through the archives.
  Yeah.
  Be handed the dustiest VHS or beta tape you've ever seen.
  That's a three hour episode I think.
  That's gotta be.
  Yeah.
  I think Marine World is kind of like the Van Nuys bush gardens or two lesser extent.
  What is it?  Geauga Lake Geauga Lake where it's just like gone totally gone.
  Why does face the earth at this point.
  But you know there's people out there it's like that was their Disneyland and now it just belongs to the dustbin of history is Marine World.
  There's one there's a place called Marine World Africa USA that is up north that I would love to cover because the name is so insane.
  But then is this me in the Marine World in is this the one that's like now Trump is a Tory Orange County.
  Yeah or not even there like Rancho Palos Verdes kind of oh I don't I don't actually know I think or it's near like where Trump owns a bunch of golf land.
  Yeah I think it's one of it's just one of those things where it's like it's very recent history but we I don't know like it's like how there used to be a much more elaborate pier theme park in Santa Monica.
  Oh both.
  I think both.
  Yeah.
  The also Marine World has this there's some like there's some special where the Munsters visit to know we got we got Marine World we got separately feeling groovy of Marine World separately Michael Eisner and separately your other idea.
  Do you have a guess what it is.
  No.
  No I'm worried.
  What is it.
  It's a Sid and Marty Croft thing.
  In 1962 they were asked by Six Flags to become the creative heads of the amusement park.
  I don't know if we've gone over this before.
  No.
  And what this meant.
  Six Flags was around then.
  Yes.
  This was shocking to me so I was like Six Flags okay we got to do it.
  But what that really meant is moving in their adult puppet show Les Poupées de Paris the first adults only puppet show featuring naked marionettes.
  Oh no.
  Yeah.
  This is why I'm worried about them in the cave.
  You should be worried because there's naked marionettes in this and this is what they were doing before.
  So this was at many Six Flags across the country this show this naked marionette puppet show.
  In the 60s.
  That's what this says.
  So we got we have to do it.
  It's like hair.
  We have to do Les Poupées de Paris.
  This was the counterculture and Sid and Marty Croft and their naked puppets were at the forefront.
  Right.
  So we got to do it.
  Anytime I hear like adult puppet show look it's very talented puppeteers out there it's very specific field.
  But I can't help but thinking about being John Malkovich.
  Like John Cusacks like stressed kind of sad puppeteer character.
  Sure.
  Well there's a lot of adult puppet shows I feel like now.
  So maybe you just need to get more acquainted with Terry Fader Jeff Dunham and other other.
  Well see we got into this and our text with Eva those are ventriloquists.
  Oh yeah.
  You're right.
  I think puppetry and ventriloquism are different.
  So like Puppet Up which is the Henson dirty puppet show at Knotts.
  That's puppets.
  That is puppets.
  Yeah.
  Yeah.
  So I think the other voices they're hidden.
  They're hidden.
  Also it's got puppet in the name so I think you got to give it the benefit of the doubt.
  Right.
  And is puppetry of the penis puppets.
  It's about to say no.
  That is puppetry of the penis.
  It's just using a penis as a puppet.
  It's putting the penis into different shapes.
  Yes.
  OK.
  So we will do puppetry of the penis too on the second gate.
  I'm calling that shot and we will.
  Yeah.
  I mean we'll do it.
  Sure.
  With our penises.
  It's going to be a weird one to listen to but we will try our best to describe all of  the different myriad of shapes that we can tort our penis and testicles into.
  Well it's theater of the mind.
  Theater of the mind.
  As they call it.
  So yeah that makes sense.
  So yeah anyway that's up top here just because of.
  Six Flags Dirty Puppet Show.
  Yeah and looking into Donnie and Marie in general.
  Eisner comes up.
  Siddharth and Marty Croft in their dirty puppet show at Six Flags comes up and we got to do  it.
  Well this this might explain why they were maybe on some level at odds with this production  because it's funny that they got their start with these naked puppets seemingly.
  Yeah.
  But then here they are producing I feel like the epitome of squeaky clean just like the  most if you were to use a negative word maybe toothless.
  Oh kind of you know just like the most like the blandest entertainment I feel like is  the Stoney, Marisha and the Osmonds in general.
  Yeah.
  Who related also really I like I didn't realize got their start in general at Disneyland.
  They're just they're brothers in the park harmonizing with the dapper Dan's.
  Right.
  Unpaid just for fun I guess.
  And somebody a Disney entertainment person saw them.
  Who are these wholesome fellas?  I think no Donnie at that point.
  I think that I think I saw the older brothers.
  This is exactly the Jackson five scenario.
  Right.
  In the younger one younger ones I guess both really shoot past the right main older brother  lineup.
  But the Jackson's end up like on the full version of the show where we were with the  Star Wars.
  There's a full like hour long.
  Yeah.
  And then it's yeah I watched two and there's 12 minutes or so of the Star Wars but they  do bring on the Osmonds sort of as an afterthought the other older brothers and I will say I  don't know the names of the Osmonds like I know the names of the Jackson's.
  I don't I some of them kind of little ugly.
  Wow.
  What a take.
  I just I just yeah the toothless most boring guys doing a disco number and it's just like.
  And they're not lookers either.
  I don't know because Donnie well that I'm I'm not saying that so much for me so much as  Donnie and Marie always had fan base of like oh they're lookers you know.
  You're saying compared to their brother and sister.
  Famous.
  Yeah.
  Yeah.
  I mean it makes it look there was an era in entertainment where our singers were all  like 50 year old just right kind of unremarkable looking men.
  Sure.
  And I think the Osmonds were I actually I cannot picture these Osmonds you're talking  about I mercifully did not watch the entire hour but I that just might be the case.
  I like that they're just kind of I could see they're just they're just guys.
  I'm a man.
  It is very much like that especially when it's like Donnie and Marie and a younger young  Chris Christopherson a young compared to now.
  I don't know that he was ever looked young but he was kind of handsome and had a big  hair and a big beard and stuff.
  You know these four brothers.
  He does.
  For sex appeal.
  He does a scan like kind of like a bit with Marie where they're like asking each other  for autographs and then they do a song and it's a little it's a little like you know  their foreheads are leaning on against each other which is very funny because they had  just cut to Chris Christopherson's wife and daughter in the audience.
  Oh no.
  Your family is what I certainly hope this is just for entertainment.
  I don't get any.
  Marie is very young here too.
  I believe he was around when it started.
  I saw he was 18.
  She was 16.
  Yeah.
  Yeah.
  Chris Christopherson.
  Yes.
  They said been going for a little while.
  I think by the time they did the Star Wars one.
  Yeah.
  But early 75 or 76.
  I don't believe had moved to Utah yet because at some point the Osmond machine took over  production and moved it to their facilities in Utah.
  Yes.
  Kind of fascinating.
  They were just they were on the KTLA lot.
  Yeah.
  Here in L.
A.
 and which I believe is where the Brady Bunch show is also filmed.
  And then I feel like it was maybe a twofold decision.
  One was just to be closer to the church and so that the church could like because they're  the big Mormon family.
  And so like if right if we do this in Utah then the church can be closer and make sure  that they approve of any foreheads that are touching and suggestively during a song.
  But also might have been to get rid of those crops.
  I think the crops don't make the move.
  And that was a way to like well this is done now by Osmond Enterprises.
  Who would want to get away from these two guys?  What could possibly make you not want to.
  I mean let's say you know in theory you were a person who's been on this podcast who has  interacted with the crops.
  What would make them want to not be around the crops as much as possible.
  Hypotheticals again.
  To me it's all hanging out with the crops is like going to Lidsville.
  The famous Lidsville show they did with Charles Nelson Riley where Butch Patrick went to do  a giant hat and went into a magical land where hats talked.
  You know that's what I picture it being like kind of a fun party where everybody hangs out.
  You want to come to our house and then you go in there and the window talks to you and  the church talks to you and like would you like a drink and then the drink talks to you.
  Who wouldn't want to hang out with these guys.
  Right.
  Perfect time for all.
  And then like all right so now that we're all here the talking chair and beer there's a lot of nude  puppets in the basement.
  You want to see our nude puppets?  You want to go to the basement and see our nude puppets?  Don't go in the guest room.
  Paul Lind is in there.
  He's still paying off his ABC contract.
  So.
  Well now I'm going.
  Paul Lind is alive.
  It will go anywhere.
  Paul Lind is.
  My guy.
  That is I saw the reason why Paul Lind was like a regular on this show was because he still had time left or hours left on his ABC contract.
  Paul has a sad story which bumps me out.
  But here sometimes you watch Paul performing and you can kind of see him not want to be performing and I feel like that's what is the case on the Donnie and Marie Star Wars sketch.
  Like he doesn't really have it in here.
  There's a little bit.
  Well just like the fire might be out.
  He's still great.
  He still does his job but he seems a little tired.
  Yeah.
  And maybe the spark is kind of gone.
  Scott he gets to do a little more in an earlier sketch in the episode where he is working at the Hollywood unemployment office and Farrah Fawcett comes in.
  Marie playing Farrah Fawcett.
  Yes.
  Oh OK not Farrah Fawcett.
  And the game is she is an airhead.
  Oh boy.
  Yes.
  That's kind of it right.
  That's the whole thing.
  There's a line in this.
  Yes.
  This dumb airhead.
  They kind of there's a Red Fox sketch earlier too about playing pool.
  And this had to you got to you probably fell out of your chair because there's a couple of Music Man references in this.
  Yeah.
  Yeah.
  There's a river.
  She goes something about River City and playing pool as if it's the got trouble song.
  Which is I believe incorrect.
  I think they were playing a different kind of pool.
  They might have been playing snooker in Music Man.
  Oh OK.
  Different different thing.
  Real quick just to set up all the players involved here.
  One another one of our guys is involved and we're talking of course about the Lanch.
  Yep.
  Yep.
  When it gets to those credits I was immediately like all right what writers we got here.
  Yep.
  Who's writing for the court knowing what was around the corner.
  There's so many podcasts the ride guys involved here and yeah of course it's the Lanch.
  Yeah.
  It's always Bruce the Lanch.
  Yeah.
  If you have a question about a hokey piece of sing and dance and comedy.
  Yes.
  Writer of course of the full Star Wars holiday special and then he seemingly cut his teeth  writing for this.
  Yeah.
  He spoke of the Utah move and how it really defanged the show and the show got much worse.
  And I believe this this sequence is right before the Utah move.
  Uh huh.
  It's a little bit.
  It's maybe the premiere of season three but it was a little bit into season three that  they make the move so that they can run every sketch passed them because the Mormons were  so invested in the Osmonds as like there these are the main ambassadors to America of the  church.
  So they would you know they'd like cancel songs that Bruce talks about that how there  was some like could have been a hit song presented for Marie and then they're like no this is  about a divorce.
  No.
  Why?  What do you mean?  How?  And then he pitches why doesn't she do don't let the sun go down on me and then delights  in the fact that he instead got Marie Osmond to sing a song with the type with the words  go down on me.
  Right.
  Bruce yes.
  Bruce got his wins.
  Yeah.
  Yeah.
  Subversive.
  Yeah.
  He did his little twists and turns.
  But yes he's he's here too.
  He's here too.
  Paul Linde is here too.
  This is really the fact that I didn't watch the entire thing.
  This might speak to that compared to you guys my Paul Linde tolerance might be somewhat  lower.
  Really?  You're not a Paul guy.
  I cannot say that I am a Paul Linde guy.
  Did you like Uncle Arthur on Bewitched?  Did you watch Bewitched?  I cannot tell you that I have strong vibrant memories of this is one I know I'm disappointing  you might.
  Herman Munster's doctor on the Munsters?  I didn't know he was Herman Munster's doctor.
  Yes he was.
  He gets to see very well.
  How about Bye Bye Birdie when he's singing about kids today?  Oh he's kids.
  He's heads.
  Okay.
  Yeah.
  He was on Broadway too.
  That's a good song.
  Yeah and he gets to sing here as well.
  I am not the Paul Linde expert that Mike is but I could tell that there were some moments  in this some segments in this that were a thing I like from old TV shows people kind  of barely getting the lines laughing through sketches.
  Which is funny because I love that.
  I love like Bob Newhart and Dean Martin doing that or Red Fox popping into the Osmond show  but like in modern sketch comedy I hate people breaking or getting stuff fucked up.
  But I love it.
  You and Lauren have a lot in common.
  Me and Lauren.
  Yeah.
  Okay let's get do by the when you get the draft on you don't start improvising you got  I think Marie at some point they're doing this pool sketch.
  Have you given that lesson to you?  You were doing a little like that's that's the thing that that's the thing that personally  bothers me.
  Red Fox and Marie just says during one of the she's like oh that was my line.
  Yes during one of they just let's in there.
  Well this is one of that like I'm always curious because I okay this is something I think about  the hokey end of Disney variety specials especially because like all the Disney world specials  and anything that Disney's producing in the 70s and early 80s are like Donnie and Marie.
  It is still like this thing as like it's the ice angels and then it's always like whatever  we can think of to have like a hundred people in red white blue uniforms and like big puffy  skirts and like I'm always watching stuff like this and thinking this is the late 70s  early 80s is when like all my favorite music comes from this is like such a countercultural  time punk is happening and then yeah this and I was like September 77 when this is  ever 23rd 77 when this airs like what else is going on the next day the very next night  after this airs is the season three premiere of Saturday Night Live like the much cooler  end of like the show that is blowing up this kind of thing Steve Martin hosts musical guest  Jackson Brown first appearance of wild and crazy guys like the molten core of when SNL  was cool and countercultural is happening literally a day after like hey Princess Leia  we gotta go back gotta get you back on the jet plane and then and then the other pop  cultural like contrast that I like a lot the literal day the day that this airs is  the day of the release of Steely Dan's Asia possibly my favorite album in the world a  timeless piece of music to me I feel at least one of my top ten for sure like you could for  the first time hear Deacon Blues this this day yeah and then go home and watch this some a song  where they go chew baka baka baka yeah I've said this on the Oscar like there's this 70s 80s period  were of like changing tastes where there was still old stuff happening simultaneously like  on TV is fascinating because like Liberace being on the Oscars in the 80s feels weird to me yeah  but isn't it like wait no that was earlier 80s I was like is he singing songs about Oliver Stone  movies not quite that but fire and on Golden Pond yeah the movies are a little more like those  fitted but this is post like Scorsese like movies have gotten prettier and crazier with that so  Liberace this is what this is the culture they were countered to yeah yeah yeah and you forget  these things were like right next door to each other around yeah and and by the way anybody any  Steely Dan fam listening this that what I just said is not the only crossover between Donnie  and Marie and the Dan check this out  like I bought that Warren and the brightest orange laser suits you can imagine  and then I'm just gonna leave it playing through the introduction of the guests  did  did Donald Fagan feel like throwing himself off a balcony when he saw it if he saw this or was  he just happy to get a check yeah it depends on how many zeros were at the end of that check  yes I bet they found a way to make it not very many that is true yeah I don't look I have no  room to talk on this we just watched a movie called the Siegfeld Follies this is not a movie  about the Siegfeld Follies this was made in 1945 and it's all the MGM contract stars making a  movie in the style of Siegfeld Follies so unconnected sketches and elaborates musical  presented a premise as if I understand what Siegfeld Follies is you got to go all the way  back to the early 1900s and they were the first Broadway shows okay and got to go back you've  got to go back all right I will this is like showgirl Lucy Lucy is in this and so is William  Frawley doing a sketch with Fanny Brice who I didn't know was still alive sign me up Fanny  Brice and Hume Cronin my man sign me up Hume Cronin I'm the fucking there you're there more  of Mike's guy Lucy does show up in this clip at the end if you know what I'm talking about  so yes so so they do a full show it sets up this 12-minute show stopping number at the end the  first Star Wars parody of all time yeah just four months after the release of New Hope yes still  fresh in people's minds and they do and and speaking of I guess the right guys they do the  of course famous opening crawl there's some jokes in there about the Empire like being a threat to  cleanliness thrift and good dental hygiene and there's a little polite way patriotism patriotism  real beliefs right you get patriotism's now the person who does this crawl narration also does  Darth Vader's voice not James Earl Jones it's one of the Scott's specifically even guys thorough  Ravens are all Ravens I was delighted I by the time we made it to this and like well we got an  episode here right yet another incredible iteration of my favorite voice of all time the most insane  engaging deep voice open the fantasy the way he's been he's in this and he gets to be Darth Vader  yeah it makes all the sense in the world the tiger is Darth Vader yeah yeah right and he does a good  job like a first animal like is that that's not him no yeah it's a bit of a it's a softer Vader yes  you know I'm the power of my force you could tell he doesn't have that I'm not sure that he saw  Star Wars I think I like about anything like this we're like you can tell people are some people  involved are getting caught up really quick with like yeah it's kind of no it's like a it's a Buck  Rogers flash Gordon and this guy's like a pilot and this guy's rad and so so what they would they  would say my force so definitely yeah everybody would for sure like well not if I can get you first  with my force perfect yes you sound like Lucas you could have ridden the thing yeah Vader at the end  of the sketch kind of does like a poochie like I have to go now my planet needs like he kind of  kind of gets just walks off he got just leaves the whole thing doesn't make too much sense no it  doesn't it is an original Star Wars story before Mandalorian this is a for TV only right really the  first non cinematic Star Wars story so slow so let's let's set the story right so Donnie and  Marie come out and they are dressed they are they are Luke and Leia and again well after some footage  of just kind of realistic clinical solar flare yes and there's gonna be more realistic footage to  come as well that don't blend that does not blend in well for the universe of Star Wars but  they come on this is just gonna give you a vibe of like what we're talking about entertainment wise  so there you go that's that's the vibe of this this whole yeah Darth is gonna get us watch out  for Darth again one of those my foot the Darth and his force lost in space all the Star Wars  characters always saying they're lost in space that other reference we know we gotta go on a  Star Trek to prevent more Star Wars a vague understanding of what the movie is about is  really really good I wonder if Bruce had seen them Bruce maybe it's in the movie maybe he's  the expert I imagine that in this writers room he's the youngest gun that's probably right that's  probably right oh sure you're one of their kids how many of the rowdy of the writers coughed to  death during the production of this number Pauline kind of had the vibe right for an imperial officer  for a second he had the hands behind that he was looking stern he had his hands behind his back  yeah I think he could have been in the movies I actually think you are right that he could have  played an imperial officer yeah why not he looks like the one that gets choked out by  Vader for sure the officer yeah yeah but yeah yeah so so that happens they come on this is  insane but I'm letting it pass but you just you two just both said yes Pauline could have been in  Star Wars moving on bigger career he got pigeonholed is the guy who like shakes his waggles his head and  I think he got stuck doing that but he wasn't you where's the proof that he's has other moves in my  heart the proof is in I be at our movies he's done it in Star Wars it's not fair even get he was  typecast I'm saying more that a lot of those imperial officers are choked out after two or  three lines and just kind of come on and say something sort of dry or sort of stern besides  grandma Tarkin wait I get choked out in this while I'm in sign me up my safe word is force  so so yeah so they come on they do Barry Manilow song writers to the stars I like I like that song  actually yeah not this version necessarily yeah but a lot of the songs are just they do in the  shower just the songs this has at least a few words changed yeah to be Star Wars with some of  it it's just like there's doing this song well cuz later stormtroopers come out dancing which I  loved I love the dancing yeah sure I mean they're and then they get ready they do the song the  temptation song get ready yes so they come out and this is also the precursor people try to  claim online that this is this gave Lucas the idea to make Luke and Leia brother and sister  eventually in the third movie because of course Luke and Leia in the first movie like Leia kisses  Luke or no that she kisses him in the second and Empire Strikes Back but it seemed like they were  at Dustin for some sort of romance in the first movie maybe mm-hmm but George denies this George  denies that the Donnie Murray special gave him the idea to make Luke and Leia brother and sister  wonder if any variety shows impacted how they handled the the Disney ones where there's like  seeds of romance here and there between different characters and then in the end they are confused  and don't know what the fuck to do about any of it I wonder how that make a bad idea that's a good  point I see a little bit of a spark here well actually shit run I don't know Chewie's dead  no he's not they should there any variety shows where they just came out and announced things  that could happen and then none of them did happen it's the episode 9 was inspired by like  a music festival where the stage collapsed yeah hey that's great in the weirdest places I like  when in night in 1977 the real suits of C3PO and R2D2 walk out to no applause no applause no  should we anyone excited about this now what are they what are these tin cans red Fox also  when he appears doesn't really get an applause break I guess cuz he was in a sketch earlier  but also I did read that Donnie and Marie a lot of those musical numbers are lip-synced live well  that's this there's an odd thing where it's like I can't tell if it's all being done live  because some like Anthony Daniels is doing C3PO he seems like they almost like dubbed his lines  in yeah there's a weird quality of quality to it and the same thing with red Fox red Fox is and  like what's the do you catch what is fake Obi-Wan Kenobi name that's impossible trying to find what  was or trying to hear it and it's really hard it's muffled it's either okie-pinnockie or something  like that okie-finnockie which is a real place or river maybe it's that yeah but he appears sort  of is just an image above them he's not actually live on stage and that feels completely disjointed  disconnected from what they're doing well in that in the real and in the years moment I just played  when Donnie says hi welcome to our show that's lip-synced the dialogue is so they might be like  a Disney ride pre-show ride video where they just would always screw up the audio and they'd have  to go in and dub it oh sure that red Fox does get a laugh for the line this year Sanford he says  he's from the planet Sanford but he says this year Sanford has no son yes well you left out  the part where there's like four lines between those things and it's the longest walk I know  you're going you said Sanford where to say son say son say son and he said well then moons it no  come on get to it say son yeah I don't know if this was a valanche maybe this is an early  valanche he hadn't figured out how to cut two of the sentences before he got to the punchline  maybe yeah he's just learning the rhythm at this point because he's so he's young here he will by  the time Crystal steps up to the Oscar stage Bruce will get there much like a young Luke looking at  the suns and dreaming of his fate that was Bruce valanche picturing the Oscar do do do do do do do  we sing Billy Crystal's head just feel it to Billy Crystal heads this one is this show is like  Bruce valanche is running through the swamps of Dagobah and he's flipping over stuff oh yeah the  Yoda and his backpack is just like a distant Osmond like uncle or father going like I don't  think we should do that the church won't like it do we really want to have Suzanne Summers on  her mere appearance is scandalous yes I'm Tago bond you're just telling him he's not ready yet  to go right for the Oscars jokes are not ready not prepared you are double entendre is offensive  but Billy needs me he's out there I know he is the his his moment of getting electrified by the  Emperor you know and saying father father help me is when the David Letterman Uma Oprah moment  does land which I think I don't know I think that word plan that makes sense they're both  famous people everyone knew that was called out as anything we have all watched just he just  garbage piles of worse comedy than Uma Oprah since it happened yes insane that people were  mad about yes I'm not saying that moment is elevated we've yes we've consumed so much  worse since like I'm begging for Uma Oprah yeah I also feel like Letterman himself has made that  whole thing like he's he's kind of cast a shadow on it because he also yeah somebody he or somebody  else who were like he got asked back to hosts and he's the one who wants to push the narrative  that he did such a bad job and everyone hated him and then he didn't go back blah blah blah so  I think part of it is also him bragging rights yeah and make yeah he seems cooler than it so  yeah you got Chris Christopherson is Han Solo who I don't know he's not I'm not thrilled with him  his performance here yeah I guess yeah but then now this this is one though not that he's good in  this but like this one this is one where I'm like I feel like there's a world where Chris Christopherson  was Han Solo just in terms of like he's cool yeah yeah just like his prominence I shouldn't  say not throw them he just doesn't have anything that fun to do yeah he doesn't really do anything  but like in a long shot you put him in the Han Solo shirt and vest he's a cool-looking guy like  Chris lean against that doorframe yeah that works that's enough that communicates the idea cool guy  yeah does he do he does a song right yes and I can't I don't know the name of it I found the  names of all the songs well doesn't he do here let me just let me fish around I might not be there  exactly Chewbacca is with him now oh okay yeah yeah yeah yeah I have that ring done and this oh  here's the part that's it they don't say boom shakalaka they say chewbacca so that's one of  the changes you didn't you didn't have the most important piece of that where r2d2 realizes he  can't get up the ramp and so just goes off camera and then they they come back anyway a moment later  because there's a joke about like this is the same planet it's like yeah but the landing was  perfect yeah what is he don't know yeah they say bye and wave and then each day they leave him there  yeah they leave us random on this island which is mainly made up of sparkly stairs yeah say island  or planet planet planet yeah Peter Mayhew is in the Chewbacca outfit Peter Mayhew was there doing  this playing Chewbacca crazy and so also again what you're this this is the first that Anthony  Daniels and Peter Mayhew played the characters again after the movie right unless there's  something I don't know about but this is but before Empire Strikes Back yeah this is the real  sequel to Star Wars Anthony Daniels in his book finally remembers his appearance on the show except  that he thought the lines he was given to say his C3PO were so dreadful that he decided to cut most  of them from the script so he refused to say some of the lines I guess that's what he's claiming  here and then they get they get that back and like oh so mr.
 robot man doesn't like guard jokes  well let's see where this flash in the pan goes we're gonna prey on that for sure I mean what could  he see he's a sinner in the Lord's eyes for impersonating a human shape and C3PO is an  abomination shall not be in the likeness a robot shall not be in the likeness of a man no art those  are 2d2 he's fine they were disgusted they saw him drinking a cup of hot tea what would be a  valanche joke for the road like a danger Will Robinson or something like what would be the  valanche loose robot joke in 1977 I mean danger Will Robinson is the only robot that was famous  up until then right yeah I don't know like you deserve a gold medal for that landing um please  don't melt me into the gold but that's pretty good Bruce is throwing that one out yeah all right  next let me talk about the Paul in number real quick here Jason did you recognize this song that  Paul sings a few a few of them I did not or I could not place that's okay I just it's a it's  from on a clear day it's from the musical and it's called I don't know the musical okay it's  a song called come back to me I didn't know it either I had to search the lyrics to find it and  they cut to Paul and and he's in I guess a control tower of some kind he's wearing an  Imperial officer outfit he's got the ice princesses walking around in like vague stormtrooper looking  outfits and he's just looking at the like looking at the screen and it's just a picture of a real  like rocket a modern-day rocket old grainy footage yeah and he sings this song  yeah  don't want your notes  of course, what a force can you be?  come back to me  come back to me  come back to me  he seems crazy in this so I this is what j i like if you just dial it a little bit in one way  I feel like he does seem like an unhinged imperial officer  which yes, yeah, so  He could be a first order.
 He could be yeah, he could be any any of these characters.
 I feel like  Uh with the right direction an irving kirchner  You know has the delicate hand to take paul linds performance and make it fit into the universe  Now you picked him and not george.
 Are you saying george is unable to direct actors? We know that  Are there moments like with I don't know, uh, hayden christensen where you feel like maybe you didn't know the right thing to say faster more intense  faster more intense  I think that's george's famous direction really let them know that you don't like sand  Yeah, just make sure you communicate that you don't like them.
 Great job paul.
 Great job paul faster more intense  Uh, so I guess paul is watching as an imperial officer.
 This is supposed to be the heroes in that rocket  And that's the best they could do it took me a couple watches to figure that out  That I believe he's watching.
 Yeah, this is just occurring to me as you're saying.
 Yeah, he's watching  han luke or in leia in in chewy in the rocket  That the spaceship they just got into it took me forever to figure that out  I go  Why is he watching? Why does he want him to come back and come back to me doesn't really make sense  But I guess the idea is oh they've gotten away from imperial officer paul linds.
 Yeah, that's the idea there  This is all very thin soup the mechanics of this.
 I completely agree  But paul lind gets to sing a song from a musical and he really he really does belt it out  Yeah, uh there  and then yeah, and then he's just sort of  Uh with a bunch of the ice princesses who have like helmets and ski goggles on I love these costumes are great  These like more shapely  Female designed stormtrooper.
 These are good.
 This is this is an innovative part of the shapelier stormtroopers  Yes  The lady stormtroopers have almost like a heart on their  Chest kind of  Uh, I don't know if that's what it is.
 I don't think it looks like almost like an upside down star trek symbol  Um, they have shoulder pads their wardrobe these these utah osmond oriented  Hired costume designers.
 They're sad.
 I think they figured it out.
 Yeah, and they're sassier stormtroopers  Um, and then paul and is very upset  Um and darth vader comes in  And yells, I guess we could play a little bit of this.
 Let's let's hear  thurl's darth  Just a little  No planet all no planet all no planet all it is I darth I'm just going to use some of my force  I like this guy.
 He's a little I don't know.
 He's he's sillier.
 He's cookier  That no planet all on that's a very like  Jokey delivery no planet all no planet all no planet all  Oh  This guy they're the best I also I learned a thing about him.
 I didn't know also that he was the  Uh for decades.
 He was the voice of this thing called the pageant of the masters, which is in laguna beach  they have it every summer and  It is a laguna beach in orange county where disneyland is um, and you might know from arrested development  There's this there's this thing it's in an episode of the show where people get together and  Recreate paintings.
 Oh, yeah using sets and makeup and costume  And that is a real thing that happens in this outdoor amphitheater in orange county and apparently for many decades  The live narrator of it was thurl ray of its trust  Um, and I got interested in this thing because the venue where they have that is where erin and I got married  Oh really?  Holy shit in the grounds of not in the it was not an amphitheater and we did not invite you didn't  3000 people but and you didn't recreate a painting for your wedding? Um,  Just a general tableau of what a wedding would be like, but no no specific wedding from art history  No, like dower photo where you guys are recreating american pastoral like you didn't have a buddy  It's like all right.
 He's got the ring and you've got the pitchfork.
 Do not forget that pitchfork  No, no photo reference  Uh, um, oh the only thing well right after we got married though.
 I did have every there was an announcement made by the dj of  um  Uh, all right.
 Anyone who is at this wedding who was in the video sex offender shuffle, please proceed to the wedding area  because  Uh an old video of mine if you don't know that one, uh, everyone who's in the video was at my weddings  We were able to do a full cast photo.
 So there was that there was somebody had the phone out like, okay, wait  I was over here.
 I was looking mad.
 Okay, I was being creepy in the  Um, so the the grand cast reunion happened a lot of minutes after here at this place no history  Yes, some involving thorough ravens croft and some not american goth  I was just about to get on your ass  I was done talking and I apologize.
 It looks very pastoral and that's why I got that's true  I didn't want our listeners furious for jason all the raw  All the filip roth heads going like why is he bringing up american pastoral  He was thinking about a book because jason's the reader of the good jason reese the book guy  He subtly tells us  On me limp mic stand, I know the feeling  Leave it in  His line at one point that I liked was I didn't expect a standing ovation, but what's so funny?  Because they all kind of laugh  At one point all the uh ice angels.
 Okay.
 Yeah, right  Um, so yeah at this point, I mean the narrative is now they've been caught I believe  Or they're about to be caught I guess well  They leave the planet and then just come back to the same planet, right?  And they don't change anything about the back so it's not like they went somewhere else  Um, they come back to the planet  And then this is when the sort of more traditional storm troopers  Swarmed the stage in addition to the ice princess.
 Yes, this I have this moment  You're right side  I do really like the like west side story kind of like group snapping.
 Yes of the storm troopers  This might be the highlight number.
 I think so.
 Yeah that first shot  That's kind of like low angled and then they start bouncing I was like, okay, I like that and then when they get to the chorus  It's just like oh, yeah, I just like this song.
 This is fun now  Because everyone's menacing  Uh, you know the osmonds and chris christofferson and chewy but no one has any weapons  They're menacing them by like one two three one two three like bouncing towards them.
 Yes dance intimidation  Yes, there's no blast I don't think yeah, does anybody have a blaster no one has a blaster  No, so lucas did not let them borrow the blasters for this  For some reason I don't know but he did but there were this it is real costumes.
 Yeah  They arranged chubaca that's too close.
 Like there's no way  Whatever prop department could put together these yeah, it's the real chubaca real darth vader real storm troopers  It looks like yes some of them they get this so right and then the set's so wrong  Just this this sparkly pink world.
 I mean, I like the sets, but it's just not star wars.
 Yeah, it's they  I'll say this  They tease an episode that I did watch and I'll just say it now they do a wizard of oz  12 minute  Show-stopping finale on their next episode that involves lucille ball  And that one feels much more like they put time into it than this one.
 Yes, they know what it is  Yeah, do they say lucille ball?  No, I can tell you the whole thing.
 No, not ruth buzzy.
 It's it's uh, uh ray bulger  Actual cast member playing the scarecrow yet again, except if he looked wrong and bad.
 That's right  It's lucille ball as the tin woodsman.
 It is paul williams.
 Oh williams.
 That was the horse.
 Who's great  Yeah, uh, and it is paul lind and they don't say it but paul lind as the wicked witch of the west  Oh, okay, and he's around the thing and yeah, it's so so no, it's not ruth buzzy  But that whole thing it feels like the songs some of those might be originals and if yeah, they knew what that was  More than than some of the old time  Coughing writers knew what this was you must have flipped your shit when they said lucille ball's gonna be in our wizard of oz  I absolutely did.
 Yes, and then paul was back here paul's back  Yes, and lucille singing with ray bulger and marie osmond.
 Yes  I wanted I was like fuck this show.
 I want to talk about the wizard of oz  Put lucy in the star wars lucy in star wars doesn't feel right generation-wise either  It doesn't feel like lucy should have been alive when star wars was out.
 You think she saw it  Yes  Because she produced start she was involved in the creation of star trek.
 She didn't create it  But she was it was she you're saying lucy was an avid sci-fi enthusiast the stars.
 She loved the stars.
 She loved  She loved the gorn lucy loved the gorn on star trek  I love the gorn gary always hears me talking about the goal.
 I love gail gordon and I love the gorm  Is what uh paul lind would say about work opportunities here today gorn tomorrow  You could have been that's it that's if he's in a star trek number playing the gorn playing.
 Yeah  Yes, it showed which might have happened  Also if blanche had to work on some star trek thing and he had to have said he had written that for somebody  That feels like too easy pitching it forever.
 I pitched it in the 60s.
 I pitched it for every movie  I pitched it to jj nobody took me up on the slide.
 That's his great white whale  Is no one using here today gorn tomorrow, right? Well if we ever get on a star trek cruise  Maybe you can say that live on stage and it'll bring the house down  Yeah  Mic drop moment.
 Yeah, I don't know how we get on a star trek cruise in some capacity of performing but it's possible  You're talking I was gonna say we'll get on it by buying a ticket  But you if we have to perform on it, I think so.
 Hmm.
 I think we could do that  You know, I don't think so.
 So your dream has now become to be a cruise ship performer  On a star trek cruise with all my favorite people over 70.
 Yes, what are we doing? We're doing the this podcast  I don't know.
 I don't see why I just thought of so I have to work it out in my head a little bit  We have friends the george lou's talk show did the joe coe cruise, right?  Sure.
 Yes.
 Great.
 So they're our hookup to the cruise community.
 They're on there  We're in there's comedy shows sometimes on the jericho cruise like I feel like these are one step away  We do know somebody actually who is does a lot of stuff on the star trek cruise  But I don't know it doesn't answer the question what we're doing on it.
 What is this person going to demand of us?  What do you need? How we need it so bad person? I don't know who it is  I just look I just want to like sip a mai tai with armin shimmerman.
 That's all I want to do  That's really all this is so the getting you're saying that by guaranteeing that we're the performers on the cruise  It's a free ticket to yeah  And then like because we're just the riff raff armin's not drinking a mai tai with just anybody exactly  Once he sees that we have a performer's pass, then he's going to treat us with that respect fellow  Craftsman hello, please here.
 I bought two  I had a feeling i'd need be needing to share and then I can share with him the anecdote about wallace shawn's play  And sitting  There is a tale that i've woven podcast after podcast non podcast after podcast  And mr.
 Shimmerman when you hear it, I think you'll agree.
 It's one of the finest tales  Maybe it's just podcast the ride presents the story  And we and we you two sit there while I recount the story of going to see wallace shawn's play  And andre gregory directed and sitting behind me there.
 I was me mike carlson.
 Yeah  Little did I know I was in for the night of a lifetime  Let me set the stage  Several soft-spoken men are going to see several other soft-spoken men to a soft-spoken performance temptations get ready plays  I was all nervous because I couldn't find the email  What would the box office say if I couldn't show them the ticket email but it turns out they just needed my name and id  Poof got over that hurdle.
 I wonder if anything else is gonna happen  And then we have armin act out what he said  Oh, wow  That would be a killer thing armin playing himself in the version of the story  Oh, my neck hurts these seats when was the last time they updated these seats?  That's what he said right that was no I can tell you what he said I've said it a few times I've heard it so  Many times yet.
 I cannot remember what this story is so boring the bartender  What's what did he say?  Okay, it was it was a 17th fucking time.
 You two don't remember what he said  There was a long play and the first half would be lapping up the story if it was interesting  Jason  Barely pays attention while we do this podcast the first half of the show is 90 minutes and it was very long  It's a long story so by the end of the first day you're like, oh it's kind of a long play  Whatever armin stands up realizes there's a second half to the play  He thinks it's done and he turns to his wife and he goes, oh, I thought the play was over  Well, I guess we'll just see what happens next and then goes to the bathroom  So my joke did have the spirit correct  Yes, it was a very similar but armin was expressing what the whole audience was expressing like oh there's more, huh?  Okay  And he said it all like that and he was very positive about it  But it made me laugh made us laugh just imagining you sitting at the bar talking to him and the bartender sliding over a napkin  Sir, there is a raving man who wrote this is a five-timer at the end of their end of the bar  I don't know what it means.
 But uh, he said you would  This look it's possible i've been over here  Um, you know you guys have been chatting but since you finished let me come to you  Hat in hand hand in hat.
 I forget which  Had to say how wrong I was  That story shook me to the bone  I am so glad it's been told again and I can't wait for it to be told again and again and again  Well on the pot we'll get paid for it on the cruise.
 At least we'll get a free cruise ticket out of it  I  When the listeners add up how many times they've paid for some of the same stories over and over  And they'll figure out what a good deal it's been  The hits, uh, that's just the arman shimmerman chestnuts  There is no amount of money.
 I will not keep giving them to hear.
 Yes tales of arman  Weave your arman lore  At the what are they gonna do go to multiplex see the fucking black adam  Turn on netflix watch the russo brothers ai flicks.
 Yeah, right  They're in the right spot here with the russo brothers new ai  Dreams you can fashion all kinds of stories where arman shimmerman says something quietly to his wife at the beginning of an intermission of a play  You can even you can even mike conjure a version where jason and I remember what happened in the fucking story  And we applaud we  Have fun every time.
 Yay for mike lift him up above our heads  Uh, uh, it's something we'll figure we're gonna figure this out.
 I'll force you guys to do this somehow  I don't know how but we'll we'll figure it out somehow  Uh, anyway back to star wars.
 Well, it sounds like here is an applicable quote what you're almost saying is  I I vow by the power of my force I shall return  I vow they will like the story on the ship  Da I will tell the arman shimmerman story again.
 I vow to tell it again the story will strike back  The story the story strikes back.
 That's now that okay  That's the now we have to retire five timers and whenever we retell a story now we say the story struck back  The story strikes back.
 Ah, the story strikes back.
 Yeah, scott  Can you just confirm after he says that quote that's when he just like walks off stage left.
 He took  Yes, yeah darth vader's, uh defeat in this is walking away  Yes, and uh paul lind's defeat is wookie putting wookie putting a kind of firm hand on its one shoulder  For saying it's only turned his lesson wookie pudding  wookie pudding  Uh, uh, I you know what? I'm on such a star trek high after the season of pacard  I just like I don't even care about this show anymore  This episode or not the episode this this to this donnie marie, uh-huh I go star trek's better, you know  Than donnie and marie.
 No star wars in general.
 Wait, sorry.
 Okay.
 I'm on such a better than star wars  Yeah, yeah, i'm not such a star trek kick right now.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Yeah, that's in my star trek phase.
 Mm-hmm  So what has anything happened recently with star wars that would devalue?  Your opinion of it somehow  There's just a lot  Maybe I like some of it.
 I like some of it  I believe sir.
 We just discussed vect no crew.
 That's true.
 I like that.
 He has capable  We played by flee.
 I do but if you were a star trek fan  You right now had a season of star trek pacard where all your old favorites and when I say old favorites, I mean old  Favorites are back together on their spoiler alert old ship  And anyone who likes any of this is like riding a high  It's all anybody wants to talk about if they are the fan of this persuasion  Whoa, so you're saying you can go home again.
 You're saying it's not true that sometimes things are here today going tomorrow  Wow a red foxesque walk  Even somehow even slower than  Executed yeah, I guess let's finish out though talking about this.
 Yeah.
 Yeah, let's get to the end here  Uh, um, so there's a leaving on a jet vader leaves and they sing leaving they sing leaving a jet plane  Basically just the song they don't even really change anything about it.
 Yeah, that's what I can I understand star wars  It's that movie about jet planes  Yeah, you got it.
 Yes  Uh for whatever like they couldn't even be bothered to write an original song  Like for this or or like use the star wars theme and put lyrics to it or something  With bill murray's famous saturday night live  Sketch he put lyrics to star wars.
 They didn't have they they weren't innovating like that.
 Right?  Um, they they didn't think anyone would recognize the song.
 We know it's popular songs of the day.
 That's true  Um, so yeah, there's a big number everyone's on stage  Everyone's celebrating pauline is in is in like he's roped they tie him tie his hands in rope  He's like tighter, please  Is that all you got  If I if I'd known this is where things were heading I would have I would have been a little more bad land ahead  No one did it like pauline by which I mean no one has ever delivered dialogue in that fashion before since  Well, except for ronda santas  Oh, yeah.
 Yeah, there hasn't been such a good shaking head delivery since the recent ronda santas press interviews.
 Yes  He's the new king he's the new if he was more pauline desk i'd be in favor yeah  But I just sent this  Paul would send him up if he was still around  And i'm sure bruce too.
 I mean bruce is around but I don't know  He's not really writing on these type of shows anymore.
 There hasn't been as of this recording  There hasn't been a de santas on snl and lauren's probably like we need a lind type.
 Yeah, we don't have a lind.
 That's true  uh, um, so  anyway, this uh, uh was a special I didn't know I didn't know about it it popped up on instagram and I went well  This feels right up our alley and of course as always all of our characters appear  It's almost as like we make them wish on a piece of like we see some schlocky thing  We make a wish and then like michael eisner appears.
 We make a wish in a wishing cave in a wishing cave  If you see yeah if you see something on it's like I guess we're drawn to our type of stuff in our guys  and not the guys in the sense of like  Tillman for tita guys our other guys and we still have yet to differentiate between types of guys  But these are also our guys like capital g and lowercase g  Is the capital for the I think is bad.
 Yeah, so the villains are bad  So bruce and thurl and paul are lowercase g's.
 Yeah, there are there  You're this is mark marron guys as opposed to these are these are our guys.
 That's good.
 Okay, that's a good distinction.
 Uh,  My question is here.
 I just just let's let's wind it down.
 But  one thing that I like about this is that  It like I kind of like that.
 They just dove in not knowing the mythology  I think it's crazy how people are too strict and serious about mythology of this or anything  If this kind of show was on today  more recent property  How do we do how do we do a musical number?  That paul lind can factor into and play a part in yes.
 Yes, that's I mean star wars especially right now is yes  There's too much.
 There's no there's no hoopla.
 There's no  fun party happening with it  Um versus the gorn on the star trek cruise who's just like an alcoholic party monster  You know, there's that at least and like the lower dex is a show with people we know that are on it  And I actually i've watched a little of it and it's like a weird  They're a little it's a little looser over there in star trek land is what i'm trying to say  Yeah, yeah, they get to have a little more fun.
 Yes.
 It is not lower dex in the success of it proof  That if you have a little more fun, it's a little it might pay off just sometimes  That the one that's flashing to me, I mean in terms of a lind part  And like obviously and it's like it's a it's a serious mythology  Uh, it's a very like there are no laughs in avatar  So if there was if there was something on today to do like a very  Avatar  variety kind of song and it's maybe it's then you gotta have lind as  Uh avatar corich  And there's gotta be some well, it's do you have the pitch?  I'll let you do it.
 Uh, because like he would have his own like kind of reveal moment because if you've seen avatar two  Uh, you know quarich is now and as a navi  So at this point paul wakes up he's blue and he goes i'm blue  Like that's what else you want  Yeah, yeah perfect.
 Well, I guess you want like I mean this implies that all these people are still alive  But you need like oh well paul williams is spider.
 Oh my god  I was gonna say paul in his grown-up spider.
 Oh, no, not grown up.
 I cut the hair  Let's do high maintenance  Let's do the de-aging thing with like harrison ford in the indiana jolt like let's do that with paul now so he can play  Himself when he was younger as spider still around so he could do it.
 That's what i'm saying  Yeah, yeah, do it like mark hamill and mandalorian de-aged.
 Yeah, do that technology  And have paul play his younger self as spider and he's what he sings like you're walking into spider webs  Leave a misagenda call you back.
 Yes like an old time  Yeah, well his spider is always spinning his webs right villains are getting caught in I think it's great that's great  Yeah, I was still hung up on um  paul linden star wars  Because then I in my head I just started saying thron.
 I don't know what's wrong with this thron today  About admiral thron the extended universe  Yeah that they're begrudgingly putting in the tv show well not well, so felony's not  This is a whole other conversation.
 That's the timothy's on he likes it  Yeah, timothy's on wrote these three novels that are kind of some people consider the actual  I haven't read them.
 I know the stories, but I haven't read them because again i'm not a reader like jason is  um, but  There's three novels that are sort of what happens after the main trilogy and to a lot of people that's you know  Lucas mary damara jade these these other characters that were thrown out when they made the disney sequels  And the main villain of the whole of all three of them are a guy is a guy named grand admiral thron  He's a blue guy and they have I think he's appeared on the mandalorian or boba fat  I think he's been in some of the cartoons some of the three yes, he's for sure been in there  But like he's going to be uh the villain for whatever so jason is imagining paul and singing about him  Grand admiral thron the only you guys can answer this is paul linda thron  Well thron seems scared no  Thrawn seems a little colder paul's a little more bombastic  So so what 70s the people are dying to know what 70s variety show mainstay could be thron.
 Oh, gregory peck  Did gregory beck do that many varieties I think he was on some I could be wrong  But a lot of the johnny cash.
 I mean, that's the thing there.
 Yeah, they did all do this kind of thing  They were all on stuff.
 Um  So, yeah, there's a lot yes if if we were doing extended universe stuff vincent price  Yeah, great price is good, but it would be funny to see paul linden the big white officer outfit and the blue face paint  Yeah, well  Would be a joy to see him doing anything.
 Yeah, quite frankly.
 Um, so  Yeah, I was I have this is one of those things where I have to say something that I don't want to open up  I just have to say it get out of my head because I was just reading about it  Are you breaking up with us or something? What's going on? I'm so sorry.
 I'm leaving this podcast to do a star trek podcast  Look, I probably will not make fun of the armin shimmerman story again  I like I can't handle it  My mental health is taking a toll when that story gets mocked because every morning I wake up and think it's a good story  I'm gonna do it again next time one of these days.
 They're gonna get it.
 They don't understand.
 Uh, no, no, uh,  Just we're talking about the thron trilogy.
 I was reading about the shatner verse  Which is a oh tech war no  But I love tech war and I want to do an episode about tech war eventually  Can I start packing up the gear? Well, you guys go turn your mic off and we can be done with my laptop  William shatter's tech war is another original show that he had which we need to talk about  Uh, it's a future show with no budget about a illegal drug called tech  Everyone is good looking for tech  William shatter is like not the star but the main character is a character named jimmy johnny cardigan  johnny cardigan is like on the like stopping people from dealing tech  And yes, it's not track.
 It's tech t.
 E.
 K  William shatter's tech war.
 Hey, i'm really sorry about this  And there's so much  I gotta find a moment to distance myself from mike here.
 This is what I want to talk about but tech war there's many shows graphic novels books  I'm sure william shatter never wrote a word of them, but he is credited as that speaking of william shatter's writing though  However, I do want to talk about you're not done eight or nine novels called the shatter verse that william shatter  Is credited as the writer on where he writes?  Himself his character captain kirk coming back to life after star trek generations  And they call these books the shatter verse and he has a whole nother alternative narrative where captain kirk thrives and has  other adventures past  And there are eight or nine.
 It's just like him and captain picard going on adventures and he is the writer  I'm sure they're ghost written though, but this is this is like the  Your adventures of still talking about this after we leave the room.
 Yes, leave the microphones on yes  And yes, I also honestly think I thought I thought mike was down for the count  But then he came back to life and got to talk about the entire shatter.
 He's talking about a played straight garth  Marengi's dark place  Satin  It is not funny.
 I think i'm full honestly  I I do have I kind of think a full podcast about william shatter's career  Is sustainable.
 Oh just an entire what you mean a sat not to say i'm not distancing my say  This is a separate podcast.
 Yeah.
 Yeah, but it's probably a good idea.
 There's so much on there.
 Yeah.
 Yeah  No, you're getting into music.
 I like to work band.
 It has been I love it  It's gonna be a long long time.
 Yes  Um, he's got like 12 albums  Wow, this man does not want to die and he is so adamant not to die.
 He will take anything that is offered  Uh, so anyway, you mean tech well tech to keep himself alive  Wait and and by the way, uh, if if paulin was in a tech war, um variety  Skits yes.
 Yes.
 Um, geez, what can what does a guy got to do to get some tech around here?  All right, you survived  If you want to dig even deeper  Join us on our vip patreon tier club three where you get one more bonus episode every month and our regular episodes ad free  I believe disneyland smoking area is now officially coming.
