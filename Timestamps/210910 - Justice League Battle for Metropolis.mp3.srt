1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,840
Forever.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:03,680
Dog.

3
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:07,400
Warning, the following podcast features Mrs. Taz,

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:10,800
abandoned gas grills, teens that live in Valencia,

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,380
and the famous superheroes Batman, Superman,

6
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,740
and Scottie Pippen.

7
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:17,460
All this plus Scottie Gairdner takes his first trip

8
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,720
to Six Flags Magic Mountain on today's podcast, The Ride.

9
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:26,720
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, the only theme park podcast

10
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,960
that blasts you with blue fog at the top of every episode.

11
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,800
I'm Jason Sheridan, joined as always by Scott Gairdner.

12
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,480
There it is.

13
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,920
Unless it was out, unless we didn't distribute it properly

14
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,640
to all the bones.

15
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,480
We use Six Flags Fog People, so you never know.

16
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,920
Yeah, it's very possible it's sputtering

17
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,000
like a poorly kept 4D theater.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,840
Mike Carlson also here.

19
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,800
Yes, I'm here and I'm also disappointed

20
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:17,160
that our fog isn't always so on point,

21
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,640
that our fog blasts aren't just always really

22
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,560
like stunning fog blasts.

23
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:27,240
We really should, I don't know, do we have to pay more money?

24
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,200
Or do people like that?

25
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,020
Do they like the charm of our fog blasts?

26
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,840
Maybe that's what they like.

27
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:37,840
They may like that, they don't like the decreased projection

28
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,880
against Joker gas, against laughing gas.

29
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:41,720
Ah.

30
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,540
So.

31
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:46,380
But this is not laughing gas, this is just fog, fog,

32
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,700
as some people might call it.

33
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:51,460
Well, it's like the fog that Cyborg developed

34
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:52,300
to protect you from the two.

35
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,660
Right, right, but I'm saying like fog, you're fog,

36
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:57,820
I think I say fog more if we're talking pronunciation.

37
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,260
Oh yeah.

38
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:02,720
Yeah, I mean, you're in the Midwest right now.

39
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,860
Your accent may be slipping back in.

40
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:06,780
Yes, that is true.

41
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,180
We're gonna give you a little peek behind the curtain.

42
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:10,580
I am in the Midwest at the moment.

43
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:12,540
And yeah, I could say, I could go back,

44
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,260
I could call soda pop.

45
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:16,200
I could do a whole number of different things

46
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:19,440
that would show my true roots because I'm feeling it here.

47
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,760
It just rained.

48
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,620
That doesn't happen in Southern California.

49
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,080
So I'm really, I'm feeling it.

50
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,760
I'm feeling like a kid again, to be honest with you.

51
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,880
You dripping?

52
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,920
You bring some rainwater on it,

53
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,200
did you splash onto the mic?

54
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,760
I like that as just sort of a phrase

55
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,600
to see how you're doing.

56
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,800
Hey, you dripping?

57
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,000
Yeah, I went out for a second.

58
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,960
You guys dripping?

59
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:42,300
Yeah, I am not dripping, I will say that.

60
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,140
I am not.

61
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:46,900
It's also very close to Pippin,

62
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,540
which of course, Scottie Pippin,

63
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,560
Chicago Bull, long time Chicago Bull,

64
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,500
who had a juice box called Scottie Pippin's Zippin

65
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,260
in the mid 90s.

66
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,100
Really?

67
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,580
So it reminds me of that as well,

68
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:01,540
which all again, childhood, I'm here.

69
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:04,060
I'm in Schaumburg, Illinois.

70
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:06,240
So yeah, I'm feeling it.

71
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,580
You know, my dad has interacted with Scottie Pippin

72
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,100
on a golf course.

73
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,460
I think you have told us this before,

74
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,700
but may I mention that?

75
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,380
I don't remember the details.

76
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:19,260
I think you may have run into him several times.

77
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:22,780
And the details are mildly embarrassing

78
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:27,780
because any big Scott Garner heads out there,

79
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:31,300
I'm sure there's thousands to millions of you.

80
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,740
There's a video I did a long time ago called Beatles 3000.

81
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:37,780
And the idea is that it's a documentary done way

82
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:40,020
in the future of people trying to figure out

83
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,500
what the Beatles were a thousand years ago

84
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,620
using like poorly constructed,

85
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:46,940
like you could, there's barely any information.

86
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:49,020
It's just the ruins of civilization.

87
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,820
And can we figure out what the Beatles were?

88
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:54,120
And due to a poorly reconstructed photograph,

89
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,500
they think that Scottie Pippin was the fourth Beatle.

90
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:03,100
And so he's like rendered in the video

91
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,780
in Beatles fashion, like an artist rendering.

92
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:08,980
And just, you know, the name worked well, I thought.

93
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:10,940
And like, so that's fun.

94
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:12,940
My dad thought, oh, this is a good thing

95
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,100
to talk to him about.

96
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,860
Maybe he's been made aware of this video.

97
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:17,860
I would have known this.

98
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:18,740
Sorry, continue.

99
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:23,580
He, well, you know, and so he just went up to him,

100
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:26,980
like found him, you know, between holes or something

101
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,020
and walked up and like, yeah, Scottie, what's going on?

102
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:30,900
You ever heard of this video?

103
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,660
It's a video, it's on, it's a Beatles video.

104
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,260
It's on the YouTube channel.

105
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:37,180
It's on Scott Garner and he's on the YouTube,

106
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:41,140
like his poor way of explaining what anything is current.

107
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:45,440
So that's already, he's at a deficit there.

108
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,420
This is also the COVID era.

109
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:50,740
So nobody should be charging up to anybody anywhere,

110
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:53,100
even though people are careful on the golf course.

111
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:56,820
But I think, I believe Scottie just kind of like blinked

112
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,980
and nodded and like, huh, okay, no,

113
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:01,980
I don't know what you, sorry, gotta go, bye.

114
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:05,620
I think this is an extremely awkward interaction.

115
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:10,580
The video is not familiar to him, despite going viral.

116
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,700
Somehow it didn't make its way to,

117
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,100
On his desk, yeah.

118
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:17,260
Yeah, you know, and anybody in the Pippin enterprise,

119
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,300
you know, what do you do?

120
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,180
You gotta keep him aware of how he's being represented

121
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:25,580
in culture, especially internet viral culture in 2009.

122
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:27,940
So, or else, you know, dads end up

123
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:30,500
in awkward situations like that.

124
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,660
That could have really protected your father from that.

125
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:33,620
Yeah.

126
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:36,060
He could have said like, oh, of course I know it.

127
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,860
It's my favorite video.

128
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:38,700
Yeah, yeah.

129
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:41,540
It's better than any bulls highlight I ever watch.

130
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:44,420
That's my favorite thing that I ever was a part of.

131
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:46,940
You know, Mr. Gertner, you said it was.

132
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:49,500
I, for a long time, wondered if my place

133
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,060
in pop culture was set.

134
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:54,940
And then I wasn't sure, no matter how many rebounds I got

135
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,620
or points I scored.

136
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:01,620
But when I saw that video, I knew that I was for the ages.

137
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,020
So thank you, sir.

138
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,260
And bless your son.

139
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,460
Man, what could have been?

140
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:08,660
And the last thing I'll say real quick about Scotty

141
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,140
before we actually get to the actual topic

142
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:14,020
is that Scotty has his own bourbon now called Digits.

143
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:16,140
And it's only carried around here.

144
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:19,940
You better believe I'm getting Scotty Pippin's Digits bourbon

145
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:22,060
while I'm in Chicago.

146
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:22,900
I'm very excited.

147
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,540
He also has a popcorn called Husk

148
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:26,500
that he's been promoting that I'm very interested in as well.

149
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:30,380
But Digits is really my main focus at the moment.

150
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:33,740
Sorry, has he been promoting it or is it his actual,

151
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:37,420
has he been involved in the popcorn recipe?

152
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,820
I'm clear with Husk and I apologize for not knowing more.

153
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:43,940
He seems to be less featured as far as in the Husk marketing,

154
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:47,460
but Digits seems to be much more his thing.

155
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,420
Wow, Digits referred to.

156
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:50,260
Yeah.

157
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:52,660
Oh, I forget, I should know that, but I don't.

158
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:54,420
But what you're saying is you could wash down

159
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:57,460
some Husk popcorn with some Digits bourbon.

160
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,180
That's correct.

161
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:02,300
Because I liked, believe it or not,

162
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,460
I'm not the biggest sports fan in the world,

163
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:06,660
but my two teams were like the 1990 Chicago Cubs

164
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:09,580
and then of course the Bulls, the Chicago Bulls,

165
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:11,140
which were like, you know what?

166
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,420
I'm gonna tie it back, watch this.

167
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:15,340
I liked the Chicago Bulls so much at the time

168
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:18,340
because they felt to me like the Justice League

169
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:19,180
or the Avengers.

170
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:21,820
They felt like superheroes.

171
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:24,940
They all were like fascinating in their own way.

172
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:27,140
And obviously they were just unstoppable.

173
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:29,580
And that is a big part of why I still have

174
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:32,820
so much affection for Chicago Bulls.

175
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,460
That's how I felt about the dream team,

176
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:35,980
which Scottie Pippen was also on,

177
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:39,300
that it felt like, oh, this is like when the all-stars,

178
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:43,140
it's like a bigger all-star game that's beyond one night.

179
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:44,900
And I liked that they wore different clothes

180
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:45,740
for the all-star game.

181
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:47,580
Yes, they had different uniforms.

182
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,540
The most different, because they wear like all white

183
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:51,980
as if they'd been like magically transformed

184
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,420
in a Captain EO kind of way.

185
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:54,260
Right, it's like the-

186
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:55,260
It's all very magical.

187
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:57,300
Right, it's like when the Avengers in Endgame

188
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:00,460
go back in time and they have to put on like their time suits.

189
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:02,340
So it's like they're different superheroes now

190
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,140
for the dream team get together.

191
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:06,260
This is, by the way, real sad for the context

192
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:08,860
that certain people's brains have to get into

193
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,020
to be very into sports.

194
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,180
I am aware of that, but this is-

195
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:13,180
Yeah, it's all outfit oriented.

196
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:15,340
It's outfit oriented.

197
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:18,940
Did you see the behind the scenes stuff

198
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:21,460
that was going around where it's like those time suits

199
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:25,500
they wore, which are very just like beige,

200
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:29,740
beige-y white, like were largely CG.

201
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:33,340
You're talking about the Avengers, not the dream team.

202
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:34,180
Yes, okay.

203
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,500
No, the dream team was practical.

204
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,900
The Avengers time suits were-

205
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:39,740
Okay, good.

206
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:43,020
To get that perfect washed out beige, washed out red,

207
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:46,580
they had to put the dots and everything on them.

208
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,820
Yeah, there's a lot of funny like superhero

209
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,780
behind the scenes footage that,

210
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,460
and I think we maybe talked about this not long ago.

211
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,940
There's a scene in Black Widow where they're just

212
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,980
that sort of arrest stop truck stop thing

213
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,980
and Black Widow's there with her sister

214
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,780
and they're talking at a bench or whatever.

215
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,580
And it turned out like that the whole thing

216
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,100
was green screen in the background

217
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,900
and it's just a very mundane place.

218
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:10,220
Like, I don't know why that would have to be the place

219
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,940
where you'd have to use green screen.

220
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,500
It's like nighttime and there's one other table

221
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,860
in the background.

222
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,260
Right, right.

223
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:19,860
So I am always amused actually when I see some

224
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,620
of the behind the scenes stuff for superhero movies.

225
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,940
Cause yeah, it will be like the costume will be,

226
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,300
somebody's wearing like a bracelet

227
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,980
and there's just dots there

228
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,780
where they have to digitally insert the brace,

229
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:30,940
like the very mundane bracelet or something.

230
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:31,780
So-

231
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:32,820
You couldn't buy a bracelet.

232
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:37,020
The actor wasn't willing to grow their hair out.

233
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,820
You couldn't have put like a wig there.

234
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,020
You put like a string of dots.

235
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:43,820
At that point, just put a hair extension on.

236
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,180
No, it's too hard.

237
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,980
Cause then you can manipulate the hair better

238
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,340
in post, I guess.

239
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:50,900
You can make it catch the light exactly perfectly.

240
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,380
Yeah, yeah, no, it's better to just, yeah.

241
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:54,460
Just do it all in post.

242
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:57,540
That was a beautiful way of tying it back into the topic.

243
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:00,620
I'm gonna go ahead and untie it backwards

244
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:04,540
and say that I've now learned that husk is no mere popcorn.

245
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:05,780
This is an organic-

246
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:06,980
Yes, yes, I knew that.

247
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:11,980
Superfood popcorn with unconventional flavor.

248
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:17,100
You say unconventional, I say awful sounding

249
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:20,340
like cayenne and ginger, kale and broccoli.

250
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:22,860
How much kale are you getting in popcorn?

251
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,860
Have you ever tried though, like kale chips

252
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:27,660
that are like cheddar kale chips before?

253
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,500
Those are good.

254
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,340
That sounds familiar.

255
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:31,380
Oh, I'm not against, look, kale in things

256
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,500
is I'm not unilaterally against.

257
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,980
I think popcorn is an odd place to try to jam it.

258
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:39,820
There's barely any food in popcorn.

259
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:43,700
It's almost like eating flavored paper, you know?

260
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,980
Where are you even inserting these flavors?

261
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:46,860
Yeah, I don't know.

262
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:47,700
It's a good question.

263
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:51,460
I'm more, Lindsay is a big popcorn fan,

264
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:54,820
so I have had more popcorn in the last so many years

265
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,300
and I'm intrigued now.

266
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,860
I wouldn't have been intrigued 10 years ago,

267
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:02,220
but I am more intrigued now by husk,

268
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:05,140
the organic popcorn endorsed by Scottie Pippen.

269
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:10,140
Does one bag being $5, how does that affect your intrigue?

270
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:13,660
Well, Jason obviously is gonna be reeling from that price.

271
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,940
How big a bag are we talking?

272
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:20,260
154 grams.

273
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:22,260
I'm sorry, the information I have to present to you

274
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:26,220
is unusable because who can picture what a gram is?

275
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,820
I can't, we're gonna have to do some conversions.

276
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,380
I'm sorry, this is not the research

277
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:32,860
that you're not equipped here, thanks to the grams.

278
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,820
Well, I just learned about husk and digits.

279
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:39,660
So like, Mike, are you going to like a local watering hole?

280
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:44,700
Like the old bears dive, the bears themed dive bar

281
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,380
to get like a shot of digits or you're getting a bottle?

282
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:49,820
Oh, I think I'm gonna get, yeah, still in the pandemic.

283
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:52,540
I'm not gonna go to probably a dive bar for a while.

284
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:55,140
So I will probably get a bottle of it

285
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,820
as opposed to going to like downtown

286
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,580
and going to like Ditkos or something,

287
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:00,340
if that's what you're thinking.

288
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:03,380
Going to Ditkos or going to Jordan's Steakhouse.

289
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:05,780
I wonder if Jordan's Steakhouse carries digits.

290
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:07,780
That would be an interesting question.

291
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,020
That would be, yeah.

292
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,940
And if it doesn't, then why?

293
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:12,780
Why?

294
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:15,980
Can we get a multi-part documentary series on that?

295
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,980
On that decision or lack thereof?

296
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,900
Yeah, I want, no, as far as,

297
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,900
did we all watch the last dance?

298
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:22,740
Yes.

299
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:25,820
I mean, I could do, give me a documentary on every game

300
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:28,740
as far as those seasons are concerned.

301
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,980
Oh yeah, no, they should just like,

302
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:33,100
show us all the rough, but I think who,

303
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,380
like we all devoured it when the pandemic started.

304
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:38,900
By May or June, if they just said, here's all the dailies,

305
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,100
wouldn't you have watched them?

306
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,220
Oh, a hundred percent, yes.

307
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,060
And I also-

308
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,980
Every piece of it is just,

309
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:46,500
let me just watch Jordan sit down and get back up

310
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,620
and ask for water.

311
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:48,460
I just like-

312
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:53,460
Watch the levels of his cup, of his glass of tequila.

313
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:54,820
Yes.

314
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,100
Rising and falling.

315
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:56,940
That would be great.

316
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:57,940
What's getting poured in there?

317
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,500
What's the drink of choice?

318
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,500
Yep.

319
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:04,060
I also want it from every bowl's vantage point too,

320
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:06,500
because obviously that's like very Jordan centric

321
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:08,860
as far as the retelling of all the things.

322
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,940
So like give me a full Last Dance told

323
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:13,340
from Tony Kukoc's perspective,

324
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,060
from Randy Brown's perspective,

325
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,980
from any of the other Chicago bowls.

326
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,540
I am interested in all of it.

327
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:21,060
That's how obsessed I am with it.

328
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:23,060
And obviously the America as well.

329
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:26,980
Yeah, and if Kukoc has any liquor or food endeavors,

330
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,540
I'd like to know about those as well.

331
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:30,380
I would too.

332
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:31,220
I'll invest.

333
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:35,140
Yeah, we'll all invest in Tony Kukoc's endeavors,

334
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:35,980
food or otherwise.

335
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:36,820
Vodka.

336
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:37,660
Yeah.

337
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:38,500
Whatever it is.

338
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,340
Okay, all right.

339
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,660
So let's tie it back in.

340
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:43,060
It's a super food popcorn, the rides about superheroes.

341
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:43,900
There, we're back.

342
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:46,420
We're in and it is Justice League.

343
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:51,260
It is Six Flags, Justice League, Battle for Metropolis,

344
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:54,500
which has been touched on the show a little bit before.

345
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,340
And in various ways,

346
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:58,820
because we've talked about our trips to Six Flags.

347
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:01,660
We've talked about all the rides based on Batman,

348
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:02,740
but we left this one out

349
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,340
because it's kind of its own thing.

350
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:06,980
But the big headline here,

351
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:10,260
it's really like what the ride is

352
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:13,380
that most Six Flags rides are not.

353
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,060
It is a dark ride.

354
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,580
It is a screen ride.

355
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:18,380
It involves IP.

356
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:22,540
We in a bigger, we in a robotic manner.

357
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:24,980
It's not just IP and that like the name was used

358
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:28,260
and put on a ride that has a green track or a blue track.

359
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,740
And that's the color of the hero.

360
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:30,900
Exactly.

361
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,620
It's an interactive ride, a 3D ride, a shooting ride.

362
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:38,420
This is all genres that Six Flags has not really tackled.

363
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:39,340
And they started doing it.

364
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:43,660
I think these all went in circa 2015 through 2017.

365
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:46,380
Yes, animatronics as well.

366
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:48,820
There's a big animatronics component.

367
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,420
Depending on how much money you wanna spend,

368
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:52,940
there might be more animatronics.

369
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:57,940
But yeah, it is, I think generally positive development.

370
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:02,180
I would love to see more of it because frankly,

371
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:06,300
I think if you're talking about big characters,

372
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,860
big intellectual property,

373
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:11,980
I don't think any has been more squandered in theme parks

374
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:16,980
than the DC comics, Superman and Batman and Wonder,

375
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,940
like the biggest, some of the biggest,

376
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:22,380
most recognizable characters in the world.

377
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,980
We did the episode, it could have been a year ago.

378
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:27,180
It could have been three weeks ago

379
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,940
as far as Batman the rides.

380
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:31,900
And yeah, we kind of came to that conclusion there.

381
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:34,580
There are some okay Batman rides.

382
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:35,540
You add in the other,

383
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:37,420
we add in Superman and Wonder Woman all that.

384
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:40,100
And then it's like really like egregious.

385
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,100
It's truly insane.

386
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,900
These characters are not better utilized.

387
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,220
Right.

388
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:47,420
This also felt like when this was announced,

389
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,780
I think people were maybe getting their hopes up.

390
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:51,580
And maybe I'm just speaking about myself

391
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:53,140
or Jason, I guess said it too.

392
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:54,740
People were like, oh, maybe Six Flags

393
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:57,180
is now gonna kind of get in the game

394
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:00,580
as far as being a more well-rounded park

395
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:03,060
and do more of this type of thing.

396
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:05,900
But I don't think there's any talk of that, right?

397
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:08,340
We're in, we're almost, this year's almost over.

398
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:09,500
There's no like announcement

399
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,020
that there's a new dark ride coming to Six Flags, right?

400
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,420
I don't think so, which is a shame

401
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,780
because I think number two

402
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,860
of Squandered Intellectual Properties

403
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:19,300
is the Looney Tunes characters.

404
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:22,260
Like, I mean, at the theme parks and movies,

405
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,820
let's be frank, at this point,

406
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:26,340
we're all after this past summer,

407
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:29,300
we're all like begging for like back in action

408
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,500
Looney Tunes quality.

409
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:33,820
We're all like, we're all gonna do more basketball talk.

410
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:36,020
We have to talk about the Justice League.

411
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:36,860
Yes.

412
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:37,700
Well, that's okay,

413
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:42,700
because basketball is not a huge component in Space Jam 2.

414
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,020
I don't know, the movie you were watching,

415
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:46,140
there's an hour long basketball game.

416
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:48,300
In which the points don't matter.

417
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,140
Yeah, that's-

418
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:51,660
Like, whose line is it anyway?

419
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:55,740
It's all about bonus games and extraneous or shit.

420
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,180
Yeah, basketball,

421
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:59,980
told, not showed, what's the term?

422
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:04,980
Like, doing the opposite of most screenwriting techniques.

423
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:09,260
Yeah, so yeah, I think that Looney Tunes,

424
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,860
yeah, Six Flags, I think people were like,

425
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:13,780
oh wow, maybe Six Flags now like every other year

426
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:15,540
will get maybe like a new dark ride

427
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:18,460
and then the Six Flags parks could get a little bit more,

428
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:20,460
yeah, transformed, well rounded.

429
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:22,420
Not that they have to be Disney or Universal,

430
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:25,940
but it is nice to go on a robot ride in between

431
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:28,300
a ride that's gonna rattle your brain

432
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,020
or crush your genitals.

433
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:32,300
That's nice.

434
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,180
Yeah. Yes, yeah.

435
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:39,180
Well, and this ride existing gave me a good reason

436
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:44,300
to make my first proper trip to Six Flags Magic Mountain.

437
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:48,180
As I've said before, despite growing up in Los Angeles,

438
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:51,660
I never went because it's all rides that scare me.

439
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:55,900
And besides doing a fairly depressing Christmas drive-through,

440
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,620
when we were in super lockdown back in December,

441
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,940
that was really, that was the first time

442
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:02,660
I was ever on the ground.

443
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:07,460
So this Justice League caused me to go for the first time

444
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:10,220
as a regular paying customer.

445
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:11,860
So now I'm coming to the table

446
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,860
with my first Magic Mountain experience,

447
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,380
which is pretty exciting.

448
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:18,060
And Jason and I are comic book boys, as we know,

449
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:21,260
we're Marvel boys, but we are also DC boys too.

450
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:23,820
I don't wanna shortchange DC.

451
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:24,940
Yeah, I don't wanna either.

452
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:27,580
I mean, my notes have the phrase speed, force,

453
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:29,420
and hyper time in them, you know,

454
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:31,140
and I'm sure we'll get to that.

455
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:32,420
We'll talk about favorite Flash.

456
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:34,220
Who's your favorite Flash?

457
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:35,180
You know?

458
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:38,980
Wally West, 90s Wally West, but you know, we'll get back.

459
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,540
Yeah, we'll get back to that.

460
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:42,060
I was gonna say Bart Allen, Impulse,

461
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:44,060
but then he was Kid Flash, but okay.

462
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:44,900
I don't know if you found him.

463
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:45,740
Yeah, close number two.

464
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:46,580
You counted Foley as a Flash.

465
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:47,420
Anyway, let's go ahead.

466
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:49,780
I'd go Drewmont Creaf would be my name.

467
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:54,180
Yeah, a little known Flash, but still.

468
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,260
I'm going with the real heads.

469
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,020
Beloved by, yeah, the real hard core.

470
00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:01,460
Yeah, sidekick to Max Mercury, cousin to Jesse Quick.

471
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:03,220
You know? Of course, of course, of course.

472
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:04,060
Yeah, of course.

473
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:09,060
So let's start, man, let's start with Scott's day, I think.

474
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:11,820
Yeah, Scott. I would love to.

475
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:12,700
Yeah.

476
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,540
Cause there was, oh yes, go ahead.

477
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:16,700
Oh, I was gonna say, did you go up?

478
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,180
Did you happen to hit one of the days

479
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:20,140
during the heat wave when you were there?

480
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,780
No, I was actively avoiding it.

481
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:22,780
Yeah, I've been like,

482
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:25,660
like eyeing temperatures for the last couple of weeks

483
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:27,660
because it's been getting a little crazy.

484
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:31,860
And Santa Clarita is a little hotter than where we live.

485
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,940
Like there was a day where we didn't end up doing it

486
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:36,580
cause it was, it was north of a hundred.

487
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:39,660
So I'm glad we avoided that.

488
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:43,020
So one detail everybody should know about me going,

489
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:46,900
and this sort of helped triangulate everything is,

490
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:49,820
there was a friend of mine, a friend of ours,

491
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:52,620
friend of the show, Buzz Buzz Skittle Scattle,

492
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:56,340
told me that he was, he had a free ticket somehow

493
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,260
to Magic Mountain.

494
00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:00,220
And he was just asking me like, you know,

495
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:01,260
is this worth going?

496
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:02,900
Is there, is there stuff to check out?

497
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,780
I realized like, oh, maybe we could do something

498
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:05,620
for the show.

499
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:06,740
I would love to go.

500
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:10,060
And that's where my friend told me that despite,

501
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:12,420
well, despite being, he didn't call himself this,

502
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:16,580
but despite being the most dangerous man in podcasting,

503
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:21,260
he is apparently not into big old thrill rides.

504
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,780
So he did not even want to go on.

505
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:24,780
So he was asking me, is there stuff to do

506
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:27,260
if we don't go on big roller coasters?

507
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:29,460
And I'm like, well, this is fantastic

508
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:32,080
because this is my way to go to Magic Mountain

509
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,100
without being goaded into doing a bunch of stuff

510
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,100
that I don't want to do.

511
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,420
So unfortunately for the listener,

512
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:41,940
I can't tell any stories about getting my nuts crushed

513
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:45,660
or screaming my vocal cords out at the top of Tatsuit

514
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:46,540
or whatever.

515
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:48,260
I did almost nothing.

516
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:52,820
I was in a safe space where both of us

517
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:55,220
were avoiding things like that.

518
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,060
I see.

519
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:57,980
So you didn't even do any roller co-

520
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:00,460
Did you do anything roller coaster wise?

521
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:02,340
We did.

522
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:05,380
So yeah, well, so he, you know, he's asking me,

523
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:06,900
is there enough to do if we go?

524
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,460
I say, well, I've been meaning to do Justice League

525
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:10,620
Battle for Metropolis.

526
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:11,940
It's a screenwriter, it's got robots,

527
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,540
all this stuff that they don't really do.

528
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:15,540
He's like, great, let's do it, let's go.

529
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,300
And let's figure out what we can do there.

530
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:21,260
What is a day at Six Flags where you aren't going on

531
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:23,500
a bunch of roller coasters.

532
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:26,180
Now we did, we did hit up one,

533
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:27,300
because I was looking into it and like,

534
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:30,900
it's gotta be one that's pseudo tame enough to do.

535
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,740
And I did Ninja.

536
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:37,660
Ninja is like pretty not adventurous, I would say.

537
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:39,100
Anybody done Ninja?

538
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:42,140
That is swinging, goes through the trees, is that right?

539
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,420
Yes, yeah, pretty much.

540
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:47,260
Yeah, suspended coaster, there's not a lot of them left.

541
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,740
They look like little boats to me,

542
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:51,900
like you're kind of in a little plastic boat.

543
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:54,620
Yeah, I always thought of those as very comforting.

544
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:56,780
I don't know why, I don't know if they're any safer,

545
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:59,620
more or less safe, I think going through the forest,

546
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:01,940
like, you know, usually you go through some sort

547
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:03,540
of landscaping in those.

548
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:07,540
And that always appealed to me.

549
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:10,700
And I think that was a kind that like when I was younger,

550
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,740
like that was dipping my toes in,

551
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:14,620
I would try a suspended coaster.

552
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:17,500
Yes, yeah, there's one at Kings Island

553
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,660
that I think was called Top Gun when I went.

554
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:22,060
And that was like within my comfort zone.

555
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:25,540
This one still is, got pretty fast.

556
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:28,660
You get splashed by the nearby flume ride

557
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:30,700
while you're on it, early tweeted,

558
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,300
which was kind of jarring,

559
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:35,060
getting a splash in the face on this coaster.

560
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:39,340
But like pretty pleasant experience.

561
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:43,060
One odd thing about it, my friend lost his hat

562
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:45,180
while we were on the ride.

563
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:47,180
Did end up finding it, it was just in the row.

564
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:49,300
It like fell immediately to the row behind us,

565
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:50,820
which was empty.

566
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,380
But then I was like, every little day,

567
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:53,980
I was looking up Six Flags deaths,

568
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:56,220
and I found out one of the deaths was somebody going

569
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:59,980
and looking for his hat in the ninja,

570
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:03,380
in the grounds of ninja and getting whacked

571
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:05,060
by the attraction, yes.

572
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:06,300
Yeah.

573
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:09,260
If you don't wear hats that you think you're gonna miss.

574
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,020
Don't look for them.

575
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:11,860
They certainly don't look for them,

576
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:14,100
which it's weird that this even happened,

577
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:17,540
because again, Magic Ground is entirely new to me.

578
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:20,460
And so one of the big things that I noted

579
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:22,020
and didn't know about before

580
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:26,060
is the constant warning signs on fences.

581
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:30,820
There are so many, it's just extreme caution or explosive.

582
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:33,580
There's a big sign about something being explosive

583
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:36,940
right next to a ride that's like Tweety's cages.

584
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:40,180
It's like the most four little kids ride.

585
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:43,620
There's scary warnings like every 10 feet.

586
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:44,740
It's wild.

587
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:47,380
Huh, you know, actually that's funny is that

588
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:48,540
if you're a listener now

589
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:50,220
and maybe this is one of your first episodes,

590
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:53,020
go back and listen to our Six Flags Fight Fest episode,

591
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:54,620
because that's my first time going to Magic Mountain

592
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:55,700
a couple years ago.

593
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,820
And I don't, there's a lot of things I noticed

594
00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:00,180
on that episode, but that is actually not one of them.

595
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:01,940
I didn't even notice that there were a lot of like

596
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:05,260
disclaimers basically everywhere in the park.

597
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:07,380
It is more now than there used to be.

598
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:08,740
I don't know, it was crazy.

599
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:12,500
I was certainly thinking about that Fright Fest episode.

600
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,820
And it was, you know, easy too,

601
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:17,540
because they're starting to put up Fright Fest stuff.

602
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:19,660
I for one felt a little starstruck

603
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:23,620
when I saw one of the fabled fog machines.

604
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:24,660
Oh yeah.

605
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:27,700
As discussed in the episode where teens,

606
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:31,820
you saw teenagers run up and like take kits of fog

607
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:33,220
straight out of the fog machine.

608
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:35,980
They suck the fog out of the fog machine, yes.

609
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:37,380
Teens sucking fog.

610
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:38,420
Yeah.

611
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:40,780
Blast in a big plume, you know?

612
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,140
What does that do to you, you think?

613
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:47,100
You think there's anything, you think it's like,

614
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:50,660
is it anything resembling like if you, you know,

615
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:52,580
huffed spray paint or something,

616
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:56,260
or is any of it like accidental and pure brain damage?

617
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:58,780
Or is it just zero, just zero happening?

618
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:02,100
I think a lot of things have a cumulative effect.

619
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:04,020
I think that's even like anything that you see

620
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:06,500
is like poison or you ingest something like,

621
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:09,340
I don't know that anything like completely makes you

622
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,820
like brain dead immediately.

623
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:13,900
But if you're sucking fog out for like a couple months,

624
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:16,220
then I think I would be concerned.

625
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:20,260
Is vape that much better than a fog machine?

626
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:21,820
I mean, fog is supposed to be non-toxic

627
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:23,260
because people are breathing it in.

628
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:25,420
You're not supposed to have a high concentration of it,

629
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:27,380
but I don't know.

630
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:30,900
It's at least like the idea is that you were meant to like

631
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:33,380
have it in your lungs and then not.

632
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:36,260
Although it's probably not good for you, I would imagine.

633
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:39,580
But yeah, I, you also, the brain cell count

634
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,460
is probably pretty low to begin with,

635
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:44,580
if it occurs to you to go suck some fog.

636
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:45,420
Yeah.

637
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:47,580
So where do you have to go from there?

638
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:49,100
That's a good point.

639
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:52,380
But look, maybe look, we've all been on stage,

640
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:54,300
we've all been sweating a little bit,

641
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:56,660
and we're all trying to impress and make people laugh.

642
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:59,540
And that's the same situation maybe with a Valencia teen.

643
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:02,100
He's got some like people around him.

644
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,220
He's trying to impress maybe some girl.

645
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:06,180
He's trying to impress and he goes, you know what?

646
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:07,420
Oh man, I got nothing.

647
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:08,820
These jokes haven't been hitting.

648
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:10,140
Oh, I know what I'll do.

649
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:12,620
I'll put my mouth around the fog machine,

650
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:15,660
suck it in and blow out a big plume.

651
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:18,180
This is gonna bring the night back for me.

652
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:20,860
You know, I think that might be what it is.

653
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:22,580
It's possible that you're positing

654
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,860
that this was a goof done once

655
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:28,340
and not a habit that formed.

656
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:31,700
The guy maybe didn't buy a fog machine.

657
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,540
He doesn't have one at home.

658
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:37,620
He's going broke, buying juice.

659
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:38,940
Well, if they're vaping,

660
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,900
I mean, they could also be at this point

661
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:44,540
because a lot of fog, usually there's a slight,

662
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:48,780
when we would use it in like high school theater and stuff,

663
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:51,100
there was a shared fog machine

664
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:53,700
between the middle school and high school

665
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,100
theater departments.

666
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:57,100
And I think it was pina colada flavor

667
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:59,500
to like cut down on the, you know,

668
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:02,260
to make it not unpleasant as it like, you know,

669
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:05,620
they usually use it too much in an auditorium.

670
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:10,660
So they could just be like used to flavored vapes and stuff,

671
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:14,260
although those are harder to get ahold of nowadays.

672
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:15,780
Yeah, so it's possible.

673
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:16,980
I mean, anything's possible.

674
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:19,380
I mean, yeah, is there gonna be a nationwide epidemic

675
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:22,500
of kids hooked on the juice, as they call it?

676
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:25,500
We haven't seen any evidence of it yet,

677
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:28,740
but I'm not ruling it out as far as what could come down

678
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:31,940
the pike next as far as problems for the world to deal with.

679
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:36,100
I have to think the popularity of vaping

680
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:39,580
is probably a new level of disgusting

681
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:41,300
for college dorm buildings.

682
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,460
Like college dorm buildings, famously,

683
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:46,700
don't smell good to begin with, usually.

684
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:50,100
If you're adding like wet candy store smell,

685
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:53,580
like, oh man, that's gonna be, that's fucked.

686
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:55,660
Yeah, no, that's no good.

687
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:56,500
Yeah.

688
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:59,300
So you saw, Scott, the fog machines were not on yet.

689
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,340
It was not Fright Fest.

690
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:02,300
Not on, I just saw one.

691
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:06,300
Yeah, and it's just like loose wire

692
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,860
just like plugged into some plug.

693
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:11,740
This is another big, like, I'm sort of looking

694
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:15,020
in the margins in my Six Flags experience,

695
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:17,540
especially because I'm not going on roller coasters,

696
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:18,980
the main reason that you go.

697
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:22,420
So my eye is drifting to a lot of stuff like this.

698
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:25,740
A lot of stuff like that, like just open outlets,

699
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:31,660
just like weird, like goo and filth kind of overflowing

700
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:33,780
on like pipes.

701
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:35,460
And one day I like,

702
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:38,460
there's that steampunk district around there

703
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:42,820
where there's a, we were going like,

704
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:45,660
the theming is a little light for them having announced

705
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:47,500
that this is a steampunk district.

706
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:51,340
And then we did see a big golden pipe situation.

707
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:52,740
And then I was like, okay, there you go.

708
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:53,620
There's something.

709
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:55,620
Wait a minute, I think this pipe was probably just there

710
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:57,940
undressed for many decades.

711
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:59,580
And then like, all right, throw some gold on it.

712
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:03,020
Now it's part of the, now it's a, now it's steampunk.

713
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:05,100
Yeah, I think that's right.

714
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:08,620
When you say goo, do you have any photos of sort of like goo

715
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:10,140
that's been surrounding pipes,

716
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:12,820
or was it just sort of every pipe had something?

717
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:14,660
There's one, I'll see, I'll pull up slowly

718
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:16,980
and see if it translates.

719
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:20,380
The one that I was the most aware of

720
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:24,580
was right at the top of the flume ride, which I did go on.

721
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:28,100
I went on the ride Jetstream, which I enjoyed very much.

722
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,380
It is a flume ride.

723
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:31,020
It is not a log flume.

724
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:33,460
It's kind of these sporty little,

725
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:35,660
they almost look like little boats.

726
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:38,340
And it almost reminds me of the Autopia a little bit.

727
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:40,860
It's just those like nice basic colors.

728
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:43,140
It's bright blue, bright red.

729
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:44,380
It's a sporty little ride.

730
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:47,140
We went on it twice in a row, had a really fun time.

731
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:50,420
It's also kind of like if you took a water slide

732
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:52,780
and just put a ride vehicle in it.

733
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:54,860
Like it doesn't feel merry.

734
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:58,020
It feels like an Olympic bobsled situation as well.

735
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:01,140
And you're just like clanging and clanging down the thing.

736
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:07,940
And it's like fun, but like unthemed pretty much.

737
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:12,860
And the danger element, it feels a little strong

738
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:15,380
because you're up at the top of the drop

739
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:19,100
and there's some wheel gear kind of mechanism

740
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:22,220
that's making something about the ride happen.

741
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:26,580
And there's just like thick black tar

742
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:28,180
smeared onto the thing.

743
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:30,420
Like absolutely I could touch it

744
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:32,660
and absolutely I could touch it

745
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:34,740
and get my fingers sucked into

746
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,860
whatever this gear mechanism is.

747
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:37,900
It's right there.

748
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:40,260
It's not even like if I reached a bit.

749
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:43,020
I don't have to extend my arm out all the way

750
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:45,540
to have my hands caked in tar

751
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:49,980
as if like a brick layer was slathering it down.

752
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:52,700
And my fingers could have been torn off very readily.

753
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:54,220
And the only person who might've said,

754
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:58,860
hey, don't do that was a really pissed off Valencia teen

755
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:02,540
under an umbrella staring at her phone the entire time.

756
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:05,660
Like did not look up at us for any reason.

757
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:08,500
It was again, my first experience with the Valencia teens

758
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,700
and I'm very charmed.

759
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:10,860
It was nice to meet them.

760
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:12,300
Yeah, I'm glad you did.

761
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:16,100
Yeah, so I mean, what's great about Six Flags

762
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:19,300
is we found so many things and we did not see the tar.

763
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:21,340
We actually didn't even go on that ride you're talking about

764
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:23,420
and I'll have to go on,

765
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:26,420
which is I think I might be going back soon.

766
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:30,460
But it sounds like your discovery with Six Flags

767
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:33,620
was there's a lot of different substances bubbling

768
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:38,220
and boiling and just hanging out, I guess,

769
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:39,420
all over the place.

770
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:41,020
Like a witch's brew.

771
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:43,140
And you've got a lot of time to observe them

772
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:45,580
because you're walking so much at that park.

773
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:48,460
There's a very spread out campus.

774
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:50,580
Extremely, I mean, anything can be,

775
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:53,380
but it reminded us a lot of the LA Zoo

776
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:57,900
in that you're doing like a big loop up into the hills

777
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:02,900
and with not really a good sense of direction

778
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:06,380
and walking through large areas that are pretty much unthemed,

779
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:08,700
they're pretty much just trees.

780
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:10,860
Yeah, I understood what you were saying in Fright Fest

781
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:13,100
for like the amount of steps you had by the end.

782
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:15,220
And like the, you don't really know,

783
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:17,500
not that you have to learn what Disneyland is

784
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:20,660
and why it's spokes of a wheel in Adventureland's here

785
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:22,020
and Frontierland's here.

786
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:23,300
Not that there's gonna be any weight in it,

787
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:25,260
but like there's nothing really indicating

788
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:30,260
why Ninja would be here and why Hot Rod Customs,

789
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:33,620
what is it, what's Ghost Racers?

790
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:35,260
Because also, like as we said before,

791
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:36,940
like, oh, we wanna go to the,

792
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:38,940
Anthony Gio and I wanna go to the Justice League

793
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:40,900
and we go, oh, that must be in the DC area.

794
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,900
It isn't, that's not where it is.

795
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:45,980
It's kind of adjacent.

796
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:47,820
It's not so far, but it's not.

797
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:49,540
Yeah, not so far.

798
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:52,700
Next to all the DC rides like you would assume it was.

799
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:53,540
Yeah, yeah, right.

800
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:56,020
So yeah, no, it's a little bit haphazard.

801
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:57,220
It's a bit haphazard.

802
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:00,460
Let me share my eye photos here and I'll show you the,

803
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:01,660
I don't know if it reads so much,

804
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:03,260
but here's just like a pipe thing

805
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:06,740
with a bunch of like just rusted out black.

806
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:11,180
Just black muck and leaves caked into it

807
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:12,860
and it's dripping.

808
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:16,700
The video might not read.

809
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:18,060
I'll just kind of step you through it

810
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:20,980
instead of playing it, but here's a video I took

811
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:23,500
that says we're outside a, this is a,

812
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:24,620
that black goo I just showed you

813
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:27,220
was next to a food establishment, first of all.

814
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:28,060
Okay.

815
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:29,940
And then when I walked up to the food establishment,

816
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:34,100
it says, try our new maxed out barbecue pulled pork

817
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,460
mac and cheese.

818
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:38,300
I might, I don't know how well you could see this.

819
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:42,580
Does that even read to you as pulled pork mac and cheese?

820
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:44,540
I would not know what it looks like.

821
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:49,380
That looks like two garlic knots next to pico de gallo.

822
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:52,260
It looks completely like a pile of pico de gallo,

823
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:54,180
maybe over some egg whites.

824
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:58,700
Like pico is the overwhelming topping,

825
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:00,500
the facet of this dish that you get.

826
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:03,820
I don't see pulled pork, I don't see mac and cheese.

827
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:06,500
What I do see when I go down below

828
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:10,860
is a bunch of bees surrounding the trash can

829
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:12,300
right under the sign.

830
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:15,100
Then I zoom over to a sign that says,

831
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:17,980
that's just a hand scrawled kind of poorly

832
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:20,340
and the sign says out of power raid.

833
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:24,100
The official drink of Valencia, California.

834
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:29,140
Which I went to my friend to make fun of the sign.

835
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:31,540
And I was about to say, hey, there's this funny sign.

836
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:34,340
And then I heard an annoyed girl next to me say,

837
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:37,100
damn, they're out of power raid.

838
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:38,940
Legit furious about it.

839
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:44,780
Then I walk over here to a barbecue

840
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:47,460
where you can just touch all the knobs

841
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:50,740
and reach your hand into it,

842
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:54,340
like open shelf and just pull out their dirty brush.

843
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:59,740
You could use the barbecue at Six Flags if you wanted.

844
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:01,580
You got to see the dirty brush.

845
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:04,100
I saw the famous Six Flags dirty brush.

846
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:07,660
And yeah, Mike, I think if you brought meats,

847
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:10,100
I don't think that they're really screening for like,

848
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:12,660
if you brought in just like kind of a Ziploc

849
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:15,660
of like marinated meats,

850
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:17,860
I think you probably could throw it on.

851
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:20,540
Again, hot enough there that it might just marinate itself.

852
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:22,220
You don't even need to turn on the gas,

853
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:24,220
but probably you could just turn on the gas

854
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:26,580
and you got a brush right there.

855
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:28,660
And I don't think anyone would catch you for,

856
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:32,140
if you did it all in like 20 minutes flat,

857
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:33,460
I think you're probably fine.

858
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:35,180
Oh man, Jason, we got to do this.

859
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:37,780
We have tickets.

860
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:40,060
We have to bring some meat into Six Flags

861
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:42,660
and cook ourselves meat on their grill.

862
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:45,460
Oh man.

863
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:47,980
See, that's normally a very appealing spot

864
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:48,860
when they're working it,

865
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:50,820
because it's like a good marketing trick.

866
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:51,580
Yeah, of course.

867
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:54,020
It's like the fajita effect they say at Chili's.

868
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:55,420
Like if people smell,

869
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:58,260
I can see smoked meats cooking.

870
00:35:58,260 --> 00:35:59,420
It draws them in,

871
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:01,660
but like there's nothing less appealing

872
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:04,540
than an empty, rusted, out, dirty grill.

873
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:05,900
Dusty barbecue.

874
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:07,220
Like you need that brush.

875
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:09,060
You got a lot of, you got to account,

876
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:10,420
in that 20 minutes I described,

877
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:12,020
like 10 minutes of it is cleaning.

878
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:16,940
If we smuggle a ribeye into Six Flags Magic Mountain

879
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:19,660
and cook the ribeye and then eat it,

880
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:20,780
how long does it take a ribeye to take?

881
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:21,620
Does that take too long?

882
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:23,980
I think you're, yeah, I think you're,

883
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:26,980
I think the most efficient would be some skirt steak,

884
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:29,580
like Samaria steak, skirt steak.

885
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:32,020
If you cut it real thin, that'll cook real quick.

886
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:34,020
Anything thicker than that.

887
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:36,980
Yeah, you don't want to cook a filet that's too thick.

888
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:38,500
I mean, even if you want it rare,

889
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,060
you still got to sear it a little.

890
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:42,140
Right, well, you know what I think we could probably

891
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:43,900
at least do hot dogs,

892
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:45,700
because hot dogs are already cooked.

893
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:48,660
So you could grab them kind of whenever.

894
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:50,420
You're just trying to get a sear on it.

895
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:53,540
We're just trying for the bit to be able to say

896
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:57,420
that we cooked hot dogs in an abandoned grill

897
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:59,060
in the middle of Six Flags.

898
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:01,980
I got to say, I also, I don't know,

899
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:03,900
this trend of pulled pork, mac and cheese.

900
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:06,700
I love both pulled pork and mac and cheese.

901
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:09,660
I don't see the appeal of just dumping one

902
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:10,940
on top of the other.

903
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:15,260
I guess easy to make in big quantities and shove in a bowl.

904
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:17,700
Did you have any of those tasting events?

905
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:20,220
I had two different types of macaroni and cheese,

906
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:23,060
one being, I think, pulled pork or some variety,

907
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:25,020
something like it.

908
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:26,260
And it was at the end of the night

909
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:29,100
when we had already, Natz is very nice and generous with us

910
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:32,180
and gave us each six items to have,

911
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:33,780
anything we wanted in the park.

912
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:35,020
So I, at the end of the night, was like,

913
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:36,740
oh God, I have two more left.

914
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:40,020
One bowl of regular mac and cheese

915
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:43,580
and one bowl of mac and cheese with pulled pork, please.

916
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:44,420
Wow.

917
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:46,820
And then like, yeah, like the sad eating.

918
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:48,060
I mean, it was actually good,

919
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:49,820
but it was like, just like trying to not waste.

920
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:50,820
That's because I loved it.

921
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:52,540
I really liked, I wanted,

922
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:54,820
I agree conceptually with what you're saying, Jason,

923
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:56,420
but oh my God, it was like,

924
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:58,820
I was like desiring it the next time I went back.

925
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:01,900
If it's, if it's the executions of both are good.

926
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:04,700
I also, Mike, I believe I was next to you

927
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:07,700
eating a plate of funnel cake and a fun bun.

928
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:09,900
Which is like a- You were not next to me.

929
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:14,820
You were within 25 feet of me eating a fun bun

930
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:17,300
and a funnel cake at the same time.

931
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:18,460
Well, they're shutting down the park.

932
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:19,420
We're closing it out.

933
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:21,420
We were trying to get, did you take it home?

934
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:22,860
Was it even possible to take that home?

935
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:25,220
I know I dumped it in the parking lot.

936
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:27,780
I was like eating it on the way out.

937
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:28,780
I think it, yeah.

938
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:31,940
I think at that point it was, yeah.

939
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:34,460
I was next to my car away from everyone.

940
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:36,900
I think outdoor masks were still in effect,

941
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,580
but like it was in the parking lot,

942
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:41,620
20 feet away from everyone saying good night,

943
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:44,060
eating a congealing funneled cake.

944
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:44,900
Yeah.

945
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:45,740
Good times.

946
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:46,580
Race against time.

947
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:47,420
Glory days.

948
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:51,780
So yeah, that odd restaurant encounter.

949
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:53,540
I also think you wouldn't get caught making food

950
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:55,860
because like we, towards the end of it,

951
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:58,420
we went and like, there was this little,

952
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:01,180
there's this theater that's where they do

953
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:03,780
a little Bugs Bunny like mascot shows

954
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:07,620
that's kind of enveloped in giant carrots.

955
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:08,940
I don't know what it's actually called.

956
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:10,860
We called it the Carrot Coliseum.

957
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:12,940
And the only thing stopping you from going in there

958
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:16,060
was a very thin, low chain.

959
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:16,900
And I just said,

960
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,500
you want to go sit in the carrot theater for a while?

961
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:19,780
I don't think anyone would stop us.

962
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:21,300
I didn't want to like do anything bad there.

963
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:23,500
I just wanted to see like what would happen.

964
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,220
And it was shaded there too.

965
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:27,980
So we just went and talked and had a sit

966
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:30,220
in the carrot theater and we're there for, you know,

967
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:32,900
10, 15 minutes and then got up.

968
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:34,500
And as soon as we got up,

969
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:38,260
then we're already like starting to walk away from it.

970
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:42,660
And then we hear a tinny distant voice say,

971
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:44,060
please do not turn the car there.

972
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:44,900
Thank you.

973
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:50,060
That was the only repercussion for this.

974
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:51,860
Was it a loud speaker?

975
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:54,620
A quiet speaker.

976
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:55,460
Okay.

977
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:56,300
I would say it was,

978
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:59,340
I had a test of our hearing that we even heard it.

979
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:00,180
I don't even know.

980
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:01,660
I don't know what the move was here.

981
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:02,580
Was it like,

982
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:05,340
was somebody operating a nearby teacup ride?

983
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:06,860
Like, all right, you have the nearest.

984
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:09,180
Can I just like jump on this thing for a sec?

985
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:11,460
Maybe these assholes will hear it.

986
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:13,540
It, we barely did.

987
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:14,380
I only like,

988
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:16,060
if I hadn't heard the word carrot,

989
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:17,460
I don't think it would have registered

990
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:19,580
as being directed at us.

991
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:24,060
So anyways, yeah, look,

992
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:25,980
having a good time, enjoyed Jetstream,

993
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:27,380
roaring rapids we went on.

994
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:29,220
We did a rapid ride, which is,

995
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:30,820
have you guys done the rapid ride there?

996
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:32,140
No, I have.

997
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:32,980
Yeah.

998
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:33,900
Jason's done it.

999
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:38,580
My feeling was, again, it's pretty unthemed,

1000
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:40,900
but you know, like Grizzly River Rapids.

1001
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:42,380
So this is part of the course.

1002
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:46,260
And it's, you know how most rapid rides,

1003
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:47,420
you kind of hit a point where like,

1004
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:48,860
all right, now we're cruising.

1005
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:49,820
Ooh, here we go.

1006
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:51,500
And we've been rolling for a while.

1007
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:53,260
This ride just felt to me like,

1008
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:54,420
all right, one rapid.

1009
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:57,140
Then you kind of like bump into something hard,

1010
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:58,300
get your bearings.

1011
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:00,740
All right, number two and three

1012
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:03,980
is a very like stop and start kind of,

1013
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:05,980
like there was never just like,

1014
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:07,020
all right, here's the run.

1015
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:09,100
Now it's, now we're like,

1016
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:11,300
now we're really cruising down this river.

1017
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:12,900
Yeah, now we're feeling free.

1018
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:15,380
Yeah.

1019
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:17,900
So also I got like,

1020
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:19,220
drained, like only me.

1021
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:21,060
Like some, you feel like with Disney,

1022
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:22,780
there's like controls kind of like,

1023
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:24,100
there's all right, we can design this

1024
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:27,740
to where kind of everybody gets it equally.

1025
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:29,900
This was like entirely me,

1026
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:32,580
which I was a little better about.

1027
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:35,820
But anyways, it's like,

1028
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:38,580
it's a pretty fun day even though we're noticing

1029
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:40,580
the stuff in the margins.

1030
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:41,420
Yes.

1031
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:43,060
Yes, yes.

1032
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:44,860
If we can overlook the goose,

1033
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:47,580
we're having a pretty good time.

1034
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:49,300
Then we're like, all right, well,

1035
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:53,020
I think now it's time to make it to Justice League.

1036
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:54,820
You know, if this thing is a little hokey,

1037
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:56,340
I think a beer would be great.

1038
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:57,980
And maybe a beer will give me the bravery

1039
00:41:57,980 --> 00:41:59,700
ultimately to do Batman the ride,

1040
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:02,660
which is the one I was kind of hoping to conquer.

1041
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:04,180
We get in a beer line,

1042
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:08,980
just like the longest and not moving remotely.

1043
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:10,980
We can tell that's gonna be 45 minutes.

1044
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:13,900
There's one bartender, he is moving as slow

1045
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:15,900
as I've ever seen a human being move.

1046
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:19,940
Just like each step takes a full 40 seconds.

1047
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:23,740
And so, all right, well, screw this.

1048
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:24,740
Let's see if we can find somewhere else.

1049
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:26,420
We keep looking up, but we cannot find

1050
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:29,580
anywhere else to get alcoholic beverage anywhere else.

1051
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:31,580
Now we're just wandering, trying to figure it out.

1052
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:34,900
We had that full throttle bar, Mike, that you referenced.

1053
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:36,980
I think we were over there.

1054
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:38,100
That's closed though.

1055
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:39,340
So much of the park is closed.

1056
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:41,460
It's very, like a lot of it's closed.

1057
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:44,500
Desolation is what the phrase that kept occurring

1058
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:46,860
to us in various points of the journey.

1059
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:48,220
So like, all right, you know what?

1060
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:49,660
Screw this, screw the beer thing.

1061
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:54,140
Let's go find Hall of Justice and just do the ride normally.

1062
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:55,820
That'll be fine.

1063
00:42:55,820 --> 00:43:00,220
So we walk up to the Hall of Justice.

1064
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:02,620
And the first thing that we notice

1065
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:05,220
is the sign that says closed.

1066
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:06,340
The ride was closed.

1067
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:07,380
Oh yeah.

1068
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:13,260
The reason for both of us going on a non-coaster visit.

1069
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:14,460
And by then I'd announced,

1070
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:17,740
let's do, we're gonna do a podcast about it too.

1071
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:19,900
Closed, not happening, closed refurbishment.

1072
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:24,900
So, like, huh, shit.

1073
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:28,500
We go into the nearby Justice League store,

1074
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:29,660
which is not closed.

1075
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:32,660
And we wonder if those teens can fill us in

1076
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:33,580
on anything that's going on.

1077
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:35,940
Maybe it's just for the day, I'm not sure.

1078
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:39,140
We go ask them what's going on with Justice League ride

1079
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:41,060
and their responses.

1080
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:42,180
I don't know.

1081
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:45,980
It's been closed for like three days.

1082
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:50,300
Yeah, I don't know what's wrong with it.

1083
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:51,740
Okay, bye.

1084
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:54,380
Then later in the day,

1085
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:57,380
we make our way over to the guest services,

1086
00:43:57,380 --> 00:43:58,220
which is at the front.

1087
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:00,300
And apparently this is the only way you could have known

1088
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:01,300
that the ride was closed,

1089
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:05,060
is a very little sign inside this guest services building.

1090
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:06,660
It was there, that's closed.

1091
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:07,860
Tatsu is closed.

1092
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:10,900
Those are two pretty big heavy hitters to lose

1093
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:12,020
for no apparent reason.

1094
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:14,340
But I looked online and when I looked online,

1095
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:17,260
I learned that Magic Mountain does not have a part

1096
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:19,780
of the site that tells you if things are closed.

1097
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:20,940
This does not exist for them.

1098
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:24,940
Yeah, I was up there once a couple years ago,

1099
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:29,580
early in the day, and it was like 11 a.m.

1100
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:33,980
and I'm like, oh man, a lot of stuff is closed.

1101
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:39,220
I saw more people with hoses just hosing sidewalks down

1102
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:42,940
that I saw big rides operating.

1103
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:45,060
And I'm like, it's almost noon.

1104
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:45,980
What is going on?

1105
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:48,220
And eventually I was walking,

1106
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:49,660
later on when I was walking to my car,

1107
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:52,060
I saw more stuff running.

1108
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:53,620
Well, it's just a bunch of,

1109
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:54,860
you know, one of those days

1110
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:58,260
where half the ride operators were late to work.

1111
00:44:58,260 --> 00:44:59,980
Yeah, and when I was there,

1112
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:02,380
everyone was wearing helpful Honda days,

1113
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:04,700
a marketing promotion in Southern California.

1114
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:07,500
Everyone was wearing Polos that said, help Honda days.

1115
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:11,700
And I was like, I don't know how helpful this is.

1116
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:14,980
Well, granted, there had just been an earthquake

1117
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:17,860
a few days prior and I did read that they had to check

1118
00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:21,300
some of the structural integrity for a day or two,

1119
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:24,180
but it still seemed like a lot

1120
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:26,940
and yet no signage about what was going on.

1121
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:27,780
Sure.

1122
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:31,620
Yeah, well, yeah, I mean, maybe it was something,

1123
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:33,580
maybe there was something at that earthquake level

1124
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:35,100
that caused Justice League to be closed

1125
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:38,980
or it was that Jessica didn't come in that day.

1126
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:40,820
She's got the keys to the ride.

1127
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:42,140
She has the key.

1128
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:44,740
Lex Luthor's secret weapon, Jessica.

1129
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:49,260
Jessica has spoils.

1130
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:54,260
I don't care for your approach to a maniacal crime,

1131
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:59,420
Joker and Harley Quinn, nor your tardiness, Jessica,

1132
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:02,620
but you'll help distract the Justice League.

1133
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:07,580
In this case, your lack of attention to your work

1134
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:10,900
proved a boon for my.

1135
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:14,380
This is going to reflect poorly on our corporate sponsors

1136
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:18,140
at Honda Southern California Honda dealers.

1137
00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:21,140
No, Honda is very helpful because they, you know,

1138
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:24,340
we said there's a lot of walking around Six Flags,

1139
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:26,740
but they do provide the helpful Honda Tram,

1140
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:31,220
which is an angels flight type vehicle that takes you up,

1141
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:33,260
you know, one of the steeper

1142
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:35,020
to the woods to walk it.

1143
00:46:35,020 --> 00:46:35,860
So that's great.

1144
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:38,500
Also closed, closed, not even didn't even register

1145
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:39,980
on the closed sign.

1146
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:42,500
That is how much nobody cares if the helpful Honda thing

1147
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:44,500
is open or closed.

1148
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:48,300
There is also when we went on Ninja, Ninja's weird.

1149
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:52,140
There's like a lift hill at the beginning to get you going on it

1150
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:55,900
and then a lift hill at the end to get you back to the station.

1151
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:58,340
Not a lift hill to take you to more ride or more fun.

1152
00:46:58,340 --> 00:47:00,340
It is a we are done lift hill.

1153
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:04,780
And when you're on that, you go past like what looks completely

1154
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:07,660
like an empty tram station.

1155
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:09,660
Like, was this a train or was there even like a

1156
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:12,500
carousel in here? I'm not sure.

1157
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:15,260
And then you're down on the ground and it's completely visible.

1158
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:17,260
You can walk right up to the fence of it.

1159
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:18,300
You just can't go in it.

1160
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:22,140
So like this, like, you know, what used to be a train station or something.

1161
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:23,660
I looked it up.

1162
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:27,620
What is now the Ninja loading station was once the top station

1163
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:30,460
for a similar thing, an angels flight type.

1164
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:31,980
I forget the term.

1165
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:34,140
A funicular. A funicular. That's right. Yeah.

1166
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:36,180
Cool word.

1167
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:40,620
It but a similar thing like so the Ninja station became

1168
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:43,340
that I was a train station, became the ninja station.

1169
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:47,420
The bottom one has been closed since 1981.

1170
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:51,900
Just in the park, unlabeled.

1171
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:53,660
You could see it on a ride.

1172
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:55,820
You could see it if you walk up to it.

1173
00:47:55,820 --> 00:47:58,460
Forty years of closure.

1174
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:02,220
And the park has only been open since 1971.

1175
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:07,540
So for 80 percent of the existence of Magic Mountain, which we it's changed

1176
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:11,620
ownerships, but the one thing that has never changed is this one train station

1177
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:14,580
that they've never they would even like turn it into a picnic area.

1178
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:15,740
Just nothing.

1179
00:48:15,740 --> 00:48:19,220
How about the observation tower sort of thing?

1180
00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:21,220
Were you able to get in that?

1181
00:48:21,220 --> 00:48:22,140
Didn't try that.

1182
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:26,140
That doesn't sound great in COVID times in terms of like that's true.

1183
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:27,180
So I'm not sure.

1184
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:30,620
And I don't I don't know if it was if it was running detail.

1185
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:31,300
I forgot earlier.

1186
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:35,140
So we go up to the guest service counter and just with no particular plan.

1187
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:38,020
We're just like, well, if we kind of like let's just see if they can tell us

1188
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:40,780
what's going on with Justice League and will it be open anytime soon?

1189
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:44,300
Or would they even give us something a little nice to make it up to us?

1190
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:46,220
Or reason for our visit?

1191
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:50,780
And we go in there and it is two girls on their phones who do not look up at us.

1192
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:53,700
We say out loud, oh, so what's going on with Justice League?

1193
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:55,980
Justice League, Justice League's closed.

1194
00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:58,140
And they just go like, yeah.

1195
00:48:58,580 --> 00:49:01,980
Glare until we leave, which we do.

1196
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:05,100
Jessica's most devious henchwoman.

1197
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:09,740
They must be in cahoots.

1198
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:11,260
The they don't.

1199
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:14,860
They have that secret power is not giving a shit at all.

1200
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:19,860
This fog is powerful, but

1201
00:49:19,860 --> 00:49:24,300
weed smoke makes you impenetrable to caring about anything. Yes.

1202
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:31,220
So, yeah, just it was a mean guest service and an inexplicably closed ride.

1203
00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:34,860
And with that, I kick it to you guys because I haven't been on this ride.

1204
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:36,980
Oh, man. All right.

1205
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:41,020
And it occurred to me like, well, like there's a part of me that's,

1206
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:43,820
you know, like, well, this this ruins the episode.

1207
00:49:43,820 --> 00:49:47,140
Now we cannot possibly do that just as we're going to have to reschedule.

1208
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:48,580
I'm going to have to come back.

1209
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:49,780
And then I think two things.

1210
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:52,220
What? No, that's pretty par for the Six Flags course.

1211
00:49:52,220 --> 00:49:53,500
Probably. I think we leave it in.

1212
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:55,500
I think that's my report is that it was closed.

1213
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:58,940
The other thing that occurs to me is I don't want to come back to Magic Mountain.

1214
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:05,820
And we both drove out of here just like just drained it really like.

1215
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:09,340
And again, I'll we'll move it over to the ride.

1216
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:11,980
But just the other thing, this is where it really hit us, is that like, OK,

1217
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:15,220
well, that's closed and we can't find a beer that isn't a hassle.

1218
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:16,740
So now we're just walking around.

1219
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:18,420
We'll rock around this store.

1220
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:20,340
That's called like the Looney Tunes

1221
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:23,820
superstore. I don't know.

1222
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:25,820
But it is like

1223
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:29,900
it is so sunfaded and the pain is cracking off of the thing.

1224
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:35,740
There's a sign that is so sun bleached that Bugs Bunny is only eyes and a mouth.

1225
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:37,980
Like every other. He was gray.

1226
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:40,260
He was like close to tipping

1227
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:41,580
like the billboard of Dr.

1228
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:43,980
T.J. Ecclesburg from the Great Gatsby.

1229
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:46,340
That's God. That's an allegory for God.

1230
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:50,020
He's watching the sins of man occur in Valencia.

1231
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:52,460
Oh, man. Now the watchful eyes of.

1232
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:54,860
But did you see Mrs. Taz anywhere, Scott?

1233
00:50:55,340 --> 00:50:57,140
Oh, yeah. Wait, I got I got a big.

1234
00:50:57,140 --> 00:51:00,300
Yeah, because Mrs. Taz is right at the right at the entrance.

1235
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:03,220
I got a I got a lovely picture of Mrs. Taz

1236
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:05,940
through some glass.

1237
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:06,980
Oh, yeah. There she is.

1238
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:09,020
Oh, man. Yeah. Yeah.

1239
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:10,140
She's great. I love her.

1240
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:11,740
She's right at the cross side.

1241
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:14,420
A little the mouth kind of lean in one way, a big red lipstick.

1242
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:16,060
Loved that.

1243
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:20,220
But just this store like, you know, we looked up on the

1244
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:23,620
like there's there's big like pillars or something that are supposed

1245
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:27,500
to look like palm trees and there's just like white tape all over them.

1246
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:33,540
And then there's a weird statue of the loony tunes.

1247
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:35,900
And it looks like two things here.

1248
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:39,260
It looks to me like Foghorn Leghorn is trying to strangle you.

1249
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:44,220
He's like walking up like he's part zombified, like must grab neck.

1250
00:51:44,540 --> 00:51:46,500
Also looks like

1251
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:52,020
the Elmer Fudd is about to shoot like execute Tweety Bird in the back of his head.

1252
00:51:52,660 --> 00:51:55,380
It's like grab Tweety by the scruff. Yeah.

1253
00:51:56,540 --> 00:51:58,420
That's right. You'll forget it.

1254
00:51:58,420 --> 00:52:00,100
It won't be painful this way.

1255
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:02,260
That's right, Lenny. That's right. The rabbits.

1256
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:05,060
You know, Pat the rabbit.

1257
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:08,860
And then there's a there's a

1258
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:12,500
Daffy Duck with just like a big like iron.

1259
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:13,620
What do you even call it?

1260
00:52:13,620 --> 00:52:16,980
It's just like a big iron chain around his scratch.

1261
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:22,260
And it's not an ankle bracelet, but it's like a sobriety ankle bracelet.

1262
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:26,780
I know. But he is just like tethered to the ground with metal.

1263
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:31,220
And Daffy Duck has been entrapped by the one of the mischievous,

1264
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:35,780
mischievous, devious traps of Jigsaw, the famous killer.

1265
00:52:36,860 --> 00:52:40,940
You know, if they tighten it, the half of his foot would just come clean off.

1266
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:46,900
Around this time, we were saying how this store

1267
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:52,180
and a lot of parts of the park, it's like a any any target,

1268
00:52:52,180 --> 00:52:56,420
any target that you can go to is nicer, cleaner.

1269
00:52:56,540 --> 00:53:00,980
I trust the food more, the better themed.

1270
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:04,460
I would say we like we carpal, we parked close to there

1271
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:09,100
in a little boring strip mall with a Marshalls and a Ross and a five below.

1272
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:12,540
And we were like that strip mall was like a better

1273
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:17,900
themed experience than six foot, like almost any low any your mall.

1274
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:23,060
You the listener, your mall, I think is nicer and cleaner than it's like some

1275
00:53:23,180 --> 00:53:26,100
this thing that people travel to and through,

1276
00:53:27,260 --> 00:53:32,460
you know, daily, but by the thousands is like worse than any Marshalls.

1277
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:34,580
I truly do believe this.

1278
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:39,620
Well, Anthony Geo coined a phrase that I think a lot of the listeners know.

1279
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:43,700
And I think Scott might have to amend his version of the phrase

1280
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:47,780
because of course, Anthony's phrase was six flags sucks and I love it.

1281
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:50,660
And I have to agree

1282
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:54,980
because it does seem what you're saying, like there was just like loose tape

1283
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:58,820
on and what was that even I was looking at, like a piece of green, like

1284
00:53:58,820 --> 00:54:01,460
seem like an indoor palm tree, very like,

1285
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:07,660
eerie fluorescent room that had signs that say Tasmanian Devil above nothing

1286
00:54:07,660 --> 00:54:09,300
but DC capes.

1287
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:11,780
Yeah. And I don't think and I was trying to analyze this to him.

1288
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:13,620
Like, are we being elitist by this?

1289
00:54:13,620 --> 00:54:16,140
And it's like Six Flags is like the third major.

1290
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:18,820
I mean, what is Cedar Fair bigger than Six Flags?

1291
00:54:18,820 --> 00:54:22,420
Like this isn't like a local park we're clowning on because we think they're

1292
00:54:22,420 --> 00:54:24,860
like the budget for the ride is bad.

1293
00:54:26,060 --> 00:54:29,220
Yeah. Yeah, we're not going like Kenobi Lake.

1294
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:30,860
You're in our crosshairs.

1295
00:54:30,860 --> 00:54:32,300
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1296
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:33,900
She shouldn't have even tried.

1297
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:35,420
Yeah. Yeah.

1298
00:54:35,420 --> 00:54:39,620
We're charmed by places we're charmed, I think, by lower budgets often.

1299
00:54:39,620 --> 00:54:41,340
But what is really the excuse?

1300
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:44,460
Is it a lower budget or into this?

1301
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:47,580
We have to look into this and really figure out if like they're truly like

1302
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:50,300
hurting for money or just management for so long.

1303
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:54,580
It's just been so badly managed that are you saying that the Time Warner

1304
00:54:54,580 --> 00:54:57,780
Company might not be good at attention to detail?

1305
00:54:57,780 --> 00:55:00,020
The people who launched HBO Max,

1306
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:05,220
it took six extra months to get it onto Roku, the most popular streaming

1307
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:07,740
service device in the country.

1308
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:10,140
Is it time? Isn't it not Time Warner anymore?

1309
00:55:10,780 --> 00:55:13,820
Well, that discovery merger still has to get approved.

1310
00:55:13,860 --> 00:55:15,700
No, I'm saying doesn't six six time.

1311
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:17,780
Warner doesn't own Six Flags anymore, right?

1312
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:19,660
Isn't it? I'm not sure.

1313
00:55:19,660 --> 00:55:22,380
Did it change? It's changed hands so many times.

1314
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:26,420
I think it's I think it has changed hands somewhat, or I may just be very confused

1315
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:28,820
because it changes hands every few months, I feel like.

1316
00:55:29,820 --> 00:55:33,220
OK, so I was looking this up and Six Flags is not owned by Time Warner.

1317
00:55:33,220 --> 00:55:35,500
Time Warner sold it in 1998.

1318
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:38,500
Oh, and they've changed the name.

1319
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:39,940
It was bought.

1320
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:42,060
The company was later rebranded Premier.

1321
00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:43,660
It was Premier Parks.

1322
00:55:43,660 --> 00:55:45,460
So Premier Parks bought it.

1323
00:55:45,460 --> 00:55:48,740
But then they've changed their name, their name to Six Flags.

1324
00:55:48,740 --> 00:55:52,860
And then they filed for bankruptcy in 2010, it looks like.

1325
00:55:53,060 --> 00:55:55,060
Or to the Snyder era.

1326
00:55:55,100 --> 00:55:57,140
Yeah, we know where they were having trouble then.

1327
00:55:57,140 --> 00:56:00,540
So, yeah, if you want to listen back, we did a Patreon exclusive episode

1328
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:04,500
about the time when Six Flags decided to start their own business

1329
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:06,900
where they cut kids hair in the mall.

1330
00:56:07,060 --> 00:56:08,060
And that's not a joke.

1331
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:09,580
That's real.

1332
00:56:09,580 --> 00:56:11,620
And go to our Patreon to listen to that.

1333
00:56:12,460 --> 00:56:16,580
You just said you were just reading in a very dry manner how like,

1334
00:56:16,580 --> 00:56:19,540
oh, and then there was kind of disagreements about the direction of the company,

1335
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:23,140
which now that looks very boring on paper. Right.

1336
00:56:24,140 --> 00:56:26,980
Disagreement was some people think they should focus on roller coasters.

1337
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:29,540
Others thought they should focus on giving children

1338
00:56:29,540 --> 00:56:33,380
haircuts while they watch videos of roller coasters.

1339
00:56:33,380 --> 00:56:34,380
That's right.

1340
00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:37,660
These flags is what's so you think it's Premier Parks.

1341
00:56:37,820 --> 00:56:39,660
Nobody wants to admit they own it.

1342
00:56:39,660 --> 00:56:40,580
It's Premier Parks.

1343
00:56:40,580 --> 00:56:43,700
And there was almost a merger with Cedar Point.

1344
00:56:44,020 --> 00:56:45,700
There was that with Cedar Fair.

1345
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:47,060
Excuse me. Yeah. Yeah.

1346
00:56:47,060 --> 00:56:50,820
And so they've yeah, they've re Premier has rebranded to call themselves

1347
00:56:50,860 --> 00:56:53,460
like Six Flags Inc. or something or six whatever.

1348
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:57,180
Well, we should do a real deep dive on this because I bet there's a lot of fascinating

1349
00:56:57,180 --> 00:57:00,420
stuff here. But by and large, what my point was just like,

1350
00:57:00,580 --> 00:57:03,380
they have the money to take the tape off of things.

1351
00:57:03,380 --> 00:57:07,060
Like, I'm just saying, like, we're not being like, Stoody, like, oh, we wouldn't.

1352
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:10,820
We don't like a ride unless it has a budget of over 50 million.

1353
00:57:10,940 --> 00:57:11,820
Like, we're not like that.

1354
00:57:11,820 --> 00:57:13,140
Yes. A charm.

1355
00:57:13,140 --> 00:57:16,540
Oh, like, here's a here's a funny janky ride with like,

1356
00:57:16,860 --> 00:57:20,420
you know, like an odd little skeleton puppet or whatever.

1357
00:57:20,420 --> 00:57:21,620
We're probably going to like that.

1358
00:57:21,620 --> 00:57:25,380
We're probably going to be charmed by the, you know, as evidenced by nots,

1359
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:28,060
like nots is, you know, it certainly has a lot of money, but there's like,

1360
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:30,860
there's just the spirit there.

1361
00:57:30,860 --> 00:57:33,540
Here you just have like,

1362
00:57:33,540 --> 00:57:37,980
you know, like you if you want to be an ultimate, like spend all the most money

1363
00:57:37,980 --> 00:57:42,340
you can within the Six Flags organization, you can be a diamond elite member.

1364
00:57:42,580 --> 00:57:46,660
There's nothing to me like seeing the word diamond in pixelated.

1365
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:49,620
Like it's in low res.

1366
00:57:49,620 --> 00:57:51,940
This was printed out huge.

1367
00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:55,260
Like it looks like this is what I don't understand.

1368
00:57:55,260 --> 00:57:59,060
Like we charmingly cheap attractions.

1369
00:57:59,060 --> 00:58:01,340
So this has been here since the 40s and it's never changed.

1370
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:02,140
That's one thing.

1371
00:58:02,140 --> 00:58:07,220
A sign that they printed a year ago that with where they just didn't

1372
00:58:07,220 --> 00:58:11,020
like do it right, it can't goes that I that I don't get.

1373
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:12,940
I don't know. There's no charm to it.

1374
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:15,540
I'm confused. I don't know why it has to be that way.

1375
00:58:15,540 --> 00:58:18,060
And also the pizza in this photo looks horrible.

1376
00:58:19,460 --> 00:58:23,580
Yeah, it's this is a whole first of all, when you showed us that first picture,

1377
00:58:23,580 --> 00:58:27,780
it looks like like that, like when you get handed like cards for escorts

1378
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:32,660
on the sunset or on the strip and those cards around in your face,

1379
00:58:32,660 --> 00:58:35,580
you're like, I don't please know.

1380
00:58:35,580 --> 00:58:39,020
But yeah, I don't there's.

1381
00:58:39,020 --> 00:58:41,580
Yeah, this this is a diamond elite tonight.

1382
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:44,060
This could be a diamond elite member.

1383
00:58:44,060 --> 00:58:45,180
You'd be a diamond elite.

1384
00:58:45,180 --> 00:58:47,380
Hey, you guys, hey, you guys want to be a diamond elite?

1385
00:58:47,380 --> 00:58:48,460
You guys want to be a diamond elite?

1386
00:58:48,460 --> 00:58:51,420
I have a limo waiting for you over here if you want to be a diamond elite.

1387
00:58:53,260 --> 00:58:55,420
This diamond elite, by the way, is this where you get to you

1388
00:58:55,420 --> 00:58:58,180
at like a free three course meal every day?

1389
00:58:58,180 --> 00:59:00,100
If you get it, I'm reading it now.

1390
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:02,580
Well, no, you got to add on member dining.

1391
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:03,780
I sorry. And I was confused.

1392
00:59:03,780 --> 00:59:06,100
You still have to. Oh, my God.

1393
00:59:06,100 --> 00:59:10,540
But you can get I think it's you can get 50 percent off if you are diamond elite.

1394
00:59:10,620 --> 00:59:12,540
I think it's like I think it's like 80 bucks.

1395
00:59:12,540 --> 00:59:15,020
I think one year we should do it or at least Jason should do it.

1396
00:59:15,020 --> 00:59:18,420
And see like Jason just drives up to Valencia to get all of his meals for a year.

1397
00:59:18,420 --> 00:59:21,860
Just eat like, yeah, he'd a list of Syria burger.

1398
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:25,100
That's your kitchen now.

1399
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:28,980
Look at the 50 percent savings on too many spaces.

1400
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:32,220
Almost everything in the park and in the middle of the word,

1401
00:59:32,220 --> 00:59:36,500
everything is just like a screw right in the word.

1402
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:39,980
I like that. This is what I don't.

1403
00:59:39,980 --> 00:59:41,100
This is what I don't get.

1404
00:59:41,100 --> 00:59:44,860
And it makes me all just a segue to the ride.

1405
00:59:44,860 --> 00:59:48,460
It makes me I was I having done half of my day

1406
00:59:49,140 --> 00:59:51,740
and by that, I mean an hour and a half of my three hour day.

1407
00:59:52,060 --> 00:59:56,620
I was wondering, like, OK, so how did they how would be this level of detail?

1408
00:59:56,740 --> 00:59:59,060
How does this place pull off a dark?

1409
00:59:59,180 --> 01:00:02,660
How do they pull off their attempt at a Buzz Lightyear's astro blasters

1410
01:00:02,660 --> 01:00:04,260
or a Spider-Man?

1411
01:00:04,260 --> 01:00:06,740
Honestly, like that's kind of what they're trying to do.

1412
01:00:07,620 --> 01:00:11,660
How does this organization that has screws in the middle of pixelated words

1413
01:00:11,660 --> 01:00:13,980
and black tar blowing from everything?

1414
01:00:14,460 --> 01:00:16,220
What how how is this right?

1415
01:00:16,220 --> 01:00:17,860
And I have to leave it to you guys to tell me.

1416
01:00:17,860 --> 01:00:22,540
Well, of course, my experience with the ride is that the the Valencia team

1417
01:00:22,540 --> 01:00:25,580
who was working there didn't give me the three glasses.

1418
01:00:25,780 --> 01:00:29,540
So I rode the ride not getting to experience the three D,

1419
01:00:29,540 --> 01:00:31,060
which I thought was good for this.

1420
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:32,980
Jason is the only one who's actually read

1421
01:00:32,980 --> 01:00:35,980
ridden the ride in the correct manner in the correct way.

1422
01:00:35,980 --> 01:00:42,140
Yeah, I think I've written it twice and didn't really have any trouble.

1423
01:00:42,620 --> 01:00:45,500
They went as it was supposed to, you know.

1424
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:47,180
You are Mr. Lucky Guy.

1425
01:00:47,180 --> 01:00:49,220
I'm Mr. Lucky Guy.

1426
01:00:49,220 --> 01:00:51,620
Yeah, I got to see

1427
01:00:53,420 --> 01:00:56,820
all my favorite characters rendered in CG animation.

1428
01:00:58,180 --> 01:01:00,180
Yeah, I did get to hear.

1429
01:01:00,180 --> 01:01:04,820
I so one thing I'll say about this ride, I think it's elevated

1430
01:01:05,980 --> 01:01:11,780
by over some of the Batman attractions we did by the sheer presence

1431
01:01:12,140 --> 01:01:16,620
of the voice of Kevin Conroy,

1432
01:01:17,900 --> 01:01:21,100
the voice of Batman and the Batman animated series

1433
01:01:21,100 --> 01:01:23,780
and a number of video games and other attractions.

1434
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:27,380
He's on some of those rides we were we were watching, I think.

1435
01:01:27,620 --> 01:01:28,740
Yeah, he is.

1436
01:01:28,740 --> 01:01:30,700
But then some of them are a little more generic.

1437
01:01:30,700 --> 01:01:32,780
The Joker is not Mark Hamill.

1438
01:01:32,780 --> 01:01:34,060
I looked that up. Right.

1439
01:01:34,060 --> 01:01:36,860
It sounds like Mark Hamill, but it's a guy style.

1440
01:01:37,180 --> 01:01:38,460
It's that style.

1441
01:01:38,460 --> 01:01:42,220
It's a guy named I think it's Troy Baker.

1442
01:01:42,220 --> 01:01:44,540
I have it here in my note somewhere.

1443
01:01:45,620 --> 01:01:46,780
Yeah, Troy Baker.

1444
01:01:46,780 --> 01:01:49,500
And he he's done the Joker's voice on some,

1445
01:01:50,220 --> 01:01:52,340
you know, direct to video, direct to streaming movies.

1446
01:01:52,540 --> 01:01:54,660
And I think he does a pretty good job.

1447
01:01:54,660 --> 01:01:56,980
Yes, I agree. I mean, it's a pretty good Joker.

1448
01:01:57,660 --> 01:02:00,340
The actual execution of this ride, there's little things

1449
01:02:00,340 --> 01:02:02,300
I can tease them about here and there.

1450
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:06,460
But I think overall, I do like it.

1451
01:02:06,460 --> 01:02:10,660
Overall, I think it's and it's probably because the contract,

1452
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:14,300
like the companies that they hired to do this, Sally Corporation

1453
01:02:14,660 --> 01:02:19,220
and Oceaneering Entertainment Systems, like have done a lot of theme park work.

1454
01:02:19,260 --> 01:02:22,260
Like these are not like new companies.

1455
01:02:22,940 --> 01:02:28,060
Oceaneering Entertainment Systems are the ones who saved the Jaws ride.

1456
01:02:28,060 --> 01:02:31,860
They were the second group to work on the Jaws ride in Orlando.

1457
01:02:31,900 --> 01:02:34,220
Like after all the troubles they had, it opened.

1458
01:02:34,380 --> 01:02:37,260
Right. Because they dealt with underwater mechanics.

1459
01:02:37,340 --> 01:02:39,580
Right. Not theme park rides initially.

1460
01:02:39,580 --> 01:02:42,740
And now they've then they made the shift into having a theme park division.

1461
01:02:42,940 --> 01:02:44,060
Yeah. Yeah.

1462
01:02:44,060 --> 01:02:46,180
Well, also, let me say just to praise it,

1463
01:02:46,540 --> 01:02:49,620
that just the mere fact that it is the Hall of Justice,

1464
01:02:49,620 --> 01:02:53,620
the famous Super Friends base for the Justice League,

1465
01:02:53,940 --> 01:02:56,420
which now that I'm saying this, Jason, help me out here is the super

1466
01:02:56,540 --> 01:03:00,300
is the Hall of Justice is its first appearance in Super Friends,

1467
01:03:00,300 --> 01:03:02,860
the like kind of cheesy cartoon from the 70s.

1468
01:03:03,260 --> 01:03:04,980
Oh, that's a good question.

1469
01:03:04,980 --> 01:03:05,900
I actually guess I said that.

1470
01:03:05,900 --> 01:03:07,260
I don't know.

1471
01:03:07,260 --> 01:03:10,140
They've had a number of different headquarters.

1472
01:03:10,180 --> 01:03:12,460
They had a satellite based one.

1473
01:03:12,460 --> 01:03:14,740
They had a mountain in the 90s.

1474
01:03:14,740 --> 01:03:17,980
You know, I love the Grant Morrison Watchtower

1475
01:03:18,020 --> 01:03:20,340
Justice League base that was on the moon.

1476
01:03:20,340 --> 01:03:22,820
Yeah, there. Yeah, there's one on the moon.

1477
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:27,740
They were international in the early 90s, so they had like embassies.

1478
01:03:28,220 --> 01:03:29,580
So they were all over the place.

1479
01:03:29,580 --> 01:03:31,300
I'll look that up. First appearance of Hall of Justice.

1480
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:34,220
So just the mere fact that they have recreated something

1481
01:03:34,220 --> 01:03:38,580
that's pretty iconic, if you if you know about this stuff is awesome,

1482
01:03:38,700 --> 01:03:41,500
because that's like, again, next level six flags.

1483
01:03:41,860 --> 01:03:45,780
It's not like there's any like kind of iconic Looney Tunes style building.

1484
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:48,180
And as I say that, maybe I'm wrong in any of the parks.

1485
01:03:48,180 --> 01:03:51,180
The Carrot Coliseum, which I guess the Carrot Coliseum.

1486
01:03:51,660 --> 01:03:53,740
But I mean, these rusty cages, they do.

1487
01:03:53,740 --> 01:03:55,420
I guess there's not like a famous cliff

1488
01:03:55,420 --> 01:03:58,060
they could show you from like Wiley Coyote and Roadrunner.

1489
01:03:58,900 --> 01:04:00,580
Different cliffs. Yeah.

1490
01:04:00,580 --> 01:04:03,660
But yeah, so so just getting to be by the thing,

1491
01:04:03,660 --> 01:04:07,540
by the Hall of Justice is pretty awesome, because again, as much as we as there

1492
01:04:07,540 --> 01:04:11,580
was more Marvel representation in the parks and different parks around the world,

1493
01:04:11,820 --> 01:04:16,020
we're still lacking in, as we've said before, the X-Men's mansion.

1494
01:04:16,020 --> 01:04:18,180
We're still lacking in the fantastic four building.

1495
01:04:18,180 --> 01:04:22,420
It's not like there's just so much Marvel, like famous iconography

1496
01:04:22,420 --> 01:04:24,340
that we get to see in parks. There's not.

1497
01:04:24,340 --> 01:04:27,020
So we have the Avengers L.A. Live is what we have.

1498
01:04:27,020 --> 01:04:30,260
We have we have the Avengers L.A. Live. Yes.

1499
01:04:30,260 --> 01:04:33,620
They they decided like, you know what we won't take from the comics.

1500
01:04:33,820 --> 01:04:37,140
We won't take the thing where the Avengers live in a giant, weird

1501
01:04:37,140 --> 01:04:39,820
mansion in Central Park.

1502
01:04:39,820 --> 01:04:42,820
Although I guess in the comics, eventually they are like living in Stark

1503
01:04:42,820 --> 01:04:45,460
Tower anyway, so they just they did pull that.

1504
01:04:45,460 --> 01:04:48,100
But it's like, yeah, location.

1505
01:04:48,100 --> 01:04:50,260
Sense of place is so much fun.

1506
01:04:50,260 --> 01:04:54,940
And it's the kind of building where like maybe the third floor will be apartment.

1507
01:04:54,940 --> 01:04:58,340
Second floor is Avengers headquarters, but maybe the bottom they lease out

1508
01:04:58,340 --> 01:05:02,100
to like Wolfgang Puck or, yeah, you know, maybe if Scottie Pippen's

1509
01:05:02,100 --> 01:05:04,140
doing a restaurant, you know, he could go down there.

1510
01:05:04,140 --> 01:05:08,820
Sure. For the MTV Video Music Awards, Future will do his performance on the roof

1511
01:05:08,820 --> 01:05:11,300
and they'll be helicopters videotaping him. It'll be cool.

1512
01:05:11,300 --> 01:05:13,620
It'll be cool. Yeah, look, it's glowy. It's cool.

1513
01:05:13,620 --> 01:05:17,060
Yeah. I mean, look, it's the cameras are so good now.

1514
01:05:17,060 --> 01:05:20,260
You'll be able to see all the bandages he's playing around with, you know.

1515
01:05:20,940 --> 01:05:23,340
Yeah, I have an answer.

1516
01:05:23,340 --> 01:05:25,980
The Hall of Justice first appeared in Super Friends.

1517
01:05:26,140 --> 01:05:28,300
So that is correct. That is first appearance.

1518
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:30,740
So that's a that's it's got to be watched.

1519
01:05:30,740 --> 01:05:32,780
You've seen Super Friends, I assume.

1520
01:05:32,780 --> 01:05:35,100
Yeah, I mean, generally. Yeah, yeah.

1521
01:05:35,100 --> 01:05:37,140
I'm not saying, oh, you got to watch Super Friends.

1522
01:05:37,140 --> 01:05:40,180
It is what it is. If you saw one, you know what it is.

1523
01:05:41,180 --> 01:05:43,700
But yeah, that is very but it's like the sillier.

1524
01:05:43,700 --> 01:05:46,620
And yes, yeah, kind of thing.

1525
01:05:46,620 --> 01:05:49,140
And that's the building they recreated, right?

1526
01:05:49,140 --> 01:05:51,620
Needs. Yes. Very fun that they went with that.

1527
01:05:51,620 --> 01:05:55,340
That like I guess the I would the only thing I would probably do

1528
01:05:55,340 --> 01:05:58,220
the only thing I would prefer is like seeing like the I guess the 66

1529
01:05:58,220 --> 01:06:01,820
Wayne Manor, the Batman 60 Adam West Wayne Manor

1530
01:06:02,380 --> 01:06:06,460
or like Batcave recreated in of like a fun because it's a fun choice.

1531
01:06:06,460 --> 01:06:09,260
I they used they used different versions of the Hall of Justice later

1532
01:06:09,260 --> 01:06:12,860
and like more serious stories and stuff. But yeah.

1533
01:06:12,860 --> 01:06:16,500
That Batcave is kind of just, you know, that cave, that Bronson.

1534
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:19,260
It's kind of just when the bat when the Batmobile drives,

1535
01:06:19,260 --> 01:06:23,020
it's just sort of like goes through like two big leaves.

1536
01:06:23,020 --> 01:06:25,980
But yeah, basically, there's kind of is no

1537
01:06:27,660 --> 01:06:29,860
there were they went a little lo fi with the Batcave.

1538
01:06:29,860 --> 01:06:32,540
The Batcave exterior, that is. Yeah. Yeah.

1539
01:06:32,540 --> 01:06:36,100
If you're if you don't know what we're talking about, if you're in Los Angeles,

1540
01:06:36,340 --> 01:06:39,340
there's a neighborhood in Hollywood where you keep just driving up the hill

1541
01:06:39,340 --> 01:06:41,740
and eventually you can get to the the Batcave.

1542
01:06:42,220 --> 01:06:43,020
Mm hmm.

1543
01:06:43,020 --> 01:06:45,260
Mm hmm. Yeah, which is very fun.

1544
01:06:45,260 --> 01:06:46,820
And if you like that, do it.

1545
01:06:46,820 --> 01:06:50,140
So so that immediately gets you puts you in the mood.

1546
01:06:50,420 --> 01:06:52,340
It's not fully themed around.

1547
01:06:52,340 --> 01:06:54,140
There's still like stuff.

1548
01:06:54,140 --> 01:06:56,740
And I think we talked about in the episode, there's like Tweety Bird

1549
01:06:57,100 --> 01:07:01,660
on the loudspeaker outside of of the of the Hall of Justice.

1550
01:07:01,660 --> 01:07:03,740
So it's not perfectly themed.

1551
01:07:03,740 --> 01:07:05,980
There's sound bleed from other things.

1552
01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:07,820
But again, six flags.

1553
01:07:07,820 --> 01:07:09,420
You're like, well, that's cool. This is great.

1554
01:07:09,420 --> 01:07:12,220
This is going to be cool because this feels this feels different

1555
01:07:12,220 --> 01:07:15,100
than most of the other experiences.

1556
01:07:15,100 --> 01:07:17,140
Well, I did like the outside.

1557
01:07:17,140 --> 01:07:19,980
Yeah. So you got to appreciate that, Scott.

1558
01:07:19,980 --> 01:07:21,460
I did. I did like that.

1559
01:07:21,460 --> 01:07:23,260
And the store is great.

1560
01:07:23,260 --> 01:07:24,780
I love that they're selling capes.

1561
01:07:24,780 --> 01:07:26,100
They're trying to make capes happen.

1562
01:07:26,100 --> 01:07:28,340
Yes, capes. They've been doing that for a while.

1563
01:07:28,340 --> 01:07:29,820
And that does make a lot of sense.

1564
01:07:29,820 --> 01:07:32,980
I will say, I wouldn't want you.

1565
01:07:33,340 --> 01:07:37,180
If I had some kids, I would be like, put the capes on when we get home.

1566
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:40,940
Do not wear the capes on the roller coaster or the rides.

1567
01:07:40,940 --> 01:07:44,820
You don't want to flip a thing that's flying behind you

1568
01:07:44,820 --> 01:07:47,740
while there's, you know, mechanics and gears.

1569
01:07:47,740 --> 01:07:48,940
And you could get you on.

1570
01:07:48,940 --> 01:07:50,300
You could get goo on the capes.

1571
01:07:50,540 --> 01:07:51,580
You get goo on it.

1572
01:07:51,580 --> 01:07:52,860
Incredible rules.

1573
01:07:52,860 --> 01:07:55,900
It's like the Incredibles, you know, Edna mode, like no capes, no capes.

1574
01:07:55,900 --> 01:07:57,180
You know, yes, yes, yes.

1575
01:07:57,180 --> 01:07:58,780
The liability. I thought of that completely.

1576
01:07:58,780 --> 01:08:02,340
Yes, this is a decapitation recipe waiting to happen. Yes.

1577
01:08:02,340 --> 01:08:04,460
But I do like the capes in general.

1578
01:08:04,460 --> 01:08:07,620
I will say, Sky, no, Scott, did you see all the Batman forever?

1579
01:08:08,180 --> 01:08:12,260
I cannot like the fonts and stuff on the games and then on the Revengers.

1580
01:08:12,260 --> 01:08:14,420
Revenge. Did you pay attention to any of that?

1581
01:08:14,420 --> 01:08:17,020
Well, I didn't go too close to the Revengers. Revenge.

1582
01:08:17,020 --> 01:08:19,740
Again, I didn't, you know, I worried that you would get on it

1583
01:08:19,740 --> 01:08:23,060
if by getting too close to it, I would just end up.

1584
01:08:23,180 --> 01:08:24,940
I mean, that's what I thought when I was a kid,

1585
01:08:24,940 --> 01:08:27,220
because when the people mover would go into Space Mountain.

1586
01:08:27,220 --> 01:08:29,860
Yeah, you like we're just going to the track will just switch.

1587
01:08:29,860 --> 01:08:32,260
And now we're on Space Mountain. Right.

1588
01:08:32,260 --> 01:08:34,100
So, yeah, there's some of that's some of that's lingering.

1589
01:08:34,100 --> 01:08:35,940
I am, by the way, I'm disappointed I didn't.

1590
01:08:35,940 --> 01:08:37,860
I think a beer would have gotten me on that.

1591
01:08:37,860 --> 01:08:39,820
And I need that. I needed to fly.

1592
01:08:39,820 --> 01:08:43,180
I think I need to fly like Batman. Yeah.

1593
01:08:43,180 --> 01:08:45,540
Riddler's Revenge, I swear, I think you could have done fine.

1594
01:08:45,660 --> 01:08:46,940
I really don't think it's that big of a deal.

1595
01:08:46,940 --> 01:08:48,980
It's an odd way to stand on her.

1596
01:08:48,980 --> 01:08:50,060
It's a standing coaster.

1597
01:08:50,060 --> 01:08:52,460
And again, as we demonstrated on the other episode

1598
01:08:52,700 --> 01:08:56,100
when I sadly used ET to be the seat of the coaster,

1599
01:08:56,900 --> 01:09:00,260
it is a little odd getting into it.

1600
01:09:00,340 --> 01:09:04,020
But once it's there, you're it's you've got your mommy harness.

1601
01:09:04,380 --> 01:09:07,060
You feel very like locked into it.

1602
01:09:07,060 --> 01:09:08,860
And it's it's not grip mommy.

1603
01:09:08,860 --> 01:09:10,300
Yeah, you can grip mommy.

1604
01:09:10,300 --> 01:09:13,100
And it's not much more intense than the thing we went on at Nats.

1605
01:09:13,100 --> 01:09:18,100
Or, yeah, I think I think that I think next time soon, next time when you go,

1606
01:09:18,100 --> 01:09:21,180
I think we will you'll do Riddler's Revenge and.

1607
01:09:21,820 --> 01:09:23,980
Well, some of those words don't resonate with me.

1608
01:09:23,980 --> 01:09:25,180
Like soon.

1609
01:09:25,180 --> 01:09:26,180
Next time.

1610
01:09:26,180 --> 01:09:29,100
What if I added the modifier very too soon?

1611
01:09:30,420 --> 01:09:32,180
It's probably less or less appealing.

1612
01:09:32,180 --> 01:09:35,380
OK, all right. I got an email the next day saying, hey, you can still

1613
01:09:35,380 --> 01:09:37,780
if you pay us 20 more dollars, you can get an annual pass.

1614
01:09:37,780 --> 01:09:39,940
And I was like, no, delete.

1615
01:09:40,380 --> 01:09:43,060
You should. I need those 20 dollars for anything.

1616
01:09:43,060 --> 01:09:45,260
I should have when you went.

1617
01:09:45,260 --> 01:09:46,060
Go ahead.

1618
01:09:46,060 --> 01:09:47,020
Did you?

1619
01:09:47,020 --> 01:09:50,700
I was going to say, did you go before Labor Day or after before?

1620
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:57,020
OK, so still kind of the summer season, kind of odd to have your big

1621
01:09:57,140 --> 01:09:59,580
only dark ride clothes.

1622
01:10:00,060 --> 01:10:02,860
Yes. You're one of your only air conditioned experiences.

1623
01:10:02,860 --> 01:10:06,620
Well, again, they look they told me they didn't know what was wrong with it.

1624
01:10:06,620 --> 01:10:10,940
Can you as if it was like a horse that had diarrhea or something?

1625
01:10:11,820 --> 01:10:13,820
Well, I know what's wrong with us today.

1626
01:10:13,820 --> 01:10:15,700
I know what's wrong with the horse.

1627
01:10:15,700 --> 01:10:17,940
Horse can't get any I've remected.

1628
01:10:19,820 --> 01:10:20,420
I don't stop.

1629
01:10:20,420 --> 01:10:23,020
Tell you what's wrong with that goddamn horse.

1630
01:10:23,020 --> 01:10:25,980
Nobody's thinking about these horses eating all the horse paste.

1631
01:10:26,020 --> 01:10:27,460
Horses need that paste.

1632
01:10:27,460 --> 01:10:28,660
That's yeah.

1633
01:10:28,660 --> 01:10:34,420
Also, my under the table, I remectin sales like I was already bootlegging it.

1634
01:10:34,420 --> 01:10:37,020
You know, like I can't get it to resell.

1635
01:10:37,820 --> 01:10:40,060
It's tough times for everyone right now. Yeah.

1636
01:10:41,500 --> 01:10:44,620
Your online horse paste business. Yeah.

1637
01:10:45,620 --> 01:10:47,980
Jason's good old fashioned artisanal.

1638
01:10:48,340 --> 01:10:51,260
I almost had them sponsoring the podcast and they were just like,

1639
01:10:51,260 --> 01:10:53,540
Oh, podcasting interesting.

1640
01:10:53,540 --> 01:10:55,340
Like, oh, we should look into that.

1641
01:10:55,340 --> 01:10:59,300
Jason Jason just sells a variety of pastes in general.

1642
01:10:59,460 --> 01:11:01,940
All types of yeah, Jason sells.

1643
01:11:03,780 --> 01:11:06,540
I was going to say, Scott Moose Moose paste,

1644
01:11:07,260 --> 01:11:10,380
Sparrow paste, all the paste.

1645
01:11:11,180 --> 01:11:14,700
Scott, could you try negotiating with the email address,

1646
01:11:14,700 --> 01:11:18,100
the Six Flags email address, like where they say $20 for annual pass?

1647
01:11:18,100 --> 01:11:21,340
And you go, well, throw in dining and it's a deal.

1648
01:11:21,500 --> 01:11:23,700
You think you could go back and forth with a high level?

1649
01:11:23,700 --> 01:11:25,980
No, maybe to see.

1650
01:11:25,980 --> 01:11:27,700
Well, you want me to send that and see?

1651
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:30,420
I love it. Yeah, right now. Yeah, please.

1652
01:11:30,420 --> 01:11:33,980
All right. Well, then go ahead and you can describe more right details

1653
01:11:33,980 --> 01:11:36,180
and I'll begin this correspondence.

1654
01:11:36,660 --> 01:11:39,460
Yeah, you can draft up like a legal, like a counteroffer.

1655
01:11:40,100 --> 01:11:41,820
Yeah, I might keep it real brief.

1656
01:11:41,820 --> 01:11:44,540
How about 10? Yeah.

1657
01:11:44,540 --> 01:11:47,180
How about 10 is funny, too?

1658
01:11:47,180 --> 01:11:49,380
So yeah, so so

1659
01:11:49,380 --> 01:11:52,820
thing we should say about just league is everyone appears to be a little bit

1660
01:11:52,820 --> 01:11:54,100
different.

1661
01:11:54,100 --> 01:11:57,420
Not appears to be is everything's like a little bit laid out differently.

1662
01:11:58,140 --> 01:12:00,220
The one at Magic Mountain,

1663
01:12:01,180 --> 01:12:04,340
you go into a big and again, listen to the podcast, the right episode

1664
01:12:04,340 --> 01:12:08,700
about Fright Fest, you go into like kind of a big empty ish feeling room.

1665
01:12:08,860 --> 01:12:10,740
And then you go into another room that also feels empty.

1666
01:12:10,740 --> 01:12:13,020
But the cyborg animatronic is in there.

1667
01:12:13,540 --> 01:12:16,620
And he then explains to you sort of what the narrative of the ride is.

1668
01:12:16,820 --> 01:12:19,020
And like I saw the Six Flags Great America one,

1669
01:12:19,380 --> 01:12:23,140
the animatronic is more by the loading area for the cars.

1670
01:12:23,140 --> 01:12:25,500
It's in the same room as that one.

1671
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:27,980
So they're all different. They're all a little different.

1672
01:12:27,980 --> 01:12:30,820
They all got different quirks and personality.

1673
01:12:31,340 --> 01:12:33,660
Yeah, the

1674
01:12:33,660 --> 01:12:35,860
the Magic Mountain one is notable.

1675
01:12:35,860 --> 01:12:38,260
The most recent one, the Magic Mountain one,

1676
01:12:38,260 --> 01:12:41,620
notable for having a slightly different ending than a lot of the others.

1677
01:12:41,900 --> 01:12:46,340
And it adds in Harley Quinn, right, which might have been a thing,

1678
01:12:47,060 --> 01:12:51,220
you know, an agreement with the municipalities of Valencia and Santa

1679
01:12:51,220 --> 01:12:54,140
Clarita, because Harley Quinn is in the official city stamp.

1680
01:12:54,460 --> 01:12:58,900
So, you know, that might have been 60 percent of our residents.

1681
01:13:01,380 --> 01:13:05,580
This is an area where Harley Quinn is too popular, very popular.

1682
01:13:06,300 --> 01:13:08,380
The other thing I don't think we've said about the ride,

1683
01:13:08,380 --> 01:13:10,220
this is an award winning.

1684
01:13:10,220 --> 01:13:15,340
This is a 2018 Thea Award for Outstanding Achievement in the Attraction category.

1685
01:13:16,140 --> 01:13:21,180
That is the themed entertainment awards, which are put on by the TEA,

1686
01:13:22,300 --> 01:13:24,420
the themed entertainment association.

1687
01:13:25,340 --> 01:13:28,540
I officially can say now for a fact,

1688
01:13:28,900 --> 01:13:34,140
Thea is said, IAPA, the International Association of Amusement Parks, is said

1689
01:13:34,780 --> 01:13:37,340
TEA is spelled out.

1690
01:13:37,380 --> 01:13:40,180
And so I've gotten roasted for that before.

1691
01:13:40,180 --> 01:13:41,900
I think I've got to figure it out now.

1692
01:13:41,900 --> 01:13:44,620
What a roast. What a roast.

1693
01:13:44,620 --> 01:13:46,900
Yes. I made fun of you for regular wrinkles.

1694
01:13:46,900 --> 01:13:50,580
So I think someone made fun of me for saying IAPA.

1695
01:13:50,580 --> 01:13:54,220
And I was like, oh, I didn't immediately jump to IAPA.

1696
01:13:54,660 --> 01:13:57,740
But I have now watched videos where people say IAPA.

1697
01:13:58,740 --> 01:14:02,660
What a fool Jason was saying each letter of the acronym.

1698
01:14:02,660 --> 01:14:06,620
A fool to the roast with him to the roast for me.

1699
01:14:06,620 --> 01:14:07,940
So, yeah.

1700
01:14:07,940 --> 01:14:12,220
And as I was saying, this ride made by the Sally Corporation.

1701
01:14:12,220 --> 01:14:15,620
And you got to give it up for Sally Dark Rides just for the sheer

1702
01:14:16,420 --> 01:14:20,820
weirdness of the variety of rides they have made.

1703
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:25,340
They're good. I have a I have a proposition.

1704
01:14:25,580 --> 01:14:28,740
I've been wanting to bring this up because I when they came up with

1705
01:14:29,260 --> 01:14:31,820
maybe one of those New Hampshire ones we talked about with Mookie,

1706
01:14:31,820 --> 01:14:33,100
I was just like, I never heard of this.

1707
01:14:33,100 --> 01:14:33,820
I never heard of that.

1708
01:14:33,820 --> 01:14:34,780
I think that we should do it.

1709
01:14:34,780 --> 01:14:37,980
Maybe a second gate that is some kind of like Sally Dark Ride

1710
01:14:38,380 --> 01:14:40,820
potluck kind of a situation. Oh, yeah, that's good.

1711
01:14:40,820 --> 01:14:44,940
We all pick one and teach the others about it because there's such odd,

1712
01:14:44,980 --> 01:14:48,100
idiosyncratic, weird, charming, janky

1713
01:14:48,980 --> 01:14:51,740
that involve IPs where you're like, that is a ride.

1714
01:14:51,940 --> 01:14:56,540
Like, I think just to plant a flag in that here,

1715
01:14:56,540 --> 01:14:58,580
I think something with Sally would be fun.

1716
01:14:58,780 --> 01:15:00,300
I think that's right. Yeah.

1717
01:15:00,300 --> 01:15:04,620
Because in New Hampshire at Kenobi Lake Park, they did the Mine of Lost Souls.

1718
01:15:05,100 --> 01:15:08,180
They they I think read did it actually.

1719
01:15:09,580 --> 01:15:10,620
But don't quote me on that.

1720
01:15:10,620 --> 01:15:14,180
But like, yeah, they've done a Scooby Doo kind of haunted ride.

1721
01:15:14,180 --> 01:15:17,900
Then they did the copyright free Boo Blasters on Boo Hill

1722
01:15:17,900 --> 01:15:20,820
when they had to yank all the Scooby Doo stuff out of the Paramount Parks.

1723
01:15:21,580 --> 01:15:25,660
They did Knights in White Satin, the trip, maybe the strangest dark ride

1724
01:15:25,660 --> 01:15:31,220
ever made based on the moody blues song that lasted less than a year.

1725
01:15:31,220 --> 01:15:36,460
And it and then it was gutted and turned into the Mon Stars of Rock, which

1726
01:15:37,020 --> 01:15:39,060
I forgot there was a second version.

1727
01:15:39,060 --> 01:15:40,180
That's right. Yeah.

1728
01:15:40,180 --> 01:15:45,900
The one of the one of the theme park YouTube channels was just exploring

1729
01:15:46,260 --> 01:15:48,940
the Hard Rock Park, the abandoned Hard Rock Park campus.

1730
01:15:48,940 --> 01:15:51,860
And the stuff they came across was bizarre.

1731
01:15:52,700 --> 01:15:56,900
Architectural drawings, piles and piles of merchandise.

1732
01:15:57,140 --> 01:15:59,460
Oh, yeah. The moody blues are here.

1733
01:15:59,460 --> 01:16:00,980
Two of the moody. Yeah.

1734
01:16:00,980 --> 01:16:02,940
Subsession, guys.

1735
01:16:02,940 --> 01:16:05,420
We're not look, we're not done with Hard Rock Park.

1736
01:16:05,420 --> 01:16:09,020
We'll get there to put a pin back in that, too, because we're sure.

1737
01:16:09,020 --> 01:16:10,100
Yeah, great. Yeah.

1738
01:16:10,100 --> 01:16:12,380
Been too long. I miss it. Yeah.

1739
01:16:12,380 --> 01:16:13,820
So, yeah, Sally, for sure.

1740
01:16:13,820 --> 01:16:16,020
Like they've made such a variety of things.

1741
01:16:16,700 --> 01:16:20,100
And the ride is I mean, I forget what even came out in 2018, but the ride,

1742
01:16:20,340 --> 01:16:23,340
I will say as much as we're goofing around, like the ride is cool.

1743
01:16:23,340 --> 01:16:26,540
If I had my 3D glasses on, I think I would have thought, oh, that's a cool

1744
01:16:26,900 --> 01:16:29,740
solid Justice League ride where you get to this is what this is what

1745
01:16:30,140 --> 01:16:32,620
if it fulfills all the things I say.

1746
01:16:32,620 --> 01:16:34,940
And sometimes I if I were griping about

1747
01:16:36,380 --> 01:16:39,180
Rise of the Resistance, it's like Rises is awesome.

1748
01:16:39,340 --> 01:16:43,140
But like for that budget, like, why don't we have every Star Wars character in it?

1749
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:46,220
Why don't I get an interaction with like every character from every

1750
01:16:46,300 --> 01:16:48,300
all nine movies or whatever in there?

1751
01:16:48,340 --> 01:16:50,820
And this one is like, yeah, you get the whole the Justice League's there.

1752
01:16:50,820 --> 01:16:53,060
Joker's there. Harley's there. Lex Luthor.

1753
01:16:53,060 --> 01:16:55,380
Like you get better than the rise of the resistance.

1754
01:16:55,380 --> 01:16:57,260
I didn't say I like it better. No, no.

1755
01:16:57,260 --> 01:16:59,340
Just like you're judging it on that.

1756
01:16:59,340 --> 01:17:02,300
No, I'm saying it's like a stacked lineup.

1757
01:17:02,300 --> 01:17:06,860
They even Superman, Supergirl, Wonder Woman, Flash, Green Lantern,

1758
01:17:07,140 --> 01:17:10,420
Cyborg, Batman. I'm saying it to see my friends.

1759
01:17:10,860 --> 01:17:12,060
Is the thing you're right.

1760
01:17:12,060 --> 01:17:16,300
It doesn't show you flash cards of of characters you recognize.

1761
01:17:16,460 --> 01:17:17,780
OK, you should have.

1762
01:17:17,780 --> 01:17:21,140
You got to go down to what my son did.

1763
01:17:21,460 --> 01:17:26,180
The the the chain and Sea World with Cookie Monster and Elmo and Big Bird.

1764
01:17:26,420 --> 01:17:28,380
You pointed them and then you leave. Right.

1765
01:17:28,380 --> 01:17:30,180
Yeah, that's what rise the rise of the resistance.

1766
01:17:30,180 --> 01:17:31,060
They spent all that money.

1767
01:17:31,060 --> 01:17:32,660
It should have been a chain with flash.

1768
01:17:32,660 --> 01:17:35,580
It's on it pictures of the characters I like.

1769
01:17:35,700 --> 01:17:37,940
It should be Jar Jar. It should be Babu Frick.

1770
01:17:37,980 --> 01:17:42,020
It should be, I don't know, Lando. All of them. Yeah.

1771
01:17:42,820 --> 01:17:46,940
This lineup almost too powerful to be in this predicament.

1772
01:17:48,420 --> 01:17:49,900
Yes, yes, you're right.

1773
01:17:49,900 --> 01:17:52,860
Yes, it seems like you should have like a crazy mega threat.

1774
01:17:52,860 --> 01:17:55,260
If you're if you're stacking this Justice League lineup,

1775
01:17:55,260 --> 01:17:56,820
that's what you're saying, right, Jason?

1776
01:17:56,820 --> 01:17:59,220
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

1777
01:17:59,220 --> 01:18:03,020
Yeah, because you have this version, the ones in America have

1778
01:18:03,740 --> 01:18:05,820
Lex Luthor and the Joker.

1779
01:18:05,820 --> 01:18:10,980
The original impetus for this ride was they made a Sally made a ride

1780
01:18:10,980 --> 01:18:14,940
called Justice League Alien invasion 3D for Warner Brothers movie world

1781
01:18:15,260 --> 01:18:19,340
in Australia, and that when you fight Star of the Conqueror.

1782
01:18:19,380 --> 01:18:22,460
Right. Recently featured in Suicide Squad.

1783
01:18:22,460 --> 01:18:25,820
Yeah. Suicide Squad, although they make him look a little more

1784
01:18:25,820 --> 01:18:28,620
like a guy in the ride in Australia.

1785
01:18:28,620 --> 01:18:33,060
Like he should just be a giant starfish, like hundreds of little starfish.

1786
01:18:33,420 --> 01:18:34,940
Right. Which is a great.

1787
01:18:34,940 --> 01:18:36,980
I'm a big Starro fan anyway. Go ahead. Yeah.

1788
01:18:37,580 --> 01:18:39,740
Suicide on the Suicide Squad

1789
01:18:39,740 --> 01:18:43,620
No, that weird store with all the tape everywhere and Daffy in the chain.

1790
01:18:44,860 --> 01:18:47,540
That is where you can go if you want to buy a big stand,

1791
01:18:47,540 --> 01:18:51,780
a life size stand of Adam Beach in Suicide Squad.

1792
01:18:52,060 --> 01:18:54,780
Oh, OK. They have a name.

1793
01:18:54,780 --> 01:18:57,940
All right. That's what do you know offhand the character?

1794
01:18:57,940 --> 01:19:00,020
Now I can't think of it.

1795
01:19:00,020 --> 01:19:01,740
I have not seen this film.

1796
01:19:01,740 --> 01:19:05,180
I know this person is he the one is he in both of them?

1797
01:19:05,180 --> 01:19:09,260
I have a I have a problem not not OK.

1798
01:19:09,460 --> 01:19:12,140
Yeah. So if you want to buy, yeah, if you want to buy it,

1799
01:19:12,140 --> 01:19:16,180
they don't have like they don't have like Sina Peacemaker standee or anything.

1800
01:19:16,580 --> 01:19:17,500
Only Slipknot.

1801
01:19:17,500 --> 01:19:19,980
I think Slipknot is mostly cut out of the movie.

1802
01:19:19,980 --> 01:19:22,460
I believe the first one to eat it.

1803
01:19:22,740 --> 01:19:25,300
Slipknot, if I'm if I'm correct.

1804
01:19:25,300 --> 01:19:27,140
Hmm. Huh?

1805
01:19:27,140 --> 01:19:28,820
That what? That's odd.

1806
01:19:28,820 --> 01:19:29,980
Why would? Yeah.

1807
01:19:29,980 --> 01:19:31,740
Only that. That's the only one.

1808
01:19:31,740 --> 01:19:35,140
OK. I also know not Idris Elba.

1809
01:19:35,140 --> 01:19:38,700
Is there any other is there any other piece of merch with an actor who played a character?

1810
01:19:38,700 --> 01:19:42,420
No. Otherwise, it's just a drawing of Harley Quinn drawing a bad man.

1811
01:19:42,420 --> 01:19:44,540
But you can't buy Adam Beach specifically.

1812
01:19:44,540 --> 01:19:46,780
What Idris Elba? No, Margot Robbie.

1813
01:19:46,780 --> 01:19:49,340
That's very odd. No, no, no, no, no.

1814
01:19:49,340 --> 01:19:53,700
Yeah. You should have asked somebody at the like, Oh, can I get an Idris Elba

1815
01:19:53,700 --> 01:19:57,860
standee? And I assume that would have said like the answer would have been no.

1816
01:19:59,020 --> 01:20:01,380
If there if the phone was looked up from.

1817
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:03,780
Yeah, that's fair. And they would have been.

1818
01:20:03,780 --> 01:20:07,780
Sorry, Jessica has doused her minions in a very

1819
01:20:08,220 --> 01:20:13,780
dank strain of indica, and they're going right into the couch

1820
01:20:13,780 --> 01:20:15,780
and they are not helping your ass.

1821
01:20:18,540 --> 01:20:19,980
Oh, man, these henchmen.

1822
01:20:19,980 --> 01:20:23,500
I think she could she could have tried to change the tide in this, right?

1823
01:20:23,500 --> 01:20:26,020
If she's if she's helping out Lex and

1824
01:20:27,380 --> 01:20:31,220
you choose a character, yeah, just to see even the all star line up doesn't stand a chance.

1825
01:20:32,220 --> 01:20:35,300
I'll say about Lex, this is a pretty clear motive.

1826
01:20:35,300 --> 01:20:38,700
This is, you know, kind of a evergreen DC

1827
01:20:38,700 --> 01:20:43,820
comic story of Lex Luthor thinks the real menace is the Justice League

1828
01:20:43,820 --> 01:20:46,300
and he can keep order if he's in charge.

1829
01:20:46,300 --> 01:20:50,260
Like that is the starting point for the storyline of the ride.

1830
01:20:50,780 --> 01:20:52,060
Yeah, and that's a classic.

1831
01:20:52,060 --> 01:20:55,740
Yeah, Lex is jealousy generally is what fuels Lex.

1832
01:20:56,300 --> 01:20:58,540
Most of the incarnations of Lex Luthor.

1833
01:20:58,540 --> 01:21:02,500
And yeah, this seems to be a similar one where he says he's going to do it.

1834
01:21:02,500 --> 01:21:04,980
But he's like, he's bad. You can't trust him.

1835
01:21:04,980 --> 01:21:06,420
He's a bad guy. You can't trust him.

1836
01:21:06,420 --> 01:21:10,540
No. And then he just is association with the Joker alone.

1837
01:21:10,540 --> 01:21:13,340
You know, he's like not all the way there. Of course.

1838
01:21:13,340 --> 01:21:17,220
Why would you ever, ever even being a bad guy, team up with a Joker?

1839
01:21:17,220 --> 01:21:18,820
Doesn't make any sense. He's chaotic.

1840
01:21:18,820 --> 01:21:24,220
He's unpredictable. Any version of the Joker to Joaquin Joker.

1841
01:21:24,220 --> 01:21:26,380
Yeah, he's a Romero Joker.

1842
01:21:26,380 --> 01:21:30,140
All unpredictable. Not a good person to have on the team, in my opinion.

1843
01:21:30,380 --> 01:21:33,100
No, no long in a team, really at all.

1844
01:21:33,180 --> 01:21:34,140
Yes, that's true.

1845
01:21:34,140 --> 01:21:35,060
No, not really.

1846
01:21:35,060 --> 01:21:39,100
I mean, he's often in the Legion of Doom, but he's not a team player.

1847
01:21:39,380 --> 01:21:41,660
The Injustice Gang, they call them sometimes.

1848
01:21:42,820 --> 01:21:43,660
Yes.

1849
01:21:43,660 --> 01:21:45,860
The Legion of Doom is like the collection of bad guys.

1850
01:21:45,860 --> 01:21:48,580
And then Injustice Gang is also a collection of bad guys.

1851
01:21:48,900 --> 01:21:50,100
That's the same similar.

1852
01:21:50,100 --> 01:21:52,220
You can use them fairly interchangeably.

1853
01:21:52,500 --> 01:21:55,340
And as I say that, some comic book guy is going to be very upset with me

1854
01:21:55,340 --> 01:21:58,980
because I'm just going to be once like Black Manta was never on

1855
01:21:59,740 --> 01:22:01,140
like Injustice Gang or something.

1856
01:22:01,140 --> 01:22:01,940
They're going to be very upset.

1857
01:22:01,940 --> 01:22:04,180
Black Manta being the Aquaman villain.

1858
01:22:04,540 --> 01:22:08,220
So, yeah, I to recap.

1859
01:22:08,220 --> 01:22:11,780
So so you get like this video here and you get to see Lex,

1860
01:22:11,780 --> 01:22:13,380
you get to see Superman.

1861
01:22:13,380 --> 01:22:14,940
The CGI is pretty good.

1862
01:22:14,940 --> 01:22:17,820
But as I said in the other episode, like it seems like nobody knows

1863
01:22:17,820 --> 01:22:18,820
what to do with their hands.

1864
01:22:18,820 --> 01:22:20,820
They seem a little bit nervous on camera.

1865
01:22:21,500 --> 01:22:24,860
Lex Luthor and Superman both seem like maybe this is their first time on camera.

1866
01:22:24,860 --> 01:22:27,740
They should take an acting class, maybe an on camera class,

1867
01:22:27,740 --> 01:22:31,140
just to see sort of the quirks that human beings have

1868
01:22:31,140 --> 01:22:32,340
when they get in front of a camera.

1869
01:22:32,340 --> 01:22:35,180
And we just bring me here up.

1870
01:22:35,180 --> 01:22:36,820
Is that what you say? Frame?

1871
01:22:36,820 --> 01:22:39,380
Is that is that right?

1872
01:22:39,380 --> 01:22:41,580
It's the Ricky Bobby, where he's like his hands keep

1873
01:22:41,580 --> 01:22:46,060
like coming into frame when he's doing the interview to try to grab the microphone.

1874
01:22:47,300 --> 01:22:49,420
It's basically the same thing.

1875
01:22:49,420 --> 01:22:51,060
Oh, real quick, a little piece of tape.

1876
01:22:51,060 --> 01:22:53,140
That's my spot. I should be on my spot.

1877
01:22:53,140 --> 01:22:55,780
Is it called a spot? Is it called a spot?

1878
01:22:56,140 --> 01:22:58,420
Is it stage right and left in movies?

1879
01:22:58,860 --> 01:23:02,700
OK, I know you pan left and right and you tilt up and down.

1880
01:23:02,700 --> 01:23:04,620
I do know that. Does that help?

1881
01:23:06,820 --> 01:23:10,380
A real real quick side note is when I took a commercial class,

1882
01:23:10,980 --> 01:23:14,700
I got on camera and the first thing is I said my name and then I yawned.

1883
01:23:15,900 --> 01:23:18,340
And that was a bad thing to do

1884
01:23:18,340 --> 01:23:20,820
when you're taking a class to be an actor.

1885
01:23:21,820 --> 01:23:25,700
So I sympathize with what I'm saying with the first time performers.

1886
01:23:25,700 --> 01:23:27,500
Grab a podcast and we've all yawned.

1887
01:23:27,500 --> 01:23:29,900
We can yawn over and over.

1888
01:23:30,500 --> 01:23:33,500
Yeah, no, it'll stare at our phones like Valencia teens. Mm hmm.

1889
01:23:34,740 --> 01:23:38,300
So, yeah, you get that just of what Jason was saying with Lex's plan.

1890
01:23:38,300 --> 01:23:41,540
And then you go and then if it's Magic Mountain, you go into the next room.

1891
01:23:41,900 --> 01:23:44,740
And that is where you see Cyborg, which is a cool animatronic.

1892
01:23:45,820 --> 01:23:47,980
Yeah. And is like,

1893
01:23:49,140 --> 01:23:53,740
I guess what I like about this and I like about Cyborg is that

1894
01:23:54,140 --> 01:23:57,940
they're kind of doing cartoon like it's it's cartoonish.

1895
01:23:57,940 --> 01:24:02,140
It's closer to like comic or like even like it's not fully like the Bruce

1896
01:24:02,140 --> 01:24:06,940
Tim animated style, but it is closer to the stuff that I have more affection

1897
01:24:06,940 --> 01:24:09,780
for it. And as much as I like any of the TV shows or movies,

1898
01:24:09,940 --> 01:24:13,940
I do like the comic look a lot other than if they were just fully going to make

1899
01:24:13,940 --> 01:24:16,100
a Batman 66 ride or a Batman Forever ride.

1900
01:24:16,380 --> 01:24:17,580
God bless, let's do it.

1901
01:24:17,580 --> 01:24:21,980
But if it's between this or more of a way like a way realistic

1902
01:24:22,140 --> 01:24:26,220
human depiction of all these characters, I go for more comic or cartoon

1903
01:24:26,220 --> 01:24:29,220
like like as Spider-Man in Orlando. Yeah.

1904
01:24:29,820 --> 01:24:34,940
Yeah, it's this isn't the recent DC movies where like Superman is like

1905
01:24:35,420 --> 01:24:38,500
it's the end of a two hour movie and he's like snapping a dude's neck.

1906
01:24:38,500 --> 01:24:40,900
And it's like, oh, OK, this is what we're doing.

1907
01:24:41,260 --> 01:24:44,740
All right. Yeah. I mean, I'm I'm again, I've talked about this before

1908
01:24:44,740 --> 01:24:46,180
with the Snyder movies.

1909
01:24:46,180 --> 01:24:49,020
I was very much like cranky about those Snyder movies because I was like,

1910
01:24:49,020 --> 01:24:50,340
oh, that's going to be so bleak.

1911
01:24:50,340 --> 01:24:53,340
I have come fully around to Snyder verse.

1912
01:24:53,660 --> 01:24:58,060
And I like the Snyder Justice League a lot and Cyborg specifically.

1913
01:24:58,460 --> 01:25:01,660
He got done so dirty in that weed inversion.

1914
01:25:01,660 --> 01:25:05,780
He has such a much better great story in the Justice Snyder verse.

1915
01:25:05,940 --> 01:25:07,420
But they're not doing that.

1916
01:25:07,420 --> 01:25:10,460
They're not doing and I will say this just like is not as bleak and dark

1917
01:25:10,460 --> 01:25:12,900
as those other movies that Batman Superman or Man of Steel.

1918
01:25:13,180 --> 01:25:17,660
That's true. I think the longer Batman Superman is less bleak.

1919
01:25:17,660 --> 01:25:21,100
I just remember watching Man of Steel going like, oh, what is this?

1920
01:25:21,740 --> 01:25:25,540
There's a cup of piss in the Batman versus Superman movie.

1921
01:25:25,820 --> 01:25:28,580
There is a mischievous cup of pie.

1922
01:25:29,500 --> 01:25:31,700
It's a prank. Someone drink it, Scott.

1923
01:25:31,700 --> 01:25:33,700
Let me tell you, it's a prank on a senator.

1924
01:25:34,580 --> 01:25:36,740
And that should answer all of your questions.

1925
01:25:37,420 --> 01:25:39,860
Yep. Yeah. Covered, covered, covered.

1926
01:25:40,700 --> 01:25:44,100
Yeah. I mean, I think the last few years have taught us that the

1927
01:25:44,900 --> 01:25:50,980
2010s odd morality play of like good people like Marvel and bad people like DC.

1928
01:25:51,820 --> 01:25:54,820
Maybe there's bigger things to worry about in the world.

1929
01:25:55,900 --> 01:26:00,380
The once in a lifetime pandemic kind of taught us that like, oh, yeah,

1930
01:26:00,380 --> 01:26:03,700
some of this doesn't really mean anything. Well, sure. Yeah.

1931
01:26:03,700 --> 01:26:07,700
I mean, if it's like, oh, the Man of Steel doesn't have as many quips or something.

1932
01:26:07,980 --> 01:26:12,580
I was like, OK, maybe maybe I shouldn't be so like upset

1933
01:26:12,940 --> 01:26:15,700
that I don't get like the exact version of Superman I want.

1934
01:26:16,580 --> 01:26:18,740
But I do like Justice League. I think Justice League is good.

1935
01:26:18,740 --> 01:26:23,340
I know you guys have not sat through the four hour saga, but I do recommend it.

1936
01:26:23,740 --> 01:26:28,260
Even if you're surprised that I haven't done it since we talked about this before.

1937
01:26:28,340 --> 01:26:29,820
I can provide that update.

1938
01:26:29,820 --> 01:26:32,460
That's OK. You'll get you'll get to it.

1939
01:26:32,460 --> 01:26:35,300
You'll get back to Six Flags. It'll all happen.

1940
01:26:35,300 --> 01:26:36,620
Yeah. What a review.

1941
01:26:36,620 --> 01:26:39,100
Less week. Less bleak.

1942
01:26:39,100 --> 01:26:42,060
You know, bleak than other super last week than the other.

1943
01:26:42,700 --> 01:26:45,540
Once you restart HBO Max a couple of times

1944
01:26:45,540 --> 01:26:49,300
and you'll be able to navigate to it when it stops freezing on you.

1945
01:26:50,340 --> 01:26:53,220
But yeah, but yeah, no, I like the cartoon.

1946
01:26:53,220 --> 01:26:56,580
You are like I think that's a good way to do an evergreen kind of version.

1947
01:26:56,740 --> 01:26:59,940
Yes, for sure. Because, yeah, there are people who grew up with like

1948
01:26:59,940 --> 01:27:03,660
the Bruce Tim kind of Batman, Superman, Justice League and the

1949
01:27:03,940 --> 01:27:07,780
and then there's the kids who grew up with Teen Titans and Teen Titans.

1950
01:27:07,780 --> 01:27:10,140
Go. Yeah. I mean, those were huge.

1951
01:27:10,140 --> 01:27:12,220
So like, yeah, and I think it's

1952
01:27:13,900 --> 01:27:16,940
it's a it's a good lineup of characters.

1953
01:27:17,420 --> 01:27:21,980
You see a lot of the big characters, some of the, you know, secondary characters.

1954
01:27:21,980 --> 01:27:24,380
And yeah, yeah.

1955
01:27:24,380 --> 01:27:25,660
And it feels like Spider.

1956
01:27:25,660 --> 01:27:28,900
It feels like the Orlando Spider-Man, where it's like there's so many characters

1957
01:27:28,900 --> 01:27:33,820
you like and you're put into like the the comic book, like animated universe,

1958
01:27:33,820 --> 01:27:37,900
which is still like Spider-Man's the gold standard for this type of thing.

1959
01:27:38,460 --> 01:27:42,820
Yeah, there's some like little nods to like more very niche stuff in the con.

1960
01:27:42,820 --> 01:27:47,580
Like they mentioned Argus and Star Labs, like these like go to

1961
01:27:48,140 --> 01:27:52,180
sort of DC Universe references are kind of scattered throughout.

1962
01:27:52,180 --> 01:27:55,540
But you don't really need to know them. Right. Yes. Yes.

1963
01:27:55,580 --> 01:27:57,900
So there's yeah, there's stuff for like hardcore people.

1964
01:27:57,900 --> 01:28:02,900
There's enough for like mom and dad who just like Superman or Batman or whatever.

1965
01:28:03,380 --> 01:28:07,340
You know, the characters that are like mass like, you know,

1966
01:28:07,340 --> 01:28:11,420
Superman, Batman, Betty Boop, the three characters that like everybody sort of knows.

1967
01:28:11,460 --> 01:28:12,660
Everyone knows. Yeah.

1968
01:28:12,660 --> 01:28:17,460
If you can buy it on a tin lunchbox in a store that just says it sells,

1969
01:28:17,460 --> 01:28:20,980
quote unquote, gifts, and you're not quite sure how they stay in business.

1970
01:28:20,980 --> 01:28:24,300
Everyone knows those characters. Yes, exactly. Yeah.

1971
01:28:25,420 --> 01:28:28,300
Yeah. Another thing about this ride,

1972
01:28:28,300 --> 01:28:31,820
I think that's unique to this specific dark ride,

1973
01:28:32,180 --> 01:28:37,820
is that it is scattered basically all over the country.

1974
01:28:38,260 --> 01:28:40,780
It's in Texas and

1975
01:28:42,460 --> 01:28:45,500
Texas, outside of Chicago, outside of New York City.

1976
01:28:45,500 --> 01:28:46,980
It's in Southern California.

1977
01:28:46,980 --> 01:28:48,660
There's one in Mexico.

1978
01:28:48,660 --> 01:28:53,540
Like this is the rare like dark ride where it's like you can pretty much hit it

1979
01:28:53,580 --> 01:28:56,380
in almost besides, I guess, the Pacific Northwest.

1980
01:28:57,580 --> 01:28:59,660
You can hit it in a lot of places.

1981
01:28:59,660 --> 01:29:03,460
Oh, yeah. Is it the most reproduced like it has to be right?

1982
01:29:03,460 --> 01:29:06,620
Dark ride. I mean, as far as I guess, there's aren't that many Disney's.

1983
01:29:06,620 --> 01:29:10,820
Right. Exactly. So it feels like maybe that is maybe there's the most versions

1984
01:29:10,820 --> 01:29:12,940
of this specific ride.

1985
01:29:12,940 --> 01:29:15,660
Yeah, especially if you count that alien invasion 3D.

1986
01:29:17,180 --> 01:29:19,580
Huh? Yeah, that's interesting.

1987
01:29:19,580 --> 01:29:24,540
So you can get you can get like a like a local the local version of it,

1988
01:29:24,540 --> 01:29:26,780
I guess it's like this is like a chain.

1989
01:29:26,780 --> 01:29:28,780
You can exactly that's exactly where I was going.

1990
01:29:28,780 --> 01:29:30,940
McDonald's is one kind of close to you.

1991
01:29:30,940 --> 01:29:34,780
Right. And sometimes McDonald's will have a different menu item regionally.

1992
01:29:34,820 --> 01:29:36,060
They're trying something different out.

1993
01:29:36,060 --> 01:29:38,140
Or it's obviously it's a different building, different.

1994
01:29:38,580 --> 01:29:41,140
It's not nonstandard McDonald's or something, depending on.

1995
01:29:41,140 --> 01:29:46,100
As with this recent investigation that's going on, sometimes the McFlurry

1996
01:29:46,300 --> 01:29:50,140
machine is broken and sometimes the Justice League ride is closed.

1997
01:29:51,060 --> 01:29:53,660
Yeah, let's get the FTC on this.

1998
01:29:53,660 --> 01:29:54,940
Let's get the FTC.

1999
01:29:54,940 --> 01:29:57,700
Are the other ones closed or the other Justice League's closed?

2000
01:29:58,100 --> 01:29:58,900
Oh, that's a good question.

2001
01:29:58,900 --> 01:30:03,380
There should be a website like there is to see if the ice cream machine is broken

2002
01:30:03,380 --> 01:30:04,300
at a McDonald's.

2003
01:30:04,300 --> 01:30:07,780
There should be a website that just says, is the Justice League ride broken at this

2004
01:30:08,980 --> 01:30:12,620
and you can put in the zip code and it'll tell you if it's working or not.

2005
01:30:13,580 --> 01:30:17,020
But it doesn't say why that website for McDonald's doesn't say why the ice cream

2006
01:30:17,020 --> 01:30:21,220
machine is not working for a location. But yeah, so.

2007
01:30:21,940 --> 01:30:23,340
Yeah, something is wrong.

2008
01:30:23,340 --> 01:30:24,460
Something is wrong.

2009
01:30:24,460 --> 01:30:26,340
You're going to get

2010
01:30:26,380 --> 01:30:28,860
now I'm in watching just videos of this.

2011
01:30:28,900 --> 01:30:33,780
What does strike me about the ride is it's clearly going for Spider-Man,

2012
01:30:33,900 --> 01:30:38,860
the Islands of Adventure ride, and it's a bit like a little too

2013
01:30:39,380 --> 01:30:42,020
closely attacked, like so many of the beats of it.

2014
01:30:42,420 --> 01:30:44,260
It feels very. Yes.

2015
01:30:44,260 --> 01:30:47,940
And we end with a big chase where you're going through the city streets

2016
01:30:47,940 --> 01:30:51,420
and you're getting yanked, but you're grabbing onto this vehicle

2017
01:30:51,420 --> 01:30:55,340
or like Transformers, you go through the floor of a building or

2018
01:30:55,580 --> 01:30:58,580
as a truck gag is kind of like a jump scare.

2019
01:30:58,580 --> 01:30:59,980
Yeah, there's a truck there.

2020
01:30:59,980 --> 01:31:03,380
It's definitely a I guess you would call it a trope at this point

2021
01:31:03,380 --> 01:31:07,020
for like modern 3D rides because even and we haven't talked about it too much.

2022
01:31:07,020 --> 01:31:09,420
But the not the not's

2023
01:31:09,420 --> 01:31:14,460
Berry Tales ride similarly has like a very fast moving

2024
01:31:14,460 --> 01:31:18,140
finale like that, where you're kind of going through things and you're falling.

2025
01:31:18,140 --> 01:31:22,460
And it's like that it feels like now because of maybe because of Spider-Man,

2026
01:31:22,500 --> 01:31:25,420
like that has to be the end for a ride like this.

2027
01:31:26,300 --> 01:31:28,140
Yeah, yeah, you're dropped.

2028
01:31:28,140 --> 01:31:30,940
There are some that are so like there's a garbage

2029
01:31:31,380 --> 01:31:34,220
truck gag, as Scott was saying.

2030
01:31:34,220 --> 01:31:36,620
And then you're dropped from a big height.

2031
01:31:36,620 --> 01:31:40,740
And in this case, like Green Lantern makes like a track,

2032
01:31:40,740 --> 01:31:44,900
like a little race car stock car track for you to slow down,

2033
01:31:45,100 --> 01:31:47,980
like come to a stop instead of like Spider-Man webbing.

2034
01:31:49,220 --> 01:31:51,540
Yeah, you there's some turns.

2035
01:31:51,580 --> 01:31:54,660
I watched a making a video that Sally put out and they're like,

2036
01:31:54,660 --> 01:32:00,060
yeah, we try to add it like some corkscrew or almost like upside down effects,

2037
01:32:00,060 --> 01:32:04,580
which are it's like the Six Flags brand because it's so roller coaster heavy.

2038
01:32:04,740 --> 01:32:10,300
Sure. So yeah, I think I think there's a good amount of variety.

2039
01:32:10,300 --> 01:32:14,180
It's yeah, the movement, the range of movement in the car

2040
01:32:14,660 --> 01:32:17,260
certainly evokes the Spider-Man ride.

2041
01:32:17,260 --> 01:32:21,460
But then there's like men in black Buzz Lightyear kind of shooting

2042
01:32:21,540 --> 01:32:23,980
elements to it as well. Yeah.

2043
01:32:24,020 --> 01:32:28,820
Yeah. Is it chaos when you're that it's 3D and there's Spider-Man kind of stuff

2044
01:32:28,820 --> 01:32:32,300
because Spider-Man and Transformers are not shooting rides.

2045
01:32:32,300 --> 01:32:35,380
So having the shooting component make it all kind of too much.

2046
01:32:35,380 --> 01:32:38,660
Too confusing. Yes, I think it's I I am

2047
01:32:39,740 --> 01:32:43,420
and I'm not always anti interactivity because like Toy Story made with many.

2048
01:32:43,420 --> 01:32:45,620
I think is great. I think that's perfect.

2049
01:32:46,020 --> 01:32:49,860
Even Buzz Lightyear's Astro Blasters, I think is really good.

2050
01:32:50,100 --> 01:32:52,900
But I do and I've said this before, and maybe I said I'm in a black

2051
01:32:53,100 --> 01:32:56,740
sometimes, especially in a thing like Justice League and I in the same way

2052
01:32:56,740 --> 01:33:00,980
with the knots with with fairy tales, it's like it would just be maybe better

2053
01:33:00,980 --> 01:33:03,140
if we didn't have to do two things at once.

2054
01:33:03,820 --> 01:33:07,140
Like like you have to like aim and shoot, but then also just take in

2055
01:33:07,140 --> 01:33:10,860
an insane amount of information that's being thrown at you with 3D

2056
01:33:10,860 --> 01:33:14,340
because like a superhero battle, there's a lot of stuff going on.

2057
01:33:14,700 --> 01:33:18,260
So it's like, what would be better you having to make sure to like shoot at

2058
01:33:18,260 --> 01:33:22,340
little like drone bad guys or pies on the knots thing

2059
01:33:22,500 --> 01:33:26,940
or just having like, again, intimate interactions

2060
01:33:26,940 --> 01:33:30,980
like on Spider-Man with the villains, the villains pop onto the car.

2061
01:33:31,260 --> 01:33:34,820
You get right in their face and then the people leave the ride and they go,

2062
01:33:34,820 --> 01:33:37,340
Oh, I was like nose to nose with Doc Ock.

2063
01:33:37,340 --> 01:33:41,660
Like that's sort of more of what I as a as a rider

2064
01:33:42,100 --> 01:33:46,220
of these rides want. I want to get you know, is to like close enough to like,

2065
01:33:46,260 --> 01:33:49,940
I you know, I could have kissed him, but the mood wasn't right. Yeah.

2066
01:33:50,020 --> 01:33:51,420
I would like to have kiss.

2067
01:33:51,420 --> 01:33:53,820
I would like to kiss every one of the sinister six.

2068
01:33:54,180 --> 01:33:57,740
And you want that right gives me I can I can taste the kiss

2069
01:33:57,980 --> 01:34:00,260
with all of the villains on that ride.

2070
01:34:00,260 --> 01:34:04,900
You want Doc Ock to say like, hello, like the whole car like ET.

2071
01:34:04,940 --> 01:34:08,460
Hello, Peter. Hello, Michael. Hello, Scott.

2072
01:34:09,140 --> 01:34:10,060
Well, you know what, Jason?

2073
01:34:10,060 --> 01:34:13,300
I let me amend that I would like him to say hello to me.

2074
01:34:13,300 --> 01:34:15,900
I would like him to just if there's a technology.

2075
01:34:16,140 --> 01:34:19,300
Technology that can make it so you just heard your name.

2076
01:34:19,340 --> 01:34:22,300
Maybe this is the next leap forward in technology.

2077
01:34:22,500 --> 01:34:25,860
If you could make it so the character only says your name and that's how you hear

2078
01:34:25,860 --> 01:34:27,660
it. And we all hear our own names.

2079
01:34:27,660 --> 01:34:31,220
Then we feel like we're being singled out like Bruce Springsteen,

2080
01:34:31,220 --> 01:34:33,980
Dancing in the Dark, where we're getting like pulled out of the audience

2081
01:34:34,220 --> 01:34:36,300
and singled out by a famous person.

2082
01:34:36,300 --> 01:34:37,980
And now we know we are special.

2083
01:34:37,980 --> 01:34:40,300
Dr. Ock was things I'm special.

2084
01:34:40,300 --> 01:34:43,220
And he would only if he's going to kiss somebody in the ride vehicle,

2085
01:34:43,300 --> 01:34:44,780
he's going to kiss me.

2086
01:34:44,780 --> 01:34:46,340
That's what's going to happen.

2087
01:34:46,340 --> 01:34:50,820
Yeah, you're you're getting singled out to get fucked up by Alfred Molina.

2088
01:34:51,860 --> 01:34:55,220
Well, if it's Molina now, that's a different thing than his general doc.

2089
01:34:55,380 --> 01:34:59,980
But if we yeah, if it's Molina, put Molina in Marvel in the new MCU

2090
01:35:00,180 --> 01:35:05,460
Disney Fied Marvel and and also have him say my name and have us share a moment.

2091
01:35:06,020 --> 01:35:07,940
Sure. So but I have.

2092
01:35:07,940 --> 01:35:12,220
You ever muttered to yourself on these rides, say my name, say my name.

2093
01:35:13,740 --> 01:35:16,300
Moder or enthusiastically yell.

2094
01:35:18,700 --> 01:35:20,700
Either either way, you pick the volume.

2095
01:35:20,700 --> 01:35:22,180
Yeah, it depends.

2096
01:35:22,180 --> 01:35:24,740
It depends what's appropriate and which for which ride.

2097
01:35:24,740 --> 01:35:27,540
If it's just like I can yell it, if it's a smaller ride,

2098
01:35:27,540 --> 01:35:31,300
maybe I just kind of whisper it and like maybe I like kind of blow it away

2099
01:35:31,300 --> 01:35:37,140
and like a kiss to the air to like send a wish, send a wish into the universe.

2100
01:35:37,820 --> 01:35:40,540
The teen next to you is just like, hey, can I go on again?

2101
01:35:40,540 --> 01:35:45,500
This old guy kept mumbling and crying, like when

2102
01:35:45,500 --> 01:35:48,340
characters would show up with blowing kisses.

2103
01:35:49,540 --> 01:35:51,340
He said they're not close enough to him.

2104
01:35:51,340 --> 01:35:53,140
He wants to be nose to nose with them.

2105
01:35:53,140 --> 01:35:54,620
It's what he keeps saying.

2106
01:35:54,620 --> 01:35:57,860
Why am I turning to me and saying I need intimacy?

2107
01:36:00,780 --> 01:36:04,700
You know, who do you who do you want intimacy with on Justice?

2108
01:36:04,740 --> 01:36:06,860
Who do you want a moment with the most?

2109
01:36:07,100 --> 01:36:09,300
Who with for the with the most?

2110
01:36:09,300 --> 01:36:11,700
That's a very good question.

2111
01:36:11,700 --> 01:36:13,820
As far as favorite characters,

2112
01:36:15,340 --> 01:36:19,300
I guess it's so cliche, but I think it has to it has to be.

2113
01:36:19,700 --> 01:36:21,940
Unfortunately, it has to probably be Batman,

2114
01:36:22,300 --> 01:36:26,260
just because there's so many versions of Batman that I'm a big fan of.

2115
01:36:27,220 --> 01:36:29,740
So you could say like, I love you, but thanks.

2116
01:36:30,060 --> 01:36:31,900
Just think the other ones for me, too.

2117
01:36:31,900 --> 01:36:33,100
Just think every Batman.

2118
01:36:33,100 --> 01:36:34,300
If you see him, how about I?

2119
01:36:34,300 --> 01:36:35,140
Yeah, he like Batman.

2120
01:36:35,140 --> 01:36:37,420
I like lean forward, I give him a little kiss on the cheek

2121
01:36:37,420 --> 01:36:39,580
and I go, that's for all of you guys.

2122
01:36:40,100 --> 01:36:44,540
And then I like to share, send that send that to all of them.

2123
01:36:45,700 --> 01:36:46,900
Sorry.

2124
01:36:46,900 --> 01:36:48,460
Sorry about your parents.

2125
01:36:48,460 --> 01:36:51,380
I hope you've had to see less versions than I have.

2126
01:36:54,700 --> 01:36:57,220
Maybe I say maybe if the ride were to break down

2127
01:36:57,220 --> 01:37:00,300
during the point where the character was on the hood of the vehicle,

2128
01:37:00,300 --> 01:37:04,060
I could go like one for Adam, one for Val,

2129
01:37:04,620 --> 01:37:08,100
one for Michael, and then we just keep going along.

2130
01:37:08,820 --> 01:37:10,420
Even for Robert.

2131
01:37:10,420 --> 01:37:12,140
Even. Yes.

2132
01:37:12,140 --> 01:37:16,060
I haven't seen him yet, but I love him already. Exactly.

2133
01:37:16,860 --> 01:37:19,500
So if the ride breaks down, that'll be a good

2134
01:37:19,700 --> 01:37:21,940
that'll be a fun, fun little.

2135
01:37:21,940 --> 01:37:24,580
It's safe to say that was the creepiest moment of the

2136
01:37:24,980 --> 01:37:26,340
all the episodes of this.

2137
01:37:26,340 --> 01:37:30,020
Man, I'm kissing a 3D Batman and thank you.

2138
01:37:30,020 --> 01:37:32,260
You're holding your parents house.

2139
01:37:32,260 --> 01:37:34,020
My parents house.

2140
01:37:34,300 --> 01:37:35,060
They're next.

2141
01:37:35,060 --> 01:37:38,900
If they I like to think your mom has laundry passing by right now.

2142
01:37:39,060 --> 01:37:42,380
No, they've got the glasses on the wall under their ear.

2143
01:37:43,180 --> 01:37:44,220
I do think so.

2144
01:37:44,220 --> 01:37:47,060
There's also a Lou Melnati's pizza order in as well that I'm

2145
01:37:47,980 --> 01:37:50,220
hungering for at this point.

2146
01:37:50,220 --> 01:37:52,060
We keep her Lou.

2147
01:37:52,060 --> 01:37:53,540
He keeps saying he can't

2148
01:37:53,540 --> 01:37:57,900
can't wait to be acquainted with the Robbie Pattinson Batman.

2149
01:37:58,380 --> 01:38:00,540
Honey, do you know what that means?

2150
01:38:00,580 --> 01:38:03,300
If I were to open the door, they're probably right behind.

2151
01:38:03,620 --> 01:38:06,060
They're probably just holding the glass.

2152
01:38:06,060 --> 01:38:07,620
But that was your childhood, though.

2153
01:38:07,620 --> 01:38:09,980
Well, it's a very good point.

2154
01:38:10,980 --> 01:38:12,820
It's a very good point.

2155
01:38:13,540 --> 01:38:15,540
But no, there was a full but I was like bugs.

2156
01:38:15,540 --> 01:38:17,780
It was like the FBI.

2157
01:38:17,780 --> 01:38:19,100
Like I was the people.

2158
01:38:19,100 --> 01:38:21,820
Everyone. All my friends were wires.

2159
01:38:21,820 --> 01:38:25,060
Yeah, they were all.

2160
01:38:25,060 --> 01:38:25,540
Yeah, they were all.

2161
01:38:25,540 --> 01:38:26,620
They were all narks.

2162
01:38:26,620 --> 01:38:27,940
They were all by your mom.

2163
01:38:27,940 --> 01:38:30,460
My mom was paying him each a couple hundred bucks a week.

2164
01:38:31,340 --> 01:38:35,460
To your your mom should talk to the Justice League

2165
01:38:35,460 --> 01:38:38,060
because she was the only one able to outsmart

2166
01:38:38,580 --> 01:38:42,780
the schemes of Jessica to make sure you did not get like

2167
01:38:43,340 --> 01:38:47,500
a hit of dirt weed of like a shitty little Chicago joint.

2168
01:38:48,580 --> 01:38:50,900
Yes, a very good point.

2169
01:38:51,300 --> 01:38:52,140
It's just I don't know.

2170
01:38:52,140 --> 01:38:54,420
Look, if you're if you're going out with Michael tonight, it's just

2171
01:38:54,740 --> 01:38:55,300
here's the thing.

2172
01:38:55,300 --> 01:38:57,580
Eleven years ago, he made little

2173
01:38:58,340 --> 01:39:01,460
sheets out of tissues for the Ghostbusters, and I'm just worried

2174
01:39:01,460 --> 01:39:02,620
he's going to do it again.

2175
01:39:02,620 --> 01:39:03,860
He might do it in your car.

2176
01:39:03,860 --> 01:39:06,500
He might light your car on fire, and I don't want that for you.

2177
01:39:06,500 --> 01:39:08,980
So please tear Mike up.

2178
01:39:09,700 --> 01:39:13,260
Here's a hundred dollars, and I want you to take care of this.

2179
01:39:14,100 --> 01:39:17,860
Yeah, no, I think any all of that stuff is that all happened.

2180
01:39:17,860 --> 01:39:19,420
It's all real. All of it.

2181
01:39:19,420 --> 01:39:22,420
It's was that what the line is real? All of it. It is.

2182
01:39:23,580 --> 01:39:25,260
It's true. It's true. All of it.

2183
01:39:25,260 --> 01:39:27,540
Oh, it's true. All of it.

2184
01:39:27,700 --> 01:39:29,140
Chewie, we're home.

2185
01:39:29,140 --> 01:39:31,140
I have an idea.

2186
01:39:31,140 --> 01:39:33,100
If you're a scientist, I have another question, but that's right.

2187
01:39:33,100 --> 01:39:37,260
There's a bunch of Lex Luther has a bunch of like little bots and.

2188
01:39:37,260 --> 01:39:38,020
Lex box.

2189
01:39:38,020 --> 01:39:39,780
Shoot. Yes, Lex.

2190
01:39:39,780 --> 01:39:40,900
Bots. I called him.

2191
01:39:40,900 --> 01:39:45,060
Isn't this like maybe this is a case of Disney getting there

2192
01:39:45,460 --> 01:39:48,580
after what with the Spidey bots. Right. Exactly.

2193
01:39:48,580 --> 01:39:50,660
Yes, that is the thought I had as well.

2194
01:39:50,660 --> 01:39:53,460
That's very similar, like kind of like faceless drones.

2195
01:39:53,860 --> 01:39:54,500
And it's the same.

2196
01:39:54,500 --> 01:39:57,220
And I seem to Ragnar not to, I guess.

2197
01:39:57,220 --> 01:39:59,220
But like it's like there's endless.

2198
01:39:59,220 --> 01:40:01,460
I mean, I guess we're shooting pies in that version.

2199
01:40:01,940 --> 01:40:05,860
But it is like with these things, I think they feel like they need to make it

2200
01:40:05,860 --> 01:40:11,860
so exciting and so fast that they just want to like throw so many drones

2201
01:40:11,860 --> 01:40:14,420
at you to the point where it's like overwhelming.

2202
01:40:14,900 --> 01:40:19,660
Yeah, I you know, I think that is one of the things I like about the Australian,

2203
01:40:19,660 --> 01:40:22,780
the original iteration of a Justice League ride is that,

2204
01:40:24,220 --> 01:40:27,140
you know, a part of Star of the Conqueror as a character

2205
01:40:27,140 --> 01:40:30,980
is that there's a million weird little starfish aliens everywhere.

2206
01:40:30,980 --> 01:40:34,100
Yes. And that is an ideal target to shoot at.

2207
01:40:34,100 --> 01:40:37,300
And it's so much more interesting than generic robots.

2208
01:40:37,300 --> 01:40:39,540
So I think they should have.

2209
01:40:39,540 --> 01:40:44,340
I think they got more of a budget in America to make this ride and clone it

2210
01:40:44,340 --> 01:40:45,380
so many times.

2211
01:40:45,380 --> 01:40:48,980
And I can see why you would want to put Lex Luther and the Joker in there

2212
01:40:48,980 --> 01:40:50,740
because they're such recognizable characters.

2213
01:40:50,740 --> 01:40:55,060
I think they should have gotten star in there, too, and just gone like all out

2214
01:40:55,060 --> 01:40:55,940
with the bad guys.

2215
01:40:56,180 --> 01:40:59,060
You know what? I think that that's a that's a good plus up.

2216
01:40:59,060 --> 01:41:02,740
I also think that for any of these rides, I think it would be better.

2217
01:41:02,740 --> 01:41:07,620
Like, you know how in I guess Zelda has this where like Link is fighting a big boss

2218
01:41:07,620 --> 01:41:13,060
and there's like elements of now you first have to shoot the bosses like knee caps out.

2219
01:41:13,060 --> 01:41:16,420
Then you have to shoot, you know, something that's like weak, like, OK,

2220
01:41:16,420 --> 01:41:17,940
that knocks off the armor.

2221
01:41:17,940 --> 01:41:22,500
Then now you have like a weakness in the shoulder, like one villain or one boss

2222
01:41:22,500 --> 01:41:25,540
or one task that everyone's trying to complete together.

2223
01:41:25,620 --> 01:41:30,500
I feel like it's better and more memorable than just everybody getting like 200

2224
01:41:30,500 --> 01:41:32,100
Lex bots thrown at their head.

2225
01:41:32,660 --> 01:41:33,380
Does that make sense?

2226
01:41:34,020 --> 01:41:34,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2227
01:41:34,980 --> 01:41:40,740
One more in line with like when there is a big Bowser and you were exactly stop Bowser

2228
01:41:40,740 --> 01:41:45,060
and like, let's yeah, let's take out the floor under him or these little things

2229
01:41:45,060 --> 01:41:45,620
he's throwing out.

2230
01:41:45,620 --> 01:41:47,220
We get rid of those and then we get rid of it.

2231
01:41:47,220 --> 01:41:47,860
Yeah, I don't know.

2232
01:41:47,860 --> 01:41:52,180
I'm not sure why the trend seems to be like little faceless things versus just like one

2233
01:41:52,180 --> 01:41:57,300
character is on the screen for a minute and then in the same way that Toy Story

2234
01:41:57,300 --> 01:42:02,180
Midway Mania is just like a flat kind of playing surface and stuff is fun and happens

2235
01:42:02,180 --> 01:42:02,820
around that.

2236
01:42:02,820 --> 01:42:07,860
Like if you throw the rings around the rocket, all the things shoots up and there's

2237
01:42:07,860 --> 01:42:10,420
different things that are like surprises that can happen.

2238
01:42:10,420 --> 01:42:16,020
But it feels like that's more satisfying than just a pummel, just being pummeled.

2239
01:42:16,660 --> 01:42:20,580
Yeah, I mean, I guess by making it robots, you kind of depersonalize it.

2240
01:42:20,660 --> 01:42:22,660
It's like it's it's just a machine.

2241
01:42:22,660 --> 01:42:24,180
It's not a thing that's alive.

2242
01:42:26,340 --> 01:42:28,580
But the thing is, though, I like about this.

2243
01:42:28,580 --> 01:42:30,740
You can see your beams.

2244
01:42:30,740 --> 01:42:32,500
You can see what you're shooting.

2245
01:42:32,500 --> 01:42:37,860
But then I don't think they really thought it through when the Justice League characters

2246
01:42:37,860 --> 01:42:38,820
show up.

2247
01:42:38,820 --> 01:42:41,860
Everyone immediately just starts shooting Batman in the face.

2248
01:42:41,860 --> 01:42:45,780
Like you just see all the beams immediately go to other characters.

2249
01:42:46,740 --> 01:42:50,820
Yeah, I mean, that's like that's like a professional wrestling show in the late 90s with

2250
01:42:50,820 --> 01:42:52,340
laser pointers, too, though.

2251
01:42:52,340 --> 01:42:53,140
Oh, yeah.

2252
01:42:53,140 --> 01:42:53,620
Yeah.

2253
01:42:53,620 --> 01:42:57,460
Everyone's instinct is just I did not have a laser pointer as a youth.

2254
01:42:57,460 --> 01:43:00,740
That was against the rules and I did not have one.

2255
01:43:00,740 --> 01:43:02,820
No, I was afraid of being blinded.

2256
01:43:02,820 --> 01:43:04,740
I was terrified of being blinded.

2257
01:43:04,740 --> 01:43:07,380
I also was terrified of being blinded by laser pointers.

2258
01:43:07,380 --> 01:43:08,980
Scott, were you terrified of this?

2259
01:43:10,500 --> 01:43:12,660
Was this phenomenon something you didn't experience?

2260
01:43:12,660 --> 01:43:20,420
I feel like I had one and I hate to burst your bubble and then the mythologizing of

2261
01:43:20,420 --> 01:43:25,220
the laser pointer, but I feel like maybe I had one on a pen and used it twice and then

2262
01:43:25,220 --> 01:43:25,860
never again.

2263
01:43:26,820 --> 01:43:32,980
I think it did not maintain as a so I'm saying you weren't missing much.

2264
01:43:32,980 --> 01:43:33,380
I see.

2265
01:43:33,380 --> 01:43:37,860
So you weren't acting like the clown prince of crime with that laser pointer around.

2266
01:43:37,860 --> 01:43:43,540
I did not go out on a freeway overpass and try to start nailing individual cars.

2267
01:43:43,540 --> 01:43:49,940
You didn't go to a local municipal airport and just try to fuck around and find out.

2268
01:43:51,780 --> 01:43:53,700
Try flying to Detroit now.

2269
01:43:54,420 --> 01:43:54,740
Yeah.

2270
01:43:56,020 --> 01:43:56,740
Well, that's good.

2271
01:43:57,540 --> 01:44:01,860
Yeah, which is good because I did have an incredibly powerful laser pointer.

2272
01:44:01,860 --> 01:44:02,660
Of course.

2273
01:44:02,660 --> 01:44:03,300
Yeah.

2274
01:44:03,300 --> 01:44:04,340
Extremely accurate.

2275
01:44:05,140 --> 01:44:06,660
I had like the Luxor light.

2276
01:44:06,740 --> 01:44:07,460
Top of the line.

2277
01:44:10,420 --> 01:44:11,780
Yeah, I knew when not to use it.

2278
01:44:12,740 --> 01:44:15,220
So I was going to say too with that with the I mean, I get it.

2279
01:44:15,220 --> 01:44:20,340
The concern is like you're shooting lasers, like not bullets, which is of course good,

2280
01:44:20,340 --> 01:44:21,780
but like you could shoot batarangs.

2281
01:44:21,780 --> 01:44:22,580
You could shoot.

2282
01:44:22,580 --> 01:44:24,340
There's different things like with Spider-Man.

2283
01:44:24,340 --> 01:44:25,700
You're shooting webs and stuff.

2284
01:44:26,820 --> 01:44:27,460
Yeah.

2285
01:44:27,460 --> 01:44:29,060
You're like web pellets.

2286
01:44:30,340 --> 01:44:34,580
I mentioned this on another episode, but you point out.

2287
01:44:34,580 --> 01:44:36,260
Yeah, you're not shooting bullets.

2288
01:44:36,660 --> 01:44:41,940
There is a sequence like and it's different in other versions like the Great American version.

2289
01:44:42,820 --> 01:44:43,940
The version of Great America.

2290
01:44:44,740 --> 01:44:48,100
There's a thing where a shelf of barrels falls down on you.

2291
01:44:48,100 --> 01:44:53,780
A theme park standby prop barrels, of course, but it is kind of a cool effect.

2292
01:44:53,780 --> 01:44:58,740
It's just some robots in that room, like some industrial looking robots, but at Magic Mountain,

2293
01:44:58,740 --> 01:45:04,180
it's some of the Joker's goons and they just have automatic weapons and they're just firing them

2294
01:45:04,180 --> 01:45:04,980
right at you.

2295
01:45:05,060 --> 01:45:06,340
Like there's no ray gun.

2296
01:45:06,340 --> 01:45:08,900
There's no gas like fog guns.

2297
01:45:08,900 --> 01:45:14,020
It's just like, oh, I don't know if these guys and like purge masks and orange jumpsuits

2298
01:45:14,020 --> 01:45:17,060
firing AKs at me like, I don't know.

2299
01:45:17,060 --> 01:45:20,900
You might have maybe could have cartooned that up a little bit.

2300
01:45:20,900 --> 01:45:25,460
Yeah, I'm worried about this happening to me any day for any reason.

2301
01:45:25,460 --> 01:45:30,100
And so yeah, I'm concerned about this at the ball, the post office, a gas station, you know, anywhere.

2302
01:45:30,660 --> 01:45:32,340
How about a boxing glove gun?

2303
01:45:32,340 --> 01:45:33,860
You know, oh, yeah.

2304
01:45:33,860 --> 01:45:35,700
Boxing glove shooting out of a gun.

2305
01:45:35,700 --> 01:45:36,980
That's that's funny.

2306
01:45:36,980 --> 01:45:38,740
Yeah, we can all say that.

2307
01:45:39,380 --> 01:45:41,220
I'll say this on the complimentary side.

2308
01:45:41,220 --> 01:45:44,820
The Joker on the crazy Joker dune buggy is awesome.

2309
01:45:44,820 --> 01:45:46,020
Like that is 100%.

2310
01:45:46,900 --> 01:45:52,740
The animatronic Joker is on like a dune buggy with it's got a big like gas gun in the front of it.

2311
01:45:53,460 --> 01:45:55,860
And it's a cooled vehicle.

2312
01:45:55,860 --> 01:45:56,740
He looks good.

2313
01:45:57,460 --> 01:45:59,380
It's yeah, I don't know.

2314
01:45:59,380 --> 01:46:02,180
That's obviously that's what I would want more of too.

2315
01:46:02,180 --> 01:46:05,700
Obviously, if I was plussing up as well, robots of everybody.

2316
01:46:05,700 --> 01:46:09,940
But, you know, look, that's more than we get on the Spider-Man ride in Orlando.

2317
01:46:09,940 --> 01:46:14,180
I mean, yeah, we have Cyborg, we have him and then Harley Quinn sometimes.

2318
01:46:15,140 --> 01:46:20,820
In in Magic Mountain, there's a simpler Harley Quinn animatronic at the end who blasts you with gas.

2319
01:46:20,820 --> 01:46:24,820
At the end of all versions, the you get blasted with gas.

2320
01:46:24,820 --> 01:46:25,060
Right.

2321
01:46:25,060 --> 01:46:28,900
But maybe Harley's only Magic Mountain because it was the last one open.

2322
01:46:28,900 --> 01:46:32,820
So we like there's more there's more scenes, the scenes that are only there.

2323
01:46:32,820 --> 01:46:37,140
Yeah, yeah, I think she was the addition for Magic Mountain and she looks pretty good.

2324
01:46:37,140 --> 01:46:39,220
I mean, yeah, simpler than the Joker.

2325
01:46:39,220 --> 01:46:44,020
But one last Harley Quinn, you know, for the locals, local hero Harley Quinn.

2326
01:46:46,580 --> 01:46:49,700
I'll see you on the bumper of the car I'm driving behind.

2327
01:46:50,500 --> 01:46:53,060
See at the mayor's office, Harley Quinn, Harley.

2328
01:46:53,220 --> 01:46:59,860
And so I mean, it seems like the feedback is more positive than not.

2329
01:46:59,860 --> 01:47:05,140
And it seems like like maybe higher quality than you than you might expect from Six Flags.

2330
01:47:05,140 --> 01:47:13,460
Yeah, I also have to get Six Flags credit in the their front of the line offering is called Flash

2331
01:47:13,460 --> 01:47:19,620
Pass. And, you know, I like the use of the flash. He does run very fast.

2332
01:47:19,620 --> 01:47:24,900
But also, I just appreciate the like skirting the legalities because Flash Pass just sounds

2333
01:47:24,900 --> 01:47:30,740
like you mush mouthed Fast Pass a little. And it's like, you know what? And that's,

2334
01:47:30,740 --> 01:47:34,580
you know, he was the original lightning lane, let's be honest, because the flash is surrounded

2335
01:47:34,580 --> 01:47:40,900
by lightning from the speed force. So, you know, there's give and take in the theme park world.

2336
01:47:40,900 --> 01:47:43,060
You know, right. Everyone steals fast pass.

2337
01:47:43,060 --> 01:47:44,180
Snooze you lose.

2338
01:47:44,180 --> 01:47:49,380
Yeah, it is up in the air now. It is fair game.

2339
01:47:50,100 --> 01:47:52,180
That's how copyright works. Correct.

2340
01:47:52,180 --> 01:47:56,980
Yeah, you stop using it actively. It can be used by anyone.

2341
01:47:56,980 --> 01:48:01,620
We should use it. We should use it for something for our purposes. See when Disney gets at us.

2342
01:48:02,740 --> 01:48:06,100
Yeah. Well, what can we offer that's Fast Pass?

2343
01:48:07,940 --> 01:48:15,460
Is there a way to if we created a way to only hear pertinent info about the ride that is our

2344
01:48:15,460 --> 01:48:23,140
topic that day and to skip tangents, which would thus reduce the episodes to about 23 minutes per.

2345
01:48:24,660 --> 01:48:28,020
If that was something the audience does, I now I don't know how to program it.

2346
01:48:28,740 --> 01:48:31,540
Some computer whiz, but maybe that is our Fast Pass.

2347
01:48:31,540 --> 01:48:33,620
Okay. Skip past the tangents.

2348
01:48:34,180 --> 01:48:36,500
Yeah. Any time past the childhood stories.

2349
01:48:36,500 --> 01:48:39,860
I decided to check our reviews yesterday. Actually, it's funny enough, which I don't

2350
01:48:39,860 --> 01:48:42,100
do that often. Oh, great idea.

2351
01:48:42,740 --> 01:48:46,260
Well, honestly, the reviews on Apple podcasts are really good. It's real positive.

2352
01:48:47,380 --> 01:48:51,380
Except somebody was like four stars out of not four out of five, not five out of five.

2353
01:48:51,380 --> 01:48:53,780
And they're like, these tangents go on too long.

2354
01:48:54,420 --> 01:48:59,780
And I'm like, look, we've done it this long. Welcome to your first comedy podcast.

2355
01:48:59,780 --> 01:49:03,540
It ain't getting any easier. We're not getting we're not going to change now.

2356
01:49:03,540 --> 01:49:07,700
Maybe if maybe if we saw this within the first six weeks, maybe we would have overhauled the

2357
01:49:07,700 --> 01:49:09,460
whole thing. But at this point, sorry.

2358
01:49:10,340 --> 01:49:13,860
But thanks for listening. Thanks for the four stars. Four stars is not one star.

2359
01:49:14,740 --> 01:49:16,900
So no way. Fuck this guy.

2360
01:49:16,900 --> 01:49:17,540
All right. Fine.

2361
01:49:19,380 --> 01:49:21,540
And you're right. You're right. You're right.

2362
01:49:21,540 --> 01:49:23,460
It's got to get us anymore.

2363
01:49:23,460 --> 01:49:26,500
I was trying to be nameless. I'll edit out the part where I said it's okay.

2364
01:49:27,220 --> 01:49:30,340
That's right. You won't hear that praise.

2365
01:49:31,140 --> 01:49:35,140
Yeah, no tangents that much. I know the right.

2366
01:49:35,140 --> 01:49:37,940
I'll say you have to you have to free the Justice League.

2367
01:49:39,220 --> 01:49:40,900
Yeah. Also, I go back.

2368
01:49:40,900 --> 01:49:42,660
I made a mistake earlier. I said there was an empty room.

2369
01:49:42,660 --> 01:49:46,260
There is a room with statues of the just of the of the Holy Trinity,

2370
01:49:46,980 --> 01:49:51,300
which is Superman, Wonder Woman and Batman, which I like the statues.

2371
01:49:51,300 --> 01:49:54,180
I think that is a cool spot in the room.

2372
01:49:55,140 --> 01:49:59,300
My feeling of the experience, I think, when I said it was empty is because,

2373
01:49:59,300 --> 01:50:03,540
as I said on the other episode, there's no employees in the first two rooms to direct

2374
01:50:03,540 --> 01:50:05,860
you where to go. It feels very lawless.

2375
01:50:06,900 --> 01:50:10,500
So in my memory, I forgot that those statues are in there, which I really I like.

2376
01:50:11,060 --> 01:50:13,780
And then at the end of the ride, you get to free the Justice League and they help you,

2377
01:50:13,780 --> 01:50:19,460
basically, before you go on that like very Spider-Man style behind the thing,

2378
01:50:20,180 --> 01:50:22,420
which I like. I like that you're helping.

2379
01:50:22,420 --> 01:50:24,100
I like that. That's good.

2380
01:50:24,100 --> 01:50:26,420
So that's really all I had to say about the rest of the ride.

2381
01:50:26,980 --> 01:50:29,460
Yeah. You have to see everyone use their powers a little.

2382
01:50:30,020 --> 01:50:33,060
At the end, they all do like a hero pose and they thank you.

2383
01:50:33,540 --> 01:50:35,220
Say your honorary members now.

2384
01:50:35,220 --> 01:50:36,580
Right, which is good. It's not quite.

2385
01:50:36,580 --> 01:50:37,700
I feel so good.

2386
01:50:37,700 --> 01:50:42,420
It's not quite the Transformers experience, but it is pretty close.

2387
01:50:42,420 --> 01:50:45,780
The flesh thanked me. They said I could join me.

2388
01:50:47,140 --> 01:50:48,260
Intimacy.

2389
01:50:48,260 --> 01:50:49,620
You could say me. Yes.

2390
01:50:50,340 --> 01:50:52,260
Does it give you does it give you that tingle?

2391
01:50:52,260 --> 01:50:55,060
Does it give you that that intimacy tingle that you want?

2392
01:50:55,060 --> 01:50:58,420
Well, I haven't done as I said, the one the time I went on the ride,

2393
01:50:58,420 --> 01:51:01,940
the glasses were not given to us by the employee.

2394
01:51:02,900 --> 01:51:07,060
So when I watch the video, I do I do feel it.

2395
01:51:07,060 --> 01:51:11,300
I can feel it. But when I go, which again, soon is looking like it'll happen,

2396
01:51:12,340 --> 01:51:16,740
I will report back if it feels as good as I hope it does, as it seems.

2397
01:51:16,740 --> 01:51:20,580
Yeah. Well, just like I don't know if your like hairs stand up

2398
01:51:20,580 --> 01:51:22,980
from the back of your head or on your I don't know what how

2399
01:51:24,180 --> 01:51:27,460
to measure your excitement about intimacy.

2400
01:51:27,460 --> 01:51:31,060
I don't know how you measure your tingle, but send us a photo.

2401
01:51:31,060 --> 01:51:34,260
How if something physically happens to your body?

2402
01:51:34,260 --> 01:51:37,060
How do you that sounds like some sort of market?

2403
01:51:37,060 --> 01:51:38,580
How do you measure your tingle?

2404
01:51:40,420 --> 01:51:44,820
Like that one way could be flags and the more flags there are.

2405
01:51:44,820 --> 01:51:46,580
Flags more tingle. Yeah.

2406
01:51:46,580 --> 01:51:48,020
Is really how you got out.

2407
01:51:48,020 --> 01:51:51,380
Scott, unfortunately, had the three to four flag experience.

2408
01:51:52,580 --> 01:51:53,620
That's about correct.

2409
01:51:54,580 --> 01:51:57,540
But at least I mean, the very first time I went to Magic Mountain.

2410
01:51:58,180 --> 01:52:05,380
Oh, God, probably like 15, 14, 15 years ago, I got I was it was so hot.

2411
01:52:05,380 --> 01:52:08,740
And I was like, I never complain about like, oh, God, it's so hot.

2412
01:52:08,740 --> 01:52:12,820
And I got home and the news was like, it's the hottest day of 2008.

2413
01:52:13,380 --> 01:52:16,580
And it was like, oh, my like sandals are flip flop.

2414
01:52:16,580 --> 01:52:21,460
Like whatever shoes I had with me had melted like the glue was separating.

2415
01:52:21,460 --> 01:52:24,740
And I was like, well, that might be is that the goo people's sandals have melted?

2416
01:52:24,740 --> 01:52:28,260
And there's just like melted sandal goo everywhere in the six flags.

2417
01:52:28,260 --> 01:52:32,660
Oh, my God, is the goo just like, you know, remainder old Navy,

2418
01:52:32,660 --> 01:52:35,700
like four dollar flip flops that have just been kicked off.

2419
01:52:35,700 --> 01:52:38,020
Yeah, like torch.

2420
01:52:38,020 --> 01:52:42,900
Yeah, I would heal rubber is just stuck on the pavement and no one's cleaned it.

2421
01:52:44,820 --> 01:52:49,060
Like, who could be enough to run a test on the goo, get the goo to a lab.

2422
01:52:49,060 --> 01:52:50,020
Well, we'll test them.

2423
01:52:51,700 --> 01:52:52,820
Well, you know what?

2424
01:52:52,820 --> 01:52:57,700
I'm like, you know, having having said some some not great things,

2425
01:52:57,700 --> 01:53:01,060
the less than four star rating for my day at the park.

2426
01:53:01,060 --> 01:53:04,260
I mean, I think I was impacted by not getting this.

2427
01:53:04,820 --> 01:53:06,100
This is what I wanted to see.

2428
01:53:07,700 --> 01:53:10,660
Probably would have bumped up my rating.

2429
01:53:10,660 --> 01:53:13,460
It sounds like this is sounds like the same bad.

2430
01:53:13,460 --> 01:53:17,700
Yeah, it's especially like, again, it was the only game in town at the six flags.

2431
01:53:17,700 --> 01:53:20,500
Like you're going to go, yeah, this is like a dark ride.

2432
01:53:20,740 --> 01:53:22,980
And this is it's not a shabby one.

2433
01:53:22,980 --> 01:53:25,540
It's like it's got a pretty high production value.

2434
01:53:27,220 --> 01:53:30,580
It's not as good as Orlando Spider-Man, but nothing almost is at this,

2435
01:53:30,580 --> 01:53:31,700
like still at this point.

2436
01:53:33,060 --> 01:53:34,340
Let me read this statement.

2437
01:53:34,340 --> 01:53:37,540
This is by somebody I believe from Sally Dark Rides.

2438
01:53:37,540 --> 01:53:42,580
And just just to react to this, Spider-Man was really our bar.

2439
01:53:42,580 --> 01:53:44,100
That was where we always strive to be.

2440
01:53:44,100 --> 01:53:47,620
If that was the best dark ride in the industry, we needed to reach that bar.

2441
01:53:47,620 --> 01:53:49,620
And Justice League has exceeded it.

2442
01:53:50,500 --> 01:53:55,140
Well, that's I don't know if I would agree because it doesn't.

2443
01:53:55,700 --> 01:53:58,900
You know, there's a great simplicity to the Spider-Man ride.

2444
01:53:58,900 --> 01:54:03,780
And yeah, there's a there's maybe an overreach on Justice League where it's very busy.

2445
01:54:04,420 --> 01:54:08,980
And it's like there's there's it's kind of maybe weighed down a little by the interactivity.

2446
01:54:09,700 --> 01:54:11,860
You know, yeah, yeah, that's what I think.

2447
01:54:11,860 --> 01:54:12,580
Yes, I agree.

2448
01:54:12,580 --> 01:54:13,140
Too busy.

2449
01:54:13,700 --> 01:54:15,540
The experience is a little more complicated.

2450
01:54:16,500 --> 01:54:20,260
The ride vehicle is not as good as the Spider-Man.

2451
01:54:20,260 --> 01:54:22,100
If you just it's not quite.

2452
01:54:22,100 --> 01:54:24,660
Yeah, that thing has got a lot of tricks up its sleeve.

2453
01:54:24,660 --> 01:54:25,460
Yeah.

2454
01:54:25,460 --> 01:54:30,100
And that thing I've said this before, like I went on Transformers not even that long ago.

2455
01:54:30,100 --> 01:54:36,900
I was like, it really feels like like a 300 pound robot has slammed its fist on the vehicle.

2456
01:54:36,900 --> 01:54:38,500
And I don't know how it does that.

2457
01:54:38,500 --> 01:54:40,580
Like, I feel such a strong impact.

2458
01:54:40,580 --> 01:54:45,940
But if it truly was like the force that I think it is, it would rip the like the car in half.

2459
01:54:45,940 --> 01:54:52,180
It's just so everything about it just like makes you like your body feel the actual weight of

2460
01:54:52,180 --> 01:54:56,260
the Optimus Prime or whoever Megatron or whoever's attacking you and Optimus Prime.

2461
01:54:56,260 --> 01:54:56,820
He's our friend.

2462
01:54:56,820 --> 01:54:57,460
He doesn't attack.

2463
01:54:59,220 --> 01:55:00,740
But yeah, those vehicles are awesome.

2464
01:55:00,740 --> 01:55:01,860
And these vehicles are good.

2465
01:55:01,860 --> 01:55:02,500
They're fine.

2466
01:55:02,500 --> 01:55:05,300
But it's not as good as Spider-Man vehicle.

2467
01:55:05,940 --> 01:55:06,580
Yeah, yeah.

2468
01:55:07,140 --> 01:55:08,020
No, those are amazing.

2469
01:55:08,020 --> 01:55:09,780
Yeah, because they can make you feel like.

2470
01:55:09,860 --> 01:55:14,500
Yeah, you're getting punched by a robot or, you know, if they wanted to include a scene

2471
01:55:14,500 --> 01:55:21,300
where Optimus Prime lifts you up to where his heart should be and holds you close to his chest

2472
01:55:21,300 --> 01:55:28,420
and says, were I to have a heart, it would be beating harder than ever for you, Michael, my son.

2473
01:55:28,420 --> 01:55:32,100
I consider you my son after what you've after your bravery this day.

2474
01:55:33,300 --> 01:55:36,820
And he's he's removed me from the car somehow.

2475
01:55:36,820 --> 01:55:38,660
That's if they could do that technology too.

2476
01:55:39,380 --> 01:55:40,340
You all go home.

2477
01:55:40,340 --> 01:55:41,700
The rest of you riffraff.

2478
01:55:41,700 --> 01:55:43,220
I need some time with Michael.

2479
01:55:43,940 --> 01:55:48,260
If you know, like in the Cars Land ride where you can go one is the spray down

2480
01:55:48,260 --> 01:55:51,940
and one is the wheels or the excuse me, spray paint.

2481
01:55:52,580 --> 01:55:56,660
If there were two paths at the end of Transformers, one where the car breaks off

2482
01:55:56,660 --> 01:56:01,860
and it's just me in a little car and then the other what seven people or what is it?

2483
01:56:01,860 --> 01:56:02,740
How many people in there?

2484
01:56:02,740 --> 01:56:07,060
Twelve, eleven, whatever it is, they go in the other way and I get to have that

2485
01:56:07,060 --> 01:56:09,940
and I get to feel his beating robot heart.

2486
01:56:09,940 --> 01:56:11,940
Well, it's like being asked to the after party.

2487
01:56:11,940 --> 01:56:15,300
So like you want to hang a little hang back.

2488
01:56:17,940 --> 01:56:22,820
He slips me a note during the middle of the ride to he's like, here's where the real party is.

2489
01:56:25,460 --> 01:56:27,060
Anyway, I'll spark this.

2490
01:56:27,060 --> 01:56:27,780
I'll spark that.

2491
01:56:27,780 --> 01:56:28,340
How are you?

2492
01:56:30,340 --> 01:56:32,020
Look, I'm not looking okay with your mom.

2493
01:56:32,020 --> 01:56:34,660
I'm not looking for a romantic relation with Optimus Prime.

2494
01:56:34,660 --> 01:56:36,260
I'm just looking for acknowledgement.

2495
01:56:36,900 --> 01:56:40,420
It's like a mentor uncle, like sort of like cool uncle.

2496
01:56:40,420 --> 01:56:42,900
A cool uncle relationship is what I'm looking for.

2497
01:56:42,900 --> 01:56:44,420
I'm not looking to be his lover.

2498
01:56:45,140 --> 01:56:50,100
Michael, don't tell your mother, but here is a Bud Light, a single Bud Light can.

2499
01:56:51,060 --> 01:56:53,860
Like comes out of it like a dispenser from his chest.

2500
01:56:54,420 --> 01:56:56,660
Yeah, it's icy cold.

2501
01:56:56,660 --> 01:56:58,020
My chest is a cooler.

2502
01:56:59,140 --> 01:57:02,100
You're very mature and 37.

2503
01:57:02,100 --> 01:57:03,700
I believe you can have this now.

2504
01:57:04,660 --> 01:57:06,180
And now he seems like he's bad.

2505
01:57:06,180 --> 01:57:07,700
Now you're making it seem like he's bad.

2506
01:57:08,500 --> 01:57:12,100
He's kind of no, he's saying like I maybe waited too long.

2507
01:57:12,100 --> 01:57:14,980
I probably could have, you know, you were always a good kid.

2508
01:57:14,980 --> 01:57:18,660
We wanted to make sure you didn't go down the wrong path like that, Heather.

2509
01:57:22,500 --> 01:57:23,940
Fire a shotgun with me.

2510
01:57:25,860 --> 01:57:28,420
Like I don't think we should be doing this, Optimus.

2511
01:57:28,420 --> 01:57:30,020
I don't think no.

2512
01:57:30,020 --> 01:57:30,660
Come on.

2513
01:57:30,660 --> 01:57:31,380
It's cool.

2514
01:57:31,380 --> 01:57:32,340
Everything's fine.

2515
01:57:32,980 --> 01:57:34,020
I thought you were cool.

2516
01:57:36,500 --> 01:57:38,580
I guess you not wanted to be with me.

2517
01:57:39,620 --> 01:57:42,180
I guess I should have picked the guy next to you in the right vehicle.

2518
01:57:42,180 --> 01:57:43,940
No, no, no, no.

2519
01:57:43,940 --> 01:57:45,140
I was the right one.

2520
01:57:45,140 --> 01:57:46,580
I was the right one to pick.

2521
01:57:46,580 --> 01:57:48,500
Okay, well, shoot the gun then.

2522
01:57:49,780 --> 01:57:50,820
Right answer.

2523
01:57:50,820 --> 01:57:52,900
Now, next step, let's go.

2524
01:57:52,900 --> 01:57:53,940
Rob a bank.

2525
01:57:53,940 --> 01:57:59,700
Whoa, hey, Optimus, and you're going to be the one whose faces on the camera.

2526
01:57:59,700 --> 01:58:00,580
Wait a minute.

2527
01:58:01,540 --> 01:58:09,460
Oh, so look, this could very well be the ending, but I want to we've been going a little long,

2528
01:58:09,460 --> 01:58:12,100
but I want to I want to throw one more thing in here.

2529
01:58:13,540 --> 01:58:21,300
And that is that Jason, you mentioned it earlier that this ride won a the award

2530
01:58:21,300 --> 01:58:25,620
as presented by the Tia or the T.E.A.

2531
01:58:26,260 --> 01:58:30,740
The T.E.A. presents the T.H.E.A. awards.

2532
01:58:30,740 --> 01:58:31,780
It's very tidy.

2533
01:58:32,980 --> 01:58:33,940
No problems there.

2534
01:58:35,140 --> 01:58:38,660
So we haven't brought up these awards in a long time.

2535
01:58:38,660 --> 01:58:40,420
I feel like they used to come up here and there,

2536
01:58:41,060 --> 01:58:46,820
specifically the desire among some of the hosts to get involved in this.

2537
01:58:46,820 --> 01:58:48,180
Host the awards show.

2538
01:58:48,180 --> 01:58:48,820
Floral.

2539
01:58:48,820 --> 01:58:49,460
Yeah.

2540
01:58:49,460 --> 01:58:50,260
Yeah, yes.

2541
01:58:51,140 --> 01:58:52,740
We want to host the T.E.A.s.

2542
01:58:52,740 --> 01:58:55,460
To be a part of the show, maybe host to the show.

2543
01:58:55,460 --> 01:58:57,460
You guys went to you tried to go to it.

2544
01:58:57,460 --> 01:59:02,900
Speaking of after parties, you like hung around these anonymous theme park

2545
01:59:02,900 --> 01:59:06,420
and street employees who designed rides and stuff.

2546
01:59:06,420 --> 01:59:11,140
We were notably the ones not in tuxedos at the Tancarola Terrace.

2547
01:59:11,140 --> 01:59:16,740
But, you know, Friar Tux, a local L.A. establishment, has my measurements on file.

2548
01:59:16,740 --> 01:59:22,020
So if the call comes, if they go in person again, you'll be there.

2549
01:59:23,060 --> 01:59:25,460
And I here's what I have to say about this.

2550
01:59:25,460 --> 01:59:28,740
I got curious and I was like, so they won an award.

2551
01:59:28,740 --> 01:59:29,060
Huh?

2552
01:59:29,060 --> 01:59:34,900
I wonder if that was interesting or if that's, you know, if that aired anywhere.

2553
01:59:35,780 --> 01:59:39,060
And now I have seen basically I looked up the twenty nineteen

2554
01:59:40,100 --> 01:59:44,500
the awards where Justice League won an award and I was expecting, you know,

2555
01:59:44,500 --> 01:59:48,100
I got a lot of what I was expecting, a lot of like kind of dry discussion

2556
01:59:48,100 --> 01:59:49,940
people I've never seen before.

2557
01:59:50,740 --> 01:59:52,420
Just, you know, people thanking their team.

2558
01:59:52,420 --> 01:59:53,140
And it is what it is.

2559
01:59:53,140 --> 01:59:57,380
It's a nice little internal thing, but it maybe wasn't as fun as I thought it would be

2560
01:59:57,380 --> 01:59:59,620
until I'm going to show you this.

2561
01:59:59,620 --> 02:00:02,260
And this has changed my feelings about the awards.

2562
02:00:02,260 --> 02:00:03,060
Now I'm all it.

2563
02:00:03,060 --> 02:00:08,260
Now I want as much interaction with them as possible, because here's what happened

2564
02:00:08,260 --> 02:00:12,180
when the Justice League ride was honored.

2565
02:00:12,180 --> 02:00:15,940
And I'll narrate anything that's not clear to you, the audience.

2566
02:00:17,300 --> 02:00:21,380
We are humbled to know that our industry peers think us worthy of this great acknowledgement.

2567
02:00:21,460 --> 02:00:22,660
Thank you very much.

2568
02:00:25,300 --> 02:00:27,380
Ladies and gentlemen, they're here.

2569
02:00:28,100 --> 02:00:31,060
Give it up for the Justice League.

2570
02:00:31,060 --> 02:00:32,020
Oh, hell yes.

2571
02:00:32,020 --> 02:00:35,300
The two tux guys on stage now are kind of standing around

2572
02:00:35,860 --> 02:00:38,260
on a pretty modest stage at the Disneyland Hotel.

2573
02:00:38,260 --> 02:00:44,180
But then Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, pretty theme park.

2574
02:00:44,180 --> 02:00:48,500
That's right, ladies and gentlemen, they're here to help you with your selfies

2575
02:00:48,500 --> 02:00:51,220
as we now will take a 20 minute intermission.

2576
02:00:51,540 --> 02:00:57,460
And watch your wristbands, because when they flash red, it's time for Act Two.

2577
02:00:58,180 --> 02:00:58,660
Thank you.

2578
02:01:01,460 --> 02:01:06,580
Now the three characters kind of the whole the Trinity here, they kind of like mill about

2579
02:01:06,580 --> 02:01:07,620
aren't sure what to do.

2580
02:01:08,260 --> 02:01:09,620
Well, should we go in the audience?

2581
02:01:09,620 --> 02:01:15,300
OK, and they slowly walk down some precarious steps to take selfies

2582
02:01:15,300 --> 02:01:17,620
with the park industry veterans.

2583
02:01:17,620 --> 02:01:20,980
That is actually that's great operational.

2584
02:01:22,340 --> 02:01:28,100
That's a great operational move because 20 minutes, everyone's going to make a beeline

2585
02:01:28,100 --> 02:01:29,060
for the bar.

2586
02:01:29,060 --> 02:01:32,580
But if you can distract some of the people who would be going to the bar,

2587
02:01:32,580 --> 02:01:34,260
that'll cut down on the line.

2588
02:01:34,820 --> 02:01:38,420
And that's why these, you know, that's why these people are the best.

2589
02:01:38,420 --> 02:01:41,380
But they're what they do is like organized crowds.

2590
02:01:41,380 --> 02:01:42,740
Some go here, some go here.

2591
02:01:42,740 --> 02:01:44,500
Well, yeah, yeah, it's really on display.

2592
02:01:45,140 --> 02:01:48,100
They can't even put it to rest when it's their time to party.

2593
02:01:48,180 --> 02:01:51,780
Now, the real nerds among us would know, I think it is a very funny choice

2594
02:01:51,780 --> 02:01:55,220
because Wonder Woman of those three was the only original Justice League member,

2595
02:01:55,220 --> 02:02:00,180
Batman, Superman, not originally in the very first iteration of Justice League.

2596
02:02:00,180 --> 02:02:03,140
And in the 90s, it was a lot of BNC list characters, too.

2597
02:02:03,780 --> 02:02:05,940
And then Grant Morrison, of course, and then Grant Morrison.

2598
02:02:06,740 --> 02:02:08,180
Yeah, he put Catwoman on the team.

2599
02:02:08,180 --> 02:02:09,860
He put hunters on the team.

2600
02:02:09,860 --> 02:02:11,220
Yeah, you got to have the pantheon.

2601
02:02:11,220 --> 02:02:12,260
You got to have the big knee.

2602
02:02:13,380 --> 02:02:15,220
Aztec, the ultimate man who became.

2603
02:02:15,220 --> 02:02:15,620
Yeah.

2604
02:02:15,940 --> 02:02:22,420
One thing fighting all that is that they had the budget for the Anaheim actors to show up.

2605
02:02:22,420 --> 02:02:26,340
They look pretty good for like an award show selfie.

2606
02:02:26,340 --> 02:02:26,900
Yeah.

2607
02:02:26,900 --> 02:02:31,860
So the whole so like a lot of these are pretty dry,

2608
02:02:31,860 --> 02:02:34,580
but I flipped through because some of them are in full on YouTube.

2609
02:02:34,580 --> 02:02:35,460
There's that sense.

2610
02:02:36,260 --> 02:02:37,060
Yeah, a little bit.

2611
02:02:37,060 --> 02:02:40,740
Yeah, there is a thing in the in the Guardians mission breakout year.

2612
02:02:40,740 --> 02:02:44,980
There's a thing where the Guardians of the Galaxy land on stage

2613
02:02:45,540 --> 02:02:50,740
and kind of like roast the people who the people in the room know.

2614
02:02:51,940 --> 02:02:56,260
There's yeah, there's some like Billy Crystal type award show stuff.

2615
02:02:57,300 --> 02:02:58,660
And there's one more clip.

2616
02:02:58,660 --> 02:03:02,100
This is how that year opened the 2019.

2617
02:03:03,700 --> 02:03:09,940
And I'm going to watch the volume on this, but audience just prepare your ears anyway.

2618
02:03:09,940 --> 02:03:13,700
So what happened at the beginning of this award show

2619
02:03:13,700 --> 02:03:21,780
is that a bunch of like teens and muted grays, nicely dressed all come out.

2620
02:03:21,780 --> 02:03:24,980
And this is the this is the sound they collectively make.

2621
02:03:44,580 --> 02:03:49,460
As the screen with the word innovation plays.

2622
02:03:49,460 --> 02:03:53,460
And then it's some way they turn to the screen and then turn back from the screen.

2623
02:04:00,020 --> 02:04:05,140
See, now that's a perfect theme park accompaniment because it's like got some gravitas.

2624
02:04:05,140 --> 02:04:08,660
It's got some air to it, but it is very copyright free.

2625
02:04:08,660 --> 02:04:10,580
So no one's getting sued on this one.

2626
02:04:11,540 --> 02:04:13,940
Not a word, not one word.

2627
02:04:13,940 --> 02:04:17,380
Oh, yes. A bunch of teens sing a wordless song at you.

2628
02:04:20,340 --> 02:04:24,420
When we I want to re declare right now that we want to host the awards.

2629
02:04:24,420 --> 02:04:27,540
Yeah, I want to bring back the things before I want to.

2630
02:04:27,540 --> 02:04:28,260
I want all in.

2631
02:04:28,260 --> 02:04:29,460
We want to bring the teams back.

2632
02:04:29,460 --> 02:04:31,860
We want to bring the Holy Trinity back.

2633
02:04:31,860 --> 02:04:33,220
Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman.

2634
02:04:33,220 --> 02:04:34,500
It doesn't matter what ride wins.

2635
02:04:34,980 --> 02:04:36,420
We're ready to do it.

2636
02:04:38,500 --> 02:04:41,700
I want the teens to beat up the Justice League.

2637
02:04:41,700 --> 02:04:42,020
Yes.

2638
02:04:42,020 --> 02:04:42,740
While singing.

2639
02:04:44,660 --> 02:04:49,860
Yeah, I mean, the comics industry learned this years ago with the big comic book awards,

2640
02:04:49,860 --> 02:04:52,020
the Eisner Awards that give out a comic con every year.

2641
02:04:52,660 --> 02:04:55,060
We're always a very long, boring affair.

2642
02:04:55,060 --> 02:04:58,740
So in recent years, like you've gotten there's been like a Tom Lennon

2643
02:04:59,220 --> 02:05:06,100
and other comics have like presented awards and like kind of livened it up a little

2644
02:05:06,100 --> 02:05:09,780
because as you can imagine, a room full of people who spend most of their time like

2645
02:05:09,780 --> 02:05:14,580
typing on a computer or drawing at a drafting board isn't necessarily the most lively.

2646
02:05:15,140 --> 02:05:17,860
You know, well, they're going to be lively when Scott starts.

2647
02:05:17,860 --> 02:05:23,860
It's so wonderful night for Thea, Thea, Thea, who will win.

2648
02:05:25,300 --> 02:05:27,460
You know, that's going to ride in the mud.

2649
02:05:27,460 --> 02:05:31,380
Tonight are or we do a video where we're in all the rides.

2650
02:05:31,380 --> 02:05:34,580
It's us in the rides with other famous podcasters.

2651
02:05:35,300 --> 02:05:36,660
Oh, yes.

2652
02:05:36,660 --> 02:05:37,060
Yes.

2653
02:05:37,940 --> 02:05:38,580
That's good.

2654
02:05:38,580 --> 02:05:40,020
John Gaber is.

2655
02:05:40,020 --> 02:05:41,380
Yeah, we do.

2656
02:05:41,380 --> 02:05:44,820
We we take a head off one of the storm troopers in that room and rise.

2657
02:05:44,820 --> 02:05:45,780
The resistance.

2658
02:05:45,780 --> 02:05:46,660
There you go.

2659
02:05:46,660 --> 02:05:48,820
John Gaber is how did you get here?

2660
02:05:48,820 --> 02:05:50,500
Hondo Anaka is replaced with Mitch.

2661
02:05:52,980 --> 02:05:53,700
Okay, all right.

2662
02:05:53,700 --> 02:05:55,140
Got to go get the coaxium.

2663
02:05:55,140 --> 02:05:57,140
You got to get that fucking coaxium.

2664
02:05:58,500 --> 02:06:00,740
Oh, this is I hate this land.

2665
02:06:01,780 --> 02:06:04,900
Paying off one of the valet guys at the Disneyland Hotel.

2666
02:06:04,900 --> 02:06:07,540
Okay, Jason said too mean of a joke about Bob Chaypack.

2667
02:06:07,540 --> 02:06:08,180
Get him.

2668
02:06:08,180 --> 02:06:10,740
Pull a sedan around and get him the fuck out of here.

2669
02:06:12,180 --> 02:06:21,060
Yeah, look, the so many opportunities for for like, like iconic, amazing, long lasting comedy at these Thea's.

2670
02:06:21,780 --> 02:06:22,740
So hire us.

2671
02:06:22,740 --> 02:06:23,460
We're ready.

2672
02:06:23,540 --> 02:06:24,260
So hire us.

2673
02:06:24,260 --> 02:06:25,220
Yeah, we're ready.

2674
02:06:26,820 --> 02:06:31,220
Yeah, I'll start working of some kind of Poe Dameron related song parody.

2675
02:06:31,940 --> 02:06:32,500
What's new?

2676
02:06:32,500 --> 02:06:35,940
I guess I got to do a song about like about web slingers.

2677
02:06:38,020 --> 02:06:43,540
And if I'm going by Billy Crystal rules, it has to be like a song from the 1940s.

2678
02:06:43,540 --> 02:06:44,420
So you write.

2679
02:06:44,420 --> 02:06:45,300
Yes, right, right.

2680
02:06:45,300 --> 02:06:50,180
Must have been a beautiful slinger because baby, that's a beautiful web.

2681
02:06:50,580 --> 02:06:53,860
That's who we sing this song, dude.

2682
02:06:58,180 --> 02:06:59,060
Oh, man.

2683
02:07:01,380 --> 02:07:02,660
Well, yeah, all right.

2684
02:07:02,660 --> 02:07:03,300
That's it.

2685
02:07:03,300 --> 02:07:03,860
We're in.

2686
02:07:03,860 --> 02:07:04,500
We're doing it.

2687
02:07:04,500 --> 02:07:04,900
We are.

2688
02:07:04,900 --> 02:07:07,460
We are in as Thea hosts in 2022.

2689
02:07:07,460 --> 02:07:12,820
We just need to run it by this organization that seems like a rather stuffy organization, but they'll probably be.

2690
02:07:12,820 --> 02:07:15,220
Yep, who denied us who denied us free tickets once?

2691
02:07:16,740 --> 02:07:19,700
Well, I think the tickets are like, they said six tickets.

2692
02:07:20,100 --> 02:07:20,740
I know that.

2693
02:07:20,740 --> 02:07:23,060
You were offered.

2694
02:07:23,060 --> 02:07:28,420
They said our outlet was not a good fit is what I believe the email said that we were not a good fit.

2695
02:07:29,860 --> 02:07:31,220
But we are the host.

2696
02:07:31,860 --> 02:07:34,340
We are the right fit to where the right fit to host.

2697
02:07:34,340 --> 02:07:35,300
We've got credits.

2698
02:07:36,580 --> 02:07:37,460
Yeah, I guess.

2699
02:07:37,460 --> 02:07:37,940
Yeah, OK.

2700
02:07:38,740 --> 02:07:40,900
We've got we've got what are they?

2701
02:07:40,900 --> 02:07:42,900
Is it called polls media?

2702
02:07:42,900 --> 02:07:44,580
Like we've got clippings clippings.

2703
02:07:45,220 --> 02:07:45,700
Oh, yeah.

2704
02:07:45,700 --> 02:07:46,660
Yeah, we have clippings.

2705
02:07:46,660 --> 02:07:51,780
And now from some web series that appeared on platforms that have since been canceled entirely.

2706
02:07:53,220 --> 02:07:56,820
Please welcome Scott Gardner.

2707
02:07:59,940 --> 02:08:00,260
All right.

2708
02:08:00,260 --> 02:08:02,260
That's a Easter by podcast, right?

2709
02:08:04,100 --> 02:08:08,900
Boy, what a wild ride we'll see at the feasts 2022 or maybe at this rate 2024.

2710
02:08:08,900 --> 02:08:10,100
I don't know when they're coming back.

2711
02:08:11,220 --> 02:08:11,780
We'll figure it out.

2712
02:08:11,780 --> 02:08:12,340
We'll be there.

2713
02:08:13,060 --> 02:08:15,060
You can find us on all the socials at podcast.

2714
02:08:15,060 --> 02:08:19,620
The ride merch is available in our public store and for three bonus episodes every month,

2715
02:08:19,620 --> 02:08:24,500
check out podcast the ride, the second gate at patreon.com slash podcast the ride.

2716
02:08:24,500 --> 02:08:27,540
As always, your whiskey choice is digits.

2717
02:08:28,260 --> 02:08:32,180
It's a championship level.

2718
02:08:32,180 --> 02:08:35,620
It's the only whiskey it's worthy of six rings.

2719
02:08:35,620 --> 02:08:39,140
And for the best organic popcorn, it's got to be husk.

2720
02:08:40,340 --> 02:08:42,900
It feels like, by the way, it feels like that's a different episode at this point.

2721
02:08:42,980 --> 02:08:44,420
That was the yeah, yeah, yeah.

2722
02:08:45,540 --> 02:08:50,740
That's worth a four star review is they call back things that were two and a half hours.

2723
02:08:52,180 --> 02:08:55,940
I was begging them not to, and they did it anyway.

2724
02:08:57,940 --> 02:08:58,980
Four stars.

2725
02:08:58,980 --> 02:09:03,300
But that's the amount of time we're going to have to sustain at the awards.

2726
02:09:03,300 --> 02:09:05,140
So call back with that.

2727
02:09:06,100 --> 02:09:06,820
That is what you want.

2728
02:09:06,820 --> 02:09:09,540
You got to track everything that happened in the night and we're going to do it.

2729
02:09:09,540 --> 02:09:10,340
Every single thing.

2730
02:09:10,660 --> 02:09:13,060
We'll have our joke writers waiting, as they always say,

2731
02:09:14,900 --> 02:09:17,300
waiting in the wings to give us those jokes.

2732
02:09:17,300 --> 02:09:19,700
And then we'll have to, of course, get the Lanch.

2733
02:09:20,980 --> 02:09:21,620
Oh, yeah.

2734
02:09:22,500 --> 02:09:24,660
Oh, man, we got to get the Lanch.

2735
02:09:24,660 --> 02:09:28,820
The Lanch will have some great lines about like, thank you all for being here tonight.

2736
02:09:28,820 --> 02:09:31,860
And for those of you who aren't here tonight,

2737
02:09:31,860 --> 02:09:35,540
should have woken up early to get in the virtual queue sooner, asshole.

2738
02:09:37,780 --> 02:09:38,260
Classic.

2739
02:09:39,060 --> 02:09:39,540
Great.

2740
02:09:39,540 --> 02:09:40,420
And we're great.

2741
02:09:40,420 --> 02:09:40,740
Perfect.

2742
02:09:40,740 --> 02:09:41,300
Be great.

2743
02:09:41,300 --> 02:09:41,700
All right.

2744
02:09:41,700 --> 02:09:42,260
See you there.

2745
02:09:42,260 --> 02:09:42,660
Bye.

2746
02:09:42,660 --> 02:09:42,980
