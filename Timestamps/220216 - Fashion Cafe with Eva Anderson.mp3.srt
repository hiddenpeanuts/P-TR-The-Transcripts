1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,400
Welcome back to Celebruary here on podcast The Ride,

3
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,320
The Second Gate, I'm Scott Gardner,

4
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,280
Mike Carlson back as well, hi.

5
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,920
I'm here, what a Celebruary it's been.

6
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,720
Been a thrilling Celebruary,

7
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,360
how could it go any other way, Jason Sheridan, hi.

8
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,600
Hi, another exciting one today.

9
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:42,400
I think so, and one thing I think adding to the excitement

10
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,080
is that I think we'll frame this

11
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:48,360
where I think the listeners will see a slash in the topic

12
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,440
that you guys, that nobody here sees.

13
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,200
It's related to you, we know about the Fashion Cafe,

14
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,840
of course we know about the Fashion Cafe,

15
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,080
but the part two you all don't know about.

16
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,920
The only thing I can say, I think it ties together

17
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,520
because I think both of the topics are about

18
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:08,040
glamorous ladies getting into the food business.

19
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,960
So be prepared for glamor today

20
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,800
and joining us for the glamor.

21
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,500
Back for more Celebruary, back in The Second Gate,

22
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,840
your domain, Eva Anderson, hello.

23
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,760
I'm back everybody.

24
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,600
Yay.

25
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,440
Yay.

26
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:26,400
For your continuing Celebruary presence.

27
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,240
Oh, I wouldn't be anywhere else in the world.

28
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,560
This is my favorite thing right now.

29
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,560
I'm just so glad you're not

30
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,400
celebrating Celebruary with anyone else.

31
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,560
Oh, I wouldn't dream of it.

32
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,520
Honored that it's with us.

33
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,480
And especially this because when I told you

34
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,080
that we were doing this a while back,

35
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,720
I feel like maybe, I don't know how we landed on this,

36
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,480
but I know we texted about the Fashion Cafe for a while.

37
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,040
I don't know if it was like of your own volition

38
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,120
that you started looking up this thing

39
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:58,280
or how we got there, but I remember we were both

40
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,520
very intrigued because there's like, well, there's a guy.

41
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,300
There's a great guy in this.

42
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,440
There's always a guy.

43
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,920
There's always a guy.

44
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,480
I feel like you started using this term

45
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:15,960
and I think you coined it, which what does a guy mean?

46
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:20,960
A guy is just like one of these enigmatic sleazebags

47
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:26,160
who we come across who you, I guess, constantly bump into

48
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,120
when it's this kind of mega budget stealing money

49
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,800
from people kind of property.

50
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,000
Mercurial might be a way to describe.

51
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,840
Mercurial is a good word.

52
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,660
Oh, yeah.

53
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:36,760
Yes, yeah.

54
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:39,800
I guess we do, I mean, who's a guy?

55
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,520
I guess Robert Earl's a guy.

56
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,360
Steve Wynn.

57
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,480
Steve Wynn's a guy.

58
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,280
Thelma and Fertitta.

59
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,720
Thelma and Fertitta's a guy.

60
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,040
There might be two guys in this one.

61
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:49,880
Who's the other guy?

62
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,080
Sometimes there's a guy above a guy.

63
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,920
Sometimes a guy gets bailed out by a guy.

64
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,960
Oh, yeah.

65
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,960
Absolutely, yes.

66
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,360
The ultimate guy, truly the ultimate guy.

67
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,880
Sometimes the guy is the son of a guy also.

68
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,240
Not here, I'm just saying in general,

69
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,120
sometimes when you go, oh, who's the guy in charge of this?

70
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,080
It's the son of a guy.

71
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:09,920
Oh, yeah.

72
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,760
Like, so this guy, who created this confusing app

73
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,720
where it sells toys to people?

74
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,920
Oh, it's the son of a guy.

75
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,120
Like when you, like that often happens, I find.

76
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,000
Yeah, a fail son.

77
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,840
That's a way to put it.

78
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,840
That's a flavor of guy.

79
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,680
Fail sons and fail daughters are flavors of guys.

80
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,520
Yes, sure.

81
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,120
Right.

82
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,840
Well, we're gonna meet the guy,

83
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,640
but I guess we should first meet the girls.

84
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:37,640
And this is, okay, so the Fashion Cafe was a business

85
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,760
that opened in 1995 and was gone by 1999

86
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,520
in an explosion of lawsuits and fraud.

87
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:49,520
And when now, Mike, you brought this up right away

88
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,520
with Celebrity-Owned Restaurant Month,

89
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,160
how there's gotta be an asterisk next to that word.

90
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,000
You're right.

91
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,080
And the asterisk really applies here because I don't,

92
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,440
I don't think the women themselves were clear

93
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,600
on if they owned the restaurant or not.

94
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,760
I'd say they did not.

95
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,800
I think they didn't.

96
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,920
They didn't.

97
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:09,960
They were involved.

98
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,320
They got something out of it,

99
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,760
but I think they got a lot taken from them as well.

100
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,840
Yeah, they were famous for sure.

101
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,920
That part we know.

102
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:20,520
Celebrity chick, restaurant chick owned.

103
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:23,640
But they were more like the Planet Hollywood celebrities

104
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,400
towards the later run where they didn't have to give them

105
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,240
functional legal shares.

106
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,440
They had quote unquote shares

107
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,280
or interest in the company.

108
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:37,080
A very generic company, very generic name by the way,

109
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,440
because if you Google Fashion Cafe,

110
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:42,560
you find restaurants just name that all over the world.

111
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,480
Yes. Oh yeah.

112
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,800
And he got sued, I think by somebody.

113
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:50,320
I think, of course there was a Fashion Cafe before him.

114
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,520
Like he didn't think of putting those words together,

115
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:56,560
but the guy in this scenario, we'll meet the guy later,

116
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,160
but Tommaso Booty is the name of the guy.

117
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,320
But he just was, it was beyond like that he saw it

118
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,360
in passing and then called his thing that.

119
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:09,360
He knew a guy who owned a Fashion Cafe was in the cafe

120
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,640
with the owner.

121
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,680
I love it here.

122
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,320
Then just took the name and did it himself

123
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,800
and got sued later.

124
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,280
Yes for forgiveness, not permission.

125
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,640
Yes, he could deal with the comeuppance later.

126
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:29,640
The point is he got it open in beautiful Rockefeller Center,

127
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:34,800
a place where people, where finally fashion meets burgers

128
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,280
and waffle fries.

129
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:44,280
Like it's not particularly high end food.

130
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:48,040
A lot of these places are essentially serving

131
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:51,240
what the TGI Fridays down the block is serving.

132
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:56,240
And in most cases doing a worse job than a solid TGI Fridays.

133
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,800
Cause that's what they do.

134
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:01,520
Cause TGI Fridays there, that's the business they started in.

135
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,880
It wasn't like an afterthought of a name

136
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:07,080
and of having openings where supermodels show up.

137
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,320
Well, I think I actually started more excited.

138
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:12,440
I think it was a popular singles bar and like cocktail,

139
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:16,400
like kind of like Tom Cruise cocktail,

140
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,000
like crazy cocktail mixing.

141
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,840
And then.

142
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,660
This has been explained to me.

143
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:20,500
Flair bartending.

144
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,640
Flair bartending, that's the term.

145
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,880
TGI Fridays you mean?

146
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,760
I think TGI Fridays, yeah.

147
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,760
That's kind of cool.

148
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:30,080
In Manhattan, I think I accidentally went to one,

149
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,160
I was there and didn't realize it was at the original one,

150
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,360
one time.

151
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,600
When I like had like an hour to kill

152
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,200
between meeting college friends in the city.

153
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,400
Was it the one in Times Square?

154
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,320
The multi, cause there was a three story one

155
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,040
in Times Square at one point.

156
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:44,880
I don't think it was that.

157
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,720
I think that one came.

158
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,560
It was by Studio 54.

159
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,400
Maybe it is.

160
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,220
I don't know.

161
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,840
I feel like I went to one in Midtown.

162
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,680
Oh man.

163
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,160
It was like, so Coyote Ugly and TGI Fridays

164
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,800
were kind of the same like horny bar.

165
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:01,120
Were they're dancing on top of the bar at TGI Fridays?

166
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,000
Oh, I hope so.

167
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,840
Yeah.

168
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,660
Cause I was going to say,

169
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:07,060
Coyote Ugly, if you don't have the bar top dancing.

170
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:07,900
Yeah.

171
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,500
And eventually evolved into the office space,

172
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:14,140
appetizers, pieces of flair kind of.

173
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:17,100
Yeah. We're not knocking the one opposite Knott's Berry Farm.

174
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,940
Obviously it's like, you know,

175
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,380
still a fine establishment.

176
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:23,580
But did follow a similar arc and plan Hollywood in one way

177
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:24,940
in that for years they're like,

178
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:26,900
and we've got Jack Daniel's chicken,

179
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:30,060
which is like, it's just a very super sweet glaze

180
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:32,780
that would put on chicken tenders and steaks and stuff.

181
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,980
And now if you look at the TGI Fridays menu,

182
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,660
they're like whiskey glazed chicken.

183
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:39,420
Like they've clearly lost the licensing

184
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,260
for their very sweet sugar chicken.

185
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,100
Oh, I see.

186
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:42,940
Yeah.

187
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:45,180
Tennessee whiskey flavored.

188
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,460
You hit 10 years and you're like,

189
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:51,460
what's it worth it to us to pay the company for the,

190
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:53,940
everyone knows what's on the chicken.

191
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,620
There's like, you know, I go to a Sonic

192
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:58,820
whenever there's one around and I get a little slush

193
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:00,460
with some nerds candy in it.

194
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:01,980
And they don't call them nerds.

195
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:04,940
They call them like fruit candy, but they're nerds.

196
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:07,020
They just throw a bunch of nerds in your slush,

197
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,660
but they don't call it that.

198
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,540
They can still use the nerds.

199
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:12,100
They just don't, they can't use it in the name.

200
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,020
Unless they're making their own nerds.

201
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:15,460
That sounds weird.

202
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:16,300
It's great.

203
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,340
Does it hurt your teeth?

204
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,460
I feel like they get cold and you couldn't chew them

205
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:22,540
and they'd be chalky and squeak against your teeth.

206
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:25,340
It'd be interesting to compare which of the three of us,

207
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:27,940
like our teeth, like who do we think has the best

208
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:30,140
and worst teeth compared to our diets?

209
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:32,660
I just had my first cavity.

210
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:33,500
Wow.

211
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,340
In my life.

212
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,180
Okay, you have good teeth.

213
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:36,020
I have very bad teeth.

214
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:36,860
And you have really good teeth.

215
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,300
Yeah, well I have cavities all the time.

216
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,140
Oh, interesting.

217
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,300
I've got caps and shit.

218
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,140
Really?

219
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:43,940
Yeah, I had like maybe a sealant 20 years ago

220
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:44,860
on one of my back teeth.

221
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,860
And then I literally just, for the first time ever,

222
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:50,100
they drilled like four months ago.

223
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:52,860
Fantastic teeth.

224
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:53,700
But it's just luck.

225
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,540
It's not.

226
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:58,140
I only had one cavity, but it was in a baby tooth,

227
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,900
I think, that I eventually lost.

228
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:01,980
So Jason has better teeth than you.

229
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,540
You both have exceptional teeth.

230
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,540
Stunningly great.

231
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:06,660
I am shocked by this.

232
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,660
I guess mine are much worse.

233
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:10,660
I have a little bit of plaster on a front tooth,

234
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:11,700
but no one ever noticed it.

235
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:15,340
I had a dentist once go like not catch it, like a new dentist.

236
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:17,940
So I was like, by the way, I got a like just plaster there.

237
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,500
And he's like, oh, I didn't even see that.

238
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,540
Let's get a dentist on in one of these episodes

239
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,540
and he'll do a live like explanation

240
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:24,940
of how good Jason and I's teeth are.

241
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,220
Do you guys floss?

242
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:27,060
Well, here's the thing.

243
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,980
I wasn't flossing very much, but until the pandemic,

244
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,780
I could feel there was something wrong with one of my teeth.

245
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:31,900
And then it freaked me out.

246
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,980
And I've been like so good about flossing for now,

247
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:36,180
like a year and a half or two years.

248
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,380
You only just picked up flossing and yet no cavities?

249
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:40,780
Well, I would floss, but I wasn't floss like every day.

250
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:41,620
I see.

251
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:44,300
But yeah, I got pretty scared.

252
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,380
I'm impressed.

253
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:46,220
Wow.

254
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,260
Literally, I think it's luck.

255
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:48,100
I think it's luck.

256
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:48,940
Yeah.

257
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:51,740
Well, now listener, you know our dental records.

258
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:54,060
You've been wondering, we're getting close

259
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,060
to 500 episodes or something.

260
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:58,620
When are they going to get into it?

261
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:01,580
But I don't think that our smiles could compare

262
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:06,580
with the glamorous ladies of the Fashion Cafe.

263
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:13,500
So the lineup here, Naomi Campbell, Elmick Fiersen,

264
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:19,220
and Claudia Schiffer were the first three joined later

265
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:23,340
by Christy Turlington, who was also the first one out.

266
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:26,220
She got out before the others.

267
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:29,060
Does anyone have any thoughts or memories or feelings

268
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:31,020
about any of these supermodels?

269
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:35,740
Well, they were the best ones.

270
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,740
They were right up there.

271
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,860
90s was a big time for supermodels.

272
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:45,020
They had a lot of just psychic power over, especially girls

273
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:47,380
my age at the time.

274
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:51,060
Claudia Schiffer ties back into the universe, you know why.

275
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,260
Of course.

276
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,780
The old, maybe the best guy.

277
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:55,220
Who came to the opening.

278
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,260
Oh, yeah, he was there.

279
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:58,940
Present at the opening, Copperfield's girlfriend.

280
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:03,940
The hottest person a magician has ever dated

281
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,580
was Copperfield and Schiffer.

282
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:07,420
They're always creating the illusion

283
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:11,500
that the beautiful assistants are or could be with them.

284
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:15,060
But this is usually not the case.

285
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:18,820
In this case, yeah, wow, he really did it.

286
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:22,460
Also great in Batman and Robin, obviously.

287
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:22,980
Yes.

288
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,740
Or maybe are in it, at least.

289
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:25,420
She's in it.

290
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:30,260
Yeah, she, wait, wait, Batman and Robin, who does she play?

291
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:32,860
Bruce Wayne has a girlfriend, but this one's not like a.

292
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,900
I think that's El McPherson.

293
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:35,420
Yeah.

294
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,420
Oh, yeah, sorry.

295
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:37,220
OK, yeah, yeah.

296
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:37,940
Oh, I'm sorry.

297
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:38,660
I got confused.

298
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:39,340
I got confused.

299
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,500
And I don't think I was, I wasn't

300
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,940
doing that thing where I was trying to lure you

301
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,340
into a trap where I was like, oh, I

302
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,540
know what he's talking about.

303
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:48,500
So OK, El McPherson is Bruce Wayne's.

304
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,940
What's her name in it?

305
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:52,380
That's a reference I should be pulling out,

306
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,020
like every once a day at least.

307
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:56,140
But it's not a very dealt with character.

308
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:58,100
No, she doesn't have a lot to do in that movie.

309
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,980
No, no, they did not elect to have to really go

310
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:03,740
into the love interest there.

311
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:06,180
Can I say I think fashion, when I first

312
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:09,540
started reading about this, I was a little confused

313
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:13,780
because, yes, supermodels wear lots of high fashion.

314
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:18,140
But Fashion Cafe to me, I feel like my first thought went to,

315
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:23,780
like, oh, OK, so like Gucci and Versace and Armand,

316
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:24,940
they're involved in this place.

317
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,900
No, it's a supermodel place.

318
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:30,500
Now, the Donatella Versace and Gianni Versace

319
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,060
were at the opening.

320
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:35,100
And there is like gowns and high fashion

321
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,220
attire in the restaurant.

322
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:40,460
But then also, I believe later on,

323
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:43,020
was it is the detailed Jada Pinkett Smith's dress

324
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:45,500
from Nutty Professor or Nutty Professor 2?

325
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:48,740
Like, that's what they pointed to, like the new installment.

326
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:53,340
They had a little event for like, we've got the dress.

327
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:55,860
We've got Jada Pinkett's dress from this movie.

328
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,620
Well, there's an explanation for that.

329
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:00,060
But it involves introducing the guy.

330
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:02,340
You know, I think the guy is going to keep factoring in.

331
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:04,700
So by all means, let's bring the guy into it.

332
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,620
Do you want to introduce the guy?

333
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,140
Tommaso Booty.

334
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:10,140
Tommaso Booty.

335
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:12,860
One of the booty brothers.

336
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:16,300
And he was 28 years old when Fashion Cafe opened.

337
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,100
Wow.

338
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,820
And just his quote that explains what you're saying,

339
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,860
Jason, is, with something like this,

340
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:24,100
you cannot go too deeply into fashion.

341
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:28,180
The public is not that educated and not that interested.

342
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:30,660
Not that interested in the topic that I

343
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,580
am starting a business about.

344
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,700
They want to see more the glamour and the entertainment

345
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:37,740
of fashion, which means supermodels, not designers.

346
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:40,140
They don't care who makes the clothes.

347
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:42,940
They just want to see the beautiful ladies wearing them.

348
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:47,460
Yeah, which they will not see when they go to the rest.

349
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,700
No, the women will not be there.

350
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,340
There might be a picture of them.

351
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:54,940
Although, I really tried to find proof of this

352
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:55,900
and could find none.

353
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:58,820
But I saw an article that said that there

354
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:03,380
were animatronics of the first three women.

355
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:06,500
So Tarleton was too late to get an animatronic.

356
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,100
Did anyone else come across this?

357
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:08,820
No.

358
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,340
I didn't see that.

359
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:11,300
I read that.

360
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,820
I saw it in two sources.

361
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,780
I saw some video that had a quick shot of what

362
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:16,340
looked a lot more like a mannequin.

363
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:18,340
So they might have been exaggerating

364
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:20,860
what animatronic meant.

365
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:25,620
But in one of the articles I saw, this owner,

366
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:28,740
they were talking to Tomaso, or he was around.

367
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:31,100
And somebody was saying, we're working hard

368
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,860
on the animatronics.

369
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:34,620
I don't know.

370
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,220
We've only got Naomi done.

371
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:39,300
And he says to the reporter, yeah, they'll get done.

372
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:39,900
It'll be fine.

373
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,420
And there's like a month to go.

374
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:43,300
I think there's only a month before the opening.

375
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,940
And then elsewhere, I think MacPherson says, oh, yeah,

376
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:48,140
I'm going in for my sitting this week.

377
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:50,140
For a sitting for an animatronic?

378
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,980
They're making an animatronic of you

379
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,380
that has to be done by the end of the month,

380
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:55,140
and you haven't started the process.

381
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:59,180
So this is going to be, I think, like the Hatbox Ghost, where

382
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:01,700
there was a legend that the Hatbox Ghost was

383
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,460
in the Haunted Mansion when it first opened.

384
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:05,380
But this was disputed for years because there

385
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:07,460
wasn't good footage of it.

386
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:10,100
So it's written about there were pictures of it.

387
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,340
And Tony Baxter was one of the only guys that was like,

388
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:13,980
I was there and I saw it.

389
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,900
And then finally, they found footage of it years later.

390
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:19,580
So this will be a hunt we'll be on maybe for a long time

391
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:22,260
is to find picture proof that there

392
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,260
were some sort of animatronics in this place.

393
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:26,700
Or the animatronics just appears one day

394
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,340
like the Hatbox Ghost does.

395
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:31,060
It just appears in Planet Hollywood in Malta.

396
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,700
Or wherever.

397
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,420
Or the spot it was in before.

398
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:35,820
It's the Banana Republic.

399
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:36,820
It just is in the corner?

400
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:37,980
Yeah.

401
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,460
People are like, oh, Ellen MacPherson

402
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:40,900
is in this Banana Republic.

403
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:44,660
Slightly moving her finger and shifting her eyes.

404
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:47,060
She pops straight into Banana Republic clothes.

405
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:48,580
It's horrible.

406
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:51,580
Eva, that quote does remind me of the designer

407
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:53,820
of the space of Planet Hollywood going,

408
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,700
I wasn't making something for Haute Cuisine.

409
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,780
I was making something for the Jeans Brigade.

410
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:00,340
And we're all just like, what does it mean?

411
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:05,220
I've never heard the Hoy Paloy refer to as the Jeans Brigade.

412
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:10,100
Should you be calling your Cliffords the Jeans Brigade?

413
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,220
Would they like that?

414
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:14,780
Hey, sound off if you want to be the Jeans Brigade Cliffords.

415
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,300
Well, they love being Cliffords.

416
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:21,820
Every one of them loves being that unloaded name.

417
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,380
I mean, yeah.

418
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:27,180
We know they're all Jay Leno's life enthusiasts.

419
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:29,900
And they know about his affinity for denim.

420
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,900
So I guess you could call them.

421
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,740
And it's a good utilitarian thing

422
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:36,500
to wear to theme parks.

423
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:41,020
Also, you could be starting to build a Warriors-esque groups

424
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,220
of fans.

425
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:42,940
Oh, sure.

426
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:44,220
They could fight each other.

427
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,860
They had different turf.

428
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:46,700
Oh, yeah.

429
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,580
Yeah, like when factions fight in wrestling,

430
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:49,860
we're going to have stable wars.

431
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:52,380
It's like the Jeans Brigade versus the Cliffords.

432
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:55,500
So each one of us will have to lead one of the armies,

433
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,740
I think.

434
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:57,740
So Jason could lead.

435
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:59,540
Jason's Jeans Brigade.

436
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:00,060
Yes.

437
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,380
But Jason, I feel like, is going to be the most willing

438
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:04,540
to lead the Cliffords, I think.

439
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:05,060
Maybe.

440
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:08,180
Because Jason's the biggest fan of the movie, Clifford.

441
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:10,980
It turns out I was leading all of them this whole time.

442
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:13,020
I was pulling the strings behind the scenes.

443
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,460
It was me all along.

444
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:16,340
It was me all along, Austin.

445
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:18,820
You wanted them just to destroy each other?

446
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:19,420
Yeah.

447
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:19,900
Yeah.

448
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:20,780
That's how this has to go out.

449
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:21,260
Yeah.

450
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:25,940
You're like God in the Mark Twain claymation,

451
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:28,980
where he makes all the men, and then he makes these, like,

452
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:29,700
fight.

453
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,580
And they, is Satan?

454
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:32,780
That's Satan, right?

455
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:33,380
I'm not sure.

456
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:34,660
I don't know what claymation this is.

457
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,620
The Adventures of Mark Twain, anybody?

458
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:37,140
Oh, yeah.

459
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,860
By the California Raisin Sky?

460
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:39,660
Yeah, yeah.

461
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:40,300
I know what you're talking about.

462
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:40,820
I've never seen it.

463
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:41,500
I know what you're talking about.

464
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,860
There's a really disturbing thing

465
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:45,860
where Satan makes clay people and then makes

466
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:48,500
them destroy each other while these little kids watch upset.

467
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,420
It's shocking this has not come up before.

468
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:51,220
Yeah, it's weird.

469
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:54,540
Before we had just forgotten more than we've ever remembered.

470
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,940
A really low amount of Wilvinton, honestly,

471
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:00,180
for considering who we are.

472
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,460
Well, you know, look, they had other,

473
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,460
they had prominent items.

474
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:07,180
They had a Madonna cone bra.

475
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:13,420
They had the Armani suit that Jodie Foster wore to the Oscars

476
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:15,700
when she won for Silence of the Lambs.

477
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,780
We remember the suit, of course.

478
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:18,620
Iconic.

479
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:20,820
Color, we know the cut.

480
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:21,820
We all know the set.

481
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:28,060
Now you can go see it in person and eat a pizza next to it.

482
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:30,780
Then there's not, like, the food identity of this place

483
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:33,340
is nothing.

484
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:36,380
Except for, Eva, as you referenced,

485
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:38,540
that all of the, before we start recording,

486
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:41,700
that all of the models got their own item.

487
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,740
This is kind of the only thing, one,

488
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:47,980
you get to pick one food or have someone in your organization

489
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:51,700
pick a food that might represent you.

490
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:54,380
This is pretty, like, flaccid, this attempt

491
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:58,020
to tie the models to the food items.

492
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:00,340
Right.

493
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:01,820
Yeah, I don't know.

494
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,740
You would think, again, I'm just repeating myself

495
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,500
over and over again, but you'd think if you were involved,

496
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,980
you would be like, fun food is what we want.

497
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:11,980
And at least if you were like, we're famous

498
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:15,580
and we're the draw for this place,

499
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,420
that's what the idea is.

500
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:18,740
The models are the draw.

501
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:21,100
You would think that would be fun to order.

502
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:26,180
I don't know what, the Schiffer sherbet or something.

503
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:27,260
There's something to that.

504
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:28,260
Oh, an SCH?

505
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:28,740
Yeah.

506
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:31,620
Except that there's the general immediate issue,

507
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:36,820
which came up immediately, which is that models don't eat food.

508
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:40,100
And nobody associates fashion and model, specifically super

509
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,220
models, with delicious food.

510
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:44,060
And so that came up right away.

511
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:47,140
And then in one interview, Claudia Schiffer

512
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:51,340
was like, so defensive, obviously.

513
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:55,180
So she said, you can never generalize.

514
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:57,300
She scolded.

515
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,580
I love chocolate.

516
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:01,020
We love so many different things.

517
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:05,180
We have French fries, hamburgers on the menu.

518
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:07,700
And then to prove the point, all three pose for a photographer

519
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,220
while nibbling chicken and fries.

520
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:11,580
Of course.

521
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:14,540
See, I know there's unreasonable expectations

522
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:16,260
from those people, especially in the 90s,

523
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:19,180
when the media was just so insane.

524
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:22,420
On the other hand, when they try to talk like a normal human being

525
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:25,260
about food, they do come out sounding very strange.

526
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:25,820
Yeah.

527
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:27,260
Yeah.

528
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:30,500
Not like the actors who are already primed for the camera.

529
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:34,740
So it sounds normal when they say, I don't like food at all or chewing.

530
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:37,420
I want my food to be a pill.

531
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:39,860
It's like the 40-year-old virgin conversation

532
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:41,020
about sex with eating food.

533
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:42,900
Yes, a hamburger is wonderful.

534
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:45,740
It's a fluffy taste in your mouth.

535
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:47,700
Like, just words that make no sense.

536
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:53,300
When it flaps against my teeth, when a chicken piece flaps on my teeth.

537
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:59,500
When I sling it in my mouth and digest it, it's just like a,

538
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:03,540
it slides down there and I enjoy it.

539
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:05,540
I've eaten a hamburger before.

540
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:13,420
When I sink my fork into a milkshake, nothing is better.

541
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:18,260
But they did try to tie themselves to the thing, Naomi's Fish and Chips,

542
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,340
or the other ones.

543
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:20,940
Which one's from Australia?

544
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,820
Noel McPherson's from Australia.

545
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:25,460
So it was Elle's Shrimp on the Barbie.

546
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:26,740
On the Barbie.

547
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:27,460
Of course.

548
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:28,580
Every Australian eats.

549
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:29,860
And what was the other one?

550
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:31,860
Claudia's.

551
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,700
Who else is from somewhere?

552
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:34,380
I had it.

553
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:35,380
Would have.

554
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:38,060
Did Claudia tie hers to Copperfield?

555
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:39,260
She's German.

556
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:40,940
Uh-huh.

557
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:43,980
I have to go back in my notes because I just have this open ready to drop the fact

558
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:47,340
that Elle's name was Julie Madison in Batman and Robin.

559
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,700
Julie Madison.

560
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,220
Famous Batman character.

561
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,700
Now I can leave this screen on my phone.

562
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,180
They didn't write down their other foods.

563
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:57,900
They were boring enough that I don't have them.

564
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,580
The point was their presence.

565
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:04,020
And the point that they're going to be at the opening, they'll be at the groundbreaking.

566
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:08,380
I read that at the groundbreaking, the models all burst through a paper backdrop like the

567
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:10,780
Kool-Aid man.

568
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:11,940
That sounds good.

569
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:13,060
That is good, yeah.

570
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:18,100
And then of course, there was the gift shop component.

571
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:23,300
We've come across this in every one of these thus far, besides the little mom and pop,

572
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,260
Alan Hales.

573
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:30,380
All of these businesses are predicated on $1,500 bomber jacket.

574
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:32,420
In this case, $1,500.

575
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:35,340
We were finding some expensive stuff with dive and Planet Hollywood.

576
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:39,580
Here, I mean, it's fashion, so they're going to up the cost of the clothes.

577
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:41,020
$1,500 bucks for fashion.

578
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,660
That's $1,000 more than the dive.

579
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:44,580
The most expensive dive jacket.

580
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:45,940
That was in dollars more.

581
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:51,660
Side note, Claudia Shivers was a steak with roasted potatoes and breadcrumb topped cauliflower.

582
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:52,660
Wow.

583
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:53,660
Really?

584
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:54,660
What's that though?

585
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:56,860
I was also pulling up Claudia's New York strip.

586
00:22:56,860 --> 00:23:00,460
It's her New York because she lives in New York.

587
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:01,460
I don't know.

588
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:03,820
They just stopped trying to connect it by that point.

589
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:05,620
Back to this $1,500 jacket.

590
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:06,620
Do any of them exist anymore?

591
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:07,620
Do we know what they look like?

592
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:08,620
Yeah, are they on eBay?

593
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:09,620
Did we find any?

594
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:10,620
We could do an eBay check.

595
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:11,620
Yeah, I found...

596
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:12,620
You found a jacket?

597
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:13,620
You found a jacket?

598
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:18,020
I think I saw at least a picture of the jacket here.

599
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:21,900
I just want to know because dive stuff is pretty plentiful and obviously plan on Hollywood

600
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,140
stuff is very plentiful on eBay.

601
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,140
This one is so much less.

602
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:27,660
Here's a $300 one on Poshmark.

603
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:30,660
What sweaty value?

604
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:35,660
I mean, imagine...

605
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:38,660
What color is it?

606
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:39,660
Jason, name the colors.

607
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:40,660
Tan sleeves, blue back.

608
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:42,660
Oh no, it's finally opening.

609
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:45,700
Tan sleeves, blue back, a star on it.

610
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:48,700
Are those fashion coffee logo?

611
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:51,020
Yeah, I mean, there's a few of them.

612
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:54,860
It's the most generic looking, like it may as well just say sports team.

613
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:56,660
Like they're super small, but...

614
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:58,100
What are they thinking?

615
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:01,980
There has been, I'll say in the celebriary, there has been...

616
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:07,940
Except for one, maybe the last Patreon of the month, there's been like a jacket in every

617
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:08,940
episode.

618
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:09,940
Am I wrong?

619
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:10,940
Yeah, I think so.

620
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:14,220
There's a jacket and the last one coming, a different kind of jacket.

621
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah, but there's...

622
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,220
Yeah, okay.

623
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:17,220
Yeah, that's really...

624
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:19,300
That looks like the same as the sports one.

625
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:22,740
Wasn't the sports place also just a star?

626
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:24,740
It was probably from the same wholesaler.

627
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:32,140
Yeah, there's a bunch of the tank tops on just Etsy and stuff and they're so ugly.

628
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:33,140
They're really ugly.

629
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:36,380
And that's the one place they could have had a cute shirt.

630
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:39,180
They should have had a cute 90s belly shirt.

631
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,180
Yeah, why not?

632
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:47,180
I kind of like what the models wore, just these like white shirts, just regular t-shirts

633
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:50,340
looked kind of neat, but I don't know if you could get those.

634
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:51,340
Yeah.

635
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:54,500
And of course, you know who looked great at the opening?

636
00:24:54,500 --> 00:25:02,580
I mean, besides certainly the models, but of course, our favorite model, Minnie Mouse.

637
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:04,420
I don't know why Minnie was there.

638
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:08,620
This isn't Disney affiliated or in a Disney-owned property.

639
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:10,340
If you look, it's real Minnie.

640
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:12,020
It's not like Times Square Minnie, right?

641
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,020
Yeah, yeah.

642
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,020
It looks like real Minnie.

643
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:15,020
That's theme park quality.

644
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:16,020
Yep.

645
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,020
Yeah.

646
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:18,020
But why was Chip at Planet Hollywood?

647
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:19,140
What was that?

648
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:21,780
Why was Chip at Planet Hollywood?

649
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:24,820
That one was at Disney World.

650
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:25,820
Okay.

651
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:27,420
So that's, yeah, that explains that one.

652
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:29,420
He was in the area.

653
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:30,420
It's where he lives.

654
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:31,980
It wasn't a long drive.

655
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:36,680
The timing was such that some places, fashion cafes were opening across the street from

656
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,680
Planet Hollywood.

657
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,120
Like they were around the same time.

658
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,120
Yeah.

659
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,280
And there were articles about how this is like, they're going to be competing with each

660
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,280
other.

661
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,280
Yeah.

662
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,280
Really?

663
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:55,320
How did this, this all took off so fast and just too many of them like, and before any,

664
00:25:55,320 --> 00:26:01,640
like Planet Hollywood had sort of proven success in like one location, but not a ton all over

665
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,640
the way.

666
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:07,480
And like kind of right as their downturn started was by the time the other ones got themselves

667
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:12,440
together and open so that every other one of these opened with like, when you go look

668
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:17,920
up what the newspaper articles were, it's like, well, the trend is dying and yet people

669
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,880
are still trying to get into it.

670
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,460
So you're already on the downturn.

671
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:22,460
It's really weird.

672
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:23,460
Yeah.

673
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:30,600
This neck of the woods, this part of Manhattan was also where there, I walked by one time

674
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:34,600
like Alfredo's, I think it was called Alfred.

675
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,920
This has come up on the show before.

676
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:40,400
It was an outpost of Alfredo of Fettuccine Alfredo fame's restaurant.

677
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:46,280
He had restaurants in Italy, Epcot center and briefly a small place in Manhattan.

678
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,280
Mm hmm.

679
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,280
Mm hmm.

680
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,280
Yeah.

681
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,640
Ben, you just want to like, you just want to say his name and think about his food.

682
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:56,520
I do want to think about his Fettuccine Alfredo is one of the best things I've ever eaten.

683
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,520
Really?

684
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,800
Like Alfredo's like recipe is really good.

685
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,800
Did you have it in Epcot?

686
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,800
Yeah.

687
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,360
No, a bunch of times because it used to be in the Italy pavilion.

688
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,360
Okay.

689
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,560
I had it then.

690
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:10,800
I think the reason it's not is because when they introduced the meal plan, they're like,

691
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:17,080
you got to be part of the meal plan and the restaurant went, no, we are a real, real restaurant.

692
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:20,520
As a child, did you know that this was famous?

693
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,720
I knew it was Alfredo's.

694
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,720
You did?

695
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,840
I knew it was Alfredo of Fettuccine Alfredo.

696
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:25,840
Wow.

697
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,840
Were you jacked about it?

698
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:27,840
I was.

699
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:28,840
Yes, absolutely.

700
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:29,840
Jason did a book report of it.

701
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,320
He dressed as Alfredo for a class presentation.

702
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:35,080
I didn't even order it that my brother loved Fettuccine Alfredo.

703
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:39,680
I never really ordered it that much except like there.

704
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,680
That's cool.

705
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:44,760
Did everyone here like do a Walt Disney biography or like a paper on him at some point?

706
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:50,540
I did a presentation in a class that the teacher liked so much that I was asked to do it before

707
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:52,400
the entire school.

708
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,400
No.

709
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,120
Which I did proudly.

710
00:27:56,120 --> 00:28:00,400
And then after the fact, I thought like, but why did they're just, they're already bored.

711
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:03,880
Why like, and now an extra thing.

712
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,520
I was going to talk about Walt Disney for no reason.

713
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,800
Anyway, did you?

714
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,800
I did.

715
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,800
Yeah, I did.

716
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:10,800
Jason, you do one of them.

717
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,040
I don't think about him.

718
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:18,320
I think I like prepared like once or twice went during the school year.

719
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:23,800
And so I was like, you know, they're like, well, you might have to do a little like paper,

720
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,640
you know, to make up for your time or something.

721
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:28,040
Oh, because you were pulled out of school to go to Disney.

722
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:32,480
I remember one trip I was like frantically like back of the room at night and like on

723
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:37,320
the plane reading Dracula, like the novel, because I thought like I had to read it when

724
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,320
I got back.

725
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,120
And then when I got back to school, they're like, yeah, we didn't get to Dracula.

726
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:46,280
Yeah, we actually like Huckleberry Finn took to or like something.

727
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,280
And I was like, what?

728
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,280
What I read?

729
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,160
You gave me a photocopy.

730
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:53,000
This was always a thing the teachers did, like where they didn't have enough books or

731
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,280
they were in such bad shape.

732
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,280
They didn't want to take it home.

733
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:58,800
I'd like a photocopy stack of papers on the novel.

734
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,800
Right.

735
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:00,800
I remember that.

736
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,800
Yeah.

737
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:02,800
That's funny.

738
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:06,400
Although I'm jealous of that because I never got pulled out of school for anything fun.

739
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,400
Never.

740
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,400
We were not alive.

741
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,400
I was not allowed.

742
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,400
Hmm.

743
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:13,720
So even for a fun vacation anyway, sorry, sorry to I get to don't mean to brag, but

744
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:16,400
I got pulled out of school so I could watch Spy Hard.

745
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,400
How about that?

746
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,400
Really?

747
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,400
Yeah.

748
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,840
Right at the end, fifth grade senioritis.

749
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,840
Wow.

750
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,840
Even my parents didn't.

751
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,800
I got to see one of the finest films ever made.

752
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,800
Wow.

753
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,800
Yeah.

754
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,800
Spy Hard.

755
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,840
What day did I get to do?

756
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,880
I got pulled out for anything fun.

757
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,880
Geez.

758
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,880
Then Midwest.

759
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,160
You must go to school every day.

760
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,640
Does your mom subscribe to the second gate?

761
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,640
Does she hear these?

762
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,920
Uh, I think it's my dad is playing them on his phone.

763
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:45,920
Okay.

764
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:48,640
Well, if that's the case, because you know what happens, she's going to dispute it.

765
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,240
You're going to get a text saying, no, remember one time.

766
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,240
No, she'll agree with me.

767
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,440
I think she'll be like, yes, and that's good.

768
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,440
You're right.

769
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,440
You never did.

770
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,440
And that built character.

771
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:04,600
What that means is you got to like blow off a day of commitments, boot up to be and just

772
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:07,920
watch Spy Hard like at like 11 a.m. one day.

773
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:11,440
So I'm going to, I'm going to bail on you guys once on a record day and I won't even

774
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,440
tell you I'm not coming.

775
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,440
And I want to do it.

776
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,440
We get a picture.

777
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:17,680
You'll Instagram story yourself watching Spy Hard.

778
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,680
Yeah.

779
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,680
Yeah.

780
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,680
Still laughing.

781
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,120
Laugh for more.

782
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,480
Actually better than naked gun.

783
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,840
I'd say maybe I'd say way better.

784
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:26,840
Yeah.

785
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,680
You guys will have to use like your iPhone in the episode you record.

786
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,680
I'll sound like shit.

787
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:33,200
You're not going to bring up.

788
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,200
And we have to do it.

789
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,200
You're going to make us do it.

790
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,560
You have to do it because we're in the files.

791
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,560
They're due this week.

792
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,560
Sorry, fellas.

793
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,560
Come up with something.

794
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:43,760
But it'll feel good because I know like you were still because like in order to recreate

795
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:48,680
that experience, that's some whatever I'm ditching has to still be going on for me to

796
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,120
feel satisfied.

797
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:52,400
Like school didn't stop if I if you guys went.

798
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,400
Is it just me giving permission?

799
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,400
Make it too.

800
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,400
OK.

801
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:00,320
We have to record shit at least that you can stay home and watch Spy Hard.

802
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:04,960
I just try to think of what Jason and Scott have in common that Mike's excluded from.

803
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,960
We were trying to figure that out.

804
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,400
We read the needle.

805
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,960
We just talked about Mike a lot.

806
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,960
Yeah.

807
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:15,040
It's like Georgia, like Georgia and Elaine when they got to just talk about Jerry.

808
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:20,480
They just make fun of Jerry is the only thing they can bond over.

809
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,240
So yeah, we'll figure it out.

810
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,240
That's what we do.

811
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,640
It's for us to Dracula.

812
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:29,320
We'll just try to combine what we have to know about Dracula.

813
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,320
Yeah.

814
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:34,000
Anyways, so it's up and running.

815
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
It's happening.

816
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,440
They're doing pajama fashion shows.

817
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:41,800
They're welcoming a Nutty Professor dress.

818
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,040
It is booming.

819
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,040
Maybe not ever.

820
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:48,400
Maybe I don't know that this one ever was working at any point.

821
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,400
It was working.

822
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:54,520
It seems like for a few months, it's where all the like openings were like all the parties

823
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,520
were.

824
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:59,360
So if you were having like a launching a fashion line or something like that, you would have

825
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,120
the after party at Fashion Cafe.

826
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:05,240
That's the only thing it was ever good for at all.

827
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:09,760
But it seems like very briefly at the beginning, there was a line because the Ruth Reichel,

828
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:16,480
New York Times review of the restaurant was where it mentioned, did you guys see it had

829
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,920
a seven page menu?

830
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,920
Wow.

831
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,920
The menu is seven pages.

832
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:21,920
Why?

833
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:22,920
For what?

834
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,320
Different types of fries.

835
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:30,080
It's like a roadside diner with like a giant menu where like most of it's not made well.

836
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,080
Yeah.

837
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:38,080
And then and she had to wait in line and then she said that the food was fine, like edible.

838
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:44,600
But yeah, but there were articles in the in like W Magazine and stuff of just like that

839
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:48,320
it was a party place brief until it all went to hell.

840
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,320
Okay, okay.

841
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,560
So that aspect of it worked.

842
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,560
They did a trick.

843
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,560
And why not?

844
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:57,800
Because what a great backdrop because you enter through a camera's lens and you there's

845
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,180
a runway.

846
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:03,200
And I saw an article that said and said the wait staff will bring you your food on the

847
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,200
runway.

848
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,200
I'm like, no, they won't.

849
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,680
They're not going to like go out of their way.

850
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:12,640
If it's a dinner rush, they're going to like get it out as fast as they can through whatever

851
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,640
means.

852
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:16,360
Like, I eat just standing on the run.

853
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:21,480
Like, like it's like what you're like burger like treat like a past canapé.

854
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:26,760
Like you're just like handed to you and you stand on the runway and eat a plate of chicken

855
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:27,760
fries.

856
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,960
Walk, walk back and forth.

857
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,760
You're not doing the show.

858
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,760
Walking.

859
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:38,160
I have to say again, there was pieces of fashion on the walls, but then there's like this wall

860
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:41,960
that just looks like the painting of Gotham in a Warner Brothers store.

861
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:42,960
It just says fashion.

862
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:50,960
Yeah, that's like really with yellow spotlights with a star in the middle.

863
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:56,240
That's like models felt OK about being there for the fancy parties.

864
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,320
I mean, I guess they probably didn't care a shit.

865
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,320
They don't.

866
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,440
They weren't like so worried about like whatever.

867
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,440
Where do I have to go?

868
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,320
OK, it's only us paying attention.

869
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,320
Pretty fun.

870
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,320
The velvet rope outside.

871
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:10,640
I mean, for the first few months, this might have been practical.

872
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:13,240
The like, yeah, there were at least a theme.

873
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:15,520
Like at least there was some theming.

874
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,040
You got to get at least at least they get some points for that.

875
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,040
The big camera.

876
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,720
Yeah, camera is pretty good.

877
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,880
I would love to walk through a camera lens.

878
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:23,880
Yeah, sure.

879
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:24,880
That's so fun.

880
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:28,120
That's like the honey they shrunk the kids playground shit.

881
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,120
Yeah, that's true.

882
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:32,240
Yeah, yeah, I shouldn't be disparaging.

883
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:35,360
And if they had animatronics, then I don't know.

884
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,680
They I guess they had something cooking here.

885
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:44,840
Yeah, if they had animatronics, you still yeah, it's still better than 90% of all restaurants.

886
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:48,680
Just by that fact, by virtue of a fact, even if it was a mannequin with a head that blinked

887
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:49,680
and that was it.

888
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:50,680
Yeah, pretty good.

889
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:57,000
Well, so they had some good things going, but they had a very bad thing going, which

890
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,800
is an owner who seems like the most crooked of any.

891
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:05,580
I don't you know, I'm interested in Robert Earl, but I don't I don't think I'd use the

892
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:06,720
word crooked necessarily.

893
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,600
I think he made some weird bad business decisions.

894
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:15,880
But this guy just from the get go never, I think, intended to just do things cleanly.

895
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:23,560
It was always about like siphoning stuff so you can have nice cars and buildings.

896
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:26,520
Did you read the Vulture article?

897
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,520
Maybe not.

898
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,520
The New York Magazine article?

899
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,000
I don't know which I read.

900
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,280
I read various various Tommaso materials.

901
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:37,240
So this is a description of Tommaso Buti from back in the day.

902
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:39,680
He's handsome, but not exceedingly so.

903
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:43,600
He claims to be five foot ten, but appears to be at least an inch or two shorter.

904
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:48,200
In fact, seated behind an enormous desk in his sprawling Murray Hill headquarters, which

905
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:54,600
once housed Andy Warhol's factory, the diminutive Buti might easily be mistaken for the boss's son.

906
00:35:54,600 --> 00:36:02,160
Buti says he never reads books and can recall only two he has completed, Pinocchio and Den of Thieves.

907
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:11,400
Indeed, it seems fitting that both his boyhood fantasy marriage and the financial scandal

908
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:14,400
that has engulfed him are dissolving simultaneously.

909
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,880
But yeah, he's like a con man.

910
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,400
This is another quote I just liked.

911
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:25,080
He attended, so he grew up like his dad was a bottle cap maker.

912
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,080
He was super poor.

913
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:30,080
He attended school in Florence and was by his own account a very poor student.

914
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,360
I am a two plus two kind of guy.

915
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,360
Oh wow.

916
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:38,520
A great guy to run a complicated business.

917
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,800
Yeah, he comes to New York and just starts scheming.

918
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:48,800
Yeah, he also created a story that was like he moved from Florence to America in search

919
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,800
of a better life and with a dream in his pocket.

920
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:56,000
But it was like, seemingly if you asked around, it was that he was avoiding a payment on a

921
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
BMW.

922
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
He didn't want to complete.

923
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:03,680
He was kind of chased out by creditors and came to America and was not rich, but just

924
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:08,080
kind of started, you know, talented Mr. Ripley, I guess.

925
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:11,560
He just kind of created the air and people bought it.

926
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:14,840
He was just always had the facade of rich guy.

927
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:24,360
Yeah, he bought his deli and he bought and then like, oh yeah, so he started his own

928
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,360
business on Wall Street.

929
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,600
It was a Felton Street deli.

930
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:29,520
He immediately began promoting his enormous success.

931
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:33,640
Trade newspapers reported that his deli sold 1000 lunches daily and was worth an estimated

932
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,480
10 million.

933
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,920
The reporter asks Booty about this.

934
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:37,920
He just starts laughing.

935
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,920
It's an article.

936
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,800
He tells me it doesn't mean anything.

937
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:46,920
As for how much profit the deli made, he has no idea and suggests I ask his former accountant,

938
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:51,000
quote, his name was Greg.

939
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,880
Last name I don't know.

940
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:58,640
So he just immediately just starts a shitty deli, lies about how much money it's making

941
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,680
and is like gets in the newspaper.

942
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:03,920
50 million dollars.

943
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:04,920
Talk to Greg.

944
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,360
Talk to Greg.

945
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,560
I'm not a last names kind of guy.

946
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:11,320
He's like 26 years old at this point.

947
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,320
Yeah.

948
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,920
And he was like being sued for BMW payments.

949
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,280
It's all there.

950
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:20,720
Even if there's a kernel of truth there, it's like, did you just buy the deli that's next

951
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:25,720
to a subway stop or next to a massive office building and people just run in and go like,

952
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,800
oh shit, I just need a sandwich or I'm going to pass out.

953
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:33,320
And it's like, oh, maybe did serve a thousand a day just by sheer like, oh, this is the

954
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,320
closest thing.

955
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,320
I have to get back to my office.

956
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,880
I work 20 hours a day.

957
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:40,120
People are coming from all over the building.

958
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:44,360
But the idea that when you just ask him about that article, he burst into laughter, makes

959
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,360
me think maybe it's not true.

960
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,360
I think I like him.

961
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:50,880
He's not a two plus two kind of guy.

962
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,880
Two plus two kind of guy.

963
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,760
He has a good sense of humor.

964
00:38:53,760 --> 00:39:01,240
He well, he also extremely quickly in this, like creating this rich guy hustle befriended

965
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:03,400
Kevin Costner right away.

966
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,840
Kevin Costner goes to nightclub openings and stuff.

967
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:06,840
I love that.

968
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:13,080
Of all the people too, because isn't he supposed to be about like grit and heart and Yellowstone?

969
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:15,080
Kevin Costner is already buff all first.

970
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:17,640
But isn't that his version of having a super popular deli?

971
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,640
Like isn't that his?

972
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:20,640
His?

973
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:24,360
That's how it feels when people talk about it, when people scold you with Yellowstone

974
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,360
statistics.

975
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,360
You know how many people watch that?

976
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,360
10 million.

977
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,960
I'm going to get into Yellowstone.

978
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,440
I promise everyone.

979
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:34,640
I know my woman who dyes my hair was like, you don't watch Yellowstone?

980
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,520
And I never even thought about it once.

981
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:38,960
She's like, you got, you got to watch Yellowstone.

982
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,200
Is anyone watching Yellowstone?

983
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:45,360
I know a couple people, but it's something I'm going to get into.

984
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,840
I promise everyone.

985
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:47,840
I'm going to do it.

986
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:48,840
Aren't I correct?

987
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,960
I've never said this out loud, but isn't it scolding?

988
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:55,080
It's what I, when I read stats about it, I'm like, but people really watch Yellowstone

989
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:58,840
and you're getting yelled at about it and you're defensive about it to no one.

990
00:39:58,840 --> 00:39:59,840
I'm going to watch it.

991
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,560
So who are you arguing back to?

992
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,800
Why do we all feel like Yellowstone's mad at us?

993
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,360
This is what Booty was teaching Costner at the club.

994
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:11,760
You've got to make a show and then make people, when they don't watch it, they feel bad.

995
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,320
They feel very bad.

996
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:18,000
They feel like they should be watching it, but they're not watching it.

997
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,040
That is eight, that's in your back pocket.

998
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:22,800
You know, you make a bunch of stinky movies that bomb.

999
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:27,440
If you then are just kind of like, you know, character actor who pops up every few years

1000
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:31,520
and then when you want to make a comeback, you have a show and you guilt people for not

1001
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,520
watching it.

1002
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,880
If you were to make, say, postman movie.

1003
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:39,200
You make a movie where William Hurt is inside your brain telling you to kill people, including

1004
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,200
Dane Cook.

1005
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:46,280
It's just, you have that movie, you have a movie, Clint Eastwood directs it.

1006
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:49,440
You tell a little boy to show you his penis and you tell him it's big, it's heartwarming

1007
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:52,560
moment in the middle of the movie.

1008
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:53,760
That's a good movie.

1009
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,760
People will like the movie.

1010
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,240
I don't think I know when that happens.

1011
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,400
A perfect world.

1012
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,000
Oh, I did not know.

1013
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,320
Oh, I thought you were talking about Mr. Brooks.

1014
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:04,080
I was talking about Mr. Brooks and then I was talking about a perfect world.

1015
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,080
I see.

1016
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:08,760
Where a kid goes like, my penis is little.

1017
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,240
And he's like, show me.

1018
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,600
And he's like, that's a good size.

1019
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,600
What?

1020
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,600
What?

1021
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,920
That's in the middle, guys, it's in the movie.

1022
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:16,920
Just check it out.

1023
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,400
It's right in the middle of the movie.

1024
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:24,440
Stuff like that is the best endorsement for like, films should be made like an office

1025
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,080
job, nine to five.

1026
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:31,120
Everyone works normal hours because then people would be well rested and someone would have

1027
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:35,120
the wherewithal to go like, hey, should we cut that part?

1028
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:37,600
That seems very weird.

1029
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:42,120
You're saying if a film set was a normal hours, they would wake up and they would...

1030
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:44,640
Everyone would be less insane in most departments.

1031
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:47,560
And you'd also go home at night and be having dinner with your wife.

1032
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:48,880
She'd be like, what are you shooting tomorrow?

1033
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:51,840
And you're like, oh, the scene where the kid shows me his penis and I tell him it's big.

1034
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:52,840
She's like, what?

1035
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,520
Yeah.

1036
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:57,280
And he's like, yeah, it's totally normal.

1037
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,280
She's like, can I see those sides?

1038
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:01,280
And then you'd be like, hmm, can you call Clint?

1039
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,840
Just double check this.

1040
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:08,760
Just know that it is going to be your face and your mouth saying those words to a child.

1041
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:14,520
I know it's a character, but you still look like what you look like.

1042
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:17,800
This is why you got to never have a wife, Kevin.

1043
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:22,480
Well, wait, though, if it's Clint, Clint, I think actually does work eight to four.

1044
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,480
You're right.

1045
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,480
Oh, yeah.

1046
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:27,840
Your example was about the ultimate person who doesn't.

1047
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,440
He does one take too.

1048
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,880
This is like the guy you want to work with the most.

1049
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:32,880
Very good.

1050
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:33,880
Yeah, that sounds great.

1051
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:34,880
Jason Perfect.

1052
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:35,880
Clint.

1053
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:37,320
Clint does it that way.

1054
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,320
Sinatra did it that way.

1055
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,320
Ricky Gervais does it that way.

1056
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,320
Ricky Gervais is the other one.

1057
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:42,640
And Woody Allen does it, I think, one or two takes.

1058
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,640
So those are all your guys, Jason.

1059
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:50,240
It's one of the few scenarios where Ricky comes out looking.

1060
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,240
I don't know, maybe Clint does.

1061
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,240
I don't know.

1062
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:55,920
But also Ricky's filming after life.

1063
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:59,360
I mean, how many takes do you need of every scene in after life?

1064
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:00,360
I guess that's true.

1065
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:01,360
Season three.

1066
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:02,360
That's a good point.

1067
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:05,360
You don't like my take numbers, do you?

1068
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:09,880
So it is interesting, though, though, while Booty's like, he's like, weaseling his way

1069
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:11,000
into Costner's life.

1070
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,760
He's also just befriending a lot of supermodels.

1071
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,440
Yeah, very successfully.

1072
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:17,440
And Mary's one.

1073
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:24,360
He did like he did have a supermodel wife, did, on the way up.

1074
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:28,840
And yeah, he just seems to be around them, around them enough to like sucker the fashion

1075
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:31,920
cafe ones into being part of this.

1076
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:35,360
I mean, he promised he seemed to keep it muddy enough.

1077
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:40,280
Like well, you'll get, you know, they got appearance fees and travel and lodging and

1078
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:43,000
the net earnings if it starts taking off.

1079
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:46,160
But it didn't start taking.

1080
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:50,560
I mean, well, I mean, maybe it held this event space for a little while.

1081
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:54,760
But then, like, they just quickly weren't paying for things.

1082
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:59,080
That seems like like Rockefeller Center sued them for rent.

1083
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,800
And yeah, they were here.

1084
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:06,840
Wait, by 98, the booties weren't paying taxes, rent, utility fees or premiums on

1085
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:08,680
unemployment insurance.

1086
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:15,000
Yet he's spending twenty thousand dollars on his birthday party and renting an apartment

1087
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,880
that costs twenty five grand a month.

1088
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:17,880
Great.

1089
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:22,640
People who supplied the business with stuff started saying you have to pay us cash.

1090
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,160
That's the only way.

1091
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:28,480
So these waffle fries are specifically a cash item.

1092
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,640
It's the only way they can do it.

1093
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,400
I'll tell these waffle fires.

1094
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:35,760
If you don't pass, these waffles are going for half the price to plant in Hollywood.

1095
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:38,000
I've already lost money on these.

1096
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,920
I just want to offload them. They're rotting.

1097
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:43,960
This is just so this is such a difference between like these type of people and then

1098
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:47,440
like a lot of people, probably even like my parents, where it's like they were probably

1099
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,960
like the credit card payment is a day late.

1100
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:53,720
Like we must like I'm going to drive it downtown or something like to get it to the company.

1101
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:54,840
Like we must.

1102
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:58,400
Oh, can you have to go to school every day or like it'll show up on your permanent record

1103
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:03,360
later versus this guy who's just lying his way into literally everything.

1104
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:06,320
This is how I think most of New York runs.

1105
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:06,920
Yes, it is.

1106
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:10,920
Also, the government like this is how most major institutions run.

1107
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:16,720
And then you get articles like with workers during the pandemic secretly working two jobs.

1108
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:19,960
And the writers are, you know, tisking them.

1109
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:22,200
And it's like, why? Why is that bad?

1110
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:23,800
The knowledge economy.

1111
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:25,760
You can work two jobs simultaneously.

1112
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,360
You're just sending different emails.

1113
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:29,960
You're just sending emails from two different addresses.

1114
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:33,120
It's bullshit. The high end people get to do it all the time.

1115
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:35,520
Why do regular workers get to scam like that?

1116
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:36,720
Yes, it is.

1117
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:42,600
It's a weird little lie that goes on where like everyone's kept like all the parents I know,

1118
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:50,280
like we're like, oh, we got to make sure everything's on time and like, oh, we're going to get in trouble or versus just if you just have to do this,

1119
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:56,680
but do it confidently and turn that switch on and do it for the rest of your life and never give in one iota.

1120
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:59,960
Right. Yes, you can never back down.

1121
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:08,040
And that's what he was also he had set up all these shell companies that fashion cafe money was just like pouring into.

1122
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:11,200
And nobody knew what they were, but he was in charge of most of them.

1123
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:19,280
He also had they're like even the so basically like there's all these Swiss bank accounts,

1124
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:21,800
also fashion cafe money is pouring into.

1125
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:29,280
And when the reporter just like asks him what what what's the bank account is, he gets mad.

1126
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:31,600
And he's like, just keep selling that you should ask.

1127
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:32,920
He has a twin brother, right?

1128
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:36,520
Or is it just a brother that was also kind of involved?

1129
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:37,640
What if that's fake?

1130
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:39,800
What if he's fake?

1131
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:43,680
Well, there's Andy Jeanette, the fashion cafe controller and there's his brother.

1132
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:47,720
So every time he's like, so what was going on with this shell company?

1133
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:50,360
He gets mad and he goes, ask my brother, ask Andy.

1134
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:58,280
He says at least a dozen times in what becomes an irritating check off life,

1135
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:00,120
check off like refrain.

1136
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:03,000
We wasting time spinning wheels.

1137
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:07,400
I love the idea.

1138
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:10,680
He could be like playing his brother.

1139
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:13,160
So like he gets like arrested and like, no, I'm Andy.

1140
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:15,000
I'm not the one you want.

1141
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,600
I am Andy. Don't don't arrest Andy.

1142
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:20,840
And they're like, oh, yeah, this ID says Andy, we got the wrong guy.

1143
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:22,240
Take me back to apartment.

1144
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:23,600
I get to muscle.

1145
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:25,840
I bring him down for you.

1146
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:28,240
Yeah, this is so like they just.

1147
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:33,120
Elected a new mayor in New York, and it was between the Republican,

1148
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:36,800
who was the head of the Guardian Angels, the guys who wear the red berets

1149
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:40,920
and patrol subway cars, or the Democrat, who's just a really weird guy

1150
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:45,160
who very clearly lives in New Jersey, but claims he's like, I live in this

1151
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:47,440
unfurnished basement in the Bronx.

1152
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:50,080
And those were your options.

1153
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:54,800
Like you just had to be a total weirdo and you can be the mayor of New York.

1154
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:56,760
And it's like charming.

1155
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:57,720
Yeah, people find it.

1156
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:00,360
It is fun. It is fun.

1157
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:02,720
Most people don't live like this.

1158
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:05,760
They're like in constant fear of getting in trouble for 100 things.

1159
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:09,880
They appreciate the people who are not afraid of any of this.

1160
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:12,600
They literally are like, it's all fake. I don't give a shit.

1161
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:14,720
I'll steal everyone's money.

1162
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:17,440
Well, that's why it's important to announce, I think, that we're

1163
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:19,560
for our upcoming New York live show.

1164
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:23,480
The ticket price has increased to three hundred and twenty dollars.

1165
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:25,640
That's right. And we will be there.

1166
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:30,920
We will definitely be there for sure.

1167
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:34,760
What else before it really came apart?

1168
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:35,800
At some point,

1169
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:40,520
Campbell and McPherson

1170
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:44,600
were accusing Tomaso of stealing 10 grand a day from them,

1171
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:48,480
which ended up like that adds up to 25 million.

1172
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:52,600
He just said, like, like, why don't you invest more further, please?

1173
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:54,800
And they they stuck with it.

1174
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:58,120
But Turlington was out. Schiffer was out.

1175
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:00,760
So he's losing models.

1176
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:03,440
And then they notice 10 grand a day.

1177
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:06,840
That seems like it's not even that you're not the owner

1178
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:09,080
and that you've kind of obfuscated.

1179
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:10,160
Are you the owner or not?

1180
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:13,480
Now it is like subtracting massive amounts of money.

1181
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:18,160
There is a so that it's just so funny to think about a massive scan

1182
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:21,480
going on next to the Barnes and Noble and ice skating rink.

1183
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:24,720
Everyone's like in town in town for Christmas,

1184
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:27,920
looking at the big tree, go to the ice skating rink and then buy this.

1185
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:29,240
Exciting here.

1186
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:30,720
Don't go in that door.

1187
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:33,200
There's a weird Italian man scamming supermodels.

1188
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:37,320
It's in Will Ferrell, SNL Will Ferrell walk into.

1189
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:39,400
Oh, good question.

1190
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:41,760
Is it Rockefeller Center? Oh, no, am I wrong?

1191
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,640
It's a medicine school. Where is it? It's at Rockefeller.

1192
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:45,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, so very possible.

1193
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:47,680
Yeah, all the maybe all the 90s.

1194
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:50,360
Max Weinberg probably went in.

1195
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:51,640
Yeah. Yeah.

1196
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:54,840
You know, he slicked his hair back, was like, maybe I'll see some models.

1197
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,600
It seems like there was fashion shows going on sometimes,

1198
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,920
just random fashion shows going on during the day.

1199
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:03,240
Like you'd be eating lunch and then there would just be a weird

1200
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:08,360
like an underwear fashion show and you'd watch it like you'd watch it

1201
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:11,800
while you ate your cheeseburger or whatever, which I like that.

1202
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:13,400
I mean, I like all of this.

1203
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:14,840
I would go there. I would go there.

1204
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:18,160
Yeah, I know. Yeah. Don't take any of this as being complaints.

1205
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:20,600
Yeah, I like the place and I think I like Tommaso.

1206
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:24,480
If there were like constant runway type shows going on.

1207
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,960
Yeah, that's actually again, living up to the theme.

1208
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:28,520
That's the thing we're always complaining about.

1209
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:30,880
But that's it. That's what else would you need in that place?

1210
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:33,400
Yeah. Other than the fun names on the menu.

1211
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:37,680
So yeah, so maybe Tommaso is like, yes, I give you space for fashion show.

1212
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:40,840
You get 10 a.m. in three days. Go.

1213
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:44,880
Restaurant will be open. Everyone will be dining.

1214
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:46,960
Do not mind fajita plates moving.

1215
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:51,920
Splattering onto models legs.

1216
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:56,360
Um, I so anyway, and then he's, you know, like they just have like

1217
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:01,240
on staff Mercedes and drivers waiting for them at all.

1218
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:03,920
Just like so much financial drain.

1219
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:05,000
Bottles are losing money.

1220
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,160
So it all comes apart at some point.

1221
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:10,800
Or he just I think the brand does not dissolve immediately,

1222
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,480
but he ducks out of it.

1223
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:15,200
He sells 400 percent of his shares.

1224
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:20,160
Apparently something they got him in trouble later.

1225
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:21,000
You're not allowed to do that.

1226
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,080
Or under that something somebody says in this.

1227
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:26,280
The Bugsy School of Economics.

1228
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:34,040
So by I think I want to say like in the year 98,

1229
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:37,880
he is facing a total of 15 million dollars in lawsuits

1230
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:41,120
from various people who were part of this organization.

1231
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:44,640
He ended up settling, I think, all of them, most of them

1232
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:46,840
for three hundred and fifty grand.

1233
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:49,880
So he got off pretty good there. Very good.

1234
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:53,280
So great. We are on the way.

1235
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:55,240
We're on the up and up.

1236
00:51:55,240 --> 00:52:01,040
He has a party around this time to celebrate.

1237
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:04,160
It's secretly because the lawsuits are being settled.

1238
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:07,040
That's why he's having it quietly. But

1239
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:10,960
in a public facing way, the reason the party is happening

1240
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:13,120
is because of his new job.

1241
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:16,480
He's finally broken loose of the shackles of the Fashion Cafe

1242
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:21,280
so that he can become the president and person running

1243
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:25,160
the Trump Management Group, Donald Trump's new

1244
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:29,560
modeling agency, modeling agency, Trump Management Group.

1245
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:32,040
Let's go. Here we go.

1246
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:37,840
So keep in mind the point after which he's been sued for 15

1247
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:39,760
million dollars and a massive business.

1248
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:44,680
By models, specifically the most famous models in the world.

1249
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:47,440
Hate him and said, you stole all our money.

1250
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:50,120
And this is all extremely public.

1251
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:53,400
This isn't like, you know, deep in a newspaper somewhere

1252
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:54,840
or it hasn't been printed about.

1253
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:56,720
There are big stories about all of this.

1254
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:59,880
And this is the exact moment that Donald Trump looks at this guy

1255
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:03,720
and says, you, it's time. Let's shake hands.

1256
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:05,400
Who wants to read the Trump quote?

1257
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:06,480
Does everyone have the Trump quote?

1258
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:08,840
I have it. Somebody got to do it.

1259
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:11,000
Feel free. OK.

1260
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:14,200
I made five billion because I bank on the right people.

1261
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:15,800
Trump told New York magazine.

1262
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:18,840
And I think he's a terrific, unjustly accused guy.

1263
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:23,120
Restaurants with all the unions and hamburgers you got to deal with

1264
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:25,000
are not for him.

1265
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:28,000
But Tomaso loves women and women love him back.

1266
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:30,160
He's a natural modeling.

1267
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:32,040
The same thing he said about Epstein.

1268
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:34,600
Yeah, I. The women, they love him.

1269
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:37,240
And I'll tell you, and he loves women and they love him back.

1270
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:38,520
Can you say that again?

1271
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:39,760
Don't they love him back?

1272
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:42,640
All the all the unions and hamburgers.

1273
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:44,360
All the unions and hamburgers.

1274
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:46,640
Yeah, with all the unions and hamburgers.

1275
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:47,840
You have to deal with.

1276
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:50,640
Follow up coach, you have this one, though he declines to name names.

1277
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:52,440
Trump insists the venture is already a success.

1278
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:55,400
We got all these big girls lining up to join, he says.

1279
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:59,640
Promising major defections from top agencies in the coming weeks.

1280
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:00,960
Didn't happen.

1281
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:06,080
As I got to this part and all the articles and stuff, I wrote down like a like,

1282
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:09,600
oh, Tomaso Booty has been treated very unfairly.

1283
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:11,560
They've been very unfair to the Masabuti.

1284
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:12,680
And then it happened.

1285
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:14,600
And then there is a quote.

1286
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:17,640
There is Trump going, like unjustly accused guy.

1287
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:18,520
He's very good.

1288
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:20,240
This was like this is what I'm saying.

1289
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:23,000
Like people before, even the presidents who were like this, Mr.

1290
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,680
Trump is a very smart, very successful businessman.

1291
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:31,320
Like, yes, reasonable people were like, surely this guy couldn't be a six.

1292
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:34,560
Like he couldn't have all these ventures if he was a crazy failure

1293
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:36,240
and a crazy dumb idiot.

1294
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:40,080
My father, the person who taught me everything I know, says like,

1295
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:42,560
he's a smart guy. Good business.

1296
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:45,320
No, he's a look and he wouldn't be on the run, you know, if he couldn't run

1297
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:47,360
that organization, if it wasn't a smart guy.

1298
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:48,800
This is the handsome guy, too.

1299
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:53,480
But for before the presidency, this was a consensus.

1300
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:55,640
Yes. This is what's so wild.

1301
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:59,080
I at least I mean, it was not nothing good came out of a presidency,

1302
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:00,880
but at least a lot of people were like, you know what?

1303
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:05,080
Maybe some of these rich people are fucking idiots

1304
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:07,960
and we shouldn't trust them.

1305
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:09,800
The restaurants with the hamburgers.

1306
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:12,200
Let me tell you, Tomaso, he's good with the women.

1307
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:13,240
Not so good with the hamburger.

1308
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:16,680
The hamburgers have been very unfair to Mr. Tomaso.

1309
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:19,120
He had to deal with them. They were all over him.

1310
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:20,880
They were dragging him down.

1311
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:23,040
Hamburgers jumping on him left and right.

1312
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:26,920
All the unions and hamburgers, you have to deal with this business.

1313
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:29,840
But the quotes were exactly the same as when he was president.

1314
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:33,400
He was making appointing just as dumb people and crazy people

1315
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:35,560
as he was during these Black Lives Matter people.

1316
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:36,960
They're like the Antifa.

1317
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:38,840
They're all like a bunch of hamburgers.

1318
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:40,400
And you've got to deal with them.

1319
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:42,720
And we deal with them all. So that's what we do.

1320
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:46,120
It's just it was all there all along, is all I'm saying.

1321
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:49,000
Why wasn't Tomaso in the cabinet?

1322
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:51,800
I well, well, was he?

1323
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:52,720
Did I miss this?

1324
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:54,800
You don't know what happens next?

1325
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:55,840
Oh, I missed this then.

1326
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:57,560
OK, great. OK, OK.

1327
00:55:57,560 --> 00:55:59,520
There is a specific answer because you're right.

1328
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,080
This why wouldn't he have been, of course, is a perfect candidate.

1329
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:08,200
No. So the modeling age, the modeling group starts and.

1330
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:14,840
But eventually, Governor Spitzer is going after the boobies.

1331
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:18,440
Like more is uncovered than what was already public.

1332
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:24,480
So by 2000, the two brothers are being indicted on 51 federal accounts each

1333
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:28,720
of they don't get to share a fraud, money laundering and conspiracy.

1334
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,400
And the fashion cafe is gone.

1335
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:32,520
Even whoever he like tossed it to ran.

1336
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:36,560
It's all gone by that point with the governor after him and all these

1337
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:41,360
counts of everything, even Trump's like, I don't know, maybe I picked the wrong guy.

1338
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:44,800
This is a rare case of Trump kind of like stepping away slowly.

1339
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:50,440
So the booties have to flee back to Italy,

1340
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:53,680
where hopefully they didn't have to deal with the BMW payment.

1341
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,080
They were waiting at the airport.

1342
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:57,960
Different city, please.

1343
00:56:57,960 --> 00:56:59,560
Like Lyle Landley when he lands.

1344
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:02,680
Let's find an island.

1345
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:04,120
Northaber Brook or whatever.

1346
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:10,520
Also, by the way, that the party where he's celebrating, settling the lawsuits

1347
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:14,920
and partnering with Trump a week after that, his supermodel wife divorces him.

1348
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:16,800
So that's done.

1349
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,680
She was very unfair to him.

1350
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:24,000
Abandoning him at this hard time would have been better off marrying a hamburger.

1351
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:28,480
Well, within this New York Times article, New York magazine article,

1352
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:31,440
the reporters like talking to the wife and she's like, nobody.

1353
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:34,160
He's a very good man and he didn't do any of this stuff.

1354
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:37,520
And then the New York magazine reporters like, what about the loans

1355
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:39,520
that you co-signed with him?

1356
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:41,520
And she goes, what?

1357
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:44,160
And then she divorces him a week later.

1358
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:49,440
She's like, it's because of the article within the article.

1359
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:53,360
She finds out that she's that her names on all these papers she didn't know about.

1360
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:54,720
Oh, my God.

1361
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:58,840
He probably invited the reporter like, come see my party,

1362
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:01,320
my sexy lawsuit settling party.

1363
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:04,080
Meet my beautiful wife.

1364
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:05,480
You guys talk, OK?

1365
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:07,520
I'll be with Mr. Trump.

1366
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:08,800
He's great.

1367
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:11,280
So what did you talk about?

1368
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:18,480
Either he didn't do much as much wrong or he just got off light.

1369
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:22,440
But I feel like Francesco booty isn't talked about a lot.

1370
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:26,480
Yeah, yeah, there's an entire other person indicted for as many things.

1371
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:29,800
Yeah. Why isn't why are why are we blaming Tomaso?

1372
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:32,280
I can't find anything about Francesco.

1373
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:34,680
There was a fake fake guy.

1374
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:39,400
I think that's what you do when you're this high up.

1375
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:41,560
You can just make a guy, yeah.

1376
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:46,240
Invent companies, you can just co-sign loans, you know, can sell your debt.

1377
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:48,320
Yeah, you're right.

1378
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:51,960
At this point in time, if if ever,

1379
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:55,440
I mean, you know, Donald has kind of wriggled out of pretty much

1380
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:56,960
everything that's happened to him.

1381
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:00,000
But if you really got back to record into a corner and he needed to say,

1382
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:02,640
no, that stuff was my brother Ronald.

1383
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:09,120
45% of the country is yelling about like, why don't you believe Ronald?

1384
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:11,240
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1385
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:13,680
It was Ronald. He dragged Donald's poor name.

1386
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:16,920
Overnight, yeah, a lot of people will like completely,

1387
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:20,720
like retroactively be like, yeah, I've seen him on every campaign stop.

1388
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:23,000
I remember him in my mind.

1389
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:26,400
I met right shook Donald's hand and it was a good firm handshake.

1390
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:28,920
And I shook Ronald's and it was limp and like a fish.

1391
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:31,440
Yeah, that Ronald no good.

1392
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:33,320
Yeah, yeah.

1393
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:36,800
Mr. Mr. Muller, arrest this Ronald.

1394
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:40,800
Muller looked into it and he was like, I think Ronald does exist.

1395
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:44,200
Oh, oh, well, must have gotten away.

1396
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:46,800
He lives in the sea now. I tried.

1397
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:53,600
So anyways, if Tommaso and if he exists,

1398
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:58,520
Francesco are in Italy for a while for some somehow again,

1399
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:00,960
in this way that our parents or other people wouldn't get to do.

1400
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:06,240
They like keep avoiding the suits and the crimes and years go by.

1401
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:08,280
They know they're going to have to pay for it at some point.

1402
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:12,200
But the more time we wait and just avoid, let the stuff build up.

1403
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:15,080
Maybe we can get out of it somehow.

1404
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:20,160
And sure enough, after many, many years have passed on January 20th,

1405
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:24,800
the final day of Donald Trump's first presidency

1406
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:29,680
on a list of pardons, I didn't know a long list of pardons.

1407
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:34,280
Wow. So includes Steve Bannon and Lil Wayne,

1408
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:37,440
one of the one hundred and forty three people.

1409
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:40,200
Wow. Tommaso. Wow. I missed it.

1410
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:44,000
Wow. Forgiven specifically for his crimes that involved

1411
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:47,600
the Fashion Cafe 20 years prior.

1412
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:50,240
Was that the Scooter Libby? Was he on the list too that day?

1413
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:51,560
Oh, I'm not sure. Or was that before?

1414
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:53,840
I don't know. I think Bannon was the headline that day.

1415
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:56,360
That was the big day. Yeah. Wow.

1416
01:00:56,360 --> 01:00:59,360
But deep in there was Tommaso.

1417
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:02,360
Yeah. So January 20th, right?

1418
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:05,840
January 6th was two weeks ago.

1419
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:11,120
And what Trump is dealing with, his priority is making sure that Tommaso

1420
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:15,320
isn't chased by those damn hamburgers anymore.

1421
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:21,200
Also, the booties to be arrested for fraud,

1422
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:24,040
bankruptcy and money laundering in Italy.

1423
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:28,360
Italy, a place not known for like,

1424
01:01:29,080 --> 01:01:32,120
you know, who's really got their laws and governments in order.

1425
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:35,840
Italy, you know, the place where like, you know,

1426
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:40,440
Judy Mussolini is still in off, like the granddaughter or whatever,

1427
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:44,360
is in office and pops up on Twitter every now and then to say something insane.

1428
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:47,720
I'm not following Mussolini.

1429
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:52,080
I texted Scott about this, but what do you guys think Tommaso

1430
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:55,160
booties up to now? Did you check?

1431
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:56,600
I obviously missed. He's on Twitter also.

1432
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:58,360
I missed his last few years, obviously.

1433
01:01:58,360 --> 01:02:03,040
My guess is master class in business, in restaurant administration.

1434
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:05,800
No, this is what he tweeted a month ago.

1435
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:09,600
Thanks at Elrond Apes for this Hunter Zombie ape.

1436
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:12,040
Oh, NFTs, baby.

1437
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:16,200
This is his Elrond ape that he bought.

1438
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:18,240
It looks kind of like a board ape.

1439
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:19,280
What's Elrond?

1440
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:22,400
It's just it's like a discount type of ape.

1441
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:24,880
It's it's based on another type of it's not.

1442
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:29,040
You have to buy it with Elrond tokens, not Bitcoin.

1443
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:32,720
It's an even uglier like head shop rip off art.

1444
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:36,280
Yeah. So he's really into crypto.

1445
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:37,720
Oh, of course. I love it.

1446
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:40,400
And it's his like entire feed is nonsense.

1447
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:41,840
It's like crypto nonsense.

1448
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:45,320
It's it's really just like all those weird words.

1449
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:49,600
You know, Tommaso, the women you he doesn't want to be in the modeling group

1450
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:51,360
with the women you got to deal with.

1451
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:53,040
He has to be wants to be with the apes.

1452
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:55,840
The apes are tree are not treating him very badly.

1453
01:02:56,080 --> 01:02:58,320
The apes are treating him very well, frankly.

1454
01:02:58,320 --> 01:03:00,240
He's wonderful. These beautiful apes.

1455
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:03,800
He is all of our beautiful, beautiful apes.

1456
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,880
We love and we love our Elrond.

1457
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:07,720
Some of these got some of the biggest apes.

1458
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:10,000
It's some of the biggest women.

1459
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,800
You know, he's have some of the biggest apes from twenty twenty four.

1460
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:14,280
Everybody gets an Elrond.

1461
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:15,560
Everyone gets an Elrond.

1462
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:18,000
I watch it on the Gorilla Channel in the White House.

1463
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:19,040
I watched them.

1464
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:22,720
How do we don't like our sharks, but we love our Elrond apes.

1465
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:25,880
Do we think that he was ever at the White House during the presidency?

1466
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:27,280
Is there any proof of that?

1467
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:28,560
He might have had to stay in Italy.

1468
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:31,120
Yeah, it seems like he couldn't come into.

1469
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:34,320
But now it's oh, he but he did come back to America.

1470
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:37,760
He immediately moved back to America and has a massive penthouse

1471
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:39,440
really near Trump Tower.

1472
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:42,120
He reset everything as it was. Right.

1473
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:44,480
It's fine. Most cable news cable.

1474
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:47,080
All these cable news that were set to fill 24 hours

1475
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:51,560
and then like the head of some hedge fund or something gets on there

1476
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:54,840
and says everyone needs to be back in the office 40 hours a week.

1477
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,560
And surely they're running a million scams

1478
01:03:57,560 --> 01:04:00,920
and they're running a million things and they're just reputable.

1479
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:02,840
You know, maybe these are our betters.

1480
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:05,160
Maybe this is the guy to put the podcast restaurant

1481
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:07,160
we were talking about together.

1482
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:08,320
Oh, yeah.

1483
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:11,960
As long as we're willing to make it an entirely ape based.

1484
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:13,480
Yeah, sure. All right.

1485
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:15,640
So, yeah, Mike's fishing.

1486
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:19,800
He needs to be able to launder crypto through it.

1487
01:04:19,840 --> 01:04:23,640
Fine. You agree to an appearance fee that you know you'll never get.

1488
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:27,640
And as long as you don't have a stake in it, it's fine.

1489
01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:29,320
He just loses other people's money.

1490
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:34,120
OK, as long as we don't give him our info, then we're OK.

1491
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:37,120
If he doesn't specifically have our bank account info, then we're fine.

1492
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:40,800
Right. And if we get to I don't care about getting paid to be at the opening,

1493
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:43,640
as long as the three of us get to burst through a paper backdrop.

1494
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:47,200
Yeah. And he has to look the other way as I'm filling garbage bags

1495
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:49,840
with Tennessee whiskey chicken.

1496
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:57,000
And we'd like his brother to be there, too.

1497
01:04:57,360 --> 01:05:00,840
I want him to read a third book, just to promise he'll read.

1498
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:04,080
Rich Dad Poor Dad. Yeah.

1499
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:06,400
Yeah. Art of the deal.

1500
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:09,160
Well, I don't know.

1501
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:12,520
I think, you know, keep on keeping on, Tomaso,

1502
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:18,000
especially if it involves funding our dreams and other great American dreams.

1503
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:21,840
And everybody want to go in on an ape.

1504
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:23,640
Yeah, I will. Yeah, I'll buy an ape.

1505
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:25,720
But one of these apes, the Elan Ape, what is it called?

1506
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:27,880
Elrond Ape. Elrond, excuse me. Not Elan.

1507
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:31,000
Well, that name has never been associated with anything suspicious.

1508
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,760
Elrond Ape. Elrond Ape.

1509
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:36,920
This is probably fine.

1510
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:40,560
I went on the Elrond Ape's website

1511
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:42,960
and they're not even making a cartoon or anything fun like that.

1512
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:45,040
They're just really boring. Oh, man.

1513
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:48,160
Well, we also I just made you guys aware of the new

1514
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:50,760
there's a Johnny Depp NFT thing coming. So

1515
01:05:51,560 --> 01:05:52,480
the paintings.

1516
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:55,720
Yeah, Johnny's paintings of his friends and I know.

1517
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:59,000
But also one is of of an imaginary person.

1518
01:05:59,000 --> 01:05:59,880
Did you see that?

1519
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:05,080
Is it was it's a drawing of a character that regularly appears in his son's dreams.

1520
01:06:05,080 --> 01:06:07,160
Yeah, that's the one I want.

1521
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:08,880
Yeah. OK.

1522
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:10,480
Yes, you have a question.

1523
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:12,520
I follow. All right.

1524
01:06:12,520 --> 01:06:14,080
I have to go back to his dreams.

1525
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:17,640
I think that would have like taken the air out of me, let alone his son.

1526
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:22,960
Wow. Very cool that Johnny Depp is willing like a tulpa, like a Baba

1527
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:26,840
duker, it follows creature into existence through his NFT paintings.

1528
01:06:26,840 --> 01:06:28,240
I have the I have the picture here.

1529
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:31,200
In addition to Johnny's friends and heroes, he has included a picture

1530
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:34,840
of himself treated in the same way, an image of an old family friend,

1531
01:06:35,040 --> 01:06:39,440
the dog, Moo, and one of Bunny Man, the legendary subject

1532
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:41,680
of one of his son's dreams.

1533
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:43,640
Liberal use of the word legendary.

1534
01:06:43,640 --> 01:06:48,560
Legendary to Bunny Man.

1535
01:06:48,920 --> 01:06:52,680
So, yeah, if you want to look into this, neverfeertruth.com.

1536
01:06:53,120 --> 01:06:56,240
And NFT, NFT, never.

1537
01:06:57,360 --> 01:07:02,040
That's some like Gary Busey bullshit like NFT Stanford, Never Fear Truth.

1538
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:03,920
Like everything's.

1539
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:06,320
I want to go full Val Kilmer.

1540
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:08,080
Like I want him to just.

1541
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:10,600
But he want I don't want him to be in the digital space.

1542
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:12,880
I want him to be making paintings I can buy.

1543
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:16,560
Like I own the I own a Val Kilmer painting of Mark Twain.

1544
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,720
Right. Amy Nicholson bought for me.

1545
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:21,080
Do you really know that? Wow. Wow.

1546
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:23,440
You're not that expensive. Oh, yeah.

1547
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:26,360
So you want like the Bunny Man, but you want a real painting of the.

1548
01:07:26,360 --> 01:07:28,280
Yeah, I don't want an NFT of the Bunny Man.

1549
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:30,120
I want a thing I can look at and touch.

1550
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:35,280
But when we're all in the metaverse, you can probably display that NFT

1551
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:38,040
in your little home or apartment in the metaverse.

1552
01:07:38,040 --> 01:07:41,880
Maybe they'll have some sort of like, you know, what it's called, like a glove

1553
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:43,840
that if I touch, it'll feel like I'm touching it like.

1554
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:45,280
They for sure have a glove.

1555
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:47,160
Haptic feedback on your fingers.

1556
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:48,720
That glove will happen.

1557
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:52,720
Yeah. So so there is that there is that aspect of the NFTs.

1558
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:55,680
Yeah. You should start collecting Bored Twain's ace.

1559
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:03,760
My favorite auction house, Julien's, last week did a Julian Lennon NFT auction

1560
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:08,960
where they were auctioning off photos of things that John Lennon gave his son.

1561
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:11,320
Like just pictures.

1562
01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:14,160
Yeah. So but it was really confusing because it's like a guitar.

1563
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:16,320
You're like, oh, it's only three thousand dollars to buy this guitar

1564
01:08:16,320 --> 01:08:18,880
that John Lennon owned. It's like, no, it's just a picture of it.

1565
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:21,040
It's a digital RIO. Yeah.

1566
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:23,600
A photograph of a dusty Atari console.

1567
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:31,560
Well, what we're finding here is that,

1568
01:08:32,440 --> 01:08:34,600
you know, the 90s were a different time.

1569
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:39,000
Now celebrities and everything that they do and get involved

1570
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,080
in financially is trustworthy.

1571
01:08:41,080 --> 01:08:43,200
Yeah, they are not.

1572
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:45,440
Yeah, they aren't getting into scams like they were.

1573
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:50,960
We can and we can and should get involved in and support their businesses,

1574
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:53,080
which brings me to point number two.

1575
01:08:53,480 --> 01:08:54,600
You know, right. Right.

1576
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:56,040
There's a point number two. I forgot.

1577
01:08:56,040 --> 01:08:56,960
Yes. Yeah. Yeah.

1578
01:08:56,960 --> 01:09:00,880
Well, there's a bag up there and that contains the answers that you're looking for.

1579
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:02,680
What's in the bag? What's in the bag?

1580
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:07,040
It's it's good things. It is good things.

1581
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:11,120
And the best thing about it is that if you thought you were done

1582
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:14,560
with Robert Earl content, oh, my gosh, you are not.

1583
01:09:15,280 --> 01:09:20,040
We're digging into Robert Earle's virtual dining concepts.

1584
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:22,000
Jason, you know about this.

1585
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:27,200
I know that during the pandemic, you did virtual takeout.

1586
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:30,840
You did one of Robert Earle's many ghost kitchens

1587
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:33,400
that came out of Bucatubeppo, correct?

1588
01:09:34,320 --> 01:09:37,400
Yeah, Scott. Well, just to clarify, I did it twice.

1589
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:39,560
Wow. Wow. I did it once, too.

1590
01:09:39,560 --> 01:09:41,480
I did it, too, if we were talking about the same thing.

1591
01:09:41,480 --> 01:09:44,520
Geez. Yeah. Wait. And what was it called?

1592
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:46,400
What? How did they frame this?

1593
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:47,840
Guy Fieri's Flavor Town.

1594
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:49,360
Guy Fieri's Flavor Town.

1595
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:51,840
I did it for Doughboys. Wow. OK. OK.

1596
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:55,040
Delivered from the city walk.

1597
01:09:55,080 --> 01:09:57,400
Bucatubeppo is where the Ghost Kitchen is.

1598
01:09:57,400 --> 01:10:01,520
Although there is also one was at least out of the Ghost Kitchen

1599
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:04,400
operating out of the Bucatubeppo in Encino.

1600
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:07,080
Peppo's. Peppo is back.

1601
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:10,560
Peppo is back. Peppo. Peppo.

1602
01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:14,160
What is it supposed to be and what do I say?

1603
01:10:14,160 --> 01:10:16,200
Peppo. It's supposed to be Peppo.

1604
01:10:16,200 --> 01:10:18,320
Yeah, and you said Peppo again.

1605
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:20,720
That's like the bunny man is going to appear tonight and be like Peppo.

1606
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:23,160
Peppo, Jason.

1607
01:10:23,160 --> 01:10:25,440
Johnny Depp's son's dream.

1608
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:28,240
Johnny Depp's son's legendary dream character.

1609
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:31,680
No, you're only a legend for Johnny Depp's son's dreams.

1610
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:36,000
Oh, if the second episode we're going to do today is not going to give me

1611
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,400
enough nightmares, now I got to deal with the bunny man.

1612
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:42,120
Yep. I also know I also remember this and I've never gotten clarification

1613
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:46,880
is, but I recall I feel like some at some point you canceled an episode

1614
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:48,600
that we were going to do. Remember this, Mike?

1615
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:50,760
There was or I don't know if it was a cancel or just that you were

1616
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:54,800
complaining about incredible stomach pain and that we were going back and like,

1617
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:59,640
wait a minute, I think he did the Guy Fieri Ghost Kitchen like a day or two ago.

1618
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:01,200
Oh, yeah, that's vaguely familiar.

1619
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:03,520
Sound familiar at all.

1620
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:05,280
I was wondering if you were having stomach.

1621
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:07,920
I think that we like pushed something because you were having a stomach issue.

1622
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:12,680
Yeah, I think I think the yeah, I mean, I would believe that there

1623
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:15,640
was only once or twice where I was like, yeah, I know who this I'm not feeling.

1624
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:17,840
Not a common thing, but yeah, not good.

1625
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:20,160
Huh? Not great food.

1626
01:11:20,160 --> 01:11:22,040
Oh, I got areas. Yeah.

1627
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:25,320
Chicken Chicken Guy is good in Florida.

1628
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:29,080
The delivery version was fine.

1629
01:11:29,080 --> 01:11:31,760
I was a little annoyed. You couldn't custom.

1630
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:35,800
I think that he has started its own app because he got so much feedback like, hey,

1631
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:38,400
man, maybe don't use Postmates and Uber Eats if you can avoid it.

1632
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:41,280
So he started his own app and I think you can customize a little more.

1633
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:44,200
But I got the burger with mac and cheese on it.

1634
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:48,000
And then it also just had a mound of lettuce underneath the mac and cheese,

1635
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:51,200
which is one of the worst textures I've ever experienced.

1636
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:53,720
And you're sure this didn't cause you food poisoning.

1637
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:56,600
No, this wasn't it. No, it's always something innocuous.

1638
01:11:56,600 --> 01:12:00,040
It's not the stunty foods like I ate the KFC Beyond Chicken last night.

1639
01:12:00,040 --> 01:12:02,920
And I feel fine. OK, it's not great. It's not great.

1640
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:05,600
You may as well just buy the frozen Beyond Chicken. It's better.

1641
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:10,880
Oh, sure. Yeah. Well, I I have high hopes for what's what's in this bag.

1642
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:13,720
And don't worry, it's not like something that needed to hold.

1643
01:12:13,720 --> 01:12:15,080
I was going to say it better not.

1644
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:20,240
Yeah. It's the potato chip cheesecake just could yielding ice cream.

1645
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:22,240
Yeah. No.

1646
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:25,640
So Robert Earl has gotten into the ghost kitchen business

1647
01:12:25,640 --> 01:12:27,960
and I knew about this guy, Fieri one.

1648
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:31,240
But I didn't know about this bevy of other ones.

1649
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:34,360
Really quickly, we should maybe say that.

1650
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:38,160
All right. Remember at the end of the Planet Hollywood episode that we just did,

1651
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:43,280
we discussed his son, Robbie Earle's new influencer restaurant,

1652
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:44,760
The Breakfast Club.

1653
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:47,960
And guess what? Mike, Jason and I went.

1654
01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:51,520
We went to The Breakfast Club and we got there

1655
01:12:51,720 --> 01:12:54,320
and there were four outdoor tables that were full.

1656
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:57,560
And we asked if they had more and they said no.

1657
01:12:57,720 --> 01:12:59,240
So we said, let's not do it.

1658
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:02,000
And we left. So that is what happened at The Breakfast Club. Yeah.

1659
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:06,040
You took a photo outside, which I have yet to post.

1660
01:13:06,040 --> 01:13:07,480
We do have that.

1661
01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:11,240
However, I wanted to bring this up that then because I felt crazy like,

1662
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:14,440
but I thought I looked at photos and there was like a huge patio.

1663
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:17,400
And then I looked again and there is a huge patio.

1664
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:22,320
There's a like there is a massive many table patio that I saw on the website.

1665
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:24,320
But we asked and they said there was nothing.

1666
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:26,000
So they just weren't running it.

1667
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:29,480
Not today. Or he said not at the moment, I think.

1668
01:13:29,480 --> 01:13:31,840
Like, but he really mush mouthed it.

1669
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:35,840
Maybe it was temporarily being used for an influencer

1670
01:13:36,080 --> 01:13:39,360
private event for like one of the polls or no one was there.

1671
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:41,440
And the waitstaff didn't want to walk up the stairs.

1672
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:43,360
Oh, yeah, that's probably it.

1673
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:44,520
I mean, it could have been being used.

1674
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:49,280
It is by the like influencer apartment building.

1675
01:13:49,320 --> 01:13:50,640
Oh, we watched a video.

1676
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:53,440
Someone was doing the like, yeah, had the steady

1677
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:57,280
an iPhone mounted on a steady cam thing was clearly making content.

1678
01:13:57,560 --> 01:14:00,680
Yes, because he was filming and like trying to keep a smooth shot

1679
01:14:00,680 --> 01:14:01,920
while he opened a door.

1680
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:04,800
And then and then the subjects that he was filming came out.

1681
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:07,280
And it was a guy in like Game of Thrones wardrobe.

1682
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:09,760
Yeah, like a big sword or a Viking guy.

1683
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:11,160
Yeah, that's exciting.

1684
01:14:11,160 --> 01:14:13,520
When Vine was the thing, that's why it was so funny

1685
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:15,240
that that apartment building was on Vine.

1686
01:14:15,240 --> 01:14:17,240
And that's what Logan Paul moved there.

1687
01:14:17,240 --> 01:14:19,520
But now it doesn't matter anymore that it's on Vine.

1688
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:20,280
It doesn't matter.

1689
01:14:20,280 --> 01:14:23,240
We're still pushing it as a Blake, a place to create,

1690
01:14:23,240 --> 01:14:26,160
like a place to fuel your energies and, you know,

1691
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:28,480
there's a Trader Joe's in the basement.

1692
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:30,720
You know, cool.

1693
01:14:30,720 --> 01:14:32,000
Anyway, so we tried it.

1694
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:36,120
But you remember also that parked on the street was a truck for Mr.

1695
01:14:36,120 --> 01:14:38,760
Beast Burger. We took a photo of Jason there.

1696
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:42,800
Mr. Beast is one of the celebrities,

1697
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:47,040
question mark, who Robert Earl is doing Ghost Kitchens with.

1698
01:14:47,080 --> 01:14:51,400
Right. That that is what that was maybe like a delivery truck for that.

1699
01:14:52,040 --> 01:14:56,440
Am I Mr. Beast is is what very famous and ignorant or what?

1700
01:14:56,600 --> 01:15:00,880
Yeah, it's kind of like not in our wheelhouse, but I think he's a person

1701
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:04,040
who gets like millions of views for every video every week or something.

1702
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:07,880
And then his fans get really mad if you say anything critical of like,

1703
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:10,760
why did you do a real life squid game with a million dollar

1704
01:15:10,760 --> 01:15:12,840
giveaway at the end? Did you miss the point of squid game?

1705
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:13,760
And he clearly did.

1706
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:16,120
He clearly seems like the guy, the guy who would miss the point.

1707
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:21,280
I mean, a guy with a beard making a big face in the thumbnail.

1708
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:23,120
I missed the point.

1709
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:28,960
Me? So he's so murder me fans.

1710
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:35,160
I don't care. Anyway, there's a that's just one of the many celebrities

1711
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:36,600
who Mr.

1712
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:41,280
Earl's been working with trying to keep kitchens full and busy during the pandemic.

1713
01:15:41,880 --> 01:15:44,880
Why there's let me find other ones.

1714
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:49,080
I believe there is a Steve Harvey one.

1715
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:51,280
I'm not sure what for.

1716
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,080
I don't have the website in front of me.

1717
01:15:53,080 --> 01:15:55,320
I think there's there's some Steve Harvey brand.

1718
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:59,680
There is a Mario Lopez Tordes brand.

1719
01:15:59,720 --> 01:16:04,880
Yeah, I saw that. I think one I wrote down was Polly D's

1720
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:07,240
Italian subs.

1721
01:16:07,240 --> 01:16:08,840
So Jersey Shore.

1722
01:16:08,840 --> 01:16:10,520
Yeah, yeah.

1723
01:16:10,520 --> 01:16:14,000
And I started clicking on these and I was interested in like, well, can I get

1724
01:16:14,240 --> 01:16:17,000
any of this? And a lot of it is regional.

1725
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:21,040
The Polly D only available in Jersey or five states.

1726
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:22,400
But Jersey is one of them. Right.

1727
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:23,880
I'd imagine.

1728
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:28,200
I don't think anyone has started an outpost of whatever Steve Harvey

1729
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:29,720
is trying to do.

1730
01:16:29,720 --> 01:16:33,800
But there was one where I clicked on it and was shocked to learn that it is

1731
01:16:34,280 --> 01:16:37,840
essentially everywhere in the country, including around here.

1732
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:40,520
And that is Mariah Carey's cookies.

1733
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:41,960
Oh, yeah.

1734
01:16:41,960 --> 01:16:43,040
Wow.

1735
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:47,280
Going to check out Mariah Carey's cookies, which I think I'm especially

1736
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:48,560
glad you're here for this, Eva.

1737
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:49,720
You're a great baker.

1738
01:16:49,720 --> 01:16:50,440
Oh, my God.

1739
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:54,640
And you can judge the work of the artisans who put together

1740
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:58,640
Mariah Carey's cookies, which I'll go prepare and turn around in a second.

1741
01:16:59,680 --> 01:17:02,280
So Mariah Carey and cookies.

1742
01:17:02,280 --> 01:17:02,800
Why?

1743
01:17:03,480 --> 01:17:08,480
I don't really know yet because the brand is just and their social media is like

1744
01:17:08,680 --> 01:17:11,920
there's a picture of Mariah, not with cookies.

1745
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:12,760
He's just her.

1746
01:17:12,760 --> 01:17:14,960
And there's pictures of cookies without Mariah.

1747
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:19,880
Finally, I think last Valentine's Day, she finally filmed a little content

1748
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:24,160
like she's kind of like kicking her legs in the kitchen and like stirring a pot.

1749
01:17:24,160 --> 01:17:26,680
And she says it's ready and sings a little bit.

1750
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:31,120
And that's kind of the only tying together of her and the brand

1751
01:17:31,160 --> 01:17:32,800
that I have noticed.

1752
01:17:34,240 --> 01:17:41,760
There's then you go to make the order and there's one item that's related to her,

1753
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:43,720
which is Mimi's mix.

1754
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:46,520
That's about all that you can do that has any.

1755
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:50,440
And there's like sometimes there's a little cartoon of her on it or something.

1756
01:17:50,680 --> 01:17:55,720
Otherwise, I just don't really know what the what the tie together is.

1757
01:17:55,720 --> 01:17:58,680
I guess the fonts are sort of like diva fonts.

1758
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:00,040
That's real.

1759
01:18:00,040 --> 01:18:01,240
Something.

1760
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:04,760
But anyways, it's purely a cookie brand.

1761
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:08,040
I guess you could probably get like milk and soda and stuff with it, too.

1762
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,640
And it occurred to me like, well, can I just go pick them up?

1763
01:18:11,640 --> 01:18:13,160
Do they have to be delivered?

1764
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:17,760
And the answer is no, you have to that you cannot go to a physical location.

1765
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:19,960
And I started wondering, what are they hiding?

1766
01:18:19,960 --> 01:18:23,840
Why can't I see Mariah's cookies kitchen?

1767
01:18:24,520 --> 01:18:28,240
What you can do is select the address that you're going to order it from

1768
01:18:28,240 --> 01:18:30,280
and then look at what the address is.

1769
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:34,880
One of the addresses, sure enough, was the city walk.

1770
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:37,600
Book it. OK, that's kind of to be expected. Right.

1771
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:42,160
Another one was on Ikea way in her bank.

1772
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:45,560
And I thought, are they using the Ikea kitchen?

1773
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:48,120
Is this like where they make the meatballs?

1774
01:18:48,120 --> 01:18:51,520
But now we're doing cookies in there somehow.

1775
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:52,360
What are you thinking?

1776
01:18:52,360 --> 01:18:54,600
Well, Hell's Kitchen is set up there right now.

1777
01:18:55,120 --> 01:18:57,880
What is that? Hell's Kitchen, the show Gordon Ramsay show?

1778
01:18:57,880 --> 01:19:00,640
Yeah. So the whole like, you know, when you see the crazy outdoor

1779
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:03,800
like Hell's Kitchen, that's set up right at the Ikea.

1780
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:07,240
So you drive by there, the whole you can see the whole outside set of it even to.

1781
01:19:07,880 --> 01:19:09,640
In addition, they're shooting inside as well.

1782
01:19:09,640 --> 01:19:12,840
Like around the warehouses kind of or like the offices.

1783
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:16,640
There's a lot of like non-distinct businesses around that area.

1784
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:20,920
You mean built the Ikea, the old Ikea, the old Ikea,

1785
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:23,640
which is where they shot Flora's Lava and some other stuff.

1786
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:26,360
OK, it's not the currently operational Ikea.

1787
01:19:26,360 --> 01:19:28,200
Gotcha. Yeah, yeah, I thought that's sorry.

1788
01:19:28,200 --> 01:19:28,960
That's it is not.

1789
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:31,520
Well, I don't think this is some secret Gordon Ramsay endeavor

1790
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:33,840
because then I looked it up and it just turns out Ikea way

1791
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:36,640
happens to be the address that Black Angus is on.

1792
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:40,760
Oh, they switched Ikea right away because of the new Ikea.

1793
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:42,440
That's technically Ikea way now.

1794
01:19:42,440 --> 01:19:44,880
Yeah, Black Angus is on the same street as the BJ's.

1795
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:49,680
Yes, but I think if you look at that, that is exactly where it becomes Ikea.

1796
01:19:49,680 --> 01:19:50,600
Way, right. Right. Right. Right.

1797
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:52,120
I think is open.

1798
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:53,440
Yeah, I think so.

1799
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:54,880
I'm also a ghost kitchen.

1800
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:56,280
That stresses me out.

1801
01:19:56,280 --> 01:19:58,080
Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1802
01:19:58,080 --> 01:20:02,800
And it's and it's really weird, right, that like now that place has to make cookies.

1803
01:20:03,720 --> 01:20:05,680
I just started. It's just so strange to me.

1804
01:20:05,680 --> 01:20:10,400
Like, let's chart this order of things that you can get cookies.

1805
01:20:10,640 --> 01:20:15,160
And the people who make money from the cookies are Robert Earl,

1806
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:19,640
the people at Black Angus and Bucatubeppo and Mariah Carey.

1807
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:22,200
What a complicated.

1808
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:25,800
Yeah, it's it's your dollars go a lot of places with these things.

1809
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:28,760
But possibly the people making the cookies don't get any more money

1810
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:30,600
for making multiple types.

1811
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:31,560
Probably not.

1812
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:34,960
Having to have the different ingredients for the different types of cookies.

1813
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:36,160
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

1814
01:20:36,160 --> 01:20:37,080
It's pretty crazy.

1815
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:37,840
The back of the house.

1816
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:41,320
Black Angus probably aren't seeing seeing the Mariah money.

1817
01:20:41,320 --> 01:20:43,200
Yeah, I don't think so.

1818
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:47,480
Can I add I found an article and we don't have time to go down this rabbit hole.

1819
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:48,960
The headline is just Mr.

1820
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:53,080
Beesberger parent on 20 million dollar series A round.

1821
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:55,480
Future of celeb backed brands.

1822
01:20:55,800 --> 01:20:59,680
So he raised around 20 million dollars of investing money.

1823
01:20:59,960 --> 01:21:04,320
Again, who knows where that money is coming from or going to?

1824
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:06,360
They don't know what bank accounts.

1825
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:07,680
Beast doesn't know Mr.

1826
01:21:07,680 --> 01:21:09,200
Beast's parent, Robert Earl.

1827
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:12,000
And oh, yeah, I guess I'm leaving out Robbie's brother.

1828
01:21:12,040 --> 01:21:14,280
I guess I'm leaving out the most important detail.

1829
01:21:14,280 --> 01:21:17,440
Giant picture of Robert Earl with the microphone.

1830
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:19,560
Mariah, Mr.

1831
01:21:19,560 --> 01:21:23,800
Bees and Robbie, the siblings and Guy brothers and sisters.

1832
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:24,640
Mm hmm.

1833
01:21:25,640 --> 01:21:30,320
And our betters, our superior, this is our favorite stars, Mariah and Mr. Beast.

1834
01:21:30,520 --> 01:21:33,920
Anyway, I'm going to I'm going to start getting the stuff out here.

1835
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:35,920
Let me adjust the microphone.

1836
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:38,880
If any of this is just boring and you can even take it off the mic

1837
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:39,760
and just hold it.

1838
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:41,080
Well, I need both hands, though.

1839
01:21:41,080 --> 01:21:42,040
So, right, right, right.

1840
01:21:42,040 --> 01:21:43,400
Let's spin around the bag.

1841
01:21:43,400 --> 01:21:45,200
Mariah's. Wow, a real cheap.

1842
01:21:45,200 --> 01:21:46,520
It's not even like a real bag.

1843
01:21:46,520 --> 01:21:49,040
It's like a sticker they put on the front of a white bag.

1844
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:50,080
Yes, I'd say so.

1845
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:51,520
Just pretty like crumpley.

1846
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:53,880
And now we have here

1847
01:21:53,880 --> 01:21:55,560
two boxes.

1848
01:21:55,560 --> 01:21:58,080
These both arrived at my place last night.

1849
01:21:58,240 --> 01:22:00,760
And I can't say which is which.

1850
01:22:00,760 --> 01:22:04,400
We're going to do a blind taste test because I want you guys to decide

1851
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:07,800
which of the identical orders is preferable

1852
01:22:08,280 --> 01:22:11,080
and not knowing which cookies were made at Bukit Dibbo.

1853
01:22:11,080 --> 01:22:12,160
Oh, wow.

1854
01:22:12,160 --> 01:22:14,360
Cookies were made at Black Angus.

1855
01:22:14,360 --> 01:22:16,560
I myself have to keep them straight.

1856
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:18,560
And I believe that I know.

1857
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:19,800
But these haven't even been opened.

1858
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:21,120
It's it's kind of different packaging.

1859
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:24,680
This one is just pretty like generic pink.

1860
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:29,640
And it says on the back, I love my cookies warmed at three seventy five

1861
01:22:29,640 --> 01:22:31,480
for 90 seconds.

1862
01:22:31,480 --> 01:22:32,680
Heart me me.

1863
01:22:32,680 --> 01:22:35,080
I mean, should we do we I don't know if we should do that.

1864
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:37,080
Do that. That's a lot of warming, I guess.

1865
01:22:37,080 --> 01:22:38,240
We have to pause the thing entirely.

1866
01:22:38,240 --> 01:22:39,320
It's been a little warm.

1867
01:22:39,320 --> 01:22:41,200
I mean, it's already been warming.

1868
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:42,560
It's been warming for 90 minutes.

1869
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:45,200
And then this one does have a little like this.

1870
01:22:45,240 --> 01:22:49,080
This one updated with Valentine's packaging and is a little like

1871
01:22:49,320 --> 01:22:51,560
cute cartoon Mariah. Right.

1872
01:22:51,560 --> 01:22:54,240
And a QR code you can scan for exclusive offers.

1873
01:22:54,280 --> 01:22:55,880
And it says Scott on it.

1874
01:22:55,880 --> 01:22:56,760
Yes. Yeah.

1875
01:22:56,760 --> 01:22:57,520
Like Sharpie.

1876
01:22:57,520 --> 01:22:59,840
Cute design is kind of undercut by my name.

1877
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:01,720
Just just scrawled on there.

1878
01:23:01,720 --> 01:23:03,880
I wonder if maybe we should just pause for a second.

1879
01:23:03,880 --> 01:23:04,920
Maybe I'll prepare the plate.

1880
01:23:04,920 --> 01:23:05,680
Yeah, that's good.

1881
01:23:05,680 --> 01:23:07,600
And then we'll do the little taste test.

1882
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:09,120
But it's the same things.

1883
01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:12,000
I did Mimi's mix, but amended it with one more.

1884
01:23:12,160 --> 01:23:15,800
So we're going to it should be identical lineups of cookies.

1885
01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:17,840
But we'll see. We'll find out.

1886
01:23:17,880 --> 01:23:22,920
So you guys have to do one of each cookie, but it's got to be the same

1887
01:23:23,120 --> 01:23:24,880
and see if we can notice any difference.

1888
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:26,000
OK, OK.

1889
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,400
But yeah, between Bucca and Black Angus.

1890
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:30,000
All right.

1891
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:30,880
It's great.

1892
01:23:33,400 --> 01:23:35,480
He's both smell like a lemon.

1893
01:23:36,160 --> 01:23:37,920
Maybe they were on the lemon one.

1894
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:40,880
Maybe the lemon is overpowering here.

1895
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:42,920
If we're recording, maybe I'll see.

1896
01:23:42,920 --> 01:23:45,160
Yeah. Well, the lemon is pretty strong, I will say.

1897
01:23:46,080 --> 01:23:47,520
So it might have impacted all of it.

1898
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:51,360
So I have oatmeal raisin, but the left one smells so much like lemon

1899
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:54,320
and the right one, I don't know if it's a Phantom Lemon smell or if it's still.

1900
01:23:54,640 --> 01:23:58,800
That's confusing because the left one had paper separating the cookies.

1901
01:23:58,920 --> 01:23:59,680
Some of them.

1902
01:23:59,680 --> 01:24:02,320
This smells and the right one, they were just all in a stack.

1903
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:06,240
The left one also came in the white bag

1904
01:24:06,920 --> 01:24:10,880
and the the the dark pink one just showed up.

1905
01:24:11,200 --> 01:24:13,120
The guy. Yeah, the guy just brought the box up.

1906
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:15,960
Yeah. And both delivery

1907
01:24:15,960 --> 01:24:20,120
drivers did not read the instructions for delivery

1908
01:24:20,120 --> 01:24:22,600
because I said I didn't want a doorbell and they both rang it.

1909
01:24:22,760 --> 01:24:26,560
So whatever the system is, probably the drivers are not getting the instructions.

1910
01:24:27,080 --> 01:24:28,760
Let me see. Let me say what's on this.

1911
01:24:28,760 --> 01:24:33,000
This customized Mimi's mix that I got chocolate chunk, triple chocolate

1912
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:38,080
chunk, Heath bar, lemon cooler, spiced oatmeal raisin and white chocolate cranberry.

1913
01:24:38,920 --> 01:24:41,920
Is anybody in deep enough to have strong opinions?

1914
01:24:41,960 --> 01:24:43,120
I've only had one of them so far.

1915
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:44,240
This is not lemon.

1916
01:24:44,240 --> 01:24:45,400
I'm eating what it feels.

1917
01:24:45,400 --> 01:24:47,280
It feels like a lemon cookie.

1918
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:49,440
I'm also getting hints of lemon.

1919
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:52,880
I the lemon smells really strong.

1920
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:54,680
That's what I chose.

1921
01:24:54,680 --> 01:24:56,560
So it probably impacted all of them.

1922
01:24:56,560 --> 01:24:57,720
I didn't get any lemon.

1923
01:24:57,720 --> 01:24:58,880
Yours might have been on top.

1924
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:01,480
So maybe you had enough lemon separation. Yeah.

1925
01:25:02,760 --> 01:25:04,880
Any strong feelings either way.

1926
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:07,640
And we're comparing same types of lemon is overwhelming.

1927
01:25:07,640 --> 01:25:09,880
This cookie doesn't even taste like an oatmeal raisin.

1928
01:25:09,960 --> 01:25:12,080
And that's the that's the your your left the left.

1929
01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:13,360
They were called A.

1930
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:18,240
OK, A is A is A is light pink.

1931
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:25,280
And I don't want to say which is which A is is light pink and B is dark pink.

1932
01:25:25,280 --> 01:25:31,120
I feel like these are clearly made from prepackaged pre-portioned frozen cookie dough.

1933
01:25:31,320 --> 01:25:33,360
OK, yes. They're almost identical.

1934
01:25:33,360 --> 01:25:39,320
OK, but I will say that the left hand white bag is marginally better baked.

1935
01:25:39,920 --> 01:25:41,160
Interesting. OK, OK.

1936
01:25:41,160 --> 01:25:45,760
That's maybe the only thing that they're doing that they're adding to the process is the baking.

1937
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:48,200
One tenth of one point.

1938
01:25:48,200 --> 01:25:53,760
See, I I think the flavors are both about the same on these.

1939
01:25:55,280 --> 01:25:59,880
I think mine, the right one B is better baked.

1940
01:26:00,160 --> 01:26:02,440
Oh, this this is supposed to be Heath Bar.

1941
01:26:03,480 --> 01:26:07,680
I'm not really getting any hints of chocolate, which the Heath Bar is toffee covered in chocolate.

1942
01:26:08,040 --> 01:26:10,120
I'm frankly not getting many hints of toffee.

1943
01:26:10,120 --> 01:26:12,400
It's just generically sweet.

1944
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:13,920
Are you sure it's not?

1945
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:15,280
You sure you got the right one?

1946
01:26:15,280 --> 01:26:18,640
You think it is whatever is in there is representing Heath Bar or toffee?

1947
01:26:18,640 --> 01:26:21,680
Because it's the texture of what happens when you bake toffee.

1948
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:23,800
I think it is that.

1949
01:26:23,800 --> 01:26:25,240
I mean, I can try a different one.

1950
01:26:25,240 --> 01:26:27,400
You know me, I can switch gears pretty quickly.

1951
01:26:27,400 --> 01:26:28,440
If you want me to try.

1952
01:26:28,440 --> 01:26:29,640
Very chocolatey.

1953
01:26:29,640 --> 01:26:31,120
So I think I got the triple chocolate.

1954
01:26:31,120 --> 01:26:34,440
Potentially. But then maybe that that dark one could be.

1955
01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:35,240
I do want to save one.

1956
01:26:35,240 --> 01:26:38,080
I'm going to just break off pieces of the dark one and try each.

1957
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:39,160
OK, sure.

1958
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:41,760
Jason is pacing.

1959
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:44,160
Jason is really upset, honestly.

1960
01:26:44,840 --> 01:26:47,080
You almost fell over in his chair again.

1961
01:26:47,080 --> 01:26:49,040
Before they were baked.

1962
01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:53,280
Yeah, I just I'm having a similar reaction A and B on the

1963
01:26:53,720 --> 01:26:55,320
cranberry white chocolate.

1964
01:26:55,320 --> 01:26:57,200
Now, I'm a cookie aficionado.

1965
01:26:57,200 --> 01:27:00,160
And I think it is that B was just kind of baked more

1966
01:27:01,240 --> 01:27:04,600
because it's it's the A is chewier.

1967
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:06,320
B is crispier.

1968
01:27:06,320 --> 01:27:08,280
Usually I like a little chewier, but

1969
01:27:09,120 --> 01:27:11,480
I don't know that first one.

1970
01:27:11,480 --> 01:27:13,520
Yeah, I don't think the flavors were there.

1971
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:14,800
I think the cranberry white chocolate

1972
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:16,920
is a lot more flavors of what you're expecting.

1973
01:27:16,920 --> 01:27:19,480
But the Heath Bar one overall was kind of a dud.

1974
01:27:19,480 --> 01:27:23,680
The right my right hand to the pink is a harder cookie.

1975
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:25,760
It's a crunchier cookie.

1976
01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:29,520
The left is softer for me, but there's not a bite on this left one

1977
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:30,960
that doesn't taste like a lemon cookie.

1978
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:33,000
It's crazy. I can't get away from it.

1979
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:34,720
It's a polluted.

1980
01:27:34,720 --> 01:27:36,000
It's a polluted cookie.

1981
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:37,960
Well, radiated by lemon.

1982
01:27:37,960 --> 01:27:41,480
So do we do we want to vote on what we say?

1983
01:27:41,480 --> 01:27:43,280
Your A or B?

1984
01:27:43,880 --> 01:27:44,680
Yeah.

1985
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:47,680
Who's who's saying A?

1986
01:27:48,160 --> 01:27:50,680
Wait, A, tell me A is pink.

1987
01:27:50,680 --> 01:27:52,280
A is light.

1988
01:27:52,280 --> 01:27:54,280
A is light pink, not dark.

1989
01:27:54,280 --> 01:27:55,680
It says A on the bag.

1990
01:27:55,680 --> 01:27:58,160
Oh, yeah. A is on the left.

1991
01:27:58,160 --> 01:28:00,200
And so it's B for you guys.

1992
01:28:00,200 --> 01:28:02,080
No, Jason's going A. Oh, you're right.

1993
01:28:02,080 --> 01:28:03,200
I think I am going A.

1994
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:06,680
I mean, I like a chewier cookie because I think I could.

1995
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:10,600
I don't like the generically like the overcooked

1996
01:28:10,600 --> 01:28:12,680
just kind of makes it feel a little more generic.

1997
01:28:12,680 --> 01:28:15,960
I would say A if I could actually taste the oatmeal raisin

1998
01:28:15,960 --> 01:28:18,520
because it is a softer cookie, which I generally enjoy more.

1999
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:21,480
So I would say that, but I can in good conscience.

2000
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:26,400
I find one of my issues with

2001
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:30,280
cookies of this kind is that they're so generically rich

2002
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:33,240
where there's just like the cookie itself.

2003
01:28:33,240 --> 01:28:37,720
If you remove the add ins, the cookie backbone

2004
01:28:37,720 --> 01:28:40,000
is not particularly flavorful.

2005
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:41,640
Sure, sure.

2006
01:28:42,200 --> 01:28:45,280
Well, so most of us went with A then,

2007
01:28:45,280 --> 01:28:49,160
if not for this lemon tainting, yes, what Mike's experiencing.

2008
01:28:50,040 --> 01:28:54,480
Do we then want to guess which came from which?

2009
01:28:55,720 --> 01:28:59,560
Who believes that A, which most of us picked as better quality,

2010
01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:03,520
um, who believes that that is Bucatabeppo?

2011
01:29:06,160 --> 01:29:08,240
Wait, how does this work? I know.

2012
01:29:08,240 --> 01:29:10,360
Well, then they say B.

2013
01:29:10,360 --> 01:29:13,280
OK, then you guys say, OK, so the winner,

2014
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:16,000
the superior one was Black Angus.

2015
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:18,160
Black Angus, the home of the better cook.

2016
01:29:18,160 --> 01:29:19,840
Because it's such a bad bag.

2017
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:22,200
Like, and Bucatabeppo is ghost

2018
01:29:22,200 --> 01:29:25,480
kitchen for so many companies, it would have the proper packaging.

2019
01:29:25,640 --> 01:29:27,640
Black Angus.

2020
01:29:27,640 --> 01:29:30,520
Who knows how many ghost kitchens they're running?

2021
01:29:30,520 --> 01:29:32,280
Probably they have to still be Black Angus.

2022
01:29:32,280 --> 01:29:34,680
Nobody's ordering Bucatabeppo.

2023
01:29:34,680 --> 01:29:36,040
Sure. Yeah.

2024
01:29:36,040 --> 01:29:38,920
Oh, you mean nobody's doing takeout from that organization?

2025
01:29:38,920 --> 01:29:40,160
It's like they're running.

2026
01:29:40,160 --> 01:29:41,520
They're almost primarily.

2027
01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:43,480
Guy Fieri and stuff. Doing all this other.

2028
01:29:43,480 --> 01:29:48,920
So that shitty ass Mariah's cookies bag that looks like it was like a sub

2029
01:29:48,920 --> 01:29:51,080
middle school bake sale.

2030
01:29:51,080 --> 01:29:53,560
That's Black Angus.

2031
01:29:53,560 --> 01:29:54,600
Wow. Wow.

2032
01:29:54,640 --> 01:29:57,920
So your tell was aesthetics less than than cookie.

2033
01:29:58,160 --> 01:30:01,200
We don't we don't think that there is something somehow superior

2034
01:30:01,200 --> 01:30:04,680
about their baking process, which you only nudged it up a tiny bit.

2035
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:08,960
Well, so the baked goods I got from Guy's kitchen were not good either.

2036
01:30:09,560 --> 01:30:12,120
Would you generally call all of this not good?

2037
01:30:12,680 --> 01:30:14,160
Yeah. OK.

2038
01:30:14,160 --> 01:30:17,040
But I appreciate it. Jason, vote.

2039
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:20,640
I'm not going to look a gift horse in the mouth.

2040
01:30:20,640 --> 01:30:21,960
I appreciate the free cookies.

2041
01:30:21,960 --> 01:30:23,840
I wish I had every recording.

2042
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:25,760
But yeah, I don't know.

2043
01:30:25,760 --> 01:30:28,320
I wouldn't I wouldn't jump at it. Yeah.

2044
01:30:28,320 --> 01:30:32,080
You know, I think a lot of these stunty places or ghost kitchen places,

2045
01:30:32,080 --> 01:30:34,440
that is kind of the takeaway.

2046
01:30:34,440 --> 01:30:35,840
We're like, that wasn't great.

2047
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:37,720
Mike, any feelings about quality?

2048
01:30:37,720 --> 01:30:39,520
Would you do this again?

2049
01:30:39,520 --> 01:30:44,200
Would I get free cookies or would I order for them from your own volition?

2050
01:30:44,200 --> 01:30:46,200
Get Mariah's cookies.

2051
01:30:46,200 --> 01:30:47,760
Yeah, probably. Hmm.

2052
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:50,560
I mean, just what it would be like, they would the the fun of it

2053
01:30:50,560 --> 01:30:53,280
being Mariah's cookies would be the like the reason.

2054
01:30:53,320 --> 01:30:54,080
Yeah, yeah.

2055
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:57,480
It would be the novelty versus like these are these are fine.

2056
01:30:57,480 --> 01:31:03,040
I mean, like sometimes I buy like like day old Walmart cookies.

2057
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:05,200
If I'm in the in the back of the.

2058
01:31:05,200 --> 01:31:06,400
Yeah, good for dunking.

2059
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:09,840
And look, those are not always those are like I if I chew

2060
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,280
chew them and they're like bad, which they rarely are.

2061
01:31:12,280 --> 01:31:15,480
They always seem like like around this quality.

2062
01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:17,960
These are not bad, but they're close to grocery store.

2063
01:31:17,960 --> 01:31:19,080
Right. Yes, exactly.

2064
01:31:19,080 --> 01:31:20,400
It's like grocery store.

2065
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:22,280
But, you know, no, but I bet you pay.

2066
01:31:22,280 --> 01:31:25,680
Pray to premium versus just going to the Ralph's and getting.

2067
01:31:25,680 --> 01:31:27,800
Oh, can we guess how much this was?

2068
01:31:27,800 --> 01:31:28,920
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

2069
01:31:28,920 --> 01:31:30,000
Guess a single one.

2070
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,480
And then and then you besides that, I did two of them.

2071
01:31:33,280 --> 01:31:36,160
See, you box each cookie or about all the stuff.

2072
01:31:36,640 --> 01:31:40,800
So how many were in box five, six, six each box.

2073
01:31:41,640 --> 01:31:43,800
Thirty eight dollars.

2074
01:31:43,800 --> 01:31:45,560
I think that OK, good.

2075
01:31:45,560 --> 01:31:47,960
Jason, I was going to say twenty five.

2076
01:31:48,120 --> 01:31:49,560
Twenty five is right. Yeah.

2077
01:31:49,560 --> 01:31:51,120
For delivery or with delivery.

2078
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:52,200
That's with all the stuff.

2079
01:31:52,200 --> 01:31:55,720
And if you tip OK, which I'm like, you do, because it's your order.

2080
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:59,440
They're bringing a little box up for five bucks a cookie.

2081
01:32:00,440 --> 01:32:02,360
Holy crap, Scott.

2082
01:32:02,360 --> 01:32:05,240
Mariah, Mariah, Mariah, what are we doing?

2083
01:32:07,240 --> 01:32:10,280
I love it. Can I just tell your listeners the ghost kitchen

2084
01:32:10,280 --> 01:32:13,200
I'm excited about this week, which is only up for a limited week,

2085
01:32:13,200 --> 01:32:16,960
but it will be going on Wednesday, which I'm thinking about ordering.

2086
01:32:17,680 --> 01:32:19,480
Yeah. Mom's spaghetti.

2087
01:32:19,480 --> 01:32:20,840
Oh, yes. What?

2088
01:32:20,840 --> 01:32:22,680
Temporarily in L.A. for a week.

2089
01:32:22,680 --> 01:32:24,760
From what entity? From Eminem.

2090
01:32:25,040 --> 01:32:25,840
He's doing it.

2091
01:32:25,840 --> 01:32:28,280
He's running it out of the Polly's deli downtown.

2092
01:32:28,280 --> 01:32:30,560
Yeah. But they're also ghost kitchens all over.

2093
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:33,040
I could get it in Santa Monica. Oh, OK. Yeah.

2094
01:32:33,880 --> 01:32:35,800
It's a it's yeah, it's a limited time.

2095
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:37,480
I'm very excited for this Polly's deli.

2096
01:32:37,480 --> 01:32:40,160
This is a place that Pete Davidson keeps wearing their hats and shirts.

2097
01:32:40,480 --> 01:32:43,360
But it is like an East Coast deli and they're supposed to open

2098
01:32:43,360 --> 01:32:44,840
another one in the valley.

2099
01:32:44,840 --> 01:32:48,080
And they have like pork roll, egg and cheese and chicken

2100
01:32:48,080 --> 01:32:50,320
cutlet like with broccoli, Rob.

2101
01:32:50,320 --> 01:32:52,760
Oh, I actually would love to try that. Yeah.

2102
01:32:52,760 --> 01:32:55,040
But also mom's spaghetti.

2103
01:32:55,040 --> 01:32:57,080
It's so funny. Yeah.

2104
01:32:57,080 --> 01:33:01,280
I mean, I wonder like to know this is almost like a Harry Potter level.

2105
01:33:01,560 --> 01:33:03,080
We've heard it discussed so much.

2106
01:33:03,080 --> 01:33:05,000
What is butterbeer tastes like?

2107
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:06,200
What is mom's spaghetti?

2108
01:33:06,200 --> 01:33:08,760
Mom's spaghetti. Famous cinematic foods.

2109
01:33:08,760 --> 01:33:11,920
He should do a limited time one.

2110
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:14,240
That's the Venom spaghetti. That's squid ink.

2111
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:16,720
Oh, yeah.

2112
01:33:18,080 --> 01:33:21,000
With the venom cheese, if anyone saw the venom cheese going around,

2113
01:33:21,160 --> 01:33:22,560
it's like, oh, bring it up on your phone.

2114
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:26,280
Yeah. Charcoal raclette like or mozzarella or something.

2115
01:33:26,280 --> 01:33:28,560
It's black. That's good.

2116
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:32,080
Yeah. It's like just imagine venom, like the symbiote alien,

2117
01:33:32,080 --> 01:33:35,240
like just melting off into like your food. Whoa.

2118
01:33:35,240 --> 01:33:39,040
I want to say, though, I don't want all celebrity restaurants

2119
01:33:39,040 --> 01:33:41,480
to be ghost kitchens. I want to go through.

2120
01:33:41,560 --> 01:33:43,520
I want to walk into a submarine.

2121
01:33:43,520 --> 01:33:45,680
I want to walk through a camera.

2122
01:33:45,680 --> 01:33:52,280
I want to see Ken Griffey Junior be stressed out in person, not on an app.

2123
01:33:52,720 --> 01:33:55,280
So ghost kitchens for now, Earl.

2124
01:33:55,560 --> 01:34:02,320
But follow Paulie's, Robbie's lead, open brick and mortar things.

2125
01:34:02,320 --> 01:34:06,160
Experiential, even if we didn't experience the experiential,

2126
01:34:06,160 --> 01:34:07,800
hypothetically, you could.

2127
01:34:07,800 --> 01:34:11,280
There's a wall with a bunch of donuts taped to it or something.

2128
01:34:11,880 --> 01:34:13,040
We want to go see it.

2129
01:34:13,040 --> 01:34:15,840
Is Robert Earl exploring the idea of the metaverse, though,

2130
01:34:16,160 --> 01:34:19,480
where you might get something delivered and then you sort of eat it

2131
01:34:19,480 --> 01:34:23,080
while you're in the metaverse and you're in a themed virtual environment?

2132
01:34:23,200 --> 01:34:25,080
I hope he is exploring.

2133
01:34:25,080 --> 01:34:29,600
Defector has done a great series that caused the relationship to end.

2134
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:34,200
But the 76ers, the Philadelphia 76ers, were supposed to pair

2135
01:34:34,200 --> 01:34:36,320
with this metaverse company called Color World.

2136
01:34:36,600 --> 01:34:39,160
And when they dug in, they found all this weird stuff.

2137
01:34:39,160 --> 01:34:41,320
Like, did this used to be a flooring company?

2138
01:34:41,560 --> 01:34:43,400
And why are there two different

2139
01:34:44,520 --> 01:34:49,880
people listed as CEOs every time we check and one is named like Solution?

2140
01:34:50,200 --> 01:34:55,680
And like, it's not clear what this company does or how it's going to make a metaverse

2141
01:34:55,680 --> 01:34:56,680
for a basketball team.

2142
01:34:56,680 --> 01:35:00,920
And then like two weeks later, 76ers are like, we are not going forward

2143
01:35:00,920 --> 01:35:03,480
with the Color World partnership.

2144
01:35:03,480 --> 01:35:05,560
That's like a Four Seasons Total Landscape.

2145
01:35:05,680 --> 01:35:06,760
Yeah, it is.

2146
01:35:06,760 --> 01:35:08,720
Like a paint store that they accidentally.

2147
01:35:09,680 --> 01:35:12,160
I guess we can do metaverse.

2148
01:35:12,160 --> 01:35:13,400
Yes. Yeah.

2149
01:35:13,400 --> 01:35:15,640
The quick snapping at the sun in the back.

2150
01:35:15,640 --> 01:35:18,920
Look up metaverse. What is metaverse?

2151
01:35:19,960 --> 01:35:21,440
Yeah, well, absolutely.

2152
01:35:21,440 --> 01:35:23,960
Physical locations.

2153
01:35:23,960 --> 01:35:27,480
But maybe in the metaverse, we can dream of each Mariah Carey cookie being

2154
01:35:27,760 --> 01:35:29,280
even more expensive.

2155
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:30,080
Oh, yeah, for sure.

2156
01:35:30,080 --> 01:35:32,280
Well, it'll be you have to pay for it with crypto.

2157
01:35:33,160 --> 01:35:36,000
So it'll be at least be at least be more confusing.

2158
01:35:36,040 --> 01:35:38,520
Elrond coin with Elrond.

2159
01:35:38,520 --> 01:35:39,520
Elrond coin.

2160
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:44,400
You can sell your Elrond ape or your Elrond ape can eat the virtual cookie.

2161
01:35:44,400 --> 01:35:46,440
Can I feed my.

2162
01:35:46,440 --> 01:35:50,560
You walk up to it like a little like avatar of this fake Mariah

2163
01:35:50,560 --> 01:35:53,920
and say Mariah, can my ape eat your cookie?

2164
01:35:56,480 --> 01:35:58,840
That's progress for you.

2165
01:35:58,840 --> 01:36:01,800
All right. Well, Eva Anderson, you have again survived

2166
01:36:02,120 --> 01:36:03,880
an episode of Celebriwery.

2167
01:36:03,880 --> 01:36:05,880
Oh, thrived.

2168
01:36:05,880 --> 01:36:07,200
Oh, wonderful.

2169
01:36:07,240 --> 01:36:09,800
Thank you for joining us.

2170
01:36:09,800 --> 01:36:10,640
I mean, you'll be bad.

2171
01:36:10,640 --> 01:36:12,800
Is there anything you want to plug specifically on this?

2172
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:15,880
I still want to give you the opportunity.

2173
01:36:15,880 --> 01:36:19,800
Look, it's you know, it's a platform to get your brand out there.

2174
01:36:20,120 --> 01:36:22,720
I want to plug mom's spaghetti.

2175
01:36:24,160 --> 01:36:25,600
Wonderful.

2176
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:27,840
And you'll be back soon enough.

2177
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:30,080
We'll see you to close out the month.

2178
01:36:30,080 --> 01:36:31,280
See you soon. Mm hmm.
