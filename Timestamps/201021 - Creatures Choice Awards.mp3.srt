00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:25,040
Mummies and gentle ghouls, welcome to a grand discussion of the Creatures Choice Awards on

3
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:32,000
Hauntcast, The Fright, The Cemetery Gate, I'm Scott Gravedigner, joined by, I forget them all.

4
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,760
Well, Kill Girls, Kill Girl-son. No, no, no, no, no, no.

5
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,560
Kill Wimun-son. Kill all Wimun-son.

6
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,040
The lady killer, we mean that literally.

7
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:51,040
I have a lot of different names, okay, but fine, on the Patreon, I guess it's Kill All Wimun-son.

8
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,880
I guess that's my name, fine, I accept it.

9
00:00:54,720 --> 00:01:01,840
Much darker over here, much more purgy. And then the other guy is what again?

10
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,080
Jack-o-lantern slime-it-in.

11
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,240
I like that I don't remember, I can hear them all new.

12
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,840
Yeah, listen, this one, I feel like always the explanation right at the top,

13
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,840
because you might be looking at the name and not knowing what it is, unless you heard our episode

14
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:26,400
about the Tower of Terror. This is an episode about a ride that was never built, that was never

15
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,040
complete, never made it past the conceptual stage, although it made it further than anybody might

16
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:37,280
think. Actually, not a ride so much as a show, this was meant for Disney MGM studios in the 90s.

17
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:44,640
Is this our first episode about a thing that was not built at all? Have we actually done?

18
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:52,320
I think that's correct. Every now and then it comes up, like, hey, we should do unbuilt Star Wars,

19
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,840
unbuilt, I mean, there's so much great unbuilt stuff, and there's a lot of people who've made

20
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:03,440
great videos about unbuilt stuff. But yeah, it's a very rich vein to mine. But this one is a rare

21
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:08,960
one where it's like, until you told me about it, Scott, I knew nothing about this. And there's so

22
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:14,960
little of it out there. I feel like it is ripe to talk about.

23
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:22,160
Yeah, it really makes me think of like, what is out there that we don't know? Because we frequent

24
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:27,040
these blogs and these podcasts. And still, when we brought up the Creature's Choice Awards, I was

25
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,760
like, I've never heard that before. So there's got to be so much more out there that's not even been

26
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,720
written about that exists in a file cabinet or as a sketch somewhere.

27
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:43,120
Yeah, which is like, you know, we listen to the Disney dish, to Jim Hill and Lentist,

28
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:50,800
and sometimes they will get access to some weird files bought at a state sale or something.

29
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,240
Something was being transported somewhere and it fell out of a car on the side of the road in

30
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:02,080
central Florida. Jim Hill picks it up and then we get to know what's in it. I don't know how at all.

31
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,320
He meets Deep Throat in a parking garage.

32
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,720
I have some information you might want to hear about a proposed Ben Nobbs and Broomsticks ride.

33
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,720
That's exactly, he says the secret word, that secret phrase, that's it exactly.

34
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,960
Jim Hill's college roommate, Sergeant Vindaman.

35
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,320
That's the one I don't get. Who's Vindaman?

36
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:30,880
Oh, he was testified against Trump at the impeachment things.

37
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:36,960
Boy, how do you keep all these names? There's like a thousand names at this point.

38
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:42,000
Anyone like, if you're majoring in the Trump era in grad school or something someday,

39
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,480
it's the hardest job ever.

40
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,520
Yeah, really. But good reference, Jason.

41
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,040
Sounded like a good reference. I didn't know it either.

42
00:03:51,120 --> 00:04:00,960
Yeah. So the reason that we know about this show, it's entirely due to this book by Kevin

43
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:06,560
Rafferty. And again, we set up some of this in the Tower of Terror episode. Kevin Rafferty is a great

44
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,880
Imagineer who I, again, all the stuff you don't know. Nobody signs their names to attractions

45
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:17,360
typically. We know that Tony Baxter is associated with these four great rides.

46
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:22,880
But Kevin Rafferty, it's probably why you write a book so that you can come out and say,

47
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:29,120
so I had my hands on this and this and this. Just to run through a bunch of them. He's very

48
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:36,400
associated with Cars Land, Midway Mania. There's stories in the book about the Rock and Roller

49
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:42,240
Coaster and hanging out with Steven Tyler. And Steven Tyler, like, did anyone read further in

50
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,480
the book? Now it's not coming to me. There's something about Steven Tyler talking to his son

51
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:52,720
about sex or something. No, I don't. Do you have to pause and break off?

52
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:59,360
That sounds pretty good. Well, I mean, we might be doing a chapter by chapter breakdown.

53
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:08,240
The chapters are even half as good as this one section about like, we have to expand MGM studios.

54
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:15,520
The projects Rafferty was working on simultaneously. The potential contemporaries for Tower of Terror,

55
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:22,960
what didn't get built are so fascinating. I really think this full lineup of attractions

56
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:28,560
would be jaw dropping to have. I think we got the right one. The right one made it out,

57
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,680
which is the Tower of Terror. But I mean, I think I have some of this list in front of me,

58
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,560
which these are a lot of which we should do episodes about. But this thing we're talking

59
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,440
about, this animatronic award show, the Creatures Choice Awards, he was working on at the same time

60
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:49,520
as Tower of Terror. Dick Tracy Crime Stoppers may be the most prime for an episode. We should

61
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:55,840
probably do that one soon. I only skimmed the chapter about that, but there's like a discussion

62
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:05,200
with Eisner about guns that seems really crazy. And they also got like a 1930 sedan and were like,

63
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:11,120
let's drive this around the parking lot and see what skidding to a stop feels like. Like they were

64
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:18,960
trying to like get ideas for the ride vehicle. Cool. Yeah. All these, I mean, I think it's all

65
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:24,720
part of the same chapter or like several chapters. All the stuff that we talked about with Tower of

66
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,800
Terror, he gets to do that. He gets to ride around an old thirties car and he gets to go to the

67
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:34,160
elevator factory and test an elevator as fast as it can go and go try out a drop ride to see, well,

68
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:41,200
how will it work if we do it? I like the fun. And for this, he like went to Fangoria and hung out

69
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:45,680
with horror fans and went and talked to some of the people who there would have been animatronics

70
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:51,520
of. There's a story in this book about him hanging out with the Rolling Stones in first class on a

71
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:59,360
plane. Did anyone get to that? No, no, no. What is that about? Again, maybe we'll save some of this

72
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:06,720
and bring it up if we talk about Crime Stoppers. But he, this Imagineer is going to New York for a

73
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:14,080
presentation. There's something Imagineering centric that he has to do. And they put him up first class

74
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:21,280
and then he has all of the cabin to himself. He's like, wow, I'm the only guy here. Amazing. And then

75
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,840
people start coming in and it's a big entourage. And he's like, ah, bummer. And then he starts

76
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:32,560
going, wait, is that Charlie Watts? Is that Ron Wood? Is that Keith Richards? And it's all of them.

77
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,960
And then he does a whole flight where the Rolling Stones are like talking to him and like, wait,

78
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:43,760
see you build the Disney rides, do you? He like parties with the Stones, who he claims invite them

79
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:51,280
to hang out with him in New York. And he's like, sorry, I have work to do. The company beckons. And

80
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:56,960
he didn't hang out with the Rolling Stones. That's so crazy. I'm not even sure I totally,

81
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,200
but he seems like a good guy. Why not? I'm just jealous, I guess.

82
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:07,440
That's yeah. Why would you turn that? How? Well, I was hoping it was like he was trying to court

83
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,600
them to be the rock and roller coaster, to be on the rock and roller coaster.

84
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:18,400
Oh yeah. I wish. Yeah. I'll hit pause on whatever that Steven Tyler story is. I swear there's

85
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:26,000
something about Steven Tyler like having the talk with his son or something. Just get this book if

86
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:33,040
you're interested in this stuff as we are. Old rockers. You're interested in old rockers.

87
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:39,680
Well, these are the most famous ones. We're not exactly, you know, to bring up sticks again.

88
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:47,280
He's not talking about hanging out with J.Y. I could see how you'd be bored by a J.Y. story.

89
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:54,240
But anyway, like what are the other ones? He's, there was the Baby Herman's Runaway Baby Buggy's

90
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:01,360
proposed Roger Rabbit attraction. This guy thought of the attraction Toontown Transit,

91
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:08,240
which there's concept art of somewhere online that would have been a Star Tours, but you're on

92
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:16,800
like a trolley car that goes into, like goes on a crazy path through Toontown, like an animated

93
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:21,280
Roger Rabbit Star Tours, which sounds amazing. And the rumor is that they're sort of reusing

94
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:28,400
that idea for the Zootopia ride. Oh, yes. Oh, neat. So yeah. So everything gets reused eventually.

95
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:33,840
Oh, because that way they come into the city is so cool in that movie. So that kind of deal.

96
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:40,000
That's the idea. Yep. The cartoon studio stuff, which were like the three attractions he was

97
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:46,160
developing simultaneously is this and Tower of Terror. It's really interesting, you know,

98
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:52,000
for a few reasons, because at the same time, Universal was planning on doing a whole park

99
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,840
called Universal's Cartoon World, another fascinating, unbuilt thing. But then also,

100
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:02,000
like Roger Rabbit was this huge hit. So they're like, oh yeah, full steam ahead. We got to get

101
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:10,560
this in the park and we got the ride at Disneyland and we got some presence of Roger Rabbit in Florida,

102
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:15,200
but no big e-ticket attractions in Florida. And it's so crazy of like,

103
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:20,800
if they had they feels like they did the same thing with the Marvel Cinematic Universe,

104
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:25,040
but if they said we got to get something in there and nothing came of it, that would just be so

105
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:30,800
bizarre nowadays. Like, how did you how did you fumble that ball? You know, right, right. Yeah,

106
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:36,400
they've gotten like just enough Marvel in there to show they mean business and that they and that

107
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:41,520
there's a big hit attraction that people like. I don't know how people feel about any of those

108
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:50,800
Iron Man or Ant-Man or any of those things that are in the overseas parks. But yeah, it is weird.

109
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:55,520
And like, do you think maybe Roger Rabbit's cultural stock would be higher if there were

110
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:02,080
more attractions? Is it like in the same way that like the avatars kept alive a little in people's

111
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:07,920
minds by the theme park stuff? I think maybe more attractions and if there had been a sequel.

112
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:15,440
Yeah, yeah, certainly that. Well, they had like, you know, they had Jessica Rabbit at Pleasure

113
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,080
Island. I feel like they obviously we've talked about it seems like they've tried to back off

114
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:26,960
Jessica Rabbit, you know, pushing her out there. And I think probably the like situation with like

115
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:31,680
Robert Zemeckis, they've kind of pushed back is at a certain point. Remember, Roger was like fifth

116
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,960
as far as like the characters, wasn't he like fifth or sixth as far as like the top characters?

117
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,160
Yeah, there was a time. Yeah. And Jessica Rabbit was up there for merchandise sales.

118
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:48,880
Yeah. Very high. And so, yeah, I don't know. I don't know exactly when that switched because

119
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:54,720
he was beating Chip and Dale for sure. But I feel like Chip and Dale now are ahead of him.

120
00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:00,480
He was there with them, I feel like. And maybe I'm going off of that sing along songs primarily.

121
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:05,200
You don't think you think Roger Rabbit was just on Chip and Dale level when he was in his

122
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:13,040
couple of years there? I get maybe maybe. Well, maybe they split the vote. So Roger independently

123
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,840
has more appeal than the two of them that they have to share.

124
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:23,840
OK, I could believe that. I feel like Roger was winning. But the Rescuers had been out. So they

125
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:30,320
had some popularity, but it wasn't as big as Roger Rabbit. Yeah. I mean, I yeah, there

126
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:36,880
was a huge Roger era. I don't know. Yeah. What did it would never happen now? They would never

127
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:42,240
not make a sequel. They'd figure something out. Yeah. And I mean, they always like tease the idea.

128
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,840
But now it's like impossible if they wanted to get like Looney Tunes and stuff in there.

129
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:52,080
Like that's seemingly impossible. Well, then I guess a new Roger Rabbit would have to be like,

130
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:59,760
you know, it's Mickey hanging out with the Paw Patrol and some like YouTube cartoon and and Beowulf.

131
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:08,800
And a motion capture. Beowulf. Beowulf got to be in it. Beowulf is in Marwen. Too realistic. Angelina

132
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:16,560
Jolie has to emerge from the water and hang out with Dumbo. Roger goes to Marwen. The Witches with

133
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:26,480
the mouth scars. Yeah, all of it. They're all there. Man, it's mainly like the Beowulf characters

134
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:33,040
dominate almost as much as the Looney Tunes. They kind of replace the Looney Tunes,

135
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:39,920
which is what Zemeckis thinks has happened culturally. Yes. Mickey should make a wrong

136
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:46,240
turn and end up in an alley with the algorithm generated like body swap things that was scaring

137
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,720
everyone a couple of years ago, where it would be like the top half of Spider-Man ends up on the

138
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:55,200
bottom half of the Hulk. And everyone's like, what is this? And there's just like

139
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,760
factories shirting out this stuff in around the world.

140
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,560
They used to hang out with a bunch of like with a bunch of realistic homers,

141
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:13,520
like all those CGI. What if Homer was in real life? They own the really seedy part of Toontown.

142
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:20,160
And they own the Simpsons. So that would be very possible. Yeah. Zemeckis is doing to Pinocchio.

143
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:29,920
Oh, no. For Disney, for Disney. In that way. So I mean, how else are you going to do it? How

144
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:36,800
else is Robertson magazine the year 20, whatever 21 to Pinocchio if it's not Beowulf style?

145
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:43,120
OK, look, while I wouldn't go so far as to say Pinocchio is canceled, as I feel about Pan,

146
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:49,600
where I feel like it is like important for us to progress as a society by having no more Peter Pan,

147
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:55,840
we have to grow up and Pan is done. But Pinocchio I feel similar about just in like,

148
00:14:55,840 --> 00:15:01,360
I would say how about more Pinocchios, except that every live action Pinocchio has been the most

149
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:08,320
upsetting thing you've ever seen. Like that that Benigni one and the weird, the Drew Carey and

150
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:16,000
am I forgetting some Pinocchios? I don't know. There's an 80s cartoon called like the Sorcerer

151
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:22,880
of Light, where there's a scary Christopher Lloyd in it and Ricky Lee Jones sings to Pinocchio.

152
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:28,960
Like these are some of the scariest films ever made. Yeah. You ain't seen nothing yet. You get

153
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:35,280
ready. Well, and and look, this one's going to have I believe Tom Hanks doing a Geppetto voice.

154
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:44,720
I hope he sings the song. I have to sing the song. Yeah, for sure. Oh, wait. Oh, this is like the

155
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:55,520
worst of all worlds. It's Zemeckis Mocap and the unimaginative live action like CGI hybrids. Oh,

156
00:15:55,520 --> 00:16:00,880
God, this sounds terrible. Mm hmm. Yeah. August 20th, Tom Hanks and talks to play Geppetto and

157
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:08,320
Disney's Pinocchio. That is confirmed. So yeah, prepare for that. They're going to have to do

158
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:16,560
some cleaning up, I think of the of Pleasure Island for sure. But it's going to be it's going

159
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:22,880
to be something I think. I don't know. They have to be bad there to be punished. We have to see

160
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:31,040
if you smoke a cigar, then you have to have like a body transmorphic horrifying situation

161
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:37,840
happen to you. You have to like go through hell. I hope they vape though. That's what I hope. Yeah,

162
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:43,760
they vape. I mean, it helps that Tom Hanks has already been killed and replaced with a clone.

163
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:49,360
As we all know, like all the celebrities, they're all clones, you know, that one of the is that a

164
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:54,400
cute? Yeah, that's a cute. Yeah, that's a cute thing. Cute drop. That was one of my favorite

165
00:16:54,400 --> 00:17:00,720
recent theme park blog things in quarantine was the blog who was like, people are saying that

166
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:07,760
they should re theme that Pinocchio ride. And it was just two commentators, like two comments on

167
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:15,520
their own blog, saying like they should read this is nightmarish. This ride is scary. Pinocchio is

168
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:20,240
daring jerk. Yeah, it's a little scary. And then buried deep in the story, there was an embedded

169
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:26,000
tweet where someone's like, well, there is a weird Asian stereotype in a birdcage. And I was like,

170
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,520
oh, yeah, that's weird. Get rid of that. Also, learn how to write an article. That should be

171
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:37,280
the very first thing, not your two dipshit commenters that are just posting save the children

172
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:44,640
horse shit. There. Yeah, I there's this. I mean, we've noticed it a lot, but there's one in

173
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,720
particular. I don't even know. I don't want to like get into a fight with them. But boy, because we

174
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:54,800
follow a lot of these theme park Twitter. The idea was we're in this Trump era where Twitter is a

175
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:58,960
nightmare. So what if we only follow on podcast? The ride? All we're going to do is follow fun

176
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:04,960
theme park Twitter's and now they're getting all right wingy and QE like it's a bit bad there.

177
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:10,000
Some of these Twitter's are just awful. You know, it does. It makes a lot of sense to me because

178
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:18,240
look, we know Disney fans very imaginative. They like to think of fun things. You know, they spin

179
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,640
out. They think of different fun scenario fantasies. And I think there's a probably a nice overlap

180
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:30,320
with your Q audience. Well, in the way that, you know, Walt was Walt was just weaving tails left

181
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:37,760
and right in all mediums until he left this mortal coil. Q really is the modern day Walt.

182
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:44,800
Sharing so many wonderful stories with us, just adding to the culture, turn it like making people's

183
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:50,080
hearts come alive. Right. I mean, I'm thinking of other adventures of what Peter Pan might have.

184
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,800
And I'm also thinking of what adventures Donald Trump is having as he combats

185
00:18:54,800 --> 00:19:00,000
pedophiles because I know he's doing it because that's makes so much sense to me.

186
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:06,880
Trump goes to a magical realm that we can't see. He has to wish and go to a star where he has

187
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:14,160
sword fights with pedophiles. Right. It's all in space. Uh huh. And yeah, Tinkerbell puts the dust

188
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:20,320
on Trump and he flies and he, he fights with pedophile pirates on a pirate ship.

189
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,480
And he always defeats them because he's very strong, very tough man.

190
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:30,000
And they thought they had him until he took all the, the Regeneron and now he,

191
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,440
Oh yeah. He doesn't see him like barreling through space. Oh no.

192
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:42,080
If you shoot Tinkerbell up with Regeneron, her pixie dust gets supercharged. The dust she generates

193
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:48,640
is super dust. She can, and she can fly at four times light speed now. Right. Yeah.

194
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:56,480
She helps him get revenge on, uh, like Kathy Ireland, Nellie Orr, uh,

195
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,600
Graydon Carter, all of the, the bad guy pirates.

196
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:09,040
Well, he'll show us he's in, in term two, he'll like take a camera to the magical place where he

197
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:13,920
does all the things that he says. He'll show us that it's real. We just don't believe enough.

198
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,880
And it's not just him working about 15 minutes a day and going back to his room and eating a

199
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:24,640
bunch of Big Macs. That's not the most, the majority of his day is eating two Big Macs,

200
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:31,280
two Flay of fishes and a chocolate milkshake. And calling TV hosts who want him to go like,

201
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:35,840
well, I'm sure you got a lot more to do, sir. No, that's fine. I'm good. I could stay here all day.

202
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:41,840
All right. But my show is literally ending. No, no, no. Keep it rolling. Yeah. I got two more hours.

203
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,880
The Lincoln bedroom is now just one of those sad bachelor apartments where it's like,

204
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,400
oh, the massive TV is being propped up by the box. It came in.

205
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:02,160
He's making a point of seeing how much trash can pile up like you do in a dorm. Like my parents

206
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:06,240
are around. Nobody. I don't have to clean. I'm the president. I have to clean up after myself.

207
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,720
All the cans I drank are on the wall.

208
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,520
The cans of the cans of Regeneron.

209
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,640
Yeah. He's definitely trashing that place if he loses. Yeah.

210
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,720
Yeah. He's yeah. Like a hotel room. Yeah. He's going to tear all the wallpaper down.

211
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,800
They're very unfair to me. These new diet Coke cans are so hard to stack.

212
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:38,720
Skinny diet, sloppy, skinny diet Coke cans. Cans. They ate our country. All right.

213
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:47,760
This is an episode about the creatures. An attraction that wasn't built about which

214
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:55,840
there's four pages about it in this one book. Okay. So some of this we all right,

215
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:01,760
we got into it a little. It's tied into the Tower of Terror story. The way he presents it in the

216
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,960
book is that he was working on both these things at the same time and only probably only one of

217
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,800
them was going to be able to go. And maybe there was thought that the Tower of Terror would be the

218
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:12,880
one that wouldn't work out because they were trying all this new technology. It was extremely

219
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,720
expensive. Both of these attractions would have been very, very expensive. Tower of Terror,

220
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,560
because they're inventing all this new stuff. How do you make an elevator, ball, fest and light speed?

221
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:27,200
This show would have just been a ton of animatronics and we know that's very expensive.

222
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:33,680
So he's pushing them alongside each other at the same time. And it's all part of the same cycle of

223
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:41,440
pitching, apparently. They want to do something edgier, spookier, and that expands MGM studios.

224
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:49,760
So we end up with this thing. Yeah. And in the book, the quote is the Creature's Choice word,

225
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:57,920
quote, a large scale theatrical presentation on the same scale and complexity of the American

226
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:06,960
Adventure. Crazy. Can you imagine? I cannot imagine the price tag. I mean, the American Adventure,

227
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:12,800
I think, benefits from the fact it was in a brand new park. They were committing a lot of money and

228
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:19,600
still a lot of bicentennial shine, a lot of bicentennial spirit in the air. Right. But it

229
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:28,320
American Adventure has got so many robots. There's so much going on. How long is that show? Is it

230
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:34,480
30 minutes? It's something like that. It's up there. We said on the episode, but it feels

231
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:41,840
like it's been a decade. They timed this out that this show would have been 17 minutes. So not quite

232
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:45,840
as long. But yeah, when you think about the mechanics of the American Adventure where we

233
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:50,400
discovered all that stuff, that all these massive pieces have to slide in and out from under you,

234
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:55,920
essentially, and just to have room for all those animatronics to come up. I guess that would have

235
00:23:55,920 --> 00:24:04,800
been the deal with this, but it's all monsters doing an award show for each other. And it does

236
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:10,000
make it, I don't know, maybe this is controversial. I feel like it makes it better that it was going

237
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,360
to be mostly robots. I mean, I don't think that's controversial on this podcast. No, nothing against

238
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:22,480
performers, but there is something extra funny about a long show with just robots. And it's 30

239
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:27,200
minutes is how long the American Adventure is about. Wow. A little under. Yeah. Something where

240
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:32,080
you just press play and then robots do their thing. It's the Chuck E. Cheese Band. It's not a mystery

241
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:40,480
why we like that. Chuck E. Cheese Band. There's a moment I can feel in Country Bear Jamboree where

242
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:46,800
I don't know when it is, but there's some point where one of the side acts finishes their song,

243
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:50,800
and then the lights go down and it turns around, and then there's a feeling like, and now these

244
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:56,880
people, and you're like, how many are there? How many can they pack into this relatively small

245
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:01,120
space? And how many more are there going to be by the end of it? And if this was going to be one of

246
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:06,560
those where you think they've shown all their cards eight minutes in, and then the animatronics

247
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:15,120
keep coming from every spot in the theater, this would have been a blast. Yeah. I won't spoil the

248
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:23,680
finale, but the finale is great. 17 minutes, look, I would have preferred 30 for this if they had done

249
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:28,720
it. I'll be honest with you. But maybe they were trying to go, some people could say, oh, American

250
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:35,120
Adventure, it's a little slow. Okay. I don't agree with that, but I guess a person who was seeing it

251
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:41,200
maybe who doesn't love the bicentennial like me would say that. I think the bicentennial would be,

252
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:46,400
well, it gets slow for me when there are no more robots, when you get into the song. Now I'm just

253
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:52,240
watching a movie, you're telling me no more robots are going to show up except on a Statue of Liberty,

254
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:59,280
which that does top it, the Statue of Liberty handshake is amazing, obviously. But this thing,

255
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:05,840
if it truly was animatronics front to back all the time, do you want to start saying some of the

256
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:13,040
stuff? We could do it in the order of how he pitched it, which it's interesting in the books

257
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:18,400
just to hear how this stuff is pitched and how fleshed out it all has to be. But I think really

258
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,960
where I fell in love with this and was like, we have to do an episode is when you hear the start

259
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:29,520
of his pitch, which this is straight to Eisner and Wells. I'm not even sure if it was vetted by

260
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:33,760
internal imaginary people or if the process was just get it, we get something ready and then take

261
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:43,760
it up to them. So he's pitching to Eisner and it starts off like this. This show is the equivalent

262
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:49,040
of the Academy Awards, but for movie monsters, including tonight's lifetime achievement award

263
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:55,920
honoree, the biggest star in the genre, Godzilla. So that's the peak of this, I guess. Monsters are

264
00:26:55,920 --> 00:27:00,880
honoring each other and Godzilla is the ultimate. And at that point, Michael Eisner burst out

265
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:10,320
laughing and exclaimed, home run. It's so funny because in the context of when he talks about

266
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:17,440
pitching to Eisner and Wells, it feels so good cop, bad copy. Cause when he talks about pitching,

267
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:22,240
they were pitching Tower of Terror and like, Hey, how about Vincent Price?

268
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:27,600
And Eisner is just like, I don't know. Vincent Price had his day, but like, is he really relevant

269
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:33,920
nowadays? And then when he talks about pitching Tower of Terror, but with the Twilight Zone,

270
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:38,400
Eisner is hemming and hawing and he goes, is Twilight Zone still relevant? And Frank Wells is

271
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:43,360
like, are you kidding me? They still do Twilight Zone marathon. It's just like it's evergreen.

272
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:48,400
It's universal. And Eisner goes, all right, I'll take it home run. And he does the same thing with

273
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:55,600
Godzilla. It's so funny. The things that make him just like giddy. Yeah. It feels like, I mean,

274
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,960
we've said this a million times, but it feels like if you were to pitch like an idea to Bob Iger,

275
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:04,000
he'd go, Oh, interesting. Okay. And then he'd like, or like run it through a computer algorithm to

276
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:09,440
make sure it made sense. But he never goes like, ah, home run. He never like, like he just saw a

277
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:15,280
exciting baseball game. He doesn't probably react like that. It doesn't feel like it. I just,

278
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:20,320
I think it's all right. We like this idea enough to do an episode about it, but I am a little

279
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:27,040
confused by why you would hear the ultimate monster, Godzilla, and then go, ha ha ha.

280
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:35,040
Yes. I guess if he thought like, oh, we're going to see Godzilla, that's cool. I don't know.

281
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:39,760
I don't know what his thinking is. I haven't spoken with him yet about it,

282
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:45,120
which we hopefully will get to one day. And I say that as if we are about to do it. We're not,

283
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:51,360
there's no communication. No, no, but, but yeah, if it was like, he thinks like, oh,

284
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:55,840
Godzilla will be there and accept an award. I do think you go home run. Let's see Godzilla.

285
00:28:55,840 --> 00:29:02,000
They just opened up this Godzilla in Japan, this big zip lining attraction. Have you seen this?

286
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:06,320
Oh, I was reading about this last night. Yeah. Yeah. And it's like, it's a giant Godzilla had

287
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:13,200
new zip line into his mouth. And I'm like, that's fantastic. Cool. So, yeah, I don't know if

288
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,840
Iser was sort of imagining that, or he was just like, ha, Godzilla in an award show. I've heard

289
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:25,360
everything now. Well, that's, yeah, I think like Godzilla is cool. Of course. But did he just like

290
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:30,640
this? Cause it's about awards and do you like this in the lame superstar limo way? That's my question.

291
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:35,760
I see what you're saying. He was like, we're going to send up the award shows. We're going to send

292
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:40,160
up Hollywood. He loves, yeah. Maybe, maybe you're right about that. Maybe he wasn't thinking like,

293
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:46,400
oh, we can make a cool Godzilla that will appear. Yeah. He just thinks he can make jokes about price

294
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:54,560
water house and, um, uh, the, you know, the playing them off music, which all of that would be

295
00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:01,200
very dated. They feel we're still there today and irrelevant as the future of award shows is in

296
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:06,320
question for a little while. I mean, it would have been nice if you could have updated it. So like

297
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:11,680
when there was the award, when Warren Beatty and what's her name got it wrong, you could add that

298
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:15,440
into the show, but I'm sure that wouldn't have been the way they would have made it in the early

299
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:23,440
nineties. When Warren booty, uh, and Faye Dunaway would be Faye.

300
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:30,560
Frey-d, Frey-d Dunaway. Frey-d. A Frey-d Dunaway.

301
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,440
A dead-o-dead-a-way. I don't know. Oh yeah. There's better ones for sure.

302
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:45,440
Sure. But of course we know, like, obviously you update this and that's,

303
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:50,320
that's fantastic. You reference where, you know, now you put in a joke about Steve Harvey getting

304
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:58,080
the name wrong or whatever, but we, we all know that this would have been opened in 1994 and never

305
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:04,720
changed in any way. It absolutely would have been one of those like food rocks until it went away.

306
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:10,880
Carousel of Progress, the redo, which Kevin Rafferty worked on and that certainly has not

307
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:15,600
changed in one bit, not even to dub in somebody saying the century that we're in.

308
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:21,760
Well, I think the one change is that the TV did turn widescreen. Yeah, it's a flat screen.

309
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:28,400
That is the change I think that they've made over the years. And they lucked out because VR did come

310
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:33,440
back around to being popular. Right. So now it's perfect again. So it actually does kind of where,

311
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:39,600
oh, and 90s like clothing is vintage and you find it online, like vintage shops a lot. So

312
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:45,200
they're all on trend inadvertently in a few ways. And you play, you know, you buy your little

313
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:53,680
recreation of the Super Nintendo. Like grandma is playing a retro 90s game on her VR. Yes. Great.

314
00:31:54,400 --> 00:32:02,160
On, on yeah, her Oculus slash Steam thing. Siri is a pain in the ass sometimes, much like the oven

315
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:09,200
is a pain in the ass. You know, the voice controlled oven. Did the family make it through

316
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:14,400
COVID? When, when is the future in that thing? Oh, that's a good question. I don't know. They

317
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:19,120
don't like to say the year. I don't think, or maybe they do say the year. I forget. I don't think so

318
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:24,800
though. Is that, you know how you only hear the one guy's voice like no privacy. Is that because

319
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:30,400
he's quarantining in the other room in the bathtub? Yeah. Yeah. He's been in the bathtub for two weeks.

320
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:37,840
Well, they make him. Because you know, uncle Warville is sharing some very poorly sized

321
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:46,800
memes about here's why masks don't work. They restrict, they restrict my airflow. Creeping

322
00:32:46,800 --> 00:33:02,160
Sharia law. Mask mandates hinder my freedom. Oh Warville. I coughed on a lady at Starbucks

323
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:09,280
and I'm proud I did. I'll say this. The creature's choice awards, I think they hit the nail on the

324
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:15,680
head. Like Godzilla still going there. They never stopped making Godzilla movies. And, and, but this,

325
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:21,200
this was like a media period where like everything was a lot less fractured. There's a, you know,

326
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:26,400
there's no streaming stuff. There's no Twitch. There's barely an internet. So like you can assume

327
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:32,240
like everyone saw this thing and is talking about it around the water cooler. So like, yeah, everyone

328
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:37,840
knows the Twilight Zone. Everyone knows Godzilla. But I'm not sure how they would have done the other

329
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:44,080
nominees because they were talking about bringing in some IP here and there. But like an example of

330
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:50,720
one of the things in it is there's the category best aliens from outer space. And in that it goes

331
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:57,520
to aliens from Mars and Mars, Martians laser blasts their way into the theater and land on the stage

332
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:04,320
in a flying saucer. That all sounds very cool. But like, what are they from? What Martians? Generic

333
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:10,080
grays, you know, just like generic heads Martian, but like, would it just been a bit been a bunch of

334
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:19,840
those? Yeah, I mean, Mars attacks is what? Two years later, I think. Yeah. 95. So it's not that.

335
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:26,160
But yeah, I guess, I guess just generic aliens. They were, I mean, they were doing obviously like

336
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:31,120
great movie ride. There were a lot of different properties that would sign on to those things.

337
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:35,840
So perhaps, perhaps that's a thing later for an Eisner to work out to call over and get,

338
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:41,680
you know, get ET, get the rights to ET. I don't know if that's going to work.

339
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:48,400
That is a problem that Universal has all the monsters. They had the monsters in their own park

340
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:52,640
and they have, I mean, I think a lot of those monsters are technically in the public domain,

341
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:59,200
but the look of the movie versions, I believe Universal has the copyright to bend in, you know,

342
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:04,480
let's say they did try to do Godzilla, they would have had to reach out to the Toho company and go,

343
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:09,040
can we do this? Will you license this? It's so confusing with stuff in the public domain

344
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:15,440
because like Wizard of Oz is in the public domain, but who, I mean, I guess Disney now owns Wizard,

345
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:23,200
they own Wizard of Oz, the movie, the original or the second, the second movie. Or is it on HBO?

346
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:27,440
No, no, it's on HBO Max, right? I can literally not remember who owns what at this point.

347
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:34,800
Yes, I think so. Sony took over the old MGM lot, but Warner Brothers bought the MGM catalog.

348
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:44,240
So AT&T owns the ruby slippers and other parts of the movie. So you can't use certain parts of

349
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:49,280
the movie, but we could start production on a new Wizard of Oz tomorrow with Jason as the Wizard of

350
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:53,600
Oz if we wanted. And Mike is Jack Pumpkinhead or whatever. And me is Jack Pumpkinhead. The one

351
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:59,120
that shows up in the other books. Yes, who's in return to Oz, which we still have to do a Patreon

352
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:06,240
about. When you can do like, you know, Dorothy chronicles like three seasons of her life on the

353
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:13,920
farm before she has the dream, which I'm sure one of these streamers will do at some point, just like,

354
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:21,520
like dull event free season after season. We're like, but I think in the next one, maybe there's

355
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:26,160
going to be a little Oz in it and it never happens. It's like nine, like nine episodes in.

356
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:31,600
It's like, well, we just got a scarecrow has to come and meter, I think, because people are losing

357
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:35,760
interest. It's like that show Gotham, which I watched a little of where it was like, it's about

358
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:41,520
little Bruce Wayne and the police department in Gotham cut to the next season. Every villain is

359
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:46,720
in it. Every Batman villain. It's like, just throw more villains at this. People just want the

360
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:51,760
villains. They don't want to be the police department. I'm looking up like, okay, so we know

361
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:57,600
that they had the deal with MGM at the time. So what would that have gotten them access to? And I,

362
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:02,800
I'm just skimming, but I'm like, all right, so what did they own? There's some good, the MGM owned

363
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:10,880
Poltergeist. So they could have had some Poltergeist stuff. They well know Hannibal is later. I don't

364
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:14,720
think they own Silence of the Lambs and that probably wouldn't fit tonally if the Hannibal

365
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:21,680
Lecter showed up. They own the very depressing thirties movie Freaks. So all of the real freaks

366
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:27,040
could have shown up to get an award. Okay. That we, yeah, the audience, home run, I say.

367
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:34,000
That'd be like sad. Like when a very old person makes their last public appearance on the Oscars,

368
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:40,320
that'd be the moment where we all reflect and tear up. I don't, I don't know. At a theme park

369
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:45,200
attraction, you could have the freaks deliver the message. Isn't the message of the movie like,

370
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:53,440
you are the real freaks. You treat us like shit. A good message. I guess I'm assuming from what

371
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:57,920
I know about that. I've never watched it all the way through, but yeah, some of this stuff,

372
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:02,640
like the messages of some of this stuff, you, like Disney would have had to just take the surface

373
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:11,200
level monster, the monster you see at party city. Yes. Generic, not Frankenstein, but,

374
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:19,520
you know, Boltman. Well, you can do Frankenstein, but he couldn't have like the square head. He

375
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:25,120
couldn't have the bolts. He'd have to be like a patchwork sewn together man. Like, like you,

376
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:29,840
you see in the Frankenstein movies that try to be a little grittier or a little closer to the book,

377
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,160
which I remember reading at high school and going like, this sucks.

378
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:41,120
You just wanted like him to look like Herman Munster. Well, yeah, I wanted my friend, my, my,

379
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:47,120
it's my friend from TV. Yeah. It was definitely a Munster's kid. Yeah. They could have, so they

380
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:54,160
could have had a Wolfman, but not the Wolfman. Correct. And it's unclear what I would love to

381
00:38:54,240 --> 00:39:00,320
see the language in that, like what they own about Wolfman. So like what he can have and what he can't

382
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:04,400
have if we were to make our own Wolfman, if we were to make Jason Sheridan as the Wolfman,

383
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:09,280
what can he look like? Does he have to have like his fur has to be a certain length? Does it have

384
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:14,000
to be a certain color? Can you not have like ripped pants? Does he have to have like a Speedo?

385
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:18,480
Like does Jason Sheridan Wolfman have to wear like a Speedo or underwear as opposed to like

386
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:27,520
kind of ripped Hulk pants? I don't know. Yeah. I are like, maybe this Wolfman, the Creatures Choice

387
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:33,920
Awards Wolfman wears the, what were the baggy pants with the patterns that were big in the 90s?

388
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:41,200
Zubas? Zubas. Maybe he's like the, the, the slob who shows up to the, whenever a lot of award shows,

389
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:47,840
there's like one guy who's like, yeah, I'm a slob. Like he's the, the weirdo. Hey, here's an easy one.

390
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:53,440
The invisible man, just a voice. You don't see him. I like that. That would have, we all would have

391
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:57,360
gotten a kick out of that. And if they'd added some thing where like, you know, the award like goes

392
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:04,000
away on its own. Yeah. Perfect. That's fun for everyone. And there's like a, yeah, there's,

393
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:09,600
there's gotta be, yeah, just put it on a wire or whatever and take it away. Yeah. Yeah. We should

394
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:14,080
maybe set the scene a little. There's not a lot we know about where this is happening, but you do

395
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:21,360
apparently pass through a lobby where treats are available, like a movie theater and where you'd

396
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:30,880
have things like buttered fingers. That is the example given. That's neat. And then you sit down

397
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:38,480
and get ready for the award show. And then there's an opening performance by a doo-wop group of

398
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:41,840
mummies and they are called the sarcophagi guys.

399
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:50,080
See, this is pretty good, but there's another thing that like runs me the wrong way of like,

400
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:55,840
okay, wait, you're concerned about Vincent Price not being current enough, but you're like,

401
00:40:55,840 --> 00:41:02,400
but you know what's timeless doo-wop music that that hits the eight to 80. Like there is a string

402
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:06,560
of like nine eighties, nineties theme park stuff. We're like, and then we'll fill that out with some

403
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:13,120
doo-wop. There's a lot of doo-wop around. Yeah. They wanted it to be great balls of fire,

404
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:18,960
but Universal was using it for their Beetlejuice show at the time. So they couldn't get the rights

405
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:29,200
to a Hipper song. Yeah. It had happened 20 years after doo-wop. He himself, Rafferty in his book

406
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:35,200
says he kind of cops to that maybe this wouldn't be the coolest thing to do. And that today,

407
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:39,040
if he were doing it, that the money, he would probably have the joke that the mummies would be

408
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:46,560
rap artists with a W. You see, I'm sure that would be very good. I'm sure that would have lasted

409
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:53,760
longer too. Isn't that the same thing as food rocks and the rapper, the food rapper.

410
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:59,760
If it ain't broke, don't fix it, you know? And the plus up is so easy. You just take off the

411
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:05,760
tall vanilla ice hair and you just draw a bunch of face tattoos like Post Malone. Done and done.

412
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:18,160
Just when you get some cobwebs around and just make that the stringy hair of one of these current

413
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:25,440
weirdos. It is interesting. It is hard with all this stuff. What is a timeless type of,

414
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:29,920
what would you put, if you were doing it right now, truly, that you were like, well, this is

415
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:35,600
going to be okay in 20 years, what would you even have them sing? It's like the country. Lady,

416
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:44,880
Lady Goo, Lady Goo, Goo. Maybe to, well, Goo Goo is to baby. You think baby. So how about Lady,

417
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:53,600
no Goo Ga is the same situation. What am I saying? Lady Goo Ga, Lady Ga Goo. That fixes it, doesn't it?

418
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:58,080
Yeah. Lady of the Lake Gaga? How about Frady? Frady. Frady. Frady. Frady. Frady. Frady.

419
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:01,760
Okay. Frady. I just want to put a Frade in all of these people's names.

420
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:09,760
Frade makes me laugh. Who's timeless enough? You know, well, like John Legend has been popular for,

421
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:15,360
it feels like 30 years now. Sure. Yeah. It's very acceptable on every award show.

422
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:24,720
So John Legend, but I also can't like name a lot of John Legend's songs. He's just always around.

423
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:38,000
And how do you scarify his name? John. Legend of the Lake. John Curse? No, that's the word

424
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:43,440
place too hard. John. Now John. John Legend of the abandoned mine.

425
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:50,640
I'll take that. That's good. Yeah. Works for me. We'll circle back around. But let's, I mean,

426
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:55,920
they did have a big star. Again, another one where like, oh, your instinct is right. He is a guy who

427
00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:03,920
stuck around in confidence. Scott, do you have who they did meet with and discuss about being the

428
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:09,920
like the centerpiece of this endeavor? Yeah. Well, I think we said this on the main feed,

429
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:15,440
if I'm not mistaken, not to build it up too much, but boy, I mean, this is why we're doing it. And

430
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:19,680
hopefully we should use it as the art in the episode because this is really what you got to

431
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:26,000
talk about. Oh yeah. He had that the show would be hosted by like kind of a Frankenstein and it was

432
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:31,760
at some point amended to where the host of the show would be a very specific creature named Eddie

433
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:40,160
Franken Murphy. I just smile when I say it. Eddie Franken Murphy. And why? Why would Eddie

434
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:46,240
Franken Murphy be doing this? Well, it came about because Disney was trying to work out deals

435
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:51,600
with movie stars, get them over to Disney, do a bunch of stuff. And Eddie Murphy was being courted

436
00:44:51,600 --> 00:45:01,200
at that time by none other than Jeffrey Katzenberg, Mr. Quick Bite himself. So because of yet another

437
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:07,600
thing, a great thing in our world, we can thank Katzenberg for this great concept. This picture

438
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:12,720
that's making us smile only exists because of Jeffrey Katzenberg. Well, thank you, Jeffrey.

439
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:20,160
Let's always thank him. Thank him every day. Of Eddie Murphy with like, I mean, we later,

440
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:25,280
let me screen share the photo just so I mean, we've all been staring at it, I'm sure in

441
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:28,560
preparation for this, but let's just all look at him together.

442
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:40,240
Eddie's got the flat hair and he's got stitches in his forehead and bolts in his neck and he just

443
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:45,760
looks, he looks like he got dumber kind of in the course of whatever the procedure. Well, he's had

444
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:52,720
a lobotomy, obviously. Yeah. Yeah. So he's got the, yeah, he's got a scar on his forehead. They did

445
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:58,640
some brain activity in there. He got brain work. This poor sweet man, Eddie Frank and Murphy.

446
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:06,560
But he was into it. It seems like from the meeting he was into it. Well, that's the mind blow for me

447
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:12,400
is that they didn't just pitch this and what if that was what we did? They went and talked to him.

448
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:17,520
I think, I think so actively was Katzenberg pursuing Eddie around that time that he was

449
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:21,120
just like, I got to, all right, you're going to pitch it to him next week. So you had to turn

450
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:27,600
it around real fast, get this concept art out. And Eddie came to Disney, came to Imagineering

451
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:35,440
with two giant bodyguards and Kevin Ravarty had to give the presentation and say what he would be

452
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:44,880
doing. And as part of this, he ended up doing an imitation to Eddie, of Eddie, doing a James Brown

453
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:52,640
impression singing, I feel good as the show opener, which so here now, so you're going to

454
00:46:52,640 --> 00:47:02,800
have Eddie Frank and Murphy who just does the regular James Brown song. So that, yeah, that

455
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:11,840
seems, seems weird. Yeah. Also very bold to go in the pitch with like, well, this is how I'm starting.

456
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:16,000
This is what I'm opening with. I'm going to open doing an impression of you. Hmm.

457
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:23,440
Probably not a good idea. Maybe not. For a couple of reasons. Yes. Well, yes. This is a white

458
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:32,160
gentleman doing this, playing two black icons at once. I mean, he's deprecating. He does not seem

459
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:39,280
to believe that he did a good job. He in fact says that Eddie Murphy's bodyguards got up and left the

460
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:45,520
room because they were laughing so hard at me, not with me, I'm sure. They left the room.

461
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:51,040
They left. They left. They were peeing. They were assassinated. Right. The security guards are like

462
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:55,360
peeing in there. Their pants are soaked with urine. Like they had to, why did they leave the room?

463
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:03,040
I don't know about that claim. Hmm. That seems a bit dubious. Yeah. Hmm. Yeah. Full pants.

464
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:07,680
You're on there. You're on your own, Eddie. If this guy tries to kill you, we can't do anything.

465
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:14,240
We're peeing our pants at the moment. Sorry. Some stalker followed him in, like lurked around.

466
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:18,880
If one of the, if one of the imaginary robots, animatronics comes in here and strangles you to

467
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:26,640
death, you're on your own pal. We have to go clean ourselves up. If like, I mean like building the,

468
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:31,600
like the Bill Clinton for the hall of presidents around this time. If Bill Clinton becomes

469
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:37,760
possessed and comes in and tries to smack you around. Can't do anything about it.

470
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:46,080
Oh, we're laughing. I do have to give the editors at the Disney publishing some credit because I've

471
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:52,960
read a little of the Marty Sklar book and this book is also published by Disney Publish It and it's

472
00:48:53,600 --> 00:49:00,000
an imaginary telling of stories and they do a very good job of a consistent tone in these books

473
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,680
where it's like, well, it's a little peek behind the curtain and there's some mischievous

474
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:10,480
anecdotes, but they stop before the like, and then we killed the open bar that we just drain

475
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:16,240
that place. You know, we stayed up all night. All of that, all those rough edges are kind of

476
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:21,520
polished off. And I have to imagine these sort of pitch meetings, like, well, someone cursed,

477
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:26,560
someone was like, God damn it. What are we doing here? Like Bob Gert drinks too much and drives an

478
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:33,200
Autopia car into like a crowd in a crowded like street corner. Parody, parody, satire.

479
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:41,760
He crashes it through like a business somewhere, like a flower shop. Yeah. Cranks it up, huffs the

480
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:48,080
smoke, huffs the exhaust. Gert took an Autopia car on the 101.

481
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:55,760
But you just did that back then. It was fine. People used to jog on the 101, try to outrace

482
00:49:55,760 --> 00:50:02,400
the big cars. He grabbed a bunch of small world dolls and threw them in the passenger seat so he

483
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:14,320
could use the carpool lane. Those stories are like in a drawer somewhere in like legal at Disney.

484
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:21,520
Oh yeah. We'll get the truth. We'll get all that. I just like, boy, I would love to see every step

485
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:27,920
of this and that Katzenberg is there. I mean, this leads to Shrek ultimately. Like really,

486
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:35,200
this Jeffrey Eddy situation doesn't reach its zenith until Donkey. But this is planting the

487
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:42,800
seeds. Might not have happened without Eddie Franken Murphy. The thing is though, him hosting

488
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:49,760
is interesting because Eddie didn't like host a lot of stuff. And there was talk about him hosting

489
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:54,800
the Oscars at one point, which makes me think that if Eddie Franken Murphy was announced as the

490
00:50:54,800 --> 00:51:00,640
host of the Creatures Choice Awards, that probably what would happen is Brett Franken-Ratner, his

491
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:06,240
producer, would make some Franken homophobic comments, which would cancel the entire thing.

492
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:11,600
That's a good point. Yeah.

493
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:18,160
Brett Franken-Ratner is possessed by some other stuff.

494
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:21,520
They're both Frankensteins.

495
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:30,240
They would have built that robot and they would have made him sweat realistically.

496
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:36,320
You wouldn't have been able to see, he would be like off to the side,

497
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:40,720
off like you could see him in the wings sort of producing. It was sort of an Easter egg.

498
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:49,040
Yeah. He had a bag full of water balloons to throw at homeless people with Frank and Michael Jackson.

499
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:52,000
Michael Franken Jackson.

500
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,440
Michael Franken Jackson.

501
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:57,360
So in your mind, they're going all in on Frank stuff.

502
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:03,600
That might be a good plus of everyone's a Frankenstein in this show.

503
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:05,120
Everyone's a Frankenstein.

504
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:05,620
Yeah.

505
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:10,000
It's the Franken Oscars. Yeah. That's my God.

506
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,040
And if Al Franken presented, he'd be Al Franken-Frank.

507
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,640
This is why they pay you the big bucks.

508
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:29,680
The other name they talked about floating around, you know, Rafferty talks about like,

509
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:34,080
all right, I got to research some horror stuff. And he went to New York to go to like a Fangoria

510
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:39,600
convention, see what people were really into. And the name that comes up a couple of times is Elvira.

511
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:48,560
The horror show host. And not a name I would associate with Disney, but I mean, I guess

512
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:55,520
since it had to be on broadcast TV, jokes were kind of clean, but like, you know, a little bit

513
00:52:55,520 --> 00:53:00,160
of innuendo, certainly revealing outfit. The picture, the picture in there, and then the

514
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:05,680
description is all like when Elvira shows up and maybe you have the exact wording down, Scott.

515
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:11,280
The monsters hoot and holler at her. They cat call. It says cat call.

516
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:20,960
Cat calling. Yeah. Burton opens on Elvira. She's reclined on a velvet bourgeois settee.

517
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:25,760
Not sure that word. You know, a sexy couch is what they mean.

518
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:26,560
Sexy couch.

519
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:27,040
Yeah.

520
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:29,280
One of those real sexy French couches.

521
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:30,400
Day bet.

522
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:38,400
And she says, oh, stop. I swear you're all such monsters. Now bend an ear, my darlings,

523
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:41,440
the nominees for the for best alien invader are.

524
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:48,240
I mean, that's what this entire episode is going off of three photographs, basically,

525
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:54,560
one of which is Godzilla comped into Epcot Center, which is cool. That picture is rad.

526
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:58,320
I had never seen that before. I think it's one of the greatest pieces of concept art I've ever

527
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:06,000
seen. Absolutely worth the cost of the of the ebook. A load is that is Godzilla walking

528
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:10,480
towards spaceship Earth. I mean, it does not get better than that.

529
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:17,760
And these these Frank and Murphy photos are so great. Also that he the sample script that

530
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:23,360
they have for Eddie Frank and Murphy is. Oh, boy, the whole thing. I mean, I forgot the thing at

531
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:31,280
the top as he introduces Elvira agents. What are you going to do? That's again, this I think is why

532
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:38,160
Eisner liked it. I think Eisner likes that. Yeah. Yeah. Stick it to agents.

533
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:46,000
Something that the Florida crowd really is going to love. Even the slimy snake in the room doesn't

534
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:52,000
want to deal with the agents. Well, Rafferty talks about like, you know, this is this scene,

535
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:57,920
one of this part of this was, you know, the integration with Disney Studios and

536
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:04,640
that that was kind of working when like, oh, well, we can get Katzenberg to bring in Eddie Murphy

537
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:09,520
for movies and potentially theme park attraction. But Rafferty does like make sure to talk about,

538
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:13,280
like, well, they tried bringing in screenwriters or scriptwriters to like

539
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:21,040
write for rides and it just wasn't working like they couldn't get that, like, no, you have to do

540
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:26,640
this in physical space. You can't just do anything like in a movie with special effects.

541
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:30,400
But I think if the Creatures Choice Awards had gone forward, they would have needed to bring in

542
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:36,400
some ring, some Bruce Vellanche, you know, Merrill Marco, some ringers to write like,

543
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:43,760
nobody can do it. Nobody can do it like Bruce. Yeah. Get Bruce. Get Franken Bruce.

544
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:53,040
I mean, imagine if they fought that far and had a monster, maybe you do maybe a break from Franken

545
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:58,880
and he's like, what if you take the Vellanche hair and if you don't know who we're talking about,

546
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:03,120
Bruce Vellanche, this writer who's like wrote all of the pattern jokes on all the award shows in the

547
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:07,680
80s and 90s and the Star Wars Holiday Special that, you know, and he's like kind of a he's got like

548
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:14,320
big fuzzy orange hair. What if that was just all over him and he was like a monster? You just,

549
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:19,440
you take the hair and the beard and that's all the full body of the Vellanche.

550
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:26,080
It seems like he would look like, he would look like Sully from Monsters, Inc. but orange.

551
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:32,240
Yes. Yeah. That's great. That's really good. He'd be like, I feel like kids would want photos with

552
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:39,120
him. Like kids would come up and hug him. There'd be a huge line to meet Sully Vellanche.

553
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:44,320
Merch out the wazoo for Sully Vellanche. Are you kidding me? Like we would be on eBay right now

554
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:49,840
trying to get like, okay, I finally tracked down the kitchen cabaret tea towel that everyone wants

555
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:54,000
and I got a Sully Vellanche. They discontinued it, but I got the Sully Vellanche.

556
00:56:54,720 --> 00:57:00,960
Imagine like, and then he's like, maybe he's still got the glasses, but over the

557
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:07,600
fur and I don't know if he has eyes or doesn't or it's just, or he's like a cousin it just with

558
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:16,720
glasses over no eyeballs. You know, most of our, our art requests are for things of us or especially

559
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:24,160
Jason, but man, if anybody was bored and wanted to make a Bruce Vellanche monster,

560
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:28,640
who's like cute, who's like, yeah, who's cute. And we all like him.

561
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:34,560
This seems like, you know, I know it seems like we're going in a Franken based direction,

562
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:41,040
but I did write down some pitches for like awards presenters of like some 90s monster stars,

563
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:45,040
please, because there's so little way we're almost done with what we know about the show.

564
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:51,840
There's barely any info about the thing. Yeah. So I have a short list of stars of the 90s and

565
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:56,240
then stars of today. I think you could eventually work in. They might be a little too off the

566
00:57:56,240 --> 00:58:04,240
beaten path. I'm going to start kind of with the weirder ones. Campbell's skull. That's a

567
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:12,160
Campbell Scott. It's like, so it might be too, but how about a sitcom? How about a funny man? How

568
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:18,400
about Dabney Kilman? So it's like Dabney Coleman, but he's got like a butcher knife.

569
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:22,960
This would be an odd award show. Even the regular human versions.

570
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:27,760
Well, I'm not saying it's the same one. You know, you got to have a long list so you can whittle

571
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:35,680
it down. Reba Mackin trails. So Reba McIntyre, but she's like carrying her like she's like a

572
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:40,240
zombie. Got her guts spilling out. Reba McIntyre has her guts in her hands.

573
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:47,920
And then this last one, because she's been in the news a little lately, but was kind of at the height

574
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:54,800
of her fame in the 90s. Kirstie Alien. Cause she seems like she's from another freaking planet,

575
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:59,200
right? You read some of these tweets that diet plan. Jason, you got to believe in them. She

576
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:04,720
believes in Kirstie Aliens. Jason, I think you got a little blanch in you. Honestly.

577
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:10,880
I would love, I would love to take a crack at some award shows or some events writing.

578
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:17,040
Jason is getting Bruce. I would love it. That would be great. I would love to have Bruce's career.

579
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:21,680
But what about stars of today? You know, we need something. It's going to need a redo.

580
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:30,960
We can stay in the Disney family for some of these. Morgue trainer. That's a Megan

581
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:38,640
trainer. One. Yeah. Morgan trainer. I got a Morgan trainer. Yeah. I guess that's pretty good.

582
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:43,680
I think this might be my best one though. This next one, uh, goblin, Manuel Miranda.

583
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:54,480
That got a laugh. Goblin, Manuel Miranda. That is good. Yeah. Thank you. And then, uh, the last one,

584
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:59,360
I just had big foot. Like I just kind of ran out and that seems like it was kind of on the money

585
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:05,920
though. Cause we ended up kind of creating a Sasquatch big foot esque phalanche man. So except

586
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:12,320
he's short. I think he's like, cause isn't Bruce short Bruce phalanche. I don't believe he's short.

587
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:17,600
Is he not short? I see. I've seen Bruce flinch performing an Aladdin show seven years ago.

588
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:22,320
He was in that he was though. He played the widow Twankey.

589
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:29,200
The what's what character I wasn't familiar with in the story of Aladdin. That show featured

590
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:37,440
Ben Verene is the genie. Richard Karn is the Sultan. Uh, and Bruce Vellanche is the widow Twankey.

591
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:41,280
All right. Bruce is not as for my whatever reason, I thought Bruce was taller. Bruce is only five,

592
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:47,200
seven. I apologize. I was incorrect. The widow Twankey is larger than life though.

593
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:51,840
When I was seeing the widow Twankey on stage, I thought, Oh, Bruce must be six, one.

594
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:58,560
Um, I, well, I mean like what would they actually have, you know, what they would have done is like

595
01:00:58,560 --> 01:01:04,560
a reference to, you know, Jack Palance because around this time he won for city slickers and

596
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:13,680
then like did, and then did a one-armed pushup. Um, so, you know, like phantom ants. No, that's not

597
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:22,240
good. Jack-o-lantern plants. Jack-o-lantern plants. Got the pumpkin head. Easy. Could Jack be like,

598
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:27,600
uh, the skeleton that Joker turns them into when the first Batman. Oh, that's right.

599
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:37,360
Oh, that's pretty good buzzer and he kills them. Yeah. Yeah. Um, I, yeah. What do you need to,

600
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:44,000
Oh, what if like, um, could they have done an in memoriam, but it's for like creatures who haven't

601
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:50,960
haven't died yet. Like it's a somber thing for people who are stuck being alive still.

602
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:54,880
That's going to be tough though, cause you gotta really watch that.

603
01:01:55,760 --> 01:02:01,200
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, because that'll, yes. Someone does. Well, then maybe you make them all up.

604
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:06,000
That's all like, you know, it's a bunch of like bats and goblins. That's good. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

605
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:12,400
Yeah. No, no real people. I got a pitch on that that would only make it through soft openings and

606
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:19,440
would immediately get yanked. You would say in memoriam after the show and you cut to people in

607
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:24,800
the audience and immediately the feedback is like, are you threatening to kill me at this theme park?

608
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:29,360
And they're like, Oh God, we got to cut the, we all like, no, we all liked the memoriam at the

609
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:34,480
friends and family preview. It was a big hit, but it really freaked out the kids. We accidentally

610
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:39,680
got a kid on screen. They thought we were going to kill a kid at the Hollywood and vine restaurant

611
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:45,600
and now they're crying. So we got to cut it. That's yeah, that's a not, that's a not scary farm

612
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:52,160
universal horror nights pitch. Yeah. I think, yeah, that's, that's more for like the hanging

613
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:59,040
or that purge thing that got shut down for like calling 15, pulling 15 year olds on stage and

614
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:03,840
calling them skanks or whatever happened that shut that down. Well, that's another thing that would

615
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:09,600
have been a problem for updating is that for like the big heart icons nowadays, I feel like our

616
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:16,240
uh, Blumhouse stuff and the purge and that's all at university. Universal's gone all in on that for

617
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:23,920
a lot of their horror based things. Yeah. I think the securing of the IP and the getting the tone

618
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:29,200
right would have been tough. Like I think it would have been hard to make this thing genuinely scary.

619
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:33,280
If that was the idea, I think it probably would have been cute, scary, probably would have been in

620
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:39,280
haunted mansion territory. Yeah. I, yeah, Disney, I mean, obviously alien counter, they tried and

621
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:45,200
then it seems like they'll never go that scary again. And especially with your safe Chaypec

622
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:52,880
Eiger regime. Yeah. There's no way. Yeah. Which this is the risk era again. I, I, our continual

623
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:59,840
thesis that the, the Eisner hatred out there doesn't make any sense. Like this didn't get built,

624
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:05,360
look at this time where this guy's making like working on five hypothetical insane attractions

625
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:09,440
at once. One of them got built. It's one of the greatest rides ever. This thing, now we get to

626
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:15,200
look at this crazy Eddie Murphy picture. Um, and that's just, it's just a small fraction of what

627
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:20,800
uh, Eisner was making possible. Rafferty seems to have loved pitching to Eisner, just like anything

628
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:26,800
go, he would hear anything out. And uh, you know, it was a really open time. Um, I, I, this

629
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:33,520
vilification, I will never understand the joy he's given us. I know. I guess, I guess I get it that

630
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:39,920
like the last few years weren't the best decisions, but look where we wouldn't even be here if it

631
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:47,760
weren't for the man. Yeah. And I got to say, I think the thing that appeals to me, even though

632
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:53,680
like, yes, Eisner was seen very big on like the Hollywood schmoozing, all the schmoozing joke in

633
01:04:53,680 --> 01:05:01,440
the nineties, all that garbage. But like, I feel like the, the thing where Rafferty is saying like,

634
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:06,400
oh, I got two sentences out and Eisner said it was a home run. It does feel like he did go by the

635
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:12,000
gut. Like he went with a gut feeling and it would send people off to develop stuff based on like a

636
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:17,600
hunch or a gut feeling. Whereas now there's so much of like all the stuff you hear about of like,

637
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:22,480
what are the quadrants? How does this test? Well, how does this tie in with the toy division and the

638
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:26,640
home entertainment division, the streaming division? Like it's like, oh God, there's so

639
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:31,360
many hurdles nowadays. And it's like, I'm sure there were plenty of hurdles back then, but it's

640
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:36,560
like, well, a little bit of madness can be helpful or a little bit of gut feeling, you know?

641
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:42,240
Well, it's not as algorithm me back then. It seemingly it's not as like just we put it,

642
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:46,560
we punch in like, okay, this is the top earning film and we're making two more of them. And that's

643
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:51,280
what we must do. If somebody came in with a dumb idea, he would at least like entertain it.

644
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:58,080
Yeah. Now dumb ideas seem like that don't there's not even on the table. It's not possible.

645
01:05:58,080 --> 01:06:05,360
I feel like enabled an auteur like system almost within Imagineering. I wonder if like,

646
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:09,920
maybe I think people might agree with that. Like from from talking to Tony Baxter and hearing

647
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:17,760
stories from all these people, like in books like this, it does seem like he I have trouble

648
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:23,120
like naming a studio executive who may have been this way, but it's like, you know, there's

649
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:28,320
executives who you might say he might've been Eisner himself might've been one where like,

650
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:32,560
yeah, he was gross and bad and greenlit this commercial crap. But like, look, he like let

651
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:38,720
these four auteurs go make this crazy movie. There was a guy, Mike DeLuca at New Line Cinema

652
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:44,320
enabled all of the, you know, Paul Thomas Anderson movies and Austin Powers and, you know, things

653
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:49,600
that are all more interesting than anything that happens today. I do. I feel like Eisner was one

654
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:54,160
of those in a way, like, you know, you have your complaints, but if you get on his good side,

655
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:58,720
you maybe get to make your crazy thing. Yeah. Yeah. Look, we have to get it. We have to figure

656
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:05,680
out a way to get him on so we can keep this praise upon him. Another thing we like. We also.

657
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:13,520
I want to ask you guys this just because it's fresh on my mind. Do you have any, I'm not saying,

658
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:16,720
I'm not saying they're close. This is just almost like me recommending a similar band,

659
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:22,640
like a band that I know is lesser, but just has it occurred to either of you to ever

660
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:28,960
also be fond of Brandon Tartikoff? And do you know why I'm saying this at NBC? Yeah. Yeah.

661
01:07:30,560 --> 01:07:36,800
I've read the live from New York book and I feel like he is a character, a regular character in

662
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:42,880
that. Yeah, he comes up a lot. I just like, he's not nearly as prolific as Eisner, but I bring him

663
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:50,560
up because he like, I was talking about him the other day and he like jammed himself into a lot

664
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:56,640
of things where he did very stiff performances as himself. Not nearly as much as Eisner, but

665
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:02,800
you know, like he like saved by the bell. He does this very stiff appearance where he like

666
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:07,920
is in the gangs video about not doing drugs. I've got a hit idea for the fall season,

667
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:15,920
say no to dope. There's no hope with dope. I think is what it is. Or he was on, he was on

668
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:22,720
ALF as himself. He hosted Saturday Night Live and was extremely dull doing so. I just was thinking

669
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:28,720
like for the way we like Eisner, if we like very flat appearances from executives and things,

670
01:08:28,720 --> 01:08:34,160
I just want to like put a little spotlight on Tartikoff too. I was not aware that he made so

671
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:39,040
many appearances. I did just put him in Google and a picture, a very Eisner-esque picture of

672
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:46,080
him wearing like a hat and like t-shirt and sport coat just popped up. He's a little Eisner. I'm not

673
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:50,480
saying he's close. This is like Mike, when we were texting how like, oh, if you like the Doobie

674
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:57,360
brothers, you might like little feet. This is like one of them. This is an algorithm. I just like,

675
01:08:57,360 --> 01:09:03,360
check out, look up Tartikoff on Saved by the Bell and ALF. If you want to know, if Eisner's not

676
01:09:03,360 --> 01:09:10,080
giving you enough charisma-free cameos and you want a little more, check out Tartikoff.

677
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:18,160
Has this conversation ever happened on the planet Earth? I believe you have actually initiated

678
01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:22,560
something that I am confident has never happened before. Oh yeah, you like when Michael Eisner

679
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:27,520
appears and shit? You got to check out Tartikoff, man. That's never happened. This is the first time

680
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:34,080
I can easily say. With the tone of like recommending wines to each other or strains of weed,

681
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:41,360
with the just confidence and familiarity of... Yeah, and look, yeah, I just like people having

682
01:09:41,360 --> 01:09:46,320
a good time. So if you're riding high on that Eisner shit, then I just think you might want

683
01:09:46,320 --> 01:09:51,040
to chase it with a little Tartikoff. Like everything else on the show we talk about,

684
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:55,680
I think probably gets talked about in different terms. Like people have talked about Donald Duck's

685
01:09:55,760 --> 01:10:01,040
butt for a long time. They haven't called it C. We say C. That's a fun little way to do it. And

686
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:08,560
it's an original, but no Tartikoff talk in relation to his appearances like Eisner. I'm almost

687
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:13,120
confident. I think that there are... Well, I know because I was having a conversation like this,

688
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:18,640
that people are fond of Tartikoff's dull appearances and things. That's not new.

689
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:24,240
Right. Maybe recommending it like a ban. That's what I'm saying. The specific way

690
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:32,560
because then, I mean, look, prove us wrong, audience. If you've previously talked about how

691
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:39,200
you like Brandon Tartikoff's cameos, you'll see though, and I don't want to build it up too

692
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:45,840
much. Eisner obviously is better, but they could have toured together and with Tartikoff as opening

693
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:55,440
act. I would have gone to this, a live show of executives speaking very flatly and without

694
01:10:55,440 --> 01:11:04,320
charisma at the Greek theater. Would there be like a killers executive, like four killers of

695
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:14,720
executive performances tour? Oh, like the Kings of Executive, what's the banter?

696
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:21,360
Right. Well, I haven't seen much footage of them. Oh, look at that. What a champ.

697
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:27,760
That's an Eisner-esque photo. He's wearing a weird weekly world news shirt with Batboy on it.

698
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:34,880
With the Batboy cover. He's a kook. I'm going to pitch, I mean, these are more RC cola to Eisner's

699
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:42,000
coke, but the people that I think of in this vein, not in the vein of on-camera appearances,

700
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:47,280
but by kind of eccentric going for their gut that have come up before Card Walker,

701
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:53,920
the former head of Disney, who was kind of the head as Epcot was opening and Jay Stein,

702
01:11:53,920 --> 01:12:00,240
who was the head of either MCI or Universal and was as they were developing the Florida Park.

703
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:05,360
And I think he was like a cigar chomping kind of like old Hollywood kind of weirdo.

704
01:12:06,720 --> 01:12:12,720
So like if you believe in it, go out and do it. And he's like a old bastard, but

705
01:12:13,680 --> 01:12:20,400
yeah, made good stuff possible. Yeah. So but less, less the whole package than Eisner,

706
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:25,760
but elements of Eisnery sort of like, I don't know, you might know a little better.

707
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:33,520
My gut says, go try it. You know, I yeah, yeah. No, no acting though, unfortunately,

708
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:38,640
as far as I'm aware. No, Card Walker might have been, I think there's footage of him like cutting

709
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:45,280
the ribbon at Epcot or presenting it, but nothing like, you know, telling like Goofy to pick up the

710
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:51,840
slack or whatever. Well, here's what I will tell me if I'm wrong, I will cut this out if it's crazy

711
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:58,240
should in the future doesn't have to be right away. We try to find the best producer executive

712
01:12:58,240 --> 01:13:06,560
performance of all time. See what we can find on YouTube. We each bring to the table what we found

713
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:13,200
the most obscure executives in their most obscure cameos on TV shows and in promotional videos.

714
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:20,080
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I like that guy. I like the Six Flags guy who had a shaved head and he's like,

715
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:26,560
and I'm not Mr. Six, contrary to popular belief. How about, okay. I have another pitch for this idea.

716
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:33,120
Producers performance awards. That's a good name for it. Yes. Yeah. Yeah.

717
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:39,200
Or executive performance awards. Yeah. And we will give out awards for these

718
01:13:40,240 --> 01:13:46,800
to the executives and their performances. The most entertaining. And is the criteria almost,

719
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:55,440
it's like, how exciting can it be while still being inherently flat? Right. Yeah. I watched

720
01:13:56,320 --> 01:14:03,920
this last week. There was the blue loop expo, the big themed entertainment and museum kind of

721
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:10,800
trade publication. And they did like a virtual conference based out of London. Like everything

722
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:18,160
was on British summertime. And I watched some of those panels and I was like, oh man, without

723
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:24,880
like cocktail parties and free food buffets, these are just very dry presentations. But like

724
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:31,040
one of them was Eddie Soto, the ex-imagineer and just a little bit of energy, just a little bit of

725
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:35,840
charisma goes a long way on these kinds of presentations. Very interesting info on a lot

726
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:42,240
of them, but yeah, some very dry stuff. Yeah. We don't want to have you watched this.

727
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:49,360
Huh? And you chose to watch this. I watched like 90 minutes of these. I went to virtual booths

728
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:56,960
for manufacturers. I couldn't screen grab anything. I, the screen grab you couldn't really do on video

729
01:14:56,960 --> 01:15:03,440
because I was trying to record. There was a very funny presentation video about universal Beijing

730
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:10,320
and some of the local big star performers from China that they got to go like the minions are

731
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:18,480
here. Get ready for mischief. Like in subtitles. So that was fun, but nothing, nothing I really

732
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:25,040
didn't know about that park. I feel like we're, we're winding into the end of this thing. I just

733
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:31,680
want to point out one more thing, which is when, when Eddie introduces Elvira, he says,

734
01:15:31,680 --> 01:15:36,080
my favorite mistress of the dark, the loveliest creature known to creaturedom Elvira stage

735
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:41,200
direction smoke pours out of Eddie's ears. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. I have that written. Yeah.

736
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:49,440
If it ain't broke, that gag always works. You know, is it because he's turned on or is it

737
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:55,680
just because he's a monster made of steam? I think it's cause he's very horny.

738
01:15:58,480 --> 01:16:04,560
Yeah. Yeah. What would happen to his face though? Cause a robot can't do that much. So would he just

739
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:11,120
kind of say it and then smile and then smoke or does, or like, does he look shameful? Like he peed

740
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:19,680
his pants. The eyes go googly. Cause an animatronic, the jaw can't drop and the tongue

741
01:16:19,680 --> 01:16:24,800
roll out. That would be the cartoon version, but like the eye, you can make an animatronics eye

742
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:33,600
spin or head like spin. I mean, I think that's probably what you'd have to do

743
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:42,320
the way. And he's, when people get boners, he knocks over the podium with his boner.

744
01:16:44,160 --> 01:16:49,440
Like, like very long. Cause he's like a mechanical creature, right on the pin on the, on like, it's

745
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:54,640
on a hinge. The podium is on a pin. So it just like kind of like, like it falls forward.

746
01:16:56,720 --> 01:17:01,280
I'd like to imagine that in this meeting that like maybe Eddie's on the fence. He's like,

747
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:05,760
I don't know how I feel about that James Brown song. That's weird that this guy did that. Like

748
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:10,400
if he, if he, they're losing him at all, maybe Katzenberg steps in and like, and by the way,

749
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:15,440
we can make these robots to any dimension we want. So for example, if you wanted to have a giant

750
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:19,840
boner that knocked the whole podium over that we can do that, we can easily do that.

751
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:23,840
And the security guards are laughing as they leave again. Like,

752
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:37,120
Frank, their fans soup their pants. Yeah. Well, assuming that that happened, assuming that

753
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:42,560
Eddie Frank and Murphy had a Frankenboner that knocked the podium over, I think that we're

754
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:48,160
really missing it. This could have been really one of the greats. Yeah. And this is, this for

755
01:17:48,160 --> 01:17:52,960
sure. I mean, we would have liked this a lot and I would imagine it was like, like I would imagine

756
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:59,120
in a different timeline, it just closed two years ago. I think so. It would have been on that weird

757
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:04,160
list of, all right, so it's just going to be seasonal. Now we'll open it when people want

758
01:18:04,160 --> 01:18:10,160
air conditioning. Half of it's broken. And you know, and we all would have like made our significant

759
01:18:10,160 --> 01:18:16,640
others go and they'd be like, no, not this guy. I don't want to see the creature's choice again.

760
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:22,160
That's what we're missing. We gotta see pictures of all of us in front of the poster for Eddie Frank

761
01:18:22,160 --> 01:18:31,520
and Murphy's standup special raw meat. Man, Jason Vellanche strikes again. Oh man. This guy's

762
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:39,280
firing on all cylinders. Don't get Bruce, get Jason. Yeah, let's get you. Yeah. Somebody who

763
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:46,560
hired Jason, no, right. These jokes for something. Yeah. Your own scary award show, your virtuals,

764
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:53,600
anyone could do a virtual creatures choice award and should pull it together for Halloween. You

765
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:58,640
got time. This feels like they could use it. Like they should not, not scary farm should just steal

766
01:18:58,640 --> 01:19:04,960
this and make this into a live show. Just steal the concept, change the name. It doesn't have to be.

767
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:11,360
I mean, Alvira, they had Alvira for years. Bring her back, get her back. Yeah, that is another one

768
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:16,320
where it's like, Oh, their instincts were right. Everyone knew Alvira did a residency on a theme

769
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:21,520
park. Everyone knew Godzilla. Everyone knew Twilight zone. Like that there's a reason the

770
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:28,800
Imagineers are paid the big bucks. You know, an Eddie Murphy impression essentially entertains

771
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:38,000
people at a waffle cart all around the globe. Yeah. So yeah, they predict it all, it all came

772
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:46,240
true. And this was a pioneer. And it's so sad that we don't get to, I'm going to be in the creatures

773
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:54,320
choice awards in my dreams every night for a while. Yeah. And as, and, and, and, you know,

774
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:59,520
and I'll be laughing so much when I think about it that I'll be in stitches.

775
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:12,160
Nice. Jason, Jason, he'll punch that up for me. Credit to Jason. And you survived on, I guess,

776
01:20:12,160 --> 01:20:18,880
the fright, the cemetery gate. That was a long episode to come out of like five sentences.

777
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:25,920
There's like no source material. So it really shows you what, what we can do with just a little

778
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:30,480
grit and determination and a tiny amount of theme park facts. That's right. You know, we

779
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:36,640
had to warm up a little, just like the writers for award shows, you know, it's 90 minutes or two

780
01:20:36,640 --> 01:20:41,120
hours, however long the award shows goes, but they start working a few weeks before it. You gotta

781
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:48,240
work your way into it to find the gold. Yeah. Yeah. We, we, we, we hit a lot. We hit a Tinkerbell

782
01:20:48,240 --> 01:20:58,160
Regeneron. We hit a lot of, a lot of fun topics. And more to come. We, we got one more coming on

783
01:20:58,160 --> 01:21:03,360
haunt cast the freight, the cemetery game more on the main feed, obviously, but, but one more over

784
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:08,960
here and our next topic. I'm so excited about it. I think it's one that nobody could predict. And

785
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:16,960
yet when you hear it, it is essential to the Halloween experience. I can't wait for next week.

786
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:24,000
I got a lot of work to do between now and then. Yeah. To give a little behind the scenes, much

787
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:30,240
like Rafferty gave us a behind the scenes in his book. When I said, do we want to do that one

788
01:21:30,240 --> 01:21:38,640
Saturday? Scott said, I, I'm sorry. I try not to do this too often. I'm not ready. I need more time.

789
01:21:42,640 --> 01:21:46,720
Yeah. Yeah. I have a lot, I have a lot to look at. You'll, you'll understand when you hear it.

790
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:55,040
So, yeah, back to the crypt for me. And yeah, hey, join, join us back here behind the cemetery

791
01:21:55,040 --> 01:22:02,240
gate next week and we'll see on the main feed and a happy, happy hauntings, happy, happy,

792
01:22:02,240 --> 01:22:04,720
and hauntings, freaking hauntings.
