1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,840
Forever.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:03,680
Dog.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,880
Greetings, it is I, Joe Rohde.

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,200
I'm sorry I couldn't be there in person.

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,600
I'm in deepest Bora Bora,

6
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:17,160
gathering artifacts for my collection.

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,800
As you know, I'm quite the collector.

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,760
And soon, the Rohde collection will unveil

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,920
its most prized acquisition.

10
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,000
The good boys of the galaxy.

11
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,920
You see, two and a half years ago,

12
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,920
Mike, Scott, and Jason put on a little live show

13
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,480
where they made fun of my precious ear thing.

14
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,320
So in March of 2020, I locked them down in total isolation

15
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,720
where they could never do a live show again.

16
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,080
That's right, girl.

17
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,080
They can't make fun of you now.

18
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,000
In a few minutes, you will be taken to encounter

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,600
the good boys on the Dynasty Typewriter Gantry.

20
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,760
But first, you'll see my private office full of pieces

21
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,360
from all around the galaxy.

22
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,400
And soon, you'll be able to travel the galaxy

23
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,480
on Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic.

24
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:28,080
Virgin Galactic, we've got a fun billionaire.

25
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,800
You know, when Dicky Branson first called me,

26
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,960
he's joking, they're never gonna let you

27
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,760
build that second island.

28
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,480
All right, hang on.

29
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,720
Let's mute this guy.

30
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,920
Shut this guy up.

31
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,920
All right.

32
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,920
All right.

33
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,760
No way.

34
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:54,760
I like that guy better when his sound wasn't working.

35
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,920
Yeah.

36
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,840
Keep him muted, I say.

37
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,760
What's going on, everybody?

38
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,000
It's us, Three Rockets.

39
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,840
Yeah.

40
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,080
It's so good to see you guys,

41
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,800
but under not so great of circumstances.

42
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,440
Let me tell you what's happening.

43
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:24,200
That crazy Joe Roady, he has captured the good boys

44
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,080
in the Dynasty Typewriter Gantry lift.

45
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,720
We gotta do something.

46
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,480
We gotta bust them out of there.

47
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:35,040
Yeah, he could have at least sent them to Alani Resort.

48
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,360
Somewhere nice that he has access to.

49
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,960
The Alani prison.

50
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,920
But they're just up there rotten.

51
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,560
They've been up there since March of 2020.

52
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,920
That's why they couldn't do a live show.

53
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,320
It had nothing to do with the other thing.

54
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,800
Yeah, don't think about the other thing.

55
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,520
Don't give one thought to the other thing.

56
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,560
Think about the other thing.

57
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,880
I'm sure it won't get referenced tonight at all ever again.

58
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:06,400
Not on anybody's mind, but we gotta do something, right?

59
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,480
What are we gonna do, Rocket Two?

60
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,200
We got a plan.

61
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,080
We're gonna take the Dynasty Typewriter Gantry lift

62
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,320
up to the Dynasty Typewriter generator

63
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,960
in this historic, beautiful building.

64
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,720
Blow the generator, which will unleash all of the cages

65
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,520
that they have in this old comedy theater,

66
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,080
and free the good boys.

67
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,400
Yeah, that's right.

68
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,560
Yeah.

69
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,640
That's right.

70
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:36,640
Hopefully, hopefully it won't free any other podcasters too.

71
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,200
Just those three guys we like.

72
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,120
They'd get very confusing otherwise.

73
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,600
One, two, three voices.

74
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,040
Ben Shapiro ain't locked up in here, hopefully.

75
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,800
We never know what monsters we could unleash.

76
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,200
Monsters after dark, ah.

77
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,400
Scary.

78
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,480
Okay, so that's the plan.

79
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,760
That's what we're gonna do, and let's go to the,

80
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,280
wait a minute, wait a minute.

81
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,920
I forgot one thing.

82
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,640
We better address the elephant in the room,

83
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,120
the hitch in the plan.

84
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:10,240
Yeah, that hitch, it's incredibly complicated.

85
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:16,200
Pay attention to what we're gonna say to you now.

86
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,880
Take some notes, perhaps.

87
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,720
How do we put this?

88
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:23,520
Okay, it involves certain appendages.

89
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,360
Yeah.

90
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,240
Certain parts of the body.

91
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,600
How do we, it's embarrassing to talk about, really.

92
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,760
Yeah, let's go back a little.

93
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,120
Let's go back a little, okay.

94
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,040
You guys know arms.

95
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,520
Okay, the thing at the end of arms.

96
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,960
Now, hold on, hold on.

97
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,360
I know what you're thinking, shoulders?

98
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,800
Nope, wrong way, wrong way.

99
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,720
That's up.

100
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,120
You wanna go down, you wanna go down the arm.

101
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,640
Not wrists.

102
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,480
Not wrists.

103
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,320
Not wrists, no.

104
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,160
Keep going, keep going.

105
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,520
Wrists are great, our flexibility is fine.

106
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,320
We love wrists, but we ain't talking about wrists.

107
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,600
It's really what's attached to those wrists.

108
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,760
Let's just, I guess, out with it.

109
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,200
Here's the issue.

110
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,200
Our hands don't skin.

111
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,640
Oh wow, it's like you guys were ahead of us.

112
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,360
You somehow knew the issue.

113
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,880
Well, here's really where it becomes a trivia challenge,

114
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,880
because do you know the second part?

115
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,520
It involves you, hints.

116
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,760
Okay, let's see.

117
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,040
Our hands don't skin.

118
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,880
Yours do.

119
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,840
Oh, okay, great.

120
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,560
They're way ahead of us on this.

121
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,680
Yeah, so smart, they're so smart.

122
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,840
Should we say it one more time, just to reiterate?

123
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,360
I really wanna make sure everybody's got it.

124
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,760
Yeah, let's say it, let's make a meal out of it.

125
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:44,040
Okay, let's all raise our voices

126
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,640
and make sure we understand the situation.

127
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:49,160
Okay, all together now.

128
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:53,440
Our hands don't skin.

129
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,280
Yours do.

130
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,000
Wow, wow, give yourselves a round of applause.

131
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,840
Woo!

132
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,000
With your hands that skin, ours do not.

133
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,560
I shouldn't keep reiterating, I think they get it.

134
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,400
I think they understand.

135
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,680
So we can move on with the rest of the plan,

136
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,160
and here's what it is.

137
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,760
When we give you the signal,

138
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,320
you are going to raise your hands,

139
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,520
and that way you get the clearance,

140
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,680
and the chaos can begin.

141
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,520
Yeah.

142
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,720
Yeah.

143
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,000
The chaos of three men in their 30s,

144
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,880
calmly talking about a theme park attraction.

145
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,440
Chaos.

146
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,640
And you know, it's been a while.

147
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,760
They might want to amend that.

148
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,720
They're pretty firmly late 30s.

149
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,880
We got older, folks.

150
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,600
We all lived a lifetime in these last two years.

151
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,520
Oh, there I am, bringing up the thing again.

152
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:49,960
Okay, let's cut that off, and let's get on with the show.

153
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,440
We understand the plan, right?

154
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,400
We all understand the plan.

155
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,400
Yeah, we know.

156
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,840
Then here we go, let's get this show on the road.

157
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,960
Here we go.

158
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,640
Okay, this is the part.

159
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,680
This is where it all happens.

160
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,840
We're gonna plug in this Zoom recorder,

161
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,880
a podcaster's best friend.

162
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,840
Now just ignore the scotch tape on the back

163
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,160
holding the battery compartment on.

164
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,360
It's for professional fidelity.

165
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,800
Don't worry about it.

166
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,600
Okay, so when we plug this thing,

167
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,960
when the Rockets plug you in,

168
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,960
Podcast the Right does its first live show

169
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,840
in over two years.

170
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,680
Yeah!

171
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,520
Hey!

172
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,360
Oh, you're right!

173
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,200
We love it.

174
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,360
Okay, it's the moment.

175
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,200
Let's...

176
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,160
Okay, it's...

177
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,840
All right, hold, I never get this right.

178
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,480
Hold on, again.

179
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,960
There's the center pad, which way does that go?

180
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,240
I know, it's always the center.

181
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,080
Yeah, okay.

182
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:43,920
You know what?

183
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,320
This may be more of a one person thing,

184
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,160
so why don't you take that?

185
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,000
All right, yeah, yeah, okay.

186
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Just let me look forward there and let's see it in one sec.

187
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,360
You know what?

188
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,800
I'd say close enough.

189
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,280
Okay, let's do this!

190
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,120
Yeah!

191
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:56,960
Yeah!

192
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,240
Yeah, all right, let's see those hands, people!

193
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,520
You got clearance, it's Podcast the Right Live!

194
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,640
Wow!

195
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,360
Hi, hello!

196
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,200
Whoa, hi!

197
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,400
Hello, oh, I still have a tail!

198
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,720
I forgot about the tail.

199
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,560
What tail?

200
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:36,560
Us, we've been dressed for years and we're out!

201
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,400
We're us!

202
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,760
We're finally out!

203
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:43,600
And you're out too, you're out in a real place!

204
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:47,920
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, a theme park about podcasts

205
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,280
that's coming to you live from a room

206
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,120
of 200 people who are not on Zoom!

207
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,800
This is not on Zoom!

208
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:59,160
I think you said a theme park about podcasts.

209
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,960
A theme park, oh geez, I'm just so excited!

210
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,680
I'm getting mixed up!

211
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:06,000
We're rusty at doing a live show, folks!

212
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
So yeah, we're gonna say things tonight

213
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,480
that are gonna be weird!

214
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,000
Yes, brain farts aplenty.

215
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,520
Hopefully just brain farts.

216
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,240
No real farts.

217
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,880
No, we can promise.

218
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,720
We'll try to promise that.

219
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,960
That's not our humor.

220
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,280
It's a bit bawdy.

221
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,120
It's a bit bawdy.

222
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,880
That would be a bit bawdy.

223
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,880
No, no, no.

224
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,040
Well, speaking of getting mixed up,

225
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,480
we forgot the part where we say our names.

226
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,160
My name is Scott Gardner, hi, everybody.

227
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,880
Hi, I'm Jason Sheridan.

228
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:37,280
And your names?

229
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,760
I'm Jason Sheridan.

230
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,600
Yeah.

231
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,440
Thank you.

232
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,960
Hi, I'm Michael Carlson.

233
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,800
Hey.

234
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,520
Mike Carlson, whatever.

235
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,760
I say Mike on the show, why did I say Michael?

236
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,720
You're giving your official sag registered name

237
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,560
to the audience.

238
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,400
Well, no, I didn't even do that.

239
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,200
My sag name is Michael R. Carlson.

240
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,040
Yeah.

241
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,480
Because there is already a Michael Carlson

242
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,360
or is there a Mike Carlson?

243
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,200
I forget.

244
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,120
I hate him.

245
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,440
Get out of the business.

246
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,280
Boo.

247
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,120
Boo.

248
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,240
Leave room for our Michael Carlson.

249
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,840
Just to take things down for a sec, this is incredible.

250
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,960
I'm so happy you guys are here.

251
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,760
We've waited so long to do this.

252
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:24,240
I thought so much through those,

253
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,160
I probably like pathetically practiced to a wall like,

254
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,360
hey, if I get to ride this live,

255
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,280
we're back for the first time in four months

256
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,120
and then it kept getting longer and longer and longer.

257
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,400
But now we're here, we're doing it

258
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,840
and a dynasty typewriter, which we love.

259
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,680
We're so happy.

260
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,520
Thank you.

261
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,360
Thank you.

262
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,280
Oh, this feels great.

263
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,840
Yeah, I'm glad people are still here.

264
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,000
And there's still, you're like,

265
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,360
two years is a long time.

266
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,120
You're like, yeah, there's a new theme park podcast

267
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,480
we like now.

268
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,920
That's possible.

269
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,760
No way.

270
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,320
There's a bunch of people that do a theme park podcast

271
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,400
not just about Aerosmith.

272
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,240
Like they don't talk about it.

273
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,800
You know what I like about this theme park podcast?

274
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,320
No Aerosmith talk.

275
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,400
I could see that being refreshing.

276
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,240
It's possible.

277
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,080
Yes.

278
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:12,920
I wouldn't be mad.

279
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:13,760
I wouldn't hold it against you guys.

280
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,560
A podcast about theme parks that talks about rides

281
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,640
more often.

282
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,680
We have it's appeal.

283
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,080
Aren't there enough of those?

284
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,040
He's right.

285
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:23,880
Jason's right.

286
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,720
Jason's right.

287
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,120
We're doing it perfectly.

288
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,920
So, but thank you for coming.

289
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:29,760
Thank you, God.

290
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,000
If we're getting cheap reactions from everybody,

291
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,440
there's one thing that I've dreamed about

292
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,280
in all of this time.

293
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,920
I've really been waiting for this

294
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,800
and I hope you guys can help me out with it.

295
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,240
Okay, here we go.

296
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,480
If I need to make a telephone call.

297
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,820
I'll use the air.

298
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,740
Okay, you asked for it.

299
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,880
That's the new one.

300
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,880
Asshole Mickey in the house.

301
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,640
Asshole Mickey's here.

302
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,880
I don't think I can do Mickey after Rocket.

303
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,080
That's not a good voice cocktail.

304
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:09,920
No.

305
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,760
Yeah, that's too hard.

306
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,960
Rocketified.

307
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,760
Can I say real quick as far as if we're gonna get

308
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,680
some cheap reactions.

309
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,520
Yes, that's all it's gonna be.

310
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,520
As I was driving here, and I didn't realize this

311
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,160
because obviously it wasn't on my radar,

312
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:24,000
maybe the last time I was driving through Echo Park,

313
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,120
there is a street called Clifford Drive.

314
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,040
Like five minutes from here.

315
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,400
And I thought that was a good sign.

316
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,640
I thought that that was a sign the show was gonna go well.

317
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,480
Yeah, absolutely.

318
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,480
And I got out and I kissed the sign.

319
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:40,280
I got back in the car and I drove through.

320
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,600
We haven't had the chance to,

321
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,880
the Clifford's thing is new.

322
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,480
By round of applause.

323
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,960
Somebody made a noise that they're sick.

324
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,800
They got sick to the stomach.

325
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,640
What should we do first?

326
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:52,200
Any reaction's a good reaction, right?

327
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:56,200
By round of applause, do you like the show?

328
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:00,080
Do you like being called Clifford's?

329
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:03,080
That's pretty good.

330
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,720
Yeah, yeah, I'm worried though.

331
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:09,080
By round of applause, do you not like being called Clifford's?

332
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,280
A substantial showing for the latter.

333
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,240
I think honestly, I think there was less people

334
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,800
but stronger claps.

335
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,720
That's my reading of it.

336
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,840
They've been storing it up for a long time.

337
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,680
Yeah, yeah.

338
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:32,120
Geez, yeah, it's been a long time.

339
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,960
It feels really great.

340
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,400
The last time that we were in front

341
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,600
of an audience of any kind,

342
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:42,680
it was a pop-up performance art show

343
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:47,200
in an about to close electronics store in Anaheim.

344
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,680
That's right.

345
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,960
I got to be in a video for Fry's Electronics

346
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:56,120
for precisely two days before the store shut down forever.

347
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:59,000
That's probably the reason it got to happen in general.

348
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,960
Was anyone here at that also?

349
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,800
Oh, great, okay.

350
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,040
Thank you. Thank you.

351
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:08,200
Well, you got to see the home theater screening room,

352
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,840
which seemed like it was about to collapse on us

353
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,360
when we were sitting in there.

354
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,600
Yeah, the wrecking ball might have come through

355
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,440
right then and there.

356
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,200
Yeah, knocking the asbestos right out of the walls.

357
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,600
Just a bunch of dorks in there, who cares?

358
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,440
Yeah.

359
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,760
So that's the last time we were in front of you.

360
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,320
There is a, I'm so glad you guys are back.

361
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:39,440
There was one special guest at that occasion,

362
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:44,440
which was my son, and oh geez, he was, thank you.

363
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,000
You knew what you were doing.

364
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,160
I wasn't sure.

365
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:56,080
At that point in time, he was negative six weeks old,

366
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:00,440
and he was still in the womb.

367
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:03,600
Now, so much time has passed, he is almost two years old.

368
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,600
And my wonderful wife Erin and I just had the great occasion

369
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,520
of taking him to Disneyland for the first time.

370
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:17,000
We have a photo.

371
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Look at that!

372
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:24,240
Pretty cute, huh?

373
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,320
Had to get some cheap applause for that.

374
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,760
There he is, eyeing his next victim.

375
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:35,920
Pretty young, huh?

376
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,040
Too late for you.

377
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,760
Another one of your dad's kind, huh?

378
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,600
Your dad's making money off my back.

379
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:51,600
I hear, I hear him a little joke saving,

380
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,800
and I'm keeping score.

381
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,360
There's a reason we vet who comes to Galactic Starclozer.

382
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:11,440
Nonetheless, yeah, wonderful moment.

383
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:16,200
And you know, we did a lot of fun stuff with him

384
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,800
that day, one thing that we did not take him on,

385
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,280
can't imagine how this could have been possible,

386
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,720
but he was not allowed on the ride

387
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,520
that is the topic for tonight's episode,

388
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,880
which if you hadn't guessed already,

389
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,160
it is related to what we started doing earlier tonight.

390
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,960
We were talking- But what if it wasn't?

391
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:41,880
Hey, it's the teacups, surprise!

392
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,960
We did tie these things together.

393
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,120
Tonight we are talking about

394
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:49,120
Guardians of the Galaxy mission breakouts.

395
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:49,960
Yes.

396
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:50,800
Yes.

397
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,920
I'm excited, you know, it was a big night,

398
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:57,920
and I think we had to do a big one and a fun one.

399
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,960
I've been thinking about,

400
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,880
I've been a little self-conscious about,

401
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,680
so far in 2022, it's been a lot of weird,

402
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,960
unpleasant shit, right?

403
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,080
I mean, I've been thinking about,

404
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,280
it's been a lot of weird, unpleasant shit, right?

405
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,680
Wait, wait, that we've done, or just in general?

406
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

407
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,080
I mean, but you know, because it's been all these,

408
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:22,640
these failed restaurant tours- Restaurants, yeah.

409
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,960
And-

410
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,760
Air Armageddon.

411
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

412
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,440
Yeah.

413
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,360
Not so much talking about the possibility of Armageddon,

414
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,160
but the ride- The ride itself.

415
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:34,120
Armageddon is good, the movie's good, the ride is bad.

416
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,800
Right, right.

417
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,680
Jay Bigga, we've had to-

418
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,800
Yeah.

419
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,800
Through, that's not the worst thing.

420
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,200
And ladies and gentlemen, joining us tonight.

421
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,840
Joining us tonight to beat the shit out of us.

422
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,400
He hates being called a Clifford too.

423
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:04,360
No, but this, I think, I'm so excited to do,

424
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,280
for a celebration, which this is tonight,

425
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:09,720
to do a ride that is a celebration that's a lot of fun

426
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,400
and that I think we're all extremely fond of.

427
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,240
I think so.

428
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,080
I think so.

429
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,680
And with that, let's step two steps backwards

430
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,600
into our chairs.

431
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,440
Ah.

432
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,280
Yeah.

433
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,120
Yeah.

434
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,440
Oh, wonderful.

435
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,920
Oh, it's getting rough.

436
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:29,320
A podcaster's natural position.

437
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,400
All the way back.

438
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,400
Leaning back.

439
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,560
Scratching.

440
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,560
Really making a meal out of it.

441
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,560
Yeah, so we're doing Guardians of the Galaxy

442
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,400
mission breakout, which is different.

443
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,240
The last time we were at Dynasty, we did Superstar Limo.

444
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:52,880
Which is not as, I mean, popular for all of you.

445
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:57,120
But not for like a normal person.

446
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,720
And I mean that in the best way.

447
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:01,960
But-

448
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,240
That's when people go on.

449
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,080
A lot of people-

450
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:05,920
People go on it.

451
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,440
They get excited to go on it.

452
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,680
Yeah, where to start?

453
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:13,920
Well, you know what's one thing maybe is,

454
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,840
we're leading it by saying that we all

455
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,560
like this attraction, a lot of the three of us.

456
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,480
But what is, what are your opinions?

457
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,600
I keep turning to the audience.

458
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,440
I'm curious.

459
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,360
I guess I'm so excited to have one.

460
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,800
Gonna turn this into a Mori or something.

461
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,320
Let's go to the audience.

462
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,760
What's the question?

463
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:31,600
I guess like-

464
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:36,720
I think Tower of Terror is a ride everyone loves.

465
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,520
But in hindsight now, I think let's get the same

466
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:43,800
applause-o-meter that we did for the Clifford's question.

467
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:48,800
And let's ask, are you happy now that this was changed

468
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,640
to Guardians or are you still mad and you want Tower back?

469
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,680
So let's do the first question.

470
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:57,440
Are you happy they changed this to Guardians of the Galaxy?

471
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,440
Pretty good.

472
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,840
Pretty sustained.

473
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,920
Okay, now are you upset?

474
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,760
This is the same thing though.

475
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:15,120
Less people, stronger claps.

476
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:15,960
I know it.

477
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:16,800
I can hear it.

478
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,560
Those are sweaty claps.

479
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,720
Yeah.

480
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,360
That's like, somebody's gonna throw their shoulder

481
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,920
out doing it, like trying to get that, the volume up.

482
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,760
Stinging now.

483
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,680
Hard claps for the abbreviated Tower of Terror.

484
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:33,880
The abbreviated like quick fix for California Adventure.

485
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:38,120
It's like the Chili's to go of Tower of Terror.

486
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,680
Yeah.

487
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,520
Do we think there's anything about that Tower of Terror

488
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,160
as opposed to the other ones?

489
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:49,200
That you know, it's not this new story like Japan had.

490
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:55,600
It's not like markedly worse and boring like Paris.

491
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,680
The same as what we had.

492
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,600
I don't know what I'm saying.

493
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:03,600
But like, was there anything like, only that tower had it?

494
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,120
No, right?

495
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:09,240
Is there anything anyone could shout out that's like,

496
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,080
this is this one.

497
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:10,920
Is there something special about it?

498
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:11,840
Yeah.

499
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:12,680
Yeah, no.

500
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,520
The answer's not.

501
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,560
You're answering for.

502
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,400
Yeah.

503
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,880
Which, yeah.

504
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,480
It was nice to have the Tower of Terror here.

505
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,160
I will say that.

506
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,320
I wasn't mad, but I liked the Tower of Terror a lot.

507
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,120
Avoid some plane trips.

508
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,480
Avoid some plane trips.

509
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:29,880
What was that?

510
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:30,840
No Chris Pratt.

511
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:31,680
Got him.

512
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,280
Got him.

513
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,200
That wasn't picked up.

514
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,320
You know he's gonna be in like a Tower of Terror movie

515
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,120
in the next 10 years.

516
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,680
And they would have added him to it.

517
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,040
It was bound to happen.

518
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,760
Well, there was, you know, people were a little bit mad

519
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:50,160
when this change out was announced.

520
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:53,800
There was, I think summer of 2016,

521
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,360
the rumors started flying about this.

522
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,600
And it seemed like a weird rumor.

523
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,440
Oh yeah.

524
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,280
Yeah, yeah.

525
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,680
It was, I remember where I was.

526
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,200
I'm not kidding.

527
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:09,240
We were at Comic-Con, I believe, when the rumor popped up.

528
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,960
And then it was announced at Comic-Con too, wasn't it?

529
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:12,880
Yeah.

530
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,920
I think so.

531
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:16,320
Was all those people flooded out of the room,

532
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,240
screaming and flailing?

533
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,080
It was.

534
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,320
I mean, that's a pretty warm audience to announce it.

535
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,160
Yeah.

536
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,000
I feel like.

537
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,560
Jim Hill mentioned it a few weeks before

538
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,320
I think it was announced.

539
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,200
It was like a, Jim Hill was like a trial balloon

540
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,160
to see how people would react.

541
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,400
But yeah, it was a crazy rumor.

542
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,640
It did feel like it was not, there's no way that's true.

543
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,960
It seemed very odd.

544
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,480
And then when it was officially announced

545
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,560
and then the turnaround time,

546
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,760
like it's announced in summer of 2016,

547
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:48,160
Tower of Terror closes January 2017.

548
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:52,640
Guardians opens May 27th, 2017.

549
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,920
Same day as Pandora World of Avatar

550
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,080
on the other coast.

551
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,600
Big weekend for Rhodey.

552
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,480
Big weekend for Joe Rhodey.

553
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,320
Yeah.

554
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,160
Yeah.

555
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:06,440
That's also, I mean, that's fast for any theme park company.

556
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:09,240
That is lightning fast for Disney.

557
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,080
Yeah, yeah.

558
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,400
That's part of what seemed weird about it, I would think.

559
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,240
Yeah.

560
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,360
No, Incredible.

561
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,200
That was him.

562
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,280
That was like Phil Collins getting to be at both LiveAids.

563
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:22,040
They're taking the Concord.

564
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:27,360
My favorite semi-relevant reference of people.

565
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,920
It's like that Foo Fighters releasing the acoustic album

566
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,760
and the electric album the same day.

567
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,640
You know?

568
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,600
Everyone's thinking about it.

569
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,760
Look, I'm in a good mood because we're in front of people

570
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,600
and I'm happy to be back.

571
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,600
So I will throw this your way.

572
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:50,000
Do you think that a reasonable analog is like,

573
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,600
Guardians of the Galaxy is like a perfect Green Day album

574
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,120
as opposed to one that is slightly less than perfect?

575
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,680
The answer is yes.

576
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:04,440
The answer is it's perfect like American Idiot or Dookie

577
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:07,280
or honestly, I like Nimrod a lot.

578
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,000
There's maybe a couple tracks you could cut,

579
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,680
but honestly, why would you?

580
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,800
I'm not in that good of a mood.

581
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,200
Fair enough.

582
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,240
I would love to see some Green Day on the ride, but...

583
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,080
But...

584
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,480
When they go 90s, when it's the 90s refresh.

585
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:34,800
Let me say something about when this announcement was made

586
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:38,280
and people who were not terribly happy about it.

587
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,200
I wouldn't have known about this article

588
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,440
except they flashed through it really quickly

589
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,960
in the Imagineering story when they're explaining all this.

590
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,800
There's an article in Slate

591
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,880
and the headline of the article is,

592
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,960
Disneyland's Tower of Terror is Closing.

593
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,680
This is a national tragedy.

594
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:01,400
And I got curious what the rest of it was.

595
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,480
An important context for the little bit I'm gonna read

596
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:08,080
is that this is from October 12th, 2016.

597
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,840
Just place yourself in what was happening then.

598
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,400
I'm bringing up an even worse time.

599
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,480
Chilled the room.

600
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,600
Okay, so I have clicked on what I think is an article

601
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,920
about a ride closing and getting replaced by another ride

602
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,760
that'll probably be okay.

603
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,800
And then it starts, this past Sunday,

604
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,200
as I watched one of our country's presidential nominees

605
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,320
threaten to put his opponent in prison,

606
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:32,760
I was reminded of my favorite quote by Friedrich Nietzsche.

607
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,160
Where are we?

608
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,560
Look, I guess I can't blame this person.

609
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:42,280
This is probably what any of us would have written

610
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,000
about any topic.

611
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,720
What do you think about gumballs?

612
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,560
Well...

613
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,840
What do you think about hot dogs?

614
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,160
Well, Baudrillard once said...

615
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,440
No, it's a crazy...

616
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:03,320
And then further in, and yet shortly before,

617
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,800
please, sweet merciful Christ on a pony,

618
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,800
someone who is not Donald Trump

619
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:11,840
takes the oath of office this coming January of 2017.

620
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,680
Oops.

621
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:15,640
The California Tower of Terror will take its final drop.

622
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,400
So...

623
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,160
So...

624
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,400
Neither issue worked out the way

625
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,720
this late person wanted it to go.

626
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,680
On the brighter side, both Avatar and Guardians of the Galaxy

627
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:36,280
feature Zoe Saldana.

628
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,680
So there's that.

629
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,960
Yeah.

630
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,640
That's a little brighter, huh?

631
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,480
Right?

632
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,160
She's kind of the connection between the movie.

633
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:49,280
And I think soon they could introduce

634
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:53,960
the seed bearer's big seed into both of these attractions.

635
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:56,760
The seed bearer, one of the hypothetical titles of,

636
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:59,720
I think it's the third Avatar?

637
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,880
The way of water is second, okay?

638
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:06,200
So you put the seed bearer in the queue for Guardians,

639
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,120
and then you put the big seed...

640
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,480
No, you put the big seed in the queue,

641
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,720
and then the seed bearer does meet and greets at Pandora.

642
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,840
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

643
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,360
Sorry, I'm just blue-skying,

644
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,320
I just got a little caught up in it.

645
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,440
I'm just interested, do you think there's a very large seed

646
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,280
in that movie?

647
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,480
Okay.

648
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:26,400
I think, because I think if it's called the seed bearer,

649
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,360
it's one of two things.

650
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,440
There's either one real big seed,

651
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,000
or there's a person with a lot of little seeds.

652
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,480
And I think they're just gonna cheap out,

653
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,520
I think it's gonna be too cheap to just do a lot

654
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:41,080
of little seeds in the Guardians queue.

655
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:44,440
The seed bearer would seem to indicate there's one entity

656
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,000
that is the bearer.

657
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,080
So this entity would have to be very large

658
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,400
to carry a large seed.

659
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,080
Yeah, he's an avatar.

660
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,280
Or whatever they're called.

661
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,680
Okay, wait, okay, wait, well, I don't wanna get this

662
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:59,400
completely off the rails here, but when you say...

663
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,960
When you say large seed, do you mean like a foot?

664
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,520
Because that's a large seed.

665
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:09,840
Yeah, I think like a big thing, or it could be even bigger.

666
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,360
I mean, not to jump too far ahead,

667
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:14,720
like the Adam Warlock cocoon that's in the Guardians queue,

668
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:19,480
they could just swap out the sign and go, big seed.

669
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,400
The seed bearer's big seed.

670
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,720
But a seed is normally this big,

671
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:28,120
so even a five inch seed is a big seed.

672
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:32,800
Well, but it's not, but on the world of Pandora,

673
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:36,040
in the hallelujah mountains, that's not gonna grow much.

674
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,120
A little seed's not gonna grow much.

675
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:40,200
Not gonna grow much?

676
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:43,120
I think a five inch seed would grow a substantial.

677
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,320
I think it would grow, yeah.

678
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,040
No, it'll grow something, but you want,

679
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:50,640
I mean, if it's big trees with those big mountains.

680
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,920
What do you think the seed looked like

681
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:54,040
when there were like forests up in Northern California?

682
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,760
They were little.

683
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,440
At some point.

684
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,280
That's my point.

685
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,120
Maybe.

686
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,960
I'm surprised that I'm leaning Jason's way,

687
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:04,200
and I'll scoot this way to prove that I am,

688
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,040
but I think, okay, yeah, you're right,

689
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,960
the Northern California trees are big,

690
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:11,080
but that big tree in Avatar,

691
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,480
that's one of the hugest trees I've ever seen,

692
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,720
the one that burns down,

693
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,480
and they need a new one of those.

694
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:18,080
They can't wait around for a little seed to grow.

695
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,320
They gotta start big to get big.

696
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,040
Oh, so you think, okay, again,

697
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,200
not to get off the rails here, but you think,

698
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,840
when the seed is bigger,

699
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,440
the actual thing it's growing starts bigger.

700
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:34,120
Only in this universe, in the imagination of James Cameron.

701
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,320
So the answer is yes.

702
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,960
So it's almost like,

703
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,880
if it's a big seed, you put it in the ground,

704
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,320
and something grows that's like pony size

705
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,520
within like a week.

706
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,680
That's just a root.

707
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,480
So in the grand scheme of the tree,

708
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,480
that's just a little root.

709
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:50,160
Well, I guess we'll have to wait 11 years to find out.

710
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,000
Yeah.

711
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,480
Guardian.

712
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,200
Guardian of the galaxy.

713
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:03,280
Guardian was where this began.

714
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,040
Do you, okay, the movie, okay.

715
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,800
I like these movies.

716
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,040
Yeah.

717
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:10,880
Yeah.

718
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,160
Yeah, I think that's right.

719
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:16,000
I think the box office reflects that.

720
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,840
I think a lot of people like these movies, Michael.

721
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:18,680
Not like cult opinion, I guess.

722
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,760
They're fun movies.

723
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:25,000
I mean, look, it's not Citizen Kane, but it-

724
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,520
Do you typically judge things on that scale?

725
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,720
I'm a film aficionado

726
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:34,240
who only compares things to Citizen Kane.

727
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,320
So when you're watching one of your favorite films,

728
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,800
such as the Paul Lind Halloween special.

729
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,280
That's true.

730
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,440
Is this a Citizen Kane?

731
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,880
Will they make a ride

732
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,360
based on the Paul Lind Halloween special?

733
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:54,480
So I was like reasonably, like, I definitely was like,

734
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,960
when I heard that, I was like,

735
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:58,520
ah, this seems, it seems like a bad idea.

736
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,960
I did think that, even though I was like,

737
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,400
oh, the movies are a fun little distraction.

738
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:08,920
Yeah, if we unpack that, yeah, why did we think,

739
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:11,000
I guess maybe the rush job nature of it,

740
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,480
and maybe it seemed a little gross.

741
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,560
Like let's just jam a currently popular thing in

742
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,480
as fast as possible.

743
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,160
That could have mixed results.

744
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,200
And it did seem like, I guess I was thinking

745
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,480
Tower of Terror seemed untouchable.

746
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,320
I think that's like, as much as we like to make fun of,

747
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:29,880
like when people pick it when a ride is going away,

748
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,080
there are still a bunch of things that like,

749
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,640
I go, well, I never, and I get very upset.

750
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,720
Like that Polynesian weird hotel thing,

751
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,000
like they're the expansion.

752
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
I was like, I am so, like, I'm embarrassed

753
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
that I'm like so upset about this.

754
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,000
But it definitely felt, yeah, like when,

755
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,560
when they announced the change, I was like,

756
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:51,400
well, that's not gonna, how would that work?

757
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,440
Show me how that would work.

758
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,880
And at that time in 2016, 17, you're like,

759
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:58,000
this is the angriest announcement

760
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,400
from the Disney company will ever make me.

761
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,920
Nothing could be worse.

762
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,400
Actually, to tie things together,

763
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:12,080
I think that the reason that this happened

764
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:15,960
is it is, it's 2016 or so, and Disney's owned Marvel

765
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,440
for like five years.

766
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,440
And they're looking around and saying,

767
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:24,440
we've not done anything like big and permanent with Marvel.

768
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,600
Why are we not?

769
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,240
And I think the person leading this charge

770
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,520
was the then chairman of Perks and Resorts,

771
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,320
whose name is Bob Shaping.

772
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:35,160
Oh, yeah.

773
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,200
I thought everybody could use.

774
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:41,360
We knew that was coming, sure, yeah.

775
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,480
Feels pretty good in this voice.

776
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,120
Yeah, you heard us.

777
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,880
Was this his last win?

778
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:53,560
Cause it's just been L after L since then.

779
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,680
It's a stunning record at this point.

780
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,040
It's really, yeah.

781
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:00,040
Of like basic corporate confidence,

782
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:02,360
or competence, I should say.

783
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:05,080
Yeah, so he was there, he was there at the.

784
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,760
Yeah, so I think he was feeling it.

785
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:11,080
This gets presented to Joe Roady,

786
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:15,040
who is refreshingly not towing the party line.

787
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:18,720
I feel like in every interview that I found Joe Roady doing

788
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,480
about this attraction, that he admits

789
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:25,240
that his initial thought was, that sounds stupid.

790
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,280
So if your first reaction was that, Mike,

791
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:31,320
and that was the reaction of the person who made the thing.

792
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:33,440
Right, so Joe and I, same page.

793
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,440
Hmm?

794
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,640
As far as our feelings, yeah.

795
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:38,080
That's why we wandered into his collection

796
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,680
to try to connect on this point.

797
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,520
Right, yeah.

798
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,760
And then we were stuck for two years.

799
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:46,000
So anyway, he fights through that.

800
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,360
That's what he said, that's impossible,

801
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,800
that's a dumb idea, but then you have

802
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,040
to work your way through that.

803
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:52,080
I don't think they knew it was Guardians of the Galaxy

804
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,360
initially, apparently they considered something

805
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,120
with Spider-Man, they considered something

806
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:59,040
with Doctor Strange, I don't know what those could've been,

807
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,880
but Guardians of the Galaxy was extremely popular

808
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:05,120
at that moment, and then the second one on the way,

809
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,920
they're filming it as they're having this idea,

810
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,800
which means everybody's in one place,

811
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:13,000
and they can actually film stuff with the cast,

812
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,800
which they did, all our favorites are back.

813
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:19,120
Most of the audience's favorites are back.

814
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,560
Yeah.

815
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,280
Yeah, yeah, it's interesting to think,

816
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,960
because Spider-Man makes some sense, I feel like.

817
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,840
You're going up and down, maybe it's a skyscraper

818
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:31,360
of some kind, Doctor Strange, his Sanctum Sanctorum

819
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,920
is a very famous building that we all know and love.

820
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:38,840
It's a creepy building full of portals

821
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:41,640
and other dimensional beings.

822
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:43,760
I'm sitting here thinking, do we talk about

823
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,320
the Sanctum Sanctorum on the show a lot,

824
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,920
or do Mike and I just talk about Sanctum Sanctorum a lot

825
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:53,040
in our personal life to each other?

826
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:56,200
How many people, should we ask the audience again?

827
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:59,200
Does anybody remember us saying the word Sanctum Sanctorum?

828
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,720
Yeah.

829
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,880
Not enough, apparently.

830
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,240
Not enough.

831
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:05,680
So we're gonna up that, don't worry.

832
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,680
It's gonna be on every other episode now.

833
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:11,200
So yeah, that makes sense that you would have

834
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:15,400
a weird elevator journey with Doctor Strange, I don't know.

835
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,680
I don't know that there's a famous elevator,

836
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,600
I don't know if Stanley and Steve Dicco

837
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,680
had a famous elevator, but you could have

838
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,080
retconned that in, I think.

839
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:28,560
But it does make sense, it all makes sense.

840
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:32,400
For something that's like a retool of an old ride,

841
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,840
it does make a lot of, it's really smartly done.

842
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,120
He really did it.

843
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,120
Joe, Joe Rudy.

844
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:41,440
He did, you're right that there's an odd,

845
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,240
and maybe some of what he bumped on is that

846
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:47,720
it is an elevator, ultimately, it is your vehicle.

847
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,280
And it was an elevator that was meant to be

848
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:53,200
an elevator in this hotel, but now almost

849
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,120
anything else you do with it, probably it needs

850
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,720
to not be an elevator.

851
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:00,640
And now we're in the world of science fiction

852
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,960
and comic books and fantasy, so we can turn this

853
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,680
into anything that we can dream up.

854
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:08,360
And where we land is Gantry Lift.

855
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,920
Yeah.

856
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,000
We are in a Gantry Lift.

857
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,480
Has anyone heard this phrase before in your life?

858
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,320
Well, Jason mentions this on the show,

859
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,160
that his dad dunked on him.

860
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:23,400
Yeah, I got my ass roasted by my dad,

861
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:27,040
who grew up during the space age, and he's like,

862
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:31,840
anyone who grew up watching multiple rocket launches,

863
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:34,280
they all they did was talk about the astronauts

864
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:38,320
are boarding the Gantry Lift, like again and again.

865
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,800
So, yeah, the boomers did something right.

866
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,720
Gantry Lifts, congrats, Ken.

867
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,640
Gantry Lift, I mean, it is good.

868
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,600
Like, you have to give it up for this ride,

869
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,200
because there's so many different things

870
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:54,080
that like just are burrowed now in our brains,

871
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,480
in the same way that any like ride

872
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,880
that's been there for 50 years, like Gantry Lift,

873
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:00,080
it's a phrase I'll never forget.

874
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:02,080
I'll be in a retirement home and I'll be like,

875
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:06,360
Gantry Lift, Gantry Lift.

876
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,480
I'll be like, oh, Mr. Carlson's talking

877
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,280
about a Gantry Lift again.

878
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,440
Sanctum Centaur.

879
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,680
Nimrod, perfect track listing.

880
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,200
Green Day.

881
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:26,560
Mighty Akron, something only I said.

882
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,880
I did that, I did that.

883
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,560
If Mighty Akron has a phrase

884
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:34,280
is in one of the Avatar movies, it's because of me.

885
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,160
It's true.

886
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:39,720
They don't say it in the movie.

887
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:41,840
It's me.

888
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:45,160
That Mighty Akron is choking on that giant seed.

889
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:51,120
If that happens in the movie,

890
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:56,120
I'm gonna be like both thrilled and upset at the same time.

891
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,560
Entitled to royalties, yes.

892
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:58,400
Yeah.

893
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,840
So we got a Gantry Lift.

894
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:03,800
What else in terms of like thinking out this thing?

895
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,800
Well, another step of it, I think, with Rhodey

896
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:10,160
is like, it's a hotel, what else do you turn this thing into?

897
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,880
Then he takes a walk, he looks at it, and he thinks,

898
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,120
well, as long as you take the signage off,

899
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:17,880
there's not a lot here that necessarily says hotel,

900
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,960
which is kind of fourth dimensional on his part

901
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,640
because I see hotel.

902
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,400
I don't think anybody could have imagined

903
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:26,280
what it would, like what it is,

904
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,720
which is the collector's fortress,

905
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:33,720
is not like an immediate, like it is weird and crazy.

906
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:36,720
I remember you saying that pre-podcast,

907
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,200
we weren't doing it, we were just doing it to ourselves.

908
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,040
And you were.

909
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:42,480
Yeah.

910
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,360
To our significant others, talking to ourself.

911
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:48,480
But I remember you being, Mikey being an early adopter

912
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,080
of like, as soon as that art was out,

913
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:53,120
I think you're like, this thing's weird.

914
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,640
And maybe weird is good.

915
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:58,760
Yes, I felt like a Jack Kirby or Steve Ditko

916
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:02,640
or some like old, bizarre like monstrosity.

917
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,360
Colors don't really match.

918
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,960
It ended up looking a little different, I feel like,

919
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,720
than the concept art, but like,

920
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,920
it definitely was like right up my alley

921
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,480
as far as being like a bizarre like base.

922
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,760
Like as a child, I was obsessed with like the base

923
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,320
of a villain or the heroes.

924
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,360
Like I was, I've said this before,

925
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,360
I was obsessed with where people slept.

926
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,280
Like I loved knowing where the Ghostbusters

927
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,560
were, where their beds were.

928
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:32,920
And as a kid, I, who you know what I'm talking about?

929
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:36,960
You were really hoping to see the collectors like caught

930
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,440
behind the desk at the office.

931
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,600
I would, yeah, do you think he sleeps in a cot?

932
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:46,080
Like when he shows that he wants to work long hours,

933
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,400
like on the Theranos show where it's like,

934
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,960
here's my sleeping bag.

935
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:54,000
I'm a total psycho, I sleep at the office sometimes.

936
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,920
I mean, yeah, I would look,

937
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,080
I would like to see his sleeping bag.

938
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,280
I would like to see his cot.

939
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,600
I would like to see all that stuff.

940
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,920
So when I saw it, it felt like a crazy,

941
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:09,040
weird comic book thing, which is like now with the,

942
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,840
the Vendors Campus is like such a,

943
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,080
and I like it, I will say this,

944
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,240
I don't know if we've talked about it a lot.

945
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,040
I think we've come around a little even more

946
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:18,120
to a Vendors Campus lately in general,

947
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:21,440
but I will say the thing that's like a nonsense thing,

948
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:24,200
the comic book thing is still the Guardians Tower.

949
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:28,080
It still looks like a crazy thing that like I would scribble

950
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,040
on a notebook when I was in third grade,

951
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,120
which I think is good.

952
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:32,280
And it's been annexed.

953
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,520
It's now an Avengers Campus.

954
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,680
Yes, it is technically an Avengers Campus

955
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,440
and they added the blue goo,

956
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,920
which I don't know, am I getting my head on myself

957
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,240
by talking about the blue goo already?

958
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,320
You can talk about the blue goo

959
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,480
whenever your heart desires.

960
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,400
The, which is the Kirby Crackle.

961
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,720
Yeah, it's supposed to be like energy.

962
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:49,600
I hear applause for the Kirby Crackle.

963
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,720
The Kirby Crackle.

964
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:51,560
We love to see it.

965
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:52,840
The Crackle is like energy,

966
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:57,000
like how Jack Kirby would draw energy or whatever.

967
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,960
It definitely looks more like goo,

968
00:40:58,960 --> 00:40:59,800
but it looks a lot like goo.

969
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,560
It looks like we're trying, you know, I like it.

970
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:05,640
So yeah, cause the initial story of the ride was that,

971
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:07,400
I guess there was a Tower of Terror was there

972
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:10,400
and then all of a sudden the Guardians Tower thing

973
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,400
just like planted.

974
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,480
It appeared.

975
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,320
Yes. It appeared.

976
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,320
Yeah, this is what Joe Roady said.

977
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:16,960
This is a story just like, you know,

978
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:20,680
one day a big lock with the Avengers logo showed up.

979
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,400
We remember the big lock.

980
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,640
We should do an episode on the big lock.

981
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,080
Wait, when you say lock, do you mean the like thing

982
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:27,920
in the ground?

983
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,760
The big latch like thing in the ground.

984
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:32,040
That was more of like a manhole cover or something.

985
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,040
Yeah, I don't know.

986
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:33,880
Not really a lock.

987
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,280
Well, look, this is an hour.

988
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,000
We're going to have to figure out what to call it.

989
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,600
And that's a second gate.

990
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,200
And that's how the magic gets made.

991
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,040
Yeah.

992
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,160
Got one.

993
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:44,000
Got one.

994
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:44,820
Collected.

995
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:45,660
A seed.

996
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:46,640
Perfect.

997
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,160
No, you're right.

998
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,280
In the story of the ride, it is that like,

999
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,000
this just appeared one day.

1000
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:51,840
Yeah.

1001
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:55,000
So I guess the campus was there and then the collector's

1002
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,040
building just appeared out of nowhere as if it was

1003
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,400
transported there.

1004
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,920
And that's as far as we know.

1005
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,080
That's all we know.

1006
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,200
Okay. Yes.

1007
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,080
Which is pretty mysterious, I guess.

1008
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:07,480
And that leaves us a lot to figure out.

1009
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:08,600
Yes.

1010
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:11,200
So this ride is based around,

1011
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:15,600
the collector is the character Tantalier Tavon.

1012
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:16,440
Tantalier Tavon.

1013
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,560
Tantalier, not Tantalier.

1014
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,120
No, not Tantalier.

1015
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,880
I like Chanticleer.

1016
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:22,720
Chanticleer?

1017
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:23,540
No.

1018
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:26,800
I like Tantalier.

1019
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,560
Tantalier is a little like more coy.

1020
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,400
I'm Tantalier Tavon.

1021
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:34,880
You should consider putting an extra T in there.

1022
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:37,240
No, I'll just leave it to you to say.

1023
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:38,920
I'll just say Tavon from this point.

1024
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:39,760
Sure.

1025
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:43,220
But he's from, he's from Guardians, the movie,

1026
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:45,000
but it's not a big part.

1027
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,600
So it's a little weird that there's a whole ride

1028
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:48,960
with a lot of him.

1029
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,800
Benicio del Toro being the actor who plays him.

1030
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:52,640
Yes, it is.

1031
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:55,800
He has like one scene in the first Guardians.

1032
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:58,240
Does he have a scene in the second one?

1033
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,840
He's in an Infinity War as well.

1034
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:02,800
But again, another like one scene.

1035
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:03,960
Yeah.

1036
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:05,320
And they took him and then they made.

1037
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:08,840
This is like the most Benicio content that exists

1038
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:10,240
is in the theme park ride.

1039
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:12,960
It's like he has like one.

1040
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,040
No, excuse me.

1041
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:17,240
He has a post credit scene in a different Marvel movie

1042
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:19,360
as well and I can't remember what it was.

1043
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:22,200
Thor.

1044
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:24,720
I, a lot of Thor, the dark world fans out here.

1045
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,240
Often considered the worst Marvel movie.

1046
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:31,040
All of the Thor, the dark world fans are here.

1047
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:36,440
I like the end of, I think the last 30 minutes

1048
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:38,200
of Thor, the dark world are good.

1049
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:39,800
I think those are good minutes.

1050
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:42,320
That's how we're wrapping up the show.

1051
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,400
We're just gonna play those.

1052
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:45,000
We're just gonna show the, yeah.

1053
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:48,640
So yeah, so he's, what was that?

1054
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:50,120
He's also in What If.

1055
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:50,960
Oh, well he's in What If.

1056
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:54,320
He's in What If, the cartoon which I have not seen.

1057
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:58,160
What, people upset about that?

1058
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,080
Am I not a big enough nerd for you?

1059
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:02,680
I got other things.

1060
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:05,440
First of all, I have to get to Yellowstone.

1061
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:06,680
I'm gonna get to it.

1062
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:08,560
Saying yes.

1063
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:09,920
I'm gonna watch Yellowstone.

1064
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,360
More pressure on you.

1065
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:13,040
Yellowstone before What If.

1066
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,920
So in the same way that like Hondo and Naka,

1067
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,600
it's like the, I like, it's a kind of a Disney tradition.

1068
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:21,440
I feel like to take a character

1069
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:24,200
that's not the main character and make it.

1070
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:25,200
Flesh it out a little.

1071
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:28,760
Yeah, make that the kind of focal point of the ride.

1072
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:30,240
Or of the pre-show, I should say.

1073
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:31,720
Maybe as close as we're getting in a way

1074
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:33,800
because we don't get a lot of original IP.

1075
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:36,320
So the most original you can get is something

1076
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:38,480
that somebody we haven't really met.

1077
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:39,320
Yeah. Little.

1078
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:40,560
He's kind of a background guy.

1079
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:41,800
Exactly, so.

1080
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:42,640
Take what we can get.

1081
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:43,760
Benicio's great.

1082
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:45,880
Obviously he's a very interesting actor.

1083
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:47,880
And I get.

1084
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:51,800
People thought I meant that sincerely.

1085
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,840
Should we put, if we're talking Benicio,

1086
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:56,520
should we pull up a clip?

1087
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:57,360
Yeah, why don't we?

1088
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:58,200
Yes, yes.

1089
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:02,920
This odd, I don't know if people here saw

1090
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:06,360
the opening ceremony of this attraction.

1091
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:09,080
That was a weird hush.

1092
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:12,000
I don't know what that means.

1093
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,720
It is a fun opening ceremony, I'll say that.

1094
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:19,800
Because they have some executives giving very dry,

1095
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:23,240
we're so excited for this new innovation.

1096
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:26,800
And then they've got some celebs there.

1097
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:27,800
And they do like.

1098
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:28,720
Go Rooker.

1099
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:29,560
Rooker's there.

1100
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,200
Rooker.

1101
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:32,640
Yondu.

1102
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,440
Yondu, that's right.

1103
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:36,400
It's his character.

1104
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:39,280
Also.

1105
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:40,120
Also.

1106
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:40,960
Yondu.

1107
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:44,600
Yeah, I like Yondu.

1108
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:46,280
He's got the arrow.

1109
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:48,200
He shoots an arrow.

1110
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:50,360
I have no idea what he is.

1111
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:51,840
He's blue.

1112
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:53,720
I'm experiencing him by applause.

1113
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:57,640
You are more of like a Rooker in Mallrats guy.

1114
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:01,560
Yeah, remember he eats the thing with the poop on his hands?

1115
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:02,840
With the pretzel.

1116
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:04,080
Chocolate covered pretzel.

1117
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:06,160
Why watch other movies where you can just watch

1118
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:09,880
the View-ist Universe over and over and over again?

1119
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:10,720
Exactly.

1120
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:14,440
This video, this opening ceremony,

1121
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:15,520
where were you saying something else about?

1122
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:16,440
Oh no, no.

1123
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,720
I was just setting up the clip.

1124
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:21,880
This is kind of the end of the opening ceremony.

1125
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:24,320
And we got a little surprise.

1126
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:26,520
Well it's a bunch of celebrities are introduced

1127
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:27,400
as themselves.

1128
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:29,040
They come out and do nothing.

1129
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,440
And then they smile.

1130
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:34,280
And then there's a big sudden interruption.

1131
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:35,880
By the way, original character I think,

1132
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:38,080
Afida, might be saying it wrong, who knows?

1133
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:41,760
But I think it's the pink girl who holds her hands

1134
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:44,120
where I think is original to this attraction.

1135
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:44,960
Yeah, she's in the movie.

1136
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:45,800
No, all right, all right.

1137
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:47,560
Well I read that somewhere.

1138
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:50,200
So the sight was wrong, not me.

1139
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:53,080
Right, that's how it works.

1140
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:55,480
Say the sight, say the sight.

1141
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:57,480
What is it, magicmouse.com?

1142
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:02,240
Bumper car boys, rumors and news.

1143
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:04,120
Boo.

1144
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,160
Let me astray again.

1145
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:08,280
You sons of bitches.

1146
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:09,960
We'll get them, sorry.

1147
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:11,360
All right, here we go.

1148
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:12,200
Opening ceremony.

1149
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:17,680
Oh my, he's here, he's here.

1150
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:19,680
Everyone, prepare yourselves.

1151
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,440
Terence, it is time to introduce James.

1152
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:26,200
James is kind of saying hello to someone during this.

1153
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:28,280
I have great assistance to come to your planet

1154
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:31,680
and humbly grace you with this blessing.

1155
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:32,520
He's like, doesn't seem too worried.

1156
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:34,520
Where have you been, James?

1157
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:37,240
I'm here.

1158
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:43,240
Shape X having a giggle.

1159
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:46,880
Shadowy figure approaching.

1160
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:47,720
Who is it?

1161
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:49,520
Oh my gosh.

1162
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:53,360
Can't see, too much mist.

1163
00:47:57,360 --> 00:47:58,200
Benicio.

1164
00:47:58,240 --> 00:47:59,040
Benicio.

1165
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:07,720
You're Benicio del Toro.

1166
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:09,880
Hello.

1167
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:12,360
You can't be here.

1168
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:13,640
The collector would not be pleased.

1169
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:15,560
A Terran cannot stand in his place.

1170
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:18,440
Oh, I don't think you'll mind.

1171
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:29,800
I'm here to

1172
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:35,480
the opening of the Tyvon collection.

1173
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:45,520
Ladies and gentlemen, of terror,

1174
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:48,400
the Tyvon collection is officially open.

1175
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:53,960
How about that?

1176
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:56,960
I like that, this fireworks and stuff.

1177
00:48:58,200 --> 00:48:59,040
Great.

1178
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:05,080
Those are maybe, those are like the two most

1179
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:07,560
mismatched actors I've ever seen.

1180
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:12,360
Giant theme park energy, whatever shall we do?

1181
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
He does seem amused to be there.

1182
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,520
He also, if I can remind everyone at the time,

1183
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:24,960
Benicio del Toro was the spokesman for Heineken

1184
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,200
and it seems like he just came from the rap party.

1185
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,960
I like to think he had like three Carthay Manhattans.

1186
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:37,280
And then came over there.

1187
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:40,640
Knew what he was doing, he would have, yeah.

1188
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:42,760
So that's great.

1189
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:45,280
And that, the opening of the attraction

1190
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:47,240
kind of marks the immediate turn,

1191
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:48,360
where everybody's upset and there's

1192
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,720
change.org petitions and stuff.

1193
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:54,280
The people, again it's 2016, people have like

1194
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:56,880
anger free time on their hands.

1195
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:58,400
They don't know how busy they're gonna be

1196
00:49:58,400 --> 00:49:59,720
with petitions soon enough.

1197
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:08,680
But pretty quickly, upon the opening of the

1198
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:10,600
attraction, it like, it turns so fast.

1199
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:11,920
Like as soon as anybody goes on it,

1200
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:14,520
this is great and really fun and inventive.

1201
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:18,120
Can I ask the audience, was anyone there on opening day?

1202
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:22,360
Oh wow, that got no response, okay.

1203
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:26,400
I will tell you who was at opening day, Mike and I.

1204
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:31,400
We were there and I believe, correct me if I'm wrong,

1205
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:32,880
we waited.

1206
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:34,040
We waited like four and a half hours.

1207
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:35,560
Were we there opening day?

1208
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:37,920
I swore it was opening day.

1209
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:39,240
Maybe it was a day later.

1210
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,720
I thought it was opening day because we waited

1211
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,720
four and a half hours.

1212
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:46,320
It might have been opening day but we definitely

1213
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:49,080
waited four and a half hours with like a bunch of like,

1214
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:51,440
we were backstage, like we were in weird places.

1215
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:53,480
We were waiting in weird places.

1216
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:55,480
That's how big the line was.

1217
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:58,360
And then we shared a Hulk donut.

1218
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:01,960
Yes, filled with apple pie filling, the Hulk's favorite.

1219
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:20,480
It's those little details in the parks, you know?

1220
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:21,840
Those little Marvel details.

1221
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:25,000
The Hulk, true believers, I wanna tell you something

1222
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,360
about the Hulk.

1223
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:28,640
He loves apple pie filling.

1224
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:31,000
Excelsior.

1225
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:36,800
We remember the Stan Soapbox where he said it.

1226
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:41,800
We had something else too, didn't we split something else?

1227
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:45,480
I think we, I think you got something at Schmoozy's

1228
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:48,400
and then went, this is disgusting and I finished it.

1229
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:50,520
Yeah.

1230
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:53,440
The perfect pair.

1231
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:54,280
What'd you do without each other?

1232
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:56,000
He's Jason, as I've said many times,

1233
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,440
he's eaten soup after me.

1234
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:01,720
Well not in the last two and a half years.

1235
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:03,000
I mean not, go on.

1236
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:06,360
It was at Disneyland.

1237
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:08,120
And it was actually a bit.

1238
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:09,280
Disneyland soup?

1239
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:11,400
It was at, no, no, it was a bisque.

1240
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:12,600
It was the bisque at the.

1241
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:18,680
Oh fancy, I'd like to think that was all sarcastic.

1242
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:20,240
I don't think it was.

1243
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:22,360
I was being made fun of, yeah.

1244
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:24,680
I was being made fun of by the audience.

1245
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,080
Well, so, well the four and a half hours

1246
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:29,800
gave you plenty of time to admire,

1247
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:34,800
well first some random dumpsters and delivery roads.

1248
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:37,840
But once you got into the building itself,

1249
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:41,480
the collector's fortress itself, many treasures.

1250
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:43,720
Yeah, yeah, the queue itself is great.

1251
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:47,240
The loop has got a lot of weird pitch down noises

1252
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:50,040
and it's like, the collector's not just a collector

1253
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:53,080
of things, he's a collector of sounds.

1254
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:54,880
He loves sounds.

1255
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:01,920
And foliage too, there's a lot of plants in the line

1256
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:04,080
and I read something that the Imagineers called it

1257
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:07,240
the gardens of the galaxy and I think that's real cute.

1258
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:10,480
It is, it is cute.

1259
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:16,480
You get this video where you meet the collector

1260
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:20,320
and he kind of gives you the gist of things

1261
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:25,320
and you see the guardians trapped in their cages.

1262
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:27,800
A lot is explained to you there.

1263
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:31,960
A big info dump video but a fun info dump video.

1264
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:34,760
And they're in no mere cages, they are in cages

1265
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:39,560
that are perfectly in the center of a big hollow building.

1266
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:41,080
It's attached to a lot of power.

1267
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:44,760
He's a collector of power too, of sounds and power

1268
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:49,440
and spikes and big spiky gears which are way below

1269
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:52,520
the guardians so if you think them just stepping

1270
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:55,280
out of the cage will be enough, think again.

1271
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:58,840
Yes, it's full of, with all this, look,

1272
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:01,320
I have not seen this new Batman, okay?

1273
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:03,360
But guardians are the- Yellowstone first.

1274
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:05,360
Yellowstone first, what if?

1275
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:08,600
Then the Pattinson Batman.

1276
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,320
But it's full of nonsense.

1277
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:15,400
The Guardians of the Galaxy is full of nonsense.

1278
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:19,520
This is what I love as a kid, crazy contraptions

1279
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:20,880
that could never be built.

1280
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:24,320
It's not like grounding the collector,

1281
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:28,720
like you go and see him buy the cages from Home Depot

1282
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:31,720
which is how you would do it in the newer Batmans

1283
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:33,920
where it's so grounded in reality.

1284
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:35,880
You see him construct the cages and the cages

1285
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:38,840
have to be a certain height and his base,

1286
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:41,960
you have to watch him sign the rental agreement for it.

1287
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:44,040
It's like grounded in reality.

1288
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:46,440
We need to see how this happened.

1289
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:48,600
We don't need to see the cages be constructed

1290
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:51,560
in his tower where we- I figured out your clue, Riddler.

1291
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:53,520
I listened to your podcast.

1292
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:57,600
Does the Riddler have a podcast in the new movie?

1293
00:54:57,600 --> 00:54:59,960
No, kind of. Kind of.

1294
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:02,160
I feel like I have heard that and then I was worried

1295
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:03,760
I made it up.

1296
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:05,160
He has a Twitch channel.

1297
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:08,680
Okay, so he's hitting all the social media.

1298
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:10,800
Got it, got it, okay.

1299
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:14,600
Well, so this will age as well as the maze

1300
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:17,400
of flip phone feeds in Dark Knight.

1301
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:22,560
So many flip phones, gonna triangulate 400 flip phones.

1302
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:25,200
We have to tap into the signal of all the flip phones.

1303
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:29,440
We have to flip them open and then track them.

1304
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:33,320
Verbatim dialogue from the Dark Knight.

1305
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:36,080
Let me see. Sorry.

1306
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:37,840
Let me see your Motorola razor

1307
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:40,440
so I can reverse engineer your Motorola razor.

1308
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:43,360
I probably will like this, man.

1309
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:46,000
I'm just saying, it's all full of nonsense that I,

1310
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,400
as a kid, I liked.

1311
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:49,600
Why I liked all this stuff is like crazy bases

1312
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:52,440
and stupid stuff that is impossible to build.

1313
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:55,680
Well, speaking of like crazy little kid stuff in this,

1314
00:55:55,680 --> 00:56:00,120
very quickly in this video, you get the Stan Lee cameo.

1315
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:01,320
Yes.

1316
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:04,560
Who has just one line, there's like a bunch of items

1317
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:06,720
are trapped and he is the first thing that lets you know

1318
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:10,120
that living beings are trapped in this facility as well.

1319
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:13,640
And he says, hey, do you guys validate?

1320
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:18,640
And it's like as silly corn balls, anything Stan Lee does.

1321
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:21,640
And now listen, I'm no Marvel person,

1322
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:23,720
I've proven that time and time again.

1323
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:27,920
But I love these, I love the Stan Lee cameo.

1324
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:28,760
Really?

1325
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:30,960
And I bet, I do, especially in this,

1326
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:33,200
because it just reminded me how much I like that like,

1327
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:36,120
at least there is, there'll be one part of any

1328
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:39,120
of these things that feels like a seventies variety special.

1329
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:41,280
That's true.

1330
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:46,920
Or when we had, I think we've lost this now a little bit,

1331
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:51,920
because certain Marvel things are to me,

1332
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:53,240
Be careful.

1333
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:57,440
endless death slogs that are very boring and confusing.

1334
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:58,880
I don't know what anything is.

1335
00:56:58,880 --> 00:56:59,720
Well, now.

1336
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:05,160
Now hold on, that endless death slog is gonna pay off

1337
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:06,560
in the fifth Spider-Man.

1338
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:09,040
Okay.

1339
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:11,040
Problem is you aren't watching enough endless death slogs.

1340
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:13,320
It's still planning, so it's like when Arrested Velming

1341
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:15,840
would do like a call forwards.

1342
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:17,480
Yeah.

1343
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:19,760
But if there was, you know, some of these that have been

1344
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:22,920
kind of a trudge recently, if there was just that one

1345
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:25,800
little thing puncturing fit, like a guy who is as good

1346
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:29,320
at acting as Ralph Nader hosting SNL in the seventies.

1347
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:33,920
Doesn't know where to look, he's done so many of them

1348
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:36,040
and still it's just as bad.

1349
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:38,720
He was in his nineties.

1350
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:43,040
This is one of the last appearances that I have to think.

1351
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:45,840
It could be one of them, or it could be like the tenth

1352
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:48,000
to last, I'm trying to think.

1353
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:51,400
He was in, was he in one of the Infinity Wars?

1354
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:52,520
He's in both.

1355
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:53,640
He's in both of them, okay.

1356
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:54,840
What's the second one?

1357
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:57,720
He's in the seventies, he drives by, he says,

1358
00:57:57,720 --> 00:57:58,840
he's in the car.

1359
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:00,240
And that's the last one, right?

1360
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:01,080
Yeah.

1361
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:02,000
Perfect.

1362
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,200
Well.

1363
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:06,040
A perfect way to go out is in that, is the end of the first

1364
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:06,880
whatever phase.

1365
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:09,480
Color me impressed, sir, thank you for your help.

1366
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:15,760
Yeah, it's, yeah, it's, he's, I'm trying to think about

1367
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:17,360
my feelings about Stan.

1368
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:21,480
He, what I think I liked about Marvel, and I love DC,

1369
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:25,600
what I liked about Marvel was like his weird nonsense,

1370
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:29,600
like his jokey tone that they kept literally in the movies

1371
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:33,360
with him, like he was literally in there where it was

1372
00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:37,200
oftentimes not completely like deathly serious,

1373
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:40,400
like DC, now there's obviously like 60s Batman's nonsense,

1374
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:42,320
nonsensical, but in a good way.

1375
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:45,720
Maybe he did one, what if he did, he pre-filmed a post

1376
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:49,560
credits for the last Marvel movie, whenever that is.

1377
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:53,880
Well, when is the, when is this, when did the scientists say

1378
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:55,480
we, how long do they say we have?

1379
00:58:56,560 --> 00:59:00,960
50 years or something, or is that just 50 years until

1380
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:03,160
it's like we have to stay inside all again?

1381
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:08,120
And watch all the stuff, and what then, hopefully by then

1382
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:10,120
you'll be watching Yellowstone, Michael.

1383
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:12,680
I hope, I hope.

1384
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:15,720
Let's talk about some of the stuff that you see,

1385
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:19,840
because so much like, yeah, the stuff in the fortress

1386
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:24,360
is extremely cool and great for theme park nerds,

1387
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:28,360
because there's so many fun Easter egg-y things.

1388
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:30,960
We have pictures of a couple of them, or the, well,

1389
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:32,440
feel free to call it anything that,

1390
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:33,760
first, because there's Marvel stuff too.

1391
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:36,400
The big one I think is, the big one in the universe

1392
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:40,320
is Cosmo, which is all, like, I wanna see that robot dog,

1393
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:44,680
almost as good as the ride itself is this robot dog

1394
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:46,400
that's in one of the things you feel bad,

1395
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:48,880
because he's like caught in a cage, but he's got,

1396
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:51,480
he's very cute, I think we can all agree.

1397
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:53,640
The Cosmo is cute.

1398
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:54,480
Very cute.

1399
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:55,480
Cosmo is very cute.

1400
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:59,280
The other animatronics, the, is it Vilous?

1401
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:01,920
The little guys that kinda like look around

1402
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:03,880
that they added at some point, those are cute?

1403
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:05,560
Yeah, like the technology where like,

1404
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:08,840
I think it can see your eyes, like it knows,

1405
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:09,880
like if you're looking at them.

1406
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:11,080
Like motion tracking.

1407
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:13,760
Yeah, which obviously is some sort of

1408
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:15,520
crazy war technology.

1409
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:16,360
Yeah.

1410
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:17,200
Yeah.

1411
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:18,040
Yeah.

1412
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:21,080
But being used for cute aliens.

1413
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:23,360
But those are great.

1414
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:27,520
You've got a Nova Corps outfit, I believe, in the corner.

1415
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:29,520
I mentioned the big Adam Warlock egg,

1416
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:32,320
which really gives me a lot of joy as a comic book fan,

1417
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:35,800
because when I was a kid, Warlock comics,

1418
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:39,200
and a lot of the Infinity War stuff, was quarter bin fodder.

1419
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:41,160
Like it may as well have been garbage,

1420
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:46,000
or like you're buying it to line your bird's bird cage.

1421
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:49,680
And now it is the biggest thing in the world.

1422
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:52,440
Yeah, did you read, were you a big Adam Warlock fan?

1423
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:54,120
That's not a character that's not appeared yet.

1424
01:00:54,120 --> 01:00:56,320
I believe in the next one is appearing.

1425
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:57,920
I think so, yeah, they're setting it up.

1426
01:00:57,920 --> 01:00:58,760
Yes, I'm hearing yes.

1427
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:00,840
But did you, like, were you imagining,

1428
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:01,680
like living inside his egg?

1429
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:04,560
I really couldn't make heads nor tails of it.

1430
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:07,640
And it all looked very like stuffy and old fashioned,

1431
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:11,400
compared to like, you know, Jim Lee and Mark Silvestri

1432
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:14,280
and stuff, drawing giant guys with big pouches

1433
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:18,280
and giant guns and sexy ladies, you know?

1434
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:19,960
This is where I crack a beer.

1435
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:20,800
Yeah.

1436
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:23,440
Proceed, gentlemen.

1437
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:24,280
What, what?

1438
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:27,120
Every, there's little runs on the podcast.

1439
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:29,520
Like it happened earlier when they were talking

1440
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:31,560
about Green Day albums, where we just retreat

1441
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:33,120
into our mind palaces.

1442
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:35,680
And we were just, you know.

1443
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:36,600
What do you think I'm doing?

1444
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:37,440
Yeah.

1445
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:39,040
Who's the, Jason, who's the sassiest

1446
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:40,320
of the ladies on the X-Men?

1447
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:42,160
The sassiest?

1448
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:43,880
You just said a sassy lady.

1449
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:45,760
Well, I said sexy ladies, but sassy.

1450
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:46,840
Oh, you said sexy?

1451
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:47,800
Well, yeah.

1452
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:50,160
Jason, this is podcast The Ride.

1453
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:51,000
Body, body.

1454
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:56,560
You know, it's a cabaret, it's an old comedy theater.

1455
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:58,200
You gotta be a little blue.

1456
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:00,160
Is this a burlesque theater to you?

1457
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:01,560
Is this a burlesque show?

1458
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:02,400
I don't know.

1459
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:03,240
Look at these lights.

1460
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:05,920
Who knows what was here a hundred years ago?

1461
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:08,080
Now let's wave those pasties around.

1462
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:08,920
Yeah.

1463
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:10,760
They're just, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1464
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:11,600
Wait, hold on.

1465
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:12,560
Let me cut you off right there.

1466
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:14,000
Who's the sexiest of the X-Men?

1467
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,960
Well, we don't have enough time.

1468
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:20,720
We don't have enough time.

1469
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:22,640
Scott just revealed that he liked Gadget

1470
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:24,360
from Inspector Gadget, or Inspector Gadget

1471
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:25,400
from the Rescue Rangers.

1472
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:26,240
Yeah, why not?

1473
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:28,760
You just got to select Inspector Gadget.

1474
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:31,200
I like Inspector Gadget too, yeah.

1475
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:33,920
I mean, imagine the possibilities.

1476
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:35,680
The possibilities are endless.

1477
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:39,320
So many tools and toys.

1478
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:44,000
That's like your darling Nicky situation.

1479
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:44,840
My what?

1480
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:46,680
Your darling Nicky situation.

1481
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:48,520
Prince's darling Nicky, a song about,

1482
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:51,600
a body song by an artist named Prince,

1483
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:52,440
who had devices.

1484
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:53,480
She had a lot of devices.

1485
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:54,320
I don't want to.

1486
01:02:55,360 --> 01:02:57,000
Michael, the short answer to your question

1487
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:00,360
in terms of sassiness would be the Southern Belle rogue.

1488
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:01,760
Am I right, people?

1489
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:02,600
Woo!

1490
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:03,440
Yeah!

1491
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:04,280
Yeah!

1492
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:06,200
The first time rogues got

1493
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:08,120
in a poppet dynasty typewriter, I think.

1494
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:08,960
Yeah.

1495
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:13,480
Let's talk about the theme park stuff that you see.

1496
01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:14,320
Yes.

1497
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:16,560
The people who, the characters,

1498
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:18,400
the loved ones who they've trapped.

1499
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:19,360
Yes.

1500
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:22,080
And who we get to sort of see again.

1501
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:28,320
So yeah, I mean, the big one, our old friend, Figment.

1502
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:29,160
Figment.

1503
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:30,000
Get him!

1504
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:33,760
Through very foggy glass.

1505
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:35,840
The foggiest glass.

1506
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:39,240
And we asked Tony Baxter, Figment's daddy, we asked him.

1507
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:40,080
Yeah.

1508
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:40,920
Yeah.

1509
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:41,760
Yeah.

1510
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:42,600
Yeah.

1511
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:43,440
Yeah.

1512
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:44,280
Yeah.

1513
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:45,120
Yeah.

1514
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:46,800
Tony's W-2 for a long time.

1515
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:51,400
We asked him when we interviewed him a few years ago,

1516
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:52,600
we said, what do you feel about that?

1517
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:55,360
And he said, I like it, but I wish you could see him.

1518
01:03:55,360 --> 01:03:56,200
Yeah.

1519
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:57,040
Oh.

1520
01:03:57,040 --> 01:03:57,880
Yeah.

1521
01:03:57,880 --> 01:04:00,920
Has he ever put his hands against the glass,

1522
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:02,880
like a prison visit?

1523
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:04,680
Or like the end of Armageddon.

1524
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:08,800
They, yeah, he brings them.

1525
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:10,040
Don't wanna miss a thing.

1526
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:12,560
So yeah, it would be nice

1527
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:14,680
if they could get that glass a little cleaner.

1528
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:18,080
Unless it's the new Figment, in which case stay there.

1529
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:18,920
Oh yeah.

1530
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:21,200
Who else?

1531
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:22,520
We have.

1532
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:24,960
Oh yeah, the original Yeti.

1533
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:27,160
Pretty good.

1534
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:30,480
That new Yeti is awesome, I will say though.

1535
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:31,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1536
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:32,200
Yep.

1537
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:33,840
All right, so he can stay there, that's fine.

1538
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:35,360
I think maybe everybody's well placed.

1539
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:36,920
This octopus from Country Bear's.

1540
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:37,760
Dolores.

1541
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:39,400
Dolores C. Octopus from the.

1542
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:40,240
Hell yeah.

1543
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:41,080
Country Bear Vacation.

1544
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:42,320
Beautiful world.

1545
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:43,160
That's fun.

1546
01:04:43,160 --> 01:04:44,080
So and I've said this before on the show,

1547
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:46,440
it is interesting to me that now it is canon

1548
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:48,680
that the collector, Tanelier Tavon,

1549
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:50,480
is a big Disney Parks fan.

1550
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,400
He loves Disney Parks.

1551
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:57,680
I assume he has Park Stars, the vinyl toys that I do.

1552
01:04:57,680 --> 01:04:59,600
And he's probably got a collection

1553
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:02,000
that rivals Richard Crafts.

1554
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:02,840
Yeah.

1555
01:05:02,840 --> 01:05:03,800
He will have his own.

1556
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:05,000
Well now he does.

1557
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,400
Crafts sold a bunch of that stuff.

1558
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:07,320
Yeah, that's true.

1559
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:08,320
Now he's number one.

1560
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:09,160
Right, right.

1561
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:10,000
Yeah.

1562
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,440
But it does keep going and going,

1563
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:12,920
and those are the ones that you know about

1564
01:05:12,920 --> 01:05:16,720
and that have been published and put in lists of Easter eggs.

1565
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:19,440
But there's one, you really gotta have an eagle eye

1566
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:21,280
to see some of the other ones

1567
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:23,600
that you might not know about.

1568
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:24,440
Yeah.

1569
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:27,360
So other deep Disney lore

1570
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:30,600
that is deep in the collector's fortress.

1571
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:32,160
If you look close, really near the Eddie,

1572
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:35,000
you can see the never installed Hillary robot.

1573
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:35,840
Yeah.

1574
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:36,680
Yeah.

1575
01:05:36,680 --> 01:05:37,520
Yeah.

1576
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:38,360
Yeah.

1577
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:39,200
Yeah.

1578
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:40,040
Yeah.

1579
01:05:40,040 --> 01:05:40,880
Yeah.

1580
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:41,720
Yeah.

1581
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:42,760
We're almost done.

1582
01:05:42,760 --> 01:05:44,320
Just had one hand to go.

1583
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:48,080
Pretty sure about it.

1584
01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:48,920
Yeah.

1585
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:50,760
These are kind of,

1586
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:54,320
you can see these kind of all over the place in the queue.

1587
01:05:54,320 --> 01:05:58,480
There's a bunch of crates of unsold Lasseter wine.

1588
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:06,280
Terribly wanted today.

1589
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:09,480
There's even this stuff on the desk,

1590
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:11,280
on the collector's desk,

1591
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:13,800
like for instance, you can actually see the shredded plans

1592
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:15,400
for the Avengers E-ticket.

1593
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:17,640
Yeah.

1594
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:21,360
Don't need that anymore.

1595
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:22,200
Yeah.

1596
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:24,080
And elsewhere, if you look close,

1597
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:27,200
this is kind of a recent edition.

1598
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:30,920
They actually kept the secret memo for billionaires only

1599
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:33,920
where Robert Iger got the early tip that COVID was coming.

1600
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:36,920
You're Mr. Iger, quit now,

1601
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:39,560
from the secret billionaire society.

1602
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:41,720
Nice letterhead, lets you know what it is.

1603
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:44,560
And this is some of the,

1604
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:45,800
a lot of this is more recent stuff,

1605
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:47,240
but they nodded the past two

1606
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:49,280
because we love the classic stuff.

1607
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:53,800
And that's why they kept Walt's strike settling going.

1608
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:54,640
Yeah.

1609
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:55,480
Yeah.

1610
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:56,320
Yeah.

1611
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:57,160
Yeah.

1612
01:06:57,160 --> 01:06:58,000
Yeah.

1613
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:58,840
Yeah.

1614
01:06:58,840 --> 01:06:59,680
Yeah.

1615
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:00,520
Yeah.

1616
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:01,360
Yeah.

1617
01:07:01,360 --> 01:07:02,200
Yeah.

1618
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:03,040
Yeah.

1619
01:07:03,040 --> 01:07:03,880
Yeah.

1620
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:09,800
Break the glass, it's happening again.

1621
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:17,560
So keep an eye out for those the next time you go.

1622
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:18,840
Yeah.

1623
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:19,680
Look close.

1624
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,480
You know, you get through all of this stuff

1625
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:28,960
and you get closer and closer to the office.

1626
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:32,560
And this is where I should reiterate

1627
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:36,680
until recently, this ride scared the hell out of me.

1628
01:07:36,680 --> 01:07:39,640
I was not doing it for a long time.

1629
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:44,040
And finally, with some courage and alcohol as well,

1630
01:07:44,040 --> 01:07:46,440
I began doing it.

1631
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:47,840
Alcohol is a coping mechanism.

1632
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:48,760
That's a good thing, right?

1633
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:49,600
Yeah.

1634
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:50,440
Yeah.

1635
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:53,200
Healthy.

1636
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:57,040
But I should say, I still,

1637
01:07:57,040 --> 01:08:00,000
this is like as far as I go in terms of thrills

1638
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:03,400
and I'm still really unnerved throughout.

1639
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:06,200
But like that like engine room,

1640
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:08,560
I'm so edgy during,

1641
01:08:08,560 --> 01:08:11,280
you guys have been with me in that.

1642
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:12,360
Aaron, my wife has a bunch of times.

1643
01:08:12,360 --> 01:08:13,200
I'm like different.

1644
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:14,760
I'm a little like cagey.

1645
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:16,080
Like don't talk to me.

1646
01:08:17,080 --> 01:08:18,320
Let me process this.

1647
01:08:18,320 --> 01:08:19,360
And then I hear the ding

1648
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:21,240
and I'm not excited about the ding.

1649
01:08:22,760 --> 01:08:23,760
Like I'm going to do it.

1650
01:08:23,760 --> 01:08:24,600
I will do it.

1651
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:26,280
And I'll be happy that I have done it.

1652
01:08:26,280 --> 01:08:28,800
But as of right now, I don't feel great.

1653
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:30,680
But it hasn't gotten easier.

1654
01:08:30,680 --> 01:08:31,640
A little bit easier.

1655
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:33,360
Because I know that it's fun.

1656
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:38,000
I have now started to accept that it is really fun.

1657
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,080
And I mean, in a way, maybe more fun.

1658
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:41,920
Splash Mountain, which I overcame

1659
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:44,880
with the help of Figman's daddy himself.

1660
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:47,000
That's still, I think the,

1661
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,320
I think the earnest special still looms too large.

1662
01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:50,640
The special where Ernest was,

1663
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:54,480
if I, if Ernest was scared on the guardians ride,

1664
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:56,000
I don't know if I'd ever get over it.

1665
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:56,840
Yeah.

1666
01:08:56,840 --> 01:08:58,280
I'm not fighting that.

1667
01:08:58,280 --> 01:08:59,560
Well, I've said this before.

1668
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:03,600
I went on it, guys, a couple of years ago with my friend.

1669
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:06,680
And we went on it five times in a row.

1670
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:10,400
And I think that if there's a way to get over it,

1671
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:11,720
that's the way maybe you should do it.

1672
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:13,240
Although I guess with the new

1673
01:09:13,240 --> 01:09:15,480
like lightning lane stuff, it's impossible.

1674
01:09:15,480 --> 01:09:17,200
Because we were doing fast pass,

1675
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:18,560
whatever the hell it used to be called.

1676
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:21,680
And it was like grabbing it in line.

1677
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:22,520
Oh my God.

1678
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:23,640
Do you remember those days?

1679
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:26,800
It's hard to so long ago.

1680
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:28,400
This is your glory days.

1681
01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:30,560
You can just check.

1682
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:32,440
I'm going soon with a person from out of town.

1683
01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:34,320
I am lost.

1684
01:09:34,320 --> 01:09:35,400
I don't know what to do.

1685
01:09:35,400 --> 01:09:36,520
I don't know how to do it.

1686
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:40,080
It's so confusing what to do and what to buy and what to go.

1687
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:44,400
I used to be Batman and now I'm not Batman.

1688
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:48,800
Just some idiot watching the Riddler's Twitch stream.

1689
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:51,560
You're a lurker.

1690
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:52,400
Yeah.

1691
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:53,360
Thanks for the bits.

1692
01:09:57,800 --> 01:10:01,520
I mean, if we missed anything pre-Ryman,

1693
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:03,320
I think we sort of covered the,

1694
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:04,160
I don't know if you know this,

1695
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:06,600
this whole thing where the hands don't scan.

1696
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:07,440
Yeah.

1697
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:08,520
Which we like.

1698
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:13,040
Do his hands not scan because he's a raccoon.

1699
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:16,440
And that is why, as opposed to that they like

1700
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:17,840
put them on a list.

1701
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:20,720
Like if your credit card bounced.

1702
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:24,000
Well, I thought it was that like the guests

1703
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:27,040
had been bioscanning, like put in the system.

1704
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:29,440
Like when you go to an art museum,

1705
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:32,920
they give you that little metal thing you clip on your shirt.

1706
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:35,320
Yeah.

1707
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:37,040
I wouldn't know anything about art museums.

1708
01:10:38,240 --> 01:10:39,520
Sorry.

1709
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:42,240
Pinkies, my pinkies were up for that one.

1710
01:10:42,240 --> 01:10:44,240
Someone's wearing a blazer on stage.

1711
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:45,080
I am.

1712
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:50,080
But with Popeye and all the...

1713
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:51,840
Was it Popeye's shirt he's wearing?

1714
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:52,840
Yeah.

1715
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:54,800
I haggled down on Depop for this

1716
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:56,600
Islands of Adventure Popeye shirt.

1717
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:59,440
Jason and I wearing our favorite IPs.

1718
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:01,360
Ninja Turtles, Popeye.

1719
01:11:02,680 --> 01:11:03,520
I kind of am too.

1720
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:04,360
I'm in a Hawaiian shirt.

1721
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:06,240
My IP is Mike Love.

1722
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:11,160
Universally beloved.

1723
01:11:12,280 --> 01:11:13,120
Mike Love.

1724
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:16,480
So, well let's...

1725
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:17,960
The Rocket animatronic.

1726
01:11:17,960 --> 01:11:18,800
Oh, yeah.

1727
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:19,640
The greatest.

1728
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:20,480
Yeah.

1729
01:11:20,840 --> 01:11:22,680
Undeniable.

1730
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:24,600
He hits his little head on the pipe.

1731
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:25,520
He hits his little head.

1732
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:27,240
You see his little tail move around.

1733
01:11:27,240 --> 01:11:29,640
And if he's not working for some reason,

1734
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:31,200
there's a little video.

1735
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:32,040
I don't mind that.

1736
01:11:32,040 --> 01:11:32,880
I mean, the video's okay.

1737
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:33,960
You know, they got to play on video.

1738
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:36,040
The video's okay, but it's so disappointing

1739
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:36,880
when the video plays.

1740
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:37,720
Yeah.

1741
01:11:37,720 --> 01:11:39,120
Cause like you want to see him fall.

1742
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:40,600
Cause he falls out of a vent.

1743
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:42,600
He doesn't really, but they make it look like that.

1744
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:43,960
And he like, he's...

1745
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:47,240
Well, it's possible they dropped the robot out of a vent.

1746
01:11:47,240 --> 01:11:49,160
Sorry, sorry.

1747
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:50,800
Why are you ruining this?

1748
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:51,640
I'm sorry.

1749
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:53,280
I didn't know if you knew that.

1750
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:55,640
Theme parks have illusions?

1751
01:11:55,640 --> 01:11:58,960
His little paws, maybe that's why his hands don't scan.

1752
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:00,480
Cause they're really more like paws.

1753
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:01,880
They are paws.

1754
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:05,120
They have little paws grabs the Walkman on the way out too.

1755
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:06,960
Setting up the like start of the ride.

1756
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:09,760
It's maybe it's as good as the ride itself.

1757
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:11,400
That pre-show.

1758
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:15,200
I would just go to see that and him grab the thing and...

1759
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:18,640
Excuse me, coming through and trying to get out.

1760
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:21,280
Pardon.

1761
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:23,080
I saw the Walkman grab and I'm out of here.

1762
01:12:23,080 --> 01:12:24,400
I saw the Walkman grab.

1763
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:25,800
That's enough for me.

1764
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:27,720
There's different, there's different in the...

1765
01:12:27,720 --> 01:12:28,600
Cause there's two rooms.

1766
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:31,400
There's two like loading rooms or two pre-show rooms.

1767
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:33,760
There's different stuff in each room as well.

1768
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:35,000
There's different artifacts.

1769
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,720
And like Colson's gun is in one of the rooms.

1770
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:41,960
Agent Colson, Clark Gregg, married to what?

1771
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:42,800
Jennifer...

1772
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:43,640
Gray.

1773
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:45,120
I was gonna say Jennifer Beals.

1774
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:46,400
Jennifer Gray, thank you.

1775
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:50,640
Clark Gregg's character has a big gun in the Avengers

1776
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:52,360
and the big gun, Scott,

1777
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:55,840
is in one of the rooms.

1778
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:58,080
And I get excited when I get the big gun room.

1779
01:12:59,480 --> 01:13:02,760
There's also like stationary with a little memo on it

1780
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:07,240
from XS Tech, the fake company from Alien and Counter.

1781
01:13:07,240 --> 01:13:08,080
Yes, very good.

1782
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:10,280
Again, he's a big parks collector.

1783
01:13:10,280 --> 01:13:12,360
He loves Alien and Counter.

1784
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:13,200
We should fast forward.

1785
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:18,200
Also the painting of Goldblum and Benicio is really good.

1786
01:13:18,760 --> 01:13:19,600
With their plan.

1787
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:20,440
I don't think I know about that.

1788
01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:21,480
It's what?

1789
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:23,040
It's outside when you walk by it.

1790
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:24,000
In between.

1791
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:26,680
Jason, can you bring that up on the phone?

1792
01:13:26,680 --> 01:13:27,520
In between.

1793
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:28,360
In between the...

1794
01:13:28,360 --> 01:13:29,320
Bring that up on your phone.

1795
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:30,160
Okay.

1796
01:13:30,160 --> 01:13:32,080
You have to have seen this.

1797
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:33,280
No, I have not.

1798
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:34,120
What?

1799
01:13:35,320 --> 01:13:38,440
It's the Grandmaster from Thor Ragnarok.

1800
01:13:38,440 --> 01:13:39,280
And he's playing...

1801
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:40,720
He was mentally skipping this cue.

1802
01:13:40,720 --> 01:13:41,560
No, no.

1803
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:43,080
And then there's all these helmets,

1804
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:46,200
all these very Kirby style like helmet stuff or face,

1805
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:47,040
whatever you call them.

1806
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:47,880
Celestials.

1807
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:49,000
Celestials, thank you, Jason.

1808
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,200
And I love...

1809
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:52,920
Why is Jason pulling it up and not you?

1810
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:55,480
Because I have control of this iPad

1811
01:13:55,480 --> 01:13:56,880
and it's very delicate.

1812
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:59,480
The whole show could fall apart if I go surf the web.

1813
01:14:01,160 --> 01:14:02,800
All right.

1814
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:04,120
These fine people came up.

1815
01:14:04,120 --> 01:14:05,720
They don't even wanna see a professional show.

1816
01:14:05,720 --> 01:14:08,440
They came out to see a guy hold his phone up

1817
01:14:08,440 --> 01:14:10,440
to another guy and the other guy to go, oh.

1818
01:14:10,440 --> 01:14:11,280
I was at least...

1819
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:16,280
They're on the edge of their seats.

1820
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:24,720
Thanks for your tickets.

1821
01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:26,600
But I love being in the room.

1822
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:27,960
I am very, at this point,

1823
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:30,080
I've seen the show so many times

1824
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:32,160
that I really try to get out of the way of people

1825
01:14:32,160 --> 01:14:34,040
because it's a very tight squeeze.

1826
01:14:34,040 --> 01:14:35,560
And I feel that oftentimes like,

1827
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:39,000
if I'm not paying attention, I am blocking a child.

1828
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:40,880
And I try my best to get in the back,

1829
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:44,440
but also that strategically is, you people know,

1830
01:14:44,440 --> 01:14:46,840
you gotta get out first so you get on the ride quicker.

1831
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:47,680
Yeah.

1832
01:14:47,680 --> 01:14:48,520
See, you still...

1833
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:50,600
Because those are the things you can teach your friend.

1834
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:53,880
Like that haunted mansion dash.

1835
01:14:53,880 --> 01:14:55,480
Like, no, no, no, don't enjoy it or look at anything.

1836
01:14:55,480 --> 01:14:57,480
Go right to the door that is open first.

1837
01:14:57,480 --> 01:14:58,680
Yeah.

1838
01:14:58,680 --> 01:15:00,840
Well, if it's a...

1839
01:15:02,360 --> 01:15:04,320
That's what being a theme park fan is.

1840
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:06,920
Here's the thing though.

1841
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:08,440
It's like his first time at Disneyland,

1842
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:10,720
so I want him to appreciate the cues.

1843
01:15:11,720 --> 01:15:12,560
Nice.

1844
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:17,120
That gets an ooh.

1845
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:17,960
Some reference.

1846
01:15:19,240 --> 01:15:20,400
Scott, here's the painting.

1847
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:22,400
They're playing some sort of cosmic board game.

1848
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:25,480
Goldblum's being a bad sport and knocking it off.

1849
01:15:25,480 --> 01:15:26,760
Have you seen that?

1850
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:27,600
No.

1851
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:29,720
And wait, wait, and show it to me one more time.

1852
01:15:29,720 --> 01:15:30,560
Oh.

1853
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:31,640
All right.

1854
01:15:31,640 --> 01:15:32,600
Great, got it.

1855
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:34,640
That legitimately blows my mind.

1856
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:35,480
Yeah, I've seen him on this thing.

1857
01:15:35,480 --> 01:15:36,720
Wow, interesting.

1858
01:15:36,720 --> 01:15:39,000
You must be in such panic.

1859
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:39,840
Yes, yeah, yeah.

1860
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:41,680
You can't talk about it, look at it on the ground,

1861
01:15:41,680 --> 01:15:43,440
think about my life, take it all in

1862
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:44,520
in case things don't work out.

1863
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:46,040
And then there's me next to you,

1864
01:15:46,040 --> 01:15:49,320
like the Buddha under the Bodhi tree, a total piece.

1865
01:15:53,320 --> 01:15:54,560
We do have to talk about this, right?

1866
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:56,040
We are losing valuable minutes.

1867
01:15:56,040 --> 01:15:57,640
Yeah, that's true, yes.

1868
01:15:57,640 --> 01:16:00,280
So to talk about, I mean, where to start?

1869
01:16:00,280 --> 01:16:04,120
I mean, a big thing that we have to talk about is songs,

1870
01:16:04,120 --> 01:16:08,440
and that is a very fun facet of this attraction.

1871
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:11,520
Why don't I just like, I'm curious if there's a favorite.

1872
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:13,480
So I'm gonna say them really quick.

1873
01:16:13,480 --> 01:16:16,560
And if you know your favorite, I'll just wait for it.

1874
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:19,560
Hopefully you have it locked and loaded already.

1875
01:16:19,560 --> 01:16:22,600
Okay, favorites, in terms of, and it could be song,

1876
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:25,240
but it could also be like, oh, this is just a fun match

1877
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:27,240
with the attraction and a good amount of drops

1878
01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:29,640
and chaos, something about the chemistry.

1879
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:34,360
All right, we got Steppenwolf, Born to be Wild.

1880
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:35,200
Really, wow.

1881
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:36,040
It's a pretty good one.

1882
01:16:36,040 --> 01:16:36,880
I like it.

1883
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:37,720
Nothing there.

1884
01:16:37,720 --> 01:16:38,560
They're right.

1885
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:39,400
Yeah, yeah.

1886
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:42,080
It's not the best.

1887
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:43,680
I was rolling my eyes at Steppenwolf.

1888
01:16:43,680 --> 01:16:44,680
I was like, is there anything interesting

1889
01:16:44,680 --> 01:16:45,520
about Steppenwolf?

1890
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:47,520
And I found out the writer of that song,

1891
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:51,880
his name, man, is Mars Bonfire.

1892
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:54,200
Wow, really?

1893
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:57,640
Yes, the writer of the song in Steppenwolf.

1894
01:16:57,640 --> 01:16:59,440
Real name, Dennis Edmonton.

1895
01:17:01,680 --> 01:17:02,600
That's about right.

1896
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:05,120
Okay, what about Jackson Five, I Want You Back?

1897
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:05,960
Yeah.

1898
01:17:05,960 --> 01:17:06,800
Yeah.

1899
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:07,640
Solid candidate.

1900
01:17:07,640 --> 01:17:08,480
Yeah.

1901
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:10,400
Elvis Presley, Burning Love.

1902
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:11,240
Oh, yeah.

1903
01:17:11,240 --> 01:17:13,880
Not really, okay, yeah, I'm gonna agree with that one.

1904
01:17:13,880 --> 01:17:16,480
Edgar Winter, Group Freeride.

1905
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:17,320
Yeah.

1906
01:17:19,320 --> 01:17:20,680
That one's mine, I'm gonna say.

1907
01:17:20,680 --> 01:17:22,200
Parliament, Give Up the Funk.

1908
01:17:22,200 --> 01:17:24,640
Yeah, and I think that's up there.

1909
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:27,160
And Pat Benatar, Hit Me With Your Best Shot.

1910
01:17:29,160 --> 01:17:32,480
I was like, was it between Benatar and I Want You Back,

1911
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:33,320
potentially?

1912
01:17:33,320 --> 01:17:34,160
Yeah, I think it was.

1913
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:36,600
Edgar Winter did good, too.

1914
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:38,960
Edgar Winter did do well, congrats.

1915
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:42,160
He always did, with everything, with looking cool.

1916
01:17:42,160 --> 01:17:43,200
I thought Elvis didn't get,

1917
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:44,600
I think Burning Love is more fun

1918
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:45,840
than the audience gave him credit for.

1919
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:49,120
That surprises me, because I forget it's there.

1920
01:17:49,120 --> 01:17:49,960
Yeah.

1921
01:17:49,960 --> 01:17:50,780
It seems like-

1922
01:17:50,780 --> 01:17:52,560
This doesn't match with some of the others, in a way.

1923
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:53,400
Yeah.

1924
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:54,400
Do we, I mean, I know this is the,

1925
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:59,400
this is not about the overlay, but just out of curiosity,

1926
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:01,720
who thinks Monsters After Dark is the best one?

1927
01:18:01,720 --> 01:18:02,560
Yeah, it is.

1928
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:07,160
This is, okay, well, Monsters After Dark, really quick.

1929
01:18:07,160 --> 01:18:08,720
This came up on the show for a second.

1930
01:18:08,720 --> 01:18:10,960
That was the last step for me,

1931
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:13,400
because I knew it was, at least I thought it was

1932
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:16,360
a more intense drop pattern, I'm not totally sure if it is.

1933
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:20,400
But I was really edgy that day.

1934
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:21,680
Griffin Newman was with us,

1935
01:18:21,680 --> 01:18:23,480
ex-NLPTL legend, Griffin Newman.

1936
01:18:23,480 --> 01:18:24,320
There you go.

1937
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:27,160
Try that, Griffin.

1938
01:18:27,160 --> 01:18:30,320
And I, you know, I was like,

1939
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:33,600
he brought up later, you were pretty edgy,

1940
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:36,080
and I think the reason I was edgy is because of the way

1941
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:40,360
that the experience and the song were built up by you, Mike.

1942
01:18:40,360 --> 01:18:43,240
Because I feel like you had described it,

1943
01:18:43,240 --> 01:18:45,800
and maybe I was projecting it, and I'm scared anyway,

1944
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:50,400
but I was imagining the most intense black metal,

1945
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:52,280
like, math music.

1946
01:18:54,280 --> 01:18:55,120
Double bass drum.

1947
01:18:55,120 --> 01:18:56,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.

1948
01:18:56,120 --> 01:18:57,440
Yeah, yeah, all the gear.

1949
01:18:58,200 --> 01:19:01,360
It's where I thought the song was going to be so terrifying

1950
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:03,400
and make it just kind of an agonizing.

1951
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:04,640
The scariest song ever.

1952
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:06,560
That's somehow, I feel like there was something

1953
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:08,400
that you said that made me think that,

1954
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:11,160
and I guess this is my fault for how I processed it.

1955
01:19:11,160 --> 01:19:13,640
But then getting on it and then hearing,

1956
01:19:13,640 --> 01:19:17,160
monsters after dark, monsters after dark.

1957
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:20,920
Well, hold on, Al, hold on, it's very loud, I'll say that.

1958
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:23,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that might be what you were referring to.

1959
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:26,440
Were you just terrified at the concept of like,

1960
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:28,520
this ride takes place chronologically

1961
01:19:28,520 --> 01:19:30,680
after the normal version of this ride?

1962
01:19:30,680 --> 01:19:31,520
Yeah.

1963
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:34,960
Hoggle by the timeline.

1964
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:37,600
Monsters after dark, I really like that the,

1965
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:39,680
you know, the cast members wear like,

1966
01:19:39,680 --> 01:19:41,840
fucked up versions of their normal uniform.

1967
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:44,840
There's like burn marks and like holes,

1968
01:19:44,840 --> 01:19:47,600
and some people really get into it.

1969
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:50,040
And like, I saw a video online where like,

1970
01:19:50,040 --> 01:19:54,240
the guy at the end like bursts in screaming to unload you.

1971
01:19:55,080 --> 01:19:58,600
And the whole car like jumped, and I was like,

1972
01:19:58,600 --> 01:20:01,400
ah yeah, you gotta, I mean that seems really fun.

1973
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:04,440
It's looked at, yeah, all that stuff is really great,

1974
01:20:04,440 --> 01:20:07,040
and it's gonna be in its own episode.

1975
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:07,880
Yeah!

1976
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:14,120
Probably for the best, yeah, we gotta move here.

1977
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:15,720
Some of the theater's gonna shut down.

1978
01:20:15,720 --> 01:20:19,600
So, well, we should talk about, well, I don't know,

1979
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:20,520
Mike, you take it.

1980
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:22,840
Yeah, well, I mean, the only thing I would say is like,

1981
01:20:22,840 --> 01:20:25,320
on the RipRide Rocket at Universal,

1982
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:27,760
they have like songs, and they have secret songs,

1983
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:29,880
which is really exciting to me.

1984
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:31,200
There's, I forget how you do it.

1985
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:32,480
You have to punch in something on the screen

1986
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:34,800
to get different secret songs.

1987
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:35,640
Is that how it works, Jason?

1988
01:20:35,640 --> 01:20:38,840
Yeah, and if you punch in a really secret code,

1989
01:20:38,840 --> 01:20:42,480
it'll just stop on that lift hill for hours at a time.

1990
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:45,400
If you spill soda on it or something.

1991
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:46,240
Yeah.

1992
01:20:46,240 --> 01:20:47,060
All right, let me scoot.

1993
01:20:47,060 --> 01:20:50,800
So, people don't know there's also a secret menu of songs

1994
01:20:50,840 --> 01:20:54,560
for this ride, too.

1995
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:57,880
And I'm gonna zoom through some slides of Mr. Tom Morrow.

1996
01:20:59,360 --> 01:21:00,320
We don't have time.

1997
01:21:01,640 --> 01:21:03,920
More Tom Morrow content coming soon.

1998
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:05,760
So, yeah, so here's some of the secret.

1999
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:10,040
My dear friends, this is the moment you have been waiting

2000
01:21:10,040 --> 01:21:10,880
for.

2001
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:15,880
Rock it on Pro-Tunes and start Games Rock!

2002
01:21:15,880 --> 01:21:18,880
I'm a rube, Jamaica, blue llama.

2003
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:23,880
Take it, I'm gonna get up, come on, come on, come on.

2004
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:26,160
Uh, here you go.

2005
01:21:26,160 --> 01:21:27,000
I like you.

2006
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,160
My dear friends.

2007
01:21:28,160 --> 01:21:29,720
So, yeah, there's a lot of them, actually.

2008
01:21:29,720 --> 01:21:31,000
We're doing six of them.

2009
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:36,000
Rock it on Pro-Tunes and start Games Rock!

2010
01:21:36,920 --> 01:21:38,240
Oppa Gangnam Style.

2011
01:21:38,240 --> 01:21:39,240
Oppa Gangnam Style.

2012
01:21:39,240 --> 01:21:40,240
Oppa Gangnam Style.

2013
01:21:40,240 --> 01:21:41,240
Oppa Gangnam Style.

2014
01:21:41,240 --> 01:21:42,240
Oppa Gangnam Style.

2015
01:21:42,240 --> 01:21:43,240
Oppa Gangnam Style.

2016
01:21:43,240 --> 01:21:44,240
Oppa Gangnam Style.

2017
01:21:44,240 --> 01:21:45,240
Oppa Gangnam Style.

2018
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:46,400
Gangnam Style.

2019
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:49,400
Gangnam Style.

2020
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:50,400
Pretty fun.

2021
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:52,960
Yeah, you do like all this thing.

2022
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:54,040
Jason, can you do it?

2023
01:21:54,040 --> 01:21:55,400
No, I don't want to do it.

2024
01:21:57,680 --> 01:21:58,680
Just a little, though.

2025
01:21:58,680 --> 01:21:59,680
Just a little, like, cause I.

2026
01:21:59,680 --> 01:22:00,680
One of them.

2027
01:22:00,680 --> 01:22:02,920
He does this, like, horse thing.

2028
01:22:02,920 --> 01:22:04,360
Do they have to ride?

2029
01:22:04,360 --> 01:22:05,200
What's that?

2030
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:06,200
What are you doing?

2031
01:22:06,200 --> 01:22:07,600
He does, like, a horse thing.

2032
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:08,600
That's a horse thing?

2033
01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:10,960
He does, like, after the one horse thing,

2034
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:12,960
he, like, kicks to the side.

2035
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:15,760
That was something from the 20s.

2036
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:16,760
I'm going to blame that.

2037
01:22:18,520 --> 01:22:21,520
I'm going to blame that on my bum, like, ugh.

2038
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:31,920
My dear friends, this is the Pro-Tunes and start Games Rock!

2039
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:42,880
This is also called Monsters After Dark.

2040
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:51,280
Here we go.

2041
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:56,840
How excited would you be if that played?

2042
01:22:56,840 --> 01:22:59,840
No one would scream or anything.

2043
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:00,840
No one would be lying.

2044
01:23:00,840 --> 01:23:02,840
I've been waiting for this.

2045
01:23:02,840 --> 01:23:07,840
The rocket on Pro-Tunes and start Games Rock!

2046
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:18,640
I hurt myself today to see if I still feel.

2047
01:23:18,640 --> 01:23:22,240
I focus on the pain.

2048
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:24,120
Just a solemn ride.

2049
01:23:24,120 --> 01:23:29,520
The only thing that's real.

2050
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:30,720
It usually makes you laugh.

2051
01:23:30,720 --> 01:23:32,720
That one makes you cry.

2052
01:23:32,720 --> 01:23:34,400
The needle tears a hole.

2053
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:36,400
That old familiar sting.

2054
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:41,400
People might not know this one, so you have to listen closely.

2055
01:23:41,400 --> 01:23:48,400
The rocket on Pro-Tunes and start Games Rock!

2056
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:55,400
The blast is slow, low is high, stop is go, and that is why every second Wednesday is a curtain.

2057
01:23:55,400 --> 01:24:00,200
From 8 to 9, all is well, then I rule over all my shell and all, because the world is

2058
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:01,200
turning turtle.

2059
01:24:01,200 --> 01:24:02,200
Turtle.

2060
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:03,200
No!

2061
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:09,480
It's our favorite picture top V from Mary Poppins Returns.

2062
01:24:09,480 --> 01:24:14,360
This is saying something, this is saying something, might be my least favorite runner.

2063
01:24:14,360 --> 01:24:15,800
Might be number one with a...

2064
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:17,800
Well, wait, Scott, how about this runner?

2065
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:20,800
No, no, no, I asked for it!

2066
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:26,800
My dear friends, this is the moment you have been waiting for.

2067
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:31,800
The rocket on Pro-Tunes and start Games Rock!

2068
01:24:37,800 --> 01:24:43,800
I think if you could become fully aware of what existed in the cigar store next door

2069
01:24:43,800 --> 01:24:46,800
to this restaurant, I think it would just blow your brains out.

2070
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:51,800
To have a real relationship with a person that goes on for years, well, that's completely

2071
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:52,800
unpredictable.

2072
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:55,800
See, that's why I think people have affairs.

2073
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:01,800
Andre Gregor, Iguana, Sean, folks.

2074
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:02,800
Okay.

2075
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:04,800
A great film.

2076
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:09,800
When I was younger, I used to care about art and music, and now I'm 36 and I only care

2077
01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:11,800
about hand scanning.

2078
01:25:11,800 --> 01:25:16,800
That's a smart joke.

2079
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:19,800
Topical, it's a meme going around, folks.

2080
01:25:19,800 --> 01:25:20,800
You said it.

2081
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:28,800
Well, geez, I mean, we've been blasting through this and our time is winding down already

2082
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:31,800
in typical fashion where the ride has barely been discussed.

2083
01:25:31,800 --> 01:25:34,800
Anything else we want to throw out?

2084
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:38,800
You know, I like everything that happens on it.

2085
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:42,800
All the little tableaus are a lot of fun, very confusing.

2086
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:46,800
They're like little TikToks.

2087
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:48,800
It's a tower of TikToks.

2088
01:25:51,800 --> 01:25:55,800
There's funny Batista stuff, like two of the ride profiles.

2089
01:25:55,800 --> 01:26:00,800
He jumps out of the monster's mouth and punches it in the face and goes, you're welcome.

2090
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:05,800
And then at the end, every version at the end when you're going back into, because you

2091
01:26:05,800 --> 01:26:10,800
have to go backwards into the elevator shaft, and then when you're resetting at the very

2092
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:13,800
end, he goes, why are you thanking them?

2093
01:26:13,800 --> 01:26:15,800
They didn't do anything.

2094
01:26:15,800 --> 01:26:16,800
Beat it all the fighting.

2095
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:17,800
It's really quiet.

2096
01:26:17,800 --> 01:26:18,800
It's kind of quiet.

2097
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:21,800
Not really quiet, but kind of quiet, and you can easily miss it, but it is funny.

2098
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:24,800
And he is very funny in those movies.

2099
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:28,800
All the video things are pretty fun.

2100
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:34,800
At the end, you get to see Cosmo has been freed, which is so, so satisfying.

2101
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:40,800
As a dog lover of myself, you see the dog has been freed and they're getting in the ship.

2102
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:43,800
Ladies and gentlemen, Edwin.

2103
01:26:43,800 --> 01:26:46,800
I wish if that was possible.

2104
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:50,800
He humps the shit out of my leg.

2105
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:54,800
Everyone starts going wild.

2106
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:57,800
Pony, pony plays.

2107
01:26:57,800 --> 01:27:00,800
Bounce, bounce, bounce.

2108
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:05,800
As you're walking out, and I've never caught this, but as you're walking out, you can hear the

2109
01:27:05,800 --> 01:27:10,800
collector yelling, and apparently sometimes you can listen and you can hear Howard the Duck

2110
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:13,800
making fun of him, which I think is great.

2111
01:27:13,800 --> 01:27:19,800
They used to sell stuffed Howard the Duck and stuffed Cosmo in the exit.

2112
01:27:19,800 --> 01:27:26,800
They should bring that back, and we need more Howard the Duck based content.

2113
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:30,800
He's on What If, and it's Seth Green. Is that all correct?

2114
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:31,800
Yeah, all right.

2115
01:27:31,800 --> 01:27:35,800
So those websites were correct.

2116
01:27:35,800 --> 01:27:39,800
And then the last thing I'll say, I've said it before, I think on the show, is that at this point now I'm

2117
01:27:39,800 --> 01:27:44,800
spoiled from the actual ride itself on Guardians that when I go on Tower in Orlando, the ride

2118
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:46,800
itself feels empty.

2119
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:51,800
I feel it's not as fun because it's just dark up and down and there's no soundtrack.

2120
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:52,800
There's nothing happening.

2121
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:56,800
Yeah, boo me all you want.

2122
01:27:56,800 --> 01:27:58,800
The Hannibal Burris gif, boo me.

2123
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:01,800
You know I'm right.

2124
01:28:01,800 --> 01:28:08,800
But they should now with all the towers, they should do, it doesn't have to be fun, but they should

2125
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:09,800
have music.

2126
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:10,800
It doesn't have to be fun.

2127
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:15,800
They should have music and effects as you go up and down.

2128
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:21,800
They should be opening the door and you see like Rod Serling or Burgess Meredith and he's

2129
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:25,800
his glasses are broken.

2130
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:27,800
Shatner, Shatner on the plane opens it up.

2131
01:28:27,800 --> 01:28:29,800
Shatner is pointing at you.

2132
01:28:29,800 --> 01:28:30,800
He's like, I see them.

2133
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:31,800
They're there.

2134
01:28:31,800 --> 01:28:32,800
On the outside of this.

2135
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:33,800
Yeah.

2136
01:28:33,800 --> 01:28:38,800
So do deep fake Burgess Meredith or young Shatner.

2137
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:42,800
Oh, you're speaking my language now.

2138
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:44,800
All the all the famous episodes.

2139
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:45,800
You know, it is weird.

2140
01:28:45,800 --> 01:28:46,800
It's weird.

2141
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:52,800
I think that now like that this type of attraction, the Tower of Terror ever at any point was

2142
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:54,800
just one drop and that's the end.

2143
01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:55,800
Right.

2144
01:28:55,800 --> 01:29:00,800
Like like the multiple drops in the up and down in the back and forth is so clearly so

2145
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:01,800
much of the experience.

2146
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:03,800
And this thing is just so it's so chaotic.

2147
01:29:03,800 --> 01:29:06,800
You don't know what's going to happen when a door opens.

2148
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:07,800
You don't know where you're going to be.

2149
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:08,800
It's it's it's a blast.

2150
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:10,800
They did a great job with it.

2151
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:14,800
They overcame like everything, everything slate thought and everything we all thought.

2152
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:17,800
I think it's just such a great fun experience.

2153
01:29:17,800 --> 01:29:20,800
Yeah, it's maybe my favorite ride at Disneyland.

2154
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:22,800
Oh, that's an applause.

2155
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:25,800
I was going to ask for and I know it was mixed and do we like that?

2156
01:29:25,800 --> 01:29:26,800
They did or not.

2157
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:29,800
But are there people here who would say favorite ride?

2158
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:31,800
Wow.

2159
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:32,800
Yeah.

2160
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:33,800
All right.

2161
01:29:33,800 --> 01:29:34,800
I'm sorry.

2162
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:36,800
I wish I had a class of your choice.

2163
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:37,800
What's class?

2164
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:39,800
Great moments with Mr.

2165
01:29:39,800 --> 01:29:41,800
Lincoln.

2166
01:29:41,800 --> 01:29:42,800
Yeah.

2167
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:46,800
Thing where you learn.

2168
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:47,800
We are.

2169
01:29:47,800 --> 01:29:50,800
You know, we also have a mention is that Disneyland?

2170
01:29:50,800 --> 01:29:51,800
That's great.

2171
01:29:51,800 --> 01:29:52,800
See, that's what I was thinking.

2172
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:53,800
Like Rocket.

2173
01:29:53,800 --> 01:29:57,800
So Rocket has knowledge of theme parks on Earth.

2174
01:29:57,800 --> 01:29:58,800
Yeah.

2175
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:02,800
But is he more of a casual fan and the collector is the big fan?

2176
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:10,800
It's still funny to think about Rocket going like I'm sick of universal screen rides.

2177
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:15,800
Seems like JPEG stepped in it again.

2178
01:30:15,800 --> 01:30:16,800
He has opinions.

2179
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:18,800
We know.

2180
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:25,800
So but that's that's sort of bringing us to the end of our time, except for one thing.

2181
01:30:25,800 --> 01:30:28,800
And I would call this a plus up.

2182
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:33,800
This is so you know, we talked about alternate music that they could do.

2183
01:30:33,800 --> 01:30:35,800
And I you know, it's it's classic rock.

2184
01:30:35,800 --> 01:30:36,800
Right.

2185
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:37,800
There's a lot of classic rock.

2186
01:30:37,800 --> 01:30:44,800
But you know what else is a classic already after just five years is this attraction is Guardians of the Galaxy Edition breakout.

2187
01:30:44,800 --> 01:30:51,800
Every bit of it, the lore, the info dumps, the pre shows, the complicated backstory.

2188
01:30:51,800 --> 01:30:52,800
It's already classic.

2189
01:30:52,800 --> 01:31:00,800
And I think that in the future, they could acknowledge it and own it and make their own mythology part of the experience and part of the music.

2190
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:04,800
And that is why we prepared a little something.

2191
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:11,800
Disney, if you're listening, first of all, sorry about all this stuff up until now.

2192
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:18,800
But besides that, you might want to consider throwing this this little ditty into the mix.

2193
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:21,800
All right. Here we go.

2194
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:32,800
Oh, yeah.

2195
01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:34,800
Tell you something.

2196
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:36,800
My hands, they do not.

2197
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:37,800
Yeah.

2198
01:31:37,800 --> 01:31:41,800
So I got a new plan.

2199
01:31:41,800 --> 01:31:45,800
They got to scan your hands.

2200
01:31:45,800 --> 01:31:49,800
They got to scan your hands.

2201
01:31:49,800 --> 01:31:52,800
They got to scan your hands.

2202
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:56,800
You see the collection.

2203
01:31:56,800 --> 01:31:59,800
And a little bit.

2204
01:31:59,800 --> 01:32:03,800
You need special clearance.

2205
01:32:03,800 --> 01:32:07,800
They got to scan your hands.

2206
01:32:07,800 --> 01:32:11,800
They got to scan your hands.

2207
01:32:11,800 --> 01:32:14,800
They got to scan your hands.

2208
01:32:14,800 --> 01:32:21,800
And when they scan you in the gantry, it's fine.

2209
01:32:21,800 --> 01:32:26,800
You'll get the clearance because your hands.

2210
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:28,800
They ain't mine.

2211
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:30,800
They ain't mine.

2212
01:32:30,800 --> 01:32:32,800
They ain't mine.

2213
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:34,800
Okay, everybody.

2214
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:36,800
Oh, yeah.

2215
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:38,800
Tell you something.

2216
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:41,800
My hands, they do not scan.

2217
01:32:41,800 --> 01:32:45,800
So I got a new plan.

2218
01:32:45,800 --> 01:32:49,800
They got to scan your hands.

2219
01:32:49,800 --> 01:32:53,800
They got to scan your hands.

2220
01:32:53,800 --> 01:32:56,800
They got to scan your hands.

2221
01:32:56,800 --> 01:33:00,800
They got to scan your hands.

2222
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:10,800
You survived.

2223
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:12,800
Barcaster Red Lines.

2224
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:14,800
Yes.

2225
01:33:17,800 --> 01:33:19,800
