1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,840
Forever...

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:03,340
Dog.

3
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,720
Please, hauntcast the fright.

4
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:54,940
Welcome to hauntcast the fright, a show hosted by two scaredy boys that are afraid of theme park Halloween mazes

5
00:00:54,940 --> 00:01:01,280
and one big brave boy who overcame his haunted maze fear at not scary farm last night.

6
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,320
I am said big brave boy, Mike Carlson.

7
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:08,260
Joining me as always, two scaredy boys, Jason Sheridan.

8
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,460
I had some excuses.

9
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:18,160
Alright, that's fine, we'll get into all of this, but I'm boasting hard up top here because I'm feeling very triumphant after my night at not scary farm.

10
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:20,500
And also Scott Gardner is here.

11
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:27,360
Dan scaredy, I got no excuses, but whatever. I'm my own man, I can do what I want to do.

12
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:36,900
I feel alive for one of the first times in my life, going through six mazes last night at not scary farm.

13
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,060
Can you believe that?

14
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:38,680
It's a lot.

15
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,860
And I'm not, this wasn't a fake thing that I was afraid of these mazes, I was just as scared as you guys were.

16
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:49,000
I don't like this, I don't like college students jumping out and putting their hands in my face.

17
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,300
You know, here's the thing.

18
00:01:50,640 --> 00:02:00,640
You might be correct to phrase it as scared, I could see that take, but there's another take that is I don't want to do this.

19
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:03,360
Even if I wasn't scared, it doesn't sound like pleasant.

20
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,920
I did a single maze, we will get into that.

21
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:13,000
I did it. I wouldn't describe my feeling during it as being scared, I'd describe it more as annoyed and irritated.

22
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,780
I'd rather be at home.

23
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:21,380
Well, I think that the thing is you've got to get used to the people throwing their arms at you and yelling.

24
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:31,360
And then once you get used to the mazes, then you start to enjoy all the things we like about theme parks, the theming, the design, all that interesting stuff, the effects.

25
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:34,760
I can get used to my couch and a bottle of wine.

26
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:37,940
That's a good excuse to not go anywhere then, isn't it?

27
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,200
That's better than anything, really.

28
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,220
It truly is.

29
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:43,880
Scott Gardner at 33.

30
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:47,100
Yeah, I mean that's fair. Why should we do anything?

31
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,120
Let's all just become drunks.

32
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,620
Let's not go nowhere.

33
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:54,340
Sounds like Scott's going down the Jackson Maine route.

34
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:57,200
I know he wants me to stop talking about A Star Is Born.

35
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,900
The jump to drunk from enjoying a glass of wine.

36
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:04,000
You were drunker than me. You were the drunk one at the event.

37
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,140
But last night?

38
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:08,160
Weren't you? You drank more than I did last night.

39
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:13,540
I had a mango beer and then I had a Stella Artois.

40
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,840
You're still drunk right now.

41
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:23,340
So listeners, what this episode, we're talking Halloween Horror Nights and Knott's Berry Farm.

42
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:27,220
This is not a comprehensive one.

43
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,020
There's a little peek behind the scenes.

44
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:33,160
We got some to look at how some of this stuff got made.

45
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,980
We've been saying for a long time that we were doing this podcast and we wanted invites to things.

46
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:44,820
We wanted people to invite us theme park journalists to different events, to different happenings.

47
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:48,800
And we wanted to get free things and we wanted to look backstage and peek behind the curtain.

48
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:55,140
And we've been very lucky now and we've gotten a couple cool things that we have gotten to do.

49
00:03:55,460 --> 00:04:01,580
Number one we're going to talk about here is that Universal invited one of us to go check out their new maze,

50
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:04,140
which is based on the TV show Stranger Things.

51
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:07,660
And we sent our cub reporter, Jason Sheridan.

52
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:13,440
My mother will be thrilled that I finally put the two years of an unfinished journalism degree to work.

53
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:13,940
Yes.

54
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,200
What was your college?

55
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:15,880
Press badge.

56
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:19,300
Well, I switched to TV production halfway through.

57
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:27,720
But you actually did like you would call from college, you would call like Hollywood people, like agents to get confirmation on stories for your local papers.

58
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:41,280
Like I did a like a long like 30 page feature for like an assignment where I like talk to the editors in chief at the time of only press and top shelf productions.

59
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,440
A couple journalists who cover what is top shelf.

60
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:49,780
They're like, yeah, you're comics publishers.

61
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,720
There was a thing you had to call an agent about.

62
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,880
Yes, there was.

63
00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:02,760
So this yeah, I was an intern at the Philadelphia Weekly, weekly news kind of Philadelphia is equivalent to like the village voice.

64
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:14,600
I was an intern there one summer and I had already changed my major, but I had already been offered the internship and they were just like, yeah, you know, any any work is as good as the neck.

65
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:23,960
I mean, like any internship at this point, I think it was coming out of my sophomore year and I was just kind of interested in doing something in the media that summer.

66
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:29,420
So I worked at Philadelphia Weekly and they I thought it was a very smart move.

67
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,000
The interns were mostly there.

68
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,180
There was like six to ten of us and we were the fact checkers.

69
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:42,140
We would fact check articles and call sources and double check stuff that was in the articles.

70
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:51,040
One thing that I had double check was there was they kind of in a way that didn't mesh with the rest of the paper.

71
00:05:51,060 --> 00:06:10,360
There were horror scopes that tried to weave in like gossip like us weekly kind of gossip to like, well, Taurus, you're you're in for a romantic week, much like who would have the star of like 2005 been like romantic couples.

72
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:20,680
So Vari, I drew Barrymore married to Drew Barrymore, Justin Long, just Drew Barrymore and Justin Long are an example of this, like that sort of thing.

73
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:31,520
And one of my one of the ones was that, you know, about Sandra Bullock and Jesse James.

74
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,760
Oh, right. So that's you called her agent.

75
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:38,720
So but what I found was like I was trying I asked the writer, like, where did you source this from?

76
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:45,120
And I found the article and the article was from that week, but the previous year.

77
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:51,800
So they fucked up and I told the editors and they're like, well, call Sandra Bullock's agent for comment.

78
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,120
And how old were you this time?

79
00:06:54,120 --> 00:07:11,300
I was 19 years old and at the time E, I don't think was on IMDb and we didn't have IMDb Pro, but E like E.com indexed the television network indexed like two rep what people.

80
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:15,940
So I called the main line for like either William Morris or CIA.

81
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:24,320
I got through to an assistant and I said, hey, I'm calling from the Philadelphia Weekly and they're like, oh, OK, well, let me put you on with the other available.

82
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:28,080
Let me ask. And I did the same. Hi, I'm calling from the Philadelphia Weekly.

83
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,140
We're a weekly paper in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

84
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,560
The person went, I know where Philadelphia is.

85
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,260
And I said, is there any truth to this?

86
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,180
And they're like, what? No.

87
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:40,900
Where are you? Where do you call?

88
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,940
And I was like, look, I'm just an inter.

89
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:47,580
I'm just fact check in a little pop culture part of the better.

90
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,540
There's no truth to that rumor.

91
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:54,260
So then whatever Libra or Taurus for that week did not have a pop culture.

92
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:58,120
They just stripped out that sentence that unregularly part.

93
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:04,740
Yes. So when we were deciding which the three of us should go, this is why I decided Jason should be the guy to do it.

94
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,360
He deals with Hollywood bigwigs all the time.

95
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:11,280
You're essentially you were a little like kid Ronan Farrow.

96
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:16,760
Yeah, I used to drive the American Gladiators.

97
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:19,460
So they drove one of them to their physical.

98
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,660
Like they flew in an American Gladiator to a reporter's job would be.

99
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:30,160
I don't know. I just talked about the interactions with stars.

100
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:34,160
It is a scoop, though, that one of the American Gladiators had some health issues.

101
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,900
It was illegal. It was just a basic physical before they could get in the arena.

102
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:47,040
They made it. OK. So you waited in like the waiting room for one of the Beverly Hills doctor and then drove them back to the airport.

103
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:50,660
American Gladiator was it? I don't know. They were a prick.

104
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,640
I don't want to talk about it.

105
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,960
Another glacier.

106
00:08:55,620 --> 00:09:00,620
This was like this was this was not one of the main ones and they were really weird.

107
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:09,600
And they leaned out of the car when like the police there was a lot of police at the airport and they're like, hey, this guy's up to no good about me driving.

108
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,540
And I'm like, I am not being paid dog shit.

109
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:16,980
Wow. I don't think I've actually heard the story of you driving an American Gladiator to a doctor's office.

110
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,700
Yeah, that's great. All right. Anyway, we got to go back to the universal.

111
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:25,200
Anyway, so, yeah, I went up there to tour the Stranger Things maze.

112
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:29,000
I got to go in at Walters Gate and get a little, you know, a badge.

113
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:34,320
You know, Walters Gate. It was like me and like 10 other outlets.

114
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,960
And, you know, they put us to talk to them. Who are they?

115
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:45,260
I know. It's one. It's a bumper car boys.

116
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:48,060
And it's like it's he looks exactly like you, but with a mustache.

117
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,720
I know I didn't. I don't know.

118
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:55,260
It was kind of like we all got there and they put us in a van and they got us in the toy was pretty quick.

119
00:09:55,380 --> 00:10:02,040
Or you got to go in a van to go from the like city walk down to the soundstage.

120
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:10,300
So because the so the Stranger Things maze this year is in soundstage stage 29, which is a huge soundstage.

121
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:18,900
They said it was used in like the Grinch and Jurassic Park when I was an intern at Universal on the back lot.

122
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:27,460
I just remember the tour guides going like and that soundstage was used in a movie we shot recently called Land of the Lost.

123
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:32,520
So this was it was huge. Probably used in Evan Almighty.

124
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,700
I feel like they were talking about Evan Almighty when I worked there.

125
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,060
There were a lot of like arc pieces.

126
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,740
That's my first summer.

127
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:43,360
Yeah, that was like two or three sound stages for that.

128
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,060
That was a real, real production endeavor.

129
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:48,780
And then also giant sets in North Carolina.

130
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:51,480
The most expensive comedy of all time.

131
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,020
Yeah. At the time.

132
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,180
Yeah, that worked out.

133
00:10:55,620 --> 00:11:04,100
The but so that this is interesting that they're universals really spreading onto the back lot.

134
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:09,020
If you don't know the layout of Universal Studios, there's this upper part up on the level that a city walk is.

135
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:14,580
And then you take escalators down to the bottom and that's a much smaller area of the theme park.

136
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:20,280
And it's really literally right next door to the soundstage is where your favorite movies and TV shows are made.

137
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:28,720
And they're like really spreading out a lot more recently onto the back lot, including is it the Poltergeist maze?

138
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:34,160
One of them is like very deep into the New York back lot sets.

139
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,880
Yeah, really long walk.

140
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:51,860
Oh, yeah. Yeah, they've kind of built the mazes are built up around the sort of wherever they can get the space because as they pointed out on the tour and I got the tour from Universal Creative Director John Murty,

141
00:11:51,860 --> 00:12:00,960
who's like a longtime Universal employee, really kind of oversaw and kickstarted Horror Nights coming back to Hollywood.

142
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:04,880
Was it open in the 90s a little and then closed?

143
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,400
I think that's yeah, I think they did a little Halloween stuff.

144
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:12,720
But I think 2006 is about when they really started going all out with Horror Nights out here.

145
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:16,320
Once it really started to like cook in Florida.

146
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,240
Gotcha.

147
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:27,960
Well, because by the time I in 2007, my second year with the tour guide program, I got to I worked on the terror tram.

148
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:34,720
Yes, which was my favorite thing ever because you didn't have to do the tour.

149
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,460
It was all about time killing and all about bullshitting.

150
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:46,740
And it was like for sure could be tedious and you might go like, oh, I'm like stuck in one place for 40 minutes with like no material.

151
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:49,980
But man, I did like I did so much dumb stuff.

152
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,320
There used to be a video of me on YouTube and I don't know what of doing it.

153
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,280
I don't remember what happened. But I was very proud.

154
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:04,400
You talk about John Murty. I was I believe John Murty himself emailed me and said, I saw your video of you doing the tour.

155
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:13,660
And I was very scared of what was coming because people had been fired very quickly from that event for using too foul of language.

156
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:16,960
And I was worried I'd done something fireable.

157
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:23,200
But instead, he said, you know, most of your thing I don't think would work for wouldn't translate to other guides.

158
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:27,080
But there's one thing you said I liked so much. I'm going to put it in the script next year.

159
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,800
Wow. Do you remember what it was?

160
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:42,200
I do. It was that I kind of did the whole thing and sort of even like all the functional stuff I did in like a devil voice that would sort of fade awkwardly as a mumble through boring parts of it.

161
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:52,520
I don't smoke. And at the beginning, I said something about like like Halloween is a frightful time when chaos reigns and there are no rules.

162
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:56,320
That being said, there are a few rules.

163
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:03,700
And and I intended to go over well and they put it in the script and I was really honored.

164
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:10,560
But then I went back the next year and just got to hear people just plow through that and do that with no timing.

165
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,980
And like Halloween is a time of chaos where there are no rules. That being said, there are a few rules.

166
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:19,220
It was pretty funny watching the line get like just steamrolled by it.

167
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:22,800
But I was still that's a really solid like theme park joke.

168
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:29,680
Hey, thanks. Yeah, that was not I wasn't always like doing things totally counter to the spirit of the place.

169
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,880
I like trying to think of like a good reel like doesn't.

170
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,680
Oh, sure. Yeah, we are good boys.

171
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:40,920
No, I didn't I may have like, you know, I they said you could be like PG 13.

172
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,140
What do you think the sauce thing you said was?

173
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:49,460
Oh, I think I made might have made an abortion joke.

174
00:14:49,460 --> 00:15:02,160
Oh, wow. I don't remember what it was, but I remember getting kind of a ooh, which then like this guy, the John Murty, like watched whatever this abortion joke was.

175
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:04,240
Put me in the Bill and Ted.

176
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,880
Oh my gosh. Spooktacular for these. Yeah, that's that's pretty dicey.

177
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,300
If I can remember what the abortion was joke.

178
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,080
Well, we'll post that video of it.

179
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:19,860
Yeah, if I can check down the 12 year old abortion joke, go back in your files.

180
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,860
I'm sure it'll hold up just fine.

181
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:27,080
But the story I remember that I liked a lot was that, you know, they told us you could be a little more.

182
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,980
Sure. You could swear and stuff.

183
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:36,080
And so here's a profanity warning for anyone listening who doesn't like when we use profanities, but I feel like I have to for this.

184
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:47,320
But the I remember a female tour guide pulling out of the area and saying like, well, now we're no longer in earshot of my bosses.

185
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,380
And they said we kind of do what we want on this thing.

186
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,220
So fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

187
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:59,480
And she was wrong. They were we were she was still completely within earshot of the bosses.

188
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:04,720
And when the tour came back around, people were waiting for her and she was escorted out.

189
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:11,840
Again, that but that to me seems like copacetic for horror nights.

190
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:18,520
Yeah, but I don't I think it's not if you watch any of those like the Bill and Ted show, which we'll get into later.

191
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:23,160
But the there's maybe you get shit.

192
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,820
I know. I think. OK, maybe that's the line.

193
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:32,460
It's in the weird. It's like the weird American like censorship, like what gets censored and what doesn't.

194
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:34,080
And it's like certain words.

195
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,720
I don't know. I'm not turning on the George Carlin routine here.

196
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,760
But like those two words are off limits.

197
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:43,380
But you can make a lot of offensive jokes about gay people or something.

198
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,800
That's right. Yeah.

199
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:55,020
That's a shit. Baby boomers do not like profanity, even though the sky is on fire, like even though the country, the world is eating itself and heating up.

200
00:16:55,140 --> 00:17:01,460
Yeah. And they're more mad when they're not mad at Trump for using awful language and saying awful things.

201
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:05,440
They're mad at the channel for talking about it.

202
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:12,640
But like but they he said it. It's weird to why are you mad at the why are you mad at the person who said the bad word?

203
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:20,060
Yeah. Yes. Yeah. There's a lot of a lot of twisted values in this country here in this Halloween season.

204
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,320
But let's talk about something more fun. Sure.

205
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:37,000
Jason Sheridan on the scene. My other horror nights experience was that I when I interned in a production company in one of the bungalows on the back lot, I had to park like I had a little bit of a walk to where my parking assignment was.

206
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,200
And it was I got to go through I would go through the New York streets to take a shortcut.

207
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:48,820
And I was there like late one Friday, like when horror nights, I knew horror nights was starting in like an hour.

208
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:53,440
And I was like, I want to get the hell to my car because it is dark now.

209
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,380
And I know the ghoulies and goblins are coming out.

210
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:01,540
So and that would have been one of the first years they were really going all out.

211
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:05,480
Yes. So this person is a big oh sorry.

212
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,320
And I'm jumping around. Yeah.

213
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:15,320
John Murray, a big deal in the universal world, like probably really helped popularize this events and oversaw it and like and kind of like primarily overseas.

214
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:26,380
This this is like the main thing he does and he only he comes to L.A. for this only he mentioned in the tour that he lives in Ireland now and telecommutes for this.

215
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:32,540
But like for the right leading up to our nights he is here working on it.

216
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:36,640
Excuse me. And runs the runs himself.

217
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:40,700
I'm sure other people use it, too, but runs the horror nights Twitter account.

218
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:45,840
So you can tweet directly at John Murdy on the official horror nights Twitter account.

219
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,160
And he is very open.

220
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:58,620
And he was very clear about like, you know, we like that the fans tweet at us and that's where we pull ideas from every now and then, including the Stranger Things Mace.

221
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:05,060
He said like as soon as that was up on Netflix, people were like, you have to do a maze of this.

222
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:09,960
And I have to say it was very cool to go through that.

223
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:18,300
He said very rarely are they given access to a full size soundstage to build the mazes in that's a whole other stuff.

224
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:26,480
Sometimes these mazes are jammed into like where the line is for another attraction and to have an entire year, an entire soundstage.

225
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:32,880
And what is happening is they're demolishing a lot of the sound stages that are right up against the theme park for future expansion.

226
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:38,600
And you can really see how much they've cleared, although we were told, please do not take pictures of construction.

227
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:44,000
And I have some pictures that I'll post on the show accounts of the construction.

228
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,840
No, of the maze construction.

229
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,680
We were we were told there are parts of the maze we could take pictures of.

230
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:55,360
But those other pictures later, though, I take any I can show you on a map.

231
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:04,380
So this was a funny detail about that soundstage two months before we were there.

232
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:09,560
And before they started to build out, it was the Family Feud set.

233
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:16,480
Like they were filming Family Feud and then emptied it out and started building the Stranger Things maze in there.

234
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:19,000
Cool fact, playa. Yeah.

235
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,380
Steve Harvey might say.

236
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:27,780
It is a full soundstage with like the rat with a catwalks and rafters.

237
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:36,740
They had talked about using they were able to use part of stage seven forty seven one year.

238
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:41,220
Which uses airplane like your interiors.

239
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,780
I think they got it.

240
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,980
Oh, really? OK. Yeah.

241
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:47,840
But they were able to get access to some of that.

242
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:55,660
But Horror Nights is fascinating because I mean, a lot of haunts have to share space with operating theme parks.

243
00:20:55,720 --> 00:21:01,320
But this is sharing space with operating theme parks and a full working movie studio.

244
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:09,100
And then they essentially build a theme park within the theme park and movie studio that runs for 31 nights of the year.

245
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,540
Yeah. And so much.

246
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:17,320
And this was kind of recurring when we got to talk to the nots people, which we'll get into later.

247
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:25,220
But you it all the amount of effort that goes into this single month begs the question, how do you do the park for the rest of the year?

248
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:30,220
Because they were saying the nots people were saying we're already thinking about what's going on in 2019.

249
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,660
We're not even close to through 2018.

250
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:37,880
It's such an immense layer of production on top of the typical theme park stuff.

251
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:44,960
The nots people were saying that they are secretly starting to put up Christmas stuff and you can't see what it like in the background.

252
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,980
Christmas stuff is going up like it nots already.

253
00:21:48,120 --> 00:22:01,400
So like it's such a like everything they have to be on top of everything so far in advance to get all this stuff done and to get stuff built, as you're saying, in either just a working theme park or a theme park and a movie studio and TV production.

254
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:04,880
Like it is crazy to kind of have to manage all of that.

255
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:12,260
Some of the mazes, he said, like a lot of them, they start to build sometime between like late May and Fourth of July, and then they kind of stagger.

256
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,600
So they're not starting them all at once.

257
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:19,560
But yeah, the Stranger Things maze, like two, three months out from opening.

258
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,120
And this is kind of the marquee maze.

259
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:26,160
This is on all the promotional material, a lot of the merchandise.

260
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:29,200
There's Stranger Things based food at Horror Nights.

261
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:29,600
Wow.

262
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:37,000
And yeah, so the gist of the maze, I mean, I don't want to.

263
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:40,340
Horror Nights has been running for a little while by the time this is up.

264
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:47,480
I don't think I really have any spoilers, spoilers, but it's basically like the set pieces from season one.

265
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:53,960
So you go through the buyer house, the house that Winona Ryder and the two boys live in.

266
00:22:54,040 --> 00:23:01,940
The letters are on the walls and the Christmas lights are strung up that he uses to communicate with from the upside down.

267
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:08,280
They were talking about having to get to wire these lights because Christmas lights are like on a strand.

268
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:14,940
And if one goes out, they all go out and they're like, oh, we need we need to be able to control these lights.

269
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:19,700
So they had to figure out how to wire these lights so they could control them more individually.

270
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:27,700
So what should be like the easiest effect potentially just go by Christmas lights has to be manipulated in this crazy way.

271
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:37,660
And then the attention to detail in the house is is really impressive because, you know, you're thinking like the show takes place in the 1980s.

272
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:40,300
But the buyer family doesn't have a lot of money.

273
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:44,140
So a lot of their stuff is secondhand from the 70s.

274
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:52,580
So there's like this kind of bicentennial sort of wall wallpaper of like colonial people in the boys room or something.

275
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:57,940
And like there's a very shat like orangey couch in the one thing.

276
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:05,140
Yeah. So that's where they were like the production designers of the show involved.

277
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:13,860
Do we know? I know a lot of I mean, Horror Nights has their own like production staff and they're able to pull from some stuff from like the Universal Prop Department.

278
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:25,660
But then they're just like also scouting like yard sales and estate sales all around Southern California to find like period appropriate stuff for this maze and all the other bases.

279
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:31,080
So cool. And then like the I'm not so up on Stranger Things.

280
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:36,000
Was it like a like just was it accurate?

281
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:39,100
It's all is like walking onto the set.

282
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:53,360
And there's some stuff where I think in the like so you go through the house and then you go into like you go by like the little castle buyer, the little fort the kid builds in the backyard.

283
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:58,740
You go through the upside down. And that is an interest.

284
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:05,960
That room is like a black room with like some props and like hanging fiber optics.

285
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:13,400
And there's also they were putting in projection effects later to make it look like this weird trippy experience.

286
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:18,580
And he's like there's stuff in here from the set. There's stuff in here from the Stranger Things set.

287
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:25,100
And like Murty had to, you know, write a treatment, send it to the Duffer Brothers to get their OK.

288
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:28,260
And they have like approval like J.K. Rowling.

289
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:34,120
Yeah, they have approval and like first pass got approved by one Duffer but not Duffer two.

290
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:36,020
Yeah. Duff one and Duff two.

291
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:41,460
He made it sound like this one. I know some like they've had to.

292
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:49,400
I'm sure the Shining Maze working with like the Kubrick people and whatever studio owns that was insanely complicated.

293
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:53,340
But this one, it seemed like the Duffer Brothers like, no, we know horror.

294
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:56,700
We come to Horror Nights every year. We're into it. So we're very excited.

295
00:25:56,780 --> 00:26:08,040
Yeah. But like the attention to be like Murty talked about just going through and like he said it took him eight hours to go through each episode to like pull to like pick sound cues.

296
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:10,660
It's like, oh, I need that. I need that.

297
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:24,340
And then we're able to get access to the actors to record like some audio and use audio because in the past they have not been able to get people.

298
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:27,780
So John has been like, I have done the voice of Freddy Krueger before.

299
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:34,220
He has done Freddy Krueger or like they got people in house to do stuff.

300
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:45,500
I'm assuming this is a similar but when I was about the and we'll get to Nats, but when I got about to my third or fourth maze and I calmed down a little bit more, I started to notice that they have these cues.

301
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:53,960
Like the scares are on like music cues, which I didn't quite notice until I was in like four or five and I my brain was less worried.

302
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:59,420
And then I was like, I noticed in a room like a sting happens and then somebody jumped out like right on the sting.

303
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,360
So like they're doing stuff like that.

304
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:06,460
And these may you got ahead of it a little recognizing that pattern.

305
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:11,660
Yeah, I mean, yeah, it was in this, but maybe it was more so in this specific maze I was in.

306
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:19,560
But I noticed I did just that was the first time I had noticed that that they're like a whole there must be like every 45 seconds that sting happens.

307
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,500
And then this one scare happens.

308
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:33,800
So like their timing stuff, like what you're saying, like with with people saying things in dialogue and music to match up with 25 year olds jumping out at you and scaring you.

309
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,540
And here's another thing that you all may have noticed.

310
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:41,500
They're scaring you from from an angle from the left or the right.

311
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:44,760
They are not getting directly in your path.

312
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:53,060
This is a thing that came because someone else in the tour asked, has anyone ever gotten punched in the like jumps out against punches them in the face?

313
00:27:53,060 --> 00:28:01,900
And he's like, the way we work around that is we scare from the angle, pop out, pop back or like from the angle below.

314
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:11,760
This is all stuff that after Mays three or four, your brain starts getting a little more used to of like, OK, they're not going to come at me dead on.

315
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:13,820
They're really not going to block me.

316
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:16,780
I'm going to get maybe jumped a little like I'm going to be a jumpy.

317
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:21,460
But yeah, it's very interesting to sort of figure out then the mechanics of the whole thing after.

318
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:30,120
Because because really for the first couple of days, I was just like, oh, just like that noise in my brain for, you know, five minutes of the major other big thing.

319
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:32,060
They cannot touch you. Right.

320
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:36,720
They cannot touch you the way when they audition actors, once a scare actors.

321
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,660
One thing John said they do.

322
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:42,460
They put a chair in the center of the room and they say, scare the chair.

323
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:47,580
And they just kind of have you just kind of have to like act like it's a person and scare around it.

324
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:50,240
And he's like, if anyone touches the chair, they're cut.

325
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:55,620
They're out of there. Wow. You have to get as close as you can and get as committed as you can.

326
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:59,380
Like this is like a real actor like theater exercise.

327
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:06,580
That's like in the first Ninja Turtles with the bell where the ninjas have to go and get the bell without it making it ring.

328
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:12,160
They attach like a bell to a dummy and you have to prove that like you're worthy ninja by removing the bell.

329
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:19,560
And then I think it's yeah, this is the first one because Raphael helps that ninja kid and then they remove all the bells without making a sound.

330
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:24,620
So it's like this weird precision where you have to get as close as possible, but not disturb the actual chair.

331
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:32,780
Yeah. So the guy who tried to gnaw on the chair and tear it in half with his mouth did not pass.

332
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:38,500
We should all audition to be scare actors, not maybe do it, but all the audition to see if we can pass.

333
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:41,080
Maybe do it. Fine. We'll do it. I don't care.

334
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:46,540
I mean, they were very clear actually at both Knotts and Universal that it's like scare.

335
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:51,720
The people who do the scare acting are from all walks. Some of the people are professional actors.

336
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:54,180
Some of the people have nine to five jobs.

337
00:29:54,300 --> 00:30:02,080
John was talking about a guy who's like, I work all day at my job and then I sleep for a couple of hours under my desk and then I come to Universal and do it.

338
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:07,500
And he's like, how do you keep this up? And some people do it for five, 10, 20 years.

339
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:13,300
They just love doing it. And there is a real camaraderie among everyone doing it.

340
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:20,460
The way he described it sounds very familiar. It sounds like a theater company, sort of like we're all in this together.

341
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:29,380
We're all putting on the show. And like the last night of the haunts, like there's like, you know, people are very emotional because it's like they well, we all did this.

342
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:31,600
We all put the show on. We all went through this.

343
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:36,000
Sometimes there's a all screamed wedding proposal.

344
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,960
What are you doing? I have been my wife and only.

345
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:44,740
Angle. They don't touch each other. They jump back and forth at angles.

346
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,740
The ring is not actually touched.

347
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:54,400
What else? Yeah. So you go through, like I said, a lot of this piece that you end up in the lab.

348
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:59,600
The. And there's all that we just clarify. It's with the lights on.

349
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:04,400
So there's no scary actors in there. This is lights on when I went through it.

350
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:07,520
Yeah. Yeah. So this was yeah, it was a press. Oh, this was yes.

351
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:11,960
Well, we should say because we also and not not scary farm.

352
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:19,080
We got a preview of some mazes which when which we slowly walked through them without actors and with all of the lights on.

353
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:22,440
And I'll tell you, I had a wonderful time. Very impressive.

354
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:31,780
Very impressive. I'm just there to see the molding and, you know, I didn't go on the mazes in the dark with scare actors.

355
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:33,460
Yeah, both of them. You sure did.

356
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,760
For you. I'm going to brag about it as much as I can.

357
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:46,700
You see the lab, you see the upside down and they're working like up until the night before.

358
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:48,960
It was still a construction site. Basically, when you were there.

359
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:58,080
It was a construction site, as you will hear in a few minutes because I got to talk to John, do a short interview with John and you may hear some construction sounds in the background.

360
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:01,900
But there's like dust in the air. We could hear hammers and drills and everything.

361
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,120
Did you have to wear a hard hat?

362
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:07,500
No, they just closed toed shoes was the only request.

363
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:10,860
Closed toed shoes. Yeah. Okay.

364
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:14,040
I think that was in the email request.

365
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,400
But that's any shoe.

366
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:19,140
No, like no flip flops or sandals.

367
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:24,120
Oh, no, not those. It's sneakers. You didn't have to wear boots.

368
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:25,020
That's what I'm saying.

369
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:29,260
What else? Okay. This I thought was interesting.

370
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:39,600
So the monster and stranger things, the Demogorgon, which they very quickly showed us the pictures of like the mask that the actors would be wearing.

371
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,240
It's insanely detailed.

372
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:50,600
There's like because they have to rotate through actors like, you know, you're not an actor is a scare actor is not.

373
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:52,620
It's not there's not one debt.

374
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:58,120
There's like 15 to 16 Demogorgons every night because they show up at different parts in the maze.

375
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:07,200
Depending on what they're doing, they maybe they're running like a 30 minutes on set, 30 minutes offset to recover from that.

376
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:11,800
Although some are just impartial makes of they're just the hand or just the upper half.

377
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,980
They may be able to go a little longer.

378
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:18,600
Yeah. Should we play the interview?

379
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:22,540
Yeah. I'm just trying to think if there's anything, any other context.

380
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:26,240
Yeah. So we went through the maze, asked some questions.

381
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,600
Everyone kind of chined in. Tell us more about the van ride.

382
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:34,520
Yeah. What kind of van was it? Just squeeze in within a row.

383
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:42,160
I guess there is a van service that's like four universal employees that goes from the upper lot to the lower lot,

384
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:47,380
especially with horror nights running and they're working all over the was the driver entertaining?

385
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:50,240
Like, is he do any jokes like the tram tour guide would?

386
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:55,880
Very nice. I mean, there was also like PAs and office workers and stuff.

387
00:33:55,880 --> 00:34:02,980
The thing that was interesting to me, the talent building, there was dozens and dozens of people like filling out their start work,

388
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:07,760
like scare actors and temporary season liars. So crazy time over there.

389
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:12,920
Yeah. And you weren't but you weren't inspired to jump into the fray and say, you know, I like it.

390
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:16,640
This is my home. Sign me up. Well, it felt like a conflict of interest.

391
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:20,620
So but maybe we'll conflict that interest if we all become scare actors.

392
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:24,940
If you can find us in the park next year. Yeah.

393
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:32,680
So, yeah, like I said, so at the end of the tour, I got to talk to John for a few minutes and we'll play that right now.

394
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:36,840
John, thanks so much for talking to me today.

395
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:43,340
I guess just to get started, what do you think sets Halloween Horror Nights apart from other haunts?

396
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:48,360
I think first and foremost, it's the attention to detail that we put into everything we do,

397
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:52,260
whether it's a horror movie or a horror television show.

398
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:54,600
Our ultimate goal is always the same.

399
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:59,040
It's to make our guests feel as if they're living that particular horror movie or horror TV show.

400
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:07,420
The thing I always say is it should feel as if you got up off your couch and step through the TV screen or you got out of your movie seat and step through the movie screen.

401
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:12,080
And now you're in the world of the horror movie and you're living it and it's coming for you.

402
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:15,200
And that's what we try to do with everything that we do for the horror nights.

403
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:25,420
So we put an awful lot of attention into the scenic, the props, the set dressing, the lighting, the audio, everything to serve the story of what we're telling.

404
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:30,540
Great. This question is very specific to our show.

405
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:38,060
Myself and my co-hosts are what's known as Little Scaredy Cats, who are easily startled and frightened.

406
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:44,900
What advice would you have for us for overcoming our fears and attending an event like this?

407
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Good luck.

408
00:35:49,340 --> 00:36:00,800
No, but there's, you know, I always think Halloween is and things like this are very similar to like riding a roller coaster for the first time.

409
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:07,360
It's facing your fears much in the same way as when you're a kid and you're looking at that big roller coaster that you've never ridden before.

410
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:18,500
And the other thing I've noticed over time is that people who go through our mazes at horror nights, it's very much the same experience as riding a roller coaster.

411
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:20,500
When people come off a roller coaster, what do they usually do?

412
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:24,020
They usually laugh, you know, because it's that release of nervous energy.

413
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:30,040
And a lot of times when you see people come out of a maze, even though they've been terrified, they start laughing because it's the same release of energy.

414
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:38,880
So, you know, I would in your mind think you're going to ride the craziest roller coaster that goes upside down and has 400 foot drops.

415
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:43,880
And you'll be in the right mentality for horror nights and just do that like eight times.

416
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,440
Yeah, pretty much all night long.

417
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:55,700
Some other haunts in the Southern California area have kind of upped the ante with things like putting a burlap sack over your head or simulating kidnapping.

418
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:58,500
Any desire to get into that area?

419
00:36:58,940 --> 00:36:59,400
No.

420
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:00,140
No?

421
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:09,740
No, I mean, the great thing about the haunt industry is that particularly if you're in Los Angeles, there's so many different places you can go and experience.

422
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:13,900
And there's so many different flavors to the art of scaring people.

423
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:19,960
What we do is a very specific thing where we're trying to bring to life movies and television shows.

424
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:23,440
But no, I don't have any desire to put a bag over your head.

425
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,560
Yeah, I don't have any desire to do it myself.

426
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:32,400
One last thing I noticed looking at the horror nights websites for Orlando and Hollywood.

427
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:36,020
Why are they called haunted houses in Orlando?

428
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,400
Why are they called mazes out here?

429
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,600
Yeah, Orlando calls them houses and we call them mazes.

430
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:49,200
And recently we were both, Mike Aiello, who is my creative counterpart in Orlando, and myself and my art director Chris were speaking at a convention called Midsummer Scream.

431
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:56,140
And I solicited on Twitter, you know, I asked the fans, hey, send me questions you'd like to ask, you know, Mike or myself or Chris.

432
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:59,000
And one of the first questions I got was that same question.

433
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:03,580
Why are they called houses in Orlando and why are they called mazes in Halloween?

434
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:06,200
And the answer is we don't really know.

435
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:07,940
They've always been called that.

436
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:12,120
And as long as you know, as I've been around, I've been doing horror nights since 2006.

437
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:18,640
And, you know, it had a history prior to me going back to even as early as the mid 1980s.

438
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,720
They did it.

439
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:23,840
And back then they were they were called mazes out here and they were called houses in Orlando.

440
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:26,020
And we have no idea why.

441
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:28,560
So I know that's an unsatisfactory answer.

442
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:29,420
No, that's the truth.

443
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:29,740
That's great.

444
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:33,560
Frankly, I think mazes sound scary because you could get trapped in a maze.

445
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:37,860
Well, we call mazes a lot of times because the physical construction of them is like a maze.

446
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:42,740
And when you're walking around in these things, you can easily get lost if you don't know your way around.

447
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:46,140
So that's always been like a way we refer to it.

448
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:49,540
Orlando since the beginning of horror nights in Orlando has called them houses.

449
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:53,220
So it's just a weird East Coast, West Coast thing.

450
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,840
Sure. Well, thanks so much, John.

451
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:55,700
Sure. My pleasure.

452
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:02,540
OK, so John's advice, you know, you just kind of overcome it again and again.

453
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:09,200
Scott and I overcame it once and one time you technically call that overcoming.

454
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,140
I wouldn't call it that.

455
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,720
Why? We went through it.

456
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,020
What do you want from us?

457
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:19,220
I mean, I want I want full I want us to be fans of the haunt.

458
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:21,200
Now I'm now a big haunt fan.

459
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,600
Yeah, you're a haunt guy.

460
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,600
I'm a haunt guy now.

461
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:28,780
So you're there like you're like, are you well, you're going to go to Halloween Horror Nights?

462
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:30,000
I will go to Horror Nights.

463
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,120
You're going to go to Horror Nights.

464
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:37,260
My friend Luke, he a couple of weeks ago, he was like, you know, we went last year and he's kind of a scared guy, too.

465
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:38,960
He goes, you know, we went last year was kind of fun.

466
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:42,400
You go have a couple of margaritas before and I go, I like the sound of that.

467
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:43,520
He goes, you know, it's not so bad.

468
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,620
It's not actually as scary as you think.

469
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:49,260
But when I drink, it's not OK in the I'm a drunk for drinking.

470
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,220
All right. Before we go down this path.

471
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:52,560
That's true. You were describing.

472
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:55,940
Thanks to Universal.

473
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:58,140
Thanks to Universal.

474
00:39:58,340 --> 00:39:59,260
That's a relaxing drink.

475
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:01,120
Wine is an alcoholic string.

476
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:03,580
Thank you.

477
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:04,060
Record.

478
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,580
All right. Just shut up for a second.

479
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:09,660
Just trying to be nice to the thank you to the universal people for having me.

480
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:12,620
Thank you to John Murty for talking to us.

481
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:12,860
Yeah.

482
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:14,480
Tweeted him on Twitter.

483
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:16,380
Not on Twitter.

484
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:17,860
Not on Twitter.

485
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:19,520
Yeah.

486
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,400
And so we took that advice of.

487
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:23,160
Yeah.

488
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:27,480
So we were again when we were calling for people to invite us to things,

489
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:30,300
which this is all about us getting stuff, this podcast,

490
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:35,380
we were invited by another podcast, a long stand.

491
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:39,060
Eleven years, I believe, is what they said they had long they had been doing.

492
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,700
The podcast is called the Season Pass podcast.

493
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:42,280
We've mentioned it many times before.

494
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,900
They do great series of interviews with Tony Baxter and other imagineers.

495
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,200
And this is like the nerd stuff.

496
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:52,680
Our podcast is like mostly about us and our lives.

497
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:54,500
Smart times.

498
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:55,500
Making wise.

499
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:56,920
We like those.

500
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,240
But this is season pass.

501
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,600
Like if you're a nerd for this stuff, this is it.

502
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:06,000
You know, the real info and they really delve in and they, you know,

503
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:08,200
we've now because of them,

504
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:13,260
we've had a couple of actual theme park people on the legacy now with John

505
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:17,500
Murty and the folks we talked to and now we've talked to actual industry

506
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,600
insiders as well as Tony Baxter and I'll have show.

507
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:25,600
They've this is who they have all the time and some UCB knucklehead

508
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:28,940
describing his vague memory of a ride.

509
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:31,980
Right. Nick Money doesn't know the ride systems at Astroworld.

510
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:34,220
He doesn't know what company built those rides.

511
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,220
He's just going to tell us stories from his life.

512
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:39,160
Story about stealing candy from an actual baby.

513
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,180
Astroworld.

514
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,300
That's what he did.

515
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:43,940
It's one of his trademark moves at Astroworld.

516
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:49,520
So we were so Doug Barnes and Robert Coker from the season pass were

517
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,620
nice enough to invite us to a thing they do every year.

518
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:57,060
They get to go and hang out, get tours of mazes, get to interview people backstage.

519
00:41:57,740 --> 00:42:00,720
They get the full, they get the red carpet rolled out for them.

520
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:04,400
And they've done this every year so you can go back and hear episodes that

521
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,260
they've done in the past about old mazes and stuff.

522
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:09,760
But they invited podcasts to ride to join them.

523
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:14,900
And this is really, I guess, our first theme park podcast crossover because if

524
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:15,920
all things go well,

525
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:21,020
we're both going to be releasing episodes where each other appears on the

526
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:25,060
other's podcast on the same day. When this comes out, you roll over to season pass.

527
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,200
Hear us on the season pass podcast.

528
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:31,580
Hear us interrupting the theme park industry people with garbage.

529
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:32,860
To make wisecracks.

530
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:33,860
They're saying like.

531
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:36,060
About pink pen in a dirty barn.

532
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,340
That might be, I forgot all about that.

533
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:39,540
Oh yeah, we addressed pig.

534
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:43,660
Well, we got to like bring up some of our little like, you know,

535
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:49,680
particular knots, fascinations, like, yeah, like the freedom center and like

536
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:52,680
Studio K, their, their, their nightclub.

537
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:57,080
And I got to talk, I got to ask about the Raven a lot from the mystery lodge.

538
00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:00,760
This is a great tease for there because we, we are on this episode a lot.

539
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:04,660
So like, yeah, in the episode, I've, if I had to ballpark it based on the,

540
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:08,720
the time it took to record it, I think their episode will be like about four and

541
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:09,280
a half hours.

542
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:14,080
I don't think that's any sort of joke suggestion of how long it'll be.

543
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:15,400
I do think it's going to be that long.

544
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:17,120
That's right on the money.

545
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:17,340
Yeah.

546
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:20,580
We hung out and talked to a bunch of knots folks.

547
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:26,340
So if you finished this and you want to hear more head over to season pass

548
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:27,160
podcast.

549
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:31,780
And I like the trade that's happening where now we are starting to have theme

550
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:36,100
park professionals on the show and they are starting to have jackass pseudo

551
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:36,740
comedians.

552
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:37,340
If we can.

553
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:38,640
We're trading back and forth.

554
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:42,620
Robert and Doug kept talking about, they had heard the Astroworld episode and

555
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,420
they thought that Nick Monday was funny.

556
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:48,340
So if we get Monday on season pass, I think that's a win for us.

557
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:52,840
If we can really cross over the universes, but we're not going to like ask if he

558
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:55,020
wants to, we're just going to send them over to where they live.

559
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:58,760
We're going to send him a forwarded email with like an address and then I'm

560
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:00,100
going to say, okay, you're doing this podcast.

561
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:03,380
And then the same way that he may had us do this pop, make this podcast.

562
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:04,840
Hey, you're doing the thing.

563
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:05,340
You're doing the thing.

564
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,800
We're going to just be like, Hey, you're on the season pass podcast.

565
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:08,820
Here's going to be a guest.

566
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:12,280
So like, well, that'll, that'll be when we finally start getting all of the

567
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:14,380
universe, all the characters and Monday around.

568
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:15,040
Yeah, finally.

569
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:22,100
So, uh, so we got to, yeah, we, we hung out at, uh, the backstage at not scary

570
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:22,500
farm.

571
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:27,680
This was exciting for me because I probably my highlight of the night was

572
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:32,300
passing through a weird little backstage area and seeing some spare dry,

573
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:37,180
rapid ride vehicles, just sitting around, uh, you lit up.

574
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:39,280
Getting rusted out of a tired day.

575
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:41,860
Cause we have been in the conference room for so long, but there were these

576
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:49,240
old, just like mildewy ride vehicles and you were like, Hey, it's the most

577
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:52,140
excited you got all morning zoo.

578
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:52,900
Yeah.

579
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:54,820
Uh, I was very excited.

580
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:00,460
Uh, um, I was, I was excited to sit at a Knott's Berry, a not very far

581
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:04,240
conference room as well and walk around their offices and see what the

582
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:07,100
iterations that not people have in their cubicles.

583
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:13,420
And, uh, we got to go to the company store and peruse exclusive cheaper jams

584
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:17,480
than a typical just tourist riff raff could look at.

585
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:17,700
Right.

586
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:22,940
They were not, uh, I was asking if they were, um, exclusive to employee jam.

587
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,380
Like there are no preserves that are specific.

588
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:27,280
There's no employee Berry.

589
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:29,580
Which they should do.

590
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:31,180
Cast member Berry.

591
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:32,300
Cast member Berry.

592
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:32,680
Yeah.

593
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:34,100
But, uh, yeah, we got to go in that.

594
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:35,620
We were very excited to go in the gift shop.

595
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:40,180
That's only it's like Mickey's of Glendale, like an Imagineering, but it's

596
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:44,120
for only employees at Knott's in a similar way where like you can't normally

597
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:45,120
get into this place.

598
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,940
And this is, this was very unique for me.

599
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:51,260
Cause I really have not been to not before we went to the chicken dinner

600
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:55,080
restaurant for Scott's birthday, but I had not been in the park proper.

601
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:59,600
So to have the first experience be in their creative departments, offices,

602
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:07,260
and then backstage at Mazes and then dumped into a back door into scary farm.

603
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:13,680
Uh, maize that was built into the, uh, what is typically mystery lodge where

604
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,860
that prankster, the Raven lives.

605
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:19,300
So the Raven, if you want to hear more about the Raven, there's a lot of Raven

606
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:22,680
talk on season pass hammer and Raven for sure.

607
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:23,480
Because who did, okay.

608
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:26,940
So who did we talk to that we'll hear on the other podcast and not this one,

609
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:32,720
we talked to a merchandise, a gentleman about the pins that they've,

610
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:35,000
they've started to make it much in their t-shirts.

611
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:35,800
His last name was Bush.

612
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:37,100
Carl Bush.

613
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:38,560
Carl Bush seems right.

614
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:38,740
Yep.

615
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:40,220
He was a nice, very nice man.

616
00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:43,880
I asked him to do, I wanted Berry Tales merch and I wanted Raven merch.

617
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:44,820
He was right on that.

618
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:46,280
He was right on Berry Tales.

619
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:48,620
And it sounds like I think he confirmed Berry Tales merch.

620
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:52,160
And if you don't know Berry Tales, Google Berry Tales, Knott's Berry Farm,

621
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:58,380
but Google it with B-E-A-R because there's a different kind of bear and

622
00:46:58,380 --> 00:46:59,400
different kind of Berry.

623
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:02,040
Uh, and we'll, we're going to, I think we'll, we'll,

624
00:47:02,060 --> 00:47:04,700
we'll start breaking Knott's off into smaller bits.

625
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:07,280
I think we'll talk Berry Tales for a full up sometime.

626
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:11,680
Uh, cause one thing that he brought up a lot is we are two years away.

627
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:12,760
This is crazy.

628
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:16,000
Knott's turns 100 in two years.

629
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:16,660
Yeah.

630
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:17,520
That's wild.

631
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:19,560
I mean, that's from the very original.

632
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:22,040
He buys the property, sets up a chicken stand.

633
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:28,620
And it evolved into a theme park very slowly over the course of that 100 years.

634
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:32,800
But for sure that is the roots of that's the earliest roots of a theme park.

635
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:33,540
Uh, uh,

636
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:36,880
I mean he didn't confirm it, but I asked about cloud nine and studio K,

637
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:40,360
the video opulous of knots, the cool dance club merch.

638
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:42,680
And he said that there's a lot of people asking about it.

639
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:45,480
So he didn't confirm it, but I feel like it's pot is very possible.

640
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:50,220
This is exciting in the drive for retro stuff, which Disney should offer more.

641
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:50,580
Yeah.

642
00:47:50,580 --> 00:47:55,300
And I didn't realize that cloud nine had come back for last year's boys and Berry festival.

643
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:59,960
They like arcade thing, which obviously not the full cloud nine.

644
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:01,840
There was some like cool teens there.

645
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:05,100
They were regular teens, but they weren't specifically cool.

646
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:07,680
Um, so they're doing, they're doing a little more of it.

647
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:10,780
I'm happy to see that they're embracing their, uh, their history.

648
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:11,900
Cause they're retro.

649
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:14,180
I mean, we, we got some of it.

650
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:16,220
They gave us some shirts and buttons and stuff.

651
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:18,600
And like there it's like, oh yeah.

652
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:21,700
The sixties and seventies stuff was cool here too.

653
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:26,120
Like a very scratchy kind of hand-drawn illustration style.

654
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:33,400
So before we get, so before we get into the maze, let's, you want to throw it to us backstage at knots?

655
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:41,640
Oh yeah. So we, yes, we got to, uh, and you'll hear more of this if you check out the season pass podcast, but for our podcast, for podcast, right?

656
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:48,340
Exclusive, we got to talk to a gentleman named Jeff Tucker who works in entertainment at knots has been there for a long time.

657
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:51,580
Uh, is a show writer there has worked in a ton of capacities.

658
00:48:51,760 --> 00:49:09,200
I don't think we mentioned this on our pockets. We mentioned it on the other, but, uh, I was excited to learn if you go on the ride ghost rider, uh, the, the wooden, uh, the Western themed roller coaster at knots, uh, that if you watch the pre ride video that there's a, like a confused cowboy on it.

659
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:17,160
And it's this guy, Jeff Tucker, who we talked to and as an obsessive of, uh, pre ride videos, I became starstruck though.

660
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:21,540
I haven't seen this particular video, but a cool context for this man.

661
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:24,520
He seems to have a dozen jobs. Yeah.

662
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:29,020
He performs in the park still. Uh, he's doing like a old medicine show. He was telling us.

663
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:30,300
That's right. Yeah.

664
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:34,500
He's also in your favorite attraction at knots. He had performed in that.

665
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:36,560
He had performed at the mystery lodge.

666
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:45,840
He trains mystery lodge performers. Oh, he was doing that at current, right? He was like, I gotta, yeah, I've been working hard. I'm training a storyteller. Right.

667
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:50,920
Which is what I think that was the first thing you were excited to show me at knots. Oh yeah.

668
00:49:51,220 --> 00:49:52,320
I recall you being like, we gotta see the mystery lodge.

669
00:49:52,340 --> 00:50:03,640
That's maybe a little under the radar thing that you don't know about. Um, so yeah, uh, Jeff does a ton at, uh, at, at knots and knows a lot about scary farm is very passionate about it.

670
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:09,140
So we're going to talk to him over at knots, Barry farm to take it away us.

671
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:16,100
Okay. Thank you. Us. And now we are, but this has been enough itself was pretty historical.

672
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:22,200
This is the first time we've recorded podcast, the ride from on an actual site of a theme park.

673
00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:26,800
We are in a conference room in the bowels of knots, Barry farm.

674
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:31,200
And we're here as we said, with the season pass guys. What's going on fellas? Hey guys.

675
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:35,360
Thank you. Wow. That was Robert. That was like the worst.

676
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:40,480
I thought it was fun. You just missed our show. Nobody's going to listen to the season pass.

677
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:44,280
And after they just heard you do that, that implies they're still listening at all. Doug.

678
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:46,940
It's like, whatever. He does a podcast.

679
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:50,680
Hey guys. Thanks for having us.

680
00:50:50,860 --> 00:50:59,360
Well, yes, this is a theme park podcast crossover event. And we are also joined by Jeff Tucker from entertainment here at knots.

681
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:03,800
Barry farm. Welcome Jeff. Thank you. It's great to be here. Thanks for coming to not scary farm.

682
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:07,760
Oh, so excited. Yes. Thanks for having us. Well, we're here in the, we're in the middle.

683
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:14,760
We're learning about the history of this event of not scary farm and what you guys are up to this year.

684
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:20,180
So let us know what, what, what can you tell us about the question for you?

685
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:25,080
You guys are all terrified of this event. Is that what I'm getting? Why are you here?

686
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:30,820
You're terrified. Doug was nice and wanted to hang. It's all the blame on Doug.

687
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:36,340
Hey Jeff, do you want to come do a show about avocados? I go, no, I'm good. I don't care for avocados.

688
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:40,100
You wouldn't like the avocado festival. Oh God, no, I wouldn't go anywhere near it.

689
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:43,880
I would totally go to the avocado festival. My wife goes every year.

690
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:47,640
I don't like any fruit or vegetable enough to want to go to a festival of any kind.

691
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:51,720
Although you get to see dioramas of avocados in little costumes.

692
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:58,420
You're not selling it to me. You know, you know what you work for an organization that does a thing called a boysenberry festival.

693
00:51:58,460 --> 00:52:00,820
I'll get paid to go to that one though. Oh, all right. Fair enough.

694
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:04,820
John McCluck. Well, we're trying, I feel like it's a good opportunity.

695
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:10,200
Not only do we want to come and hang out, we just want, I want a me purse. I only speak for me.

696
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:16,020
I feel like today maybe is the day where I can conquer my fear.

697
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:21,220
Maybe there is a situation today where I get over something that's been stressing me out.

698
00:52:21,220 --> 00:52:25,960
We will put you in infected special ops. OK, that sounds bad.

699
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:30,180
There is a zombie apocalypse aiming for you.

700
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:34,620
The difference is you have a gun and you get to fire at them.

701
00:52:34,620 --> 00:52:37,500
And when you hit them, they fall away. Really?

702
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:41,460
So you could conquer your fear by actually mowing them down with a gun.

703
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:43,960
We will get you in that attraction. We'll mic you up for that.

704
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:48,820
All right, let's mic me up. Yeah. Maybe this and hopefully the gun won't jam or something.

705
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,400
You're going to be like Animal Mother in Full Metal Jacket. Good some.

706
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:58,560
That's what the character I've always wanted to be. Right, man.

707
00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:01,500
Your hero. The great Adam Baldwin. My hero.

708
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:06,920
OK, so yeah, I'm thinking maybe this is a growth moment in my life is what I'm saying.

709
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:10,540
In your life, perhaps. I don't know anyone, anything.

710
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:17,380
I was more interested in sitting in a Knott's Perry conference room.

711
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:21,800
This is what I came for. Jason, where do you stand?

712
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:29,140
50-50. The appeal of behind the scenes and free food brought me down here.

713
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:34,020
So, yeah, I don't know. We could try it.

714
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:37,480
Well, that was a good sell. That sounds really exciting.

715
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:41,460
And we got to walk around some of the mazes with you guys from season pass.

716
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:42,700
And that was that was a blast.

717
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:48,860
But but yeah, we're we're told that you know much about the about the history of this event and

718
00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:53,720
or if you if you want to talk about that or how you how what role you play this.

719
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:55,660
No, we can talk about the history. The events.

720
00:53:55,860 --> 00:54:03,340
An amazing event because you're talking about an event that has almost a worldwide reach in that.

721
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:05,520
I always I always preface it the same way.

722
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:09,580
When I was a kid, I loved Halloween. I loved Halloween.

723
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:13,880
The problem is that Halloween is one night.

724
00:54:14,620 --> 00:54:20,160
Right. I used to I used to agonize for weeks over which version of Luke Skywalker I was going to be for Halloween.

725
00:54:20,180 --> 00:54:26,760
Right. Is it black robed Jedi Luke or white robed farm boy Luke or X-wing Luke?

726
00:54:26,780 --> 00:54:31,380
Right. So you put all this work into it and Halloween is one night.

727
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:37,580
And not only is it just one night, but it's about five thirty p.m.

728
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:40,520
to nine thirty p.m. Right.

729
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:43,140
Yeah, it winds down. That's all you get as a kid.

730
00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:46,040
You got to get out there and get your candy and get home before your mom starts.

731
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:48,640
I still trigger. There was no cell phones when I was trick or treating.

732
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:52,280
So we just had to gauge time to go. Right.

733
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:58,780
So then if you if you extrapolate that and say that what's the first Halloween you remember?

734
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:01,940
Like how old were you? Eight, nine, ten?

735
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:07,500
Yes, because I remember there was a front yard.

736
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:10,480
There was like where the candy bowl was at this house.

737
00:55:10,820 --> 00:55:17,820
And there was like a man sized creature sitting next to the candy bowl not moving.

738
00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:22,620
And I thought, oh, it's one of those straw stuffed scarecrows that are so popular.

739
00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:25,720
Like we've gone to three different houses that had these man sized scarecrows.

740
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:30,140
But this one lunged at me because it was not a man sized thing.

741
00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:32,480
It was a man. Yes.

742
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:35,760
How old were you? Probably like eight or nine.

743
00:55:35,980 --> 00:55:37,580
We'll say nine. I have a better memory.

744
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:39,320
I'm four. Better memory. OK.

745
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:42,280
Because I was the ghost of ET. You know how ET was in the ghost.

746
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:45,220
I did that. You were ET and the ghost.

747
00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:48,480
I was acting as ET in the ghost. I was actually just a ghost.

748
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:50,460
But in your head.

749
00:55:50,540 --> 00:55:55,740
I think that my parents were really cheap that year and were like, you know, you're ET inside the ghost.

750
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:58,040
Should we buy him the ET mask? No, just get the sheet.

751
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:04,160
Just the sheet. That's so I remember that because I was like, yeah, I was like, no, no, no, no, no.

752
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:07,000
How old were you? I think we were like four years old when that happened.

753
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:12,220
So yeah, because ET was brand new then. It was like ET was the thing at that.

754
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:16,900
So I remember that. But I also have a really ridiculous memory as a child.

755
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:23,120
So the average is like nine. And then when do you stop trick or treating? Five. Oh, I'm sorry.

756
00:56:25,060 --> 00:56:26,480
13, right? Oh, yeah.

757
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:29,300
But age 13, you're like, I'm a little too old to be doing that.

758
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:33,700
So if we go nine to 13, we get four years. Right.

759
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:38,480
And if Halloween's four hours a night, we get 16 hours of Halloween.

760
00:56:38,660 --> 00:56:42,420
And your whole life, your whole life that matters. Right.

761
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:46,340
So the Knott family had this idea. What if we extended a little?

762
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:52,260
And when they say extended, the first scary farm in 1973 was only a few nights,

763
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:56,340
three or four nights at the most. And it was the park closed.

764
00:56:56,700 --> 00:57:00,460
They went up. They put some cobwebs around. They had people dressed.

765
00:57:00,620 --> 00:57:04,680
I'm not kidding as the Planet of the Apes characters walking around.

766
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:07,880
What? Yeah. Because they just surely they have the rights.

767
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:16,040
Absolutely not. They went to a few makeup guys and said like, what do you got?

768
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:20,120
And this is all they had. There was no Halloween industry in 73.

769
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:24,680
Halloween was one night you went and you went to save ons and you picked out

770
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:27,600
whatever costume came in a box. Right.

771
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:31,160
Except for Doug, whose parents were cheap. And you went out trick or treating.

772
00:57:31,340 --> 00:57:33,740
But in the Knott family was like, we can extend this a little.

773
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:38,260
So the park was done up. They played some sound effects records.

774
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:42,520
And it was a huge, massive hit.

775
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:46,680
So the idea was, is it coming back was a no brainer.

776
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:52,600
And they just kept adding to it, adding more value to it, adding the first walk

777
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:54,460
through mazes a couple of years later.

778
00:57:56,340 --> 00:58:00,040
Originally, the Pekins had monsters in them where if you looked in, they tried to

779
00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:03,540
get you. Well, then they said, let's let the monsters roam around.

780
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:06,560
So that became the first roaming street monsters.

781
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:12,520
Then they added more mazes and then they added Wolfman Jack, who did a show here.

782
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:18,680
The first show here was Seymour, who was a late night horror host.

783
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:22,700
Now another horror movie. And he actually hosted a movie in the theater.

784
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:25,700
Right. He came out, he introduced it, and then there was a movie.

785
00:58:26,140 --> 00:58:30,660
Then they had Wolfman Jack. And I've actually seen footage of that show.

786
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:33,560
It was 1977, I believe.

787
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:36,800
And it's Wolfman Jack in our theater.

788
00:58:36,820 --> 00:58:40,840
And he's dancing with Darth Vader, Chewbacca.

789
00:58:40,940 --> 00:58:42,880
Wow. Some Jawas.

790
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:46,960
And the clip I'm seeing, she's like, everybody take a look in the audience.

791
00:58:47,020 --> 00:58:49,400
Carrie Fisher, Princess Leia herself.

792
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,780
And it's Princess Leia, it's Carrie Fisher.

793
00:58:52,460 --> 00:58:53,680
I would have died.

794
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:55,580
Wow. Wow.

795
00:58:55,660 --> 00:58:57,240
I'm sure they got a big cease and desist.

796
00:58:57,560 --> 00:59:02,040
So the event kept rolling and they kept adding more nights.

797
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:05,720
And then they added the ingredient that really solidified.

798
00:59:05,740 --> 00:59:08,820
They originally added Elvira. That was the big event.

799
00:59:08,820 --> 00:59:13,360
When they added Elvira, she was a local Channel 9 horror host.

800
00:59:14,060 --> 00:59:17,720
Movie macabre, she introduced movies, she did a lot of breast jokes.

801
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:22,920
And it was a perfect fit, putting her in a big Vegas style show

802
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:25,820
where she could sing and dance. She's gorgeous.

803
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:30,060
And that rolled through the 80s, man. Rolled through the 80s.

804
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:34,440
There were a couple years we had Weird Al Yankovic here.

805
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:39,900
Elvira brought along John Paragon who played the breather on her show.

806
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:41,540
He was also John B.

807
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:42,940
Peewee. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

808
00:59:42,940 --> 00:59:45,340
And the Terry.

809
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:47,500
Yeah, Mekka Lekka Hai, Mekka Hainiho.

810
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:48,140
Yeah, wow.

811
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:50,080
Great guy. Really great guy.

812
00:59:50,340 --> 00:59:50,900
Oh, really? Oh, that's cool.

813
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:56,160
Oh, yeah. And then the family owned it up until 97.

814
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:59,400
And Haunt was the moneymaker.

815
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:00,720
I mean, it's like printing money.

816
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:05,820
And they created the theme park Halloween event

817
01:00:05,820 --> 01:00:09,020
and they created extending Halloween.

818
01:00:09,140 --> 01:00:14,340
We were talking earlier, Halloween began in Florida, Disney World, in August.

819
01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:17,860
The Mickey's Halloween treat was in August, right?

820
01:00:17,860 --> 01:00:19,300
That's how much they stretch out Halloween.

821
01:00:19,660 --> 01:00:23,480
Halloween is beyond, I mean, it's crazy because it used to be growing up.

822
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,440
Christmas was the big event.

823
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:27,400
Christmas was two weeks off.

824
01:00:27,660 --> 01:00:31,940
Man, I ain't going to think about school and I can't wait to get more Star Wars toys for Christmas.

825
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:33,840
Right? Christmas was the event.

826
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:37,860
And now Halloween has become just as big and it's huge.

827
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:43,400
And people plan parties and they have lawn decorations that are amazing.

828
01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:48,980
And it all traces back to Knott's Scary Farm in 1973.

829
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:50,760
It's unbelievable.

830
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:54,700
This is crazy, the level of how much opened up because of this.

831
01:00:55,020 --> 01:01:00,640
And you're making me realize how it proceeded, like everything Universal does.

832
01:01:00,780 --> 01:01:06,240
It proceeded everything as far as the idea of a hard ticket event

833
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:09,420
where you go and they're going to scare you.

834
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:12,660
Like that must have been a hard sell back in the day.

835
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:14,540
We're like, wait, wait, wait, people are going to what?

836
01:01:15,140 --> 01:01:16,940
Well, we're going to bring them in and then terrorize them.

837
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:18,660
And they're going to pay for it. Oh, yeah.

838
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:21,480
They're going to pay a premium for it. I don't understand.

839
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:23,020
It still doesn't make sense to us.

840
01:01:24,540 --> 01:01:28,320
So you mean to tell me I'm giving you money for fear?

841
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:31,840
Yes. Like that's crazy, right?

842
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:32,460
Yeah, it does.

843
01:01:33,100 --> 01:01:38,120
And it all goes to if you don't psychologically, we're all going to die.

844
01:01:38,540 --> 01:01:39,360
It's inevitable.

845
01:01:40,180 --> 01:01:41,340
We are the news to us.

846
01:01:41,420 --> 01:01:42,460
I know, right?

847
01:01:42,940 --> 01:01:48,840
And so if we can face a little slice of it on our terms where we know we're going to face it

848
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:51,800
and we're going to come out OK, have a big laugh with all of our friends,

849
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:53,560
that's how you bond with people.

850
01:01:53,860 --> 01:01:55,160
That's how I mean, that really is.

851
01:01:55,840 --> 01:01:58,660
Not scary farm has become because we've been here so long.

852
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:00,040
It's a rite of passage.

853
01:02:00,460 --> 01:02:02,380
You know, your older brother got to go.

854
01:02:02,580 --> 01:02:05,480
You counted the minutes till you months till you got to go.

855
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:11,040
Then you have kids and then you wait for your kids to grow up so they can go and so on and so on and so on.

856
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:14,800
And it used to be a predominantly adult event.

857
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:17,160
Kids were why would you bring a kid?

858
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:21,420
And then then, you know, things like Nightmare on Elm Street happened.

859
01:02:21,420 --> 01:02:25,480
And if you during the 80s, Freddy Krueger was on everything but breakfast cereal.

860
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:27,400
I mean, he's a serial killer.

861
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:28,640
He kills children.

862
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:29,240
Right.

863
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:30,960
Here's a wacky toy of him.

864
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:32,040
Here's a doll.

865
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:34,760
Oh, so now Horace mainstream.

866
01:02:35,180 --> 01:02:37,640
Chucky is a literal doll that comes to life.

867
01:02:37,660 --> 01:02:43,460
So then we started seeing, you know, preteens, teens and preteens come to the park.

868
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:44,100
Right.

869
01:02:44,340 --> 01:02:46,260
This year, it's 2018.

870
01:02:46,660 --> 01:02:49,860
I've seen more strollers this year.

871
01:02:49,860 --> 01:02:50,400
Wow.

872
01:02:50,420 --> 01:02:51,720
Than I ever have.

873
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:53,680
And people are ridiculous.

874
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:54,900
I don't know.

875
01:02:55,220 --> 01:02:57,200
I've seen strollers and what are those things?

876
01:02:57,900 --> 01:02:59,260
The baby or something.

877
01:02:59,660 --> 01:03:00,820
I've seen those in the park.

878
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:06,200
But you know, I got to say every year since we started coming into it, we always see at least one stroller.

879
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:06,500
Yeah.

880
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:07,320
Which blows my mind.

881
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:08,220
And I always say the same thing.

882
01:03:08,340 --> 01:03:10,880
I go nothing says I love you like a lifetime of therapy.

883
01:03:11,240 --> 01:03:12,320
I'm telling you right now.

884
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:13,940
Yeah, these kids are fucked up for life.

885
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:20,520
They're stronger and hardened by the.

886
01:03:21,220 --> 01:03:23,780
You don't end up with three wimps like us.

887
01:03:24,460 --> 01:03:25,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

888
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:29,020
I think it might steal them up and you don't end up with Mike Scott's and Jason's.

889
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:30,040
Yeah, to a lesser extent.

890
01:03:30,260 --> 01:03:34,800
If we hadn't been scared shitless when we were babies, we would be fine now.

891
01:03:34,820 --> 01:03:36,700
We would have no problems psychologically.

892
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:37,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

893
01:03:38,140 --> 01:03:38,660
So.

894
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:40,240
Scare your baby is what we're saying.

895
01:03:41,300 --> 01:03:43,480
Get some chainsaws in your baby's face.

896
01:03:43,480 --> 01:03:44,800
Well, that's the other thing, too.

897
01:03:44,900 --> 01:03:49,380
I mean, for all those strollers we've seen, I've never seen one baby crying in that stroller.

898
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:51,300
Like for some reason, they're going to run.

899
01:03:51,620 --> 01:03:53,140
There's no concept going on.

900
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:54,300
Yeah, they don't know what's going on.

901
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:58,020
So, you know, maybe it is a good way to like slowly ease them into the hole.

902
01:03:58,280 --> 01:04:05,000
It might be an easier way to ease them into the state of the world, too.

903
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:05,680
Really?

904
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:07,560
Like, can't miss your future.

905
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:08,660
Get used to it.

906
01:04:08,940 --> 01:04:10,940
We're all living in a scary farm.

907
01:04:10,940 --> 01:04:11,240
Yeah.

908
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:13,960
Increasingly.

909
01:04:13,540 --> 01:04:16,540
Jeff, when did you come aboard the organization?

910
01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:18,880
I started in 1994.

911
01:04:19,100 --> 01:04:19,700
Wow, wow.

912
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:21,260
The family still owned the park.

913
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:23,720
It was a much different place to work for.

914
01:04:24,580 --> 01:04:32,260
The first scary farm I worked at, Scary Farm 94, I think it started the second or third week of October.

915
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:35,920
It only ran for about 10 nights or 11 nights.

916
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:36,520
OK.

917
01:04:37,360 --> 01:04:43,900
Because they just they didn't have any idea that people would venture out into a scary event earlier than that.

918
01:04:45,180 --> 01:04:49,240
The first haunt I worked, I worked at the Silver Dollar Saloon, which is on in Ghost Town.

919
01:04:49,240 --> 01:04:50,140
It's not a saloon anymore.

920
01:04:50,140 --> 01:04:51,200
Now it's a shooting gallery.

921
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:56,040
But we were the only safe place you could run to when the monsters got you.

922
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:59,000
We would be serving drinks and people would run in.

923
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:00,620
Oh my God, oh my God, save me.

924
01:05:00,940 --> 01:05:04,320
You're welcome to stay in here, but they're just going to come in here and get you anyways.

925
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:09,860
So what would happen is we'd have girls at the door peeking and monsters just going, waiting for you.

926
01:05:09,860 --> 01:05:12,160
I got all night.

927
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:14,120
Is he supposed to do that?

928
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:15,100
That's what we pay him for.

929
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:15,940
Yeah.

930
01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:17,240
Well, he's being ridiculous.

931
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:18,660
No, he's being a monster.

932
01:05:18,740 --> 01:05:20,200
And you came here to get scared.

933
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:24,200
You know, you know, it was a weird moment, you know.

934
01:05:24,340 --> 01:05:29,420
And the first few scary farms that I worked were in the Silver Dollar Saloon.

935
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:31,720
It was a weird, weird time.

936
01:05:32,080 --> 01:05:35,600
But I used to go watch there's a big show we do called The Hanging.

937
01:05:36,180 --> 01:05:37,240
And I used to watch The Hanging.

938
01:05:37,340 --> 01:05:38,240
I'm excited to learn.

939
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:39,660
I don't know a ton about The Hanging.

940
01:05:39,980 --> 01:05:41,040
It's a big pop culture.

941
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:48,940
It started out in the early days as an actual witch hanging where they would parade a witch through the town and she would be screaming.

942
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:50,460
You can't do this to me.

943
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:54,460
They'd get her up to the gallows, read the charges, put her in the noose.

944
01:05:54,500 --> 01:05:58,400
And then there'd be a big puff of smoke and she would turn into doves and fly away.

945
01:05:58,600 --> 01:05:59,320
Oh, OK.

946
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:05,680
We got nasty letters from all of the local witches covens saying that was terrible to do.

947
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:08,840
So then it got changed to we hung a gypsy.

948
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:10,320
Oh, OK.

949
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:11,460
But then?

950
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:15,000
Got the same letters without the return address.

951
01:06:16,940 --> 01:06:17,820
Ah, but a bunch.

952
01:06:18,540 --> 01:06:27,500
So the show eventually morphed into a pop culture celebration of all the people that entertained and irritated us over the years.

953
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:31,060
And I used to watch it and say, I could do that.

954
01:06:31,380 --> 01:06:32,220
I could write that.

955
01:06:32,300 --> 01:06:32,940
That's my dream.

956
01:06:32,940 --> 01:06:33,760
I'll write that.

957
01:06:35,060 --> 01:06:43,880
And a few years later, I got an opportunity after showing some writing samples and writing some peanuts shows for the park with Charlie Brown and Snoopy.

958
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:47,040
They said, you want to take a crack at The Hanging with the writing team?

959
01:06:47,040 --> 01:06:49,680
And I was like, that's all I've been waiting for.

960
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:57,020
So I got to exercise all of those weird demons of characters I wanted to see in the show and writing that kind of dialogue.

961
01:06:58,320 --> 01:07:03,980
The first year we did it, the Cripkeeper was in the show, the actual Cripkeeper from the TV show.

962
01:07:04,580 --> 01:07:09,160
And this was like this is this was a licensed situation.

963
01:07:09,220 --> 01:07:10,500
Yeah, yeah, we had the Cripkeeper.

964
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:17,480
So I got to write dialogue that was sent to New York for John Casir to read in the Cripkeeper voice.

965
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:19,720
I was like, that's the coolest thing ever.

966
01:07:19,900 --> 01:07:29,320
You know, and you know, we made it was a very elaborate puppet that would talk and we got to do all these jokes like, what the hell is that?

967
01:07:29,620 --> 01:07:31,620
It looks like Jim Henson took a crap.

968
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:34,340
But then he fights back.

969
01:07:34,620 --> 01:07:41,620
But it was great because I had grown up watching Tales from the Crypt and like, I'm writing dialogue for the Cripkeeper.

970
01:07:41,900 --> 01:07:43,160
That's cool, right?

971
01:07:44,260 --> 01:07:50,260
And then I've done a lot of a lot of writing over the years at the park, all kinds of hundreds of shows.

972
01:07:50,740 --> 01:07:55,760
I did shows in the Birdcage where it was like a melodrama of a mad scientist show.

973
01:07:56,120 --> 01:08:03,800
I did one that was a fake children's show called Professor Freak's Funhouse for Kids and then an asterisk that said not for kids.

974
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:14,820
Then I took over Mystery Lodge and we did two shows in there using that technology where you can really make the audience believe there's a ghost coming to get them.

975
01:08:15,060 --> 01:08:21,120
Oh, sure. Yes. Because if you don't know that show, that is the that that show is built on like the with the peppers.

976
01:08:21,300 --> 01:08:22,740
They use holovision. It's called.

977
01:08:22,940 --> 01:08:26,140
OK, OK. It's a very advanced version of that.

978
01:08:26,280 --> 01:08:34,600
And we did a show where I cast my daughter as a ghost and she interacts with the actors on stage.

979
01:08:34,680 --> 01:08:38,600
Things move and she ends up killing everybody on stage.

980
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:40,880
And then she turns to the audience.

981
01:08:41,320 --> 01:08:45,440
Now, you've seen Mystery Lodge. You're 15 feet from the stage.

982
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:49,360
And then there's a layer of glass separating you from the stage.

983
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:52,960
And then beyond that are the the ghost images in that.

984
01:08:52,980 --> 01:08:55,720
So it's what I mean is there's a big disconnect.

985
01:08:56,100 --> 01:09:01,500
Right. And then she turns to the audience at the end and says, now I'm going to play with all of you.

986
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:07,720
And we had grown men erupt and scream, you're not playing with me.

987
01:09:08,160 --> 01:09:09,960
We actually have it on tape.

988
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:14,060
Season pass. You have the audio of the guy screaming, you ain't playing with me.

989
01:09:14,700 --> 01:09:18,640
I sat with Doug and I said, I said, that guy right there is going to lose his mind.

990
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:22,120
And at the end he goes, you ain't playing with me.

991
01:09:23,980 --> 01:09:26,540
I like that phrase. Oh, it was great.

992
01:09:26,740 --> 01:09:29,660
If we were in there, would you have pegged any of the three of us as losing our minds?

993
01:09:29,940 --> 01:09:31,940
It depends on how you're acting, how you were sitting.

994
01:09:32,020 --> 01:09:38,940
OK, it's the people that are sitting really overly calm, trying to will themselves into being at peace.

995
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:43,140
And then the finale of that show was the exit. Excuse me.

996
01:09:43,420 --> 01:09:44,900
The pre-show doors opened.

997
01:09:44,900 --> 01:09:50,520
If you go through Mystery Lodge the traditional way, you go into a little room where you hear somebody talk and the doors open.

998
01:09:50,620 --> 01:09:51,820
Then you come into the theater.

999
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:55,880
We went in backwards. So you never went through the pre-show doors.

1000
01:09:56,240 --> 01:10:03,120
So at the end of the show, the pre-show doors opened and we had an oversized cutout of my daughter looking demonic.

1001
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:07,260
And the audience got to see that for about three or four seconds.

1002
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:10,980
And you hear people on all the videotapes going, oh my God.

1003
01:10:11,740 --> 01:10:18,200
And then we had 10 live monsters run through the audience and we had people lose their minds.

1004
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:21,960
It was a lot of fun. So I've done a lot of really cool things.

1005
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:28,400
Not to interrupt, but didn't you say on a couple of occasions instead of the cutout, you actually had Josie there?

1006
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:32,120
Yeah, there were a couple of nights that she wanted to because, you know, the images is not her.

1007
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:35,100
We filmed it on a green screen. So she was never there.

1008
01:10:35,680 --> 01:10:37,660
OK, she didn't have to do five shows.

1009
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:40,860
She was seven.

1010
01:10:42,680 --> 01:10:44,040
Not a precision performer.

1011
01:10:44,260 --> 01:10:45,360
That was a special effect.

1012
01:10:45,540 --> 01:10:48,820
Yeah, if you go on YouTube and type, not scary farm possessed, it comes right up.

1013
01:10:48,820 --> 01:10:50,060
Parks and cons put it up.

1014
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:56,800
But there were a couple of nights where the doors opened and instead of the cutout, it's actually her.

1015
01:10:57,280 --> 01:10:59,340
And those that had seen the show are like, oh, cool.

1016
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:02,780
And then she moves and steps off the platform.

1017
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:06,980
And that's where we had grown men running, running for the door.

1018
01:11:06,980 --> 01:11:08,600
Out of here. Yeah.

1019
01:11:09,500 --> 01:11:13,660
But no, scary farm is, in my opinion, the greatest event on earth.

1020
01:11:13,740 --> 01:11:15,020
It is so much fun.

1021
01:11:15,380 --> 01:11:21,500
I have had more memories created working this event than any other thing that I've done professionally.

1022
01:11:22,340 --> 01:11:24,900
Like we were talking, you get to terrorize people.

1023
01:11:25,480 --> 01:11:28,040
Look at me. I'm five, six, maybe.

1024
01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:34,360
I'm chubby. I look like Sean Astin in Stranger Things season two.

1025
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:38,000
Which has been pointed out like he got one on.

1026
01:11:38,100 --> 01:11:40,740
I'm like, seriously? He's an actor.

1027
01:11:40,740 --> 01:11:42,560
It was pretend.

1028
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:48,220
There are only so many eligible single people of age in the town of Hawkins.

1029
01:11:48,420 --> 01:11:48,880
That's right.

1030
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:52,380
And just to let you guys know, Jeff is like a diehard Winona.

1031
01:11:52,580 --> 01:11:53,580
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

1032
01:11:54,360 --> 01:11:55,280
Important context.

1033
01:11:55,680 --> 01:11:58,420
So I've gotten to do things here that are amazing.

1034
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:01,800
And then I'm probably most well known.

1035
01:12:02,100 --> 01:12:13,000
I came up with this concept for a maze called Trapped, which the idea was you would go if you go, you're going to go in a maze tonight and you're going to see that you're going in as a communal event.

1036
01:12:13,300 --> 01:12:17,880
You are going in with 20 other people and there's 20 people ahead of them and 20 people behind them.

1037
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:20,920
So you have to find your spots to get scared.

1038
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:26,660
Right. Trapped was you go in and the doors close behind you and you never see anybody else.

1039
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:28,400
From the public.

1040
01:12:29,380 --> 01:12:30,780
And you awful man.

1041
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:35,460
This is before the explosion of escape rooms.

1042
01:12:35,460 --> 01:12:40,840
There were other singular type attractions like that before us.

1043
01:12:41,060 --> 01:12:55,860
Trapped. What Trapped did was it proved you could do it on a large scale where you're funneling thousands of people through a night through these carefully orchestrated locked doors and and and tasks that you have to do.

1044
01:12:56,620 --> 01:13:00,760
And it culminated in Trapped year three was the last we did it for three years.

1045
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:04,600
The third year was my baby, me and Gus, the guy that you met earlier.

1046
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:09,040
We sat down and said, let's make the ultimate Halloween attraction.

1047
01:13:09,240 --> 01:13:15,780
Unlike anything we've ever done before, there were no ghosts, no goblins.

1048
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:20,240
It was all designed to really mess with you.

1049
01:13:21,320 --> 01:13:24,440
We had people lose their money and you had to pay extra for it.

1050
01:13:24,440 --> 01:13:30,420
It was $60 extra above the ticket price for a group of six to go in.

1051
01:13:31,420 --> 01:13:36,080
And if you didn't like if you didn't like what was happening, you had a safe word.

1052
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:41,360
Oh, if you said boysenberry, the attraction ended and you were escorted out.

1053
01:13:42,580 --> 01:13:44,720
And I'm you and all your party.

1054
01:13:44,820 --> 01:13:45,940
Everybody's out. Yeah.

1055
01:13:45,940 --> 01:13:48,620
So you are not a friend at the end of it.

1056
01:13:48,620 --> 01:13:49,160
Oh, wow. No.

1057
01:13:49,420 --> 01:13:50,080
Oh, 60 bucks.

1058
01:13:50,660 --> 01:13:50,900
Yeah.

1059
01:13:50,900 --> 01:13:53,500
Yeah. See, I'm naive.

1060
01:13:53,940 --> 01:13:56,300
I thought no one would ever use it.

1061
01:13:56,460 --> 01:13:58,080
I'm very cheap. Right.

1062
01:13:58,500 --> 01:14:04,020
I'm very if I spend $60 and it means getting hit on the head, I'm getting hit on the head.

1063
01:14:04,020 --> 01:14:06,460
OK, because I paid for it.

1064
01:14:06,620 --> 01:14:12,560
So the idea that somebody would come in and use the safe word, totally alien to me.

1065
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:14,280
And when they started, people would use it.

1066
01:14:14,340 --> 01:14:17,120
Really? You you you get you.

1067
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:19,080
I don't mean to personally. You guys went out.

1068
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:20,320
Oh, we have to get out of here now.

1069
01:14:20,460 --> 01:14:23,180
There's no refunds. We know we just went out.

1070
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:26,040
OK, cool. Hey, we're really works.

1071
01:14:26,160 --> 01:14:30,040
This thing really works. You know, we learned a lot of lessons.

1072
01:14:30,160 --> 01:14:38,160
Any other lesson we learned is that people want to have these interactive attractions up to a certain point.

1073
01:14:38,260 --> 01:14:44,640
Like in Trapped Year Three, you had to figure out how to get yourself out of handcuffs.

1074
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:50,440
You had to assemble a corpse to get a key from a clown.

1075
01:14:51,100 --> 01:14:54,260
You had to face absolutely nothing.

1076
01:14:54,300 --> 01:14:59,480
Yeah, right. You had to face a guy in a dress who eventually would put you under a bed,

1077
01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:04,160
a real bed that would then would open up behind and slide you into the next room.

1078
01:15:04,360 --> 01:15:06,620
Like we did stuff that was crazy.

1079
01:15:07,160 --> 01:15:09,680
It culminated in you had to drink urine.

1080
01:15:09,680 --> 01:15:12,200
Hang on. Oh, boy.

1081
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:22,660
We had a room that smelled of urine, was filled with jars of fake urine, and we would serve you apple juice with vinegar and salt served warm.

1082
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:28,400
No, I mean, it's not really urine, but that in and of itself is it's psychological.

1083
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:30,360
My wife almost puked. Yeah. Yeah.

1084
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:31,820
She's like, oh, wow.

1085
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:34,380
Yeah. But you drank the urine, Doug.

1086
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:36,660
Hell, yeah. Yeah.

1087
01:15:36,660 --> 01:15:39,360
Yeah. You're like that urine burns on the.

1088
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:42,340
Everybody would do these tasks up until the last task.

1089
01:15:42,700 --> 01:15:48,500
And the last task was there was a girl that you kept meeting in the maze who was lost.

1090
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:52,880
She had a Knox Berry Farm guest sticker on her.

1091
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:55,440
And she's like, I can't find my boyfriend.

1092
01:15:56,460 --> 01:15:59,460
And she'd go another way. And as soon as she went through a door, it locked behind her.

1093
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:04,600
Now, she's in on it. But people bought it hook, line and sinker that she was real.

1094
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:12,480
So at the end of the maze, she's in a noose and you get to pull the lever to hang her.

1095
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:20,260
And I thought, this is great. People are going to love this because it's not passive anymore.

1096
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:23,680
You're the bad guy. You're the villain. You're Will Smith.

1097
01:16:23,680 --> 01:16:28,120
And I am legend. Right. You're not the hero anymore.

1098
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:29,960
I'm the scaric. Yeah.

1099
01:16:31,340 --> 01:16:36,080
And was very ballsy of you guys, though, to set that all in Independence Hall.

1100
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:41,260
Very. I'm surprised you didn't get more flack from that.

1101
01:16:41,300 --> 01:16:43,740
Yeah. Well, it was a period piece.

1102
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:49,660
That means all the girls are bitchy.

1103
01:16:50,940 --> 01:16:51,780
All right.

1104
01:16:52,120 --> 01:16:54,000
Oh, did I find the line?

1105
01:16:54,860 --> 01:16:57,320
I found the line. OK.

1106
01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:03,440
So we had a lot of people that either boysenberry or simply refused to do it.

1107
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:06,180
Right. So it didn't matter what the outcome was.

1108
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:09,220
Somebody would pull the one of our people or would pull the lever.

1109
01:17:09,580 --> 01:17:12,160
And I mean, it was very graphic. You went through it, Doug. It was very graphic.

1110
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:16,340
And it felt like this is the end. Right.

1111
01:17:16,380 --> 01:17:20,000
And then the curtain would open and then we have enough nooses for your whole party.

1112
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:23,480
So you get up there on a platform.

1113
01:17:24,500 --> 01:17:26,440
There's a black cloth over your head.

1114
01:17:26,780 --> 01:17:29,100
There's a weighted noose on your head.

1115
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,620
The music builds and then the floor drops.

1116
01:17:32,820 --> 01:17:37,700
And we actually had people wet, pissed themselves, wet themselves.

1117
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:40,960
Yeah. Sure. Yeah. Wait, then what?

1118
01:17:42,340 --> 01:17:44,400
The end of the story isn't then they're dead.

1119
01:17:45,020 --> 01:17:47,800
So what mazes are we walking through? Yeah.

1120
01:17:48,780 --> 01:17:50,600
To cross one off the list.

1121
01:17:51,640 --> 01:17:54,020
The biggest compliment I got, and Doug knows where I'm going with this,

1122
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:59,140
is we sent Doug and team through with an audio recorder to record it

1123
01:17:59,140 --> 01:18:00,860
because we didn't allow any cameras in the maze.

1124
01:18:01,100 --> 01:18:04,280
We didn't want to spoil it for anybody that was going to pay the money for it.

1125
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:09,600
And Doug goes through the recorder and he had gone through the first two incarnations of the maze.

1126
01:18:09,700 --> 01:18:11,740
The first incarnation was about 17 minutes.

1127
01:18:11,980 --> 01:18:16,000
The second one, not so good at about seven minutes. Really short.

1128
01:18:16,580 --> 01:18:18,460
So I said we're going above and beyond.

1129
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:22,060
We're going to give the guests at least 20 minutes, maybe 25,

1130
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:26,400
which if you're under that kind of, because the maze wasn't about terror.

1131
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:29,680
It was about stress. We were putting you under duress.

1132
01:18:30,220 --> 01:18:35,160
You were very stressed out trying to figure out what they wanted from you to get to the next room.

1133
01:18:35,160 --> 01:18:38,960
And there were people yelling at you and you would have a success.

1134
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:43,060
And the very next room, there would be like a success is they hand you the keys.

1135
01:18:43,080 --> 01:18:44,280
You've done it. Here's your keys.

1136
01:18:44,280 --> 01:18:47,180
The next room is you're not getting out to you. Give me your keys.

1137
01:18:47,420 --> 01:18:49,540
And the next room is we need the keys. Where's the key?

1138
01:18:49,580 --> 01:18:51,300
And it was very designed.

1139
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:52,040
A literal nightmare.

1140
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:58,400
It was a nightmare of anybody who like, we stressed people out until they said, Boyzenberry, right?

1141
01:18:58,760 --> 01:19:02,560
So Doug goes through and I get out. I'm waiting for him at the end.

1142
01:19:02,700 --> 01:19:05,700
Like Mr. Rourke. How was it? How did you enjoy?

1143
01:19:06,340 --> 01:19:09,340
And Doug goes, Jeff, we got a problem here, man.

1144
01:19:09,740 --> 01:19:11,460
I'm like, Doug, what's the problem?

1145
01:19:11,740 --> 01:19:15,620
You said it was going to be like 20 minutes and it wasn't.

1146
01:19:15,740 --> 01:19:17,840
It was like 10 minutes. And we're what do we do?

1147
01:19:18,020 --> 01:19:20,160
I go, Doug, what are you talking about?

1148
01:19:20,340 --> 01:19:21,740
He goes, we were in there like 10 minutes.

1149
01:19:22,160 --> 01:19:25,020
I said, Doug, you were in there like 35 minutes.

1150
01:19:25,420 --> 01:19:26,940
No, we weren't. I said, you were.

1151
01:19:27,180 --> 01:19:29,980
I said, check the tape like in contact.

1152
01:19:30,300 --> 01:19:33,980
Check the tape. And it was and it confirmed you were in there for 32 minutes.

1153
01:19:35,260 --> 01:19:39,080
So it was so stressful. You were thinking like it was just so time.

1154
01:19:40,140 --> 01:19:44,060
It was just so tense. It was so engaging.

1155
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:50,500
And it just seemed like it like everything was so impactful that whole moment that it just it just flew by.

1156
01:19:50,700 --> 01:19:54,100
It just flew by. And then when we got out, yeah, I thought it was like a 10 minutes.

1157
01:19:54,180 --> 01:19:56,520
I'm like, this is I can't lie to my audience, man.

1158
01:19:56,520 --> 01:20:00,060
And then he was really concerned.

1159
01:20:00,060 --> 01:20:03,580
And I just didn't understand my because I'm watching Jurassic Park.

1160
01:20:03,700 --> 01:20:05,520
We have all the monitors of the maze.

1161
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:08,660
They're entering the pedophile paddock.

1162
01:20:11,580 --> 01:20:14,540
So like I watched the whole time. I'm timing it.

1163
01:20:14,660 --> 01:20:17,500
So it was really it was the ultimate compliment, the ultimate compliment.

1164
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:19,740
So, you know, long story endless.

1165
01:20:20,280 --> 01:20:22,520
I've had amazing adventures at Scary Farm.

1166
01:20:23,180 --> 01:20:29,180
And the weird part now is with we have new creative teams in place that I'm a part of.

1167
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:31,920
It seems like the best is yet to be.

1168
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:41,260
And then all the successes that we've had in the past are just the tip of the iceberg because we have people now that are telling us think outside the box,

1169
01:20:41,260 --> 01:20:46,600
find new ways to scare people, find new ways, like he said, to engage people.

1170
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:48,280
And that's where the future is going to be.

1171
01:20:48,280 --> 01:20:50,000
And I'm so excited to be a part of it.

1172
01:20:50,040 --> 01:20:57,380
And the team that I'm part of is just amazing because we have these think tank meetings where it's like nothing's off the table.

1173
01:20:57,720 --> 01:20:59,380
No, no idea is too crazy.

1174
01:20:59,380 --> 01:21:03,400
You know, and I'm like, I've been thinking about Scary Farm my whole life.

1175
01:21:03,420 --> 01:21:06,180
You know, I first went in 88 when I was 16.

1176
01:21:06,280 --> 01:21:08,080
So I'm ready, man.

1177
01:21:08,260 --> 01:21:11,420
There were ideas in the first year that I said, you're going to let us do that?

1178
01:21:11,540 --> 01:21:13,800
Oh, awesome. Really?

1179
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:14,280
Yeah.

1180
01:21:14,280 --> 01:21:25,720
Because at the finale of first year, we actually got morgue drawers and we pulled them out and put people in them and closed you up in a morgue drawer.

1181
01:21:26,360 --> 01:21:28,640
This is beyond the pale.

1182
01:21:28,640 --> 01:21:29,500
And a casket.

1183
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:30,260
And a casket.

1184
01:21:30,460 --> 01:21:33,120
This claustrophobic man got pegged to get into the casket.

1185
01:21:33,700 --> 01:21:38,380
And you went to like, wouldn't that have been, that didn't trigger you?

1186
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:41,540
Oh, no, I felt the boysenberry in the back of my head.

1187
01:21:41,900 --> 01:21:43,300
It was starting to move a bit forward.

1188
01:21:43,880 --> 01:21:46,020
But Jeff was with us and we were actually recording.

1189
01:21:46,160 --> 01:21:47,400
I'm like, I can't.

1190
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:48,520
You can't boysenberry out?

1191
01:21:48,900 --> 01:21:51,160
I can't purse out when I'm recording.

1192
01:21:51,160 --> 01:21:52,380
But like I was saying earlier.

1193
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:54,300
You've got to have that content.

1194
01:21:54,380 --> 01:21:56,160
How long did I lay in that coffin?

1195
01:21:56,160 --> 01:21:58,460
Oh, three or four long minutes in the dark.

1196
01:21:59,420 --> 01:22:04,580
There's a side that you find out on the side that you can actually get out of that coffin.

1197
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:09,500
I just laid there for like four minutes straight.

1198
01:22:09,780 --> 01:22:11,440
Jeff opened it up twice.

1199
01:22:12,100 --> 01:22:13,340
Dude, get out of here.

1200
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:15,960
I'm just like, I couldn't move.

1201
01:22:16,320 --> 01:22:19,760
And then finally Jeff opens up and goes, Doug, let's go to the left.

1202
01:22:20,440 --> 01:22:21,080
And he closes it.

1203
01:22:21,140 --> 01:22:22,980
And I'm like, oh, yeah.

1204
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:24,380
And then what was really cool is.

1205
01:22:24,380 --> 01:22:24,920
I did it.

1206
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,140
You guys would be a puddle at the end.

1207
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:28,940
Oh yeah.

1208
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:29,900
In the beginning probably.

1209
01:22:30,040 --> 01:22:34,340
You were led out to the arcade where there's a big sign that says I survived trapped.

1210
01:22:34,340 --> 01:22:34,880
Yes.

1211
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:37,840
And there's a guy taking a souvenir photo.

1212
01:22:37,900 --> 01:22:39,500
Everybody there's people playing video games.

1213
01:22:39,720 --> 01:22:40,960
The maze is over.

1214
01:22:41,440 --> 01:22:43,080
Except you're still in the maze.

1215
01:22:43,340 --> 01:22:46,000
So when he takes the picture, all the lights go out.

1216
01:22:46,080 --> 01:22:49,760
And the people playing video games turn around and they're in on it too.

1217
01:22:50,380 --> 01:22:51,780
Oh, it was fantastic.

1218
01:22:51,900 --> 01:22:56,000
There were so many times I was like, I can't believe they get to do this.

1219
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:57,620
This is great.

1220
01:22:58,220 --> 01:22:58,440
Geez.

1221
01:22:58,700 --> 01:23:00,360
Well, this is all crazy.

1222
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:06,920
But if I could pitch you an idea that is like the ultimate like, you know, just fear, psychological stress test.

1223
01:23:07,240 --> 01:23:14,880
If you could create an experience where somebody had to complete a four course meal at a colonial themed restaurant.

1224
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:17,760
In 15 minutes.

1225
01:23:18,260 --> 01:23:18,840
I'm waiting at the airport.

1226
01:23:18,860 --> 01:23:20,320
Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1227
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:21,640
People are yelling at you.

1228
01:23:21,640 --> 01:23:23,780
You have to be getting alerts about your plane.

1229
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:25,060
Red pudding is coming.

1230
01:23:25,340 --> 01:23:27,700
Isn't that one of the sequences in seven?

1231
01:23:27,860 --> 01:23:28,680
I mean, isn't that?

1232
01:23:31,020 --> 01:23:33,560
It would have to be an upcharge.

1233
01:23:33,960 --> 01:23:34,840
Oh, definitely.

1234
01:23:35,420 --> 01:23:35,740
$40.

1235
01:23:36,380 --> 01:23:36,560
Yeah.

1236
01:23:37,460 --> 01:23:40,760
Now, were you on a raised like dais or just at a table?

1237
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,860
Because in my head you're like on display.

1238
01:23:44,280 --> 01:23:44,600
No, no.

1239
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:45,920
It was a tiny table.

1240
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:47,460
Yeah, no.

1241
01:23:47,460 --> 01:23:49,940
That's how it felt like I was watching me.

1242
01:23:49,940 --> 01:23:54,820
But no, it was a tiny table in a crammed old timey hole.

1243
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:56,120
Have you ever seen this?

1244
01:23:56,120 --> 01:23:57,340
I forget when we talked about this.

1245
01:23:57,380 --> 01:24:01,980
This was if you missed this, this is a previous of Mike's Disney World Nightmare.

1246
01:24:02,420 --> 01:24:05,440
Yeah, I had I ate an all you can eat meal for four.

1247
01:24:05,780 --> 01:24:09,440
And also, like, because I was waiting 45 minutes, I forgot to say to get the table also.

1248
01:24:09,560 --> 01:24:10,740
So that cuts out my time.

1249
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:13,420
That was another vehicle to it.

1250
01:24:13,420 --> 01:24:17,100
At the door, the Rabinowitz family from Michigan is like, is that guy by himself?

1251
01:24:17,100 --> 01:24:17,640
Yeah.

1252
01:24:18,100 --> 01:24:19,220
We're waiting for a table.

1253
01:24:19,220 --> 01:24:21,040
Where is that older man's children?

1254
01:24:22,360 --> 01:24:23,400
Where are they?

1255
01:24:23,460 --> 01:24:27,920
But you were totally right when you said if somebody did that here in California, we wouldn't bat an eyelash.

1256
01:24:28,120 --> 01:24:28,200
No.

1257
01:24:28,340 --> 01:24:28,760
Yeah, no.

1258
01:24:28,860 --> 01:24:31,040
We'd assume he was a blogger of some sort.

1259
01:24:31,540 --> 01:24:32,260
Yeah, yeah.

1260
01:24:32,300 --> 01:24:33,180
Or a podcaster.

1261
01:24:33,400 --> 01:24:37,420
We automatically assume it's content for something that nobody would really do that by themselves.

1262
01:24:37,420 --> 01:24:39,300
No one enjoys themselves in this state.

1263
01:24:39,360 --> 01:24:40,560
We're all just making content.

1264
01:24:41,260 --> 01:24:42,540
Welcome to California.

1265
01:24:44,020 --> 01:24:44,820
What's up, guys?

1266
01:24:46,060 --> 01:24:52,840
Well, Jeff, thanks so much for being here and for sharing all this info about all the nightmares.

1267
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:53,260
Yeah.

1268
01:24:53,320 --> 01:24:54,780
Check out Knox.com.

1269
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:56,560
There's a scary farm link there.

1270
01:24:56,920 --> 01:25:04,380
Go on any social media and put in hashtag scary farm and you can see thousands of pictures of people being terrorized.

1271
01:25:04,420 --> 01:25:06,240
What a dream.

1272
01:25:07,460 --> 01:25:11,260
It brings a tear to my eye.

1273
01:25:12,460 --> 01:25:13,440
It's all I've ever wanted.

1274
01:25:13,940 --> 01:25:14,780
Well, yeah.

1275
01:25:15,220 --> 01:25:18,220
Thanks so much for having us and Doug and Robert.

1276
01:25:18,420 --> 01:25:19,460
Thanks for being here.

1277
01:25:19,640 --> 01:25:25,560
You all survived podcast The Ride, but not the audience yet because they aren't done.

1278
01:25:25,620 --> 01:25:26,980
We have more to say.

1279
01:25:27,180 --> 01:25:33,300
So we're going to take it back to us in the studio with the magic transporting safe word, boysenberry.

1280
01:25:34,360 --> 01:25:35,100
Boysenberry.

1281
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:41,320
Thank you, past us and past Doug, Robert, and Jeff.

1282
01:25:42,700 --> 01:25:47,920
Yeah, yeah, that was also that was a little under so they were you heard them chiming in a little bit.

1283
01:25:48,040 --> 01:25:51,380
Our friends now from the season pass podcast.

1284
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:53,500
So that's I mean, that's a pretty good history.

1285
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:55,160
There's a lot of history there of like knots.

1286
01:25:55,460 --> 01:26:05,080
And I honestly I didn't realize that all of like all of the influence knots has had just on Halloween in general and like expanding and how long Halloween lasts at these places.

1287
01:26:05,620 --> 01:26:10,200
And yeah, not not an innovator in a lot of ways that I don't think people always realize.

1288
01:26:10,200 --> 01:26:11,660
I don't think so.

1289
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:20,100
And we've we've talked about not very far before and we've talked about the the the mine ride and the and the log flume.

1290
01:26:20,100 --> 01:26:21,020
Yes. Over there.

1291
01:26:21,100 --> 01:26:29,160
And but Jason had not been on these rides and it was a pleasure last night to go on these to watch you go on these rides for the first time.

1292
01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:38,300
And there is so much undeniable influence on other rides on Disney rides in all of those super crucial.

1293
01:26:39,460 --> 01:26:45,840
Absolutely delighted by Calico mine train and the Timber Mountain log ride Halloween Hootenanny edition.

1294
01:26:46,240 --> 01:26:46,960
Yes. Yeah.

1295
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:53,960
Oh wait. Did you guys write down the details of who the like what was added to the the Timber Mountain?

1296
01:26:54,060 --> 01:26:58,160
Well, I mean, I have this stuff burned in my mind.

1297
01:26:58,160 --> 01:27:07,560
There was a Frankenstein there because this is a there was a sign on the outside that says like that there's a band because it's a Halloween Hootenanny that there is a band playing.

1298
01:27:07,560 --> 01:27:09,720
And I don't remember offhand the name of the band.

1299
01:27:09,900 --> 01:27:14,360
I looked it was we come around that corner so fast on the thing because I that's what I was looking at.

1300
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:15,540
I was looking at the drum head.

1301
01:27:15,680 --> 01:27:17,880
OK. And I was like, what's the name of that? We're gone.

1302
01:27:18,140 --> 01:27:19,880
Yeah. I wish I knew offhand.

1303
01:27:20,100 --> 01:27:22,340
I know. There was an alien.

1304
01:27:22,820 --> 01:27:25,380
Yeah. Little gray alien.

1305
01:27:25,800 --> 01:27:33,480
And then my favorite thing at some point, there's an animatronic bear who looks right at your log and goes trick or treat.

1306
01:27:34,040 --> 01:27:35,100
Yes.

1307
01:27:35,100 --> 01:27:36,680
That was so good.

1308
01:27:36,720 --> 01:27:38,120
And I didn't know it was coming.

1309
01:27:38,320 --> 01:27:40,180
He kind of talks right at you.

1310
01:27:40,180 --> 01:27:41,360
Yeah. So exciting.

1311
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:43,020
It was so delightful.

1312
01:27:43,380 --> 01:27:46,700
And also that log ride goes so fast.

1313
01:27:47,040 --> 01:27:47,560
Like we go.

1314
01:27:48,060 --> 01:27:49,760
Well, we that was a log of five.

1315
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:51,200
There was a three podcast.

1316
01:27:51,280 --> 01:27:51,640
Right.

1317
01:27:51,980 --> 01:27:59,160
And season pass size adults and one Jason sized adult in that log sitting in my lap sitting in Scott's lap.

1318
01:27:59,160 --> 01:28:00,540
Imagine that listeners.

1319
01:28:00,820 --> 01:28:02,260
The delight of that.

1320
01:28:02,260 --> 01:28:03,020
My lap.

1321
01:28:03,340 --> 01:28:04,920
Doug was in Robert's lap.

1322
01:28:05,060 --> 01:28:06,220
We were all this.

1323
01:28:06,420 --> 01:28:10,700
That was the ultimate crossover of groin groin.

1324
01:28:10,840 --> 01:28:16,680
Yeah. And then the final drop like you are you like don't see it until you're doing it.

1325
01:28:16,860 --> 01:28:21,120
It's a little bit of a bump there that almost launched me out of the law.

1326
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:23,260
He said, oh, geez.

1327
01:28:23,660 --> 01:28:23,980
Yeah.

1328
01:28:24,180 --> 01:28:30,360
So you I was in the back of the log and I heard you heard you exclaim because I don't think you realized it was such a big drop.

1329
01:28:31,420 --> 01:28:33,280
No, I got like it was at the bump.

1330
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:36,480
You were reacting to I see like maybe it was because I was the first one.

1331
01:28:36,540 --> 01:28:37,680
Like I really felt it.

1332
01:28:37,680 --> 01:28:39,680
But like it felt perfectly safe.

1333
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:41,580
It was just startling out of nowhere.

1334
01:28:41,680 --> 01:28:44,000
They're also like blasting a strobe light at you.

1335
01:28:44,140 --> 01:28:45,180
That was an interesting thing.

1336
01:28:45,260 --> 01:28:46,540
But I'd done the ride during the day.

1337
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:49,280
I didn't know how they modified it for Halloween.

1338
01:28:49,280 --> 01:28:51,360
And it's it's great.

1339
01:28:51,480 --> 01:28:52,640
It's it's it's a lot of fun.

1340
01:28:52,720 --> 01:28:54,980
I was expecting characters the whole time.

1341
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:55,140
I was too.

1342
01:28:55,200 --> 01:28:56,540
They haven't passed.

1343
01:28:56,840 --> 01:28:58,060
Have had them apparently.

1344
01:28:58,320 --> 01:28:59,740
Maybe not now.

1345
01:28:59,740 --> 01:29:04,260
After the first minute, I was like, seems like it's just going to be a delightful band friends.

1346
01:29:04,400 --> 01:29:05,840
So I like this.

1347
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:12,000
I think what happens because I've watched video with the characters, the actual human beings.

1348
01:29:12,320 --> 01:29:14,880
And the thing is, these these rides were not built for that.

1349
01:29:15,020 --> 01:29:19,920
So the only place I can put humans is in all are in all the exit like hallways.

1350
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:23,280
So it's like you can see where all the actors are coming.

1351
01:29:23,320 --> 01:29:29,300
There's no way to get like a really genuine scare out of people because they have to be too close to the water.

1352
01:29:29,300 --> 01:29:30,820
They're going to fall in the water.

1353
01:29:31,020 --> 01:29:33,180
They're like there's no it's really kind of pointless.

1354
01:29:33,180 --> 01:29:34,140
They tried it, I think.

1355
01:29:34,200 --> 01:29:36,420
And I think it seems like what's really the point of this.

1356
01:29:36,640 --> 01:29:37,860
So like maybe they were tired.

1357
01:29:37,960 --> 01:29:44,800
They have best characters, best used in other places like everywhere in the park, everywhere in the darkness.

1358
01:29:45,340 --> 01:29:49,300
Yelling at you through the fog, scraping the ground, scraping the ground.

1359
01:29:49,480 --> 01:29:55,900
We learned that they have metal on their knee pads and on their boots to like make these horrifying scraping sounds.

1360
01:29:56,220 --> 01:29:58,100
I got the name of the band for you here.

1361
01:29:59,280 --> 01:30:01,220
The Calico Coffin Creepers.

1362
01:30:01,220 --> 01:30:02,580
Delightful.

1363
01:30:03,220 --> 01:30:03,240
Yay.

1364
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:03,660
So delightful.

1365
01:30:03,660 --> 01:30:09,000
That's like the name of what would play a Monster Mash type song, a novelty song in the 60s.

1366
01:30:09,060 --> 01:30:16,360
The mind train too also like I think Robert pointed this out like this ride is grandfathered because you are so close to the walls and ceiling.

1367
01:30:16,380 --> 01:30:17,720
He was just touching the wall.

1368
01:30:17,720 --> 01:30:29,960
Because it's so and I was just the lighting in there and the number of the animatronics and just the scope of like this giant like is truly incredible.

1369
01:30:30,180 --> 01:30:36,560
That primary like so there's a kind of a room that you pass through on several in several different ways in several different layers.

1370
01:30:37,140 --> 01:30:43,040
This main big mine scene with so many animatronics, a jaw dropping amount of animatronics.

1371
01:30:43,040 --> 01:30:48,380
And I was saying to Jason, it reminded me a lot of the main room in the Indiana Jones adventure.

1372
01:30:48,640 --> 01:30:52,760
Yes, you get you pass through it this way and then weave into another place.

1373
01:30:52,820 --> 01:30:54,340
But then you're back in the main room.

1374
01:30:54,400 --> 01:31:01,860
But you're lower now and you can and obviously an influence on Big Thunder and obviously the log flume of the influence on Splash Mountain.

1375
01:31:02,260 --> 01:31:07,100
There's just so much Disney DNA there, which I'm sure Tony Baxter would tell you.

1376
01:31:07,560 --> 01:31:14,740
So I don't know if I feel like there are a lot of the important fans who have never taken the time to go to knots and you you can get a lot out of it.

1377
01:31:15,040 --> 01:31:17,040
But you get a lot to appreciate there.

1378
01:31:17,040 --> 01:31:18,580
Those two rides are really great.

1379
01:31:19,300 --> 01:31:24,880
And so, yeah, it was we were saying before, though, earlier, we toured two mazes with the lights on.

1380
01:31:25,040 --> 01:31:26,680
Yes, much like you do with Stranger Things.

1381
01:31:26,700 --> 01:31:28,620
And those are the two new mazes.

1382
01:31:28,780 --> 01:31:32,580
One's called Dark Entities and the other is called the Depths.

1383
01:31:33,320 --> 01:31:34,820
Yeah, talk about those.

1384
01:31:34,820 --> 01:31:36,340
So let's talk about those real quick.

1385
01:31:37,300 --> 01:31:41,980
The Depths is a it's aquatic themed.

1386
01:31:42,040 --> 01:31:46,780
You end up facing a sea monster kind of a Kraken thing.

1387
01:31:47,260 --> 01:31:53,280
Yeah, a bunch of miners unearth an ancient evil fish based ancient evil.

1388
01:31:53,280 --> 01:31:54,240
Even though it's a mine.

1389
01:31:54,640 --> 01:31:55,680
Yeah, it's fish based.

1390
01:31:55,700 --> 01:31:56,760
It's a seaside town.

1391
01:31:56,920 --> 01:31:57,100
That's right.

1392
01:31:57,160 --> 01:32:00,220
You enter the lighting effects where we're up and going for us.

1393
01:32:00,220 --> 01:32:08,400
But you enter like you enter a shaft like an elevator shaft and you're supposed to recreate the effect that you're leaving and going into a different room.

1394
01:32:08,420 --> 01:32:09,460
We didn't do that.

1395
01:32:09,460 --> 01:32:10,560
They don't have that working.

1396
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:11,980
OK, so we just walked.

1397
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:14,500
We just walked through all fine.

1398
01:32:14,540 --> 01:32:16,220
Obviously, all fine with me.

1399
01:32:16,300 --> 01:32:17,080
Lights on.

1400
01:32:17,100 --> 01:32:23,400
No scare actors because I remember we're so we're walking through this in my brain and I'm sure it's similar to your guys.

1401
01:32:23,460 --> 01:32:30,300
You're like, oh, I'm imagining I'm walking through this with people jumping out and I'm trying to remember things.

1402
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:30,980
I'm trying to remember.

1403
01:32:31,100 --> 01:32:35,060
This looks like a little cubby hole for a human to jump out at me.

1404
01:32:35,060 --> 01:32:36,780
And they're also showing us fun stuff.

1405
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:38,220
First of all, it is very cool.

1406
01:32:38,340 --> 01:32:39,420
It's cool to see the effects.

1407
01:32:39,460 --> 01:32:41,540
They have these big practical monsters.

1408
01:32:42,180 --> 01:32:43,440
They also spoiler alert.

1409
01:32:43,500 --> 01:32:45,420
I guess if you're going to nuts, they have.

1410
01:32:45,520 --> 01:32:49,080
Yeah, as we're saying, a giant octopus, they have this like I'm trying to remember.

1411
01:32:49,200 --> 01:32:50,280
Maybe that's actually the other maze.

1412
01:32:50,300 --> 01:32:51,340
They had that.

1413
01:32:51,540 --> 01:32:52,200
No, that's the other maze.

1414
01:32:52,200 --> 01:32:55,540
There was an alien head that pops through like a window at you.

1415
01:32:55,540 --> 01:32:56,740
This had like fish.

1416
01:32:56,740 --> 01:32:59,360
This had like fish monsters.

1417
01:32:59,940 --> 01:33:00,640
And yeah, you could go.

1418
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:04,880
It could show up at any one of three windows so people wouldn't know where it was coming.

1419
01:33:05,060 --> 01:33:05,380
Yeah.

1420
01:33:05,440 --> 01:33:06,880
So and there's a shark.

1421
01:33:06,960 --> 01:33:08,900
There's a crazy shark at the end.

1422
01:33:08,940 --> 01:33:09,200
Yeah.

1423
01:33:09,200 --> 01:33:11,400
Really bloody and like is giant.

1424
01:33:11,440 --> 01:33:13,120
Like it's very cool.

1425
01:33:13,700 --> 01:33:14,980
There were dozens and dozens of people.

1426
01:33:15,220 --> 01:33:21,500
And then there's so we're going through the depths and they're I'm trying to really keep a mental note of the scares for later.

1427
01:33:21,500 --> 01:33:23,200
Like because I'm like, I'm going to have to do this later.

1428
01:33:23,240 --> 01:33:24,240
You want to outsmart it.

1429
01:33:24,300 --> 01:33:25,400
And I'm going to outsmart it.

1430
01:33:25,480 --> 01:33:40,060
And the one thing that was disconcerting or the one thing that I thought I was not going to be able to do was that they explained there was this one room and that later there's going to be laser and fog, which is going to make it feel like or at least look like you're walking through water.

1431
01:33:40,500 --> 01:33:44,220
And they were like, there's going to be actors under the fog and lasers.

1432
01:33:44,220 --> 01:33:44,720
Right.

1433
01:33:45,160 --> 01:33:46,780
And I was like, oh, shit.

1434
01:33:46,860 --> 01:33:48,360
And it is legit.

1435
01:33:48,500 --> 01:33:50,080
I was like, that sounds awesome.

1436
01:33:50,400 --> 01:33:51,340
Oh my God.

1437
01:33:51,340 --> 01:33:54,960
I don't want to deal with this because that's terrifying.

1438
01:33:55,400 --> 01:33:57,380
And I don't like people I can deal with.

1439
01:33:57,480 --> 01:34:02,060
I think the people coming from the left or right ago, but I don't want a top or bottom scares.

1440
01:34:02,400 --> 01:34:03,300
That sucks.

1441
01:34:03,760 --> 01:34:09,240
But I was like, OK, so you got to remember they're going to be like walking on the ground when you're here later.

1442
01:34:09,560 --> 01:34:10,540
So we did that.

1443
01:34:10,540 --> 01:34:11,580
And then we did.

1444
01:34:12,140 --> 01:34:15,060
Wait, well, so what then did you do it?

1445
01:34:15,120 --> 01:34:17,340
Does that factor into the later story?

1446
01:34:17,560 --> 01:34:18,800
Well, yes, I did it.

1447
01:34:20,540 --> 01:34:22,260
And well, I'll get to that in a second.

1448
01:34:22,860 --> 01:34:29,540
There's a little more of an arc, you know, I'm trying to build a hero's journey really of me getting to go to the depths.

1449
01:34:30,860 --> 01:34:36,780
So then we did Dark Enities and it's like a very aliens type maze and then we're still going through the previews.

1450
01:34:36,780 --> 01:34:38,940
And that's very cool because there's robots.

1451
01:34:39,100 --> 01:34:41,600
They build a robot or two robots really.

1452
01:34:41,820 --> 01:34:43,700
And they're like old school 50s robots.

1453
01:34:43,840 --> 01:34:45,920
And there's a giant alien at the end of it.

1454
01:34:45,920 --> 01:34:50,020
And again, I'm like, OK, remember, the alien is here at the end.

1455
01:34:50,040 --> 01:34:51,420
He's going to be moving.

1456
01:34:52,460 --> 01:34:53,820
Giant puppet like giant.

1457
01:34:54,060 --> 01:34:54,780
Yeah, crazy.

1458
01:34:55,060 --> 01:35:00,060
I was kind of blown away that that even existed at not because I was like, this seems I don't know.

1459
01:35:00,120 --> 01:35:02,260
I don't know why I just didn't expect giant puppets.

1460
01:35:02,360 --> 01:35:05,300
Yeah, those everything we saw in that avenue was so impressive.

1461
01:35:05,460 --> 01:35:09,800
And again, this is made for like less than two months.

1462
01:35:10,060 --> 01:35:13,820
The attraction like and not I thought this was really clever.

1463
01:35:13,820 --> 01:35:17,820
The big billboard outside of not they listed this year.

1464
01:35:17,900 --> 01:35:19,800
They listed all the dates it was running.

1465
01:35:19,800 --> 01:35:25,760
And when a date like a day ended like you would write on a physical calendar, they put a slash through it.

1466
01:35:25,760 --> 01:35:30,900
So if you were driving by, you know, like only 15 days, there's only 10 days left.

1467
01:35:32,840 --> 01:35:37,380
So, yeah, so we so we did those two and it legit we got to walk through with one of the lead designers.

1468
01:35:37,380 --> 01:35:42,720
I think the guy from Dark Ennity's and you can hear again all this unseasoned pass where there's a live walkthrough of us doing this.

1469
01:35:42,720 --> 01:35:45,940
So go over there if you want more details about us walking through a thing.

1470
01:35:46,580 --> 01:35:52,420
And my concern about what the National Labor Relations Board would have to say about all Jason is a good runner.

1471
01:35:52,620 --> 01:35:57,460
Yeah, there's a theme of you like throwing people off all day at not yesterday.

1472
01:35:58,040 --> 01:36:00,180
They weren't prepped for the Witten wisdom.

1473
01:36:01,260 --> 01:36:04,020
Like don't make it sound like I'm just trying to derail.

1474
01:36:04,160 --> 01:36:06,320
So we like funny, funny, good jokes.

1475
01:36:06,520 --> 01:36:08,460
Let's let the listener decide.

1476
01:36:08,680 --> 01:36:09,360
All right.

1477
01:36:09,460 --> 01:36:10,140
Hey, you know what?

1478
01:36:10,220 --> 01:36:10,860
Fair enough.

1479
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:15,400
The season pass people like the listeners of the season pass might be more serious theme park fans.

1480
01:36:15,420 --> 01:36:19,040
So they're like, who is this guy and what does he think he's doing?

1481
01:36:19,160 --> 01:36:22,820
Well, we're we will be the bug main of their podcast.

1482
01:36:22,840 --> 01:36:24,940
We're the same ratio.

1483
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:25,640
Shocking.

1484
01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:30,440
I tried to go back and forth between jokes and then like a question I thought might be legitimate.

1485
01:36:30,760 --> 01:36:33,860
So we'll see how that goes into that too.

1486
01:36:33,940 --> 01:36:36,720
Look, I'm just being silly.

1487
01:36:37,060 --> 01:36:41,880
I guess I'll say here now that we went out for drinks for my birthday the night before.

1488
01:36:41,980 --> 01:36:42,600
Oh, yes.

1489
01:36:42,740 --> 01:36:43,980
This is a good context.

1490
01:36:44,140 --> 01:36:44,380
Yes.

1491
01:36:44,440 --> 01:36:44,700
Yeah.

1492
01:36:44,720 --> 01:36:55,480
So if you'll recall the I believe it's the Small World episode from last year, a similar thing happened where I was in a bad way.

1493
01:36:55,520 --> 01:36:56,200
Oh, yeah.

1494
01:36:56,300 --> 01:36:57,400
That was after your birthday, too.

1495
01:36:57,440 --> 01:36:57,840
Yes.

1496
01:36:58,060 --> 01:36:58,700
That's right.

1497
01:37:00,120 --> 01:37:13,360
So I you know, I had some french fries at Portillo's and I drank a lot of water and I sort of perked up once I was on microphone and but and then just did a marathon for hours and hours.

1498
01:37:13,380 --> 01:37:15,200
You were very concerned before this.

1499
01:37:15,260 --> 01:37:18,400
You're like, oh, it's going to be a probably a long day at nots like my birthday the night before.

1500
01:37:18,560 --> 01:37:19,520
I better take it easy.

1501
01:37:19,520 --> 01:37:21,520
There was a whole like discussion about it.

1502
01:37:21,520 --> 01:37:25,560
And then when we were talking at your birthday, it was your birthday was very nice, very low key, nothing.

1503
01:37:25,580 --> 01:37:25,960
Why?

1504
01:37:26,040 --> 01:37:28,680
The thing the closed place closed at midnight.

1505
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:38,480
And then like we hadn't talked for maybe 45 minutes and I was talking to other people that are and then it closed down and you walked over and I went, oh shit, he's really drunk.

1506
01:37:38,800 --> 01:37:41,420
And like you like you were like this.

1507
01:37:41,560 --> 01:37:43,860
Mike is always the arbiter of very.

1508
01:37:44,120 --> 01:37:47,680
No, you weren't as drunk as God is any given night.

1509
01:37:48,280 --> 01:37:50,100
I lost track of time.

1510
01:37:50,380 --> 01:37:51,800
It was I lost track time.

1511
01:37:52,040 --> 01:37:55,240
I at some point in the evening, I was like, oh, I close at midnight.

1512
01:37:55,240 --> 01:37:56,340
We got lots of time.

1513
01:37:56,620 --> 01:38:01,400
And then the more drinks I had, I was like, I time is moving weird.

1514
01:38:01,420 --> 01:38:06,340
And also like that night, there was like lightning strikes going on and like rain going.

1515
01:38:06,600 --> 01:38:07,260
So like great.

1516
01:38:07,520 --> 01:38:12,520
I was just I wouldn't have been concerned other than I knew that tomorrow was a long day.

1517
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:16,800
I bet you know, I'm a professional showed it up ready to work.

1518
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:18,180
No, I know I did it.

1519
01:38:18,180 --> 01:38:19,120
I texted you in the morning.

1520
01:38:19,180 --> 01:38:20,740
I was a little worried I was going to have to wake you up.

1521
01:38:20,740 --> 01:38:22,060
And you're like, I am showered.

1522
01:38:22,220 --> 01:38:24,480
Oh, can I read the texts you sent me at night?

1523
01:38:24,580 --> 01:38:28,880
Oh, yeah, I guess I said, Mike, some very aggressive.

1524
01:38:29,560 --> 01:38:35,560
I love you guys so much and I'm afraid to say it to Scott sometimes, but like I just think he's the best.

1525
01:38:36,780 --> 01:38:39,460
And haven't I complimented you enough?

1526
01:38:39,460 --> 01:38:39,800
Like,

1527
01:38:39,940 --> 01:38:45,740
for evidently not.

1528
01:38:46,360 --> 01:38:59,060
I guess I got an alcoholic and I had like I was that is that used up all my energy of like, I'm going to text Michael and I'm going to text my friend Lorraine who gave me a ride home.

1529
01:38:59,060 --> 01:39:06,080
I should also say I while walking up the driveway to get home, I ate it very hard.

1530
01:39:06,420 --> 01:39:17,440
I really attacked the ground and have a large scabbing gash on my arm and my right thigh is still occasionally in pain.

1531
01:39:17,960 --> 01:39:20,540
So I'm going in.

1532
01:39:20,540 --> 01:39:21,760
Happy birthday to you.

1533
01:39:22,320 --> 01:39:24,620
So I was ill Saturday morning.

1534
01:39:24,620 --> 01:39:25,680
I texted you.

1535
01:39:25,680 --> 01:39:29,280
In and out in and out of sleep on the drive down to not.

1536
01:39:29,440 --> 01:39:30,520
Yes, you've nodded off.

1537
01:39:30,660 --> 01:39:31,020
We were driving.

1538
01:39:31,300 --> 01:39:32,700
You were closing your eyes.

1539
01:39:32,700 --> 01:39:33,740
I was like, you asleep?

1540
01:39:33,780 --> 01:39:35,220
And you're like, I'll be fine.

1541
01:39:35,220 --> 01:39:43,620
As we're listening to the new Elvis Costello album, which to me sound I just chalk up to being dream music now.

1542
01:39:43,760 --> 01:39:45,500
Like you made it up.

1543
01:39:45,500 --> 01:39:46,200
There is no help.

1544
01:39:46,400 --> 01:39:47,120
There is no help.

1545
01:39:47,180 --> 01:39:47,400
Yeah.

1546
01:39:47,540 --> 01:39:47,700
All right.

1547
01:39:47,720 --> 01:39:51,840
So this is the text I texted you at like 1am and I said, did you make it inside?

1548
01:39:52,080 --> 01:39:53,460
And you said, yes, I'm good.

1549
01:39:53,460 --> 01:39:53,800
Period.

1550
01:39:53,800 --> 01:40:01,360
Thank you for your concerning, which reminded me of like the tiny, tiny, tiny for your concerning.

1551
01:40:01,640 --> 01:40:01,840
Yeah.

1552
01:40:01,840 --> 01:40:04,940
And then you said, this is just a demand or a command.

1553
01:40:05,280 --> 01:40:06,400
You're driving to not.

1554
01:40:06,520 --> 01:40:09,300
I'm still collecting myself, but I'll be good.

1555
01:40:09,720 --> 01:40:12,260
But I'll be good to go once I have a live mic.

1556
01:40:12,980 --> 01:40:16,220
And that was Jack was right.

1557
01:40:16,220 --> 01:40:18,120
Boats me on and I shine.

1558
01:40:18,120 --> 01:40:24,000
I was a little difficult getting out of the house and into a lift to your house.

1559
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:25,320
Taking a lift.

1560
01:40:25,540 --> 01:40:28,160
I still had the disease when I woke up.

1561
01:40:29,040 --> 01:40:32,760
So anyway, I do this like twice a year.

1562
01:40:32,820 --> 01:40:36,280
This is not I'm not like a problem.

1563
01:40:36,280 --> 01:40:41,220
Like, yeah, no, I'm not my full bottle of wine each night.

1564
01:40:41,720 --> 01:40:42,080
Yeah.

1565
01:40:42,940 --> 01:40:43,720
So, yeah.

1566
01:40:43,720 --> 01:40:44,980
So that's where you're coming from.

1567
01:40:45,200 --> 01:40:46,520
So I come in and hot.

1568
01:40:46,840 --> 01:40:53,240
So, yeah. So we do these two mazes and then we go and do what felt like six hours of interviews.

1569
01:40:53,740 --> 01:41:00,400
So then they're like they're basically saying then you're going to get to go out in the park and they're going to give you like this is great.

1570
01:41:00,460 --> 01:41:03,760
Like we're getting wristbands that are front of the line wristbands.

1571
01:41:03,820 --> 01:41:08,340
They're like so nice to do this for these guys and then for them to invite us.

1572
01:41:09,120 --> 01:41:15,200
So we go out in into the park and immediately we go to one of the mazes.

1573
01:41:15,360 --> 01:41:21,120
We were first the plan was kind of like maybe we have a drink, maybe we have a beer and then that eases us into it.

1574
01:41:21,180 --> 01:41:25,580
But it was like, you know, acceptable amount of an acceptable amount, one or two.

1575
01:41:25,800 --> 01:41:27,280
That's the way to drink.

1576
01:41:27,820 --> 01:41:31,060
Logistically, that did not really work.

1577
01:41:31,740 --> 01:41:34,220
Oh, you drink before we went into the park.

1578
01:41:35,200 --> 01:41:35,960
What do you mean?

1579
01:41:35,960 --> 01:41:40,860
Yeah, we were backstage and we had to go to our cars and that sort of thing.

1580
01:41:41,620 --> 01:41:43,020
So yeah, yeah.

1581
01:41:43,180 --> 01:41:46,820
So we saw they I think Jeff was like, well, the zombie one is right here.

1582
01:41:46,820 --> 01:41:48,600
You may as well go right here to the zombie one.

1583
01:41:48,600 --> 01:41:51,580
The only reason I got on, I was going to try to slip off.

1584
01:41:51,960 --> 01:41:54,460
I was the one I was like, he's going to peel off.

1585
01:41:54,600 --> 01:41:56,500
He's been telegraphing it all day.

1586
01:41:56,880 --> 01:41:59,940
Jason told me I will do one or two earlier.

1587
01:42:00,060 --> 01:42:02,520
So I was like, OK, Scott is going to leave quickly.

1588
01:42:03,060 --> 01:42:05,260
Jason is going to stay with for one or two maybe.

1589
01:42:05,300 --> 01:42:07,020
But then I don't know how he's going to get back because I drove him.

1590
01:42:07,020 --> 01:42:08,500
So he has to go with Scott if he's going to leave.

1591
01:42:08,620 --> 01:42:13,220
I felt more kind of when they're like, oh, we'll go to the zombie maze first.

1592
01:42:13,640 --> 01:42:16,100
In that one, you are given a gun.

1593
01:42:16,100 --> 01:42:19,100
You have to run the lunge at you.

1594
01:42:19,100 --> 01:42:21,420
You shoot a target and it'll fall back.

1595
01:42:21,420 --> 01:42:24,580
And I'm like that I am into that.

1596
01:42:24,920 --> 01:42:29,820
Although some of those zombies did not have targets, so they just kept coming regardless.

1597
01:42:30,560 --> 01:42:32,840
So it was like it was more of a maze.

1598
01:42:32,860 --> 01:42:36,840
I actually thought it was more of a game, but it seemed like just a maze with a gun.

1599
01:42:37,140 --> 01:42:39,340
Pretty much. And I didn't even check my score at the end.

1600
01:42:39,340 --> 01:42:40,880
I forgot that was a thing to be done.

1601
01:42:40,960 --> 01:42:43,920
Somebody said I had nine kills, but I got like a shot.

1602
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:45,740
A lot of the people on our side.

1603
01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:48,080
So I should have had more. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1604
01:42:48,220 --> 01:42:51,500
I guess I was just every which way.

1605
01:42:51,780 --> 01:42:56,220
And here's what I so I it's probably been a very long time since I've done anything similar to it.

1606
01:42:56,660 --> 01:43:03,480
Or amazing what I I was I was pleased that I never went like, ah, I didn't like Shree.

1607
01:43:04,320 --> 01:43:12,540
But what I what I decided to do kind of inspired by that now I've I've been doing Splash Mountain and I did that log flume last night.

1608
01:43:12,800 --> 01:43:14,620
And I did the Incredi coaster.

1609
01:43:14,760 --> 01:43:23,300
And I think I was I described previously that launch coasters like I get those like this weird shortness of breath or something that happens.

1610
01:43:23,300 --> 01:43:27,680
And I realized, oh, the way to overcome that is to like kind of project and yell.

1611
01:43:27,900 --> 01:43:30,080
And maybe that's how I get over it.

1612
01:43:30,140 --> 01:43:34,180
I combat that by just letting a big sound out.

1613
01:43:34,320 --> 01:43:37,360
And I decided to employ that in this maze.

1614
01:43:37,720 --> 01:43:45,600
So at every possible turn of a scare, I was just going, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1615
01:43:45,960 --> 01:43:48,100
And that I that did it for me.

1616
01:43:48,100 --> 01:43:59,480
It made me feel like I felt like a dog who is a little scared, but trying to going overboard to prove that, no, I own this.

1617
01:43:59,480 --> 01:44:00,880
This is my territory.

1618
01:44:01,480 --> 01:44:13,840
I was doing I I don't I was sort of doing a similar thing and I sort of settled into a rhythm of it later where it did feel like that you can kind of like take ownership of the of the situation a little bit.

1619
01:44:13,840 --> 01:44:16,320
You're like you're not you're not a victim.

1620
01:44:16,320 --> 01:44:17,120
You're going to come.

1621
01:44:17,220 --> 01:44:18,520
So I was like kind of commenting.

1622
01:44:18,520 --> 01:44:21,220
I was like sort of trying to be a little funny.

1623
01:44:21,520 --> 01:44:25,600
And then like when Robert would get scared legitimately, I'd be like, yeah, take that Robert.

1624
01:44:25,780 --> 01:44:28,380
Like I would I would say stuff like that and like trying to make Douglas.

1625
01:44:28,540 --> 01:44:32,620
So I'm trying to distract myself to some degree shaming our new friends.

1626
01:44:32,920 --> 01:44:33,740
It was such good nature.

1627
01:44:33,760 --> 01:44:35,840
It was good natured like the alcoholic joke.

1628
01:44:35,940 --> 01:44:37,320
You know, I wasn't being serious.

1629
01:44:37,380 --> 01:44:39,780
I didn't really want to see my new friend Robert get scared.

1630
01:44:40,340 --> 01:44:43,320
You know, I'm just razz and you're breaking balls.

1631
01:44:43,320 --> 01:44:45,800
That's what we do on podcast the ride.

1632
01:44:46,100 --> 01:44:49,720
You guys break each other's balls like the cellar.

1633
01:44:49,720 --> 01:44:49,840
Right.

1634
01:44:49,840 --> 01:44:52,760
Exactly like the dirty table.

1635
01:44:52,780 --> 01:44:53,980
Exactly like the great place.

1636
01:44:54,340 --> 01:44:55,000
The cellar.

1637
01:44:55,120 --> 01:44:56,940
We all did a set last night.

1638
01:44:57,300 --> 01:44:59,580
So we so we did this thing.

1639
01:44:59,920 --> 01:45:05,620
But to contextualize like Scott was saying how he reacts to this stuff when we were backstage scare actor.

1640
01:45:05,980 --> 01:45:08,200
We were all going to the bathroom.

1641
01:45:08,420 --> 01:45:13,860
And I was waiting outside and a scare actor went into the bathroom without his mask on.

1642
01:45:13,980 --> 01:45:22,820
And when we were coming out, he had the mask on and I looked away and I looked up and was startled by this monster coming out of a bathroom.

1643
01:45:22,840 --> 01:45:24,400
It was fully lit like backstage.

1644
01:45:24,720 --> 01:45:27,060
Fully lit office office building.

1645
01:45:27,660 --> 01:45:30,260
Monster casually walking out of a stall scared you.

1646
01:45:30,300 --> 01:45:34,620
So you know that the actual jumping and banging on a wall.

1647
01:45:34,700 --> 01:45:35,660
Yeah. And we were.

1648
01:45:35,660 --> 01:45:36,640
Look, there were people.

1649
01:45:36,880 --> 01:45:40,020
We saw monsters on their lunch break.

1650
01:45:40,180 --> 01:45:42,720
We saw the people behind the scenes.

1651
01:45:43,960 --> 01:45:45,820
I wasn't afraid of a monster eating a sandwich.

1652
01:45:45,960 --> 01:45:46,520
That was great.

1653
01:45:46,580 --> 01:45:49,560
I love that. I love seeing monsters eating under a tent.

1654
01:45:49,860 --> 01:45:51,120
And I said this on the show before.

1655
01:45:51,140 --> 01:45:59,880
One of my favorite Comic Con memories is seeing the Flash villain Captain Cold going to the bathroom like in a big parka going to the bathroom at Comic Con.

1656
01:46:00,060 --> 01:46:01,340
I love that.

1657
01:46:02,380 --> 01:46:02,620
So yeah.

1658
01:46:03,300 --> 01:46:05,080
So we went so we went to the zombie.

1659
01:46:05,120 --> 01:46:07,200
It was called Special Ops Infected.

1660
01:46:07,200 --> 01:46:12,560
And there's a cool part where you go through like kind of a subway car, which stressed me out because it's closer quarters than the rest of it.

1661
01:46:12,560 --> 01:46:13,720
But it wasn't so bad.

1662
01:46:14,140 --> 01:46:15,460
So we get out of there.

1663
01:46:15,960 --> 01:46:22,740
And my first feeling about it wasn't because I was hoping I was going to go through it and go not so bad.

1664
01:46:22,780 --> 01:46:23,700
You like this now.

1665
01:46:23,720 --> 01:46:25,500
I was hoping that was what was going to happen.

1666
01:46:25,660 --> 01:46:31,520
And it wasn't really it was more what you're describing where I was like, do I need this?

1667
01:46:31,520 --> 01:46:34,180
Do I mean it's like I like the subway car part.

1668
01:46:34,180 --> 01:46:36,380
But like the game wasn't that fun.

1669
01:46:36,380 --> 01:46:44,520
It wasn't that satisfying to blow away zombies because it's like they're humans and they're trying to pretend but they're not going to fling themselves against walls over and over again.

1670
01:46:44,780 --> 01:46:47,360
So like we got out there and I was like, OK, I don't know.

1671
01:46:47,720 --> 01:46:48,720
I want to do more.

1672
01:46:48,880 --> 01:46:52,960
But I had the same feeling of like, why do I need this necessarily?

1673
01:46:53,020 --> 01:46:55,420
But then then we said, let's go get a drink.

1674
01:46:55,780 --> 01:47:00,860
I don't know what restaurant it was, but it had a giant two giant pictures of Mr.

1675
01:47:00,920 --> 01:47:01,280
and Mrs.

1676
01:47:01,460 --> 01:47:02,120
Not on the wall.

1677
01:47:02,460 --> 01:47:03,580
Walter and Cordelia.

1678
01:47:03,840 --> 01:47:04,760
Walter and Cordelia.

1679
01:47:05,060 --> 01:47:05,740
Regular pictures.

1680
01:47:05,840 --> 01:47:07,500
Their eyes did not follow you anywhere.

1681
01:47:07,580 --> 01:47:08,180
Right.

1682
01:47:08,800 --> 01:47:09,500
So we did that.

1683
01:47:09,540 --> 01:47:11,640
And then we went on those two dark rides that we mentioned.

1684
01:47:11,640 --> 01:47:12,160
Yeah.

1685
01:47:12,160 --> 01:47:15,680
And at that point, we got the he tapped out.

1686
01:47:15,680 --> 01:47:22,440
Jason and Mike tapped out because as we were in line for we all had one beer.

1687
01:47:22,440 --> 01:47:24,660
Some people got back in line for that too.

1688
01:47:24,780 --> 01:47:27,560
And I leaned over to Mike and went, I think I'm crashing.

1689
01:47:27,800 --> 01:47:33,380
I have the shivers like when I start to get real tired, I start to like you have the disease earlier.

1690
01:47:33,740 --> 01:47:34,100
I had the disease.

1691
01:47:34,460 --> 01:47:35,400
I have the shivers.

1692
01:47:37,100 --> 01:47:43,680
Sometimes this happens after a comedy where it's just like, oh, the adrenaline is wearing off and I am crashing.

1693
01:47:44,060 --> 01:47:51,080
And like certainly after hours of podcasting when I was not 100 percent and then being scared.

1694
01:47:51,080 --> 01:47:52,620
I mean, we went through scare zones.

1695
01:47:52,920 --> 01:47:56,920
I didn't know they were so dark, but that it's also very crowded.

1696
01:47:57,400 --> 01:48:00,320
But the scare actors get in between the crowds.

1697
01:48:00,560 --> 01:48:03,600
But there's also a lot of teens there doing teen bits.

1698
01:48:03,940 --> 01:48:07,940
And I'm like, is that a teen goofing or is that a ghoulie or a goblin?

1699
01:48:08,200 --> 01:48:10,820
So I was you clutched my arm at one point.

1700
01:48:11,240 --> 01:48:13,240
That was adorable.

1701
01:48:13,440 --> 01:48:15,560
That is any time I've had to go through a haunted house.

1702
01:48:15,640 --> 01:48:16,640
Like I think I did that.

1703
01:48:16,640 --> 01:48:19,300
There was like a haunted house at like a school dance once.

1704
01:48:19,380 --> 01:48:24,200
And I was like clutching the arm of like a teacher or a friend.

1705
01:48:24,260 --> 01:48:25,380
Like it was embarrassing.

1706
01:48:25,380 --> 01:48:27,500
I went in the house of horrors a couple of years ago.

1707
01:48:27,500 --> 01:48:30,880
I told it on the show with my friend at Universal before they got rid of it, obviously.

1708
01:48:31,180 --> 01:48:33,260
And I was just embarrassing.

1709
01:48:33,400 --> 01:48:36,680
I was dodging and making weird noises.

1710
01:48:36,860 --> 01:48:40,100
And especially when I was a kid and we went, I went through like a very mild version of it.

1711
01:48:40,100 --> 01:48:42,560
And it was just I couldn't I couldn't deal with it.

1712
01:48:42,560 --> 01:48:46,960
Like what we were saying, and they have these they were telling us that they have like metal on their shin,

1713
01:48:47,260 --> 01:48:50,920
like or their knee pads and their shoes to make like a louder noise.

1714
01:48:51,100 --> 01:48:53,580
So they're encouraged to slide and make these.

1715
01:48:53,580 --> 01:48:55,640
Yeah. And it's it's very effective.

1716
01:48:56,080 --> 01:48:59,140
But it's kind of hard to tell where it's coming from, but it's very unnerving.

1717
01:48:59,220 --> 01:49:00,800
And they'll just pop up at you.

1718
01:49:01,040 --> 01:49:06,500
That didn't bother me so much as that actually didn't bother me as much as I thought it would.

1719
01:49:06,740 --> 01:49:08,500
Because there's so many people around.

1720
01:49:08,500 --> 01:49:13,160
And even though there's like a giant scary masked person, like it's not close quarters.

1721
01:49:13,280 --> 01:49:16,140
The close quarters, I think, is the thing that especially freaks me out about it.

1722
01:49:16,460 --> 01:49:18,420
So like that, I didn't mind as much.

1723
01:49:18,700 --> 01:49:20,460
So we get on those those two rides.

1724
01:49:20,840 --> 01:49:27,080
And I will say that I was I was feeling what your I was tired and the first maze didn't do much for me.

1725
01:49:27,400 --> 01:49:33,860
But when we went on those two dark rides and the lighting, that's a really nice, beautiful, cool looking piece of real estate.

1726
01:49:34,040 --> 01:49:37,420
All of the other that whole area is so great.

1727
01:49:37,500 --> 01:49:41,060
And after we got off the log ride, I was feeling very good again.

1728
01:49:41,060 --> 01:49:44,340
And I felt really like we got it. I got to do it.

1729
01:49:44,800 --> 01:49:53,520
So you guys. So we talked about it, especially once once they reminded us like, oh, yeah, don't forget this park has multiple entrances and excellent.

1730
01:49:53,600 --> 01:49:56,340
You can go out the back right, right around the corner.

1731
01:49:56,340 --> 01:50:00,680
And we're like, great, because that part of the park has a lot of attractions.

1732
01:50:00,800 --> 01:50:04,600
So there's not a lot of scares back there because they need to get people on and off those.

1733
01:50:04,600 --> 01:50:07,380
We didn't see anybody on the way out. See anyone.

1734
01:50:08,160 --> 01:50:11,300
So we some. Yeah, some zones don't have much.

1735
01:50:11,540 --> 01:50:14,780
And then we went through his own later and it was like clowns everywhere.

1736
01:50:15,160 --> 01:50:17,940
And like there was not many there were not many people around.

1737
01:50:18,200 --> 01:50:20,320
We almost went on hang time, the roller coaster.

1738
01:50:20,440 --> 01:50:26,100
We almost did it. But we were sort of running out of time and I had to come back at a certain point.

1739
01:50:26,220 --> 01:50:31,120
I couldn't be a hero all night. I want to go back to I want to do a full day there and get the full experience.

1740
01:50:31,120 --> 01:50:35,820
I mean, hang time seems cool. I would I'm so psyched to do those rides again.

1741
01:50:36,160 --> 01:50:39,860
Not to Mary Farm is coming up, which again, that just sounds delightful.

1742
01:50:39,920 --> 01:50:43,500
We should tease it at the end, but we will be back for the Boys and Berry Festival.

1743
01:50:43,640 --> 01:50:48,560
I think we can confirm this now. A tease that is going to be very exciting listeners,

1744
01:50:48,560 --> 01:50:50,660
but we will be back for Nats Berry Farms.

1745
01:50:50,760 --> 01:50:55,360
Everybody's got the shivers at home now and the disease and the disease.

1746
01:50:55,640 --> 01:50:57,840
So the next thing so Doug is like, you got to go on Dark Ride.

1747
01:50:57,940 --> 01:51:03,620
You got to go in Dark Ride maze. And I was like, OK, because at first it sounded like we were going to just do the other two mazes and then go home,

1748
01:51:03,640 --> 01:51:06,860
because that's sort of what we were discussing. Doug's like, you know, you got to do Dark Ride.

1749
01:51:06,960 --> 01:51:14,380
It's like an old carnival that shut down. And I was like, OK, so we go in Dark Ride and there's a lot of clowns on Dark Ride.

1750
01:51:14,660 --> 01:51:21,500
And we go through Dark Ride and I'm still feeling the same way I was feeling about the zombie one where it's like, I don't know, people are jumping.

1751
01:51:21,580 --> 01:51:27,980
And you get to the last room and there's a big kind of clown, almost like Joker style, like, you know, an old carnival.

1752
01:51:28,080 --> 01:51:32,100
It's been converted into the lair. And I remember going, OK, this is kind of cool.

1753
01:51:32,140 --> 01:51:38,740
I kind of like this. And it's again open air, which is I think a big deal, like not feeling like you're claustrophobic.

1754
01:51:38,820 --> 01:51:45,420
So we left that. We then it's clear like Doug is trying to very Doug is a very nice man, but he's trying to get me to go on all of them.

1755
01:51:45,420 --> 01:51:49,800
And then I'm like, OK, you know, you can do this. You can. It's fine. You made it through to.

1756
01:51:49,800 --> 01:51:54,500
We go into Shadowlands and Shadowlands here. I'll show you the art of it. Cool.

1757
01:51:54,600 --> 01:51:57,140
It's kind of cool. Like, oh, yeah, it's a whole different.

1758
01:51:57,300 --> 01:52:04,220
It's like a samurai motif. And it's like there's like zombie geishas and like guys with big swords.

1759
01:52:04,720 --> 01:52:08,460
And we're getting better. I'm get I can feel I'm getting better on it.

1760
01:52:08,460 --> 01:52:11,780
So I'm walking through and I'm like, oh, this is cool. The art direction is kind of cool.

1761
01:52:11,820 --> 01:52:14,000
And there's some like interesting things.

1762
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:22,220
And I actually kind of look at a person that's trying to scare me for the first time as opposed to like darting my like, I don't want to even look at what you're doing.

1763
01:52:22,360 --> 01:52:27,600
And then you start to be like, OK, maybe I'll just look at the actor and go, oh, yeah, you're like 28.

1764
01:52:28,020 --> 01:52:31,800
Like I can like maybe then it'll start. So I'm starting the wheels of motion.

1765
01:52:31,880 --> 01:52:37,600
Now, I don't fully love Shadowlands. I'm not fully like enjoying it, but I'm like I can feel it getting better.

1766
01:52:38,380 --> 01:52:41,940
So we go over to I forget the order.

1767
01:52:41,960 --> 01:52:48,120
We go and do the depths. Yes, we went to earlier in the day and we went through it.

1768
01:52:48,120 --> 01:52:51,920
And I knew where all the scares were, which was good.

1769
01:52:52,020 --> 01:52:59,380
Very good. And we get to that room with with what I was saying with the water and the lasers to make it look like you're walking through water.

1770
01:52:59,680 --> 01:53:05,040
And I see there's just hands coming up through the fog.

1771
01:53:05,420 --> 01:53:11,820
No, no, no. And the thing is, though, once I got through the room, I was like, OK, yeah, no one's going to grab you because they can't.

1772
01:53:11,980 --> 01:53:21,660
They can't. Yeah. So once I got through the room, I was like, like, by the way, that's the first maybe the first time where I was clear headed enough to be like, this is awesome.

1773
01:53:22,020 --> 01:53:30,820
Like it is a truly very cool visual thing. There's like weird hands like fishy hands coming up through the through the water.

1774
01:53:30,940 --> 01:53:36,400
And I'm like, all right, that's cool. So then we go into dark entities and dark entities.

1775
01:53:36,520 --> 01:53:41,800
We saw with the lights on dark entities with the lights off is awesome.

1776
01:53:42,200 --> 01:53:48,740
Like the lights because they were saying it's 12000 like it's like quadruple the amount of lights they have in a normal maze.

1777
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:52,260
So it looks like an alien ship and the robot is working.

1778
01:53:52,260 --> 01:54:08,000
The robot is talking. I walk in there and I feel the first time in these mazes, I feel some joy coming from like my brain for the first not that I didn't like appreciate the lab, the depths, because I was like, the depths is cool.

1779
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:13,060
I like the effects of ship rocks. I get on dark entities and I go, this is cool.

1780
01:54:13,180 --> 01:54:17,580
So the robot, there's this 50s style robot and you see another version of it later.

1781
01:54:18,120 --> 01:54:26,000
And we walk through there and I was like, this is awesome. This legit. And it's there was still scares. I still was like, oh, like a lot of times.

1782
01:54:26,360 --> 01:54:34,760
But then I'm like, okay, I got this. Yeah, you're doing it. And then it's like this feeling of like riding a bike or something like I'm like, I think maybe I'm good.

1783
01:54:34,800 --> 01:54:40,840
Maybe this is good now. So then the last one we did was see it's called paranormal ink.

1784
01:54:40,880 --> 01:54:52,400
And again, this is spoilers for if you want to go. And it's very much like paranormal activity, like like hospital with people that are tortured by ghosts or whatever.

1785
01:54:52,700 --> 01:54:56,720
So they have a whole pre show now. So this is the final thing I did. This is the final thing we did.

1786
01:54:57,200 --> 01:55:05,780
They have a whole pre show of like a fake show. That's a paranormal investigation show. So now it's even more like a theme park ride. They have a pre show video.

1787
01:55:05,780 --> 01:55:12,200
Oh, I should mention too. There were like video displays in that alien ship too, with clearly like people that were there.

1788
01:55:12,840 --> 01:55:18,740
And all that stuff is very cool and makes you feel very it makes it so much more immersive. So let me go to paranormal ink.

1789
01:55:19,220 --> 01:55:27,100
And there's a whole pre show with like a girl who's showing like I'm on this show and I'm talking to this and that's very fun. And then something goes wrong. I'm like ghost.

1790
01:55:27,840 --> 01:55:34,520
So so Robert, I think goes, hey, look up there. So I look up there and there's a really cool video effect of like a girl appearing in this glass.

1791
01:55:34,700 --> 01:55:44,120
And all of a sudden, the girl breaks through the glass and on a wire, she shoots across the ceiling. And I was like, whoa.

1792
01:55:44,360 --> 01:55:48,320
And I wasn't it wasn't it was far enough away where I wasn't like scared. I was like, this is awesome.

1793
01:55:48,580 --> 01:55:54,660
So then we went through this paranormal, which is like you're going through an asylum and I'm leaving out so many details.

1794
01:55:54,680 --> 01:56:01,460
You can look at all these on YouTube. But the coolest thing I think that was that the last.

1795
01:56:01,460 --> 01:56:05,560
So you go to the hospital, people scaring you, you're going through like people in hospital beds and stuff.

1796
01:56:05,800 --> 01:56:13,520
The last section is a long corridor in a hospital and it flashes back and forth.

1797
01:56:13,560 --> 01:56:21,200
Somehow I do not know how it how they do it. You'll be walking down a regular hallway and then a flash of light and a noise.

1798
01:56:21,680 --> 01:56:26,460
And it's like you see through the walls and it's hell. And there's monsters.

1799
01:56:26,460 --> 01:56:31,660
There's a giant monster. And then the flash happens again and you're back in a normal hallway.

1800
01:56:31,860 --> 01:56:41,760
And I was like, holy shit. Like I and like that was legit is cool of an effect on any ride that I ever see.

1801
01:56:41,980 --> 01:56:48,500
Like any like seeing like Shanghai pirates where he kept and Jack turns into a skeleton or something, stuff like that.

1802
01:56:48,500 --> 01:56:53,800
Legit. I was like, I don't know how this is happening. I'm in the middle of this. This is awesome.

1803
01:56:53,800 --> 01:57:01,580
So like we left on a high note and I truly felt so it's so embarrassing how triumphant I felt.

1804
01:57:01,800 --> 01:57:10,440
Sure. Doing six mazes. And then I do think they were stacked almost in the perfect way to like the stuff that I would really be like interested.

1805
01:57:10,440 --> 01:57:17,620
Like I love alien shit and like and then ending with probably maybe the most most spectacular of all the illusions and all these mazes.

1806
01:57:17,820 --> 01:57:21,320
And then by then you could just appreciate that aspect of it and not be freaked out.

1807
01:57:21,600 --> 01:57:29,780
Yes. So like I kind of that's why I'm saying like I would like I probably will try to go to Horror Nights before the season's over.

1808
01:57:29,840 --> 01:57:34,120
I kind of wouldn't mind going back to Knott's and doing because we did a lot of podcasting,

1809
01:57:34,120 --> 01:57:39,600
but it would be kind of fun now to go back and just do the night and have a good have a good time with it.

1810
01:57:40,020 --> 01:57:44,460
So I yeah, it was great. Honestly, by the end I was like these are great.

1811
01:57:45,100 --> 01:57:49,860
I don't know if I love those first few as much. But yeah, so go to Knott's if you're around.

1812
01:57:49,920 --> 01:57:53,980
It's fun. There's a lot of teens, you know, there's some of that.

1813
01:57:54,020 --> 01:57:57,500
But I I I'm in I am a haunt guy. Yeah.

1814
01:57:57,580 --> 01:58:02,520
The biggest fear still is the presence of course. But besides that.

1815
01:58:02,900 --> 01:58:08,380
And I just mean they we get into this a little on the season past podcast, but it is not.

1816
01:58:08,380 --> 01:58:15,120
He's like essentially a neat they refer to it as a neighborhood park because there's like houses so close.

1817
01:58:15,120 --> 01:58:19,140
Right. And it is very intimate, very small.

1818
01:58:19,640 --> 01:58:29,160
And, you know, they have talked about like we have to get creative because we don't have like the insane budgets that like Disney and Universal do.

1819
01:58:29,420 --> 01:58:38,920
But they've got very cool people working there and they do have some money and there is some like very cool stuff going on down there.

1820
01:58:38,920 --> 01:58:40,320
There are normals, especially that one.

1821
01:58:40,320 --> 01:58:45,200
And that one's the most popular for that reason, I would assume. But like the money went into that.

1822
01:58:46,020 --> 01:58:54,340
And like there is yeah, they are still pulling stuff off there that like you would think a place with a bigger budget would have would only be able to do so.

1823
01:58:54,480 --> 01:59:05,640
Yeah. Also at Halloween, they put the Charlie Brown characters into costumes such as one of them in a Frankenstein head and Snoopy and like a sheet.

1824
01:59:06,480 --> 01:59:12,620
And I think that's great, too. I just want to give some vocal some air time to that.

1825
01:59:13,280 --> 01:59:16,720
Yeah. Look, you said it on the show yesterday. I think you said on the season pass.

1826
01:59:17,060 --> 01:59:22,840
We can't remember what was going where. No idea. But yeah, that is look, I love the peanuts.

1827
01:59:23,260 --> 01:59:26,100
I love them with the costumes on, too. So, yeah, I get what you're saying.

1828
01:59:26,700 --> 01:59:28,940
That's what you get. All the flavors and that's for everybody.

1829
01:59:28,980 --> 01:59:35,740
I also want to say and I this is just a thing that like I love and I talk about all the time.

1830
01:59:36,660 --> 01:59:50,920
If you trend, if your taste trends more towards the whimsical part of Halloween and you are in Los Angeles, the local haunt Boney Island, which is a bunch of delightful skeletons doing fun tricks.

1831
01:59:50,920 --> 01:59:56,840
And there's a little water show used to be in someone's yard in Sherman Oaks.

1832
01:59:56,860 --> 02:00:00,320
And then that got to it got too big and too popular.

1833
02:00:00,320 --> 02:00:06,100
And they took last year off as they kind of like had to reset and figure out what they were going to do this year.

1834
02:00:06,100 --> 02:00:12,660
It is in a section of Griffith Park and it is bigger and there is like a nominal admission fee.

1835
02:00:12,720 --> 02:00:15,120
But I'm so happy it's back. I'm so happy to go.

1836
02:00:15,120 --> 02:00:26,540
I believe it's also right next to the ghost train, which is another fun, like whimsical thing that I know our past guests, Justin Michael and Mr. Strickland are big fans of.

1837
02:00:27,460 --> 02:00:32,260
These are very different and family friendly that like, say, the haunted hayride.

1838
02:00:32,260 --> 02:00:36,500
I was that scary. Maybe I'll conquer the haunted hayride.

1839
02:00:36,640 --> 02:00:42,200
That is, I think, yes, supposed to be scary. There's a limit for me here as far as being able to do scary stuff.

1840
02:00:42,200 --> 02:00:48,640
So, yeah, you're no longer what is it? You're a no, you were a no fright queen.

1841
02:00:48,780 --> 02:00:52,320
No fright queen, but I'm now a fright. You're a fright queen.

1842
02:00:53,020 --> 02:00:55,740
Yeah. Yeah. So yeah, Boney Island and Ghost Train.

1843
02:00:56,400 --> 02:01:02,440
I'm excited to to check those out this year. We're not being paid to say that.

1844
02:01:02,720 --> 02:01:05,020
No, yeah, we're not being paid to say any of this. We're not.

1845
02:01:05,200 --> 02:01:09,600
But all these places gave us things and keep giving us things.

1846
02:01:09,920 --> 02:01:14,900
Sure. Please. And I hope you're all happy for us listening that we got the thing.

1847
02:01:15,020 --> 02:01:23,620
Yes. Are you happy for us? Let us know in the comments if you could both say that Michael Carlson, you survived podcast ride while you look at my eyes.

1848
02:01:23,720 --> 02:01:26,900
That would be really good. Michael Carlson. Both at the same time.

1849
02:01:27,080 --> 02:01:30,640
How do you look at both of us, though? All right. Well, just shift back and forth.

1850
02:01:31,560 --> 02:01:36,320
Michael Carlson, you survived podcast ride.

1851
02:01:36,600 --> 02:01:40,680
Yeah, that's actually the better way. Yes. Thank you. Thank you.

1852
02:01:40,680 --> 02:01:44,300
We're proud of you. Very proud. That's what I wanted.

1853
02:01:45,580 --> 02:01:49,400
The Seven Dwarfs. Now you look at me and say, Scott, you don't have a fucking problem.

1854
02:01:49,580 --> 02:01:52,480
Scott, you have no problem. I was just riffing earlier.

1855
02:01:53,140 --> 02:01:55,660
You having having one glass of wine a night is fine.

1856
02:01:56,020 --> 02:02:00,820
That's what like Patrick Stewart does. And he lives. He's 77 years old. He looks great. He's in great shape.

1857
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:02,640
Everyone loves him. OK, great.

1858
02:02:03,040 --> 02:02:07,020
I'm clearly every bit the physical specimen of Patrick Stewart.

1859
02:02:07,640 --> 02:02:11,540
I'll take that. And thanks for looking at me in the eye.

1860
02:02:11,800 --> 02:02:15,000
Thanks for listening to us in your ears.

1861
02:02:16,560 --> 02:02:23,660
Keep checking out. We got more spooky delights and scary frights coming up all month of October.

1862
02:02:23,660 --> 02:02:29,120
Yeah, the big one next week and a big announcement coming next week, too.

1863
02:02:29,240 --> 02:02:33,660
True. Yes. Yes. Let's let's let's tease that.

1864
02:02:34,600 --> 02:02:39,300
Yeah, next week is going to be a great one. And but all the stuff stayed the same.

1865
02:02:39,460 --> 02:02:47,800
We didn't switch the name on all the socials like podcast, the right on Twitter or Instagram or podcast, the right at Gmail dot com.

1866
02:02:48,340 --> 02:02:56,580
And we got the shirts around as a haunt cast, the fright shirts available as well as all our regular ones.

1867
02:02:56,640 --> 02:03:00,480
I survived, which you should now wear with pride.

1868
02:03:00,620 --> 02:03:04,620
I really did. Impressive. You know, we we got to support each other here.

1869
02:03:04,780 --> 02:03:10,720
You were you all were supportive about Splash Mountain for me. I will be supportive about this for you.

1870
02:03:11,080 --> 02:03:15,480
I don't know what you need support on, Jason, but it's just all of my life choices.

1871
02:03:16,900 --> 02:03:18,460
All the things. Yeah.

1872
02:03:20,020 --> 02:03:22,940
It's a support on your arm that you've cut up.

1873
02:03:23,060 --> 02:03:29,180
Yeah, sure. It's mending. You're doing my jeans and my sweater.

1874
02:03:29,240 --> 02:03:31,740
I like to wear fine, though. That was that was my concern.

1875
02:03:31,900 --> 02:03:35,140
Oh, yeah. I feel naturally. No, they don't.

1876
02:03:35,320 --> 02:03:42,360
