1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:10,040
Warning, the following podcast contains beaver tales with score bits, a pizza race to a dumpster,

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:14,920
a great place to Jurassic Park and chill, and just what you've been hoping for, another

5
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,280
theme park and classic rock connection.

6
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:21,960
Stephen Ray Morris joins us to splash into Salt Lake City's Lagoon theme park on today's

7
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,160
podcast, The Ride.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:49,880
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, the world's first freshwater podcast, which means you can drink

9
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:50,880
it.

10
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:51,880
My name is Mike Carlson.

11
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,880
Join me as always, Jason Sheridan.

12
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:54,880
I hated saying that.

13
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:55,880
I really hated it.

14
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,880
You know what?

15
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,120
I love, I'm glad you brought that up.

16
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:05,440
I almost would have forgotten there is a fact about today's park where there are like

17
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,920
water alkalinity facts.

18
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,760
Yeah, that's Scott Garner talking about alkalinity.

19
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,160
That's even the correct term.

20
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,160
Is alkalinity the term?

21
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,160
I have no idea.

22
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,160
I took a stab at that.

23
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,160
Sounds good.

24
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,160
It was fun to say.

25
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,160
Might not be a word then.

26
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,200
Yeah, that's one of those like non-joke.

27
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,560
First of all, we were just debating this opening jokes.

28
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,180
We've pulled the audience before.

29
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:24,180
Can we get rid of these?

30
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,180
No, no, no.

31
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:27,840
That was the, we were talking about the warnings.

32
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,240
Because those we always end up doing like, all right, we got to do this.

33
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,640
We've tried to get rid of jokes we've never tried to get rid of.

34
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:36,040
But we've internally tried to get rid of them, right?

35
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,520
Or am I misremembering?

36
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,520
I might be misremembering.

37
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,920
It's my fault because I didn't want to keep saying childless men because then I had a

38
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,920
child.

39
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,920
Oh yeah, yeah, that's true.

40
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,920
That's the only reason.

41
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,920
We could go back to it.

42
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,800
Could we get rid of all the fun stuff on the podcast?

43
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,680
I'm asking that to the audience now.

44
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,280
Will you allow us to really stop with like a pre-written stuff?

45
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,280
Yeah, that's all.

46
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,640
We're too lazy to.

47
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:01,000
Yeah, I mean, already people probably think we don't do enough research sometimes, but

48
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,520
can we just at least not be cute?

49
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,240
Why do people think that?

50
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,240
We do it.

51
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,240
We do.

52
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,240
I'm knowing.

53
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,240
Who's saying that?

54
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,240
Well, look, I'll take it.

55
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,240
I get hit.

56
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,240
We know.

57
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,240
I don't know my Munster's facts.

58
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,240
I don't know my I love Lucy facts.

59
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,240
There's people that are furious at me.

60
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,800
Those things aren't the premise of the podcast.

61
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,880
So you are not obliged to know these things.

62
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,680
Taking big swings there.

63
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,680
That's true.

64
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,680
Okay, okay, fine.

65
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,400
The start is in and the preamble fun joke is still in.

66
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,400
It's all in.

67
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,080
I'm not going to cut any of that stuff.

68
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,760
No, and having guests is in.

69
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,760
We have guests still.

70
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,360
There's one here right now.

71
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,360
Is there?

72
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,360
There is!

73
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,360
It's a podcasting professional.

74
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,320
Is he from the podcast Perkast?

75
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,320
See Jurassic Right?

76
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,320
Am I favorite murder?

77
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,320
That's right.

78
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,320
Is it Stephen Ray Morris?

79
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,320
It is.

80
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,320
Wow.

81
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,320
He's here.

82
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,320
I just appeared.

83
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:53,080
I'm glad to be here when you're having a meta kind of crisis about your own podcast.

84
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,080
It's very fun.

85
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,080
It feels very it's like a throwback.

86
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,800
I feel like Jordan Morris a while back was saying it's like remember when podcasts like

87
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:04,080
in 2012 when you just talked, you know, didn't worry about how long it was.

88
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,800
It could be three hours and people would listen, you know, and I like that feeling.

89
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,800
Yeah, yeah.

90
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,280
It's really just working out.

91
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:17,520
Like boring, like just managerial, like just really like, I don't know.

92
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:21,480
You have your meetings while you're doing the show is what you're all about.

93
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,480
Wow.

94
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,480
We're all here.

95
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,520
I feel like the only difference is that people don't just blatantly like say their address

96
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,160
and where they live anymore.

97
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:32,880
So when you comedy podcasts like from 2010 to like 13, it's like, yeah, and just down

98
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,040
the street from this place.

99
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,680
It's like nowadays, I feel like people don't do that anymore.

100
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,680
Yeah.

101
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,680
Mitchell keeps the tradition alive.

102
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,000
If anyone can go find him, stalk him, bother him.

103
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Yeah.

104
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,560
Eating in his house, which is I don't I don't have the address offhand.

105
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,640
Well, but if we if we text, we just get it and read it and he'd be fine with it.

106
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,280
He's mildly annoyed if you come.

107
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,280
Yeah.

108
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,280
Yeah.

109
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,280
Damn it.

110
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,280
All right.

111
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,280
Want some want some wheat thins?

112
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:04,320
I feel like that's like the handful of times I've been lucky to record doughboys is because

113
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:08,560
I was just wandering off the wandering around with podcast equipment and he just Nick just

114
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,320
opened the door and was like, we need it.

115
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,320
We need an engineer.

116
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,960
You saw this gone for the day or whatever.

117
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,960
Emma's gone.

118
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,920
You there.

119
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,920
Yeah.

120
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,920
What?

121
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,920
Yeah.

122
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,920
Oh, I have an H6N.

123
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,920
Yeah.

124
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,920
Yeah.

125
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,920
Inspiring engineers out there.

126
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,920
Yeah.

127
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,920
Yeah.

128
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,920
Wine is address.

129
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,920
You might know it already.

130
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,920
Well, we'll stop talking show business.

131
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:31,560
We'll get to the actual show business, not show business.

132
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,040
Business of the show.

133
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,040
The business of the show.

134
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,160
We'll talk theme park theme park.

135
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:43,640
This podcast is about and you brought a topic today that was not on any of our radar.

136
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,920
I don't believe before.

137
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,920
No, never heard of it.

138
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:50,880
It's a place in Salt Lake City called Lagoon.

139
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,880
Yes.

140
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:55,760
So what is your what's your connection to this place?

141
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,960
Because you were before we started recording, you were alluding to growing up here.

142
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,440
But then you know, like you brought up this play.

143
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,440
What's yeah.

144
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,440
Paint the picture.

145
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:08,440
Well, so the main connection is that my girlfriend, Brennan White is ex Mormon.

146
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:12,920
And but I feel like a lot of ex-Mormons still go back to Utah.

147
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,960
And so it was actually the first time I went to Salt Lake.

148
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:22,200
We went to Lagoon, which I keep calling Lagoon World because I feel like I'm so used to theme

149
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,880
parks having Universal Studios, Disneyland, like little more.

150
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,880
Yeah.

151
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,880
I felt weird saying it just now.

152
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,880
Yeah, yeah.

153
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,880
Yeah, it passes.

154
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,040
And you're like, that's it.

155
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,040
That's the name.

156
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,040
Yeah, yeah.

157
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,960
It's I was thinking about it a lot where it's like because I wanted to make sure I remembered

158
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,440
what rides and stuff I went on and Lagoon when I first went to growing up here, like

159
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,960
I literally grew up 10 minutes away from Disneyland.

160
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,720
It was my first job ever was working at Pizza Port.

161
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:51,000
Yeah. And then going to Lagoon and it's like almost like the Legos, the Lego, excuse me,

162
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,280
when we were a kid where it was just like Knight Cowboy.

163
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,400
Like that's how Lagoon is.

164
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,960
There's like no branded content.

165
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,480
It's very surreal.

166
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,480
Ah, right.

167
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,040
A rare theme park without any.

168
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:05,680
There's not even some rubber stamped SpongeBob type attraction.

169
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,280
They don't even have like a couple of Harvey Comics characters.

170
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,280
No, no.

171
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,640
Yeah, it's very weird.

172
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,720
I think like they have a subway in the park.

173
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,240
Like I think that's about it.

174
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:20,360
Yeah. And of course, like all smaller regional parks, they got Dippin Dots.

175
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,040
Yes. Yes. You want Dippin Dots.

176
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:26,960
They got Dippin Dots, the canniest sweet sweet tree company.

177
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,840
So excited for those growing up.

178
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:32,200
I felt like I don't know, like when because that Knott's Bear Farm is where I think I

179
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,400
first had them.

180
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,120
And it was just like this is the most exciting thing in the world.

181
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,360
And they kind of. Yeah.

182
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,840
Or I don't know. I don't really like the future.

183
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,720
Never came. Yeah.

184
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,920
Never became the future where it is ice cream.

185
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:45,000
It was a full court press one summer down the shore.

186
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,840
They weren't there like all the shore towns in New Jersey,

187
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,840
like which is a very regional business, like a seasonal business.

188
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,960
The Memorial Day is official kickoff.

189
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:59,080
And one summer Dippin Dots were just everywhere.

190
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:02,080
And it worked. We're going to try these things.

191
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,880
Yeah, I get nostalgic for them.

192
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,560
Yeah, you know, I like them.

193
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,600
Yeah. Well, I know.

194
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,520
I think I said, does anyone care about Dippin Dots?

195
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,080
And somebody was mad at me once online, I think.

196
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:14,640
But I found there's there's ripoff Dippin Dots at the round one in Burbank.

197
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,320
What is it called?

198
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,080
I have to look up.

199
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,240
There are numerous ripoff Dippin Dots.

200
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,920
Jason's sweet spots are like I've seen them.

201
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,160
I mean, Dippin Dots at this point are you can get them at like gas.

202
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,480
Like there's like a to go little container at gas stations.

203
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,720
Creamy pebbles. Yeah.

204
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:35,800
Chill cuties like how the tangerines, you know, but they're like little ice cream.

205
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,200
Yeah, you spell it with a K and it gets you off of their branding

206
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,640
and the show and the series cutie.

207
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,720
Yeah. Yeah.

208
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,920
But yeah, that was my connection to Lagoon was just because my girlfriend

209
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:50,160
and I both have universal passes and, you know, we do the thing,

210
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,840
like go to lunch and like ride a couple rides.

211
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,960
I believe Kelly Nugent was the first person to suggest to me

212
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,080
to like go work at Universal, like when I would see people on Hogwarts

213
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:04,960
with like a laptop, but they would actually like be dressed in the like full,

214
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,200
you know, regalia like at you at the like Jurassic Cafe.

215
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:13,200
That seems the best place to work because they actually have plugs outlets.

216
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,960
Oh, really? Yeah.

217
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,520
You talking about that second floor?

218
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,320
I've been calling it Jurassic patio.

219
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,400
It's become my new favorite spot in the park.

220
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,400
I love my favorite beer in the park.

221
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,640
Can I ask you, obviously, a massive Jurassic Park fan,

222
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:29,600
if anyone follows you on social media, just just quickly.

223
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,600
It doesn't have to be quick. I'm going to say quickly.

224
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,680
Yeah. Does that place live up to your expectations?

225
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,800
Are you jealous of the Hogwarts people who get maybe a more elaborate

226
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,200
like land?

227
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,480
It does still break my heart that they didn't put Margaritaville into

228
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,800
like just the Jurassic Cafe, because I feel like the Margaritaville

229
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,240
is so horribly placed in City Walk.

230
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,640
Like I feel like it's abandoned.

231
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,480
Yes. Like every time I go, I'm like, why isn't this place like filled?

232
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:59,320
Right. Because it's a weird like it's it's on the bottom floor and not the top,

233
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,840
despite that the previous tenant had the top.

234
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,760
So you have no open air chill.

235
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,680
It feels very restricted.

236
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,680
Like this garage is more open air chilled than that location.

237
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,120
Yeah. So like crunched.

238
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,320
That's the that is I've never thought about that.

239
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,320
That why not just put it in the park?

240
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,360
It's in Jurassic World.

241
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,080
So if they were like rebranding so much sense.

242
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,600
Yeah, that this is this is my gripe corner before the I guess

243
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,000
the Margaritaville thing, because I've I've been to I think I've been

244
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,880
to four Margaritaville's now.

245
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,720
Chicago.

246
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,880
That one's the Navy Pier one.

247
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,600
The one I passed by that one.

248
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,640
I didn't go in.

249
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,720
Well, it's to me when I was there, when it was like getting winter time,

250
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,560
it almost felt like last call before like all the boats leave

251
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,360
and you're stuck on the island.

252
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,040
And then I went to the one in Niagara Falls and it might be the worst

253
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,320
restaurant I've ever eaten.

254
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:50,320
Oh, dude, Niagara Falls is so wonderfully trashy.

255
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,320
There was somebody was posting about it on the Facebook group recently.

256
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,960
And I was like, why have we not talked more about it?

257
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:57,600
Because I had like from my one frenzy night there, I had so many thoughts

258
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,640
and memories.

259
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,720
What was why was that one particularly crazy?

260
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,520
Maybe I just had the wrong thing.

261
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:07,520
Like I had poutine fries and it was, you know, it's do that everywhere.

262
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:13,080
That is so it's very funny that Margaritaville's occasionally

263
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,440
have like a regional delight.

264
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,200
Yeah, like like the Orlando Margaritaville has Conch Fritters.

265
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,960
But the Hollywood one definitely does that have Conch Fritters.

266
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,200
Conch. I don't know what that is pronounced.

267
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,600
You know, the shell that like in Lord of the Flies, they blow that.

268
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,280
That's a conch.

269
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:36,480
And then the meat of it, the meat inside of it is like a popular like

270
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,240
there's meat inside that shell.

271
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,720
Yeah, it's a yeah, it's like a big muscle.

272
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,240
Yeah, it's like a muscle.

273
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,000
Of course it is because it's a shell for a for a like a creature.

274
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,200
Yeah. Yeah.

275
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,040
So I just thought it was for here in the ocean.

276
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,600
Yeah. Or calling.

277
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,840
Well, I can't remember the organ in there.

278
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,920
I was thinking the Helms Deep, the one he blows that.

279
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,480
But that was.

280
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,640
But yeah, the Jurassic, I think it's great.

281
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,200
Like, I think it's one of those things where I think with maybe

282
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,960
a lot of theme park stuff like on paper, like there's a difference

283
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,640
between the concept art to reality.

284
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,680
And I just feel like concept art is always going to be amazing.

285
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,920
And like even the concept art for the new Jurassic World, like the plus up

286
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,720
like looked amazing.

287
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,000
But I was like, they're never going to make that.

288
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,200
So I'm like part of me is like if when I'm there and you're just

289
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,040
hearing the music, it's just amazing.

290
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,960
Yeah. OK. So yeah, it still satisfies your need as a fan.

291
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,320
Yes. Oh, 100 percent. Yeah.

292
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,760
Having the new bar like it's small, but I mean, it's it's fun.

293
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,040
You know, I think too. Yeah.

294
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:35,840
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

295
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:40,480
Yeah. Well, you take that up to Jurassic Patio, which I'm so worried about talking up.

296
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,840
I know I know it's crowded, but it was like good place to hang with my kid.

297
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:47,760
He could run around and push chairs around at plenty of space like just good.

298
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:52,560
Like I've some of my most chill of 2021 is Jurassic Patio.

299
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,120
It's nice and we shouldn't promote it too much.

300
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,480
Yeah. Because the magic.

301
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,960
It's so fun. Stay the hell off of that.

302
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,760
That's our place. Well, it's us and Steven.

303
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:06,480
It's funny because when the Jurassic Park ride closed, the original one,

304
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,160
I was there for the last day.

305
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,440
I was there for most of the day.

306
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,200
So I just like wrote it over and over again.

307
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,360
But then in that in between, I think it was like six or seven months.

308
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,400
That was when it was the perfect time because there was no like.

309
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:22,320
I mean, obviously, mummy and Transformers draw some people, but it was truly like

310
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,400
I felt like that place was half empty for that.

311
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:28,000
Oh, the lower lot had does not have its biggest attraction.

312
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,800
So and people are not maybe not doing the full walk,

313
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,440
which we talk about being too lazy to do sometimes.

314
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:38,800
I mean, for that purpose, though, like I used to go like when I would work more nights,

315
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,480
like I would go to Universal.

316
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,680
I would work for like edit for a couple of hours.

317
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,280
Again, got the outlets.

318
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:49,120
The Wi-Fi is really good there because there's nobody down there now trying to fight for it.

319
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,160
Oh, and then do editing work even like on a lab?

320
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,000
Yeah, I'm a yeah.

321
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,480
I used to add some of them and stuff on there.

322
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,600
But he's crazy.

323
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,640
This is a very important point.

324
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:02,560
I would throw my backpack in the mummy locker and then go ride a few rides.

325
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,160
And then that was like my workday.

326
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,280
There's so much.

327
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:05,920
Geez.

328
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,960
Oh, and that's the way is that free that mummy locker like for a certain amount of time?

329
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:09,440
Or do you?

330
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,080
Yeah, the mummy lockers, I think free for two hours or one hour.

331
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,520
I might be wrong about that because the.

332
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,000
Very good.

333
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,080
Yeah, you think you have to be think that only lasts for like 10 minutes or so,

334
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,200
or however long the ride takes.

335
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,320
Oh, that's that ain't bad.

336
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,200
But I guess it would have to.

337
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,720
Yeah, because in case there's a long line.

338
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,160
Yeah, yeah, true.

339
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:24,320
Yeah.

340
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,320
Or the ride breaks down and you're still waiting in line.

341
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:26,640
Sure.

342
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:26,960
Sure.

343
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,240
While we could.

344
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,320
Yeah, just just going to the park like that.

345
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,760
I think that's when I realized I really like it.

346
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,040
And when I discovered your guys's pod was like that idea of like,

347
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,960
oh, like there's more to a theme park than just like going to because I feel like as a kid,

348
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:43,680
it's just you're you're waiting in line for three or two hours at a time or an hour at a time.

349
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,360
And then when you're an adult, you're like, oh, I can get so much more out of a theme park than just

350
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,960
the rides even kind of in a way.

351
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:53,200
Well, once you're when if you can go to a theme park, if you're lucky enough to have it not be

352
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:58,480
just a race to the finish to pack it all into a short amount of time and you can actually be like

353
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:03,200
a place where you live some of your life or have a chill time, like just be here.

354
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,960
And if we do one or two things, great.

355
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:09,840
But I just want to have like if you treat it as just like an outdoor mall with a target and a

356
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,720
Marshall's.

357
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,560
I mean, it's it's the past thing.

358
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:18,400
And I the Disneyland past thing confuses me now because I went to for Brenda's anniversary.

359
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,920
We did Avengers campus for the first time because I had been to California Adventure

360
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,160
since like 2010 or something.

361
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,200
Oh, well, so like did cars for the first time, did all that for the first time.

362
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:32,160
And I was like we were like I was like, it's it's only an hour away.

363
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,480
Like, can we justify getting the Disneyland pass?

364
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:39,600
Are we going to go every two like two weekends out of the month?

365
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,920
Like with Universal, it's really easy to justify.

366
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,200
It's free parking.

367
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:47,520
And like you get to the front of the line if you have the platinum pass, at least one thing like

368
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,800
it is such a good deal.

369
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:53,280
I mean, this year alone, I've probably gone like 15 times, 20 times already.

370
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,320
Geez, wow.

371
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,200
Yeah, it's a reopen.

372
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,680
Like it's it's just the best.

373
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,120
Makes a lot more sense.

374
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,000
Yeah, for sure.

375
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,500
Yeah.

376
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:07,360
But you see, you grew up around not just Disneyland, but not that's I'm certainly jealous of

377
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:07,600
that.

378
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,600
I was not like I was so little close to Universal, but not terribly.

379
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,400
So so were you at these places all the time?

380
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,760
Is that a major part of your childhood?

381
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,480
I think so.

382
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:16,800
Yeah.

383
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:21,680
I mean, Disneyland, I was like I was like a Disney kid in high school.

384
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,080
And then obviously the theme parks right there.

385
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:27,440
And that was when the pass was like $200, you know, and there was one pass.

386
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,760
And then I worked there for a summer, just one summer at Pizza Port.

387
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,560
And that was the year that they were rebuilding it.

388
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,920
So every like every time I go to work, I would see like the back open.

389
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,960
It was really cool.

390
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,920
Wait, what year is it?

391
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,400
What are we talking about?

392
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,920
2003 or four, I think is when the ride was shut.

393
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,600
It was when Space Mountain was shut down.

394
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,480
Oh, OK.

395
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:49,520
I was not not the full not redoing all of tomorrow.

396
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,000
No, no, no.

397
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,960
Space Mountain is new.

398
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,280
OK.

399
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

400
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,040
And then and then, yeah, I think that's and then, yeah.

401
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,560
So then I feel like other people like Matt Apodaca like talked about,

402
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:03,280
you know, just going after school or going on the weekends or you would go until we get crowded.

403
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:06,240
Or like there was again all those like little hacks or whatever.

404
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:10,960
And I also had my winter formal at Knott's Berry Farm like Matt also mentioned.

405
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:14,080
I think I brought up Twitter recently when I was on that episode and I was like,

406
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:19,520
how what is the weird monopoly on like winter formal like in Southern California?

407
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:24,080
And also like it's the worst dance to go to a theme park because you're wearing like a suit.

408
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:24,400
Right.

409
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:29,600
Like I feel like be like a like a CD Hawkins or something would be a much better option.

410
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,960
Something a little more casual.

411
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:34,240
Yeah, because it takes water rides not out of the equation.

412
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,280
It just makes it a lot more.

413
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:38,880
You want to wear like as few clothes as possible, not like extra clothes.

414
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,360
Yeah, yeah.

415
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,080
Or the first time I'm wearing a tie like really.

416
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,280
Yeah, yeah.

417
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:48,160
You got to check out the Timber Mountain Log Ride in a full wool ensemble.

418
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,200
So they did it in the 60s.

419
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,080
So everybody did it.

420
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:52,640
True. Yeah, yeah.

421
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:58,160
You got to ask about pizza port because I feel like there's I think there's an episode that's

422
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,320
been on the horizon with somebody.

423
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:05,200
I assume somebody mentioned previously in this episode who has some pizza port opinions.

424
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,280
I think this one's coming down down the road.

425
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,800
But what you know, the behind the scenes, how the pizza magic happens.

426
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,400
So it's funny.

427
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,800
I mean, I feel like because I think maybe some people like the magic is ruined or whatever.

428
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,080
I didn't work there long enough.

429
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,440
So I feel like it wasn't kind of.

430
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,680
But it is one of those things where like if you're looking for a job where you like have like,

431
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:29,520
you know, your job is like your crew or whatever, like they switch out people every day.

432
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,400
Like I was there for summer, probably didn't work with the same people more than once.

433
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,040
But it's very depressing because it's one of those things where like they want to keep the

434
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:37,680
food fresh.

435
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,520
So they would like I don't know what it is now.

436
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,200
I mean, this was 15 years ago, but they would like if the food was sitting out for more

437
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,200
than like a certain amount of time, you'd have to throw it away.

438
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,840
So imagine like a 17 year old like who can like only afford Pop Tarts from the vending

439
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:54,080
machine on their break, like having to literally carry a whole pizza and dump it in the trash

440
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:54,880
regularly.

441
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,080
And it's like they don't want to give it to any unhoused or anything.

442
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,080
And like so then it became a thing where like a few of us would be like, how quickly could

443
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,200
you eat that pizza before you had to throw it away?

444
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,920
So you like shove a slice in your mouth as you're walking to the back because it was this long walk

445
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,640
right to the back where the trash compactor was.

446
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,520
Oh, that helps.

447
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,400
And so distance.

448
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:14,480
Yeah.

449
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,760
So it's just like down like I was just like, I think I got two slices.

450
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:18,640
Okay.

451
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,600
That was like the record.

452
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:19,760
Yeah.

453
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,840
I don't know if it was a record, but it was my record.

454
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,560
Okay.

455
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:22,960
Yeah.

456
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:27,360
But somebody more, if somebody was desperate, they could maybe go for a five or six.

457
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,560
Jason, what do you think you could do?

458
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,720
Yeah, I think too.

459
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,720
I mean, that's a doughy slice of pizza.

460
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,320
That's a thick, bready.

461
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:35,600
Yes.

462
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,760
Under season slice of pizza.

463
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,160
Yeah.

464
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,120
I mean, it was a lot.

465
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,640
I mean, too, is it a lot?

466
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,760
And I mean, I was 17.

467
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,160
I was young.

468
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:46,000
You know, that is definitely your young man's game.

469
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:53,120
Yeah, I think the other, the other trick was, was the pocket salad because it was like,

470
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,160
I don't know if I should be.

471
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,720
I don't think Disney can take, take me now.

472
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,560
Just have like a predator sniper thing.

473
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:03,040
But like you would get like a cup for water and you'd put it in your pocket.

474
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,680
And when you're at the salad station, you would just throw a little couple of

475
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,640
ingredients in your pocket.

476
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,120
And then by the time you go on your lunch, you'd have like a little salad.

477
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:09,840
Wow.

478
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:13,360
Again, this is because there have you guys talked about the in between?

479
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,640
I don't know if it's called that anymore, but it's a restaurant in between the two

480
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,240
layers of Disneyland.

481
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,640
Cause it's like, this has never come up now because there's like the outer layer

482
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,960
where you like see the outside of the park and then the inside.

483
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,640
And then there's like, I don't even know.

484
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,480
It's probably like 20 or 30 feet of like where cast members go to get changed.

485
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,640
And costumes and break rooms.

486
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,200
Yeah.

487
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,320
It's sort of on the, is it closer to main street or tomorrow land?

488
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,120
I might've gotten a goal.

489
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,320
It's closer to main street.

490
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,680
I think I was there once.

491
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:41,200
I got to do this like night shoot where I was in space mountain late at night.

492
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:41,760
Oh, cool.

493
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,240
Just threw it.

494
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,680
But yeah, just risk this one time.

495
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:48,320
So I think it is like a little bit of main street vibe and like a peppermint colored

496
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,600
umbrellas and okay.

497
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,080
Yeah.

498
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,440
I think I did it there.

499
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,480
It was very funny though, because it was like a mean girl sort of thing where like

500
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,320
the cast members who were characters would all sit together and then people who like

501
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,840
worked at the stores would sit together.

502
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,920
The people worked at restaurants, the like trash people or what I don't know the

503
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,840
correct name garbage disposal people.

504
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,160
It was almost there was those little clicks.

505
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,920
Yeah, we've heard that from the people work.

506
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:13,440
There were definitely like there was drama between clicks.

507
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,000
Oh, I'm sure.

508
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:14,480
Yeah.

509
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,600
Dating among.

510
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,320
Oh, no.

511
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:20,800
Like there was like, yeah, there was like scandalous stuff happening, I think too.

512
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,960
Like, and then there would be like drama between.

513
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:23,200
Yeah.

514
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,240
Actions essentially.

515
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,800
Is it if he had the story about the guy who had a girl in every land.

516
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,520
Oh my God.

517
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,800
But then if, but then if any, once somebody switched, once the tomorrow land girl

518
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:40,160
ended up being a frontier land girl and all bets were off, his old scheme unraveled.

519
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:41,600
Not him.

520
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,320
It wasn't him.

521
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:42,560
Yeah.

522
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:42,800
Yeah.

523
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,760
Somebody else.

524
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,800
Some scumbag.

525
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:44,960
Yeah.

526
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,360
Yeah.

527
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,520
I'm just sad I never saw the basketball court.

528
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,080
Like I just didn't work there long enough, you know?

529
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:50,640
Yeah.

530
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,320
That one feels like is anyone in the audience seen the basketball court?

531
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,320
I don't even think it's possible because they act.

532
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:00,480
I think when I was when I was there on a VIP tour, they were like, it's you won't even.

533
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,600
We can't take you in there.

534
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,040
It's like a hazard.

535
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:03,600
Oh, really?

536
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:08,240
The condemn sign down to film the Bobger sequence in the Imagineering story.

537
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:08,560
Yeah.

538
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,560
And then when everyone's like, all right, we got to get out of here,

539
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,400
put the condemn sign back up.

540
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:12,720
Yeah.

541
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,840
I guess they, I guess it's not that bad if they brought a 90 year old man.

542
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,400
Yeah.

543
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,120
And a film crew.

544
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:17,360
Yeah.

545
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:17,920
Film crew.

546
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,640
But I'm sure they don't really want you going.

547
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,240
It's not as easy as some of the other places that are designed for people to look at,

548
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,920
like the wall department or whatever.

549
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,240
Yeah.

550
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,040
And I didn't even see the, I didn't even see the cats at Disney

551
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,400
Island until my most recent trip.

552
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:30,720
Oh, yeah.

553
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,880
I did see a cat by the hotel.

554
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,080
Oh, sure.

555
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,440
That's a good spot for them.

556
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:40,320
It's like kind of by Trader, Trader Sam's over on that little stretch.

557
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:40,800
Yeah, yeah.

558
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:46,560
But it pools a little bit and the, by the raft ride by Grizzly Rapids.

559
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,060
Yeah.

560
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:51,200
Has that come up on the, have you covered that end of cats?

561
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,400
A little bit.

562
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:52,640
Yeah.

563
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,360
I mean, I would love to do, because I know somebody runs an Instagram.

564
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,240
Yeah.

565
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,440
Like that's the kind of thing I would love to, and I would love to just go on like a tour.

566
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,200
Also, a ghost just blew open the door, which is very fun.

567
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,320
The ghostly door opening is back.

568
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,280
Actually, it's really nice.

569
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:04,240
Yeah.

570
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,920
That's why it's open air in here.

571
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,080
I love it.

572
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,920
That's more inside business we can do.

573
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,640
Yeah.

574
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,120
We're adjusting the, how the garage works all the time.

575
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,360
You know, and not to give away when it's being recorded,

576
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,320
but we're only a few short hours from mischief night

577
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,120
or devil's night as it's known in some parts of the country.

578
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,440
So, the ghost are getting ready.

579
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,000
Will we get trick or treaters coming to the garage?

580
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:29,280
If the episode goes past midnight, and then it's technically we're recording on October 31st.

581
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:33,360
I had never heard of mischief night until Jason said the phrase eight years ago,

582
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,400
and I've never been the same.

583
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,640
Well, it's called different things.

584
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:41,360
All Hallows Eve is the, that's actually Halloween, right?

585
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,920
But the night before Halloween in different parts of the country,

586
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:44,880
it's called different things.

587
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,640
And it's when kids go out a pranking.

588
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,040
So, mischief night in the Northeast, devil's night, I think in the Midwest.

589
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,080
But who uses any of this?

590
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,520
People call it Halloween.

591
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,040
One of the tiny regional things.

592
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,800
This is from the East Coast.

593
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,000
One of those things where like he said it as if we all knew it.

594
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,360
No one had any idea what it was.

595
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,120
I thought it was a lot more common than it was.

596
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:11,840
Don't you see Jason has a backpack full of stink bombs and bars of soap.

597
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,240
Sloppy baggies.

598
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:14,720
Yeah.

599
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,080
He's ready for mischief night.

600
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:21,440
I also, I couldn't be remiss if I didn't mention my tunnels experience.

601
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,240
At least like it's boring, but it is true.

602
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,960
It is true that the tunnels under Disneyland look like the Nostromo.

603
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,760
It's very xenomorph, like alien.

604
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,080
So there are tunnels?

605
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:36,560
Because we know that the Magic Kingdom has the big Utilidor situation.

606
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,840
But what is Disneyland?

607
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,760
It's not like a full park covering thing.

608
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,920
I think at least my time in it was basically if-

609
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,560
Punishment.

610
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,200
Yeah, punishment.

611
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,320
You send me down to the tunnel.

612
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,520
We saw you eat the slices.

613
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,160
Get in there.

614
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,800
Although I think, I don't know what it's called now, but Club Buzz,

615
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,440
their break room is underground, which felt very depressing.

616
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,240
Oh.

617
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:56,800
Oh, wait.

618
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:00,240
Well, you would have to, because we did an episode about the bands that would play there.

619
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:04,080
So there would have to be underground because that's where you load up the band.

620
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,520
And then it rises up to the top.

621
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,020
Yes.

622
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:11,520
But I did it a few times because if one of the restaurants was out of ice,

623
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,920
so like one time Peace Corps was out of ice.

624
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:18,400
And so you don't want to have this big heavy thing going around to possibly topple over children

625
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,000
or ruin the illusion or whatever.

626
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,120
And so we would go down and then I'd have the thing, fill it up with ice,

627
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,120
and then go back underground and then go back up.

628
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:29,600
So that was kind of my it's not very exciting, but it was it still was like,

629
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,960
again, growing up going to Disneyland and then getting to have any of these kind of things

630
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,880
is like actually kind of really cool.

631
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,120
I remember at the time being like very into it.

632
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:41,120
Most of the audience listening to you are excited to hear about the tunnels.

633
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,920
That's absolutely like every if they were if somebody at Disneyland was like,

634
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:47,440
hey, you want to go see the tunnels, they'd be like, oh, my God.

635
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:47,760
Yeah.

636
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:53,200
Well, it's it was funny, too, because again, I've just started listening to you guys like a few

637
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,880
months ago, really. And it's been one of these very exciting things because it feels like every

638
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,400
episode I have an example.

639
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:02,560
And it's like as somebody who makes podcasts, the person screaming at the phone, like I'm like,

640
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,760
I was turning into that person.

641
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,400
I was like, I also saw suburban legends every weekend.

642
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,000
Like when I go to downtown Disney, like nobody else who else talks about this?

643
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,920
So that was very exciting.

644
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:14,560
It was perfect.

645
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:17,840
We just gathered him here like the last few months worth of stuff.

646
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:22,160
And if you go into the archive, you hear anything that you want that you yell that

647
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,760
bring him back and yellow list.

648
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,720
It was about the twenty seven.

649
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,040
Oh, I haven't even gotten to the city walks out yet, but I'm very excited.

650
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:29,520
Oh, boy.

651
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,020
Yeah.

652
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:36,800
You have a do you have a favorite aspect of city walk or a treasured city walk memory?

653
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:41,120
I did sprain my ankle at the dueling pianos bar.

654
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:41,680
Oh, wow.

655
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,560
How the moon really?

656
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,280
Yeah. How the moon.

657
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:43,760
Yeah. Yeah.

658
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,880
I was my friend on at least who also works at exactly right.

659
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,920
She was performing and there's a little step.

660
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,440
You know, it's always those little steps.

661
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:51,600
Yeah.

662
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:55,760
And we went to go down and like just heard like a loud crack.

663
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,240
But I was drunk like and then leaving.

664
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:02,880
It's hard if you if you have to leave city walk, it's very difficult if you

665
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,080
have sprained your ankle.

666
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,520
Yeah, that's not my favorite.

667
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,200
But this is very memorable.

668
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,800
I mean, strong memory.

669
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,280
I don't know.

670
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:12,000
It's it's weird that it's like now my movie theater, too.

671
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:17,920
So it's like kind of makes it more festive to like I'm not just like going to the Arclight

672
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,560
or whatever.

673
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:21,360
It's like, oh, I like and having a pass is like,

674
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:25,920
do I want to go to the theme park before or like kind of sure, you know, that kind of

675
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,240
stuff.

676
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:26,480
Sure.

677
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,640
Get a good little like pre show like a bill.

678
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,560
It probably makes a movie more exciting.

679
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:36,880
You got to park up here and pass by a dinosaur on the sign and weave out of this labyrinth

680
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,040
to get to the theater.

681
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:39,760
You just reminded me.

682
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:44,000
Yeah, because one of the when the last Jurassic World came out, we all ate at

683
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,120
Margaritaville.

684
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:50,640
There was the T-Rex statue posted there and then we all went and saw it at the IMAX.

685
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,600
It was really fun.

686
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,400
I mean, that's cool.

687
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:56,720
There's a new Jurassic Park out and you're doing it in a in an environment where there's

688
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:02,400
a lot of dress stuff and a ride down stairs and they filmed all of the movies around the

689
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,680
Snug of the Woods to Lost World set is nearby.

690
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

691
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,280
That feels neat.

692
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,240
It's in the air.

693
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,400
The Jurassic spirit is in the air.

694
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:15,040
Yeah, I kind of lucked out as far as like fandoms go because it's like or do you guys

695
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:15,600
know about this?

696
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,120
Were they going to transform the mummy ride with Tom Cruise if it had done well?

697
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:23,200
Because it feels like the Jurassic World is kind of like a blueprint where like

698
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:27,120
Universal always gets rid of rides and replaces them, whereas like Jurassic's the first

699
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:32,400
like nostalgia revamp and it's like, oh, the mummy could also like stay the same, but just

700
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,600
throw Tom Cruise in there.

701
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,360
But I don't know if like I feel like that universe didn't even last long enough to even

702
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,160
for it to be considered.

703
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,080
Yeah, I'm sure it was on the table.

704
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:40,560
I don't know.

705
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:46,320
Because like they were look, we remember the spread announcing the universe.

706
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:50,880
So, yeah, I would imagine they were like, hey, you know, we could do replace Brendan

707
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,520
with Tom.

708
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,760
Yeah, but it didn't work.

709
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,560
Yeah, I don't think anything's ever off the table.

710
00:27:56,560 --> 00:28:02,320
I had always heard the story I had heard was that they had what they had invested in was

711
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:08,320
like the dark universe, like had a floor and one of the office buildings just full of classic

712
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,600
Universal Monsters stuff.

713
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:15,200
Like they went all out of like decorating these offices with stuff because it's like

714
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,320
this is an investment.

715
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,560
We're going all the way to the top with this.

716
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:22,560
And then there's nothing worse than like buying a building and then the building is empty.

717
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,480
Like that just is so depressing.

718
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:24,800
Sure.

719
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,720
The Quibi curse.

720
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,200
Oh, yeah.

721
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:29,840
The course.

722
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:31,920
The course.

723
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,560
Well, that's all amazing.

724
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,520
The Pete support, Pete support cred, what cred you're bringing into the show.

725
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,440
But let's let's head into Lagoon.

726
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,400
Let's talk Lagoon.

727
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:50,160
So that OK, wait, so this mainly you were saying it mainly comes through your girlfriend.

728
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:50,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

729
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:51,120
Right.

730
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,000
So yeah, yeah, we'll explain that connection.

731
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:00,800
You've been here, presumably, or you're just or you just like heard about it and

732
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,840
are fascinated by it.

733
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,360
Yeah, yeah, though I did.

734
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,520
I did go again in.

735
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,960
Yeah, I think it was like September of September 2019.

736
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,720
I was like, you know, it's that thing you're like visiting the significant others family

737
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,600
for the first time.

738
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,560
Like, let's let's, you know, like, I don't know.

739
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:21,360
It was fun to like have activities planned versus like just going to have like dinner

740
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,440
and just be in a house for two days.

741
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:23,940
Sure.

742
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,120
Kind of thing.

743
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:29,280
So it was Brennan and her brother, Thomas.

744
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:33,600
And then I think some of her like a cousin or niece joined us at some point.

745
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,520
But like, and it was also September.

746
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,880
So it was like starting Oktoberfest.

747
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,960
So they've started selling alcohol in Lagoon.

748
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,200
I don't know how recent because it is a Mormon known thing.

749
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,000
I still believe.

750
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,560
But like, or I don't know if the upper corporate people or whatever.

751
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:51,040
But I think selling alcohol in Lagoon was like a novelty because I remember Brennan

752
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:56,000
and Thomas were very like, there's like an Oktoberfest thing here, like all that kind

753
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:56,320
of stuff.

754
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,560
That's potentially a little rare.

755
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:02,320
Well, I don't like I don't I don't know much about Salt Lake City.

756
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:08,000
Is like, is that a is that a rare aspect of a place in Salt Lake City?

757
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:08,560
Do we know?

758
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:14,480
Or is it like, am I am I overthinking the puritanical nature of the city?

759
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:19,280
Most people from SLC will be quick to say that it's like the most like like liberal,

760
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:22,880
woke, cool, young of Utah kind of thing.

761
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,560
And Lagoon is probably like 20 minutes east.

762
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,280
OK, and it is true.

763
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:30,000
Like I was watching some of the ride videos, the rides that I went on again.

764
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,320
And it's like you are truly just like looking over a free.

765
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,160
I guess that's true for all theme parks, I guess.

766
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:34,880
But a lot of them.

767
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,040
Yeah.

768
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,000
Besides Disney.

769
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,800
Yeah, you're often next to a bunch of unglamorous stuff.

770
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,040
Yeah.

771
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:43,200
But Lagoon is like the attitude there is like the parking lot is a field like,

772
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,160
oh, you know what I mean?

773
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:48,480
Like that, I feel like if anybody wants to be like sold on the vibes, it's a field that

774
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,360
you park in.

775
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:49,840
Yeah.

776
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:53,920
And there's a lot of green space in the park and there's mountains in the background.

777
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:54,080
Yes.

778
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,480
Like I love parks that have a lot of nature.

779
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,400
It's like in and around.

780
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:58,560
Yeah.

781
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:01,920
Well, and the other thing I was saying, because Mike, I sent you a couple of pictures like

782
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:08,000
the juxtaposition of like these like crazy roller coasters, like Cannibal.

783
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:08,960
We could talk about more.

784
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:14,480
And that's the one where like it's like cliffhanger, you know, where it goes under

785
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,640
like the roller coaster goes under and down.

786
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:21,600
It's not just a straight like 90 degree drop or whatever, how you describe it.

787
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,520
I looked up the term or I saw the term.

788
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,520
It's be beyond vertical.

789
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,440
That's what a weird way to frame it.

790
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,280
That it is not just a thing.

791
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,200
A ride goes straight up and then straight back down.

792
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:37,840
But there's a little like lip so that you go a little almost upside down and then straight

793
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,160
down.

794
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,600
I know it'll help the listener.

795
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:44,560
It is exactly like the shell razor roller coaster at the American Dream Mall, the Ninja

796
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,440
Turtle coaster.

797
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,200
It does the same thing.

798
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:55,520
Which I suspect beat it as steepest drop because at one point I saw this listed at one point

799
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:58,320
as the steepest coaster in North America.

800
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,400
And now it's just one of the steepest.

801
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:00,720
Right.

802
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,160
That one might be like they squeaked a couple more degrees.

803
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:04,880
Yeah.

804
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,120
Yeah.

805
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:05,440
Yeah.

806
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,520
And it's indoors.

807
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,480
It's a trapped ride.

808
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:10,960
It's trapped.

809
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:15,040
And then you get that like a view of like just the New Jersey like wasteland when you

810
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,880
look out like at the top of it.

811
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,440
Are you guys going to do a Mall of America episode at some point?

812
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,520
I feel like that seems like such a.

813
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:24,160
Yeah, yeah, I've been I went that.

814
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:24,800
Cool.

815
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,360
And like again, this theme park where it's like not branded.

816
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,960
There's no characters, movies or anything.

817
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:33,360
It's just it feels like I was in like a Disney Channel original movie or something.

818
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,800
Which I think they have shot there.

819
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,000
But they have.

820
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,040
I'm sure that will come up since we brought up Cannibal.

821
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:45,120
I have to say I just love this graphic on the website of just Cannibal Mega Coaster

822
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,880
and a smiling child.

823
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,240
Oh my God.

824
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:53,280
Like scary word and then not a very not scary font and kid.

825
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,560
Learn about Cannibal.

826
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,280
Like it's just.

827
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,360
I know it's a roller.

828
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,520
The juxtaposition was just very funny.

829
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:02,080
Well, and that's to sell that point even more.

830
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:02,960
It's like on the website.

831
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:06,720
It's like, yeah, Cannibal Wicked like sky like.

832
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,840
But then there's like roller coaster like it's just roller coaster.

833
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,960
The wooden roller coaster is just called roller coaster on the website.

834
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,560
A hundred years old.

835
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:18,560
It's built in 1921 designed by the guy who designed some of the Coney Island ride.

836
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,040
Oh, wow.

837
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:19,360
Really?

838
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,000
And there was a fire in the 50s.

839
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,720
They did rebuild, but it is so funny.

840
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,840
I was trying to see.

841
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:30,320
I couldn't find any T-shirts, but if they sold T-shirts, I just said roller.

842
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,200
Yeah, roller coaster.

843
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,480
It's just it's funny because it is like you can just call it anything.

844
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,000
And then they were like, yeah, we're good.

845
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:42,640
Zip like not even think of one verb that a roller coaster does.

846
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,720
Yeah, not even like the roller coaster.

847
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:44,960
Right.

848
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:51,200
But the juxtaposition of that is that they also have a full pioneer village,

849
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,400
which is like recreation of like what the Mormon like,

850
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:57,840
like probably what Salt Lake City looked like in the 1800s or something.

851
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:01,520
So my day was very weird where it was like we did that in the morning

852
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,320
and like started drinking and doing that.

853
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,960
And then we did roller coasters to like close out the day.

854
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:07,440
Oh, nice.

855
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,680
That's like a logical flow.

856
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:10,480
Yeah, it's like this.

857
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,280
Well, this sounds like Utah knots.

858
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:17,680
It seems completely like off like off brand, like not a lot of IP.

859
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:22,240
There's there's a lot of coasters and then the little charm things that you do.

860
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,640
I mean, this seems this seems great.

861
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,320
I feel like we'd have a great time there.

862
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,480
I feel like not says has more.

863
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,640
I mean, I haven't been in probably like 10 years as well, but it feels like they

864
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,440
they've like but they're like trying to make it.

865
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,560
They're almost building their own like universe or whatever.

866
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:42,320
Like Laguna, like here are just 15 roller coasters.

867
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,840
Yeah, like stuff again.

868
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:46,960
Another thing I like epitomize that like Cannibal when we were going on

869
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:50,880
and I'm also somebody who's terrified of roller coasters until I go on.

870
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,680
And then I'm like, who?

871
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:52,640
Like this is the best.

872
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:52,880
Right.

873
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,880
Always forget.

874
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:58,080
Yeah, it's like I'm like I'm like because as a kid, like I remember like I would hold

875
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,840
my head down on Indiana Jones.

876
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,200
Like I was so terrified.

877
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:01,520
Geez.

878
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:01,760
Yeah.

879
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,560
But it was but then after the ride, you're like, oh, that was great.

880
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,200
Like we're fine with Cannibal.

881
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:10,480
We were waiting to get on and somebody had puked on the ride.

882
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:15,040
It was like a bunch of like 15 year olds being like, I don't want to do it.

883
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,360
I don't like it was just they were all like looking at like mad dog

884
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:21,120
and each other like who's going to break and like actually clean up the puke.

885
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:25,040
And that was like the experience getting on that ride.

886
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:28,880
And then if I don't know if you watch any videos of it, but there's like you literally

887
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:35,360
take a elevator up to the top and then that's really weird kind of a creepy narrow shaft.

888
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:35,600
Yeah.

889
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:41,280
Does it feel rickety or dangerous though or anything?

890
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,560
Because it's pretty new.

891
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,120
It's a new.

892
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,080
Yeah, yeah.

893
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:44,640
It's it.

894
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,000
No, it doesn't feel dangerous.

895
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:51,120
It just it is just a weird like the notion of tracks having to disconnect.

896
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:53,600
To me, that seems like a scary concept.

897
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:53,760
Sure.

898
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,160
Oh, I want this thing to be attached the whole time.

899
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:59,920
Like a break in the thing means like what if it like got off or, you know,

900
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:00,560
like it's the one.

901
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:04,960
Yeah, it's never like, yeah, you would feel good if it's like it's never come off this track.

902
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,960
Yeah, it's all there's no chance.

903
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,560
Yeah, it could just get like snatched away by I don't know, a big bird.

904
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,280
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

905
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,280
You get at the top like it comes in.

906
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,280
Eagle could take away one of the cars.

907
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:20,320
Yeah, it's a great roller coaster, but it is one of those things where like the buildup of it is

908
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:24,960
definitely the most exciting part in a way, because once you do that beyond drop, I think

909
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,600
there's like one loop and then it's kind of just chill.

910
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,160
Sure.

911
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:28,400
Sure.

912
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,440
As far as a roller coaster.

913
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,840
It's hang time like a little bit like that too, right?

914
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:32,320
It's a little.

915
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,440
It's a little bit.

916
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:39,280
I kind of find like that gimmick feels scarier when you look at it as far as it going this way

917
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,560
than actually doing it.

918
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,360
Like it is scary to kind of have that slow drop.

919
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,000
Yeah.

920
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Unless it's much more severe than hang time.

921
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,320
The hang time is the one it not to what goes.

922
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,720
You have to go like straight up like vertical on your.

923
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:51,600
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

924
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,720
Oh, that's here.

925
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:53,280
Sure.

926
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,200
And then it hanged it holds you.

927
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,000
Yeah, that's fine.

928
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,760
I don't even know if I've been on that.

929
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,560
That's fine to me.

930
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,440
That's a newer too.

931
00:36:59,440 --> 00:36:59,760
Yeah.

932
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:04,640
Yeah, if you're in the front, but it's fine with me, but that vertical up, I just go, oh, man,

933
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,400
like I'm holding the front like.

934
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:12,000
Well, that's why riser you have to where you just go up to the top and you just sit there.

935
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,640
Like the one where the guy climbed to the top speed of Nutsberry Farm,

936
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,880
where that guy climbed to the top of a couple of months ago.

937
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:17,840
Yeah, that was a nut.

938
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:18,400
Yeah.

939
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:18,880
Yeah.

940
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:19,520
That happened.

941
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:25,840
I didn't look into it too much, but because he was fine, but it was just like, how did you even

942
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:30,560
like my fear of height, like how did you even get like he climbed up like a service ladder?

943
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:30,720
Right.

944
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:31,360
Yeah.

945
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:31,920
Well, yeah.

946
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:32,800
So yeah, they do that.

947
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,360
Like they make it accessible for employees.

948
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:40,000
But yeah, but yeah, yeah, it's like if this vehicle wasn't forcing me up here,

949
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,600
there's no way I would keep going.

950
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:45,520
So imagine just yourself on your lonesome.

951
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:49,680
Do you watch those like urban explorer videos where guys just have like a GoPro

952
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:53,200
and they're up at the top of like a skyscraper?

953
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:53,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

954
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:58,080
They go to like the very top of I don't whatever the highest point in a city is.

955
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:01,600
And then they're just like, like dangling, dangling off the side.

956
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:04,480
And you're like, I don't know how your brain didn't just melt down.

957
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:08,160
Well, I feel like there's like two different kinds of like being afraid of heights.

958
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:11,440
It's like I like being up high, but being up high safely.

959
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,800
You know, if you go to a city and you're like, I'm going to go up to the space needle

960
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:19,360
or, you know, do that kind of stuff that's different than like to me, like story decks.

961
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:23,360
Yeah, I just like had a panic attack of when because I went to Orlando

962
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:27,360
like a month ago to do the Hagrid and the Velocicoaster.

963
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,400
And on the way in when you're driving, there's that like space needle type thing

964
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,120
that like launches people out on swings.

965
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:35,680
Oh, yeah.

966
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,880
It is like, yeah, my stomach like fell when I saw that.

967
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:39,760
And I was like, I don't know.

968
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:43,680
Like, it's like the what's the thing in Vegas that also is like a space

969
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:44,480
needle kind of thing.

970
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,680
Oh, I know what you're talking about.

971
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:46,800
Yeah, I don't know the name of it.

972
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:50,720
But like that is terrifying because it is feels like, oh, that's just like one chain.

973
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:51,600
Yeah.

974
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,320
Yeah.

975
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,080
The fun spot thing, you mean?

976
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:54,720
Yeah.

977
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,120
Yeah.

978
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:55,840
Yeah.

979
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:59,280
The subject of podcasts, the rides lost episode.

980
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:05,040
That was the sort of subject a little bit accidentally.

981
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:05,280
Yeah.

982
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,480
Whole episode was dead.

983
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,440
We've we've kept it secret from the audience, but it's our

984
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,720
secret shame.

985
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:16,160
I mean, look, the somebody when I first started recording podcasts and got into this world,

986
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:19,280
somebody was like, you know, we just lose episodes every once in a while.

987
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,160
And I was like, what?

988
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:24,080
How mean now like your goals you can't lose one.

989
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,920
I'm like, yeah, that just happens sometimes.

990
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,040
Yeah, it's just going to happen.

991
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,240
You just have to get used to it.

992
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:28,960
It's OK.

993
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,800
Wait, so you're saying it's normal.

994
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:31,520
Like we shouldn't be.

995
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,320
It took us four years.

996
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,280
So pretty good.

997
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:35,780
Yeah.

998
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:36,280
Yeah.

999
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:36,880
Well, no, too.

1000
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:37,360
We've done two.

1001
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:37,920
We've lost two.

1002
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:39,440
That's that's pretty good.

1003
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,480
I think you guys are doing great.

1004
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:40,980
Yeah.

1005
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,760
City Walk saw the fans.

1006
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,520
That's our that's our inside.

1007
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:48,160
Now there was one of the sectors had to be redone.

1008
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:48,560
Yeah.

1009
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:56,960
Can you imagine imagine what was imagine the alternate sector to what riff heights were reached?

1010
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:57,920
Hot dog jokes.

1011
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,000
What do we make in that one?

1012
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,040
Who knows?

1013
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:05,040
Crepe observations were too gold to be repeated.

1014
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,040
Yeah, I was I was also just like

1015
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:10,880
cannibal is like scary and then it kind of tapers out from there.

1016
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,400
I feel like as a roller coaster.

1017
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,600
Yeah, that's nice.

1018
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,520
Get the get the scary stuff done early.

1019
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:16,240
Yeah.

1020
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:20,320
Yeah, a lot of those hang times like that where it's like the big gimmick is up at the top and

1021
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,200
then it's just fun.

1022
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:26,640
But then there's like other stuff at Six Flags or the like what's the one that crushed my

1023
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:29,120
genitals on Six Flags that was the whole losses.

1024
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:32,080
Twisted Colossus was terrifying from start to finish.

1025
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:32,720
Oh, geez.

1026
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,560
Wait, was that a Green Lantern one?

1027
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:34,720
No.

1028
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:35,360
Oh, that's it.

1029
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:35,760
No, no, no.

1030
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,720
I did that one.

1031
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,320
I think was already shut down.

1032
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,000
Okay, it was hurting too many people.

1033
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,960
People were too like in track like in pain.

1034
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,600
Oh, that was kind of a notorious like didn't.

1035
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:48,080
Yeah, it was like a weird kind of lazy figure.

1036
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:52,080
I know it's not quite that but like a figure eight where it was like the cars were on the side.

1037
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:56,880
Defunct landed one video about it and it's like kind of like the cars would like twist like this.

1038
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:01,280
And so like all of a sudden would just like drop and people would just be like rock slam

1039
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:05,360
their head like rocked in the cars and everyone hated it.

1040
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,840
This used to be the idea of parks.

1041
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:12,480
I feel like in the 20s, 30s, 40s, if you weren't like banging your head around,

1042
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,440
you weren't really doing it.

1043
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,000
That's true.

1044
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,560
I mean, we were we have a privileged time in theme parks where it's like

1045
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,160
and we haven't done Velocicoaster.

1046
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:24,160
We haven't done Velocicoaster but I have heard it's like the smoothest.

1047
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,320
Yeah, so I don't want to spoil anything or anything.

1048
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:30,160
I'm somebody who I didn't realize that also until like again,

1049
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,920
like thinking about theme parks more.

1050
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:35,280
I was like, oh, yeah, I don't really want to watch a video before I go on.

1051
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:39,680
Like, yeah, I know it won't ruin the magic for me, but it's almost like if I can help it.

1052
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:43,360
But yeah, I will say that about Velocicoaster, especially because I did the Hulk one

1053
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
like within the same time frame.

1054
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:50,560
And yeah, I was like, oh, I've never ridden a roller coaster that was made now.

1055
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:54,240
I'm always we're always riding things that were developed with technology from like 20 years.

1056
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:57,280
The grass and is the smoothest roller coaster I've ever been on.

1057
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:00,800
It seems like a lot of lagoon is pretty new.

1058
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:01,440
When did you go?

1059
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,240
When's the last time?

1060
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,800
2019 and oh, so the stuff.

1061
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,320
Most of their big stuff was there.

1062
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:09,600
Yeah, it doesn't seem like it's changed much since I went there.

1063
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:12,800
The other really cool one was Wicked, where it was just like

1064
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,720
it just literally is like it launches you up.

1065
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:15,680
Wow.

1066
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:19,120
And then and then, yeah, it is kind of like a chill thing after that.

1067
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,160
That was my memory of it.

1068
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:24,560
But it is like again, like to me, the terrifying thing of where you're like

1069
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:29,520
where you're changing the angle of which you're like sitting still is terrifying to me for some reason.

1070
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:29,920
Yeah, yeah.

1071
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:33,200
Because it's recapturing that, you know, it's recapturing that of like

1072
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,200
when you're waiting up at the top for the drop.

1073
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,240
Oh, sure, sure.

1074
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:41,120
I saw a video that had the dreaded swing back on that.

1075
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:46,080
Like it went it launched, it went up and it didn't quite make it and it came back down.

1076
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:46,640
Oh, wow.

1077
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:50,720
Which the ride we talked about Kingda Ka a while ago, that happens all the time.

1078
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,240
I think that's very normal.

1079
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:54,080
Maybe not on this Wicked ride.

1080
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,920
That might have been rare.

1081
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:57,520
A little alarm.

1082
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:59,920
I think they just got it together and then just went again.

1083
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:02,480
That wasn't like the day is over at Wicked, but.

1084
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:05,360
Yeah, it looks I mean, it looks like I check the website.

1085
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:06,400
It looks like it's still open.

1086
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:09,440
Yeah, it doesn't seem like much has changed since I've been there.

1087
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,680
Like in yeah, Cannibal, I think is their newest one.

1088
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:15,840
And yeah, the rest of the rides I felt like because again,

1089
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:20,560
it's that thing of like when you have a pass, I feel like other than when I went to Orlando,

1090
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:27,280
where I truly was there for like 48 hours just to go to Islands of Adventure and Universal.

1091
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:32,400
I feel like now going to Laguna was like, OK, like Brenna's family lives

1092
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:36,400
here, so if I want to go again and catch things that I missed, like it was kind of there was no

1093
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:39,360
pressure to like pack the day with every single ride.

1094
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:39,760
Sure.

1095
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:40,240
Yeah.

1096
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:43,200
And it does have 10 roller coasters.

1097
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:47,440
Like it is one of the larger collection of coasters in the Western U.S.

1098
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:54,480
I'm surprised it's not talked about more, but it is also family run, family run owned.

1099
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:59,840
So I think it's not is it has it been the same family like forever and ever?

1100
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:03,760
Because I think it is if it is who ran in the 50s and 60s, I think it's not Mormon.

1101
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:05,520
Oddly, I think it is.

1102
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:08,240
I think it's Catholic, which is rare out there.

1103
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:09,280
I think it's been bought.

1104
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:11,360
It was like slowly purchased.

1105
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:11,840
Oh, OK.

1106
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:12,320
OK.

1107
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:13,120
So it might not be this.

1108
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:15,280
It goes all the way back to 1886.

1109
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:21,280
So it's changed hands a number of times and morphed and there's been fires and.

1110
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:22,800
Yeah, that surprised me learning about it.

1111
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:26,640
It's like, can you call it the same theme park if it completely burned down to the ground and

1112
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,160
they started over like?

1113
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:28,560
Yeah.

1114
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:35,280
Early on, there was a big emphasis on like, yeah, a freshwater swimming pool and a walking.

1115
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:36,000
You can come.

1116
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,560
I think you can still do the walking trail like year round around the property.

1117
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:45,040
Yeah, but it's it's very it's a very old time park.

1118
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:45,280
Yeah.

1119
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,680
Well, that's what I kind of liked about it as far as like, again,

1120
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,000
going to theme parks a lot.

1121
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,120
It's like I appreciate the times where you can kind of like the pioneer village is great

1122
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:56,400
because it was like, cool, I'll get an ice cream, get a slushy or whatever and

1123
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:00,080
just walk around and then go on a coaster like kind of that back and forth.

1124
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:02,640
And like the swing chill at some point, don't you?

1125
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:07,040
It's hard to I think I think and I think people who just say they don't like theme parks are

1126
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:09,760
probably people who felt like, well, I got to get to ends up.

1127
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:12,160
You're just running a gun and you're in a line and it's stressful.

1128
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:18,400
And I think if you approach it, chill, at least build in some chill, you'll have a different.

1129
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,080
Yeah, yeah, no, totally.

1130
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:24,480
And like the swings there have the coolest name turn of the century.

1131
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:25,760
And it's just a swing ride.

1132
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,360
But it's like, oh, that's cool.

1133
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:28,560
It feels like built up more.

1134
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:31,520
And that was I think that was the first ride we did there.

1135
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:32,720
And it is over that lake.

1136
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:35,600
And you can see like the you can see like where you can walk.

1137
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:38,320
And they also had a there's a water park there as well, too.

1138
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:43,360
But it was closed because I guess September is already winter and slowly.

1139
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:43,680
I don't know.

1140
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:49,440
But like, OK, and then they also I think they're phasing out their zoo because I remember we

1141
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:53,680
walked like we walked by tiger cages, but I don't think I saw any tigers.

1142
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:56,880
Well, I heard there was just a tiger, just one tiger.

1143
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:00,960
Like there's a party rather than there's just suddenly a tiger in a cage.

1144
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:01,680
The tiger.

1145
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:02,720
The tiger.

1146
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:05,680
But yes, there could have been more animals and I just missed it.

1147
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:09,440
We can't probably believe the water park is called Laguna Beach.

1148
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:10,640
Yeah.

1149
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:11,600
Oh, I didn't remember.

1150
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:12,320
I don't remember that.

1151
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:13,040
That's so funny.

1152
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:15,280
Lagoon Beach.

1153
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:16,720
Yes, a beach.

1154
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:20,160
Which is funny to use lagoon, which is already water based.

1155
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:20,720
Yeah.

1156
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:22,000
And the Laguna Beach.

1157
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:22,560
Yeah.

1158
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:23,360
But it's fun.

1159
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:24,560
I'm not mad at it.

1160
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:24,880
Yeah.

1161
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:28,080
That's like a pun that original California Adventure would have done.

1162
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:29,840
Yeah, for sure.

1163
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:31,280
Hey, a lot of great naming stuff.

1164
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:34,880
I mean, the best named thing here is Terror Ride.

1165
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:35,380
Yeah.

1166
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:36,240
Oh, yeah.

1167
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:40,240
Manto of Terror and Ride like and a great logo.

1168
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:45,280
Terror Ride, the Lagoon logo, the multicolored Lagoon logo, like some really fun logos.

1169
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:49,200
There's also the extreme area called the X Venture Zone.

1170
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:52,240
Honestly, don't even remember that.

1171
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:56,640
It's it's you know, it is a thing where you appreciate really good design.

1172
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:59,760
I feel like with Disneyland, I can like see it in my sleep.

1173
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:02,640
Like the layout Laguna is like six flags.

1174
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:04,160
It's just all over the place.

1175
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:06,320
Dead ends and doubling back.

1176
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:10,960
Again, like it feels like what's great about it is that the stuff there that's great is

1177
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:11,600
really great.

1178
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:14,560
And that like I mean, Cannibal is truly like a memorable experience.

1179
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:18,560
But I was going to say, do you guys count water parks as theme parks or is that a separate thing?

1180
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:18,960
Sure.

1181
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:19,360
I do.

1182
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:20,560
Yeah, yeah, I think so.

1183
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:22,560
Well, I've said it before.

1184
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:28,640
I don't like this thing where Universal says volcano Bay is their third part that I don't.

1185
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:29,200
It's a water theme park.

1186
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:31,440
It's a third part.

1187
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:33,280
No, no, it's made up.

1188
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:35,920
Not the same thing.

1189
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,200
You haven't been, though.

1190
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:38,640
I haven't been, no, but.

1191
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:40,400
Because it is.

1192
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:41,200
I've said this before.

1193
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:42,320
I'm sure I said this in the podcast.

1194
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,080
Have you been to volcano Bay?

1195
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:46,720
Well, I saw it from the hotel I was staying at.

1196
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:47,040
OK.

1197
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:49,600
And I was very charming when the like volcano would go off.

1198
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:50,160
Yeah.

1199
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:54,000
I was sitting in like the way I was just like standing in the way pool, just looking at the fake

1200
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
volcano being like this is so good.

1201
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:56,800
I love this.

1202
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:00,320
It seems very it seems like an excellent water park.

1203
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:05,120
But how do you say it's the same thing as these parks that have 40 rides or whatever?

1204
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:08,720
Yeah, because to me, I never it feels different because like growing up,

1205
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:12,560
there was raging waters and wild rivers in Southern California.

1206
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:15,760
And so that to me was like like, well, we're going to Disneyland.

1207
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:16,960
Wait, where's Wild Rivers?

1208
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:18,400
Wild Rivers was an Irvine.

1209
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,960
It was also where I think where the Irvine Spectrum is now.

1210
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:21,920
Yes.

1211
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:28,080
And with the or like, is it in the same negative ways as that concert venue where you have to hike two miles?

1212
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:28,320
Yes.

1213
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:29,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1214
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,320
I saw a K-Rock.

1215
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,320
No, not weenie roast.

1216
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:33,440
Maybe it was weenie roast.

1217
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:35,040
Almost acoustic Christmas.

1218
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:38,080
Maybe I saw a K-Rock summer thing.

1219
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:39,680
Oh, but not sorry.

1220
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:40,560
I wouldn't have a Christmas.

1221
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:41,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1222
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:44,640
And went to wango tango at the Rose Bowl one year in high school.

1223
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:49,440
But they also had the tiger, the drive through Tiger Safari out in that part of Irvine as well.

1224
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:50,160
Oh, right.

1225
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:50,480
Right.

1226
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:51,520
I've heard of that a little bit.

1227
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:52,720
Like that is a weird.

1228
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:52,960
Yeah.

1229
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:54,240
More than one tiger there.

1230
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:55,520
I think so.

1231
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:56,080
More than one.

1232
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:56,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1233
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:57,840
I think a few lions.

1234
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:00,560
And yeah, it's weird that they had stuff like that.

1235
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:04,720
It feels like Lagoon had more of that stuff, but I don't I don't remember because again,

1236
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:06,720
it's like I saw multiple cages.

1237
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:06,880
Yeah.

1238
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:07,840
Well, there was a whole pack.

1239
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:10,720
You could they raised horses there for a while.

1240
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:13,040
I read like they were trying a lot of stuff out.

1241
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:13,280
I feel.

1242
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:13,520
Yeah.

1243
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:15,360
It's been around for so long.

1244
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:17,280
Yeah.

1245
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:18,560
Lagoon really they experiment.

1246
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:19,360
They were experimentally.

1247
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:19,760
Yeah, yeah.

1248
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:20,800
And the old days.

1249
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:21,520
Indeed.

1250
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:26,560
The thing that really stuck with me about this part, just because it was so specific,

1251
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:31,840
not only is there a haunted attraction called Terror Ride, there's another attraction called

1252
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:35,280
Dracula's Castle, which is very similar.

1253
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,000
I think Terror Ride looks better.

1254
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:42,160
Terror Ride, I think, had a big like 50th anniversary and they redid a lot of it,

1255
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:43,760
put in new lighting and effects and stuff.

1256
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:45,760
And I was like, oh, I like Terror Ride.

1257
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,760
I like I like both of these a lot.

1258
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:51,200
If we if I were to go there, I'd make a beeline for these two.

1259
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:52,000
These are great.

1260
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,320
I think I'm trying to remember because I feel like I would have done that.

1261
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:58,640
But I think maybe it was maybe shut down for like me, like because I know it was also there

1262
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,160
when they were setting up for Halloween.

1263
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:04,720
So I feel like because to me, yeah, I love it's a dark ride, right?

1264
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:04,960
Yeah.

1265
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:07,360
They I feel like I would have gone like that would have been the first.

1266
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:09,520
I also really like Dark Ride, so I feel like I would have gone to it,

1267
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:11,920
but I don't remember being on the agenda.

1268
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:16,000
Two big, spooky dark rides like that's awesome.

1269
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:22,320
Although watching the videos, I was like, I think the doors on these rides are pushed open by your car.

1270
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:24,960
Like just oh, it just slams.

1271
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:28,880
I think it slams the doors open or it's just the timing.

1272
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:34,400
But I swear I heard a thunk as like the the rider's vehicle was going through the door.

1273
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:39,120
Well, the video I watched that seems in line with we might have watched the same one,

1274
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:45,040
but then also like there's you kind of like three sets of doors swing open and just dark unthemed

1275
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:45,920
hallways.

1276
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:49,520
And in the second one, you see a woman in a mask just there.

1277
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:50,080
The woman just scared me.

1278
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:51,760
Yeah.

1279
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:58,720
And there's some like just simple scares in that that I probably would have jumped if I was riding

1280
00:50:59,520 --> 00:50:59,840
it.

1281
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:03,920
But there's like a terror ride video and I think it's that one.

1282
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:06,320
It's either from 2020 or 2021.

1283
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:13,760
And you can just tell how good low level phone video or GoPro video has gotten because like the one from

1284
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:17,920
2017, you can barely make stuff out of the 2021.

1285
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:19,040
It's so crisp.

1286
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:23,280
Yeah, I might have to watch these videos because yeah, I remember maybe it was just in that

1287
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:25,760
transition of setting up for Halloween and it was confusing.

1288
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:28,880
I'd never been there before and it hadn't been for a while either.

1289
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:34,320
So it was just like, yeah, we we really focused on getting a couple of those key roller coasters

1290
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:39,440
checking because part of that trip also was like I'm just fascinated by Mormon history and it just

1291
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:42,160
it's such a weird wild world that that whole thing is.

1292
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:46,400
So we like that was like also checking out the Pioneer Village and there's like I mean, it truly

1293
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:51,680
is like a full size little city like like, you know, like the back lot at Universal.

1294
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:55,440
Like you'd walk through the whole town kind of like there's the general store and all that kind

1295
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:56,000
of thing.

1296
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,600
Was it Mormon furniture?

1297
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:58,400
Yes, yes.

1298
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:02,000
Something they have that seemed like the most active Mormon representation.

1299
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:02,880
It was very exciting.

1300
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:03,600
I really enjoyed it.

1301
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:06,400
It's not like a mayor though of the city, right?

1302
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:08,160
Like it's not like it's not like it's not.

1303
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:08,720
I agree.

1304
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:12,400
Yeah, but it doesn't seem like it's got like a whole like town populated.

1305
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:15,200
They don't even have like a Joseph Smith walk around or anything.

1306
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:17,440
No, no, which is what you need.

1307
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:17,600
Yeah.

1308
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:21,200
Well, if you fight like behind it, there'd be like a little area where they find the plates

1309
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:27,200
like every hour, you know, it's like, oh my, like, you know, like not Mephisto with the name

1310
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:28,400
Mordecai, not Mordecai.

1311
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:29,840
Oh, yeah.

1312
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:31,760
It's an M name that comes up.

1313
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:34,320
The angel comes upon Joseph Smith gives me a vision.

1314
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:34,640
Right.

1315
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:35,120
Yeah.

1316
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:39,040
We're all sure we're all just trying to rewatch that one South Park episode in our heads.

1317
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:41,120
The main way we all know the story.

1318
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:43,360
It's in the one Book of Mormon song, too.

1319
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:44,800
Yeah, I can't think of it.

1320
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:46,560
He's on the top of every Mormon temple.

1321
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:47,760
He's the gold statue.

1322
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:49,280
But we apologize for not knowing this.

1323
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:51,200
A Molok is the devil.

1324
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:52,080
It's not Molok.

1325
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:53,680
What is it?

1326
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:55,280
Yeah, like Zaya.

1327
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:57,040
There's a book of Mosaic.

1328
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:58,000
I don't know if it is.

1329
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:58,480
I don't know.

1330
00:52:58,480 --> 00:52:59,200
Might be.

1331
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:00,800
Can you buy seer stones?

1332
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:03,040
Do they have seer stones?

1333
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:03,680
Moroni.

1334
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:05,600
Moroni.

1335
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:06,560
Moroni.

1336
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:07,040
Yeah.

1337
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:07,440
Moroni.

1338
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:10,240
Moroni is not Mazaya.

1339
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:13,040
Yeah, it comes down.

1340
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:13,840
There's a vision.

1341
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:18,240
You get to participate because I think Joseph Smith had a bunch of people swear that they

1342
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:19,280
also saw the plates.

1343
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:21,440
You're saying they do do this or they should?

1344
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:22,400
They should do this.

1345
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:28,160
I don't know that they have as good a sense of humor as say the not ghost town, like Prospector.

1346
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:29,280
Yeah.

1347
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:35,520
But we've encountered religious parks, the Holy Land Experience, where there are

1348
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:37,360
Jesuses and crucifixions.

1349
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:41,040
And so why not get your why not get everyone's favorite characters out there?

1350
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:41,440
Yeah.

1351
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:42,960
Moroni and Joseph Smith.

1352
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:48,240
I do understand them playing to the Mormon crowd and population, but it did surprise me that

1353
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:52,720
the food and drink section of the park's website is just everyone drinking giant

1354
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:55,280
Oktoberfest beers from the beer garden.

1355
00:53:55,920 --> 00:54:02,400
And because you can get alcohol in Utah and Salt Lake City and stuff, but it's like weird

1356
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,640
portions, like we regulate it.

1357
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:08,240
I read a lot of stuff relaxed after the Olympics in 2002 just now.

1358
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:08,800
Oh, yeah.

1359
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:13,920
That's when like all like there were some weirder laws, but I think mostly they were just

1360
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:15,200
like, we got to make that money.

1361
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:19,840
Well, and yeah, the beers used to be like lower alcohol content in general all over

1362
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:20,320
Utah.

1363
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:21,760
And then, yeah, I think all that's changed.

1364
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:27,440
I got the vibe there that like with Oktoberfest stuff, like people were excited.

1365
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:29,040
Like it was like, oh, cool.

1366
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:31,600
Like we can get trashed at like.

1367
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:32,800
Oh, OK.

1368
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:36,720
It really was special in a way that like at another theme park and event like that

1369
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:37,840
might be like, oh, whatever.

1370
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:38,240
Who cares?

1371
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:38,880
But yeah, yeah.

1372
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:41,120
Universal is very par for the course now.

1373
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:42,880
You're there to drink a ton.

1374
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:43,200
Yeah.

1375
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:43,680
Yeah.

1376
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:44,000
Yes.

1377
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:44,800
So exactly.

1378
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:48,960
Well, yeah, I mean, part of Brennan is like when we started dating was we do the

1379
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:53,680
challenge because at the Jurassic Park ride, they used to have the two stalls.

1380
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:57,360
And so you had to try and drink like you had to try and drink as many tall boys before

1381
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:58,960
you get to the front of the Jurassic line.

1382
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:00,800
We both did, too.

1383
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:01,920
Again, this too number.

1384
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:03,280
He's yeah, yeah, yeah.

1385
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:05,360
Because you end up at two, whatever the challenge is.

1386
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:06,800
Yeah, because that was before the pass.

1387
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:09,840
So it was like, how do you pass, you know, two hours waiting in line?

1388
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:13,600
You know, especially if you're just meeting somebody for the first time or like

1389
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:15,680
second or third date or whatever.

1390
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:18,560
It's just sort of like, all right, well, we're going to hang out for two hours in line.

1391
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:20,320
Oh, yeah, that's big.

1392
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:23,840
If you're getting to know somebody, that could you don't want you don't want the

1393
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:28,160
relationship to unravel in line because the line was too long and boring.

1394
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:28,720
Yeah, exactly.

1395
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:30,960
At the start of the line, you're like into each other by the end.

1396
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:31,520
You're like, you know what?

1397
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:35,040
This isn't going to work out if you just picked like a 45 minute.

1398
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:36,560
Yeah, you might have survived.

1399
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:37,280
How do you?

1400
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:40,480
Yeah, there's so many other factors that are weighing in everyone at the time.

1401
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:45,760
Yeah, I think the Jurassic ride is the best ride, I think, for a date in that sense,

1402
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:47,840
because you got the misters going on a hot day.

1403
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:50,480
Like the mummy ride is a little weird because you're like, can't tell if

1404
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:54,160
the if you're when you're in line, if you are if somebody is paying attention to

1405
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:57,840
or somebody's going off somewhere else, you open your phone, it's like, like.

1406
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:00,960
Yeah, a good date line.

1407
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:04,400
Yes, I've never thought about that.

1408
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:06,400
I know.

1409
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:11,200
I mean, you know, I love love radiator springs is, you know, you take those of so many times

1410
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:14,640
you take the beer into that line and that seems like a good recently.

1411
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:17,280
Scott has said, I mean, I think he feels this way about lines and dates.

1412
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:18,400
He just wants to cut to the chase.

1413
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:22,240
I mean, hang on.

1414
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:28,720
You cannot get done to bring that one in.

1415
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:31,760
By the way, I want to say, didn't see a lot of Scott is wrong.

1416
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:32,480
Well, that's coming up.

1417
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:35,200
Didn't see a lot of Scott is coming out on a future episode.

1418
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:36,400
I have a collection of emails.

1419
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:40,160
Wait, but the email was Scott is right.

1420
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:43,760
It's I created the email address and there are emails.

1421
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:46,000
I'm just saying it was not on this episode, but we'll get to that.

1422
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:46,880
Interesting.

1423
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:48,960
Yeah, we'll get to them feeling good.

1424
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:50,640
I don't I wasn't canceled for that.

1425
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:54,160
I wasn't canceled for saying the Haunted Mansion Attic isn't that good.

1426
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:57,360
Well, I feel like I'm all streaked since we're on a Scott kick.

1427
00:56:57,360 --> 00:57:02,400
Let me ask because I didn't want to like do this on second gate and have less people

1428
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:04,080
hear the explanation.

1429
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:09,760
So I do want to know and you know, because you're a listener, Steven,

1430
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:12,480
you may have seen this going around on Twitter.

1431
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:16,640
Scott, what is the story of the picture with Paris Hilton, Kim Kardashian?

1432
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:19,360
Just like you in the background.

1433
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:23,280
So I was I was I was worried you were going to cancel me or something.

1434
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:24,240
There's going to be something bad.

1435
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:30,320
So I suppose where did Inquisition was coming?

1436
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:32,400
Oh, yeah. So this came up recently.

1437
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:38,320
I'm in a photograph with Paris Hilton, Kim Kardashian and Justin Timberlake.

1438
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:41,360
And it's because we hung all the time and it was just like a regular thing.

1439
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:42,240
There's no story really.

1440
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:46,080
No, it was just a I like through some odd connection.

1441
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:49,360
I got to go to the premiere of the movie Alpha Dog.

1442
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:52,080
We all recall Alpha Dog very well.

1443
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:56,960
And which we're like, oh, maybe maybe Timberlake will be there.

1444
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:57,440
That's great.

1445
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,080
We got a sense of what the movie was going to be in.

1446
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:03,840
Like you want to not watch the movie and I guess in typical Scott fashion.

1447
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:05,280
So I didn't see the movie.

1448
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:09,040
I just left, wandered around Hollywood and then came back for the party.

1449
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:11,920
And then really wanted a picture with Timberlake

1450
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:14,960
because this was future sex love sounds era.

1451
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:17,040
So when Timberlake is never cooler.

1452
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:20,720
And so we were waiting around to get a photo.

1453
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:28,160
My now wife, Erin and I and did not realize that as we were waiting there,

1454
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:31,680
trying to get through to his table that I didn't know Paris Hilton was there.

1455
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:33,920
And at the time, I didn't know who Kim Kardashian was.

1456
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:36,320
Well, because she was Paris's assistant still.

1457
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:37,120
Is that real?

1458
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:38,160
Whoa, yeah.

1459
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:42,640
That was how she kind of her first claim to fame.

1460
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:43,200
Yeah.

1461
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:44,720
Besides the family connection.

1462
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:46,000
OK.

1463
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,120
Oh, God, I didn't realize that.

1464
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:50,080
Yeah, she looks a little more like functional in the pay.

1465
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:52,880
Almost looks like she's like to like, she looks like schedule something.

1466
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:53,840
Yeah, yeah, I think so.

1467
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:56,800
Not as glammed up maybe.

1468
00:58:56,800 --> 00:59:02,960
And like, so yeah, so I did not know what photograph I was in basically,

1469
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:07,840
but I think it's very rare that there is a photo of these three people in one place.

1470
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:12,960
So if anything ever needs that, or I think somebody found it in a meme type setting,

1471
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:18,960
but I've also heard over the years, hey, I was watching Extra and it was zooming around a photo

1472
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:22,080
and I saw you in the photo and what's going on with it.

1473
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:30,480
So I snuck into this like grand trio meeting of minds that I had no idea was going on.

1474
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:33,680
Although maybe I maybe Tim really didn't know who she was at the time either.

1475
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:36,640
He might not have like, oh, Paris's assistant.

1476
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:37,040
All right.

1477
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:39,200
Well, call me when a real star shows up.

1478
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:39,680
I don't know.

1479
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:41,760
I don't know his feeling at the time.

1480
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:47,760
But the other part of that story is that then we got up to we did get through to him,

1481
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:48,800
got a picture.

1482
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:50,480
He said, yeah, sure.

1483
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:51,120
20 bucks.

1484
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:53,840
And we were like, that's funny.

1485
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:55,120
And he said, no, really.

1486
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:59,760
And then put his hand out and we were like, well, you know what?

1487
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:03,200
When in Rome, we want a picture with Timberlake.

1488
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:05,120
And in the photo, I look a little freaked out.

1489
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:10,000
Just because I'm thinking about that, like, oh my God, he's holding our money right now.

1490
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:10,500
Wow.

1491
01:00:11,140 --> 01:00:12,100
Yeah, it was a little like this.

1492
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:14,500
Wait, is this the deal with this kind of guy?

1493
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:17,380
So we took the photo and like, Jesus, oh, so he sucks.

1494
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:18,260
And we're in the photo.

1495
01:00:18,260 --> 01:00:21,940
In the photo, our face is like, wow, this is us meeting Timberlake and now realizing he sucks.

1496
01:00:21,940 --> 01:00:23,300
And then photo snapped.

1497
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:24,420
And then he said, I'm just kidding.

1498
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:24,740
Here you go.

1499
01:00:24,740 --> 01:00:25,240
Hand it.

1500
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:25,740
Oh, wow.

1501
01:00:25,740 --> 01:00:26,420
OK.

1502
01:00:26,420 --> 01:00:29,140
So that might be his little shtick.

1503
01:00:29,140 --> 01:00:30,820
It's a little power move still.

1504
01:00:30,820 --> 01:00:31,380
Yeah.

1505
01:00:31,380 --> 01:00:32,660
But yeah, yeah, yeah.

1506
01:00:32,660 --> 01:00:32,900
Yeah.

1507
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:38,020
And to see like how far will people it's like, yeah, like, can I make people right?

1508
01:00:38,020 --> 01:00:38,520
Right.

1509
01:00:39,220 --> 01:00:39,860
Anyway.

1510
01:00:39,860 --> 01:00:40,360
Yeah.

1511
01:00:40,740 --> 01:00:43,460
Look, guys, I met a real MMC member.

1512
01:00:43,460 --> 01:00:46,420
Another classic Hollywood sicko trip.

1513
01:00:47,140 --> 01:00:47,700
I was going to say.

1514
01:00:47,700 --> 01:00:49,380
What's it like out here, folks?

1515
01:00:49,380 --> 01:00:54,020
I was going to say it almost reminds me of like this kind of philosophy that really I

1516
01:00:54,020 --> 01:00:57,220
didn't realize was taking over rides, that idea of like, you're the hero.

1517
01:00:57,780 --> 01:01:01,060
So in that moment, that's like, if that was a ride like Hollywood, the ride,

1518
01:01:01,060 --> 01:01:02,580
like you would be the hero.

1519
01:01:02,580 --> 01:01:05,780
You're getting to mix it up with the rest of the Avengers kind of thing.

1520
01:01:05,780 --> 01:01:06,500
Oh, true.

1521
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:07,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1522
01:01:07,460 --> 01:01:08,020
Yes.

1523
01:01:08,020 --> 01:01:10,100
You're the every man that you're in it.

1524
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:12,580
You're experiencing the yeah, yeah.

1525
01:01:12,580 --> 01:01:14,500
It's the intimacy of the ride.

1526
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:14,820
Yes.

1527
01:01:14,820 --> 01:01:16,500
Justin Timberlake is talking to you.

1528
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:17,780
He's taking your money.

1529
01:01:17,780 --> 01:01:19,380
Superstar limo.

1530
01:01:19,380 --> 01:01:19,880
Yes.

1531
01:01:21,140 --> 01:01:23,460
I was like, assistant, the ride sounds awful.

1532
01:01:24,020 --> 01:01:26,660
That's probably more stressful.

1533
01:01:26,660 --> 01:01:27,160
Yes.

1534
01:01:28,020 --> 01:01:29,300
More action, maybe.

1535
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:29,620
Yeah.

1536
01:01:29,620 --> 01:01:31,860
Running around town, more near accidents.

1537
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:35,780
You're like in the middle of the queue and like somebody comes out like a secret accent

1538
01:01:35,780 --> 01:01:36,900
and goes, no, you're on now.

1539
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:39,140
Now is when you're on the ride and they just throw you on the ride.

1540
01:01:39,140 --> 01:01:40,580
You don't even get a chance to like buckle in.

1541
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:41,860
It's so stressful.

1542
01:01:41,860 --> 01:01:42,820
You got to deal with something.

1543
01:01:43,780 --> 01:01:44,820
Can I bring up something?

1544
01:01:44,820 --> 01:01:46,180
And I guess we're on a Scott kick.

1545
01:01:46,180 --> 01:01:46,980
Let's bring up something.

1546
01:01:46,980 --> 01:01:48,340
Oh, I know it's going.

1547
01:01:48,340 --> 01:01:49,460
You know where we're going here.

1548
01:01:49,460 --> 01:01:49,780
Yeah.

1549
01:01:49,780 --> 01:01:50,900
You did not know this before.

1550
01:01:51,460 --> 01:01:52,740
I never made the connection.

1551
01:01:52,740 --> 01:01:52,900
No.

1552
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:53,380
Okay.

1553
01:01:53,380 --> 01:01:54,020
Yeah.

1554
01:01:54,020 --> 01:01:56,660
This was a place where a lot of bands played.

1555
01:01:57,220 --> 01:01:59,780
Gager bands, the Rolling Stones played.

1556
01:02:01,060 --> 01:02:03,300
Sam the Sham and the Pharaohs played there.

1557
01:02:03,940 --> 01:02:05,620
The band that did Wooly Bully.

1558
01:02:05,620 --> 01:02:06,340
We didn't be.

1559
01:02:06,340 --> 01:02:07,060
That is the most.

1560
01:02:07,540 --> 01:02:12,180
Knowing the other bands that are on the list and then you went to Sam the Shan.

1561
01:02:12,980 --> 01:02:13,220
What?

1562
01:02:13,220 --> 01:02:16,500
The I've never even thought about the name of the Wooly Bully band.

1563
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:18,900
Sam the Sham and the Pharaohs, which I did a little researching because I

1564
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:22,500
skipped past the doors and went straight to the Pharaohs.

1565
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:26,500
Who named something people have heard of like Artie Shaw, Benny Goodman.

1566
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:28,260
Well, that's a different that's for your part.

1567
01:02:28,260 --> 01:02:30,740
That's for your part of this musical performance.

1568
01:02:30,740 --> 01:02:31,540
Glenn Miller.

1569
01:02:31,540 --> 01:02:32,740
We talk about Miller.

1570
01:02:33,460 --> 01:02:35,300
But of course, the Beach Boys play there.

1571
01:02:36,100 --> 01:02:40,900
And this is a theme park featured in a song by the Beach Boys.

1572
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:41,860
Yes, indeed.

1573
01:02:43,300 --> 01:02:48,180
I'm so glad this topic came up because I certainly know the song.

1574
01:02:48,180 --> 01:02:49,620
The song Salt Lake City.

1575
01:02:49,620 --> 01:02:50,420
Of course I do.

1576
01:02:51,460 --> 01:02:53,780
And I never thought about what the lyrics were.

1577
01:02:53,780 --> 01:02:55,220
It was just like nonsense to me.

1578
01:02:55,220 --> 01:02:58,420
But now, of course, now I understand Laguna's reference.

1579
01:02:58,420 --> 01:03:00,020
There's a park near the city.

1580
01:03:00,020 --> 01:03:03,140
Yeah, all the kids dig the lagoon now.

1581
01:03:03,140 --> 01:03:07,620
It's filled with all kinds of girls and rides and we'll be flying there soon now.

1582
01:03:08,260 --> 01:03:11,780
And then Brian takes over and sings and girl for girl,

1583
01:03:11,780 --> 01:03:14,820
they got the cutest of the Western states.

1584
01:03:14,820 --> 01:03:15,320
Wow.

1585
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:17,460
Girl for girl.

1586
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:18,580
Girl for girl.

1587
01:03:18,580 --> 01:03:20,340
He's running statistics.

1588
01:03:20,340 --> 01:03:21,380
Yeah, he's figured it out.

1589
01:03:22,660 --> 01:03:25,300
They got the sun in the summer and wintertime skiing is great.

1590
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:27,220
Do you disagree with anything the Beach Boys said?

1591
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:27,780
Don't disagree.

1592
01:03:27,780 --> 01:03:29,940
It's a girl for girl.

1593
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:31,220
Yeah, girl for girl.

1594
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:32,820
Well, Brenna is from Utah.

1595
01:03:32,820 --> 01:03:34,740
So I figure that would make you agree.

1596
01:03:34,740 --> 01:03:40,500
Yeah, but against all the California girls, it's the I think that is a tad insulting.

1597
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:45,940
It's on the same album as California girls that like this is like the guy with the girls

1598
01:03:45,940 --> 01:03:47,940
and all the lands in frontier land tomorrow.

1599
01:03:47,940 --> 01:03:53,940
He's like he's touting California girls and several tracks later at the Utah is girl for girl.

1600
01:03:54,580 --> 01:03:55,460
Although that's I don't know.

1601
01:03:55,460 --> 01:04:00,180
That's Brian's opinion as opposed to Mike is singing says the California girls are the best.

1602
01:04:00,180 --> 01:04:01,540
All right, that's true.

1603
01:04:01,540 --> 01:04:01,940
Yeah.

1604
01:04:01,940 --> 01:04:06,580
So lucky you in Utah, Brian Wilson thinks you're the cutest.

1605
01:04:06,580 --> 01:04:11,140
I feel like Scott, you should know which Beach Boy thinks the girls are the state the girl

1606
01:04:11,140 --> 01:04:12,180
for cutest in.

1607
01:04:12,740 --> 01:04:18,260
Each one has a different opinion that you would know from like Teen Beat interview or Tiger Beat

1608
01:04:18,260 --> 01:04:19,460
from like 1960.

1609
01:04:19,460 --> 01:04:22,740
I don't know, but they're all I mean, it's got to be California for all of them.

1610
01:04:22,740 --> 01:04:25,140
I'm trying to think of any of them even lived anywhere else.

1611
01:04:25,140 --> 01:04:27,460
Where cuties are the best in the land.

1612
01:04:29,940 --> 01:04:31,220
Dennis, that was Dennis.

1613
01:04:31,220 --> 01:04:35,460
Missoula girls, you know, it's all based on politics.

1614
01:04:35,460 --> 01:04:38,260
Like, you know, Mike's not into the Vermont girls.

1615
01:04:38,260 --> 01:04:45,300
The more liberal you get, he loves the other Florida, wherever Mar-a-Lago is, whatever town.

1616
01:04:45,300 --> 01:04:48,580
That's West Palm Beach has a kiss.

1617
01:04:48,580 --> 01:04:50,500
It really knocks me out.

1618
01:04:50,980 --> 01:04:57,700
Did they did it because we were watching some like old advertisements, but it's like it feels like

1619
01:04:57,700 --> 01:05:01,860
they could have the beach was could have given this to the lagoon to use because what a better theme

1620
01:05:01,860 --> 01:05:02,100
song.

1621
01:05:02,100 --> 01:05:03,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah, really.

1622
01:05:03,620 --> 01:05:06,580
I know like a catchy song that touts lagoon.

1623
01:05:07,620 --> 01:05:10,980
I like that the list is filled with all kinds of girls and rides.

1624
01:05:11,620 --> 01:05:12,980
Girls come number one attraction.

1625
01:05:14,500 --> 01:05:17,060
Take your girl on the terror ride.

1626
01:05:17,940 --> 01:05:21,380
For if we wrote the song, it would have girls have been like 15th.

1627
01:05:21,380 --> 01:05:24,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, list all the rides.

1628
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:25,220
They got drop ride.

1629
01:05:25,220 --> 01:05:26,260
They got dark rides.

1630
01:05:26,260 --> 01:05:28,500
They got Mormon furniture.

1631
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:29,620
Yes, museums.

1632
01:05:30,740 --> 01:05:36,820
But it has the the the Beach Boys Utah connection goes deeper because if you can imagine

1633
01:05:37,380 --> 01:05:43,620
that if still as they're playing the weird casino circuits that they tour each year with,

1634
01:05:43,620 --> 01:05:45,860
they of course end up in Salt Lake City every year.

1635
01:05:45,860 --> 01:05:50,420
They play that song probably only there because it's not like a staple Beach Boys song,

1636
01:05:50,420 --> 01:05:51,300
though I like it very much.

1637
01:05:51,300 --> 01:05:57,140
I like the song, but not only that, one of these trips is where they were talking to a girl.

1638
01:05:57,140 --> 01:06:02,100
They were talking to one of the cutest girls of the western states who is describing a scenario

1639
01:06:02,100 --> 01:06:08,820
where her her daddy took her T bird away and the song fun fun fun is based on there is a specific

1640
01:06:08,820 --> 01:06:13,060
person who has been tracked down and interviewed that is in Salt Lake City.

1641
01:06:13,060 --> 01:06:17,940
So big connection there, but it's maintained up until now and in 2005,

1642
01:06:19,060 --> 01:06:22,180
this is one of the cruddiest rabbit holes I've ever been down.

1643
01:06:22,180 --> 01:06:25,300
I'm about to describe the most groan worthy thing you ever heard.

1644
01:06:26,100 --> 01:06:31,860
2005, they play a show at the Sandy Amphitheater and their opening act was very special because

1645
01:06:31,860 --> 01:06:36,980
it was a rock and roll band led by then Utah Governor John Huntsman.

1646
01:06:37,460 --> 01:06:43,620
If people can remember this sort of like blander pre Trump era of Republican,

1647
01:06:44,660 --> 01:06:51,060
that was the GOP primaries like he was like a boring guy who ran and in I guess against Mitt Romney.

1648
01:06:52,340 --> 01:06:57,220
But this band, this guy eventually was the also the Trump ambassador to Russia.

1649
01:06:57,220 --> 01:07:00,340
Oh, what a what a job to tell me.

1650
01:07:00,340 --> 01:07:05,700
But so it's not just him, but it's a rather this this guy had like a rock past and like before he

1651
01:07:05,700 --> 01:07:10,260
turned to politics, he played in some a band called Wizard in the 70s, not the famous Wizard,

1652
01:07:10,260 --> 01:07:18,020
the less famous Wizard, right? But the the rest of the band is the then mayor of Salt Lake City

1653
01:07:18,660 --> 01:07:26,260
on drums, John Huntsman, the third, the guy's son and the CEOs and founders of Utah's biggest

1654
01:07:26,260 --> 01:07:28,420
health and natural gas companies.

1655
01:07:28,420 --> 01:07:29,140
Jesus.

1656
01:07:29,140 --> 01:07:29,940
Yes.

1657
01:07:29,940 --> 01:07:31,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1658
01:07:31,940 --> 01:07:33,140
Yeah, yeah, truly.

1659
01:07:33,140 --> 01:07:34,340
It has never been more evil.

1660
01:07:34,820 --> 01:07:39,700
The Justice Department has opened an investigation into this Utah rock band.

1661
01:07:41,220 --> 01:07:45,060
I'm about to make it more evil because they could they did they did a cover by

1662
01:07:45,940 --> 01:07:47,860
maybe the second most evil band in the world.

1663
01:07:47,860 --> 01:07:52,660
They the only thing I could find that they that was in their set, it was only four songs long.

1664
01:07:52,660 --> 01:07:58,660
And they they did what was described as a potentially 15 minute cover of the Eagles tequila sunrise.

1665
01:07:58,660 --> 01:07:59,460
Oh my God.

1666
01:07:59,460 --> 01:08:00,180
Oh my God.

1667
01:08:00,180 --> 01:08:08,820
A plodding endless Eagles cover by the governor, the mayor of the city and a guy from the CEO of

1668
01:08:08,820 --> 01:08:16,260
Merritt Medical, which was sued last year for like some doctor kickback scheme where they'd like

1669
01:08:16,260 --> 01:08:19,380
pay doctors on the slide and make them use their equipment.

1670
01:08:20,900 --> 01:08:22,660
Yeah, truly pound for pound.

1671
01:08:22,660 --> 01:08:26,180
Rock is the most evil a band of the western state.

1672
01:08:26,260 --> 01:08:29,620
And I think I assume that John Huntsman is good friends with my love, right?

1673
01:08:29,620 --> 01:08:30,500
Yeah, probably.

1674
01:08:30,500 --> 01:08:32,020
That's probably how it goes down.

1675
01:08:32,020 --> 01:08:32,820
I think so.

1676
01:08:32,820 --> 01:08:33,380
Yeah.

1677
01:08:33,380 --> 01:08:37,860
How does like a project, you know, it's like when like Russell Crowe's band or what, you know,

1678
01:08:37,860 --> 01:08:40,420
it's like, I feel like they just get a feed of grunt.

1679
01:08:40,420 --> 01:08:40,900
Yes.

1680
01:08:40,900 --> 01:08:41,380
Sorry, sir.

1681
01:08:41,380 --> 01:08:41,700
Excuse me.

1682
01:08:41,700 --> 01:08:43,780
But it's just like, I think Jason.

1683
01:08:43,780 --> 01:08:44,340
Yeah.

1684
01:08:44,340 --> 01:08:45,620
And I think, isn't it?

1685
01:08:45,620 --> 01:08:46,260
Isn't it?

1686
01:08:46,260 --> 01:08:46,820
Isn't it?

1687
01:08:46,820 --> 01:08:48,820
Oh, singular.

1688
01:08:48,820 --> 01:08:49,140
Yeah.

1689
01:08:49,140 --> 01:08:50,420
30 odd foot.

1690
01:08:50,420 --> 01:08:50,980
Oh, 30.

1691
01:08:50,980 --> 01:08:51,460
I don't know.

1692
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:52,020
Look at it.

1693
01:08:52,020 --> 01:08:53,220
It's a brutal.

1694
01:08:53,220 --> 01:08:57,380
It's a very bizarre name.

1695
01:08:57,380 --> 01:09:01,860
But yeah, it's just, it feels like, you know, it's it's there was probably some broker like,

1696
01:09:01,860 --> 01:09:02,820
well, you'd be twice.

1697
01:09:02,820 --> 01:09:07,940
We won't charge you for like the gas fees or taxes when you come through our city or

1698
01:09:07,940 --> 01:09:09,620
so, you know, some shady deal is happening.

1699
01:09:09,620 --> 01:09:09,860
Yeah.

1700
01:09:09,860 --> 01:09:10,260
Yeah.

1701
01:09:10,260 --> 01:09:11,460
Or maybe like it did.

1702
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:19,060
I don't know if Mike maybe got involved with like a like a Salt Lake City woman and like owed

1703
01:09:19,060 --> 01:09:22,020
alimony and maybe like he cut a sweetheart deal.

1704
01:09:22,020 --> 01:09:26,900
OK, so if Huntsman performs, if I make you the opening act, then I don't have to pay

1705
01:09:26,900 --> 01:09:28,340
alimony to my fifth wife.

1706
01:09:28,340 --> 01:09:30,020
Yeah, we'll throw her in jail.

1707
01:09:32,340 --> 01:09:33,300
Where she remains.

1708
01:09:35,140 --> 01:09:36,020
What did I do?

1709
01:09:36,020 --> 01:09:36,740
Just tell me.

1710
01:09:36,740 --> 01:09:37,380
Oh, man.

1711
01:09:37,380 --> 01:09:41,220
And you know, you can think about what you did for decades to come.

1712
01:09:41,220 --> 01:09:42,900
Thanks so much, John.

1713
01:09:42,900 --> 01:09:48,260
If I could, I do think while Mike Love is the most evil beach boy, I think Al Jardine is

1714
01:09:48,260 --> 01:09:53,540
considerably less evil and apparently the former owners of the park.

1715
01:09:54,180 --> 01:09:54,980
What's the guy's name?

1716
01:09:54,980 --> 01:10:00,100
Peter Fried was the owner of Lagoon and for a long time, maybe still he sent Al Jardine

1717
01:10:00,100 --> 01:10:02,180
a package of mixed nuts every Christmas.

1718
01:10:04,980 --> 01:10:05,700
There's trivia.

1719
01:10:05,700 --> 01:10:07,140
Go whoever you're with.

1720
01:10:07,140 --> 01:10:12,580
If you have like a loved one in the other room, a partner or a parent, go excitedly tell him,

1721
01:10:12,580 --> 01:10:14,180
guess what I just learned on this podcast.

1722
01:10:14,180 --> 01:10:17,860
Lagoon owner Peter Fried would send Al Jardine for the beach was a package of mixed nuts

1723
01:10:17,860 --> 01:10:18,820
every Christmas.

1724
01:10:18,820 --> 01:10:23,780
A perfect combination of words to get the response of I think we should see other people,

1725
01:10:24,580 --> 01:10:26,980
regardless of whether it's partner or parents.

1726
01:10:28,820 --> 01:10:30,340
I think I should have other children.

1727
01:10:31,380 --> 01:10:32,500
Go to your room forever.

1728
01:10:34,580 --> 01:10:36,660
Isn't the internet great that that stuff?

1729
01:10:36,660 --> 01:10:37,300
Oh, my God.

1730
01:10:37,300 --> 01:10:42,420
How could I ever have known about John Huntsman's, Governor John Huntsman's band?

1731
01:10:43,220 --> 01:10:46,740
You can also, if we're talking a little bit more about the rock and roll

1732
01:10:47,380 --> 01:10:52,500
history, Mike, you also skip past the who and Jimi Hendrix to go to the Wully Bully band.

1733
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:54,100
Sam the Sham and the Pharaohs.

1734
01:10:54,100 --> 01:10:56,340
Wully Bully from the Chipmunks movie.

1735
01:10:56,340 --> 01:10:57,540
TV and film.

1736
01:10:57,540 --> 01:11:01,220
One of the high points of rock and roll for me is that 80s Chipmunks movie.

1737
01:11:01,220 --> 01:11:05,460
The band that inspired, you got to think this band, there wouldn't have been a Chipmunks

1738
01:11:05,460 --> 01:11:06,900
without Sam the Sham.

1739
01:11:06,900 --> 01:11:08,180
Sam the Sham and the Pharaohs, yeah.

1740
01:11:09,220 --> 01:11:11,140
Did Question the Mysterios ever play there?

1741
01:11:12,180 --> 01:11:13,780
It feels like that could be a good.

1742
01:11:13,780 --> 01:11:17,700
I know the Strawberry Alarm Clock played there.

1743
01:11:17,700 --> 01:11:18,660
Monkeys played there.

1744
01:11:19,460 --> 01:11:20,820
Everly Brothers played there.

1745
01:11:21,540 --> 01:11:22,340
That's amazing.

1746
01:11:22,340 --> 01:11:22,820
Yeah.

1747
01:11:22,820 --> 01:11:27,780
Well, this also speaks to, again, I don't know who owns it now, but I think at the time,

1748
01:11:27,780 --> 01:11:33,540
genuinely, it was not like, it was a big deal that as with Oktoberfest today,

1749
01:11:33,540 --> 01:11:39,060
it was a big deal that this became a big rock and roll venue because in other parts of Utah,

1750
01:11:39,060 --> 01:11:43,380
there probably wouldn't have been like a sanctuary for rock music.

1751
01:11:43,540 --> 01:11:50,900
Also at the time, because these owners were liberal for Utah, they allowed the races to mix

1752
01:11:50,900 --> 01:11:52,500
when other parts of Utah were not.

1753
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:56,900
This was a super liberal place in the 60s in that regard.

1754
01:11:56,900 --> 01:11:58,420
So that's super cool.

1755
01:11:58,420 --> 01:12:02,740
Well, yeah, and it is funny to think because obviously bands and stuff would come play

1756
01:12:02,740 --> 01:12:06,580
in California and stuff, but it's like if I'm trying to think of what are cities between

1757
01:12:07,860 --> 01:12:11,460
Chicago or other big Midwest places if you're going on tour.

1758
01:12:11,700 --> 01:12:13,540
Salt Lake City probably was a huge hub.

1759
01:12:14,500 --> 01:12:14,980
Oh, sure.

1760
01:12:14,980 --> 01:12:16,500
It probably still is, really.

1761
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:19,540
Yeah, it probably serves a lot of the...

1762
01:12:19,540 --> 01:12:25,220
Because I feel like big tours wouldn't necessarily stop in Idaho or Wyoming.

1763
01:12:25,220 --> 01:12:26,900
Yeah, or New Mexico or something like that.

1764
01:12:26,900 --> 01:12:28,100
Yeah, right, right.

1765
01:12:29,380 --> 01:12:29,540
But...

1766
01:12:29,540 --> 01:12:30,820
Way to Vegas, you know?

1767
01:12:30,820 --> 01:12:31,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1768
01:12:34,820 --> 01:12:39,780
But also if you look at the list of who played there, back to our relevant interests,

1769
01:12:40,740 --> 01:12:44,500
the He-Man in the Power Tour played there.

1770
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:47,780
Yep, Ninja Turtles coming out of our shells played there.

1771
01:12:47,780 --> 01:12:48,260
So that's...

1772
01:12:48,260 --> 01:12:48,900
I didn't see that.

1773
01:12:48,900 --> 01:12:49,540
That's huge.

1774
01:12:49,540 --> 01:12:50,020
That's huge.

1775
01:12:50,020 --> 01:12:54,740
But also one that I saw in 1988, and this is one where I might need a little bit of listener

1776
01:12:54,740 --> 01:13:00,900
help because it just lists with no other information Ghostbusters for two nights.

1777
01:13:00,900 --> 01:13:01,700
Oh, wow.

1778
01:13:01,700 --> 01:13:02,980
Was there in...

1779
01:13:02,980 --> 01:13:06,420
And I couldn't find any other info about this, but are there any listeners who have

1780
01:13:06,420 --> 01:13:10,180
memory of seeing a Ghostbusters live tour?

1781
01:13:10,180 --> 01:13:11,940
Was there such a thing?

1782
01:13:11,940 --> 01:13:14,100
And if so, why don't we know more about it?

1783
01:13:14,100 --> 01:13:16,260
Why isn't there more information about it?

1784
01:13:16,260 --> 01:13:18,180
Did it involve rock music?

1785
01:13:18,180 --> 01:13:20,820
Did they play the Ray Parker Jr. song?

1786
01:13:21,460 --> 01:13:24,340
Were they a band in addition to being Ghostbusters?

1787
01:13:24,340 --> 01:13:26,420
Yeah, I'm sure you did a Google because I didn't see this.

1788
01:13:26,420 --> 01:13:27,700
I couldn't find anything else about it.

1789
01:13:27,700 --> 01:13:32,820
No grainy VHS footage on a big one of the backpack camera or shoulder cams?

1790
01:13:33,380 --> 01:13:36,820
With so much light streak, impossible to see.

1791
01:13:37,780 --> 01:13:42,260
Akroyd and Jim Belushi in Ghostbusters suits doing blues songs.

1792
01:13:42,260 --> 01:13:45,380
I think it's likely what it could have been.

1793
01:13:45,380 --> 01:13:45,620
Yeah.

1794
01:13:46,740 --> 01:13:49,860
Just the exact same Blues Brothers set list that they do with all the casinos.

1795
01:13:50,500 --> 01:13:52,100
But just wearing the Proton Packs.

1796
01:13:52,100 --> 01:13:53,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1797
01:13:53,060 --> 01:13:55,220
I'm a ghost man.

1798
01:13:55,220 --> 01:13:56,340
That's the only change.

1799
01:13:59,060 --> 01:14:00,820
So that's a high mark aside.

1800
01:14:00,820 --> 01:14:04,820
If anyone remembers seeing the Ghostbusters live, I really want to know what that was.

1801
01:14:04,820 --> 01:14:07,460
Because I'm sure that was if it happened, it was amazing.

1802
01:14:08,020 --> 01:14:12,180
We know about that band, Huntsman's Rock Band, but we don't know if there was.

1803
01:14:12,180 --> 01:14:13,540
Why is that so documented?

1804
01:14:14,900 --> 01:14:17,860
Like there's a new movie literally coming out in a week or whatever.

1805
01:14:17,860 --> 01:14:18,900
Not with a tour though.

1806
01:14:18,900 --> 01:14:21,380
Not with any rock music to support it.

1807
01:14:22,180 --> 01:14:24,100
And they don't even have Fallout Boy this time around.

1808
01:14:24,100 --> 01:14:25,140
Oh, man.

1809
01:14:27,620 --> 01:14:29,300
Back to attractions.

1810
01:14:29,300 --> 01:14:34,020
Is there anything that we've missed or anything that you did that you enjoyed there?

1811
01:14:34,020 --> 01:14:35,380
The sky ride was nice.

1812
01:14:35,380 --> 01:14:40,980
It's a very weird like because it feels like sky ride or like they're basically just, you know,

1813
01:14:40,980 --> 01:14:44,100
you go over the park and then go one way and go back or whatever.

1814
01:14:44,100 --> 01:14:45,700
And I've been on a few of those.

1815
01:14:45,700 --> 01:14:47,780
The San Diego Zoo has a really nice one.

1816
01:14:48,820 --> 01:14:49,540
Oh, yeah.

1817
01:14:49,540 --> 01:14:52,900
The big difference with this one is that you're kind of like just in it.

1818
01:14:52,900 --> 01:14:56,180
Like you are like you're not like touching any rides or anything,

1819
01:14:56,180 --> 01:15:00,900
but you are like basically sitting above all the buildings versus like you're not that up high.

1820
01:15:00,900 --> 01:15:01,380
Yes.

1821
01:15:01,380 --> 01:15:04,500
You're just seeing shit dropped on top of like the roofs.

1822
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:07,620
And your feet are dangling like the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk.

1823
01:15:07,620 --> 01:15:07,940
Yes.

1824
01:15:07,940 --> 01:15:08,340
Yeah.

1825
01:15:08,340 --> 01:15:08,740
Okay.

1826
01:15:08,740 --> 01:15:12,180
So you could like put something in the gutter if you want it to the ring gutter.

1827
01:15:12,180 --> 01:15:13,300
If you want to get rid of it.

1828
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:17,780
Stuff just like hats and just like, you know, souvenirs.

1829
01:15:17,780 --> 01:15:22,900
Like things are just dropped because it's like, yeah, it was very, it's very relaxing

1830
01:15:22,900 --> 01:15:25,700
and it's cool because you get to just, you get to, it's almost like,

1831
01:15:25,700 --> 01:15:29,460
if I were, if like you guys were to go there, like I would almost recommend doing that first

1832
01:15:29,460 --> 01:15:31,860
because it almost kind of give you like a little bit of a lay of the land.

1833
01:15:33,620 --> 01:15:36,420
But it is very, I'm so used to those kinds of things.

1834
01:15:36,420 --> 01:15:38,660
Like, cause what was the one at Disneyland?

1835
01:15:39,220 --> 01:15:40,260
The Skyway.

1836
01:15:40,260 --> 01:15:40,580
Yeah.

1837
01:15:40,580 --> 01:15:43,140
Like that, that like gets you like nice and high.

1838
01:15:43,140 --> 01:15:45,700
Like this, you are like at the height of the trees.

1839
01:15:45,700 --> 01:15:46,020
Right.

1840
01:15:46,020 --> 01:15:47,460
It's very low for what it is.

1841
01:15:47,460 --> 01:15:49,940
I think it's only like 30 feet or something like that.

1842
01:15:49,940 --> 01:15:51,220
Maybe at its shortest.

1843
01:15:51,220 --> 01:15:51,540
Sure.

1844
01:15:51,540 --> 01:15:52,020
Sure.

1845
01:15:52,020 --> 01:15:55,140
So it is very like, okay, well, you know, we're like,

1846
01:15:55,140 --> 01:15:57,860
I got to dodge it like a tree branch.

1847
01:15:57,860 --> 01:15:59,780
It's a little more thrilling than a normal sky ride.

1848
01:15:59,780 --> 01:16:00,420
Like a sky ride.

1849
01:16:00,420 --> 01:16:02,900
I got out, I got up here without even climbing a ladder.

1850
01:16:02,900 --> 01:16:03,060
Yeah.

1851
01:16:03,860 --> 01:16:08,900
I guess, yeah, that one, the, the gondola is now at Disney world.

1852
01:16:08,900 --> 01:16:11,220
Have you done those or those weren't there when you were there?

1853
01:16:11,220 --> 01:16:11,780
No, no.

1854
01:16:12,500 --> 01:16:14,900
When they go up to a certain level, I get scared.

1855
01:16:14,900 --> 01:16:17,540
But when they're like about 30 feet, I think I'm like, oh, this is fine.

1856
01:16:17,540 --> 01:16:17,780
Yeah.

1857
01:16:17,780 --> 01:16:18,820
It seems like I'll be better.

1858
01:16:19,940 --> 01:16:21,300
Ski lifts terrify me.

1859
01:16:21,300 --> 01:16:21,620
Yeah.

1860
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:25,780
Because it's like being a pilot, being close to not like to fall.

1861
01:16:25,780 --> 01:16:26,340
It's precarious.

1862
01:16:26,340 --> 01:16:27,140
It feels precarious.

1863
01:16:27,140 --> 01:16:27,700
Yes.

1864
01:16:27,700 --> 01:16:28,020
Yes.

1865
01:16:28,020 --> 01:16:30,020
And I have a thing with my legs dangling.

1866
01:16:30,020 --> 01:16:31,060
Oh, I don't like that either.

1867
01:16:31,060 --> 01:16:31,700
Yeah.

1868
01:16:31,700 --> 01:16:34,180
It feels like you're prone to anything.

1869
01:16:34,180 --> 01:16:35,300
It's something you get caught.

1870
01:16:35,860 --> 01:16:37,380
Another bird could fly.

1871
01:16:37,380 --> 01:16:38,740
Bird could grab your shoe.

1872
01:16:38,740 --> 01:16:39,380
Carry you off.

1873
01:16:39,380 --> 01:16:39,540
Yeah.

1874
01:16:39,540 --> 01:16:41,620
Carry you away just by the one leg.

1875
01:16:41,620 --> 01:16:47,620
Well, my question is, what are your guys' thoughts on Ferris with Ferris, Ferris wheel?

1876
01:16:47,620 --> 01:16:49,700
No, merry ground is lying flat.

1877
01:16:49,700 --> 01:16:49,940
Yeah.

1878
01:16:49,940 --> 01:16:50,900
Ferris wheels.

1879
01:16:50,900 --> 01:16:53,140
I am so terrified of Ferris wheels for some reason.

1880
01:16:53,140 --> 01:16:54,020
I still won't go on.

1881
01:16:54,020 --> 01:16:57,220
Even when I was just a California adventure, I don't want to go on that Ferris wheel.

1882
01:16:57,220 --> 01:16:59,060
We've been big on those on that one.

1883
01:16:59,460 --> 01:17:02,900
The one at California adventure, I've never done the hanging, the crazy car one where it like

1884
01:17:03,620 --> 01:17:04,820
hits the side or whatever.

1885
01:17:04,820 --> 01:17:09,460
But I remember talking about my anxiety lately and I did when Jason, Paul Scheer and I went

1886
01:17:09,460 --> 01:17:13,060
up in one of those, I had a little bit of an anxiety attack on the way up.

1887
01:17:13,940 --> 01:17:15,940
We were kind of packed in like sardines though.

1888
01:17:15,940 --> 01:17:20,340
It was the three of us on one bench and then a family of strangers.

1889
01:17:20,340 --> 01:17:20,820
Oh my God.

1890
01:17:20,820 --> 01:17:21,380
On the other.

1891
01:17:21,380 --> 01:17:21,940
Yeah.

1892
01:17:21,940 --> 01:17:25,540
And I remember just kind of like zoning out of my brain for a moment.

1893
01:17:25,540 --> 01:17:27,220
So yeah, I do have a weird, it's like heights.

1894
01:17:27,220 --> 01:17:28,180
I have a weird height.

1895
01:17:28,180 --> 01:17:31,540
It comes in and out at different times and for different reasons.

1896
01:17:31,540 --> 01:17:31,780
Yeah.

1897
01:17:31,780 --> 01:17:35,700
It's like I've done the at the Sears Willis.

1898
01:17:35,700 --> 01:17:36,980
They're changing the name again, I think.

1899
01:17:36,980 --> 01:17:37,460
Right.

1900
01:17:37,460 --> 01:17:38,180
In Chicago.

1901
01:17:38,180 --> 01:17:38,660
Yeah.

1902
01:17:38,660 --> 01:17:40,580
I've done the walk over the edge.

1903
01:17:40,580 --> 01:17:41,060
Oh yeah.

1904
01:17:41,060 --> 01:17:41,460
Oh really?

1905
01:17:41,460 --> 01:17:45,380
And it's crazy how your lizard brain is like, you're going to die.

1906
01:17:45,380 --> 01:17:48,900
And so you're like, my legs like turned to mush when I did that.

1907
01:17:48,900 --> 01:17:50,020
But it's like, oh, you're safe.

1908
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:51,540
But yeah, Ferris wheels.

1909
01:17:51,540 --> 01:17:54,420
It's like, it's a weird combo because if you are sitting and you're in clothes,

1910
01:17:54,420 --> 01:17:55,620
like that should feel safe.

1911
01:17:55,620 --> 01:17:59,460
But I wonder if it's like a clover field thing because it's always the last shot of that

1912
01:17:59,460 --> 01:18:02,020
movie is them in that thing when you see the monster come down.

1913
01:18:02,020 --> 01:18:04,340
And I wonder if there's a little bit of that in there too.

1914
01:18:04,340 --> 01:18:07,780
Like I'm about to be attacked, you know, like or the giant creature.

1915
01:18:07,780 --> 01:18:12,980
I, for me, I think it's heights and slow like being slow.

1916
01:18:12,980 --> 01:18:13,300
Yeah.

1917
01:18:13,300 --> 01:18:13,860
It's fast.

1918
01:18:13,860 --> 01:18:14,500
I don't care.

1919
01:18:14,500 --> 01:18:19,540
But if it's we're, if we're high up and it's very slow and there's any little bit of like

1920
01:18:19,540 --> 01:18:21,060
feeling like you're exposed.

1921
01:18:21,060 --> 01:18:21,380
Yeah.

1922
01:18:21,380 --> 01:18:25,940
I think you hate like a hang like you're like, we're stopping the Ferris wheel for a little bit.

1923
01:18:25,940 --> 01:18:26,180
Yeah.

1924
01:18:26,180 --> 01:18:27,380
You'd rather just keep it.

1925
01:18:27,380 --> 01:18:28,100
Keep it rolling.

1926
01:18:28,100 --> 01:18:30,100
I wish Ferris wheel was fast as hell.

1927
01:18:31,780 --> 01:18:33,620
Going nuts and I wouldn't worry about it.

1928
01:18:33,620 --> 01:18:34,100
Sure.

1929
01:18:34,100 --> 01:18:36,500
They're building a Ferris wheel in Dubai.

1930
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:41,140
That's like three times the size of the one in the UK or something insane.

1931
01:18:41,140 --> 01:18:42,020
I think it's open.

1932
01:18:42,020 --> 01:18:42,740
Oh, it is open.

1933
01:18:42,740 --> 01:18:43,460
Oh, geez.

1934
01:18:43,460 --> 01:18:46,500
Well, the thing, you know what the thing I do at the dumbest thing, one of the dumbest

1935
01:18:46,500 --> 01:18:49,460
things in Vegas they have that I do want to do because I've brought it up before is you

1936
01:18:49,700 --> 01:18:54,580
is they have the big Ferris wheel there and you can rent out one that has a bar in it.

1937
01:18:54,580 --> 01:18:55,300
Whoa.

1938
01:18:55,300 --> 01:18:57,860
And it goes up for like 45 minutes or an hour.

1939
01:18:57,860 --> 01:19:00,420
So you got a big group of people in there with like a bartender.

1940
01:19:00,420 --> 01:19:01,380
That's kind of funny.

1941
01:19:01,380 --> 01:19:02,260
Bachelor party.

1942
01:19:02,260 --> 01:19:04,500
Hey, I'm thinking about it.

1943
01:19:04,500 --> 01:19:05,140
Oh, yeah.

1944
01:19:05,140 --> 01:19:05,860
Congrats, by the way.

1945
01:19:05,860 --> 01:19:06,420
Thank you.

1946
01:19:06,420 --> 01:19:10,980
See, and that's great for me because all these things you're talking about are my ideal modes

1947
01:19:10,980 --> 01:19:11,780
of transit.

1948
01:19:11,780 --> 01:19:13,860
If I could, I would ride them every day.

1949
01:19:13,860 --> 01:19:14,340
A Ferris wheel?

1950
01:19:14,340 --> 01:19:16,340
You would ride the Ferris wheel to work?

1951
01:19:16,340 --> 01:19:20,100
I could take a Ferris wheel to an urban gondola system.

1952
01:19:20,100 --> 01:19:21,940
I would probably be the happiest.

1953
01:19:21,940 --> 01:19:22,900
I was like, I don't know where it is.

1954
01:19:22,900 --> 01:19:25,140
You like step out of it onto a platform.

1955
01:19:26,740 --> 01:19:28,660
Look, I didn't say it was realistic.

1956
01:19:28,660 --> 01:19:29,220
I'm just saying.

1957
01:19:29,220 --> 01:19:30,100
Peewees big adventure.

1958
01:19:30,100 --> 01:19:31,540
I'm the total opposite.

1959
01:19:32,580 --> 01:19:33,620
I love these things.

1960
01:19:33,620 --> 01:19:34,820
Do into a gondola.

1961
01:19:34,820 --> 01:19:35,940
Fire it into a cannon.

1962
01:19:36,580 --> 01:19:39,140
What have you seen that you can now rent train cars?

1963
01:19:40,020 --> 01:19:40,660
Like.

1964
01:19:40,660 --> 01:19:41,540
Don't tell him this.

1965
01:19:41,540 --> 01:19:43,060
He'll lose all his money.

1966
01:19:43,060 --> 01:19:46,100
Billy Jensen, true crime journalist, mentioned this because he wants to do this.

1967
01:19:46,740 --> 01:19:49,540
It's like that idea of like you rent a train car with you and your friends,

1968
01:19:49,540 --> 01:19:54,260
and there's like bunks and they have like routes to like Vegas or Louisiana

1969
01:19:54,260 --> 01:19:55,300
or whatever in Orleans.

1970
01:19:55,300 --> 01:19:57,620
And it's like you have your own private car, basically.

1971
01:19:57,620 --> 01:19:57,940
Wow.

1972
01:19:57,940 --> 01:19:59,860
You're like hitched to the back of like a thing.

1973
01:19:59,860 --> 01:20:00,980
This is his dream.

1974
01:20:00,980 --> 01:20:01,540
There is.

1975
01:20:02,100 --> 01:20:05,860
I learned about one of the Fremont Street casinos.

1976
01:20:06,580 --> 01:20:11,380
Used to be a train like the ground floor, like the train would.

1977
01:20:12,180 --> 01:20:13,460
This was a train station.

1978
01:20:13,460 --> 01:20:14,020
Whoa.

1979
01:20:14,020 --> 01:20:17,460
You would take the train into this casino and like get off.

1980
01:20:18,180 --> 01:20:21,700
And of course, that has not been the case in many decades, but it's like,

1981
01:20:21,700 --> 01:20:23,060
could you imagine?

1982
01:20:23,060 --> 01:20:26,580
So you're saying like a bachelor party, I could rent a train car.

1983
01:20:26,580 --> 01:20:27,080
Yeah.

1984
01:20:28,020 --> 01:20:32,260
Well, I don't know the high speed rail, the Los Angeles, Las Vegas high speed rail.

1985
01:20:32,260 --> 01:20:36,980
I feel like was a big, big project talked about for a long time that never really happened.

1986
01:20:36,980 --> 01:20:37,380
Oh, yeah.

1987
01:20:37,380 --> 01:20:38,100
On the ground.

1988
01:20:38,100 --> 01:20:43,620
No, but this train car, I'm saying, is dragged back behind a truck or something.

1989
01:20:43,780 --> 01:20:46,980
Maybe you like your butt, you're like behind freight train cars.

1990
01:20:46,980 --> 01:20:48,100
You're just hooked up to the back.

1991
01:20:48,100 --> 01:20:51,700
And yeah, I think, I mean, I didn't really look into it that much, but I wonder if it's

1992
01:20:51,700 --> 01:20:55,220
similar to like that TWA thing where you can do dinner on the plane and all that.

1993
01:20:55,220 --> 01:20:57,940
Like you're recreating the sixties Pan Am or whatever.

1994
01:20:57,940 --> 01:20:58,660
Interesting.

1995
01:20:58,660 --> 01:21:00,420
But you're actually moving on the train.

1996
01:21:00,420 --> 01:21:05,540
Like, I mean, it seems like post or like between the pandemic and then this now,

1997
01:21:05,540 --> 01:21:09,140
whatever it's like, we're there's actually other kinds of cool,

1998
01:21:09,140 --> 01:21:13,220
like almost theme park like experiences like they're trying to make outside of the theme parks.

1999
01:21:13,300 --> 01:21:16,580
Like I did the dinosaurs in the parking lot, Jurassic Quest.

2000
01:21:16,580 --> 01:21:17,140
Jurassic Quest.

2001
01:21:17,140 --> 01:21:17,940
Yeah, I did that.

2002
01:21:17,940 --> 01:21:19,220
And that was super fun.

2003
01:21:19,220 --> 01:21:20,980
Like that was a really good time.

2004
01:21:20,980 --> 01:21:21,860
Yeah, we were.

2005
01:21:21,860 --> 01:21:23,780
I mean, there's there's it comes in waves.

2006
01:21:23,780 --> 01:21:28,660
The theme parkification of like I was eventually we'll do a little more on the restaurants,

2007
01:21:29,220 --> 01:21:34,260
but that was obviously in vogue in the nineties, especially to like make everything feel like it

2008
01:21:34,260 --> 01:21:35,780
was some crazy theme.

2009
01:21:35,780 --> 01:21:36,100
Oh, yeah.

2010
01:21:36,100 --> 01:21:36,980
Ray Forest Cafe.

2011
01:21:36,980 --> 01:21:37,220
Yeah.

2012
01:21:37,220 --> 01:21:37,460
Yeah.

2013
01:21:37,460 --> 01:21:37,940
Yeah.

2014
01:21:37,940 --> 01:21:40,260
We plan it and all that stuff and die.

2015
01:21:40,260 --> 01:21:41,060
We'll do it.

2016
01:21:41,060 --> 01:21:41,860
Dive.

2017
01:21:41,860 --> 01:21:42,900
Steven Spielberg's die.

2018
01:21:42,900 --> 01:21:44,420
Why do you sound so annoyed?

2019
01:21:44,420 --> 01:21:44,980
No, I'm not.

2020
01:21:44,980 --> 01:21:47,780
I'm just saying I know I'm exasperated with us for doing to die.

2021
01:21:47,780 --> 01:21:49,220
No, no, no.

2022
01:21:49,220 --> 01:21:50,900
Long waited far too long.

2023
01:21:50,900 --> 01:21:54,420
But I'm saying, yeah, like then I feel like, yeah, it is coming like stuff in malls.

2024
01:21:54,420 --> 01:21:59,700
Obviously, the void is gone now, although rumors that maybe the void will sell or try to come back.

2025
01:21:59,700 --> 01:22:00,500
I just heard that.

2026
01:22:01,380 --> 01:22:03,700
But like, yeah, having a little guy is meta.

2027
01:22:05,060 --> 01:22:07,620
Meta is where we're all going to be living.

2028
01:22:08,420 --> 01:22:09,860
We're going to want to go.

2029
01:22:09,860 --> 01:22:14,660
We're going to want to go to theme parks to take a break from meta because we're going to be in meta

2030
01:22:14,660 --> 01:22:16,260
for 22 hours a day.

2031
01:22:16,260 --> 01:22:21,300
Going to be meeting all our robot friends and watching koi fish fly through the sky.

2032
01:22:21,300 --> 01:22:22,820
The robot friends is good.

2033
01:22:25,300 --> 01:22:26,980
This is the VR future that we use.

2034
01:22:26,980 --> 01:22:27,780
Something like that.

2035
01:22:27,780 --> 01:22:28,820
Mike loves meta.

2036
01:22:28,820 --> 01:22:29,700
Finally.

2037
01:22:29,700 --> 01:22:30,020
Oh, yeah.

2038
01:22:30,740 --> 01:22:31,860
We're second life.

2039
01:22:31,860 --> 01:22:32,420
Awesome.

2040
01:22:32,420 --> 01:22:35,220
I'm into meta now is what I'll say on the podcast.

2041
01:22:36,980 --> 01:22:38,740
We started doing it in person and it was fun.

2042
01:22:38,740 --> 01:22:43,220
Like we're probably recording in person again and now Mike insists on doing it through meta.

2043
01:22:43,220 --> 01:22:43,860
Yeah.

2044
01:22:43,860 --> 01:22:51,860
Where he can see us as giant lizards and abstract wind creatures that I'm just Kirby like in my fear.

2045
01:22:51,860 --> 01:22:54,740
That's why my space sounds nice.

2046
01:22:54,740 --> 01:22:56,180
Yeah, that's fun.

2047
01:22:57,380 --> 01:23:05,940
That reminds me of a former podcast guest, Van Robichow, who created a VR scenario where he could

2048
01:23:05,940 --> 01:23:07,860
write in VR on a beach.

2049
01:23:08,740 --> 01:23:14,500
Like the Terminator surgeon performing surgery.

2050
01:23:14,500 --> 01:23:19,780
He had created a thing where he put the helmet on and then he was on a beach at a computer.

2051
01:23:20,500 --> 01:23:23,380
But he could just go to the beach with a computer.

2052
01:23:23,380 --> 01:23:24,100
I'm just this.

2053
01:23:27,780 --> 01:23:29,140
Parking is impossible.

2054
01:23:29,140 --> 01:23:30,980
Parking is impossible.

2055
01:23:30,980 --> 01:23:32,740
I rarely do it.

2056
01:23:32,740 --> 01:23:34,420
It's another universe over there.

2057
01:23:34,660 --> 01:23:39,380
Somebody who uses their Oculus only for pottery for the pottery game that they have.

2058
01:23:39,380 --> 01:23:40,580
I kind of get it.

2059
01:23:40,580 --> 01:23:40,900
Sure.

2060
01:23:40,900 --> 01:23:41,780
But way less.

2061
01:23:41,780 --> 01:23:43,460
But see, but that's way less messy.

2062
01:23:43,460 --> 01:23:45,060
Like I'm not doing a real pottery setup.

2063
01:23:45,060 --> 01:23:46,420
That's hundreds of dollars.

2064
01:23:46,420 --> 01:23:46,660
Right.

2065
01:23:46,660 --> 01:23:47,380
Oh, that's true.

2066
01:23:47,380 --> 01:23:47,700
You're right.

2067
01:23:47,700 --> 01:23:49,220
And the cleanup on that is insane.

2068
01:23:49,220 --> 01:23:49,860
Yeah.

2069
01:23:49,860 --> 01:23:50,020
Right.

2070
01:23:50,020 --> 01:23:51,700
That makes all the sense.

2071
01:23:51,700 --> 01:23:53,220
So we'll all be in meta.

2072
01:23:53,220 --> 01:23:59,140
We'll all be doing our own work via computer VR laptops.

2073
01:23:59,140 --> 01:24:03,140
Oh, look, Mike's starting an episode over in the space room.

2074
01:24:03,140 --> 01:24:04,020
Birkin over there.

2075
01:24:04,020 --> 01:24:05,620
I just got picked up to where.

2076
01:24:06,740 --> 01:24:06,900
Yeah.

2077
01:24:07,620 --> 01:24:09,380
But he's surrounded by all his robot friends.

2078
01:24:10,260 --> 01:24:12,820
He's friends with 100 robots in meta.

2079
01:24:12,820 --> 01:24:13,140
Yes.

2080
01:24:14,100 --> 01:24:14,900
That would be awesome.

2081
01:24:15,540 --> 01:24:18,580
If I'm like the king of meta and all the robots want to be my friends.

2082
01:24:18,580 --> 01:24:19,700
You create your own.

2083
01:24:19,700 --> 01:24:22,820
Isn't that like Ready Player One where it's like you create kind of your own like

2084
01:24:23,460 --> 01:24:26,820
life timeline thing where it's like reliving.

2085
01:24:27,460 --> 01:24:29,700
Parcival from Ready Player One, right?

2086
01:24:29,700 --> 01:24:30,260
That's his name.

2087
01:24:31,300 --> 01:24:32,180
I don't remember.

2088
01:24:32,180 --> 01:24:33,380
But he has another name.

2089
01:24:33,380 --> 01:24:35,780
We all know and love and remember.

2090
01:24:35,780 --> 01:24:36,260
I saw.

2091
01:24:37,140 --> 01:24:43,060
Mike, look, you've made so many robot friends in here and I, your robot father figure,

2092
01:24:43,620 --> 01:24:45,380
am so proud of you.

2093
01:24:45,380 --> 01:24:47,380
I've never been more proud of you.

2094
01:24:47,380 --> 01:24:50,660
Hey, man, thanks so much, but I don't think I can hang out with you as much.

2095
01:24:50,660 --> 01:24:52,180
I have a lot of other friends now.

2096
01:24:52,180 --> 01:24:55,780
So I don't need your I don't need your shit anymore, man.

2097
01:24:55,780 --> 01:24:57,540
I don't need you to tell me I'm good.

2098
01:24:57,540 --> 01:24:58,900
I know I'm good.

2099
01:24:58,900 --> 01:25:03,540
But I you used to love when I thanked you for your bravery.

2100
01:25:03,540 --> 01:25:05,300
Yeah, that was a few years ago.

2101
01:25:05,300 --> 01:25:06,580
I'm cooler now.

2102
01:25:06,580 --> 01:25:07,300
Are you sure?

2103
01:25:07,300 --> 01:25:07,860
Do you don't?

2104
01:25:08,580 --> 01:25:14,580
Do you want to like go toss the all spark around in Twilight Zone?

2105
01:25:14,580 --> 01:25:17,380
Twenty twenty two is the best episode.

2106
01:25:19,300 --> 01:25:20,020
It's going to happen.

2107
01:25:20,580 --> 01:25:21,940
Some version of it's going to happen.

2108
01:25:22,900 --> 01:25:27,140
Let's talk the filming location.

2109
01:25:27,220 --> 01:25:27,620
Great.

2110
01:25:27,620 --> 01:25:29,220
I was kind of saying the same thing.

2111
01:25:29,220 --> 01:25:32,740
We can't let the episode end without talking about the fine works of art that have been

2112
01:25:32,740 --> 01:25:34,340
filmed in Lagoon.

2113
01:25:35,380 --> 01:25:38,100
I mean, call out any that you're excited about.

2114
01:25:38,100 --> 01:25:40,500
There's one that's regrettably not on the Wikipedia.

2115
01:25:40,500 --> 01:25:41,620
No, it is on the Wikipedia.

2116
01:25:41,620 --> 01:25:46,900
I just there wasn't enough context for it, I think, to build up what this great film was.

2117
01:25:48,340 --> 01:25:49,860
I mean, I like the first one.

2118
01:25:50,740 --> 01:25:53,540
Mirror mirror your you and yourself image.

2119
01:25:53,620 --> 01:25:59,300
A 1969 film by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints and Brigham Young University.

2120
01:25:59,300 --> 01:26:04,260
That's available on YouTube if you want to watch a creepy eight millimeter film where

2121
01:26:04,260 --> 01:26:07,140
a guy's mirror tries to empower him.

2122
01:26:10,180 --> 01:26:16,420
A young white guy in Utah who really needs building up self-esteem in the 60s.

2123
01:26:16,420 --> 01:26:16,920
Sure.

2124
01:26:17,940 --> 01:26:18,440
Very tough.

2125
01:26:19,300 --> 01:26:21,860
What did you respond to as a?

2126
01:26:21,860 --> 01:26:25,540
Well, I this really meant nothing to me, but Jane got very excited.

2127
01:26:25,540 --> 01:26:32,580
And this this I think is one of our our gaps in our knowledge is that she grew up watching

2128
01:26:32,580 --> 01:26:34,740
the DECOM, the Disney Channel Original movie.

2129
01:26:34,740 --> 01:26:38,580
So when I said, do you know what the Irish is?

2130
01:26:38,580 --> 01:26:39,780
DECOM is the term.

2131
01:26:39,780 --> 01:26:40,500
Oh, really?

2132
01:26:40,500 --> 01:26:41,220
Use DECOM.

2133
01:26:41,220 --> 01:26:41,700
DECOM.

2134
01:26:41,700 --> 01:26:42,020
Yeah.

2135
01:26:42,020 --> 01:26:42,820
Does she say it?

2136
01:26:42,820 --> 01:26:43,780
It's a DECOM, Jason.

2137
01:26:43,780 --> 01:26:44,820
She has said it.

2138
01:26:44,820 --> 01:26:50,340
Yeah, she I don't know if I heard it from her first or inside the Disney vault first

2139
01:26:50,900 --> 01:26:51,380
pocket.

2140
01:26:53,140 --> 01:26:55,700
But yeah, the luck of the Irish film scenes there.

2141
01:26:56,740 --> 01:27:00,340
Which is yeah, that movie is literally a kid turns into a leprechaun.

2142
01:27:01,140 --> 01:27:01,640
Yeah.

2143
01:27:02,260 --> 01:27:03,220
And plays basketball.

2144
01:27:04,180 --> 01:27:05,780
I have seen this, but it's been a minute.

2145
01:27:05,780 --> 01:27:08,020
He in the scene they film at Lagoon.

2146
01:27:08,020 --> 01:27:13,780
He there's Irish step dancing happening as it does around most places that you live.

2147
01:27:13,780 --> 01:27:15,780
And he can't help him.

2148
01:27:15,780 --> 01:27:18,100
So he just like his legs take over.

2149
01:27:18,100 --> 01:27:21,540
It's just like like turning into a werewolf.

2150
01:27:21,540 --> 01:27:23,460
What is happening to me?

2151
01:27:23,460 --> 01:27:25,220
And he starts stepping and clogging.

2152
01:27:25,220 --> 01:27:25,700
Oh, my God.

2153
01:27:25,700 --> 01:27:26,500
And he's just up there.

2154
01:27:26,500 --> 01:27:27,620
What was Lord of the Dance?

2155
01:27:28,820 --> 01:27:30,020
Wait, this movie feels late.

2156
01:27:30,020 --> 01:27:31,060
It was like 2001.

2157
01:27:31,060 --> 01:27:32,340
That was before that.

2158
01:27:32,340 --> 01:27:32,820
Yeah.

2159
01:27:32,820 --> 01:27:34,180
What are this mid 90s?

2160
01:27:34,180 --> 01:27:35,300
Well, we talked about this.

2161
01:27:35,300 --> 01:27:38,900
Michael Flatley was inspired this bad Disney parade.

2162
01:27:38,900 --> 01:27:40,420
He was in Riverdale.

2163
01:27:40,420 --> 01:27:40,900
Yes.

2164
01:27:40,900 --> 01:27:41,460
To begin with.

2165
01:27:41,460 --> 01:27:45,780
And then he created Lord of the Dance after like the mid 90s.

2166
01:27:46,180 --> 01:27:51,460
And then they got their they got off their asses and made a decom five years after all

2167
01:27:51,460 --> 01:27:52,660
this hit its peak.

2168
01:27:52,660 --> 01:27:52,900
Right.

2169
01:27:52,900 --> 01:27:53,140
Sure.

2170
01:27:54,660 --> 01:27:56,340
Probably the most unpleasant thing.

2171
01:27:57,300 --> 01:28:03,300
Various scenes for the movie Weeners starring Kenan Thompson, Jenny McCarthy and Darrell Hammond.

2172
01:28:03,300 --> 01:28:05,700
Well, you say most unpleasant.

2173
01:28:05,700 --> 01:28:08,660
That's the one I was the most excited about was Weeners.

2174
01:28:08,660 --> 01:28:11,700
It is one of the most unpleasant posters I've ever seen.

2175
01:28:11,700 --> 01:28:12,580
Oh, no way.

2176
01:28:12,580 --> 01:28:14,180
You're the package of hot dogs.

2177
01:28:15,060 --> 01:28:15,300
Yeah.

2178
01:28:15,300 --> 01:28:16,260
And you don't like it.

2179
01:28:16,260 --> 01:28:17,860
The movie is called Weeners.

2180
01:28:17,860 --> 01:28:22,100
I mean, my favorite thing.

2181
01:28:22,100 --> 01:28:23,620
Like, I don't know, man.

2182
01:28:23,620 --> 01:28:27,140
Oh, you're like if they're going to make a movie about Weeners, they got to do it right.

2183
01:28:27,140 --> 01:28:29,780
Show some respect to the Oscar Meyer packaging.

2184
01:28:30,900 --> 01:28:36,580
Look, does it not change the equation that it went straight to DVD where it was referred

2185
01:28:36,580 --> 01:28:39,300
to as the 100% pure beef edition?

2186
01:28:39,780 --> 01:28:40,820
Oh, God.

2187
01:28:40,820 --> 01:28:46,020
I miss those days of DVDs getting the jokey special edition titles.

2188
01:28:46,020 --> 01:28:49,140
Totally not rated, totally blurfed up.

2189
01:28:49,140 --> 01:28:53,060
And then it's like hashtag at sign exclamation point.

2190
01:28:53,060 --> 01:28:54,420
I just realized the plot.

2191
01:28:54,420 --> 01:28:57,540
There's only there's three, no, four or five paragraphs.

2192
01:28:57,540 --> 01:29:01,460
The second paragraph starts on the way they encounter an elderly nymphomaniac couple,

2193
01:29:01,460 --> 01:29:06,340
Frank and Felicia Applebaum, Blake, Clark and Mindy Sterling, who have sexual intercourse

2194
01:29:06,340 --> 01:29:07,220
in front of them.

2195
01:29:07,220 --> 01:29:08,580
That's the second plot paragraph.

2196
01:29:08,580 --> 01:29:09,300
Slinky Dog.

2197
01:29:09,300 --> 01:29:11,380
Slinky Dog number two, Blake Clark.

2198
01:29:11,380 --> 01:29:12,180
Oh, yeah.

2199
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:13,620
He's a great cast.

2200
01:29:13,620 --> 01:29:18,500
And the king of theme park media, Chris Pratt.

2201
01:29:18,500 --> 01:29:23,780
This is an early Chris Pratt performance where he's on the show that Darryl Hammond hosts,

2202
01:29:23,780 --> 01:29:29,380
the Dr. Dwayne show, where he does not they don't have the money to give him a bald cap,

2203
01:29:29,380 --> 01:29:34,820
but he does do like, you need to get out of your toxic relationship.

2204
01:29:35,060 --> 01:29:38,740
I think I know who Dr. Dwayne is supposed to be.

2205
01:29:38,740 --> 01:29:40,420
I guess we're all watching Wieners.

2206
01:29:40,420 --> 01:29:40,980
Yeah, I know.

2207
01:29:40,980 --> 01:29:43,380
Yeah, I turn everybody around.

2208
01:29:43,380 --> 01:29:45,380
He's got genuine movie stars.

2209
01:29:45,380 --> 01:29:45,620
Wow.

2210
01:29:45,620 --> 01:29:48,180
Wait, is this on, can we watch this on Disney Plus?

2211
01:29:48,180 --> 01:29:50,260
Like, is this or is this like a Peacock?

2212
01:29:50,260 --> 01:29:53,620
I think you have to buy the physical 100% pure beef edition.

2213
01:29:54,500 --> 01:29:57,380
That's the only they were the creators are very specific.

2214
01:29:57,380 --> 01:29:58,740
It's meant for DVD.

2215
01:29:58,740 --> 01:30:02,340
We will we forego the theatrical run.

2216
01:30:02,340 --> 01:30:02,500
Yeah.

2217
01:30:02,500 --> 01:30:03,860
We refuse it.

2218
01:30:03,860 --> 01:30:04,900
We're not taking one.

2219
01:30:04,900 --> 01:30:06,500
You need to buy this at a Walmart.

2220
01:30:07,940 --> 01:30:12,020
For like $29 purchase at a Walmart.

2221
01:30:12,020 --> 01:30:13,540
All right, two of us are going to Walmart.

2222
01:30:13,540 --> 01:30:15,220
Two of us are going to Amoeba Records.

2223
01:30:15,220 --> 01:30:15,540
Yeah.

2224
01:30:15,540 --> 01:30:17,860
Surely find one somewhere between the two.

2225
01:30:18,420 --> 01:30:18,980
I will.

2226
01:30:18,980 --> 01:30:20,100
I'm sure we can get you.

2227
01:30:20,740 --> 01:30:24,980
I will one day get you like 50 copies of Wieners as a gift.

2228
01:30:25,700 --> 01:30:27,460
They're in a warehouse somewhere.

2229
01:30:27,460 --> 01:30:27,700
Yeah.

2230
01:30:27,700 --> 01:30:30,020
This this loose stock, you know, it has to be.

2231
01:30:30,020 --> 01:30:30,500
I will see.

2232
01:30:30,500 --> 01:30:32,820
I'll look up the well, let me look up the resale now.

2233
01:30:32,900 --> 01:30:36,260
100 times 50 equals like what?

2234
01:30:36,260 --> 01:30:40,420
That's like 5000% pure beef.

2235
01:30:41,300 --> 01:30:46,420
You could never be so much pure beef in one place outside of hot dog factory.

2236
01:30:46,420 --> 01:30:47,300
It would be impossible.

2237
01:30:49,140 --> 01:30:56,100
An episode of Andy Mack, Pass Gasly Lampudan, of course, one of the stars that show that

2238
01:30:56,740 --> 01:31:00,260
shot at Lagoon, a lot of Disney series.

2239
01:31:00,260 --> 01:31:01,780
Disney shoots in Utah a lot.

2240
01:31:01,780 --> 01:31:04,260
The High School Musical show shoots there, too.

2241
01:31:04,260 --> 01:31:08,980
If you make a tax break movie or show, then you're going to end up at Lagoon.

2242
01:31:08,980 --> 01:31:09,140
Yeah.

2243
01:31:09,140 --> 01:31:10,180
So that's what in my head.

2244
01:31:10,180 --> 01:31:11,860
I got it mixed up when I went there.

2245
01:31:11,860 --> 01:31:16,100
I thought they had shot High School Musical there at the theme park, but I guess they

2246
01:31:16,100 --> 01:31:17,380
just shoot in Utah.

2247
01:31:17,380 --> 01:31:17,860
Yeah.

2248
01:31:17,860 --> 01:31:18,740
Oh, gotcha.

2249
01:31:18,740 --> 01:31:19,140
Yeah.

2250
01:31:19,140 --> 01:31:24,340
I was like, oh, no, there's nothing here that looks not that I'm, you know,

2251
01:31:25,140 --> 01:31:27,940
not that I've like watched them religiously, but I did not.

2252
01:31:27,940 --> 01:31:31,700
I did not recognize any, you know, it's easy to go to a place.

2253
01:31:31,700 --> 01:31:33,620
You're like, oh, I want to see where they film the thing.

2254
01:31:34,500 --> 01:31:39,060
Not that thing, but like even like the last time I was in Hawaii was like, oh, cool.

2255
01:31:39,060 --> 01:31:40,740
This is where they shot this part of Jurassic Park.

2256
01:31:40,740 --> 01:31:42,420
But it's like, you can't really tell.

2257
01:31:42,420 --> 01:31:44,420
It's always kind of a let down a little bit, I find.

2258
01:31:44,420 --> 01:31:44,900
Oh, yeah.

2259
01:31:44,900 --> 01:31:45,300
Yeah.

2260
01:31:45,300 --> 01:31:45,460
Yeah.

2261
01:31:45,460 --> 01:31:47,780
Those are just a little like amorphous.

2262
01:31:47,780 --> 01:31:51,860
I got someone's on a boat tour and I got to see where the they said this is where the

2263
01:31:51,860 --> 01:31:53,620
helipad was, like where they arrived.

2264
01:31:53,620 --> 01:31:54,500
Yeah, I did that.

2265
01:31:54,500 --> 01:31:54,820
Yeah.

2266
01:31:54,820 --> 01:31:55,060
Yeah.

2267
01:31:55,700 --> 01:31:57,220
You can sort of tell, but you're also like, I don't know.

2268
01:31:57,220 --> 01:32:00,260
They could tell me any of these are the one without the platform.

2269
01:32:00,260 --> 01:32:01,060
You can't really.

2270
01:32:01,060 --> 01:32:04,900
Yeah, I was like, like because Laura Lapkus was in a scene and I was like, were you there?

2271
01:32:04,900 --> 01:32:07,700
And I think she literally went to Hawaii just for that one.

2272
01:32:08,500 --> 01:32:09,060
Heart.

2273
01:32:09,060 --> 01:32:09,620
Wow.

2274
01:32:09,620 --> 01:32:15,060
With with Miss Ronnie, with that character, with air friend con, like they literally,

2275
01:32:15,060 --> 01:32:18,660
she just flew to Hawaii just to shoot that helipad sequence because the rest of the stuff was in

2276
01:32:18,660 --> 01:32:19,700
Louisiana.

2277
01:32:19,700 --> 01:32:20,660
Wow, that's crazy.

2278
01:32:20,660 --> 01:32:22,020
Oh, that's so sweet.

2279
01:32:22,020 --> 01:32:24,260
I can't find a wieners DVD on eBay.

2280
01:32:24,260 --> 01:32:25,060
Oh, what?

2281
01:32:25,060 --> 01:32:26,260
This is this is really rare.

2282
01:32:26,260 --> 01:32:27,780
Wieners is not available.

2283
01:32:27,780 --> 01:32:28,820
It's not available.

2284
01:32:28,820 --> 01:32:30,500
There's a listing for it on Walmart.

2285
01:32:30,500 --> 01:32:32,500
But I can't find it.

2286
01:32:32,500 --> 01:32:34,340
I feel like it did see ads for it.

2287
01:32:34,340 --> 01:32:34,980
Oh, wait, wait.

2288
01:32:34,980 --> 01:32:36,180
No, I found it on eBay.

2289
01:32:36,180 --> 01:32:36,820
OK.

2290
01:32:36,820 --> 01:32:37,140
OK.

2291
01:32:37,700 --> 01:32:38,900
Nine thousand dollars.

2292
01:32:38,900 --> 01:32:41,620
Quick, quick souvenir smack down.

2293
01:32:41,620 --> 01:32:42,180
OK.

2294
01:32:42,180 --> 01:32:43,700
How much without shipping?

2295
01:32:43,700 --> 01:32:46,100
I'll say this shipping would be 319.

2296
01:32:46,100 --> 01:32:51,940
How much do you think wieners DVD is going for 2008 wieners 2008?

2297
01:32:52,580 --> 01:32:53,540
Hmm.

2298
01:32:53,540 --> 01:32:56,500
Let's Stephen finish it so maybe he can take the do the over under.

2299
01:32:56,500 --> 01:32:56,900
Yeah.

2300
01:32:56,980 --> 01:33:01,140
I'll just I'll say like thirty five dollars.

2301
01:33:01,140 --> 01:33:01,860
Three dollars.

2302
01:33:01,860 --> 01:33:02,580
Jason.

2303
01:33:02,580 --> 01:33:03,460
Eighteen dollars.

2304
01:33:03,460 --> 01:33:04,020
Eighteen dollars.

2305
01:33:04,020 --> 01:33:04,420
Stephen.

2306
01:33:05,620 --> 01:33:07,380
I'm going to go 1099.

2307
01:33:09,300 --> 01:33:11,380
Well, if it's price of right rules, everyone loses.

2308
01:33:11,380 --> 01:33:11,700
Yeah.

2309
01:33:11,700 --> 01:33:11,940
OK.

2310
01:33:11,940 --> 01:33:12,740
A dollar thirty.

2311
01:33:16,580 --> 01:33:21,300
If we had made these guesses before we talked about it, we would have said, I don't know.

2312
01:33:21,300 --> 01:33:21,540
Right.

2313
01:33:22,180 --> 01:33:23,300
42 cents.

2314
01:33:23,300 --> 01:33:23,860
Yeah.

2315
01:33:23,860 --> 01:33:24,100
Yeah.

2316
01:33:24,100 --> 01:33:25,940
Legend of wieners got too big.

2317
01:33:25,940 --> 01:33:26,900
Buy wieners for a dollar.

2318
01:33:26,900 --> 01:33:28,820
Wait, is it is it mint and packaged?

2319
01:33:28,820 --> 01:33:29,300
Do you know?

2320
01:33:29,300 --> 01:33:29,780
Let me see.

2321
01:33:29,780 --> 01:33:30,740
Let me see what it says.

2322
01:33:30,740 --> 01:33:34,020
That is less than the cost of a package of wieners.

2323
01:33:34,020 --> 01:33:34,980
It just it.

2324
01:33:34,980 --> 01:33:36,180
You only got.

2325
01:33:36,180 --> 01:33:37,780
It just says condition is good.

2326
01:33:37,780 --> 01:33:38,420
Oh.

2327
01:33:38,420 --> 01:33:40,500
So it's not like there's no seal on it.

2328
01:33:40,500 --> 01:33:41,380
Condition is good.

2329
01:33:41,380 --> 01:33:42,260
Film is great.

2330
01:33:46,580 --> 01:33:47,220
Oh, man.

2331
01:33:48,740 --> 01:33:53,540
Well, I mean, incredible lineup of stuff, not to mention the show Werewolf,

2332
01:33:53,540 --> 01:33:57,220
which is apparently one of the first Fox shows when Fox was new.

2333
01:33:57,860 --> 01:33:59,220
I never a werewolf.

2334
01:33:59,220 --> 01:34:01,940
And why didn't werewolf go beyond season one?

2335
01:34:02,500 --> 01:34:03,700
We got to look into that.

2336
01:34:03,700 --> 01:34:04,020
Yeah.

2337
01:34:04,020 --> 01:34:04,900
Amazing stuff.

2338
01:34:04,900 --> 01:34:07,140
That Dark Angel I need to rewatch.

2339
01:34:08,740 --> 01:34:10,500
This is all right with the werewolf cast.

2340
01:34:10,500 --> 01:34:12,740
We're revisiting every episode of Werewolf.

2341
01:34:14,180 --> 01:34:16,260
Then no zero listeners.

2342
01:34:16,260 --> 01:34:17,940
At a certain point that will happen.

2343
01:34:18,820 --> 01:34:22,340
Here was something tangentially related.

2344
01:34:22,340 --> 01:34:23,860
Nolan Bushnell.

2345
01:34:23,860 --> 01:34:24,900
Oh, yeah.

2346
01:34:24,900 --> 01:34:29,460
Worked at the Carnival Games while he was getting his electrical engineering degree

2347
01:34:29,460 --> 01:34:31,460
at the University of Utah.

2348
01:34:32,100 --> 01:34:36,580
That's like his Walt Ice or Tony Baxter ice cream scooper thing.

2349
01:34:36,580 --> 01:34:39,380
Like where his formative years were at Lagoon.

2350
01:34:39,380 --> 01:34:39,540
Yeah.

2351
01:34:40,260 --> 01:34:41,300
For like that.

2352
01:34:41,300 --> 01:34:44,100
Like whenever you learn that somebody because isn't that the thing with the

2353
01:34:44,100 --> 01:34:49,140
studio tour at Universal that like a lot of people gave that tour and then would go on

2354
01:34:49,140 --> 01:34:51,140
to be famous or famous podcast?

2355
01:34:51,140 --> 01:34:56,500
Yeah, like maybe one of the top podcasters on this show.

2356
01:34:57,860 --> 01:34:58,980
Certainly in the top three.

2357
01:34:58,980 --> 01:35:01,860
The top three hosts of podcast thread.

2358
01:35:03,300 --> 01:35:04,340
That is like a few.

2359
01:35:05,140 --> 01:35:07,860
It's not that good of a Paul Feig's big one.

2360
01:35:07,860 --> 01:35:08,100
Nice.

2361
01:35:09,140 --> 01:35:14,740
And there's like an actor named Jack Wagner who people don't really he made a song called

2362
01:35:14,740 --> 01:35:16,980
All I Need that's like a soft rock classic.

2363
01:35:17,460 --> 01:35:18,100
That's that.

2364
01:35:18,100 --> 01:35:18,420
Nice.

2365
01:35:18,420 --> 01:35:19,220
So if you like.

2366
01:35:19,220 --> 01:35:19,700
Those three.

2367
01:35:19,700 --> 01:35:20,420
Those are three.

2368
01:35:20,420 --> 01:35:20,820
That's it.

2369
01:35:21,380 --> 01:35:22,500
Jack Wagner Scott Garner.

2370
01:35:23,140 --> 01:35:28,180
I mean, I think I mean, working at a theme park is like such a because your whatever job you have,

2371
01:35:28,180 --> 01:35:32,740
I think at least like with food, it's like you're working at like a restaurant or cafeteria,

2372
01:35:32,740 --> 01:35:36,340
but then you're also dealing with the added like in my head, it was always like,

2373
01:35:36,340 --> 01:35:40,020
well, everybody's been waiting in lines all day and now we're hungry and we just want to eat.

2374
01:35:40,020 --> 01:35:43,220
So I feel like everyone's a little more tense like going to places.

2375
01:35:44,340 --> 01:35:47,140
But I feel like at the sit down restaurants, it was probably more relaxing.

2376
01:35:47,140 --> 01:35:50,260
I imagine that the blue bayou is probably like nice to actually sit down.

2377
01:35:51,140 --> 01:35:54,740
But like because pizza port, it's another line you have to get into to get food.

2378
01:35:55,380 --> 01:35:58,020
Yeah, so it's stressful in there.

2379
01:35:58,020 --> 01:35:59,700
That's so that's those are that's points.

2380
01:35:59,700 --> 01:36:01,780
Maybe the patio is OK with the pad.

2381
01:36:01,780 --> 01:36:03,780
Like, did you feel that stress?

2382
01:36:03,780 --> 01:36:08,980
Yeah, I enjoyed being it felt like when you're cleaning outside, it was like you were like

2383
01:36:08,980 --> 01:36:09,620
independent.

2384
01:36:09,620 --> 01:36:12,180
You were like, we're in your own thoughts like you were walking around sweeping.

2385
01:36:12,180 --> 01:36:16,260
I'd watch the bands, you know, like, of course, you would see like the same thing every time.

2386
01:36:16,260 --> 01:36:17,620
So I was like getting sick of it.

2387
01:36:17,700 --> 01:36:20,420
But like I always I enjoyed that.

2388
01:36:20,420 --> 01:36:25,300
And then I enjoyed making the salads more because you just got a big bowl and you just got to like,

2389
01:36:25,300 --> 01:36:29,540
you know, you had to make like a hundred pound salad or what and then disperse amongst people.

2390
01:36:30,900 --> 01:36:36,020
The pizza was always the again, as I mentioned earlier, because it's like you just have to throw

2391
01:36:36,020 --> 01:36:37,300
away so much pizza.

2392
01:36:37,300 --> 01:36:37,700
Yeah.

2393
01:36:37,700 --> 01:36:38,180
Yeah.

2394
01:36:38,180 --> 01:36:38,980
What's it?

2395
01:36:38,980 --> 01:36:41,860
Do you know anything about what's going into that pizza?

2396
01:36:41,860 --> 01:36:44,260
Because I find the pizza a tad suspect.

2397
01:36:44,420 --> 01:36:49,540
I always feel like to me, I think I mean, I'm not like a pizza expert or anything, but I feel like

2398
01:36:49,540 --> 01:36:53,060
it's basically not as good version of Costco pizza.

2399
01:36:53,060 --> 01:36:54,260
That's my assessment.

2400
01:36:54,260 --> 01:36:58,660
But I haven't had the I haven't had the pizza or pizza in like, yeah, 15 years.

2401
01:36:58,660 --> 01:37:02,740
But at the time they said it was the most popular restaurant at Disneyland.

2402
01:37:02,740 --> 01:37:04,580
Yeah, I don't know if that's changed at all.

2403
01:37:04,580 --> 01:37:06,020
But yeah, it's a good question.

2404
01:37:06,020 --> 01:37:09,220
I mean, I was just there a couple of days ago and there was a little big line.

2405
01:37:09,220 --> 01:37:11,780
It's now Alien Pizza Port Pizza Planet.

2406
01:37:11,780 --> 01:37:12,420
Excuse me.

2407
01:37:12,420 --> 01:37:12,900
Pizza Planet.

2408
01:37:12,900 --> 01:37:13,380
Excuse me.

2409
01:37:14,260 --> 01:37:18,100
They've changed the name of it, but it is, I think, the same pizza.

2410
01:37:18,100 --> 01:37:18,980
Yeah, probably.

2411
01:37:20,020 --> 01:37:22,020
Increasingly more expensive.

2412
01:37:22,020 --> 01:37:24,180
Yeah, it's $15 more per slice.

2413
01:37:24,820 --> 01:37:26,660
But yeah, it seems like it's still very popular.

2414
01:37:27,620 --> 01:37:28,100
So yeah.

2415
01:37:29,060 --> 01:37:31,700
This is maybe this is a good thing to start hitting out on.

2416
01:37:32,420 --> 01:37:36,500
There was let's talk about a lagoon snack, something that they this is apparently,

2417
01:37:37,140 --> 01:37:41,780
as opposed to Dippin' Dots, this is very rare in America, maybe very popular in Canada.

2418
01:37:41,780 --> 01:37:45,700
But I believe is the first American location of something called Beaver Tales.

2419
01:37:45,700 --> 01:37:46,580
Beaver Tales.

2420
01:37:46,580 --> 01:37:48,980
Anyone had Beaver Tales or know about it before?

2421
01:37:48,980 --> 01:37:54,740
I know that it used to be served or briefly was served at the Canada Pavilion in Epcot.

2422
01:37:54,740 --> 01:37:56,340
Oh, that makes sense.

2423
01:37:56,340 --> 01:37:56,980
OK, OK.

2424
01:37:58,100 --> 01:37:59,060
I have to picture this.

2425
01:37:59,860 --> 01:38:00,340
Maybe I did.

2426
01:38:01,220 --> 01:38:04,100
So it's the it is like kind of this wider.

2427
01:38:04,100 --> 01:38:08,580
It's like a pizza crust, but, you know, like mixed with.

2428
01:38:09,620 --> 01:38:10,980
I mean, Beaver Tales a great way.

2429
01:38:10,980 --> 01:38:12,580
It's like that width and length.

2430
01:38:12,580 --> 01:38:17,540
And then it's I mean, the stuff they top it with is fan tiers, one with a bunch of Reese's Pieces.

2431
01:38:17,540 --> 01:38:22,020
There's an avalanche with cheesecake spread score bits.

2432
01:38:22,020 --> 01:38:23,060
What score?

2433
01:38:23,060 --> 01:38:24,020
Jason Jason.

2434
01:38:24,020 --> 01:38:25,700
Oh, are you kidding me?

2435
01:38:25,700 --> 01:38:26,100
Score.

2436
01:38:28,900 --> 01:38:30,020
Decom score.

2437
01:38:30,020 --> 01:38:30,820
Keep up, Scott.

2438
01:38:30,820 --> 01:38:34,420
Score is I would say the main competitor to Heath Bar.

2439
01:38:34,420 --> 01:38:37,620
Score is like a hard crispy toffee covered in chocolate.

2440
01:38:38,500 --> 01:38:39,460
Mike ever heard of it?

2441
01:38:39,460 --> 01:38:39,700
Never.

2442
01:38:39,700 --> 01:38:40,660
You never heard of it?

2443
01:38:40,660 --> 01:38:42,420
Or score score in Heath Bar.

2444
01:38:42,420 --> 01:38:43,700
Oh, you're kidding me.

2445
01:38:43,700 --> 01:38:45,300
You're turning to John McEnroe.

2446
01:38:45,300 --> 01:38:45,620
Jason.

2447
01:38:46,820 --> 01:38:49,060
Jason, I'm throwing this microphone.

2448
01:38:50,260 --> 01:38:51,460
It sounds delicious.

2449
01:38:51,460 --> 01:38:53,940
He would try to go get score bars on Mischief Night.

2450
01:38:53,940 --> 01:38:58,420
But you know, I didn't I didn't have Beaver Tales, but it reminds me the other kind of like Salt Lake

2451
01:38:59,540 --> 01:39:03,940
staple kind of thing that I tried was like Navajo like fried bread.

2452
01:39:04,580 --> 01:39:07,700
And it's like a big thing out there where it's like thick.

2453
01:39:08,340 --> 01:39:12,260
It's like kind of the same thing with the Beaver Tales, where it's kind of like a thicker pastry.

2454
01:39:12,260 --> 01:39:15,060
I don't think it's it might be fried or baked or something like that.

2455
01:39:15,060 --> 01:39:20,820
But there's a lot of like fast food, like specific to Salt Lake, where they had that as like,

2456
01:39:20,820 --> 01:39:24,660
get your thing in like a Nava like a taco or whatever in Navajo fry bread.

2457
01:39:24,660 --> 01:39:25,780
I like that.

2458
01:39:25,780 --> 01:39:30,260
It sounds really good because it's like it's basically a gordita, you know, basically.

2459
01:39:30,260 --> 01:39:30,580
Yeah.

2460
01:39:30,580 --> 01:39:34,980
Like the origin of that is like thicker bread on the sides or like a burger or whatever.

2461
01:39:35,780 --> 01:39:36,740
Yeah, that sounds good.

2462
01:39:36,980 --> 01:39:39,220
Do you remember was it like any of the drinks?

2463
01:39:39,220 --> 01:39:40,820
Were they special in any way?

2464
01:39:40,820 --> 01:39:45,300
I mean, I think for that it was truly the Oktoberfest thing that we kind of

2465
01:39:46,100 --> 01:39:46,980
focused on.

2466
01:39:46,980 --> 01:39:49,540
And then yeah, because I kind of it's funny.

2467
01:39:49,540 --> 01:39:52,100
I usually take lots of pictures, but when I was like looking for my pictures,

2468
01:39:52,100 --> 01:39:55,540
I wasn't finding as many like pictures of food or anything.

2469
01:39:55,540 --> 01:39:59,220
And I feel like I think we I think we just snacked.

2470
01:39:59,220 --> 01:39:59,860
You were living your life.

2471
01:39:59,860 --> 01:40:01,060
I think we did do some Dippin Dots.

2472
01:40:01,060 --> 01:40:03,060
Yeah, you were just living in the moment.

2473
01:40:03,060 --> 01:40:03,460
Yeah, yeah.

2474
01:40:04,020 --> 01:40:06,180
I was really focused on the Pioneer Village.

2475
01:40:06,180 --> 01:40:06,420
Yeah.

2476
01:40:06,820 --> 01:40:07,780
And the furniture.

2477
01:40:07,780 --> 01:40:12,500
Yes, I was looking up souvenir stuff because it's part I haven't been to.

2478
01:40:12,500 --> 01:40:16,820
I usually look up like, oh, yeah, are there notable foods or they're notable souvenirs?

2479
01:40:16,820 --> 01:40:22,260
And one of the like tour videos I watched on YouTube of like people going to the park,

2480
01:40:22,260 --> 01:40:25,300
they pointed out that there's not a ton of souvenir shops.

2481
01:40:25,300 --> 01:40:30,260
No, it's truly I mean, there's there is like another like big memory towards the end of

2482
01:40:30,260 --> 01:40:36,660
the day was that they had a I think they were not rampage, but it's the other primal rage.

2483
01:40:36,740 --> 01:40:38,660
They had a primal rage video game there.

2484
01:40:38,660 --> 01:40:40,820
So I had to stop and play that for a little bit.

2485
01:40:40,820 --> 01:40:44,340
It was the dinosaur fighting game that they actually used claymation

2486
01:40:45,060 --> 01:40:46,900
to animate the dinosaurs fighting.

2487
01:40:46,900 --> 01:40:51,300
And there was also the apes where they could take a piss like as like a taunt.

2488
01:40:51,780 --> 01:40:52,180
Yes.

2489
01:40:52,180 --> 01:40:52,900
And they were.

2490
01:40:52,900 --> 01:40:53,140
Yeah.

2491
01:40:53,140 --> 01:40:54,660
It was a really successful game.

2492
01:40:54,660 --> 01:40:57,940
But then I think Midway bought the company and they were like,

2493
01:40:57,940 --> 01:41:01,540
this is way too expensive to literally do stop motion animation fighting.

2494
01:41:01,540 --> 01:41:05,380
So they like halfway finished the second game and then never put it out.

2495
01:41:05,380 --> 01:41:07,780
That was all like the clay fighters is like that.

2496
01:41:07,780 --> 01:41:08,260
Yeah.

2497
01:41:08,260 --> 01:41:08,820
Yeah.

2498
01:41:08,820 --> 01:41:10,500
There was like a thing everyone was doing.

2499
01:41:10,500 --> 01:41:12,900
And I guess like Mortal Kombat was like real life people.

2500
01:41:12,900 --> 01:41:13,300
Yeah.

2501
01:41:13,300 --> 01:41:14,100
For a while.

2502
01:41:14,100 --> 01:41:17,060
But that was like cheaper than like having somebody like

2503
01:41:17,700 --> 01:41:20,420
I just have like flashbacks of like Nightmare Before Christmas,

2504
01:41:20,420 --> 01:41:23,940
like making a videos of like, you know, just slowly moving.

2505
01:41:23,940 --> 01:41:25,860
It's like, yeah, we need this arcade game.

2506
01:41:25,860 --> 01:41:26,900
We come on six months.

2507
01:41:26,900 --> 01:41:28,340
We don't have time for this.

2508
01:41:28,340 --> 01:41:28,980
Yeah.

2509
01:41:28,980 --> 01:41:29,700
Geez.

2510
01:41:29,700 --> 01:41:32,100
But you hadn't seen one in a long time and they had it there.

2511
01:41:32,100 --> 01:41:32,340
Yeah.

2512
01:41:32,340 --> 01:41:32,980
I hadn't seen.

2513
01:41:33,940 --> 01:41:34,100
Yeah.

2514
01:41:34,100 --> 01:41:37,300
I just have such specific memories of a kid of like that because I don't.

2515
01:41:37,300 --> 01:41:40,980
It did come out for Sega Genesis, I think, and Super Nintendo, but I don't.

2516
01:41:40,980 --> 01:41:41,860
I never owned it.

2517
01:41:41,860 --> 01:41:44,980
So to me, that's like an arcade game memory.

2518
01:41:44,980 --> 01:41:45,620
Oh, yeah.

2519
01:41:46,340 --> 01:41:50,260
If I when I was a kid, if I ever saw one of the is it Neo Geo,

2520
01:41:50,260 --> 01:41:53,620
the cabinets that had like four games and you selected the game,

2521
01:41:53,620 --> 01:41:58,180
I would always play it because it was always games you might never see again.

2522
01:41:58,180 --> 01:41:58,420
Yeah.

2523
01:41:58,420 --> 01:42:00,980
Like you could configure what was in those cabinets.

2524
01:42:00,980 --> 01:42:02,180
So like, yeah.

2525
01:42:02,180 --> 01:42:04,660
I was fighting game obsessed as a child.

2526
01:42:04,660 --> 01:42:05,300
Oh, sure.

2527
01:42:05,300 --> 01:42:06,820
Two or one on one or whatever.

2528
01:42:06,820 --> 01:42:08,100
Just killer instincts.

2529
01:42:08,660 --> 01:42:10,580
Time splitters was another one that was.

2530
01:42:10,580 --> 01:42:10,740
Yeah.

2531
01:42:10,740 --> 01:42:11,140
Splitters.

2532
01:42:11,140 --> 01:42:12,180
I didn't play that one that much.

2533
01:42:12,180 --> 01:42:13,940
That was where you could saw off limbs.

2534
01:42:14,980 --> 01:42:18,500
And somebody could bounce around on like one leg and fight each other.

2535
01:42:18,500 --> 01:42:20,740
I do remember that, but I didn't play it enough.

2536
01:42:20,740 --> 01:42:21,300
Final Fight?

2537
01:42:23,060 --> 01:42:25,140
Is Final Fight one on one or is it a scry scroller?

2538
01:42:25,940 --> 01:42:27,220
It might have been a side scroller.

2539
01:42:27,220 --> 01:42:30,820
Because I like those two, but like the Renit, the fighting game,

2540
01:42:31,220 --> 01:42:33,380
probably this is offensive to real video game people,

2541
01:42:33,380 --> 01:42:36,580
like the Renaissance of the like 90s violent.

2542
01:42:36,580 --> 01:42:36,980
Yeah.

2543
01:42:36,980 --> 01:42:37,060
Yeah.

2544
01:42:37,060 --> 01:42:37,300
Yeah.

2545
01:42:37,300 --> 01:42:37,860
Yeah.

2546
01:42:37,860 --> 01:42:38,420
Fighting games.

2547
01:42:38,420 --> 01:42:39,140
There's a couple other.

2548
01:42:39,140 --> 01:42:41,860
Oh, a Turtles Tournament Fighters, my favorite game of all time, maybe.

2549
01:42:42,500 --> 01:42:46,820
The Ninja Turtles one on one with their, you know, villains and heroes.

2550
01:42:46,820 --> 01:42:50,100
Mine's probably I freak out if I ever see Weeners, the video game.

2551
01:42:50,660 --> 01:42:50,820
Yeah.

2552
01:42:50,820 --> 01:42:51,860
Oh my God.

2553
01:42:51,860 --> 01:42:54,340
Now, now the pure beef is in your hands.

2554
01:42:54,340 --> 01:42:57,380
I mean that I lose my because the joysticks are big.

2555
01:42:57,380 --> 01:42:58,260
Weeners.

2556
01:42:58,260 --> 01:42:58,740
Weeners.

2557
01:42:58,740 --> 01:42:58,980
Yeah.

2558
01:42:58,980 --> 01:43:00,420
They feel so realistic.

2559
01:43:00,660 --> 01:43:04,340
Now they're remaking that so you can get that at home, that console at home.

2560
01:43:04,340 --> 01:43:05,620
Oh, like a little mini version.

2561
01:43:05,620 --> 01:43:06,740
Kind of like a retro.

2562
01:43:06,740 --> 01:43:07,540
The retro Weeners.

2563
01:43:07,540 --> 01:43:09,940
The Weeners look exactly like they did in 2008.

2564
01:43:09,940 --> 01:43:10,580
Really tick shot.

2565
01:43:10,580 --> 01:43:10,820
Yeah.

2566
01:43:10,820 --> 01:43:13,940
You got to play like Super Smash Brothers with that though.

2567
01:43:13,940 --> 01:43:14,260
Oh yeah.

2568
01:43:14,260 --> 01:43:15,060
Works for other games.

2569
01:43:15,060 --> 01:43:15,540
Yeah.

2570
01:43:15,540 --> 01:43:16,660
It's nice they made it to.

2571
01:43:17,300 --> 01:43:20,900
Actually, Jason, I was going to say I did get a magnet from Lagoon because I do.

2572
01:43:20,900 --> 01:43:21,300
Good.

2573
01:43:21,300 --> 01:43:25,300
I do like for a while my thing was like coffee cups and then that guy.

2574
01:43:25,300 --> 01:43:26,740
So many got the coffee mugs.

2575
01:43:26,740 --> 01:43:26,980
Yeah.

2576
01:43:26,980 --> 01:43:27,620
Out of control.

2577
01:43:27,620 --> 01:43:31,460
So I started getting magnets for places in the last few years.

2578
01:43:31,460 --> 01:43:36,020
And so Lagoon it is basically it's the Ferris wheel.

2579
01:43:36,740 --> 01:43:40,580
It looks like it's like a drop thing, but I don't remember seeing that.

2580
01:43:40,580 --> 01:43:46,420
And there's almost like the top of like a carnivory tent and a flag and Lagoon in that kind of rainbowy color.

2581
01:43:46,420 --> 01:43:49,140
And it says Lagoon, the fun spot of Utah.

2582
01:43:49,860 --> 01:43:52,020
Yes, they have some good slow.

2583
01:43:52,020 --> 01:43:52,340
All right.

2584
01:43:52,340 --> 01:43:53,300
Yeah, great.

2585
01:43:53,300 --> 01:43:53,940
Yeah, it is.

2586
01:43:53,940 --> 01:43:54,660
It's fun.

2587
01:43:54,660 --> 01:43:55,460
They're not lying.

2588
01:43:55,460 --> 01:43:58,420
One of their other slogans is just it's what fun is.

2589
01:43:58,420 --> 01:43:59,220
Yes.

2590
01:43:59,220 --> 01:44:00,420
It's what funny.

2591
01:44:00,420 --> 01:44:00,980
Okay.

2592
01:44:00,980 --> 01:44:01,380
Yeah.

2593
01:44:01,380 --> 01:44:01,620
Yeah.

2594
01:44:01,620 --> 01:44:01,940
Okay.

2595
01:44:01,940 --> 01:44:02,260
All right.

2596
01:44:03,220 --> 01:44:04,980
It's minimal means something to me.

2597
01:44:04,980 --> 01:44:06,820
I mean, doesn't seem like you disagree with any of this.

2598
01:44:06,820 --> 01:44:08,660
No, it's like you'll be back.

2599
01:44:08,660 --> 01:44:09,540
I would dig it.

2600
01:44:09,540 --> 01:44:19,380
I think we definitely I haven't been back to Salt Lake in a bit, but I feel like if I the next time I go, I definitely would go again because it's reasonable price and it's like a fun day.

2601
01:44:19,380 --> 01:44:25,380
And it's not like because my experience going to Orlando recently was my first time back since I was.

2602
01:44:25,380 --> 01:44:30,420
A kid and I was like, how could you even do any even a single park is way bigger than anything here.

2603
01:44:30,420 --> 01:44:32,660
I feel like I couldn't do any of those parks in one day.

2604
01:44:32,660 --> 01:44:35,540
Yeah, if I wanted to be thorough, you know, sure, sure, sure.

2605
01:44:35,540 --> 01:44:43,540
Lagoon is like very much like again, I didn't hit everything, but then that's kind of nice because if I go back, then I could give myself a whole different experience.

2606
01:44:43,540 --> 01:44:46,980
Well, yeah, when you go back, you have to see this painting.

2607
01:44:46,980 --> 01:44:49,460
This is at the loading of terror ride.

2608
01:44:49,460 --> 01:44:52,020
This painting is awesome.

2609
01:44:52,020 --> 01:44:58,340
It's got a dragon and a caveman and a wrapped up skeleton and a squid and a snake.

2610
01:44:58,340 --> 01:44:58,980
I don't know.

2611
01:44:58,980 --> 01:45:04,900
Well, and there's a little like there's a vulture at the beginning of that ride that makes a joke about like calling.

2612
01:45:04,900 --> 01:45:08,740
I need to they told me to stop calling small children appetizers.

2613
01:45:08,740 --> 01:45:15,220
Yes, the vulture gives the safety spiel to click clack with a terrific.

2614
01:45:15,220 --> 01:45:15,860
Yeah.

2615
01:45:15,860 --> 01:45:23,460
And then at the end of the ride, there's a there's a big like suddenly you get hit by lights and there's a big honk like a train, a train or a truck is about to hit you.

2616
01:45:23,460 --> 01:45:27,620
And it's so loud that you can hear it from outside the building, like constantly.

2617
01:45:27,620 --> 01:45:32,420
Like the video that I saw is just I was like, why is there what do you keep hearing?

2618
01:45:32,420 --> 01:45:38,100
That's not the best at soundproofing, but it seems like they're among the best at fun.

2619
01:45:38,100 --> 01:45:39,300
There might be some bleed.

2620
01:45:39,300 --> 01:45:44,100
I'm just like thinking the mummy ride where it's like you in the break room, you just say your soul is mine.

2621
01:45:44,100 --> 01:45:49,860
Like every five minutes like, yeah, you get old as you like, just like so what are you doing this weekend?

2622
01:45:50,500 --> 01:45:51,540
I'm going to see a movie.

2623
01:45:51,540 --> 01:45:53,540
It's a free parking of the theater.

2624
01:45:53,540 --> 01:45:54,980
I'm like, oh, is mine.

2625
01:45:55,620 --> 01:45:57,540
It's just like becomes like white noise.

2626
01:45:57,540 --> 01:45:59,940
Like people probably use it to go to sleep at that point.

2627
01:45:59,940 --> 01:46:02,580
Well, they're so used to it and it's calming at that.

2628
01:46:02,580 --> 01:46:09,940
What's funny that you say that because it didn't occur to me until going back to California Adventure is like, oh, I grew up with just fireworks every night at nine o'clock.

2629
01:46:09,940 --> 01:46:10,820
Oh, yeah.

2630
01:46:10,820 --> 01:46:12,740
And I totally forgot about that.

2631
01:46:12,740 --> 01:46:19,140
Like, again, I lived like 15 minutes away, like so I couldn't see them, but we would hear them every night, like nine at nine o'clock, I believe.

2632
01:46:19,140 --> 01:46:19,380
Right.

2633
01:46:19,380 --> 01:46:23,540
Is when the way that's just like a basic of your day.

2634
01:46:23,540 --> 01:46:24,740
I'm like, yeah.

2635
01:46:24,740 --> 01:46:32,820
So like moving to L.A. where it was like with animals being like scared of fireworks, I was like, I feel like I mean, they were all of our pets growing were just fucked up.

2636
01:46:32,820 --> 01:46:34,180
Like, you know what I mean?

2637
01:46:34,180 --> 01:46:36,180
Like having fireworks every night.

2638
01:46:36,180 --> 01:46:36,500
Yeah.

2639
01:46:36,500 --> 01:46:38,020
Pts like constant Pts.

2640
01:46:38,020 --> 01:46:38,260
Yeah.

2641
01:46:38,260 --> 01:46:38,900
Yeah.

2642
01:46:38,980 --> 01:46:44,820
Because L.A. was like then now it was like, oh, like fireworks are I mean, they in L.A.

2643
01:46:44,820 --> 01:46:45,780
It is very terrifying.

2644
01:46:45,780 --> 01:46:49,380
Like when fireworks go off right next to you, like wherever you're standing.

2645
01:46:49,380 --> 01:46:53,620
But yeah, I grew up like grew up just with that as just part of the background.

2646
01:46:53,620 --> 01:46:54,260
Yeah.

2647
01:46:54,260 --> 01:46:57,620
I mean, I guess if it's if it's on a schedule, it's OK.

2648
01:46:57,620 --> 01:47:03,060
Like I guess the first time I went to New York and stayed in a hotel, I was like, that noise never stops.

2649
01:47:03,060 --> 01:47:05,540
That city noise doesn't stop.

2650
01:47:05,540 --> 01:47:06,980
It's like this city doesn't sleep.

2651
01:47:06,980 --> 01:47:07,460
Yeah.

2652
01:47:07,460 --> 01:47:08,420
Is what I thought.

2653
01:47:08,420 --> 01:47:15,380
But it's like, yeah, anything that's like just kind of as long as it comes on time or it's just constant, your brain just goes, whatever.

2654
01:47:15,380 --> 01:47:15,860
Yeah.

2655
01:47:15,860 --> 01:47:17,060
Processes it in the background.

2656
01:47:17,860 --> 01:47:20,820
That's what it's like in Salt Lake City with John Huntsman's band.

2657
01:47:22,820 --> 01:47:24,100
He's always jamming.

2658
01:47:24,100 --> 01:47:27,540
He's jamming loud enough in the governor's mansion for the whole city to hear.

2659
01:47:27,540 --> 01:47:29,380
Has Huntsman ever jammed with Huckabee?

2660
01:47:30,020 --> 01:47:31,060
Oh, boy.

2661
01:47:31,060 --> 01:47:36,580
Well, the whole the whole city with light on fire like Lagoon did in the 50s.

2662
01:47:36,660 --> 01:47:40,100
Because they'd they'd burn everything around them to the ground.

2663
01:47:40,740 --> 01:47:41,620
Heat of their jam.

2664
01:47:42,180 --> 01:47:43,300
Does Huntsman play guitar?

2665
01:47:44,260 --> 01:47:44,900
I'm not sure.

2666
01:47:44,900 --> 01:47:45,940
It might be keyboards.

2667
01:47:46,500 --> 01:47:47,460
Oh, interesting.

2668
01:47:47,460 --> 01:47:49,300
OK, so they could have just rocks.

2669
01:47:49,300 --> 01:47:56,900
He just holds the mic and just he considers himself an Anthony Kiedis of Republican.

2670
01:47:56,900 --> 01:47:57,620
Oh, yeah.

2671
01:47:57,620 --> 01:47:58,820
That's what I didn't say.

2672
01:47:58,820 --> 01:47:59,940
The whole band was nude.

2673
01:47:59,940 --> 01:48:00,440
Oh, yeah.

2674
01:48:01,060 --> 01:48:02,580
Was wearing only socks.

2675
01:48:02,580 --> 01:48:03,080
Yeah.

2676
01:48:03,960 --> 01:48:08,680
Again, Salt Lake City is liberal compared to the rest of this has been so far.

2677
01:48:08,680 --> 01:48:12,280
Thank you for bringing us to this place that we never would have known about.

2678
01:48:12,280 --> 01:48:14,040
Filled with stuff that we love.

2679
01:48:14,040 --> 01:48:16,440
Steven Ray Morris, you survived podcast The Ride.

2680
01:48:16,440 --> 01:48:18,360
Thanks so much for being here.

2681
01:48:18,360 --> 01:48:18,760
Thank you.

2682
01:48:18,760 --> 01:48:20,600
It's been such an honor to join the podcast.

2683
01:48:20,600 --> 01:48:22,200
I have to shout to my friend Carly.

2684
01:48:22,200 --> 01:48:23,560
She's such a big fan of you guys.

2685
01:48:24,840 --> 01:48:27,720
And yeah, and no, it's just this has been so much fun.

2686
01:48:27,720 --> 01:48:32,520
Again, it was one of those things where I was like, like I going to theme parks and having it be part

2687
01:48:32,520 --> 01:48:36,440
of my life, I never realized that like there there's like a whole world of it.

2688
01:48:36,440 --> 01:48:37,640
So that's been very exciting.

2689
01:48:37,640 --> 01:48:39,640
Oh, and like people have lots of fan.

2690
01:48:39,640 --> 01:48:40,120
Yeah.

2691
01:48:40,120 --> 01:48:40,360
Yeah.

2692
01:48:40,360 --> 01:48:41,000
Oh, that's great.

2693
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
Oh, it could be the conduit for that.

2694
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:48,600
And, you know, help you avoid the like Facebook groups that were started 15 years ago about it.

2695
01:48:48,600 --> 01:48:52,280
You don't even want to you don't want to go anywhere near before closed.

2696
01:48:52,280 --> 01:48:56,600
I think the moment that it hit for me, too, is like the idea that there is now an opinion

2697
01:48:56,600 --> 01:48:59,560
about how long the night before Christmas stuff is on Haunted Mansion.

2698
01:48:59,560 --> 01:49:02,920
I was like, oh, I guess that's been around long enough that people don't like that.

2699
01:49:02,920 --> 01:49:06,680
And like it's like the idea that there's a whole subcultures within it because you were probably

2700
01:49:06,680 --> 01:49:09,960
like, it'd be weird to have an opinion about it at all.

2701
01:49:09,960 --> 01:49:10,120
Yeah.

2702
01:49:10,120 --> 01:49:11,400
On multiple.

2703
01:49:11,400 --> 01:49:11,560
Yeah.

2704
01:49:11,560 --> 01:49:11,960
Yeah.

2705
01:49:11,960 --> 01:49:14,840

01:49:32,040 --> 01:49:37,080
I was lucky enough to also go to the Jurassic World ride premiere back when it first opened

2715
01:49:37,080 --> 01:49:37,800

2721
01:49:44,040 --> 01:49:46,120
But how often do new rides open?

2722
01:49:46,120 --> 01:49:49,480
And so to me, that was like one of the coolest experiences ever.

2723
01:49:49,480 --> 01:49:51,320
And I was like, yeah, that was it.

2724
