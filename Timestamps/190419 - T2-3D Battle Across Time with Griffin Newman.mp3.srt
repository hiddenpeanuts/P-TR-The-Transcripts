1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Dog.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Warning, the following podcast contains Singapore Austin Powers,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
the ugly side of fake rocks,

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
a deleted scene southern accented Arnold Schwarzenegger character,

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
an intense quiz about main character names in Avatar,

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and a fully three dimensional look at T2 3D Battle Across Time

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
with special guest Griffin Newman.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Come with us if you want to enjoy a podcast.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
This is Podcast the Ride.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Welcome to Podcast the Ride, hosted by three guys who would be totally cool with

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
cyberdine's rise to power as long as they had a decent theme park division.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm Scott Garener, joined by Mike Carlson and Jason Sheridan.

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Yeah, I'm Mike Carlson.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Yeah, that would be honestly, that's one of the things about the horrible, scary future.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Companies consolidating, machines taking over jobs,

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
but the technology for theme parks and theme park rides going to be very interesting, very cool.

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
So that is something to look forward to.

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I was thinking after thinking of that line that we would probably be,

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,000
we would be like sending each other videos of the demo for the T1000.

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
This is pretty sweet. Like is this for a stunt show or something?

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I think Michael Bennett Dyson has done it again.

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
They filed a patent for a liquid animatronic.

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
It's gotta be, it's gotta be for a Marvel thing.

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Like this, wow, so you could shoot a thing apart and then it reforms?

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
It's not a screen.

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
We're like interviewing its creator at like a live show.

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
We're like, you're so cool, man. You like made all of our dreams come true.

29
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
You working on anything else cool?

30
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Yes, a couple things.

31
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
The actual creator is dead with a twisted neck backstage.

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Robert Patrick has taken on that form.

33
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Let's not go much further with that bringing in our guest.

34
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Returning to the show, continuing his podcast ride 3D film dissertation from the Tick and from Blank Check, it's Griffin Newman.

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Thank you so much for having me back.

36
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Real honor and a privilege.

37
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Two things I want to share right off the top.

38
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Jason had messaged me and I'm in town for the WonderCon convention in Anaheim.

39
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
In Anaheim.

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Right. So he saw that I was going to be in town and said, I don't know if you'd want to come on and talk about other Muppet stuff because there's so many other Muppet things in the park between the shows and the things they've helped I haven't done.

41
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I don't know if I want to pigeonhole myself. Just be the Muppet guy.

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
As the Muppet guy.

43
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
There's a little pigeonhole yet.

44
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
And then you messaged me and said, what if you did Terminator 2 3D?

45
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
And I went, oh, I will totally get pigeonholed as the 3D movie.

46
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Well, that's a little more open-ended.

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I will happily accept that pigeonhole.

48
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Well, and this was a Reddit request.

49
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I wish I had the name on it.

50
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
A couple of people were talking about this on our subreddit.

51
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
But this did apparently come up before on Blank Check.

52
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I apparently said it was one of my five favorite movies of all time.

53
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Terminator 2 3D, which I think I made a similar claim during the Muppet Vision 3D episode.

54
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
That's one of my favorite movies of all time.

55
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Both justified. I don't want to like.

56
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Great films.

57
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Yeah, I don't want to just spoil our takes in general.

58
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
But this is like I was realized I think this is one of my top 10 favorite theme park things ever.

59
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I think also I mean, I assume this is uncontroversial opinion.

60
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
The third best Terminator film.

61
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Oh, sure.

62
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
If we count this as one out of six.

63
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I in the last 24 hours in order to like make sure I could make such claims, I had not seen past two and I watched three Rise of the Machines last evening.

64
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
And this morning because I fell asleep while I was on during what was described to me as the most exciting part.

65
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Rough stuff.

66
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I mean, I was tired anyway.

67
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:14,000
But like, oh boy, what a bunch of like aesthetic lists post matrix leather for no reason.

68
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Have you seen the other two?

69
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
No, I have no idea.

70
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
So I guess you have it with the machine.

71
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I like rise of the machines.

72
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Genesis and salvation are like nightmare movies.

73
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Yes, salvation is kind of stunning.

74
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:39,000
How like kind of empty it is, how nothing it is with like with like as big of a lead as Christian Bale.

75
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Yes, it's like a guy I usually like Sam Worthington.

76
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Oh, yeah.

77
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
The world's greatest charisma magnets.

78
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
And we're not selling himself.

79
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Jake's selling himself.

80
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I just in the last like three months sat down and like even one sitting beginning to end watch T2.

81
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Like I had seen the whole movie in pieces over the years.

82
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Wow.

83
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
But just in one sitting sat down and watched it.

84
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
It was a fairly long sitting because it is a long movie.

85
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Yeah.

86
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Which I had forgotten about from only seeing it in pieces.

87
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I had in one sitting seen Terminator three rise of the machines for some reason.

88
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Really?

89
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Out order.

90
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Yeah.

91
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
How does that change your perception of everything?

92
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
It kind of makes some stuff make sense.

93
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I feel like there's a lot of there's a lot of them going between set pieces in T2.

94
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Like there is a lot of like threads between like, all right, we got to get to this chase and we got to get to this chase and we got to get to this sequence.

95
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
But they're fun little like character exchanges.

96
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I think you're getting to know I mean, you're getting to calm down a little bit.

97
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It really is kind of like the first modern blockbuster in that sense in terms of how it's structured.

98
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Very much like five massive set pieces.

99
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Yeah.

100
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Hold up.

101
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
What's connecting those.

102
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
The effects look better than some movies from like five years ago.

103
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Yeah.

104
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Are you criticizing Terminator 2?

105
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
It seems like I'm reading between the lines.

106
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
You seem like you're saying a little long.

107
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Judgment Day for Jason.

108
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I know.

109
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I thought like it was good.

110
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It did just feel long.

111
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I mean, I feel like my criticism nowadays is for most movies is that is long, which maybe it predicted that.

112
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You and you are not going to be happy when we're sitting in the theater for three hours and two minutes.

113
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Four intermissions, right?

114
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I guess.

115
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
And it has an overture at the start.

116
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Alan Silvestre's Avengers theme.

117
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Yes.

118
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Before I forget, the other thing I want to say as a pre note was at WonderCon yesterday, we did a signing for the tick and a guy came up to me.

119
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
He was like one of the last people at the signing and he leaned.

120
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,000
He was like very shy and he leaned in and he said, please go on podcast the right again.

121
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Wow.

122
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Oh, amazing.

123
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
And I said, Hey, buddy, I'm going on it tomorrow.

124
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
And he reacted as if I had proven that Santa Claus was real.

125
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
He thought it was like a fight.

126
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Like it was going to be like, you know, well, I don't know.

127
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Those guys are going to be into it.

128
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
They see my bad terms last time.

129
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
And I said, dude, it's on the books.

130
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
He almost had a tear in his eye.

131
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Yes, I did not realize it because at the time that I came on this and I just offhandedly said pizza riso is bad.

132
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Oh my God.

133
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
What you were walking into.

134
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
The episodes had not been released yet.

135
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
And I didn't realize that there were going to be like eight consecutive episodes.

136
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I land somewhere in the middle of that of everyone litigating the pizza riso gate.

137
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Out of nowhere.

138
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Yeah.

139
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
A couple of people just walked in without realizing what a thing it had become.

140
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Really the battle for salvation of its day.

141
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I do like that everyone agrees that the pizza is bad.

142
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I mean, that's not even a part of the argument.

143
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
It's about have you seen the party room upstairs?

144
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
It's the party room and is it enough theming?

145
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I think that's the argument because the argument on both sides, one side is like this doesn't look like anything.

146
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Where's the robots?

147
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
The other side is look at the wall.

148
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Look at the poster.

149
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
The poster has a word that's a reference to the Muppets.

150
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
That's cool.

151
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
So it's really I feel like the debate is how much do you want?

152
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I want a lot.

153
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I agree.

154
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I probably fall on the side of just selfishness of the potential of a Muppet restaurant as many people have brought up in the ongoing pizza riso podcast.

155
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
The potential is so great that's a little disappointing.

156
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I perhaps didn't spend enough attention to everything on the wall because the general theming of the room is pretty generic.

157
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
You have to really look at the details.

158
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:39,000
And certainly I have now seen video walkthroughs of the party room and I appreciate that that is a much better room.

159
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:50,000
But I feel like it's a failing if I can walk in there as a massive Muppet fan, eat a full pizza and leave without noticing the amount of theming there is.

160
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Look, I agree with that.

161
00:08:52,000 --> 00:09:04,000
The play might be to go to another restaurant and get like the mobile order to go whatever other whatever trendy food thing Disney is doing a poke bowl chicken and waffles.

162
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Right.

163
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
And then take it in the party.

164
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
The riso.

165
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Yeah.

166
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Sneak out Galaxy's Edge food.

167
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Smuggle it.

168
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Because the pizza is truly terrible.

169
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Yeah.

170
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:22,000
It's next to a good it's next to Mama Melrose which has like a wood burning like real pizza oven which is good.

171
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
And what's supposed to be the original Muppet Gonzo's Pizza Place.

172
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Oh, interesting.

173
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I even got so far I was watching the yesterworld series of videos.

174
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:42,000
They have all like a video about unbuilt stuff or remnants of stuff that was unbuilt and Mama Melrose has these very unique rafter system.

175
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:54,000
And that was like, all right, this is going to be the Gonzo's Pizzeria and Rizzo and his friends and family are going to deliver you pizzas from the rafter like animatronics will deliver it.

176
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
And that's why it was.

177
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
And then they ran out of money.

178
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
The contract got weird.

179
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:11,000
And look, my problem with pizza is the same problem I had with Pizza Planet before it, which is just like there's so much you can be doing here that I kind of I'm reluctant to give you faint praise for what you have done.

180
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Right.

181
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:20,000
You know, this is a thing Tony Baxter has come back to, which is, you know, you don't get you don't win points for what you did given the budget.

182
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Right.

183
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
The audience doesn't know that.

184
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Right.

185
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Like it doesn't say the budget on the on the outside of the building, which would be funny if it said like, here's how much money we had.

186
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
So like, isn't it good what we did with it?

187
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
We prefer it.

188
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Sure.

189
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I think the way they utilize the limited budget they had for and credit coaster is clever and pretty effective when I heard it was just, oh, it's like a repainting and a reskinning of the thing.

190
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I was like, this thing is going to be so lame.

191
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I was so ready to be underwhelmed by it.

192
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,000
And I thought this is a pretty decent re theming considering the schedule and the timing they had.

193
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
And I wasn't really grading it on that curve.

194
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:03,000
You know, I wasn't giving them credit for maybe it would have been better if it had been designed from the get go.

195
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:14,000
But like going on that at night, you're like, this is a pretty effective Incredibles ride that works in a different way than, you know, you don't want it to be the only Incredibles ride.

196
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
But if that's the one that's there now, great.

197
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:24,000
And I think the real test is if you like took it all out and said we're going back to California screaming, would anybody be?

198
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
It would be a minus.

199
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
It would actively be a minus.

200
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I'll say this.

201
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Though someone listening for sure.

202
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Oh, I think multiple people listening.

203
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Yeah, yeah.

204
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Spending the last couple of days walking around Anaheim, but not going into the park.

205
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
So I have seen the IncrediCoaster skyline.

206
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Oh, yeah.

207
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
The convention center.

208
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
It's been right in your face.

209
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:52,000
What really strikes me is I wish they had made it look like the entire roller coaster was her stretching.

210
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Oh, and it feels like they're pretty close to doing that with the red tunnels.

211
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:03,000
But the white of the support feels a little incongruous with the Incredibles aesthetic.

212
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:09,000
And I feel like they could have had like a sculptural arm, you know, or her head on top of the thing.

213
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
$50 million.

214
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Yeah, you can.

215
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Like there's that whole section that's empty on the when you're looking at it in the park on the left that you could put some big, tall thing just to them.

216
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Spinning light contraption like just something doesn't make sense.

217
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
There's a bunch of things like that, but it's pretty close.

218
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Like it's it's not, you know, I mean, it's I think it works.

219
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Yeah, yeah.

220
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,000
They got to do something, though, like that view that you had on what is that?

221
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Catella's at the street.

222
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:46,000
That's that's not the best view for like imagine if there was a big like stretchy Mrs.

223
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Incredible like luring you into the park from the back of Cars Land looks like the back of Cars Land looks really bad.

224
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Yeah, I was sort of the neighborhood.

225
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I think because I'll say the the Guardians sort of facade looks really good from a distance when you're driving up.

226
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
You feel the magic.

227
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Yeah, they did the back.

228
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
They did.

229
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
It's great.

230
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Right.

231
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:10,000
The back of Cars Land feels like, you know, you're walking through like the set of Superstore or something.

232
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
So I plywood, you know, I was down.

233
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I went down to WinterCon.

234
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I saw your panel and walked around and I took the shuttle.

235
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I had to park at Angel Stadium, take the shuttle over.

236
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,000
And I was like, oh, yeah, the back of Cars Land looks like Catastrophe Canyon.

237
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,000
They put up a slight metallic fence, so it wasn't just girders.

238
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Yeah, it's a little a little better than just girders, but still just like some very bland metal work.

239
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
So damning it with faint praise, I guess.

240
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:49,000
But that's like I mean, for the amount of energy they put into trying to sell that Pixar pure was different than Paradise Pier.

241
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,000
You look at that skyline and you're like, it still just looks like a Ferris wheel and like a white roller coaster.

242
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
By and large, it still just kind of looks like an old boardwalk carnival.

243
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
You know, you have to get up close to see what they did different or be in those tunnels.

244
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Right. And I like I like the red tunnels and I'm like, you're so close.

245
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
You know, Incredibles is all like red and black and yellow.

246
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Yeah.

247
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Yes.

248
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
If they painted the whole thing.

249
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
And she's a stretchy lady.

250
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
You're very close to making the thing look good.

251
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Because I think when you're on it, it's pretty effective.

252
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
The internal theming.

253
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Yeah.

254
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
But it's I mean, there's still they still have to put that inside out thing.

255
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:31,000
The repurposed Flix Flyers, which is a Bugsland ride, they're going to put over and make it like emotional.

256
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Right.

257
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
And that's called the emotional whirlwind.

258
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
That's the joke, though.

259
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
But it should have been the emotional roller coaster.

260
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
And I know it's what they wanted in credit coaster because that's the bigger film.

261
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
But emotional roller coaster is such a slam dunk.

262
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Yeah.

263
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Yeah.

264
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I guess the fact that they must have something to do with that.

265
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
They had Incredibles 2 to promote.

266
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Right.

267
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I think so.

268
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:58,000
But you wish like maybe they would have like done a simpler re theming of the what is it?

269
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
California Screamer was what it used to be.

270
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Yeah.

271
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Right.

272
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
To be inside out and then just actually put money into making a proper Incredibles ride.

273
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
But I guess they wanted to have something open by the time 2 came out.

274
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
They wanted to be able to market it.

275
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
It's a pirate on message boards.

276
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I don't remember if it was Mice Chat or WDW Magic, which one that it was like a last

277
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
sitter at the time when he was still around was upset that Pixar hadn't been in the part

278
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
like they hadn't gotten a new Pixar thing.

279
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
So they're like, we'll placate this guy and give him some Pixar.

280
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
And then there'll be a thing we can market as like you go over to the other place when

281
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Star Wars land opens.

282
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Yeah.

283
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
And I feel like I feel like maybe we'll get that inside out ride.

284
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
And then like they'll just kind of be like, who cares?

285
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
We're not going to.

286
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
We did what we did.

287
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,000
We should have allocated some money for power washing that roller coaster because those

288
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
white beams are like dirty when you have on it.

289
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
They're dirty white beams.

290
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,000
They look like the cyclone or something, you know, like they're like old, like pre renovation

291
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Coney Island charm.

292
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
It's an old carnival.

293
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
It's a fair.

294
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
But that's the problem.

295
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:06,000
That then doesn't mesh with like a babysitting adventure.

296
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Mickey's face is still on the pal around, which is so strange.

297
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Yeah, they all know.

298
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Everyone knows.

299
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Everyone knows.

300
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Yeah, that it's yeah, I have a feeling it'll be abandoned as soon as that inside out thing

301
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
is gone or is done.

302
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
We're here.

303
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,000
But it also feels like it makes sense for like since California Adventure didn't have

304
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:33,000
a strong identity for so long to be like this is where like, you know, throwing down the

305
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,000
gauntlet to be like this will be the place where Pixar and Marvel are more represented.

306
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Sure.

307
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
But then, you know, the Marvel thing, it feels like they're doing very deliberately

308
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
working out those rights and figuring out the right technology.

309
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
And the Pixar stuff feels a little just sort of like slapping new stickers on it.

310
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Yeah, I mean, it doesn't make sense to me that they didn't do like just put some robots

311
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
on the Grizzly River run and then put something in the walk around area.

312
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Yeah.

313
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
And like rebrand that because that's an area not even trafficked very much.

314
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
So you really have a chance to completely make a new identity for that part of the park.

315
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Yes.

316
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Do you ever get Slinky Dog?

317
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Like they take out those like that weird like restaurant garden area.

318
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
And I bet that's a moneymaker though for them over there.

319
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Yeah, maybe so.

320
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
They could take out the goofy roller coaster.

321
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
It's not a slinky though.

322
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I guess that's the other weird thing about it is that all these other parks are getting

323
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Toy Story land now and all the Toy Story lands are different.

324
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
So there are like 10 actual Toy Story rides that they could pull from now.

325
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Yeah.

326
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
But most are bad though.

327
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Most are pretty.

328
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
And all this supposed to be good.

329
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Yeah.

330
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
It's supposed to be fun.

331
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Right.

332
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
It's all in a well-made way.

333
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Many, obviously.

334
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
But like we talked about before how like, oh, wait, so what is what are they calling like

335
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
the pizza and pasta and like that little stretch?

336
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
It's like, oh, that's still called Paradise Garden.

337
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,000
So there's our pier Paradise Garden, which is different from Paradise.

338
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Pure is gone.

339
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
But right.

340
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Paradise, Pierotel.

341
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Well, I guess what I was saying before is they're supposedly going to keep theming around

342
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
with Pixar.

343
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
But I have a feeling it's going to be abandoned.

344
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
That's what I'm saying.

345
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Yeah.

346
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
It's like they have some grand plan.

347
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
You think there will never be a phase two.

348
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
You think phase one ends with emotional whirlwind.

349
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Yeah, that's pretty close.

350
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
And the Jesse one, right?

351
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I guess that's almost open.

352
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Is it open?

353
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
It's open, yeah.

354
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
But that's what I feel like they're just going to be like, I don't know, are we going

355
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
to re-theme the rest of the, there's like nothing there.

356
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Because are you going to re-theme the, what do you call it?

357
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
The swings, the silly symphony swings.

358
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
The swings.

359
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
People like Mickey on the top.

360
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
What is that going to be?

361
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
It doesn't matter.

362
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Why would we change the stupid, like take Mickey out and put Brave up on there?

363
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I don't know.

364
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Yes, yes.

365
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
They do a lot of, they did a lot of Cocoa stuff for Day of the Dead in that area.

366
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
So you could make that year round, I guess.

367
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
There's too many bigger things.

368
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
It's a lot of seasonal stuff they do over there too.

369
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
And like you got, we have, either has to be a fantasy land expansion.

370
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,000
They have to build more Marvel once this first underwhelming thing Marvel happens next year.

371
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Tomorrow, like there's so much stuff that has to happen.

372
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I feel like this has got to be in the back of the list or back of the line.

373
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
It should be.

374
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
It should be.

375
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Because it's a fine place.

376
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Even if it's inconsistently themed.

377
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:21,000
But you want to, okay, you want to talk about a property that was not half-assed into a

378
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
theme park.

379
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Something that was done full tilt.

380
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
One of the most expensive attractions of its time.

381
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Yeah.

382
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Yeah.

383
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I think it took that mantle from EO of most expensive per minute.

384
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Yeah.

385
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,000
A fun good fact that short films and theme parks, kind of only short films and theme parks can have.

386
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Well, because the math is that it was what?

387
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,000
It was 12 million for 20, no, I'm sorry, 24 million for 12 minutes.

388
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Yeah.

389
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Wow.

390
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
But then it costs another 36 million for all the other elements.

391
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Yes.

392
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I had to check my notes.

393
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
You had that in your head.

394
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I just, I was cramming everything before coming here.

395
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Yeah.

396
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Watching as many videos, going through the Wikipedia, watching.

397
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Because it's a tough, that's the thing also is it's like, unlike a lot of these shows

398
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,000
or a lot of these 3D movies, it's a really tough one to recapture watching on YouTube.

399
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Yes.

400
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Because of the way they integrate the onstage performers and the 3D footage.

401
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Yeah.

402
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Where you kind of have to watch it and then go like, right, I remember it sort of feeling

403
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
like this.

404
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Because watching a video of live actors entering a 70 millimeter movie is not as impressive

405
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
as you're there.

406
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Holy shit.

407
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
And the screens expand.

408
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Yeah.

409
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
There's so much.

410
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:36,000
This thing did so many, there were so many innovations to this attraction that were not

411
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
done, had never been done before and can't be done besides by Universal.

412
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Universal has like four or five unique patents from developing this one attraction.

413
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Wow.

414
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Just from this thing.

415
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Was this what made Tim Burton, Tim Burton, James Cameron, is this?

416
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
This is what started the 3D.

417
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I wouldn't be surprised.

418
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
His fixation on 3D.

419
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I would not be surprised.

420
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Maybe.

421
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Yeah.

422
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
It makes a lot of sense.

423
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
It looks so fucking good.

424
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
What a beautifully shot film.

425
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Right, it's a 70 millimeter, 40 frames per second 3D.

426
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:20,000
And the other ones like EO Muppet Vision have escaped as like we kind of have the real movie

427
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
of it.

428
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Right.

429
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
You cannot, at least not YouTube, there's no like print of it.

430
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Right, because people will like, you know, pick just the one lens or whatever and make

431
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:34,000
a 2D converted YouTube version that you can watch and get the sense of the movie.

432
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
And even Muppet Vision, the stuff that happens in the theater around you is a little more

433
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
incidental.

434
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Yeah.

435
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
It's fun, it adds atmosphere when you're there, but it doesn't take away from the narrative

436
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
of the movie.

437
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:51,000
The T2 thing is so ambitious in terms of like how many different sort of mediums it's using

438
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
to tell its story, that it's really hard.

439
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I watched a 30 minute video that was the last time they ran it.

440
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I got about seven minutes into that and I had to tap out.

441
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
It's a lot.

442
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
It is a lot.

443
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:10,000
It's also when the woman comes out to give the like the speech as like the Cyberdyne

444
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
official.

445
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Kimberly Duncan.

446
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
The character's name is Kimberly Duncan.

447
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
They applaud like every line.

448
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:23,000
She gets choked at one point and everyone cheers.

449
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Right.

450
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Yeah.

451
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
That's the spirit of like, oh, it's the last time, but it's the weird.

452
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
The last time she dies.

453
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
The last time she dies.

454
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
The mechanism that's clearly lifting her up, but it makes it look like he's lifting her

455
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
up.

456
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Yeah.

457
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
That's right behind the podium.

458
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Actually, it had not occurred to me there was a thing there.

459
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Yeah, that makes sense.

460
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,000
That video ends with at like 22 minutes the show is over, right?

461
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Yeah.

462
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Because there are another 10 minutes on this video and all the live performers come out

463
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
on stage for a curtain call.

464
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Yeah.

465
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Oh my goodness.

466
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
And they're all like crying.

467
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Yeah.

468
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Yeah.

469
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Like it's like, you know, opening night of rent or something and they're all like holding

470
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,080
each other's hands and cheering and then they like huddle and clearly have an intimate moment

471
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,600
with each other and then they come back out and take another round of bows.

472
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,000
The audience is chanting something I don't understand.

473
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Then a woman comes out with a flag and is waving a T2, 3D flag.

474
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
What?

475
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,240
And then it's like a minute of just like encore.

476
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:20,640
That's just like and then one of the two Arnold's comes out and starts flexing and like macho

477
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,520
man like wooting with the crowd.

478
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,800
It's crazy because they have two of each character.

479
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:32,640
So it's weird to see like, oh, here are two Arnold's here are two like John Connors.

480
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,640
I wish I was there though.

481
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,640
I think I would have enjoyed being there.

482
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,000
It was probably amazing to be there.

483
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,080
It was probably a party to be there.

484
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:44,000
Like that Pleasure Island Facebook group that I look at a few times a week and still at

485
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,160
this point, like the community.

486
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,160
I never.

487
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,680
Yeah, I see it shows up in the feed.

488
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,440
Yeah, it shows up in the feed.

489
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,240
I still am kind of blown away that I never thought of all of this stuff is just one big

490
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,240
theater company.

491
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,240
Sure.

492
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:01,360
Everyone in Florida, all the shows share performers.

493
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,360
They travel.

494
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:06,800
There's a guy I coached on an improv team, but he's from Orlando Pirates Dinner Adventure.

495
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,720
And then we ran into him at this this coast Pirates Dinner Adventure.

496
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,320
And he's also at Hogwarts.

497
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,320
It's wild.

498
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,320
It's just it's a small community.

499
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:18,280
I'll tell you, my friend, Becca Siegel, who is a listener of the show, big fan of you

500
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,280
guys.

501
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,280
Thank you.

502
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:26,360
She has worked at both Disney World and Universal and Pirates Dinner Adventure and all of the

503
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,360
sort of pirates.

504
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,360
What?

505
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,360
It's a circuit.

506
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,360
Yeah.

507
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,360
Yeah.

508
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:36,200
And and there is that sort of sense of like the last time I went to Florida and I saw

509
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:39,840
her there, it was like her explaining.

510
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:44,840
It kind of feels like when people try to explain like the history of like improv teams.

511
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:45,840
Yeah.

512
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:52,040
Where she was like, so he was like my gangster when I did great movie ride.

513
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:55,440
And then now I'm doing olive oil and he's doing Bill and Ted.

514
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,440
But Bill and Ted just ended.

515
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:59,360
So we're waiting to see if he's going to get transferred over.

516
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,800
And it was it was we were there the beginning of November.

517
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:05,920
I just fucking missed T2 closing.

518
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:08,640
It was like a trip that had been on the books for a while.

519
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:13,360
My friend Scott Craterman, who is also a listener of the show, and we like missed it by like

520
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,360
a week.

521
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,360
Oh, man.

522
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:21,720
But they had just finished doing Bill and Ted Halloween for the last time ever.

523
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,720
That too.

524
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,720
Oh, yeah.

525
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:28,280
We're all wearing like shirts and it was like, oh, we're like a theater like we're the last

526
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,280
cast of Cats.

527
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,280
Yeah.

528
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,760
We have to like represent this.

529
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:36,400
And they were all like crying and cheering and like going hard at like the Epcot Food

530
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,760
and Wine Festival.

531
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:43,080
I mean, doing a play when you do a play the last night, there is that sense of catharsis

532
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,960
of like we all went through this together.

533
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:50,760
And talking to John Murty, who makes Halloween Horror Nights, what did he said?

534
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,480
Like that happens every year.

535
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,640
The last night of Horror Nights, all the scare actors, like everyone is hugging each other

536
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,640
at the end.

537
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,640
Everyone's crying.

538
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,840
Everyone out together.

539
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:00,840
Like it's wild.

540
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:05,960
The other thing I have found through doing the tick, which has a lot of stunts on it,

541
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:08,000
is a lot of those.

542
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:15,760
I mean, that's like the way that a theme park performers pick up extra cash is to do stunt

543
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,760
performance in movies and TV.

544
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:24,600
And also during dry spells, a lot of regularly working movie and TV stunt people go and do

545
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,600
the stunt shows.

546
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,600
OK.

547
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,880
I know there's a guy named Nico who's like one of the main characters on this new season

548
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,200
playing a creature as the physical performer.

549
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:38,000
And it turned out that he had done like Indiana Jones stunt show.

550
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
And I was like, what, when you got started?

551
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,040
And he was like, no, I did like two weeks ago.

552
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,640
I'm like, probably going to do it again in a couple of months.

553
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:46,840
He like pops in and that need is so specific.

554
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:47,840
And wow.

555
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,840
No kidding.

556
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,400
There really is that sort of like traveling circus.

557
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:55,840
Like if you've spent the time and you've done it, I think both with the people who like

558
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,880
do the face characters and the people who do the shows and the people who do the stunt

559
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:00,880
shows.

560
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:05,000
Like if you have any one of those skill sets, it feels like they're constantly like, hey,

561
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
can you pick up a shift?

562
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,840
Do you want to come over here?

563
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:13,960
She's like the Disney in Orlando and Universal people that go back and forth a fair amount.

564
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:17,320
They're not very territorial about keeping right now.

565
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,920
One or the other have like a nice quality.

566
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:22,000
It's not expensive to live in Orlando.

567
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,560
I mean, I'm sure like everywhere it's getting more expensive.

568
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:30,040
You can have a decent quality of life there in a way that like Los Angeles and New York

569
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:33,800
are a pain in the ass, especially if you are like a barely working actor.

570
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:39,400
My friend, Becca, I knew her from doing improv when we were teenagers together at like summer

571
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:42,400
camp and then we did like improv troops together and stuff.

572
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:48,240
And she then like just loved the theme parks during college, did like the work programs.

573
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,680
And then when she graduated, was like, I just want to work here.

574
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:55,080
And after a couple of years where they have like a pretty robust, like improv theater

575
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:59,040
community in Orlando, where they actually pay all the performers.

576
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,040
What?

577
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:04,120
The shows are well attended with ticket prices because of Taurus.

578
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,120
No way.

579
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:08,600
And like every improviser in Orlando gets paid good money.

580
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,960
And everyone was like, you're really good.

581
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,880
You should really like, you should be doing this in New York.

582
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:14,640
And she was like, I guess I'll go back to New York and try to do it.

583
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,680
And she like came back to New York and did it for like nine months and was on house teams

584
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,640
and was like, what the fuck am I doing?

585
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,560
Like I'm like losing money.

586
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,280
And she just went back to Orlando.

587
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:28,280
I was like, yeah, do like like Tales of the Beetle Bard or whatever the Harry Potter

588
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:31,880
show is and like perform at like 18 different places.

589
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,280
Like she gets a lot of variety.

590
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:38,680
And what you get to do perform for rap, excited audiences constantly.

591
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,680
Right.

592
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:43,280
And she's like, I get to like jump between a bunch of different venues and a bunch of

593
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:46,520
different shows and wear different hats and like literally.

594
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:50,480
Was it like four or five years ago when I was trying to encourage you to audition for

595
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,760
Austin Powers at Universal Singapore?

596
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:53,760
Yeah.

597
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:58,080
And then you started sending one keeper when they started hiring Harry Potter.

598
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,320
I think you were like here.

599
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,640
No, in Singapore.

600
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:04,120
I was trying to get you to move to Singapore for a year or so, I think.

601
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,120
Before the podcast.

602
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:10,240
Looking back, like it's like, yeah, I should have just done that.

603
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,200
Why didn't I do that?

604
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:17,960
I feel like that's like the great tragedy of being a human being, though, is you always

605
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:22,480
go like, I can't like leave my life and go live in Singapore for a year.

606
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,080
And then a year later, you're like, I had nothing going on.

607
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:29,000
You always think you have more to lose in the moment.

608
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,680
Yeah. But you don't take the thing.

609
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:35,160
You can't use the tools and perspective you have now to judge yourself in the past, as

610
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,680
my therapist always tells me.

611
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,680
But yeah.

612
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:43,520
As you sort through your feelings about not being Austin Powers in Singapore.

613
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,000
Yeah, yeah, baby.

614
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Yeah.

615
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:52,440
I think a year from now, Jason, you will look back on this night as I can't believe I didn't

616
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:55,960
leave that recording and board a plane to Singapore.

617
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,320
I should have clearly run off and done it then.

618
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,600
It wasn't too late.

619
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,200
You could at least be gold member.

620
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,120
You could be gold member.

621
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:06,440
Oh, man, if there is a walk around gold member.

622
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,440
Universal Singapore.

623
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,400
You know about a vital.

624
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,400
I don't know.

625
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,280
There's so we always find little hidden stuff.

626
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,280
There could be a whole fifth.

627
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:19,560
There could be like a whole like the full cast of Austin Powers, three face characters

628
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,560
in Universal Singapore.

629
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:23,040
You think there's a Foxy Cleopatra walking around?

630
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,040
I'm just saying it's possible.

631
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:27,040
For some reason, they only got the gold member rights.

632
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,040
Yeah.

633
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,600
So they can only do gold member.

634
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,520
They can only do sumo fat bastard.

635
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,040
Right.

636
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:35,560
You can have Scott evil, but he's going to have the weird hair and plants or whatever

637
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,720
was going on with him.

638
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:43,920
And then there's the like Tom Cruise, Austin Powers, Nathan Lane's cameo as a saucy club

639
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:49,040
goer. What is a movie I have never watched sat and watched all the way through.

640
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,080
So I had no idea about Travolta.

641
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,760
I've been missing big swatches.

642
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,280
Do you know plays mini me?

643
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,040
Do you know based on evil Kevin's?

644
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:59,760
Kevin's basically that's an iconic Mr.

645
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,160
Perry's.

646
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,040
Britney Spears is in the opening credits.

647
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:05,080
Steven Spielberg, Quincy Jones.

648
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:07,040
Right. It's got so many goddamn cameos.

649
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:11,480
I mean, I've seen that and I'll put that on for fun on YouTube once every six months.

650
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,800
You watch Austin Pussy once every six months.

651
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:16,760
Yeah. The condensed film, Austin Pussy.

652
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:21,880
I will say I rarely like, you know, despite now having friends who have worked in the

653
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:26,800
theme park system and realizing it's probably a more psychologically healthy way to be a

654
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:33,520
performer in America than pursuing the traditional entertainment industry, which is like the

655
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:37,920
well of souls, I rarely go like, man, I would like that.

656
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,520
What that looks like, that would be fun.

657
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:42,000
I would love to play that character or do that.

658
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:47,440
I do. I watched the T2 3D video and I was like, man, I probably would have had a great

659
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,040
time playing John Connor for a year.

660
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:52,640
Like, I probably would have loved to play John Connor for a year.

661
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,840
Well, but it is a job, though.

662
00:31:54,840 --> 00:32:01,840
And the normal job like coworkers, you know, spats and management being shitty, like all

663
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,320
of that still happens.

664
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:09,240
100%. That's why I mean, I'm a negative person and I very quickly think about how annoying

665
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:12,920
any situation can get if you're in it for more than five seconds.

666
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:16,800
And the John Connor thing was the first time where I was like, I think this would be cool

667
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:20,680
enough that I would be willing to put up with what was annoying about this job.

668
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,680
Sure. Yeah.

669
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:25,120
There'd be a stretch there before the honeymoon ended.

670
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:30,000
Right. I can attest from my theme park days one magical summer and I was ready for, all

671
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,440
right, here we go again.

672
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,680
Oh, it sucks immediately.

673
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,680
Yes. Yes.

674
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,160
They are all making me wistful.

675
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:40,320
You're making me want to go back and see if I can overturn that letter that they fired

676
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,280
me with because I hadn't worked a shift in seven months.

677
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:47,680
I mean, you said in one episode that you would love to go back and get to do it like once

678
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:50,000
a year. Yes, I absolutely.

679
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,440
The old John Lasseter.

680
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,880
Run the jungle cruise again.

681
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,760
Well, let's not put that on.

682
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,000
A gentleman's hug.

683
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
No, no.

684
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,720
It's more like SNL guy returning to host the show.

685
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,800
Yes, yes, it's like that.

686
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,800
That's the way.

687
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,680
Not like John Lasseter hosting SNL.

688
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:08,600
Yeah, it's like when Chevy Chase returns to host SNL.

689
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:11,600
Or Kevin Spacey returns.

690
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,840
The cast is thrilled.

691
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,440
Is he in the five timers club?

692
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,680
Did they revoke that?

693
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,840
I think he only got to three or four.

694
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,960
Louis almost made it to five.

695
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,440
Real close on Louis.

696
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:27,880
There's that one year, the like last sort of pre Weinstein year of SNL has like six

697
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:31,240
hosts or musical guests who would never be on the show ever again.

698
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,240
Oh, yeah.

699
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:39,640
There's like a run of like James Franco, R. Kelly, Casey Affleck.

700
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,920
Of course, John Lasseter hosted SNL.

701
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,000
Harvey Weinstein.

702
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,840
Harvey Weinstein.

703
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,160
Great episode, though.

704
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,320
Really good character.

705
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,120
I mean, he's reading the cards.

706
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,760
He's reading the cards.

707
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:53,720
He's committed, though.

708
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:54,320
He's committed.

709
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,360
Except for the shirts.

710
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,200
He would not take off the Hawaiian shirts.

711
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,480
He just kept changing Hawaiian shirts.

712
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:02,640
He dances with Jason Sudeikis on What's Up with That.

713
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,120
Really great, really funny.

714
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,520
He was having fun.

715
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:11,280
Well, OK, let's I mean, I'm not even sure where to really start tackling this.

716
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:14,000
But OK, well, I'll say this.

717
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:19,040
The if you talk about what would be a fun part to be in this show, which, by the way,

718
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:23,480
is a synthesis of a 3D film and live performers on stage.

719
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:27,920
I feel like the one bummer about being John Connor is that like I think you

720
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:30,600
you would have a really fun run of that, but at some point it becomes

721
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,920
pretty precise hitting of marks.

722
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:35,720
And I'm especially convinced of this from watching

723
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:42,640
James Cameron at the rehearsal space where they've set up a temp stage,

724
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:45,440
mimicking the dimensions that will eventually be in the theater

725
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,320
parallel to where they were filming.

726
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:51,320
Like they were spending time both filming on the sets they had built

727
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:55,760
and then going over to the airplane hanger where they built the replica

728
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:59,120
of the theater to make sure that the two things would work in concert.

729
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:05,200
Yes. Yeah. Eventually building to I think way down the line, building to the 3D

730
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:10,040
team, having to consult with the live team, two things that should never

731
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,400
and rarely meet. Yeah.

732
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:15,960
But that like that making sure the team one million is crossing

733
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:19,080
with the correct amount of seconds that it would take John and Sarah

734
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:21,120
to get from stage left to stage right.

735
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:21,720
See, that's the thing.

736
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:24,880
I think it would be a very difficult job and it is very precise.

737
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:28,760
But there must be a thrill to if you're doing that show,

738
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,920
the audience is going to gasp every time.

739
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,160
Like the first couple of times that there's that interaction

740
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,280
with someone going in the screen and coming out the screen.

741
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,600
It's so fucking effective.

742
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:44,080
The motorcycle coming out of the screen is insane and still looked good in 2017.

743
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,880
You're just on some video. Yeah.

744
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,000
Yeah. Yeah.

745
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,840
Really? And watching on the video, I was like, right, right.

746
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:53,600
The guys really don't look like Arnold Schwarzenegger. Sure. Sure.

747
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:56,960
But you're so impressed by the fact that a guy has like come through the screen

748
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,600
that you don't care at all. Yeah.

749
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:04,720
So this was my entrance point to the Terminator franchise. Me too.

750
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:08,920
I was when I was 12 years old and had not seen the Terminators.

751
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:11,920
And after that, I was like, well, that's maybe the best theme park

752
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,720
attraction I've ever witnessed.

753
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:17,000
I was all in and then like went home, watched Terminator one,

754
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,760
watched Terminator two, retrofit it from like I'm buying what they're selling.

755
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:25,280
Yeah. And I think I didn't understand how much mythology

756
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,240
there was around Terminator.

757
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,680
I was like, is it just like a robot slasher movie?

758
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:32,000
My parents like hated action movies. They never let me watch them.

759
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,840
So I think I kind of dismissed it in the way when you're a kid,

760
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:38,160
if you're not allowed to watch something, you pretend like you don't like it.

761
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,400
Right. Exactly.

762
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:43,640
I think probably I was like saying, I'd rather watch Beauty and the Beast.

763
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,600
I just think scary movie doesn't look funny.

764
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:49,040
It looks juvenile to me. I wouldn't even bother seeing it.

765
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,000
I don't want to hear this jerky boys CD. Right.

766
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,400
So I was in that mode.

767
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:57,280
And then I remember my dad was like, you know, he had the boys.

768
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:01,320
My mom was, you know, with my sister, who was very young at the time.

769
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:04,160
And he was like, come on, let's go on like the Terminators, like a little edgy.

770
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,120
It's kind of like a big kids ride.

771
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:10,120
You know, and I think he liked that he knew he would be able to sit down in a seat

772
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:12,280
and not have to go on some like thing.

773
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,280
But a little surprise at the end. Right.

774
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,400
My father never seen any of the Terminator movies, like took us

775
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:20,800
just because I think he thought it would be like easier on his back.

776
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:25,440
And I sat there and I was like, even just from the theming of like the pre show stuff,

777
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,200
I was like, I like this is like an evil company.

778
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,120
I like that it's sort of like a consumer facing company

779
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:34,160
that's clearly like message as like having the sinister edge.

780
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:37,040
And then when the video cuts in, I was like, I don't know who Sarah Connors.

781
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,800
I don't know who John Connors, but I love that it's about them

782
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,040
trying to change the future.

783
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:44,960
I was like so on board and I walked out of the thing

784
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:49,520
and I went to the gift shop and I bought myself a bunch of Terminator merchandise.

785
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,800
Literally in the gift shop.

786
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,880
And I was like, I love this character.

787
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,400
I love the Terminator.

788
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,080
And then like, yeah, yeah.

789
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:59,520
Like a week later, like went back to New York and was like, cool,

790
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:03,800
I guess I got to watch those those prequels to Terminator 2, 3D.

791
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,800
Yeah. Yeah.

792
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,240
And then it became one of my favorite franchises to the point

793
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,800
where I still do like kind of like three

794
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,600
because I'm so all in on Terminator.

795
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,680
It's still giving you tastes.

796
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:20,000
It's this image I know is the system I know and this sound and like. Right.

797
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,320
Right. The other two for me are just like, what about the show?

798
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:28,600
I was when it was not very able to get into Sarah Connors Chronicles.

799
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,600
I know some people like it a lot.

800
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,320
Yeah, it's like there's so much.

801
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:35,440
I feel like is there a franchise, though, with more stuff

802
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,040
that people don't like than Terminator? No, no.

803
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,520
I like the mythology.

804
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,480
It's called The Simpsons.

805
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,760
Fair enough.

806
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:45,520
I think what's weird, though, about the Terminator, though,

807
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:48,520
is that you go like, OK, Cameron makes two of them.

808
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:53,000
Yes. And then they get him to commit to make the 3D thing,

809
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,480
which functions as like a little bonus little coda thing.

810
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:00,440
But two and so conclusively, he says, though, in that video.

811
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,760
Did you catch that? He says this is a third one.

812
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:06,200
He says this movie might act as a bridge to the third one.

813
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:10,200
Part of why I wanted to watch three, and I think it would only

814
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:13,080
it would only be a bridge to his third one.

815
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:18,000
The other really weird, interesting thing about the Terminator franchise

816
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,880
is it's like the only massive franchise that isn't owned by a studio.

817
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,520
It like the rights are so fucking weird.

818
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:29,120
We're like the rights for all of them are different partially owned by Gale

819
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:34,320
and heard is that who the rights finally reverted back to him.

820
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:39,400
OK. And then I think the Ellison's put up the money to buy it

821
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:45,440
to get to give him the financing to make because he's now producing this new one.

822
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,280
Right. There's another fucking Deadpool guy. Right.

823
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,040
Like, that's the thing that's so fascinating is like you go like, OK,

824
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,840
Simpsons, maybe now they're on average more episodes

825
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,920
that people dislike than the ones that people love.

826
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:59,240
But Terminator is fascinating because like every five years, they're like,

827
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:02,000
clean start. We're finally going to get it right this time.

828
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:06,680
Mythology allows for that because time distortion and the time straight.

829
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:09,000
Like you could just say, oh, that one doesn't count now.

830
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:13,840
A new new timeline in a way where it's like it seems insane.

831
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:17,680
The way they handled that with all the X-Men movies were like trying to like,

832
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:20,440
oh, Matthew Vaughn breathe new life into it.

833
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,280
Singers back, baby.

834
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,640
It's like immediately he fucks up the timeline.

835
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:27,200
He really fucks up the timing line and like, yeah,

836
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,800
Patrick Stewart and Hugh Jackman are back, too.

837
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,920
But then we have to marry it with these young people also.

838
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,320
And it doesn't really make a lot of sense.

839
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:39,240
Terminator can just like hard reset anytime they want,

840
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:41,880
jump to any dimension or any alternate reality.

841
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:44,640
But the weird thing is you go like, OK, he makes his one.

842
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,400
He makes his two.

843
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,160
He maybe wants to make three, but he never had control of the rights.

844
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:52,480
And they were always like, you know, getting like because I think.

845
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:56,440
Who was it? It was some company that then went under,

846
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:59,000
made and released Terminator two.

847
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,080
Carol Co. Right. Right.

848
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,440
So then the rights transferred.

849
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:05,040
And then it was like, I don't want to work with these people.

850
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:09,200
You know, like the people who then inherited it, the sequel rights, at least.

851
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:11,400
He didn't want to make it for them.

852
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,920
So then they ended up selling it to Warner Brothers.

853
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,440
And he was like, I'm burned. I'm not going to do it.

854
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:19,760
And then apparently told Arnold, like, you should do it and ask for more money

855
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:22,120
than anyone's ever made in a movie, which he did.

856
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,560
Arnold made 30 million dollars.

857
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,800
Oh, my God. 15 years ago from Terminator three.

858
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:31,520
That's kind of like the laziest of his performances.

859
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,640
And then Warner Brothers felt like it underperformed.

860
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:35,040
And then they let it lapse.

861
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:40,520
And then it was like, I'm trying to remember the universal make salvation.

862
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,360
Oh, I think Warner Brothers ended up distributing it,

863
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:45,640
but it was through another production company bought it.

864
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,720
And they announced like whole new start. It's a trilogy.

865
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:51,680
We're making a clean trilogy. That's the future war.

866
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,840
It's the John Connor trilogy.

867
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,080
And people don't like that.

868
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:57,440
And then they're like, cool, new rights.

869
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,400
I think that's when the Ellison's bought it.

870
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:02,960
The Ellison's bought it because then David Ellison finances

871
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:07,120
Genesis, right, which was originally Megan Ellison was like,

872
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:09,080
Anna Perna is going to do a high.

873
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:11,200
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

874
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,040
I remember this.

875
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:14,520
We're going to make like Terminator has legitimacy.

876
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,600
We're going to make a highbrow action film.

877
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,680
And then she tried to do it for like six months and was like,

878
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:21,200
my brother can take it. He can fucking make whatever he wants.

879
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:25,600
And then they were like, we're going to try to get back to basics like Arnold's back.

880
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:28,000
We're going to try to like tie it back in.

881
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,280
And then they gave him back. Right.

882
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:31,360
The rights finally.

883
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:32,720
She is. She is back.

884
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:33,760
She's back in the new.

885
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,360
She is. Yeah.

886
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:41,000
Either pictures of her being cool and that aftermath or it's got a generic subtitle.

887
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,640
It's impossible.

888
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:43,720
And game. Yeah.

889
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:45,480
Arnold's back in it.

890
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,600
They're all. Yeah.

891
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:47,160
Not for long.

892
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:47,720
It's not bad. Right.

893
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:49,560
And then there are a bunch of new Terminators.

894
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:51,760
Who's what new actors are in it.

895
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:52,840
Do we know?

896
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:53,520
Gadd.

897
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:54,520
Josh Gadd.

898
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:55,600
Oh, no.

899
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,400
Megan Trainor.

900
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:59,640
What's Mackenzie Davis?

901
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,520
Am I getting her name wrong?

902
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:02,960
Oh, it's from Home Catch Fire.

903
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:03,720
Yes. Yeah.

904
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:04,360
Oh, she's great.

905
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:07,320
She's the new female lead, which is really exciting because she fucking rules.

906
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:09,160
And she was in the new Blade.

907
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:11,360
Like she rules in that made for these movies.

908
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:12,880
Yeah. Really should.

909
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:15,160
And then there are like a couple actors I'd never heard of who are like

910
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:17,000
the other new young leads.

911
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:21,280
But you have like gray haired Sarah Connor and old man Arnold.

912
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,640
Sure. Why not?

913
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:26,360
And Cameron's involved for the first time in 20 years.

914
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:26,960
Yeah. OK.

915
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:27,920
Like he's producing it.

916
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:30,040
T.J. Miller is a Terminator.

917
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:33,000
That seems like a poor choice.

918
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,600
No, it's like the three movies ate shit in a row, essentially.

919
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,440
And then they're like one of these.

920
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,920
And it's only been like two years.

921
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,240
Like that's a crazy thing.

922
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:45,680
Oh, right. The pictures of Linda Hammett with the spiky hair.

923
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:46,640
Yes. She looks awesome.

924
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,000
She looks rad. Yeah.

925
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,080
OK. All right.

926
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:52,600
But there was some weird thing where it was like the rights kept on getting.

927
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:56,400
Kept changing hands because of companies shutting down.

928
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:00,200
It would always be like two guys would like come in with Saudi Arabian money

929
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:03,960
and be like, we've raised 80 million dollars to buy the Terminator rights.

930
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:07,520
And then like a year later, the movie would have bombed and they'll be in jail.

931
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:10,720
And finally, there was something related, though.

932
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:15,320
Right. After 35 years, the rights went all the way back to him.

933
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:18,280
And so he finally got them back.

934
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:22,000
Which maybe he knew all he's like, I'm just waiting it out around.

935
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,200
I'm running out the clock.

936
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:24,320
Yeah. Do that.

937
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:26,960
Did he travel back to make this happen?

938
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:28,560
Should be also added.

939
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:33,480
There is like a decade plus, maybe two decades of dark course Terminator comics.

940
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:35,600
Yeah, there's a little bit of its own continuity.

941
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:36,960
There's the row.

942
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,200
This is really fun.

943
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:42,480
Robocop versus Terminator comic written by Frank Miller, drawn by Walt

944
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,560
Simon, where essentially Robocop goes back

945
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:50,480
or terminator gets somehow Robocop creates the terminator.

946
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:51,560
Really?

947
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:52,920
The time paradox.

948
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:56,480
There's an endoskeleton in the Robocop armor, which I own an action figure.

949
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:57,040
Yeah.

950
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:57,920
Oh, wow.

951
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:00,240
Will there be Avatar versus Terminator?

952
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:01,280
No question. Gotta be.

953
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:02,000
Has to be right.

954
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,360
Gotta be like it will be called Avatar versus Terminator.

955
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:06,440
It has to be good.

956
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:07,200
Well, no, I'm what it was.

957
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,640
So where what studio has the new movie?

958
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:12,800
Oh, that's a good question, because obviously Avatar is now Disney.

959
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:15,000
Right. So it's not Disney.

960
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:16,040
But I don't know.

961
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:16,720
I don't know what he's.

962
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:20,200
But I'm like, did Fox have does Fox have the new Terminator?

963
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:23,560
Jason, if so, then it's right there.

964
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:27,480
They would put the Terminator on that like montage of what was on their site.

965
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:28,560
Disney is Glover.

966
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,040
But they have alien now.

967
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:31,280
Right. Disney owns alien.

968
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,280
But I don't know. I don't think they have Terminator.

969
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:37,280
Can a Navi fight a Terminator in the big suit from alien?

970
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:41,760
Yeah. I guess whoever the distributor of this movie is, it seems that

971
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:44,440
James Cameron has the underlying rights.

972
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:45,200
That's true. Oh, right.

973
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,960
Cameron's pretty set up at Disney.

974
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:48,200
Good point.

975
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:52,160
Paramount Pictures, 20th Century Fox International,

976
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:57,640
Sky Dance, Lasseter Country, Light Storm and 10% Pictures.

977
00:45:57,640 --> 00:45:59,640
Wow. Light Store, I think, is Cameron's company.

978
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:00,560
Everyone's got a taste.

979
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,600
Everyone's got a little nip.

980
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:05,240
Oh, wait. Distributed by.

981
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:07,360
So that's the production company.

982
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:10,640
And then distribution is Paramount Pictures in North America.

983
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:13,200
Walt Disney Studios, internationally.

984
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,520
Oh, yeah.

985
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:16,720
So they're interesting.

986
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,600
I mean, we might see Disney

987
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,440
one in the Terminator and in some way.

988
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:25,160
Oh, and then maybe new theme park attractions down the road.

989
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:26,880
Right. Oh, my God.

990
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:30,280
Because you have to imagine they're going to start trying to.

991
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:35,040
I mean, the big Fox franchises, Planet of the Apes and Alien and Predator.

992
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:37,200
Disney is going to start working their magic with.

993
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,360
They did apes. Fuck. Oh, they had.

994
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:40,800
They'll have to do it. They'll have to.

995
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,720
That's one of those legacy franchises.

996
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:44,520
Yeah. Franchise that could do anything.

997
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:45,600
There will be.

998
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:47,240
I think I've said this on the show before.

999
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:50,040
When we it's all said and done, when we're 85 years old,

1000
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,520
there'll be a hundred different Planet of the Apes movies.

1001
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,920
Yeah, there'll be 150 Terminator movies.

1002
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:57,840
Like there will be so many of everything we've had.

1003
00:46:58,040 --> 00:46:59,680
And like five percent will be good.

1004
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:01,200
Yeah, we got to talk about this.

1005
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:04,760
This movie apparently involves Arnold Schwarzenegger's 1991

1006
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:10,560
facial likeness being applied through CGI and Edward Furlong's 1991

1007
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:11,640
facial likeness back.

1008
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:14,920
Whoa. Being put on another actor, being put on another actor.

1009
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:18,240
But Jude Collie is being credited as John Connor.

1010
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:19,920
What is the subtitle of this movie?

1011
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,440
Dark Fate. Dark.

1012
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:24,440
Dark. No other franchise could be.

1013
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:26,640
Chubby rain.

1014
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,440
Wow. Dark Fate, huh?

1015
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:31,320
That is interesting.

1016
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:33,200
I mean, they've already done D.A.

1017
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:34,920
Aged Arnold twice now.

1018
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:38,360
Yeah. That's the other thing with how many failed like revivals

1019
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:40,400
they've had is salvation.

1020
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:45,000
The one that Arnold isn't in ends with Christian Bale fighting

1021
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:49,200
a CGI facsimile of young Arnold. Right.

1022
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:53,200
And they like digitally render Pumping Iron Arnold.

1023
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:55,840
And he has a naked fight with him.

1024
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:58,280
And he talks about how the pump is like an orgasm. Right.

1025
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:00,280
Which he does in the movie. Right.

1026
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:06,080
And Genesis has both an older Arnold and a younger Arnold. Right.

1027
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:08,640
They age him up and age him down.

1028
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:11,280
That I feel like I've seen the least of is Genesis.

1029
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:14,600
It's one of those movies that is almost impossible to watch.

1030
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,360
You just can't focus on it.

1031
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:17,880
It's almost impossible to find.

1032
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:20,680
Like, it's not a thing I see pop up on streaming services.

1033
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:23,400
I remember which is where this is so confusing.

1034
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:27,240
If we don't start talking about the 3D thing, but the 3D thing,

1035
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:29,160
that's cool. That is one of the best.

1036
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:31,320
The is it the third best?

1037
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:33,360
I think it's easily the third.

1038
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:35,840
There's an argument for being the second best.

1039
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:40,720
I rewatched the first one not too long ago

1040
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:44,360
and had a lot more appreciation for it than I did when I was a kid.

1041
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:48,080
Because when you're a kid, like T2 is just like fucking perfect.

1042
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:50,120
Right. And T1 is kind of upsetting.

1043
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:52,720
Yeah, because Arnold's a bad guy.

1044
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:55,120
It's like it feels much more.

1045
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:58,120
It feels like 30 years of film technology changed.

1046
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:00,160
Yeah. Between the two movies, even though somehow.

1047
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:03,920
And also Arnold became like every kid's favorite movie star.

1048
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:05,760
And they were like, well, I guess it's got to be about

1049
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:07,920
him hanging out with a kid now. Right.

1050
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:10,240
You know, the first one is like a slasher movie.

1051
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:11,920
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

1052
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:16,480
We had no in whereas with the night in the 90s, it's now like a

1053
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,920
like it sits right next to Wayne's World or whatever.

1054
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:24,400
Like, yeah, like cool kids with attitude like the Ninja Turtles, too.

1055
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:27,040
They made it like kind of their home alone.

1056
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:29,360
They like those are all like in a similar

1057
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:32,080
like we've got a conduit with characters.

1058
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:36,160
Like like Simpsons and like Wayne's World and Terminator.

1059
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,520
When I was young and my mom wouldn't let me watch them, I was like,

1060
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:42,520
I don't know which one has Icarumba and which one has Hasta la Vista.

1061
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:46,200
Oh, no. They all seemed like a similar vein of just like.

1062
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:48,640
They all say, dude. Right. Bad attitude.

1063
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:51,520
Like the comedy was parodying, though. Right.

1064
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:53,920
So like a lot of stuff I learned.

1065
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:56,880
I learned I saw the parody first. Yeah.

1066
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:59,480
Like step by step doing a parody of Wayne's World.

1067
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:02,040
Oh, step by step doing a parody of film noir.

1068
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:04,920
There's like a detective episode.

1069
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:08,840
And I think I'd seen one or two old movies, but I was like, I like this.

1070
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:13,440
I also like I got the impression from watching a thousand like cartoon shows

1071
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:17,360
do Terminator parodies that his catchphrase was I'll be back.

1072
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:20,120
Like that was like the thing he would say every time he shot someone.

1073
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:22,720
And then you see and he only says it in one of the movies.

1074
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:26,480
Well, the later ones, they keep on finding dumb ways to bring it back.

1075
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:31,040
But it's like it's literally just him saying like, cool, I'll be back. Right.

1076
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:33,040
Like, yeah, it's not meant as a catchphrase.

1077
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:36,240
No, no. It's just like a cool fucking moment.

1078
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:39,040
Me having watched Terminator three in the last 24 hours,

1079
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:41,200
I'm still reeling from talk to the hand.

1080
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:42,640
Oh, you didn't know about talk to the hand.

1081
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,080
No, but talk to the.

1082
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:46,880
I'm recovering from like a leather daddy.

1083
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:50,760
Yeah. This is wonderful in 2019.

1084
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:52,920
What a great voice to hear in 2019.

1085
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:56,400
Have you seen because this feels like the kind of pop culture ephemera

1086
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:58,320
that you would go down a rabbit hole on.

1087
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:01,320
There is a deleted scene from Terminator three rise of the machines

1088
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:04,000
that I think they didn't even put on the DVD,

1089
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,640
but they hit it as an Easter egg on the video game.

1090
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:09,880
Oh, man. Well, you see the

1091
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:14,160
the cyber dying like conference meeting

1092
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:16,800
where they pitched the Terminator for the first time.

1093
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:21,320
Oh, and the guy showing the technology is Arnold Schwarzenegger

1094
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:25,400
playing a man named Sergeant Candy with a southern accent.

1095
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:26,200
Oh, my God.

1096
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:27,560
And he's really jovial.

1097
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:31,200
He's like, I'm telling you, these terminators are going to get the job done.

1098
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:33,200
You won't be able to tell the difference.

1099
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:37,280
And it's like Arnold with this insane, like high comedy character.

1100
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:41,000
And then he like turns off the video and goes, so what do you think?

1101
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:42,680
And everyone's sitting there.

1102
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:46,240
And then there's this mousy guy at the end of the table in the boardroom.

1103
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:49,640
And he in Arnold voiced dubbed

1104
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:53,240
Vio says, change their voice.

1105
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:55,600
What? What?

1106
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:57,760
And I never, ever heard of this.

1107
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:01,080
They explain it feels like a fucking mad TV sketch,

1108
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:04,240
but it was properly shot for the movie. Oh, my God.

1109
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:05,520
And it's on the Internet now.

1110
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:08,680
And it's them trying to explain why the Terminator looks and sounds

1111
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:10,560
like Arnold Schwarzenegger.

1112
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:14,160
Whoa. Which needed to be if we did not fill this in. Right.

1113
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:17,640
It's mostly like Arnold Schwarzenegger doing a silly character

1114
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:20,720
in a parody of like an industrial film. Oh, my God.

1115
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:24,640
I'm really upset that we can't just like stop the podcast and watch this right now.

1116
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:28,440
You know, I will race to watch this as soon as oh, boy.

1117
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:30,600
Well, you you saved Terminator three for me.

1118
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:34,000
That is right. That is the fourth best Terminator film.

1119
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,240
Is the deleted Sergeant Candy saying Sergeant Sergeant

1120
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:40,400
and Sergeant Candy? I want to let me verify this.

1121
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:44,120
I'm reporting for duty. That's Jason's name in the military.

1122
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:49,520
Didn't we land on a snack master general?

1123
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:50,840
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1124
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:52,360
Tree master. Tree master.

1125
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:54,360
C. Everett Scoop.

1126
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:57,640
Ice cream. Ice cream.

1127
00:52:57,640 --> 00:52:59,200
Gotti. Ice cream.

1128
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:00,080
Gotti. Yeah.

1129
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:02,000
Let's not forget ice cream.

1130
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,760
A confirmation is on YouTube.

1131
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:05,600
It is Sergeant Candy.

1132
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:06,720
That's so.

1133
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:09,880
No, but I want to see a scene about why he's named Sergeant Candy.

1134
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:12,080
Sergeant William. I need that origin story, too.

1135
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:13,240
Yes. He was a candy.

1136
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:15,040
Want to meet his parents?

1137
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:17,360
This is what he it's like him smiling.

1138
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:19,120
He looks like a beret.

1139
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:20,880
Jean-Claude in Street Fighter. Yes.

1140
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:24,080
He's got like military fatigues and a red beret on.

1141
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:25,720
And like Max Fisher.

1142
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:28,360
Right. And then this is the guy who has the Arnold voice.

1143
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:32,720
He's like a mousy looking guy who any one of us could have played.

1144
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:35,720
Whoa. And then he says like, lose, change their voice.

1145
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:40,760
So that man was then several years down the line in a recording studio,

1146
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:43,080
saying every syllable and letter of the alphabet.

1147
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:46,760
So like to form the voice algorithm for the Terminator.

1148
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:48,600
Right. Right. That was the idea.

1149
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:50,760
B. C. Right. Right.

1150
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:52,920
He was like the Alexa.

1151
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:53,640
Yeah.

1152
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:56,160
There's some click bait article about him.

1153
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:58,880
You just don't know the term of the guy who did the Terminator's voice.

1154
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:03,040
Now, I think one of the reasons why, even though they can reset things,

1155
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:07,600
it always feels weird when they try to revive the franchise is that

1156
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:10,640
the first one is about the inevitability of the thing

1157
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:13,080
and is more just about the idea of that existing.

1158
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:16,720
And two is the movie where he's like, I'm going to fucking cash my check.

1159
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:21,080
And make the movie about them trying to just stop it like straight up.

1160
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:22,080
Stop it.

1161
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:25,560
And it ends with such a sense of like accomplishment

1162
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:29,680
that every time a new movie starts with like, oh, fuck, we forgot a thing.

1163
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:32,480
They outsmarted us. We got to do it again.

1164
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:34,680
It feels kind of cheap.

1165
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:39,240
But the thing I like about T2 3D is that it's just kind of like

1166
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:41,280
we're really close.

1167
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:43,640
We pretty much got it down in the last one.

1168
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,760
It's not enough to sustain a whole movie.

1169
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:47,960
We just need like 10 more minutes.

1170
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:52,360
But also, the nice thing is it's them going to the future.

1171
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:55,840
Yes, that's a new thing because you always have the heroes in the present.

1172
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:57,640
The Terminator is coming back to them.

1173
00:54:57,640 --> 00:55:01,080
And it's kind of fun to see like Sarah Connor and John Connor,

1174
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:04,120
like in the fucking future war hellscape. Right.

1175
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:05,920
It does the thing that universal rides.

1176
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:09,440
We've said this to do this way more than Disney is expand the universe.

1177
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:12,040
They build out the new thing and expand the mythology.

1178
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:18,040
And they like cut corners, but in productive ways like,

1179
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:21,560
OK, you know how they have to be naked.

1180
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:23,120
They're not naked this time. Who cares? Right.

1181
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:24,800
And they go to the future.

1182
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:27,200
And yeah, the kids, not everyone's close.

1183
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:29,640
We're not going to. Yeah, everyone's closed.

1184
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:30,960
Oh, yeah.

1185
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:33,600
That is a productive.

1186
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:37,200
But I mean, I'll get in and watch the third one.

1187
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:39,880
Getting through the closed scene is a real.

1188
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:42,480
Oh, my God. And the sparkly glasses.

1189
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:44,640
Love it. Love it. Your God.

1190
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:48,200
But it is it is one of those things where you're like this movie

1191
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:51,200
functions as a pretty solid end.

1192
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:54,440
Yeah. To what you could then consider the Terminator trilogy.

1193
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:57,080
You're like this has enough of a sense of accomplishment

1194
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:59,360
that this could be the last thing they do in this franchise.

1195
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:03,280
And I would feel like this is a proper canon in universe

1196
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:05,200
resolution to this narrative.

1197
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:08,200
I am fascinated then about like this new movie.

1198
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:12,560
Is James Cameron thinking of T2 3D in the canon?

1199
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:15,120
That is my hope. Oh, boy.

1200
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:17,440
Because he's because again, he says that this is like a bridge

1201
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:19,320
to a movie, but are his same ideas?

1202
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:21,320
Because obviously at the time he had ideas for a third movie.

1203
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:23,440
He said that. So are these his ideas?

1204
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:26,000
They must they must be said some level. Right.

1205
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:28,800
Because Terminator three killed Sarah Connor

1206
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:32,120
because Linda Hamilton didn't want to do it without her ex-husband.

1207
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:35,720
Right. Right. And then like salvation doesn't even deal with it.

1208
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:38,240
And then Genesis is like

1209
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:42,120
Amelia Clarke as time traveling Sarah Connor, ending up

1210
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:47,360
even though she's younger than she was in our present day.

1211
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,080
And so like he clearly wants to just make like the

1212
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:53,440
none of that shit ever happened.

1213
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:56,360
Here's just how Sarah Connor grew old movie,

1214
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:59,960
which feels like then he would have to sort of accept what happens

1215
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:04,040
in Battle Across Time, especially since he directed it. Yeah. Yeah.

1216
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:05,600
I think he knows it. Yeah.

1217
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:09,080
He'll he signed off on the designs of the mini hunters. Right.

1218
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:11,120
Yeah. It's fine. One million.

1219
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:13,320
The T1 million.

1220
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:15,440
So great. Still looks good.

1221
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:20,880
Like, I think that aesthetic of like it's the three D

1222
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:26,840
blob jacks like have aged so much better than like,

1223
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:32,040
you know, Disney's dinosaur of like it's three D CGI.

1224
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:33,400
But we're going to make it look like real life.

1225
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:37,360
The T1000 coming out of the screen when his head comes forward is just like.

1226
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:40,000
Right. And I remember that would always be the thing they'd put in,

1227
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,200
like the Universal Studios ads.

1228
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:44,760
The audience reacting to the thing, hitting them in the seats.

1229
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:46,040
And it was like, I can't go in that.

1230
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:48,080
I haven't seen these movies. It's too scary.

1231
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:50,760
It was like the dog on Honey. I shrunk the audience. Right.

1232
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:52,480
It was a dog or the T1000.

1233
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:54,400
Or the pie in Muppets. Yeah.

1234
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:59,200
Those moments are like used in every hotel video, every ad.

1235
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:01,400
And they're they're iconic to me from those.

1236
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:07,600
Do we think the T one million is in a new silly,

1237
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:12,120
like the idea that you would go from a thousand to a million? Yeah.

1238
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:13,080
And it also is.

1239
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:17,760
I mean, the problem is that he had one really good idea for a heighten,

1240
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:21,280
which is what if the guy's liquid and he can turn into anything?

1241
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:25,160
And they've never figured out how to improve on that. Yeah.

1242
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:27,880
Because then three, they go like, she's like both.

1243
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:31,240
She's got the skeleton and then liquid on top of it.

1244
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:35,000
And she's hot. What benefit does that provide?

1245
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:38,960
And then the T one million is just like, what if it was a big spider?

1246
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:42,280
And it's like, well, that just means it's more of the goo. Yeah.

1247
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:45,520
It doesn't feel like a different model. It just feels like a larger.

1248
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:48,440
I mean, not able to shift into human forms.

1249
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:49,960
It's actually missing a power. Right.

1250
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:53,480
Unless it can and we just don't see it and choose to just always

1251
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:55,800
spider walk around the place.

1252
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:57,760
It should turn into a giant dog. Yeah.

1253
00:58:57,760 --> 00:58:59,160
Come out of the audience.

1254
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:01,880
It would be great if it turned from a silver goose spider

1255
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:04,400
into like a giant eight legged freak spider.

1256
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:10,080
It's like I can just move laterally to like any like I can do octopus spider.

1257
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:12,120
Wild, wild west.

1258
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:16,520
Yes. Yeah. Will T one million be in dark fate?

1259
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:19,160
I hope. I mean, that would be great.

1260
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:24,720
If it were just squished like a bug beneath whatever the T 10 million is.

1261
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:28,280
Wait a second. Kevin Spacey cast as the T one million.

1262
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:32,440
Oh, he needs a comeback vehicle.

1263
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:34,840
Now is this voice, though?

1264
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:35,680
So it's OK.

1265
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:37,960
Yeah. Squish. Swipe.

1266
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:43,160
Rare miscalculation by the T 800 with that,

1267
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:46,840
you know, freezing it with liquid nitrogen. Good.

1268
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:49,480
Shooting the frozen T one million.

1269
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:52,120
Very bad. Kind of a miscalculation.

1270
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:56,320
But gives Universal a great reason to sprinkle the audience with water.

1271
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:57,680
That classic trick.

1272
00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:01,360
Well, especially because he's gone through that whole learning exercise already.

1273
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:05,160
Like T2 at the end is just like, OK, what temperature is going to end this guy?

1274
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:07,640
And he experiments with both.

1275
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:10,800
It's kind of a rookie mistake to just be like, well, and then shoot it, too.

1276
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:12,640
I don't know. Why not?

1277
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:14,080
Different system. I don't know.

1278
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:15,560
There's no way to know for sure.

1279
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:20,160
But I mean, that is like another moment where they have to hit those marks

1280
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:23,320
because you have to stand here because the prop gun,

1281
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:29,080
yeah, the lighting effects for the prop gun to match the laser shot on screen

1282
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:33,480
only works in these like handful of locations. Yes.

1283
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:36,280
The evolution of this thing, I also think is interesting

1284
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:39,000
because it was they wanted to do a stunt show.

1285
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:43,360
It was just supposed to replace the Conan the Barbarian, right?

1286
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:45,800
In a much smaller venue in Hollywood, right?

1287
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:49,200
Then the company that has developed it went, can we try to make it?

1288
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:53,680
Can we do a pitch for a 3D experiential show instead?

1289
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:55,760
They accepted that.

1290
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:58,120
Then they went to

1291
01:00:58,120 --> 01:01:01,960
Cameron, who, I guess, didn't have control of the rights.

1292
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:04,160
But they were trying to get his blessing.

1293
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:08,080
That's the other interesting thing about this is it isn't Terminator 3D.

1294
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:10,280
It's Terminator 2 3D.

1295
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:14,480
Like it's specifically an attraction based on the second movie

1296
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:18,160
and not the franchise, which I feel like is maybe one

1297
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:20,400
knock against keeping it there.

1298
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:25,000
Yeah, I sort of I feel like the tiny change of it being Terminator 3D. Right.

1299
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:26,360
But leaves it open ended.

1300
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:28,680
And now we're like it's a franchise that keeps coming back

1301
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:29,800
and it could still be relevant.

1302
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:32,560
And you have all these sequels that negate it also.

1303
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:36,600
Not that anyone likes any of them, but then to call it like T2 3D.

1304
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:37,520
Yeah. Yeah.

1305
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:40,120
Feels like they literally just should have changed the signage.

1306
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:40,720
Yeah, sure.

1307
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:42,720
Though I love I love T2 3D.

1308
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:43,920
Rules. Yeah.

1309
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:46,680
Well, not to pimp you into telling this idea, Mike,

1310
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:49,720
but this reminds me of an idea you have said before.

1311
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:52,200
Of Batman Returns 2.

1312
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:55,440
Yeah. We were talking about this a little bit before the show.

1313
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:58,040
But yeah, like just put a sequel.

1314
01:01:58,040 --> 01:01:58,840
I feel like you've said.

1315
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:00,720
I said Batman Forever 2. Yeah, as well.

1316
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:02,600
Like just why not?

1317
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:04,360
Yeah, they did it here.

1318
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:08,240
I do think as a kid, I was much more aware of T2

1319
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:10,200
because I didn't see these movies when I was a kid,

1320
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:12,560
but I was much more aware of T2 and Terminator 2.

1321
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:15,080
And I wasn't even sure that it was a sequel.

1322
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:16,200
I didn't see the first one.

1323
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:19,360
That was kind of the very little of the T2 thing.

1324
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:24,120
Is it like it made it sound like it was its own thing rather than Terminator 2?

1325
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:26,520
Yeah, I probably didn't think of it as a sequel.

1326
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:29,760
I probably just thought it was called Terminator 2 or T2.

1327
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:34,520
Like the film by eventual Terminator 3 director, Jonathan Masta,

1328
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:35,560
you five seven one.

1329
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:36,440
You just thought it was like a cool.

1330
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:38,200
I thought it was just a code.

1331
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:40,200
T2. What does that mean? Series of things.

1332
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:41,440
Yeah. Yeah, cool.

1333
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:45,040
But then the thing that's cool is like they they do their pitch

1334
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:48,200
to Cameron to try to win him over to get his blessing.

1335
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:52,720
And the pitch at the time apparently was that it was going to be new characters.

1336
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:58,400
Like it was a 3D, you know, movie show that was based around the idea of terminators.

1337
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:01,880
And they were going to create their entirely, you know, own mythology

1338
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:03,720
and character based for the show.

1339
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:07,000
And then he saw what they pitched and he was like, this is good.

1340
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:10,080
I'm impressed. I would like to take over this

1341
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:13,480
as long as Universal will pay to get the actors back.

1342
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:15,480
And yeah, let's do it.

1343
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:18,960
Like I want to make this an official continuation of the thing.

1344
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:22,800
He also apparently said, you know, I was driving over here thinking

1345
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:27,520
who the fuck is going to pitch me ideas on my thing.

1346
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:30,760
I was like getting ready to come in here and shoot it all down.

1347
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:32,440
But I think this is actually pretty good.

1348
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:34,760
I can make it better. Right, right, right, right.

1349
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:41,040
I mean, it does appeal to his like, what was the under sea movie?

1350
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:42,560
He made not the best.

1351
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:47,360
Yeah, like they make a big deal about the computer animation and that.

1352
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:52,440
Yeah. And so he was clearly like already like interested

1353
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:54,680
in like pushing the boundaries of technology.

1354
01:03:54,680 --> 01:03:58,920
So to be presented with at least the kernel of like it's 3D

1355
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:02,720
and there's a live show element and they work in conjunction.

1356
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,560
And you're going to get a ton of money to essentially experiment

1357
01:04:05,560 --> 01:04:08,120
with like new storytelling technology.

1358
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:11,760
Yeah, it's really interesting to me.

1359
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:15,120
And then what I think is so funny is that all the pre show stuff,

1360
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:18,640
like the movie is like this is like a proper Terminator film

1361
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:20,280
directed by James Cameron.

1362
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:23,560
And the pre show stuff feels like it's out of total recall.

1363
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:28,440
Like the character of the Cyberdyne employee is like so heightened

1364
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:31,640
to this like tour guide Barbie sort of like real.

1365
01:04:31,640 --> 01:04:33,680
The Jolver Hovany. Right, right.

1366
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:37,000
They even make a total recall joke when there's like the video

1367
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:41,120
showing the Cyberdyne technology, the selling Skynet.

1368
01:04:41,120 --> 01:04:44,440
They're like with Skynet, you'll be able to have total recall.

1369
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:46,640
It's students doing well on a test.

1370
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:48,360
Yeah, they will have total recall.

1371
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:53,600
And they show that Shaq can like always hit the Shaq cameo,

1372
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:55,400
which would get the laugh.

1373
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:58,120
It felt like you lose it with time a little, but the stereotype

1374
01:04:58,120 --> 01:05:00,040
that Shaq was bad at free throws.

1375
01:05:00,040 --> 01:05:04,040
Yeah, which they replaced later on with just a generic soccer player

1376
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:07,800
making a goal. They replaced it before Genesis came out.

1377
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:10,880
Like they replaced it when there was only a year left in the life of it.

1378
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:13,040
It was 2015, right? They did everything.

1379
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:17,800
Yeah. And they added someone holding an iPad like they got seated up a little.

1380
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:22,960
But even when I like I always just justified it is like, well, this ride

1381
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:27,440
takes place in 1995 or 1996, whatever it opened.

1382
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:29,760
Right. Especially with the Terminator franchise, we were like,

1383
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:32,800
it's all about time travels and alternate paths and things like that.

1384
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:36,600
But I just sort of like as a kid, not having any familiarity

1385
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:40,760
with the Terminator franchise, liking that it was like, oh, fuck.

1386
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:44,200
Like the idea is that this is a bad company and these people are bad.

1387
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:47,920
Like I like the person who's doing the pre show is coded as

1388
01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:50,280
we should not trust them.

1389
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:53,880
Someone's about to take advantage of us and is lying to our faces.

1390
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:57,440
I think it all I think the vibe of this, you're right, that it is to stay.

1391
01:05:57,440 --> 01:05:59,720
The pre show is distinctly verovony.

1392
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:02,240
And I also did not grow up having seen.

1393
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:06,840
I was a real latecomer to total recall and to Starship Troopers and a RoboCop.

1394
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,240
And I think I was maybe the instant

1395
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:14,320
instant familiarity and love I had for those movies, discovering them later.

1396
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:17,680
Probably maybe on some level was like, oh, it's kind of like T2, 3D.

1397
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:22,720
Not even just like with the that that satirical edge and the darkness

1398
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:25,440
that is even embedded in the the benign things.

1399
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:27,520
We still like it's still weird to me.

1400
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:31,720
But like but literally the styles like Kimberly Duncan in general

1401
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
kind of looks like Sharon Stone.

1402
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:37,160
Like she is she is a very 90s carat.

1403
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:39,560
What you said, Jason, that it's just set in 95.

1404
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:44,080
And don't update it like to 3D is in that in 90s future.

1405
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:48,680
Sure. And the creepiness of like, you know, that video is long.

1406
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:53,000
Then it gets interrupted by, you know, the Connors hacking the system

1407
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,640
who have footage from their own adventure.

1408
01:06:55,640 --> 01:06:58,920
Yes. Nicely shot footage going from the foot.

1409
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,680
Pragmatic quarter cutting.

1410
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:04,240
Fine, fine. We don't care.

1411
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:08,560
It usually make me mad, but they've like I've loved it all format wise

1412
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:12,680
so much up until that point, and that they do really sell the cutting in

1413
01:07:12,680 --> 01:07:16,840
and the sound going out and the like truly the first time you see it.

1414
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:19,240
You really think there is a problem with the AV.

1415
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:22,040
They sell it really is not like a fakey hammy

1416
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:26,080
shut off until then. Like, are we in? We're in.

1417
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:29,040
But I love that, too. It's all the corniness of it.

1418
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:33,960
But it does a great job of summing up those big set pieces of the movie.

1419
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:36,880
Like you worked for me not having seen either Terminator film.

1420
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:38,160
I was like, I get this story.

1421
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:40,360
I understand the universe, which I didn't know existed.

1422
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:43,600
Like, I didn't know there was this much mythology until five seconds ago.

1423
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:47,480
And I know enough to be able to engage with this movie emotionally. Sure.

1424
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:52,240
Yeah. Yeah. I love distilling all of the drama of the first two movies

1425
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:56,920
into the line, despite my reservations about this particular model.

1426
01:07:57,160 --> 01:08:00,400
Like, that's how that's how Sarah sums up her feelings about.

1427
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:03,280
He became a father figure to my son.

1428
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:06,080
But then I do like that.

1429
01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:09,640
I feel like for how many attractions there are that are based on, oh,

1430
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:15,400
the things going wrong, this and maybe great movie writer,

1431
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:20,720
the only two I can think of that like really asks a cast member to sell that.

1432
01:08:21,160 --> 01:08:22,800
It's not just the attraction doing that.

1433
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:25,720
Like someone has to perform because then when she like

1434
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:30,120
knocks them off the feed and is like, sorry for that little interruption anyway,

1435
01:08:30,120 --> 01:08:34,200
back to the like when she's on the phone and she has to get your attention

1436
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:36,800
with that over the narration still of the.

1437
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:40,920
You're asking us to do like, you know, some like some subtle comedic work

1438
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:42,560
of this, like, you know.

1439
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:45,880
And against you having just seen, you know,

1440
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:50,400
like the strong performances of the Hamilton and I've been for a long and Shaq. Yeah.

1441
01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:53,880
I do love the constant

1442
01:08:54,840 --> 01:08:58,800
3D movie at theme park safety goggles.

1443
01:08:58,840 --> 01:08:59,600
Yeah, sure.

1444
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:02,280
I just that whoever figured that out first, they were just like, well,

1445
01:09:02,280 --> 01:09:04,880
just that's it will never improve on that.

1446
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:08,520
And we just thought I would they start towards calls them flight glasses,

1447
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:11,280
I think, right? Like goggles or something. Yeah.

1448
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:13,040
And we have to be a bug here.

1449
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:16,440
They're like bug vision or something like so they always have to make up

1450
01:09:16,440 --> 01:09:18,760
a funny, funny little cute thing.

1451
01:09:18,840 --> 01:09:21,320
But this is a perfect that moment where you put them on

1452
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:24,880
right before this like firing squad registration is one of the perfect ways to do it.

1453
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:28,080
I also just like to not

1454
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:31,600
do a couple of things before moving out, moving from the pre show.

1455
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:34,280
I what you what you're saying about Kimberly Duncan.

1456
01:09:34,320 --> 01:09:37,680
Absolutely. I think it's a perfect theme park character.

1457
01:09:37,680 --> 01:09:42,000
Oh, perfect. In that, like individual performers can put their stamp on it,

1458
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:47,120
even though there's like the bra. It's like it's it's easily like replaceable.

1459
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:51,800
A lot of people can fit into that mold, but you can still make it your own within that.

1460
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:55,680
And, you know, there's a tricky thing, I think, in translating

1461
01:09:55,680 --> 01:09:59,320
this particular franchise to theme park world, which is it is so R rated.

1462
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:05,680
It's so violent. And Kimberly, I think your hostess is a perfect way to make it

1463
01:10:05,680 --> 01:10:07,120
like to get theme park comedy.

1464
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:08,640
That high comedy in there. Yeah.

1465
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:10,720
To set the top. It's super.

1466
01:10:10,720 --> 01:10:13,400
Kids love saying super.

1467
01:10:13,480 --> 01:10:16,240
And it lets you know she it's a perfect way to like

1468
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:19,400
offset the like she's just annoying.

1469
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:24,320
But then as it gets much more malicious, like, oh, the no, there's much more

1470
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:27,720
to the annoyingness. She's like such an evil corporate show.

1471
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:30,480
That sort of sense of like, why are we here?

1472
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:33,120
Like within the reality of the ride, why are we here?

1473
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:34,680
OK, it's like a showcase.

1474
01:10:34,680 --> 01:10:37,080
We're about to see a demonstration of a new product.

1475
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:40,200
The fact that she like cuts back after the video and it's like, huh?

1476
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:43,840
Anyway, so back to the presentation, you're like, cool, I get this.

1477
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:45,040
This character is like a villain.

1478
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:48,600
Like, this isn't someone just like telling me to turn off my camera.

1479
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:50,720
You know? Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

1480
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:56,800
And the way that you can't unsee the interruption, it's so funny when it cuts back

1481
01:10:57,080 --> 01:11:01,160
and you don't know like you don't know what darkness you missed while John and Sarah

1482
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:06,600
were talking and that they return you pretty quick to like a drone

1483
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:13,080
exploding a building to transitioning into a birthday candle being lit.

1484
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:17,560
A really funny crosscut as if they like if the interruption hadn't occurred,

1485
01:11:17,560 --> 01:11:19,480
they're thinking, all right, so now we got them.

1486
01:11:19,480 --> 01:11:22,520
Now we like fire turns into fire and people love fire.

1487
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:24,080
They love it on a birthday cake. Great.

1488
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:26,600
People will buy into this military technology. No problem.

1489
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:32,840
We did our jobs well in the I don't know if this is like a purposeful shot at Epcot,

1490
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:38,640
but the Terminator arms tucking in a child from the other side of the world.

1491
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:41,840
He's like a thing from Spatial Birth, right?

1492
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:45,960
Like a mom saying goodnight to his kid isn't in one version.

1493
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:47,520
I think it's from a screen, though, right?

1494
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:49,680
You don't have the robot arm like that.

1495
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:55,040
But it's like it's the same genre of like moms on an international business trip,

1496
01:11:55,040 --> 01:11:56,880
like she always does. Right.

1497
01:11:56,880 --> 01:12:00,200
And she's wishing her child good night.

1498
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:06,120
Yeah. In the pre show, there's a very creepy robot hand that like gently massages a child.

1499
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:09,720
It's very, very selling points like you'll never have to miss a bedtime.

1500
01:12:09,720 --> 01:12:11,120
You'll never miss a game.

1501
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:12,560
You'll never miss a sunset.

1502
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:16,520
The doctor performing the surgery on the beach.

1503
01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:18,280
Well, I think the sunset.

1504
01:12:18,280 --> 01:12:24,120
All that stuff like it was just like, like, oh, there's this like actual satire.

1505
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:29,560
Yeah. You know, like pretty pointed like satire at like, well, even a culture.

1506
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:34,640
You are going into the Miles Bennett Dyson, the guy who dies a gruesome death

1507
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:41,000
to stop a thing that he has inadvertently put into motion in T2

1508
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:48,160
that they this corporate monstrosity named it after, like whitewashed what happened

1509
01:12:48,160 --> 01:12:50,480
and in the auditorium after him.

1510
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:56,120
Right. Which is like he died trying to prevent that very thing.

1511
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:57,560
Yeah. Yeah. Wow.

1512
01:12:57,560 --> 01:13:00,120
I hate to compare it to a honey I shrunk the audience.

1513
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:04,600
But we were talking like on that episode about just like the setup is very poor.

1514
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:06,200
And like, what is this award?

1515
01:13:06,200 --> 01:13:07,000
It's everything.

1516
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,440
House on a day where there's an award show.

1517
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:10,840
Right. An open house.

1518
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:14,720
And like just seeing and going back through this ride and like in the video,

1519
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:18,000
even just the queue, it's like this thing sets this thing.

1520
01:13:18,040 --> 01:13:19,800
It's like there's so much set up.

1521
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:21,880
You're so primed and ready for this.

1522
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:22,640
You're in the world.

1523
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:25,600
You got the tone already in your head by the time you walk into the theater.

1524
01:13:25,960 --> 01:13:29,080
And honey, I shrunk the audience is just like throw you in there.

1525
01:13:29,440 --> 01:13:31,160
Let's throw some words at him.

1526
01:13:31,160 --> 01:13:32,480
Fine. He flies out at you.

1527
01:13:32,520 --> 01:13:37,080
Like this thing is so much work put into just like getting you in the spirit

1528
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:38,200
and the mood of it.

1529
01:13:38,200 --> 01:13:43,640
And it's crazy just seeing two similarly released around the same time.

1530
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:48,600
3D shows from movies, obviously Terminator of a bit higher quality than the honey.

1531
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:51,200
I think I think it's not just the franchise.

1532
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:55,840
Also, it's the involvement of Cameron and that you did have one strong person

1533
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:58,720
who like was the voice over the franchise at that point.

1534
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:02,160
Yeah. I think it's akin to

1535
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:05,960
back to the future for me in terms of like Exposition City.

1536
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:07,520
But I love it. Yeah.

1537
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:12,040
Give me you are making the exposition so from my favorite stuff

1538
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:16,440
and conveying all of these gigantic ideas, but trying to do it in a poppy way

1539
01:14:16,440 --> 01:14:18,600
that still has good performances.

1540
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:20,520
And it's so neat.

1541
01:14:20,720 --> 01:14:23,680
I like doing the kind of do these episodes where you're just like,

1542
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:26,040
we don't know, we're not shitting on on.

1543
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:27,520
We're just earnestly sure.

1544
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:30,200
Praising it's such a such a big question.

1545
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:33,360
Is Kimberly Duncan going to be in Dark Fate?

1546
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:36,040
Please. Yes, she should be.

1547
01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:37,240
Let's go to the miles.

1548
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:39,480
It's a one million. Yeah.

1549
01:14:39,480 --> 01:14:40,840
The Memorial Center.

1550
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:44,440
I hope like a dark fate has them like going to like,

1551
01:14:44,440 --> 01:14:47,720
I hear the remains of the Dyson Memorial Center.

1552
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:51,240
Like it's like Jurassic World when they find the banner

1553
01:14:51,880 --> 01:14:55,960
that like 30 minutes of the movie in the middle or just about T2, 3D.

1554
01:14:56,800 --> 01:14:59,600
I mean, I think there's meat on that bone.

1555
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:02,240
And I love that, like, all right.

1556
01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:03,520
So what do we need for in T2?

1557
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:05,640
What do we know about Cyberdyne?

1558
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:08,240
Like there's no like public facing arm of it, really.

1559
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:11,880
There's this scary office building like and it probably it just probably

1560
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:13,720
most people just haven't heard of Cyberdyne.

1561
01:15:13,720 --> 01:15:16,720
But you see Dyson and you see like security guards.

1562
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:20,200
It's not like the CEO of Cyberdyne is like a character.

1563
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:21,840
You're not seeing the people who are.

1564
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:23,480
Serenose. Right. Right.

1565
01:15:23,480 --> 01:15:25,520
Yes. This thing is this.

1566
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:27,880
This all precedes the world we're in now.

1567
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:30,880
We're supposed to think all of these tech CEOs are cool.

1568
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:34,760
Well, our and like we live in Los Angeles where just a couple of days ago,

1569
01:15:34,760 --> 01:15:39,400
our fucking mayor on his Twitter account was like the future of transit

1570
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:42,320
is now in partnership with Lyft.

1571
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:45,560
And it's like, motherfucker, make more buses and trains and shit.

1572
01:15:45,560 --> 01:15:47,920
What are you talking about? The future is with Lyft.

1573
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:49,720
And he had a whole like ad in front of him.

1574
01:15:49,720 --> 01:15:54,440
A whole giant pink Lyft background like this guy who barely spends any time

1575
01:15:54,440 --> 01:15:57,280
in the fucking city, bringing these shitty Olympics

1576
01:15:57,280 --> 01:15:58,400
that no one wants.

1577
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:01,920
No one wants it's interfering with the expansion of Universal Studios.

1578
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:05,920
As far as I'm concerned, they're going to have to build sets for and build

1579
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:08,560
like places for people to swim. Yeah.

1580
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:14,880
It is crazy, like watching this, just like how much Cameron

1581
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:18,600
hit the nail on the head with like just the basic DNA of the Terminator thing.

1582
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:21,640
Or even like how drone heavy this movie is.

1583
01:16:22,040 --> 01:16:25,440
And that whole like Cyberdyne, like selling the value of Skynet thing.

1584
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:27,920
I'm like, this is pretty similar to what everyone's doing right now,

1585
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:31,120
where it's like, I'll give up all my data if you can make it a little easier

1586
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:35,400
for me to do this, if I can FaceTime my kid rather than having to be there.

1587
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:36,480
You know, they explain.

1588
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:39,200
Yeah, they explain how like it's you know, how it just like

1589
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:41,040
it's just in your computer already.

1590
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:42,280
We do the work for you.

1591
01:16:42,280 --> 01:16:44,320
You just have to like consent.

1592
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:46,440
Like that's the whole thing. It's just like, just say yes.

1593
01:16:46,440 --> 01:16:48,280
Click. Right. Give us permission.

1594
01:16:48,280 --> 01:16:50,800
It is like that David Bowie clip where he's talking about the Internet.

1595
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:52,440
We've seen that. Oh, yeah.

1596
01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:55,160
He talks about content coming through the Internet.

1597
01:16:55,160 --> 01:16:57,160
Yeah, there's like a clip of him in like 99.

1598
01:16:57,160 --> 01:17:00,520
And he's doing an interview with somebody and he's talking about like the Internet

1599
01:17:00,520 --> 01:17:04,720
being like you guys who no one has any idea how crazy this is going to disrupt

1600
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:06,040
everyone. Our lives.

1601
01:17:06,040 --> 01:17:09,280
And the interview is like, but isn't it just an information delivery service?

1602
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:10,920
He's like, oh, no. Oh, no.

1603
01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:11,680
You have no clue.

1604
01:17:11,680 --> 01:17:14,080
You have no clue how this is going to change the world.

1605
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:15,320
And the guy's like, all right.

1606
01:17:15,320 --> 01:17:16,960
It's like David Bowie knows.

1607
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:18,880
Does he think it's good or bad?

1608
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:20,360
What he says both. Yeah.

1609
01:17:20,360 --> 01:17:21,600
He goes, it's going to be very good.

1610
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:23,280
And he goes, it's going to be very bad as well.

1611
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:26,920
There's a David Byrne quote from an interview from like 25 years ago

1612
01:17:26,920 --> 01:17:29,920
where he says, like, you know, I think in the future, like

1613
01:17:30,280 --> 01:17:34,480
the thing that everyone's going to prioritize is like ease of access.

1614
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:38,880
And our currency is going to be our personal information.

1615
01:17:39,160 --> 01:17:42,240
Like that's going to be what's valuable, our data.

1616
01:17:42,520 --> 01:17:46,000
And we're going to give that up in exchange for access.

1617
01:17:46,280 --> 01:17:47,760
And they were like, are you worried about this?

1618
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:49,720
He's like, I don't know. I mean, like life will be easier.

1619
01:17:49,720 --> 01:17:51,720
But that's the price we're going to pay is that everyone's going to know

1620
01:17:51,720 --> 01:17:53,040
everything about us.

1621
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:56,000
We're going to give that to the companies in order to get things faster.

1622
01:17:56,640 --> 01:17:59,600
He called on that. It's like it's so specific.

1623
01:17:59,680 --> 01:18:00,640
Fuck. Yeah.

1624
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:03,720
And there was that interview with Bob Seeger where he was talking about

1625
01:18:04,160 --> 01:18:07,120
PlayStation 4 and.

1626
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:10,280
He's like, Louie's almost going to make it to the five timers club.

1627
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:16,360
Is David Byrne the one who's always riding his bike in Manhattan?

1628
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:17,920
Yes. OK, great. Yes.

1629
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:21,120
I always see these pictures and I'm like, yeah, that's David Byrne.

1630
01:18:21,160 --> 01:18:22,960
Right. Yeah. Yeah. He's a big black man.

1631
01:18:23,080 --> 01:18:27,160
Yeah. So he's sticking to the past in terms of his transit.

1632
01:18:27,200 --> 01:18:28,440
Yes. Yes. Yes.

1633
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:29,440
We all should. Maybe.

1634
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:33,440
What else in the two quick other things in the TV show?

1635
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:34,520
Big laugh every time.

1636
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:37,840
Grandmother can choose between five thousand channels.

1637
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:41,320
And if she can't choose, the TV chooses it for a clip of murder.

1638
01:18:41,320 --> 01:18:42,920
She wrote. That's going to happen.

1639
01:18:42,920 --> 01:18:45,400
Solid. I think it might happen.

1640
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:50,680
I also want to say I don't want to overlook the the voice of Jim Cummings,

1641
01:18:50,680 --> 01:18:52,440
who is the narrator of this.

1642
01:18:52,440 --> 01:18:54,200
He comes up every once in a while.

1643
01:18:54,200 --> 01:18:58,440
Yeah, that's Jim Cummings who plays all of these scary people.

1644
01:18:58,440 --> 01:19:03,080
And for Disney, he's the voice of Pete and he's the singing voice of.

1645
01:19:03,240 --> 01:19:05,840
No, not Jeremy Irons is a lot of scar.

1646
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:09,200
But when it gets to be too high of notes, it becomes Jim Cummings.

1647
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:12,040
He's Darkwing Duck. He's Darkwing Duck.

1648
01:19:12,040 --> 01:19:15,800
He's I looked up these multiple characters on the original Tick cartoon.

1649
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:18,000
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

1650
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:19,480
I'm forgetting who he plays exactly,

1651
01:19:19,480 --> 01:19:22,400
but he's one of the guys who's in that rotation.

1652
01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:23,800
Yeah, that adds up.

1653
01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:26,360
And then also maybe maybe.

1654
01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:29,280
Yeah. But then he's Winnie the Pooh and he's Tigger.

1655
01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:32,440
But he like I also remember him narrate the same voice

1656
01:19:32,440 --> 01:19:35,400
narrated the MTV Movie Awards a lot of years.

1657
01:19:35,680 --> 01:19:39,040
Just the killer voice and like really, I don't know.

1658
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:43,360
You might think that just any like benign, scary narration might work

1659
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:46,000
in that pre-show and maybe it could.

1660
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:47,640
But I think it's an especially good one.

1661
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:51,280
I guess it's I don't know if you folks have seen Christopher Robin.

1662
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:55,760
Oh, I did. His performance in that is fucking five stars. Really?

1663
01:19:55,760 --> 01:19:58,040
And it's one of those things where like this guy's been doing poo

1664
01:19:58,040 --> 01:19:59,480
for like 25 years.

1665
01:19:59,480 --> 01:20:01,720
He's probably got his presets that come in.

1666
01:20:01,960 --> 01:20:04,720
We need to do a Honey Nut Cheerios commercial, you know?

1667
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:08,160
And it was like this guy clearly like read the material and was like, OK,

1668
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:10,400
this calls for a different type of poo.

1669
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:12,120
A very depressed, right?

1670
01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:15,960
But it's like it's like a very like heartfelt, like emotionally

1671
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:18,120
like sort of rounded performance.

1672
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:20,640
Well, and cool to give it to the person who's lived with it for a long time

1673
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:22,200
to like do their ultimate performance.

1674
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:24,600
Right. It's kind of like unforgiven. Yeah.

1675
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:27,360
Wow. It's not Ryan Reynolds.

1676
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:29,000
Right. Suddenly doing poo.

1677
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:30,800
Yeah. Detective poo.

1678
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:34,240
No, but that's like it speaks to the fact that like why have Jim Cummings do this?

1679
01:20:34,240 --> 01:20:35,800
And it's like because the dude's a good actor.

1680
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:38,360
Like, it's not just that he has like a lot of voices.

1681
01:20:39,040 --> 01:20:42,640
He's like very good at delivering things and matching the tone of whatever project.

1682
01:20:42,640 --> 01:20:46,160
Did you guys hear who was considered for the voice of Pikachu

1683
01:20:46,160 --> 01:20:48,400
in Detective Pikachu?

1684
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:50,720
I saw a long list.

1685
01:20:50,720 --> 01:20:52,400
Danny Devito was one of them.

1686
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:53,400
Oh, I saw that. Yeah.

1687
01:20:53,400 --> 01:20:55,040
I mean, that what it's just been.

1688
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:56,360
They they the life.

1689
01:20:56,360 --> 01:20:58,560
They cut it together.

1690
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:01,960
They like did that thing where they were like, we auditioned actors

1691
01:21:02,280 --> 01:21:06,440
by like picking clips from their live action films and animating Pikachu to them.

1692
01:21:06,920 --> 01:21:10,480
And I think they said that the Devito one was a little upsetting.

1693
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:12,480
It sounds great to me.

1694
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:15,360
There's a short video going around the Internet where I guess

1695
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:18,520
Danny Devito and Lil Xan were on the same plate.

1696
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:20,320
Oh, I saw that. Yeah.

1697
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:23,680
Lil Xan like turns his foe to Danny.

1698
01:21:24,040 --> 01:21:27,920
Danny Vito like leads it to frame and goes like Xanarchy, bitch.

1699
01:21:29,320 --> 01:21:30,200
It's so funny.

1700
01:21:30,200 --> 01:21:32,880
He's so game to play ball.

1701
01:21:33,680 --> 01:21:34,640
He just nails it.

1702
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:37,880
You can just hear tons of people just laughing in the background.

1703
01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:41,960
He is like 75 years old and like in out of his mind.

1704
01:21:41,960 --> 01:21:44,000
Having the time of his life. Yeah.

1705
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,200
Yeah. Put it back in the penguin suit.

1706
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:47,280
Put it back in.

1707
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:50,320
That guy has had such an incredible career.

1708
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:50,840
Incredible.

1709
01:21:50,840 --> 01:21:55,320
Yeah. Think about how specific he is and what insane range of stuff

1710
01:21:55,320 --> 01:21:56,600
that he's gotten to do.

1711
01:21:56,600 --> 01:21:59,120
Him and Christopher Lloyd are both on taxi.

1712
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:02,320
And then both of them just have an insane body of work. Right.

1713
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:04,960
That goes all over the place. Greatest films.

1714
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:07,120
The greatest films.

1715
01:22:07,160 --> 01:22:09,920
Obviously, Christopher Lloyd, even more variation maybe in his roles,

1716
01:22:09,920 --> 01:22:11,920
but just the two of them.

1717
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:15,040
But then even like I've been watching a lot of taxi recently and going like,

1718
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:19,200
Jeez, someone needs to give Christopher Lloyd a good role today.

1719
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:22,680
Of course. He looked through and he's like not worked much in the last 12 years.

1720
01:22:22,680 --> 01:22:27,040
And Davido is like having this huge fourth wind in his career.

1721
01:22:27,040 --> 01:22:27,840
Right.

1722
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:28,400
Yeah.

1723
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:31,880
Like the thing, the most recent thing I've seen Christopher Lloyd do is that Jimmy

1724
01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:35,840
Kimmel bit with Michael J. Fox.

1725
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:38,840
Yeah, he did. He did Stacked.

1726
01:22:38,840 --> 01:22:41,360
The Pamela Anderson.

1727
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:42,320
That's what I'm saying.

1728
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:44,280
That was like his last like prominent.

1729
01:22:44,280 --> 01:22:46,920
No, Stacked. It's all from Stacked.

1730
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:48,120
Yeah. Yeah.

1731
01:22:48,120 --> 01:22:49,840
He's in Fly Me to the Moon.

1732
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:51,440
Remember, flying in the moon.

1733
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:52,960
OK. Yeah.

1734
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:56,600
I'm looking about the flies that go to the firemen.

1735
01:22:56,600 --> 01:22:58,280
Yeah. Another great 3D film.

1736
01:22:58,280 --> 01:22:59,680
Yeah. Something.

1737
01:22:59,680 --> 01:23:04,080
OK. I feel like now we are moving from the pre show into the main.

1738
01:23:04,240 --> 01:23:05,800
The actual.

1739
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:06,480
Auditorium.

1740
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:10,640
And OK, so you're watching this propaganda video.

1741
01:23:10,640 --> 01:23:13,440
John and Sarah Connor interrupt it and tell you, by the way, also very scary

1742
01:23:13,440 --> 01:23:15,560
when they say you have five minutes to get out of the.

1743
01:23:15,560 --> 01:23:17,120
It's not just generally get out.

1744
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:18,360
They give you a time.

1745
01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:19,600
That's super scary.

1746
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:21,400
But you return to the main video.

1747
01:23:21,400 --> 01:23:25,680
You've been watching all this frothy propaganda that's gotten more dark as it goes.

1748
01:23:25,680 --> 01:23:32,400
Then you're introduced to these like killer warrior robots who are not really named.

1749
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:36,720
You don't find out about them, but you zoom into their eyes, gets a little scary.

1750
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:39,720
You go into the auditorium and that's apparently what you're there for,

1751
01:23:39,720 --> 01:23:42,080
is for a weapons demonstration.

1752
01:23:42,080 --> 01:23:44,080
And they're the T 70s.

1753
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:48,360
Yes, they're supposed to be the model like right before the Arnold model.

1754
01:23:48,360 --> 01:23:51,120
And apparently that was a camera.

1755
01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:54,640
No, the Universal wanted it to be a bunch of Arnold's.

1756
01:23:54,640 --> 01:23:58,560
Yeah. And he said, well, where are we on the timeline?

1757
01:23:58,560 --> 01:24:01,120
Because Arnold is from twenty twenty nine.

1758
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:02,760
And we are right. We are in what?

1759
01:24:02,760 --> 01:24:04,080
Ninety six right now.

1760
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:06,200
We have to be a couple of generations. Right.

1761
01:24:06,200 --> 01:24:10,280
Cool. That's the thing you don't get unless it's the literal man

1762
01:24:10,640 --> 01:24:12,880
doing behind the franchise.

1763
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:17,600
One of the most exacting, demanding monsters in filmmaking history.

1764
01:24:18,040 --> 01:24:19,160
It pays off here.

1765
01:24:19,160 --> 01:24:20,720
It does. You can't argue.

1766
01:24:20,720 --> 01:24:21,880
You can tell when he was.

1767
01:24:21,880 --> 01:24:24,240
Everywhere. That's the problem.

1768
01:24:24,240 --> 01:24:28,400
Kevin, people throw lights into the water on the Titanic and the movie comes out perfect.

1769
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:31,360
But they're also I mean, the problem is like, you know,

1770
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:36,120
I feel like we've all heard stories about people who are that demanding assholes.

1771
01:24:36,120 --> 01:24:39,760
And then you see the thing they made and you're like all for that. Right.

1772
01:24:39,880 --> 01:24:41,080
More often than not.

1773
01:24:41,080 --> 01:24:44,320
And James Cameron, every time you're like, this sounds like a dumb idea.

1774
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:46,640
I don't accept this behavior.

1775
01:24:46,840 --> 01:24:47,760
Where does he get off?

1776
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:49,680
And then you watch it and you're like, son of a bitch.

1777
01:24:49,680 --> 01:24:52,480
And it's the great at the highest grossing film of all time.

1778
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:53,400
All the time. Yeah.

1779
01:24:53,400 --> 01:24:54,280
No matter what it is.

1780
01:24:54,280 --> 01:24:55,920
And he'll do it again. Seemingly.

1781
01:24:55,920 --> 01:24:59,440
It is crazy that four separate times in the last 20 years,

1782
01:24:59,440 --> 01:25:02,800
he has made the highest budgeted film of all time.

1783
01:25:03,240 --> 01:25:07,880
Like he's the guy who keeps on setting the new bar of like what was the T2

1784
01:25:07,880 --> 01:25:10,600
was then supplanted by true lies, true lies.

1785
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:12,280
Some more than T2.

1786
01:25:12,280 --> 01:25:14,520
Is that good? Is true lies good? Yes.

1787
01:25:15,200 --> 01:25:16,640
I don't think I haven't seen it.

1788
01:25:16,640 --> 01:25:19,600
I think it's really I'm pro. I like it.

1789
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:23,640
I think it's a weird movie about the fear of getting cocked.

1790
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:26,560
I think it's a real cop thriller.

1791
01:25:26,840 --> 01:25:27,960
I haven't thought of it that way.

1792
01:25:27,960 --> 01:25:29,440
Yeah. Maybe I like it more.

1793
01:25:29,440 --> 01:25:31,560
I download it right now.

1794
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:35,000
Oh, but Jason's in.

1795
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:36,120
Fear Jason.

1796
01:25:36,120 --> 01:25:37,960
That's like fun.

1797
01:25:39,280 --> 01:25:43,960
It's also when he does that, it's not like it's not the same franchise either.

1798
01:25:43,960 --> 01:25:45,720
It's not like George Lucas. OK, Phantom Menace.

1799
01:25:45,720 --> 01:25:47,760
Of course, people were so rabid for it.

1800
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:49,080
And it's got all that built in.

1801
01:25:49,080 --> 01:25:51,320
It's do new stuff every time.

1802
01:25:51,320 --> 01:25:54,320
It would make sense if coming off Terminator two, he was like, cool,

1803
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:56,520
I want more for Terminator three.

1804
01:25:56,520 --> 01:26:00,200
Yeah, right. He's like, I want more to do another Arnold Schwarzenegger movie.

1805
01:26:00,200 --> 01:26:02,360
With Tom Arnold comedy. Right.

1806
01:26:02,360 --> 01:26:05,080
We're built, Paxton's trying to cook.

1807
01:26:05,080 --> 01:26:07,400
Those are Tom Arnold, Bill Paxton, both really funny.

1808
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:08,440
Yeah. Yeah.

1809
01:26:08,440 --> 01:26:10,240
And Jamie Curtis.

1810
01:26:10,240 --> 01:26:12,760
Jamie Curtis rules in it. Yeah, absolutely.

1811
01:26:13,680 --> 01:26:17,600
It's like a remake of a French farce that like wasn't an action movie.

1812
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:20,760
Oh, he like took like a French comedy and was like,

1813
01:26:20,760 --> 01:26:23,840
can I make this one hundred and fifty million dollar action film?

1814
01:26:24,200 --> 01:26:27,120
He's been talking about the sequel for that at a certain point, too.

1815
01:26:27,120 --> 01:26:30,000
I don't think he's been said in years, but Tom Arnold kept on saying

1816
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:34,080
they were really close to doing it and that it got killed by 9-11.

1817
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:38,400
He Tom Arnold also on Howard Stern said that Sarah Huckabee Sanders had a glass eye.

1818
01:26:40,440 --> 01:26:42,480
And they kept going like, wait, what she does.

1819
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:45,600
And then he's they're like, oh, it's no, she doesn't.

1820
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:48,320
And he's like, oh, I must have misheard, I guess.

1821
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:52,120
So he'll let these things go and have challenged even slightly.

1822
01:26:52,120 --> 01:26:54,120
Yeah. He's like, oh, I must have misheard.

1823
01:26:54,120 --> 01:26:57,320
Or like it was like 10 minutes of him going, yeah, she's got a glass eye.

1824
01:26:57,720 --> 01:27:00,080
You didn't know that. She got a glass eye.

1825
01:27:00,080 --> 01:27:02,800
Maybe we shouldn't have accepted Tom Arnold being the Woodward

1826
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:05,120
and Bernstein of the Trump administration.

1827
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:10,880
It's weird. Yeah, he was married to Roseanne for a little while there.

1828
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:12,880
Maybe they had some things in common.

1829
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:15,760
Yeah, both shot off a little too quickly.

1830
01:27:16,040 --> 01:27:18,160
Wildly different paths.

1831
01:27:18,160 --> 01:27:21,240
Very different people now.

1832
01:27:21,240 --> 01:27:24,200
I think True Lies is a wonderfully shot film.

1833
01:27:24,200 --> 01:27:27,120
That's one of the things about it that it's yeah.

1834
01:27:27,720 --> 01:27:29,880
I like I don't know what the French farce looked like,

1835
01:27:29,880 --> 01:27:33,200
but to like take a smaller story and shoot on that scale.

1836
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:38,200
Incredible. The DP Russell Carpenter, who shot this as well, T2, 3D.

1837
01:27:38,360 --> 01:27:42,320
He began he became James Cameron's primary DP,

1838
01:27:42,320 --> 01:27:46,240
having shot Titanic Avatar two and three, supposedly.

1839
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:51,960
If the seed one, the seed bearer, the seed avatar rise to rise to the seed bearer.

1840
01:27:53,320 --> 01:27:55,040
Ant Man, he shot as well.

1841
01:27:55,040 --> 01:27:57,280
And before all of this, Lawnmower Man.

1842
01:27:57,280 --> 01:27:59,520
Oh, that's a good, that's a good pedigree.

1843
01:27:59,880 --> 01:28:04,800
It does feel like you watch this, the, you know, core film itself

1844
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:06,600
in the middle of the attraction.

1845
01:28:06,600 --> 01:28:10,600
And you're like, this feels so much more sophisticated

1846
01:28:10,920 --> 01:28:15,840
than most theme park movies because this is not a theme park director.

1847
01:28:16,080 --> 01:28:19,560
And there's just like not even just this, the technology,

1848
01:28:19,800 --> 01:28:24,760
but like the editing rhythms and like the shot blocking.

1849
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:28,240
Like he has like the same kind of like

1850
01:28:29,160 --> 01:28:32,600
the way he builds the action moments or the jokes.

1851
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:36,680
Feels like a movie and not a theme park attraction.

1852
01:28:36,720 --> 01:28:38,160
You know? Yeah.

1853
01:28:38,160 --> 01:28:41,480
I mean, it's like the the the stuff that's like pointed out at the audience,

1854
01:28:41,480 --> 01:28:43,480
a little gimmicky because it has to be right.

1855
01:28:43,480 --> 01:28:47,480
But all of a sudden it just cuts to a perfectly cool looking James Cameron movie.

1856
01:28:47,480 --> 01:28:50,600
Right. And like if you just saw that scene, you'd be like, oh, is this from the

1857
01:28:50,760 --> 01:28:52,120
this must be from one of the movies, right?

1858
01:28:52,120 --> 01:28:55,480
Yeah. Like because you know what a theme park 3D movie looks like.

1859
01:28:55,480 --> 01:28:56,200
It doesn't look like that.

1860
01:28:56,200 --> 01:29:00,880
Yeah. When they get inside of Skynet, that becomes much more of like a theme park.

1861
01:29:00,880 --> 01:29:03,120
Right. But it has to be presentational.

1862
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:08,960
And I think like universal creative may have had more

1863
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:11,360
shooting that than Cameron.

1864
01:29:11,360 --> 01:29:14,680
Well, suppose what I looked up, I think this is this book.

1865
01:29:14,680 --> 01:29:18,240
I keep consulting Disney versus Universal by Sam Ganaway.

1866
01:29:18,240 --> 01:29:21,280
Ganaway. Yeah. I want to get it right.

1867
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:27,560
According to that, James Cameron directed the movie until the parking garage.

1868
01:29:27,800 --> 01:29:31,520
OK. At some point in the parking garage, perhaps when the mini hunters

1869
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:37,000
start flying around and that's that's more of a CG in your face kind of show.

1870
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,200
That becomes more Stan Winston.

1871
01:29:39,200 --> 01:29:43,440
And then and then the visual effects artist John Bruno takes over entirely

1872
01:29:43,440 --> 01:29:45,320
when we go inside Skynet.

1873
01:29:45,320 --> 01:29:50,480
But that main sort of like a future war motorcycle chase

1874
01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:54,880
just feels like fucking a classic James Cameron action set piece.

1875
01:29:54,880 --> 01:29:59,960
Full on. And you it's hard to say what's better.

1876
01:29:59,960 --> 01:30:04,840
Is it the motorcycle driving away from the gigantic explode?

1877
01:30:04,840 --> 01:30:07,360
What a fucking crazy explosion.

1878
01:30:08,440 --> 01:30:11,840
Or is it just like there's a there's a moment of Edward Furlong

1879
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:16,920
like getting out from behind like a pylon and the dust is so crisp.

1880
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:21,280
Yeah. And it just it like blows away in that cool, like very

1881
01:30:21,560 --> 01:30:24,000
accounted for James Cameron slow motion.

1882
01:30:24,160 --> 01:30:28,840
And it's all got that that awesome blue patina that I swear is like half

1883
01:30:28,840 --> 01:30:32,200
the reason I didn't like T3, not this, but Terminator 3.

1884
01:30:32,200 --> 01:30:33,360
It sure doesn't have it. It's not blue.

1885
01:30:33,360 --> 01:30:34,880
Just make it blue and all.

1886
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:38,600
Why would they change it to know it's it's shot in the same way they'd shoot?

1887
01:30:38,600 --> 01:30:40,280
Like shallow howl.

1888
01:30:40,280 --> 01:30:42,280
There's just no aesthetic choice.

1889
01:30:42,280 --> 01:30:44,520
Just like early 2000s, nothing.

1890
01:30:44,640 --> 01:30:50,200
This does. You know, you were talking about what you view as the comedic

1891
01:30:50,200 --> 01:30:55,200
missteps of Terminator 3, what I view as several of the greatest jokes of all time.

1892
01:30:56,440 --> 01:30:57,720
Such as talk to the hand.

1893
01:30:57,720 --> 01:31:01,800
This does have in a franchise that as it's gone on and become cumbersome,

1894
01:31:01,960 --> 01:31:04,440
has very questionable approaches to comedy.

1895
01:31:04,600 --> 01:31:08,560
I think the weirdest joke in terms of the inner logic of the universe

1896
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:12,920
of any of the Terminator movies, which is he was my college roommate.

1897
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:17,080
What's the let's explain this from the get go or from the ground up.

1898
01:31:17,080 --> 01:31:20,040
It's a he's fighting.

1899
01:31:20,640 --> 01:31:22,560
It's the it's the skeleton.

1900
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:24,560
The endoskeleton, the endoskeleton,

1901
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:28,520
not with the skin blasts him.

1902
01:31:28,680 --> 01:31:32,640
Probably the weirdest effect in the movie is the like hit

1903
01:31:32,640 --> 01:31:36,720
the perspective of his head shooting up, staring at you for a second

1904
01:31:36,720 --> 01:31:37,960
and then falling back down.

1905
01:31:37,960 --> 01:31:39,360
Probably the cheapest thing.

1906
01:31:39,360 --> 01:31:40,080
Yeah, that's the cheapest.

1907
01:31:40,080 --> 01:31:41,440
So in every Universal ad.

1908
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:43,200
So I'm fond of it for the dream.

1909
01:31:43,200 --> 01:31:48,640
You also have Arnold using a shotgun to home run.

1910
01:31:48,920 --> 01:31:50,320
Yes, drone.

1911
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:52,080
I also into the audience.

1912
01:31:52,400 --> 01:31:56,400
Exclusive to these Terminator movies is I

1913
01:31:56,840 --> 01:32:01,520
I apparently shows up in the original True Grit with John Wayne cocking

1914
01:32:01,840 --> 01:32:07,360
a shotgun like that, doing the twirl, which if you're wondering,

1915
01:32:07,520 --> 01:32:11,160
are there gun weirdos on YouTube who will teach you how to do that?

1916
01:32:11,160 --> 01:32:12,480
Yes, there are.

1917
01:32:12,480 --> 01:32:15,920
And what it is is you use your your ring finger

1918
01:32:15,920 --> 01:32:20,880
and your pinky finger to spin it around and then you catch it.

1919
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:22,400
You essentially catch your gun.

1920
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:22,800
Wow.

1921
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:23,640
That's one hand.

1922
01:32:23,640 --> 01:32:27,800
And that is but it's something I associate so strongly with T2.

1923
01:32:27,920 --> 01:32:29,840
Sure. Yeah, yeah.

1924
01:32:29,840 --> 01:32:30,800
It looks cool as hell.

1925
01:32:30,800 --> 01:32:36,680
But yeah. So then he yeah, he blows up his his double essentially.

1926
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:41,440
And then and then friend of yours, he was my college roommate.

1927
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,440
So and he's joking apart, right?

1928
01:32:45,640 --> 01:32:47,200
Yeah, you think it's a joke.

1929
01:32:47,200 --> 01:32:48,320
Yeah, maybe it's a joke.

1930
01:32:48,320 --> 01:32:51,960
But then even that reality is very strange because you go in Terminator 2.

1931
01:32:52,360 --> 01:32:56,680
John Connors has spent so much time explaining lingo to him and things.

1932
01:32:56,920 --> 01:32:59,400
But he's picked it up now because this is after T2.

1933
01:32:59,400 --> 01:33:01,680
That's a pretty sophisticated joke, though.

1934
01:33:01,680 --> 01:33:02,800
I mean, that's true.

1935
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:07,240
He has to really like there's nuance to sort of like the inner logic

1936
01:33:07,240 --> 01:33:11,520
of what he's setting up comedically when once like John Connors teaches him stuff.

1937
01:33:11,520 --> 01:33:15,520
He knows how to apply it, but he tends to just repeat the same couple of.

1938
01:33:15,560 --> 01:33:17,280
OK, a thumbs up, I know.

1939
01:33:17,280 --> 01:33:18,760
That's in my vocabulary.

1940
01:33:18,760 --> 01:33:19,600
Talk to the hand.

1941
01:33:19,600 --> 01:33:20,520
He just towards it.

1942
01:33:20,520 --> 01:33:22,120
And he says it obviously.

1943
01:33:22,120 --> 01:33:26,400
So you're you're suggesting that he's either had a major firmware

1944
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:29,480
upgrade where now he can like do punch up.

1945
01:33:30,520 --> 01:33:32,840
He's got like a VLANCH patch

1946
01:33:33,200 --> 01:33:36,360
that allows him to like work up little bon mots.

1947
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:41,040
Hamilton constantly taking his computer chip out of his skull.

1948
01:33:41,040 --> 01:33:42,120
Yes, he too.

1949
01:33:42,120 --> 01:33:43,720
That was some of the conducting stuff.

1950
01:33:43,720 --> 01:33:47,240
I was like, yeah, oh, this isn't in the montages from the Universal Ride.

1951
01:33:47,240 --> 01:33:49,880
The removing the chip from the skull. Right.

1952
01:33:49,920 --> 01:33:53,400
So at one point, it got inserted into something with the lowel Gans,

1953
01:33:53,400 --> 01:33:56,680
Babel, Mandela, Balger. Yeah.

1954
01:33:56,680 --> 01:34:01,920
Because it is like you go either, you know, less likely is

1955
01:34:02,640 --> 01:34:06,880
the implication is truly in this world when they build a humanoid robot,

1956
01:34:07,040 --> 01:34:11,160
they make them go through the trials of actual humanity

1957
01:34:11,360 --> 01:34:14,600
before they can retire to having a career as a cyber killer.

1958
01:34:14,840 --> 01:34:18,400
They must attend university and learn how to be a man.

1959
01:34:18,440 --> 01:34:21,360
Are you going to the welcome barbecue on the quad?

1960
01:34:21,360 --> 01:34:23,920
Right. Seems kind of lame, but I do have to eat.

1961
01:34:24,160 --> 01:34:26,640
I'd be a functional member of society.

1962
01:34:26,640 --> 01:34:27,920
You have to network.

1963
01:34:27,920 --> 01:34:32,800
The dining halls are closed because all the food workers are at the quad barbecue.

1964
01:34:32,800 --> 01:34:34,800
So I guess I'll go down there.

1965
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:37,920
But what I find fascinating is that the alternate implication is

1966
01:34:38,240 --> 01:34:41,760
Arnold understands how absurd that idea would be

1967
01:34:42,320 --> 01:34:45,840
that he makes the joke because he gets how weird it would be

1968
01:34:46,080 --> 01:34:49,840
for robots to have to go to college, which feels like the kind of joke

1969
01:34:49,840 --> 01:34:52,040
he wouldn't know how to make. Yeah.

1970
01:34:52,520 --> 01:34:53,640
All right. How about this?

1971
01:34:53,640 --> 01:34:55,400
Maybe this is actually what you're saying.

1972
01:34:55,400 --> 01:34:59,880
What if whatever the version of their colleges they go through,

1973
01:34:59,880 --> 01:35:01,840
they have all go in a class together.

1974
01:35:01,840 --> 01:35:03,120
It's a calibration.

1975
01:35:03,120 --> 01:35:04,720
They also be tested at the same time. Right.

1976
01:35:04,720 --> 01:35:08,040
But Arnold knows it would be too long and a boring explanation.

1977
01:35:08,080 --> 01:35:09,320
So he just makes it.

1978
01:35:09,320 --> 01:35:11,400
What's the what's the version of that for this?

1979
01:35:11,400 --> 01:35:13,160
Great. College. College.

1980
01:35:13,160 --> 01:35:14,280
The shorthand. Yeah.

1981
01:35:14,280 --> 01:35:16,560
Short hands. It's it's college.

1982
01:35:16,560 --> 01:35:18,520
And then like it's like a joke, but also it's true.

1983
01:35:18,520 --> 01:35:21,760
They did do some sort of training or they did some sort of testing together.

1984
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:24,160
Yeah. Well, I mean, look, you can break apart.

1985
01:35:24,200 --> 01:35:26,640
You do a full episode just on that.

1986
01:35:26,640 --> 01:35:27,720
We will.

1987
01:35:27,720 --> 01:35:28,800
So it's still doing it.

1988
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:30,240
It always gets a laugh.

1989
01:35:30,240 --> 01:35:32,320
I'll say that joke always got a laugh.

1990
01:35:32,320 --> 01:35:35,560
But my favorite thing was when they're on the motorcycle

1991
01:35:35,560 --> 01:35:37,520
and they're being chased by the hunter killer.

1992
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:41,280
And John Connor keeps going to go left, go right, go left.

1993
01:35:41,280 --> 01:35:44,760
And Arnold says, John, please stop helping.

1994
01:35:44,760 --> 01:35:48,760
Like, I think that's a great line that always got a laugh to.

1995
01:35:48,760 --> 01:35:50,440
That's the dynamic. Yeah.

1996
01:35:50,440 --> 01:35:51,680
That sums it up. That's the thing.

1997
01:35:51,680 --> 01:35:53,640
He's usually kind of straight man.

1998
01:35:53,640 --> 01:35:57,680
You're right. So I don't well, when we have James Cameron on the show,

1999
01:35:57,680 --> 01:36:01,400
also we'll ask him because now it's only exclusively about

2000
01:36:01,640 --> 01:36:02,960
about the theme park rides.

2001
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:04,000
No, no, no, no.

2002
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:05,320
Oh, just about the line.

2003
01:36:05,320 --> 01:36:07,000
All right. All right.

2004
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:08,120
All right. Yeah. OK, that's true.

2005
01:36:08,120 --> 01:36:12,400
We have to have him on at least one for that and then one for each line

2006
01:36:12,400 --> 01:36:13,600
and all of his rides, I guess.

2007
01:36:13,600 --> 01:36:14,920
It would be cool.

2008
01:36:14,920 --> 01:36:17,880
You know, if Disney doesn't want to work Terminator into the parks,

2009
01:36:17,880 --> 01:36:22,320
if they let him make an attraction like this for the world of Pandora.

2010
01:36:23,440 --> 01:36:26,760
Oh, I just think this is such an interesting format.

2011
01:36:26,800 --> 01:36:29,560
Right. Stunt show meets film.

2012
01:36:29,560 --> 01:36:33,640
Yeah. And to get a little original James Cameron short film.

2013
01:36:33,920 --> 01:36:35,920
Yeah. I mean, I hopefully have to.

2014
01:36:35,920 --> 01:36:39,040
I mean, the second the seed, whatever the seed bearer is going to be

2015
01:36:39,040 --> 01:36:40,120
a monster hit.

2016
01:36:40,120 --> 01:36:42,680
But I think if as long as we know it's going to be that

2017
01:36:42,680 --> 01:36:45,560
and it's going to for sure deliver, then we will get more.

2018
01:36:45,560 --> 01:36:50,240
So maybe at that point, because maybe the way of water or Tolkien

2019
01:36:50,240 --> 01:36:54,840
writer or the quest for a war, maybe one of those were those.

2020
01:36:54,880 --> 01:36:58,480
I'm worried it's not going to really hit its stride until Quest for a war.

2021
01:36:58,480 --> 01:37:02,040
It feels like last one. I think cruising altitude quest.

2022
01:37:02,040 --> 01:37:06,800
That sounds like a title that regular audiences are psyched on.

2023
01:37:07,320 --> 01:37:09,160
E Y W a.

2024
01:37:09,160 --> 01:37:10,840
You guys going to quest for a war?

2025
01:37:10,840 --> 01:37:13,320
Yeah, I'm going to see quest for a war.

2026
01:37:13,320 --> 01:37:15,640
Do you want to go to Buffalo Wild Wings after?

2027
01:37:15,640 --> 01:37:16,760
Yeah, I want to go to Buffalo.

2028
01:37:16,760 --> 01:37:19,120
I was doing Wednesday, bro. Nice.

2029
01:37:19,480 --> 01:37:21,880
Have you seen QFQF?

2030
01:37:21,880 --> 01:37:23,520
E. It's not even a nice.

2031
01:37:23,520 --> 01:37:25,560
A V. A. Q. F.

2032
01:37:25,560 --> 01:37:27,760
B. A. Five Q.

2033
01:37:28,040 --> 01:37:31,760
But maybe Terminator is in that one, the quest for coffee.

2034
01:37:31,760 --> 01:37:34,200
And that's like a whole thing like that secret.

2035
01:37:34,280 --> 01:37:38,560
The rumor when he was working on the sequels that Arnold was going to be the villain.

2036
01:37:38,680 --> 01:37:39,240
Oh, yeah, I remember that.

2037
01:37:39,240 --> 01:37:42,560
And then they announced it's like, no, it's Stephen Lang is back as like

2038
01:37:42,560 --> 01:37:44,480
the cyborg version of his character.

2039
01:37:44,480 --> 01:37:46,160
Oh, that's why he's back.

2040
01:37:46,160 --> 01:37:47,240
That's my guess.

2041
01:37:47,240 --> 01:37:48,640
They haven't officially said that.

2042
01:37:48,640 --> 01:37:51,000
Well, but so Courtney Weber's back as a different character, too.

2043
01:37:51,280 --> 01:37:55,560
But they said that they in the announcement said it is like Colonel

2044
01:37:55,560 --> 01:37:57,680
Corwish or whatever his name is.

2045
01:37:57,680 --> 01:38:00,320
He's back as the Darth Vader of the franchise.

2046
01:38:00,640 --> 01:38:02,280
Boy, that's this that people

2047
01:38:02,280 --> 01:38:05,440
it's much commented on that nobody can name characters from Avatar.

2048
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:10,360
But Colonel Corwish, I think I might be within five letters of getting that name.

2049
01:38:10,360 --> 01:38:12,520
Correct. Close than anyone else has ever gotten.

2050
01:38:12,520 --> 01:38:14,520
So I had to have to do.

2051
01:38:14,520 --> 01:38:18,840
It seems like James Cameron's bringing back an old I Love Lucy, old TV thing

2052
01:38:18,840 --> 01:38:20,960
where you would recap, you would just have the same actor come in

2053
01:38:20,960 --> 01:38:23,480
and play a different character a couple of episodes later.

2054
01:38:23,680 --> 01:38:25,080
Yeah. Frank Nelson come on.

2055
01:38:25,080 --> 01:38:28,880
And he was a department store employee or he was working at the deli or something.

2056
01:38:28,880 --> 01:38:31,960
I think he's just passing for an actor to get work.

2057
01:38:31,960 --> 01:38:33,080
Are you kidding? We'll do that.

2058
01:38:33,080 --> 01:38:35,080
We're going to be a perp and then there'll be a judge.

2059
01:38:35,080 --> 01:38:36,880
Sure. By the way, I just want to pull out.

2060
01:38:36,880 --> 01:38:42,920
I think Norm Spellman is the name of the tall lanky friend.

2061
01:38:42,920 --> 01:38:47,200
And I believe Trudy Talcone is the Michelle Rodriguez.

2062
01:38:47,200 --> 01:38:50,640
Once again, I think I'm within five letters of getting these names right.

2063
01:38:50,640 --> 01:38:51,600
That's pretty good.

2064
01:38:51,600 --> 01:38:56,120
The one I really want in the quest for AWA, though, is Sergeant Candy.

2065
01:38:56,120 --> 01:38:57,120
Sergeant Candy.

2066
01:38:57,120 --> 01:38:58,120
I'm still sorry.

2067
01:38:58,120 --> 01:38:59,120
Candy rolls around.

2068
01:38:59,120 --> 01:39:01,080
If Arnold's the villain, Dr.

2069
01:39:01,080 --> 01:39:04,560
Grace Augustine, I know you've learned a lot of the Navi language.

2070
01:39:04,560 --> 01:39:07,480
I for some reason remember all the human character names.

2071
01:39:07,680 --> 01:39:08,680
Yeah. All right.

2072
01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:11,480
Dr. Grace Augustine is right.

2073
01:39:11,480 --> 01:39:13,320
OK. Wow.

2074
01:39:13,640 --> 01:39:16,040
Michelle Rodriguez is Trudy something.

2075
01:39:16,040 --> 01:39:17,760
Trudy Chacon.

2076
01:39:17,760 --> 01:39:20,320
Chacon. I said Talcone within five letters.

2077
01:39:20,320 --> 01:39:22,160
What are the names of the Navi?

2078
01:39:22,160 --> 01:39:23,480
I really should know this.

2079
01:39:23,480 --> 01:39:26,280
I'm going to cut this out to make it sound like I know.

2080
01:39:26,360 --> 01:39:28,920
I'm just going to add it. When you guys are going to I will edit in me saying,

2081
01:39:28,920 --> 01:39:30,400
oh, well, the names are not VR.

2082
01:39:30,400 --> 01:39:31,360
And then I'll say them.

2083
01:39:31,360 --> 01:39:32,520
Nateri.

2084
01:39:33,480 --> 01:39:34,960
No one sounds familiar to me.

2085
01:39:34,960 --> 01:39:37,200
That's right. Moat.

2086
01:39:37,200 --> 01:39:39,800
Yep, that's right, too. Is there like a CPH pounder?

2087
01:39:39,800 --> 01:39:40,800
Turk.

2088
01:39:41,160 --> 01:39:44,960
Taruk. Taruk is one of the Banshees.

2089
01:39:44,960 --> 01:39:45,960
Yes, right.

2090
01:39:45,960 --> 01:39:47,560
A-Tucon.

2091
01:39:47,960 --> 01:39:50,720
Yeah. A-Tucon.

2092
01:39:50,720 --> 01:39:54,800
I think he's the chief. E-Y-T-U-K-A-N.

2093
01:39:54,800 --> 01:39:55,800
Yeah.

2094
01:39:58,040 --> 01:40:00,520
There's also Private Fike.

2095
01:40:00,520 --> 01:40:02,080
Who is Private Fike?

2096
01:40:02,080 --> 01:40:04,920
Sean Anthony Brown.

2097
01:40:04,920 --> 01:40:06,400
No, I mean, I knew that.

2098
01:40:06,400 --> 01:40:08,240
But yeah, well, we do.

2099
01:40:08,240 --> 01:40:09,840
I'm testing you guys.

2100
01:40:09,840 --> 01:40:12,040
Don't say Robici, because I want to see if I can pull it.

2101
01:40:12,040 --> 01:40:13,600
Yeah, go for it.

2102
01:40:13,600 --> 01:40:16,000
I know it, but you did get Norm Spellman.

2103
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:17,960
I did get Norm Spellman.

2104
01:40:17,960 --> 01:40:18,960
Wow.

2105
01:40:18,960 --> 01:40:20,960
I had a lot riding on Joe David Moore.

2106
01:40:20,960 --> 01:40:23,720
Well, you try to think of Robici's character, Mike.

2107
01:40:23,720 --> 01:40:27,840
You don't know the language well enough to be able to name this segment.

2108
01:40:27,840 --> 01:40:31,520
Like, test your knowledge or the ultimate quiz.

2109
01:40:31,520 --> 01:40:35,360
Well, obviously, CIVACO applies.

2110
01:40:35,360 --> 01:40:37,240
Rise of the Champ.

2111
01:40:37,240 --> 01:40:38,840
OK, all right. So, CIVACO.

2112
01:40:38,840 --> 01:40:41,120
Are we playing CIVACO?

2113
01:40:41,120 --> 01:40:42,720
G-Vani Robici is...

2114
01:40:42,720 --> 01:40:43,720
Yeah, G-Vani Robici.

2115
01:40:43,720 --> 01:40:45,200
G-Vani Robici is... Oh, shit.

2116
01:40:45,200 --> 01:40:47,320
Do you have the answer, Robici?

2117
01:40:47,320 --> 01:40:48,720
Yes, Parker Selfridge.

2118
01:40:48,720 --> 01:40:50,600
Fuck, I wasn't going to pull it.

2119
01:40:50,600 --> 01:40:51,600
I wasn't going to pull it.

2120
01:40:51,600 --> 01:40:52,880
A different Mr. Selfridge.

2121
01:40:53,840 --> 01:40:55,960
A non-cancelled Mr. Selfridge.

2122
01:40:55,960 --> 01:40:58,240
I like Parker Selfridge cookies.

2123
01:40:58,240 --> 01:40:59,240
I like them a lot.

2124
01:40:59,240 --> 01:41:00,240
I like them a lot.

2125
01:41:00,240 --> 01:41:01,240
I can't lose either.

2126
01:41:01,240 --> 01:41:02,240
Yeah.

2127
01:41:02,240 --> 01:41:03,240
Yeah.

2128
01:41:03,240 --> 01:41:11,000
This is my favorite episode of The Prophet, that young child baker, Parker Selfridge cookies.

2129
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,000
I'm trying to find...

2130
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,440
I really see something in Parker Selfridge.

2131
01:41:15,440 --> 01:41:18,960
That's a few jumble letters in her name.

2132
01:41:18,960 --> 01:41:20,960
What else can we do here?

2133
01:41:21,040 --> 01:41:24,040
Miles Quidditch...

2134
01:41:24,040 --> 01:41:25,040
Quidditch?

2135
01:41:25,040 --> 01:41:26,040
Quar-titch.

2136
01:41:26,040 --> 01:41:27,040
Steven Lang's character.

2137
01:41:27,040 --> 01:41:28,040
Steven Lang's character.

2138
01:41:28,040 --> 01:41:29,040
Miles again.

2139
01:41:29,040 --> 01:41:30,040
Carl Portage?

2140
01:41:30,040 --> 01:41:33,040
But I think I was close to that name.

2141
01:41:33,040 --> 01:41:34,040
Yeah.

2142
01:41:34,040 --> 01:41:35,040
Wow.

2143
01:41:35,040 --> 01:41:36,040
Quaritch.

2144
01:41:36,040 --> 01:41:37,040
I think it's Quaritch.

2145
01:41:37,040 --> 01:41:38,040
Miles again.

2146
01:41:38,040 --> 01:41:39,040
Another name coming up.

2147
01:41:39,040 --> 01:41:40,040
Miles again.

2148
01:41:40,040 --> 01:41:41,040
Miles again.

2149
01:41:41,040 --> 01:41:44,040
Hey, let me do another...

2150
01:41:44,040 --> 01:41:47,040
Let me get back to Terminator.

2151
01:41:47,040 --> 01:41:48,040
The show is about to begin.

2152
01:41:48,040 --> 01:41:50,040
But still call it CIVACO.

2153
01:41:50,120 --> 01:41:59,600
Can anyone CIVACO and tell me who performed at the opening ceremony of T2 3D opening at

2154
01:41:59,600 --> 01:42:01,920
Universal Hollywood?

2155
01:42:01,920 --> 01:42:02,920
Like an actor or musical?

2156
01:42:02,920 --> 01:42:03,920
Musical performance.

2157
01:42:03,920 --> 01:42:04,920
It's a musical performance.

2158
01:42:04,920 --> 01:42:05,920
It's 96?

2159
01:42:05,920 --> 01:42:06,920
90...

2160
01:42:06,920 --> 01:42:07,920
It would have been 99 in Hollywood.

2161
01:42:07,920 --> 01:42:08,920
99, okay.

2162
01:42:08,920 --> 01:42:09,920
So who would have been?

2163
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:10,920
I think...

2164
01:42:10,920 --> 01:42:11,920
Here's a hint.

2165
01:42:11,920 --> 01:42:12,920
99 tells you nothing.

2166
01:42:12,920 --> 01:42:13,920
Really?

2167
01:42:13,920 --> 01:42:14,920
Yeah.

2168
01:42:14,920 --> 01:42:17,920
So people would have been on the Vine for a little while.

2169
01:42:18,800 --> 01:42:21,800
Okay, I'll keep hinting it over.

2170
01:42:21,800 --> 01:42:26,800
It is a song, maybe the only song affiliated with the franchise.

2171
01:42:26,800 --> 01:42:29,800
Well, it wouldn't have been Guns N' Roses.

2172
01:42:29,800 --> 01:42:30,800
Oh, Band to the Bone.

2173
01:42:30,800 --> 01:42:31,800
You got it.

2174
01:42:31,800 --> 01:42:32,800
Really?

2175
01:42:32,800 --> 01:42:33,800
What's his name?

2176
01:42:33,800 --> 01:42:35,800
I don't know if I've ever known that answer.

2177
01:42:35,800 --> 01:42:36,800
Does nobody know?

2178
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:37,800
The name?

2179
01:42:37,800 --> 01:42:38,800
Band to the Bone?

2180
01:42:38,800 --> 01:42:39,800
The guy who sings Band to the Bone?

2181
01:42:39,800 --> 01:42:40,800
Oh, it's right there.

2182
01:42:40,800 --> 01:42:41,800
Is it a band or is it a guy?

2183
01:42:41,800 --> 01:42:42,800
It's a guy.

2184
01:42:42,800 --> 01:42:43,800
And I think it's a guy.

2185
01:42:43,800 --> 01:42:44,800
I think it's a guy.

2186
01:42:45,680 --> 01:42:46,680
Is it a band or is it a guy?

2187
01:42:46,680 --> 01:42:47,680
It's a guy.

2188
01:42:47,680 --> 01:42:50,680
With a band, but his name's in the...

2189
01:42:50,680 --> 01:42:53,680
And it's not Miles Stone Ridge.

2190
01:42:53,680 --> 01:42:54,680
What was his name?

2191
01:42:54,680 --> 01:42:55,680
Miles Quirtridge.

2192
01:42:55,680 --> 01:42:56,680
Please show some respect.

2193
01:42:56,680 --> 01:42:57,680
Miles Quirtridge.

2194
01:42:57,680 --> 01:42:58,680
Miles Quirtridge.

2195
01:42:58,680 --> 01:42:59,680
No, I didn't know that.

2196
01:42:59,680 --> 01:43:02,680
This is a recognizable name.

2197
01:43:02,680 --> 01:43:03,680
George Thurgood.

2198
01:43:03,680 --> 01:43:04,680
Oh, George Thurgood.

2199
01:43:04,680 --> 01:43:05,680
That's embarrassing.

2200
01:43:05,680 --> 01:43:10,680
Good, ironically, in the name of the ultimate badster.

2201
01:43:11,560 --> 01:43:14,560
Well, you kind of have a code, Jason.

2202
01:43:14,560 --> 01:43:15,560
You have a code.

2203
01:43:15,560 --> 01:43:16,560
With the help of technology.

2204
01:43:16,560 --> 01:43:17,560
Oh, wait, yeah.

2205
01:43:17,560 --> 01:43:18,560
Did you?

2206
01:43:18,560 --> 01:43:19,560
Oh, no, I got the Band to the Bone.

2207
01:43:19,560 --> 01:43:20,560
I didn't pull George Thurgood.

2208
01:43:20,560 --> 01:43:21,560
Yeah, yeah.

2209
01:43:21,560 --> 01:43:22,560
Credit where credit's due.

2210
01:43:22,560 --> 01:43:25,560
We're going to lose listeners in the south on that one.

2211
01:43:25,560 --> 01:43:28,560
On that Polly line.

2212
01:43:28,560 --> 01:43:33,560
Okay, so we've jumped around the movie a little bit, but we...

2213
01:43:33,560 --> 01:43:36,560
Okay, you put on your safety glasses.

2214
01:43:36,560 --> 01:43:39,560
There is a demonstration of the T-70s.

2215
01:43:40,440 --> 01:43:41,440
They blast the shit out of some targets.

2216
01:43:41,440 --> 01:43:44,440
They make you feel like there is live gunfire.

2217
01:43:44,440 --> 01:43:45,440
Yeah.

2218
01:43:45,440 --> 01:43:47,440
I mean, it's a pretty good simulation of...

2219
01:43:47,440 --> 01:43:50,440
The theater in general, the tech for this thing.

2220
01:43:50,440 --> 01:43:52,440
I saw a stat that was like 66 speakers.

2221
01:43:52,440 --> 01:43:55,440
I saw another stat that was like 159 speakers.

2222
01:43:55,440 --> 01:43:58,440
The sound is crazy.

2223
01:43:58,440 --> 01:43:59,440
And they really...

2224
01:43:59,440 --> 01:44:04,440
Because, you know, it's all those metallic things swiping at you.

2225
01:44:05,320 --> 01:44:12,320
And aren't they like stereo moving around the voices of the actors?

2226
01:44:12,320 --> 01:44:17,320
Because you're listening to the real voices of Arnold and Lin-Anne.

2227
01:44:17,320 --> 01:44:20,320
People are mime-ing, like opening their mouth.

2228
01:44:20,320 --> 01:44:21,320
They're lip-syncing.

2229
01:44:21,320 --> 01:44:22,320
Yeah.

2230
01:44:22,320 --> 01:44:23,320
And it's not perfect.

2231
01:44:23,320 --> 01:44:24,320
How could it be perfect?

2232
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:28,320
That's a little bit of like a theme park trope, but does it happen in things besides this?

2233
01:44:28,320 --> 01:44:30,320
Well, they have recorded voices on...

2234
01:44:30,320 --> 01:44:32,320
There's other stunt shows that do this.

2235
01:44:33,200 --> 01:44:35,200
Indiana Jones stunt show, they have like recorded stuff.

2236
01:44:35,200 --> 01:44:36,200
It's not always live.

2237
01:44:36,200 --> 01:44:37,200
It's not the actors.

2238
01:44:37,200 --> 01:44:38,200
But it's not Harrison Ford.

2239
01:44:38,200 --> 01:44:39,200
It's Arnold.

2240
01:44:39,200 --> 01:44:41,200
That's really a step up.

2241
01:44:41,200 --> 01:44:45,200
Harrison Ford is not Indiana Jones in anywhere in the Disney parks.

2242
01:44:45,200 --> 01:44:48,200
But this is Arnold and he is the Terminator.

2243
01:44:48,200 --> 01:44:49,200
Crazy.

2244
01:44:49,200 --> 01:44:50,200
Yeah, it's crazy.

2245
01:44:50,200 --> 01:44:55,400
I mean, they need those pre-recorded lines so people can hit their exact marks so they

2246
01:44:55,400 --> 01:44:58,400
don't exactly get shot by blanks or something insane.

2247
01:44:58,480 --> 01:45:05,480
And that's a thing in footage, like watching James Cameron on the mock-up stage directing

2248
01:45:05,480 --> 01:45:09,480
it exactly like he is the movie and going, you've got to mark this thing up.

2249
01:45:09,480 --> 01:45:11,480
This should be marked up like a dance studio.

2250
01:45:11,480 --> 01:45:12,480
They've got to get exactly here.

2251
01:45:12,480 --> 01:45:14,480
We can't be half-assed about this.

2252
01:45:14,480 --> 01:45:19,480
And you know how there's that footage that's filmed of like, you know, there's like fake

2253
01:45:19,480 --> 01:45:24,480
footage of Tom Hanks recording his Toy Story voice, but you know, he like did it without

2254
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:26,480
cameras and they brought him in for a press day.

2255
01:45:26,560 --> 01:45:29,560
He didn't look like shit when he went in there that first day and he didn't have the voice

2256
01:45:29,560 --> 01:45:30,560
right.

2257
01:45:30,560 --> 01:45:31,560
The benefit of voice acting.

2258
01:45:31,560 --> 01:45:34,560
He should be allowed to look like shit and not have a bunch of lights, like it probably

2259
01:45:34,560 --> 01:45:37,560
bugs you what you're doing in a video.

2260
01:45:37,560 --> 01:45:42,560
But like James Cameron, clearly, like this is not like contrived footage because he is

2261
01:45:42,560 --> 01:45:43,560
in all the behind the scenes.

2262
01:45:43,560 --> 01:45:46,560
He is being a dick and I would expect no less.

2263
01:45:46,560 --> 01:45:47,560
That's what you want out of him.

2264
01:45:47,560 --> 01:45:51,560
There is a documentary I love that I think is called, I always get the title wrong because

2265
01:45:51,640 --> 01:45:57,640
it's a bunch of nothing words, but it's like James Cameron's Deep Sea Challenge 3D.

2266
01:45:57,640 --> 01:46:03,640
And it's a documentary where he hired a crew to make a documentary and he gave them final

2267
01:46:03,640 --> 01:46:05,640
cut and the thing makes him look really bad.

2268
01:46:05,640 --> 01:46:06,640
Wow.

2269
01:46:06,640 --> 01:46:10,640
But it's a 3D documentary about him trying to go deeper than anyone has ever gone in

2270
01:46:10,640 --> 01:46:11,640
the ocean.

2271
01:46:11,640 --> 01:46:16,640
And a lot of title, 100% on that.

2272
01:46:16,720 --> 01:46:23,720
And yes, James Cameron's Deep Sea Challenge 3D brought to you by Rolex.

2273
01:46:23,720 --> 01:46:24,720
Yes.

2274
01:46:24,720 --> 01:46:35,720
A beautiful National Geographic, a lot of this documentary is a 3D, really well shot

2275
01:46:37,160 --> 01:46:44,160
in 3D, well rendered 3D talking head interviews of James Cameron's wife, Susie Amos going

2276
01:46:44,680 --> 01:46:49,680
like, I don't know, I mean, you know, I wish he was happy enough just being at home with

2277
01:46:49,680 --> 01:46:50,680
us.

2278
01:46:50,680 --> 01:46:51,680
Oh no.

2279
01:46:51,680 --> 01:46:57,680
But if he needs to go to the bottom of the sea and risk dying to prove himself, I guess

2280
01:46:57,680 --> 01:46:59,680
that's the man I married.

2281
01:46:59,680 --> 01:47:00,680
Oh my God.

2282
01:47:00,680 --> 01:47:04,680
And it's like, it's just him yelling at people that they haven't built the capsule well enough.

2283
01:47:04,680 --> 01:47:06,680
Is it like that Ginger Baker documentary?

2284
01:47:06,680 --> 01:47:07,680
Kind of.

2285
01:47:07,680 --> 01:47:08,680
Where he's like screaming.

2286
01:47:08,680 --> 01:47:09,680
Right.

2287
01:47:09,680 --> 01:47:10,680
Oh my God, this guy.

2288
01:47:10,680 --> 01:47:11,680
Right.

2289
01:47:12,200 --> 01:47:13,200
He's like, I'm going to have a buddy rich tapes or something.

2290
01:47:13,200 --> 01:47:19,200
Except he allowed people to film it in 3D and his wife is just kind of like, yeah, well

2291
01:47:19,200 --> 01:47:20,200
that's my husband.

2292
01:47:20,200 --> 01:47:21,200
And that parts in 3D too?

2293
01:47:21,200 --> 01:47:22,200
Yes, all of it's in 3D.

2294
01:47:22,200 --> 01:47:23,200
That's a sad interview with 3D.

2295
01:47:23,200 --> 01:47:28,200
James Cameron's marital problems rendered in perfect 3D.

2296
01:47:28,200 --> 01:47:29,200
Eye popping 3D.

2297
01:47:29,200 --> 01:47:32,200
James Cameron's marital challenge 3D.

2298
01:47:32,200 --> 01:47:36,600
I mean, she's complaining about the difficulties of being married to a perfectionist while

2299
01:47:36,600 --> 01:47:39,200
playing paddleboard towards the camera.

2300
01:47:39,200 --> 01:47:40,200
Sure.

2301
01:47:40,200 --> 01:47:41,200
Right.

2302
01:47:41,720 --> 01:47:43,720
While operating a remote control pie machine.

2303
01:47:43,720 --> 01:47:44,720
Yes.

2304
01:47:44,720 --> 01:47:47,720
Oh my God.

2305
01:47:47,720 --> 01:47:50,080
This is the ride or the show.

2306
01:47:50,080 --> 01:47:55,400
I did not see it as a child, which I always think of the Ninja Turtles coming out of their

2307
01:47:55,400 --> 01:47:58,240
shells show, which I saw as a child.

2308
01:47:58,240 --> 01:48:01,920
And when they, this is going back a little bit, but when they say you five minutes, they

2309
01:48:01,920 --> 01:48:03,080
give you that five minutes.

2310
01:48:03,080 --> 01:48:04,840
I would have lost my mind.

2311
01:48:04,840 --> 01:48:05,840
I don't know.

2312
01:48:05,840 --> 01:48:08,640
I was so scared that Shredder locked the doors on me.

2313
01:48:08,640 --> 01:48:10,360
He goes, you're not getting out of here.

2314
01:48:10,360 --> 01:48:11,360
I've locked the doors.

2315
01:48:11,360 --> 01:48:13,760
And I was really scared.

2316
01:48:13,760 --> 01:48:17,680
He's really shredding those CDs in the music destroying machine.

2317
01:48:17,680 --> 01:48:18,680
Yes, he is.

2318
01:48:18,680 --> 01:48:20,560
But there was no fire or whatever.

2319
01:48:20,560 --> 01:48:21,560
He didn't shoot a gun.

2320
01:48:21,560 --> 01:48:23,920
This is the one with the soldiers didn't have guns.

2321
01:48:23,920 --> 01:48:30,160
They were like firing rounds off in the stakes are very high in this attraction because they're

2322
01:48:30,160 --> 01:48:34,280
like, we're trying to prevent the end of humanity.

2323
01:48:34,280 --> 01:48:39,520
Like, it's not even just like you folks are going to get directly in the line of fire.

2324
01:48:39,840 --> 01:48:42,560
It's like civilization might be done.

2325
01:48:42,560 --> 01:48:46,600
Right. Like Shredder was threatening to destroy music, but like I was like, fuck that.

2326
01:48:46,600 --> 01:48:47,600
Get me out of here.

2327
01:48:49,160 --> 01:48:50,160
I can live without music.

2328
01:48:50,160 --> 01:48:52,120
I don't care. I just want to not die.

2329
01:48:52,120 --> 01:48:53,120
Let him have it.

2330
01:48:53,120 --> 01:48:54,120
Yeah.

2331
01:48:54,120 --> 01:48:55,600
This one I would have had to stay.

2332
01:48:55,600 --> 01:49:01,240
As we're saying this, I'm having the realization that, you know, we talked about earlier, our

2333
01:49:01,240 --> 01:49:02,760
current dystopian hell.

2334
01:49:02,760 --> 01:49:08,800
We've done a full 180 from this movie because as a kid, I was like, OK with going into the

2335
01:49:08,800 --> 01:49:11,880
auditorium because I like, oh, I know that Connors are the good guys.

2336
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:19,440
But now in 2019, survivalist off the grid maniacs are like QA non people.

2337
01:49:19,440 --> 01:49:22,280
Yeah, they are the bad guys.

2338
01:49:22,280 --> 01:49:26,320
And also the corporation is still the bad guys.

2339
01:49:26,320 --> 01:49:28,440
So there are no good guys.

2340
01:49:28,440 --> 01:49:33,960
There's that weird part in the pre show where they hack into the feed to sell their brain

2341
01:49:33,960 --> 01:49:36,520
pills. Yes, they did.

2342
01:49:36,720 --> 01:49:42,320
I was curious why they were selling Gorilla Mind at the exit in 2017, right?

2343
01:49:42,320 --> 01:49:43,480
As it was closing down.

2344
01:49:43,480 --> 01:49:47,280
Well, that's a joke, but they were selling when I was there in 2017.

2345
01:49:47,560 --> 01:49:54,000
The gift shop was very little Terminator, a lot of Justice League and Suicide Squad

2346
01:49:54,000 --> 01:50:00,280
merchandise and DC Comics, individual DC Comics, despite the fact that Marvel Comics

2347
01:50:00,280 --> 01:50:03,400
are being sold like a quarter mile away.

2348
01:50:03,400 --> 01:50:04,920
It was very bizarre.

2349
01:50:04,920 --> 01:50:06,120
Strange. That's very strange.

2350
01:50:06,120 --> 01:50:08,120
Anybody make it to the cyber grill?

2351
01:50:08,880 --> 01:50:10,800
And that was the attached restaurant.

2352
01:50:10,800 --> 01:50:13,800
There was an attached restaurant in Hollywood.

2353
01:50:13,800 --> 01:50:14,800
I did.

2354
01:50:14,800 --> 01:50:18,880
Where the name is it where the playland the main because this was replaced by the

2355
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:20,440
minions ride the funland.

2356
01:50:20,440 --> 01:50:22,360
Yeah. Is that where the funland was?

2357
01:50:22,360 --> 01:50:25,080
Yeah, that's now like a grew cafe.

2358
01:50:25,160 --> 01:50:26,200
Yes. Oh, it is.

2359
01:50:26,200 --> 01:50:27,800
Oh, it is. OK, that's on the other side.

2360
01:50:27,800 --> 01:50:29,080
That I mean, at the grew cafe.

2361
01:50:29,080 --> 01:50:30,360
Yeah. Yeah.

2362
01:50:30,360 --> 01:50:33,360
It says cyber grill in a scary logo that looks cool.

2363
01:50:33,400 --> 01:50:36,600
But then under that, just like pizza, burgers and sandwiches,

2364
01:50:36,960 --> 01:50:38,640
they are not spacefied.

2365
01:50:38,640 --> 01:50:42,160
Right. Then in Orlando, it still has not been replaced by something.

2366
01:50:42,160 --> 01:50:45,440
Right. That's where the Jason Bourne would be.

2367
01:50:45,480 --> 01:50:47,880
That's what past guest Matt Rogers said.

2368
01:50:47,880 --> 01:50:50,520
Yeah. And said, we've heard that elsewhere.

2369
01:50:50,520 --> 01:50:52,920
I think that corroborated a bunch of places.

2370
01:50:52,920 --> 01:50:55,720
It feels like a very weird time to do that.

2371
01:50:56,040 --> 01:50:58,520
It feels like maybe it's not going to happen.

2372
01:50:58,520 --> 01:51:01,240
Yeah, that's my sense now, because it's been so long.

2373
01:51:01,240 --> 01:51:03,120
I'm sure that was a plan at one point.

2374
01:51:03,160 --> 01:51:05,720
Are you saying it fell apart?

2375
01:51:05,720 --> 01:51:08,360
Oh, baby, it fell apart.

2376
01:51:08,360 --> 01:51:11,840
No one else remembers the movie song that plays at the end of every

2377
01:51:11,840 --> 01:51:13,280
Jason Bourne movie. Just me.

2378
01:51:13,280 --> 01:51:16,120
No, you were the biggest Bourne had of all of you.

2379
01:51:16,360 --> 01:51:18,520
I remember. I like those movies.

2380
01:51:18,520 --> 01:51:21,000
And you were born to be wild.

2381
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,720
Yes. I was born for Bourne.

2382
01:51:24,440 --> 01:51:27,080
Yeah, I look, I did not know the Moby song

2383
01:51:27,080 --> 01:51:28,920
that played in the credits of the Bourne movies.

2384
01:51:28,920 --> 01:51:30,440
I'm so sorry.

2385
01:51:31,400 --> 01:51:34,920
You know, it's been two straight hours of deep references

2386
01:51:34,920 --> 01:51:36,560
and you you stumped us.

2387
01:51:36,560 --> 01:51:37,920
You see the code to stump us.

2388
01:51:37,920 --> 01:51:40,720
I was already like kind of like upset with myself for not knowing

2389
01:51:40,720 --> 01:51:42,280
the Avatar characters. And then you said that.

2390
01:51:42,280 --> 01:51:44,480
And I was like looking at Scott like, oh, please don't know this.

2391
01:51:44,480 --> 01:51:46,880
Please. You everyone else don't know what Jason's talking about.

2392
01:51:46,880 --> 01:51:49,320
I texted you something. Do you want to read it?

2393
01:51:49,320 --> 01:51:52,040
What are you talking about?

2394
01:51:52,040 --> 01:51:54,000
I love you.

2395
01:51:55,920 --> 01:51:57,280
Well, that's just to be sure.

2396
01:51:57,280 --> 01:51:58,960
I was saying that before.

2397
01:51:58,960 --> 01:52:01,360
It's oh, yeah, it's it's

2398
01:52:01,360 --> 01:52:04,120
I see you in Navi.

2399
01:52:04,120 --> 01:52:06,920
All not got to come.

2400
01:52:07,880 --> 01:52:10,960
Yeah, that's really roll off the tongue like Sivakko does.

2401
01:52:11,280 --> 01:52:14,120
Sivakko makes a lot of sense.

2402
01:52:14,120 --> 01:52:17,240
And aside from it not being perhaps

2403
01:52:17,680 --> 01:52:21,320
the peak moment of Jason Bourne's cultural relevancy,

2404
01:52:21,720 --> 01:52:25,160
it also just feels like other different ride systems,

2405
01:52:25,160 --> 01:52:28,640
but at least they replaced like T2 with like minions,

2406
01:52:28,640 --> 01:52:32,880
which is also like screen based and place in a similar kind of structure

2407
01:52:33,240 --> 01:52:36,560
to like tear that down and just turn it into like a stunt theater.

2408
01:52:37,040 --> 01:52:39,720
Unless do we know it doesn't have a screen component?

2409
01:52:39,800 --> 01:52:40,400
I don't know.

2410
01:52:40,400 --> 01:52:43,640
I don't know. My hope, but it's like, but what is the screen component?

2411
01:52:43,640 --> 01:52:46,760
Right. Is it going to be Matt Damon shooting new footage

2412
01:52:46,760 --> 01:52:48,120
that people interact with?

2413
01:52:48,120 --> 01:52:50,480
Like, is it going to be a stunt show where like Indiana Jones,

2414
01:52:50,760 --> 01:52:53,160
someone is pretending to be Jason Bourne?

2415
01:52:53,480 --> 01:52:56,920
And like the fights are good in those movies, but it doesn't kind of have

2416
01:52:56,920 --> 01:53:00,960
the same sort of iconography as like a whip in a hat.

2417
01:53:01,040 --> 01:53:05,280
Oh, it's a relic. Jason is, of course, fuming as you say this.

2418
01:53:05,280 --> 01:53:09,560
Because I'm mad I didn't realize it's actually it's extreme ways,

2419
01:53:09,600 --> 01:53:13,360
not separate ways, extreme ways, separate ways.

2420
01:53:14,120 --> 01:53:16,360
Yeah. But man, I'm I'm.

2421
01:53:16,360 --> 01:53:18,600
Would you is the biggest born head?

2422
01:53:18,600 --> 01:53:22,480
What would you say your blue sky for a born like stunt show is like?

2423
01:53:22,840 --> 01:53:24,840
Because I don't know what I would want to see from that.

2424
01:53:24,920 --> 01:53:26,760
You would want like born to me.

2425
01:53:26,760 --> 01:53:28,840
The fun of it is like handheld.

2426
01:53:28,840 --> 01:53:32,040
You're behind him as he's jumping across buildings or something.

2427
01:53:32,160 --> 01:53:33,560
But how do you capture that?

2428
01:53:33,560 --> 01:53:37,000
Sure. I think. OK, I think I can do this.

2429
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:41,320
I think you were all the audience is potential Treadstone recruits.

2430
01:53:41,320 --> 01:53:43,880
They've reactivated Treadstone. Treadstone.

2431
01:53:44,440 --> 01:53:46,320
It's Moby's band.

2432
01:53:47,800 --> 01:53:51,880
Treadstone is the secret CIA program to make the super soldiers.

2433
01:53:51,880 --> 01:53:53,960
I think like two and a half, one and a half.

2434
01:53:54,760 --> 01:53:56,280
Did anyone else know Treadstone?

2435
01:53:56,280 --> 01:54:01,360
I have only seen the Jeremy Renner one because I thought it was a clean entry point.

2436
01:54:01,400 --> 01:54:02,880
That's bad. I was like, oh, new guy.

2437
01:54:02,880 --> 01:54:03,880
It's going to be easy to get.

2438
01:54:03,880 --> 01:54:07,640
And then the whole movie is them watching security footage from the original.

2439
01:54:07,880 --> 01:54:10,760
I can't remember. I don't think I've told this story, but I gave my

2440
01:54:11,480 --> 01:54:16,720
stepdad that for Christmas one year, having not seen it myself.

2441
01:54:16,760 --> 01:54:20,320
Yeah. And thinking like, well, he's got all the other board movies.

2442
01:54:20,320 --> 01:54:22,760
He'll like this complete the set.

2443
01:54:22,760 --> 01:54:25,920
And and where he's like, oh, why don't we watch this is like after

2444
01:54:25,960 --> 01:54:29,000
it's Christmas Day after dinner and we put it in.

2445
01:54:29,040 --> 01:54:31,200
He immediately divorced your mother.

2446
01:54:31,200 --> 01:54:35,360
It is so long and so not great.

2447
01:54:35,360 --> 01:54:40,280
And he very reserved man stood up and went, well, that wasn't very good.

2448
01:54:40,840 --> 01:54:42,080
Oh, no.

2449
01:54:42,080 --> 01:54:45,880
On the roof. It is genuinely like a lot of Jeremy Renner being like,

2450
01:54:45,880 --> 01:54:46,880
let me find the video.

2451
01:54:46,880 --> 01:54:50,680
And then he watches like a cell phone video of stuff from the first three movies.

2452
01:54:51,640 --> 01:54:53,400
Yeah, I haven't seen that one.

2453
01:54:53,400 --> 01:54:55,280
Wait, Jason, you were so you're in the middle of.

2454
01:54:55,280 --> 01:54:59,120
Yes, the audiences are potential Tredstone recruits.

2455
01:54:59,880 --> 01:55:03,560
And they bring you what it takes to be true, to get Trent Stone.

2456
01:55:04,240 --> 01:55:05,600
Did you say Trent Stone?

2457
01:55:05,600 --> 01:55:07,200
Trent Stone. What was it?

2458
01:55:07,200 --> 01:55:09,200
Treadstone. Treadstone.

2459
01:55:09,200 --> 01:55:12,120
I don't fuck if I know Treadstone.

2460
01:55:12,120 --> 01:55:15,440
Treadstone. Why would a Treadstone be that much worse?

2461
01:55:15,640 --> 01:55:18,160
A.D.N. award winner, Trent Stone.

2462
01:55:18,680 --> 01:55:22,200
And I think you are being recruited

2463
01:55:23,520 --> 01:55:28,200
to to be new Treadstone experiments, recruits, what have you.

2464
01:55:28,560 --> 01:55:34,960
And the stuff you can not determinate or stuff starts to go wrong.

2465
01:55:35,160 --> 01:55:39,920
Maybe Jason Bourne can hack into the footage and they get you into the auditorium.

2466
01:55:40,800 --> 01:55:44,160
And and it's all CIA people in business,

2467
01:55:44,920 --> 01:55:49,240
you know, formal where shredding documents and stuff like we got to get out of here.

2468
01:55:49,240 --> 01:55:50,160
Bourne's on his way.

2469
01:55:50,160 --> 01:55:52,200
Live shredding of documents.

2470
01:55:52,200 --> 01:55:57,200
And then he it's hard because you want to keep throwing guys at him

2471
01:55:57,200 --> 01:55:59,640
because they'll need to fight like regular goons.

2472
01:55:59,640 --> 01:56:04,640
But then he has to fight like like the Clive Owen, like other Treadstone guys.

2473
01:56:04,640 --> 01:56:09,400
There's always one or two other guys like him who have the enhanced reflex.

2474
01:56:09,400 --> 01:56:12,600
And then he finally has to fight the head of it, Trent himself.

2475
01:56:12,840 --> 01:56:14,440
And then the Mike Sturston,

2476
01:56:14,440 --> 01:56:17,040
I constantly scream, who am I?

2477
01:56:17,040 --> 01:56:21,720
Because he's still we still kind of don't know who he but we kind of do.

2478
01:56:21,880 --> 01:56:24,000
He's had a few names, I feel like.

2479
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,560
Do you like these movies so much because he has your name?

2480
01:56:27,760 --> 01:56:31,440
Jason. Yeah, that was why I liked the Red Power Ranger growing up.

2481
01:56:31,440 --> 01:56:34,080
So maybe. All right, we solved it.

2482
01:56:34,120 --> 01:56:35,960
Yeah, got it.

2483
01:56:35,960 --> 01:56:38,120
Ethan Hunt just doesn't have my name.

2484
01:56:39,360 --> 01:56:40,840
Something about him.

2485
01:56:41,720 --> 01:56:43,280
Something unrelatable about that.

2486
01:56:43,280 --> 01:56:45,800
He had another movie.

2487
01:56:47,080 --> 01:56:50,120
I don't have my name for it.

2488
01:56:50,120 --> 01:56:54,680
It is kind of like hard to talk about the main body of the T2

2489
01:56:55,360 --> 01:57:00,040
3D attraction because it's like just well done, you know?

2490
01:57:00,360 --> 01:57:02,480
I know. I don't have a lot of notes.

2491
01:57:02,480 --> 01:57:03,680
I just accepted it.

2492
01:57:03,680 --> 01:57:08,520
It's like my notes say best 3D best theme park 3D movie question.

2493
01:57:08,840 --> 01:57:10,480
And then serious guns.

2494
01:57:12,480 --> 01:57:15,120
The incredible sound,

2495
01:57:15,120 --> 01:57:17,880
the very nonspecific notes, it's just very good.

2496
01:57:17,920 --> 01:57:19,800
Serious guns, though, you got to admit.

2497
01:57:19,800 --> 01:57:23,920
Serious guns, serious guns, real explosions that they were setting off.

2498
01:57:23,920 --> 01:57:26,880
Yeah, I believe that I was interested.

2499
01:57:26,880 --> 01:57:31,240
The motorcycle wasn't like it was it was in the ground.

2500
01:57:31,240 --> 01:57:33,480
It wasn't like you couldn't go anywhere with it.

2501
01:57:33,480 --> 01:57:35,000
It was on a track.

2502
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:37,000
Interesting. You can't see it at all, though.

2503
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:41,080
No. Yeah, I found this because it was I looked on the website

2504
01:57:41,080 --> 01:57:43,480
and I found an interview with one of the guys who played Arnold.

2505
01:57:43,600 --> 01:57:46,880
Oh, and the interview is boring.

2506
01:57:47,920 --> 01:57:50,920
But what I like is that when I open my computer up here,

2507
01:57:50,920 --> 01:57:53,160
although it's connected to the recorder, so I shouldn't.

2508
01:57:53,160 --> 01:57:54,720
The man looks like a young G.

2509
01:57:54,720 --> 01:57:57,680
Gordon Liddy, that Jacked Young G.

2510
01:57:57,680 --> 01:58:00,320
Gordon Liddy behind the scenes.

2511
01:58:01,160 --> 01:58:03,280
I love Arnold.

2512
01:58:03,360 --> 01:58:08,040
They had a couple minutes to shoot Arnold talking about this and him just

2513
01:58:08,360 --> 01:58:12,480
he's in a chair in a T-shirt and he says, ha ha ha.

2514
01:58:12,480 --> 01:58:15,440
We're back again with the Terminator T2 3D.

2515
01:58:15,440 --> 01:58:18,200
And he is holding a half finished cigar.

2516
01:58:18,200 --> 01:58:19,560
The Stoge. I was going to ask.

2517
01:58:19,560 --> 01:58:21,480
Stoge down.

2518
01:58:21,480 --> 01:58:23,400
Peek Arnold's prime.

2519
01:58:23,680 --> 01:58:26,920
The quote I wrote down was he's taking your head off.

2520
01:58:29,440 --> 01:58:31,680
I mean, you see that promo footage.

2521
01:58:31,760 --> 01:58:32,960
I got to know what that means.

2522
01:58:32,960 --> 01:58:34,560
He also seems like he had to be convinced.

2523
01:58:34,560 --> 01:58:36,760
He's like, I didn't necessarily do this.

2524
01:58:36,760 --> 01:58:38,640
But then James Cameron and he's great.

2525
01:58:38,640 --> 01:58:42,520
And like he like he talks about like being talked into it.

2526
01:58:42,520 --> 01:58:44,920
I feel like any kind of says like I could have been.

2527
01:58:45,240 --> 01:58:46,320
Where is this place?

2528
01:58:46,320 --> 01:58:46,880
Where are we?

2529
01:58:46,880 --> 01:58:49,160
Is it in the California desert?

2530
01:58:49,160 --> 01:58:51,560
Why are we doing triumph more so?

2531
01:58:52,600 --> 01:58:55,560
But like, which that's the thing about it.

2532
01:58:55,560 --> 01:59:00,120
The they filmed it, a weird abandoned iron mine.

2533
01:59:00,320 --> 01:59:00,680
Yeah.

2534
01:59:00,680 --> 01:59:05,800
In the kind of like way, like further out from Joshua Tree,

2535
01:59:06,520 --> 01:59:10,680
frequent movie location, it seems like, but potentially like a toxic play.

2536
01:59:10,680 --> 01:59:11,840
I think it's like embattled.

2537
01:59:11,840 --> 01:59:13,760
The residents want to do something with it.

2538
01:59:13,760 --> 01:59:17,160
And it's just decaying and great post apocalyptic location.

2539
01:59:17,160 --> 01:59:19,920
They had to film there two weeks, almost entirely night.

2540
01:59:20,120 --> 01:59:22,120
Well, yes, entirely night shoots for sure.

2541
01:59:23,200 --> 01:59:25,080
Yeah. Crazy production.

2542
01:59:25,080 --> 01:59:27,960
Yeah, I like there's in that in that I think that's in the same

2543
01:59:28,360 --> 01:59:31,240
like behind the scenes where James Cameron's talking about like 3D.

2544
01:59:31,240 --> 01:59:33,800
And he's like, you know, you don't want to do that, like those cheap effects

2545
01:59:33,800 --> 01:59:37,440
or whatever, you know, you really want to just like I think the trick is to really

2546
01:59:37,440 --> 01:59:40,360
just good filmmaking with 3D like he he lays it out.

2547
01:59:40,360 --> 01:59:43,000
But then he's like, but you also want like a few of those tricks

2548
01:59:44,800 --> 01:59:45,600
which you get.

2549
01:59:45,600 --> 01:59:46,520
We get the head.

2550
01:59:46,520 --> 01:59:48,240
You can see it was a good balance.

2551
01:59:48,240 --> 01:59:51,560
John, the T 1000 head poking out.

2552
01:59:51,600 --> 01:59:52,560
But that's cool.

2553
01:59:52,560 --> 01:59:53,680
The tricks are cool.

2554
01:59:53,680 --> 01:59:54,520
There's one million.

2555
01:59:54,520 --> 01:59:55,440
They just don't match.

2556
01:59:55,440 --> 01:59:56,760
They're a little sillier.

2557
01:59:56,760 --> 01:59:58,480
The mini hunters give you a lot.

2558
01:59:58,480 --> 01:59:59,920
That's some fun.

2559
01:59:59,920 --> 02:00:02,480
Like that, like I think

2560
02:00:03,080 --> 02:00:06,720
I think it holds up because the mini hunters wasn't around.

2561
02:00:06,720 --> 02:00:08,760
And the T one million are metallic.

2562
02:00:08,760 --> 02:00:12,680
And they're able to use like the reflectiveness, the shininess of 3D.

2563
02:00:12,680 --> 02:00:15,880
It's like the Toy Story thing where it's like that still ages OK,

2564
02:00:15,880 --> 02:00:19,280
because they're supposed to look super shiny and plastic. Right.

2565
02:00:19,560 --> 02:00:20,480
Sure. Right.

2566
02:00:21,400 --> 02:00:24,200
One of the things I'm sure somebody's going to correct me and I'm wrong,

2567
02:00:24,200 --> 02:00:30,000
but it's the the theater kind of opening up effect, which is used

2568
02:00:30,160 --> 02:00:34,080
in like Mickey's Philhar Magic and then is used in the newer

2569
02:00:34,680 --> 02:00:36,720
DreamWorks theater show.

2570
02:00:36,720 --> 02:00:39,560
Oh, Kung Fu Panda, where they do sort of do the whole.

2571
02:00:39,760 --> 02:00:43,520
The sudden where they were hiding some cards that we actually there's

2572
02:00:43,520 --> 02:00:45,000
way more screen than you even thought.

2573
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:46,040
Right. Like that's it.

2574
02:00:46,040 --> 02:00:48,720
Now that's sort of a trope, I feel like, of these type of movies.

2575
02:00:49,080 --> 02:00:51,960
And sort of building on, I feel

2576
02:00:52,960 --> 02:00:56,360
Muppet Vision that we're starting to do now.

2577
02:00:56,360 --> 02:01:00,360
I now at the end, the cannon goes off and there's little flickers and missing

2578
02:01:00,360 --> 02:01:04,520
bricks and there's effects on the walls you don't know about,

2579
02:01:04,520 --> 02:01:07,360
but not full screen expansion yet.

2580
02:01:07,640 --> 02:01:11,080
Right. I think a great thing about that, it like takes it exists in a world

2581
02:01:11,080 --> 02:01:13,960
where some of the like there's been some cool 3D theme park movies,

2582
02:01:13,960 --> 02:01:16,560
but how can we take it to the next level?

2583
02:01:17,360 --> 02:01:20,880
I also just love the thing that makes it feel like a proper

2584
02:01:21,160 --> 02:01:25,360
Terminator installment to me is it doesn't end with like Jimmy Fallon

2585
02:01:25,360 --> 02:01:27,200
going like, well, thanks.

2586
02:01:27,200 --> 02:01:29,040
Looks like I beat you this time.

2587
02:01:29,040 --> 02:01:30,560
See you around on the next episode.

2588
02:01:30,560 --> 02:01:33,840
Like it ends the way the Terminator movies end with like

2589
02:01:34,080 --> 02:01:37,560
Sarah Connor delivering a voiceover monologue

2590
02:01:38,080 --> 02:01:39,880
like a serious monologue.

2591
02:01:39,880 --> 02:01:44,760
And then you have the imagery of the skull turning into Arnold. Right.

2592
02:01:45,560 --> 02:01:48,840
Like already the logic of it, if you investigate, it's a little like, wait,

2593
02:01:48,840 --> 02:01:54,040
why are we being able to see a portal of them in another time period?

2594
02:01:54,480 --> 02:01:57,160
But then I like that in that final stretch, it's just like, no,

2595
02:01:57,160 --> 02:01:59,720
we're just going like full stylistic. Like this is a movie.

2596
02:02:00,440 --> 02:02:02,640
It's ending. And then they pose real cool.

2597
02:02:02,640 --> 02:02:06,560
Right. It's a real end of a play, too. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

2598
02:02:06,680 --> 02:02:09,000
It's just kind of weighty and dramatic.

2599
02:02:09,240 --> 02:02:12,320
Maybe this is the best work of narrative art

2600
02:02:13,560 --> 02:02:16,080
that anyone has ever made. No argument for me.

2601
02:02:16,120 --> 02:02:17,280
Wait a second. Yeah.

2602
02:02:17,280 --> 02:02:22,040
I think that's probably yeah, this or the California Adventure Aladdin show.

2603
02:02:22,440 --> 02:02:24,000
Yeah. They're one of the two.

2604
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:28,000
If you had to rate Muppet Vision versus T2 3D.

2605
02:02:28,280 --> 02:02:30,720
It's really tough because it's like they almost represent

2606
02:02:30,720 --> 02:02:33,480
like the two different sides of my personality.

2607
02:02:33,960 --> 02:02:37,880
And I think they're both incredible executions.

2608
02:02:38,160 --> 02:02:41,680
They're both like examples of like the last pure time

2609
02:02:41,960 --> 02:02:45,080
that the original creator had his hand in his creation.

2610
02:02:45,400 --> 02:02:47,200
That's true. Yeah, that's a good way.

2611
02:02:47,200 --> 02:02:51,480
Absolutely. I think they're like the best technical executions of 3D

2612
02:02:51,480 --> 02:02:52,880
I've ever seen.

2613
02:02:52,880 --> 02:02:57,600
And I think unlike most theme park movies like this,

2614
02:02:57,600 --> 02:03:00,240
they they have like proper like stories.

2615
02:03:00,560 --> 02:03:03,960
Yeah. Like they kind of they kind of work as films in and of themselves,

2616
02:03:03,960 --> 02:03:08,520
watching them like, you know, on YouTube, even in the sort of butchered way

2617
02:03:08,520 --> 02:03:13,400
that we do Shrek 4D, you will not enjoy watching that as a short, you know.

2618
02:03:13,400 --> 02:03:15,360
But you can on Netflix.

2619
02:03:15,360 --> 02:03:17,600
You can. I have. Yes, I have, too.

2620
02:03:17,800 --> 02:03:19,640
It's a bad movie.

2621
02:03:20,200 --> 02:03:24,360
Yeah. Well, you would have a bad time if the ghost of Farquaad

2622
02:03:24,360 --> 02:03:26,760
interrupted your honey boot. OK.

2623
02:03:28,960 --> 02:03:30,240
I mean, fair point.

2624
02:03:30,240 --> 02:03:31,000
That is fair point.

2625
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:35,600
But I would say maybe that is one of the big advantages that T2 3D

2626
02:03:35,600 --> 02:03:40,680
and Muppet Vision 3D both have going for them, which is no ghost of Farquaad.

2627
02:03:41,240 --> 02:03:43,760
Right. Specifically, Farquaad.

2628
02:03:43,760 --> 02:03:46,120
That was going to be my plus up for this, though.

2629
02:03:46,120 --> 02:03:48,800
You wanted to be a little ghost of Farquaad.

2630
02:03:48,800 --> 02:03:51,920
There is an irritating ghost.

2631
02:03:52,560 --> 02:03:53,720
We must stop.

2632
02:03:53,720 --> 02:03:58,400
I if this was still going in Florida, I would say this should be a plus up,

2633
02:03:58,400 --> 02:04:03,280
but it is still running in Japan, which you are about to go.

2634
02:04:03,360 --> 02:04:06,640
Are you not? But I am not doing universal.

2635
02:04:06,640 --> 02:04:09,920
This when I kind of this gave me a little regret

2636
02:04:09,920 --> 02:04:11,880
because I didn't realize this was still going.

2637
02:04:11,880 --> 02:04:14,440
This backdraft and jaws. Yeah.

2638
02:04:14,480 --> 02:04:16,640
Kind of tempting. Next trip for me.

2639
02:04:17,360 --> 02:04:20,480
Yeah, you should. I think it'd be a second time for me.

2640
02:04:20,520 --> 02:04:22,720
Next year, if we go, we'll do it.

2641
02:04:22,720 --> 02:04:24,600
Because there's so much.

2642
02:04:24,600 --> 02:04:26,960
It's far. That's the thing.

2643
02:04:26,960 --> 02:04:29,360
We've got too much to do.

2644
02:04:29,360 --> 02:04:30,480
Like to make all that effort.

2645
02:04:30,480 --> 02:04:32,880
Like I'm going to go to Disney Sea, which has all these custom things

2646
02:04:32,880 --> 02:04:33,640
you can't see anywhere.

2647
02:04:33,640 --> 02:04:36,880
And then I'm going to go to all the way to Osaka, see three things

2648
02:04:36,880 --> 02:04:38,840
that we used to have once.

2649
02:04:38,880 --> 02:04:42,960
Well, but what if I told you and I pulled from this before,

2650
02:04:42,960 --> 02:04:46,360
the Universal Japan English language website

2651
02:04:46,920 --> 02:04:49,400
makes these rides even better.

2652
02:04:49,400 --> 02:04:54,120
Oh, boy. It's just this is not like the oh, look, they translate to English.

2653
02:04:54,120 --> 02:04:55,080
Isn't that funny?

2654
02:04:55,080 --> 02:04:58,680
They their copy is so great on this website.

2655
02:04:58,920 --> 02:05:03,800
Reality is dissolved and absorbed right before your eyes into the world of Terminator.

2656
02:05:03,800 --> 02:05:08,400
The battle for the future between humans and cyborgs unfolds before your eyes.

2657
02:05:08,680 --> 02:05:13,320
A super 3D movie that makes you reflexively lean back comes up close.

2658
02:05:13,320 --> 02:05:16,280
And suddenly the hero on screen appears on stage,

2659
02:05:16,600 --> 02:05:21,160
powerfully recreated world of Terminator dissolves reality.

2660
02:05:21,160 --> 02:05:24,840
And then in a blink of an eye swallows it whole.

2661
02:05:25,600 --> 02:05:27,800
I mean, wow, that's great.

2662
02:05:27,800 --> 02:05:31,400
Description I have ever heard of a Robert Frost poem.

2663
02:05:31,440 --> 02:05:33,680
Yeah. Yeah. Wow.

2664
02:05:33,680 --> 02:05:35,280
That's that's says it.

2665
02:05:35,280 --> 02:05:36,960
I don't think that under does.

2666
02:05:36,960 --> 02:05:38,200
I love this thing.

2667
02:05:38,200 --> 02:05:42,080
And I think, yes, somewhere finally gave it to.

2668
02:05:42,320 --> 02:05:45,800
It's got to last another year, just like two years, just in case.

2669
02:05:45,840 --> 02:05:48,080
Is it in English or Japanese?

2670
02:05:48,080 --> 02:05:50,280
That was the one thing I did not look up.

2671
02:05:50,280 --> 02:05:51,560
A lot of it's in Japanese.

2672
02:05:51,560 --> 02:05:52,880
A lot of the other stuff is in Japanese.

2673
02:05:52,880 --> 02:05:54,560
I don't know specifically about this.

2674
02:05:54,560 --> 02:05:56,080
Hmm. Hmm. That's a good question.

2675
02:05:56,080 --> 02:05:59,400
I would be curious, but I do feel like I felt such a

2676
02:06:00,320 --> 02:06:04,120
a pang of regret that I missed it at Orlando by a month.

2677
02:06:04,120 --> 02:06:04,640
Oh, yeah.

2678
02:06:04,640 --> 02:06:09,280
That there's this part of me that feels so unfulfilled that I'm just like,

2679
02:06:09,760 --> 02:06:13,760
I need to make sure I get the fucking Tokyo before this thing closes down.

2680
02:06:14,040 --> 02:06:17,680
Like, I want to see it again properly through adult eyes.

2681
02:06:18,560 --> 02:06:20,960
And my girlfriend, which the last time I was on the show,

2682
02:06:20,960 --> 02:06:22,560
had never been to a theme park before.

2683
02:06:22,560 --> 02:06:25,480
We had just come from doing Disneyland for two days.

2684
02:06:25,640 --> 02:06:29,160
She wanted me to announce on this show that she is now, quote,

2685
02:06:29,400 --> 02:06:31,760
ride or die for rides.

2686
02:06:31,760 --> 02:06:33,680
Yeah.

2687
02:06:33,680 --> 02:06:37,960
Convert. So I feel like, you know, like, you know,

2688
02:06:38,520 --> 02:06:40,760
a couple of months of steady work.

2689
02:06:41,120 --> 02:06:46,280
I could very easily sell her on the idea of we have to fly to Tokyo

2690
02:06:46,480 --> 02:06:49,960
so I can see a 15 million minute Terminator film.

2691
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:51,720
You actually have to get to Osaka.

2692
02:06:51,720 --> 02:06:54,200
So further to go to Tokyo if you want.

2693
02:06:54,920 --> 02:06:57,400
That's one of those you think it's like it's just in the neighborhood.

2694
02:06:57,400 --> 02:06:59,440
It's many hours away. Yeah.

2695
02:06:59,440 --> 02:07:02,480
But next to what I keep saying next year is that

2696
02:07:02,640 --> 02:07:05,320
the first Nintendo land will be open next summer.

2697
02:07:05,360 --> 02:07:06,680
And that makes it.

2698
02:07:06,680 --> 02:07:11,560
Oh, I mean, if that's if Terminator is still open, when that is opening,

2699
02:07:11,840 --> 02:07:14,240
that's that's fully worth that.

2700
02:07:14,760 --> 02:07:16,520
And there's also an Olympics going on.

2701
02:07:16,520 --> 02:07:18,640
Well, well, that might be a negative.

2702
02:07:18,640 --> 02:07:21,120
It's very crowded and crowded.

2703
02:07:21,120 --> 02:07:26,000
In terms of like, you know, plus up ideas, you do feel like now that Cameron

2704
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:29,520
has gotten the reins back on the franchise,

2705
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:35,080
what would be nice is for him to just make a new Terminator 3D movie.

2706
02:07:35,320 --> 02:07:36,480
Oh, very nice.

2707
02:07:36,480 --> 02:07:39,280
New experience that sets up the next one.

2708
02:07:39,280 --> 02:07:41,720
The dark fate narrative. Yes. Yeah.

2709
02:07:41,960 --> 02:07:42,960
Absolutely.

2710
02:07:42,960 --> 02:07:46,840
There needs to be just another park, one Disney park,

2711
02:07:46,840 --> 02:07:49,160
and they can throw all this Fox stuff in it. Right.

2712
02:07:49,160 --> 02:07:52,280
Because Terminator feels kind of evergreen.

2713
02:07:52,520 --> 02:07:56,000
The thing that makes, I guess, made the attraction feel dated

2714
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:59,240
in universal size is that it's T2 specific.

2715
02:07:59,280 --> 02:08:00,800
You know, right.

2716
02:08:00,800 --> 02:08:03,200
But it feels like I mean, I guess the difference is we're talking about

2717
02:08:03,200 --> 02:08:07,880
like how, you know, you imagine Disney is going to find some way to exploit

2718
02:08:08,920 --> 02:08:11,360
Alien and Predator and Planet of the Apes in their parks.

2719
02:08:11,360 --> 02:08:15,160
But those are franchises that are based off of creatures,

2720
02:08:15,760 --> 02:08:18,320
like not specifically one actor, right?

2721
02:08:18,360 --> 02:08:21,400
Giving an iconic movie star performance in the same way.

2722
02:08:21,720 --> 02:08:24,640
Like, you know, Ripley is obviously huge,

2723
02:08:24,640 --> 02:08:28,720
but you can make a ride that's just the xenomorphs and people happy. Right.

2724
02:08:29,680 --> 02:08:31,920
But but this it's like it's not really a term.

2725
02:08:31,920 --> 02:08:34,240
Everything is Schwarzenegger, isn't it? Right.

2726
02:08:34,600 --> 02:08:36,920
That's yeah, he's so tied to it. Yeah.

2727
02:08:37,040 --> 02:08:39,600
I wonder if it also feels like him doing, yeah,

2728
02:08:39,600 --> 02:08:43,800
doing a new movie with just the same cast, which is what everyone wants. Right.

2729
02:08:43,840 --> 02:08:45,960
But it doesn't seem like it might extend the life,

2730
02:08:45,960 --> 02:08:49,480
unless maybe the new characters pop in a way. But it's you know, it's hard.

2731
02:08:49,480 --> 02:08:52,080
You're not going to get your new character.

2732
02:08:52,080 --> 02:08:55,240
And every time they go like this is the start of a new trilogy.

2733
02:08:55,320 --> 02:08:57,320
It doesn't. We planned out three of them.

2734
02:08:57,320 --> 02:09:01,120
Yeah, it's got to be an accident almost in the way that like apes, I mean,

2735
02:09:01,280 --> 02:09:02,720
they were probably planning those movies,

2736
02:09:02,720 --> 02:09:06,760
but like it was sort of surprising that apes was as good as it was.

2737
02:09:06,800 --> 02:09:09,280
And then the second one built on it a bunch more like,

2738
02:09:09,560 --> 02:09:12,000
maybe just set the expectation. Let's just terminate.

2739
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:14,280
The one good terminator under our right.

2740
02:09:14,720 --> 02:09:18,000
We'll see if it ever happens. Yeah, it may never happen.

2741
02:09:18,080 --> 02:09:22,160
I remember like Mick G at a comic con teasing like and comments.

2742
02:09:22,160 --> 02:09:25,200
Character is going to have a lot to do in the third movie.

2743
02:09:25,960 --> 02:09:27,880
Like that was a selling point.

2744
02:09:28,720 --> 02:09:34,800
I mean, but at least now we see a more utopian vision for common

2745
02:09:34,800 --> 02:09:40,400
because he is living in the future. He's always dreamed of the rise of the machines.

2746
02:09:40,400 --> 02:09:42,400
That's a dystopia. That future.

2747
02:09:42,400 --> 02:09:44,560
Yes. Yes. But with Microsoft,

2748
02:09:45,560 --> 02:09:47,160
common is living in the future.

2749
02:09:47,160 --> 02:09:52,240
We've always dreamed of technology connecting us in new ways.

2750
02:09:52,560 --> 02:09:54,880
The Beto O'Rourke campaign

2751
02:09:57,000 --> 02:10:00,400
crouching on coffee shop tables, knocking over drinks.

2752
02:10:01,280 --> 02:10:05,960
If what we want in presidential candidates is just meaningless platitudes,

2753
02:10:05,960 --> 02:10:07,320
why aren't we running common?

2754
02:10:07,320 --> 02:10:11,960
Yes. Common talking about a surface tablet in every American's hands.

2755
02:10:12,160 --> 02:10:15,280
Yeah. It's a candidate for the common man. Yeah.

2756
02:10:19,280 --> 02:10:20,720
Do we get there? Is there anything else?

2757
02:10:21,120 --> 02:10:23,240
Anything we missed? A volley of anything?

2758
02:10:23,240 --> 02:10:25,640
I'm sure we missed a ton of stuff. I just can't think of anything.

2759
02:10:26,320 --> 02:10:28,400
I think you don't have anything written down anymore.

2760
02:10:28,400 --> 02:10:32,400
I know we have so little on the movie and I think because you just had to be there.

2761
02:10:32,400 --> 02:10:36,000
You had to experience it. You had to battle across time yourself.

2762
02:10:36,240 --> 02:10:38,360
It had to be you had getting knocked off.

2763
02:10:38,360 --> 02:10:40,840
I did. I bought a bunch of merchandise at the store.

2764
02:10:40,840 --> 02:10:43,800
I think I probably had a T-shirt that I've lost somewhere along the way,

2765
02:10:43,800 --> 02:10:49,120
but I bought a bunch of toys, which were they took like the Terminator 2 toys

2766
02:10:49,440 --> 02:10:52,800
and repackage them in Terminator 3D packaging.

2767
02:10:53,120 --> 02:10:55,480
But they also made a T1 million.

2768
02:10:55,920 --> 02:11:00,200
They did. Which falls into your category of toys representing just park specific.

2769
02:11:00,200 --> 02:11:03,080
Yeah, exactly. But you don't have that. I don't.

2770
02:11:03,360 --> 02:11:07,040
And I think for granted now, I think it's maybe a little hard to come by

2771
02:11:07,280 --> 02:11:11,080
because it was the only one that wasn't that never got a mass release.

2772
02:11:11,080 --> 02:11:12,120
You know, right.

2773
02:11:12,120 --> 02:11:15,440
The other toys were just a packaging difference. Interesting.

2774
02:11:15,680 --> 02:11:19,600
Let's see. OK, what T1 million on eBay?

2775
02:11:19,600 --> 02:11:21,720
Yeah. I'm searching right now.

2776
02:11:21,720 --> 02:11:23,840
T2, $1 million. Yeah.

2777
02:11:25,720 --> 02:11:29,000
Actually, I don't even think it's coming up.

2778
02:11:29,040 --> 02:11:31,680
Wow. T2 3D.

2779
02:11:32,680 --> 02:11:35,080
You get until there's a Sergeant Candy toy.

2780
02:11:35,920 --> 02:11:40,080
You're going to start the candy might very quickly become your number two

2781
02:11:40,080 --> 02:11:42,040
behind Rex.

2782
02:11:42,040 --> 02:11:45,360
He might be your second is an open spot in all of media.

2783
02:11:45,360 --> 02:11:49,280
I mean, there isn't a number two or a number three or a numbers

2784
02:11:49,640 --> 02:11:51,920
four through a hundred for that.

2785
02:11:51,920 --> 02:11:53,520
So far, it's a one and done list.

2786
02:11:53,520 --> 02:11:54,280
Yep. Yeah.

2787
02:11:54,280 --> 02:11:57,320
Candy pop culture character monogamous.

2788
02:11:57,320 --> 02:12:00,640
Yes. But maybe it's time to branch out.

2789
02:12:00,800 --> 02:12:04,000
I see here that I cannot find T2 3D

2790
02:12:04,600 --> 02:12:08,360
T1 million, but I can find funny 3D print

2791
02:12:08,360 --> 02:12:11,680
Putin, Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un short sleeve casual T-shirt.

2792
02:12:11,960 --> 02:12:13,600
And they're all in like tracksuits together.

2793
02:12:13,600 --> 02:12:15,440
You know what? That's what I was thinking.

2794
02:12:15,440 --> 02:12:16,440
Yeah.

2795
02:12:16,800 --> 02:12:17,560
Post that on Twitter.

2796
02:12:17,560 --> 02:12:19,000
Send me that. That's really fun.

2797
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:20,920
Ten bucks. Ten bucks.

2798
02:12:20,920 --> 02:12:22,800
Oh, that's great. Free shipping, too.

2799
02:12:22,800 --> 02:12:27,840
I'm going to find I will send you at some point after we're done recording.

2800
02:12:28,240 --> 02:12:32,120
Can you send that the T

2801
02:12:32,360 --> 02:12:34,840
the Robocop Terminator toy?

2802
02:12:35,200 --> 02:12:37,040
So, yes. Oh, yes. Very curious about that.

2803
02:12:37,040 --> 02:12:39,320
Right. I'll create a drop box of all the toys I've ever.

2804
02:12:39,320 --> 02:12:41,280
Yes. Yes.

2805
02:12:41,280 --> 02:12:43,120
We can all access that. Right.

2806
02:12:43,800 --> 02:12:46,480
And it'll all be uploaded to Skynet.

2807
02:12:46,480 --> 02:12:48,560
Yes. Yeah, we're soon enough.

2808
02:12:49,280 --> 02:12:52,240
Griffin Newman, once again, you have survived podcasts.

2809
02:12:52,240 --> 02:12:53,440
The right. I was trying to think.

2810
02:12:53,440 --> 02:12:56,560
I was trying to find the script while we were talking so I could do like the actual.

2811
02:12:56,560 --> 02:13:00,160
Oh, the end. So once again, we have found ourselves.

2812
02:13:00,160 --> 02:13:06,520
Yeah. Amused by the toy observations of a wonderful guest.

2813
02:13:06,800 --> 02:13:09,280
You do feel like you've survived at the end of this, right?

2814
02:13:09,280 --> 02:13:12,240
I mean, it is a real like we accomplished something here today.

2815
02:13:12,240 --> 02:13:14,000
Yeah. Yeah.

2816
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:17,840
Futures. I think mainly we accomplished it not being three hours.

2817
02:13:17,840 --> 02:13:20,760
But yes, we'll keep stepping up the link.

2818
02:13:20,760 --> 02:13:26,000
And hey, you knew it was a great ride because it had a dash and a colon.

2819
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:26,960
Yeah. Yeah.

2820
02:13:26,960 --> 02:13:29,080
Double pump. Yeah.

2821
02:13:29,080 --> 02:13:30,640
Yes. Our favorites.

2822
02:13:30,640 --> 02:13:34,440
Just build up your girlfriend to be ride or die for complicated punctuation.

2823
02:13:34,440 --> 02:13:35,920
And then she really made it.

2824
02:13:35,920 --> 02:13:38,880
Yeah. We're still at the point in our relationship where she doesn't understand

2825
02:13:38,880 --> 02:13:41,120
why I get worked up about that.

2826
02:13:41,160 --> 02:13:43,960
She now gets why I get excited about rides.

2827
02:13:43,960 --> 02:13:47,760
She's like, who cares what the thing is called in due time?

2828
02:13:47,760 --> 02:13:49,040
Sure. She'll get there.

2829
02:13:49,040 --> 02:13:51,760
BVS Dawn of Justice. Why Dawn?

2830
02:13:54,120 --> 02:13:56,960
And what's the what's the new Terminator again?

2831
02:13:56,960 --> 02:13:58,360
Dark Fate. Dark Fate.

2832
02:13:58,360 --> 02:14:00,400
Dark Fate. OK.

2833
02:14:00,400 --> 02:14:02,000
Yeah. Turn your dark shadows.

2834
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,600
The Tick Season two is just the Tick Season two.

2835
02:14:04,600 --> 02:14:06,280
It's not. No, there's no.

2836
02:14:06,280 --> 02:14:09,200
It's a Tick Season two Robin season.

2837
02:14:09,320 --> 02:14:10,480
No, there's no.

2838
02:14:12,640 --> 02:14:17,000
We're not doing the the Stranger Things argument that it's not a second season.

2839
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:18,440
It's a sequel.

2840
02:14:18,440 --> 02:14:24,880
It is a classic good old American season two and 10 episodes all on Amazon Prime.

2841
02:14:24,880 --> 02:14:26,800
Great. Great. Check it out.

2842
02:14:26,800 --> 02:14:30,640
Uh, and the podcast, which I've been listening to it since you've been here.

2843
02:14:30,880 --> 02:14:34,040
But but take please watch watch early and watch often.

2844
02:14:35,280 --> 02:14:38,000
Streaming landscape is the Wild West these days.

2845
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:39,800
It sure is. Keep refreshing.

2846
02:14:39,800 --> 02:14:42,440
Yeah. You and Peter Serafinovitz together are so funny.

2847
02:14:42,440 --> 02:14:43,560
Thank you. As a duo.

2848
02:14:43,560 --> 02:14:45,600
It's delightful. Thank you.

2849
02:14:45,600 --> 02:14:48,120
I thank you. Thank you for coming to the you.

2850
02:14:48,320 --> 02:14:52,120
You saw you're one of the few people who has seen the premiere.

2851
02:14:52,120 --> 02:14:55,280
Yeah. And you guys were very funny on on panel, too.

2852
02:14:55,400 --> 02:14:57,360
Thank you. Thank you.

2853
02:14:57,720 --> 02:15:01,160
We it's one of the reasons I want the show to keep going

2854
02:15:01,440 --> 02:15:06,400
is that we all actually like each other, which I think for all of us,

2855
02:15:06,400 --> 02:15:10,640
we know how rare it is that there isn't at least one gigantic asshole in a group.

2856
02:15:11,200 --> 02:15:13,440
And usually they bring the whole thing down.

2857
02:15:13,880 --> 02:15:17,000
And so like every time we get to do like a convention or promo thing,

2858
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:19,640
we're like, this is like great. We get to like hang out.

2859
02:15:19,640 --> 02:15:21,480
Like we want to have dinner together.

2860
02:15:21,480 --> 02:15:24,440
Yeah. We like being in break rooms together. Sure.

2861
02:15:24,480 --> 02:15:29,880
So I just, you know, I don't want to go back into the wilds of pilot season.

2862
02:15:30,360 --> 02:15:31,680
It's somewhat less appealing.

2863
02:15:31,680 --> 02:15:35,600
You never know when you're going to get cast on like a lethal weapon, you know,

2864
02:15:36,200 --> 02:15:37,760
with people. Oh, right.

2865
02:15:37,760 --> 02:15:40,560
Oh, yeah. Daily basis. Right. Right. Yes.

2866
02:15:40,760 --> 02:15:43,080
Have you thought about getting back into improv classes?

2867
02:15:43,080 --> 02:15:45,960
I've never been a time to start taking classes.

2868
02:15:45,960 --> 02:15:48,720
Yeah, I have thought about it. Yes. Orlando. Yes. Of course.

2869
02:15:48,720 --> 02:15:50,360
Yeah. Yeah. Sure. Oh, boy.

2870
02:15:50,360 --> 02:15:52,560
