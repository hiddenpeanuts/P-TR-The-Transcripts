1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Forever.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Dog.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Warning, the following podcasts may contain middle-aged ghosts, tedious boat lines, askew elevators, and a themed hotel that started with an intricate story that had to be experienced throughout three attractions in sequential order, but now is just a place where people do e-sports and carrot top does prop comedy.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
It's the Luxor on Podcast the Ride, Sin City Nights.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Welcome to Podcast the Ride, Sin City Nights, the sleazy desert cousin of Podcast the Ride, much like Snoopy's cousin Spike. I'm Scott Gertner, joined by Jason Sheridan.

6
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:06,000
That's right, we're like Spike. We grew those long mustache danglies.

7
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Yeah, those very concerted, we all grew eight hairs, eight thick hairs out of our face, that's all we can do, Mike Carlson.

8
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm here and I've also grown those long mustache danglies, says Jason, it's not just a long mustache, they're mustache danglies, in case you don't know.

9
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:33,000
It's a desert term, is what it is. Yeah. You'd know if you were sleezing around in the desert, says we have been.

10
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Well that's what Spike is, he's a desert guy. You know? Yes. Yeah. That's what I said, but yes. Yeah.

11
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm agreeing with you. Now this I was checking the levels, so to be fair, I wasn't zoned out, I had things to do.

12
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I came in with show energy. I had things to do, I'm sorry.

13
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
For sure, no, your ability to focus for the most part, given that you're riding the levels, is admirable.

14
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Listen, I'm going to dive right in with something that is not Vegas related, and I don't want it to take over the episode, and I fear that it may open Pandora's box.

15
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:14,000
All right. But I feel like I got to say it because it is part of the series, even though it's not Vegas related.

16
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:21,000
And it is this, if you can imagine, I've been doing some further thinking about Space Mountain fans.

17
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:30,000
This came up in the MGM Grand episode two weeks ago. There was a little discussion of disagreement.

18
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
You might say a loss on my part, that was how I chalked it up in the episode.

19
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:56,000
The notion came up of whether Space Mountain speed is partially simulated due to the fans, due to fans that are potentially blown on you, that blow cold air as if to simulate space travel or something that a faster roller coaster might do.

20
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Right. This was something that Jason brought up. I balked at this notion.

21
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Mike went a Googling and you discovered enough results that made me feel in that moment as if perhaps though I balked, it seemed like, well, that's enough people who have maybe brought up the idea that the speed of Space Mountain is simulated with cold air fans.

22
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I didn't like taking the loss. It didn't feel good to me. I kept thinking about it.

23
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It seems like you didn't stop there.

24
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,000
No, no. If you can imagine, it seems like the best thing to do in the moment was just to admit defeat.

25
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,000
But I've realized that the best thing to do for the podcast in general is to rip this thread wide open again.

26
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Hey, in Vegas, you got to double down, you know.

27
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Yeah, I wonder if I already did. I think this might be a triple down on my part.

28
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'm reopening this again. And here's why.

29
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I felt a little pummeled by the amount of source. This is what you were indicating where you were sitting. Mike was like, I don't know. There's a lot of things that are bringing this up.

30
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I started feeling like, well, if there's a number of them and not just one weird source, then maybe I should admit defeat here.

31
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,000
But as I'm thinking about it, I'm like, what are these sources exactly? And I went looking. I looked in a couple of places.

32
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Theme Park Center. Yeah, we all know theme park. We're all hanging out on theme park.

33
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
That one on the episode, I said one that one out as like a do we know that?

34
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
And we're like, maybe we don't. I'm looking at we've never been to theme park center.

35
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:32,000
We've never been to the travel dot com. We've never been to an expired Tumblr called Disneyland secrets.

36
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:40,000
And then the main source and this was obviously flagged when it came up was that this this fact was touted by inside the magic.

37
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I don't know if they're the most trustworthy. If their headline is ladies still swooning over Johnny Depp's perfect abs, you can, you know, audiences demand Johnny Depp's rippling abs back in the Pirates franchise.

38
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You can trust them on that. Anything depth related. I'll give that to them. That's their beat.

39
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:07,000
They were on a terror about woke Cinderella this week. Woke live action Cinderella. Right.

40
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:14,000
And the right one that happened already. No, it's going to Rachel Zeigler Academy Award winner Rachel Zeigler.

41
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Are you sure that Disney didn't already remake Cinderella? I'm sorry. Snow White Snow White. I get them always. I get them mixed up.

42
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Oh, my God. Yeah. All right. Well, yeah. So they you know, they have their things that yeah, they're they're experts on woke culture.

43
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
But are they experts on Space Mountain fans? I don't know. I looked at their article. This is how much I want to.

44
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I'm really sorry that I clicked and came close to giving them any ad revenue or anything, but I did give them a page click.

45
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:56,000
And it's one of those in classic Inside the Magic fashion. It's like Disneyland is a park that has entertainment over the like let's let's do 19 paragraphs where we say every key phrase in theme park world and

46
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
By petal humans enjoy amusement and vacationing.

47
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,000
It names. It's like you have to get through the entire existence of man. They go through the Book of Genesis.

48
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:13,000
They Jesus is discussed for a while. And then before and then finally they bury what you're actually there for.

49
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:20,000
And they say, well, a fan figured out that actually fans are used to simulate the speed of and then it's just it's a tick tock.

50
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:27,000
It's something called the mouse lits and they say, did you know that fans are used to simulate cold air on the all right for more facts.

51
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Check out the mouse lits on and I just started thinking, where is the good source on this? Yeah.

52
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Where is and I'm this isn't about me saying Jason's wrong. I actually would like to take that out of it in this.

53
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I'm just trying to figure out what's what I'm trying to take fake news out of the equation because I think we're dealing with a lot of fake news here.

54
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:58,000
And in what I've just said of where this is discussed, what haven't I said I founded on Jim Hill, Lentesta Expedition theme park, Martin's vids.

55
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:07,000
None of these sources that we usually go to that we usually tout say anything about Space Mountain simulating with cold fan.

56
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Now there's also some Reddit threads about it. Right.

57
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
And I'll give it that. But but I don't know if you can trust a TIL today.

58
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I learned as a definitive source on this issue and I'm not saying there isn't a definitive source out there.

59
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:36,000
This is just this is why I bring it up. I want to know I want a source that we can trust to verify that fans are used on Space Mountain to simulate that it doesn't actually because I'm just not I don't see the proof.

60
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I'm not buying it right now. Truthfully, I had already forgotten about this and I thought you were talking about Space Mountain like enthusiasts and I was like, oh God, what discourse did I miss this in between the like, you know, Haunted Mansion going like I'm going to run to the rallies next door for a burger to calm down.

61
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:09,000
You know, like the product placement, the aggressive product place, the the recent Internet trend where I wake up every day and learn a new of like bizarre thing about the Haunted Mansion movie.

62
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Yeah, no, it's been it's been a pummeling lately. A lot of strange decisions. Yeah, apparently I haven't seen it. But apparently it's like, let me get out a pad and paper that I got at CVS.

63
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Really weird. No, no, no, you moved on, Jason. You moved a lot. You took your victory and you moved on and I stayed in the weeds. I said, wait a minute, wait a minute. And I've been I've been connecting yarn on pins ever since Charlie Day meme or yes, I am a living Charlie Day meme right now.

64
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Right.

65
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:56,000
But what do you now that now that I've brought all this up emotionally, Jason, are you like, go ahead, do your thing or do you feel confident in this fact? Still, do you think I'm the crazy one? Do you think it's possible that I will be disproven again? Or I don't know.

66
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:18,000
How are you feeling that I bring? No, I'm happy to see. I mean, I, I, you know, when I brought it up, it was mostly going off of like memory and, you know, going through the lights on once or twice on both coasts, you know, and like, I swear I saw a fan and like, it's very cold on my face going through here.

67
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:31,000
It seems far too cold for it to be 35 miles per hour. It's a cold room. I'll give you that. I say what we said the previous time this came up. I don't doubt that it's possible that there are fans in that building.

68
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:52,000
But that to me is different than fans with the explicit purpose of blowing on you. The writer, like if you think about the physics of it, Aaron brought this up back. She was like, if you stuck your if you were driving 35 miles an hour and you stuck your head out the window, you would be getting a general wind flow there.

69
00:09:52,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Right? Yeah. Yeah. Imagine what would have to get added to that to register to even like enhance the effect. You know, that would have to be they would have to be like head on fans in that instance. Correct. Which seems harder to do in my mind because where would you put the fan?

70
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:25,000
There's that one need to be in the car with it. Just be super powerful air conditioners. I mean, making it colder traditional fan for you. You know, I think you have to count a big air conditioning unit and a fan that's a traditional.

71
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Well, again, I that's a good point. I do think that I mean, if I think there is air conditioning in the building, that's not what you pointed. If it's like an air conditioning unit pointed at you on like a turn.

72
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Turn that one because I don't know what is one going to do? The facts is implied by inside the magic and the mouse. Let's and my beef is with them, not with you, Jason. At this point, this being presented definitively as if this is a crucial part of the space.

73
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Can we contact the mouse lits and find out who are they? I would love that. That's a viable way. First of all, who are the mouse lits? Where? Secondly, where are you getting your information from?

74
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Are they just tick tock only? First of all, I'm going to become a mouse lits fan regardless of what the answer to these questions are, because do you have a tick tock account? Do I? I do. But I'm not. I'm not post or anything.

75
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Just for lurking. I yes, I lurk on a lot of places. Yeah. Reddit. Oh, I know. Yeah, that's part of my thing. I lurk. Yeah. So Pleasure Island Facebook group. Pleasure Island Facebook group. I love the pleasure Island Facebook group. Yeah. So I think okay. If it's air conditioning units, you would consider though that Jason was still correct. I'm not saying that's not even a discussion of would it matter? It's not. I to me. Here's where I'm drawing the line. If there are air conditioning units, I'm not saying that's not even a discussion of would it matter.

76
00:11:42,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Here's where I'm drawing the line. If there are air conditioning units in the building, that's not enough. Not enough. I agree here from a source that's quoting an Imagineer or somebody involved in the ride that there were especially large amount of air conditioning units put into Space Mountain.

77
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:27,340
Good looking. And your

78
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:32,340
that gets the speed. So I'm willing to say I'm wrong.

79
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:36,340
Yeah, sure. Well, which is again why I'd like to divide it. I think

80
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:40,340
I think the beef is not here. I think my beef is with these

81
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:44,340
sources that are quoting nothing because I like here you are maybe

82
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:48,340
bending what you think is happening in there and that's great. These places

83
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:52,340
that have published this thought with zero evidence.

84
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:56,340
Yeah, that's why I think what I I'm sure I'm trying to take these guys down.

85
00:12:56,340 --> 00:13:00,340
I'm trying to take theme theme park center. You're in my crosshairs already gone

86
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:04,340
Tumblr Disneyland secrets. You're in my career. That's why they're gone

87
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:08,340
because they're publishing. I think so. News. I mean also in

88
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:12,340
addition to this, I because there are reddit there's a number of reddit threads

89
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:16,340
saying this is possible. But in the comments of those reddit threads you also have people

90
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:20,340
saying I don't know how this myth got started. And I've also

91
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:24,340
I also and I don't know if you could trust this but somebody said my professor

92
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:28,340
was an Imagineer who worked on the original design for this exact ride at Disneyland. He confirmed

93
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:32,340
that there were no such fans along the track. I don't

94
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:36,340
know. You can't trust that maybe as much as or you could more than you could trust

95
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:40,340
anybody on reddit. But isn't this I'm just

96
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:44,340
interesting. I think it's interesting. That's more why I bring it up than any particular

97
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:48,340
thing. However, I will acknowledge this that this does

98
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:52,340
go back to you said something I scoffed. I

99
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:56,340
seem to have been proven wrong in the moment and I might be proven wrong again. So though I don't

100
00:13:56,340 --> 00:14:00,340
want to keep it personal Jason. Here's what I'm going to offer. If anyone

101
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:04,340
and this is where the listeners come in. I say contact who you got to contact.

102
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:08,340
Let's start digging things up. I'll save you the work of watching

103
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:12,340
the behind the attraction episode that Disney put out because I did

104
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:16,340
and there is no mention of the fans. But if we I think I think this is very possibly a job

105
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:20,340
for Jim and Lynn. If anybody feels like. Yeah yeah yeah.

106
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:24,340
There was ever a job. This is a big one. I think but if I am proven

107
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:28,340
definitively wrong in a way that we can all agree on. Here's

108
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:32,340
what I will offer you Jason. Oh my gosh. On three occasions

109
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:36,340
in theme parks or generally themed environments or just anywhere out in the world.

110
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:40,340
If we are near a place where a treat can be

111
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:44,340
purchased or achieved. I will not only purchase you this treat.

112
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:48,340
I will offer up the humiliation factor of if you

113
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:52,340
to know that you are in the mood for a treat. I will allow you to say

114
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:56,340
oh treat boy and then

115
00:14:56,340 --> 00:15:00,340
I will go and buy you and will pay for on three occasions.

116
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:04,340
I will do this. I want there to be speaks to this. That's how much

117
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:08,340
I am I'm invested in this thing and would like to figure this out.

118
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:12,340
Hungry. I will

119
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:16,340
accept that. That can be part of it. You can't you can say hung we with a W.

120
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:20,340
So listener and I think it would probably behoove this entire

121
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:24,340
situation if all three of those were filmed and posted to our social

122
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:28,340
media. Oh yeah. So that's what I'm

123
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:32,340
putting out there. I don't want to you know

124
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:36,340
I'm more invested in this than you are maybe so I don't want to force you to

125
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:40,340
do anything but I would put out the possibility of if I'm correct

126
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:44,340
and proven definitively correct. If on one occasion

127
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:48,340
I am in the mood for wine. Yeah I was going to say do you

128
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:52,340
want some wine. Monsieur. Monsieur.

129
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:56,340
I do like that. I mean I was just going to do the same of a wine boy.

130
00:15:56,340 --> 00:16:00,340
Maybe you follow it up with like a wood varietal Monsieur.

131
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:04,340
I mean I think all

132
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:08,340
of us are having fun either way. It keeps it in the run of fun if mild

133
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:12,340
humiliation for somebody. But does everybody sign off on this plan?

134
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:16,340
Sure. Yeah we have an impartial witness. I think you can help weigh

135
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:20,340
in on this. If you're feel free to make a ruling of I'm

136
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:24,340
sorry Scott this does seem like a credible source. But I really

137
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:28,340
feel like it's got an imagineer has to be involved. There's got to be a book.

138
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:32,340
It has to be because I think Disney likes to reveal their little secrets.

139
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:36,340
I think typically some of them yeah. Yeah yeah some they keep mysterious like a

140
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:40,340
Haunted Mansion thing like what you know which CVS the pen in the pad came from.

141
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:44,340
Yeah they're sharing a reveal ad in the film. But otherwise I think they

142
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:48,340
like to own up to this stuff and I think it's suspicious that this has never been.

143
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:52,340
Well I completely agree with what you're saying. On the Disneyland

144
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:56,340
Space Mountain there is a large like asteroid or something

145
00:16:56,340 --> 00:17:00,340
that you know what I'm talking about. When we first enter sort of space. Yeah.

146
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:04,340
And you're slowly waiting to actually hit the fast part of the ride. Yeah. And you

147
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:08,340
can't really see it. You kind of have to squint to see it. Sure. And I'm just wondering like

148
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:12,340
does it count if like there's a fan somewhere pointed at

149
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:16,340
the car up there even. And you're saying it's like

150
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:20,340
part of space atmosphere. Right.

151
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:24,340
So it's even before the speed happens. No I think this is about

152
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:28,340
speed. And even though I think Jason's point of view on this

153
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:32,340
is adjusting. I accept that to create a spacey

154
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:36,340
cool atmosphere that there are little like swirls and gusts

155
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:40,340
of air conditioning. That makes sense to me. But again I'm going to the

156
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:44,340
letter of the law here with these articles and I'm saying that these I think it has to be involved

157
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:48,340
in the simulation of the speed. Specifically. Specifically

158
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:52,340
speed. I think so. Because that's the part that I think is

159
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:56,340
weird. I think ultimately the ride doesn't go that fast. Right.

160
00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:00,340
But these are big weighty vehicles. And I think you have to have absolute

161
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:04,340
cannons to have any impact beyond what just gravity

162
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:08,340
is already doing. And like the tightness of the turns.

163
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:12,340
I think that's in the darkness as we said. Well I will say this

164
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:16,340
I will be impartial. On the

165
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:20,340
hyperspace mountain it is a lot more lit up in there.

166
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:24,340
So I guess we would have seen. I'm trying to think where the fans

167
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:28,340
would be. I feel like you would have seen something. Well and not only that

168
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:32,340
there's a lot of ride through. You know everybody's get. If anybody gets the chance

169
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:36,340
to ride space mount with the lights on they're turning their camera on. Yeah that's

170
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:40,340
true. And they're putting it to YouTube. You can watch YouTube's. I don't see where these fans.

171
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:44,340
I don't even see like big old fans at the top of the building. I'm not seeing fans.

172
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:48,340
Sometimes I'll see a little something and I'll say could it be. And then I think that's a camera.

173
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:52,340
I think that's a speaker. But if. But if. This is another way a listener can be helpful. If you

174
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:56,340
want to go through videos like that. Yeah. In Peru. And don't just photoshop

175
00:18:56,340 --> 00:19:00,340
fans in there. I want to see.

176
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:06,340
There has to be a way to verify. And if. Don't just take a picture from a Sears catalog.

177
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:10,340
And just drop it into a frame.

178
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:14,340
I don't know. I want to see what talents our listeners have.

179
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:18,340
I would like to see that. I would like to see their photoshop skills. If you do that then you have to say

180
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:22,340
parody like the rules of Twitter. I'm sorry.

181
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:26,340
Or XR now. Where if you're going to do a parody account of something

182
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:30,340
it has to say parentheses parody. And don't bring like a big

183
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:34,340
office fan on the ride with you and during the photo op hold it up.

184
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:38,340
That's not funny and it's dangerous. I'd say it's very dangerous.

185
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:44,340
I mean it's funny. I take it back. Yeah. I was going to say it's very funny. It's funny but it's dangerous and don't do it and then we'll be responsible.

186
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:48,340
So don't do that either. If it just drops and it doesn't hit you

187
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:52,340
then you got cars below you. Two employees. A lot of bad things can happen here.

188
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:56,340
I don't know. So don't do that. I don't want it to become the new Flash Mountain

189
00:19:56,340 --> 00:20:00,340
where people are bringing fans on the actual ride.

190
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:04,340
I would be impressed if you were able to smuggle one and then like

191
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:08,340
be in a seat belt. Is it a pull down? What is it on Space Mountain?

192
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:12,340
Yeah it's a pull down I believe. Oh then how are you even. Boy.

193
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:16,340
Or is it lap? I can't remember. Oh it's lap. It's pull back on lap.

194
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:20,340
Oh okay. I've only been on it a hundred times.

195
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:24,340
Yeah right. It's just been a while. Yeah it has. I oddly have not been on Space Mountain

196
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:28,340
in a while. And maybe if I went I would plainly see fans right away.

197
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:32,340
That's possible. And realize the foolishness of my way. I might get kicked down

198
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:36,340
real fast here but I'm willing to do it because I think it's interesting.

199
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:40,340
I think it becomes a little hunt that the audience can help with.

200
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:44,340
You know hey everybody's a winner if Jim or Len get involved.

201
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:48,340
Let's just see what happens here. Well Len tried to do a big one. I am very willing to be.

202
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:52,340
I think I was using fans and air conditioning like strong air conditioning

203
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:56,340
interchangeably. I just like. There's a lot of air flow.

204
00:20:56,340 --> 00:21:00,340
The fans is enough repeated online that I think you probably saw that somewhere.

205
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:04,340
Probably infected yeah something in my brain. Oh and a listener

206
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:08,340
said like I've known my mom told me about this when I was growing up. I thought this was common knowledge.

207
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:12,340
And I hate to be I don't mean to be sounding like your mom was wrong.

208
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:16,340
But is it possible that this is one of those like urban myth things

209
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:20,340
that sounds cool. I like the idea of it. Yeah I just don't know if I buy it

210
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:24,340
in practice. I'm being a skeptic here. Sure. Well we'll find

211
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:28,340
I think we'll find out quickly. I think so too. And boy and we

212
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:32,340
will try to you know we'll just make a moment. If

213
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:36,340
it happens quickly and I'm wrong we'll try to make a moment happen quickly where I am

214
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:40,340
I become treat boy and I'm forced to fetch a treat for Jason.

215
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:44,340
We'll knock one of those out in a non-theme park environment. We'll just run to downtown Burbank.

216
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:48,340
You good with the Ben and Jerry's? Yeah I was going to say yeah plenty of basketball.

217
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:52,340
He's good with the prices of Ben and Jerry's. That's six thousand my friend.

218
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:56,340
Yeah. Hey you know maybe I'll put on a little costume too.

219
00:21:56,340 --> 00:22:00,340
We're going to have fun either way.

220
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:04,340
These are the stakes and I'm sorry that's a bunch of non-vegas but

221
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:08,340
it's a runner in the series now. We'll find out by the end of the series. No maybe

222
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:12,340
hit a local. Yummy cupcakes is pretty convenient for most spots in

223
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:16,340
Burbank. That is the real business. How much is a cupcake? I don't know I haven't

224
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:20,340
been in a little while. I would assume a few dollars at least.

225
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:24,340
I feel like there were like four dollars. I feel like there were four dollars

226
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:28,340
like ten years ago. So I don't know. I feel like

227
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:32,340
reasonably it has to be a treat for one person to have. I feel

228
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:36,340
like it cannot be a dozen of something

229
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:40,340
and then you like put them in the fridge. Well I feel like when I've had

230
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:44,340
it before you're either buying one or you're buying a box of the four

231
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:48,340
big ones and you're taking them to something or

232
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:52,340
splitting. Oh I'm not going to make you buy a box of cupcakes. Like I'm not.

233
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:56,340
The price of cupcakes nowadays you know. Well thank you for taking

234
00:22:56,340 --> 00:23:00,340
that into consideration. There's a crumble cookie coming.

235
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:04,340
That's a chain. That's a popular chain. We should probably get to Vegas before we list every

236
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:08,340
different treat in Burbank. Specifically in localizing.

237
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:12,340
I haven't called that localizing in a while. Well Randy's donuts by the airport is delicious.

238
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:16,340
Cookie dough dreams over downtown Burbank. Yeah you know I've had that a couple times.

239
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:20,340
I don't like it that much. They do strawberries sometimes. No you're right we're done. We're going back

240
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:24,340
to Vegas. We're going to a different

241
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:28,340
strange piece of sloped architecture

242
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:32,340
with rides inside multiple rides inside. We're talking about the Luxor.

243
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:36,340
The of course the Egyptian

244
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:40,340
themed hotel and casino.

245
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:44,340
Which I think has gone a little astray. I think it's lost

246
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:48,340
a little. Yeah yeah yeah. I mean we'll get into that.

247
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:52,340
I think as with all this is a great example of

248
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:56,340
the theme that will come up you know multiple times in this series

249
00:23:56,340 --> 00:24:00,340
of the family friendly Vegas of the 90's where now they've made efforts to make it

250
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:04,340
just kind of generic and all the stuff you'd usually want

251
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:08,340
in a casino but in the 90's this was

252
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:12,340
an indoor theme park. This was like the primary thing

253
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:16,340
almost was like a new concept in a

254
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:20,340
themed entertainment center. It was nuts. It was nuts in the 90's. Yeah one of

255
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:24,340
the most ambitious themed experience of like three

256
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:28,340
interconnected attractions and a

257
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:32,340
boat ride that goes around the lobby. Like a boat ride

258
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:36,340
with pretty bad per hour ridership I believe. Very bad

259
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:40,340
I believe. Very bad. Yeah. Well this is the experimental nature of it.

260
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:44,340
There's a lot they were just they were willing to try all of this stuff as

261
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:48,340
foolish as it might be. Badly priced or as badly

262
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:52,340
enumerated as it might be. But it's

263
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:56,340
really notable and worth talking about and a lot of things about it that are like

264
00:24:56,340 --> 00:25:00,340
just big and unprecedented and stupid.

265
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:04,340
And that's why it deserved an episode here on the main strip. Yeah it is stupid

266
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:08,340
and I knew a little of it but then like just watching and reading you just like

267
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:12,340
oh my god. Like they really

268
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:16,340
gave them like carte blanche to just make up their own mythology

269
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:20,340
and make up characters and make up technology

270
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:24,340
and like stuff that doesn't even seem like it would be popular. It seems

271
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:28,340
like this would be. Yeah. Not because of any

272
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:32,340
lack of effort on the part. Right. Or imagination. Masters putting this thing together

273
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:36,340
but it just sounds like maybe we just we know this

274
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:40,340
in retrospect because we've seen a lot of things like this

275
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:44,340
where it's not IP and it's an original world and that's cool and to be

276
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:48,340
commended but it's certainly everything you hear about the story of it and the world of it

277
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:52,340
you're like that sounds like something that will not do well. Of course. Unfortunately it's

278
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:56,340
way up our alley. We love it but yeah. For like again like dads especially

279
00:25:56,340 --> 00:26:00,340
90s dads. Yeah. Oh yeah they're going to track like this

280
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:04,340
pre-Egyptian like society. It's a story

281
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:08,340
that takes place in past present and future. A perfect pyramid

282
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:12,340
of tales. Yeah and like it's just so it just seems so like

283
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:16,340
impenetrable to know what's going on versus just any like generic

284
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:20,340
Disney thing where it's like pirates are yelling at you. Got it. Great. You are

285
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:24,340
in a haunted mansion. That is true. You know what and I was going to open

286
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:28,340
the bigger narrative of why doesn't original

287
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:32,340
theme park IP work better out in the world. We love

288
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:36,340
what look what's original pirates and haunted mansion and you answered it right there.

289
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:40,340
You understand what those are before you're even in the gate. You look at the

290
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:44,340
sign. I don't think you understand you need a lot of

291
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:48,340
explanation to figure out what is it all called. It's all called secrets of the Luxor

292
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:52,340
pyramid. Yeah. And yeah that doesn't tell you much

293
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:56,340
of any that doesn't tell you you're going to be time traveling and with archaeologists. No and it's

294
00:26:56,340 --> 00:27:00,340
by the way I love this. Yeah I really do. I think there's better

295
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:04,340
versions of what they conceived of that would have worked much better.

296
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:08,340
But I do love it as an idea and a concept so I don't want to say I don't want to

297
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:12,340
put it down but it's not like oh yeah you're going to go get chased by

298
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:16,340
a mummy or something. Oh it's Egypt. Got it. It's mummies. It's pharaohs

299
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:20,340
done. You're right. Maybe it should have been a little more basic

300
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:24,340
Maybe. Maybe. And there's things that are basic. I'm

301
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:28,340
actually I'm going to propose here backing up a little bit and like entering the building

302
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:32,340
because there are things about this place that are very impressive and unprecedented

303
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:36,340
before you even get in there. Yes. You know beyond just the

304
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:40,340
attractions. So let me step it back to

305
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:44,340
opening which is October 14th 1993. It's 93

306
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:48,340
like all of the 93 now it's clear the end of 93 the peak of

307
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:52,340
the pyramid peak of insane family. Yeah. Las Vegas. Because I think

308
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:56,340
Treasure Island. Treasure Island. Pirate shows around then. Luxor

309
00:27:56,340 --> 00:28:00,340
and MGM Grand. Luxor only for

310
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:04,340
like a few days was the tallest building

311
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:08,340
I think on the strip and then Treasure Island immediately built

312
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:12,340
beat it. Wow. Oh weird. Oh that's crazy.

313
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:16,340
It's also I mean first things first it is an actual

314
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:20,340
pyramid and it's not built in some fake way

315
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:24,340
that makes it not a pyramid. It's not a simulation of a pyramid. It's a real

316
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:28,340
pyramid and as such it's one of the tallest

317
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:32,340
pyramids ever built. It's taller than only two

318
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:36,340
of the actual Egyptian pyramids. So it's in the top ten pyramids

319
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:40,340
ever built. It's I forget the amount of like

320
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:44,340
is there a bigger pyramid. Oh well if you can't you know what's a pyramid is the

321
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:48,340
Transamerica pyramid in San Francisco

322
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:52,340
which has some other there's like a more of a traditional building shape. Right.

323
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:56,340
Caked into it but you know what I mean the San Francisco pointy building. There's an

324
00:28:56,340 --> 00:29:00,340
interactive like chart where you can see how big it is compared to other

325
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:04,340
stuff. Unfortunately it did not include the Bass Pro Shop

326
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:08,340
pyramid. No I know. I mean that's the only we have the same

327
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:12,340
thought we're looking at real history stacked up against the Luxor and we're both like

328
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:16,340
yeah but what's the where's the pyramid I know. Yeah. The weird one in Memphis.

329
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:20,340
I guess it's too small. It doesn't rate. Right.

330
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:24,340
But the Luxor rated. The Luxor is huge. Thirty six stories.

331
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:28,340
Entire establishment three hundred seventy five million dollars to open.

332
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:32,340
Built by but no longer owned by

333
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:36,340
Circus Circus. So I think there's a through line and we aren't

334
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:40,340
doing an episode about Circus Circus this round but Circus Circus

335
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:44,340
we're talking about like why does all this happen. The the family vacation

336
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:48,340
of Vegas and some of it you got a tribute to Mirage I think that that's a big

337
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:52,340
Disneyland free attraction and that

338
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:56,340
popped a lot of eyes. But then Circus Circus has got to

339
00:29:56,340 --> 00:30:00,340
get a lot of credit too. Even though that was going since

340
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:04,340
the 60s right. I mean that and yeah. The guy's name is J

341
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:08,340
Sarno. I didn't find enough about him to make him like an official guy. Right.

342
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:12,340
The thing that we did but the he sees his powers too and

343
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:16,340
it he kind of combined. How do we lure people in well with some

344
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:20,340
big gaudy theme. And so he kind of

345
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:24,340
revolutionized Vegas in that way. So I guess it makes sense

346
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:28,340
that Circus Circus thinks what else can we do. How do we go further

347
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:32,340
and how do we kind of like Disney Worldify elsewhere

348
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:36,340
on the strip. So they're responsible then for Excalibur.

349
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:40,340
Which is like

350
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:44,340
I mean I remember hearing about Excalibur when I was a kid.

351
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:48,340
Get me there. I want I love Disneyland.

352
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:52,340
But I don't get to stay in the castle. Yeah. I get to live

353
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:56,340
in a castle. Like not knowing the actual vibe. Right.

354
00:30:56,340 --> 00:31:00,340
Excalibur would be if I were to go. Yeah. Yeah.

355
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:04,340
I mean I still felt that whenever I the first time I went to Vegas was like

356
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:08,340
2007 and even just seeing Excalibur even in its like decaying

357
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:12,340
state I was like hell yes. I didn't stay there but it was still

358
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:16,340
like that kid kid brain of like yeah. Yeah. I want to stay in that

359
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:20,340
dumb castle. Yeah. Yeah. You also I love looks or

360
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:24,340
for the existence of it if not in practice. I like

361
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:28,340
in the same way that I love all these where as

362
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:32,340
the stuff pops up in the early 90s and I was saying I think some of it's got to come from like

363
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:36,340
Disney Decade and Eisner era that there's a pyramid

364
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:40,340
next to a castle. Yeah. And then you're not far

365
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:44,340
from the pirate ship and the it is like it really starts to feel like

366
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:48,340
Disney World where you're like here's the here's the Hawaiian one and here's the future one and

367
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:52,340
here's the Caribbean one. Yeah. I mean I like that stupidity

368
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:56,340
of Vegas. What makes it feel like a big miniature golf course. Yeah.

369
00:31:56,340 --> 00:32:00,340
Yeah. Just like random landmarks. Yeah. Yeah.

370
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:04,340
And various monorails and people movers connecting

371
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:08,340
true each other. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. With an aesthetic that has nothing

372
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:12,340
to do with the hotels that it's passing by. You're right. That is exactly like Disney

373
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:16,340
World. This is probably at the root of all of our love of Vegas. It's all like

374
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:20,340
you know we've all separately like fractured into different things that we

375
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:24,340
like about Vegas. But like isn't it like it's like a

376
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:28,340
stupid or trashy or Disney World all like crunched and only

377
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:32,340
the hotels. 100% Yeah. 100% it is.

378
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:36,340
Just seeing this dumb nonsense when you're walking down the street is so

379
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:40,340
important to people with theme park brains. I just

380
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:44,340
want mini golf courses so right on. I just I want the world to

381
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:48,340
be like a huge miniature golf course. Yeah. I was looking when I was there

382
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:52,340
because I stayed one night at the Luxor and I stayed two nights at New York.

383
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:56,340
I forgot where your first night was. Okay. It was at Luxor because I

384
00:32:56,340 --> 00:33:00,340
didn't know if I was going to be there and then I got a cheaper room. So that was the Luxor.

385
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:04,340
It seems like that's the thing by the way. It seems like Luxor is a

386
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:08,340
last minute really cheap room spot. But New York, New York

387
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:12,340
I was looking at it as I was walking down the street and I kept looking at it going

388
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:16,340
okay this would be a good basis for a

389
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:20,340
Marvel area with the height of a New York

390
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:24,340
skyline like this in a theme park only do what you know that we've talked

391
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:28,340
about these photos from this never built Marvel thing that was going to be in Dubai.

392
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:32,340
I think so. Yeah. But I was just looking at it and I was like I was like imagining New York, New

393
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:36,340
York in a different context as like the hotel itself because it's

394
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:40,340
if you haven't seen it it's just giant. They're not as tall as the

395
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:44,340
skyscrapers in New York but they're very tall. Yeah. Like the scope of them is so big

396
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:48,340
and crazy. And then all like mashed together as like the you know the New

397
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:52,340
York that never was. Right. And they're all like a little more. It is very

398
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:56,340
Marvely. You're right. Yeah. So I get like I just add like Dr.

399
00:33:56,340 --> 00:34:00,340
Octopus's tentacles coming out of a window and add like

400
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:04,340
Spider-Man on the side of one. And I'm like man we're like this is so close

401
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:08,340
to what I want. Yeah. Which we won't ever get I don't think. No I don't

402
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:12,340
think Marvel. I don't think Disney is going to license out Marvel to although they should. I mean

403
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:16,340
look if they're trying to you know crank up some profits

404
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:20,340
here. It's too. Why not. Yeah. It's going to be too realistic like everything's going

405
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:24,340
to be realistic. That's the yeah. That's because of the movies.

406
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:28,340
This kind of dull take. Yeah. Yeah. It's fun. It'll be another ten

407
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:32,340
years before they learn that one of the most important characters in the Marvel

408
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:36,340
universe is the city itself. New York

409
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:40,340
City. Yeah. New York City. Yeah. Yeah. Hopefully they'll realize that.

410
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:44,340
Hopefully they'll realize it. New York New York and to

411
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:48,340
some extent Luxor obviously the theming has been pulled back but there's still

412
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:52,340
a bit of it in Luxor. But I have found those casinos

413
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:56,340
in terms of just like sitting at a slot machine

414
00:34:56,340 --> 00:35:00,340
and like posting are very fun. New York New York

415
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:04,340
especially with all the fake city streets and all and the facades

416
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:08,340
and all. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. New York New York and we'll talk we'll talk more

417
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:12,340
when we're talking about our trip but New York it is fun and especially it's fun and I wasn't

418
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:16,340
at this point in this trip but it's fun if you want to

419
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:20,340
like really get hammered and have a

420
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:24,340
piece of pizza and go into a piano bar and just be

421
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:28,340
annoying with a bunch of other annoying people and I mean that in a good way because I saw

422
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:32,340
that happening every night or both nights. Oh sure.

423
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:36,340
$25 a head at that piano bar to get in. Is it that much? You're guaranteed a seat

424
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:40,340
if you pay that. It is small so that's actually maybe not bad. It is very small but you can also just

425
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:44,340
hang out outside and hear the piano kind of. There was a lady

426
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:48,340
screaming the lyrics to like piano man because I walked by

427
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:52,340
and I was like I'm not in the mood for it right now but they're

428
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:56,340
depending on the trip sometimes you are in the mood to enjoy

429
00:35:56,340 --> 00:36:00,340
something like that. I don't think there's any amount of alcohol that

430
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:04,340
could get me in the mood to enjoy a dueling piano. What if she was

431
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:08,340
singing that Beach Boys problem child song.

432
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:12,340
And it was five o'clock on a Saturday. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I guess

433
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:16,340
well I would do a double take but you know I'd also be upset that even

434
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:20,340
a non classic was getting ruined. Okay.

435
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:24,340
I okay so big thing about this I remember

436
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:28,340
very clearly when this place opened because we'd

437
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:32,340
get like in LA we're not far so we're getting local news reports about it.

438
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:36,340
I'm like oh alright something's happening in Vegas and I for sure remember

439
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:40,340
like the news or my parents telling me how yes there is

440
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:44,340
there is a pyramid hotel and there is a light that shoots out

441
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:48,340
of the top of it and you can see the light from space.

442
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:52,340
What a stupid thing. I love that it was nice to see it. I don't think

443
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:56,340
they run it as bright. I think they tone down the brightness. Yeah. Yeah.

444
00:36:56,340 --> 00:37:00,340
At some point it brought down two satellites probably.

445
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:04,340
Started a war. Yeah. McCarran Airport now a Harry Reid

446
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:08,340
Airport. Not a fan of the light I believe. Oh sure.

447
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:12,340
Because you can like I saw that you could see

448
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:16,340
you could see the light potentially from Los Angeles. At cruising altitude

449
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:20,340
yeah you can see the light. Let alone you're in the airport

450
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:24,340
literally next door. I saw the phrase strongest

451
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:28,340
beam of light in the world and yeah.

452
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:32,340
So dumb. So pointless. Who went in there because of that?

453
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:36,340
It's a very good question. Did it ever did it help business? Do they have to do it?

454
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:40,340
It seems like an aggro move of like our light is the fucking strongest

455
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:44,340
light on earth. Like we will signal

456
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:48,340
like did you see Reid that it has its own ecosystem?

457
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:52,340
Ecosystem? Essentially enough animals. Yes.

458
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:56,340
Enough animals and species are up there because they're so attracted to the light.

459
00:37:56,340 --> 00:38:00,340
So there's like moths but then there's also bats and I don't know the intricacies of it

460
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:04,340
but I saw that in multiple sites now I don't know I didn't source it but

461
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:08,340
it seems like they've set up shop there. Certain animals have set up shop there.

462
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:12,340
And it's like a you know upside down ecosystem

463
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:16,340
because it has its own rules where like you think the bats are in there to eat the smaller animals

464
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:20,340
but actually like the bats and the moths get married.

465
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:24,340
Yeah yeah yeah. They're monogamous. Right. They treat each other really well.

466
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:28,340
It's one of the some of the more loving relationships. It's beautiful actually.

467
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:32,340
And if you saw them make love you would weep. It's also I believe

468
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:36,340
it was 2012 there was a UFO sighting.

469
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:40,340
I don't know if you guys are UFO-pilled like I am in the last few months

470
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:44,340
because there's a lot of UFO stuff and this is totally sincere. There's so much UFO stuff

471
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:48,340
going on. There's a big hearing like a couple days ago.

472
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:52,340
A bunch of people on the record like pilots and people in the military just being like

473
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:56,340
here's the video. Here's how fucking crazy this little

474
00:38:56,340 --> 00:39:00,340
object was behaving. I don't know what it is. And then there's other people

475
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:04,340
in the government that are saying crazier things like yeah we have had

476
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:08,340
contact with alien species. They have killed humans. There are

477
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:12,340
agreements in place between humans and aliens.

478
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:16,340
So like it really. No I have not tracked down. This stuff is not I don't know why everyone's

479
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:20,340
not like at least talking about it. I'm not saying this extreme version of

480
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:24,340
this guy's details. I always catch a little of it and I'm always

481
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:28,340
interested when it comes up. I do know I saw that the one of the

482
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:32,340
people testifying about it was really into like other dimensions

483
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:36,340
and he's like well of course Mussolini and the Vatican

484
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:40,340
found aliens. Yes that's the Mr. Grush is his last name. Yeah.

485
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:44,340
He's a government official who people say is credible

486
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:48,340
but he's the one who's definitely saying the wildest shit about aliens

487
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:52,340
versus other people who have just. There's like so many pilots who just have

488
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:56,340
videos from their ship just like of like a little craft just

489
00:39:56,340 --> 00:40:00,340
justifying the laws of physics. Just so many of these videos where people are like

490
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:04,340
it's scary. It looks scary. We don't know. So there's all this going

491
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:08,340
on but apparently there was a big sighting in 2012.

492
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:12,340
We're in the from there. To the beam of light. Yeah yeah. And I haven't found the

493
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:16,340
video. I should go find the video before and post it if they have it. Did aliens find the light?

494
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:20,340
Because you could see it from space. That's what I'm wondering because the light was so strong.

495
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:24,340
Maybe it did attract some of the aliens to the light.

496
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:28,340
It's ironic because Luxor and the Egyptian like

497
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:32,340
employee costumes do come into play in the movie Mars Attacks.

498
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:36,340
Oh right. Yeah right. Oh yeah yeah. So that light

499
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:40,340
I do believe maybe has attracted alien life.

500
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:44,340
It's so strong. It's shooting into the universe. You think anybody you think any of them

501
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:48,340
are up there or is anybody bothered to ask one of the bats are you an alien?

502
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:52,340
I don't think they have asked probably. And then they just immediately like alright you got me.

503
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:56,340
They kind of like unzip their body and then they're 10 feet tall.

504
00:40:56,340 --> 00:41:00,340
I crunched all my organs up here just to blend in to simulate one of

505
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:04,340
your human bats. Anyway I'll tell you my deal. I'm 5000 years old.

506
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:08,340
Came from Xyral 4. Somebody's got to climb up there and figure it out.

507
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:12,340
Yeah. It'd be a good place to introduce them to us.

508
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:16,340
The Blue Man group can communicate to them with sound and

509
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:20,340
visual things and then you can show them the bodies exhibit

510
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:24,340
which is like yeah we don't know where these ones came from but this is what humanity is.

511
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:28,340
This is all it's in us okay. You can trust us. Look

512
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:32,340
our literal insides. Our heart is on display for you.

513
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:36,340
You can trust us. We'll show you that titanic exhibit. We'll show you

514
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:40,340
our folly. We are but flawed creatures.

515
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:44,340
When we try to build might it blows up in our face don't you see.

516
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:48,340
That's a heart. They couldn't turn that down is what I'm saying.

517
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:52,340
No better play and then human and alien can all laugh together

518
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:56,340
at the universe bonding comedy of Carrot Top.

519
00:41:56,340 --> 00:42:00,340
Oh yeah.

520
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:04,340
He made a toilet seat do what?

521
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:08,340
Even we understand the Monica Lewinsky references.

522
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:12,340
We knew all about that in Xyral 4. It's like an Mars Attacks Alien

523
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:16,340
and like a human with arms around each other guffawing at the same time.

524
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:20,340
So you got a big light

525
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:24,340
that's attracting bats and aliens. I don't know

526
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:28,340
when this stopped because I specifically when I drive by it

527
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:32,340
if I'm on there or if you're going to see the sign that's something we haven't

528
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:36,340
talked about is the famous Vegas sign which every once in a while like

529
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:40,340
okay I'll do the sign and only then will I pass by like

530
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:44,340
the front garden of the Luxor which now

531
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:48,340
kind of sucks. It's specifically like a bad area and often

532
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:52,340
like they ruin the grandeur of the pyramid

533
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:56,340
with just like a big poster for their eSports arena.

534
00:42:56,340 --> 00:43:00,340
eSports arena and then the other side is the biggest

535
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:04,340
Bet MGM logo you've ever seen. I know I pulled into the parking

536
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:08,340
garage and it's just like this big fuck hole like it looks like shit.

537
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:12,340
It's pretty bad. This is what they've all the aesthetic of at its worst

538
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:16,340
a lot of these like dumb it's the fusion of

539
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:20,340
dumb 90's aesthetics that we like with just modern trash

540
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:24,340
and they think like the funky blend of it will be

541
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:28,340
what's interesting. Why a pyramid with an eSports but really it just doesn't

542
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:32,340
work at all. They've got other problems too. I watched a local Vegas news

543
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:36,340
report where viewers wrote letters to the news

544
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:40,340
and asked why is the Luxor so dirty?

545
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:44,340
Did you find that when you were there? Yes.

546
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:48,340
Did you feel it from your window? Did you see like gunk caked on?

547
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:52,340
Or was it just like in pulling up? No just pulling.

548
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:56,340
I got to the Luxor episode.

549
00:43:56,340 --> 00:44:00,340
I got there. There was the longest line ever. I was going to try to see if I could get like an upgrade

550
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:04,340
or something. I don't know if it was going to be a $20 trick. Probably not. But the line was

551
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:08,340
so long so I just checked it on my phone and I was trying

552
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:12,340
to get to the hotel room and the elevator I was trying to get to

553
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:16,340
was broken. And I was like oh god. And the hotel, the carpeting

554
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:20,340
looked extra dirty. There's bad vibes in there. It's just a bad

555
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:24,340
vibe. Especially when you go up. It's just kind of a bad vibe.

556
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:28,340
I don't mean to correct you Michael. The inclinator.

557
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:32,340
I was waiting for a pause to say inclinator as well. I'm going to talk about the inclinator.

558
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:36,340
The diagonal elevator. I'm so sorry. I am so sorry.

559
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:40,340
Which I tried to pitch to Jane once. What if we stayed at Luxor

560
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:44,340
for a night? You know you take an inclinator. It's a diagonal elevator. And she's like

561
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:48,340
I watched some videos looking from the higher floor. She's like absolutely

562
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:52,340
not. Here's a reverse pitch. What if we stayed somewhere safe?

563
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:56,340
Yeah. Well that is funny that you say safe. Oh no.

564
00:44:56,340 --> 00:45:00,340
So I'm trying. I have bags. I have my Comic Con exclusive toys.

565
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:04,340
Which are going to come up every episode this month. I just unboxed Ernie Reyes Jr.

566
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:08,340
It's a great toy. He's got his little scooter. Kino from Secret of the Use.

567
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:12,340
I got everything. I'm just lugging this shit. And I'm just like oh

568
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:16,340
where's my room? So I'm walking, walking to find a different elevator.

569
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:20,340
So I get to this other bank of elevators. It's not the right bank.

570
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:24,340
It's like one through eighteen and then eighteen through whatever. Like you have to find

571
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:28,340
certain. Okay. Oh it's not the right one. Alright I go to another one. I finally find

572
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:32,340
an elevator that looks correct. I get in.

573
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:36,340
I scan because now your phone is your room key. I scan the room key

574
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:40,340
on the thing, on the whatever, the button pad in the elevator

575
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:44,340
and the inclinator and it's not working. It doesn't fucking

576
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:48,340
work. I didn't get a real key card because I skipped the line. So I keep scanning.

577
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:52,340
Not working. I just want to go to the room and put all this shit down.

578
00:45:52,340 --> 00:45:56,340
I hate the Luxor in this moment. I'm so mad at it. I'm so mad that I didn't spend like

579
00:45:56,340 --> 00:46:00,340
fifty more dollars to stay at a better place. So all of a sudden the elevator

580
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:04,340
door closes or maybe it was closed already. All of a sudden the elevator

581
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:08,340
starts, inclinator starts moving. Now it's, I'm like okay

582
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:12,340
I guess somebody at the top maybe hit the button and is looking for the inclinator.

583
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:16,340
I don't think this is what happened because there was no one at the top. I

584
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:20,340
shoot up from first to thirty six or whatever. I forget exactly

585
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:24,340
what the floor is. It is the rickety-est ride

586
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:28,340
I've ever had and that includes Tower of Terror simulated rickety.

587
00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:32,340
It's rattling. It's like this. I didn't know that.

588
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:36,340
And I'm literally, I'm freaked. I'm completely freaked out. I have all

589
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:40,340
the, like I'm so tired and I'm just like, it's, you can hear

590
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:44,340
like stuff rattling and I'm going and I'm like when is this going to stop? I'm

591
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:48,340
expecting it's going to be like Charlie in the great glass elevator. I'm going to shoot out the Luxor.

592
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:52,340
It's going so fast. You gotta say goodbye to your loved ones

593
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:56,340
Ernie if I don't get a chance to tell you. I love you.

594
00:46:56,340 --> 00:47:00,340
I give Ernie a kiss. I rip open the box.

595
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:04,340
Which is ironic. I'll bring this up now since you're talking about

596
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:08,340
elevators. I took the elevator out to my room at the Park MGM

597
00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:12,340
done floor 27 once, opened on floor 24. Who did I see?

598
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:16,340
But the Carlson family, Mr. and Mrs. Carlson. Well because you were all

599
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:20,340
staying at the same hotel. We were all staying at the same hotel and we just high

600
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:24,340
by. That's a different, yeah those elevators work. That's a cute story. Anyway, back to

601
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:28,340
your horror show. So it's rattling and I'm just like oh my god.

602
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:32,340
So I end up at the top floor and it opens. No one's there.

603
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:36,340
But it's not my floor so I'm not getting out on the chance that

604
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:40,340
I can get back down again. So then I go

605
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:44,340
back down. And it's just as bad

606
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:48,340
and scary. And then it's like I'm so freaked out. You know like when you're in elevator

607
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:52,340
and it seems like there's an extra like five seconds and sometimes your brain goes

608
00:47:52,340 --> 00:47:56,340
are we stuck? Is that ever happened? Yeah. It feels like

609
00:47:56,340 --> 00:48:00,340
45 seconds in my memory. Oh god. Of the door not opening.

610
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:04,340
And then I'm like scanning and scanning. It might have been 20 seconds

611
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:08,340
of a panicked 20 seconds. It feels like 45 seconds.

612
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:12,340
So like scanning, scanning, scanning. Finally the door opens I think because somebody else

613
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:16,340
had hit the button. And then somebody else scanned me up to the right

614
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:20,340
floor finally. I think, I was honestly, it's so

615
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:24,340
blurry now. I may have just gotten into a different elevator.

616
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:28,340
But I was just like so freaked in

617
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:32,340
that moment. And none of the other one, because I went in a couple different ones the rest

618
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:36,340
of the day or the day and then the next morning. And none of them were that bad.

619
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:40,340
But that one was crazy. I've never been in a scarier

620
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:44,340
elevator situation. And here I am imagining

621
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:48,340
especially Jason like we should stay at the Luxor for the inclinators.

622
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:52,340
The might of man. The inclinator.

623
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:56,340
I'm going to die in this inclinator. It was

624
00:48:56,340 --> 00:49:00,340
really awful. I did read, wait I don't remember

625
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:04,340
where this quote came from. But somewhere printed

626
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:08,340
the phrase inclinator. An elevator that ascends at a 39 degree angle

627
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:12,340
and rocks like a ferris wheel carriage. Yeah I guess maybe that

628
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:16,340
I went into, because it was the set of inclinators

629
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:20,340
that went to the top. They go fast. So because of the

630
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:24,340
angle that just is normal. That is so upsetting to the, well between

631
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:28,340
this and the New York New York roller coaster, this corner of the strip is just

632
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:32,340
shaky ride alley. Shaky. Luxor also, if you

633
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:36,340
look up the phrase Luxor cursed or Luxor haunted.

634
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:40,340
There's a lot of different, like some obviously

635
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:44,340
people have died. It's a hotel that's been open for a while.

636
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:48,340
But then some of the deaths are fucking bonkers. There was like a car bomb

637
00:49:48,340 --> 00:49:52,340
that was rigged to like, alright I'm just going to put an upside down

638
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:56,340
cup in this guy's car and there's an explosive in there so if he turns

639
00:49:56,340 --> 00:50:00,340
the cup over the thing.

640
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:04,340
Truly crazy deaths have happened. A pipe bomb

641
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:08,340
and I believe it did kill the intended target. A guy worked at

642
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:12,340
the Nathan's Hot Dogs in the food court because the

643
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:16,340
bomber's ex-girlfriend was now seeing him.

644
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:20,340
And the two bombers were sentenced to life in prison. They avoided

645
00:50:20,340 --> 00:50:24,340
the death penalty. Jesus. Oh my god.

646
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:28,340
Wow. Well first of all, RIP to a real one. To a

647
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:32,340
Nathan's Hot Dog employee. To a Nathan's True Blue Young. But also like isn't that the

648
00:50:32,340 --> 00:50:36,340
like you wedge yourself into a relationship. You cause a break

649
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:40,340
up. It probably does not occur to you that the person might have

650
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:44,340
a vast knowledge of how to build successful bombs.

651
00:50:44,340 --> 00:50:48,340
Of car bombs. I think someone also may have gotten grievously

652
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:52,340
injured or died falling down the shafts of one of the

653
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:56,340
inclinators. No. No. Yeah. And then you go look at the

654
00:50:56,340 --> 00:51:00,340
article. It says here it happened in 2023 and his name was Michael Carlson.

655
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:04,340
Michael R. Carlson. Ah! And then Mike disappears.

656
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:08,340
What was that? There was a flash of Luxor Escalate and then Mike

657
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:12,340
was gone. Wouldn't it be cool though if a ghost was your third host?

658
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:16,340
Yeah. I mean as long as I showed up. Yeah.

659
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:20,340
As long as you put in the yeah look I'm not splitting the Patreon money

660
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:24,340
with an apparition. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Cause I understand. Did you guys see

661
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:28,340
in somebody said this that the rumor

662
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:32,340
was that the whole place is haunted because it was a place where

663
00:51:32,340 --> 00:51:36,340
mobsters used to kill and bury their enemies? That's what the

664
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:40,340
property was? Yeah. Yeah. I mean I'm sure that's probably

665
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:44,340
every place that there was a hotel or there's a hotel now.

666
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:48,340
Well I also saw that in construction a handful

667
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:52,340
of workers died but it was like oh estimated

668
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:56,340
three but it might actually be seven. And like

669
00:51:56,340 --> 00:52:00,340
that's haunting. I saw one video that said it's cursed

670
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:04,340
because if you build a sphinx to protect a pyramid

671
00:52:04,340 --> 00:52:08,340
you have to build two and they only built one.

672
00:52:08,340 --> 00:52:12,340
So there's so many old fads. There's so many. Like curses

673
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:16,340
that haven't been awakened in this century. They defied so

674
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:20,340
many law. They defied so many different laws

675
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:24,340
essentially. They built on a burial ground.

676
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:28,340
They didn't do the two sphinxes. Mobster curse, mummy curse.

677
00:52:28,340 --> 00:52:32,340
I don't know if there were any others. I don't know the other types of curses.

678
00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:36,340
Well they probably built two fads. I mean this whole thing was built in 18

679
00:52:36,340 --> 00:52:40,340
months. It's like poltergeist probably. One of these days it's just gonna like

680
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:44,340
get absorbed into a ball of energy and go to hell or something. Sure.

681
00:52:44,340 --> 00:52:48,340
I don't know why it hasn't happened yet but. That's a good way

682
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:52,340
because I love my Vegas implosions but how do you top that? Well by the entire

683
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:56,340
entire Luxor being taken back to hell.

684
00:52:56,340 --> 00:53:00,340
If hell could take back a casino that would be the ultimate

685
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:04,340
implosion. That's the one it's eyeing. The video I was watching

686
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:08,340
these couple who do like Vegas videos. They were like oh there's a

687
00:53:08,340 --> 00:53:12,340
middle aged man in like a pinstripe suit that walks the halls.

688
00:53:12,340 --> 00:53:16,340
That's a ghost at the Luxor. And you're supposed to like get out of his

689
00:53:16,340 --> 00:53:20,340
way. Like that's how we just make sure you get out of his way. No problem.

690
00:53:20,340 --> 00:53:24,340
And everything is fine. Good rule of thumb. Yeah. They didn't

691
00:53:24,340 --> 00:53:28,340
Did they film him? Did they get him? They did. They did. I got a release.

692
00:53:28,340 --> 00:53:32,340
You can't. You have to get out of his way but he will sign a release form for YouTube.

693
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:36,340
He understands how media works. No I get you. Yeah.

694
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:40,340
I was saying you release. I know. Hey we know an other worldly

695
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:44,340
Yeah that's true. Pinstripe suit man.

696
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:48,340
They got a jewel store in here somewhere?

697
00:53:48,340 --> 00:53:52,340
The Luxor for sure is haunted. You can feel it. There's a

698
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:56,340
weird vibe in there. And all the Vegas hotels have a weird vibe but that

699
00:53:56,340 --> 00:54:00,340
one does feel haunted to me. That doesn't surprise me that it's haunted.

700
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:04,340
But also I won a hundred dollars playing slots

701
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:08,340
there a few years ago so who's to say. What slot machine?

702
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:12,340
I don't. It was a very generic. It was one of the ones where

703
00:54:12,340 --> 00:54:16,340
it's like. Adventures in babysitting. It only plays 80's movie.

704
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:20,340
I did and we did okay on the Wizard of Oz slot machine

705
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:24,340
at the Bellagio. Okay. That was pretty fun. Little shop?

706
00:54:24,340 --> 00:54:28,340
Little shop treat you. Hide a little shop story. We'll save it for another episode.

707
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:32,340
Okay that's a good Patreon tease. It'll be on the trip report. Park MGM

708
00:54:32,340 --> 00:54:36,340
does not feel cursed to me. It doesn't feel haunted. No and that's

709
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:40,340
Circus Circus Entertainment at some point did own 50%

710
00:54:40,340 --> 00:54:44,340
of the Monte Carlo which is what Park MGM was

711
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:48,340
before. And if you there's some very there's like

712
00:54:48,340 --> 00:54:52,340
2012 videos of like walking through the Monte Carlo and it

713
00:54:52,340 --> 00:54:56,340
looks busted. Like it's like oh this got redone it

714
00:54:56,340 --> 00:55:00,340
just the right time. They got all the ghosts out of there before.

715
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:04,340
Some of the best vi. We found ourselves back in there over and over again.

716
00:55:04,340 --> 00:55:08,340
Really good. Okay so Mike didn't die. Mike didn't become

717
00:55:08,340 --> 00:55:12,340
one of the unhappy haunts of the Luxor.

718
00:55:12,340 --> 00:55:16,340
Didn't succumb to the Pharaoh's curse. 99.

719
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:20,340
If that story kept going.

720
00:55:20,340 --> 00:55:24,340
So then we're getting I know I'm getting afraid and now they see the numbers climbing like to

721
00:55:24,340 --> 00:55:28,340
I'm sorry I'm on floor a thousand and then the roof of the

722
00:55:28,340 --> 00:55:32,340
elevator dissipate just turned it just scattered into

723
00:55:32,340 --> 00:55:36,340
ashes and then I went into a ghostly Pharaoh's mouth.

724
00:55:36,340 --> 00:55:40,340
He screamed your soul is mine forever and I went

725
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:44,340
into it and then I can't even describe what I saw in there.

726
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:48,340
Well I met 900 dead mobsters.

727
00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:52,340
The genre I like you know what I like the genre

728
00:55:52,340 --> 00:55:56,340
mash up here of the mobster ghosts plus all the

729
00:55:56,340 --> 00:56:00,340
Egyptian stuff. This is a real Cowboys versus Aliens. Yeah yeah.

730
00:56:00,340 --> 00:56:04,340
It's mobsters versus mummies.

731
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:08,340
This would have kept it open if this was the sort of basis for all of the rides

732
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:12,340
and experiences. It's a little bit of a streamlined yes. Yeah. Easy to wrap

733
00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:16,340
your head around. Right. I wonder Scott do you know about

734
00:56:16,340 --> 00:56:20,340
how that got me like that that was

735
00:56:20,340 --> 00:56:24,340
in the mid 2000s they made it as

736
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:28,340
a comic book first Cowboys versus Aliens.

737
00:56:28,340 --> 00:56:32,340
And it seemed like a thing where they were like practically

738
00:56:32,340 --> 00:56:36,340
giving it away at stores where it's like I don't

739
00:56:36,340 --> 00:56:40,340
how is this making money like and as it came out they were like there's a movie

740
00:56:40,340 --> 00:56:44,340
like it seemed like really shady.

741
00:56:44,340 --> 00:56:48,340
Sure to be hit movie. Sure to be hit movie. Yeah.

742
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:52,340
So I am wondering like oh are their stories going to come out

743
00:56:52,340 --> 00:56:56,340
if they haven't already come out of like the Ponzi scheme that got

744
00:56:56,340 --> 00:57:00,340
Cowboys versus Aliens made you know. I'd love to know.

745
00:57:00,340 --> 00:57:04,340
Well let's start a Ponzi scheme for mummies versus mobsters.

746
00:57:04,340 --> 00:57:08,340
Yeah. There's gotta be some shady financier

747
00:57:08,340 --> 00:57:12,340
out there. Look we might be talking asylum if we're lucky it's asylum. Yeah

748
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:16,340
we'll go sub asylum if we have to to get our vision of mummies versus

749
00:57:16,340 --> 00:57:20,340
mobsters which is a bit which is a more of a mobster versus

750
00:57:20,340 --> 00:57:24,340
mummies versus mobsters. Mobster versus mummies I think. Yeah. Okay. All right.

751
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:28,340
Yeah. I do I know I said I was I was thinking

752
00:57:28,340 --> 00:57:32,340
that we don't have any commercial pilots in our audience and I have yet to be proven wrong.

753
00:57:32,340 --> 00:57:36,340
I think there's pilots in our audience but not commercial pilots. That's what you want.

754
00:57:36,340 --> 00:57:40,340
But is there any are there any shady movie producers in our audience.

755
00:57:40,340 --> 00:57:44,340
I hope so. If so what are you doing.

756
00:57:44,340 --> 00:57:48,340
If you're a fan of this you if you're a fan of this podcast you know

757
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:52,340
we're chomping at the bit to make the worst movies ever made. Oh my god we would love to.

758
00:57:52,340 --> 00:57:56,340
We could do it all together. We could each have our own bad movie and you could finance

759
00:57:56,340 --> 00:58:00,340
them and hang out with us. Come on. And also with like

760
00:58:00,340 --> 00:58:04,340
mobster like you can get like it's a genre

761
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:08,340
where you can get like great actors who have

762
00:58:08,340 --> 00:58:12,340
played mafia characters before you can get you can get Al Pacino

763
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:16,340
living soprano actor. Well that's true. So easily just like

764
00:58:16,340 --> 00:58:20,340
but a modest amount of money. Pacino will do it. Yeah that's true.

765
00:58:20,340 --> 00:58:24,340
Give him the earpiece and just feed him the lines and he doesn't even need to yeah

766
00:58:24,340 --> 00:58:28,340
see a mobster. He's maybe not to spoil it but he's maybe a

767
00:58:28,340 --> 00:58:32,340
mobster who you realize is secretly a mummy. Of course he's a mummy.

768
00:58:32,340 --> 00:58:36,340
Of course he is. A mummy. A mummy this whole time. And nobody

769
00:58:36,340 --> 00:58:40,340
knows. The Tribeca Film Festival is solely

770
00:58:40,340 --> 00:58:44,340
to gain life force for

771
00:58:44,340 --> 00:58:48,340
his mummy spells. The Tribeca Film Festival?

772
00:58:48,340 --> 00:58:52,340
Are you confusing De Niro? Did you say Pacino? Yes. Oh I thought

773
00:58:52,340 --> 00:58:56,340
you were talking about De Niro because I know De Niro has done a lot of

774
00:58:56,340 --> 00:59:00,340
those direct. You said you had to listen to the impression and then still thought it was De Niro.

775
00:59:00,340 --> 00:59:04,340
He can get pretty mad. He can get pretty

776
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:08,340
mad. I don't know. I don't think De Niro is shouted in a movie in 30 years.

777
00:59:08,340 --> 00:59:12,340
He is not able to shout anymore. He's physically not able to get that

778
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:16,340
excitable. He's gentle. He's like he's the intern. You know? He helps

779
00:59:16,340 --> 00:59:20,340
everyone out. Pacino makes Pesci and De Niro look like

780
00:59:20,340 --> 00:59:24,340
he's 15 and they're 80

781
00:59:24,340 --> 00:59:28,340
in the Irishman. He has so much more energy than they do. Thank God.

782
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:32,340
When Pacino loses the ability to scream that'll be like the snuffing out

783
00:59:32,340 --> 00:59:36,340
of the great art of the 20th century.

784
00:59:36,340 --> 00:59:40,340
But I know Pacino is still hanging out with Guy Fieri and

785
00:59:40,340 --> 00:59:44,340
Sly and everybody. He's doing great. He just had a baby.

786
00:59:44,340 --> 00:59:48,340
Oh he's hungry. Oh that's why you got confused. De Niro and Pacino both had babies.

787
00:59:48,340 --> 00:59:52,340
That's right. Proud Papa. Proud Proud Papa.

788
00:59:52,340 --> 00:59:56,340
Was that De Niro or Pacino?

789
00:59:56,340 --> 01:00:00,340
I think a modern De Niro person is just like

790
01:00:00,340 --> 01:00:04,340
doing good. Yeah. Excited to be.

791
01:00:04,340 --> 01:00:08,340
I don't know if that even picked up. People in watching Killers of the Flowers

792
01:00:08,340 --> 01:00:12,340
the Flower. Killers under the Flowers? Killers of the Flower.

793
01:00:12,340 --> 01:00:16,340
Killers of the Flowers? I don't think I'm under. What am I thinking? I think it's under.

794
01:00:16,340 --> 01:00:20,340
I was saying people are going to be watching that in the Paci

795
01:00:20,340 --> 01:00:24,340
and the De Niro scenes. They're just like turn it up.

796
01:00:24,340 --> 01:00:28,340
Can't hear him. You can just hear the volume. Sit closer to the speaker in the

797
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:32,340
theater. It's the only way. Plement seems like he's screaming in comparison.

798
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:36,340
Somebody's riding the levels on that. You can hear

799
01:00:36,340 --> 01:00:40,340
the hiss of the white noise in the background. That's the sound of the moon.

800
01:00:40,340 --> 01:00:44,340
No we put it in there on purpose. Okay keep getting through rides.

801
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:48,340
You have a ride before you. You have a ride that I think initially

802
01:00:48,340 --> 01:00:52,340
you didn't even have to pay for. And the ride, well I don't even know if it had a name

803
01:00:52,340 --> 01:00:56,340
initially. It became the Nile River Adventure.

804
01:00:56,340 --> 01:01:00,340
Okay so confusing history here

805
01:01:00,340 --> 01:01:04,340
where this was, oh first of all with this giant pyramid

806
01:01:04,340 --> 01:01:08,340
space we now have the largest atrium in the world.

807
01:01:08,340 --> 01:01:12,340
Yes. You got to fill that with a lot of stuff. And you have a

808
01:01:12,340 --> 01:01:16,340
kind of marvely little indoor, it's a little bit New York but

809
01:01:16,340 --> 01:01:20,340
mixed with Art Deco, mixed with Egypt.

810
01:01:20,340 --> 01:01:24,340
It's real strand. That's still there. They can't get rid of that. They still have

811
01:01:24,340 --> 01:01:28,340
to like, I don't know, whatever nightclub crap we're doing

812
01:01:28,340 --> 01:01:32,340
has to work under this weird Marvel city. So that's there.

813
01:01:32,340 --> 01:01:36,340
But this boat ride was initially a big

814
01:01:36,340 --> 01:01:40,340
part of it where you would, it was crazy reading the phrase

815
01:01:40,340 --> 01:01:44,340
that you would climb aboard the boat, the reed boat, not far

816
01:01:44,340 --> 01:01:48,340
from the check in desk. Mike you described this difficult

817
01:01:48,340 --> 01:01:52,340
process of finding the right elevator. What they imagined for you

818
01:01:52,340 --> 01:01:56,340
is that you're whisked away on a reed boat. Alright just

819
01:01:56,340 --> 01:02:00,340
follow the boat sir and then you climb aboard a boat and that takes

820
01:02:00,340 --> 01:02:04,340
you all across the world's largest atrium. So it was meant to be a

821
01:02:04,340 --> 01:02:08,340
boat that took you around the hotel or the lobby

822
01:02:08,340 --> 01:02:12,340
until they realized that doesn't make any sense. Well and the waits were

823
01:02:12,340 --> 01:02:16,340
like 90 minutes to get on the boat which I don't, who

824
01:02:16,340 --> 01:02:20,340
didn't bring this up? This is one of the most, well you know what's going to happen to you

825
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:24,340
right away on day one is lines will form.

826
01:02:24,340 --> 01:02:28,340
Yeah this is really weird. I understand, like this, no one brought

827
01:02:28,340 --> 01:02:32,340
this up that like, this is going to back up. You know you can see

828
01:02:32,340 --> 01:02:36,340
great footage, there's a very slick

829
01:02:36,340 --> 01:02:40,340
special, like 27 minute special about the opening of the Luxor.

830
01:02:40,340 --> 01:02:44,340
Yes, great special. Which we'll pull from a lot when we talk about these, the big

831
01:02:44,340 --> 01:02:48,340
ticket rides. Yeah. And you see a couple funny things about the

832
01:02:48,340 --> 01:02:52,340
boat ride. One, within the first few shots of the special there's a

833
01:02:52,340 --> 01:02:56,340
massive crowd waiting for the boat ride. And two, later on

834
01:02:56,340 --> 01:03:00,340
you see one of the boat ride hosts

835
01:03:00,340 --> 01:03:04,340
doing the spiel, holding the script in a microphone

836
01:03:04,340 --> 01:03:08,340
to an empty boat as they're putting final touches on the

837
01:03:08,340 --> 01:03:12,340
whole place. And that is very funny to see.

838
01:03:12,340 --> 01:03:16,340
Well the notable thing there is that she is practicing her spiel and

839
01:03:16,340 --> 01:03:20,340
welcoming people on board the boat for when it opens and she says, hi my name is

840
01:03:20,340 --> 01:03:24,340
Cricket. I'll be your, I also noted that her name is Cricket.

841
01:03:24,340 --> 01:03:28,340
That stuck in my mind too, yeah. Wow. That's cool.

842
01:03:28,340 --> 01:03:32,340
I hope Cricket had a good run before the Nile River adventure wrapped up.

843
01:03:32,340 --> 01:03:36,340
So basically, so this was meant to be like a transportation boat, this was meant to be more like

844
01:03:36,340 --> 01:03:40,340
the Epcot boats, so the Island of Adventure boats, but that doesn't make

845
01:03:40,340 --> 01:03:44,340
any sense and really just what it leads to is weird imagery of like

846
01:03:44,340 --> 01:03:48,340
here's the, because it's also, okay, all the rooms are facing that

847
01:03:48,340 --> 01:03:52,340
atrium, so it's like the world's largest motel basically where

848
01:03:52,340 --> 01:03:56,340
you don't have private hallways. It's all like as soon as you're out of your room you are

849
01:03:56,340 --> 01:04:00,340
public facing. So that's the case and if you're on one of the lower

850
01:04:00,340 --> 01:04:04,340
floors you walk out, if you're on floor two you step out and maybe there is

851
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:08,340
a reed boat full of tourists going by immediately.

852
01:04:08,340 --> 01:04:12,340
So the creepiness of the boat just moving through the

853
01:04:12,340 --> 01:04:16,340
little hotel corridors is very strong. Really weird.

854
01:04:16,340 --> 01:04:20,340
Yeah. And I think it's smell, I think it was very

855
01:04:20,340 --> 01:04:24,340
chloriney or whatever, or like pirates water smell, like that was

856
01:04:24,340 --> 01:04:28,340
really, that wafted through the entire lobby. Oh, had to be.

857
01:04:28,340 --> 01:04:32,340
And I believe, correct me if I'm wrong,

858
01:04:32,340 --> 01:04:36,340
I think I saw the mention of like this and some

859
01:04:36,340 --> 01:04:40,340
of the other attractions gone by 1996.

860
01:04:40,340 --> 01:04:44,340
I think so, I think the main Luxor things made it a little

861
01:04:44,340 --> 01:04:48,340
while. But 96 kind of, that's where it all started.

862
01:04:48,340 --> 01:04:52,340
Unraveling. Because 96 is when all that Wizard of Oz theming we

863
01:04:52,340 --> 01:04:56,340
talked about on Club 3, that's when that went away. And I think when

864
01:04:56,340 --> 01:05:00,340
half of MGM Grand, nearly half of MGM Grand Adventures was gone.

865
01:05:00,340 --> 01:05:04,340
So 96 was a big like sober up moment for this weird

866
01:05:04,340 --> 01:05:08,340
family time. Boat rides gone, most of MGM Park is gone.

867
01:05:08,340 --> 01:05:12,340
But you could probably feel, like it always seemed to me, Theme Park Vegas,

868
01:05:12,340 --> 01:05:16,340
Family Vegas, it seemed like by the second or third week of running

869
01:05:16,340 --> 01:05:20,340
this stuff, they were like the contempt, the people running

870
01:05:20,340 --> 01:05:24,340
it probably just had for this stuff, you know? Yeah, really.

871
01:05:24,340 --> 01:05:28,340
The idea, again, just from somebody who you get done with your long drive,

872
01:05:28,340 --> 01:05:32,340
you've probably got bags with you, you're waiting to check in,

873
01:05:32,340 --> 01:05:36,340
you check in and the next thing you have to do is wait in a 90 minute line

874
01:05:36,340 --> 01:05:40,340
to get on a boat just to dump your shit.

875
01:05:40,340 --> 01:05:44,340
And keep in mind you don't have to, you could just

876
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:48,340
walk to the elevators, which undoubtedly will be faster.

877
01:05:48,340 --> 01:05:52,340
Well sure, yes. So this notion of

878
01:05:52,340 --> 01:05:56,340
transportation boat ride is just defeated instantly.

879
01:05:56,340 --> 01:06:00,340
Yeah, but they were obviously encouraging, I would assume a lot of people

880
01:06:00,340 --> 01:06:04,340
wanted to do the boat. Because you go, we're going to this big crazy hotel,

881
01:06:04,340 --> 01:06:08,340
let's get in line for the boat. But then the boat takes 90 minutes and you got your shit

882
01:06:08,340 --> 01:06:12,340
and you just drove. It's not even like, oh we hop right on the boat, we go right to the room

883
01:06:12,340 --> 01:06:16,340
or whatever. The idea of this extra

884
01:06:16,340 --> 01:06:20,340
two hour chunk before you get to your room is crazy.

885
01:06:20,340 --> 01:06:24,340
I don't know who thought this was a good idea. The larger Vegas casino

886
01:06:24,340 --> 01:06:28,340
hotels, I am skeptical of

887
01:06:28,340 --> 01:06:32,340
the relaxing, like when it's like New York, New York is a little

888
01:06:32,340 --> 01:06:36,340
like this too, where it's like, oh if you're in that tower you have to cross the casino

889
01:06:36,340 --> 01:06:40,340
floor with your luggage to check in.

890
01:06:40,340 --> 01:06:44,340
Yes, that drives me nuts with a lot of these places. Because the thing we like about Park MGM

891
01:06:44,340 --> 01:06:48,340
is like the check in desk is right there, right behind it is the

892
01:06:48,340 --> 01:06:52,340
elevator bank. Yes, you know exactly where it is.

893
01:06:52,340 --> 01:06:56,340
I was at Bedaro, which is part of Aria and that's completely the deal there too.

894
01:06:56,340 --> 01:07:00,340
You don't have like the silly fun, but you're close to the silly fun.

895
01:07:00,340 --> 01:07:04,340
You can maybe get a little calmer escape. Not a bad thing.

896
01:07:04,340 --> 01:07:08,340
Yeah, this is crazy. So they stopped making

897
01:07:08,340 --> 01:07:12,340
this, they threw out the transportation element of it and it just had to become a

898
01:07:12,340 --> 01:07:16,340
ticketed boat ride called Nile River Adventure. But I don't think there was much

899
01:07:16,340 --> 01:07:20,340
to the adventure. Because it wasn't supposed to be, it was just like going through

900
01:07:20,340 --> 01:07:24,340
hallways. Some of them quite narrow. It's a little creepy. You go through like very

901
01:07:24,340 --> 01:07:28,340
little, because probably right above you people are walking by to the rides of the restaurants or

902
01:07:28,340 --> 01:07:32,340
whatever. So there's some low clearance. And then like

903
01:07:32,340 --> 01:07:36,340
a guy on board, all of them, there's somebody on board, like Storybook Land.

904
01:07:36,340 --> 01:07:40,340
I only found one video and they are

905
01:07:40,340 --> 01:07:44,340
not making jokes really. This is like real, they're pointing out real hieroglyphic

906
01:07:44,340 --> 01:07:48,340
stuff. But it's all fake and they're trying to incorporate

907
01:07:48,340 --> 01:07:52,340
sometimes the mythology of the rides that we'll get to.

908
01:07:52,340 --> 01:07:56,340
Our main archaeologist, Mack McPherson,

909
01:07:56,340 --> 01:08:00,340
was spotted around these parts. Which again, I love. This is

910
01:08:00,340 --> 01:08:04,340
so on my alley. This dumb boat ride in this part, like connects to the other.

911
01:08:04,340 --> 01:08:08,340
Love it. But it's being said by this gruff Brian Doyle Marie

912
01:08:08,340 --> 01:08:12,340
sounding guy who does not seem to be thrilled with having to

913
01:08:12,340 --> 01:08:16,340
parallel. And then there's no animatronics. You don't like encounter, it's

914
01:08:16,340 --> 01:08:20,340
a pirates without anything to look at besides stuff that you could just walk past

915
01:08:20,340 --> 01:08:24,340
in the hotel anyway. They thought that, yeah, they thought the idea of

916
01:08:24,340 --> 01:08:28,340
it being transportation would be enough.

917
01:08:28,340 --> 01:08:32,340
Obviously they didn't think it was just going to be a ticketed ride, but they thought they didn't have any

918
01:08:32,340 --> 01:08:36,340
foresight that that boat ride should have some sort of really unique

919
01:08:36,340 --> 01:08:40,340
theming or robots or anything to it. Yeah, anything.

920
01:08:40,340 --> 01:08:44,340
Yes, it's just, it's pointing out hieroglyphics that are

921
01:08:44,340 --> 01:08:48,340
not ancient. They were put up there three months ago.

922
01:08:48,340 --> 01:08:52,340
Similarly, this place also had a recreation of King Tut's

923
01:08:52,340 --> 01:08:56,340
tomb, which are like, why? Who would care if it's not a real,

924
01:08:56,340 --> 01:09:00,340
well, what if I told you it was green lit by the Egyptian ministry

925
01:09:00,340 --> 01:09:04,340
of antiquities and they oversaw it to make sure it was like

926
01:09:04,340 --> 01:09:08,340
the real tomb? Well, I would say still then

927
01:09:08,340 --> 01:09:12,340
it's just a, if it's a simulation of a real tomb, but it doesn't have like a

928
01:09:12,340 --> 01:09:16,340
mummy trying to get out of the tomb and try to send me to hell and spit scarabs

929
01:09:16,340 --> 01:09:20,340
at me, then why bother to make it realistic?

930
01:09:20,340 --> 01:09:24,340
It's a very good point. Really weird. Some of these, I'll say quote-unquote

931
01:09:24,340 --> 01:09:28,340
artifacts, because they were all recreations

932
01:09:28,340 --> 01:09:32,340
when they were closing stuff down or pulling back on it, they did donate

933
01:09:32,340 --> 01:09:36,340
to a local Vegas museum, so that's nice.

934
01:09:36,340 --> 01:09:40,340
You can see, so now a real museum has a fake King Tut tomb. Has fraudulent

935
01:09:40,340 --> 01:09:44,340
artifacts. I think there's still

936
01:09:44,340 --> 01:09:48,340
some sort of like King Tut exhibit.

937
01:09:48,340 --> 01:09:52,340
In the Luxor, with the Titanic

938
01:09:52,340 --> 01:09:56,340
and with bodies, you know. Okay, okay. And the

939
01:09:56,340 --> 01:10:00,340
fantasy, the topless review.

940
01:10:00,340 --> 01:10:04,340
That's at Luxor? I didn't see, I forgot to go see it.

941
01:10:04,340 --> 01:10:08,340
You did? Yeah. Just kidding, I didn't see bodies,

942
01:10:08,340 --> 01:10:12,340
I didn't see dead bodies and I didn't see nude bodies.

943
01:10:12,340 --> 01:10:16,340
Well, they were both nude actually. It all sounds a little

944
01:10:16,340 --> 01:10:20,340
bawdy. That does it. Bodies. A couple spellings

945
01:10:20,340 --> 01:10:24,340
in place. That's my new, yeah.

946
01:10:24,340 --> 01:10:28,340
Did you scribble that on the feedback card when you were like checking out?

947
01:10:28,340 --> 01:10:32,340
Put clothes on those bodies. Every time

948
01:10:32,340 --> 01:10:36,340
I walked to the Luxor, I was like angry or for some, like I was just like

949
01:10:36,340 --> 01:10:40,340
oh, I just like, get me, transport me to the other side is dumb place.

950
01:10:40,340 --> 01:10:44,340
So there's no boats. The idea was you get all,

951
01:10:44,340 --> 01:10:48,340
you would just wait 90 minutes for a 15 minute boat ride. Yeah.

952
01:10:48,340 --> 01:10:52,340
Yeah, rest your feet. But it was not to be. But, look,

953
01:10:52,340 --> 01:10:56,340
ultimately, you know, if there were some flawed concepts

954
01:10:56,340 --> 01:11:00,340
here, it's because the big money was put into the center

955
01:11:00,340 --> 01:11:04,340
piece. The trilogy of attractions, of

956
01:11:04,340 --> 01:11:08,340
high end theme park attractions, secrets of the Luxor

957
01:11:08,340 --> 01:11:12,340
pyramid. And again, we will recommend the special that's on YouTube,

958
01:11:12,340 --> 01:11:16,340
the making of Luxor. I think that'll find it for you.

959
01:11:16,340 --> 01:11:20,340
And where you can watch the creation. They have cameras present for

960
01:11:20,340 --> 01:11:24,340
every step of putting together really high end, the highest

961
01:11:24,340 --> 01:11:28,340
end outside of Disney Universal. Maybe higher than some of what they

962
01:11:28,340 --> 01:11:32,340
were doing at the time. Yeah. This was top tier stuff.

963
01:11:32,340 --> 01:11:36,340
Plopped into this casino to be mostly unappreciated.

964
01:11:36,340 --> 01:11:40,340
The work they put in for, the work they put into

965
01:11:40,340 --> 01:11:44,340
the appreciation ratio has to be off the charts.

966
01:11:44,340 --> 01:11:48,340
I don't know how to explain. You know what I'm saying? The amount of work, the amount of

967
01:11:48,340 --> 01:11:52,340
effort versus the amount of people that actually gave a shit.

968
01:11:52,340 --> 01:11:56,340
Yeah. When you compare it to like. It's just so much versus so little, I assume. Same era.

969
01:11:56,340 --> 01:12:00,340
Indiana Jones Adventure. Right. And it is like,

970
01:12:00,340 --> 01:12:04,340
it comes out to rave reviews and people still are just like, trembling

971
01:12:04,340 --> 01:12:08,340
when they, I love it so much in reunion panels and it's the great,

972
01:12:08,340 --> 01:12:12,340
I want to take my kids on it and pass it along and they refreshed it

973
01:12:12,340 --> 01:12:16,340
and they, I, like the emotion present in, and I'm not

974
01:12:16,340 --> 01:12:20,340
saying these were better than that, but it was like

975
01:12:20,340 --> 01:12:24,340
top tier themed entertainment talent. Yeah. Getting nothing.

976
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:28,340
Did anybody tell him I liked it?

977
01:12:28,340 --> 01:12:32,340
It's possible no. I guess I'll say if somehow someone

978
01:12:32,340 --> 01:12:36,340
is listening who's part of these, I can't say I liked it because I didn't go.

979
01:12:36,340 --> 01:12:40,340
I wish I could have gone. These seem incredible. Yeah. 100%.

980
01:12:40,340 --> 01:12:44,340
The thing I had always heard about it was the one guy

981
01:12:44,340 --> 01:12:48,340
associated with Douglas Trumbull who worked on

982
01:12:48,340 --> 01:12:52,340
Back to the Future the Ride. Directed it. He's the reason for

983
01:12:52,340 --> 01:12:56,340
like, the reason for the premise. He saved it. It was like

984
01:12:56,340 --> 01:13:00,340
potentially going to be a disaster that just made people nauseous.

985
01:13:00,340 --> 01:13:04,340
They built a theater that was not to his liking and he's like, what can we do?

986
01:13:04,340 --> 01:13:08,340
And he figured out how to make it work. And he remade that

987
01:13:08,340 --> 01:13:12,340
one of the greatest rides ever. Yeah. And I think another was known

988
01:13:12,340 --> 01:13:16,340
for the special effects on close encounters of the third kind.

989
01:13:16,340 --> 01:13:20,340
2001. 2001. 2001. Yeah.

990
01:13:20,340 --> 01:13:24,340
Blade Runner. Star Trek motion picture. At some point went to

991
01:13:24,340 --> 01:13:28,340
left Hollywood and started working

992
01:13:28,340 --> 01:13:32,340
more in themed entertainment. Under the shadow of

993
01:13:32,340 --> 01:13:36,340
Natalie Wood's death which occurred while he was directing her in a movie. Dear

994
01:13:36,340 --> 01:13:40,340
God. Yeah. And he like, I'm sure I said this before, but yeah, he's

995
01:13:40,340 --> 01:13:44,340
just on the record. Like, and after what happened to Natalie, I just, I didn't want to be in this town

996
01:13:44,340 --> 01:13:48,340
anymore. And I, crazy. Can you imagine that? You're like, no. You were the

997
01:13:48,340 --> 01:13:52,340
person with her when this still mysterious thing occurred.

998
01:13:52,340 --> 01:13:56,340
Wait, he wasn't on the boat. No, no. You just mean he was working? Yeah. I was like, wait, I didn't read that.

999
01:13:56,340 --> 01:14:00,340
I can't believe what happened. What someone else

1000
01:14:00,340 --> 01:14:04,340
did and I won't say who, but you can, hey, it's up to you to

1001
01:14:04,340 --> 01:14:08,340
go ahead and do your own story together. Check out this big miniature.

1002
01:14:08,340 --> 01:14:12,340
It's pretty funny, right? It's giant, but it's tiny. The rides are gonna be fun.

1003
01:14:12,340 --> 01:14:16,340
That's what we should focus on. But no, a giant in

1004
01:14:16,340 --> 01:14:20,340
the field of early special effects. Yeah. Who, and also in

1005
01:14:20,340 --> 01:14:24,340
experimenting with different frame

1006
01:14:24,340 --> 01:14:28,340
rates to create different crazy effects. So you don't

1007
01:14:28,340 --> 01:14:32,340
have, I don't think, what Peter Jackson later did or

1008
01:14:32,340 --> 01:14:36,340
James Cameron later did with, you know, not standard

1009
01:14:36,340 --> 01:14:40,340
frame rates without this guy. And especially in this ride

1010
01:14:40,340 --> 01:14:44,340
forum, because he started doing everything 60

1011
01:14:44,340 --> 01:14:48,340
frames a second, which did not happen much then, but

1012
01:14:48,340 --> 01:14:52,340
worked really well for ride purposes. Yeah, one of the attractions

1013
01:14:52,340 --> 01:14:56,340
that, the names of the attractions, by the way, Insert of the Obelisk,

1014
01:14:56,340 --> 01:15:00,340
Luxor Live and Theater of Time. Insert of the

1015
01:15:00,340 --> 01:15:04,340
Obelisk, kind of the straight, more straightforward simulator ride,

1016
01:15:04,340 --> 01:15:08,340
Luxor Live, like starts as a talk show with in-person

1017
01:15:08,340 --> 01:15:12,340
actors and then becomes more like CG

1018
01:15:12,340 --> 01:15:16,340
footage and then Theater of Time is like, that's

1019
01:15:16,340 --> 01:15:20,340
the future one. That one I think pretty quickly replaced with just an

1020
01:15:20,340 --> 01:15:24,340
IMAX theater. Regular IMAX. Yeah. So it's all

1021
01:15:24,340 --> 01:15:28,340
screen based, but in this like,

1022
01:15:28,340 --> 01:15:32,340
you know, when that was nearly impossible to do

1023
01:15:32,340 --> 01:15:36,340
in a way that really worked and where you needed people

1024
01:15:36,340 --> 01:15:40,340
who were part scientists to do the math and to

1025
01:15:40,340 --> 01:15:44,340
build the domed screens. What they had to do to do

1026
01:15:44,340 --> 01:15:48,340
this, because, okay, so he, for Back to the Future, the ride

1027
01:15:48,340 --> 01:15:52,340
was not happy. He had to like, we already built the theater, we're stuck,

1028
01:15:52,340 --> 01:15:56,340
can you save it? And he had to like work around that. He got to build these theaters

1029
01:15:56,340 --> 01:16:00,340
from the ground. This guy had a huge say in the layout of the Luxor

1030
01:16:00,340 --> 01:16:04,340
in general. Was involved in building the theaters. He was

1031
01:16:04,340 --> 01:16:08,340
involved in creating a custom robot to paint

1032
01:16:08,340 --> 01:16:12,340
the screens so that the screens were even and you could

1033
01:16:12,340 --> 01:16:16,340
light them correctly, which is also admirable. And then

1034
01:16:16,340 --> 01:16:20,340
you just read about the history of this, that like, the film started going to shit, that nobody

1035
01:16:20,340 --> 01:16:24,340
was maintaining it properly, which happens so often.

1036
01:16:24,340 --> 01:16:28,340
Like it's so, I appreciate the optimism that

1037
01:16:28,340 --> 01:16:32,340
we can put a really top tier technical process

1038
01:16:32,340 --> 01:16:36,340
in this casino and that somebody will take care of it. Because

1039
01:16:36,340 --> 01:16:40,340
I don't, I think a year in, maybe less, maybe as soon as

1040
01:16:40,340 --> 01:16:44,340
Doug Trumbull left town, they're like, alright, and put a 14 year old in there and

1041
01:16:44,340 --> 01:16:48,340
we aren't good. You know it got bad so fast.

1042
01:16:48,340 --> 01:16:52,340
Unless he was, I wonder like, does he, how long does he even stay on

1043
01:16:52,340 --> 01:16:56,340
I don't think this is documented at all, but like how long does he get contracted for

1044
01:16:56,340 --> 01:17:00,340
past opening? Okay, it all works. Does he

1045
01:17:00,340 --> 01:17:04,340
check in on it every six months or after a year he's out? Maybe not, because

1046
01:17:04,340 --> 01:17:08,340
if there's no, yeah, assuming there's no new money in it for him to

1047
01:17:08,340 --> 01:17:12,340
then why would you? He can't. I think

1048
01:17:12,340 --> 01:17:16,340
the whole thing was part of, I found another interview with him where he was saying this was part of

1049
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:20,340
something, okay, he coined this term. He was imagining

1050
01:17:20,340 --> 01:17:24,340
a world full of high impact entertainment centers.

1051
01:17:24,340 --> 01:17:28,340
He wanted there to be a ton of things like what he did

1052
01:17:28,340 --> 01:17:32,340
in Luxor. Every city has something like this where it's a theme park

1053
01:17:32,340 --> 01:17:36,340
and it's high end original movies with a story and that was part

1054
01:17:36,340 --> 01:17:40,340
of it to him. He thought of making them all correlated. They said we want three rides,

1055
01:17:40,340 --> 01:17:44,340
he said the rides should be connected so that you get more invested in these characters

1056
01:17:44,340 --> 01:17:48,340
as you go. You know Schomburg was going to have one of those.

1057
01:17:48,340 --> 01:17:52,340
I suspect somewhere around me would have had one Glendale Galleria or whatever.

1058
01:17:52,340 --> 01:17:56,340
Like, we're King of Prussia Mall. We all, if he got in his way,

1059
01:17:56,340 --> 01:18:00,340
we would have had such insane arch stories

1060
01:18:00,340 --> 01:18:04,340
that our dads don't understand and we're

1061
01:18:04,340 --> 01:18:08,340
begging to keep going back to these weird things that are too adult for us

1062
01:18:08,340 --> 01:18:12,340
and scare us, but we're chasing the scariness. God, I wish he'd got

1063
01:18:12,340 --> 01:18:16,340
his vision of the world. I really have to get behind here

1064
01:18:16,340 --> 01:18:20,340
because he's, we've said this from day one on this podcast, like

1065
01:18:20,340 --> 01:18:24,340
more stuff like this and just like malls. It's exactly what he wanted.

1066
01:18:24,340 --> 01:18:28,340
Film based micro theme parks in shopping malls,

1067
01:18:28,340 --> 01:18:32,340
multiplexes and casinos. That was his whole detailing of his

1068
01:18:32,340 --> 01:18:36,340
vision. Any bit of it that we ever see, we're like, oh look,

1069
01:18:36,340 --> 01:18:40,340
one of those. He wanted there to be everywhere. There was the Vi, I mean,

1070
01:18:40,340 --> 01:18:44,340
there was, you know, Disney Quest. They wanted it everywhere.

1071
01:18:44,340 --> 01:18:48,340
Blockbuster. Blockbuster had that entertainment

1072
01:18:48,340 --> 01:18:52,340
and there was only ever one, maybe two of them. What's that called?

1073
01:18:52,340 --> 01:18:56,340
Entertainment City? Something like that, yeah. And there

1074
01:18:56,340 --> 01:19:00,340
were Sega in Australia. I think there was a Sega

1075
01:19:00,340 --> 01:19:04,340
sponsored thing. There were multiple kinds of things in Japan. There was a Sega thing here. There was

1076
01:19:04,340 --> 01:19:08,340
something called Virtual Land in Luxor too. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Where you could get

1077
01:19:08,340 --> 01:19:12,340
in those like orbs that spin around and go 360. Oh yeah,

1078
01:19:12,340 --> 01:19:16,340
massive arcade here. Yeah, yeah. And rides and

1079
01:19:16,340 --> 01:19:20,340
three attractions, a boat ride, like they were going for the Disney

1080
01:19:20,340 --> 01:19:24,340
dollar here. Oh god. If I ever, just listener, wherever

1081
01:19:24,340 --> 01:19:28,340
you live, just imagine where you know it would be and imagine

1082
01:19:28,340 --> 01:19:32,340
what year it would have disappeared. Yeah. Probably 96 to

1083
01:19:32,340 --> 01:19:36,340
99 sometime. Imagine what the fond memories you would have

1084
01:19:36,340 --> 01:19:40,340
in 1995 of going to this barely attended

1085
01:19:40,340 --> 01:19:44,340
too dense of story theme park near you, you know,

1086
01:19:44,340 --> 01:19:48,340
in whatever, in like Glendale, Arizona. Right. I,

1087
01:19:48,340 --> 01:19:52,340
oh god, oh the world of these I wish was there. There's, I still,

1088
01:19:52,340 --> 01:19:56,340
we're not done yet. This still is trying, like it's not the same thing,

1089
01:19:56,340 --> 01:20:00,340
but like the void was trying even though now that's over. Like this is still

1090
01:20:00,340 --> 01:20:04,340
an idea to put so much more themed garbage everywhere.

1091
01:20:04,340 --> 01:20:08,340
Yeah. I think it can, as we get older and as we

1092
01:20:08,340 --> 01:20:12,340
theme park pill our kids more, I feel like we're just

1093
01:20:12,340 --> 01:20:16,340
priming the world for it. And as shopping malls die, and

1094
01:20:16,340 --> 01:20:20,340
we don't know what else to do with them, they're big crazy spaces, why not

1095
01:20:20,340 --> 01:20:24,340
just turn them into, you know, Meow Wolf we were saying on the second gate

1096
01:20:24,340 --> 01:20:28,340
is a good, you know, they're trying to do these off the beaten path. The thing is, you know,

1097
01:20:28,340 --> 01:20:32,340
crazy experiences in, you know, not the three

1098
01:20:32,340 --> 01:20:36,340
primary cities and without like a billion dollars to do them.

1099
01:20:36,340 --> 01:20:40,340
I'm hopeful. And how long did that Austin Powers Bar last

1100
01:20:40,340 --> 01:20:44,340
in Glendale? That's a themed bar that lasted a couple years. Enough

1101
01:20:44,340 --> 01:20:48,340
for me to go a couple times. I think I went twice. For me to feel some sticky textures of chairs.

1102
01:20:48,340 --> 01:20:52,340
Yeah. See some shady people. Yeah.

1103
01:20:52,340 --> 01:20:56,340
Yeah. Yeah. The dreamers of the world, the trumbles and the

1104
01:20:56,340 --> 01:21:00,340
powers is. The fake powers is. The unauthorized Austin Powers

1105
01:21:00,340 --> 01:21:04,340
Bar. Oh, there was an unauthorized Star Wars bar on Hollywood Boulevard.

1106
01:21:04,340 --> 01:21:08,340
Oh, it's still going. I believe so. Kevin Smith does his shows there still.

1107
01:21:08,340 --> 01:21:12,340
Oh, okay. Pretty sure. I'm pretty sure I see him in front of. So the dream is alive. Yeah.

1108
01:21:12,340 --> 01:21:16,340
I'm pretty sure I see him in front of like the bar. Like the mausoleum looking bar

1109
01:21:16,340 --> 01:21:20,340
when he's talking, talking about flicks. Okay.

1110
01:21:20,340 --> 01:21:24,340
So I think it's still there. I'm saying that it exists. This idea

1111
01:21:24,340 --> 01:21:28,340
exists. It's not dead. Douglas Trumbull had a dream and I think

1112
01:21:28,340 --> 01:21:32,340
it's still alive. Does Kevin still have a key to the Kevin Smith podcast lounge

1113
01:21:32,340 --> 01:21:36,340
on the top floor of the John Lovitz Comedy Club, formerly

1114
01:21:36,340 --> 01:21:40,340
Wizards, you know. What is it now? What is it now? It's nothing.

1115
01:21:40,340 --> 01:21:44,340
It's nothing. It's a bunch of boxes. It's storage and the signs. Bats and bats.

1116
01:21:44,340 --> 01:21:48,340
Is it the third floor of the. I thought it was.

1117
01:21:48,340 --> 01:21:52,340
Yeah. So in the circle in the bamboo ceiling

1118
01:21:52,340 --> 01:21:56,340
area, it was the third floor. It was like at above Carl's. It was later. It was added on

1119
01:21:56,340 --> 01:22:00,340
later. I know, but we're actually, this is really, I would like to know, do you know specifically where it was?

1120
01:22:00,340 --> 01:22:04,340
I don't know. I was never there. I wasn't either and I feel bad that

1121
01:22:04,340 --> 01:22:08,340
I wasn't. There's no diagrams of this. There's no Martin's vids breaking down

1122
01:22:08,340 --> 01:22:12,340
where the Smodcast theater was. But it had to be like above the

1123
01:22:12,340 --> 01:22:16,340
what is it now? What is Carl Strauss now? Oh, it's

1124
01:22:16,340 --> 01:22:20,340
Starbucks, isn't it? Starbucks. It's a Starbucks.

1125
01:22:20,340 --> 01:22:24,340
So above the Starbucks maybe was where John Lovitz. I think you know, no, the other side.

1126
01:22:24,340 --> 01:22:28,340
It's above the. It was next to. Johnny Rockets.

1127
01:22:28,340 --> 01:22:32,340
Oh, OK. I think. And then Wizards, because Wizards, you see the pictures

1128
01:22:32,340 --> 01:22:36,340
of the. But Wizards was the Carl Strauss in Starbucks.

1129
01:22:36,340 --> 01:22:40,340
Or am I completely my geography? I don't know.

1130
01:22:40,340 --> 01:22:44,340
This, it's not well recorded. Interesting.

1131
01:22:44,340 --> 01:22:48,340
It's almost like they thought no one would care about this. No one should even

1132
01:22:48,340 --> 01:22:52,340
we don't need to write down one bit of where any of this is. It's like we have to do, it's like

1133
01:22:52,340 --> 01:22:56,340
we're going to have to do more city walk, though. Yeah.

1134
01:22:56,340 --> 01:23:00,340
Let's keep moving.

1135
01:23:00,340 --> 01:23:04,340
Let's talk about what these actual rides were.

1136
01:23:04,340 --> 01:23:08,340
So they're all there's like a there's like a kind of an aesthetic

1137
01:23:08,340 --> 01:23:12,340
that is strewn through all of them, which is

1138
01:23:12,340 --> 01:23:16,340
like the future of Egypt. And you hear people mention

1139
01:23:16,340 --> 01:23:20,340
in the special how it is the like millions of

1140
01:23:20,340 --> 01:23:24,340
years down the road version of Egyptian

1141
01:23:24,340 --> 01:23:28,340
technology where like they're like anything that the Egyptians

1142
01:23:28,340 --> 01:23:32,340
thought of now is in use in the highest tech way

1143
01:23:32,340 --> 01:23:36,340
and it works great. So every all tech, all human technology

1144
01:23:36,340 --> 01:23:40,340
is ancient Egypt based. But also don't do they say at

1145
01:23:40,340 --> 01:23:44,340
some point and this is a society that came before Egypt

1146
01:23:44,340 --> 01:23:48,340
where it actually got less technologically advanced. Yes, they

1147
01:23:48,340 --> 01:23:52,340
do say that. And because they say the pyramids are like less good versions

1148
01:23:52,340 --> 01:23:56,340
of what were originally built. I think they say both.

1149
01:23:56,340 --> 01:24:00,340
The Luxor is supposedly like a better pyramid than the real pyramids that were

1150
01:24:00,340 --> 01:24:04,340
built because it was built by the people before the

1151
01:24:04,340 --> 01:24:08,340
whatever society before the ancient Egyptians.

1152
01:24:08,340 --> 01:24:12,340
So your hotel is shittier than whatever was there

1153
01:24:12,340 --> 01:24:16,340
before that we don't remember. No, no, the hotel is better.

1154
01:24:16,340 --> 01:24:20,340
The hotel is better than those fucking garbage pyramids in Egypt

1155
01:24:20,340 --> 01:24:24,340
and the crap old casinos. Yeah, yeah. Then the real pyramids.

1156
01:24:24,340 --> 01:24:28,340
I'm sorry, then the crap old pyramids. Yes, that's right.

1157
01:24:28,340 --> 01:24:32,340
I think that's what I got from the special at least. Wow. Okay. So we're

1158
01:24:32,340 --> 01:24:36,340
introducing like an entire race of people

1159
01:24:36,340 --> 01:24:40,340
that has mostly vanished and then also a whole

1160
01:24:40,340 --> 01:24:44,340
future based on ancient technology. Yes.

1161
01:24:44,340 --> 01:24:48,340
All right. So Dad with a big yard, are you

1162
01:24:48,340 --> 01:24:52,340
ready now? So are you ready to learn about ancient but future

1163
01:24:52,340 --> 01:24:56,340
technologies and peoples? Yes, yes. Dad who just wants to

1164
01:24:56,340 --> 01:25:00,340
gamble and just take a nap.

1165
01:25:00,340 --> 01:25:04,340
Gamble with the big cup. The cup that had your quarter.

1166
01:25:04,340 --> 01:25:08,340
Yeah, your coins. Oh man, yeah. Do you miss the big cup?

1167
01:25:08,340 --> 01:25:12,340
Did you ever do the big cup? Growing up so close to Atlantic City,

1168
01:25:12,340 --> 01:25:16,340
there were definitely relatives who would like, if we would see them

1169
01:25:16,340 --> 01:25:20,340
they'd be like, hey, here's a big cup. You know, this is good for the beach.

1170
01:25:20,340 --> 01:25:24,340
And honestly, the big cups were good for building sandcastles.

1171
01:25:24,340 --> 01:25:28,340
Oh, so you get their big coin cup but it was empty. Yes. And I hope

1172
01:25:28,340 --> 01:25:32,340
cleaned before anything was drank. Oh, cleaned. My mom was definitely big on like,

1173
01:25:32,340 --> 01:25:36,340
yeah, clean that because it's probably disgusting. Yeah, clean your

1174
01:25:36,340 --> 01:25:40,340
coin cup. Clean the coin cup before you take it to the beach.

1175
01:25:40,340 --> 01:25:44,340
So, first one, you were

1176
01:25:44,340 --> 01:25:48,340
supposed to do this in an order. Yes, yes. And Doug Trumbull was

1177
01:25:48,340 --> 01:25:52,340
frustrated that they did not force people to do it in the order

1178
01:25:52,340 --> 01:25:56,340
that he wanted. I love this maniac. Yeah, I was able to do the second one first

1179
01:25:56,340 --> 01:26:00,340
and the third one, the second, and I went, oh, it all went haywire.

1180
01:26:00,340 --> 01:26:04,340
So, but if you did it under Trumbull's vision, you started

1181
01:26:04,340 --> 01:26:08,340
within search of the obelisk. Can we even

1182
01:26:08,340 --> 01:26:12,340
How would, I don't think I am capable of describing

1183
01:26:12,340 --> 01:26:16,340
the story of in search of the obelisk. These things, and they're not

1184
01:26:16,340 --> 01:26:20,340
There's precisely one video of the actual ride other than brief

1185
01:26:20,340 --> 01:26:24,340
clips in the special and it is like, it's somebody filming one

1186
01:26:24,340 --> 01:26:28,340
corner of the screen. You don't know what the hell is going on. Yeah. It's tough.

1187
01:26:28,340 --> 01:26:32,340
Let's try to, as if sifting through ancient ruins, can we put it together?

1188
01:26:32,340 --> 01:26:36,340
Okay, you're in a ride vehicle that is called the monolith?

1189
01:26:36,340 --> 01:26:40,340
The monolev. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Mono-lev.

1190
01:26:40,340 --> 01:26:44,340
A monolith is a full, I know. I believe the architect character is like

1191
01:26:44,340 --> 01:26:48,340
oh, I guess you're coming with me. Mack. Yes.

1192
01:26:48,340 --> 01:26:52,340
Yes, an archaeologist. Yes. Mack.

1193
01:26:52,340 --> 01:26:56,340
Wait, I had it earlier. His last name. It was Mack.

1194
01:26:56,340 --> 01:27:00,340
Tonight. It's Mack McPherson. Okay. It's Mack McPherson.

1195
01:27:00,340 --> 01:27:04,340
And then you've got Cricket. No, that was just the one woman doing the ride. Cricket's not in the video.

1196
01:27:04,340 --> 01:27:08,340
Cricket's not in the rides. And then you've, he has, Mack has a friend

1197
01:27:08,340 --> 01:27:12,340
named Karina. And Karina is gone because she is in search

1198
01:27:12,340 --> 01:27:16,340
of the obelisk. So we need to find Karina

1199
01:27:16,340 --> 01:27:20,340
because she's my friend. Right. And maybe in doing so

1200
01:27:20,340 --> 01:27:24,340
also get the obelisk. Now I don't know what is crucial about

1201
01:27:24,340 --> 01:27:28,340
this obelisk. Maybe we don't know yet, actually. Yeah. That might be something we don't

1202
01:27:28,340 --> 01:27:32,340
learn until Luxor Live. So

1203
01:27:32,340 --> 01:27:36,340
do we miss anything? Well, I mean there's like villains. Well, yeah, you go through, well, okay,

1204
01:27:36,340 --> 01:27:40,340
just like what happens, I guess. Yeah, yeah. But yeah, with the villains you want to.

1205
01:27:40,340 --> 01:27:44,340
Well, I don't know. I just, I don't really know what they are. He's fighting a villain, like Mack, so

1206
01:27:44,340 --> 01:27:48,340
you're in a basic simulator, like Back to the Future something. And on the screen

1207
01:27:48,340 --> 01:27:52,340
Mack is basically on the front of your vehicle.

1208
01:27:52,340 --> 01:27:56,340
So it makes it look like he's hanging out like right on the tip or the hood of your

1209
01:27:56,340 --> 01:28:00,340
obelisk. He's on there with you. Yeah. Or model. Kind of surfing it.

1210
01:28:00,340 --> 01:28:04,340
Does he steer it? He like has a steering mechanism. Yeah. Yes. Up there too.

1211
01:28:04,340 --> 01:28:08,340
From the pictures, that's sort of what I can decipher. And yeah,

1212
01:28:08,340 --> 01:28:12,340
you're going through like a grimy looking

1213
01:28:12,340 --> 01:28:16,340
practical effects sets shot with cameras.

1214
01:28:16,340 --> 01:28:20,340
Giant miniatures, motion control cameras.

1215
01:28:20,340 --> 01:28:24,340
And by the way, like, you know, regardless of story, which is

1216
01:28:24,340 --> 01:28:28,340
hard to figure out, the cool thing is if you like Back to the

1217
01:28:28,340 --> 01:28:32,340
Future the Ride very much, it is same director and thus it is

1218
01:28:32,340 --> 01:28:36,340
really similar aesthetic, shot on similar film, shot on

1219
01:28:36,340 --> 01:28:40,340
same kind of camera. Like just the

1220
01:28:40,340 --> 01:28:44,340
degree of visual effects are very similar. And like compositing

1221
01:28:44,340 --> 01:28:48,340
and the way he lights it and the way light is treated. And Alan

1222
01:28:48,340 --> 01:28:52,340
Silvestri score as well. So this was kind of a

1223
01:28:52,340 --> 01:28:56,340
second Back to the Future ride that was only in Las Vegas.

1224
01:28:56,340 --> 01:29:00,340
So that's pretty notable. It is. Yeah. And it is. It is. Look, it looks some of some of the

1225
01:29:00,340 --> 01:29:04,340
scenes almost look like Mortal Kombat, the movie I've talked about Mortal Kombat

1226
01:29:04,340 --> 01:29:08,340
recently. Yeah. A fan of Mortal Kombat. You've seen Mortal Kombat, Jason? I

1227
01:29:08,340 --> 01:29:12,340
years ago. You got to watch it. Yeah, I got to rewatch. We should. There's some broader

1228
01:29:12,340 --> 01:29:16,340
way. I mean, we will certainly throw in movies that we want to watch. Yeah.

1229
01:29:16,340 --> 01:29:20,340
And talk about them, especially on the second game. But is there some way to frame it that it's like the PTR

1230
01:29:20,340 --> 01:29:24,340
Canon? Just that we are we talking about the films that we think are the most fundamental to us

1231
01:29:24,340 --> 01:29:28,340
as people, but also better the most theme parky and the most in line

1232
01:29:28,340 --> 01:29:32,340
with like. Oh, yeah. Like David Hasselhoff, Nick Fury.

1233
01:29:32,340 --> 01:29:36,340
Yeah. I mean, I've never seen it. I'll put it in the PTR Canon. I can only assume.

1234
01:29:36,340 --> 01:29:40,340
But if people are down for more of that

1235
01:29:40,340 --> 01:29:44,340
then you get some Batman forever, I would imagine. Well, of course. Yeah, you'd have to.

1236
01:29:44,340 --> 01:29:48,340
If you have a better name, if you have a name for the PTR Canon, throw it out there too. Good question.

1237
01:29:48,340 --> 01:29:52,340
But mainly find proof of the fans. That's

1238
01:29:52,340 --> 01:29:56,340
task number one. I send you in search of the fans as Karina is

1239
01:29:56,340 --> 01:30:00,340
in search of the obelisk.

1240
01:30:00,340 --> 01:30:04,340
I love I do love what I can see from this. Yeah.

1241
01:30:04,340 --> 01:30:08,340
Yeah. Big fights happening on the front of the going through like

1242
01:30:08,340 --> 01:30:12,340
it's an underground pyramid and there's a bunch of giant floating

1243
01:30:12,340 --> 01:30:16,340
obelisks, but not ones you can grab. Yeah, those are like

1244
01:30:16,340 --> 01:30:20,340
levitating. You got to weave through them and not crash the I almost

1245
01:30:20,340 --> 01:30:24,340
think there's no I'm trying to think and back to the future. No one's ever on the

1246
01:30:24,340 --> 01:30:28,340
hood of the car and back to the future. No. Yeah, that's a lot more ambitious. All the

1247
01:30:28,340 --> 01:30:32,340
characters are on the screen in front of you. So that's way more ambitious. This is almost like a precursor

1248
01:30:32,340 --> 01:30:36,340
to Spider-Man, the Islands of Adventure ride.

1249
01:30:36,340 --> 01:30:40,340
Where you're really getting it's a simulator, but you're getting characters up front

1250
01:30:40,340 --> 01:30:44,340
which gives you that, you know, personal touch that you might want from

1251
01:30:44,340 --> 01:30:48,340
a dark ride. Intimacy. Intimacy, if you will. Well, some of the

1252
01:30:48,340 --> 01:30:52,340
stuff is also precursors to like the

1253
01:30:52,340 --> 01:30:56,340
soaring fly like they figured out like, OK, here's how we do kind of a

1254
01:30:56,340 --> 01:31:00,340
flying theater before the soaring flying

1255
01:31:00,340 --> 01:31:04,340
theater comes along. Yeah. Yeah. Also you mentioned Spider-Man

1256
01:31:04,340 --> 01:31:08,340
a company that worked on that later worked

1257
01:31:08,340 --> 01:31:12,340
on this called Kleiser-Wolzak. Oh, I did do that.

1258
01:31:12,340 --> 01:31:16,340
Also part of Honey Has Shrunk the Audience, part of Azillian Things and seems like

1259
01:31:16,340 --> 01:31:20,340
one of them is a prolific director, but one of either Kleiser or Wolzak

1260
01:31:20,340 --> 01:31:24,340
built the sculpted the Michael Jackson history

1261
01:31:24,340 --> 01:31:28,340
statue. Really? Remember that? Remember when they were sending big scary

1262
01:31:28,340 --> 01:31:32,340
statues all over the globe and one of them is still in a McDonald's

1263
01:31:32,340 --> 01:31:36,340
parking lot? Oh yeah. In possibly Russia? Am I making

1264
01:31:36,340 --> 01:31:40,340
that up? It's definitely somewhere weird. I don't know. There's still

1265
01:31:40,340 --> 01:31:44,340
Michael Jackson's scary statues floating out there all over this world

1266
01:31:44,340 --> 01:31:48,340
of ours and made by the same, which I understand like aesthetically I see

1267
01:31:48,340 --> 01:31:52,340
what you know, the big ancient ruins and statues make sense. So

1268
01:31:52,340 --> 01:31:56,340
you have, yeah, some Spider-Man folks cut their teeth on these. To keep

1269
01:31:56,340 --> 01:32:00,340
in perspective the CG and the footage

1270
01:32:00,340 --> 01:32:04,340
stuff, at one point they talked to like the engineer, like the

1271
01:32:04,340 --> 01:32:08,340
computer guys working on this and they're like, and we've got a specially

1272
01:32:08,340 --> 01:32:12,340
made computer and like one image from this is 90

1273
01:32:12,340 --> 01:32:16,340
megabytes and that would fill up someone's home PC

1274
01:32:16,340 --> 01:32:20,340
instantly. Oh my God. And it's like, I think

1275
01:32:20,340 --> 01:32:24,340
I clipped, I think I screen recorded a clip from the special

1276
01:32:24,340 --> 01:32:28,340
that probably is like around 90

1277
01:32:28,340 --> 01:32:32,340
megabytes. Oh it's got to be more probably depending. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. No, our notes files.

1278
01:32:32,340 --> 01:32:36,340
Like 20 seconds of HD footage, of HD footage

1279
01:32:36,340 --> 01:32:40,340
of standard death special. My God. Yeah. Wow.

1280
01:32:40,340 --> 01:32:44,340
There is some bad looking CGI in this too. Oh yeah. But that's

1281
01:32:44,340 --> 01:32:48,340
to be. You got some typical mummy kind of,

1282
01:32:48,340 --> 01:32:52,340
right. But there's so much practical stuff and it looks, it just looks

1283
01:32:52,340 --> 01:32:56,340
like a weird kind of low budget 90s

1284
01:32:56,340 --> 01:33:00,340
movie like this. I don't know. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, totally.

1285
01:33:00,340 --> 01:33:04,340
Which is, you know, and it's shot well where you even take, you know,

1286
01:33:04,340 --> 01:33:08,340
even like some dumb movie is still like,

1287
01:33:08,340 --> 01:33:12,340
is there a movie called like the Great Panda Adventure? Does that sound familiar?

1288
01:33:12,340 --> 01:33:16,340
Let me not go into that movie. What about like Warriors of Virtue? Even Warriors of Virtue

1289
01:33:16,340 --> 01:33:20,340
shot on beautiful pristine film movie. Yeah.

1290
01:33:20,340 --> 01:33:24,340
Nobody's really seeing or liking. Apologies to Virtue heads out there.

1291
01:33:24,340 --> 01:33:28,340
The poster for the ride looks bad, I would say. Yes.

1292
01:33:28,340 --> 01:33:32,340
The poster looks shitty. I think the cityscapes look best.

1293
01:33:32,340 --> 01:33:36,340
Cause they're just practical miniatures. What you're showing looks like some

1294
01:33:36,340 --> 01:33:40,340
like creepy. It's like,

1295
01:33:40,340 --> 01:33:44,340
I was gonna say a Christian movie, but I mean like the shadiest

1296
01:33:44,340 --> 01:33:48,340
of Christian movies. A Christian movie with an agenda.

1297
01:33:48,340 --> 01:33:52,340
It's the ships that the Animorphs travel in, you know,

1298
01:33:52,340 --> 01:33:56,340
on the covers. There's things I like about the poster, but the poster overall

1299
01:33:56,340 --> 01:34:00,340
doesn't look as cool as it should. Pretty cruddy.

1300
01:34:00,340 --> 01:34:04,340
There's somebody named Claggart and he's yelling

1301
01:34:04,340 --> 01:34:08,340
get off of Claggart! But I don't really know what

1302
01:34:08,340 --> 01:34:12,340
Claggart is. And then there's also, there's another enemy whose name

1303
01:34:12,340 --> 01:34:16,340
is Dr. Osiris. I forget if he's part of this

1304
01:34:16,340 --> 01:34:20,340
first one or if you meet him later. But Dr. Osiris is also part

1305
01:34:20,340 --> 01:34:24,340
of the Luxerverse. The secretverse.

1306
01:34:24,340 --> 01:34:28,340
The Piraverse. I'm not sure which verse it is.

1307
01:34:28,340 --> 01:34:32,340
Do you think, cause I don't know, I forget what year

1308
01:34:32,340 --> 01:34:36,340
MGM bought this, but does MGM now own the IP

1309
01:34:36,340 --> 01:34:40,340
of all of this? Oh fuck. Probably. I don't know. Or does Circus Circus

1310
01:34:40,340 --> 01:34:44,340
still? Or yeah maybe. And what is Circus Circus anymore? Did Circus Circus

1311
01:34:44,340 --> 01:34:48,340
get swallowed into something? Cause the hotel itself I think is only

1312
01:34:48,340 --> 01:34:52,340
that. I don't think they are major landholders in general.

1313
01:34:52,340 --> 01:34:56,340
Yeah maybe. So yeah, does like Circus Company, I think the name

1314
01:34:56,340 --> 01:35:00,340
was the Circus Company maybe? Could be. Before, yeah did they own Mac

1315
01:35:00,340 --> 01:35:04,340
and Dr. Osiris? Dr. Osiris. I'm now, I love a good

1316
01:35:04,340 --> 01:35:08,340
crazy doctor name. Yeah. I want to know what else can be done

1317
01:35:08,340 --> 01:35:12,340
with Dr. Osiris. Yeah we'll put that into the- I don't think I know what he looks like or how to find

1318
01:35:12,340 --> 01:35:16,340
a picture of him or if anyone saved a picture of him. Doesn't matter, we'll re-imagine

1319
01:35:16,340 --> 01:35:20,340
that. I love his name. I think Circus Circus might technically

1320
01:35:20,340 --> 01:35:24,340
be under the MGM brand. Is that right? Cause I think it shows up

1321
01:35:24,340 --> 01:35:28,340
in some of those iPhone games. You can go

1322
01:35:28,340 --> 01:35:32,340
to Circus Circus. Oh right, right, right. Yeah maybe. That's probably right

1323
01:35:32,340 --> 01:35:36,340
if they're showing up there. They might be trying to sell it off although

1324
01:35:36,340 --> 01:35:40,340
if you look up Luxor and like

1325
01:35:40,340 --> 01:35:44,340
there's lots of Google question results of like will the Luxor

1326
01:35:44,340 --> 01:35:48,340
be destroyed? Like will it be demolished or closed?

1327
01:35:48,340 --> 01:35:52,340
Yeah will it suck inside itself and go to another realm? Yeah.

1328
01:35:52,340 --> 01:35:56,340
There's talk about different floors being like, has the basement

1329
01:35:56,340 --> 01:36:00,340
been condemned? Wait a minute.

1330
01:36:00,340 --> 01:36:04,340
I was just gonna say MGM bought it in 2007 so like all this stuff was long gone

1331
01:36:04,340 --> 01:36:08,340
but I wonder if in the language of the sale they

1332
01:36:08,340 --> 01:36:12,340
said and we also buy the rights in perpetuity to Dr.

1333
01:36:12,340 --> 01:36:16,340
Osiris, Carina, Mac,

1334
01:36:16,340 --> 01:36:20,340
the Obelisk. The Obelisk itself, the Maglevs. Yeah right.

1335
01:36:20,340 --> 01:36:24,340
Yeah. Is it just floating out order? And if they ignore it, I say if you

1336
01:36:24,340 --> 01:36:28,340
find that contract and you do a little find and search and you don't

1337
01:36:28,340 --> 01:36:32,340
find Dr. Osiris or Maglev that means they're up for grabs and

1338
01:36:32,340 --> 01:36:36,340
we can make a very frustrating graphic novel about all of this.

1339
01:36:36,340 --> 01:36:40,340
Oh yeah. Yeah. Oh and trust me any of the publishers

1340
01:36:40,340 --> 01:36:44,340
that would, there's a lot of indie comics

1341
01:36:44,340 --> 01:36:48,340
publishers now that it's like yeah we'll get your comic out, we'll get a public

1342
01:36:48,340 --> 01:36:52,340
and they like pay dog shit rates and they're like and of course

1343
01:36:52,340 --> 01:36:56,340
we'll keep the intellectual property and we will immediately

1344
01:36:56,340 --> 01:37:00,340
start selling it to the major studios. No way. We're not doing that.

1345
01:37:00,340 --> 01:37:04,340
We have to learn the lesson of Aaron Fector who would not give up his

1346
01:37:04,340 --> 01:37:08,340
intellectual property of his characters, the beloved

1347
01:37:08,340 --> 01:37:12,340
Rock of Fire explosion and he kept them and he holds them proudly

1348
01:37:12,340 --> 01:37:16,340
they're the greatest weapon in his arsenal. Oh my goodness. As soon as he figures out

1349
01:37:16,340 --> 01:37:20,340
anything anybody wants to do with them he's back on top.

1350
01:37:20,340 --> 01:37:24,340
He crushes Chuck E. Cheese because he wouldn't let them pilfer

1351
01:37:24,340 --> 01:37:28,340
his valuable IP. Don't count him out yet.

1352
01:37:28,340 --> 01:37:32,340
He's scheming in that warehouse that has room for 400 people but

1353
01:37:32,340 --> 01:37:36,340
it's just him and a bunch of like Billy Bob's robot

1354
01:37:36,340 --> 01:37:40,340
oil spilled everywhere. He has a bunch of rotting Billy Bob's

1355
01:37:40,340 --> 01:37:44,340
that will sometimes move and he's like oh is it coming, is my creation

1356
01:37:44,340 --> 01:37:48,340
becoming real and then just a bunch of rats crawl out of it.

1357
01:37:48,340 --> 01:37:52,340
He could have had some of the Five Nights at Freddy's money, he could have had

1358
01:37:52,340 --> 01:37:56,340
like the at least the current weird Alf where it's like oh

1359
01:37:56,340 --> 01:38:00,340
yeah, Alf's back. They're doing some short

1360
01:38:00,340 --> 01:38:04,340
they're doing mobile commercials? Yeah the Mint Mobile like Ryan Reynolds

1361
01:38:04,340 --> 01:38:08,340
has teamed up with Alf for Mint Mobile commercials. That's so freaking epic.

1362
01:38:08,340 --> 01:38:12,340
Yeah, you better believe it.

1363
01:38:12,340 --> 01:38:16,340
Okay I think that covers In Search of the Obelisk

1364
01:38:16,340 --> 01:38:20,340
except, spoiler, you do not get the Obelisk.

1365
01:38:20,340 --> 01:38:24,340
You get what's important. You save Karina, Mac's best friend

1366
01:38:24,340 --> 01:38:28,340
or lover or associate or maybe he has better friends. I don't know.

1367
01:38:28,340 --> 01:38:32,340
Karina matters to Mac and you get her. On to the Maglev.

1368
01:38:32,340 --> 01:38:36,340
But you don't get the Obelisk. So we're still in search of the Obelisk

1369
01:38:36,340 --> 01:38:40,340
after In Search of the Obelisk. Do they call in that special, do they call like the

1370
01:38:40,340 --> 01:38:44,340
two of them like quintessentially 90's or something? No maybe. They describe

1371
01:38:44,340 --> 01:38:48,340
then? They say that within the 90's? Maybe they don't say quintessential but they definitely

1372
01:38:48,340 --> 01:38:52,340
say both of them are like typical 90's people.

1373
01:38:52,340 --> 01:38:56,340
And by that they mean white? I guess. Yeah, the most generic

1374
01:38:56,340 --> 01:39:00,340
white humans. Boring?

1375
01:39:00,340 --> 01:39:04,340
So then if you continue

1376
01:39:04,340 --> 01:39:08,340
the story or if you realize that this is what you're supposed to do

1377
01:39:08,340 --> 01:39:12,340
apparently, I think this footage where you enter the ride and it says episode

1378
01:39:12,340 --> 01:39:16,340
one really big on it as if like, so you get it? These rides

1379
01:39:16,340 --> 01:39:20,340
are episodes and I think the tourists partially drunk probably

1380
01:39:20,340 --> 01:39:24,340
did not. But if you went to episode two that was Luxor

1381
01:39:24,340 --> 01:39:28,340
Live. Luxor Live is an out of this world talk show where you will behold

1382
01:39:28,340 --> 01:39:32,340
a fabulous 3D solar eclipse. It's kind of like a campy

1383
01:39:32,340 --> 01:39:36,340
version of Geraldo. Now I'm lost.

1384
01:39:36,340 --> 01:39:40,340
What does this mean? Now I'm in! I just don't think I get it.

1385
01:39:40,340 --> 01:39:44,340
Luxor, okay, so and now we're in the present. That's the idea.

1386
01:39:44,340 --> 01:39:48,340
The idea here is that Luxor, the casino you're staying at, has

1387
01:39:48,340 --> 01:39:52,340
a live Geraldo-esque talk show. Yeah. And

1388
01:39:52,340 --> 01:39:56,340
It's not like the serious Geraldo show that you're used to.

1389
01:39:56,340 --> 01:40:00,340
The straight ahead, very played, like a news

1390
01:40:00,340 --> 01:40:04,340
piece of serious news Geraldo show. No, no, no. This was the wild

1391
01:40:04,340 --> 01:40:08,340
times with the weirdos where he's getting into fights. Yeah.

1392
01:40:08,340 --> 01:40:12,340
I guess. So, alright. The visitors

1393
01:40:12,340 --> 01:40:16,340
are part of a studio audience of a fake TV talk show with a debate

1394
01:40:16,340 --> 01:40:20,340
between, well when Luxor Live, today Luxor Live,

1395
01:40:20,340 --> 01:40:24,340
alright everybody having fun at the casino, you're hanging out by the pool. Well today we've got a treat

1396
01:40:24,340 --> 01:40:28,340
for you. We've got archaeologist Mac McPherson and Colonel

1397
01:40:28,340 --> 01:40:32,340
Claggart and they are going to have a debate about ruins

1398
01:40:32,340 --> 01:40:36,340
and whether we should use technology to get

1399
01:40:36,340 --> 01:40:40,340
items from the past and bring them to modern times.

1400
01:40:40,340 --> 01:40:44,340
I guess, I guess. Yeah. I suppose. This all happens

1401
01:40:44,340 --> 01:40:48,340
in front of a talk show set that has a Johnny Carson-esque

1402
01:40:48,340 --> 01:40:52,340
cityscape but it is not of Hollywood.

1403
01:40:52,340 --> 01:40:56,340
It is of the two properties that Circus Circus owns.

1404
01:40:56,340 --> 01:41:00,340
So there's a big Circus Circus clown and there is the Excalibur Castle.

1405
01:41:00,340 --> 01:41:04,340
And in this setting there is a debate about archaeology that happens

1406
01:41:04,340 --> 01:41:08,340
before a live studio audience. Now here's what I've always tried to figure

1407
01:41:08,340 --> 01:41:12,340
out. I first saw this special a few years ago.

1408
01:41:12,340 --> 01:41:16,340
Did they have the actor who played Mac McPherson

1409
01:41:16,340 --> 01:41:20,340
on retainer to be there in person or did they

1410
01:41:20,340 --> 01:41:24,340
just like, alright we need a white guy with brown hair.

1411
01:41:24,340 --> 01:41:28,340
They can't have right. And he's far enough away. Well they'd have to have

1412
01:41:28,340 --> 01:41:32,340
multiple Macs I would assume. I would assume. I think maybe that's the idea.

1413
01:41:32,340 --> 01:41:36,340
I bet. I bet that's just like Terminator 2 kind of deal.

1414
01:41:36,340 --> 01:41:40,340
I would think. Yeah. You couldn't count on Mac forever.

1415
01:41:40,340 --> 01:41:44,340
Something that I'm confused about though is when it transitions from

1416
01:41:44,340 --> 01:41:48,340
live to movie because a comment

1417
01:41:48,340 --> 01:41:52,340
I read somewhere, somebody described being there as a kid and then

1418
01:41:52,340 --> 01:41:56,340
thinking this thing was confusing and unremarkable until one of the actors exploded

1419
01:41:56,340 --> 01:42:00,340
into particles. And so then I don't understand.

1420
01:42:00,340 --> 01:42:04,340
I don't know if like what if all, it seems like it was live actors but what if some of it

1421
01:42:04,340 --> 01:42:08,340
was projected or I don't know or there was a screen in front of them that made a

1422
01:42:08,340 --> 01:42:12,340
I don't know. Whatever was going on here maybe this ended up being actually the coolest effects

1423
01:42:12,340 --> 01:42:16,340
wise due to the surprise of it. And then like the screen cracks apart

1424
01:42:16,340 --> 01:42:20,340
and you go into like a fully. It seems like Terminator 2. It does seem

1425
01:42:20,340 --> 01:42:24,340
like T2. Like that really like there's. You don't know it's screens

1426
01:42:24,340 --> 01:42:28,340
until something crazy happens. But then you watch a bunch of

1427
01:42:28,340 --> 01:42:32,340
Crystal dance. Oh I love the Crystal dancers.

1428
01:42:32,340 --> 01:42:36,340
They are touting the liquid. Are they Crystal dancers or liquid dancers?

1429
01:42:36,340 --> 01:42:40,340
I saw Crystal. Crystal figures. But I don't know what I got this from.

1430
01:42:40,340 --> 01:42:44,340
They are talking up those Crystal figure dancers in that special

1431
01:42:44,340 --> 01:42:48,340
as well where they're like and they like captured real life human

1432
01:42:48,340 --> 01:42:52,340
movements to make these new. Like they're really blown away

1433
01:42:52,340 --> 01:42:56,340
by these and obviously. They did MoCa. They did MoCa. Yeah essentially

1434
01:42:56,340 --> 01:43:00,340
original avatar. Yeah. Yes. But it sounds like

1435
01:43:00,340 --> 01:43:04,340
dry description of this. First liquid human beings

1436
01:43:04,340 --> 01:43:08,340
emerge from the life giving source of water then solidify into male

1437
01:43:08,340 --> 01:43:12,340
and female glass dancers moving in harmony. But they

1438
01:43:12,340 --> 01:43:16,340
soon grow wary of each other. Put on armor and start fighting.

1439
01:43:16,340 --> 01:43:20,340
Culminating in a nuclear blast. This is sounding

1440
01:43:20,340 --> 01:43:24,340
a little obtuse. A little or like

1441
01:43:24,340 --> 01:43:28,340
too pointed or I don't know.

1442
01:43:28,340 --> 01:43:32,340
I'm very. Would I love Luxor Live or

1443
01:43:32,340 --> 01:43:36,340
does Luxor Live collapse this entire experience? It's a good

1444
01:43:36,340 --> 01:43:40,340
question. I could see there being a lot of cringy stuff during Luxor Live

1445
01:43:40,340 --> 01:43:44,340
but I don't know that the dancers were as impressive as they thought.

1446
01:43:44,340 --> 01:43:48,340
But if somebody blew up into particles. It does look like the

1447
01:43:48,340 --> 01:43:52,340
eventual TLC waterfalls video.

1448
01:43:52,340 --> 01:43:56,340
Which was very impressive to the MTV viewers of 1995.

1449
01:43:56,340 --> 01:44:00,340
However, the technology was probably

1450
01:44:00,340 --> 01:44:04,340
better then. You accept things a little jankier in a

1451
01:44:04,340 --> 01:44:08,340
music video maybe. I don't know. This when I was

1452
01:44:08,340 --> 01:44:12,340
reading at Luxor I discovered. I had seen it years

1453
01:44:12,340 --> 01:44:16,340
ago but I didn't put it all together. Or it didn't

1454
01:44:16,340 --> 01:44:20,340
really mean anything to me. But the getting jiggy with it music

1455
01:44:20,340 --> 01:44:24,340
video is filmed in the Luxor lobby and then they're in front

1456
01:44:24,340 --> 01:44:28,340
of the Mirage volcano and then they're in front of New York, New York.

1457
01:44:28,340 --> 01:44:32,340
Yeah. It's kind of like traveling

1458
01:44:32,340 --> 01:44:36,340
all over but by way of just Las Vegas.

1459
01:44:36,340 --> 01:44:40,340
It really encapsulates that era and all of the big silliness

1460
01:44:40,340 --> 01:44:44,340
going on. And specifically the one side of Las Vegas Boulevard.

1461
01:44:44,340 --> 01:44:48,340
Yeah, yeah true. Does he not do kind of like walk like an

1462
01:44:48,340 --> 01:44:52,340
Egyptian dancing? Is he not in sort of a headdress?

1463
01:44:52,340 --> 01:44:56,340
I believe he is. He is and the backup dancers are. Yeah

1464
01:44:56,340 --> 01:45:00,340
there's a lot of Egyptian stuff.

1465
01:45:00,340 --> 01:45:04,340
Maybe he saw these shows and started thinking about like wow so there's some crazy

1466
01:45:04,340 --> 01:45:08,340
stuff out there. I should maybe pursue like you know I passed by this building

1467
01:45:08,340 --> 01:45:12,340
that said Scientology on it. I wonder if that has anything to do with

1468
01:45:12,340 --> 01:45:16,340
the. That's very possible. Is Colonel Claggart

1469
01:45:16,340 --> 01:45:20,340
part of that? Is there a scientist part of that obelisk obelisk in

1470
01:45:20,340 --> 01:45:24,340
Scientology? What are the secrets of the obelisk? Maybe Scientology will open me

1471
01:45:24,340 --> 01:45:28,340
up to those secrets. Is this Douglas Trumbull was just maybe trying to create a

1472
01:45:28,340 --> 01:45:32,340
religion based on an obelisk? Maybe obeliskology. Yeah

1473
01:45:32,340 --> 01:45:36,340
this is different. The Luxor was going to be the center of obeliskology.

1474
01:45:36,340 --> 01:45:40,340
The celebrity center of his new religion. All hail the obelisk.

1475
01:45:40,340 --> 01:45:44,340
Did someone find the other like pop music connection?

1476
01:45:44,340 --> 01:45:48,340
No I didn't. That when Tupac Shakur was killed

1477
01:45:48,340 --> 01:45:52,340
in Vegas. He took a picture here the night I saw

1478
01:45:52,340 --> 01:45:56,340
he was staying here. Whoa. Oh I didn't know that.

1479
01:45:56,340 --> 01:46:00,340
He gets killed elsewhere in Vegas.

1480
01:46:00,340 --> 01:46:04,340
He was staying. Someone of his wealth at the time

1481
01:46:04,340 --> 01:46:08,340
was staying at the crappiest hotel. Well maybe

1482
01:46:08,340 --> 01:46:12,340
in 96 it was still okay. I don't know. Wow. Do you think

1483
01:46:12,340 --> 01:46:16,340
I'll just type it into Google. Did Tupac meet Dr.

1484
01:46:16,340 --> 01:46:20,340
Obelisk and Colonel Claggart? Did he go to the rides?

1485
01:46:20,340 --> 01:46:24,340
Very good question. That's so creepy. There is a room at that hotel

1486
01:46:24,340 --> 01:46:28,340
that is the, it could have been where you were staying where it was

1487
01:46:28,340 --> 01:46:32,340
like the room that Tupac did not return back to that night.

1488
01:46:32,340 --> 01:46:36,340
Jesus. My God. Yeah. This place really

1489
01:46:36,340 --> 01:46:40,340
is, this place does need to fold into itself.

1490
01:46:40,340 --> 01:46:44,340
Like a priest needs to come or an army of priests from different

1491
01:46:44,340 --> 01:46:48,340
religions. From a real religion. Yeah from the good religion, Christianity

1492
01:46:48,340 --> 01:46:52,340
the one that makes sense. The ultimate 90's religion.

1493
01:46:52,340 --> 01:46:56,340
Get the top priest from each state and

1494
01:46:56,340 --> 01:47:00,340
get them over to Luxor to get the spirits out of there.

1495
01:47:00,340 --> 01:47:04,340
Everyone hold hands, surround the building. Yes. Then and only then

1496
01:47:04,340 --> 01:47:08,340
will it return. Now of course Carrot Top can keep playing there. He's not part of the

1497
01:47:08,340 --> 01:47:12,340
curse. No he's good. He helps fend off the curse. He balances the

1498
01:47:12,340 --> 01:47:16,340
life. He balances the bad with the light. Carrot Top is a force of light.

1499
01:47:16,340 --> 01:47:20,340
Wikipedia says so Tupac was at the Tyson

1500
01:47:20,340 --> 01:47:24,340
fight at the MGM Grand and then there was a brawl

1501
01:47:24,340 --> 01:47:28,340
and it says after the brawl Shakur returned to his hotel, the

1502
01:47:28,340 --> 01:47:32,340
Luxor Las Vegas. Wow. He went back there? Yeah.

1503
01:47:32,340 --> 01:47:36,340
He stopped there first. Whoa. That's insane.

1504
01:47:36,340 --> 01:47:40,340
I believe he was killed closer to Flamingo Road. I forget the

1505
01:47:40,340 --> 01:47:44,340
intersection. Yeah I've been there. I was in a cab and somebody was like

1506
01:47:44,340 --> 01:47:48,340
you know where we are. Oh god. East Flamingo Road and Koval

1507
01:47:48,340 --> 01:47:52,340
Lane. Koval. Wow.

1508
01:47:52,340 --> 01:47:56,340
Crazy. He might have waited the 90 minutes for the boat ride.

1509
01:47:56,340 --> 01:48:00,340
Maybe he got them. Maybe they're like oh we'll take you.

1510
01:48:00,340 --> 01:48:04,340
They should have let him cut the line. He could have met Cricket.

1511
01:48:04,340 --> 01:48:08,340
Or he got. Tupac and Cricket could have met on this

1512
01:48:08,340 --> 01:48:12,340
if he'd been on the boat ride. If he'd done it. If he'd been patient

1513
01:48:12,340 --> 01:48:16,340
and then waited. What if he like then people were like looking for him but he's

1514
01:48:16,340 --> 01:48:20,340
having a blast on the boat. Yeah it's possible. He's in a secret

1515
01:48:20,340 --> 01:48:24,340
tunnels of the Luxor. Anything's possible. Do you think a crew guy

1516
01:48:24,340 --> 01:48:28,340
on the Will Smith video is like you know Tupac was staying here when he was killed. It's like

1517
01:48:28,340 --> 01:48:32,340
Jesus don't tell me that. Like

1518
01:48:32,340 --> 01:48:36,340
a fucking haunted Egypt hotel. That was what

1519
01:48:36,340 --> 01:48:40,340
cursed Will ultimately. That's what led to what happened 30 years later.

1520
01:48:40,340 --> 01:48:44,340
Took a while. It took a while to manifest.

1521
01:48:44,340 --> 01:48:48,340
Okay so now. Well basically the special says like

1522
01:48:48,340 --> 01:48:52,340
the audience shares Karina's discovery of the true meaning of the obelisk.

1523
01:48:52,340 --> 01:48:56,340
Okay again. It's hard to imagine.

1524
01:48:56,340 --> 01:49:00,340
Okay so now Nell armed with my knowledge of the true

1525
01:49:00,340 --> 01:49:04,340
meaning of the obelisk. Now I can proceed to the theater of time.

1526
01:49:04,340 --> 01:49:08,340
And the theater of time is set. So this

1527
01:49:08,340 --> 01:49:12,340
I don't know if you stole it on this too. You encounter a big sign and the sign

1528
01:49:12,340 --> 01:49:16,340
says enlightened society for global transformation.

1529
01:49:16,340 --> 01:49:20,340
Which also sounds like a Scientology. I was going to say the full logo looks like Scientology.

1530
01:49:20,340 --> 01:49:24,340
It really does. The phrase looks like Scientology.

1531
01:49:24,340 --> 01:49:28,340
This might have. I'm deciding it. This open Will Smith's

1532
01:49:28,340 --> 01:49:32,340
This started him on the path. This picture that I'm showing

1533
01:49:32,340 --> 01:49:36,340
of the sign. This is what would greet you as you entered the theater of time. And now

1534
01:49:36,340 --> 01:49:40,340
it is at the neon museum. This is sitting around somewhere.

1535
01:49:40,340 --> 01:49:44,340
If you go there in Vegas, which I'm not but I would like to. I'd like to see that sign because it's actually

1536
01:49:44,340 --> 01:49:48,340
a lot like Alien Encounter or something. It's very like very 90's theme park.

1537
01:49:48,340 --> 01:49:52,340
And then. And this was a. This was like a

1538
01:49:52,340 --> 01:49:56,340
screen tipped. Like movie screens are thin and

1539
01:49:56,340 --> 01:50:00,340
long ways. Imagine if you turn that. If you went 90 with it. If you go

1540
01:50:00,340 --> 01:50:04,340
90. If you do Quibi freestyle. You turned it on its head. They did

1541
01:50:04,340 --> 01:50:08,340
it. So it was a big. It was a tall long screen.

1542
01:50:08,340 --> 01:50:12,340
Is what this was. A tall TikTok.

1543
01:50:12,340 --> 01:50:16,340
I think of it as the original TikTok.

1544
01:50:16,340 --> 01:50:20,340
And eventually this just became a real IMAX theater. They just like

1545
01:50:20,340 --> 01:50:24,340
put more screen on there. Why do we have just one. We can only play one kind of

1546
01:50:24,340 --> 01:50:28,340
movie. Much like what befell Quibi ultimately. Yeah.

1547
01:50:28,340 --> 01:50:32,340
Maybe having some more flexibility in what you could show here is good. There's not a lot

1548
01:50:32,340 --> 01:50:36,340
about theater of time. Did you guys. I don't really understand what's

1549
01:50:36,340 --> 01:50:40,340
happening in this one. It seems. Is this a mainly a sit down movie?

1550
01:50:40,340 --> 01:50:44,340
But with a little bit of movement. It's not a full simulator.

1551
01:50:44,340 --> 01:50:48,340
Yeah. It seems like it's just sort of an IMAX.

1552
01:50:48,340 --> 01:50:52,340
Like a little bit of an elevated IMAX. I guess.

1553
01:50:52,340 --> 01:50:56,340
I've seen some of this stuff. Seen a little proof of concept.

1554
01:50:56,340 --> 01:51:00,340
I think it was. Cause he's like this is my chant.

1555
01:51:00,340 --> 01:51:04,340
I have like. Doug Trumbull found this rare pile of money.

1556
01:51:04,340 --> 01:51:08,340
To prove his high impact entertainment center concept.

1557
01:51:08,340 --> 01:51:12,340
And I wish it had been proven better.

1558
01:51:12,340 --> 01:51:16,340
I know. It's like I admire his big reach

1559
01:51:16,340 --> 01:51:20,340
for the nonsense. Like just doing this much dumb nonsense.

1560
01:51:20,340 --> 01:51:24,340
But it's yeah. It's like if it just it was a little bit more accessible.

1561
01:51:24,340 --> 01:51:28,340
At the very least it could have lasted longer than this stuff did.

1562
01:51:28,340 --> 01:51:32,340
Well it's obviously mobsters versus mummies. That is the

1563
01:51:32,340 --> 01:51:36,340
very clear story. Much like Pirates of the Caribbean. You know what it is

1564
01:51:36,340 --> 01:51:40,340
when you're going into it. He should have had the idea that we just had 30 years later.

1565
01:51:40,340 --> 01:51:44,340
I agree. The only other pitch I had on it is that he licensed William Shatner's

1566
01:51:44,340 --> 01:51:48,340
Tech War. Of course the William Shatner verse.

1567
01:51:48,340 --> 01:51:52,340
It is surprising Tech War is not part of Luxor.

1568
01:51:52,340 --> 01:51:56,340
Like today. Oh not today. Oh good.

1569
01:51:56,340 --> 01:52:00,340
Visit the Tech War experience. It will open in 2006.

1570
01:52:00,340 --> 01:52:04,340
The William Shatner supposedly created future story of the illegal

1571
01:52:04,340 --> 01:52:08,340
drug known as Tech. Is it just in our world or

1572
01:52:08,340 --> 01:52:12,340
like it's not. Tech War is not in another universe. I believe it's in the future

1573
01:52:12,340 --> 01:52:16,340
but I actually don't know if it's in another universe or not. Okay. Yeah. Tech War is definitely

1574
01:52:16,340 --> 01:52:20,340
in the canon. Tech War is in the PTR canon for sure.

1575
01:52:20,340 --> 01:52:24,340
Because there's a variety of things we need to watch and read.

1576
01:52:24,340 --> 01:52:28,340
I want it filmed at the Eden Center in Toronto. Well I'm on board.

1577
01:52:28,340 --> 01:52:32,340
The future as seen through a big tall mall. Sounds good to me.

1578
01:52:32,340 --> 01:52:36,340
Hey that you know I got a couple things. One Douglas Trumbull

1579
01:52:36,340 --> 01:52:40,340
credited it with working on the first flight simulator ride.

1580
01:52:40,340 --> 01:52:44,340
Which I think you can see footage of online. It's called Tour of the

1581
01:52:44,340 --> 01:52:48,340
Universe and it was in the basement of the CN Tower.

1582
01:52:48,340 --> 01:52:52,340
Of the Tower. In Toronto. Pre-Star Tours. Pre-Star Tours.

1583
01:52:52,340 --> 01:52:56,340
The other thing you know we were speculating about like how did Luxor

1584
01:52:56,340 --> 01:53:00,340
get made. How did this all happen. And there's

1585
01:53:00,340 --> 01:53:04,340
a clip in that special.

1586
01:53:04,340 --> 01:53:08,340
This is Clyde Turner. He's the president of Circus Circus

1587
01:53:08,340 --> 01:53:12,340
Enterprises. And this is I mean when you see this clip

1588
01:53:12,340 --> 01:53:16,340
when you hear him talk about it it's just the most dynamic thing you've ever

1589
01:53:16,340 --> 01:53:20,340
encountered. But the vision is somewhat big.

1590
01:53:20,340 --> 01:53:24,340
And what happens is that you then seek out the best and the brightest

1591
01:53:24,340 --> 01:53:28,340
of all you can find. And you have intense brainstorm sessions.

1592
01:53:28,340 --> 01:53:32,340
And out of that comes ideas. He's just describing

1593
01:53:32,340 --> 01:53:36,340
the creative process. If that's making you like

1594
01:53:36,340 --> 01:53:40,340
you're probably electrified hearing that 20 second clip of

1595
01:53:40,340 --> 01:53:44,340
this man who appears to be falling asleep on camera.

1596
01:53:44,340 --> 01:53:48,340
And then it cuts to the table.

1597
01:53:48,340 --> 01:53:52,340
It cuts back and forth between the table of like this is the casino manager. This is Douglas

1598
01:53:52,340 --> 01:53:56,340
Trumbull. This is an engineer. And it's the.

1599
01:53:56,340 --> 01:54:00,340
You've never seen so many receding hairlines in one place. No offense.

1600
01:54:00,340 --> 01:54:04,340
No shade fellas. I'm right there with ya. But it's like

1601
01:54:04,340 --> 01:54:08,340
yeah there ain't a woman or a person of

1602
01:54:08,340 --> 01:54:12,340
color around for miles and miles.

1603
01:54:12,340 --> 01:54:16,340
Sure. Yeah well look this

1604
01:54:16,340 --> 01:54:20,340
thing I don't think it went away right away. I don't remember when they start. I think you know

1605
01:54:20,340 --> 01:54:24,340
it just the theater of time became a regular of

1606
01:54:24,340 --> 01:54:28,340
IMAX theater. I'd like to know more about theater of time but it's not. You can watch a big clip

1607
01:54:28,340 --> 01:54:32,340
of it on one of those Mind's Eye videos that keeps coming up. You can watch a big

1608
01:54:32,340 --> 01:54:36,340
extended like a minute and a half sequence of it. And it's very impressive. It's very

1609
01:54:36,340 --> 01:54:40,340
you know what it's like. It's like being in Hill Valley 2015 in

1610
01:54:40,340 --> 01:54:44,340
the Back to the Future ride but you're not rushing through it. And there are cars and stuff

1611
01:54:44,340 --> 01:54:48,340
coming at ya. None of that exciting shit. What if you could just hover above

1612
01:54:48,340 --> 01:54:52,340
a gentle Hill Valley future. I like that. Sure. It's pretty

1613
01:54:52,340 --> 01:54:56,340
cool. But then I take it back there is one woman and one person

1614
01:54:56,340 --> 01:55:00,340
of color at the table of bald men. Not a single. No one's gonna be found.

1615
01:55:00,340 --> 01:55:04,340
I just wanted to clarify. You're sexist racists. Wouldn't allow them in the room.

1616
01:55:04,340 --> 01:55:08,340
I just wanted to clarify. They were stuck at the door. Get out of here.

1617
01:55:08,340 --> 01:55:12,340
These very bald men did let a couple people.

1618
01:55:12,340 --> 01:55:16,340
You were right about the baldness. Yeah I was right about the baldness.

1619
01:55:16,340 --> 01:55:20,340
So these things start disappearing.

1620
01:55:20,340 --> 01:55:24,340
The attractions they can't really get rid of these facilities. They're

1621
01:55:24,340 --> 01:55:28,340
baked into the building like certain theme park like Yeti.

1622
01:55:28,340 --> 01:55:32,340
So they started using it for other stuff. When I was first in

1623
01:55:32,340 --> 01:55:36,340
Vegas as a not child in 2006 I remember

1624
01:55:36,340 --> 01:55:40,340
that one of the presumably formerly the Obelisk ride was home to something

1625
01:55:40,340 --> 01:55:44,340
called Reboot the Ride. A ride based on the

1626
01:55:44,340 --> 01:55:48,340
early CGI television show. Reboot the Ride is maybe

1627
01:55:48,340 --> 01:55:52,340
worthy of its own episode. I don't know. I assume. I'm not gonna try

1628
01:55:52,340 --> 01:55:56,340
to rush some version here. But it was at

1629
01:55:56,340 --> 01:56:00,340
a number of theme parks I think. And somehow provoked

1630
01:56:00,340 --> 01:56:04,340
a second one. I'm sorry. Okay so it was at Adventure Dome

1631
01:56:04,340 --> 01:56:08,340
first. Formerly Grand Slam Canyon. My favorite name.

1632
01:56:08,340 --> 01:56:12,340
And then moved to the Luxor. And then somehow. I don't know

1633
01:56:12,340 --> 01:56:16,340
where this was. If it was the Luxor. Oh I think it was in Canada maybe somewhere. There was somehow

1634
01:56:16,340 --> 01:56:20,340
there was not only Reboot the Ride but later Reboot the

1635
01:56:20,340 --> 01:56:24,340
Ride V2 Journey into Chaos. So we got

1636
01:56:24,340 --> 01:56:28,340
two Reboot rides to grapple with with a full methal.

1637
01:56:28,340 --> 01:56:32,340
And unlike the Obelisk verse which nobody is tracking and taking care of

1638
01:56:32,340 --> 01:56:36,340
Reboot fandom is massive so we can find every detail.

1639
01:56:36,340 --> 01:56:40,340
So we'll get into that. Is Reboot doing Mint Mobile commercials

1640
01:56:40,340 --> 01:56:44,340
yet? I don't think so. I don't know. It's been calculated if he's epic

1641
01:56:44,340 --> 01:56:48,340
enough. Maybe Mac tonight. Or not Mac tonight.

1642
01:56:48,340 --> 01:56:52,340
The Mac and Me. Maybe if Alf meets Mac and

1643
01:56:52,340 --> 01:56:56,340
Me. How much does Mac cost these days? Ryan Menels

1644
01:56:56,340 --> 01:57:00,340
did do it. He's gonna do Biker Mice for Mars. That's true. That's not a joke.

1645
01:57:00,340 --> 01:57:04,340
Everything this guy does is so epic.

1646
01:57:04,340 --> 01:57:08,340
It's kind of like a Spiderverse version of. I shouldn't talk my name.

1647
01:57:08,340 --> 01:57:12,340
This could be a job for any of us. Oh yeah. I grew

1648
01:57:12,340 --> 01:57:16,340
up with Biker Mice. I loved the mice. I remember

1649
01:57:16,340 --> 01:57:20,340
all of their names and I'm checking my hand for an unrelated reason.

1650
01:57:20,340 --> 01:57:24,340
When the name them all. When the Biker Mice play an exhibition

1651
01:57:24,340 --> 01:57:28,340
game against Wrexham Football Club. Oh boy.

1652
01:57:28,340 --> 01:57:32,340
It's gonna be something. Welcome to Wrexham Biker Mice for Mars.

1653
01:57:32,340 --> 01:57:36,340
The weirdest thing though about all this.

1654
01:57:36,340 --> 01:57:40,340
The Luxorverse did not just stay in the rides.

1655
01:57:40,340 --> 01:57:44,340
There was also a CD-ROM. Which makes all the sense

1656
01:57:44,340 --> 01:57:48,340
in the world because this aesthetic of all of this is very CD-ROM. There was something

1657
01:57:48,340 --> 01:57:52,340
called Secrets of the Luxor. I took a shot of the box. It has

1658
01:57:52,340 --> 01:57:56,340
the pitch of what this thing would be. And it has all. By the way this is

1659
01:57:56,340 --> 01:58:00,340
Dr. Osiris. It's the characters. It's all of it.

1660
01:58:00,340 --> 01:58:04,340
This morning you were just another archaeologist exploring an ancient pyramid.

1661
01:58:04,340 --> 01:58:08,340
Just another archaeologist. Yeah.

1662
01:58:08,340 --> 01:58:12,340
Now you're 300 years in the future trying to convince a madman

1663
01:58:12,340 --> 01:58:16,340
not to blow up the sun. Some days you wish you

1664
01:58:16,340 --> 01:58:20,340
just stayed in bed. And I downloaded an emulator

1665
01:58:20,340 --> 01:58:24,340
of it. But I don't know why I have no emulator program. But anyway we can play Secrets of the Luxor.

1666
01:58:24,340 --> 01:58:28,340
Explore Dr. Osiris more fully. See if he's worth

1667
01:58:28,340 --> 01:58:32,340
trying to explore in an IP sense. I bet he. First of all we know he is.

1668
01:58:32,340 --> 01:58:36,340
But of course we need to watch. Or play. Excuse me. Not just watch.

1669
01:58:36,340 --> 01:58:40,340
This is. I wish

1670
01:58:40,340 --> 01:58:44,340
this had worked in some sort of way. I mean is there really like

1671
01:58:44,340 --> 01:58:48,340
I know we're simplifying it but is there a way if

1672
01:58:48,340 --> 01:58:52,340
everything was just better would it have stuck around in a way where it was like you can't

1673
01:58:52,340 --> 01:58:56,340
get rid of this. Or is just the nature of Vegas that everything is so disposable. That it's almost

1674
01:58:56,340 --> 01:59:00,340
impossible. Maybe then. Maybe if it was like due to the experiment

1675
01:59:00,340 --> 01:59:04,340
that like ultimately it's not a family destination. This is not a place to do

1676
01:59:04,340 --> 01:59:08,340
story rides. Yeah. Like that inherent footwear. I think this

1677
01:59:08,340 --> 01:59:12,340
could have worked. Maybe this you know this transforms Niagara Falls

1678
01:59:12,340 --> 01:59:16,340
and Myrtle Beach and all those cities where all the weird crap is.

1679
01:59:16,340 --> 01:59:20,340
It was just the wrong. It was the wrong market. But Drumble had to grab it while

1680
01:59:20,340 --> 01:59:24,340
he could. Much like an obelisk. See what power he could wield.

1681
01:59:24,340 --> 01:59:28,340
It is an admirable yeah. An admirable idea at the time.

1682
01:59:28,340 --> 01:59:32,340
If we're. The name Jim Grand Adventures

1683
01:59:32,340 --> 01:59:36,340
episode I brought up Blackjack rules. Hit stand. Double down. Cash out.

1684
01:59:36,340 --> 01:59:40,340
I think clearly the answer was double down. 100%.

1685
01:59:40,340 --> 01:59:44,340
Let's literally double. They didn't provide enough material to make us

1686
01:59:44,340 --> 01:59:48,340
care about Mac and Karina. They needed to do six attractions not three.

1687
01:59:48,340 --> 01:59:52,340
They should have added every year. They should have kept hitting and hitting

1688
01:59:52,340 --> 01:59:56,340
and hitting. And they should have gotten rid of the hotel rooms. Turn those into mazes.

1689
01:59:56,340 --> 02:00:00,340
You knock some of those out. Now there's nowhere for Tupac to stay. Maybe he changes his mind.

1690
02:00:00,340 --> 02:00:04,340
Doesn't come to Vegas. And we're still getting Tupac albums to this day. I mean we are

1691
02:00:04,340 --> 02:00:08,340
because he puts. He's the most prolific posthumous artist of all time. But I mean

1692
02:00:08,340 --> 02:00:12,340
actually new made by an alive Tupac. I think you've just yeah that's a future

1693
02:00:12,340 --> 02:00:16,340
that we can get behind. And if we had just gotten behind Douglas Trumbull's vision

1694
02:00:16,340 --> 02:00:20,340
that in his work like in his world you think

1695
02:00:20,340 --> 02:00:24,340
there were like every hotel had

1696
02:00:24,340 --> 02:00:28,340
interconnected like like you would see Mac in

1697
02:00:28,340 --> 02:00:32,340
different hotels in different contexts like you could believe this story into different

1698
02:00:32,340 --> 02:00:36,340
hotels. Yeah. Like in the grandest vision of everything.

1699
02:00:36,340 --> 02:00:40,340
It's a huge like Disney like see Disney not Disney see the theme park but

1700
02:00:40,340 --> 02:00:44,340
to see the organization which is decease. Now you go into a pre Rome universe

1701
02:00:44,340 --> 02:00:48,340
that was better than Rome and a future that uses Roman technology.

1702
02:00:48,340 --> 02:00:52,340
Right. And now Karina is in search of the column.

1703
02:00:52,340 --> 02:00:56,340
Of course the column. I'd love to see Mac help this would get the mag

1704
02:00:56,340 --> 02:01:00,340
Lev to help Karina find the column. The crossover potential

1705
02:01:00,340 --> 02:01:04,340
like the Avengers of the Vegas casino

1706
02:01:04,340 --> 02:01:08,340
universe. All different characters for each each one and then they all

1707
02:01:08,340 --> 02:01:12,340
get together and like they all meet up. Yeah. That experience

1708
02:01:12,340 --> 02:01:16,340
the slot machines and cheap drinks table games

1709
02:01:16,340 --> 02:01:20,340
shrimp cocktails that'll bring the people in you know. Yeah.

1710
02:01:20,340 --> 02:01:24,340
You got to give them something else to do. What do you do how do you make them stay with great

1711
02:01:24,340 --> 02:01:28,340
storytelling and the problem is there wasn't enough of this. They should have taken over

1712
02:01:28,340 --> 02:01:32,340
Mirage and that's about like a society of volcano people which

1713
02:01:32,340 --> 02:01:36,340
is that not kind of what Avatar 3 is going to be about. That is absolutely what it is.

1714
02:01:36,340 --> 02:01:40,340
I hope they would have gotten on that first that needy idea and then

1715
02:01:40,340 --> 02:01:44,340
like you know if they and if they didn't feel like well how are we going to come up

1716
02:01:44,340 --> 02:01:48,340
with all this volcano related mythology. Well it already exists. It's from the mind

1717
02:01:48,340 --> 02:01:52,340
of this writer Elrond Hubbard. Then you just plug in all the Dianetics

1718
02:01:52,340 --> 02:01:56,340
stuff. So now that's what I want. I want that it's 1998

1719
02:01:56,340 --> 02:02:00,340
and Douglas Trumbull is helping Elrond Hubbard achieve

1720
02:02:00,340 --> 02:02:04,340
his perfect cinematic three rides that tell the story of Dianetics.

1721
02:02:04,340 --> 02:02:08,340
You go into the volcano verse with Mac and

1722
02:02:08,340 --> 02:02:12,340
Karina. And the New York skyline these are these were buildings built before

1723
02:02:12,340 --> 02:02:16,340
the people built New York. They were early societies that

1724
02:02:16,340 --> 02:02:20,340
the ancient New York the ancient old Orchians. The ancient Orchians.

1725
02:02:20,340 --> 02:02:24,340
I don't know why I dropped the Y. Sure. Orchians. And

1726
02:02:24,340 --> 02:02:28,340
eventually that roller coaster what do they get.

1727
02:02:28,340 --> 02:02:32,340
Well they get you know Samsung

1728
02:02:32,340 --> 02:02:36,340
touch phones in VR lenses and it's

1729
02:02:36,340 --> 02:02:40,340
aliens. Oh right. It does become an alien thing. Yeah.

1730
02:02:40,340 --> 02:02:44,340
It was always heading there. The Trumbull is not supporting Trumbull.

1731
02:02:44,340 --> 02:02:48,340
Trumbull should have had three rides a trilogy of rides in every single hotel.

1732
02:02:48,340 --> 02:02:52,340
And that is the reason. And then it wouldn't be a gambling city

1733
02:02:52,340 --> 02:02:56,340
anymore. It would be Trumbulltown. Trumbulltown. Trumbulltown.

1734
02:02:56,340 --> 02:03:00,340
Well this makes me hate Las Vegas. This makes me want to get out of there. I agree.

1735
02:03:00,340 --> 02:03:04,340
I'm not going to talk about it anymore. But it's too late we're stuck.

1736
02:03:04,340 --> 02:03:08,340
And thus you survived podcast the ride Sin City Nights.

1737
02:03:08,340 --> 02:03:12,340
I wish it was Trumbulltown. I wish they would have changed the name for him.

1738
02:03:12,340 --> 02:03:16,340
There was this brief time where they flirted with gambling and they

1739
02:03:16,340 --> 02:03:20,340
hadn't discovered the power of storytelling and the power of the obelisk. Oh yeah.

1740
02:03:20,340 --> 02:03:24,340
Dark times. Yeah. But as it stands

1741
02:03:24,340 --> 02:03:28,340
because they didn't do it the Luxor should absolutely fold into

1742
02:03:28,340 --> 02:03:32,340
itself. Yeah. Oh yeah. Disappear and take all of the

1743
02:03:32,340 --> 02:03:36,340
lost souls with it. Or spit them back up. Bring

1744
02:03:36,340 --> 02:03:40,340
spit Tupac out on your way into crumbling. Yeah. I mean I

1745
02:03:40,340 --> 02:03:44,340
was just looking at it. Specifically the UFOs above in 2012 were orbs.

1746
02:03:44,340 --> 02:03:48,340
So the orbs could also absorb the whole

1747
02:03:48,340 --> 02:03:52,340
Luxor and take it back to its home planet or they could blow it up too.

1748
02:03:52,340 --> 02:03:56,340
Or implode it. Well now I told my wife and

1749
02:03:56,340 --> 02:04:00,340
child they could come back in the door because we've been recording forever. So now I'm going to actually wrap

1750
02:04:00,340 --> 02:04:04,340
up while they come in and probably as she washes my son's hands. So

1751
02:04:04,340 --> 02:04:08,340
