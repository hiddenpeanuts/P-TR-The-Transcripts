00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,840
Feral Audio.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,880
Warning. The following podcast contains stomach-churning stops at Red Rockets' Pizza Port,

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,160
a white-knuckle examination of theme park swingers,

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,920
and an absolutely definitive decision about which is better, Walt Disney World or Disneyland.

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:47,440
With the help of birthday slash doughboy, Mike Mitchell, strap in for the new episode of Podcast The Ride.

6
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:52,880
Hey everybody, welcome to Podcast The Ride, a theme park podcast where some nice older men

7
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:56,560
talk to each other about it. Is that the good? That was a bad one, right?

8
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,320
Did you like that phrase?

9
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,400
It was a little cumbersome. We're working on that catchphrase. Joining me as always, Jason Sheridan.

10
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:05,760
Hi.

11
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,640
And Scott Gardner.

12
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,800
Hi, I'm here again as well.

13
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:13,040
Yeah, and today with us is our first guest episode. We're being joined by,

14
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:18,240
from Netflix's Love and Feral Audio's Doughboys, Mike Mitchell.

15
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,760
Hello everybody, thank you for having me. I'm the first guest, that's great.

16
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,520
You're the Will Ferrell or the Tom Hanks of...

17
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,520
We're starting off within this scale.

18
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,720
In the podcast world.

19
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,000
You are a regular Seth Rogen or Billy Crystal.

20
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,600
You're what's called a get, Mitch.

21
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,880
Oh my God.

22
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:39,920
Yeah, yeah, so thank you so much.

23
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,880
What the hell's happened to the world?

24
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,440
Lots of fracturing.

25
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:51,200
I also, we are recording this here at Feral Audio where you originally recorded the first

26
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:57,440
several years of Doughboys, which makes me feel like we are playing with Michael Jordan in,

27
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,360
wherever Michael Jordan played.

28
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,160
You're going to be back in the booth.

29
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,360
The United Center.

30
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,240
That's what you were looking for.

31
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,240
The United, it's like we're back in the famous United Center with the memorable name.

32
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:12,160
Okay, it's nice to be back here. I forgot what it was like in here. It's great. There's free drinks.

33
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,320
Yeah, that's it.

34
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,200
Number one.

35
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,880
I found where the snacks are.

36
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,920
Jason found half a muffin upstairs.

37
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,280
Somebody was like, yeah, somebody was like, we got muffins upstairs. And he like wandered

38
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,960
upstairs, which we're not allowed to do.

39
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,840
I didn't know there was a second floor. They told me go ahead.

40
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,200
I've never been upstairs. Wow, you're very comfortable here already.

41
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,960
When you're in pursuit of free snacks.

42
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,400
For sure.

43
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,880
You'll get comfortable. He's got the radar for it. So thank you. Yeah. Thank you for joining us.

44
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,440
Thank you, bro.

45
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,600
Very excited to be here. I love, hey, I love parks. Every park there is.

46
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,720
Any kind of park.

47
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,920
Any national park.

48
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,080
Central park.

49
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,960
Central park. Park and go, Carlson.

50
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,680
Like at the airport.

51
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,000
That's every type. That's every type of park.

52
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,280
It's cheaper than that airport parking that's right next to the airport.

53
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:01,520
Sure.

54
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,880
That is very, that's true. Yeah. Fuck, fuck that parking.

55
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:10,480
And I love parks with, hey, even with Confederate statues.

56
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,640
Oh my. Oh no.

57
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:15,920
Keep them up.

58
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:21,120
Important part of our history from like 30 years ago.

59
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,600
I like when they pull the one statue down and like it crumbled. Do you see how it like crumbled?

60
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:30,880
Yeah. There's news stories about that. A lot of them were put up in the 20s and 30s and were

61
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:35,120
very cheaply made. Like made in mass quantities to put up.

62
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,320
Yeah, good. Take them all down.

63
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,280
We've sort of not, we've alluded to it here and there and I'm sure we'll do the full episode

64
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:47,840
about it at some point, but we are coming up on like a new monument being erected at Disney World,

65
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,240
the Donald Trump robot in the hall of presence.

66
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:50,720
Wow.

67
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:55,920
It's impossible to avoid thinking about talking about, I mean, it's not what's foremost in most

68
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:01,200
people's minds these days, I guess, but I truly am wondering, is that show ready to go? Can they

69
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,440
turn it on at any minute or are they avoiding it because everything is getting so crazy?

70
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,480
They gotta be avoiding it. I think they're trying to, they're trying to punt.

71
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:08,720
Yeah.

72
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,080
They keep punting.

73
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,880
That could also be another, I know we've talked about mysterious fires for insurance money in the

74
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,040
past. That could be another victim.

75
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,760
Oh no, the ride, guys, the ride burned down.

76
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,920
This is going to take another year to fix.

77
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,960
Faulty Martin Van Buren started sparking up.

78
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,280
Now it's just about the first couple presidents.

79
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,840
I like that they don't want to put it, it seems like they don't want to put it up, right?

80
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,360
Yeah, they don't. I mean, cause it'll be fights. There'll be people fight,

81
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,520
cause some people will boo, some people will cheer, and then those people will fight.

82
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,840
I think that's, I would have be a legitimate concern.

83
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,920
Just put them up and not have them talk or something.

84
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:50,320
That's what they're saying. They might change the scripts only like Lincoln or Kennedy talks.

85
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,640
Which is how it was until Clinton, Clinton started doing the speeches and then

86
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:59,280
Clinton, Bush, Obama have all given speeches. Trump's, the rumor is Trump's White House,

87
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,680
if you can imagine, has been very difficult about scheduling a time for him to come do

88
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,960
the robot speech. But then they came out and said that wasn't true and vice had to retract something.

89
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,040
And like every, every thing, even within this innocent theme park world,

90
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:16,240
everything this administration touches is just like toxic.

91
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,880
So much drama. But like not every president speaks, right?

92
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,600
Like, uh, okay, then he doesn't have to talk.

93
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:28,400
He should just like peer over something and like give a little wave and then go back down.

94
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,560
Or be suddenly in the chair next to you.

95
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,880
It'd be like alien encounter with Donald Trump. Or he's like all around you.

96
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,880
Heavy breathing and farting and just stalking around.

97
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,480
Smells vaguely like McDonald's.

98
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,880
I would like that. If Trump's robot had McDonald's, I think that's funny.

99
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,040
And worth putting them up for.

100
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:54,000
Offers it to you, opens with bag opening technology. This robot is the most advanced.

101
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:59,840
It's not unprecedented. There used to be those McDonald's French fry carts in the parks.

102
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,320
They just sold McDonald's French fries.

103
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,440
That's where it used to be.

104
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,960
Yeah. In Disney World.

105
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,800
But only McDonald's, just the French fries.

106
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,640
Just the fries. It was just like a little snack cart that sold fries and soda.

107
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,040
Yeah.

108
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:16,720
That's so cool because they, like they, they, they, they, like those are the best fry.

109
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,240
That's the coolest thing that they do.

110
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,000
Yeah. They don't do that anymore.

111
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,040
No, they don't. It's over.

112
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,560
It was like a license thing.

113
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,200
Oh, it was a lot.

114
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,800
It was like a sponsorship thing.

115
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,800
Well, and they were testing the waters of do people want McDonald's in the theme parks?

116
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:35,600
And people did not. All of the dorky fans such as ourselves at probably ages 14 to 16 at the time

117
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,160
were all like this ruins the original vision.

118
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,320
But people love the Starbucks in the parks. Like the Starbucks in the parks are always packed.

119
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:44,800
Yeah.

120
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,800
Yeah. There's Starbucks in, in Disneyland or Disney World?

121
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,560
Every, every park, every Disney park.

122
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,040
Really?

123
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:51,280
Yeah.

124
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:51,760
Mm-hmm.

125
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,960
They, I don't like that.

126
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:58,080
They've themed it better though. They, like there was a place called the Market House on Main Street

127
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:02,480
and now there's a Starbucks in the Market House. So it's like a little, it's a little more hidden.

128
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,000
The logos are inside, but like.

129
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,480
It hasn't been egregious, I will say.

130
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:06,640
Yeah.

131
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:10,800
Yes. You can go to a regular and it just has like the basic sandwiches that you would have

132
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,280
at any Starbucks and you can use your app there. It's sort of weird. It does pull you out of

133
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,320
Disneyland a little bit.

134
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:20,240
Yeah. I don't, I don't like it for that reason, but I have a question for you and I'm not,

135
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,720
this is not like some doughboys cross potting or something.

136
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:30,400
For real, and if I'm stepping on anything, yell at me.

137
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:30,960
Sure.

138
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,160
But I just wanted to say that I like Pizza Port.

139
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,280
Oh.

140
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,320
We have, there's been no discussion of Pizza Port yet on the show.

141
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:38,480
No?

142
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:42,240
In Tomorrowland, you're talking about the Tomorrowland in Disneyland restaurant.

143
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:48,080
I actually like that. I like how the pizza is like theme park pizza and it's good to me.

144
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,000
I like Pizza Port.

145
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,880
I have a question. When was the last time you went there?

146
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:59,840
The last time I went there was about three, four weeks ago.

147
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,640
Oh, pretty recently.

148
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,680
You went to Pizza Port?

149
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,400
I went to Pizza Port.

150
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:07,440
Oh really? See, I thought that the, I used to like it and I feel like it took a dive into like

151
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,600
mass produced Chuck E. Cheese type pizza where I was disappointed.

152
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:16,880
To be fair, I have gone to Chuck E. Cheese recently and Pizza Port is a billion times better.

153
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:21,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's not besmirch the fine folks who make pizzas at Pizza Port.

154
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:23,760
Huh, that's interesting.

155
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:27,600
That's controversial though, because I feel like Pizza Port is everyone's least favorite Disneyland

156
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:27,920
place.

157
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:33,920
I know. No, I feel like it's gotten that rap, but you know what, I haven't eaten that. I was

158
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:39,360
wondering what your guys favorite food is, because every time I go there, for me, the biggest thing

159
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,160
for me is just getting a Dole Whip and I'll always get a Dole Whip. And then besides that, I don't

160
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:48,320
care. I'll get like a Churro, but I don't have like any specific places I have to eat. I've never

161
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,880
eaten in like, what's the, is it like the Blue Bayou or something?

162
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,200
Yeah.

163
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:51,440
Yeah.

164
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:52,960
I've never eaten there.

165
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,960
We did it with Mike and I went on a double date.

166
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,080
Was it at Blue Bayou?

167
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,360
With our girlfriend wives and I was with each other.

168
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,760
Oh yeah, it wasn't you two with us.

169
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:07,600
Yeah. Though we recently, we several times in the last few weeks have been to Disneyland, just you

170
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,080
and I.

171
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,440
For a few hours.

172
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:15,280
For, yeah. Look, if it was all day, then it'd be weird, but just several hours since. It's perfectly

173
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:20,880
fine for two men to go to Disneyland on a Wednesday and eat Beauty and the Beast gray stuff

174
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,760
together. It's a beautiful thing.

175
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,200
On a Wednesday morning.

176
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,400
Do you know about the gray stuff, Mitch?

177
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,800
No, what is, what is Beauty and the Beast gray stuff?

178
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,080
You know, like from the song, have the gray stuff, it's delicious.

179
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:32,480
Oh yeah.

180
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,880
Don't believe me, ask the dishes. There's a Beauty and the Beast restaurant now and they have

181
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,800
a dessert called gray stuff.

182
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,680
Is it good?

183
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,400
It is good.

184
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:40,720
Yeah.

185
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,360
It's delicious.

186
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,000
Jason had it.

187
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,360
It's good. Yeah, it's very good.

188
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,120
Have I split the gray stuff with you as well?

189
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,320
Yes, we've split the gray stuff, Mike and I.

190
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,120
Jason and I have also been.

191
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:54,720
Tried a little sampling. We split the gray stuff and the rose lemon custard.

192
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,200
Mitch now wants to leave this dark den as quickly as possible.

193
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,600
This is like when like a girl finds out that like, like a group of girlfriends are talking

194
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,000
and they find out that they like all gone on a date with a guy. It's Carlson eating the

195
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,360
gray stuff with everybody.

196
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:16,640
Mike and I went down, the two of us one, why did we go down that one? Was it after Guardians

197
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:16,960
opened?

198
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,240
Does there have to be a why?

199
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,640
Yeah, we were down there to go on the first Guardians.

200
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,200
The first, okay.

201
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,560
One of the first weeks of the Guardians was, and then we split a bunch of food together.

202
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:30,240
We just lay in your same game down. How many side Disney pieces do you have?

203
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,800
Look, this same, I give a lot of the men the same run around.

204
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,880
There's guys all over town who have been on my four hour Disney date.

205
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,120
And yet when it's time to go to Disney World, who do you take? Your girlfriend.

206
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:43,440
Yeah.

207
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,520
Very unbelievable.

208
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:49,600
You got to do, when it's long, she doesn't even know about any of the men. So she, it's,

209
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,240
I have to, she's got to go on one of the long-term trips because she, I got to throw her off the scent.

210
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,880
Your web of deception knows no bounds.

211
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:02,000
What else Disney food wise? There is a lot of good stuff.

212
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:07,520
Do we just want to get into it or do we, did we want to talk about that exciting discovery?

213
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,000
Oh yeah.

214
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,120
Right before we came in here?

215
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,640
You need to talk about that at some point because I want to know what this big discovery is.

216
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:18,960
Yeah, sure. We don't always have like hot news off the presses, but we just discovered before

217
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:23,920
we came over here, there's, there's a, all right. So shout outs to a fellow and, and,

218
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:28,560
going back much deeper than us, Disney podcaster Len Testa.

219
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:34,720
This is a podcast that we listen to that is a very like, if you're a super, yeah, you know, Mitch.

220
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,800
Oh, Len, oh, Testa.

221
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,920
Just cracking a brew and listening to it.

222
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,680
Hot off the presses.

223
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:46,000
Our future dear friend or our future mortal enemy, Len Testa.

224
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,080
Stay out of my territory.

225
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:53,760
He does a podcast called the unofficial guide to Disney dish podcast where they like break down

226
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,040
like the history of rides. He does it with this guy named Jim Hill and they,

227
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:02,480
they get like way into it. So you learn about like the whole like splash mountain, the history of

228
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,880
how it was developed, who made it to what.

229
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,960
Honestly, it sounds like a better guest than me. I feel like you guys need to,

230
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,520
you gotta get someone in here who knows what they're talking about. I don't know anything.

231
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,160
Well, I think Len was in Florida.

232
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,600
But could Len be as, as funny as us? Can he give you the laughs?

233
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,720
He's probably funnier.

234
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:19,920
Most likely.

235
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:27,680
So, so if you listen to that podcast, like you are, it's like, it's a calling card for your like

236
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,080
theme, weird theme park nerd, dumb or whatever.

237
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:39,840
And we, Scott just discovered on Twitter that one of Len's followers is Anthony Scaramucci.

238
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:48,000
In the list of followers you may know it's like the two of us and Scaramucci.

239
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,640
Scaramucci.

240
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,160
Strangest little fact to see.

241
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:55,760
He follows a lot of people on Twitter, but we also saw a couple days ago that he was tweeting

242
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,120
from Diagon Alley at Universal Studios in Florida.

243
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,480
He was avoiding the theme parks.

244
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,800
So there's a chance, we're not sure is what we're saying.

245
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,240
Scaramucci might be one of us.

246
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:12,480
Now, I don't know if he is going, was he there alone or was he there with his kids?

247
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,800
Is he allowed to see his kids right now?

248
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,440
Oh, that's right.

249
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,240
Well, what's up with the kids at this point?

250
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,840
He's got that crazy divorce.

251
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,640
He's got a divorce.

252
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:18,960
Oh yeah.

253
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,000
But the kid is new.

254
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,640
He has a baby.

255
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,480
He probably didn't take the new baby.

256
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,200
Unless this is the first time he's seen the new baby.

257
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,200
For the listeners who might not know who Scaramucci is, he was for what?

258
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:29,840
Three days?

259
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,200
It was 10 days exactly.

260
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:31,920
Oh, he was 10.

261
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,240
Okay.

262
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,520
He was the head of communications in Donald Trump's White House.

263
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,240
Yeah.

264
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,360
And he famously gave like just a really insane interview

265
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,760
where he's talking about Steve Bannon wanting to suck his own dick.

266
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,360
I love the fact of him being like,

267
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,920
I want to ride the fucking splash mountain.

268
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,160
You got to go in the fucking splash mountain, baby.

269
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,680
It's fucking, it rules.

270
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,520
Yeah, that's very funny to me.

271
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:59,600
Does he live in, is he a Florida man or is he just visiting?

272
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:00,560
We don't know.

273
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,400
We just found this.

274
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:02,720
We got a fucking vacation home.

275
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,480
What the fuck, who fucking cares?

276
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,080
You don't need to know where I fucking live.

277
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,240
I'm a Disney vacation member.

278
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:08,960
Fuck you.

279
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:12,160
It's like a timeshare, but you go to Disney World every year.

280
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:12,880
It's terrific.

281
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:19,280
I feel like poor SNL missing out on a sport like Scaramucci.

282
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,240
Oh, Scaramucci.

283
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,800
10 day and then SNL even got to get, they, on the weekend update summer.

284
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,760
They still slid one in.

285
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:30,240
They slid a Scaramucci in, but I was like, hey, this big over the top Italian guy,

286
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,480
like, this is going to be great for them.

287
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,200
And then he's gone.

288
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,240
It's like the one voice any sketch comedian can do.

289
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,120
100%.

290
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,320
And he literally just does sound like a sketch character.

291
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,840
You don't have to change a thing.

292
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:45,280
Anybody in the cast could have done it, but it was dead center of the summer

293
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,960
and it can't be done now.

294
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,440
And it was done by a former cast member.

295
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,520
They still brought back, no one here can do an Italian voice.

296
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:56,560
Nobody here can say friggin with a lot of gusto.

297
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,680
It's got to be, we need a special ops.

298
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,560
Dan Aykroyd.

299
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,240
Well now, I mean, they're going to have to bring back Bill Hader

300
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,160
as Scaramucci to address this following Len Testa situation.

301
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,480
They're going to have to write a weekend update.

302
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,840
I really hope so.

303
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,360
Who in the cast would play Len?

304
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,000
Oh, it's got to be Moffat.

305
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,760
You know Moffat's got a killer Len up his sleeve.

306
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:29,360
So what we probably should do is start a campaign to get Scaramucci on the podcast.

307
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,480
Mm.

308
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,040
Right?

309
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:31,280
Yeah.

310
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,640
I think that would be great.

311
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,640
So right now we should declare Mr. Scaramucci here.

312
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,680
I'm going to make a plea to him.

313
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:42,240
You can win off of me, Scaramucci.

314
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,000
Please come on podcast the ride, whether you're a big theme park fan or not.

315
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,520
We would just like to hear your review of Diagon Alley, even if you are not a big fan.

316
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:54,560
If we could say, if the guests were like three comedians we know in a row

317
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,600
and then Diagon Alley with Anthony Scaramucci.

318
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:57,840
Great.

319
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,560
And we never discussed anything that's going on.

320
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:04,320
If we were utter cowards and didn't ask him about anything that's happening in the world.

321
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,360
We'll make a pledge.

322
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,080
We'll pledge to him.

323
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,920
We will not talk about any of the other stuff.

324
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,040
I can make that pledge.

325
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:09,440
Yeah.

326
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,160
It'd be much more awkward to get into it.

327
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:18,400
Although you'd be tempted to say, well, if Voldemort shares some common traits with

328
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,320
a certain president who is.

329
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,640
Hey, I can't talk about that, guys.

330
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,080
I can't talk about that.

331
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:24,640
Okay, sure.

332
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,200
Sorry, sir.

333
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,440
Don't yell at me again, please.

334
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,040
We just become sniveling dorks in the front of me.

335
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:35,680
We all just gnarled up and we all lose a foot of height and.

336
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,480
You're so cool.

337
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,640
You're so cool, Mooch.

338
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,000
Teach us the way.

339
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,600
Teach me how to say fuck with confidence, Mooch.

340
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:52,960
I feel like you bringing up like a, I hate when people are like Trump is like Voldemort.

341
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,840
I'm like, don't compare into like a fictional.

342
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,200
Yeah, it's bad.

343
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:57,680
It's bad.

344
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,480
It's real bad.

345
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,240
There's never, and it's never deep cuts.

346
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,320
It's always Voldemort and Gollum.

347
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:02,640
Yeah.

348
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:08,240
There's only a few characters, but he is just, all anybody's getting at is he's a villain.

349
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,360
He is like any villain.

350
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:09,920
Yeah, he's a bad guy.

351
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,720
He's a villain.

352
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:15,360
And he's like, he's more like Gaston or something if you had to give him like a villain.

353
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,160
He hates book smarts.

354
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,920
He wants to be able to stop reading, women to stop reading and pay attention to him.

355
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,480
Yeah.

356
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:22,960
Wow.

357
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,760
That's very true.

358
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,240
He doesn't have the brawn.

359
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:33,440
Although you could, if you did the same Gaston song, but about eating five dozen egg McMuffins.

360
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,120
He thinks he is like, yeah, it's like LeFou and Gaston combined or something like that.

361
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,280
But he changes his LeFou every week.

362
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,520
It's a new LeFou constantly.

363
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,800
Unless it's Stephen Miller.

364
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,320
That's why he just keeps hanging on.

365
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,200
He's the LeFou.

366
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,160
He is the, yeah, yeah.

367
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,280
He's the guy he can kick into like a pile of chickens or something.

368
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,960
But he'll always dust himself off and be right back with him.

369
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:59,040
Do you know that LeFou was my first big acting role for real?

370
00:17:59,040 --> 00:17:59,600
Whoa.

371
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,160
Really?

372
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:00,400
Really?

373
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,080
I was LeFou in Beauty and the Beast in, God, how old was I?

374
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:08,000
This is in theater camp when I was after fifth grade or something.

375
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,040
Wow.

376
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,720
LeFou, my big role.

377
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,880
Was it like a Disney adaptation of it?

378
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,360
Kind of.

379
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:21,600
I mean, I think like, I sang like No One Fights Like Gaston.

380
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,160
I sang that song.

381
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:22,960
You did that song?

382
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,240
That's a huge song to get.

383
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:24,720
Yeah.

384
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,040
Mm-hmm.

385
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:25,280
Yeah.

386
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,120
So I guess, yeah, I guess it was Disney.

387
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,840
How was your singing then and how is your singing now?

388
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,400
I don't think I know much about your musical abilities.

389
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:37,200
I think back then it was high pitched and now it's more high pitched.

390
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,960
Your testicles have gone up further.

391
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:46,320
My testicles have, yeah, ascended, I guess.

392
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,360
Testicles ascending.

393
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,080
Did you see the live action one and did you have notes for Josh Gad?

394
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,200
I didn't see the live action one.

395
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,480
I will see it.

396
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:59,840
I felt like that was such like a Netflix, you know, as a 34-year-old single man,

397
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,760
like going to see Beauty and the Beast is just a little tricky.

398
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:10,560
And you went and saw it at the El Capitan on Hollywood Boulevard, the Disney-owned

399
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:14,880
theater with a little pre-show and pushed your way through the crowd to make sure you

400
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,400
got that front row seat.

401
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:21,520
Got there first and then there's just like an island, there's empty seats all around you,

402
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,960
like two families avoiding them.

403
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,320
That is what I'm, that's what I'm afraid, I guess you could take like a date there or something,

404
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,400
but I don't, I just, I don't.

405
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,400
With a date to take, would you, would Beauty and the Beast be your choice?

406
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,680
Unless the date was interested in this specifically.

407
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,400
You know, here's, here's, here's how I feel about like the,

408
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,440
one, I'm not a fan of Frozen.

409
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,680
I did not like Frozen as a film.

410
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,880
And then I felt like, kind of like these Disney remakes.

411
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,800
I did think like the Jungle Book was impressive, but I, but there's, there's something that's

412
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:58,880
like a little cynical about these Disney remakes that I don't love or in like the

413
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,920
live action version.

414
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:00,480
Do you know what I mean?

415
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,200
I agree with that.

416
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,520
It's just kind of like, I don't know.

417
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,840
You're just remaking a movie.

418
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,160
Yes.

419
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,760
Making a movie again.

420
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,880
Here, eat the same slop that we know you like, you fucking.

421
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:16,880
That's why even like, even though I didn't like Frozen, I was like, oh, at least it's

422
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,960
like a new thing or whatever.

423
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,280
Yeah.

424
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,000
Sure, sure.

425
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,320
Although they will, they'll run that into the ground.

426
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:22,960
Oh, for sure.

427
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,960
There'll be a live action Frozen, I'm sure at some point.

428
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,880
The musical's coming soon on to Broadway.

429
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,680
Coming to Broadway.

430
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,240
Oh my God.

431
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,000
And Frozen 2 in a few years.

432
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,160
Now that's a real mechanism.

433
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,440
They can just start doing it.

434
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,400
There won't be any lag.

435
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,720
There will just be five different types of Frozen.

436
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:41,920
Although to be fair, when we were children, there were so many Ninja Turtle products at

437
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:45,680
the same time that there's animated and you can go see, and the movies and you can go

438
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,520
see them on the tour and the action.

439
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,920
They're all sort of like different types of turtles.

440
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,000
Very sloppy brand I've noted before in the Ninja Turtles.

441
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:59,200
The people who do, who did Frozen, they did Zootopia, right?

442
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,200
And they, haven't they, aren't they responsible?

443
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,240
They did Tangled, right?

444
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:02,960
They did Tangled.

445
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:03,840
Okay, Tangled.

446
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,680
And then I think they, did they not do Zootopia?

447
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,320
They may have.

448
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:06,720
I don't know.

449
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,280
I don't know.

450
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:11,920
I think the music people were Broadway people, right?

451
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,800
Like did they write the Book of Mormon music?

452
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:18,400
Once again, legitimate Disney fans who might be listening to this.

453
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,080
Don't get mad with us.

454
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,400
We don't know everything.

455
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,640
We're this type of Disney fan, I think, who knows, we know the parks really well and the

456
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,120
rest not so much, although same with Len Testa.

457
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,720
You remember he said that once?

458
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,040
Yes.

459
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,880
He offended a lot of people by saying he likes Disney movies at all.

460
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,760
He doesn't like the Disney movies.

461
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,520
He likes the parks exclusively.

462
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:41,760
Well, I feel like that group that may, which I should never say I don't like

463
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,680
anyone who's making movies or TV, I guess, because of where we live and it's stupid.

464
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,440
But I don't know if I specifically like like the Frozen,

465
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,440
because I didn't love Zootopia much either.

466
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,000
Okay.

467
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,760
But I thought it was, it was okay.

468
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,520
I just didn't, I didn't love it.

469
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,240
I like Pixar stuff more, I guess.

470
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:58,560
Sure.

471
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:02,400
I like Inside Out better than I like Frozen or Zootopia or whatever.

472
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:02,800
Yeah, yeah.

473
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:08,800
I think that Disney, the Disney not Pixar CGI movies have been sort of a sloppier affair,

474
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,720
although lately they've been, at least there's been

475
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,920
giant hits that have really resonated with people.

476
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:18,240
But yeah, but go overall, like your bolts and your...

477
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:22,320
Well, Bolt is like, I feel like Bolt is them getting out of the dirt.

478
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:26,880
They're like getting, like they're finally getting like movies that people want to see again.

479
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:32,240
Well, when they bought Pixar, like Lasseter became the head of Disney Animation too.

480
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,280
Yeah, so I think that part of...

481
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,880
So they put a lot of practices in place that they had in Pixar.

482
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,880
But they have had hit, Big Hero 6 was a hit.

483
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,080
They've had...

484
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,520
Yeah, Moana was a big hit.

485
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,320
Any of that you like?

486
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,040
We should talk about your, where you land with Disney.

487
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:52,080
You were LeFou, any other particular strong Disney connections or theme park connections or...

488
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:52,560
Disney...

489
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,120
What you like or...

490
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,040
Yeah, all right.

491
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,760
I went to, the first time I went to Disney, I was Disney World,

492
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,640
which I argue is the greater Disney Carlson.

493
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,000
And we're going to talk about it at the top of the show today, so we'll get there.

494
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:06,880
I think we forgot to say...

495
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,160
We said it at the top.

496
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:15,520
I went to, the first time I went, I was a child, like a toddler.

497
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,280
Two or three?

498
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,040
Yeah, two or three, somewhere around there.

499
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:22,080
So my parents took me and my sister, my older sister.

500
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:22,580
Okay.

501
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,840
And so I don't remember that experience.

502
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:31,840
And then the second time we went, I think I was in like second grade.

503
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:42,320
And we took like a camper, like we took like an RV with another fan, like my godparents.

504
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,440
Whoa, whoa.

505
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,880
And so we like, we went down, we drove down to Disney.

506
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:52,160
Did you stay at like one of the RV, the campsite kind of place?

507
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:55,920
We stayed at the Grand Floridian at that point.

508
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,320
Oh, okay.

509
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,080
Took the camper to the nice hotel.

510
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:58,640
Oh, you know what?

511
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,520
Was it not the Grand...

512
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,520
Oh no, I think it was the Grand Floridian.

513
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,080
I can't, I'm not going to remember all the places that we stayed.

514
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:08,480
That's the big like ornate hotel right by the Magic Kingdom, like right by the entrance.

515
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,160
It was brand new when we went.

516
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:10,560
Oh wow.

517
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,680
That would line up.

518
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:14,080
Would that mean I would be in like second-ish grade maybe somewhere?

519
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:14,720
Something like that.

520
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

521
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,920
It's where the Kokomo music video was filmed.

522
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,520
That's the most relevant fact to me.

523
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,720
And Hulk Hogan's Thunder and Paradise.

524
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,360
Oh, that's right.

525
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,080
Yeah, yeah.

526
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,120
And then we went one more time when I was in fifth grade.

527
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:32,160
So quite a few, I mean like one, I didn't remember, but two that I clearly remembered.

528
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:39,120
And so this is the timeline of this will work out too, but it was the day,

529
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,800
like the day we were leaving, I remember they were testing Splash Mountain.

530
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,360
Whoa.

531
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:47,760
And we never got to ride it, like we left before it opened.

532
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:53,040
And so that was the first time, like so that was my experience with Disney in my childhood.

533
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:57,360
And then I didn't go again until my senior year of college.

534
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:04,000
When my family and my godparents family, we all went like with adults, we all, there were no kids.

535
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,760
We just all went as though when we went during Christmas time.

536
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:13,200
And I rode Splash Mountain for the first time after like whatever, however many years.

537
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,000
Over a decade.

538
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:14,480
Over a decade.

539
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,240
Break, was it everything you dreamed of?

540
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,440
It is great.

541
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:22,640
I mean, I did love it and I would have been amazing as a child to do it,

542
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,280
but it still was an amazing experience.

543
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,600
And I felt like I was closing the book on it or something like that.

544
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:32,080
But also in that visit, when we went to, I think it was we were in Magic Kingdom,

545
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,120
my dad and I, because Splash Mountain is a Magic Kingdom, right?

546
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:35,440
Yeah.

547
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:40,000
And we, like it was during Christmas and they cut people off,

548
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,160
they wouldn't let any more people into the park.

549
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:45,360
And I remember walking down Main Street and like we came to a halt.

550
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:50,400
And like it was like, it was like we couldn't move on Main Street and it like freaked me out.

551
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:55,360
Like it was the most people I had ever been around in a theme park ever in my life.

552
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,520
It was like insanely packed.

553
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,840
They will like close theme parks entirely.

554
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:04,800
I remember going with my family and passing by a sign that said Magic Kingdom closed,

555
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,280
being like, dear god, that's insane.

556
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,240
It gets to that point.

557
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:12,080
It was so many, it was so many, it was so packed.

558
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:16,320
And like you just like, I remember I couldn't move on Main Street.

559
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,240
And I was like, oh, this fucking sucks.

560
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,880
And then we went and waited in line for like two hours or something to get on Splash Mountain.

561
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,000
That happened to me at Disneyland like two years ago,

562
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,200
like the week after Thanksgiving, family was out visiting.

563
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:35,600
And like a couple of us were walking down Main Street to exit and it just stopped.

564
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:39,360
Like the crowd control was all messed up.

565
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,240
And it's like there's people not moving in front of us.

566
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:46,320
There's people behind and people were starting to get mad.

567
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,360
And it's like, all right, we're just going to duck in the candy store

568
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,760
because it feels like a fight might break out.

569
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:56,240
There are days, this is the dark side of theme parks for sure.

570
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,200
There are days where you'd rather be anywhere else.

571
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,080
And when I worked at, when I was a tour guide at Universal Studios,

572
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,760
I remember like dead heat of summer, people like,

573
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,440
like the line for the stupid tram tour is like three hours long.

574
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,200
And like people are passing out.

575
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,920
There's like medics and heat strokes.

576
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:18,240
They can be such crazy miserable places if the conditions aren't right.

577
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:18,740
Yeah.

578
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,360
It was terrible.

579
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,440
But I mean, I still loved it.

580
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:27,040
I mean, like we were definitely a Disney family.

581
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,280
I feel like once I got to middle school and stuff,

582
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:32,480
like my parents were like, that's over with and they just kind of like,

583
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,120
didn't care about it.

584
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,920
But like, I had always, I always loved it.

585
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:39,280
When we went back and went to college, I was so happy to be back there.

586
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:42,880
And my parents, my mom has Disney points.

587
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:47,360
And so when I was out here, she's like, I got to like waste Disney points.

588
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,200
So like I have Disney points to burn.

589
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:53,600
And so like I remember I took a trip down to the Grand Californian,

590
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:58,000
Grand California or California, California, California.

591
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,280
And I rented a room and my cam for a bunch of people stayed in there.

592
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:07,360
And and that that that the Grand Californian is awesome.

593
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,560
It's an amazing hotel.

594
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:11,120
It's so it is such an amazing looking hotel.

595
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:14,560
And so I've and so I visited I've been to Disneyland, like

596
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,360
I've been out here for 12 years almost now.

597
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,560
And I've been to Disneyland probably like six times.

598
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,600
Five or six times.

599
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,560
It's a decent amount.

600
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely.

601
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,240
But like for someone who, you know, isn't like,

602
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:30,800
like you guys, I guess, out of their minds, not like I found.

603
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,640
I saw the number of how many times I've been

604
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,440
because your annual pass keeps track of it.

605
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:35,920
Yeah.

606
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:38,800
And it is I don't know what it is right now because I haven't checked.

607
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,160
It's over 100.

608
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:40,880
Oh, my God.

609
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,440
Ten years.

610
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,840
That's crazy.

611
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,560
I'll be there probably on average like once a month.

612
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,680
If it gets to be more than that, then.

613
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:53,840
But we do these a couple hour little stints where you go and, you know,

614
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,880
like get a couple get a couple drinks and mess around for a bit

615
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,480
and don't feel like you got to fit everything in.

616
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,520
And yeah, yeah, yeah.

617
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,560
Those are super fun.

618
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:06,160
I feel like for I feel like like when I was so I just recently took

619
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:09,120
like I had friends from Quincy, my hometown, come and visit.

620
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:09,680
Oh, that's right.

621
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:12,960
And I we I took him to Disneyland.

622
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,680
So maybe it is more maybe it's like eight times, but it's not more than that.

623
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:21,040
But I and like I would like I can only imagine Carlson how good you are.

624
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:24,640
But they were like, wow, you're like you're like the Disney king

625
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,680
because I just like knew where to go just because I'd been there enough times

626
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,200
that I knew what to do.

627
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:29,600
Yeah.

628
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:35,120
And I also that day signed up for the path.

629
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,240
You talk about Max Pass.

630
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,200
The Max Pass.

631
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:37,760
Yeah, yeah.

632
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:42,800
That Carlson, you I think you were the one who said it on this text thread

633
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,120
that I'm in that you should get the Max Pass.

634
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,160
And and it was fucking awesome.

635
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:48,960
It was great.

636
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,640
It was it was so worth it because it was like ten dollars per person or something.

637
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,440
And you get to book all your Fast Passes like on the go on your phone.

638
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,440
You book all your Fast Passes on the path.

639
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,760
Like and so we would just basically be going to a ride

640
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,120
and then getting off and going to another.

641
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:06,080
Like I don't think we waited in a line for like a busy summer day.

642
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,480
It reminded me when I was a kid, when I went in like second grade,

643
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:13,280
there was a rainy day and it was like the most empty Disney had ever been.

644
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:16,000
But like Thunder Mountain was still open and we just rode it multiple.

645
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,520
Like we rode it multiple times.

646
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,880
Like they didn't care.

647
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,840
It was and that was like the best day in Disney ever.

648
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,760
It's like a child or whatever.

649
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,240
And then this day was like a close second.

650
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:26,720
Wow.

651
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,200
I mean, maybe even better because I wasn't a dumb child.

652
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,320
It was like I was an adult.

653
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,600
And all your buds are there.

654
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,880
The whole the whole gang.

655
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,840
Yeah, the whole the Quincy guys were there.

656
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:41,520
And we were and we were like I think the only line we waited in was the Buzz Lightyear.

657
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,880
And I was like, well, first we go and get a Fast Pass for this thing.

658
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,720
And then let's ride Buzz Lightyear.

659
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,760
That's how I always started off.

660
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,720
I get like a Fast Pass for Space Mountain or Star Tours.

661
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,600
One of the big ones.

662
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,240
And then yeah.

663
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:52,960
Yeah.

664
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,760
That is, I think, the theme park pro way to do it.

665
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:59,360
You really do forget that when you go with people who don't go all the fucking time,

666
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,600
that like people don't know what the lands are.

667
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,200
They don't know what anything is.

668
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,800
I think just knowing your surroundings is impressive to people.

669
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:08,880
Because we're so insane.

670
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,000
I think we take it for granted that people know everything to do.

671
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,920
Because most people go once or twice a year and they just like go on.

672
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:18,320
And a lot of people don't even use Fast Pass.

673
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,200
They don't even know what it is.

674
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,320
They think they have to pay for it.

675
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:21,760
It's a whole thing.

676
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,200
Like it's like no one.

677
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:23,760
They don't get it.

678
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,280
Those are normal people though.

679
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,320
They're right.

680
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:26,820
Yeah.

681
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,760
They're right to not know all this stuff.

682
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:34,160
I was going to say, I think that I like I am not like I love Disney.

683
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:37,840
But and also there's the besides of Disney, of course, I don't like.

684
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:41,280
But I love Disney and I've been there.

685
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:47,360
I feel like more than the average person will go in their life, which is like 12 times maybe.

686
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:52,400
So you guys have been like like 100 times more than I've been.

687
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,720
And what's the Disney World counts for everybody?

688
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,680
I mean, I'm from the West Coast and I've still been like six times, I believe.

689
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,720
I'm at five or six.

690
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,080
I would need a piece of paper.

691
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,360
Yeah, you've been.

692
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:08,320
I went because we were in the vacation club for a while.

693
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:13,840
So there was a stretch there when I was in like middle school where we went every year

694
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:18,800
for like four or five years in a row when I was a kid.

695
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,360
Yeah, because we went away like three or four years.

696
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:24,320
I once spent two weeks straight in Walt Disney World.

697
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,360
You motherfucker.

698
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,640
Yeah, in an apartment, in like a one bedroom apartment.

699
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,440
What was going on?

700
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,560
Oh, just your family?

701
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:35,360
That was what we it was like the the the vacation club points.

702
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,400
Is that what your mom had?

703
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,680
Is she in the vacation club?

704
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,320
Is that what the points are?

705
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,920
She always just calls them Disney points.

706
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,440
So that could be what it is.

707
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:45,440
But she uses so many of those points on like you don't have to go to Disney.

708
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:50,080
Like you can go to like like Jamaica or Ireland or something.

709
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:53,120
Yeah, yeah, it's probably what it is.

710
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,320
And so you get you buy so many points a year.

711
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:03,360
And then like that that that amount of points gets you like a week at Disney

712
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:09,280
in a one bedroom like hotel suite or like depending on your level,

713
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:12,560
two weeks in what's called like a studio suite,

714
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:15,600
which is like a bigger hotel room that also has a partial kitchen.

715
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:20,320
That's at least how it was in the late 90s when we did it.

716
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:24,160
And so you could bank points like if you didn't go one year,

717
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,640
you could just save those points and apply them

718
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,920
to get like a one bedroom suite or a two bedroom suite.

719
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:34,560
Or you just go and you stay at the studio and you stay for two weeks,

720
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:37,120
which I can only imagine like at a certain point,

721
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:40,160
I know my parents enjoyed it like they were super into it too.

722
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:44,800
But there was a certain point in that two weeks where it's like,

723
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:45,840
is this our life now?

724
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,800
Like, do we have to go back to reality?

725
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,640
Can we just live here?

726
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:51,680
Sure.

727
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:55,680
I was I was saying that I think to you, Carlson, recently,

728
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,880
maybe maybe it was you.

729
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,640
I've said it to a bunch of people,

730
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:03,600
but I was like I always like I feel like a big regret in my life is like,

731
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:07,760
oh, I would have liked out of college or in college to go work at Disney

732
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:12,720
and falling in love with a with a with a Disney cast member.

733
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,680
I mean, like someone who just does the rides,

734
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:19,440
like I'm like, oh, that seems like it would have been the like a magical life,

735
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,000
a simple.

736
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,360
Yeah, that is funny.

737
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:24,720
You bring that up because we we Mitch and I went to the same college.

738
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:25,200
That's true.

739
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,520
We went to Ithaca, Ithaca College, two years apart.

740
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:32,000
And when I was there, I went to like an info session about the Disney College program.

741
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:32,960
Did you ever go to that?

742
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:33,440
I didn't go.

743
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,160
I would have gone.

744
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,240
Would have been a whole other life.

745
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,600
You literally missed the meeting.

746
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,240
I missed it.

747
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:38,960
It came to you.

748
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:39,760
It came to you.

749
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,520
I won like a trivia question.

750
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,560
Like, I don't know what I got.

751
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:45,360
I got like a prize at that and I talked to them and I was like,

752
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,960
this would be really cool to do.

753
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,840
But they have very specific.

754
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:53,040
Their semesters are different than a lot of college semesters.

755
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:59,600
So it's like they want you to take a whole college semester and then like a month

756
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,280
from either end.

757
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:01,440
Yeah.

758
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,400
So it was either like you're on Disney time.

759
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,280
You're on Disney time.

760
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:10,000
So it's like a month of your summer break and a month and a full school semester.

761
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,160
And so like it probably would have put me back graduating and like.

762
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:18,560
But Jason, I think you both agree that being in Disney would have been more fun than Ithaca.

763
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,720
I think that's true.

764
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,080
I mean, I had a nice time.

765
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:25,440
I think it was great, but I mean, like it's a cold ice block.

766
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,160
Oh, yeah.

767
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:29,440
And then Disney is we'd be we'd be marrying those those

768
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,240
these Disney cast members, like we're saying.

769
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:36,160
So you have like an ideal what your would it be like a woman from the

770
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,440
Norway World Showcase?

771
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,240
But it would be a woman from the Norwegian.

772
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:45,040
And I would be in Beast costume with very little makeup.

773
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,520
Just as a cost saver, they should have hired you.

774
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:53,280
I would have married someone.

775
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:54,720
The pretzel stand.

776
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:55,920
Sure.

777
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,560
Would be a family of pretzel people.

778
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,640
Or just or a mini.

779
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,200
And then you ask to like, don't ever take your head off.

780
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,800
That's the only way this will work.

781
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,480
I need to believe you're the real mini.

782
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,480
Truly magical.

783
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,960
Well, well, we should get into it.

784
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:16,480
The grand debate Disney World versus Ithaca.

785
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,000
You raised a few points already.

786
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Ithaca is so far at a.

787
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,920
Ithaca still has their own currency.

788
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,360
They got rid of Disney dollars.

789
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:28,880
Ithaca hours, I believe, are still in circulation.

790
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,320
So the currency category.

791
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:30,800
What were they?

792
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,600
What they were?

793
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,720
There were bonus bucks.

794
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:33,520
I remember.

795
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:33,840
Yeah.

796
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:39,440
You could buy like a shitty like not subway, but like a subway type place.

797
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,920
And there was a terrible sandwich direction.

798
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:42,320
That's right.

799
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:42,560
Yeah.

800
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:45,520
So the campus had its own like bonus box system.

801
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,640
They had its own currency.

802
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:50,320
And then downtown Ithaca, like the local downtown shops had,

803
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:56,960
you could get like one dollar is one Ithaca hour and like their own little currency.

804
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,560
I guess the idea was you keep money directly in the community.

805
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:06,480
We're going to provide a graph later of all of the various points, bucks, hours, credits,

806
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:10,800
all the all the means of currency that we've discussed.

807
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,280
When it snows so hard and the wind is so rough,

808
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:16,160
it feels like it's snowing horizontally at you.

809
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,160
You kind of need to come up with distractions, right?

810
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,280
Yes.

811
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,880
And these hippies came up with Ithaca, or whatever the hell they are.

812
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,320
Off brand sandwiches.

813
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:25,520
Yum.

814
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,440
Disney World, Disney World versus Disneyland.

815
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,080
This is something we know that you're you're passionate about

816
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:36,880
and you have strong views about, or maybe that's the entire view is Disney World is better.

817
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:39,520
Disney World is better than Disneyland.

818
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:45,920
And I think both of you don't like that statement, but I don't know how Jason feels.

819
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,920
But we're cracking our fists.

820
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,440
And here we go.

821
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,640
What did you surprise you?

822
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,600
We have strong opinions on everything.

823
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,200
Get your notes out, folks.

824
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:57,680
Here's how I feel.

825
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:00,320
And a bunch of Quincy friends felt the same way.

826
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:02,880
Disneyland is great.

827
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:03,520
Don't get me wrong.

828
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:03,920
It's great.

829
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:04,880
It's the original.

830
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,280
I know that this is going to come up in your stupid arguments.

831
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,440
I'll cross it out.

832
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:16,000
It's the it's the original like in Magic Kingdom, like the castle is smaller and shittier.

833
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,320
Look, it's made back in the day.

834
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,840
It's smaller and not as good.

835
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,480
I get that.

836
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,720
It's still a slanted view of our view.

837
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:33,600
Here's the biggest part for me is that when you're when you are in Disney World,

838
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:39,600
you are transported to a different place that feels like nothing else in the world.

839
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,800
Like it doesn't feel like you're in a theme park.

840
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:48,240
It feels like you are in a weird, different world.

841
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,440
That's why it's Disney World.

842
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:54,560
And it is more of a the Westworld, the like full immersive experience.

843
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:57,040
It feels like it feels like a Westworld for sure.

844
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:04,640
Disneyland, you can't ever you can you can always feel that you're in in Anaheim.

845
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:11,760
Like it just it feels like you're it feels like you can look over a wall and and feel like see Anaheim.

846
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:18,400
And it just it just it doesn't it doesn't feel like like if you go to the top of the Tower of Terror now,

847
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:22,160
the Guardians, whatever the fuck it is, Guardians of the Galaxy mission break.

848
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,720
If you go to the top of Mission Breakout.

849
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:29,760
It rolls off the tongue, very natural.

850
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:33,360
Another thing that gets me mad about Disney, but we don't have to get into that stuff today.

851
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,160
Oh, we will.

852
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:34,660
We should.

853
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,280
Like I'm like, oh, you look at Anaheim.

854
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:40,800
You can see Anaheim.

855
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:46,000
A place where literally there are KKK rallies.

856
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,280
Not to throw all of Anaheim under the bus, but that does that is true.

857
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,840
Luckily, there's no white supremacists in Florida.

858
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:54,160
No ride could give you Disneyland.

859
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,680
It doesn't even matter what you are.

860
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,360
We're all friends in Disney.

861
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,960
Mitch, what it's surprising to learn, there's a term for this.

862
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,960
This is what's called the Disney bubble.

863
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:03,760
Oh, yes.

864
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,760
Like you go into it.

865
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,560
You don't want to leave the Disney bubble.

866
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:14,000
I love the Disney bubble and the Disney bubble is I don't know if there is a bubble with Disney.

867
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,480
I mean, there is a little bit with Disneyland, but not as much.

868
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:19,040
It definitely pops when you're at the top of the.

869
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:22,800
It definitely pops when you're at the top of the Guardians of the Galaxy.

870
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:23,840
For sure.

871
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:29,760
You can see like, yeah, the the Carl's on Harbor, the Mimi's, the Mimi's restaurant.

872
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,840
Captain Kidd's $11 buffet.

873
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:35,680
Captain Kidd's the restaurant that ripped off the Red Robin logo.

874
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,840
They just like ganked or something.

875
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,280
The exact design.

876
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,880
We're calling you out, Captain Kidd.

877
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,480
On guard.

878
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,720
Medieval Times is right there.

879
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:48,880
I did like there's something about it that just feels like a little like.

880
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:55,600
Like like if it feels like not cheaper, that's like not the right word for it,

881
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:58,080
but like I guess that's all I can think of.

882
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:04,960
It's a little chintzier and there's like I feel like a California adventure

883
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,920
just feels like a Six Flags or something.

884
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,200
It just feels like a cheaper.

885
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:13,440
It just feels like it like it like it feels that way.

886
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,840
And and and go ahead, Scott.

887
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:19,360
Scott does look like he has some anger in his eyes when you say that.

888
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,880
I sure made a face.

889
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,080
I don't think that face was.

890
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,000
I think you all read it is harsher than it was.

891
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,840
I think you were trying to hide it and you were doing a bad job of it.

892
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:31,440
Oh, yeah, maybe my my non-poker face was showing you.

893
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,160
I saw literally all these times that you've been drinking in the

894
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:37,760
Carthay Circle in California Adventure flash between your eyes before your eyes.

895
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,040
And you went, God damn it.

896
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:44,160
You're taking the place where I hold court and you're throwing it down the drain.

897
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:45,600
Hey, you're right.

898
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,800
People are supposed to get mad.

899
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:47,840
Maybe they should get mad.

900
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:52,000
No, the California Adventure, I think when it opened was was a much cheaper park

901
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,520
with a lot of problems and that's they really did scrimp on it.

902
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:59,840
I think in the intervening years, like since Cars Land and this great

903
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:04,640
Carthay Circle restaurant they put in and Mission Breakout, people seem to like a lot.

904
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:08,480
And I think it's I think it has caught up big time.

905
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:14,320
And there are days where actually my wife right now is literally at California Adventure

906
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,560
only, not going to Disneyland.

907
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:17,120
Oh, wow.

908
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:20,560
We will definitely do days where we only do California Adventure.

909
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:24,720
It's got some good I mean, it's got Soarin and I like Soarin a lot.

910
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,480
The new Soarin is great.

911
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,680
Oh, I haven't done the new Soarin.

912
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:31,280
I haven't done the new Soarin and I haven't done Guardians of the Galaxy.

913
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:35,760
And I haven't I haven't really seen Cars Land, so I'm in trouble.

914
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,920
I mean, yeah, it's terrific.

915
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:41,280
Well, you're I mean, then you're correct, I think in the original.

916
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:44,240
Yeah, it was it was a worse park for sure.

917
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:48,720
And it was yeah, it was definitely here's what we can do for this budget.

918
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:52,480
And it wasn't as amazing and immersive as Disneyland, but I think it's caught up.

919
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:58,080
I are you avoiding Cars Land because of how much your Doughboy's co-host Nick Weiger

920
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:01,040
is horned up for Cars Land is how much he loves it.

921
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:04,560
There's a little bit of that that Nick likes Cars Land too much.

922
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,240
Nick also loves the Minions.

923
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,640
So have you been on that ride?

924
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:12,880
I have not been on Minion Mayhem and I don't really want to go on.

925
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,080
Oh, it's fun.

926
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:14,960
I think it's terrific.

927
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,400
I hate this ride.

928
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:20,000
That's really the ultimate bad universal screen ride.

929
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:20,800
Just lame.

930
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,480
It is all the same tricks, though.

931
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:26,880
I don't hate it, but it's the same bullshit 3D trick they use on every single ride.

932
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,080
I mean, I just want to.

933
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:29,440
I think they're endearing.

934
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,800
I think the little girls are.

935
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,240
I'm not saying I hate Minions.

936
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:34,960
I'm just saying after you've been on every.

937
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:38,000
Little girls, huh?

938
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,040
I'm in.

939
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:44,160
Paul Scheer the other day was saying that he loves the Transformers ride there.

940
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:46,000
And I think the Transformers ride is fun.

941
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:46,560
It is good.

942
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:51,360
And it is like a good mix of like 3D and like kind of a dark ride a little bit.

943
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:52,720
But I guess, right?

944
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,200
Like it is a 3D dark ride.

945
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,000
Yeah, kind of.

946
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,520
It's exactly the same as the Spider-Man ride in Florida, which is a better ride.

947
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:00,000
I think it's.

948
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:00,400
Oh, yeah.

949
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:00,880
I did.

950
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,960
I died the last time when I went in college.

951
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:06,640
I did that that Spider-Man ride was like new and it was and it was great and awesome.

952
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:07,120
I loved it.

953
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:07,520
Still.

954
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:07,600
Yeah.

955
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:10,320
The face you all saw me make about California Adventure.

956
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:14,720
I remember Scheer on the doughboys saying his favorite ride was the Transformers ride.

957
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:17,680
And I think I made that face in the car to myself.

958
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:21,680
No offense to he is he is a great man and Transformers is a is a great ride.

959
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:25,920
But at the greatest of all time, I was like, oh, give me I wish I was in there.

960
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:28,400
I wish I was in the studio to argue this point.

961
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:34,880
I feel like I like the mummy ride more than I like even the than I like even the

962
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:39,760
Transformers ride just because it's like a dark ride that's like kind of like a thrill ride.

963
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:43,520
Like I'd rather it be like in more so, I guess Transformers is too.

964
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:48,240
But anytime I'm looking at like the three, if it's a 3D ride, I'm always just like it

965
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,960
doesn't feel it doesn't feel the same.

966
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:54,000
You know, too many of these, there are too many screen rides.

967
00:44:54,000 --> 00:45:00,000
I think the fan outcry about screen rides is starting to get back to Disney and Universal

968
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,280
and they're starting to correct course.

969
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:01,840
I think people.

970
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:05,680
Yeah, I think people know that they you know, you need to give people big physical experiences,

971
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:08,080
which is why Star Wars I think is going to be really exciting.

972
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:11,360
And well, for sure, there will be screen rides in Star Wars and Nintendo.

973
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:14,960
The Nintendo stuff coming up, I think it's going to have a lot of which is funny because

974
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:17,120
it's a video game, but they're going to make it practical.

975
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:18,720
Yeah, they are going to do practical.

976
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:22,480
The Mario Kart ride is supposed to be very big and practical and crazy.

977
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:23,280
That's insane.

978
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:24,400
Like you're going to go around.

979
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:25,360
The Mario Kart ride is practical.

980
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:29,680
Because there's also rumors, I did not sidetrack, it's too much rumors that

981
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:32,720
that you'll be able to throw weapons at people.

982
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:36,240
But like some people are arguing they're trying to do it with like 3D augmented reality.

983
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,640
And then some people are saying, no, you're not going to need glasses for it.

984
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,640
They're like trying to figure out ways.

985
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:41,280
That's exciting.

986
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:45,520
I don't know how, but yeah, they're they're trying to.

987
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:50,240
There's people on the message boards who don't think it's doable the way it is.

988
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:53,680
They think it's impossible the plans they have and they'll never pull it off like the

989
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:54,880
way they're envisioning it.

990
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,760
These message board skeptics, they shut their mouths.

991
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:03,760
Why don't you believe in these people who've given you so much entertainment?

992
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:06,080
Back to the park thing.

993
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:09,280
I believe as we were going down to Disney two weeks ago,

994
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:14,240
we decided California Adventure, right now at least, better than Epcot,

995
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,560
better than Hollywood Studios.

996
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:17,040
Wow.

997
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:19,120
And at least on par with Animal Kingdom.

998
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:20,720
I think so.

999
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:22,960
Yeah, that's an argument I have.

1000
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:28,960
A mark against Florida right now is some of the big parks in Disney World have very much

1001
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:30,000
lost their way.

1002
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,760
Like they're doing so much work on Hollywood Studios.

1003
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,120
Like there's hardly anything open at that park.

1004
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:35,920
There's barely anything.

1005
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:37,360
They just closed the Great Movie Ride.

1006
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:38,640
I was just down there last week.

1007
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,960
I was there the last day of the Great Movie Ride.

1008
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:41,760
That sounds crazy to me.

1009
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:43,920
Which I did not go for.

1010
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:45,840
Like we already had a trip and it happened to fall.

1011
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:48,000
I'm not that insane where I'm like, I had to go.

1012
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
We have to go on the last day.

1013
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
I got to say goodbye to robot Burt.

1014
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:54,880
Mary Poppins Burt.

1015
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:59,440
I want to see the Ripley animatronic one more time.

1016
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:01,280
That weird Ripley alien.

1017
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:02,000
Creepy Ripley.

1018
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,480
The beautiful ladies of Footlight Parade.

1019
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:06,800
Maybe a Mappy.

1020
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:07,840
They're taking this right out.

1021
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:12,560
Do you think that the Footlight Parade animatronics will be on eBay?

1022
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:15,680
I bet you could.

1023
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:19,280
You guys could buy something from the Great Movie Ride, I feel like.

1024
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:19,680
Yeah.

1025
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:21,520
They gotta be selling that after Burt's.

1026
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:23,760
Just a nose of a Footlight.

1027
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:27,120
I'm buying individual body parts of the Footlight ladies.

1028
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:34,720
The Great Movie Ride is what made me daydream about meeting a cast member.

1029
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:41,040
And what if I was the mobster that took over the Great Movie Ride train car?

1030
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:41,600
No kidding.

1031
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:45,040
But you would fall in love with the woman who was doing a tour of the movie?

1032
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:46,080
Yeah, why not?

1033
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:49,200
So there would be a whole thing, like you guys were working together,

1034
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,480
but then you became lovers as well?

1035
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:52,080
In my life, fan fiction, yes.

1036
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:52,960
That's what would happen.

1037
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:57,200
So there's a lot of fake theatrical tension beneath it all.

1038
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:58,160
You're falling in love.

1039
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:04,400
Which is funny because I watched a Great Movie Ride, whatever.

1040
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:05,200
What do they call those?

1041
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:06,480
Like a ride through video?

1042
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:07,600
Ride through video.

1043
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:15,120
And that ride, when the mobster takes over the ride, it's like,

1044
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:16,400
all right, now I'm in charge.

1045
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:21,360
And then sits silently and drives you around.

1046
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:27,600
Takes the turns, calmly, makes all the stops still.

1047
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:31,280
I feel like that ride could have, if that ride was faster,

1048
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:36,800
I guess it would just be that awkward minute of being like,

1049
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:38,160
I'm taking over.

1050
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:40,560
And then he's like, I'm set to go.

1051
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:41,200
You know what I mean?

1052
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,080
I'm set to go.

1053
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:44,160
And then if the ride was fast or something,

1054
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:48,080
then it really actually would have been a much better ride.

1055
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:52,560
Well, the gangster is greedy, but he believes in driving safety.

1056
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:55,680
He doesn't want to hurt himself any more than he wants to hurt anyone else.

1057
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:57,840
Oh, sorry.

1058
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,320
I sent you guys this lately.

1059
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:05,600
I found a blog talking about the great movie ride,

1060
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:08,240
like the week it was closing, a lot of people were posting tributes

1061
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:09,680
or their experiences with it.

1062
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:14,640
And I found someone write a blog about the early plans for the ride.

1063
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:20,800
For one thing, the original tour guide script was 40 to 60 pages long.

1064
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,400
They did all of the talking.

1065
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:24,720
Nothing was prerecorded.

1066
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:31,520
The other thing was that the shirts they wore had a little rip off chest pocket.

1067
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:34,800
And so when the gangster shows up to take over the thing,

1068
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:39,520
he was going to shoot the tour guide and they would rip off the fake pocket

1069
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:42,640
and have like a gut shot or a chest shot.

1070
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:45,680
It would be like a little graphic of blood essentially to make it look like they were bleeding.

1071
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:48,640
A blood and a bullet hole so that the gangster shot them.

1072
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,040
And that was never put into production.

1073
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:52,800
That was like cut before it was.

1074
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,720
But like, wouldn't that have been crazy?

1075
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:58,800
I had a thing I always wanted to do as a universal tour guide,

1076
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:05,200
where I wanted to like get a friend of mine to be a plant in one of the tram cars.

1077
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:10,880
And when we went through the Jaws attraction to have him like stand up

1078
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:16,240
and have just a stump arm that is spurting blood as if Jaws bit him.

1079
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,840
Which I realize now would have been instant firing.

1080
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:20,480
Instant fire.

1081
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:23,040
Yeah, that's oh, and to lose that job.

1082
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:27,040
How could I have dealt with that?

1083
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:29,360
That is a cool job.

1084
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:32,400
You did my dream, but in universal, so it doesn't count.

1085
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:35,120
Yeah, there is zero magic in you.

1086
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:38,160
I like the universal parks, but there's no magic in these places.

1087
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:44,720
But you could fall in love with, you know, Shrekette or whatever.

1088
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:47,760
Or the perfect girl, Shrekette.

1089
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:51,840
The woman who plays Lucille Ball.

1090
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:54,800
Or generic 40s New York lady hanging out the window.

1091
00:50:56,240 --> 00:51:00,720
Or depressed like PA that you see on the actual lot when you drive.

1092
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:04,080
That's always the funniest thing to me is that like you go through that actual lot

1093
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:06,000
and there's just like Hollywood people like.

1094
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:09,840
Carrying a big heavy pole.

1095
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:15,360
So, so I'm all out of sorts now.

1096
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:20,320
Oh, I got you. I was about to come back with Epcot was one of my favorites.

1097
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:23,840
And I love the troll Norway ride.

1098
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:26,560
And even if those rides are bad, yeah, the Maelstrom.

1099
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:28,560
Yeah, I love all those rides.

1100
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:30,720
I'll give you a world showcase is still very good,

1101
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,320
even though they've replaced that with Frozen.

1102
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:33,520
That's a Frozen right now.

1103
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:35,360
Sorry, sorry.

1104
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:36,160
I'm sorry to break it to you.

1105
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:39,520
That being said, I won on the Frozen ride and it is great.

1106
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:42,800
And I don't like a Frozen that much, but it is very good.

1107
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:45,920
Well, that ride is like what I remember of Maelstrom.

1108
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:48,160
There's like a couple like you go down like a couple times.

1109
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:52,240
Right. Yeah, you go backwards down a little waterfall and then you go forward down a waterfall.

1110
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:52,720
It's fun.

1111
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:53,840
So this is the same track.

1112
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:54,960
It's all the same stuff.

1113
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:55,440
Yeah.

1114
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:56,880
They juiced it up.

1115
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:01,840
So world showcase is still good, but where Epcot fails now is that they let future world just like

1116
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:08,080
be the most depressing monument to the 1980 like decaying monument, the Odyssey.

1117
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:10,960
Literally like ghettos of Epcot.

1118
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:11,520
There's places.

1119
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:14,640
It's so sad. It's so god damn sad.

1120
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:22,160
Abandoned pavilions and like, yeah, they they a park that is based on like an optimistic future,

1121
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:26,400
you have to keep updating and they they kind of didn't like that.

1122
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:31,680
That's one of the negative things of Florida is that people don't go there as often as like Anaheim.

1123
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:34,880
If you live in Southern California, you can pop down to Disneyland for like a day,

1124
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:36,640
pop over to Universal for a day.

1125
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:40,160
But like Florida, people go to like a few times in their life.

1126
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:42,720
So they don't like refresh it that often.

1127
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:46,960
So they they also closed the energy Ellen's energy adventure.

1128
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:47,920
Do you remember this ride?

1129
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:51,440
And it's 45 minutes long.

1130
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:53,600
We'll do a full episode on it eventually.

1131
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:55,520
There's 45 minutes long.

1132
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:56,480
It's got Bill Nye.

1133
00:52:56,480 --> 00:53:01,760
It's got Ellen and Alex Trebek, Jamie Lee Curtis as another Jeopardy contestant.

1134
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:03,440
Correct me if I'm wrong.

1135
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:07,200
Was that like a very big like when you sit in it?

1136
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:07,760
Yes.

1137
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:10,160
It's like a very it's like a ton of people, right?

1138
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:11,040
It's a movie theater.

1139
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:12,160
It's a movie theater.

1140
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:12,640
Okay. Yes.

1141
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:12,880
Yep.

1142
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:13,440
Okay. Yeah.

1143
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,040
Even slower than the movie.

1144
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:15,600
Right.

1145
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:21,920
Yeah, I hadn't been on it in 20 years and it was closing and oh my this thing is the biggest piece of shit.

1146
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:25,280
It is not well at all like like movie.

1147
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:25,680
Great movie.

1148
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:25,840
Right.

1149
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:26,880
I'm bummed that they closed it.

1150
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:28,880
I think they should just put better stuff in.

1151
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:29,280
Yeah.

1152
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:30,800
But Ellen's energy adventure.

1153
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:31,360
Get it out of here.

1154
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:32,400
It's the most dated.

1155
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:37,280
It's so weird that it's 2017 and it's still like.

1156
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:45,520
That's a perfect example of what happened to Epcot where it's just like we just let this fucking movie this shitty dated movie play in here for 20 years.

1157
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:50,960
With literally with an Ellen that predates everyone's conception of Ellen.

1158
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:57,200
You know we all know Ellen from the talk show and this is Ellen from the sitcom pre coming out Ellen.

1159
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:57,520
Right.

1160
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:01,040
Like it is another Ellen that we don't even recognize anymore.

1161
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:03,200
It's very bizarre.

1162
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:06,000
And Alex Trebek with the mustache too.

1163
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:06,400
Yeah, that's true.

1164
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:09,600
These icons before the biggest change in their lives.

1165
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:11,920
Michael Richards without a speaking role.

1166
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:12,720
Wow.

1167
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:14,400
Yeah like he's a caveman.

1168
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:17,680
He doesn't say anything he's just a brief shot of he's like a caveman.

1169
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:19,520
Also before his defining event.

1170
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:23,680
I was gonna say you should never have said another thing.

1171
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:30,080
Ellen Cleghorn with a line on this as well.

1172
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:30,960
Damn.

1173
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:34,640
So this is old this is an old thing and it's gone now.

1174
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:38,000
It's going to be replaced by a Guardians of the Galaxy ride.

1175
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:41,440
I'm not joking but it needs to be replaced.

1176
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:42,400
Need it to be replaced.

1177
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:47,360
People's the tributes I saw to that people seemed to like the design of the building.

1178
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:53,280
Some tile art when you walked in and the scene where you go through like the old dinosaurs.

1179
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:54,800
Like that's what people want it.

1180
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:58,240
Maybe they'll keep the dinosaurs around somehow in the Guardians.

1181
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:02,560
I think that there's a rumor they will but there's a there's a chance in five to ten years.

1182
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:04,560
All these parks are going to be amazing again.

1183
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:05,280
I think they're going to get them.

1184
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:06,240
But right now.

1185
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:10,480
I want to hear all the IP opinions.

1186
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:12,880
It just doesn't it just doesn't fit in Epcot.

1187
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:13,680
Like that's right.

1188
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:16,880
Guardians of the Galaxy shouldn't be in Epcot center.

1189
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:18,080
It's it's it's.

1190
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:23,040
You're making the Disney fan argument actually a lot of people feel this way.

1191
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:27,120
I don't because I don't care about Marvel or Guardians of the Galaxy or any of it.

1192
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:30,320
But I'm pro anything that gets new attractions built.

1193
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:35,920
I mean I like rides as much as anyone but like when I went my senior year of college

1194
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:40,320
I was your sophomore year of college at Ithaca.

1195
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:43,280
Just for everyone who's tracking the tracking.

1196
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:45,200
I think how many points did you both have.

1197
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:46,960
Well I was almost out of points.

1198
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:48,240
I was almost out of there.

1199
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:49,920
Yeah I went through those points pretty quickly.

1200
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:52,000
We didn't really know each other that well in college.

1201
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,600
No I feel like I had met you though a couple of times.

1202
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:54,080
Once or twice.

1203
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:58,880
You know I think I has the comedy scene has gotten much much better.

1204
00:55:58,880 --> 00:55:59,600
Yeah.

1205
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:03,600
They have like improv and sketch and stuff which they did not really have when we were there.

1206
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:07,840
I think there was like maybe there was one club that I when I graduated I was the president.

1207
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:11,120
Yes that's which I which I which I knew you were I knew you were the president.

1208
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:15,840
But even that club I remember I went to a meeting like I went to the one of those that

1209
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:18,160
club one time when I was there like my freshman.

1210
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:19,360
So this before you got there.

1211
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:20,080
Yeah.

1212
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:22,320
And I was like this is like like this is bad.

1213
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:22,640
Yeah.

1214
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:24,800
Like it was bad news at that point.

1215
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:26,720
You probably turned it all around I'm sure.

1216
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:27,440
I mean a little.

1217
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:32,560
But also like a second club opened up like like more groups started coming.

1218
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:33,360
What was this club?

1219
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:36,080
I was it was like the Ithaca comedy club.

1220
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:42,880
And we would put on sketch shows or like do do stand up shows and a little bit of short

1221
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:43,920
form improv.

1222
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:46,400
No one really did any long form long form.

1223
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:50,720
There's so many college long form improv groups which always makes me laugh because it's like

1224
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:55,760
well who is teaching the senior in the club is teaching the freshmen how to do long form.

1225
00:56:55,760 --> 00:57:01,120
Of course now they now if I'm not mistaken they have a course that actually lets you

1226
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:03,440
at the end become a birthday boy.

1227
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:08,800
There's 700 birthday boys now.

1228
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:11,840
You add anyone with a who gets a minus or higher.

1229
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:14,080
There are regional chapters of the birthday boys.

1230
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:16,240
I should license.

1231
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:19,760
I have a depressing thing to say about that and once I was going to say at the with the

1232
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:24,480
comedy club wasn't it like in like that like when I first went to it was like in like a

1233
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:27,360
little like dining area like like a cafe.

1234
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:32,960
Yeah which they also cleaned up like mice after you left.

1235
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:34,960
They really cleaned up a cafe.

1236
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:36,240
That's a lot of Ithaca.

1237
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:37,920
You cleaned everything up after I left.

1238
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:41,760
You know what else happened after you left the tuition just kept going up and I'm sure

1239
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:42,960
that was happening while you were there.

1240
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:46,480
I was happening when I was there for sure and then like I went back like years later

1241
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:50,800
I'm like it's much nicer like this I'm mad like you made it so much nicer than when I

1242
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:54,480
was there which I guess is maybe an epic can relate to Epcot in some ways.

1243
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:54,720
Yeah.

1244
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:57,200
Thanks for tying that back.

1245
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:57,680
Thank you.

1246
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:01,280
Yeah refurbishment of the Ithaca.

1247
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:07,600
My one story is that the birthday boys went to Ithaca and there was like like probably

1248
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:10,400
like 40 to 50 people in the auditorium.

1249
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:10,640
Right.

1250
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:16,400
And they were I was talking to like my old professor who one didn't recognize me

1251
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:21,840
and that she was talking about she was like yeah like a few months back funnier die had

1252
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:29,520
come here and it was a Dave Franco and McLovin and like the lines were out the doors and

1253
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:31,360
they chased them to their cars.

1254
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:35,440
I was like fuck this fucking place.

1255
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:38,640
Anyways I.

1256
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:43,920
Yeah that's that you know that that's like IP being put somewhere it doesn't belong.

1257
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:46,560
It's like an Epcot.

1258
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:47,680
It's like an Epcot center.

1259
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:54,640
When I was when I was when I was a senior college I we went to Epcot and I what is the

1260
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:56,800
is it like the ride in the big ball.

1261
00:58:57,360 --> 00:58:58,160
Spaceship Earth.

1262
00:58:58,160 --> 00:58:58,880
Spaceship Earth.

1263
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:00,880
Spaceship Earth.

1264
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:02,320
So we presented by Siemens.

1265
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:07,520
We I was like I want to do Spaceship Earth and we did it and I was with my my godmother

1266
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:13,520
basically and she and she was like at and her son and like at the end of the ride they

1267
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:15,360
both were like that like sucked.

1268
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:16,560
Why did you take us in that.

1269
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:22,560
But I liked I liked I like it also it did it did like it stalled and we were like on

1270
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:24,400
it for like 15 extra minutes.

1271
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:25,280
Oh sure.

1272
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:30,880
And then we did the figment ride where he sings imagination or whatever and they were

1273
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:31,840
also mad about that.

1274
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:36,720
But I liked those like that in my mind is the is the type of thing you're supposed to see

1275
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:41,200
at Epcot like I want like I feel like the world is strange now and that they were like

1276
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:44,800
we can't even like imagine what the future will be like anymore.

1277
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:50,640
So instead we'll put we'll give you Star Lord and like in my mind I'm like at least then

1278
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:56,240
like the 80s they were like they were like like like they would be like Harumba or something

1279
00:59:56,240 --> 01:00:01,120
you know what I mean like like their idea of what the real conception some some ideas

1280
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:06,880
at least and I'm just like sure like Star Lord and his in Groot that's not like what

1281
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:07,680
the fuck is that.

1282
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:13,360
Yeah well they're promising that these rides will not only have IP but will be you know

1283
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:15,680
have the spirit of the spirit in them.

1284
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:19,840
We'll see if it happens inventiveness and you would hate how they tied it in.

1285
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:20,720
What is this thing.

1286
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:23,600
Oh well Peter Quill had been to Epcot as a child.

1287
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:24,160
Here's the thing.

1288
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:25,440
Such garbage.

1289
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:31,200
But here's the thing here's the thing which makes me maybe not hate it is there's rumors

1290
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:35,040
that that ride then will be a best of Epcot ride.

1291
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:36,160
Well I'm on board for that.

1292
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:41,360
You will get like you will still get the dinosaur portion of the ride you will get like reference

1293
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:46,160
Horizon references like this could be like just like cramming the characters in just

1294
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:49,440
for like the kids for the kids to be like I want to go on the Guardians ride but it's

1295
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:51,680
like full of old Epcot shit.

1296
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:52,160
The second.

1297
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:54,160
And it'll be a monument to Epcot.

1298
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:56,640
The second Guardians movies come out and it is bad.

1299
01:00:57,840 --> 01:01:01,760
And like do we really care about like the the first Guardians movie.

1300
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:03,360
I can't even remember what happened in that movie.

1301
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:05,520
These are big hit movies.

1302
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:06,720
People want to see that.

1303
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:08,080
My mom likes Groot.

1304
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:08,240
Yeah.

1305
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:08,640
My mom.

1306
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:13,200
That's the that's the that's the thing whether the movie like the like if a mom likes Groot

1307
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:14,400
there it's going in the park.

1308
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:17,440
But the way they're putting in a Friends from College ride.

1309
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:21,200
High demand for the Netflix series.

1310
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:25,040
I do agree with what you're saying Mitch that it is weird.

1311
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:29,440
It's a little weird to see characters in there and it's crazy how like yeah when this park

1312
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:34,880
opened it was so optimistic and like you know looking at a bleeding edge future and I do

1313
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:40,000
think it's crazy that they haven't like just given one of the pavilions of like this is

1314
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:43,840
the personal computing pavilion and Apple do what you want with it.

1315
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:46,960
Like just Apple make a rock make us a thing.

1316
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:48,640
Where do you want to go honey.

1317
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:51,040
I want to go to the personal computing pavilion.

1318
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:52,560
Personal computing.

1319
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:54,880
Because that is something that's like.

1320
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:55,440
I agree.

1321
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:56,320
We need a better name.

1322
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:58,000
We need a better name is all I'm saying.

1323
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,640
I that's like the nerdy way.

1324
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:02,960
I agree with what you're saying though.

1325
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:06,880
I do I would prefer it was all new rides with new characters a different care like

1326
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:08,720
figment was made up for the parks.

1327
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:12,800
Figment is better than Star Lord in as far as characters go.

1328
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:13,520
I like figment.

1329
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:14,560
I mean I do like figment.

1330
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:15,840
You'll get no argument here.

1331
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:18,080
They need a new figment right.

1332
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:20,480
Like whatever one that's stuck in the 90.

1333
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:23,760
I am also with Scott in the sense that like whatever gets that place that does

1334
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:25,760
like it's a graveyard right now.

1335
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:26,720
If it'll be better.

1336
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:28,560
We'll do it.

1337
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:32,000
But how many how many how many Guardians of the Galaxy rides are going into Epcot.

1338
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:32,400
Just one.

1339
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:33,120
Just one.

1340
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:33,600
Yeah.

1341
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:35,840
And it's replacing this Ellen ride that is a correct.

1342
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:39,520
Which is but then also like God frozen is in there too.

1343
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:40,960
But they're building.

1344
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:42,880
No wars is coming new stars.

1345
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:47,120
But what so what is what is is is it still Norway over there is that.

1346
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:49,200
Yeah it's still it's all still but it's like.

1347
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:51,120
Wait so frozen takes place in Norway.

1348
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:52,240
I guess.

1349
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:53,760
In theory.

1350
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:54,000
Yeah.

1351
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,600
Yeah that's a shady one.

1352
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:56,240
There's a lot more.

1353
01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:57,120
They're fudging some stuff.

1354
01:02:57,120 --> 01:03:00,560
They're like Ratatouille ride is going to be in the France Pavilion.

1355
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:01,360
It's all I.

1356
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:02,400
You know what I'm fine.

1357
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:03,120
That's OK.

1358
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:03,840
That makes sense.

1359
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:06,640
Ratatouille ride in France makes perfect sense.

1360
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:08,000
Yeah but it's a screen ride.

1361
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,440
It's a it's a it's a.

1362
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:10,480
Transformers.

1363
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:12,000
They said they may make it better.

1364
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:12,400
Yeah.

1365
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:12,640
Yeah.

1366
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:13,600
Hopefully hopefully.

1367
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:15,040
I went on it's not great.

1368
01:03:15,040 --> 01:03:15,280
All right.

1369
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:15,840
In Paris.

1370
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:17,680
Let's talk about a different topic.

1371
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:21,840
Can I just quickly say how how dated the Simpsons ride already feels.

1372
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:22,720
Yes I agree.

1373
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:26,320
And it hasn't even been a decade since it's opened.

1374
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:28,880
So the projection is bad.

1375
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:30,080
It's like dark in there.

1376
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:35,440
They didn't they didn't update it from the system from the Back to the Future system

1377
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:37,920
which is 30 years or 25 years old.

1378
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:40,480
So it's yeah it's it's hard to see.

1379
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:44,320
Yes it's it's it's all the same tricks that they use in the Minions ride.

1380
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:46,800
The Minions ride is maybe better than the Simpsons ride.

1381
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:49,280
I feel like it's just going to be just like characters are better.

1382
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:52,080
Better projector better screen I think.

1383
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:53,600
It's just all going to feel dated soon.

1384
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:56,640
But before you move on to the next subject why is Disney.

1385
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:57,360
I keep bumping this.

1386
01:03:57,360 --> 01:04:00,480
Why is Disneyland better than Disney World.

1387
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:03,200
Oh well that's what I say topic I didn't mean.

1388
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:03,760
Okay.

1389
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:08,720
We're doing just another like like so you're talking about how you know it's a world versus

1390
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:10,000
it's a small place.

1391
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:10,160
Yeah.

1392
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:11,360
Because I was just there.

1393
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:14,480
So when I went back four years ago I hadn't been in a decade.

1394
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:14,800
Okay.

1395
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:19,520
And my memory is similar to yours where it was like a magical place where around every bend

1396
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:23,600
is could be what is this it's trees and then all of a sudden oh my god it's a whole theme park.

1397
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:27,440
But when you go back as an adult you're like this is a big fucking swamp.

1398
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:28,800
It's just a big swamp.

1399
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:28,960
Yeah.

1400
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:34,560
And most of the time you spend there is in swamp transit going from one hotel to one.

1401
01:04:34,560 --> 01:04:35,920
You're in a cold bus.

1402
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:38,160
Now I do like how much space it is.

1403
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:38,640
It's cool.

1404
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:43,520
But so much of it is like you're waiting in line for a bus and you take a bus through some

1405
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:49,920
swamp land to the theme park and it's like this isn't I don't know it is like you're like on the

1406
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:53,840
bus and you're like that's nice when you get to park in that Mickey and Friends parking in Anaheim

1407
01:04:53,840 --> 01:04:56,080
and you go on one tram and there you are.

1408
01:04:56,080 --> 01:04:56,240
Yeah.

1409
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:57,680
Both parks are right there.

1410
01:04:57,680 --> 01:05:03,760
But I will say to be fair there's a lot of boat rides that are very magical in Florida.

1411
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:08,400
So you can take boats from like Epcot to Hollywood Studios you can take boat we took a boat from

1412
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:10,480
Disney Springs to our hotel.

1413
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:11,040
Lovely.

1414
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:13,440
So that does have that and Monorail is great.

1415
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:14,240
The Monorail.

1416
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:14,880
The Monorail.

1417
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:15,280
Is great.

1418
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:20,000
So I'm saying good and bad in Florida as far as like it being this giant spread out world.

1419
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:25,120
Anaheim benefits from the fact that like everything is right there you can walk everywhere.

1420
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:29,120
You can walk to the hotels you can walk between two parks you can walk to downtown Disney.

1421
01:05:29,120 --> 01:05:29,680
Small though.

1422
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:30,640
That makes it small.

1423
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:31,200
It's small.

1424
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:37,680
But to the point that when Universal built out their Florida their Orlando parks like they

1425
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:43,280
took that design like the two parks are next to each other the hotels and the city walk

1426
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:49,520
are spread out you can still walk to everything and there's a boat system if it's just a little

1427
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:50,640
too far to walk.

1428
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:55,440
That's true all the other and all the other Disney parks Tokyo and Paris like the parks

1429
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:56,400
are right next to each other.

1430
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:56,400
Yeah.

1431
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:59,040
They haven't done these other giant sprawling.

1432
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:01,760
They don't have a state size piece of property.

1433
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:05,760
I mean this will never happen again in the world that a company buys that much.

1434
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:10,160
I was looking up the acreage Disneyland is about 50 which that seems too small but something

1435
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:17,280
like 50 and Disney World is 144,000 acres which you'll never see that again one company

1436
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:20,720
slowly buying up that amount of acreage.

1437
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:21,520
That's so insane.

1438
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:24,720
Wait so hold on besides that what else?

1439
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:26,160
What does Disneyland got?

1440
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:26,720
Let's hear it.

1441
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:28,480
It's entirely about acreage.

1442
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:31,920
I mean I should get yeah what's what's an argument I have.

1443
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:34,160
You're right the castle's better.

1444
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:36,720
Oh god.

1445
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:43,360
Well I think this doesn't make it better necessarily but you're right about as you said yeah it's

1446
01:06:43,360 --> 01:06:44,160
the original.

1447
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:50,640
They were able to update they were able to like address the problems that Disney World

1448
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:52,160
had with Disney.

1449
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:57,520
They didn't want it to get immediately surrounded by seedy shit and for there to be hotels

1450
01:06:57,520 --> 01:07:01,600
immediately on the border which is why there is so much space on the outside.

1451
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:05,120
Or you know why Disney World is so massive.

1452
01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:10,640
But you know it's not their fault that you know they didn't want all that shit right

1453
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:17,040
on the outside and I think Disney World benefits from coming at being able to address the mistakes

1454
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:19,680
of Disneyland which I guess is an argument for Disney World being better.

1455
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:22,240
But come on count them a break.

1456
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:22,800
Because you're original.

1457
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:25,200
Walt likes Disney World right like.

1458
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:30,000
Well Walt originally bought that property to build a giant experimental city.

1459
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,840
He was more interested in Epcot in Florida than he was in the Magic Kingdom.

1460
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:37,920
He was more interested in like a futuristic cutting edge city with yeah a Disneyland park

1461
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:38,400
next to it.

1462
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:39,840
Which is the coolest thing of all.

1463
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:42,000
Is that he wanted to make some weird.

1464
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:42,640
I love that.

1465
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:42,960
Yeah.

1466
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:43,760
Central city.

1467
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:46,960
But that was the first thing when he died they're like well we're not building that

1468
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:49,360
giant experimental city anymore.

1469
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:52,160
This giant experimental non-Jewish city.

1470
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:54,320
Oh god.

1471
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:58,720
I'm just like we'll just take a drop of your blood and before you come in we'll run a quick

1472
01:07:58,720 --> 01:07:59,440
scan on it.

1473
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:02,080
No it's just to see what diseases you have.

1474
01:08:02,080 --> 01:08:04,000
It's not about genetic making.

1475
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:07,120
No I think well also here's a big argument.

1476
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:10,160
I Disneyland is better than the Magic Kingdom.

1477
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:12,080
Yes I think you compare those two parts.

1478
01:08:12,080 --> 01:08:12,580
Okay.

1479
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:17,040
Those are the same format of park and I think Disneyland is better.

1480
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:18,400
It's better laid out.

1481
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:21,120
It's like a better laid out park.

1482
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:26,080
It's more with news with you don't have New Orleans Square and Critter Country and Toontown.

1483
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:27,840
And then I guess they briefly had a Toontown.

1484
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:29,600
But they had a minor Toontown.

1485
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:31,520
Minor Toontown Fair.

1486
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:36,880
There's more like distinct the lands are better more distinct like everything kind of bleeds

1487
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:38,000
more in Florida.

1488
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:41,920
Like all of a sudden the Speedway is right there but you're in Fantasyland and it's I

1489
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:42,960
don't know you can just see it.

1490
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:47,600
In Disneyland everything is kind of smaller so it makes it feel like you're going into

1491
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:52,720
these little different areas like of the frontier or you know.

1492
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:53,920
You're buying that right.

1493
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:54,420
Right.

1494
01:08:54,420 --> 01:08:57,300
Oh no different little areas.

1495
01:08:59,700 --> 01:09:04,900
Well I guess I guess that that is fair that that Magic Kingdom doesn't have as many good

1496
01:09:04,900 --> 01:09:07,620
rides as Disneyland has in it right.

1497
01:09:07,620 --> 01:09:08,900
Like there's there's.

1498
01:09:08,900 --> 01:09:14,740
I don't think so and I think I think there's I think Space Mountain is pretty and arguably

1499
01:09:14,740 --> 01:09:15,700
better in Disneyland.

1500
01:09:15,700 --> 01:09:17,060
Space Mountain is better here.

1501
01:09:17,060 --> 01:09:17,560
Yes.

1502
01:09:18,100 --> 01:09:19,940
It's gotten a refresh more recently.

1503
01:09:19,940 --> 01:09:23,060
The Florida one is very rickety and it kind of hurts.

1504
01:09:23,060 --> 01:09:27,380
I think we got a better I would say we have a better pirates because we have the restaurant

1505
01:09:27,380 --> 01:09:30,180
we have the Blue Bayou which looks out which is superior.

1506
01:09:30,180 --> 01:09:30,680
Yeah.

1507
01:09:31,380 --> 01:09:34,580
Anaheim benefits from the Southern California weather too.

1508
01:09:34,580 --> 01:09:38,740
Like it doesn't rain as much like the first time I came to Disneyland I was like did they

1509
01:09:38,740 --> 01:09:44,660
just paint everything like everything looks so vivid and that summer I had just been in

1510
01:09:44,660 --> 01:09:50,020
Florida and it was one of those periods of time where they they kind of let the Florida

1511
01:09:50,020 --> 01:09:54,580
parks go to hell a little like there was a bunch of stuff that was broken and like the

1512
01:09:54,580 --> 01:09:57,940
paint was super faded because it rains there all the time.

1513
01:09:57,940 --> 01:09:59,060
Yeah and it's humid.

1514
01:09:59,060 --> 01:10:04,180
Yeah the humidity and people are coming from around the world for like long expensive

1515
01:10:04,180 --> 01:10:09,780
vacations so like they can't shut stuff down for as long as they can like out here.

1516
01:10:09,780 --> 01:10:13,940
By the way I went on the big red boat like like one of the first cruise.

1517
01:10:13,940 --> 01:10:14,580
Oh the cruise.

1518
01:10:14,580 --> 01:10:15,140
The cruise.

1519
01:10:15,780 --> 01:10:19,700
That is another way I got to Disney I forgot we did the big red boat.

1520
01:10:19,700 --> 01:10:21,700
You took it down there and docked wherever.

1521
01:10:22,580 --> 01:10:23,700
We took it down to Disney.

1522
01:10:24,260 --> 01:10:30,100
It was like we went down to Disney and I gotta say this the big red boat sucked.

1523
01:10:31,780 --> 01:10:38,180
It was early on and I've told this story before but I was in a jacuzzi I was like I don't know

1524
01:10:38,180 --> 01:10:42,740
so this must have been like when I was like in fourth or fifth grade and I was in a jacuzzi

1525
01:10:42,740 --> 01:10:46,260
and a log of shit floated up.

1526
01:10:46,260 --> 01:10:50,180
Were you alone in the jacuzzi?

1527
01:10:51,700 --> 01:10:54,500
There were other people there were other people there it was not my log of shit.

1528
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:57,620
No no I said I don't even know what I was asking I was just saying like was it just like stuck

1529
01:10:57,620 --> 01:11:01,060
somewhere and then it floated up or somebody's shit while you were in there with them.

1530
01:11:01,060 --> 01:11:03,940
There were a couple people in there but I don't know if it was like one of them I had no idea

1531
01:11:03,940 --> 01:11:08,500
but also like I remember like the pools being like salty or something like or like like it was

1532
01:11:08,500 --> 01:11:14,420
very it was very it was very strange it was it was it was it was bad it was early on and bad and like

1533
01:11:14,420 --> 01:11:19,140
my godfather was like puking the entire time like I feel like cruise ships in the last like

1534
01:11:19,940 --> 01:11:22,900
even 20 years have gotten so so much better.

1535
01:11:22,900 --> 01:11:26,100
I think Disney took a much more hands-on role with them now.

1536
01:11:26,100 --> 01:11:30,660
Yeah because they were they just like sort of licensed that big red boat but it was pre them

1537
01:11:30,660 --> 01:11:32,580
actually building the boats themselves.

1538
01:11:32,580 --> 01:11:33,940
Okay that makes sense.

1539
01:11:33,940 --> 01:11:37,140
That being said I don't really want to go on these Disney but you guys have you done it?

1540
01:11:37,140 --> 01:11:38,180
I've never done it.

1541
01:11:38,180 --> 01:11:39,780
Does anybody want to do a Disney boat?

1542
01:11:39,780 --> 01:11:42,580
I think I cruised to Bermuda once on like Norwegian cruise line.

1543
01:11:42,580 --> 01:11:43,620
But you didn't do it at Disney.

1544
01:11:43,620 --> 01:11:44,660
Never a Disney one.

1545
01:11:44,660 --> 01:11:48,260
Okay I think you guys now have to do it now that we're doing this podcast.

1546
01:11:48,260 --> 01:11:52,660
Yeah that's true yeah well and it's all it's all write-offs baby that's what we're doing

1547
01:11:52,660 --> 01:11:55,220
that's the entire methodology here.

1548
01:11:55,220 --> 01:12:00,420
Unlike the Doughboys we can 100% be bought like Disney Universe will send us.

1549
01:12:00,420 --> 01:12:01,300
That's what it's all about.

1550
01:12:01,300 --> 01:12:02,100
We're looking.

1551
01:12:02,100 --> 01:12:04,820
We started this thing so we can get a free trip to Dollywood.

1552
01:12:04,820 --> 01:12:10,660
We want to go to Dollywood we want to cover yeah cover a new ride a new Christian themed ride.

1553
01:12:10,660 --> 01:12:12,100
I've been to Dollywood before.

1554
01:12:12,100 --> 01:12:12,420
Really?

1555
01:12:12,420 --> 01:12:13,780
I have yes yeah.

1556
01:12:13,780 --> 01:12:14,340
Good.

1557
01:12:14,340 --> 01:12:18,980
I dated someone who lived in Tennessee and we went to and I wow and we went to Dollywood.

1558
01:12:18,980 --> 01:12:19,940
And what do you think?

1559
01:12:19,940 --> 01:12:20,980
Dollywood is fun.

1560
01:12:20,980 --> 01:12:21,940
I bet it looks good.

1561
01:12:21,940 --> 01:12:23,460
It's like a big frontier land.

1562
01:12:25,060 --> 01:12:26,340
That's a great review.

1563
01:12:27,460 --> 01:12:33,540
There's like Dolly's like cabin that she grew up in and you see like how small it's funny how

1564
01:12:33,540 --> 01:12:39,940
much people like they love Dolly so much and it is like a funny weird thing where like

1565
01:12:39,940 --> 01:12:44,980
there there are like some like exciting like like kind of like thrill rides or whatever but like

1566
01:12:46,100 --> 01:12:51,860
it it feels it is like kind of closer cheaper to like it feels like Six Flags or something but like

1567
01:12:51,860 --> 01:12:54,660
specifically Dolly themed or whatever.

1568
01:12:54,660 --> 01:13:00,020
Yeah well I think every other if you're not operating from the Disney price point it's

1569
01:13:00,020 --> 01:13:04,340
always every other theme park is going to be a little like step down in terms of production

1570
01:13:04,340 --> 01:13:09,220
value and that doesn't mean they can't be charming and fun and I bet Dollywood's a real

1571
01:13:09,220 --> 01:13:10,260
charming.

1572
01:13:10,260 --> 01:13:11,860
It's a lot of fun.

1573
01:13:11,860 --> 01:13:12,180
It is.

1574
01:13:12,180 --> 01:13:12,420
Yeah.

1575
01:13:13,140 --> 01:13:15,220
Well look forward to going there for free.

1576
01:13:15,220 --> 01:13:18,580
Maybe good in between points for us and Scaramucci to meet.

1577
01:13:18,580 --> 01:13:19,380
Oh yeah.

1578
01:13:19,380 --> 01:13:23,060
He's an Easter and see you there.

1579
01:13:24,180 --> 01:13:28,500
We'll see you at the Margaritaville Hotel in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee.

1580
01:13:29,460 --> 01:13:29,860
What else?

1581
01:13:29,860 --> 01:13:34,420
Another knock against Florida is that it smells worse.

1582
01:13:34,420 --> 01:13:43,300
And I'm sorry but it does like a mix of humans or some humans the plastic.

1583
01:13:43,300 --> 01:13:48,580
It's a little there's a little nostalgia but also like it's just there's overwhelmingly weird smells

1584
01:13:48,580 --> 01:13:49,460
and all the rides.

1585
01:13:49,460 --> 01:13:51,380
We're constantly being blasted with air conditioning.

1586
01:13:51,380 --> 01:13:53,620
The air conditioning is crazy.

1587
01:13:53,620 --> 01:13:54,740
One I love that.

1588
01:13:54,740 --> 01:13:55,540
I do too.

1589
01:13:56,500 --> 01:13:59,460
And I love that smell because it's like a weird theme park smell.

1590
01:13:59,460 --> 01:14:02,580
Jack Allison used to say that my car smells like the E.T. ride.

1591
01:14:02,580 --> 01:14:04,260
Oh.

1592
01:14:04,260 --> 01:14:12,100
And I take pride in that because I mean like I love the weird like basement smelling.

1593
01:14:12,740 --> 01:14:16,900
I do like that smell too and I like the one the Anaheim smells are a little bit less strong

1594
01:14:16,900 --> 01:14:18,420
than the ones in Florida.

1595
01:14:18,420 --> 01:14:21,620
The Carousel of Progress smells so weird I don't know why.

1596
01:14:21,620 --> 01:14:22,020
That's great.

1597
01:14:22,020 --> 01:14:23,300
Take its name out of your mouth.

1598
01:14:25,220 --> 01:14:26,340
These are all great things.

1599
01:14:26,340 --> 01:14:29,460
To experience smells that are not readily available every day.

1600
01:14:29,460 --> 01:14:35,940
But because of the weather it smells like a comic convention everywhere because of the people not

1601
01:14:35,940 --> 01:14:36,500
putting on.

1602
01:14:36,500 --> 01:14:38,500
That doesn't turn you off though.

1603
01:14:38,500 --> 01:14:39,540
That's a good point.

1604
01:14:39,540 --> 01:14:40,660
I am fine with that.

1605
01:14:40,660 --> 01:14:42,900
So you're right you've destroyed that argument for me.

1606
01:14:42,900 --> 01:14:48,820
That Florida heat though that can get to you like that can drive people crazy if you're not taking

1607
01:14:48,820 --> 01:14:50,820
breaks and staying really hydrated.

1608
01:14:50,820 --> 01:14:56,260
Now my family we've gone so much we used to go in August because it's cheaper and we don't notice

1609
01:14:56,260 --> 01:14:58,100
like we don't know it's like yeah it's hot.

1610
01:14:58,100 --> 01:15:01,300
It's it was 90 degrees every day we were there for seven days.

1611
01:15:01,300 --> 01:15:02,100
Yeah.

1612
01:15:02,100 --> 01:15:06,340
And you there were like you go into the gift shop and there was I remember there's a mother

1613
01:15:06,340 --> 01:15:11,940
head in hands just like leaning up against the wall sitting down with no family around

1614
01:15:11,940 --> 01:15:14,580
and like it seemed like someone should go help her.

1615
01:15:15,380 --> 01:15:19,860
I don't know like like it's a real there's a madness that can set in.

1616
01:15:19,860 --> 01:15:24,660
Yes I think you're more likely to have a full mental breakdown in Disney World than Disneyland.

1617
01:15:24,660 --> 01:15:25,220
Probably.

1618
01:15:25,220 --> 01:15:28,260
Families who have made that Odyssey just just break.

1619
01:15:28,260 --> 01:15:28,660
That's it.

1620
01:15:28,660 --> 01:15:29,380
You see it happen.

1621
01:15:29,380 --> 01:15:34,980
I like humidity more than dry heat like sometimes at Disneyland and Anaheim like the sun is just so

1622
01:15:34,980 --> 01:15:36,420
blindingly strong.

1623
01:15:36,420 --> 01:15:38,100
Jason I agree with you.

1624
01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:38,820
I'm with you.

1625
01:15:38,820 --> 01:15:39,940
I like to sweat it out.

1626
01:15:39,940 --> 01:15:40,820
I like the humidity.

1627
01:15:40,820 --> 01:15:42,180
I like the humidity too.

1628
01:15:42,180 --> 01:15:43,700
Give me a little humidity.

1629
01:15:43,700 --> 01:15:44,900
Get some moistness going.

1630
01:15:44,900 --> 01:15:45,220
It's good.

1631
01:15:46,340 --> 01:15:50,420
When I first came to Southern California I thought like oh it's hot it'll be like Florida and I'm

1632
01:15:50,420 --> 01:15:52,580
just like why is everything so dry.

1633
01:15:52,580 --> 01:15:55,220
Why? Jason you and I are on the same page.

1634
01:15:55,220 --> 01:15:56,260
I have the same.

1635
01:15:56,260 --> 01:16:00,500
When I brought this up on Doughboys I remember at a comedy show you said that you thought it

1636
01:16:00,500 --> 01:16:02,980
would be Pelican weather out here which is what I did.

1637
01:16:02,980 --> 01:16:04,500
I thought it would be like that too but it's not.

1638
01:16:04,500 --> 01:16:05,700
It's not Pelican weather at all.

1639
01:16:05,700 --> 01:16:06,740
Pelican weather at all.

1640
01:16:06,740 --> 01:16:08,100
I don't even know this term.

1641
01:16:08,100 --> 01:16:08,740
I'm from here.

1642
01:16:08,740 --> 01:16:09,700
I've never heard it.

1643
01:16:09,700 --> 01:16:10,980
It's like scorpion weather.

1644
01:16:13,940 --> 01:16:15,060
The driest.

1645
01:16:15,060 --> 01:16:21,380
It's so dry and so like and like it is like the just the sort of sun that will like

1646
01:16:21,380 --> 01:16:26,660
will just like kill you like it like I'm like oh I would die like if it was a like 200 300

1647
01:16:26,660 --> 01:16:31,460
years ago or something before this is developed before California was really developed if I was

1648
01:16:31,460 --> 01:16:34,180
just here I'd die in a day or something like that.

1649
01:16:34,180 --> 01:16:36,820
And the same thing with Florida or anywhere.

1650
01:16:36,820 --> 01:16:42,340
Well where everyone's going to die everywhere and these conditions will both both

1651
01:16:42,340 --> 01:16:45,220
both scorpion and Pelican weather will get so much worse in the next.

1652
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:48,500
But in Florida it starts raining.

1653
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:49,460
You get the rain.

1654
01:16:49,460 --> 01:16:50,260
It's nice.

1655
01:16:50,260 --> 01:16:51,540
I like the rain.

1656
01:16:51,540 --> 01:16:52,580
I do like the rain.

1657
01:16:52,580 --> 01:16:57,380
Crowd control and we went on an expedition Everest in the rain.

1658
01:16:57,380 --> 01:16:57,780
Great.

1659
01:16:57,780 --> 01:16:59,380
We got pelted in the face with rain.

1660
01:16:59,380 --> 01:17:01,620
It felt it hurt a little bit but that was part of it.

1661
01:17:01,620 --> 01:17:02,260
That's awesome.

1662
01:17:02,260 --> 01:17:02,980
It was awesome.

1663
01:17:02,980 --> 01:17:06,900
I've been in terrifying Disney World rain though like just.

1664
01:17:06,900 --> 01:17:07,140
Yeah.

1665
01:17:07,140 --> 01:17:07,460
Oh yeah.

1666
01:17:07,460 --> 01:17:08,660
It was that level.

1667
01:17:09,540 --> 01:17:10,900
It was that level of bad.

1668
01:17:10,900 --> 01:17:16,020
My dad and I had to run three blocks and pouring rain in a lightning storm like through the

1669
01:17:16,020 --> 01:17:22,820
90s downtown Disney because the bus station was at like the far end and we're just like

1670
01:17:22,820 --> 01:17:27,700
running from like overhang to overhang as we're watching like lightning strikes in the

1671
01:17:27,700 --> 01:17:30,260
distance and it's like we just need to get on that bus.

1672
01:17:30,260 --> 01:17:37,300
And it's because I made him stay at the Adventures Club theater and restaurants until last call

1673
01:17:37,300 --> 01:17:39,700
because I put it to see every show.

1674
01:17:39,700 --> 01:17:41,620
That's a parent breaking story.

1675
01:17:41,620 --> 01:17:42,420
Parents break.

1676
01:17:42,420 --> 01:17:49,380
Oh yeah I would break I would drive my father crazy like I would I would that's one of the

1677
01:17:49,380 --> 01:17:54,900
things I did love about Florida that is so crazy looking back on is I be like oh we have

1678
01:17:54,900 --> 01:17:59,620
like 20 minutes until this fast pass goes on and I'm like well we can go on Pirates of

1679
01:17:59,620 --> 01:18:04,500
the Caribbean and he would just be like Jace that's on the other side of the park that's

1680
01:18:04,500 --> 01:18:05,780
half a mile away.

1681
01:18:05,780 --> 01:18:07,460
We have 20 minutes.

1682
01:18:07,460 --> 01:18:11,780
I'm like well if we run he's like I'm not going to run I'm on vacation.

1683
01:18:11,780 --> 01:18:12,900
It's 80 degrees.

1684
01:18:12,900 --> 01:18:14,900
Adults don't sprint for fun.

1685
01:18:16,660 --> 01:18:18,740
Hey I don't know what else haven't we hit.

1686
01:18:20,020 --> 01:18:22,260
I'll say a couple pro Florida things.

1687
01:18:23,780 --> 01:18:25,380
Obviously I love Florida too.

1688
01:18:25,380 --> 01:18:30,420
Yeah well the ultimate answer is I always would rather be at either of these than anywhere

1689
01:18:30,420 --> 01:18:31,860
else in the world.

1690
01:18:31,860 --> 01:18:33,380
That's true I agree with that.

1691
01:18:34,820 --> 01:18:36,980
It is better than reality world.

1692
01:18:36,980 --> 01:18:37,700
Real life.

1693
01:18:37,700 --> 01:18:38,100
Real life.

1694
01:18:38,100 --> 01:18:38,740
This is horrible.

1695
01:18:38,740 --> 01:18:40,740
Yes.

1696
01:18:40,740 --> 01:18:48,500
Yeah so Florida the Tomorrowland in Florida is slightly better than the one out here and

1697
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:51,860
I'll say this there are more robots in that Tomorrowland.

1698
01:18:51,860 --> 01:18:53,380
There are robots everywhere.

1699
01:18:53,380 --> 01:18:56,100
There's that what's the what's the guy.

1700
01:18:56,100 --> 01:18:56,980
The trash can.

1701
01:18:56,980 --> 01:18:57,940
There's a trash can.

1702
01:18:57,940 --> 01:18:58,660
There's a guy.

1703
01:18:58,660 --> 01:19:00,340
There's a guy who wanders around now right.

1704
01:19:00,340 --> 01:19:01,140
What's his name?

1705
01:19:01,140 --> 01:19:01,620
Robot.

1706
01:19:01,620 --> 01:19:02,420
He's new.

1707
01:19:02,420 --> 01:19:02,900
He's new.

1708
01:19:02,900 --> 01:19:09,220
There's a man who's pretending to be a robot and he like wheels around on wheels and he

1709
01:19:09,220 --> 01:19:12,420
takes pictures of the people and he's a totally made up character which I like.

1710
01:19:12,420 --> 01:19:13,060
An original.

1711
01:19:13,060 --> 01:19:14,340
An original character.

1712
01:19:14,340 --> 01:19:15,540
They'll turn it into a movie.

1713
01:19:15,540 --> 01:19:16,900
I should look up his new.

1714
01:19:16,900 --> 01:19:19,460
As soon as anyone remembers his name it'll become a movie.

1715
01:19:19,460 --> 01:19:24,580
I love Tomorrowland in Florida like that as a kid when that they first redid Tomorrowland

1716
01:19:24,580 --> 01:19:30,020
in Florida to be like the future that we that never was like I loved it and I would just

1717
01:19:30,020 --> 01:19:35,300
ride the people mover over and over again and I love carousel of progress to this day

1718
01:19:35,300 --> 01:19:38,420
like that Robin Williams ride the timekeeper.

1719
01:19:38,420 --> 01:19:39,940
Timekeeper ride that was really fun.

1720
01:19:39,940 --> 01:19:40,740
You ever go on that.

1721
01:19:41,860 --> 01:19:47,060
I probably have have rode all these rides and I've ridden all what is the right word

1722
01:19:47,060 --> 01:19:47,700
road or ridden.

1723
01:19:47,700 --> 01:19:49,220
Ridden road.

1724
01:19:49,220 --> 01:19:50,100
I rode in.

1725
01:19:50,100 --> 01:19:52,820
I rode I rode I've rode in all these rides.

1726
01:19:52,820 --> 01:19:54,820
You've done roadening on the ride.

1727
01:19:54,820 --> 01:19:59,780
I've done I've done road in all these rides and I don't and I and I can't remember a lot

1728
01:19:59,780 --> 01:20:04,820
of them but I was just remembering that there's a brown Derby in Disney World.

1729
01:20:04,820 --> 01:20:05,220
Yeah.

1730
01:20:05,220 --> 01:20:10,260
And it's it has the which has I mean the original brown Derby is in Los Feliz.

1731
01:20:11,060 --> 01:20:12,020
It's a Chase Bank.

1732
01:20:14,020 --> 01:20:15,460
Basically it's mess hall.

1733
01:20:15,460 --> 01:20:18,340
Yeah it's it's mess hall and Chase Bank.

1734
01:20:19,620 --> 01:20:21,620
And that's where the first Cobb salad was.

1735
01:20:22,340 --> 01:20:25,380
So you get that in Disney and it's a great Cobb salad down there.

1736
01:20:25,380 --> 01:20:26,020
That is good.

1737
01:20:26,020 --> 01:20:26,740
I like that.

1738
01:20:26,740 --> 01:20:31,220
And then also I just I was just remembering like good food stuff when I was younger.

1739
01:20:33,220 --> 01:20:37,860
We went to some German place and then there was like a live show and they brought my dad

1740
01:20:37,860 --> 01:20:42,500
out of the audience and they put like Liederhosen on him and he had like conducted like the

1741
01:20:42,500 --> 01:20:44,900
orchestra MGM studios.

1742
01:20:44,900 --> 01:20:45,220
Maybe.

1743
01:20:45,220 --> 01:20:45,460
Yeah.

1744
01:20:45,460 --> 01:20:46,420
No no no no.

1745
01:20:46,420 --> 01:20:47,620
German beer hall.

1746
01:20:47,620 --> 01:20:49,300
Oh right right right.

1747
01:20:49,300 --> 01:20:50,660
Yeah the German beer beer hall.

1748
01:20:50,660 --> 01:20:51,060
Yeah.

1749
01:20:51,060 --> 01:20:51,380
Yeah.

1750
01:20:51,380 --> 01:20:52,900
Better food better clothes.

1751
01:20:52,900 --> 01:20:53,300
Sure.

1752
01:20:53,300 --> 01:20:55,220
Custom Liederhosen for your guests.

1753
01:20:55,220 --> 01:20:57,540
I found the I found the robot his name is I can.

1754
01:20:58,260 --> 01:20:59,780
And here's a photo of him.

1755
01:20:59,780 --> 01:21:00,340
That's cool.

1756
01:21:00,340 --> 01:21:01,380
I like I can take.

1757
01:21:01,380 --> 01:21:01,700
Yeah.

1758
01:21:01,700 --> 01:21:03,940
Yeah he takes photos with people so a lot more.

1759
01:21:03,940 --> 01:21:06,100
Yeah so we were talking about food.

1760
01:21:06,820 --> 01:21:10,580
I will say this Florida has a better downtown Disney.

1761
01:21:10,580 --> 01:21:11,140
Yeah.

1762
01:21:11,140 --> 01:21:14,740
Okay Disney Springs is what they call downtown Disney now.

1763
01:21:15,780 --> 01:21:17,780
And they've recently renovated it.

1764
01:21:17,780 --> 01:21:22,500
There's a new plant in Hollywood which I heard the food is horrible but I didn't eat there.

1765
01:21:22,500 --> 01:21:25,300
I ate at a place called the Boathouse which is right on the water.

1766
01:21:25,300 --> 01:21:25,540
Oh yeah.

1767
01:21:25,540 --> 01:21:31,300
You can drive like you have a man in a captain's uniform drive you in a corvette into the water.

1768
01:21:31,300 --> 01:21:32,660
One of those aqua cars.

1769
01:21:32,660 --> 01:21:33,940
It's an aqua car.

1770
01:21:33,940 --> 01:21:34,980
Oh you did that thing.

1771
01:21:34,980 --> 01:21:36,740
I didn't do it but we should have.

1772
01:21:37,700 --> 01:21:38,820
It was raining real bad.

1773
01:21:39,860 --> 01:21:40,260
Great.

1774
01:21:40,260 --> 01:21:40,660
Well.

1775
01:21:40,660 --> 01:21:41,300
Fantastic.

1776
01:21:42,500 --> 01:21:45,380
There's a place that I didn't go called Paddlefish which is a giant.

1777
01:21:45,380 --> 01:21:49,220
It's like looks like it's on the Mark Twain riverboat but it's just docked.

1778
01:21:49,220 --> 01:21:51,140
It's great I mean Disney Springs is great.

1779
01:21:51,140 --> 01:21:53,140
Doesn't Disney World also have Pleasure Island.

1780
01:21:53,860 --> 01:21:54,420
That's gone.

1781
01:21:54,420 --> 01:21:55,940
That's where.

1782
01:21:55,940 --> 01:21:56,260
Yeah.

1783
01:21:56,260 --> 01:21:56,580
Yeah.

1784
01:21:56,580 --> 01:21:57,620
This old replace it.

1785
01:21:57,620 --> 01:21:57,860
Okay.

1786
01:21:57,860 --> 01:22:02,340
Yeah they just that they have updated like every 10 years they sort of do a refresh and

1787
01:22:02,340 --> 01:22:07,460
put in new restaurants and like more like there's an Edison going down there.

1788
01:22:07,460 --> 01:22:08,260
The LA bar.

1789
01:22:08,260 --> 01:22:10,500
And Edison is going into Disney Springs in Florida.

1790
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:16,340
So is Disney Springs basically like it is it is pleasure whatever.

1791
01:22:16,340 --> 01:22:16,980
Pleasure Island.

1792
01:22:16,980 --> 01:22:17,700
Yeah yeah yeah.

1793
01:22:17,700 --> 01:22:18,100
It's Pleasure Island.

1794
01:22:18,100 --> 01:22:24,660
Basically they took out all the old mannequins and tracks and all the Z named.

1795
01:22:24,660 --> 01:22:26,500
I never got to experience Pleasure Island.

1796
01:22:26,500 --> 01:22:28,660
I wonder how it was back in the day like.

1797
01:22:28,660 --> 01:22:29,540
I would.

1798
01:22:29,540 --> 01:22:30,340
I know.

1799
01:22:30,340 --> 01:22:31,620
Pleasure Island as an adult.

1800
01:22:31,620 --> 01:22:32,900
I went all the time.

1801
01:22:32,900 --> 01:22:33,860
Yeah we didn't go.

1802
01:22:33,860 --> 01:22:39,460
I went as a kid like it was a little weird as a kid to be walking around outside of like

1803
01:22:39,460 --> 01:22:40,980
what were essentially nightclubs.

1804
01:22:40,980 --> 01:22:45,060
Did you and another kid put on a trench coat and get on each other's shoulders.

1805
01:22:45,060 --> 01:22:45,220
No.

1806
01:22:45,220 --> 01:22:48,820
There was a few like that's where I first saw live comedy.

1807
01:22:48,820 --> 01:22:51,060
I think there was a place called the Comedy Warehouse.

1808
01:22:51,060 --> 01:22:56,340
Just people doing like short form games and I feel like some real professional comedian

1809
01:22:56,340 --> 01:23:00,100
like I think Paula Pell like that was the first place she did live comedy.

1810
01:23:00,100 --> 01:23:05,540
I think she sat like she would like sit on men's laps and be bawdy when she was like

1811
01:23:05,540 --> 01:23:06,820
18 and 19 and 20.

1812
01:23:06,820 --> 01:23:08,020
Like that was her job.

1813
01:23:08,020 --> 01:23:10,180
Disney World once had Paula Pell.

1814
01:23:10,180 --> 01:23:13,940
There's a real this check in this horny side of Disney World is funny to me.

1815
01:23:13,940 --> 01:23:16,020
I didn't I didn't get I didn't see it.

1816
01:23:16,020 --> 01:23:17,860
So that's where it got body and pleasure.

1817
01:23:17,860 --> 01:23:19,300
Went down at Pleasure Island.

1818
01:23:19,300 --> 01:23:23,060
I had a friend who worked at Epcot when she was like 18 and it was just like it sounds

1819
01:23:23,060 --> 01:23:26,340
like it was just a fuck around like a free for all.

1820
01:23:26,340 --> 01:23:27,140
Yeah.

1821
01:23:27,140 --> 01:23:33,540
So you take your Norway babe when she gets off work till we're old body Pleasure Island

1822
01:23:33,540 --> 01:23:37,620
and you start getting some ideas in her head.

1823
01:23:38,180 --> 01:23:42,500
That's where I was saying me and my dad were when a lightning storm was bringing out was

1824
01:23:42,500 --> 01:23:49,140
the Adventurers Club which was like a term middle century like explorers club and there

1825
01:23:49,140 --> 01:23:53,140
were different you'd go in the study and there was a show and you'd go in the library and

1826
01:23:53,140 --> 01:23:56,500
there was a show and there was all these bars and there was characters walking around and

1827
01:23:56,500 --> 01:23:58,740
animatronics on the wall that would talk to you.

1828
01:23:59,780 --> 01:24:02,500
And that was like my favorite thing in the world for years.

1829
01:24:02,500 --> 01:24:08,020
It's what my phone case is like I have a phone case for a long gone Disney attraction.

1830
01:24:08,020 --> 01:24:12,180
And here's a strike against Florida.

1831
01:24:12,980 --> 01:24:16,660
Not a lot of couples without kids in their 30s.

1832
01:24:18,260 --> 01:24:22,900
Way more in way more in Disneyland and in Florida because my girlfriend and I are there

1833
01:24:22,900 --> 01:24:26,980
and it's weird because in Florida they would constantly be like parties of two parties of

1834
01:24:26,980 --> 01:24:30,260
like looking for people in line that were just two people because that is a very rare thing.

1835
01:24:30,260 --> 01:24:32,100
Yeah my dad and I would get that all the time.

1836
01:24:32,100 --> 01:24:37,540
Yeah out here it's all parties of two it's all people in their 30s with no kids.

1837
01:24:37,540 --> 01:24:38,740
That's so funny.

1838
01:24:38,740 --> 01:24:42,900
It is it's a whole different there's everyone's got kids everyone is there.

1839
01:24:42,900 --> 01:24:44,820
Probably like six to seven kids.

1840
01:24:44,820 --> 01:24:51,620
A lot of kids it's like a mandatory vacation and then there's these just two like kids we saw we

1841
01:24:51,620 --> 01:24:54,180
met these English kids in line with their parents.

1842
01:24:54,180 --> 01:24:54,900
Oh fun.

1843
01:24:54,900 --> 01:24:58,900
And they're like this has happened to me a couple times out here too where you can see the kids

1844
01:24:58,900 --> 01:25:04,900
looking at us and trying to figure out how old we are because like we're not dressed like mom and dad

1845
01:25:04,900 --> 01:25:11,940
but you're older like the man has hair that's white like his side of his hair is white.

1846
01:25:11,940 --> 01:25:15,140
And yet a t-shirt with Mickey and sunglasses and a surfboard.

1847
01:25:15,140 --> 01:25:17,060
Mickey he's dressed like I am.

1848
01:25:17,060 --> 01:25:19,860
Now I don't want to go to Disney World.

1849
01:25:19,860 --> 01:25:23,460
Maybe Disneyland is better for this embarrassment factor that.

1850
01:25:23,460 --> 01:25:28,420
It's a better place Disneyland's better to go alone as we will sometimes.

1851
01:25:28,420 --> 01:25:35,060
Yeah yes so if you're an adult person without kids Disneyland is by far the better option.

1852
01:25:35,060 --> 01:25:38,900
And Mike you were you were looking for couples in Florida because you guys were looking to swing.

1853
01:25:39,780 --> 01:25:45,380
Yeah we were looking we were trying but it didn't everyone had kids and it was too much of a hassle

1854
01:25:45,380 --> 01:25:46,100
to put them away.

1855
01:25:46,100 --> 01:25:48,660
You're thinking people are in Florida they're loose they want to have a good time.

1856
01:25:48,660 --> 01:25:49,380
Where do you think you're making.

1857
01:25:49,380 --> 01:25:54,740
That we went from like like Disney like like oh Pleasure Island is crazy it's you right over to

1858
01:25:54,740 --> 01:25:58,740
like it's all family both sides of it.

1859
01:25:59,620 --> 01:26:03,140
If you were looking for people to swing with that Disney World where do you think you go.

1860
01:26:03,140 --> 01:26:09,460
Is it the planet Hollywood is it is it is it one of the World Showcase pavilions

1861
01:26:09,460 --> 01:26:11,780
or people getting loose on that sake in Japan.

1862
01:26:11,780 --> 01:26:16,180
I think it's a World Showcase because the World Showcase is a party the World Showcase is by far

1863
01:26:16,180 --> 01:26:20,180
the one thing I would trade a ton of stuff here for that.

1864
01:26:20,180 --> 01:26:24,340
The World Showcase is so big and awesome and there's there is like kind of a Vegas

1865
01:26:24,340 --> 01:26:28,580
vibe where every everyone's like specialty cocktails just some big slushy drink with

1866
01:26:28,580 --> 01:26:30,180
like a little vodka in it.

1867
01:26:30,180 --> 01:26:34,660
They try to act like it's like oh heart of Japan drink and it's like this is just a green

1868
01:26:35,220 --> 01:26:38,660
green margarita there's a red margarita in China.

1869
01:26:39,700 --> 01:26:43,380
Which Disney couple you think would be most likely to swing with you.

1870
01:26:43,380 --> 01:26:44,420
You mean the characters.

1871
01:26:44,420 --> 01:26:45,300
Yeah characters.

1872
01:26:46,340 --> 01:26:47,540
That's good that's a good question.

1873
01:26:48,180 --> 01:26:52,260
I mean maybe one of these princess couples because they don't seem like they you know like

1874
01:26:52,260 --> 01:26:55,940
Snow White and the prince and Cinderella and the prince I feel like I've barely met

1875
01:26:55,940 --> 01:26:58,900
and maybe that marriage starts and they get bored right away.

1876
01:26:58,900 --> 01:27:00,420
Yeah Timon and Pumbaa.

1877
01:27:04,180 --> 01:27:05,620
I think they're gay right.

1878
01:27:05,620 --> 01:27:08,980
Yeah I think so I think they are implied.

1879
01:27:08,980 --> 01:27:12,740
I don't know how they have sex there's no way for them to have sex with Timon getting lost

1880
01:27:12,740 --> 01:27:14,100
in one of his orifices.

1881
01:27:16,420 --> 01:27:17,380
Maybe that's a part of it.

1882
01:27:17,380 --> 01:27:21,540
Maybe he spends a day up in up in Pumbaa somewhere.

1883
01:27:22,900 --> 01:27:24,820
I have a thing in Florida's favor.

1884
01:27:25,460 --> 01:27:30,900
Your money goes a lot farther in Florida than in California like in general but especially

1885
01:27:30,900 --> 01:27:32,580
at the Disney parks I feel like.

1886
01:27:32,580 --> 01:27:33,140
Damn.

1887
01:27:33,140 --> 01:27:38,900
I think I think that there's a I mean the hotels in Disneyland like the Disneyland hotel

1888
01:27:38,900 --> 01:27:43,700
in the Grand Californian are very nice but they're very expensive because there's not

1889
01:27:43,700 --> 01:27:46,420
that many rooms so they kind of have to price it.

1890
01:27:46,420 --> 01:27:51,620
And they're so close that the value is so good in terms of like you can just crash right

1891
01:27:51,620 --> 01:27:52,500
in one of those hotels.

1892
01:27:52,500 --> 01:27:58,740
Yeah so I mean it's great to stay at them but like you can get a much nicer room in

1893
01:27:58,740 --> 01:28:03,860
Florida I feel like for much less there's a couple dozen hotels on the Florida property.

1894
01:28:03,860 --> 01:28:07,220
And in a hotel it says like sports on the outside or something.

1895
01:28:07,220 --> 01:28:07,700
Yeah.

1896
01:28:07,700 --> 01:28:09,620
There's a big basketball next to it.

1897
01:28:09,620 --> 01:28:14,900
You can get any price of hotel I guess on like in Disney World like on property from

1898
01:28:14,900 --> 01:28:18,820
the all stars and then like you Mike you stayed at.

1899
01:28:19,460 --> 01:28:21,220
Port Orleans Riverside.

1900
01:28:21,220 --> 01:28:21,700
Yeah.

1901
01:28:21,700 --> 01:28:25,300
And they I mean it's like a cheaper it's a mid range hotel.

1902
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:27,060
It's a mid range but it's still pretty good.

1903
01:28:27,060 --> 01:28:27,860
Still pretty good.

1904
01:28:27,860 --> 01:28:29,860
And they turn a blind eye on swinging.

1905
01:28:31,620 --> 01:28:32,980
Don't look the other way.

1906
01:28:32,980 --> 01:28:33,780
They encourage it.

1907
01:28:33,780 --> 01:28:42,660
Can I also say that another plus for Florida is as a big guy in Florida much a bunch of

1908
01:28:42,660 --> 01:28:45,380
more fat people I feel I feel.

1909
01:28:45,380 --> 01:28:46,500
You blend in.

1910
01:28:46,500 --> 01:28:50,580
I know I feel I feel almost I feel almost a little small.

1911
01:28:50,580 --> 01:28:51,460
It's good.

1912
01:28:51,460 --> 01:28:54,740
California you got all these fit people and you know how it is.

1913
01:28:54,740 --> 01:28:59,860
I remember like the last time I was there I see like the sheer size of people on the

1914
01:28:59,860 --> 01:29:02,020
like the scooters and the wheelchair.

1915
01:29:02,020 --> 01:29:04,420
It's a lot of rascals in Florida.

1916
01:29:04,420 --> 01:29:04,980
Yeah yeah yeah.

1917
01:29:04,980 --> 01:29:08,900
Sizes you don't see every day in LA necessarily.

1918
01:29:08,900 --> 01:29:11,860
So it's a self-esteem builder.

1919
01:29:11,860 --> 01:29:12,820
That's nice.

1920
01:29:12,820 --> 01:29:17,300
Jason I like the idea of there's a lot of rascals not meaning like actual rascals.

1921
01:29:17,300 --> 01:29:18,100
There's a lot of rascals.

1922
01:29:18,100 --> 01:29:19,460
There's a lot of kids.

1923
01:29:19,460 --> 01:29:22,180
Yeah there's a lot of little rapscalli.

1924
01:29:22,980 --> 01:29:24,260
They're off the leash.

1925
01:29:24,260 --> 01:29:25,780
They're off the leash in Florida.

1926
01:29:26,420 --> 01:29:27,060
Disneyland.

1927
01:29:27,060 --> 01:29:29,060
Disney that's their world not ours.

1928
01:29:29,860 --> 01:29:31,220
That's their world.

1929
01:29:31,220 --> 01:29:35,780
Well are we getting to I don't think we have any structure about it end to this.

1930
01:29:37,700 --> 01:29:38,740
I don't know what do you think.

1931
01:29:38,740 --> 01:29:39,860
Do we change your mind.

1932
01:29:39,860 --> 01:29:46,740
I mean before before before I mean I guess the answer is I will never change my opinion

1933
01:29:46,740 --> 01:29:50,020
about Disney World being not as good as Disney.

1934
01:29:50,020 --> 01:29:53,540
I think I think Disney World is still better but you know what I agree with you.

1935
01:29:53,540 --> 01:29:56,820
I'd rather be at both places than anywhere else.

1936
01:29:56,820 --> 01:30:02,180
I think what we've learned yes is Disney Disney World and Disneyland tie in the battle against

1937
01:30:02,180 --> 01:30:08,100
reality which the cold reality that we will have to face as soon as we leave this studio.

1938
01:30:08,100 --> 01:30:11,620
Yeah we could go straight to my wife is there.

1939
01:30:12,900 --> 01:30:15,140
My wife's mother is there.

1940
01:30:15,140 --> 01:30:16,100
Is my past good.

1941
01:30:16,100 --> 01:30:18,020
I think my blackout dates are over at this point.

1942
01:30:18,020 --> 01:30:18,980
Right they better be.

1943
01:30:18,980 --> 01:30:20,100
If not you have to upgrade.

1944
01:30:20,100 --> 01:30:21,860
You guys go to Disney after this.

1945
01:30:21,860 --> 01:30:23,540
I will think you are all losers.

1946
01:30:24,980 --> 01:30:30,180
Officially only if that otherwise we're the coolest toughest dudes.

1947
01:30:31,140 --> 01:30:35,060
I was going to ask you guys but but before we signed off what your favorite

1948
01:30:35,060 --> 01:30:42,580
food was from Disney or restaurant because I because I went out I went I went on the

1949
01:30:42,580 --> 01:30:47,140
line for pizza which I don't even know if there is a pizza port in in in Disney World.

1950
01:30:47,140 --> 01:30:47,940
I don't believe so.

1951
01:30:47,940 --> 01:30:53,380
No but but I but I like I like how like kind of old and dumb pizza port is.

1952
01:30:53,380 --> 01:30:53,780
Yeah.

1953
01:30:53,780 --> 01:31:00,420
But what's your and I of course I love I love churros and I love what you call it

1954
01:31:00,420 --> 01:31:05,860
uh Dole Whips but what what what are your guys favorite food slash restaurant at Disney.

1955
01:31:05,860 --> 01:31:06,900
So if you can only get.

1956
01:31:07,780 --> 01:31:13,460
Carthay Circle for two different there's two Carthy Circle is the restaurant and bar in

1957
01:31:13,460 --> 01:31:14,580
California Adventure.

1958
01:31:14,580 --> 01:31:17,940
They have a very nice like expensive meal you can get for lunch or dinner.

1959
01:31:17,940 --> 01:31:22,260
They also though which is maybe my favorite place they have a lounge.

1960
01:31:22,260 --> 01:31:25,940
It's a lounge which with a nice bar and they make you a nice like Manhattan the

1961
01:31:25,940 --> 01:31:28,660
Carthy Manhattan with that circular ice.

1962
01:31:28,660 --> 01:31:32,660
You get like a little chicken sandwich you get a cocktail you get two hours in the middle

1963
01:31:32,660 --> 01:31:36,260
of the day it's a nice little cool loss sort of like mahogany.

1964
01:31:36,820 --> 01:31:40,660
It's a nice atmosphere study lounge kind of where is it again.

1965
01:31:40,660 --> 01:31:41,540
It's in California Adventure.

1966
01:31:41,540 --> 01:31:43,300
Okay you haven't been to this place right.

1967
01:31:43,300 --> 01:31:48,100
If you ever turn it around I swear that every time I bring anyone here everyone's like this

1968
01:31:48,100 --> 01:31:50,100
is the greatest this is the place.

1969
01:31:50,100 --> 01:31:53,220
Yeah yeah it's like everyone's favorite place in California Adventure.

1970
01:31:53,220 --> 01:31:54,260
All right gotta go.

1971
01:31:54,260 --> 01:31:55,860
It's great we're going after this.

1972
01:31:56,740 --> 01:31:57,380
Come on down.

1973
01:31:57,380 --> 01:31:58,820
Come on down.

1974
01:31:58,820 --> 01:32:02,660
Yeah you know 110 dollars to get in then a meal that's 100 dollars.

1975
01:32:02,660 --> 01:32:03,940
A 15 dollar cocktail.

1976
01:32:04,500 --> 01:32:06,340
If you want to park up though it's an extra 40.

1977
01:32:06,980 --> 01:32:07,780
Parking as well.

1978
01:32:08,820 --> 01:32:11,220
You can pay us for gas too that'd be nice thanks Mitch.

1979
01:32:12,100 --> 01:32:16,660
Overall even though there's a lot less choices in Disneyland I think Disneyland

1980
01:32:16,660 --> 01:32:18,980
usually has the more consistent food.

1981
01:32:18,980 --> 01:32:25,780
Florida has a lot of pizza and burgers and amazing amazing fine dining but like in terms of like

1982
01:32:25,780 --> 01:32:31,060
just kind of counter service food like California wins very easily.

1983
01:32:31,060 --> 01:32:31,700
Makes sense.

1984
01:32:31,700 --> 01:32:32,200
Yeah.

1985
01:32:32,900 --> 01:32:35,940
You gotta shout out those Mickey bars love that in either part.

1986
01:32:35,940 --> 01:32:36,500
Oh yeah.

1987
01:32:36,500 --> 01:32:37,000
Sure.

1988
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:38,020
Mickey bars are great.

1989
01:32:38,020 --> 01:32:38,520
Yeah.

1990
01:32:38,520 --> 01:32:44,820
I like the Dreyer's ice cream just standard like a double scoop in a sprinkle cone.

1991
01:32:44,820 --> 01:32:49,620
That you can buy at the store.

1992
01:32:49,620 --> 01:32:53,460
You sort of got whispery with it which I think was the uh.

1993
01:32:53,460 --> 01:32:58,420
Hey we would love we would love to treat you guys to a double scoop.

1994
01:32:58,420 --> 01:33:03,780
It's like you want to come back to Port Orleans with us.

1995
01:33:03,780 --> 01:33:08,580
An ASMR section of the podcast where I just describe the food that I have.

1996
01:33:08,580 --> 01:33:08,980
I love it.

1997
01:33:10,020 --> 01:33:12,420
I have ASMR.

1998
01:33:12,420 --> 01:33:13,300
I get that.

1999
01:33:13,300 --> 01:33:14,020
Do you do it?

2000
01:33:14,020 --> 01:33:14,900
It's too much for me.

2001
01:33:14,900 --> 01:33:16,260
I can't my girlfriend likes it.

2002
01:33:16,260 --> 01:33:20,820
I don't I don't listen to like the podcast but anytime I have the ASMR feeling I'm like

2003
01:33:20,820 --> 01:33:25,380
ah that feels nice it's a very nice feeling for those I feel bad for those who don't get it.

2004
01:33:25,380 --> 01:33:26,020
It's nice.

2005
01:33:26,020 --> 01:33:29,300
Is there an there's not an ASMR podcast on Feral is there?

2006
01:33:30,260 --> 01:33:30,980
If so.

2007
01:33:30,980 --> 01:33:32,260
There will be soon.

2008
01:33:32,260 --> 01:33:36,420
Have us on to whisper about respectively theme parks and chain restaurants.

2009
01:33:37,620 --> 01:33:41,780
There used to be a really good fried green tomato sandwich at the hungry bear restaurant

2010
01:33:41,780 --> 01:33:43,220
in frontier and credit country.

2011
01:33:44,020 --> 01:33:48,420
Please don't watch videos on your phone in line for rides without headphones.

2012
01:33:48,420 --> 01:33:51,860
I'd like to enjoy the full themed experience.

2013
01:33:51,860 --> 01:33:53,780
I agree with that too.

2014
01:33:53,780 --> 01:33:55,300
They never should have taken Rex out.

2015
01:33:57,300 --> 01:34:01,220
There's a roast beef sandwich at Flo's in Cars Land that's just terrific.

2016
01:34:02,500 --> 01:34:02,980
I've had that.

2017
01:34:02,980 --> 01:34:03,460
That is good.

2018
01:34:03,460 --> 01:34:03,940
Yeah that's good.

2019
01:34:03,940 --> 01:34:04,660
That's probably up there.

2020
01:34:04,660 --> 01:34:05,940
Cars Land is good food too.

2021
01:34:05,940 --> 01:34:06,580
Cars Land is good food.

2022
01:34:06,580 --> 01:34:08,660
There's a nice cocktail in Cars Land you can get.

2023
01:34:08,660 --> 01:34:13,380
There's a place in the cove bar which has lobster nachos in California Adventure.

2024
01:34:13,380 --> 01:34:14,100
Very good.

2025
01:34:14,100 --> 01:34:15,780
Lobster nachos are great.

2026
01:34:15,780 --> 01:34:16,500
Great view.

2027
01:34:16,500 --> 01:34:18,740
But I always feel like Disney food is pretty good actually.

2028
01:34:19,380 --> 01:34:22,020
It's certainly gotten better over the last 10, 15.

2029
01:34:22,020 --> 01:34:27,620
That's something Universal Studios garbage in terms of food, the entire operation, either park.

2030
01:34:27,620 --> 01:34:28,660
Except for the fried chicken.

2031
01:34:28,660 --> 01:34:30,740
I used to like Doc Brown's fried chicken which is now...

2032
01:34:30,740 --> 01:34:31,300
I did too.

2033
01:34:31,300 --> 01:34:31,780
Yeah.

2034
01:34:31,780 --> 01:34:34,580
Well they use that the same recipe at Cletus's.

2035
01:34:34,580 --> 01:34:34,820
Yes.

2036
01:34:34,820 --> 01:34:35,940
They have the recipe.

2037
01:34:37,380 --> 01:34:38,500
Hey now that we could do.

2038
01:34:38,500 --> 01:34:39,220
That's closer.

2039
01:34:39,940 --> 01:34:41,220
Hey Cletus's.

2040
01:34:41,220 --> 01:34:41,860
Cletus's chicken.

2041
01:34:41,860 --> 01:34:43,060
It's on me Chad.

2042
01:34:43,060 --> 01:34:43,380
Sure.

2043
01:34:43,380 --> 01:34:45,140
Except I don't think any of us have Universal Picks.

2044
01:34:45,140 --> 01:34:45,700
I do.

2045
01:34:45,700 --> 01:34:46,340
I have one yeah.

2046
01:34:47,460 --> 01:34:52,660
That is a thing you could do on Doughboys is the Simpson's Fast Food Boulevard because

2047
01:34:52,660 --> 01:34:54,500
it is... there are multiple locations.

2048
01:34:54,500 --> 01:34:56,820
There's one in Florida and one in California.

2049
01:34:56,820 --> 01:34:58,020
So technically a franchise.

2050
01:34:58,020 --> 01:35:01,940
Jason sadly we've already... we have plans to do...

2051
01:35:01,940 --> 01:35:04,100
We've talked about this sadly we're gonna do...

2052
01:35:04,740 --> 01:35:05,700
That's a great idea.

2053
01:35:05,700 --> 01:35:06,820
We're gonna do Simpson's World.

2054
01:35:06,820 --> 01:35:07,620
It's pretty good.

2055
01:35:07,620 --> 01:35:08,420
Simpson's World.

2056
01:35:08,420 --> 01:35:08,980
Oh hey.

2057
01:35:08,980 --> 01:35:09,220
Yeah.

2058
01:35:09,220 --> 01:35:09,620
Hooray.

2059
01:35:09,620 --> 01:35:09,940
Okay.

2060
01:35:10,740 --> 01:35:12,100
So look forward to that.

2061
01:35:13,540 --> 01:35:14,820
Check the Doughboys out.

2062
01:35:14,820 --> 01:35:16,660
I'll give my final thoughts real quick.

2063
01:35:17,780 --> 01:35:19,540
It's quantity versus quality.

2064
01:35:20,340 --> 01:35:24,260
Disneyland more consistently delivers in every aspect.

2065
01:35:24,260 --> 01:35:27,620
Disney World there is so much you're gonna find so much good stuff.

2066
01:35:27,620 --> 01:35:29,380
It's just that it's not all...

2067
01:35:29,380 --> 01:35:33,300
It's a little bit more hit and miss when you're going to the parks or the restaurants.

2068
01:35:33,300 --> 01:35:35,140
That's my... that's the ultimate.

2069
01:35:35,140 --> 01:35:39,460
But I like that it makes room for weird off-brand rides.

2070
01:35:39,460 --> 01:35:43,220
Like you feel a pressure in Disneyland that the rides have to be kind of really clean

2071
01:35:43,220 --> 01:35:43,860
and perfect.

2072
01:35:43,860 --> 01:35:48,500
And I like that there was Ellen's Energy Adventure even though it's getting out of there.

2073
01:35:48,500 --> 01:35:51,380
I like weird stuff like the Maelstrom or the Mexico boat ride.

2074
01:35:51,380 --> 01:35:55,940
I like that you end up with these odd fringe rides that you'd never see at Disneyland

2075
01:35:55,940 --> 01:35:57,860
because there's so much space to just do whatever.

2076
01:35:57,860 --> 01:35:58,980
There should be more of it honestly.

2077
01:35:58,980 --> 01:36:00,180
Thank you Scott.

2078
01:36:00,180 --> 01:36:02,660
Well as I said I don't hate Disney World.

2079
01:36:02,660 --> 01:36:03,700
I like...

2080
01:36:03,700 --> 01:36:04,820
Yeah we love both of them.

2081
01:36:04,820 --> 01:36:05,700
Yeah yeah yeah.

2082
01:36:05,700 --> 01:36:08,900
It's a very arbitrary podcast topic to be honest.

2083
01:36:08,900 --> 01:36:12,180
I like that and I'll say I'll whisper it for ASMR.

2084
01:36:12,180 --> 01:36:12,680
Oh boy.

2085
01:36:12,680 --> 01:36:13,180
Oh boy.

2086
01:36:13,560 --> 01:36:14,600
The Disney bubble.

2087
01:36:16,040 --> 01:36:16,540
Wait.

2088
01:36:16,540 --> 01:36:17,480
The Disney bubble.

2089
01:36:17,480 --> 01:36:17,880
There we go.

2090
01:36:17,880 --> 01:36:18,920
I didn't really whisper.

2091
01:36:18,920 --> 01:36:20,680
Let's all just stay in the bubble guys.

2092
01:36:21,880 --> 01:36:25,960
That's what I'll say for my wrap-up is I agree with Mike about the quantity and quality.

2093
01:36:25,960 --> 01:36:32,040
But for Florida once you get onto that property, oh man a week in that Disney bubble,

2094
01:36:32,040 --> 01:36:35,720
five days in that Disney bubble, forget about the real world.

2095
01:36:35,720 --> 01:36:36,520
It's terrific.

2096
01:36:37,480 --> 01:36:37,960
Agreed.

2097
01:36:37,960 --> 01:36:42,840
Wonderful. I'll say Disneyland's better but Disney World will be better as soon as Trump shows up.

2098
01:36:43,960 --> 01:36:45,720
See you soon DJT.

2099
01:36:47,160 --> 01:36:51,160
On that note let's wrap the whole thing up and thank our guest Mike Mitchell.

2100
01:36:51,160 --> 01:36:53,880

I would love to go down to California Adventure.
