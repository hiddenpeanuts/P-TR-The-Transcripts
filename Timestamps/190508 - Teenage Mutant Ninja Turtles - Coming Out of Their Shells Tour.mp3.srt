1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,080
Cowabunga, dudes and dudettes.

3
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,160
It's a podcast to ride the second gate.

4
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,880
How else would we start this episode?

5
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,160
Pizza power, man.

6
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,840
Pizza power, peace and love, pizza power.

7
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:32,980
My name is Mike Carlson,

8
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:34,400
joining me is always Jason Sheridan.

9
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,760
I'm Jason Sheridan and pizza gives me strength.

10
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,080
Scott Gertner's here also.

11
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,720
Hey, what's up?

12
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:41,560
Happening.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I wasn't gonna save this observation

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,280
till deeper into the episode,

15
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:50,560
but in both the tape of the Coming Out of Their Shells Tour

16
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,400
and the promotional appearance on the Oprah show

17
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,020
in which they did the full hour of Oprah,

18
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:58,600
in both scenarios, I believe Michelangelo

19
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,820
bursts onto the stage yelling,

20
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:05,820
Happening, which is not a phrase anyone ever said.

21
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:09,740
That was not a cool youth phrase at any point.

22
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:12,740
If whatever older actor was in that suit

23
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:15,580
consulted some sort of slang guide,

24
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:17,580
he must've misread it.

25
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,380
Or there was something at the top saying like,

26
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,640
there's a lot of interesting phrases happening

27
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,600
with the youth today.

28
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,500
And he thought that was one of the things on the list.

29
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:29,300
Surfboard turtles, question mark?

30
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,980
Something with surfing.

31
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:33,020
The closest thing I can think of is Austin Powers saying,

32
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:35,660
it's like, it's happening and it freaks me out, man.

33
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:37,300
Like that's close.

34
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:38,780
Happening might be like kind of that,

35
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:40,180
like a 60s groovy thing.

36
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:43,540
He was mistakenly given a 60s slang list

37
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:46,980
and part of it was redacted, like Watergate papers.

38
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:49,900
And we ended up with Happening.

39
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:53,660
But this episode is pretty Happening, wouldn't you say?

40
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:56,780
Yeah, I would, their voices are very funny.

41
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:58,380
I mean, they were always funny in the cartoon,

42
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:59,820
but especially these voices.

43
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,980
And I think one is the same, Leonardo, I think,

44
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:04,980
is the same guy from the cartoon, I believe.

45
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:06,580
They're really the cartoon spirit

46
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,760
and more so than the movie.

47
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,420
Like, let me play, there's a lot of audio

48
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,440
and we'll link to a lot of,

49
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,460
this is a clip from the making of special.

50
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:16,940
By the way, in case you don't know what we're talking about,

51
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:20,940
the Ninja Turtles went on tour in what, 1991?

52
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:21,900
In 1990.

53
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,260
Or 1990, yeah, yeah.

54
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:26,100
The second thing was in 91, which do we know about that?

55
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,660
I did find out about that. That's the Six Flags one.

56
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:28,500
Yeah.

57
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,780
The stripped down version.

58
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:31,060
Yeah, so they went on a tour

59
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:32,700
called Coming Out of Our Shells.

60
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,020
Coming Out of Their Shells.

61
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:34,860
Coming Out of Their Shells.

62
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,780
Despite the song being Coming Out of Our Shells.

63
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,060
I'm already getting very confused.

64
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,860
Which I saw and Mike saw it, Scott, did you see it?

65
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,980
No, no, I didn't.

66
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:45,420
Oh no. And I wasn't sure how to calibrate,

67
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:46,700
like I even wrote down, like,

68
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,700
did this tape loom large in your childhoods?

69
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,660
It was more than the tape, you guys went.

70
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:51,500
Yeah, we did. And we went.

71
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:52,500
I'm very jealous.

72
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:56,500
And I think when I put together that this, like,

73
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,300
I might've watched the tape and thought,

74
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:03,300
well, when did this happen in 1974, long before I was born?

75
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:06,020
And no, no, no, I was alive and I could have seen it

76
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,860
and my parents didn't take me.

77
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,700
I guess there's no other determination to make

78
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:12,220
except that my parents are bad parents.

79
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,060
I was able.

80
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:16,780
I may have thought that to myself circa 1992.

81
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:19,100
And then they toured again and I didn't see that either.

82
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,940
Yeah, that's criminal.

83
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,700
Yeah, that's what I was like,

84
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,580
oh, am I sure I saw this one?

85
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:27,220
Then a few things happened that I was able to pinpoint this.

86
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:30,980
One, I found the dates, the run dates in Philadelphia.

87
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:35,780
And it ran December 23rd to December 27th, 1990.

88
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:40,780
So my father would have taken probably just me at that age

89
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:46,180
because I would have been in kindergarten to see it at the,

90
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,900
I found out this in the morning call,

91
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:51,580
Philadelphia's third most popular newspaper.

92
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:57,220
In the Philadelphia, it was at the Philadelphia Civic Center,

93
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:02,220
which is where the 76ers used to play before the spectrum,

94
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:03,780
where they don't play anymore.

95
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:06,300
This is like the multiple locations ago,

96
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,020
but it was a large entertainment complex

97
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:10,820
at a convention center attached to.

98
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:15,820
So I saw it there and my father informed me that when

99
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:20,220
in the 60s and 70s, when the Sixers were playing there,

100
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,660
they didn't have a huge fan base.

101
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,780
So he was like, yeah, me and my brother used to go down.

102
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:24,620
It was really cheap.

103
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:27,620
You'd pay 75 cents a ticket for the cheap seats.

104
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:31,060
And then you do what's called the Philly crawl.

105
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,860
And I was like, what is the Philly crawl?

106
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:35,220
And he's like, that's where you buy the cheap seats.

107
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:38,820
And then when the show starts, you make your way to the front.

108
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,220
And I was like, wow, I didn't know that had a name.

109
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:44,380
And also I did that in Philadelphia

110
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:46,820
when the Pixies reunited in 2004.

111
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:50,220
So like father likes that, I guess.

112
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,540
You learned from the best.

113
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:54,420
We all did it at that Batman live.

114
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:56,700
Or didn't you guys separately go to the Batman live?

115
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,940
Oh, I don't think I ever ended up saying that.

116
00:04:58,940 --> 00:04:59,780
I wasn't hanging out with you guys yet,

117
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:02,660
but we bought pretty cheap tickets

118
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,420
and then got into the Staples Center

119
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:06,860
and realized no one is in the Staples Center.

120
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:10,300
The Philly crawl is available to us here in Los Angeles.

121
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,300
I mean, there's so much to talk about,

122
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,900
but let's super clarify.

123
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:15,420
The Ninja Turtles did a tour.

124
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:16,740
This is a common thing.

125
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:19,620
Favorite children's characters tour the country.

126
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:22,060
There's stunt shows, all the Marvel characters,

127
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:25,380
all the Batman characters, all the Paw Patrol characters.

128
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:28,180
Was this a touring stunt show of the Ninja Turtles?

129
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,340
No, no, no.

130
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:33,780
This was an original rock concert with original songs.

131
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:36,620
The Turtles have put down their weapons

132
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:39,140
and started using instruments instead.

133
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:41,580
This is a point that they hit over and over,

134
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,460
especially in the promotional materials

135
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:48,140
that Splinter taught them that actually the power of music

136
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,460
is stronger than the power of violence.

137
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:55,460
And this allowed them to break their usual policy of secrecy

138
00:05:56,260 --> 00:06:01,260
and proudly tour the country for many, many dates,

139
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:04,100
openly as the Ninja Turtles.

140
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,140
But this presents a problem

141
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:08,500
because listing every city you're gonna be in,

142
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,460
you know you're gonna attract a shredder or two.

143
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,380
And sure enough, every city that the Turtles were,

144
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:16,660
so was Shredder.

145
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:20,820
The concert was interrupted and much conflict ensued.

146
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,940
And that's what coming out of their shells was.

147
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:26,980
Yeah, and like obviously for a first, I wanna quickly ask,

148
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:29,860
how into the Turtles were you to?

149
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:30,700
Big time.

150
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:33,300
All my childhood art is Turtles.

151
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,300
Okay, so yours is, yeah, cause I was,

152
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,780
it's like influences on my life is probably like

153
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:42,620
Simpsons, Ninja Turtles, Saturday Night Live.

154
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,180
And you're still keeping the faith.

155
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,020
Where's Buffett?

156
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:45,860
Buffett's climbing the charts.

157
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:47,900
He's certainly in the top 10, but I'm,

158
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,100
he's might be like six.

159
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,420
But it doesn't extend it through your life

160
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:52,980
the way that the Turtles have.

161
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:57,220
Yes, if I see the Turtle toys,

162
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:00,580
just like the backing, the card that the toys would be on,

163
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:03,580
if I see like a picture of all of them on pegs

164
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:06,300
at like a toy store, it does something to me

165
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:09,300
that's so much stronger than any sort of sexual desire.

166
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:12,980
The idea that I would go into the toy store and see Rose.

167
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,380
You'd send us with your girlfriend in the room.

168
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:16,420
She knows what I feel.

169
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:18,260
She can hear it.

170
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,540
No surprise to her.

171
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:23,460
Another few brush strokes added to the portrait of Mike.

172
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,100
Like there is nothing more.

173
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,620
I can see it all now.

174
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,180
Nothing more exciting to me

175
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:30,860
than walking down a Toys R Us aisle,

176
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:34,100
thinking in my head, oh, I wonder if there'll be new toys.

177
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:36,060
And then getting there and seeing that,

178
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:39,940
Ray Fillet is a new toy, AKA Man Ray.

179
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:42,940
He has two different names on the toy

180
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,260
and then in the comics.

181
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:47,380
By your scale, I may need to re-answer my earlier question.

182
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,740
Maybe I'm not that into the Ninja Turtles.

183
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,460
Maybe I knew who the four were

184
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:53,460
and I did like jumps at school

185
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,860
and that is how into them I was.

186
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:55,740
I'll say this.

187
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,140
As we were watching the footage,

188
00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:00,740
I saw a child hold up a set of lime green plastic num chucks

189
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:03,740
and I immediately flashed back to Chot

190
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:04,820
and I was like, I had that.

191
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:05,940
I know I was at the show

192
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,420
because I know I bought that there.

193
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,260
Yeah.

194
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:10,460
That said, that was more of a nostalgic kick.

195
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:11,940
Mike is still keeping the faith.

196
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:14,180
We're surrounded by turtle stuff right now.

197
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:15,020
That's true.

198
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:15,860
That's true, yeah.

199
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:16,700
There's a lot in the room.

200
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:19,700
In a previous episode, I noted Leonardo's tail

201
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:24,100
that is so phallic that I stare at for most episodes.

202
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,780
Didn't we find out that a turtle's tail is his penis?

203
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:27,620
Oh, that's right.

204
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:28,460
Didn't somebody say that?

205
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:29,300
Yeah.

206
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,740
So you are staring at Leonardo's penis

207
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:31,740
while we record this.

208
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,980
He's behind me, so I just have to imagine it's there.

209
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:34,820
I sure am.

210
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,980
If you catch me drifting in most episodes,

211
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:37,820
that's what's happening.

212
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:40,060
So yeah, so I don't want to get too,

213
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:42,220
I could go nuts for turtles.

214
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:45,500
We have to get to this, but side character wise,

215
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,940
how many deep can you get, you think, both of you?

216
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:51,100
We get it, you like them the most.

217
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:53,620
I'm just curious how deep,

218
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,900
because I'll be able to completely assess now,

219
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,740
like your level.

220
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:01,020
I think I do not remember almost any of it.

221
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:05,140
I think after Casey Jones and then as like an alt comics fan,

222
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:08,620
I know you, Soggy Jimbo, is kind of in the universe,

223
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:10,860
but that's a different comics creator thing.

224
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:14,180
Right here, I'll start my list.

225
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:15,740
Vanilla Ice.

226
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,300
Fair, that's in the universe.

227
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,700
I will accept that answer.

228
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:22,900
But no, I recently, I realized I couldn't remember

229
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:26,140
the name of the two of my favorite characters as kids,

230
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:27,740
the snapping turtle and the werewolf.

231
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,980
I don't remember what they were called

232
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,420
in the movie part two.

233
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,660
Right, Jason, do you know?

234
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,300
Fuck, I used to know the term.

235
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,140
I know I had the...

236
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:36,980
Extra mutant horde.

237
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:39,580
Yeah, I know I had the snapping turtle toy.

238
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:40,980
Toca and Razor.

239
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:41,820
I had no idea.

240
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:42,660
Yeah, gone.

241
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,620
And they should have been Bebop and Rocksteady,

242
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:47,700
because why wouldn't Shredder have his normal goons?

243
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,540
But they made up two other characters.

244
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:51,220
But the movies don't really have Krang there,

245
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,060
I named one.

246
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,700
Yes, they don't have Krang.

247
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,620
They don't have any sort of Dimension X stuff.

248
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:57,860
I was just texting with...

249
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,180
Like I was always a kid.

250
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:00,900
I liked the movies a lot.

251
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,860
I probably loved the movies, but I was always like,

252
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:05,780
well, this isn't the real universe,

253
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:06,820
because Krang's not here.

254
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:07,860
We're not in Dimension X.

255
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:10,740
The Neutrino is with Michelangelo's alien girlfriend.

256
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,300
They're nowhere to be found.

257
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,420
Where are Wingnut and Screwloose?

258
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,780
Two of my favorites.

259
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:17,340
Where's Mondo Gecko?

260
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,140
I mean, these characters absent from the films.

261
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,180
You're a stressed out childhood.

262
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:22,380
You're instead of enjoying these movies,

263
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:23,220
where's...

264
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,060
Yeah, I wanted to see...

265
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:24,980
Where's Stretcho?

266
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:27,060
Where's Pleek Pleek?

267
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:32,780
Because my Turtles hit at the same time as G.I. Joe

268
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:34,580
and the Ghostbusters cartoon.

269
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:37,500
So I was just always mashing those together.

270
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,260
And it wasn't until after that,

271
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:41,860
it was X-Men and then Power Rangers.

272
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:44,060
Power Rangers pretty quickly,

273
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,500
that was only a few years there.

274
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,060
So that kind of died down for me pretty quickly.

275
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:50,020
I'm still keeping the faith with the X-Men.

276
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:52,820
I just bought an X-Men shirt on T-Public the other day.

277
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:53,660
Sure.

278
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,420
But the X-Men didn't come to your town

279
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:58,260
to play rock music for you.

280
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,380
How much allegiance can you really have to them?

281
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:01,220
That's true.

282
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:03,900
No, they had two great songs.

283
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,340
There's the theme song to the pilot

284
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:07,820
and then the theme song to the 92 cartoon.

285
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:10,460
All the way through, but they are not playing these songs.

286
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:12,980
And they never addressed in a song that they wrote

287
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,780
what their favorite kind of food is.

288
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:16,900
The X-Men play softball, that's about it.

289
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,980
They're constant, they're always playing softball.

290
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:19,820
That is a thing that X-Men do.

291
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:22,380
They love to play softball against each other.

292
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:25,980
So yeah, so I was just an insane kid.

293
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,940
I guess that's really when my parents or people

294
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:30,340
should have known that I was different.

295
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:32,940
My mutant power was being obsessed

296
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:35,420
more than the kids in the class.

297
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:38,260
Because I, yeah, there was a, in kindergarten,

298
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:40,740
we were supposed to sing a song in front of the class

299
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,340
and everyone sang Twinkle Twinkle.

300
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:45,140
And I got up there and I sang the whole Ninja Turtles theme.

301
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:45,980
Nice.

302
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:49,100
The whole Chuck Lorre, which is not a melodic song.

303
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:49,940
It's kind of just like,

304
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:51,300
shah, nah, nah, nah, nah,

305
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,020
just kind of over and over again.

306
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:56,020
I remember feeling like that may have been a bad choice

307
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:56,860
while I was doing it.

308
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:59,820
I still have the memory of like, oh, this isn't okay.

309
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,860
Your stunts are not going as well as.

310
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,460
Yeah, but.

311
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:06,700
I have an endearing kindergarten story that reminds me of.

312
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,060
That's also pop culture based,

313
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,220
which was we were doing coloring

314
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:12,340
and I was given the page to color.

315
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:13,340
It was just, I don't know,

316
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:15,700
whatever normal everyday life scenes.

317
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,740
And I just took every crown

318
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:21,220
and a different person just got colored all over.

319
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:23,300
And they're like, that's a very interesting choice

320
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,460
because there's so many people

321
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,340
are trying to color into lines and shade.

322
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:29,500
And I was like, well, every character has been slimed.

323
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:33,060
So that's why it was just like crazy.

324
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:34,900
Creative.

325
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:35,740
Yeah.

326
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:36,780
There's, yeah.

327
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:39,940
I have many a slimed picture, I think too.

328
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,580
I was a big Ghostbusters kid as well.

329
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:44,300
Not G.I. Joe for some reason that skipped.

330
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,060
I like Sergeant Slaughter now

331
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:48,580
because of the wrestling mix connection.

332
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:51,940
But the, where am I going?

333
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:52,860
Lost my train of thought.

334
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:53,860
You sang the song.

335
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:56,020
You were disappointed you didn't lose your virginity

336
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,020
to a Ninja Turtle.

337
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:01,500
Well, there was that sexy lady Ninja Turtle later on.

338
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,820
Venus de Milo came in the next mutation.

339
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,660
I certainly then, that was the first,

340
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,300
that was actually the first time I had any sort

341
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,660
of sexual feelings at all.

342
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,420
By the time you hit third beats of the Herald,

343
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:12,900
the game starts to break down.

344
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:17,180
But yeah, I am still in my thirties.

345
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:21,140
There are, this company NECA is making unbelievable turtles.

346
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:23,340
That's that Raphael one in the trench coat.

347
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,180
Oh yeah.

348
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:26,580
And this guy, there's a guy named Randy in charge of NECA.

349
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,060
He is sort of promising, I think,

350
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:32,420
to make as much movie stuff and cartoon stuff as he can.

351
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:35,580
Which means I want Keno from A Secret of the Ooze.

352
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:38,340
There will be a quarter inch Keno

353
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:40,180
to what he'll be staring at you while we record.

354
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:42,140
You'll be able to see his penis somehow.

355
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:45,700
I want Vanilla Ice's backup group, Earthquake.

356
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,940
Very possible.

357
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:48,540
Yeah, give me an Earthquake.

358
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:51,100
I think at least Vanilla Ice is very possible.

359
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,220
That's a good idea.

360
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:53,300
It's a great idea.

361
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,300
I asked this guy Randy on Twitter

362
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:58,940
and he'll oftentimes like curtly answer questions.

363
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,620
And I said, what are the chances

364
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:04,860
of coming out of our Shells tour quarter inch?

365
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,300
And he said, no chance.

366
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,380
No!

367
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,100
Which I thought was rude.

368
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,660
And he won't make Turtles 3 either,

369
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:13,820
which I think is underappreciated.

370
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,180
Those costumes are great.

371
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,820
Yeah, and the samurai, they have the samurai,

372
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:18,500
that'll be great.

373
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,340
Then their samurai outfits, come on.

374
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:20,780
I think there are toys of that,

375
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:22,540
despite not really liking that movie.

376
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:25,460
I thought the samurai toys were cool.

377
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:28,780
I think the suits in coming out of our Shells are good.

378
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:31,580
I like it, it's like a lighter green and they're speckled.

379
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:36,220
And I love their sparkly bandanas

380
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:40,900
that cover where their genitals might be.

381
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:43,340
Well, now hold on a second,

382
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:46,300
but that's not the only suits coming out of their Shells.

383
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:51,140
Because the pre-shot footage

384
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,700
is a different set of suits.

385
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:53,980
Yes, it is.

386
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,860
Yeah, that's very confusing.

387
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:59,700
And some of it is used in the show.

388
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:02,300
So this is probably a good juncture to say,

389
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:05,100
you guys had the luxury of seeing it in person.

390
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,660
I, with my piss poor parents.

391
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:10,020
I'm just joking, if you ever hear this.

392
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:13,820
I did not go to see it, but I rented this.

393
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,060
I hardly didn't own the video,

394
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:17,900
but I rented it probably far beyond the point

395
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:18,820
where I should have just bought it.

396
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:21,180
I always wanted this if I went to the video store.

397
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,900
And then there was a separate video

398
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:26,420
that was the making of the coming out of their Shells tour.

399
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:31,420
And this is the laziest compiled from press conferences,

400
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:34,900
the senior VP of Pizza Hut marketing,

401
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,740
was prattling on and on.

402
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:37,900
I have that clip.

403
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,500
Oh great, wonderful, perfect.

404
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,380
The thing I was gonna say about the suits,

405
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:43,500
and then please play it if you wanna play.

406
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,260
So yeah, there's all this pre-material

407
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:48,220
where things are a little different.

408
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,340
Actually, if you listen closely,

409
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:51,620
there's a shredder who is a British shredder.

410
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:54,620
It's not the shredder ultimately in the show.

411
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,180
But yeah, they have one that's like a ninja star

412
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,140
over their eye.

413
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:00,340
And then in the actual show,

414
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:04,020
the old turtles call in and are on video.

415
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:05,420
And that's very confusing,

416
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:06,740
because that's not what they were just wearing

417
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:09,100
and will be wearing again in five minutes.

418
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,860
But the main thing that I noticed

419
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,460
when I watched the making of

420
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:15,620
is that the turtles have less clothes.

421
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:18,660
They have less strips of fabric hanging everywhere.

422
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:21,660
And especially not sort of the like Mowgli-esque

423
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:24,540
loin cloth over their front parts.

424
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:28,140
And I think I know why they added this.

425
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:30,860
I don't have the still handy,

426
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:34,020
but I'll make sure that I post it.

427
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:37,380
There is a part where Donatello is hanging out in the studio

428
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:39,620
and just sort of like, you know,

429
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:42,620
just full like front shell out.

430
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:46,340
And between his legs is a big lump

431
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:49,340
with kind of a separation in the middle.

432
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:54,140
What I am saying is this is heavily vaginal.

433
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:57,860
It truly looks like Donatello

434
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:00,140
just has a big camel toe hanging out.

435
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:05,060
So yet I'm looking at your penis tail back there.

436
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:09,060
These turtles, but your toy back there,

437
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,820
while there is like a line and a lump,

438
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:13,300
it is not nearly as vaginal as these original suits.

439
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,740
So I think they seeded some of this material

440
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:18,380
and they must have gotten the feedback.

441
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:20,420
Why do they all have?

442
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:22,180
This is making me too hot.

443
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:26,100
Let's edit where we all.

444
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:28,460
We gotta clean up this costume.

445
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:31,580
Give you an ice pack to put on your forehead.

446
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:34,340
It's really jarringly.

447
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:36,060
So good for the, but they adjusted.

448
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,620
Like the makers of the Sonic film,

449
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:39,620
they got feedback and they adjusted.

450
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:45,340
Raphael doing the basic instinct leg cross.

451
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:46,780
It's all.

452
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:49,420
He's only got that trench coat on.

453
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:52,660
With a shredder in the Wayne Knight position,

454
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:54,180
just kind of like peering.

455
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,980
Am I seeing what I think I'm seeing?

456
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:58,100
Sweat pouring down face.

457
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:01,260
This was what you're saying was not lost on me

458
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,100
when I was six.

459
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:06,820
As a kid, I had the big,

460
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:08,580
you see it in some of the promotional,

461
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:11,100
there was this big, thick, tall book

462
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,780
you would get from Pizza Hut.

463
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:16,300
That was like a program essentially that you would get.

464
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,740
And I had it and we had the cassette from Pizza Hut.

465
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:20,860
We knew the songs beforehand.

466
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:22,100
My mom would play the cassette.

467
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:22,940
She likes the songs.

468
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,500
She still remembers the songs.

469
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,260
So I had both tapes and that.

470
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,100
And I know this.

471
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,180
Pre-the show?

472
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:31,020
Pre-the show.

473
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,220
Wow.

474
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,620
I'm trying to think when we got the tapes.

475
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:35,020
I don't know where the timetable of the tapes,

476
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:37,980
but we had the cassette and the booklet pre-show.

477
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:39,500
So we knew the songs going in.

478
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:43,420
And all those things you're saying, I noticed.

479
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:45,260
It didn't take me completely.

480
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:46,100
You noticed the vagina?

481
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:46,940
I didn't notice the vagina.

482
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,620
That's what it really sounded like.

483
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,460
It doesn't sound like it lost on me.

484
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:51,300
You're right.

485
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,500
I was just making a point about the inconsistencies

486
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,700
and the strangeness.

487
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,900
Because you could see that the costumes were different

488
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,420
and then they had a different,

489
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:00,620
like the art on the front didn't quite match up

490
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:02,580
with what they look like on stage.

491
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:06,620
Art of like, it's sort of probably Raphael

492
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:09,220
kind of like shooting out of a void,

493
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:12,420
shoving a guitar at you and shells done beautifully

494
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:16,460
in the classic turtle-y, turtle font.

495
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:17,540
It's nicely done.

496
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:19,500
I know for a fact I did not have that

497
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,580
because I both admire that piece of art

498
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:24,300
and find it a little unnerving.

499
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,540
And I think that would have upset me as a child.

500
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,700
Because they're breaking through a shell

501
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:28,540
like it's their own shell?

502
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:31,380
No, it's just that kind of level of detail.

503
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,300
That sort of like, it's a little ugly.

504
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,820
It's very deep, hyper real.

505
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:41,460
Yeah, there was some comics artists who I like now.

506
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:43,460
But when I was a kid, Bill Sinkevich,

507
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:44,820
I would find very unnerving.

508
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,500
And now he's one of my favorites.

509
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,180
I see what you're saying.

510
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:51,780
So to that point, and I know this is not a visual podcast,

511
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,980
but when I was looking through the making of,

512
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,460
Scott's not gonna be able to see this.

513
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,060
He probably has seen this before.

514
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:00,020
When you go to 557,

515
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:01,300
or yes I know.

516
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,780
557, of course maybe you already know.

517
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:05,940
They show a clip of,

518
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:08,620
because they play it basically like a mockumentary

519
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:10,420
of like the turtles are real.

520
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:11,260
They were brothers.

521
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:12,100
This is they just decided.

522
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:13,060
We found out about this band.

523
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:15,820
You're watching all these music executives act.

524
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:18,620
And the guy who wrote the songs, Bob Bijan,

525
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:20,140
who's a very interesting character.

526
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:21,100
Oh, okay.

527
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,580
Who, and I'll just say,

528
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:24,220
I'll say this actually just now.

529
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:25,220
Did you read anything about him?

530
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:26,060
A little bit.

531
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:28,260
He like is the head of something at Microsoft.

532
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,500
He's a big Microsoft big wig.

533
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,620
I have it written down here.

534
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:34,220
Chief development officer of MSL group.

535
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:38,260
He's a co-founder and CEO of PBJS, advertising market.

536
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:39,660
Like it's a marketing guy.

537
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:42,260
And then where's, he's like something major.

538
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:45,260
I have so many, gosh, damn links here.

539
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:47,820
And he also wrote the song, Tubin,

540
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:50,060
where the turtles sing about skateboarding

541
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:54,140
and are in this sewer and are joined by a lot of crocodiles.

542
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:55,340
Wait, hold on.

543
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:57,620
He's the head of global events, production studios

544
00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:00,900
and the marketing community at Microsoft corporation.

545
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,220
I mean, that's pretty good.

546
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,540
That's so heavy.

547
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:06,300
Was Tubin about going through the sewer too?

548
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,740
I thought it was about like you got on the tube

549
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:10,420
and you rode through the, they like.

550
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:11,260
Like an inner tube?

551
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:12,100
Like an inner tube.

552
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,020
And I'm like, why is there no fucking inner tubes

553
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:14,860
in this number?

554
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:16,140
They're singing about Tubin.

555
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:18,620
I took it as being a surf and feel like

556
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,620
if you're surfing in a pipe, you're Tubin.

557
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:22,660
Okay, yeah.

558
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:25,380
But Bob Bijan leaves it up for interpretation.

559
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:26,740
But I like that song.

560
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:29,900
That was one of my favorites of rediscovering these songs.

561
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:33,180
Why do we, what do we think about the songs in general?

562
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:35,300
Because we're now in a post-MacGruff world

563
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:38,380
and we have to measure things on a MacGruff scale.

564
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,740
Not as good as MacGruff.

565
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:40,860
Not as good as MacGruff.

566
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:42,660
I like coming out of their shells.

567
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:44,740
I like sing about it, Tubin.

568
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,780
And I like count on us.

569
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:48,140
I will add.

570
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:48,980
Walk straight.

571
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:49,820
Pizza power to that list.

572
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,140
I will add walk straight.

573
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,420
Mm-hmm.

574
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:53,260
I don't really remember walk straight.

575
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:55,100
I don't think I'm putting walk straight on my personal list.

576
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,220
And I like the Shredder song,

577
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:57,820
but that's a bigger piece of conversation.

578
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:58,780
Yes, that's a whole other.

579
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,420
The Shredder song left off the album.

580
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:01,260
Left off the album.

581
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,700
So for some, inexplicably, and we'll deal with it.

582
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:07,180
But of the Turtles' actual music,

583
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:11,620
of their 10 song LP, which they did put out an album.

584
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:12,460
Yes.

585
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:14,980
Is the number one, is it just coming out of our shells

586
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,620
or does it count on us?

587
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:19,300
I mean, maybe we'll determine by talking about it a little

588
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,460
and the listener will help.

589
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:23,580
I don't like Skipping Stones.

590
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:24,740
I certainly don't like Skipping Stones.

591
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:25,860
I don't like it.

592
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:27,740
Skipping Stones is ridiculous.

593
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:28,580
I wasn't crazy.

594
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:30,900
I'm glad April had a number, which is hers.

595
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,180
Oh, the April ballad.

596
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:33,020
It's called April ballad.

597
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:35,260
It's so lazy.

598
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:37,340
I was glad she had a number.

599
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:38,180
You know what I'll say?

600
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:41,380
I do like the splitter costume.

601
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:42,380
Looks great.

602
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:43,220
Yeah.

603
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:44,060
Mm-hmm.

604
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:46,460
But he uses the only one, the only mouse that moves.

605
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:47,300
Yeah.

606
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:50,900
Move just haphazardly and at an unpredictable rate

607
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:53,820
and not along with the audio.

608
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:55,660
I may have just never noticed it.

609
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:56,740
It was so haphazard.

610
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:59,820
I just view it as like they, it's like arbitrary flaps.

611
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:02,700
It certainly is not lip sync, which makes Splinter

612
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:05,980
all the more surprising when he does sing along.

613
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:06,820
I don't even.

614
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:07,660
So we start talking about Splinter

615
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:09,340
and I want to talk about that voice.

616
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:10,740
But where do we even start?

617
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:12,620
Let me finish one thought I have here.

618
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:14,780
There's too many things to talk about.

619
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:15,620
Too many things, too many things.

620
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:16,740
Too many things.

621
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:19,780
So in that making of, so what I was saying, 557,

622
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:21,620
and Scott you won't be able to see it,

623
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:23,860
but they're doing a whole like kind of mockumentary.

624
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,940
I have the clip, I'll start playing it right here.

625
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,580
And Jason will see what I'm talking about.

626
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:30,380
This is how haphazard putting all of this material

627
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:34,380
and making it the same and coordinating it was.

628
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:35,540
Jason, take a look and tell me

629
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:37,220
if you see anything strange here.

630
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:39,260
These are like, they are truly a band

631
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:40,260
in the best sense of the word.

632
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:43,100
Cause they're, you know, brothers and been together forever.

633
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,700
Do you know anything strange

634
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,820
about the four turtles playing here?

635
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:48,620
Can you go back?

636
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:50,660
Yeah, 557, one more time there.

637
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:54,220
I mean, they don't look like they give a shit.

638
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:55,060
I agree with that.

639
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:56,740
Do you know, just take a look at their headbands

640
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:58,100
for a second.

641
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:00,900
Wait a second, are there two Michelangelo's?

642
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:03,380
I, even in the final show,

643
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:05,940
they all, it seems like two Michelangelo's to me.

644
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:06,780
Yeah.

645
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,260
The orange and the red are not very different.

646
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:09,100
Yeah.

647
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:11,860
I mean, I think that, yeah, when you get closer maybe,

648
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:16,860
but this is like clearly red, purple, two Michelangelo's.

649
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:18,300
Yeah, yeah.

650
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,940
And this is where one of them just has like a drum.

651
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:22,780
Is that like a standing drum?

652
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:25,300
Cross level drum, cross level drum again.

653
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:28,860
It's like a conga, it's two conga drums and he's got sticks

654
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:30,500
and he's hitting the congas with sticks

655
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,740
is really what it seems like.

656
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:32,580
Oh no, it's just a light.

657
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:34,340
I thought there was a boom mic in the shot too.

658
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:36,500
It's behind the scenes so they could get away with it,

659
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,540
but that would still add to it.

660
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:41,460
So not, they're not being careful with costume details.

661
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:42,300
This is another thing.

662
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:45,180
This is the behind the backstage turtles.

663
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:48,180
So they have the bandanas,

664
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:50,700
but then they also have like these glittery stars.

665
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,380
The kiss style, yeah.

666
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:54,420
Yeah, why think they all know those?

667
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:57,460
Those are a little cool, but they'd already made the videos.

668
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:01,500
So there's parts of the show where in the middle of act two,

669
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,260
you're not sure where the turtles are.

670
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:05,420
They're somewhere in the bowels of the theater

671
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:06,540
planning their next move.

672
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:10,660
And then like they usurp a news camera

673
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:12,980
and use it to send a message to the audience.

674
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:16,380
We're still here, but it's the old turtles calling in.

675
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:19,700
The news guy, by the way, sucks.

676
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:22,100
Do you know who the news guy is?

677
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:22,940
What's his name?

678
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:23,760
I mean the character.

679
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,780
I'm sure I'm very curious to know who the actor is.

680
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:29,300
The actor is Dave Rubrecht,

681
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,420
the host of Supermarket Sweep.

682
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:32,260
Come on.

683
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:34,820
No idea until checking it this week.

684
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:37,460
No, I loved Supermarket Sweep as a kid.

685
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:38,540
I think he's great.

686
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:39,380
I think he's fun.

687
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:42,300
And not only that, I have other stuff too

688
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:46,620
that like what you were watching in that main VHS

689
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,300
that I ran in so many times as a kid,

690
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:52,060
that is a cut down of the pay-per-view event

691
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:54,500
that apparently took place the opening night

692
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:57,780
of this entire endeavor at Radio City Music Hall.

693
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:58,620
Yeah.

694
00:25:58,620 --> 00:25:59,460
The venerable venue.

695
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:01,940
The most famous in the world.

696
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:04,940
Yeah, it seemed like epic skiff, a comic plays that.

697
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:05,940
You're like, holy shit.

698
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,860
But then also remember the turtles played it

699
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:08,780
a long time ago.

700
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:13,340
But so that is an edited down version

701
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:15,100
of a pay-per-view event.

702
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:17,780
And the pay-per-view had to kill way more time.

703
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:19,420
They needed like an intermission length

704
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:21,740
to give all the guys in the suits a break.

705
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:24,020
So there is just minute upon minute

706
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:27,580
of improvised Dave Rubrecht interviewing kids.

707
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:28,420
So what do you think?

708
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:31,020
And the turtles are, I don't know, what do you do?

709
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,500
What do we do to stop them?

710
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:34,660
We probably fight them, fight them.

711
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,320
Okay, but remember Turtle said, don't fight.

712
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,160
We're not fighting today.

713
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,000
So what do we do?

714
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,960
And the kids have no ideas.

715
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,560
There is so much, there's like 10 minutes

716
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,720
of sweaty improv by this news anchor.

717
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,840
But God bless, hey, supermarket sweep,

718
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,680
one of my favorites these days still.

719
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,440
Very Regis-like to me.

720
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,280
Yeah.

721
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,120
Very Regis.

722
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:53,960
Regis who also interacted with the turtles.

723
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:54,880
Regis who also interacts.

724
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,120
That's a whole, we can do a whole episode

725
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,160
just on that too.

726
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,200
Let me go here.

727
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,900
This, I'll play a couple clips from the making of

728
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:03,000
to sort of get you into like kind of the logic

729
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:03,840
of the world a little bit.

730
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,880
Yeah, because we haven't even played any songs yet.

731
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,320
Yeah, so like, but they, because they, you know,

732
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:11,080
whatever the kayfabe version of this is,

733
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:13,440
the wrestling term for, you know.

734
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:17,560
So like this is Michelangelo and Raphael talking about it.

735
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:22,000
It all start, well it all started a long time ago

736
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,480
back in the pet shop.

737
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,800
Oh Mike, stop goofing around.

738
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,240
He wants to know about the music.

739
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,920
No duh, just chill out Raph.

740
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,760
See, okay, Raph and I were waiting for this pizza

741
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,120
to be delivered, see and.

742
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:39,320
Yeah, you know when I was just banging on some sewer pipes

743
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:43,600
when all of a sudden we realized we were making music.

744
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:47,560
Oh man, it was so bodacious.

745
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:51,120
Just stretching those syllables out as much as they can.

746
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,840
So the back stories that they accidentally

747
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,000
were making music.

748
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,540
Yes, and also the, I believe later they conflict

749
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:02,460
with the narrative of that splinter told them

750
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:04,720
to do the music as well because then they,

751
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:07,040
I think later on, say I don't have that clip pulled,

752
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,720
that's, I don't know why they do it.

753
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,440
So he's like, splinter, hopefully he was into the music,

754
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,280
but he was.

755
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:17,320
So like they contradict the idea that like splinter told us.

756
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:20,040
Well, no, I think it, I'm not sure that that idea is present.

757
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,960
I think they organically started playing music.

758
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:22,800
And then. Oh, I see what you're saying.

759
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,320
They were concerned that splinter would not approve

760
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,840
because he doesn't want them out in public.

761
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,800
Although remember he ultimately approved

762
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,320
of the ninja rap occurring.

763
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,160
Right.

764
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,560
He's ultimately, if something fun happened,

765
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,520
he can loosen up.

766
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,360
Right.

767
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:35,880
So he was totally on board.

768
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,520
Violence is not as good as music.

769
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,680
So he wanted to get that message spread.

770
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:44,280
And then there was, and then the next step was

771
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,560
Donatello had to build a bunch of instruments.

772
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,360
A very important thing is that Donatello

773
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,360
built the instruments.

774
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,200
They could not go buy a guitar.

775
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:57,480
He had to, he had to specifically craft

776
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,320
and scratch instruments.

777
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,240
I have him talking about it here.

778
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,080
Oh, okay.

779
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,320
Yeah. Cause I want to know.

780
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:06,520
This is my territory.

781
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,520
He's showing.

782
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,560
Gearhead Supreme.

783
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,680
I don't exactly know where it comes from,

784
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,880
but I'm just good at building things.

785
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,880
I guess I just love working with my hands.

786
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:20,680
I don't know.

787
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,480
I guess I love working with my hands.

788
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,080
They call me Gearhead Supreme.

789
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,720
I don't know where it comes from.

790
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,160
Cause you machine guy.

791
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,760
I don't know where it comes from.

792
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,440
It just sounds cool.

793
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,280
Cause it's an endless.

794
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:35,320
Tons of roadies and teamsters and stuff like on camera.

795
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:37,160
The other thing I read about the instruments

796
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:40,040
is that story-wise Donatello made them

797
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,640
so that they could continue playing music,

798
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,120
even if the turtle stopped playing.

799
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,880
Did anyone else come across that?

800
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,920
So they could walk away.

801
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,560
They could walk away from playing

802
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,160
and the songs would continue.

803
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,440
Because you're correct.

804
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,600
In a lot of the show, they just put down the guitars

805
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:59,400
or walk away from the drums, but the music doesn't stop.

806
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:03,880
The logic is in a Sunny Clip Space Angels-esque,

807
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:06,880
let's insert the logic of why you aren't seeing them.

808
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,440
We have to explain why the music keeps playing

809
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,800
and why maybe you keep hearing us sing,

810
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,960
even if our mouth isn't flapping.

811
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,080
Donatello built a machine for that.

812
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,920
So they've over justified five things

813
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,600
that children would never notice.

814
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,880
There's a whole thing here.

815
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:27,680
This whole clip just explains how they made their instruments.

816
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:30,760
So building their instruments, it was difficult.

817
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,120
They could have bought them.

818
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,640
Go to the store.

819
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:36,000
So he can do some amazing stuff on them.

820
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,760
And of course, they're all MIDI pickups on their set.

821
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:39,600
MIDI pickups.

822
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,440
One string bass.

823
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,520
One string bass for Leo.

824
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,840
It's great, just amazing sounds.

825
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,520
Why is that important to know?

826
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,360
I don't know.

827
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:48,240
And then the keyboards that Donatello plays

828
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,080
all have triple thickness keys.

829
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,200
At least he doesn't have to hit

830
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,280
four notes at the same time.

831
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,120
I mean, I love that.

832
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,600
Kind of a stand up kind of Timbali set

833
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,680
and the synth pad to trigger drum sounds.

834
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,960
They've not cut to who is speaking.

835
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,640
So Bob Bijon.

836
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,480
He's too ugly to be on camera.

837
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,640
I'm sure it's Bob Bijon.

838
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,480
It's Bob Bijon.

839
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,800
Be okay.

840
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,600
They missed something about what Donatello did,

841
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,680
which is that he in the show clarifies

842
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,760
that he built a shred scan into the synth.

843
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,600
Yes, yes.

844
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,600
So that they're aware if shredder ever shows up.

845
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,960
And the one time that this is deployed, it does not work.

846
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,240
So good fucking work, Donatello.

847
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,000
Yeah, he really screwed that up.

848
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,600
So the last thing, look, you look this up.

849
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,520
We'll post a link to it.

850
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,400
The last thing I'll show, I'll play from this

851
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,400
because we have to get to the songs,

852
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:39,400
is the sponsor of the show real quick, which so.

853
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,800
Pizza Hut.

854
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,680
So we said it already, it's Pizza Hut.

855
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,720
And then they do a whole,

856
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,200
they did like a whole press conference.

857
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,960
This is what's crazy too about this.

858
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:50,080
I feel like, I guess maybe they would do that

859
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,960
for like some sort of, I'm trying to think,

860
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,680
was there a Batman live press conference announcing

861
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,520
that it was going around the country?

862
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,680
It was 100%.

863
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,520
Yeah, absolutely.

864
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,760
I think there was a,

865
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,720
I think this was maybe a new type of thing.

866
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,840
I think there was like Disney on ice.

867
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,920
There was stuff like that, but to do concert venues.

868
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,760
Right.

869
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,600
Maybe they had to justify it more.

870
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,480
And they were making a push.

871
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,320
They put out an album, a real album with real musicians,

872
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,080
which I got some crazy stuff about that.

873
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:20,080
But like, because you're dealing with MCA executives.

874
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,000
And I think one of the executive producers

875
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,160
of this project was also Aerosmith's manager.

876
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,000
Oh yeah, I read that.

877
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:26,840
Yes.

878
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,040
And they see DC too.

879
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,400
So I think that maybe they were,

880
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,040
that's how they know how to do it.

881
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:32,960
We're doing a tour.

882
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:33,920
We need a sponsor.

883
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,400
We need a press conference.

884
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:39,240
We need them to play on the marquee of Radio City Music Hall

885
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,720
in a Beatles-esque fashion.

886
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,160
Yes, which they did.

887
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:45,840
That reminds me, in that article I found about

888
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,600
when they played Philadelphia,

889
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:51,600
as soon as this show ended, December 27th,

890
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:54,280
Disney on Ice started at the other giant venue

891
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,920
on the other side of town.

892
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:58,920
So whoever's booking these big shows was like coordinated.

893
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,240
It's like the smartest, like,

894
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,640
hey, you got kids home for Christmas break.

895
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,840
Here's a couple of things they can go to.

896
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,840
Here's how we rake in that cash.

897
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:07,680
Yeah.

898
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,520
Wow.

899
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,920
And then they make a point in the press conference

900
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:12,080
about what's going on in just concerts in general

901
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:12,920
these days.

902
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:13,760
So at Radio City,

903
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,360
and like any major rock and roll tour that takes place now,

904
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,960
you know, a lot of times you need to affiliate

905
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:18,800
with a sponsor.

906
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,720
And certainly we talked to the Turtles

907
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,360
about working with a sponsor for the tour,

908
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,320
but they wouldn't compromise.

909
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,520
They wouldn't sell out.

910
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,640
And that being said, he's about to announce

911
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:26,840
that they have a sponsor, which means they-

912
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:29,040
They would sell out, but also they did.

913
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:29,880
Yeah.

914
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:30,960
He landed on Pizza Hut Pizza.

915
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,080
We went to see them

916
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,840
because we thought it would be a natural fit.

917
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,320
And there was one guy at Pizza Hut

918
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:38,040
who really saw the vision and the potential of this band.

919
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,480
He heard their first demos

920
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,920
and knew that they could rock any house that they went to.

921
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,200
And that man is David Novak.

922
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,040
And we'd like to bring him on stage now.

923
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:44,880
David Novak.

924
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,120
T.C. Turtles loves David Novak.

925
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,280
Until they met David Novak.

926
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,960
David Novak of Pizza Hut, though,

927
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,760
is just like any great Disney executive

928
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,040
who gives a very stilted speech coming up here.

929
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:58,480
I'll ask you to see if we're doing anyone favors.

930
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,200
The world's most famous pizza eaters

931
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,560
to hook up with the number one pizza company in the world.

932
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:08,160
Pizza Hut will launch the most aggressive promotion

933
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:10,840
ever done in the record industry

934
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,080
to support the Turtles' new music,

935
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:16,360
which I'm sure all of America will love.

936
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:19,640
Will Raphael and Donatello have asked us

937
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:22,440
to wait a couple of weeks to provide all the details?

938
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,720
And we know you'll love the music

939
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,800
and we know America will love this thing.

940
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,520
They cut it in because this man is so boring.

941
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,480
They cut in Turtles walking in

942
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,360
and kids being distracted by the Turtles

943
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,960
because this speech is so boring.

944
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,160
Anything else?

945
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,840
There's no way it was happening at the same time,

946
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,520
but obviously whoever was editing the video was like,

947
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:42,720
oh my God. Like a less charismatic Dick Geppard.

948
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:43,560
Yeah, really?

949
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,800
They all have that same blank smile.

950
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,640
Yeah.

951
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:46,480
Something just occurred to me.

952
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,440
I know the name David Novak.

953
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,920
You know who David Novak is?

954
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:53,520
He went on as probably through the Pizza Hut ranks

955
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,880
to become the executive chairman of Yum Brands.

956
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:57,720
Oh my God.

957
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,560
So all of those.

958
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,400
Pepsi and what's in Yum Brands again?

959
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,560
Taco Bell, Doritos, Melon Dew.

960
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,520
KFC.

961
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,760
All of it is him.

962
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,600
Is Novak.

963
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,720
Is David Novak.

964
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:07,680
He's a hero.

965
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:11,080
I also, when I was writing,

966
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:14,080
when I was writing the pilot for my show, Moonbeam City,

967
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,720
I was like struggling.

968
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,880
I was missing that and the name doesn't seem right.

969
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:22,160
And my main character, I was in LA Live

970
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,960
and there was a sign for something

971
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:26,400
where this guy was speaking and I was like Novak.

972
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,280
That's good.

973
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,640
So the main character of my show,

974
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,920
Dazzle Novak came from David Novak.

975
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:31,760
Wow.

976
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,600
That's who it says.

977
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,440
Yeah.

978
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,840
The Pizza Hut man.

979
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,080
This boring pizza.

980
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:39,040
I might've seen that name when I was six

981
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,800
and absorbed it and had a fondness for it.

982
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,640
Wow.

983
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,480
Was Pizza Hut Yum Brands back then?

984
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,440
Cause it is yum.

985
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:46,480
It is now.

986
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,320
Yeah.

987
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,160
I'm not sure whether-

988
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:51,320
It's KFC Pizza Hut Taco Bell.

989
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,160
Wow.

990
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,000
Yeah.

991
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:53,840
He's the king of kings.

992
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,360
So he's been there forever

993
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,240
and he brokered a deal with the Ninja Turtles.

994
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,840
But that may also,

995
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,680
he could have been the one who got them away

996
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:04,080
from the pizza parlor to like the Pizza Hut Cafe

997
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,840
and then the Pizza Hut quick service.

998
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:06,680
You know what?

999
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:07,520
I hear what you're saying.

1000
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,760
Cause I am also upset about that.

1001
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,600
Yeah.

1002
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,440
Cause Pizza Hut, you and our home-

1003
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,280
Oh, sit down Pizza Hut.

1004
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,120
Sit down.

1005
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:12,960
That's an episode.

1006
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,080
Sit down Pizza Hut.

1007
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:14,920
Sit down Pizza Hut.

1008
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,520
Is a Patreon for sure.

1009
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,920
I can tell the harrowing story

1010
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,360
of when I tried to have my Eureka's Castle

1011
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:24,760
Batley puppet drink my drink and it spilled everywhere.

1012
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:25,600
Oh my God.

1013
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,440
And everyone was so mad and I'm still scarred.

1014
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,280
Wow.

1015
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:30,080
I had those fucking puppets.

1016
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:30,920
I think we had those.

1017
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:31,760
You remember those?

1018
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,600
Yeah.

1019
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,440
We had those fucking puppets as well.

1020
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,520
Fucking.

1021
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,360
Yeah.

1022
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,960
Did you have Pizza Buffet out here?

1023
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:37,800
I don't think so.

1024
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,640
Or did you?

1025
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,480
I don't remember which was which.

1026
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,880
Hell yeah.

1027
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,920
Jason and I had Pizza Buffet where we come from.

1028
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:44,720
Don't beat me up.

1029
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,600
My family got real tired of it real quick.

1030
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,440
But for me, I was like,

1031
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,800
this is an evening.

1032
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,480
I was gonna say your family was like,

1033
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,920
we'll spend eight hours here and eat two meals.

1034
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:54,840
I would.

1035
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,760
I mean, I remember the salad bar

1036
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,880
and there was still one or two in high school.

1037
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,920
And my friends and I would go for like lunch

1038
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,520
on like half days and stuff.

1039
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,840
I heard there was a Pizza Buffet still like maybe

1040
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,920
in Santa Monica up until a couple of years ago.

1041
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:07,960
On Beverly.

1042
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:08,800
Oh, was that on Beverly?

1043
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,320
I think like, yeah, that's what I heard of Koreatown.

1044
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,160
I dream of a Pizza Hut Buffet.

1045
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,080
What was in the buffet?

1046
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,080
Pizza.

1047
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:15,920
Salad.

1048
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,560
They would just come out and put pizza,

1049
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,640
a different kind of pizza.

1050
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,880
You just go up and get this thing.

1051
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,280
And it was crazy.

1052
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,120
Mm hmm.

1053
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,920
It was the greatest because pizza was always my favorite

1054
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:24,760
of the trash.

1055
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:27,760
It was like of the quality of the Shakey's or a Sizzler

1056
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,560
or a Cece's.

1057
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:30,680
Yeah, we were a pizza.

1058
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,120
The best restaurants.

1059
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,760
Well, I'll say this, as it went on,

1060
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,960
the Pizza Hut Buffet, they started to skimp a little

1061
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,720
because once they introduced the thin crust,

1062
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,600
they were bringing out a lot of those thin crust

1063
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:42,320
or hand toss and it's just not as good.

1064
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,160
You need the pan.

1065
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,000
You need the pan.

1066
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:44,840
You need that grease.

1067
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:45,680
That's why you go to Pizza Hut.

1068
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,520
You get the grease in the pan.

1069
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,360
Yeah, you get the grease.

1070
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,520
This is what, I mean, I think this was maybe

1071
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,480
the sellout nature.

1072
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,800
Obviously the turtles love pizza.

1073
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,720
That's the way into their heart,

1074
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,080
but they ended up with the pizza monolith

1075
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,800
instead of the mom and pop.

1076
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,680
And they shouldn't have turned against their instincts.

1077
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,480
Although the turtles as 16 year olds

1078
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,240
probably don't have a lot of opinions about corporations

1079
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,440
and conglomerates and monopolies.

1080
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,280
But they had to grow up fast.

1081
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,120
You know?

1082
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:08,960
Yeah, they're killing it.

1083
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:09,800
They're killing stars.

1084
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:10,640
They're killers.

1085
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,840
They're trained murderers.

1086
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:12,680
Yeah.

1087
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:16,000
Professional murderers slash rock stars.

1088
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,720
Teen murderers.

1089
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:22,080
Well, I mean, do we start talking about,

1090
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,600
I mean, we could also,

1091
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,160
there's the question that I have about

1092
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:29,800
who is in these suits doing all of this improv

1093
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:32,920
because there's the fairly famous fact

1094
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:37,480
of who played the turtles, not in the show,

1095
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:40,280
but in the, they would,

1096
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:42,120
the turtles are coming to Philadelphia

1097
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:45,720
the day before the B-team's rolling in.

1098
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,200
Although maybe they're not even the B-team

1099
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,200
because these are professional improvisers

1100
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,560
who will get you excited to come to the show.

1101
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,800
And among the four turtles,

1102
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:57,640
Ben Grant and Michael Ian Black.

1103
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,440
Two of the state.

1104
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:02,160
Two of the state still burgeoning at this time,

1105
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:05,720
fresh out of NYU and preparing to make their series,

1106
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:06,640
The State.

1107
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,040
And I read somewhere that when they had to present

1108
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:12,520
the news to the other 19, however many people were in that group,

1109
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:15,360
that a literal fist fight broke out

1110
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:18,160
because it was going to delay their progress.

1111
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,000
Yes.

1112
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,520
Like the state had a blow up

1113
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,680
because of this Ninja Turtles thing.

1114
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,640
That is what I've heard as well,

1115
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:24,800
that that was a big problem

1116
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,640
because all of a sudden it was like

1117
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:28,160
two of our members are gone for the summer

1118
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,440
or they'll fall or whatever.

1119
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,640
See, that's what happens when you have

1120
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,040
all Americans in your group

1121
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,440
because the stories about kids in the hall

1122
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,480
when a couple, two or three of them went to go work on SNL

1123
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,440
before the kids in the hall thing was like,

1124
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:43,000
yeah, and then Mark and Bruce went down

1125
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
and worked on SNL for a year.

1126
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,560
So we kind of had to put things on hold a little

1127
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:48,400
and that's it.

1128
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,240
It just stopped.

1129
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,080
It's just Canadian.

1130
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:50,920
Well, that's the end of that.

1131
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:51,760
I guess we'll just.

1132
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,080
It was a fun group we had there.

1133
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:53,920
Yeah.

1134
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:54,760
Oh, they came back.

1135
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,480
I guess we can do our own TV show.

1136
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,040
But the Americans fought.

1137
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:58,920
The Americans fought.

1138
00:39:58,920 --> 00:39:59,840
They fought and punched.

1139
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:02,600
If only Splinter had gotten to tell them.

1140
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,440
Punched.

1141
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,520
You really punch.

1142
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,480
Ken Marino, listen to me.

1143
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:12,840
Comedy is more powerful than violence.

1144
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:16,560
So that's, I mean, those are the main facts to know.

1145
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,800
But, you know, not them in the show.

1146
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:22,560
Maybe, I don't know, maybe some video or something.

1147
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:23,600
It's them.

1148
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:26,080
But other than that, I'm not sure who's in the costumes.

1149
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:28,400
I know who's singing on the album

1150
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,880
but that's a whole different thing.

1151
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:32,000
There's a lot of voices contributing

1152
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,800
to the tapestry of this show.

1153
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,200
But I think we should probably start talking

1154
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,320
about the show itself.

1155
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:44,080
So as established, the Turtles started making music.

1156
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:45,600
They're going out on tour.

1157
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:50,040
In the actual video, there's a lot of like generic people

1158
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:53,960
like hammering sets together and loading amps into trucks.

1159
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:57,800
But then they rise up and out of the stage.

1160
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,520
Not synced up.

1161
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,480
Very little is synced up in the show, though they're trying.

1162
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:06,440
But like dance moves are all a little off.

1163
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,840
Those rising platforms don't work great.

1164
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,920
But I love the sloppiness.

1165
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,240
I think it's wonderful.

1166
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,880
Yeah, it's interesting.

1167
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:18,240
Cause I think there's a big, it's a mashup of all styles

1168
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,240
of music at the time that are popular.

1169
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,000
I think maybe at a certain point they were like,

1170
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,640
well, this is like the new kids on the block Turtles.

1171
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,520
There's a couple of songs feel like that.

1172
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:29,360
And they do a little bit of like hinting at dance moves.

1173
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,800
But I have to imagine if that was ever the plan,

1174
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,480
they were like, we don't have time for this.

1175
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,760
And there's no way.

1176
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,320
To get these guys up to speed.

1177
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,040
Yeah, I just see it would be such a

1178
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,400
Choreography classes.

1179
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:42,240
Such another level of having to reform.

1180
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:45,200
Yeah, so if they just sort of dance and sort of fight,

1181
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,200
cause boy that section where they fight,

1182
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,120
you could, I'm being generous calling it fighting.

1183
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:54,200
Yeah, it's, it is very, yeah.

1184
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:56,280
When I would watch it on a video,

1185
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,400
I was definitely underwhelmed by it as a kid.

1186
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,400
I will say live, I thought it was real.

1187
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,600
I thought Shredder was real.

1188
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,320
And I was worried when he says he's gonna

1189
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,720
lock the doors to the theater.

1190
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:07,040
I thought that was real.

1191
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,240
And I was really scared.

1192
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,800
That worked on me, yeah.

1193
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,240
And then I think it was before,

1194
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:12,720
it was for sure before intermission.

1195
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,240
Cause then it was like, they called the intermission.

1196
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:17,080
And I was like, how, how are we getting out?

1197
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,680
I didn't shut or lock the doors.

1198
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,800
And yeah, this, cause this is a problem for me too.

1199
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,960
Cause we saw Peter Pan before that.

1200
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:27,160
And the pirates would stick their head out

1201
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:29,200
of the dressing room in the lobby.

1202
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,040
Oh.

1203
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:31,640
And oh shit, I was at the water fountain

1204
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:32,760
and there was a mirror next to it.

1205
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,160
And I looked over and there were pirates

1206
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,520
sticking their head out and it was real.

1207
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,320
I was like, oh shit, it's real.

1208
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:41,440
Did, is it just that we're all weirdos who we were the type

1209
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,680
of like softy kids who thought everything was real

1210
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,960
or do all kids think that and just they moved on

1211
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:48,240
and don't talk about it or they pretend,

1212
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,080
they pretend they weren't scared by everything.

1213
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:53,680
I think, I think there's a little bit of column A,

1214
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:54,720
a little bit of column B,

1215
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:57,880
but I think the ones who were really scared,

1216
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,920
definitely go into the arts.

1217
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:02,600
Go into entertainment.

1218
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:03,440
That's why we.

1219
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,840
All we know is scaredy cat kids because we all.

1220
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:06,680
Yeah, yeah.

1221
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:08,520
We're all like cuddling together.

1222
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:09,360
Yeah.

1223
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:11,000
In our little fields.

1224
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,760
Yeah, I don't know exactly what it is.

1225
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:16,720
I guess we were soft, I suppose you could say.

1226
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:19,400
I mean, I don't, yeah, I don't know.

1227
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:22,040
I'm trying to think like if my mom was definitely like,

1228
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:23,720
you know, this isn't real, don't worry about it.

1229
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:26,160
Like this is just a fun show or

1230
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:28,320
she wanted to maintain the illusion.

1231
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:30,040
We were just so swept up in illusions.

1232
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,880
We appreciated everything so much.

1233
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:32,720
Yes.

1234
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,040
That we wanted to make it dimensional.

1235
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:34,880
Yes.

1236
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,120
Mentally.

1237
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:38,720
Which if now, if you've never seen this tape

1238
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:42,920
and you watch it now and imagine people being scared by it.

1239
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:43,760
Oh my gosh.

1240
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:46,200
There's a moment in the moment that scared me the most.

1241
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,480
And it, this was a little revelation for me.

1242
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:51,160
I am the most scared when supermarket sweep host,

1243
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:55,600
Dave Rubreck during the, when shredder takes over,

1244
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:59,120
he uses his machine to silence Dave Rue

1245
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:00,440
to take his voice away.

1246
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:01,280
Okay.

1247
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:04,160
And he is kind of magically with no special effects

1248
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:07,080
indicating this slammed up against like a power grid

1249
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:07,920
or something.

1250
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:11,720
And he shakes and the lights flicker on and off.

1251
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:14,080
It goes like negative to not negative,

1252
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:16,000
like public access video effect.

1253
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,640
And I thought that was real.

1254
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:20,960
I was like, he is using some kind of psychic power

1255
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:22,640
to silence this man.

1256
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,440
I thought that was something that could happen.

1257
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:26,280
And I've talked before on the show

1258
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:27,600
about the other thing that scared me the most,

1259
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:29,840
which was Ernest goes to Splash Mountain

1260
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:32,520
in which there is a back and forth strobe effect.

1261
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:34,880
And then his hair switches between being regular

1262
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:37,200
and big and tall like the bride of Frankenstein.

1263
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:40,360
I guess I was scared of the idea of electrocutions

1264
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:43,440
as a child, no matter how comical the presentation.

1265
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,200
I think I was scared in like the Adams family,

1266
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:46,040
if that ever happened.

1267
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:48,440
They played with the chair and they flipped the lever.

1268
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:49,360
Well, all that stuff.

1269
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:51,520
Yeah, we saw the Adams family

1270
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,480
and I was traumatized a little bit by it too,

1271
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:56,280
which I honestly was also traumatized by Home Alone.

1272
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:57,920
Oh, electrocution and that.

1273
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:58,760
Electrocution and that.

1274
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:02,240
And I knew that that was bad for you.

1275
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,840
And there was images of violence.

1276
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:08,840
I loved that movie, but I would have to gear up

1277
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:10,560
for the final third.

1278
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:13,040
Like when it goes, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun,

1279
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:14,760
when it gets into that, I'm like, okay, get ready.

1280
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:16,400
You can do this, you can do this, Scott.

1281
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:19,320
It's what I do now when I'm going on a mild roller coaster.

1282
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:22,760
I feel like psyched up, like I was going into battle.

1283
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:24,160
You can't handle.

1284
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:25,440
Calling your accountant.

1285
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,240
You can get through this, you can get through.

1286
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:30,080
Why calling my accountant?

1287
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:31,800
Yeah, I was gonna say why the accountant?

1288
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:34,480
Oh, it's just that it carried over into your adult life.

1289
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,400
Oh sure, just every day to yeah, yeah, yeah.

1290
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,480
Hashtag adulting.

1291
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:39,280
Oh, okay.

1292
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:41,760
Please, I can't, don't let me get audited,

1293
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,040
don't let me get audited.

1294
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:46,840
It's the auditing today, it was electrocution then.

1295
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:48,040
Yeah.

1296
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:51,280
I think as a kid, I agree that I was scared by this stuff,

1297
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:54,960
but one thing as a kid I quickly fell out of favor with.

1298
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,120
Here comes the toughest one of the three of us

1299
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:58,120
when he was a kid.

1300
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:01,320
When they turn to the audience and say like, where is he?

1301
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:02,800
Have you seen him?

1302
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:05,760
Like the first couple times I remember as a kid going like,

1303
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:08,960
he's behind you, and then they do it for like a minute.

1304
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:12,440
So after the first few times I was like, I don't,

1305
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:16,040
this is fake, okay, you're not listening to us anyway.

1306
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:20,080
So I'm not playing along with this bullshit anymore.

1307
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:21,400
So that stressed you out.

1308
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:24,240
I was like, yeah, I just was, I was just like, come on.

1309
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:27,240
I think I bought it, because it happens in this,

1310
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:31,400
Shredder freezes everyone, then he makes his presence known

1311
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:33,080
and doesn't like slash their throats

1312
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:34,440
while they're frozen or anything,

1313
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:36,640
which would make a lot of sense.

1314
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:39,080
And then they unfreeze the turtles

1315
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:40,920
and then go back to the show and they're like,

1316
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:42,760
have you guys seen anything weird?

1317
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:44,360
And there's all these children's voices being like,

1318
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:45,680
Shredder was there!

1319
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:46,560
They're like, what?

1320
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:48,280
We can't hear you!

1321
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:51,200
And then it's like, it was frustrating for me at the time.

1322
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:54,280
I wasn't up on that tropiate, I guess.

1323
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:57,400
Why'd you ask us if you can't hear us from there?

1324
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:58,600
Seems like you've heard other,

1325
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:02,200
you heard when we all yelled pizza, you sure heard that.

1326
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:05,600
Yeah, it seems like they're trolling us for no reason.

1327
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:09,120
Yeah, this is, I think, a lot of why I love

1328
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:12,160
that kind of thing, that he's behind you

1329
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:15,840
and the hammy villain who sort of roasts the audience.

1330
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:19,040
So much that I love that is in theme park shows,

1331
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:21,400
but I love it more from this,

1332
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:22,920
from coming out of their shells.

1333
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:23,760
Yeah.

1334
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:26,160
We'll get to, I'd say let's do it a little chronologically,

1335
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:31,160
but the Shredder centerpiece in the middle is next level.

1336
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:35,480
I will say that Baxter Stockman is in this,

1337
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:40,280
which I appreciate as a side character for Ninja Turtles,

1338
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:43,440
but he is not Fly Baxter, which is my preferred version.

1339
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:44,280
Yeah, I agree.

1340
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:46,120
Baxter turns into the Fly later.

1341
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:46,960
Just a guy, yeah, yeah.

1342
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:47,800
Just the guy.

1343
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:49,440
He looks like the mad scientist

1344
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:54,160
in any Nickelodeon live show.

1345
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:57,040
I think it was the Paramount parks, yeah,

1346
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:01,560
where they had the slime-inators, it's off the charts.

1347
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:03,880
I like those guys, the tape on the glasses,

1348
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:06,480
and big teeth and crooked bow tie.

1349
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:09,320
Do we start listening to, let's start listening

1350
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:11,400
to some of these tunes, dude?

1351
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:13,440
Let's do the tunes.

1352
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:16,560
So there's two versions of the title song.

1353
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:19,280
There's the acoustic version, which is on the album,

1354
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:21,840
and then there's the version that's in the show,

1355
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:24,720
but on the album, and because it's the clearest,

1356
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:26,560
we'll play a little bit, and it's a real,

1357
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:29,240
let me zoom it up here,

1358
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:35,320
like extreme or air supply, some 80s-ish.

1359
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:38,040
Yeah, very much so.

1360
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:39,160
More than words.

1361
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:40,840
Yeah.

1362
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:41,680
Uh.

1363
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:44,680
I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a.

1364
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:47,120
I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a.

1365
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:48,920
This is again, this is the acoustic version, you know?

1366
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:50,800
This is the chilled out version.

1367
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:55,560
When this music inside of you,

1368
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:58,680
you know that someday it's got to come through.

1369
00:48:58,680 --> 00:48:59,800
This is like the unplugged,

1370
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:03,080
this is like the Clapton singing Lola,

1371
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:05,240
but it's just him and a guitar on a stool.

1372
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:07,080
Yeah.

1373
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:12,280
It's just fun, like.

1374
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:14,160
This is the beginning of the album.

1375
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:15,480
Yeah.

1376
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:18,680
It's, there are songs that are certainly more in the tone

1377
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:20,480
of what you think turtles are.

1378
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:21,320
Oh my God.

1379
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:25,520
I guess I can stop that.

1380
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:27,760
Yeah.

1381
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:33,680
It's, if they weren't singing about shell.

1382
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:38,000
How would, how is this about turtles?

1383
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,200
How is this reflected in any way?

1384
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:42,400
There are songs on the album.

1385
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:44,120
They go, oh, this makes a lot of sense.

1386
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:45,400
But this one,

1387
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:48,560
feeling wise,

1388
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:51,320
we just, he's just a guy.

1389
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:56,680
Is the silver is a wonderful sound.

1390
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:01,120
All right.

1391
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:02,200
Ease off, buddy.

1392
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:04,160
I get you can sing.

1393
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:07,240
He's a little bit too showy with that voice.

1394
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:07,480
Yeah.

1395
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:11,160
Why is it such a somber intro to the wind in the show?

1396
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:13,440
It's my favorite song.

1397
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:14,160
Yeah, it's good.

1398
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:15,800
I have a little energy.

1399
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:19,600
I think I have a little of a little clip if you want to pull it up.

1400
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:20,960
I just saw on your computers.

1401
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:21,240
Yeah.

1402
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:22,080
Is it one?

1403
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:23,280
It's six.

1404
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:23,680
Okay.

1405
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:25,400
It's six out of our shells.

1406
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:26,680
Okay.

1407
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:29,720
You can hear the there's a note in this.

1408
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:30,920
It's something else.

1409
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:32,680
A wonderful sound.

1410
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:33,560
So much better.

1411
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:35,600
The harmonies.

1412
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:37,920
Out of my shell.

1413
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:39,960
So much energy.

1414
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:41,960
Out of my shell.

1415
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:42,800
Here it comes.

1416
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:45,480
You know, we're coming out of our shell.

1417
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:47,520
Shoo shoo.

1418
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:48,600
Hey, live performing is hard.

1419
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:49,400
Is this pre-recorded?

1420
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:50,520
Is it pre-recorded?

1421
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:51,480
Yeah, I think so.

1422
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:52,240
Oh, yeah.

1423
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:55,120
At least every version I heard of it,

1424
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:56,200
it was the same.

1425
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:58,920
They sing it the same amount of shitty on Oprah.

1426
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:00,600
Oh, I think I got

1427
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:03,960
confused because I thought the vocals were live.

1428
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:04,320
I'm not sure.

1429
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:06,960
And everything else was pre-recorded because that

1430
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:08,240
that's really bad.

1431
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:09,240
It's very bad.

1432
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:11,040
And I chose.

1433
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:13,560
And if they're live in the costumes doing it,

1434
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:16,160
I forgive that because my goodness,

1435
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:18,400
having to do that in the costumes is crazy.

1436
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:19,200
A lot of work.

1437
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:19,800
Yes.

1438
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:23,360
But would you would you would you like to jump around

1439
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:25,400
and hear the other craziest musical moment in it?

1440
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:26,640
Actually, I'll save that here.

1441
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:27,960
Let's let's go in order.

1442
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:28,280
Okay.

1443
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:28,560
Yeah.

1444
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:29,200
Yeah.

1445
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:29,840
Coming out of our shells.

1446
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:31,200
I like this one.

1447
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:35,080
Anybody feel free to call it lyrical moments that you.

1448
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:35,600
Oh, yeah.

1449
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:35,760
Yeah.

1450
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:38,440
I like when they all go, wonderful sound.

1451
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:39,280
Yeah.

1452
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:41,360
And it's the thesis of the show.

1453
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:41,680
Right.

1454
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:44,000
Because it's like this is their coming out party, essentially.

1455
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:48,680
This is their this is the introducing themselves to the world as musicians.

1456
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:50,520
Now, this is the way.

1457
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:54,720
I think to do if you're prominent in another art form.

1458
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:55,280
Yeah.

1459
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:55,760
Yeah.

1460
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:57,240
That's the right word.

1461
00:51:57,240 --> 00:52:00,440
This is performed primarily by and this is just like, you know,

1462
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:04,120
I like always to talk about Beatles and which Beatles did which song.

1463
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:05,680
This is primarily a Rafael song.

1464
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:06,680
OK, OK.

1465
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:09,440
So that's sort of we got to keep in mind.

1466
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:12,560
So honestly, now that I'm thinking about it, the somber tone of the acoustic

1467
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:15,000
version is probably more what Rafael likes.

1468
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,600
Yeah, he's totally frankly, he's definitely the most torture.

1469
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:21,240
Yeah, the John, he's got kind of the the Terts.

1470
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:24,560
Yeah. So like, OK, yeah, Rafael, for sure.

1471
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:25,400
Yeah, I think it's easy.

1472
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:26,560
It's Leo is Paul.

1473
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:28,800
Raph is John.

1474
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:31,520
Don is George and Michelangelo's Ringo.

1475
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:33,720
The gearhead. Yeah.

1476
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:35,600
He's the quiet, but Don is tells quiet.

1477
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:37,520
He's like the quiet one.

1478
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:38,920
And George and yeah.

1479
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:40,760
And George does machines.

1480
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:42,400
George has machines.

1481
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,840
I was always Ringo is a party dude.

1482
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:47,000
I was always tinkering with machine.

1483
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:51,120
That's what he says. Ninja Beatles.

1484
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:52,560
Yeah, it's a good mashup.

1485
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:53,560
That is a good matchup.

1486
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:57,160
And that was we know, no, no, man, I don't do that anymore.

1487
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:03,000
Very familiar refrains of the no, no song you picked.

1488
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,640
Yeah, Ringo's no, no song.

1489
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:06,480
Really familiar to everyone listening.

1490
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:08,320
Sure. What's up next?

1491
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:11,040
I mean, on the album, it's a thing about it.

1492
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:12,120
Right. It's next.

1493
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:14,120
Also performed by Rafael.

1494
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:19,280
OK, which is, well, see, everything is a little bit inconsistent

1495
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,480
with the way they were.

1496
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:25,840
This audio quality, give us, but it's music. Really?

1497
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:28,720
Yeah, you can get a full good version of it on Apple Music.

1498
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:33,720
You can also find it on the Internet Archive, not as good quality.

1499
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:37,960
Yeah. So this is very much like

1500
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:41,200
this is feels very much of its time as well with a little more like.

1501
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:47,760
Those intros I open specifically.

1502
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:50,360
No drum has ever been more echoey than these terms.

1503
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:53,680
So that you feel it on top.

1504
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:58,200
It's kind of a thesis of this song. What's happening here?

1505
00:53:58,200 --> 00:53:59,320
Maybe it's awesome.

1506
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:00,680
And you know, you're on top.

1507
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:02,920
Feel like you're out of your shell. You're going to pop.

1508
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:03,800
Just sing about it.

1509
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:06,400
I mean, this is sort of just a good life advice song.

1510
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:11,800
There's there's not a ton of plot in the actual show.

1511
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:16,400
Well, the first half is essentially a concert. Yeah.

1512
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:21,080
At this point, for the first few songs, there's no threat.

1513
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:24,120
Of shredder, he's maybe referred to. Right.

1514
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:26,880
But we assume he's in jail,

1515
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:30,680
rotting, you would hope he's nowhere near here.

1516
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:33,240
We're dead in hell where he belongs.

1517
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:39,080
Poked and prodded by pitchforks,

1518
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:43,440
reliving his most painful childhood memory over and over again.

1519
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:46,360
I had a problem in this where it's like we're we're

1520
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:50,760
we're no longer living in secret because as a kid, I was like, well, I watch them.

1521
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:53,040
On TV every day.

1522
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:56,800
And also they have a movie, so it's not super secret.

1523
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:58,880
I have all these action figures.

1524
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:00,360
It's complicated to chart.

1525
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:02,520
This comes up in the Oprah appearance.

1526
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:04,560
There's a lot of sorting out the math.

1527
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:08,640
They present it as if they are the real turtles and a cartoon was based on them.

1528
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:13,160
But maybe it was not readily apparent that they were out in the world as well.

1529
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:15,440
And kids, there's a Q&A session.

1530
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:19,720
Oprah's going up to kids who like, but how can you be here?

1531
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:22,200
But you're but also then you're in the cartoon.

1532
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:24,760
Yeah. That nobody knows how to answer that.

1533
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:26,680
It's yeah, it's a fumbling.

1534
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:28,080
How did you feel like as a kid?

1535
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:31,800
So as much as I thought live, I was like, OK, this is real.

1536
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:33,960
I'm sure it's going to kill me.

1537
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:38,120
I did when I was watching the tapes, I was able to separate

1538
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:41,520
all of the different versions because as a kid, I would have

1539
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:43,480
and this is very, very common.

1540
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:46,320
You would have comics based on the thing you liked TV show

1541
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:48,600
and then a movie or maybe like toys as well.

1542
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:52,520
In my head, I was always like this comic is the real turtles.

1543
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:54,840
Everything else is sort of a different version of it.

1544
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:56,600
So that's how I would always classify it.

1545
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:58,440
But did you ever think about that as a kid?

1546
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:01,960
I thought the cartoon and the action figures were the canon.

1547
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:05,960
The movie I remember seeing the original movie at like

1548
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:12,240
friend or relatives house, but we only had Secret of the Ooze on VHS.

1549
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:13,880
And that was the sillier one.

1550
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:15,560
So I was like, OK, well, that's close.

1551
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:19,080
That's kind of close to the cartoon, kind of close to the action figures.

1552
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:22,560
Like with X-Men, when my friend Luke and I started watching the cartoon,

1553
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:24,800
I wasn't reading X-Men and then I started reading the X-Men comics.

1554
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:28,120
It was like, OK, what's really happening with the X-Men is the comic.

1555
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:32,080
And I like this cartoon a lot, but that's not that's like an adaptation of it.

1556
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:37,400
See, the comics were so impenetrable to me until like third or fourth grade.

1557
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:39,320
The cartoon was easier to swallow.

1558
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:42,680
But I just loved looking at the I would look at the art all of a lifelong day

1559
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:44,560
and kind of absorb this story. Right.

1560
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:45,280
But you know what I'm saying?

1561
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:47,680
Did you have that kind of classification in your head of like,

1562
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:50,640
this is the real story and then all this stuff is just fun stuff

1563
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:52,520
I like that are different versions?

1564
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:55,560
Yeah, kind of. I think with the X-Men, it started with the cartoon

1565
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:58,200
and then became the comics. Right. Yeah, that makes sense.

1566
00:56:58,240 --> 00:56:59,960
Coming out of their shells was real to me.

1567
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:01,600
The rest was all. Yes.

1568
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:06,480
You know, just like Star Wars is just a bunch of stuff happen in Rex's periphery.

1569
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:09,840
Right. I guess there's a war or something. Sure.

1570
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:12,720
Where are we going to?

1571
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,800
It's at least in the show.

1572
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:16,360
Oh, wait. Well, the album is different.

1573
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:19,040
I don't know if we're doing short or out.

1574
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:21,000
Well, we can go to the show.

1575
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:26,320
We end up at the the turtles start asking the audience, what is our

1576
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:28,880
what is it that gives us power?

1577
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:31,240
What is it? Pizza?

1578
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:35,480
Pizza. And then which their responses, they don't just say, yeah, they say,

1579
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:37,080
it gives us our strength.

1580
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:39,080
It gives us our strength, like

1581
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:42,200
keepers force. Yeah. Yeah, really.

1582
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:47,400
This is the time, too, where there's backup dancers flinging

1583
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:51,080
styrofoam pizzas into the audience and pizza uniforms.

1584
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:53,680
And we were close.

1585
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:57,000
We had good seats. We got seats through my dad somehow.

1586
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:59,520
I threw a friend of my father's.

1587
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:02,200
He was not there. My grandfather went with us who fell asleep

1588
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:06,320
a couple songs in perfect and was just dead asleep the whole time.

1589
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:11,320
And I stayed asleep during Follow Your Heart.

1590
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:14,760
How did he manage to believe it or not?

1591
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:17,080
He wasn't so engrossed in the show.

1592
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:20,120
But I remember this when the when the pizzas were being flown,

1593
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:23,840
they were styrofoam, like styrofoam, like soft material.

1594
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:25,360
What am I looking for?

1595
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:26,520
You know, I'm talking about foam.

1596
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:28,720
Oh, God, Jesus Christ.

1597
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:29,640
Foam. Yeah.

1598
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:31,480
So they were whipping foam pizza on the audience.

1599
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:35,200
And I wanted one of these pizzas so bad, I was not an aggressive kid.

1600
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:38,680
No, believe it or not.

1601
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:41,000
Believe it or not.

1602
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:44,520
And there were I remember there were kids just because there was a dog fight

1603
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:46,200
in the aisle for one of these.

1604
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:48,000
And I just was not assertive.

1605
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,200
It was a problem. My dad told me in soccer.

1606
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:54,360
It was a problem in a lot of different things is that I was I did not make.

1607
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:55,520
More brushstrokes.

1608
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:59,920
The portrait of Mike Carlson, unlike the portrait of Dorian Gray, doesn't age.

1609
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:03,320
But the portrait gets corny and more aggressive.

1610
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:07,840
And it looks like one of those like things painted on a car,

1611
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:12,040
on like a 50s car, the guy with the bugging eyes and reaching out.

1612
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:13,640
Yeah, like a rat thing.

1613
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:15,280
That's what the portrait of Mike is.

1614
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:17,160
Yeah. Well, you just age.

1615
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:18,200
Rat thing was cool.

1616
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:19,200
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

1617
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:21,240
The portrait gets cooler.

1618
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:24,000
It's a like fuzzy little mouse.

1619
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,200
And then it turns into rat.

1620
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:26,800
So I'm rambling. It's still a cartoon.

1621
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:30,880
But then in real life, you just get, you know, you're just got like

1622
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:34,480
more asexual and more square.

1623
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:36,840
And for the portrait school.

1624
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:38,520
Well, then you should not have picked rat thing

1625
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:40,480
because he's like one of the coolest, most sexual.

1626
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:42,760
That's what I'm saying. The portrait school.

1627
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:45,880
But as but as we know, comic Mike is the real Mike.

1628
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:49,400
And then this other Mike is just like it's part of the mythology.

1629
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:50,760
Mike is a different.

1630
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:52,480
I guess Mike kind of in the middle.

1631
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:53,760
It kind of goes both ways.

1632
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:55,440
He's just an adaptation of the regular one.

1633
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:57,520
He has Mike drink sprite for breakfast.

1634
00:59:57,520 --> 00:59:59,080
Hell, yeah.

1635
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:01,480
So pizza power. Pizza power.

1636
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:06,080
So a friend of mine who I'm now realizing was a big liar

1637
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:08,600
in elementary school, said he did go to the show,

1638
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:12,040
but then claimed that he got one of the foam pizzas.

1639
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:16,000
And now that I'm thinking about it, I don't think that might be.

1640
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:17,800
I should ask him. Produce it.

1641
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:20,480
I should ask him if that actually happened, because this is I think I've said

1642
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:21,440
this on the show before.

1643
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:24,040
He's one of the kids that would like tell me lies about stuff.

1644
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:26,960
And he told me that there was a naked Marvel comic

1645
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:31,560
where Stanley would sign like the boobs of the girls that he drew.

1646
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:34,360
And I was like, at the time, I even was like, to Stanley draw,

1647
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:36,600
which he doesn't know, really sketched.

1648
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,240
But he would lie about a lot of stuff.

1649
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:40,240
So I'm wondering now if he lied.

1650
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:43,520
That was like, I want to see the naked comic here.

1651
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:45,560
Like a couple of years later, he doesn't, though.

1652
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:47,000
He wouldn't have been doing the art.

1653
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:50,000
He I would not like to see Rogues breasts.

1654
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:52,280
That doesn't make any sense to me.

1655
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:53,680
It's a bit bawdy.

1656
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:58,240
Childlike is like, unless you have a Tijuana Bible, the unauthorized

1657
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:02,280
porno comics, I doubt that you sincerely have.

1658
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:06,280
I look, I did want to see the Marvel swimsuit edition. OK.

1659
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:08,120
Well, those are a whole thing.

1660
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:10,800
I was that is by the way, Scott, that is a real multiple.

1661
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:15,720
There's a couple of years in a row in the 90s where Marvel put out a pinup

1662
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:19,360
swimsuit edition of the comics of the women and the men.

1663
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:22,360
So like the sexy Punisher to be fair.

1664
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:24,320
Yeah. Men and women.

1665
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:29,200
But it's like Captain America with his big bulge and his Eric and Flag speedo.

1666
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:31,480
When are they going to start doing this with the movies?

1667
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:33,840
That's the way to go back and get more stories.

1668
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:35,360
Yeah. Redo them all.

1669
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:39,840
But like it's not porn, but it's like magic miked out.

1670
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:42,440
Yeah. You got to settle for things.

1671
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:46,480
They tasteful vanity fair spreads, unfortunately, with where they look

1672
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:47,920
kind of handsome. Yeah.

1673
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:51,960
A series of cards from the 1995 Fuller X-Men cards

1674
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:53,200
where they're all on the beach.

1675
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:56,040
The X-Men are all on the beach and you get hunky bishop.

1676
01:01:56,040 --> 01:01:59,600
You get hunky Cyclops and you get sexy storm.

1677
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:01,640
We're in that series.

1678
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:04,160
Oh, what was it? The Fleer Fleer?

1679
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:05,480
Just I don't know. You said it really fast.

1680
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:08,240
I thought you said fully a Rex man.

1681
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:10,840
I thought you were talking about some pornographic

1682
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:13,280
the fully Rex men.

1683
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:15,640
That's a good fleer was the name of the card company.

1684
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:18,160
Yeah, they were playful, though, like Wolverine.

1685
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:20,760
They were barbecuing hot dogs with his claws.

1686
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:23,000
He had like hot dogs on his claws.

1687
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,400
Playful like the comedy at a burlesque show.

1688
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:26,680
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

1689
01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:28,520
The one weird one, the X.

1690
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:30,560
The one weird one.

1691
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:32,760
Is that like Jubilee is dumping

1692
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:36,200
suntan lotion on Professor X's head.

1693
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:38,320
And if you really think about it, Jubilee is very young.

1694
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:39,760
And she should not be flirting.

1695
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:41,760
She's like 16 at best.

1696
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:43,840
With the professor in that way, though, that being said,

1697
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:47,040
there's a lot of storylines about professor, like fantasizing about

1698
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:49,760
Jean Grey, his young student.

1699
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:51,960
So there's all yeah, that's the whole thing.

1700
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:54,480
Brian Singer didn't bring the weirdness.

1701
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:57,840
No, no, but he was drawn to it because he's a.

1702
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:00,920
That explains because of his illness.

1703
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:04,600
So anyway, power power.

1704
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:06,920
I don't know what the I have.

1705
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:08,520
I don't have these lyrics in my head at all.

1706
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:11,120
And so the lizards and tadpoles.

1707
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:14,200
Yeah, I mean, I have all the I have all the lyrics right here.

1708
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:16,040
Let's hear it. We'll play it.

1709
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:18,280
Yeah. And then yeah, this is.

1710
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:27,880
Yeah, growing, it's the lyrics growing up in the glass

1711
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:30,160
full of millions lizards and tadpoles.

1712
01:03:32,080 --> 01:03:34,480
I need you tonight.

1713
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:40,680
The coolest guitar.

1714
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:50,120
There's something better than this.

1715
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:50,920
No.

1716
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:52,800
Let us sleep in the parent.

1717
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:54,840
Maybe you see from the.

1718
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:55,840
But it's.

1719
01:03:56,520 --> 01:03:58,640
That OK, so that lyric is

1720
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:03,880
lettuce leaf and a carrot, maybe a seed from a parrot.

1721
01:04:04,360 --> 01:04:08,680
Believe me when I tell you the world, the word gourmet just don't exist.

1722
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:10,720
So this is about them as little turtles.

1723
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:14,720
Yes. Before the mutation, they're just, you know, in a pet shop or whatever.

1724
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:19,280
And they are lucky if they get a lettuce leaf and a carrot or a seed from a parrot,

1725
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:21,280
which I'm confused by.

1726
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:27,000
So if my two cats came to life and became part human,

1727
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:30,960
which is a horrifying thought, and then started eating steaks or burgers.

1728
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,160
Your cats became swat cats.

1729
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:35,600
Oh, oh, that's fine. Sure.

1730
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:38,440
I like the sound of that.

1731
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:42,120
But maybe they'd sing a song about like we only ate kibbles.

1732
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:45,200
Yeah, they were bitch about what you were piece of cheese.

1733
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:47,120
Yeah. If Edwin, who was sitting on the couch here,

1734
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:50,280
he would be really mad at what I have not let him had to eat.

1735
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:51,560
They're going to murder us.

1736
01:04:51,560 --> 01:04:52,920
Yes. Mutation never happens.

1737
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:54,000
Well, they become a squat cats.

1738
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:58,240
They have the full force of the state behind the violence of the state.

1739
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:02,000
I better start giving my cats pizza now.

1740
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,560
It's an emergency.

1741
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:17,720
Oh, yeah, the lyric is a pizza power, a flying saucer food delight, which

1742
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:21,880
it's I guess flying saucer because it works in the show.

1743
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:24,440
They're like flying saucer shape.

1744
01:05:24,560 --> 01:05:26,160
I guess that's food.

1745
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:27,680
It's still not quite.

1746
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:32,480
No. And then it's the one I've described as my favorite.

1747
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:36,000
And yet I'm I've had my fill of pizza power.

1748
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,040
I think Walk Straight is still my favorite.

1749
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:40,120
Oh, sure. But I like pizza power.

1750
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:43,440
I think I also like pizza power because it makes the most sense.

1751
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:45,720
This is a turtle show. It's about pizza.

1752
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:48,120
There's an origin in it.

1753
01:05:48,120 --> 01:05:50,080
So like this is what you want.

1754
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:51,960
You want a song about pizza?

1755
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:56,040
Yeah, sure. And it's another audience because there's some

1756
01:05:56,640 --> 01:05:59,400
because some of that some of the songs are just like kind of about

1757
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:03,880
just like being being good and true to your friends.

1758
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:05,600
No treaties, particularly.

1759
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:08,160
I'm confused by. Yeah.

1760
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:09,440
What a title.

1761
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:11,480
It's very interesting to me.

1762
01:06:11,480 --> 01:06:13,680
Sounds like a mountain goat song.

1763
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:15,480
Yeah, really serious. Yes.

1764
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:16,800
Very serious song.

1765
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:18,240
So, yeah, pizza power.

1766
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:19,960
We can we can keep moving.

1767
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:23,360
You mentioned the good guitar and just to please.

1768
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:25,720
Yes. I mean, I have a couple of things about who played on the record,

1769
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:27,600
but let me just say I'll do it in pieces.

1770
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:31,440
I will say there's a couple of credited guitarists,

1771
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:35,880
including a guy named Phil Chanel, who wrote the song holding out for a hero.

1772
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,120
Oh, yeah. Footloose Bonnie Tyler song.

1773
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:43,000
But the four credit guitarist and one of them is a guy just named Space Man.

1774
01:06:43,360 --> 01:06:46,640
I clicked on his discogs,

1775
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:49,600
his full name, Space Man Patterson, very highly regarded,

1776
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:52,000
largely jazz guitarist.

1777
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:55,080
He was in Miles Davis's touring band before this.

1778
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:57,560
And then he's playing these turtle parts.

1779
01:06:57,880 --> 01:07:01,480
Went on to he's recently played with Frank Ocean a bunch.

1780
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:04,800
But the most interesting credit in this guy's discography,

1781
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:08,240
and I won't get off track for too long here, but he played on an album

1782
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:13,440
from 2009 called The Cosner, Roddy Presents State of Emergency.

1783
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:15,080
Does that ring a bell?

1784
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:16,120
No, what is that?

1785
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:19,960
Would you let's analyze that word cause in a row?

1786
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:22,240
I. Any familiar sounds in there?

1787
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:24,640
C.O.S. cause in a row.

1788
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:25,960
Oh, my God.

1789
01:07:25,960 --> 01:07:29,160
This was my God, a rap album.

1790
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:29,920
Oh, my God.

1791
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:31,520
Executive produced. Oh, no.

1792
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:34,040
Hey, hey, hey. Oh, no. Bill Cosby.

1793
01:07:34,040 --> 01:07:34,880
Oh, no.

1794
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:37,200
I'll be made a fool.

1795
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:39,360
He's credited as like the designer.

1796
01:07:39,360 --> 01:07:41,600
I think the I think it was like, well, it's the cause in a row.

1797
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:44,200
He presents. He made up like a Wu Tang

1798
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:49,200
Esk like organization name scarier than the foot clan.

1799
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:50,520
I'll tell you that much.

1800
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:52,600
Wow. The Cosner, Roddy.

1801
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:55,160
And so he doesn't play on it.

1802
01:07:55,160 --> 01:07:56,360
He doesn't sing on it.

1803
01:07:56,360 --> 01:07:58,400
He's just like he presented.

1804
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:00,120
He funded a rap album.

1805
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:01,200
My goodness.

1806
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:04,600
And would you and then Space Man, the turtles, one of the turtles,

1807
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:06,760
guitarists like playing most of the instruments on it.

1808
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:09,640
Would you like to take a wild guess as to what the Cosner,

1809
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:12,200
Roddy Presents State of Emergency mostly consisted of?

1810
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,760
Rap rap is a problem.

1811
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:20,640
Bill Cosby was always complaining about rap and how people wear their pants.

1812
01:08:21,160 --> 01:08:23,920
Well, he combines his two favorite things to complain about.

1813
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:27,200
He uses rap to tell black people to pull their pants up.

1814
01:08:27,320 --> 01:08:28,960
It is an album of scolding.

1815
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:29,720
Oh, my God.

1816
01:08:29,720 --> 01:08:30,960
Problems. Jesus.

1817
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:32,560
I heard of this shit.

1818
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:34,320
What a massive piece of shit.

1819
01:08:34,320 --> 01:08:35,880
I heard about this a long time ago on the A.V.

1820
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:41,720
Club's least essential albums of 2009, which is a feature there as I loved.

1821
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:42,800
But that one stuck with me.

1822
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:44,120
The Cosner, Roddy.

1823
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:45,640
She was off.

1824
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:48,760
You hate rap music, but you will use it to scold.

1825
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:52,080
Well, I got to go to hell, Bill Cosby.

1826
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:56,000
So anyway, there is shared personnel between the Cosner, Roddy

1827
01:08:56,840 --> 01:08:58,600
and the turtles. My goodness.

1828
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:00,680
Let's get back into more pleasant things.

1829
01:09:00,680 --> 01:09:02,640
I just could not. You can't.

1830
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:05,520
I was in a no second gate episode of the Cosner.

1831
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:07,120
You will not.

1832
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:08,680
We say, you know, it would be fun.

1833
01:09:08,680 --> 01:09:09,720
Not in this case.

1834
01:09:09,720 --> 01:09:11,680
That's the end of the Cosner, Roddy on this show.

1835
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:13,760
That being said, like, let's cut to three years down the line.

1836
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:15,320
And we're like, what do we got here?

1837
01:09:15,320 --> 01:09:17,400
Oh, you know, the episode.

1838
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:18,880
Roddy. All right.

1839
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:22,880
It'll be all Bill Cosby's music will be fed out and then the Cosner, Roddy.

1840
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:25,160
Yeah. Well, what's now?

1841
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:26,720
Or are we maybe we do?

1842
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:28,600
Do you want to talk about Walk Straight?

1843
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:31,240
Yeah. Yeah. What's the you have the order in front of you or the actual show?

1844
01:09:31,240 --> 01:09:33,680
The more is different than I mean, the next in my list.

1845
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:36,800
Well, the next in my list is skipping stones.

1846
01:09:37,320 --> 01:09:38,480
Yeah. I'm ready to talk.

1847
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:39,760
Skip. I'm ready to talk.

1848
01:09:39,760 --> 01:09:42,640
As a kid, like you're saying, I hated skipping stones.

1849
01:09:42,840 --> 01:09:44,720
I fast forward as well.

1850
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:45,640
I was fast forwarded.

1851
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:47,680
The reason and let me start playing it while I talk.

1852
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:50,000
The splinters song.

1853
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
Oh, an important thing before you start playing.

1854
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:57,240
Splinter comes out and talks and he talks about the power of the ninja

1855
01:09:57,240 --> 01:10:02,280
and communicating with your fellow warriors and the spirit of he talks like that.

1856
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:04,120
And then the singing begins.

1857
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:05,720
Yes. The singing is different.

1858
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:06,400
It's very different.

1859
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:08,640
And also the video they play during the concert.

1860
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:12,200
It's another situation where it's a different splinter costume.

1861
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:14,240
Yeah, it's much different.

1862
01:10:14,240 --> 01:10:17,240
And he's it's song about skipping stones and he skipped stones.

1863
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:20,880
And he's like with a child and he's by like he's in Central Park or something.

1864
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:22,600
It looks like they just took a camera crew.

1865
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:23,760
Maybe it's not Central Park.

1866
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:26,440
There's a camera crew out and just like we got five that we got.

1867
01:10:26,440 --> 01:10:29,000
But we got. Hey, kid, you want to be in a video with master splinter?

1868
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:31,640
And if I was a kid, I'd be like, yes, please.

1869
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:32,680
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

1870
01:10:32,680 --> 01:10:35,960
But it's very like it's like tinted blue and shaky shots

1871
01:10:35,960 --> 01:10:38,840
from across the street of like a poor guy in the street. Yeah.

1872
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:42,400
Very like when all the artists did their like issue songs.

1873
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:44,240
That's what we're looking at here.

1874
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:48,880
So let me keep I'll start playing and keep talking because it's got a long intro.

1875
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:53,880
Yeah, but as a kid, fast forward right right away.

1876
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:56,360
Are you slow because it was slow?

1877
01:10:56,360 --> 01:10:58,240
I would skip skipping stones.

1878
01:10:58,240 --> 01:10:59,880
Slow songs were just automatically boring.

1879
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:02,480
Yes. Yeah, sure. Like part of our world, but not.

1880
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:04,200
Yes, I like party.

1881
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:07,560
But even that when I wasn't so into until I was a little older.

1882
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:12,080
Now, the reason I don't hate this still

1883
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:15,680
is that he sounds a little bit like he's doing a Springsteen voice.

1884
01:11:15,680 --> 01:11:16,480
Certainly, yes.

1885
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:18,800
And it sounds like this could be a tunnel of love or something.

1886
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:24,640
If you imagine Bruce singing this right here, let's just imagine Bruce.

1887
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:30,560
Close your eyes and think of.

1888
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:34,960
Like imagine Springsteen on Broadway.

1889
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:38,560
And flat inside my head.

1890
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:43,040
I was at the river the other day, but it needs some quiet right now.

1891
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:46,280
Right.

1892
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:48,960
Set free.

1893
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:50,600
I'm standing.

1894
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:52,840
Keep on.

1895
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:55,640
Skipping stones.

1896
01:11:55,640 --> 01:11:58,640
That's what I. Yeah.

1897
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:00,960
Can't see nothing in front of me.

1898
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:02,520
Let's just hear it.

1899
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:04,640
Skipping stones.

1900
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:07,720
Now, that sounds like Axl Rose, that delivery. Oh, sure.

1901
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:09,880
That sounds like November rain.

1902
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:12,240
Yeah. So the verse.

1903
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:18,040
It's that.

1904
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:22,760
This is now he's more in Axl mode.

1905
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:23,320
That kind of way.

1906
01:12:23,320 --> 01:12:25,320
What's that sound? Is it a guitar?

1907
01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:26,280
Is it a.

1908
01:12:26,280 --> 01:12:27,080
Moving on.

1909
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:28,040
Is it a. That's a sin.

1910
01:12:28,040 --> 01:12:28,920
On the fritz.

1911
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:31,760
That's guitar.

1912
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:33,720
Yeah, those are guitars.

1913
01:12:33,720 --> 01:12:35,680
The cause and a right again.

1914
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:39,200
Such a.

1915
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:42,840
This could be at the end of the river.

1916
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:45,680
This could be the big song at the end of the river.

1917
01:12:45,720 --> 01:12:49,160
And it's like, if you had to perform Streets of Philadelphia

1918
01:12:49,160 --> 01:12:51,480
after having been hit in the head with.

1919
01:12:58,480 --> 01:12:59,160
He could.

1920
01:12:59,160 --> 01:13:01,240
I believe those Springsteen did that.

1921
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:02,800
You mean pretty good.

1922
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:03,720
It's pretty good.

1923
01:13:03,720 --> 01:13:05,800
The song itself is not really a problem.

1924
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:09,520
But this if you actually if you pull up my file of skipping stone.

1925
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:11,640
Yeah, and I will. That's the official file.

1926
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:14,720
Kind of jump to the

1927
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:16,560
kind of the worst that it gets.

1928
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:17,240
Here we go.

1929
01:13:17,240 --> 01:13:21,640
Back into that giant pain like see.

1930
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:25,720
When he sings me here.

1931
01:13:25,720 --> 01:13:30,160
Things would fall from a small flat rock in me.

1932
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:33,720
Three. Yeah.

1933
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:35,800
Making a meal of it.

1934
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:37,720
Skipping stone.

1935
01:13:37,720 --> 01:13:40,040
That's the totally imitating Axl Rose there.

1936
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:45,800
Oh, skipping stone.

1937
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:48,360
Here comes the peak.

1938
01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:52,400
Water surrounds the way he thinks there's something real mantra about water

1939
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:53,800
surrounds me.

1940
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:57,160
But the time for rings is past.

1941
01:13:57,160 --> 01:13:58,280
OK, here we go.

1942
01:14:02,280 --> 01:14:03,360
She's.

1943
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:08,280
How is that justifiable?

1944
01:14:08,280 --> 01:14:10,640
Who they didn't ask for another cake.

1945
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:19,160
And by that point, there's been a spoken word interlude

1946
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:22,920
where he reminds you again that his speaking voice is because the power is in.

1947
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:25,360
Why couldn't you have sung it like that?

1948
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:28,760
Why did it have to be a radically different voice?

1949
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:33,360
Because, yeah, a lot of the turtles are, I think all of them have like

1950
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:37,440
singing voices and regular voices, but this one is maybe the most dramatic

1951
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:39,160
where you would be like, huh?

1952
01:14:39,160 --> 01:14:41,880
It's not two people who never met. Yeah.

1953
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:46,240
Also, the speaking splinter sounds very at peace.

1954
01:14:46,280 --> 01:14:50,880
And the yeah, the other one sounds like he's like having an operation done.

1955
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:54,480
November rain is like, if.

1956
01:14:54,720 --> 01:14:55,320
Yeah.

1957
01:14:56,840 --> 01:15:00,760
So this one's unjustifiable a little bit.

1958
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:02,800
I mean, but I enjoy it a lot.

1959
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:05,560
And imagine that this is the one the most articulated puppet.

1960
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,160
He's yeah, he's blinking.

1961
01:15:08,160 --> 01:15:09,800
He's his mouth is moving.

1962
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:12,120
I think this is a character even splinter.

1963
01:15:12,120 --> 01:15:13,960
I like so much more now as a kid.

1964
01:15:13,960 --> 01:15:15,440
You're like, he's the dad.

1965
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:17,600
He has to like, get out of your old man.

1966
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:18,640
Let the kids play.

1967
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:20,160
He's always getting his ass kicked.

1968
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:23,640
One guy from a big splinter guy now.

1969
01:15:23,640 --> 01:15:27,640
And I do. I think this I think I may like this song more than other songs

1970
01:15:27,640 --> 01:15:30,080
on the album just because of it being so interesting.

1971
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:33,240
You're like you like dad rock now because I'm a dad rocker.

1972
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:37,000
I have to say, I think they spent all the money on the splinter costume

1973
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,480
and had none left for shredder.

1974
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:44,480
Well, Shredder is just not even in cartoon.

1975
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:47,480
It feels very Halloween store.

1976
01:15:47,480 --> 01:15:49,320
Samurai. Yeah.

1977
01:15:49,320 --> 01:15:51,200
I mean, there's other songs.

1978
01:15:51,200 --> 01:15:53,760
Well, I guess Walk Straight and Tube.

1979
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:56,360
Yeah, I mean, we don't have to spend a ton of time in all of them.

1980
01:15:56,360 --> 01:15:58,880
I have not much to say about to been other than that.

1981
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:01,560
There's well, it's your crocodiles in it.

1982
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:03,960
Yeah, it's obviously a nod to your favorite band.

1983
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:07,480
It is. And it was nice to hear some 90s beach boy ask.

1984
01:16:07,640 --> 01:16:11,080
I think is like you said, like, you know, like

1985
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:14,680
Simpsons just fit next to Ninja Turtles for you.

1986
01:16:14,680 --> 01:16:18,240
My childhood interests were all included, the Simpsons and the Beach Boys.

1987
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:20,840
They were and the Ninja Turtles, they're all the same to me.

1988
01:16:20,840 --> 01:16:25,080
The song to been is exactly like the 90s Beach Boy album Summer in Paradise,

1989
01:16:26,360 --> 01:16:29,200
which was supposed to have a rap from Bart Simpson on it

1990
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:34,240
and was the first major label album made on Pro Tools.

1991
01:16:34,240 --> 01:16:37,040
So it sounds it is not held up super well.

1992
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:41,440
So both. So it's surf music that is very tinny.

1993
01:16:42,360 --> 01:16:45,280
Very the Turtles and Beach Boys both had it going on.

1994
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:47,840
Yeah, we'll give a little tube in here.

1995
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:48,840
Let's go to.

1996
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:54,840
But that's another what instrument is that?

1997
01:16:54,840 --> 01:16:56,480
Look at that is a keyboard.

1998
01:16:56,480 --> 01:17:00,920
I think that's like that seems like a Mario music maker guitar.

1999
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:04,720
Perhaps it's a sin or a mini like patch that they were talking about.

2000
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:07,440
Yeah, patch MIDI ready.

2001
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,360
To one of the surf and subterranean.

2002
01:17:13,640 --> 01:17:15,840
Yeah. So it's not about inner tube and Jason.

2003
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:18,240
One of my least favorite songs to and I think on the album.

2004
01:17:18,240 --> 01:17:19,760
Really? Yeah.

2005
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:23,840
See, I'm not any more fond of it because it's moving through the sewers

2006
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:25,760
like a pastime.

2007
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:27,800
I mean, unless you call that surface of training.

2008
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:34,400
Surf, surf, surf, surf, surf and.

2009
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:38,800
No, I don't care for this.

2010
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:40,120
Yeah, it's it's OK.

2011
01:17:40,120 --> 01:17:42,480
I think it's fun. It's I.

2012
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:45,160
I am your favorite.

2013
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:48,600
It's up there. I think, you know, I like the first three songs on the album.

2014
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:52,800
And that tends to be I I have a history of like with albums

2015
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:54,360
liking the first three.

2016
01:17:54,360 --> 01:17:57,240
I remember me in high school, like the first three tracks on White Blood

2017
01:17:57,240 --> 01:18:00,240
Cells, the White Stripes album being like, this is great.

2018
01:18:00,280 --> 01:18:02,160
Are you sure it's not just an attention span thing?

2019
01:18:02,440 --> 01:18:03,800
Partly an attention span thing.

2020
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:06,520
Yeah, no, that's that's definitely they start to drift.

2021
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,480
What's the April ballad of White Blood Cells?

2022
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:12,120
Where's the skipable?

2023
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:13,280
Well, do you know? I don't know.

2024
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:15,120
You go like, we're going to be friends.

2025
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:16,840
And you like, do you like that?

2026
01:18:16,840 --> 01:18:18,880
Boring boo. That's for dads.

2027
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:22,320
I like we can be friends. Yeah, we are going to be friends.

2028
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:24,920
It's like the theme to Conan's podcast. I.

2029
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:28,400
Those are similar. Well, Jack, yeah, it is.

2030
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:30,600
It is what he's using that as his podcast.

2031
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:33,160
Right. Yeah, being friends is

2032
01:18:33,160 --> 01:18:37,360
I think on the next album on Elephant, it's the well, it's true that we love

2033
01:18:37,360 --> 01:18:39,400
one another, right?

2034
01:18:39,400 --> 01:18:41,840
I love Jack White like little brother.

2035
01:18:41,960 --> 01:18:44,160
I like that song. Yeah.

2036
01:18:44,160 --> 01:18:45,600
I think at the time I skipped it.

2037
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:50,360
Now I like what are the all of the analogs between the white strips

2038
01:18:50,360 --> 01:18:52,400
and the in the turn of Charles.

2039
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:54,240
All right. I guess we go to walk straight.

2040
01:18:54,240 --> 01:18:58,440
Sure. Which I enjoy a lot more, I think, even than I liked as a kid,

2041
01:18:58,440 --> 01:19:03,440
because I don't think I don't think I understood grooves as a child.

2042
01:19:07,200 --> 01:19:09,320
You didn't understand great grooves like this.

2043
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:15,280
Now we're up.

2044
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:18,080
The verse is good.

2045
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:22,680
It's a great back when we were coming out of my shell.

2046
01:19:22,720 --> 01:19:25,280
Is this the most hip hop influence song on the album?

2047
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:27,680
I think it is the hip hop. Yeah.

2048
01:19:27,680 --> 01:19:30,760
It's somewhere between hanging tough and my prerogative.

2049
01:19:31,080 --> 01:19:33,400
Yeah, that's very much right.

2050
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:35,840
The walk straight is actually the worst part of the song, I feel.

2051
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:38,640
Yeah, that's kind of boring.

2052
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:40,040
This is great.

2053
01:19:40,040 --> 01:19:43,160
And that kind of takes a little bit to go back in the verse.

2054
01:19:43,160 --> 01:19:43,960
Sorry.

2055
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:49,160
What is this song about?

2056
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:53,680
I think it's about not doing drugs.

2057
01:19:53,680 --> 01:19:54,800
I think so.

2058
01:19:56,600 --> 01:19:59,600
Growing up in the 90s, I really thought that like

2059
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:03,560
around every corner was a child doing hard drugs.

2060
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:06,520
Yeah. Men with trench coats will be everywhere.

2061
01:20:06,640 --> 01:20:08,120
You'll know they're bad.

2062
01:20:08,120 --> 01:20:08,840
Yeah.

2063
01:20:09,720 --> 01:20:11,920
So this part, I like this part again.

2064
01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:13,960
Yeah.

2065
01:20:15,680 --> 01:20:17,680
It's a better like hip hop song than

2066
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:21,680
where they introduce themselves, which is what cowabunga.

2067
01:20:21,880 --> 01:20:24,120
OK, do I have an appreciation for that as well?

2068
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:25,400
No, of course.

2069
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:27,040
These look these are all great.

2070
01:20:27,040 --> 01:20:28,200
Walk straight. Good.

2071
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:29,200
I think it's good.

2072
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:31,920
I don't I'm confused that don't mutate.

2073
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:36,120
Yeah, I never got to mutate, but they mutate.

2074
01:20:36,160 --> 01:20:38,640
Right. That's the that's the problem is that they

2075
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:41,400
mutated and it turned out good for them, honestly.

2076
01:20:41,400 --> 01:20:42,200
So yeah.

2077
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:43,600
So maybe I should do drugs as well.

2078
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:45,360
So, yeah, it's a very confusing message.

2079
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:48,640
And they're using mutate, I think, to like, you know, when your brain changes,

2080
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:50,680
its brain chemistry changes doing drugs.

2081
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:53,560
I assume that's what they mean.

2082
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:55,320
Yeah. Talk straight, be straight.

2083
01:20:55,320 --> 01:20:59,400
And I assume they mean, of course, not on drugs, not heterosexual.

2084
01:20:59,960 --> 01:21:04,160
I assume it was who knows then who knows what secret

2085
01:21:04,160 --> 01:21:05,720
money was trying to get out.

2086
01:21:05,720 --> 01:21:08,120
Yeah. What the government pay, you know, will pay you five hundred

2087
01:21:08,120 --> 01:21:11,200
thousand dollars if you put in a heterosexual message into the show.

2088
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:14,720
We're getting a lot of kids into a theater and we need to set them right.

2089
01:21:14,840 --> 01:21:17,200
We need to make sure we need to fix.

2090
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:19,880
You may be you may not be green and have a cool shell,

2091
01:21:20,200 --> 01:21:23,280
but you'll be you and you'll do it so well.

2092
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:26,520
It's also, I think, maybe just saying like, don't give it to peer pressure.

2093
01:21:26,520 --> 01:21:29,000
Yeah, be yourself. That's a nice message.

2094
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,200
Too much of yourself, you little freaks.

2095
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:34,600
You'll end up going into the arts like weirdos.

2096
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:38,080
I guess maybe what they mean by mutate is like you're going to change

2097
01:21:38,440 --> 01:21:43,480
to be something you're not to to to try to be in a different group

2098
01:21:43,480 --> 01:21:45,440
of friends you think are cooler or something.

2099
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:49,440
You know, in the genre of songs that are about like, don't do bad stuff.

2100
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:52,720
This could be this is less embarrassing than other versions of that.

2101
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:54,200
Again, I have to say I'm great.

2102
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:56,080
I'm grading on the McGruff curve at this point.

2103
01:21:56,080 --> 01:21:57,600
Well, the problem is that's impossible.

2104
01:21:57,600 --> 01:22:00,520
Three months ago, it's a whole other ballgame.

2105
01:22:00,680 --> 01:22:02,960
The McGruff curve is insane.

2106
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:06,400
Yeah, that's like that's like grading this against the after the gold rush

2107
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:09,760
by Neil Young or something that like this is a that's a classic album.

2108
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:13,200
This is obviously that got some fun stuff and kitschy factor.

2109
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:14,680
But McGruff is legit good.

2110
01:22:14,680 --> 01:22:16,480
It's more about the experience with McGruff.

2111
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:18,080
McGruff is a purely good album.

2112
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:20,320
This is an interesting package. Yes.

2113
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:23,320
And to that end, maybe now it's time to talk about

2114
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:28,320
what really sets this apart in my book, because I forgot something

2115
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:31,560
in the narrative towards the end of Skipping Stones, that video

2116
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:34,160
where Splinter is meditating with New York children

2117
01:22:34,440 --> 01:22:36,400
starts to skip and interrupt.

2118
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:38,040
And who should interrupt the feed?

2119
01:22:38,040 --> 01:22:41,960
But Shredder Shredder is not only a video presence, he's in the theater.

2120
01:22:42,240 --> 01:22:45,160
He also at some point in Act one freezes them

2121
01:22:45,440 --> 01:22:47,560
and they don't know what happens.

2122
01:22:47,560 --> 01:22:50,200
It's not being picked up on the shred scan.

2123
01:22:50,200 --> 01:22:52,160
As we said, what happened?

2124
01:22:52,160 --> 01:22:57,360
Shredder. But after Walk Straight, the Foot Clan invades.

2125
01:22:57,800 --> 01:23:00,200
And as I said, this is not a stunt show.

2126
01:23:00,440 --> 01:23:03,560
So there is a lot of very distant punching and kicking.

2127
01:23:04,240 --> 01:23:07,000
A lot of flashing lights meant to distract from the fact

2128
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,600
that there is no choreographed fighting going on.

2129
01:23:10,280 --> 01:23:12,520
There's a lot of quips. There's something about there's

2130
01:23:13,160 --> 01:23:16,040
there's one. This is one thing Bo don't know.

2131
01:23:16,840 --> 01:23:18,600
So that's for Mundy. Yeah.

2132
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:20,760
And then he says, get it, Bo.

2133
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:23,320
What? Yeah. Yes.

2134
01:23:23,320 --> 01:23:25,320
What do you why would that help me get it?

2135
01:23:25,320 --> 01:23:27,480
Does he mean that it's a reference also to his weapon?

2136
01:23:28,480 --> 01:23:31,040
A bow because Jonathan is a bow staff.

2137
01:23:31,240 --> 01:23:33,480
Oh, so that must be what it is.

2138
01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:35,000
Well, this is not accomplished.

2139
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:36,440
The jokes are so still.

2140
01:23:36,440 --> 01:23:39,240
There's a weird running Barry Manilow joke.

2141
01:23:39,880 --> 01:23:42,680
There's an Elvis thing, which is again every time

2142
01:23:43,160 --> 01:23:47,600
Elvis and kids entertain in the 1990s, Elvis was 40 plus years old.

2143
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:49,800
Like who could not get it?

2144
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:52,720
Yeah. Well, there's still Elvis in Vegas.

2145
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:54,920
When is that show going to die? Never.

2146
01:23:54,920 --> 01:23:58,640
Like how many Elvis and Persons are doing like for whatever reason.

2147
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:02,560
That's still is cultural impact is still being felt.

2148
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:05,040
There's a reference in this section in the show where,

2149
01:24:06,080 --> 01:24:08,080
you know, here I don't I don't even want to get ahead of myself.

2150
01:24:08,120 --> 01:24:11,000
Let's let's let me stay on track.

2151
01:24:11,360 --> 01:24:14,880
Fighting happens, but the turtles are overtaken for some reason

2152
01:24:15,080 --> 01:24:16,480
because there is a loud machine.

2153
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:20,560
Shredder has shown up and revealed that he got into the theater.

2154
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:25,120
Lacks security because he showed up with a stage filling machine

2155
01:24:25,320 --> 01:24:27,960
called the D harmonic Convergence Controller.

2156
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:31,200
Holy shit. This thing is terrifying.

2157
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:34,800
However, it also involves like a trash can and a tube

2158
01:24:35,120 --> 01:24:37,760
where you put music in and then it spits it out as confetti.

2159
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:41,280
So there's a much more I don't know why they need the full rooms worth of.

2160
01:24:41,560 --> 01:24:43,720
Industrial fans. Yes.

2161
01:24:44,360 --> 01:24:48,040
How did the is it just to cool down the tube and the gun?

2162
01:24:48,320 --> 01:24:50,000
They get that hot under stage lighting.

2163
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,080
Maybe that must be it could be that.

2164
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:57,280
But things have built to such a point that the turtles just have to leave

2165
01:24:57,320 --> 01:25:01,480
and they just say, we'll be back unclear why they're leaving.

2166
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:04,920
But then in the most terrifying moment of your childhood,

2167
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:09,120
Shredder throws to intermission and he says he's going to lock the doors.

2168
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:12,720
And he says, I like this for this still scares me a little bit.

2169
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:15,040
I'll tell you when I want you back.

2170
01:25:15,880 --> 01:25:18,320
So the intermission occurs.

2171
01:25:18,320 --> 01:25:20,560
I there's all this stuff with David Rubrik, but I'm going to skip it

2172
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:22,800
because I need to talk about the song.

2173
01:25:23,120 --> 01:25:24,880
I hate music.

2174
01:25:24,920 --> 01:25:26,160
This is the center.

2175
01:25:26,160 --> 01:25:27,760
Why do I care about this?

2176
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:30,320
Why do why was I excited about doing an episode?

2177
01:25:30,320 --> 01:25:32,800
I love I hate music with all my heart.

2178
01:25:33,200 --> 01:25:38,880
I hate music is a song, a song that shredder sings about hating music.

2179
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:42,080
It is a musical ode to no music.

2180
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:45,200
What a wonderful conundrum enigma.

2181
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:48,360
I love it so much.

2182
01:25:48,360 --> 01:25:50,600
Before that, Shredder,

2183
01:25:51,400 --> 01:25:56,760
after intermission, kids are chanting turtles, turtles to their chagrin.

2184
01:25:56,840 --> 01:25:59,600
The turtles do not show up, but rather

2185
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:03,680
April, who is tied to a big rope and then

2186
01:26:04,240 --> 01:26:07,840
and the foot army and then Shredder, who still has control of the stage.

2187
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:11,960
And he proceeds to just do like roast material

2188
01:26:12,240 --> 01:26:15,400
at the audience for a full seven minutes.

2189
01:26:15,440 --> 01:26:18,240
That I liked. It is so much fun.

2190
01:26:18,280 --> 01:26:19,760
I just I could just swim in that.

2191
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:21,960
It's it could not be long enough.

2192
01:26:21,960 --> 01:26:25,240
It's it is he just paces back and forth.

2193
01:26:25,440 --> 01:26:28,800
The cameras at Dutch angles, assuming in and out.

2194
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:31,680
We are so far gone from concert at this point.

2195
01:26:31,880 --> 01:26:34,080
It is not tight. It is not tidy.

2196
01:26:34,080 --> 01:26:36,640
We're just what like children are screaming.

2197
01:26:36,760 --> 01:26:39,360
Kids are in the aisles, shaking swords around.

2198
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:43,400
Well, this actor just hurls insults.

2199
01:26:43,400 --> 01:26:48,000
And the other thing about Shredder, he has kind of a voice modulator on.

2200
01:26:48,240 --> 01:26:50,520
So everything dialogue is all.

2201
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:54,160
Yeah, it's like, oh, it's all like part.

2202
01:26:54,240 --> 01:26:55,880
But it's down.

2203
01:26:55,880 --> 01:26:59,160
There's like a whiny quality to it because of the modulator as well.

2204
01:26:59,160 --> 01:27:01,040
Yeah. Yeah.

2205
01:27:01,040 --> 01:27:03,520
Yeah, that makes anything sound funny.

2206
01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:06,160
Yeah. And especially just roast jokes.

2207
01:27:06,920 --> 01:27:08,000
Thank you.

2208
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:11,800
He's first of all, a lot of it, he's like fishing for something like you.

2209
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,080
What's your name, Ben?

2210
01:27:15,040 --> 01:27:16,560
What was it, Ben?

2211
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:18,520
Oh, big Ben.

2212
01:27:18,520 --> 01:27:19,840
And that's all he gets out.

2213
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:21,440
That's the joke there.

2214
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:25,480
He does have a good one in his pocket, which he says, it was that your sister.

2215
01:27:26,640 --> 01:27:28,640
When it no friend, friend.

2216
01:27:29,240 --> 01:27:30,320
No. OK.

2217
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:32,600
Cousin. Oh, cousin.

2218
01:27:32,600 --> 01:27:33,960
What's the matter? Couldn't get a date.

2219
01:27:33,960 --> 01:27:35,960
That's the best joke of the whole show.

2220
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:39,320
And then the kid keeps the other kids.

2221
01:27:39,320 --> 01:27:41,280
These kids are so in it.

2222
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:42,960
They all think it's real.

2223
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:43,840
They are committed.

2224
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:45,960
If they don't fight right now verbally,

2225
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:47,040
everything's fucked.

2226
01:27:47,040 --> 01:27:50,040
So the kid who got that insult keeps fighting.

2227
01:27:50,120 --> 01:27:52,400
He says, who do you hang out with?

2228
01:27:52,760 --> 01:27:54,200
Who do you hang out with?

2229
01:27:54,200 --> 01:27:55,520
And it's pitched.

2230
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:58,200
It's like a high pitched kid's voice and it's barely mic'd.

2231
01:27:58,400 --> 01:27:59,120
So it's a detail.

2232
01:27:59,120 --> 01:28:02,000
You have to watch this many times to have heard it as I have.

2233
01:28:02,120 --> 01:28:03,960
Have I watched this whole video a lot of times?

2234
01:28:03,960 --> 01:28:06,440
No. Have I watched I hate music frequently?

2235
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:08,160
I sure have.

2236
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:10,920
It's it's so delightful.

2237
01:28:10,920 --> 01:28:14,680
I remember this part of the show when he was addressing the audience.

2238
01:28:14,680 --> 01:28:15,960
How was this in person?

2239
01:28:15,960 --> 01:28:18,000
I was terrified. I didn't want him to notice me.

2240
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
I was like, please don't notice me.

2241
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:21,360
And there were kids in the aisle.

2242
01:28:21,360 --> 01:28:25,120
My sister, three years younger than me, was dancing in the aisle.

2243
01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:27,160
I don't recall if she I don't think she was yelling at Shredder,

2244
01:28:27,360 --> 01:28:30,920
but she was very comfortable to like dance and like yell with the kids in the aisle.

2245
01:28:31,040 --> 01:28:33,080
I was not. I wanted to stay in my seat

2246
01:28:33,080 --> 01:28:36,080
because I was very worried that Shredder would notice me and murder me.

2247
01:28:36,720 --> 01:28:40,000
Hey, you, you don't seem too comfortable in your skin, do you?

2248
01:28:40,720 --> 01:28:43,400
Probably a lot of insecurities.

2249
01:28:43,680 --> 01:28:45,360
For a friend that I'm talking to you right now.

2250
01:28:45,360 --> 01:28:47,840
Yeah. We got to get out of here.

2251
01:28:47,960 --> 01:28:50,280
And then he just and then like it stops being heard.

2252
01:28:50,280 --> 01:28:52,720
He just like slices you with his wrist guard.

2253
01:28:54,240 --> 01:28:55,920
It kills me.

2254
01:28:55,920 --> 01:28:57,480
My worst fear.

2255
01:28:57,480 --> 01:29:00,080
There's a cooler painting of you in an attic somewhere.

2256
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:05,880
I another favorite joke of mine.

2257
01:29:06,120 --> 01:29:09,120
You know, I think I've seen your face on a milk carton recently.

2258
01:29:09,880 --> 01:29:11,160
I put into Moonbeam City.

2259
01:29:11,160 --> 01:29:13,440
I had a whole there's a whole episode about stunt shows and like

2260
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:15,600
and the character Rad is a stunt show villain.

2261
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:17,800
And he says that I think I also tried to put in the line

2262
01:29:17,800 --> 01:29:22,520
imbecilic little punoids also a good detail, which he reprises on Oprah,

2263
01:29:22,680 --> 01:29:26,120
because that's this thing that happens in the show also happens on Oprah.

2264
01:29:26,160 --> 01:29:29,840
And Oprah seems like she was only barely briefed about what was going to have.

2265
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:31,480
She knows like Shredder is going to come out at some point,

2266
01:29:31,480 --> 01:29:32,800
and she's trying to cue it.

2267
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:38,480
So somebody just says Shredder and she's in like, like, oh, God, I hate that guy.

2268
01:29:39,400 --> 01:29:43,880
Like, well, I think while he's going to come out at some point,

2269
01:29:43,880 --> 01:29:49,320
right, then wave of booze and then and Shredder is in the back of the audience

2270
01:29:49,320 --> 01:29:54,080
at Oprah, tall, calling him punoids saying every style, every city you'll be in.

2271
01:29:54,080 --> 01:29:56,680
I'll be there when you're in Chicago.

2272
01:29:56,680 --> 01:29:58,840
I'll be there. Miami.

2273
01:29:58,840 --> 01:30:00,360
I'll be there as well.

2274
01:30:00,360 --> 01:30:03,400
I'm at a perhaps in San Antonio.

2275
01:30:04,360 --> 01:30:08,280
It is such a blast also that all of this just front to back booing.

2276
01:30:08,480 --> 01:30:13,320
And how much fun to be in an audience where you are just you just get to boo

2277
01:30:13,440 --> 01:30:16,160
and boo, I don't think I've ever been part of a good booing.

2278
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:17,960
I don't I want to rail too much.

2279
01:30:17,960 --> 01:30:22,680
But in high school, senior year, we ran the student council with an iron fist.

2280
01:30:23,120 --> 01:30:25,560
And we got to decide what the theme of the homecoming was.

2281
01:30:25,880 --> 01:30:28,160
And we decided that I forget why.

2282
01:30:28,160 --> 01:30:30,880
I think it was like the theme of homecoming was city something.

2283
01:30:30,880 --> 01:30:34,400
And we said the theme of the the pep rally before

2284
01:30:34,680 --> 01:30:36,920
or of the assembly was going to be Gotham City.

2285
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:42,360
And we staged my friend Luke playing the Riddler

2286
01:30:43,200 --> 01:30:48,000
and a couple and some of us as goons to steal the homecoming crown from a child.

2287
01:30:48,160 --> 01:30:51,120
Whoa. And the audience,

2288
01:30:51,680 --> 01:30:53,360
you can see it because there's a video of it.

2289
01:30:53,360 --> 01:30:54,960
And I've watched it recently.

2290
01:30:54,960 --> 01:30:57,720
The audience is at first not quite on board.

2291
01:30:58,120 --> 01:31:02,000
Then because of the fact that we were doing so much like moviemaking

2292
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:06,240
and backyard wrestling, we had some stunts in our pocket.

2293
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:09,840
So we did a little stunt show and we got the way into it.

2294
01:31:10,120 --> 01:31:12,160
So it was we were thrilled.

2295
01:31:12,160 --> 01:31:13,200
It was a big success.

2296
01:31:13,200 --> 01:31:15,440
And there was a big pep rally coming up in a couple of days.

2297
01:31:15,720 --> 01:31:17,960
And we said, well, let's do it again.

2298
01:31:17,960 --> 01:31:20,040
Only let's take it up a notch.

2299
01:31:20,040 --> 01:31:23,440
So we got we doubled the amount of goons the Riddler had.

2300
01:31:23,960 --> 01:31:28,960
We made big giant signs of the opposing football team

2301
01:31:29,200 --> 01:31:32,720
that we draped into the gym, like giant signs.

2302
01:31:32,720 --> 01:31:33,920
Oh, my God.

2303
01:31:33,920 --> 01:31:37,720
So in the middle of this teacher that would always rally the like,

2304
01:31:37,720 --> 01:31:39,600
oh, come on, sex, let's go.

2305
01:31:39,800 --> 01:31:40,920
First of all, he blew his cue.

2306
01:31:40,920 --> 01:31:43,600
We told him, don't mention the Riddler, just we'll interrupt you.

2307
01:31:43,760 --> 01:31:45,120
And all of a sudden he goes, oh, what's that?

2308
01:31:45,120 --> 01:31:47,320
Is it the Riddler? And we were like, God damn it.

2309
01:31:47,400 --> 01:31:49,240
And the one thing he fucked that up.

2310
01:31:49,240 --> 01:31:51,760
But I unfortunately, even though I was one of the architects,

2311
01:31:51,760 --> 01:31:52,880
was only one of the goons.

2312
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:56,480
But we were all hidden with like stuff under our clothes in the audience.

2313
01:31:57,360 --> 01:32:00,240
So Riddler shows up in the top floor of the gym.

2314
01:32:00,520 --> 01:32:03,840
We unfurl these giant banners that we had made.

2315
01:32:04,240 --> 01:32:06,520
Court. Now, this is what you're talking about with booze.

2316
01:32:06,680 --> 01:32:10,680
The most satisfying booze I've ever felt in my life. Yeah.

2317
01:32:10,720 --> 01:32:14,440
This is a huge everyone's jacked up for the big homecoming weekend.

2318
01:32:14,640 --> 01:32:16,080
Everyone is booing.

2319
01:32:16,080 --> 01:32:19,800
Luke and two other of my friends dressed as goons are walking through.

2320
01:32:20,200 --> 01:32:22,240
They hopped the railing down the risers.

2321
01:32:22,600 --> 01:32:26,040
They're throwing confetti like, you know, like Jack Nicholson

2322
01:32:26,040 --> 01:32:27,800
or something in the first Batman movie.

2323
01:32:27,800 --> 01:32:29,080
They're throwing confetti.

2324
01:32:29,080 --> 01:32:32,080
And Luke is roasting people on his way down.

2325
01:32:32,080 --> 01:32:34,240
And it's the booze were the greatest.

2326
01:32:34,240 --> 01:32:38,280
Like we all had signs to promoting the other football team.

2327
01:32:38,280 --> 01:32:41,000
So I'm walking around with a sign and people are booing me.

2328
01:32:41,480 --> 01:32:45,560
And then we humiliate our mascot in the front in the middle of the court.

2329
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:47,880
And he takes the head off and it's Batman.

2330
01:32:48,280 --> 01:32:52,200
And then we do a giant fight in the middle and Batman beats us all up.

2331
01:32:52,200 --> 01:32:54,600
Wow. And it's like the greatest.

2332
01:32:54,600 --> 01:32:56,360
Still probably the greatest moment of my life.

2333
01:32:56,360 --> 01:32:58,400
And this is theme parks. This is wrestling.

2334
01:32:58,400 --> 01:33:00,840
Yeah. And what did Luke go on to do?

2335
01:33:00,840 --> 01:33:02,560
Television writer? Yeah. Yeah.

2336
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:03,600
What do you mean?

2337
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:06,840
No, it's just funny. You both ended up out here in city of dreams.

2338
01:33:06,840 --> 01:33:09,000
Too theatrical. Your storytelling.

2339
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:14,440
Yes. The prowess proved so strong that it had to be carried out to Los Angeles.

2340
01:33:15,440 --> 01:33:18,640
I mean, yeah, that's the I mean, this is like it's Green Goblin.

2341
01:33:18,640 --> 01:33:19,840
It's like fantastic.

2342
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:22,680
This is like I and I know it has in wrestling, too.

2343
01:33:22,680 --> 01:33:26,920
Just like like, yeah, being a cartoony heel for children.

2344
01:33:26,920 --> 01:33:28,280
What a wonderful thing.

2345
01:33:28,400 --> 01:33:32,440
And I guess I could watch Shredder strut back and forth and just improvise jokes

2346
01:33:32,440 --> 01:33:34,640
that you know, this actor is having the greatest time.

2347
01:33:34,640 --> 01:33:35,680
Yeah, I think they did.

2348
01:33:35,680 --> 01:33:39,880
I think the stat is there were 270 performances of this show.

2349
01:33:39,880 --> 01:33:43,080
Oh, my God. I bet he ate it up every time.

2350
01:33:43,080 --> 01:33:46,120
I bet every like like, you know what I get to do today?

2351
01:33:46,120 --> 01:33:50,960
I get to go be screamed at by children who I'm allowed to be mean back to.

2352
01:33:50,960 --> 01:33:52,720
Yeah. What a wonderful thing.

2353
01:33:52,720 --> 01:33:56,360
But it culminates in my favorite part of the show.

2354
01:33:56,400 --> 01:33:59,480
It culminates in my favorite by far.

2355
01:33:59,480 --> 01:34:03,760
My favorite music composition, which ironically is I hate music.

2356
01:34:03,760 --> 01:34:05,920
All right. Do you just have the whole thing or do you?

2357
01:34:05,920 --> 01:34:08,920
I have to. I can use your clips.

2358
01:34:08,920 --> 01:34:10,760
That's OK. Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure.

2359
01:34:10,760 --> 01:34:13,200
Yeah. If you go in the order they're presented.

2360
01:34:13,200 --> 01:34:15,680
Yeah. I just try to curate the best of.

2361
01:34:15,680 --> 01:34:17,800
Right. I hate music. All right. Here we go.

2362
01:34:26,880 --> 01:34:28,760
I hate music.

2363
01:34:32,600 --> 01:34:34,440
Which is the same thing in this.

2364
01:34:34,440 --> 01:34:35,920
Yes, exactly.

2365
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:38,360
I hate music.

2366
01:34:38,360 --> 01:34:39,840
I hate music.

2367
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:42,040
That's that's that's just the beginning.

2368
01:34:42,040 --> 01:34:44,720
I love that it's rhythmic for a second.

2369
01:34:44,720 --> 01:34:48,640
I love that when the band's on a rehearsal, I hate music.

2370
01:34:49,680 --> 01:34:51,920
I think it's the worst.

2371
01:34:51,920 --> 01:34:53,160
I think it's the worst.

2372
01:34:53,160 --> 01:34:55,320
I think it's the worst.

2373
01:34:55,320 --> 01:34:57,760
I love that it's real. I hate music.

2374
01:34:57,760 --> 01:34:59,600
But then just music.

2375
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:02,800
You can tell there's some rhythm struggle with this man.

2376
01:35:03,560 --> 01:35:06,120
And OK, so a couple of things.

2377
01:35:06,120 --> 01:35:08,600
I think that their assumption is, how do we how do we express

2378
01:35:08,600 --> 01:35:11,040
that Shredder hates music, but also do music?

2379
01:35:11,160 --> 01:35:14,080
I think they maybe have made the choice that rap is not music.

2380
01:35:14,240 --> 01:35:15,480
Yeah, it does have a bizarre.

2381
01:35:15,480 --> 01:35:19,360
It is an interesting perhaps comment by the people making this.

2382
01:35:19,360 --> 01:35:21,520
You were clearly like older studio musicians.

2383
01:35:21,520 --> 01:35:24,000
This is their way to like stick it to rap.

2384
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's prove it with example.

2385
01:35:27,520 --> 01:35:29,720
Then the lyric I.

2386
01:35:33,640 --> 01:35:35,000
I love this so much.

2387
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,480
The gift of the gift of song is a gift.

2388
01:35:37,480 --> 01:35:41,160
I curse that's that just is wonderful.

2389
01:35:41,280 --> 01:35:42,800
But then the way I think what you just played was I

2390
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:46,080
I love it when the band is under rehearsed,

2391
01:35:46,640 --> 01:35:49,920
I guess because if he hates music and if a band is under rehearsed,

2392
01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:51,960
then that is like less music.

2393
01:35:51,960 --> 01:35:54,800
Yeah, I guess you like seeing music failing.

2394
01:35:55,120 --> 01:35:59,440
Yes, he enjoys the failure of a band, maybe fall on its face. Right.

2395
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:03,560
If he went to a concert and the bass and the keyboard

2396
01:36:03,560 --> 01:36:06,560
were not plugged in properly, he might like that

2397
01:36:06,560 --> 01:36:08,920
because there is a failure of music.

2398
01:36:08,920 --> 01:36:12,280
He probably he probably laughed with Glee

2399
01:36:12,280 --> 01:36:15,040
when the Ashley Simpson incident on SNL occurred.

2400
01:36:15,440 --> 01:36:19,160
My favorite music ever, probably Ashley Simpson.

2401
01:36:19,280 --> 01:36:21,800
No, yeah, he loves any.

2402
01:36:21,800 --> 01:36:25,080
Yeah, he liked when Prince's guitar wasn't plugged on on Saturday Night Live.

2403
01:36:25,120 --> 01:36:26,960
Yeah, yeah. He thought that was great.

2404
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:31,400
He may be does he like sit and watch music in hopes of music fucking up?

2405
01:36:31,400 --> 01:36:32,480
Or is it or maybe he doesn't?

2406
01:36:32,480 --> 01:36:36,040
Maybe he waits for like, hey, if you ever see like a problem with music

2407
01:36:36,320 --> 01:36:39,320
and then just forward it to me, Baxter Stockman sends to me,

2408
01:36:39,320 --> 01:36:44,600
sends me YouTube link at Gmail dot com Baxter S at Gmail dot com.

2409
01:36:44,720 --> 01:36:47,520
Send me just for me like music fails.

2410
01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:49,400
Like any time they have music fails.

2411
01:36:49,400 --> 01:36:52,800
I do tape trading of music fail compilations

2412
01:36:53,920 --> 01:36:57,560
like a hurricane caves the stage in. That's good.

2413
01:36:57,800 --> 01:37:00,000
I mean, like, hey, because people are getting hurt, but man,

2414
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,760
be mainly because music's going south.

2415
01:37:05,240 --> 01:37:08,080
I so so fun.

2416
01:37:08,080 --> 01:37:11,520
I mean, and also the kind of dancing he's doing is just this like sort of like

2417
01:37:11,520 --> 01:37:16,560
pirate hopping around and a lot of like legs, legs wide out

2418
01:37:16,640 --> 01:37:18,040
and then arm way up.

2419
01:37:18,040 --> 01:37:19,840
And there's a lot of like spitting like

2420
01:37:21,520 --> 01:37:26,040
and there's a moment that I like where he April has his back to

2421
01:37:26,040 --> 01:37:27,040
April's on a big rope.

2422
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:29,120
He has his back to her and then he walks up and like,

2423
01:37:29,800 --> 01:37:32,720
like taps her on the shoulder tap, tap, tap.

2424
01:37:32,800 --> 01:37:34,800
And then says, I think it's the worst.

2425
01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:37,160
And she like jumps back. Ah.

2426
01:37:38,200 --> 01:37:41,400
But the other I think the other clip, I'm not sure how many I hate music.

2427
01:37:41,440 --> 01:37:43,720
So you have three here. Three. Yeah.

2428
01:37:43,800 --> 01:37:45,240
Play number three, my favorite part.

2429
01:37:47,040 --> 01:37:51,000
Music is going to be a song. I don't know. It's not my goal.

2430
01:37:51,120 --> 01:37:55,400
I just want you to every day you listen to the words I say.

2431
01:37:55,400 --> 01:37:57,720
I control the world because the music is gone.

2432
01:37:57,960 --> 01:37:59,920
I am the leader from now on.

2433
01:37:59,920 --> 01:38:03,040
Do you hear what I say? I hate music.

2434
01:38:06,160 --> 01:38:07,760
I think it's the worst.

2435
01:38:07,760 --> 01:38:09,320
I love the worst.

2436
01:38:09,320 --> 01:38:12,480
They say the music is good for your soul. I don't know. It's not my goal.

2437
01:38:13,320 --> 01:38:18,040
Yeah, I just and then I destroy music every day.

2438
01:38:18,240 --> 01:38:21,400
That kind of like slant rhythm music.

2439
01:38:22,040 --> 01:38:25,440
Yeah, it is not the correct way to know. No.

2440
01:38:25,520 --> 01:38:30,120
But I love I feel like this guy maybe I think he himself was perhaps under

2441
01:38:30,120 --> 01:38:33,800
rehearsed, but he is diving into this with such gusto.

2442
01:38:34,200 --> 01:38:35,840
I think it's one of my favorite performance.

2443
01:38:35,840 --> 01:38:38,600
Whoever this man is, I looked up the name.

2444
01:38:38,600 --> 01:38:40,680
He's like a theater actor who's still around.

2445
01:38:40,680 --> 01:38:43,160
But God bless you.

2446
01:38:43,360 --> 01:38:44,800
I it is so much fun.

2447
01:38:44,800 --> 01:38:50,440
If I hit music was 35 minutes long, I would actually go inverse.

2448
01:38:50,440 --> 01:38:54,480
I would have most of this show be Shredder's thoughts on music

2449
01:38:54,480 --> 01:38:56,560
and then like a little bit of turtles.

2450
01:38:56,560 --> 01:38:58,760
Just give them one number.

2451
01:38:58,760 --> 01:39:01,040
But let's just go artist by artist.

2452
01:39:01,040 --> 01:39:03,640
Let's see him destroy every album.

2453
01:39:04,840 --> 01:39:09,240
Orchard's not a fan. Quartet's no thanks, man.

2454
01:39:10,240 --> 01:39:11,400
At least they're better.

2455
01:39:11,400 --> 01:39:13,040
There's less of them.

2456
01:39:13,040 --> 01:39:14,880
Orchards are the most music.

2457
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:16,400
I hate music.

2458
01:39:18,080 --> 01:39:21,920
I these are like white stripes

2459
01:39:22,360 --> 01:39:26,040
like more like I wipes it with my butt.

2460
01:39:26,480 --> 01:39:29,240
Put it in the harmonic and for its controller.

2461
01:39:29,280 --> 01:39:32,680
It's the worst. I think it's the worst.

2462
01:39:33,280 --> 01:39:34,440
What's the worst music?

2463
01:39:34,440 --> 01:39:37,080
It's a tie between all. I hate music.

2464
01:39:37,080 --> 01:39:41,040
I so much fun.

2465
01:39:41,920 --> 01:39:44,520
Oh, and then at the end, if you haven't gotten

2466
01:39:45,400 --> 01:39:48,920
if you ever like picked up on his point, he says, get the picture.

2467
01:39:48,920 --> 01:39:50,840
I hate music.

2468
01:39:50,840 --> 01:39:53,520
Hit it. That's right, buddy.

2469
01:39:54,080 --> 01:39:55,800
He says, that's right, buddy.

2470
01:39:55,800 --> 01:39:57,920
Yeah. He's not talking to anyone specifically.

2471
01:39:58,040 --> 01:40:00,320
Now, I say anybody who might be in your shot.

2472
01:40:01,680 --> 01:40:03,400
I don't want to break down the logic of this too much,

2473
01:40:03,400 --> 01:40:06,360
but I do think it's interesting that for whatever Shredder,

2474
01:40:06,640 --> 01:40:08,120
there's not any instance of him

2475
01:40:08,120 --> 01:40:10,560
complaining about music in the comics or cartoon.

2476
01:40:11,240 --> 01:40:15,680
He somehow has an inverse opinion than the Turtles do all of a sudden.

2477
01:40:15,800 --> 01:40:18,680
Yeah. So they're into it and he hates it.

2478
01:40:18,720 --> 01:40:20,320
What it is, he's just being contrarian.

2479
01:40:20,320 --> 01:40:23,960
If they got into crocheting, it'd be I hate crochet.

2480
01:40:24,520 --> 01:40:26,720
I hate whatever is popular.

2481
01:40:26,720 --> 01:40:29,520
I'm not going to see end game.

2482
01:40:29,520 --> 01:40:32,160
He's just he's a hipster, really, is what he's.

2483
01:40:32,160 --> 01:40:33,360
Yeah, contrarian.

2484
01:40:33,360 --> 01:40:35,560
I was the first to not like music.

2485
01:40:36,120 --> 01:40:39,440
Because I think I think my thoughts at the time were that it was the worst.

2486
01:40:41,160 --> 01:40:43,960
You tried to explain this to me a while back.

2487
01:40:43,960 --> 01:40:45,320
And I'm like, what is that?

2488
01:40:45,320 --> 01:40:48,160
And then and when I first started poking around, I'm like this.

2489
01:40:48,680 --> 01:40:52,680
There's no music track on the album and then the live video.

2490
01:40:52,720 --> 01:40:53,920
Yeah, it's there.

2491
01:40:53,920 --> 01:40:55,800
It's the centerpiece of the show.

2492
01:40:55,800 --> 01:40:57,600
I don't know what it is without it.

2493
01:40:57,600 --> 01:40:59,400
It's the it's the molten core.

2494
01:40:59,400 --> 01:41:02,320
And yeah, I love it so much.

2495
01:41:02,320 --> 01:41:04,880
Just that general, I hate music.

2496
01:41:05,040 --> 01:41:06,600
He's he's a villain.

2497
01:41:06,600 --> 01:41:11,360
He's a murderer villain who controls an army and he hates music.

2498
01:41:11,560 --> 01:41:15,880
And yet how he chooses to express that is I hate music.

2499
01:41:16,120 --> 01:41:20,120
I know that he's so like cutesy, sashay.

2500
01:41:20,320 --> 01:41:22,080
It seems like he's having a great time.

2501
01:41:22,080 --> 01:41:26,400
He he's very like if they they took his modulator off, he is.

2502
01:41:26,480 --> 01:41:27,920
I think his voice is cute.

2503
01:41:27,920 --> 01:41:30,160
I think his performance is cute.

2504
01:41:30,160 --> 01:41:32,120
I think that he's actually jokes are cute.

2505
01:41:32,120 --> 01:41:33,320
They're kind of for everybody.

2506
01:41:33,320 --> 01:41:33,680
Yeah.

2507
01:41:34,520 --> 01:41:39,160
He has those big, weird painted on eyebrows in that close close ups,

2508
01:41:39,160 --> 01:41:40,880
which are strange, but like he's a male.

2509
01:41:40,880 --> 01:41:42,640
Grace Jones from the inside.

2510
01:41:42,640 --> 01:41:43,160
Yes.

2511
01:41:43,160 --> 01:41:46,080
And he's laughing during like he's laughing during it, too.

2512
01:41:46,240 --> 01:41:48,880
And he's like the least threatening man I've ever seen.

2513
01:41:48,880 --> 01:41:49,440
Yeah.

2514
01:41:49,440 --> 01:41:52,480
And it's a lot. And it's very classic.

2515
01:41:52,480 --> 01:41:54,040
Yeah, which is great.

2516
01:41:54,040 --> 01:41:56,520
But at the time, of course, I thought he was a devil himself.

2517
01:41:57,240 --> 01:42:01,560
He's carrying act two because all the turtle stuff got so confusing to me.

2518
01:42:01,560 --> 01:42:02,760
They're like in the sewers.

2519
01:42:02,760 --> 01:42:08,600
They have like a cloaking device, but it only works so much.

2520
01:42:08,600 --> 01:42:13,760
And like he's explaining it to the music cloaking because then we can get back in.

2521
01:42:14,400 --> 01:42:16,080
The music won't affect us. God.

2522
01:42:16,080 --> 01:42:19,240
They're so whiny explaining shit to rubrics.

2523
01:42:20,480 --> 01:42:22,240
Also got to call out,

2524
01:42:22,240 --> 01:42:24,280
does anybody want a new kids on the blog?

2525
01:42:24,280 --> 01:42:27,920
I hear they're bringing up topical references.

2526
01:42:27,920 --> 01:42:28,960
Topical reference.

2527
01:42:28,960 --> 01:42:31,160
And people boo that. No.

2528
01:42:31,160 --> 01:42:32,120
Yeah, we don't want that.

2529
01:42:32,120 --> 01:42:33,520
We want them to stay together.

2530
01:42:33,520 --> 01:42:35,680
They mean it. They really mean it.

2531
01:42:36,080 --> 01:42:38,120
And then as soon as the song is over,

2532
01:42:39,880 --> 01:42:42,120
it could not be quicker on the draw.

2533
01:42:42,120 --> 01:42:44,600
April's full volume voice booing.

2534
01:42:44,960 --> 01:42:49,400
I just love a silly rap by a mean guy and then everybody booze.

2535
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:51,720
Yeah, it is just simple pleasures.

2536
01:42:51,920 --> 01:42:54,560
And then as you reference, Jason, there's all the logic of that.

2537
01:42:54,560 --> 01:42:58,680
Maybe he will leave Barry Manilow because that, I guess, is so bad

2538
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,800
that it's you maybe don't consider it music.

2539
01:43:02,040 --> 01:43:04,000
But then he has a change of heart.

2540
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:08,120
And as his power and hatred grows, he says, I will destroy the music,

2541
01:43:08,240 --> 01:43:11,200
including Barry Manilow.

2542
01:43:11,480 --> 01:43:15,640
And then very confusingly, he said well, so he really references songs

2543
01:43:15,640 --> 01:43:17,440
as he does with the turtles earlier.

2544
01:43:17,440 --> 01:43:20,160
He references Flo and Eddie, the band, the turtles, right?

2545
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:22,160
My D harmonic controller.

2546
01:43:22,160 --> 01:43:24,240
We're happy together.

2547
01:43:24,240 --> 01:43:25,600
A joke only for parents.

2548
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:27,240
And then do they like it?

2549
01:43:27,240 --> 01:43:29,240
But he does the same thing with Manilow and he says,

2550
01:43:29,440 --> 01:43:33,720
Mary, you write the songs that make the whole world puke.

2551
01:43:34,360 --> 01:43:38,680
But before that, he says, have a nice weekend in New England.

2552
01:43:39,640 --> 01:43:41,360
No idea. No idea.

2553
01:43:41,360 --> 01:43:42,280
I don't know what that is.

2554
01:43:42,280 --> 01:43:45,800
I asked my wife who likes Barry Manilow, Mary Barry Manilow enough

2555
01:43:45,800 --> 01:43:46,640
to have a shirt of him.

2556
01:43:46,640 --> 01:43:49,800
She has no idea what Barry, what nice weekend in New England is about.

2557
01:43:50,160 --> 01:43:52,360
No idea. Did you?

2558
01:43:52,360 --> 01:43:54,680
No, don't care that much.

2559
01:43:54,680 --> 01:43:58,840
Do it. Did Michelangelo make a joke about Mandy to like the turtles?

2560
01:43:58,840 --> 01:43:59,920
Talking to the reporter.

2561
01:43:59,920 --> 01:44:03,440
There's a joke about Mandy that's not bad.

2562
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:04,760
It's pretty good.

2563
01:44:04,760 --> 01:44:06,400
I don't remember it, though, now.

2564
01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:08,760
He came and he gave without taking or something.

2565
01:44:08,760 --> 01:44:09,680
I don't know.

2566
01:44:09,680 --> 01:44:12,480
But that's in that same zone where they're so petulant

2567
01:44:12,920 --> 01:44:15,160
about not understanding because it's a cloaking device.

2568
01:44:15,160 --> 01:44:17,160
And I know because Mandy came and gave it like taking it.

2569
01:44:17,160 --> 01:44:19,880
Like, I get off my back and they're fighting with each other.

2570
01:44:19,960 --> 01:44:22,000
It always stressed me out when the turtles fight with each other.

2571
01:44:22,360 --> 01:44:24,440
Yeah. Just Raph is mean.

2572
01:44:24,440 --> 01:44:25,960
Yeah. Why is he so mean?

2573
01:44:26,960 --> 01:44:30,120
So then then this plot

2574
01:44:30,760 --> 01:44:35,160
continues where he's you see the machinations of music disappearing

2575
01:44:35,160 --> 01:44:39,840
and elevator music is gone and some and they interview in a pre-tip video

2576
01:44:39,840 --> 01:44:43,760
a man who's like working to try to get the elevator music back.

2577
01:44:43,920 --> 01:44:47,400
And he references Ray Conniff's Mr. Bojangles.

2578
01:44:48,280 --> 01:44:52,520
That's incredibly I only know from like the lounge section at Amoeba.

2579
01:44:52,520 --> 01:44:55,560
What Ray Conniff is? Yeah. Yeah.

2580
01:44:55,560 --> 01:45:00,120
Deep cuts in this show for having like hammy jokes.

2581
01:45:00,200 --> 01:45:02,400
Well, this guy is this big this

2582
01:45:02,400 --> 01:45:04,720
what Bichon guy is Broadway.

2583
01:45:04,720 --> 01:45:06,480
He started on Broadway.

2584
01:45:06,480 --> 01:45:08,720
So I think he's a lot of these are his references.

2585
01:45:08,720 --> 01:45:11,160
Probably cheeky. Yeah.

2586
01:45:11,160 --> 01:45:14,720
Yeah. And Broadway humor is very distinct.

2587
01:45:15,040 --> 01:45:16,800
It's very yes.

2588
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:20,760
Sometimes it's kind of theme parky where it's like broad and eight to 80.

2589
01:45:20,760 --> 01:45:23,160
And then sometimes it's so narrow.

2590
01:45:23,600 --> 01:45:27,480
It's literally just for the people who work on Broadway.

2591
01:45:27,960 --> 01:45:29,760
That on a stage. Yeah.

2592
01:45:29,760 --> 01:45:32,880
So so to tie into my next I might be jumping around a little bit.

2593
01:45:32,880 --> 01:45:35,040
But so there's this voice modulator on shredder.

2594
01:45:35,480 --> 01:45:39,840
And then the next time the turtles perform, it is the song No Treaties.

2595
01:45:40,080 --> 01:45:42,800
And if you could play clip number one that I put on there,

2596
01:45:43,840 --> 01:45:48,400
I believe there was a mistake and maybe a little voice modulator was left on.

2597
01:45:53,320 --> 01:45:55,240
He thinks he can stop it.

2598
01:45:55,240 --> 01:45:57,640
Bring it all to end.

2599
01:45:57,640 --> 01:45:58,560
And now it's him.

2600
01:45:58,560 --> 01:45:59,520
It's about.

2601
01:46:01,240 --> 01:46:06,560
That's why I think that's why I think the it was live.

2602
01:46:07,120 --> 01:46:09,680
Yeah, well, it has to be a view event.

2603
01:46:09,680 --> 01:46:11,880
So there's yeah, there's a lot of like that very

2604
01:46:12,600 --> 01:46:14,920
if you're filming a Broadway thing where you can hear like stomps

2605
01:46:14,920 --> 01:46:17,120
and just like straight sound on the stage.

2606
01:46:18,560 --> 01:46:21,560
But anyway, I have music has occurred,

2607
01:46:21,560 --> 01:46:26,360
but it really is all downhill from here to me because we get in all these like very

2608
01:46:27,280 --> 01:46:29,640
like patients trying ballads.

2609
01:46:29,960 --> 01:46:31,920
Well, no treaties is a little upbeat.

2610
01:46:31,920 --> 01:46:34,520
Yeah, yeah. That's how I see it.

2611
01:46:34,520 --> 01:46:36,040
Yeah, it's OK.

2612
01:46:36,040 --> 01:46:38,400
And we're just like kind of getting ready to because how do you top?

2613
01:46:38,680 --> 01:46:41,920
Yeah, this is no treaties to pull the album out of no.

2614
01:46:42,600 --> 01:46:45,400
And it's I like this more than I remembered liking it.

2615
01:46:47,800 --> 01:46:50,280
I like the voice modulator.

2616
01:47:13,240 --> 01:47:13,640
The Lord.

2617
01:47:13,640 --> 01:47:14,560
The Lord. No, the inspectors.

2618
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:15,080
Good.

2619
01:47:28,480 --> 01:47:29,880
The YouTube song, No Treaties.

2620
01:47:29,880 --> 01:47:30,480
No Treaties.

2621
01:47:30,480 --> 01:47:32,520
I mean, I don't know why it's in a Ninja Turtle show.

2622
01:47:32,520 --> 01:47:33,920
Yeah, it's an odd.

2623
01:47:33,920 --> 01:47:35,280
Maybe this was like a cast off.

2624
01:47:35,280 --> 01:47:37,280
Somebody had no treaties in the pocket.

2625
01:47:37,280 --> 01:47:40,560
Yeah, they were writing a real like Reagan's Scorcher and then.

2626
01:47:40,560 --> 01:47:41,120
Right.

2627
01:47:41,120 --> 01:47:42,640
No treaties.

2628
01:47:42,640 --> 01:47:47,680
Like there's something like sees bodies moving, but he can't stop the beat.

2629
01:47:47,680 --> 01:47:49,720
No treaties after the war.

2630
01:47:49,720 --> 01:47:51,840
Thinks he can stop it, bring it all to an end.

2631
01:47:51,840 --> 01:47:54,640
But it's him that will break because we'll never bend.

2632
01:47:55,120 --> 01:47:56,240
The music is moving.

2633
01:47:56,240 --> 01:47:57,240
So get up and dance.

2634
01:47:57,240 --> 01:48:01,280
We're four rockin brothers and we're taking a stand together.

2635
01:48:01,280 --> 01:48:03,240
We're ready to fight and defend.

2636
01:48:03,240 --> 01:48:07,360
We'll do what we have to and we'll find a way to bring back the music and do it today.

2637
01:48:07,760 --> 01:48:09,320
Wait, where'd the rhyme go?

2638
01:48:09,320 --> 01:48:10,880
I don't know. I screwed up.

2639
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:12,840
I hope it stays dark forever.

2640
01:48:12,840 --> 01:48:15,880
The last lyric is after the war.

2641
01:48:15,880 --> 01:48:17,960
Take that shredder.

2642
01:48:18,880 --> 01:48:23,800
I love a band doing songs about like, we're going to get him.

2643
01:48:23,960 --> 01:48:27,640
That evil jerk is like, yeah, I wish.

2644
01:48:28,160 --> 01:48:31,880
If a band inexplicably had like a diss track of a mean man.

2645
01:48:32,280 --> 01:48:34,880
Oh, yeah. I mean, like a hip hop, it happens, obviously.

2646
01:48:34,880 --> 01:48:37,040
Sure. True. But I don't know.

2647
01:48:37,040 --> 01:48:41,080
And John Paul wrote angry songs about each other after the Beatles woke up.

2648
01:48:41,160 --> 01:48:44,600
Uh huh. So this is so much in the Beatles tradition.

2649
01:48:45,320 --> 01:48:49,440
This might be a good point to say, you brought up Rafael's singing voice.

2650
01:48:49,440 --> 01:48:50,360
I don't know who Rafael is.

2651
01:48:50,360 --> 01:48:52,440
I don't know who most of the singers are, but I looked up all of them.

2652
01:48:52,440 --> 01:48:56,880
A lot of them not very interesting credits, except for one, the voice of Donatello.

2653
01:48:57,400 --> 01:48:59,440
This is a man named Frank Sims.

2654
01:48:59,440 --> 01:49:02,080
Frank Sims credits are insane.

2655
01:49:02,640 --> 01:49:07,040
He and his brother are the voices on the specific part of the song.

2656
01:49:07,040 --> 01:49:10,000
Living in a material world.

2657
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,960
Oh, wow. And let's dance.

2658
01:49:13,160 --> 01:49:16,720
China girl, modern love, all of those boys songs.

2659
01:49:16,720 --> 01:49:18,160
And he was the back.

2660
01:49:18,160 --> 01:49:21,280
He and his brother backup singers on the entire series Moonlight Tour.

2661
01:49:22,320 --> 01:49:25,800
And finally, perhaps most iconically,

2662
01:49:25,800 --> 01:49:30,920
Frank Sims sang the part Saturday TV Funhouse TV Funhouse.

2663
01:49:31,320 --> 01:49:34,760
That voice is Donatello in this show.

2664
01:49:35,040 --> 01:49:36,960
Also, longtime Bowie backup singer.

2665
01:49:36,960 --> 01:49:39,200
We need to get him on the show and just talk about this show.

2666
01:49:39,360 --> 01:49:42,640
Yes, I think nobody we need to corner the market

2667
01:49:42,640 --> 01:49:45,760
of getting very interesting people with amazing careers on and talking about them,

2668
01:49:45,760 --> 01:49:48,840
talking to them about the smallest sliver, their lowest point.

2669
01:49:50,960 --> 01:49:52,280
So are you OK?

2670
01:49:52,280 --> 01:49:53,600
How did you keep your head together?

2671
01:49:53,600 --> 01:49:56,040
Six weeks of where I didn't have work.

2672
01:49:56,040 --> 01:49:58,200
And so I took whatever this was.

2673
01:49:58,840 --> 01:49:59,880
All right. Let's get let's go.

2674
01:49:59,880 --> 01:50:01,240
We are running.

2675
01:50:01,240 --> 01:50:03,400
Yeah, I know. I need to leave.

2676
01:50:03,400 --> 01:50:05,360
Scott, there's there's stuff.

2677
01:50:05,360 --> 01:50:07,640
This this will be more turtles to come.

2678
01:50:07,640 --> 01:50:09,560
But also, but let's get the cowabunga.

2679
01:50:09,560 --> 01:50:12,200
Sure. Because I it's funny to me.

2680
01:50:12,240 --> 01:50:12,920
All right.

2681
01:50:26,240 --> 01:50:29,000
My favorite part is how lazy the song is.

2682
01:50:29,040 --> 01:50:31,080
That's basically here.

2683
01:50:31,640 --> 01:50:33,680
Let's get on with the show.

2684
01:50:33,680 --> 01:50:35,480
Oh, my God.

2685
01:50:35,480 --> 01:50:37,760
We are the leaders of the same.

2686
01:50:37,760 --> 01:50:39,720
You can't drop that beat.

2687
01:50:39,720 --> 01:50:42,280
We're going to go for the bus.

2688
01:50:42,280 --> 01:50:42,840
He's a turtle.

2689
01:50:42,840 --> 01:50:44,120
Stand tall and proud.

2690
01:50:44,120 --> 01:50:45,920
Just a little bit of 90s.

2691
01:50:45,920 --> 01:50:46,920
Here.

2692
01:50:49,560 --> 01:50:51,080
To rock the ground.

2693
01:50:51,080 --> 01:50:53,480
He forgot to keep singing.

2694
01:50:53,480 --> 01:50:54,840
Different kind of messages.

2695
01:50:54,840 --> 01:50:57,240
What do you implement?

2696
01:50:58,120 --> 01:50:59,600
The space.

2697
01:50:59,600 --> 01:51:02,320
And he said you got to keep pushing the envelope.

2698
01:51:02,320 --> 01:51:04,000
Because if you don't, you'll wind up the door.

2699
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,520
Because when the door gets locked, the door gets locked.

2700
01:51:06,520 --> 01:51:08,520
The winners are the ones who say it's never enough.

2701
01:51:08,520 --> 01:51:10,880
Now, are you listening to what I'm saying?

2702
01:51:10,880 --> 01:51:13,760
I am still a mutant turtle in every way.

2703
01:51:14,560 --> 01:51:15,360
What?

2704
01:51:15,360 --> 01:51:17,520
Oh, it's like there's no one was doubting that.

2705
01:51:17,520 --> 01:51:18,640
But tonight.

2706
01:51:18,640 --> 01:51:19,800
It just takes light.

2707
01:51:19,800 --> 01:51:21,120
There's just these big gaps.

2708
01:51:21,120 --> 01:51:22,960
And you feel like did he forget to keep singing?

2709
01:51:22,960 --> 01:51:24,040
Did he forget to keep.

2710
01:51:24,040 --> 01:51:26,320
We're supposed to put in like cut up samples or something.

2711
01:51:26,320 --> 01:51:28,760
Rolling down the street in my six four.

2712
01:51:28,760 --> 01:51:31,920
Like that's that's all they heard of that song.

2713
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:32,360
Yeah.

2714
01:51:32,360 --> 01:51:37,000
Oh, so every so all rap goes up, like starts from high and then it goes down low.

2715
01:51:37,360 --> 01:51:39,840
It's Michelangelo singing that.

2716
01:51:39,840 --> 01:51:42,160
And then the last part of it is I will I'll just do it.

2717
01:51:42,960 --> 01:51:45,480
What do you do when you can't think of a rhyme?

2718
01:51:46,040 --> 01:51:48,480
Personally speaking, it's ending time.

2719
01:51:49,280 --> 01:51:50,960
But that is a rhyme.

2720
01:51:50,960 --> 01:51:54,080
He should have said, like, what do you do when you can't think of a rhyme?

2721
01:51:54,080 --> 01:51:54,440
So.

2722
01:51:54,440 --> 01:51:55,560
Wrap it out.

2723
01:51:55,560 --> 01:51:56,560
Yeah. Yeah.

2724
01:51:56,560 --> 01:51:58,480
But the song is very boring.

2725
01:51:58,480 --> 01:52:00,760
That song should be a lot more fun.

2726
01:52:00,760 --> 01:52:01,040
Yeah.

2727
01:52:01,040 --> 01:52:03,480
This is the rap song where they introduce themselves.

2728
01:52:03,480 --> 01:52:06,840
The intro themselves should be a lot more interesting, musically interesting.

2729
01:52:07,120 --> 01:52:08,400
And that it should be fun.

2730
01:52:08,400 --> 01:52:09,600
And it's very boring.

2731
01:52:09,600 --> 01:52:12,600
It's probably that it's maybe my least favorite next to tubing.

2732
01:52:13,200 --> 01:52:14,920
Well, let me hear.

2733
01:52:14,920 --> 01:52:16,840
Put it on now while I start talking about it.

2734
01:52:16,840 --> 01:52:19,240
Let me play my clip of Follow Your Heart.

2735
01:52:19,440 --> 01:52:20,200
Oh, yeah.

2736
01:52:20,200 --> 01:52:21,360
Song on the.

2737
01:52:21,360 --> 01:52:24,000
Let's just try to not as horrible as this will be.

2738
01:52:24,160 --> 01:52:27,040
Try. Let's try to not talk and see how we do.

2739
01:52:28,760 --> 01:52:31,120
Follow your heart.

2740
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:36,320
Follow your heart.

2741
01:52:37,200 --> 01:52:39,760
Follow your heart.

2742
01:52:41,520 --> 01:52:45,440
He can try anything to tear us apart,

2743
01:52:45,720 --> 01:52:48,760
but there's one thing that's still clear

2744
01:52:49,360 --> 01:52:53,240
that there's no way that he'll get inside of our hearts.

2745
01:52:53,400 --> 01:52:56,840
Just remember that we're still here.

2746
01:52:57,560 --> 01:53:00,920
The time has come to change it all.

2747
01:53:01,400 --> 01:53:04,560
To wash away your fear.

2748
01:53:05,200 --> 01:53:08,840
We only have to stick together.

2749
01:53:09,160 --> 01:53:10,880
But the time has come.

2750
01:53:14,560 --> 01:53:16,920
Is it a mistake that there's no music?

2751
01:53:17,040 --> 01:53:19,160
Did somebody forget to actually Simpson style?

2752
01:53:19,160 --> 01:53:20,920
Did somebody forget to hit the button?

2753
01:53:20,920 --> 01:53:22,200
Very possible.

2754
01:53:22,200 --> 01:53:23,400
It's very possible.

2755
01:53:23,400 --> 01:53:24,320
It's choreographed.

2756
01:53:24,320 --> 01:53:25,920
They're dancing a little bit during that.

2757
01:53:25,920 --> 01:53:27,760
Why would it only be a voice and then right?

2758
01:53:27,760 --> 01:53:31,040
It sounds and it's not like, oh, my God, what an amazing voice.

2759
01:53:31,040 --> 01:53:34,040
We should, of course, do this a cappella or they're like all harmonizing

2760
01:53:34,040 --> 01:53:35,040
with each other.

2761
01:53:35,040 --> 01:53:38,360
It just feels it does feel like he's like a little hesitant to like,

2762
01:53:38,360 --> 01:53:40,040
oh, shit, is it going to come in or?

2763
01:53:40,040 --> 01:53:41,880
Yeah. And making it up as he goes.

2764
01:53:41,880 --> 01:53:45,840
And then there's a remember the things that we find.

2765
01:53:45,840 --> 01:53:49,080
We get on the fire and that shred is a jerk.

2766
01:53:49,160 --> 01:53:54,720
Yeah, I don't like to work and there was like five seconds

2767
01:53:54,720 --> 01:53:58,200
where it sounded like the isolated track from the LCD sound system.

2768
01:53:58,200 --> 01:54:00,360
So all my friends

2769
01:54:00,360 --> 01:54:02,680
spend less than years trying to get away.

2770
01:54:03,880 --> 01:54:04,760
Whoa.

2771
01:54:04,760 --> 01:54:09,720
A little bit. I wrote down that it's sort of like craft work or Bowie's heroes.

2772
01:54:10,160 --> 01:54:11,640
Incredibly spare.

2773
01:54:11,640 --> 01:54:16,320
Yeah. Avant Garde experimental just actually that rocket sound feels very 70s.

2774
01:54:16,560 --> 01:54:18,720
If you think of it as minimalist art rock,

2775
01:54:19,160 --> 01:54:22,840
that's one thing. Yeah, I think I think that's probably Shredder's

2776
01:54:22,840 --> 01:54:25,080
favorite song on the album because it has the least music.

2777
01:54:25,560 --> 01:54:28,560
I that's OK. That's a moderate amount.

2778
01:54:28,560 --> 01:54:29,760
I'd still rather know.

2779
01:54:29,760 --> 01:54:32,360
But hey, no instruments. You're getting somewhere.

2780
01:54:32,480 --> 01:54:35,400
I tweeted at Bob, Bob Bijon.

2781
01:54:35,440 --> 01:54:36,520
Oh, yes.

2782
01:54:36,520 --> 01:54:39,760
This is actually now the thing I teased earlier, because there's no good results.

2783
01:54:39,880 --> 01:54:43,720
But I asked because I found the thing that said that there were more songs written

2784
01:54:44,480 --> 01:54:46,840
and then for maybe the second show, which I have those songs.

2785
01:54:46,880 --> 01:54:49,320
There's a couple of new songs for the second version of this.

2786
01:54:49,320 --> 01:54:50,880
That was happening.

2787
01:54:50,880 --> 01:54:55,080
But I'm saying like there we have to find the full Follow Your Heart

2788
01:54:55,080 --> 01:54:57,920
because it's not on the actual album.

2789
01:54:57,920 --> 01:55:00,800
No. So we have to we will not know that until we hear

2790
01:55:00,800 --> 01:55:02,720
what a studio version of Follow Your Heart was.

2791
01:55:02,720 --> 01:55:05,440
And I'm going to ask if Bob will tweet back at me.

2792
01:55:06,400 --> 01:55:10,760
I hope. How strange would it be for him as a major Microsoft figure

2793
01:55:10,760 --> 01:55:12,840
to suddenly get the specific question?

2794
01:55:12,840 --> 01:55:15,800
So did the album cut a Follow Your Heart instruments

2795
01:55:15,800 --> 01:55:18,200
or was it acapella like the live version or was that a mistake?

2796
01:55:18,200 --> 01:55:19,640
And were you influenced by Kraftwerk?

2797
01:55:19,640 --> 01:55:22,320
All right. I will actually tweet that now at him as well.

2798
01:55:22,880 --> 01:55:25,680
Then to my original tweet. Oh, boy.

2799
01:55:26,840 --> 01:55:29,960
So, OK, there's so much I don't I'm not trying to wrap it up,

2800
01:55:29,960 --> 01:55:31,280
but I literally need to leave.

2801
01:55:31,280 --> 01:55:33,880
I mean, hey, I could leave and keep going all of the Japan episode.

2802
01:55:34,040 --> 01:55:35,480
But you guys keep going.

2803
01:55:35,480 --> 01:55:37,720
But what else?

2804
01:55:37,720 --> 01:55:40,880
Count on us is brings it home in a nice way.

2805
01:55:40,880 --> 01:55:44,280
April ballot is, you know, boring. It's pretty boring.

2806
01:55:44,280 --> 01:55:45,880
I like to play a little bit of section of it.

2807
01:55:45,880 --> 01:55:47,320
Right. We can talk.

2808
01:55:47,320 --> 01:55:47,920
You want?

2809
01:55:49,760 --> 01:55:53,960
Nothing I would do would make me scared.

2810
01:55:54,880 --> 01:55:57,400
Nothing I would do would make me scared.

2811
01:56:01,640 --> 01:56:03,400
Like another like this to.

2812
01:56:03,400 --> 01:56:06,000
I'm scared. Oh, no, chimes.

2813
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:07,520
I hate music.

2814
01:56:07,520 --> 01:56:09,000
I don't win chimes.

2815
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:13,160
Like if you spray perfume in front of you or cologne, you walk through it.

2816
01:56:13,680 --> 01:56:15,840
You get the faintest sense.

2817
01:56:15,840 --> 01:56:17,440
It's like that.

2818
01:56:17,440 --> 01:56:21,720
But with total eclipse of the heart, but they do like the faintest in the distance.

2819
01:56:21,720 --> 01:56:23,360
It's playing in the distance.

2820
01:56:23,360 --> 01:56:25,920
Yeah, it's kind of and they kind of heard it.

2821
01:56:25,920 --> 01:56:28,160
And they're like, all right, something sort of like that.

2822
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:32,760
And then the April ballot is basically just leading into count on us.

2823
01:56:32,960 --> 01:56:33,840
Pretty much. Yeah.

2824
01:56:33,840 --> 01:56:36,280
It's like she doesn't even get her own like full thought.

2825
01:56:36,760 --> 01:56:38,000
They shortchanged her.

2826
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:42,960
If you're talking Bechtel test, the song is entirely about maybe my friends.

2827
01:56:42,960 --> 01:56:46,480
Well, yes, help me break me out of this rope.

2828
01:56:46,800 --> 01:56:51,480
And and then in the ultimate insult to injury,

2829
01:56:51,680 --> 01:56:54,160
what's the name of this April ballad?

2830
01:56:54,680 --> 01:56:56,440
April. Yeah, right.

2831
01:56:56,440 --> 01:57:00,680
It didn't even doesn't get doesn't kick ass, doesn't defend herself.

2832
01:57:01,480 --> 01:57:05,320
It doesn't like just talks about them and then doesn't get a name of the song.

2833
01:57:05,760 --> 01:57:07,960
I couldn't even be count on us. Part one and two.

2834
01:57:08,240 --> 01:57:10,240
Yeah. Kind of intro.

2835
01:57:10,240 --> 01:57:13,760
Countless like right, Koda or prelude.

2836
01:57:14,800 --> 01:57:17,800
And then they take her voice away, Ariel style.

2837
01:57:18,160 --> 01:57:19,280
They just like and that too.

2838
01:57:19,280 --> 01:57:20,840
And then he takes her voice away.

2839
01:57:20,840 --> 01:57:23,600
So she can't sing anymore.

2840
01:57:23,600 --> 01:57:28,160
And then and then they get rid of shredder and they like

2841
01:57:28,640 --> 01:57:31,360
put them in a box and it like zaps.

2842
01:57:31,360 --> 01:57:32,640
And that's that.

2843
01:57:32,640 --> 01:57:36,120
And then one of them says, wait, we got to fix April's voice.

2844
01:57:36,120 --> 01:57:38,560
And she says, it was fixed.

2845
01:57:39,440 --> 01:57:42,440
I don't know why it was earlier.

2846
01:57:42,720 --> 01:57:43,960
OK, great.

2847
01:57:43,960 --> 01:57:47,320
And then they all sing count on us, which she doesn't have a part in.

2848
01:57:47,440 --> 01:57:48,840
Right. She's not allowed to sing the song.

2849
01:57:48,840 --> 01:57:51,920
She just sang a little of again with her friends.

2850
01:57:52,480 --> 01:57:55,120
Yeah. It's not like all the characters,

2851
01:57:55,120 --> 01:57:56,920
but the Broadway people should know more than anybody.

2852
01:57:56,920 --> 01:57:58,320
And then they all.

2853
01:57:58,320 --> 01:58:00,320
Can you hear the people sing at the end?

2854
01:58:00,320 --> 01:58:01,680
No, no, no. Just turtles still.

2855
01:58:01,680 --> 01:58:03,880
And it's funny, she always had to be the damsel in distress,

2856
01:58:03,880 --> 01:58:06,520
but the original April action figure came with a gun.

2857
01:58:07,520 --> 01:58:08,440
Oh, yeah.

2858
01:58:08,440 --> 01:58:09,960
Camera and a gun.

2859
01:58:09,960 --> 01:58:11,440
Sorry, sorry.

2860
01:58:11,440 --> 01:58:13,920
I attacked you with count on us.

2861
01:58:13,920 --> 01:58:15,880
Also, a pretty good, pretty good song. Yeah.

2862
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:25,240
See the world in the cynical eyes.

2863
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:34,600
This is very Def Leppard.

2864
01:58:34,600 --> 01:58:35,440
Yeah.

2865
01:58:36,520 --> 01:58:37,360
No.

2866
01:58:44,480 --> 01:58:47,800
If you had to rank, I think I'm going to pizza power coming out of our shells.

2867
01:58:48,960 --> 01:58:51,240
Count on us in descending order.

2868
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:53,480
Walk straight.

2869
01:58:53,480 --> 01:58:55,520
Heaps of power.

2870
01:58:57,640 --> 01:59:00,800
Coming out of maybe no treaties, then coming out of our shells.

2871
01:59:00,800 --> 01:59:02,120
No treaties?

2872
01:59:02,120 --> 01:59:03,480
I don't know. Maybe not.

2873
01:59:03,480 --> 01:59:05,440
I have to think about that.

2874
01:59:05,480 --> 01:59:07,960
Coming out of the shells.

2875
01:59:08,720 --> 01:59:10,760
Count on us in two.

2876
01:59:10,760 --> 01:59:12,360
Wow, two things in there.

2877
01:59:12,360 --> 01:59:15,000
I hate to. I hate to.

2878
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,960
I think it's the worst.

2879
01:59:18,960 --> 01:59:20,400
There is. I don't have it.

2880
01:59:20,400 --> 01:59:22,080
So I have because we're going to wrap up here.

2881
01:59:22,080 --> 01:59:24,200
There's going to be more because I will tell you this.

2882
01:59:24,200 --> 01:59:25,560
I found it. It's too late.

2883
01:59:25,560 --> 01:59:27,920
I should have started researching months ago.

2884
01:59:27,920 --> 01:59:31,440
I found a blog that at one point hosted Spanish version

2885
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:36,880
and the Hebrew version of coming out of our shells tour.

2886
01:59:37,480 --> 01:59:40,360
And I corresponded with the person who runs the blog.

2887
01:59:40,760 --> 01:59:44,960
And they said, Oh, are you are you the person who asked me for this weeks ago

2888
01:59:45,600 --> 01:59:47,440
to reupload? And I said, I don't think so.

2889
01:59:47,440 --> 01:59:48,400
I just did this today.

2890
01:59:48,400 --> 01:59:51,640
And they're like, well, I can't do it right away.

2891
01:59:51,640 --> 01:59:54,000
But over the weekend, I can do it.

2892
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,560
So I wasn't going to be like, well, we're recording tomorrow.

2893
01:59:56,560 --> 01:59:59,360
And I said, well, that's a good, good excuse to do a two part.

2894
01:59:59,360 --> 02:00:02,040
There's other turtles in theme parks and stuff.

2895
02:00:02,320 --> 02:00:04,440
Yeah, there's some catch all turtles thing.

2896
02:00:04,440 --> 02:00:07,280
And there was a there's a good like Christmas turtles rap in.

2897
02:00:07,280 --> 02:00:10,040
And that is pretty YouTube popular.

2898
02:00:10,880 --> 02:00:15,720
Yeah. And there's a part two like there was so much to say to called what?

2899
02:00:15,720 --> 02:00:18,800
Getting down in your town, down in your town.

2900
02:00:19,320 --> 02:00:23,360
I do now if we could do another turtles episode, I do not think getting down

2901
02:00:23,360 --> 02:00:25,120
in your town deserves an episode.

2902
02:00:25,120 --> 02:00:26,920
No, it is much lazier.

2903
02:00:27,400 --> 02:00:29,360
They kind of did the math like, how do we do another tour?

2904
02:00:29,360 --> 02:00:32,840
But less sets, less shredder, less

2905
02:00:33,880 --> 02:00:37,360
no Baxter, no splinter Casey Jones.

2906
02:00:37,360 --> 02:00:40,200
But that doesn't have to be like a contracted like he looks like.

2907
02:00:40,840 --> 02:00:42,680
Yeah, it's just some guy we found.

2908
02:00:42,680 --> 02:00:44,760
It'll be a different bum in every town.

2909
02:00:45,800 --> 02:00:47,560
Let's put a mask on him. Nobody will know.

2910
02:00:47,560 --> 02:00:52,440
Yes. And there and that features a lazier tube and called Pizza USA.

2911
02:00:52,480 --> 02:00:55,880
Yes, I have. And then I there's a there's three songs.

2912
02:00:55,880 --> 02:00:56,720
I only have two of them.

2913
02:00:56,720 --> 02:00:59,120
I have Pizza USA and I have getting down in your town.

2914
02:00:59,600 --> 02:01:01,840
But supposedly there were more songs written for this,

2915
02:01:01,840 --> 02:01:03,840
which is what I've asked about.

2916
02:01:03,840 --> 02:01:06,880
So I'm hoping there might be a treasure trove of besides

2917
02:01:07,400 --> 02:01:09,680
and things left on the cutting room floor because they're for

2918
02:01:10,120 --> 02:01:12,320
because they were hoping because they tour this is Six Flags

2919
02:01:12,320 --> 02:01:16,680
and they were hoping to then launch another giant tour the next year.

2920
02:01:16,720 --> 02:01:18,320
Oh, and did it not go? No.

2921
02:01:18,320 --> 02:01:21,800
And then it was over. Oh, well, that's why I think they were gearing up

2922
02:01:21,800 --> 02:01:25,000
to maybe do an expanded version of getting down in your town

2923
02:01:25,160 --> 02:01:27,280
with other songs that have been written.

2924
02:01:27,280 --> 02:01:30,080
And who knows where those are? OK.

2925
02:01:30,080 --> 02:01:33,600
So so we're going to have to do we're investigating.

2926
02:01:33,600 --> 02:01:35,320
So we have to take an intermission.

2927
02:01:35,320 --> 02:01:37,720
We'll do are coming to your town.

2928
02:01:37,720 --> 02:01:41,520
Can we're going to get down in your town soon enough.

2929
02:01:41,840 --> 02:01:45,400
Turtles to secret of the extra songs.

2930
02:01:48,400 --> 02:01:49,240
This is getting down.

2931
02:01:49,240 --> 02:01:52,080
You know, I want to listen. Oh, sorry.

2932
02:01:52,760 --> 02:01:55,480
And we all see this on a four track.

2933
02:01:59,160 --> 02:02:02,560
You can tell it's certainly in the same vein, the voice of the other

2934
02:02:02,800 --> 02:02:05,120
the other show that's got a long intro.

2935
02:02:05,120 --> 02:02:06,400
I should have cut it.

2936
02:02:08,760 --> 02:02:12,200
But they're still doing this sort of like a jangly America pop. Yeah.

2937
02:02:13,880 --> 02:02:18,720
The night we met, I knew I needed him.

2938
02:02:18,720 --> 02:02:20,200
So

2939
02:02:22,080 --> 02:02:23,080
now

2940
02:02:24,400 --> 02:02:26,280
Joe Joe just begun.

2941
02:02:26,280 --> 02:02:28,440
It's very, very sticks.

2942
02:02:28,440 --> 02:02:30,000
So Tommy Shaw.

2943
02:02:32,200 --> 02:02:34,560
For each of you, each and every one.

2944
02:02:36,400 --> 02:02:38,360
You're not in your town.

2945
02:02:45,040 --> 02:02:46,920
Kind of sweet, you know.

2946
02:02:47,480 --> 02:02:49,520
All right. Well, you know, we're going to get to a lot more.

2947
02:02:49,520 --> 02:02:50,680
That's not an empty.

2948
02:02:50,680 --> 02:02:53,000
But I think now we have to act as if

2949
02:02:53,880 --> 02:02:56,680
shredders, the harmonic convergence controller

2950
02:02:57,080 --> 02:03:02,120
has shown up in your apartment and ceased the recording of the episode.

2951
02:03:02,480 --> 02:03:06,880
Shredder has caused all of the equipment to stop functioning.

2952
02:03:07,240 --> 02:03:11,120
He's declared, I hate I hate podcasts about music.

2953
02:03:11,840 --> 02:03:13,640
They're the worst other topics.

2954
02:03:13,640 --> 02:03:16,920
They're OK. But music, I think that's the worst.

2955
02:03:17,560 --> 02:03:20,400
Those are the episodes that I skip.

2956
02:03:20,960 --> 02:03:23,320
Yeah. So, yeah, right now, shredder is here

2957
02:03:24,240 --> 02:03:26,520
in the form of Edwin farting on me.

2958
02:03:27,200 --> 02:03:28,560
Everyone is farting on Jason.

2959
02:03:28,560 --> 02:03:30,320
He's also shedding a ton right now, too.

2960
02:03:30,320 --> 02:03:31,320
All right.

2961
02:03:32,240 --> 02:03:38,760
D Oda fire, his D harmonious Oda fire is poisoning the atmosphere.

2962
02:03:39,080 --> 02:03:40,840
We got to get out of here now.

2963
02:03:40,840 --> 02:03:42,080
We'll be back.
