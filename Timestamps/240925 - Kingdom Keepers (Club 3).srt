1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,980
He found himself standing next to the flag pole in Town Square in the heart of

2
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:37,060
the Magic Kingdom in his pajamas. How he'd gotten there he had no idea. His last

3
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:44,180
memory was climbing into bed. It felt like only minutes earlier. Oh wow okay so

4
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:49,020
that's a I assume an excerpt from the book that I read. That's how it starts

5
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:53,500
that's the very beginning of the book. That's not a page of your journal from a

6
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:58,580
couple nights ago? No that is. Okay just making sure I just I think I thought I

7
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:02,940
recognized it from the book but I just wanted to make sure. No it's funny you

8
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:09,100
say that because I had a very distressing dream last night. Oh okay. That Matt

9
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:12,780
Newell and Mary Holland were getting married again at the Hard Rock Hotel.

10
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:19,380
That's distressing. Well cuz cuz some of the restaurants at City Walk were

11
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:25,540
included in the dining like oh you can go here and get a sandwich or you can go

12
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:29,380
here and get a plat- and I was trying to run around to do them all. Okay hold on

13
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:34,900
hello Club 3. Hello Club 3. It's Mike and Jason here. Hold on we'll have a message from Scott

14
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:37,620
one second but I want to unpack what you're saying. The dream was that you

15
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:40,540
were at the Hard Rock Hotel do you know like the one in San Diego the one in

16
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:44,620
Vegas? The one in Orlando. The one in Orlando. The one in Orlando when apparently when I

17
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:50,140
dream I end up in Orlando much like the Kingdom Keepers themselves. So it was

18
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:52,960
distressing in the sense that you didn't know where the you could get the

19
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,640
sandwiches that you were comfortable with? Yeah I was trying to run around

20
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:02,280
because like the Dead Coconut Club was included. Okay. So it was just distressing that the kitchen was included.

21
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,000
The nightmare was that the layout of City Walk was a different

22
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,220
layout than you were familiar with. Well we only had two or three hours for the

23
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:15,840
reception. Okay. And I couldn't even remember if I packed a suit. Oh well

24
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,160
that's distressing. So I was distressed. Yeah if you didn't have a suit for a wedding. Yeah I get that.

25
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,200
You would have had to wear you would have had to go to the t-shirt stand

26
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,280
where the guy airbrushes stuff like what I did. I got the I Love City Walk shirt.

27
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,520
You could have had a guy airbrush a picture. Congratulations. Well that or a

28
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:35,760
picture of a suit on a t-shirt. Oh that's even better. And then on the back it

29
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,600
would have said congrats or something and then he could have spray paint. He

30
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,060
could have like airbrushed your pants. You could have brought him some white

31
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:47,240
jeans and then he could have airbrushed sort of formal pants onto the white jeans.

32
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:51,480
Where were you in the dream? Because for whatever reason around every corner was

33
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:56,440
Nicole Kidman. Nicole Kidman was there. Nicole Kidman was there a lot and she

34
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:02,000
looked very elegant as she often does. Well Miss Chase Miss Chase Meridian of

35
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,560
course she's gonna look elegant believe me. I well I would have astral projected

36
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,820
into that dream if I knew it was happening I'm sorry. But look welcome to

37
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:16,000
Club 3. We have a message from Scott here he says I hello Club 3 subscribers

38
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,400
I'm sorry I can't be there. I promise it is for a good and positive reason. I am

39
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:26,240
not just avoiding reading Kingdom Keepers please and he says be extremely

40
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:31,480
thorough as to what library or online program Jason used to obtain this book.

41
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:39,320
May the DH eyes be with you Scott. That is his message for all of you and he

42
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:45,360
will return to the show very soon. Very soon. Great well look I'm already all

43
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:51,320
over his requests so I used the Libby app to borrow a Kindle copy of this book

44
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:57,120
and I borrowed a collection that was the first three books. Now I only read book

45
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,440
one and the first couple chapters of book two. Okay well we'll get to more of this

46
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:07,080
sort of these details these tantalizing details these interesting details. I'll

47
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:12,440
explain how I absorbed the book after this but we do have to it's Club 3 we

48
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:16,280
do have to do all the administrative stuff. Scott generally handles all

49
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:22,520
that because next month Club 3 becomes Crypt 3. That is right. You remember that

50
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:27,320
Jason? I do remember that. Because it's Halloween and it's spooky so last year's

51
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:31,520
Halloween runner-up was the nightmare experiment which was Hong Kong

52
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,560
Disneyland's attempt at the horror attraction at a horror attraction. Oh a

53
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:40,560
fascinating subject. Yes well yeah it seems like the scariest thing any

54
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:45,640
Disney parks ever done on purpose. Not just like a spectro magic doll face man

55
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:51,160
or something. Paul Lynn Halloween special is also going into the poll because it

56
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:56,840
was the runner-up in Carlson's Clash of the Kitsch. And now we need three more

57
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:02,240
spooky topics so leave your suggestions in the patreon comments. Jason do you

58
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,880
have anything you want to throw out to the listeners that you think about as

59
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:13,440
far as Halloween? You don't have to have that. No I will let I do not want to tip the scales. Does anyone

60
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:18,600
want to just say I want to hear about Jason's dream journal to hear about the

61
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,440
different malls he goes to and the nightmares he has where the malls are

62
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:26,200
shuffled around a little bit. They're a little different. They're a little

63
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:30,680
different yeah. Because that's yeah you could keep a journal for maybe a week

64
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:38,600
like how often do you have nightmares? I don't know I dream pretty regularly.

65
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:45,260
Yeah. Traumatically though or? Not not very bad traumatically. Okay not like

66
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:50,360
last night. No I did wake up in a bit of a state you know. Okay sure yeah yeah but

67
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:54,560
I'm just saying would your like a seven-day dream journal be interesting? I

68
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,080
don't think so yeah I don't think there'd be enough. Okay it would have to

69
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,000
be a month long so if your vote if you're throwing on a topic would be a

70
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,760
month of Jason's dream journal and that would have enough juicy topics to talk

71
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:10,440
about on a club three or a crypt three. I think I'd really rather some sort of

72
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:14,880
interesting theme park topic but if the people say. If the people demand it.

73
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:21,960
Yeah. Jason's to nightmares which maybe that's look that's a future I

74
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:27,000
floated this idea out before to my co-hosts of doing a full podcast a ride

75
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:33,840
haunt a full maze live in person one day but maybe yeah that's Jason's to

76
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,840
nightmares maybe that's maybe that's down the road we collect enough to

77
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:42,840
nightmares and then we're by the way we're referencing Jimmy Fallon's haunted

78
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:48,840
maze or mole. Rock-a-Pillar Plaza. He's doing this is a not a joke he's doing his own

79
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:54,040
Hollywood Horror Nights style maze. And we're looking into it very strongly. Okay

80
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:58,720
that being said let's get on to today's topic. The Kingdom Keepers which was a

81
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,520
suggestion from Logan. This is what Logan said he said club three suggestion the

82
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:08,200
boys read through and discuss or and discusses at least the first Kingdom

83
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,760
Keepers book. The story about a group of middle schoolers who wake up as

84
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:17,120
holograms and battle Disney villains at night at Walt Disney World. And then

85
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:22,720
Malia chimed in absolutely cosine Eisner era shenanigans in a perfect 2005 time

86
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:29,480
capsule. VMK animatronics come to life. So here we are Kingdom Keepers.

87
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:35,520
Kingdom Keepers which I had long seen I had heard about I think I knew the

88
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,720
premise. I didn't realize this was so old I didn't realize it's been this long of

89
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:45,960
the Kingdom Keepers books have been coming out. Well what I saw it was that

90
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:52,700
this was kind of in conjunction with the happiest celebration on earth. So Disney

91
00:07:52,700 --> 00:08:00,180
lands 50th anniversary. The books were launched as was Virtual Magic Kingdom.

92
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:07,860
Right. Which comes into play in the first book and Virtual Magic Kingdom shut down

93
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:13,900
around 2008 and they had to work that into the books. Yes there's a lot of

94
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:18,980
synergy in the book. Yeah. And I honestly I was sort of ignorant to this I didn't

95
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:22,180
realize these were official Disney sponsored books. I almost thought these

96
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:27,060
were sort of like unofficial like Disney but I thought it was almost like Escape

97
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:32,340
from Tomorrow or whatever that gorilla filmmaking Disney World book was at

98
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:37,420
first. Yes. But this is officially like Disney approved. Disney granted the

99
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:41,260
author Ridley Pearson that's his name right Ridley Pearson. They grants him

100
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:46,540
access to the parks after dark. Yes. And I think at some point he said like

101
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:51,380
they're over like 30 times he went into the parks at night. In the introduction

102
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:57,940
he talks about being shown around by Jason Sorrell. Right. Former Imagineer who

103
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:03,660
wrote the Haunted Mansion book that we discuss a lot. Yes Jay thank you Jason

104
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:08,780
for that content. Yeah. Every year. Every year. And we say this page from your book is

105
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:19,340
good. Yeah. We like it. And has written other books about the parks. Yeah. Yeah so

106
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:24,740
he got backstage access. Right. Which is cool. I mean I'm very envious of that

107
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:28,700
because that is like you think about the premise of like OK you get to go into

108
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:32,740
Disneyland after dark get to go to Disney World after dark. What goes on. Now

109
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:37,740
here's what I would say. What did they actually learn being in the parks after

110
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:43,100
dark. Was that so necessary. Like the pirates don't come to life for real

111
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:50,540
after dark in Disney. No. There are not real padlocked cells under. Right. Pirates

112
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:57,420
and Caribbean. I think he probably learned the trash disposal tubes. Right. You

113
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:01,140
know. So he's like so I guess what I'm getting at is like do you think on some

114
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:06,700
level the author was like I bet I can get some free Disney like after I can go

115
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:10,260
into Disneyland after dark and like enjoy myself. I think he probably had a

116
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:13,780
little fun with it. I would think so. I'm just saying like yeah you can your

117
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:17,420
imagination runs wild. But like what did he learn for the books. Like he learned

118
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:21,780
how they like polish the splash mountain vehicle like the log while they're

119
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:28,740
closed or he probably learned that there there is an apartment above the fire

120
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:33,660
house. But that's at Disneyland. Did they build the apartment. I don't think the

121
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:38,500
apartment is above. Is there actually an apartment above the fire station in in

122
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:42,100
Disney world. That's a good question. I don't know. Is there a weird old man who

123
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:47,140
lives up there. There's not a weird old man that lives up there for real. Could

124
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:52,700
you ever meet Wayne in the parks. So I don't know. I don't think you could meet

125
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:56,420
Wayne which is a character from Kingdom Keeper. So really what I'm getting at is

126
00:10:56,420 --> 00:11:00,380
this guy milked Disney. He's smart. He milked Disney for a bunch of fun like

127
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:03,340
walks around the park when no one was there. Sure. In the middle of the night.

128
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:07,980
Yeah. But I think you could have come up with all this stuff without it. That's

129
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:12,660
what I'm saying. You know he's written some all ages graphic novels for D.C.

130
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:17,420
called Super Sons. Yeah. I hope he melts them. I hope he went to the room the

131
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:23,060
closet the criterion closet of D.C. got a bunch of trades. Oh yeah. Sure. Well

132
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:28,020
maybe like he didn't adopt like sons like for real just like to research. I

133
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:31,940
can't speak to that. I haven't read his full. Yeah. I'm just saying I think he

134
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:35,620
uses imagination. That's all I'm saying. But anyway this is this I will say this

135
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:40,780
these books the premise of them is very good. It's very exciting to any like

136
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:47,020
theme park kid dork. Yes. Adults. And I had not read them. I am on record as

137
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:53,660
being a bad reader. Sure. So first of all if anyone has a tip on how to read

138
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:59,260
better and I can read I know how to read. I know the words my vocabulary is fine.

139
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:05,820
You've heard the show but I think I have some level of ADHD that like prevents

140
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:11,500
me from focusing well when I'm reading. Oh my attention spans shop. I know but

141
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:16,940
you're a good you read though. I do. Yeah. I fight again. It is a fight. I sat

142
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:23,940
down so many times to get through this book and it was like for one thing I

143
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:33,220
always forget like oh why a genre stuff is sometimes very long. Yes. Because kids

144
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:38,820
who are big readers want it to keep going. They want to keep free. They want

145
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:43,860
more. They want more. They want more. Yes. And I'm an old man with a limited

146
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:48,820
time. Yes. Just give me what the give me the flashy stuff. Sure. You know just

147
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:52,580
give me the gist of it and let's move on. So yes it's a struggle for me. So

148
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:58,540
because of that I did an audio book on an audio book. OK. Hey you know that's

149
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:02,300
great. I mean you laughed a lot though. He's like because I gave up I guess

150
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:06,820
really effectively I gave up and I was like I can't read it. I can't read. I just

151
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:12,460
didn't consider an audio book. I didn't know if audio books were available for

152
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:17,420
these are produced. Oh sure they are. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I did a free trial on

153
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:22,700
audio book dot com. I didn't even use audible. Oh OK. So I can cancel after

154
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:27,580
that. Great. And I did. Yeah I did the first one via audio book and then

155
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:31,820
because I just wanted to make sure I knew it. I read the Cliff Notes on a

156
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:36,300
different Web site with a different free trial. Yeah. I wanted to make sure that

157
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:41,500
today for my book report I did a good job. Well you want to know. Remember all

158
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:47,380
the background of Finn and Maybeck and Philby and Willa and Charlene. Right. And

159
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:50,540
you pulled that out off the top of your head. You did not look at your thing

160
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:53,620
because I had to look at my notes to remember the names of all the people

161
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:58,460
because they're my friends now. Because you're like an unofficial kingdom keeper.

162
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:05,300
Yeah basically. Yeah. But I just port to like the Hard Rock Hotel and Universal

163
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:10,220
apparently. All right. Yes. You when you dream you go to a city walk in Orlando.

164
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,980
Yeah. Well that is I was going to actually ask that at the end of the

165
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:17,620
episode of like where we would want to keep which kingdoms would we want to

166
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:21,180
keep. But I guess we could talk about you would just be city walk or Islands of

167
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:24,660
Adventure. Yeah. I'd prefer to be at Islands of Adventure and I'd prefer to

168
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:29,980
be a little less stressed out. Yeah sure. Well but keeping a kingdom is a

169
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:35,180
stressful job. That is true. So I don't know if you really want to be a full

170
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:43,220
kingdom keeper. I think I would spend a lot more time trying to practice and

171
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:46,940
harness the hologram powers. Right. You're more of like you would be like a

172
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:51,540
kingdom enjoyer or something. Well I'd be a kingdom enjoyer but then a kingdom

173
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:57,180
student. Like I would just again and again try to phase through a trash can.

174
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:02,380
Because we've known some keepers in our day. Oh yeah. And podcast the ride and it

175
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:06,940
is a stressful position. Absolutely. Hey you podcast long enough you're gonna

176
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:12,020
encounter some keepers. Right. So yeah let's so we've kind of given you the gist

177
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:17,660
here of what this is. But yes it's like night at the museum at Disney World. What

178
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:23,780
happens after all the guests leave and the pixie dust and the magic starts and

179
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:29,780
what happens I guess is that evil spirits take over and try to take over

180
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:35,820
the park. Yeah what the overtakers. Right and they're called overtakers which not

181
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:41,100
undertakers. Now that I'm hearing that out loud I'm like oh that is a very on the

182
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:46,620
nose name. Yeah. They are trying to take over the overtakers. Yeah. So there's a

183
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:51,660
lot of I don't want to say it's like kind of clunky mythology but it's like

184
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:57,820
slightly clunky in sort of a setup way in my mind. Yeah I think the setup is more

185
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:03,180
I think the exit once it gets moving I don't think it's very clunky but it can

186
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:12,060
I. Yeah. Okay these five kids they all have a particular set of skills. Right

187
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:22,420
these are like 13 year old kids. Yes 13 14 and so they they all five of them

188
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:28,380
audition and get scanned for a new Disney parks endeavor called the DH eyes.

189
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:38,340
Right. The there's multiple is it Disney digital hologram interactive like

190
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:43,940
there's multiple explanations for the acronym. Right. Basically there are tour

191
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:49,620
guide holograms that show up on Main Street. Right. And so they get paid for

192
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:56,220
this they get like unlimited park passes but if they're going to the park that

193
00:16:56,260 --> 00:17:01,220
their hologram is in they have to wear a disguise. This is what I'm saying about

194
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:05,660
being clunky a little bit in the setup. I'm just like getting through this and going what is this.

195
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:12,340
There's more. So they discover that when they go to sleep they become their

196
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:20,100
partial partial human partial hologram within the park. Uh-huh. And there is an

197
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:26,180
old man named Wayne who is an Imagineer but he appears to be a million years old

198
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:34,860
and he worked with Walt. Right. Yes and he gives them a mission that they have to solve a fable.

199
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:48,140
Right. Of Walt's stone cutters quill. Yes. Right. OK. So is there more? Well I there there is more

200
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:52,580
because you get to see that these kids kind of become little micro celebrities.

201
00:17:52,820 --> 00:18:00,380
They essentially did predict influencers of like the kids when they go to the parks if they get

202
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:06,460
recognized people freak out. Right. You know and Disney this is one of the I thought one of the

203
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:15,780
canniest things in the book is that in the Emporium on Main Street they mention that you can buy the

204
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:23,420
outfits that the holograms are wearing. Oh yes. Right. I thought that was like oh that is what

205
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:30,900
Disney would do. Like this is not intentionally cutting but it is a little cutting. Yes there

206
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:37,340
yes it does seem like it's probably like written in like an earnest way of what Disney would do

207
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:42,500
but it also reads as something where Disney would just try to milk something that's popular in the

208
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:49,580
parks. I mean if there were holographic guides in Disneyland for real and they were like famous

209
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:56,020
or unique character type characters I would want merchandise of them. Oh you know what I'm saying.

210
00:18:56,020 --> 00:19:01,820
Like it would be like oh well I do want what's his name Jill Burt. What's the guy's name. Phil B.

211
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:08,460
Phil B. Sorry I swear I read the book. Oh I swear I listened. You listened to the book. Phil B.

212
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:14,860
And Phil B. is an accent is he English. I believe is English. Yeah he's English. And I was saying I

213
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:21,100
read. I was going to call him Dilby. Dilbert. Yeah Dilby. Because you would be like oh I want a Phil B.

214
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:26,220
doll or I want a Phil B. action figure. I would be lamenting the lack of Phil B. merchandise if there

215
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:32,580
was a holographic 13 year old on Main Street giving people guides. Now this is what I'm saying where

216
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:37,340
I'm reading or again I'm listening to this I want to be very clear I'm listening to this and going

217
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:44,620
wait what is this. They have completely invented an idea that there would be. Now you tell me this is

218
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:50,620
it just a little show going on of like the kids being holograms or are they completely interactive.

219
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:59,100
I think it's a mix. I think they kind of split the difference. This is all a setup for they need to

220
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:06,220
get these kids in the park quote unquote right within the universe so they can walk between

221
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:15,740
worlds so that when they go to sleep they show up in the park and then they can they see

222
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:23,260
pirate animatronics coming to life or like Pooh Bear Pooh Bear and Chip and Dale walking around

223
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:29,180
which I thought was kind of unexamined. Very unexamined. Very unexamined. Like oh you see

224
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:34,540
over there look who it is oh it's Pooh and then that's about it. That's about it I'm assuming in

225
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:40,220
later books that comes into play because I'm like well wouldn't they want as many allies

226
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:44,300
as they could get. Right you would want Pooh fighting and dying at your side

227
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:49,100
while fighting the overtakers. Yeah. Pooh sacrifices himself.

228
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:58,780
Yeah Christopher Robin you know. I've lived a good life oh let me go let me sacrifice myself.

229
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:06,300
Piglet piglet let me die. Let me die piglet. Christopher Robin is like that one SEAL Team

230
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:11,580
Six guys the weird squirrely quiet one. He's always sneaking up behind. He sneaks up behind

231
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:17,260
like Hades cuts him from ear to ear. Right yeah yeah. Pooh smothers somebody with his fluff.

232
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:23,260
My guts are spilling out and I'm going to suffocate them with my fluff.

233
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:26,140
Go just go into the light.

234
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:33,820
So yeah so I saw this on Reddit and this is kind of a thought I had. Do you think that the whole

235
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:42,060
hologram set up is some sort of like Disney note of like we can't actually have physical

236
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:49,260
13 year olds in our parks even in a fantasy world and even in a book being put in like direct harm

237
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:54,540
even though they kind of do get hurt in the books. Right if they're hologram okay when they're

238
00:21:54,540 --> 00:22:01,340
dreaming and they're a hologram if they get zapped with like a laser or bit by a creature

239
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:07,500
they do experience harm in real life. Right yes that is true so they wake up and they have a burn

240
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:12,860
on them from Buzz Lightyear's Astro Blasters or Space Ranger Spin but I'm just saying like is

241
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:19,020
there some like Disney legal was like okay we cannot have books where 13 year olds sneak into

242
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:25,580
the park at night like there's some like this kind of clunky plot set up is because of mandates

243
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:30,460
like we cannot have 13 year olds climb the walls of Disneyland. We can't have them do something

244
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:38,780
illegal or like against the rules like hide in the Emporium until close. We have to have some like

245
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:45,260
clean way that kids would be able to get into the park at midnight and the hologram and dreams

246
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:50,700
is a smooth way where they're not breaking any rules and they're technically Disney employees

247
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:57,340
as well. So like to me it seems like maybe there were some rules that the author had to follow

248
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:05,820
to make sure that kids wouldn't like imitate the behavior of these five kingdom keepers.

249
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:11,580
Right I had that thought as well but the thing that goes against it is the last

250
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:18,380
chunk of the book they are human and they are zooming through the trash can tubes.

251
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:29,100
Yeah. They are fighting the end of the book they are not holograms they were just themselves

252
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:36,060
in the daytime wearing but it is daytime it is daytime but they are wearing stolen

253
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:45,420
chaos memory uniforms and sneaking around and freaking servers and like messing stuff up.

254
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:50,140
But at that point they have no choice. They have no choice because Maleficent despite being

255
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:55,660
stabbed with a pen multiple times her power is drained but it could come back.

256
00:23:56,220 --> 00:24:01,820
Yes right so I don't know I was looking around for this like as far as the author I don't think

257
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:06,220
was going to explain Ridley was not going to explain that like here's what Disney told me

258
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:11,820
I had to do or couldn't do but I wonder just because like getting through that setup I was

259
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:18,060
just like oh this seems like a little too complicated but maybe it was some reason.

260
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:29,100
Speaking of complicated I want to explain this now so since you said complicated I will talk about

261
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:37,420
what I've discovered all the variations of these books because if you remember back to Goosebumps

262
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:45,980
there were like a 30 or 40 in the original monthly run and then it became Goosebumps 2000

263
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:49,660
right because the millennial happened and then there were all these different

264
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:56,700
sub-series and spinoffs. Yeah yeah. There are seven books in the original Kingdom Keepers.

265
00:24:57,420 --> 00:25:08,060
And then there is oh my god I gotta find it I kept discovering new like spinoff things so

266
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:16,540
I think after the main series okay there's the return right the kids thought they vanquished

267
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:23,420
the overtakers right but then it appears it is not they are not vanquished right and there's a

268
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:32,140
couple of those just in 2023 it appears the books have been relaunched Kingdom Keepers inheritance

269
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:39,980
and I'm going to read you this plot summary as I wanted to get your reaction on the air.

270
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:49,740
Good yeah. In the near future the Epcot of Walt Disney World's imagination 60,000 people live in

271
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:57,900
a communitry surrounding the forward-looking Walt Disney World theme park. Five unique families

272
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:04,300
are among the residents and some of the parents were once known as the Kingdom Keepers. Their

273
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:11,580
identities are carefully guarded in order to raise their children without special treatment.

274
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:19,500
Most of the Kingdom Keepers work for the Walt Disney Company and have settled into quote-unquote

275
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:26,860
ordinary and rewarding lives. When a messenger carrying a secret communication from Villains

276
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:36,780
Park in Hong Kong coincides with both a solar eclipse and Eli Whitman's 13th birthday,

277
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:44,300
a few quote-unquote ordinary kids are thrust into a battle to save Epcot and find their

278
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:52,140
friend who has mysteriously disappeared. With their friend missing and their parents acting

279
00:26:52,140 --> 00:27:00,780
strangely, the Kingdom kids discover they're in possession of unusual powers as they forge

280
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:08,140
a bond to rescue their friend and uncover the truth about how real magic has entered their lives.

281
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:13,740
Oh my gosh the Kingdom Keeper babies. The Kingdom Keeper babies live in a real

282
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:18,620
Epcot. That's a good premise. I'll say this, that's a pretty good premise. You know what I

283
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:23,180
would do if I have to plus this up? I would say that the new Kingdom Keepers would be all the

284
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:28,620
different Disney vloggers. You know I would say that like Mr. Morrow is a Kingdom Keeper.

285
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:35,100
Ordinary Adventure are their Kingdom Keepers as well and it would be a whole fresh baked Disney is

286
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:41,260
a Kingdom Keeper at Disneyland. Now obviously these are not people that are official employees

287
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:46,300
of Disneyland. I'm just saying that would be my spin-off book and maybe you would call them

288
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:50,540
something. You wouldn't call them keepers. You would keep them what would be a good like

289
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:57,420
keeper. I guess keeper is such a good like watch, Kingdom watch. I guess they would be Kingdom

290
00:27:57,420 --> 00:28:05,820
Watchers. They would be like, what is it in the Harry Potter books? Is it the Order of the Phoenix?

291
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:12,140
Like the dozen people that are like protecting the kids and fighting and dying. They watch over.

292
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:19,100
They watch over. They go to them for information and clues. So right, so like one of the 13 year

293
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:24,620
old Kingdom Keepers is fighting Maleficent but then like it looks like, oh it looks like uh-oh

294
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:31,020
the 13 year old is gonna get killed by Maleficent and then Mr. Morrow comes in like riding on like

295
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:36,380
a big like a stallion or something like the headless horseman's horse. Oh I was gonna say

296
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:43,580
Gracie the dog can grow and shrink and maybe rides in on her and then he sixes on Maleficent

297
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:51,500
and then yeah Mr. Morrow cuts off Maleficent's head. That would be traumatic for him. I don't

298
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:58,220
There is a moment in the book where they eventually solve the fable

299
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:05,100
of this. They solve the fable that all the Imagineers had not been able to solve

300
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:17,980
and then they acquire the quill, Walt Disney's first pen, and then they learn that Maleficent

301
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:27,980
wants its power but cannot touch it herself and also she gets injured if you stab her with it.

302
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:32,140
Right. Which I'm thinking like well just keep stabbing brother.

303
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:40,140
You would just keep. Yeah knock that out. Yeah that is one yeah would the modern Disney company

304
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:44,780
allow so much stabbing in one of their books these days because stabbing in general seems a

305
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:50,540
little aggressive. Well even just going back to the book would the modern Disney company

306
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:57,340
allow a lot of this stuff? Yeah sure. I was surprised that there was so much like yeah like

307
00:29:57,340 --> 00:30:04,140
actual like cuts or burns happening to the children because you would think that I was thinking they

308
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:08,860
were going to get around it because they were holograms so they wouldn't actually like suffer

309
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:15,260
any damage. Yes. But I would think yeah that they they don't really want these days kids

310
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:19,660
thinking that the pirates are going to hurt them on Pirates of the Caribbean. Well yeah and I

311
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:26,060
I don't even even acknowledging that like yeah looked at it in a certain way small world

312
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:32,220
it's a little creepy you know even just that acknowledgement of like oh yeah it's creepy oh

313
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:37,340
if those dolls came to life and started following you that would be unnerving. So there is in the

314
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:43,020
first book a sequence where the dolls come to life on small world. Yes. And attack their

315
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:49,740
blood. Like start dog piling. Like dog piling and I was yes that that kind of shocked me because

316
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:55,820
okay pirates on Pirates of the Caribbean are bad guys. Yes. No doubt those pirates are bad dudes

317
00:30:55,820 --> 00:31:03,260
they're burning down a town they're chasing people around and getting chased so yes makes total sense

318
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:08,780
there are villains Maleficent villain clear villain Emperor Zerg clear villain but then

319
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:16,060
the small world dolls there's no villain on small world. No. Those are all kids or Disney characters

320
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:22,140
that are all just representatives of like what the best of humanity has to offer living in harmony

321
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:27,820
in a perfect idyllic world that is all small world is. So the idea that Disney would allow him to

322
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:33,900
turn the dolls into evil little monsters is pretty wild. Well like that the dolls are evil

323
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:38,780
and it's like a horde of zombies almost. Yeah. And even acknowledging someone goes god that's

324
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:44,620
someone mentions the song's a little creepy. They have done I feel like they have mentioned like I

325
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:49,580
think it's okay in Disney now to say small world is a little annoying there's been jokes about that

326
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:57,660
for I feel like decades now but as far as the dolls being murderous not as much. Well yeah that

327
00:31:57,660 --> 00:32:03,100
was very creepy to read it like midnight one night and it is a yes it is it is you could see

328
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:06,940
where that the lights would be off in there and that would be scary all a bunch of little dolls

329
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:14,220
coming to life a bunch of like Roberts yeah a bunch of Robert or Chuckie yeah that's a great

330
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:20,860
if there was ever a full horror park you would have to think there would be that would be a prime

331
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:27,500
ride of like a horror small world yes it could be filled with IP dolls it could be all original

332
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:34,060
but if it was like Chuckie's small world and it was just a bunch of murderous little dolls

333
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:40,380
yeah a song that would be scary and funny. Did you see I saw it just yesterday you can buy

334
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:48,540
a like simple Chuckie animatronic at like Home Depot or Lowe's or something now. Oh I feel like

335
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:52,940
I've seen that maybe this is the first year because they the animatronics are unbelievable

336
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:58,860
in the last couple years that you can buy at Lowe's yeah for your lawn so it doesn't I get

337
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:02,460
maybe I didn't see them when you're talking about but I have been very impressed by what you can

338
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:08,060
get for a couple hundred bucks like how crazy and elaborate things are and then when last year

339
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:14,300
when we went to Shacktoberfest there were these giant animatronics that I don't know that you

340
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:19,900
could get it at Lowe's but I was like Shacktoberfest is generally done on the cheap yeah so I was

341
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:24,780
impressed that like oh man these robots must not be so expensive but they're very impressive so

342
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:31,340
yeah well Dark Harbor is back I know this year and it seems like either new management or

343
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:36,940
some plus stuff stuff from what I've heard yeah I would I mean in Dark and Shacktoberfest was

344
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:42,140
Dark Harbor with just a shack overlay because all of a sudden it was just like Captain Shack there

345
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:49,020
was a lot of like a nautical shack happening at Shacktoberfest yes and this is down in the port

346
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:56,300
of Long Beach yes next to the historic Queen Mary which I think has also recently gotten a facelift

347
00:33:56,300 --> 00:34:01,820
has it I think they were redoing some of those ruins those ruins were a little janky when I stayed

348
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:08,300
there oh yeah a few years ago um but hey there were 80 bucks a night so and it's like it was

349
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:13,660
weird it was crazy to stay on this historic vessel well there was a maze there was a haunted maze

350
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:20,380
in the Queen Mary last year which is cool and weird um so yeah so so there are murderous small

351
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:26,140
world dolls in this book the other they don't kill anybody but they're scary no you smile at

352
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:30,940
them and they and that yes we should have said yes they so the way that you stop small world

353
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:36,620
dolls from trying to kill you is you smile at them yeah I guess we should have said spoiler

354
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:43,820
alert but this book came out 19 years ago so yeah it's okay the the other chapter that was like

355
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:51,260
a little spooky was the splash mountain chapter oh yeah where they're like floating in the water

356
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:58,140
and then someone activates the logs and they're like stuck because the drop is coming up right

357
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:06,300
and I'm like that that I am surprised the Disney company let them get away with acknowledging like

358
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:11,900
oh yeah these currents in splash mountain if you go in the water it could really fuck you up

359
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:16,060
well that is interesting too because almost it's closer to almost like a mechanical failure

360
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:21,500
or something that could actually mechanically go wrong with a ride in some ways too which you would

361
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:27,100
think they would not want that as well yeah they you wouldn't want to people thinking like following

362
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:32,460
the line at the end of like oh wait if this happens then but then that was where it started

363
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:38,060
to get a little convoluted because they're floating in the water but they're holograms

364
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:44,860
and they can't get out or they'll trigger the alarm yeah but then sometimes they can turn to

365
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:51,980
pure light and walk through things I don't mean to give notes I'm just like oh I had a little

366
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:58,460
trouble following you know then they got in the log and saved the day okay great right so should

367
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:06,380
we go back a little bit like there is this is a very teen book yes it's very like uh oh my god

368
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:10,220
one of the characters thinks like girls are from another planet they're basically another species

369
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:17,100
I don't know what to make of them man so there's like a lot of that just general teen angst the

370
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:24,460
tension between girls and boys yes there but there's some like interest there's like butterflies in

371
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:31,900
the stomach and yes mutual attraction and almost seems like a love triangle was developing

372
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:38,780
and seems like it comes up from what I saw at the start of the second book where like

373
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:45,980
there's a magical girl named Amanda she's not a kingdom keeper but she's very important

374
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:56,700
and uh Charlene the cheerleader dhi she is a little jealous it seems like of Amanda

375
00:36:56,700 --> 00:37:03,180
right uh and of Finn's attention that he gives Amanda right now look here's what I would say

376
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:09,340
if I had the task of being a kingdom keeper at 13 I don't have any time for girls okay oh yeah I

377
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:14,940
have a park to protect I have Walt Disney's memory and his history his legacy to protect

378
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:21,100
I don't have time for this girl stuff okay a hundred percent I mean even when I went on school

379
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:27,580
trips to parks I was like I'm here for the park I see you guys every day in school yeah it never

380
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:33,100
occurred to me like yeah I mean you I could maybe I had that same philosophy when it was like look

381
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:40,780
I'm in I'm in marching band I don't have time for girls okay I am married to my trumpet and I love

382
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:46,300
the work of John Philip Sousa and that's what I'm focusing on right now I don't have time

383
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:54,060
for all these butterflies all right sorry sorry ladies I'm busy I do have a very specific memory

384
00:37:54,060 --> 00:38:02,380
in like summer theater one year a girl like I think she liked me and she was like hey it's been

385
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:08,540
really fun this summer and she like tried to hold my hand and I think I went hey stop we're about

386
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:13,980
to go on did you really like I didn't want to miss my cue I didn't want to miss my mark you know

387
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:21,740
I don't think you've ever told that story before I don't think I have I I it was get away from me

388
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:30,300
yeah we're gonna miss the what we were about to go on like in a crowd of like hey what's going on

389
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:36,460
like that kind of like rabble rabble like crap we were about we were like going on stage yeah we

390
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:40,620
were in the wings we're about to walk on stage and it's like now's not the time

391
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:47,580
I was a little strange she was a little strange like it wouldn't have worked it you know it

392
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:51,820
wouldn't you mean long term it wouldn't long term wouldn't have worked you know you could have

393
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:59,260
squeezed back I guess I guess so yeah wow I mean I think I have like 10 of those maybe in the last

394
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:04,060
oh yeah last so many years of high school sure college yeah maybe not 10 that sounds bragging

395
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:10,380
well I think I was like 12 like and I was like oh probably still very scared of like 12 or 13

396
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:18,220
I didn't know what was going on in fifth grade I believe my sister so so my sister was in a class

397
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:25,260
my sister's three years younger than me she was in a class with this girl in my class like so so she

398
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:30,700
was so they were in the same class I was in the class with that girl's sister okay uh and and my

399
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:40,700
sister's friend said oh I know your brother he's my sister's boyfriend she declared this okay this

400
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:45,740
was not something I signed off on this is not something I proved on and I remember it was my

401
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:51,180
sister's Chuck E. Cheese birthday I don't think I've ever told this story before uh in fifth grade

402
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:57,980
and I remember playing the basketball and then the girl in my class who declared that I was her

403
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:03,260
boyfriend without consulting me without even talking to me very much I remember her coming

404
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:08,380
over to me when like the family came to pick up her sister and she was just like talking to me

405
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:15,420
while I played basketball and I remember just like not making eye contact with her and being so scared

406
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:21,740
so freaked out because I felt this like energy from this fifth other fifth grader and I just kept

407
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:27,740
playing basketball and like one word answering this girl because I was so scared that she declared

408
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:32,780
me her boyfriend and I don't know that I ever even turned to look at her and I think I just kept

409
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:41,660
like feeding the machine to keep playing basketball at the Chuck E. Cheese I uh sit okay around fifth

410
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:47,340
grade I don't know if I told this story either okay I'm burning off of it uh I'm not gonna have

411
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:53,180
your seven of podcasts around you're burning off I don't think I at this point in fifth grade uh

412
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:57,580
there was the first school dance coming up we had just started middle school yeah there was

413
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:03,020
Halloween dance coming up I think it was just fifth and sixth grade and a girl asked me like

414
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:09,020
hey do you want to go to dance and I was like yes I'm going I can meet you there and like

415
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:13,820
because I didn't know I didn't know what I was supposed to do and we're all in cots I'm like

416
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:19,100
in a Frankenstein outfit and she was like do you have photos of this Cleopatra or something I don't

417
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:26,700
know I I don't think so please find them but I was so like I I was terrified and we like

418
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:31,260
she was like hi Jason we're at the dance and we danced together for like one second I'm just so

419
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:37,340
stressed out by everything going around me yeah and my mom was chaper or like hanging out in case

420
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:42,940
I freaked out like yeah there was a bunch of parents chaper because there was also a haunted

421
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:51,580
house in the gym which I did go through but I was terrified the entire time my goodness anyway me and

422
00:41:51,580 --> 00:42:00,940
this girl uh we were friends through high school and uh I I am I was mortified I'm still mortified

423
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:07,980
that that was my reaction I was 10 years old I was a child yeah anyway she's a professor now she had

424
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:11,020
and what are you professionally you're a podcast I'm a podcaster

425
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:18,940
okay all right so well well I don't know hey we both seem to be doing what we love so I hope so

426
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:28,060
yeah yeah wow so so the book has has these you know these common things that happen very relatable

427
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:37,180
there is some weirdness you know I remember when I was this age and reading more like

428
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:44,380
young adult genre books and stuff looking at it now there are moments where adults try to write

429
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:52,300
like oh this character is a little into this character and it seems a little clunky a little

430
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:59,260
strange you know what I mean like Finn and Amanda's kind of like being interested in each other

431
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:05,500
are you saying this is clunky or you're saying other I'm saying like four other books are clunky

432
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:11,420
this it's a little you get it it's a little clunky there was one very weird chapter

433
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:19,020
where so there's a kind of a sinister girl named Jez

434
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:30,780
like Jezebel from the Bible that is very that is we all had a Jezebel in our class when we were 12

435
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:39,420
or 13 sure that name I'm not saying a type and she specifically says hey there's a girl scout

436
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:49,100
car wash fundraiser at dangerous dance use cars you should come and then they specifically write

437
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:55,020
about the girls having water fights and being in one piece bathing suits oh yes yeah yeah and that

438
00:43:55,020 --> 00:44:00,300
was a little odd like I think that is a little yes you're correct a car wash fundraiser is

439
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:08,540
kind of a go-to for like teen movies and stuff but usually it's older girls uh yes it's not

440
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:14,540
usually 12 year olds yes yes I agree with you that is very strange I think it was more of a plot

441
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:22,780
device than anything else because you see Jeze run over to an SUV driven by a sinister figure

442
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:30,380
right but it's very strange of like the descriptions of like and then Jeze revealed

443
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:38,300
her purple one piece and her soaking wet hair and I'm like what what's happening yes I don't

444
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:44,060
know I that made it by Disney I guess I don't know if there's a I read that there were like

445
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:47,420
they've changed some of these books over the years I don't maybe I misread what I was like

446
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:54,300
they've changed it to reflect even what the current parks look like more oh okay but I don't know if

447
00:44:54,300 --> 00:45:01,100
they got rid of this weird chapter I mean it's still in the library's digital copy right so I

448
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:05,020
mean no one's talking about let me ask the audience this do you does anyone have a friend

449
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:11,020
named Jez Jezebel is that ever who's I'm sure people have been named Jezebel but that really

450
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:18,540
feels like you're setting up your kid well I have a certain personality uh she she gets freed from

451
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:25,660
Maleficent's control sure and her hair is no longer white it's sandy blonde and she has a

452
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:31,340
redemption she has a redemption arc and her name is actually Jess I'm just saying like calling your

453
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:37,180
son Lucifer would be a bad idea I think well I think it's because she was a little evil it's

454
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:41,900
meant to convey she's a little of course it's meant to convey she's evil I'm just saying I just think

455
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:46,300
that that's a funny thing to name your child I'm just saying in the real world do we ever see that

456
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:53,580
is anyone actually bold enough to name their daughter Jezebel in the last no I don't think

457
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:58,060
but there has to be one negative connotation that's what I'm talking that's what I'm saying I'm

458
00:45:58,060 --> 00:46:03,260
saying but has it happened ever all all I even I mean I don't know it from the Bible as much as

459
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:09,900
I know it from like Jim Ross calling an evil female wrestler well Jezebel she's a Jezebel when

460
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:15,420
he was calling WWE and I think he still says it sometimes if he's on AEW but I'm just saying if

461
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:19,340
anyone out there knows did they did you have a friend named Jezebel did you have a friend named

462
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:26,460
Lucifer let us know that's what I want to know any Damien that's a little more common a little more

463
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:33,260
common but you know no men still yes I would think you would think twice before naming someone

464
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:40,060
Damien but yes so so answer that question please in the comments or any other social medias

465
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:49,500
it is very funny when they like want to highlight specific Disney stuff like there's a chapter

466
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:57,340
specifically at the Wide World of Sports I know I love this I think this is so funny and I went

467
00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:05,340
and explored the Wide World of Sports website a little and you can register now for spring training

468
00:47:06,140 --> 00:47:13,500
oh you can for this is a topic in general we need to tackle I think we're so sports averse

469
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:17,580
that we have kind of stayed away from it but it's funny it's been there a long time

470
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:23,180
and I bet there's a bunch of interesting stuff we don't know we consider doing it during the NBA

471
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:28,700
bubble period that's true just couldn't get it together yes that's right so you can register

472
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:34,460
your baseball team or your softball team for Wide World of Sports spring training

473
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:41,260
okay so how does that so wait so how does that work you can you can register a full baseball team

474
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:51,020
yeah so I think you go and you do like uh exercises and you eat together

475
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:58,940
how long is your last I think it's like I think the period well I think you go for a few days

476
00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:04,780
but the period that they're doing it lasts like a month oh spring training will be playing

477
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:11,260
March 10th to April 20th March 10th April so that's like almost yeah that's obviously a month

478
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:15,580
more than a month yeah so you could get I didn't even realize it so you pay a fee

479
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:22,220
you put a full baseball team together yeah well there's travel do you know about travel teams

480
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:28,700
yeah like kids so I think it's a sort of thing where they'll like go and do their spring training

481
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:36,060
before their season but okay so so you would bring a team of kids down there

482
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:41,500
yeah and they would just put them through the paces of training yes but could an adult team

483
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:46,940
could you put together a baseball team of adults and just have them run you through the drills

484
00:48:46,940 --> 00:48:52,060
you think money hey if the money's there the money's right I bet so they don't have a full

485
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:56,700
like there's not actually a full league that happens after spring training at that complex

486
00:48:56,700 --> 00:49:03,900
I don't think so but oh I mean that's a little too long for us to put a team together

487
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:10,620
well I was like do they do spring podcast training no could we no they don't do that

488
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:15,660
could we you know go and make our own curriculum and use the facilities oh you want to use you want

489
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:21,180
us to teach spring podcast training at the wide world of sports well we could I was I was thinking

490
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:28,220
we would get you know oh we would get you mean we would get trained well yeah we practice setting

491
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:35,900
up mic stands on topic no talk of al lewis what are you doing or more tangents we practice

492
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:42,300
we practice better doing better tangents yeah okay yeah uh perhaps who would be teach I don't know

493
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:51,260
who would teach that in Orlando yeah who's like I don't know Goofy Donald I don't know that the

494
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:56,620
characters teach spring training I bet they make an appearance in their little baseball because

495
00:49:56,620 --> 00:50:03,420
Goofy does the baseball short yeah I want to that's just too long to do spring training but

496
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:09,820
man that is a if we could put together a team a baseball team in Orlando full of all the people

497
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:14,380
we know now down there sure and then but it would take them could we just do like a weekend

498
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:21,580
maybe I don't know I got to look into it's interesting I think I think the pitchers should

499
00:50:21,580 --> 00:50:27,900
do like like Japanese baseball players when they're in high school yeah there is very

500
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:33,180
intense training and they'll like throw 500 pitches in one day well that's because they're

501
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:38,700
trying to like get their arm just unconscious like being able to sure yeah don't think about it

502
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:44,220
yeah I'm an old man I can't do 500 pitches in a day well but I don't I don't know how aggressive

503
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:50,460
you're never gonna make to the Tokyo Dome with that attitude well that is I that's true um my arm

504
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:55,100
will fall off though uh but I'll look into this because yeah like we got we got Mr. Morrow on the

505
00:50:55,100 --> 00:51:00,460
team we got a bunch of different people I feel like oh you're putting you're putting podcasters

506
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:06,300
and vloggers Matt Cardona could be on the team sure Len Testa could be on the team yeah all the

507
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:11,660
different people down there Matt Cardona's fit he might be able to throw 500 pitches in it I don't

508
00:51:11,660 --> 00:51:16,460
know though he's obviously an athlete and a pro wrestler but I feel like he doesn't care about

509
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:22,380
sports at all like real sports sure pro wrestling is a real sport but I'm just saying yeah I bet

510
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:26,620
I don't know I bet he I bet I could throw better than him that's what I'm saying oh it's everything

511
00:51:26,620 --> 00:51:31,180
it's sport it's entertainment it's performance art right of course I yeah I didn't want to put

512
00:51:31,180 --> 00:51:35,100
it down I'm just saying but I'm just but but still he'll be on the team I'm just saying I don't know

513
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:39,660
how good of a baseball player he is but man that's interesting that's interesting is all I'll say

514
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:47,260
but seeing it pop up in this book was very funny to me it's very funny I there there's I gotta

515
00:51:47,260 --> 00:51:56,700
find it towards the end a lot of the end of the book takes place at Mickey's not so scary

516
00:51:56,700 --> 00:52:04,700
Halloween party yes yes and the specifically uh chapter starts Mickey's not so scary Halloween

517
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:13,340
party the most fun of any of the park's special events was not to be missed uh-huh that felt like

518
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:20,460
if like a modern like a book taking place at Disney's catino uh real estate development yeah

519
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:26,300
like that felt mandate-ish you know that's a famous thing that people do a big that's

520
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:30,540
in a popular thing people do in Orlando it still felt like a little bit of an ad for

521
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:38,140
an upcharge event a ticketed event well but so that there is like official language like that

522
00:52:38,140 --> 00:52:45,340
but then at some point ween is talking about where would maleficent hide where she would not be

523
00:52:45,340 --> 00:52:53,980
noticed right because she's not in a ride right um uh and he says the only place she is at Disney

524
00:52:53,980 --> 00:53:00,940
World she's in Fantasmic's and that's not the name of the show there's an s there's an s yeah

525
00:53:00,940 --> 00:53:07,500
there's an s it's just Fantasmic's yeah Fantasmic I mean he's an older man maybe you know you know

526
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:12,940
older men sometimes put in a plural on something and they yeah they just don't know exactly even

527
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:18,860
though he's been around Disney for a long time uh yes could we talk real quick about Wayne so

528
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:24,700
Wayne worked with Walt Disney but we don't he wasn't he's never listed on one of like Walt's

529
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:32,700
old nine old man or anything no you never get a last name of Wayne which is making me wonder if he

530
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:39,740
is uh real or not if he I don't think that's what I'm getting a hallucination but he might be a

531
00:53:39,740 --> 00:53:45,660
spirit of some kind that's what I'm wondering I wonder if in a further one of the future books

532
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:52,380
it's like revealed that Wayne is like a god or something or like god himself or something like

533
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:57,180
is Wayne is Wayne not really like yes he worked with Walt Disney in the way that god works with

534
00:53:57,180 --> 00:54:04,780
all of us well I yeah he's Wayne I think Wayne and Amanda are connected there's a lot of alluding

535
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:13,420
to their to Amanda exhibits powers at one point right so and so they seem to know each other

536
00:54:13,980 --> 00:54:24,460
and at some point when Wayne uh takes a borrows a bus and drives a bus so he is corporeal right

537
00:54:24,460 --> 00:54:31,420
you know sure he pulls over at one point picks up Amanda and says like Amanda's very important

538
00:54:31,420 --> 00:54:38,060
follower instructions uh-huh so I yeah I wonder and then well I don't know I don't know that I'll

539
00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:43,420
ever read another full book I might read all of them I suspected you might want to read all of

540
00:54:43,420 --> 00:54:49,500
them I kind of got hooked a few chapters oh interesting um Wayne so yeah Wayne I would

541
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:53,740
have just like Wayne to drop a credit be like you know I designed I actually drew Thumper's

542
00:54:53,740 --> 00:55:01,900
tail or something or I yeah I um I'm the guy who had the idea to like give Geppetto that hair

543
00:55:03,020 --> 00:55:10,940
yeah like like something claim to fame wise or even just like I was the assistant to Walt's nurse

544
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:17,740
uh which I always forget her name I always forget her name too but it's a good name she Michael

545
00:55:17,740 --> 00:55:22,620
wow god damn it it's such a good reference too I'm so funny when I come up with that reference

546
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:28,780
on the top of my head and when I don't it's so disappointing to me Walt's nurse who worked on

547
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:40,460
his polo injury is named as I google as I google hazel george waltz nurse hazel george um and she

548
00:55:40,460 --> 00:55:49,820
was of course friends with Michael Jackson uh and maybe maybe um this guy Wayne knew hazel george

549
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:57,260
and he would help like get the different like towels and ice packs or heat packs to help

550
00:55:57,260 --> 00:56:05,100
nurse Walt's polo injury uh yeah maybe Wayne knew I I forgot about this fact what the man

551
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:11,660
who died at the Riviera polo field where Walt had his injury oh yeah when Walt killed that guy

552
00:56:12,220 --> 00:56:22,460
I don't think but if Felix Winslow the owner of the famous Felix the cat right right right car

553
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:29,580
dealership uh in downtown LA right that still stands so I wonder yes does Wayne does Wayne

554
00:56:29,580 --> 00:56:35,020
eventually reveal what he did with Walt I don't know but I would like I would have liked a little

555
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:40,540
piece of information there but yes as you as you said maybe he's more of a ghost I'll keep

556
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:46,220
investigating okay we'll see if I make it through I'm gonna try to make it through the main series

557
00:56:46,860 --> 00:56:53,500
if it still has me right I'll see about the spin-offs or the sequels we can do a follow-up

558
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:58,860
episode once you're done with the main series or however long you want to go sure um and then you

559
00:56:58,860 --> 00:57:05,980
can report back if Wayne reveals his credits because is it possible that Wayne like does some

560
00:57:05,980 --> 00:57:14,220
magic and it's revealed to be the spirit of Walt Disney it's possible I feel like it is possible

561
00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:19,980
that that happens but I don't know yeah it feels like another like another like risky thing

562
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:27,980
that Disney might not want directly to be Walt to be the likeness yeah but I don't know

563
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:33,740
maybe there were rumors there were rumors that Walt himself there was gonna be more like archival

564
00:57:33,740 --> 00:57:38,060
Walt in Tomorrowland the movie the Brad Bird movie yes and then stuff like that stuff got

565
00:57:38,060 --> 00:57:42,620
cut there was more direct references to Walt so they are very protective of the Walt

566
00:57:43,340 --> 00:57:50,860
right well I have the there's like a 70 page document explaining the pre Tomorrowland

567
00:57:52,460 --> 00:57:59,420
scavenger the mystery box yes all that pre-release stuff was very cool yeah that was awesome

568
00:57:59,420 --> 00:58:05,260
really seemed interesting and was exciting and I would be interested to know what an early cut of

569
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:11,500
that movie was if it was actually like cooler because it tied into the actual like tied into

570
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:17,820
Disneyland more because the movie itself didn't quite feel that connected to the actual parks

571
00:58:17,820 --> 00:58:24,540
yeah it was fine I feel like George Clooney and Hugh Laurie are pretty entertaining actors

572
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:31,980
even like a kind of cut down I don't remember anything past the house in the bathtub

573
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:38,060
I remember like kind of a CGI world post that with you Laurie but a lot of bathtub

574
00:58:39,420 --> 00:58:46,300
business in the 2000s what other bathtub stuff are you thinking Indiana Jones and the crystal skull

575
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:50,540
well that's the I mean he does he get in a tub but he gets in the fridge oh he gets in a fridge

576
00:58:50,540 --> 00:58:55,820
sorry I'm mixing a fridge in a tub is that because you store food in your tub sometimes

577
00:58:56,460 --> 00:59:02,540
sometimes sometimes I need to cool down in the fridge or you have like a big side of beef that

578
00:59:02,540 --> 00:59:06,540
is just too big for your fridge and you need to like put a bunch of ice in the well I have the

579
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:13,020
Flintstones ribs oh when you buy your Flintstones ribs yeah you can't you gotta go to Aldi they have

580
00:59:13,020 --> 00:59:18,460
the best deals right so you get a bunch of bags of ice dump it in the tub and then you put your big

581
00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:24,380
Flintstones ribs well yeah in between triple a coming because my car tipped over because it was

582
00:59:24,380 --> 00:59:31,020
so big your car is always tipping over always tipping over from the giant Flintstones Aldi

583
00:59:35,260 --> 00:59:42,460
funny detail from the very end of the book where they they do at least temporarily

584
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:51,180
um get maleficent uh and they do oh yeah yeah the end it does involve a trash

585
00:59:51,900 --> 01:00:01,820
chute chase and a big net yes which I thought was very satisfying as a as a kid I was always

586
01:00:01,820 --> 01:00:09,020
like I was either scared of big nets or I was like oh yeah they got him used a big net

587
01:00:09,020 --> 01:00:14,460
you know you were scared of getting caught by a big net well I knew they were very powerful

588
01:00:15,580 --> 01:00:20,940
I mean that's a lot of cartoons big nets you know well quicksand's in that Indiana Jones fourth

589
01:00:20,940 --> 01:00:25,900
Indiana Jones movie that's right yeah um I'm trying to think if I was afraid I was afraid

590
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:34,460
of quicksand as a kid big nets though I think I just respected them well yeah yeah well when

591
01:00:34,460 --> 01:00:40,380
you say big net do you think of like a big butterfly net or a net that's like on the ground

592
01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:46,540
that you walk into and then it like pulls up in the tree either are both very powerful because

593
01:00:46,540 --> 01:00:51,180
the big net on the ground that would pull you up into a tree I feel like was very common and I was

594
01:00:51,180 --> 01:00:56,940
maybe afraid of that because I've seen that a bunch I just knew if you if a dog escaped you had

595
01:00:56,940 --> 01:01:03,100
to get a big net on hold and catch it that was the guy that was a dog catcher instrument

596
01:01:03,740 --> 01:01:10,380
for sure I feel like Heathcliff episodes would have that a lot yes and any any animal cartoon

597
01:01:10,380 --> 01:01:15,260
would have that but I but the big net I feared more I think in Ninja Turtles three they get

598
01:01:15,260 --> 01:01:21,420
caught in a big net okay and and they would always make us like the big net would always

599
01:01:21,420 --> 01:01:28,300
seem like it was impossible to get out of well and the end of this book too there are a bunch

600
01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:36,620
of adults that just showed up with a big net and why didn't they help those children the rest of

601
01:01:36,620 --> 01:01:44,460
the time uh-huh there's a lot of like I think in real life if Disney had to do this they would make

602
01:01:45,020 --> 01:01:53,180
uh like seal team six holograms and they would just take out Maleficent you mean in real life

603
01:01:53,180 --> 01:01:59,900
if Disney had to combat evil spirits in their yeah they would just hire a bunch of ex-CIA

604
01:01:59,900 --> 01:02:03,580
ex-special forces but you would need like religious people too in some ways because

605
01:02:03,580 --> 01:02:08,620
their spirit like there there's talk of them being spirits as well I feel like that's true

606
01:02:08,620 --> 01:02:15,980
there's talk of how like it's pure evil like Walt knew that like what they describe somewhere

607
01:02:15,980 --> 01:02:22,460
that because so many people come to the parks and believe in everything that just by a it's a

608
01:02:22,460 --> 01:02:27,180
by-product of all these like thousands and thousands of people believing so hard in all

609
01:02:27,180 --> 01:02:32,460
these characters that then the the good characters come to life but then the bad characters who are

610
01:02:32,460 --> 01:02:39,660
evil come to life and Walt knew this was a possibility and because of that that's why

611
01:02:39,660 --> 01:02:43,740
all of these different confusing things that we've talked about have to be put in place

612
01:02:44,380 --> 01:02:53,340
to combat evil spirits um so there's a mystical religious quality in my mind to that but maybe

613
01:02:53,980 --> 01:02:59,500
it's maybe I'm maybe I'm just projecting I don't know maybe I'm just putting that on it I don't

614
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:05,980
know well I think you need to have like a you're forgetting the magic words story imagination

615
01:03:05,980 --> 01:03:12,780
that's true dreams wishes like a disney you need like a specific disney priest yes like a disney

616
01:03:12,780 --> 01:03:18,780
like somebody's like steeped in disney religion they need who knows the history of everything

617
01:03:18,780 --> 01:03:25,020
who knows the archivist yes you need the guy who started the archive right but we should call

618
01:03:25,020 --> 01:03:31,260
yes an archivist like a disney high priest yes who knows who can do like sort of a religious

619
01:03:31,260 --> 01:03:36,940
ceremony who knows the difference between claude coats and mark davis maybe that's that could be

620
01:03:36,940 --> 01:03:43,820
like um the fuddy duddy mayor's assistant in ghostbusters he was like I'm shutting this maybe

621
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:52,140
in later books there's like a disney legal becomes a hologram and it's like this is dangerous you

622
01:03:52,140 --> 01:03:59,260
can't keep doing that and then he comes around when he's confronted by the powers of chernobog

623
01:04:01,100 --> 01:04:08,380
sure yeah I think in later books chernobog becomes a big enemy yes I did read that chernobog becomes

624
01:04:08,380 --> 01:04:14,620
from from fantasia chernobog chernobog is scary he's very scary chernobog is the devil in my mind

625
01:04:14,620 --> 01:04:18,140
yeah because chernobog doesn't even have much of a personality it's sort of just a pure

626
01:04:18,860 --> 01:04:25,260
evil entity yes um is wait I'm now I'm mixing up what I read in future books in this in this

627
01:04:25,260 --> 01:04:29,740
book do they mention that Mickey got caught on fire at phantasmic and fell into the lagoon

628
01:04:31,020 --> 01:04:35,500
I believe they did I think so yeah which is another thing where I was like ah they wouldn't say that

629
01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:41,900
in these days especially since Mickey almost caught on fire yeah recently I saw a clip of a

630
01:04:41,900 --> 01:04:48,860
phantasmic at Disneyland recently where it's just there's no Mickey at the end it's just lights and

631
01:04:48,860 --> 01:04:54,380
stuff right and it's like what did they cost cut or what went well there's no dragon now

632
01:04:55,260 --> 01:05:00,860
at all at all I don't think it's the big like cherry picker maleficent right it's regular

633
01:05:00,860 --> 01:05:06,700
maleficent she's just she's just 25 feet in the air yeah but they haven't I supposedly though

634
01:05:06,700 --> 01:05:11,500
they're working on something dragon wise I don't know if that is true or not but something

635
01:05:11,500 --> 01:05:17,100
eventually will come to phantasmic but yes they say Mickey caught on fire and fell into the water

636
01:05:17,100 --> 01:05:22,380
well because there's weird things happening everywhere that the over the overtakers broke

637
01:05:22,380 --> 01:05:29,180
in and stole a bunch of padlocks from a hardware store right which seems like you know that's not

638
01:05:29,180 --> 01:05:34,620
as big of a crime as setting Mickey on fire in my mind yeah one is more egregious than the other

639
01:05:35,020 --> 01:05:42,380
there's a funny moment I don't have the exact wording but they're talking earlier in the book

640
01:05:42,380 --> 01:05:49,900
about like where the clues where the clues and one of them says like maybe the answer is in

641
01:05:49,900 --> 01:05:57,500
Disneyland and I feel like they brush it off like a substance line of like no no the answer is

642
01:05:57,500 --> 01:06:04,140
definitely here like they're like yeah that is a good point that is the park Walt was in

643
01:06:04,140 --> 01:06:09,580
right right I know they eventually the series does go to Disneyland yes but not here this is

644
01:06:10,140 --> 01:06:16,940
exclusively Orlando in this book uh yeah it specifically to the point where at one point

645
01:06:17,020 --> 01:06:22,700
it says like okay let's all meet at the statue of Roy O. Disney

646
01:06:24,780 --> 01:06:31,260
I that stuff all the specificity of all that stuff would make me laugh every time when they're like

647
01:06:31,260 --> 01:06:40,140
let's go to one man's dream one man's dream playing a crucial role in this first book is very funny

648
01:06:40,140 --> 01:06:44,700
yes and I love because these books are very popular or were very I mean I'm sure there's

649
01:06:44,700 --> 01:06:50,380
still a big fan base for them yeah eventually I forget what number book there was a book that

650
01:06:50,380 --> 01:06:57,900
like was like written by the fans like crowdsourced essentially oh has to be well no this is I was

651
01:06:57,900 --> 01:07:01,660
listening to the author talk about it like there was a website set up and like there would be

652
01:07:01,660 --> 01:07:05,260
people that would write their own fan fiction and I don't know exactly know how it worked but

653
01:07:05,260 --> 01:07:12,220
I think he took like 37 different like readers suggestions and then they like wrote the final

654
01:07:12,220 --> 01:07:18,860
book or whatever version or series it was well do you know about um an archive of our own I

655
01:07:18,860 --> 01:07:25,500
think it's called no it's a giant repository of fan fiction oh okay and you could search any

656
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:31,820
character any story could you search Jason Sheridan from podcast the ride with that papa oh gosh I

657
01:07:31,820 --> 01:07:37,340
don't know because I mean I assume it's mostly literary characters yes it's like could you

658
01:07:37,340 --> 01:07:43,580
Harry Potter Star Wars kind of fan fiction right but could it be Jason could it be podcast or maybe

659
01:07:43,580 --> 01:07:47,500
I don't know I have to poke around could it be you in the Kingdom Keeper series

660
01:07:48,060 --> 01:07:55,740
oh boy as a 12 year old well but you say that I think later on their senior year in high school

661
01:07:55,740 --> 01:08:01,660
they're finishing their senior year in high school so if you defending the Magic Kingdom

662
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:06,540
and anytime a girl gets close to you you go get away from me hey we have stuff to do we

663
01:08:06,540 --> 01:08:12,860
are defending the Magic Kingdom I have show tunes to listen to also in addition to this I if this

664
01:08:12,860 --> 01:08:18,540
had come well if these books had been published like five years before oh that would have been

665
01:08:18,540 --> 01:08:24,700
like you would have been six years before if when I was going a lot to Florida yeah if I had seen

666
01:08:24,700 --> 01:08:33,900
these books in the MGM Studios bookstore right uh that had goosebumps and I saw these I would be like

667
01:08:33,900 --> 01:08:41,180
I need this right now right if you if there was a book series that that climaxed in one man's dream

668
01:08:43,180 --> 01:08:48,540
Disney's MGM Studios I loved one man I even the last time I was down there I

669
01:08:49,100 --> 01:08:54,860
I thought it was a very nice like museum yeah I thought it was cool I thought it was great it's

670
01:08:54,860 --> 01:09:01,820
very funny to compare that exhibit with the Walt Disney Family Museum in San Francisco which is

671
01:09:02,700 --> 01:09:10,300
very detailed but much more frank about a complicated man sure but the Disney sanitized

672
01:09:10,300 --> 01:09:15,660
version of Walt is very effective they do a good job in general other excuse me other than when

673
01:09:15,660 --> 01:09:20,220
they're doing like kind of the Walt fan fiction of like trying to justify that Walt needed them

674
01:09:20,220 --> 01:09:27,820
to build a bunch of houses out in the desert like other than that stuff it's like Epcot fun myth

675
01:09:27,820 --> 01:09:33,820
the fun like sanitized Walt Disney story is always very they they do a good job of

676
01:09:34,380 --> 01:09:40,700
telling it and keeping the myth of it and I assume the robot Walt next year will do will continue

677
01:09:40,700 --> 01:09:47,180
this tradition now if they have anything about Katino in the Walt robot show at Disneyland I

678
01:09:47,180 --> 01:09:51,980
will be very interested I would be very impressed I would love that I don't think he'll say like

679
01:09:51,980 --> 01:09:56,140
at the like his last sentence would be like and also Disneyland will never be finished

680
01:09:56,140 --> 01:10:01,340
and in 80 years I'd like to build a series of homes out in the middle of the desert called

681
01:10:01,340 --> 01:10:10,860
Katino in tribute to smoke tree ranch I feel like I saw one of the houses is the Incredibles house

682
01:10:10,860 --> 01:10:16,220
oh this just did come out yes I didn't I was like no we're not that campy but like it's like one

683
01:10:16,220 --> 01:10:21,260
house is the Incredibles house and the rest are normal houses is that what it is I think there's

684
01:10:21,260 --> 01:10:26,780
other thematic houses coming but they're not going to be like a row of Incredibles houses on

685
01:10:26,780 --> 01:10:32,860
the street I can't speak to that so like the richest people on the block how many millions

686
01:10:32,860 --> 01:10:38,220
is that house gonna well that's what I'm saying so the richest people in that like whatever you

687
01:10:38,220 --> 01:10:43,420
call it subdivision or something will own the Incredibles house so you'll know like oh we live

688
01:10:43,420 --> 01:10:46,940
in the Incredibles house like those are the those are the fancy people on the block even though I'm

689
01:10:46,940 --> 01:10:51,100
sure all that stuff is going to be very expensive they'll all be fancy on some level but yeah

690
01:10:51,100 --> 01:10:56,940
the fanciest people will live in the Incredibles house I saw there's like pictures or art I guess

691
01:10:56,940 --> 01:11:02,780
art of it yeah like and it is like the mid-century modern very tall ceiling yeah which is a cool

692
01:11:02,780 --> 01:11:08,860
looking house it does look cool but is it going to be like that Simpsons house that they built

693
01:11:08,860 --> 01:11:14,780
years ago for that promotion yeah somebody didn't move in I don't know that may be an episode for us

694
01:11:14,780 --> 01:11:20,300
oh yeah we got to look into that because I think we all tried to enter yes like I want to live in

695
01:11:20,300 --> 01:11:24,140
that house sure I wanted to too but they built Simpsons house in the middle of nowhere

696
01:11:25,020 --> 01:11:30,300
and I think they just in the last couple years had to like demolish it or do something with it

697
01:11:30,300 --> 01:11:40,220
yeah um some other stuff from the books cool BMX bike chase at one point yes Amanda and Finn both

698
01:11:40,220 --> 01:11:50,860
know how to ride their bikes up and down uh ramps and stuff in a skate park yes they are about to

699
01:11:50,860 --> 01:11:58,540
clothesline someone on a mini bike who is chasing them yes it is never quite revealed I guess it's

700
01:11:58,540 --> 01:12:08,780
assumed that's maybe Jess or Maleficent right um but uh what else yeah there's a cool dinosaur

701
01:12:08,780 --> 01:12:15,660
chase a big thunder yeah so so there's a this is I this is I like this a lot the the skeleton

702
01:12:15,660 --> 01:12:21,100
of the dinosaur on big thunder comes to life so this is because you're thinking about like well

703
01:12:21,100 --> 01:12:27,820
what would happen at Disneyland and this is one of the things that I think is very fun and imaginative

704
01:12:27,820 --> 01:12:33,340
and it would be good in a movie I guess what I'm saying that would be a good set piece in a movie

705
01:12:33,340 --> 01:12:39,180
yeah and it's like it's not it's not uh destroying you know it's not like sacrilege

706
01:12:39,180 --> 01:12:43,660
like the small world dolls coming to life and being killers you know it just feels fun well

707
01:12:43,660 --> 01:12:47,180
this is just a monster this is a dinosaur you know it doesn't know any better it's all it's been

708
01:12:47,180 --> 01:12:55,100
reanimated now I think this is a set piece in night at the museum the like oh yes fossils come

709
01:12:55,100 --> 01:13:02,060
to life and chase Ben Stiller yes that is right um I feel like that is that is something a kid

710
01:13:02,060 --> 01:13:06,380
in general would when they see those fossils is like well is this going to come to life

711
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:16,140
rooting around on the dark catwalks of space mountain was I never considered it but I'm like

712
01:13:16,140 --> 01:13:25,900
oh I would like to do that that sounds cool so I mean just in general like going on the track in

713
01:13:25,900 --> 01:13:31,420
space mountain has always been kind of interesting yeah in general I mean I've seen we've seen videos

714
01:13:31,420 --> 01:13:36,860
now of space mountain with the lights on so it's not like so mysterious it just looks like kind of

715
01:13:37,980 --> 01:13:43,340
you know metal and oh I've seen it I've been on the people mover and it's been oh yeah we

716
01:13:43,340 --> 01:13:48,140
last time we were there I think in Orlando I think that happened to me at least yeah we went

717
01:13:48,140 --> 01:13:54,380
through it and was full lights on so you could see it and it's like you know it's not so exciting

718
01:13:54,380 --> 01:14:01,020
but yeah that as a kid especially you know it would be very exciting to go in the catwalk I

719
01:14:01,020 --> 01:14:05,100
was trying to think too like what else we've talked many many times on the show about where

720
01:14:05,100 --> 01:14:11,100
you would want to kind of linger or host like like like host a party I was going to say that's not

721
01:14:11,100 --> 01:14:16,380
really what I meant but like yeah where you would want to chill out and it's like I think we've

722
01:14:16,380 --> 01:14:20,540
talked about like the pie in have we talked about like sleeping in the bed with the skeleton and

723
01:14:20,540 --> 01:14:27,660
pirates of the Caribbean oh sure yeah so so stuff like that um but that's more as an adult that's

724
01:14:27,660 --> 01:14:34,780
more where I'm thinking versus being out in space I would like to cuddle the pirate with the pigs

725
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:41,820
I'd like to scoot in there cuddle a pig put my head on the pirate's tummy well and also you're

726
01:14:41,820 --> 01:14:48,220
gonna be in the slop then yeah you'll be covered in slop sure right which would you assume is mud

727
01:14:48,220 --> 01:14:54,940
but also probably fecal matter um it's just slop it's a mix don't think about it too hard well it's

728
01:14:54,940 --> 01:14:59,820
not like is there a trough right by the pirate and the pig on pirates of the caribbean good question

729
01:14:59,820 --> 01:15:07,980
did he get the pigs out of a pen or did they wander out in the chaos right did he act I

730
01:15:07,980 --> 01:15:14,140
because it doesn't it's not near like a pig area right he's just in a butt like a muddy pile with

731
01:15:14,140 --> 01:15:19,980
the pig and he's drinking I assuming he's giving the pigs some moonshine or something as well is

732
01:15:19,980 --> 01:15:26,460
he a park star is there a park star the pig yes I gotta go through my boxes that is a park

733
01:15:26,460 --> 01:15:33,260
star if I have it I don't think I actually have the or no maybe I do um yeah that's not a bad one

734
01:15:33,260 --> 01:15:40,460
that's a that's another chill out chilled out place uh to hang but yeah he doesn't also seem

735
01:15:40,460 --> 01:15:46,700
like he's not that aggressive of a pirate because he's been sedated probably by his drinking yeah

736
01:15:47,420 --> 01:15:53,740
but yeah but Space Mountain is interesting I almost think that I was thinking that they

737
01:15:53,740 --> 01:15:57,660
were going to do it with these books make it a little more like fantastical like Space Mountain

738
01:15:57,660 --> 01:16:03,580
actually was a journey to space oh you know what I'm saying because they actually are treating the

739
01:16:03,580 --> 01:16:09,260
rides a little bit more functional they're very functional right as opposed to like saying well

740
01:16:09,260 --> 01:16:13,260
actually did you know Space Mountain actually does take you to space you think it's actually

741
01:16:13,260 --> 01:16:17,260
just a small building with a roller coaster inside but actually these vehicles do take you

742
01:16:17,260 --> 01:16:20,860
to space now I don't know if this happens in future books but I was thinking it would be more

743
01:16:20,860 --> 01:16:27,420
along those lines where when you go on pirates it actually is you actually now are in the reality of

744
01:16:27,980 --> 01:16:33,580
what 100 years ago 200 years ago yeah um but that isn't what it is it is mechanical it is Space

745
01:16:33,580 --> 01:16:38,540
Mountain is a roller coaster there's just stuff that happens and things come to life because of

746
01:16:39,100 --> 01:16:45,180
thousands of millions of people who believe yes but I'm also like has to be in the new

747
01:16:45,900 --> 01:16:52,220
the later books like well all the bad guys are coming to life and controlling animatronics

748
01:16:52,220 --> 01:16:57,660
right why don't they have allies of good guys who come to life for good guy animatronics you know

749
01:16:57,660 --> 01:17:02,140
well right and then anytime you see Pooh Bear he's just hanging out or like early on in the

750
01:17:02,140 --> 01:17:09,420
book they're like hey is that Tom Sawyer Tom Sawyer yeah shows up once from the distance and

751
01:17:09,420 --> 01:17:13,980
is never mentioned again right this that had to drive you crazy because you're like I want to

752
01:17:13,980 --> 01:17:20,460
hang with Tom very funny Tom Sawyer's smoking a big pipe he is smoking that's that's surprising

753
01:17:20,460 --> 01:17:27,260
like I want a Tom Sordick come over and offer them like snuff or tobacco you want a hit of this kids

754
01:17:28,140 --> 01:17:35,180
yeah how old is Tom Sawyer he's probably about 30 same age yeah yeah okay yeah because you would

755
01:17:35,180 --> 01:17:38,860
we would think it would be like a perfect opportunity I mean Tom Sawyer is not a

756
01:17:38,860 --> 01:17:42,940
Disney doesn't own Tom Sawyer anymore that's a public domain character at this point

757
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:47,020
but yeah you would think that they would have teamed up with some of these characters

758
01:17:47,020 --> 01:17:51,420
yeah in some ways and maybe again maybe it happens in one of the future books but

759
01:17:51,420 --> 01:17:55,900
I was yeah also expecting something like that to happen because there's plenty of good characters

760
01:17:55,900 --> 01:18:02,940
in Disneyland yeah absolutely certainly the good heroes outweigh the bad yeah but like

761
01:18:04,140 --> 01:18:11,420
speaking of good characters I do have to mention yeah as a product of the early 2000s I feel like

762
01:18:11,420 --> 01:18:22,300
Charlene and Willa are not really fleshed out sure they're not given a lot right I kept getting

763
01:18:22,300 --> 01:18:29,500
confused of like which is the nerd and which is the cheerleader yeah because in the second book

764
01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:38,860
they sort of reintroduce everyone and like any series they you know like a jack you pick up a

765
01:18:38,860 --> 01:18:44,860
jack creature mogul with the first chapter or two they're like he hitchhikes around he only carries

766
01:18:44,860 --> 01:18:54,220
his like ID debit card and passport right and a toothbrush and like if he has a cell phone he's

767
01:18:54,220 --> 01:19:03,900
stolen it from a bad guy right right he's using it so there the second book kind of reestablishes

768
01:19:03,900 --> 01:19:11,180
everyone including a very weird paragraph where they're like Charlene's growing up very fast much

769
01:19:11,180 --> 01:19:18,540
more a young woman than a child just seems more like 18 than 14 and I'm like all right slow down

770
01:19:18,540 --> 01:19:27,340
there slow down there buddy uh-huh uh so and she is very annoyed at Amanda at the start of the second

771
01:19:27,340 --> 01:19:32,140
book got it because they kind of disappear at the end of the first book and then they reappear

772
01:19:32,700 --> 01:19:39,500
there's a weather balloon there's monkeys there's an electrical storm it's a very exciting start to

773
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:46,140
the second book so it's hooked me oh wow um yeah I um you brought up those characters I don't know

774
01:19:46,140 --> 01:19:49,980
that I would have been able to pull them off the top of my head yeah um I'm looking through some

775
01:19:49,980 --> 01:19:57,260
of my notes here and uh all I all I have is about them and their costumes that they wore when they

776
01:19:57,260 --> 01:20:01,420
met at and this is another thing that made me laugh they met at the ticket and transportation center

777
01:20:03,180 --> 01:20:07,980
on Sunday morning which again in some sort of an adventure book to say and we met at the ticket

778
01:20:07,980 --> 01:20:12,860
and transportation center at Disney World is hilarious and this is you were mentioning this

779
01:20:12,860 --> 01:20:20,540
earlier when they have to all wear disguises or costumes yeah and Wayne has set up uh tarps in the

780
01:20:20,540 --> 01:20:26,780
bus modesty tarps so the girls can change in the back and the boys can change at the front

781
01:20:26,780 --> 01:20:33,020
and the costume can I read the costumes yes uh Finn is a Tom Sawyer paper boy which what does

782
01:20:33,020 --> 01:20:39,740
that mean does Tom Sawyer paper boy in the story it's kind of a mix no I think it's mixing up like

783
01:20:39,740 --> 01:20:45,740
Newsy style paper boys and Tom Sawyer Charlene is dressed as a paddle wheel boat deckhand

784
01:20:46,380 --> 01:20:52,620
okay Willa is a restaurant server Maybach wears the clothing and turban of a crew member at the

785
01:20:52,620 --> 01:21:00,860
Aladdin carpet ride and Philby is a jungle cruise captain but uh Maybach is tall yes so

786
01:21:01,820 --> 01:21:09,580
at some point they uh he gets in a crowd they mistake him for Aladdin and kids want his

787
01:21:09,580 --> 01:21:18,940
autograph right yes yes I though I believe the quick log line rundown is like Finn is a leader

788
01:21:19,580 --> 01:21:28,460
uh Maybach uh is black uh Philby is British Willa is a nerd and Charlene is pretty

789
01:21:29,420 --> 01:21:36,620
that's how it's done uh-huh oh yeah but there's a diverse that's diverse there it is it is a

790
01:21:36,620 --> 01:21:46,940
diverse line yes it they are multiple races and stuff as are Amanda and levels of 13 year old uh

791
01:21:46,940 --> 01:21:57,420
hot yeah yeah okay uh um so uh Finn is a friend named Dillard who is annoying that yes they don't

792
01:21:57,420 --> 01:22:04,780
really they the poor guy gets dumped on a lot uh does anyone know a person named Dillard is there

793
01:22:04,780 --> 01:22:11,020
a Dillard in our audience that's an interesting name too Dillard that is Dillard Archie universe

794
01:22:11,740 --> 01:22:17,900
is it Dillard is that his name is it uh no is it Dilton Dilton is the name it's someone's

795
01:22:17,900 --> 01:22:22,940
Dilton Doily is the name I think Dilton Doily is the character you're thinking of and is she

796
01:22:22,940 --> 01:22:31,340
is he Mage's sister is Dilton Dilton is someone's uh brother brother brother sorry

797
01:22:32,220 --> 01:22:37,660
getting too excited Dilton's significant other Betty Cooper and Cheryl Blass I mean I guess they

798
01:22:37,660 --> 01:22:44,780
all dated each other at some point um character resembling Dilton uh family character background

799
01:22:44,780 --> 01:22:52,060
Dilton is depicted as a stereotypical nerdy teenager um hmm I don't hmm his teachers

800
01:22:52,060 --> 01:23:00,060
particularly professor flutes newt are very proud of his achievements coach keats um I don't know

801
01:23:00,060 --> 01:23:05,660
I don't know who he's really moose mason is Dilton's closest friend Dilton's other close

802
01:23:05,660 --> 01:23:11,180
friends Archie Betty Jughead Jones he helped the gang many times with his various inventions or

803
01:23:11,180 --> 01:23:16,700
with his vast knowledge who did you say he's related to I thought he was related to moose's

804
01:23:16,700 --> 01:23:22,780
girlfriend hmm I don't know you're gonna have to look that up on your own I don't know

805
01:23:23,820 --> 01:23:30,060
Dilton's relation I mean we should definitely find that we could bring this podcast to a halt

806
01:23:30,060 --> 01:23:36,460
until we find out who Dilton is related to um but Dillard yeah Dillard I've never heard that

807
01:23:36,460 --> 01:23:41,740
name before even in fiction I'm not sure I've heard of it as a department store name because

808
01:23:41,740 --> 01:23:49,740
it's so it's one lettered one letter away from Dillard yeah which I I think he didn't really get

809
01:23:49,740 --> 01:23:57,580
a read he should have a redemption arc Dillard yeah he should become rise of I thought I thought

810
01:23:58,140 --> 01:24:04,860
him and Amanda were going to become kingdom keepers oh right but Amanda keeps saying her

811
01:24:04,860 --> 01:24:12,140
family works in administration right so she can kind of go anywhere right which I think is mostly

812
01:24:12,140 --> 01:24:16,940
a plot device who do you relate to more of with all these when you come to all these characters

813
01:24:16,940 --> 01:24:23,660
well in all these books I always wanted to be thin the cool leader okay Finn who feels like

814
01:24:23,660 --> 01:24:31,740
nerdy and unconfident yeah and then all the girls seem to like thin okay but he in the in

815
01:24:31,740 --> 01:24:38,220
the introduction of the second book they mentioned that Philby is British has a shock of red hair

816
01:24:38,220 --> 01:24:45,260
right and all the girls like him but he is mostly concerned about computers and rock climbing he

817
01:24:45,340 --> 01:24:51,980
loves every weekend hitting the climbing wall right I feel like I'm more of a philby

818
01:24:52,780 --> 01:24:56,940
do you yeah okay even though I don't like rock climbing but I like rock and roll

819
01:24:57,660 --> 01:25:03,180
yeah so it's a different kind of rock but I I don't know I don't know that I identify with

820
01:25:03,180 --> 01:25:09,260
anyone too strongly here it seems like all the girls did like you no all the girls do not like

821
01:25:09,260 --> 01:25:14,780
you tell these stories and certainly when we were in the improv world you had some admirers

822
01:25:15,500 --> 01:25:24,460
yeah there were certainly admirers there were admirers I that is true I I certainly once I got

823
01:25:24,460 --> 01:25:30,780
older I realized that I was I when I was younger I thought I had no admirers and then when I got a

824
01:25:30,780 --> 01:25:36,940
little older I realized there were admirers I just was pulling my hand away I was staring straight

825
01:25:36,940 --> 01:25:42,380
ahead at the basketball machine well you had a child with one of them well so that was later

826
01:25:42,380 --> 01:25:49,020
that was later yeah yeah that was fine that was good but yes yes that was fine I did not do no

827
01:25:49,020 --> 01:25:53,100
one should feel bad for me I've said that no one should feel bad what was me I was a little dork

828
01:25:53,100 --> 01:25:58,620
or anything there were nice people that were interested that would have given me a smooch

829
01:25:58,620 --> 01:26:03,660
if I was comfortable with it I just wasn't comfortable with it and I didn't realize I

830
01:26:03,660 --> 01:26:08,060
wasn't comfortable with it until years later yeah that is so I don't want to and I don't want to

831
01:26:08,060 --> 01:26:14,060
act like I'm I was mr macho cool guy either I'm not I'm not saying oh my god everybody liked me

832
01:26:14,060 --> 01:26:18,940
that's not what I'm saying either I'm just saying I was too scared at and I didn't realize it until

833
01:26:18,940 --> 01:26:26,380
a very late age oh what was going on about all of it so I look if Phil Philby is I don't know

834
01:26:26,380 --> 01:26:32,700
who was more attractive the lazy was it Finn was it Philby I don't know I liked I liked Philby I

835
01:26:32,700 --> 01:26:36,700
would have thought he was funny I think as a kid that's really what I cared about he knew all the

836
01:26:36,700 --> 01:26:43,580
facts he knew all the facts related to that yeah they say at one point like and if he didn't know

837
01:26:43,580 --> 01:26:48,700
something he knew how to look it up right I think you were probably you would have been a mix of

838
01:26:48,700 --> 01:26:56,540
Finn and Wayne very old man the very old man mysterious man who worked with wall pretty annoying

839
01:26:56,540 --> 01:27:01,820
at the end if by the end of the book I'm like I didn't just tell them I did not care for Wayne

840
01:27:01,900 --> 01:27:06,940
yeah I was kind of a little creep I was annoyed with Wayne the whole book and early on in the book

841
01:27:06,940 --> 01:27:12,140
I was very annoyed with Wayne because I'm listening to the audiobook and I'm and like Wayne keeps

842
01:27:12,140 --> 01:27:17,900
saying these cryptic things look over what do you think why are you here and this is verbatim when

843
01:27:17,900 --> 01:27:23,740
he said like why are you here what are you doing and Finn would just be like I don't know what's

844
01:27:23,740 --> 01:27:28,700
going on and he keep asking these questions and questions and I'm like Wayne god damn it just tell

845
01:27:28,700 --> 01:27:33,820
this poor kid what's happening he was so mysterious you're like just tell him what's going on Wayne

846
01:27:34,380 --> 01:27:39,980
stop being annoying so yes I was irritated with Wayne the whole time and he never came fully clean

847
01:27:39,980 --> 01:27:44,060
and maybe eventually he doesn't explains why he was being so mysterious but I don't buy it

848
01:27:44,060 --> 01:27:50,060
I think Wayne was being annoying yeah he was annoying so I I don't I'm not a big Wayne fan

849
01:27:50,060 --> 01:27:55,500
at this point you will tell me later when you read all 20 of these books if Wayne gets cool

850
01:27:55,500 --> 01:28:01,900
let's let me get through the first seven then we'll see about the return and inheritance series

851
01:28:01,900 --> 01:28:06,540
I hope it's not stolen valor as far as like working with Walt or he's lying to him about

852
01:28:06,540 --> 01:28:16,540
working with Walt I want I want them to meet in another Imagineer and they say like Wayne

853
01:28:17,900 --> 01:28:24,460
if it's who I'm thinking of he died years ago and it's like he's some sort of ghost or benevolent

854
01:28:24,460 --> 01:28:28,620
spirit I was hoping you were going the way of like they run into an old Imagineer and they go

855
01:28:28,620 --> 01:28:33,820
oh yeah I know one of your colleagues Wayne and that guy goes Wayne that guy delivered coffee to

856
01:28:33,820 --> 01:28:40,140
us once and now he goes around talking about how he worked with Walt yeah bullshit he worked with

857
01:28:40,140 --> 01:28:46,380
Walt he got in the door one time and he was too annoying he kept pitching Walt a bunch of movies

858
01:28:47,100 --> 01:28:53,500
different Hans Christian Andersen movies bullshit that guy we had to kick him out we he would stand

859
01:28:53,500 --> 01:28:59,660
outside the gates of the Walt Disney Studios yelling stuff and holding up signs he had multiple

860
01:28:59,660 --> 01:29:06,460
scripts about the continuing adventures of the Breyer characters and uncle Rivas he's where like

861
01:29:06,460 --> 01:29:13,900
times have changed Wayne he wanted to make 10 sequels the song of the south he wrote it up

862
01:29:13,900 --> 01:29:17,740
in the bible and he kept slipping it under the gate and giving it to security guards

863
01:29:18,380 --> 01:29:25,180
Wayne give it up Wayne give it up Wayne give it up you old crook so hopefully that

864
01:29:25,180 --> 01:29:29,580
happens hopefully they reveal that yeah later on in the book but yes I don't like Wayne

865
01:29:30,220 --> 01:29:35,660
the kids were fine but Wayne got Wayne was too much for me that it's funny yeah I didn't think

866
01:29:35,660 --> 01:29:46,220
I liked all the kids but Wayne was so cryptic it was very like master splintery at first and then

867
01:29:46,220 --> 01:29:52,860
it's like Wayne you're making this so much harder for everyone just tell them same with Amanda like

868
01:29:52,860 --> 01:29:58,780
you're not ready like just tell him right so yeah I don't know if he knew at the start what

869
01:29:58,780 --> 01:30:04,060
Wayne was doing or he was just like kind of a lazy writing thing where it was just like I don't know

870
01:30:04,060 --> 01:30:11,340
yet Wayne will just say hey you'll learn it later you know they have set up there's three guys and

871
01:30:11,340 --> 01:30:19,820
two girls in the kingdom keepers yeah and then there's Amanda and Jess and there's also Dillard

872
01:30:20,380 --> 01:30:25,980
I think this is enough where everyone could theoretically couple up by the end of the books

873
01:30:25,980 --> 01:30:32,300
oh if the girls are real if they're not spirits oh you think some of these girls are spirits

874
01:30:32,540 --> 01:30:43,180
well Amanda has powers Jess did have powers and then Finn hologrammed through her how old is Snow

875
01:30:43,180 --> 01:30:47,580
White in the movie Snow White she is young are they all third all the Disney princesses they never

876
01:30:47,580 --> 01:30:55,580
really acknowledge it are they all 13 is 16 in the original fables yes right so hypothetically

877
01:30:56,540 --> 01:31:03,900
Dillard could get with oh Dillard could marry Snow White or Snow White right which would be

878
01:31:03,900 --> 01:31:09,740
interesting it would be interesting you think that happens in a future book I have seen like

879
01:31:09,740 --> 01:31:16,300
fantasy stuff in movies where like isn't that a thing in Enchanted she comes to the real world

880
01:31:16,300 --> 01:31:25,100
and marries Patrick Dempsey right okay if you if they were uh your same age or you were their same

881
01:31:25,100 --> 01:31:32,940
age who would you take as a bride that's in disneyland oh gosh oh uh not of the keepers like

882
01:31:32,940 --> 01:31:37,900
no of a character right or a friend I mean we don't have to make this romantic it could be

883
01:31:37,900 --> 01:31:43,180
just a friend yeah or or yeah see what happens you'd be interested in going on a date with

884
01:31:44,140 --> 01:31:50,140
so-and-so who it has to be a robot or like a face character or a costume character yeah

885
01:31:51,100 --> 01:31:57,900
I mean cinderella seems very interesting she has an interesting back she does seem

886
01:31:57,900 --> 01:32:02,860
interesting the filth of humanity well you're marrying into money and that becomes royalty

887
01:32:03,980 --> 01:32:11,020
well is the prince dead in that scenario well if you kill him he is oh okay do I oh I become

888
01:32:11,020 --> 01:32:17,100
oh you could I'm just saying you could prince jason you become prince jason um I think I would

889
01:32:17,900 --> 01:32:24,780
I don't know it'd be cool to be friends with like Flynn Rider and Rapunzel they seem very chill

890
01:32:24,780 --> 01:32:33,980
sure I was thinking I could go out with the Alice and Janie robot on star tours oh yeah she seems

891
01:32:33,980 --> 01:32:38,460
very cool yeah like a kind of like she's got obviously she's like a flight attendant

892
01:32:38,460 --> 01:32:43,900
she's got a job she's got a job got a got a career she's on top of her stuff she knows like

893
01:32:43,900 --> 01:32:50,460
she's good at her job confident well put together confident good voice great voice yeah so I'm not

894
01:32:50,460 --> 01:32:55,180
saying I'm going to commit to marrying her in this alternate universe but we'll see where it goes

895
01:32:55,180 --> 01:32:59,740
sure we'll see where it goes I don't know if she she should appear in some future I don't what is

896
01:32:59,740 --> 01:33:03,660
the character's name what is the droids I don't know name we should look that is something we

897
01:33:03,660 --> 01:33:08,300
should do we haven't done the second star tours either oh good we've only done the original version

898
01:33:08,380 --> 01:33:14,140
there's been a lot of changes there has been a lot of changes that is for sure all right go to cosmic

899
01:33:14,140 --> 01:33:20,460
rays also in the book they do yes for juicy burgers some juicy burgers okay that is confusing when

900
01:33:20,460 --> 01:33:25,980
there are holograms they may back makes them turkey burgers right they're turkey I don't

901
01:33:25,980 --> 01:33:31,260
forget that detail specifically it says he makes them delicious turkey 20 years ago they serve a

902
01:33:31,260 --> 01:33:37,660
turkey burger at cosmic rays apparently that's well that was they don't serve turkey burgers now

903
01:33:37,660 --> 01:33:44,220
that was the healthy option no now it's impossible burgers right so so do you think they did in 2005

904
01:33:44,220 --> 01:33:49,180
serve turkey burgers I think that was the if you're trying to watch your figure

905
01:33:50,540 --> 01:33:54,460
you're having a turkey burger instead of a hamburger no I hear you I'm just saying it seems

906
01:33:54,460 --> 01:34:00,140
even for 2005 it seems it seems impossible that they would have served turkey it seems like dad

907
01:34:00,140 --> 01:34:06,060
would be so upset if he saw that on the menu in 2005 in Florida yeah but let me let me let's look

908
01:34:06,060 --> 01:34:13,740
into that because that is interesting it was just a little confusing some time like so they have

909
01:34:13,740 --> 01:34:17,740
they're hungry they get hungry when they're holograms when they're holograms right but they

910
01:34:17,740 --> 01:34:23,580
can also float in water but they can go through stuff right but they're still trying to master

911
01:34:23,580 --> 01:34:30,220
that power like kitty pride of the x-men right so yeah I assume they get more powers as the series

912
01:34:30,220 --> 01:34:41,100
goes I'm guessing yeah I would think because yeah Finn phased through Jess enough that it made her

913
01:34:41,100 --> 01:34:48,940
good again much like kitty probably can phase through computers and short circuit them right

914
01:34:48,940 --> 01:34:55,500
yes so I assume they may be ascend to these like godlike figures perhaps by the end maybe

915
01:34:55,580 --> 01:35:00,060
where they're kingdom keepers now it is interesting that the kids we've kind of touched on this the

916
01:35:00,060 --> 01:35:05,580
heroes of the park are not the heroes these are just random kids that have as you said a certain

917
01:35:05,580 --> 01:35:13,180
set of skills well so you the reader can imagine yourself in their positions I am very curious that

918
01:35:13,180 --> 01:35:21,420
the last book is like senior year in high school do they start asking each other to prom right oh

919
01:35:21,420 --> 01:35:26,780
interesting you think maybe that's maybe a full book of like trying to get up the nerve yeah

920
01:35:26,780 --> 01:35:34,620
because like do Amanda and Jess stick around does Finn ask Amanda right does Dillard end up going

921
01:35:34,620 --> 01:35:42,220
with one of the does Dillard get into the crew maybe Jason goes solo but he brings a little pig

922
01:35:42,220 --> 01:35:48,140
from pirates with him as a buddy I would love that if you showed up at your senior prom with a little

923
01:35:48,140 --> 01:35:53,580
pig you think I'd be the hit I was gonna say that people would have been gone would have been

924
01:35:53,580 --> 01:35:58,620
going nuts going nuts yeah man that would have been a good move I would have spent all my time

925
01:35:58,620 --> 01:36:05,020
with a photo guy handing off the pig everyone's a picture with the pig right and then the pig

926
01:36:05,020 --> 01:36:09,420
would give you a little kiss at the end of the night oh that'd be a dream yeah it's safer than

927
01:36:09,420 --> 01:36:15,340
my prom date who had laryngitis where I like I guess I'm not getting a kiss tonight she had

928
01:36:15,340 --> 01:36:20,540
laryngitis yes she was very ill and looking back I'm like you should not have come

929
01:36:21,260 --> 01:36:28,060
yeah you also shouldn't have shouldn't have bothered sleeping on the floor of our friend's

930
01:36:28,060 --> 01:36:33,980
house like we all slept on the floor in the basement that night yeah it was complicated

931
01:36:33,980 --> 01:36:38,860
she was secretly dating one of our other friends you've talked about yeah it's very complicated

932
01:36:38,860 --> 01:36:42,860
very complicated right but you if you were writing your own kingdom keepers you would

933
01:36:42,860 --> 01:36:49,740
put this drama in there oh sure yeah yeah now I was thinking about this I probably would have

934
01:36:49,740 --> 01:36:55,740
pined for mana but I should have asked Willow right we we probably had the most in common and

935
01:36:55,740 --> 01:37:04,780
I didn't see it I was blinded by the allure of distant people yeah I feel like as a kid what

936
01:37:04,780 --> 01:37:12,060
would have been my fantasy would it have been fighting Maleficent in Disney World or would it

937
01:37:12,060 --> 01:37:19,500
have been moving into Disney World full-time permanently I think it would be the second one

938
01:37:19,500 --> 01:37:23,660
that would be if I'm I don't we're not jumping necessarily to full critiques or plus-ups I guess

939
01:37:23,660 --> 01:37:29,740
but maybe we can um is that you take sort of your all the things I've said over the years on this

940
01:37:29,740 --> 01:37:34,380
podcast about what I liked about x-men what I liked about Star Trek the Next Generation

941
01:37:34,380 --> 01:37:40,300
and what I assume kids like about Harry Potter is that you would go into the special little place

942
01:37:40,300 --> 01:37:45,260
you'd have your own little room everything there makes you feel special it's got its

943
01:37:45,260 --> 01:37:50,460
own type of food it's got its own way you get your food and then you hang out with your friends

944
01:37:51,020 --> 01:37:57,820
from fiction and yes x-men you're fighting Harry Potter you're fighting Star Trek you fight

945
01:37:57,820 --> 01:38:04,620
but the real lure of it to me as a kid was getting to go to a special place where you felt special

946
01:38:04,620 --> 01:38:11,900
that was very unique and had like whimsical magic in different ways happening yeah so I wonder if

947
01:38:11,900 --> 01:38:19,340
they ever move permanently into the Magic Kingdom or the the Ticken and Transportation Center or

948
01:38:20,060 --> 01:38:24,860
the different the Utila doors I wonder if that's an aspect eventually that happens because

949
01:38:25,820 --> 01:38:30,060
I would think that as a kid you would be like I want to move into Cinderella's castle

950
01:38:30,700 --> 01:38:38,220
yes I want to sleep in Dopey's bed on the Snow White ride okay I want to live in the in the

951
01:38:38,780 --> 01:38:46,700
jewel mine on Snow White it it seems like at the end like a bunch of magic they get the pen

952
01:38:47,420 --> 01:38:53,900
they hit the magic a drop of ink falls on the magic plans right and then all this magic and

953
01:38:53,900 --> 01:38:59,980
fireworks very similar to the ending of the Power Rangers movie where they're all like yeah

954
01:38:59,980 --> 01:39:07,580
and there's fireworks that everyone celebrates yeah yeah yeah Van Hagar Dreams one of my favorite

955
01:39:07,580 --> 01:39:16,620
Van Halen songs I think they should have used their magic to clean up 2005 era 2006 era Magic

956
01:39:16,620 --> 01:39:24,620
Kingdom well because when I I think I went to Disney World the summer of 2006 it was very

957
01:39:25,500 --> 01:39:32,380
rainy on and off and it looked a little worse for wear up people eyes yeah and then I came to LA

958
01:39:32,380 --> 01:39:41,100
and saw Disneyland just looked immaculate because they had just had the 50th I was like they should

959
01:39:41,100 --> 01:39:47,260
have cleaned up it doesn't mention the Magic Kingdom looking a little worse for wear one

960
01:39:47,260 --> 01:39:52,460
kid should have been very good at being a janitor and his power was picking things up and making

961
01:39:52,460 --> 01:39:56,540
sure everything looked good and he could have had like a little bucket of paint with him like magic

962
01:39:56,540 --> 01:40:02,220
should be painting yeah you should be painting or there's apparently one guy right now in Epcot

963
01:40:02,220 --> 01:40:11,020
like one um I saw this on Twitter one guy going around and like fixing effects

964
01:40:11,820 --> 01:40:18,220
fixing lighting fixing a guy who works at Epcot yeah like a maintenance operations guy

965
01:40:19,500 --> 01:40:26,780
this is what the rumor mill says although that said the glowing floor uh the glowing ground

966
01:40:26,780 --> 01:40:32,060
they added by special birth is apparently broken and can't be fixed unless they dig it up

967
01:40:32,060 --> 01:40:36,140
is that true I don't know oh okay the way you were setting it up in my mind I was thinking

968
01:40:36,140 --> 01:40:43,100
there's like a vigilante going around Epcot painting like like somebody who's self-deputized

969
01:40:43,100 --> 01:40:48,060
no he's on the payroll but he may have taken this on as a project but maybe that is what

970
01:40:48,060 --> 01:40:53,420
needs to happen because like in Batman Batman takes it upon himself because the police can't

971
01:40:53,420 --> 01:41:00,380
get things done so he's he deputizes himself as the law yeah so maybe that's what has to happen

972
01:41:00,380 --> 01:41:06,380
at Epcot center is that somebody decides they're Batman but instead of like beating up criminals

973
01:41:06,940 --> 01:41:13,100
or super villains they go around with a bucket of paint and different lights new light bulbs

974
01:41:13,100 --> 01:41:19,340
yeah to change things out because somebody's got to do it yeah and maybe it's up to a very

975
01:41:19,340 --> 01:41:27,260
enthusiastic fan to put on a costume and go around to fix things well they should they should be

976
01:41:27,260 --> 01:41:33,420
people working for the company and vigilante so you get the whole Bat family they all have different

977
01:41:33,420 --> 01:41:40,780
Nightwing and Asriel and different approaches you know sure but like Batman or if a really ambitious

978
01:41:40,780 --> 01:41:46,220
Batman who's just like I'm gonna go fix the Yeti on Expedition Everest when the park is closed I

979
01:41:46,220 --> 01:41:51,100
know what to do yeah I know how to get that thing working again if they fix the Yeti I think that

980
01:41:51,100 --> 01:41:56,860
would get them like six months to a year of goodwill right where it would just be you mean

981
01:41:56,860 --> 01:42:02,700
they vigilante or you mean Disney itself I mean I mean Disney itself it Disney itself fixes the

982
01:42:02,700 --> 01:42:09,260
Yeti for real but what if there's like a real like tech nerd who can put on a costume and in

983
01:42:09,260 --> 01:42:14,860
the dead of night sneak into Expedition Everest and fix that Yeti that would be great yeah and

984
01:42:14,860 --> 01:42:20,060
then that would be a hero yeah some people in the company Disney would be like upset upset with this

985
01:42:20,060 --> 01:42:25,180
his tactics he's not going by the book but then there'd be like one guy in the company who's like

986
01:42:25,180 --> 01:42:31,100
no he's good he's a force for good around here maybe maybe they get one of those in later books

987
01:42:31,100 --> 01:42:36,700
like a guy who's like who's gonna fix things I heard the rumors of the kingdom keepers

988
01:42:36,700 --> 01:42:42,940
so I've deputized myself to be a keeper they're like no it's too dangerous like one you're not

989
01:42:42,940 --> 01:42:49,820
a hologram it'll get hurt like this Batman type figure who like every night changes a little

990
01:42:49,820 --> 01:42:57,340
piece of journey into your imagination back to the original ride yes slowly but surely slowly

991
01:42:57,340 --> 01:43:04,540
building slowly building a dream finder animatronic in there yeah somebody yeah somebody

992
01:43:04,540 --> 01:43:11,740
selflessly fixing things I don't know I don't know like what you would even call like a Batman version

993
01:43:13,100 --> 01:43:19,500
imagine I don't know we got to come up with a name here is what I'm saying really like a dream in here

994
01:43:21,180 --> 01:43:28,060
dream in here but it'd have to be like it would have to be a fix in here fix in here man like man

995
01:43:28,060 --> 01:43:31,820
or like super it would have to have kind of a superhero name or I guess the Punisher is a

996
01:43:31,820 --> 01:43:38,780
vigilante the fix the imaginer the imaginer okay that's good yeah yeah imaginer and it's got like

997
01:43:38,780 --> 01:43:45,900
he's got like a symbol on or he whoever has a symbol on their chest of like of like a cast

998
01:43:45,900 --> 01:43:50,220
member badge but it's fucked up yeah it's a little fucked up and then there's like they're

999
01:43:50,220 --> 01:43:55,580
holding like a wrench or something yeah they're holding a little wrench to fix things like a wrench

1000
01:43:55,580 --> 01:44:00,940
and a light bulb in the other skeleton hand yes and if it's like paint around the neck like a

1001
01:44:00,940 --> 01:44:06,540
bucket of paint like hanging off their neck sure and they go around and fix the parks they just

1002
01:44:06,540 --> 01:44:12,380
want to do what's right that's our only drive right it's like I've got to fix this right the

1003
01:44:12,380 --> 01:44:18,620
imaginer and if he wards off overtakers this will be it this is not a bad idea for a series of books

1004
01:44:19,180 --> 01:44:25,820
yeah the imaginer and then yeah so though you would have like park employees and then you would I

1005
01:44:25,820 --> 01:44:32,220
guess you could tell the story from the perspective of guests and there's like some mystery there and

1006
01:44:32,220 --> 01:44:36,700
and then eventually you can start to do stories from the perspective of the imaginer and yeah

1007
01:44:36,700 --> 01:44:42,220
that's good the imaginers like cave well I'll take something from Jack Reacher some of the books are

1008
01:44:42,220 --> 01:44:47,660
written in the third person right some of the books are written in the first person okay so you

1009
01:44:47,660 --> 01:44:52,380
hear Jack Reacher's thought you flip around yeah because like at the start of Batman you're kind

1010
01:44:52,380 --> 01:44:57,500
of in the perspective of the criminal right away and then Batman shows up so you get to like see

1011
01:44:57,500 --> 01:45:01,420
what the fear is like for this mysterious character yeah and then eventually you are

1012
01:45:01,420 --> 01:45:05,980
in the back cave and you're like experiencing the story through Batman's point of view oh man

1013
01:45:05,980 --> 01:45:11,980
imagine the imaginers the imaginer that's what we're going I think we've determined the imaginer

1014
01:45:11,980 --> 01:45:19,980
he's like uh alford or microchip like his helper right his man in the chair you know I kept

1015
01:45:19,980 --> 01:45:27,260
imagining the dillard character as the character from the disney stony spider the guy who's like

1016
01:45:27,820 --> 01:45:33,420
I'm your man in the chair who is that character the friend Peter Parker's friend in the movies

1017
01:45:34,060 --> 01:45:39,580
who was his friend in the movies do you not remember like the the bigger kid oh in the new

1018
01:45:39,580 --> 01:45:45,740
movie in the new movie yeah Ned yeah yeah I like Ned I like Ned too yeah I I for some reason I

1019
01:45:45,740 --> 01:45:51,580
was thinking about the uh toby mcguire movies oh no yeah Ned he has like no friends in the

1020
01:45:51,580 --> 01:45:57,340
toby mcguire movie which I guess is I don't know I feel like in the comics traditionally

1021
01:45:57,340 --> 01:46:05,100
Peter Parker has a giant friend group Betty Brant and Flash Thompson that's a whole discussion about

1022
01:46:05,100 --> 01:46:10,220
like how cool he should be he's kind of the 90s spider-man cartoon he's kind of cool actually

1023
01:46:10,860 --> 01:46:15,500
yeah he's like handsome and cool and that was not necessarily what it is but then he was also funny

1024
01:46:16,060 --> 01:46:22,300
and he's different kinds of funny that's a whole look running we're running low on time here for

1025
01:46:22,300 --> 01:46:29,420
this episode sure but they should they they're back to square one right uh they should do a spider

1026
01:46:29,420 --> 01:46:35,740
and I'm assuming they're going to do like street level spider-man oh look if you believe the

1027
01:46:35,740 --> 01:46:42,060
rumors there's a push and pull at Sony about do we want more multiverse or do we want street level

1028
01:46:42,780 --> 01:46:47,420
so that's all I don't know that's all rumors right now but that's that pops up into my feed right

1029
01:46:47,420 --> 01:46:51,660
from time to time yeah so we'll see but the imaginer is what we care about this new character

1030
01:46:51,660 --> 01:46:56,220
we've created the series of books that we're going to write or you'll write and I'll edit

1031
01:46:56,220 --> 01:47:02,140
he can be like a Casey Jones figure for the kingdom keepers yeah well he's not a part of

1032
01:47:02,140 --> 01:47:08,780
the king he's a different he's our he's different uh yeah but maybe we'll cross over at some point

1033
01:47:08,780 --> 01:47:14,140
maybe we'll get our own multiverse going like we'll have a series of books called the imaginer

1034
01:47:14,140 --> 01:47:17,340
but then we'll have the other series of books like I'm talking about living and they'll be called

1035
01:47:17,340 --> 01:47:25,660
like yeah the park livers park livers they'll be called the park livers well that sounds like

1036
01:47:25,660 --> 01:47:30,940
liver though I hear what you're saying but that's unfortunately the name of it is the park oh okay

1037
01:47:30,940 --> 01:47:36,860
we'll workshop it no I didn't know okay all right determine the title no notes got it the park

1038
01:47:36,860 --> 01:47:42,140
livers and their kids that go and live in the park and they decide where they're going to live

1039
01:47:42,780 --> 01:47:49,100
and then they just sort of exist and they have the you know the romantic situations they have the

1040
01:47:49,100 --> 01:47:55,020
normal growing up stuff it's just now they live in the different disney parks I think if the magic

1041
01:47:55,020 --> 01:48:01,420
continues at the end of every book they should summon the unbuilt magic kingdom resort they

1042
01:48:01,420 --> 01:48:06,780
should summon the persian resort the venetian oh well that's good for the kingdom keeper series

1043
01:48:06,780 --> 01:48:12,620
yes I think or or I guess the imaginer if he fixes everything in the parks could start to build

1044
01:48:14,140 --> 01:48:19,340
he could start to build port disney out here he could start to build westcott he could start

1045
01:48:19,340 --> 01:48:25,180
slowly demolishing california adventure and sure westcott which is what we all want sure people

1046
01:48:25,180 --> 01:48:33,100
stop him like to have a permit I don't need a permit I do what I want yeah he starts just

1047
01:48:33,100 --> 01:48:39,100
putting more classic characters and prequel characters on rise of the resistance I don't

1048
01:48:39,100 --> 01:48:45,100
need this is what the people want they want to see their friends I don't need a permit I've got one

1049
01:48:45,100 --> 01:48:53,500
man's dream dexter jetstar is now like prominently on rise of the resistance I built 13 dexter

1050
01:48:53,500 --> 01:48:58,940
jetstar animatronics in my home base and now I'm going to install them on rise of the resistance

1051
01:48:58,940 --> 01:49:05,340
we like him fixing things but it's really taking a turn to the jetstar he's everywhere yeah he is

1052
01:49:05,340 --> 01:49:12,940
everywhere but I thought he was just a line cook he is okay now you'll see his other dimensions

1053
01:49:12,940 --> 01:49:18,060
when you go on that ride this is a good character I really like this yeah I like the I like this

1054
01:49:18,060 --> 01:49:22,300
series the two different series that I've come up with or we've come up with I shouldn't take

1055
01:49:22,300 --> 01:49:27,580
credit for them but honestly look oh I'm gonna get rat-fucked out of imaginary residuals they're

1056
01:49:27,580 --> 01:49:33,340
both my ideas okay so it's the imaginer what's the other one can't claim any ownership because

1057
01:49:33,340 --> 01:49:38,380
he's not here but you can't you can claim like five percent ownership uh it's the imaginer and

1058
01:49:38,380 --> 01:49:43,100
you can't I'll say the park liver and the park livers I'm not gonna take any park livers money

1059
01:49:43,100 --> 01:49:47,820
okay because park livers is really just sort of a slice of life park livers doesn't have much

1060
01:49:48,540 --> 01:49:55,020
action in it where do they live specifically all over oh they're all over so you get chosen as a

1061
01:49:55,020 --> 01:50:02,620
like a 12 or 13 year old kid to live at the park you become a park liver okay and are they secret

1062
01:50:02,620 --> 01:50:09,340
or do people know about the park livers they're secret so they're kind of like the little rascals

1063
01:50:09,420 --> 01:50:18,220
but they're also like the lost boys in some ways yes in some ways I guess they just blend in with

1064
01:50:18,220 --> 01:50:24,060
the crowds right but they can they have key they can just sneak in right and then they sort of

1065
01:50:24,060 --> 01:50:29,740
live in the reality of the parks as well so yeah they do you can go party with Snow White and the

1066
01:50:29,740 --> 01:50:35,100
Seven Dwarfs on the ride because that's a real thing that's happening in the reality of the ride

1067
01:50:35,180 --> 01:50:41,180
okay so yeah you could you all you can choose where to live in the park I think or you or you

1068
01:50:41,180 --> 01:50:45,580
can get a sign like maybe it's more of a Harry Potter thing where you get assigned this is very

1069
01:50:45,580 --> 01:50:52,700
do you know about Game Master Anthony Game Master Anthony yeah familiar but I don't it's like um

1070
01:50:52,700 --> 01:51:00,460
a old old internet like mean thing where a guy would every year on a message board post about

1071
01:51:00,460 --> 01:51:07,180
like it's my birthday and all the characters from all the video games and movies coming with cake

1072
01:51:07,180 --> 01:51:13,980
and celebrate and this was posted for years and years no I don't know this is old internet so

1073
01:51:13,980 --> 01:51:19,660
you're saying that's like what this is it's very much becoming Game Master Anthony yeah okay well

1074
01:51:19,660 --> 01:51:26,540
yeah Park Livers is like Game Master Anthony okay so I hear what you're saying um well okay I mean

1075
01:51:26,540 --> 01:51:31,420
those are those are good sort of ideas I've had coming off of this story is there anything else

1076
01:51:31,420 --> 01:51:35,740
about the story that at least the first book you want to talk about um because I have something

1077
01:51:35,740 --> 01:51:43,180
that yeah derailed some of my research but yeah uh anyway what no I think I've covered all of this

1078
01:51:43,180 --> 01:51:49,260
stuff I I liked it and I will keep reading okay well that's good yeah I don't know I don't I may

1079
01:51:49,260 --> 01:51:55,100
never read a book again okay I don't not by choice just because my brain is fried yeah unless somebody

1080
01:51:55,100 --> 01:52:00,540
in the audience has a legitimately good tip for how to combat this hopefully without drugs but if

1081
01:52:00,540 --> 01:52:07,260
there's some sort of I guess adderall or something I mean I would I would say like like uh comical

1082
01:52:07,260 --> 01:52:13,100
crime like Elmer Leonard Carl Heisen I don't think the genre is a problem okay I think my brain is

1083
01:52:13,100 --> 01:52:17,340
the problem oh it's always been the problem romance novels a lot of there's a lot of fun

1084
01:52:17,340 --> 01:52:21,580
like romance novels I don't want it out there well maybe needs to be like hardcore for me to be

1085
01:52:21,580 --> 01:52:29,980
engaged wait uh what uh we're what context are you using that phrase uh hardcore like dirty like

1086
01:52:29,980 --> 01:52:37,180
dirty books like harlequin like there's some dirty harlequin stuff I feel like I want it to be like a

1087
01:52:37,180 --> 01:52:43,900
pirate like a sexy pirate adventure but it's like just x-rated but that exists it's a movie called

1088
01:52:43,900 --> 01:52:51,020
pirates it was very expensive to produce is that true yeah there is a very expensive movie porno

1089
01:52:51,020 --> 01:52:58,220
really called pie yeah yeah because millions this is well known yeah yeah it went it was in broke

1090
01:52:58,220 --> 01:53:03,340
containment now I don't think it's what do you mean broke containment like it it broke out of

1091
01:53:03,340 --> 01:53:10,620
it broke into popular culture I feel like I maybe like 10 years ago have you seen it I've seen clips

1092
01:53:10,620 --> 01:53:15,580
of the dirty pirate movie yeah yeah the important stuff and it's called pirates I think it's called

1093
01:53:15,580 --> 01:53:23,420
pirates x x x I don't I mean I would assume there's a what what's it railed your racer

1094
01:53:23,420 --> 01:53:30,860
like let's get to your thing we don't have time to talk about the porno expensive pirates movie

1095
01:53:30,860 --> 01:53:36,940
I'm just fascinated that there's a supposedly a famous pirate porno movie from 2010 that you've

1096
01:53:36,940 --> 01:53:43,100

01:53:52,460 --> 01:53:58,460
there was like a big famous one that's that's what I didn't know pirates also known as pirates x x x

1100
01:53:58,460 --> 01:54:06,060

1105
01:54:39,420 --> 01:54:46,860
this is okay oh really okay so I'm looking into the author and uh yeah as you said he's written

1108
01:55:00,780 --> 01:55:04,380
don't know which this is from a couple years ago he's talking about writing these books and he's

1109
01:55:04,380 --> 01:55:10,940
written thrillers and he's talking about uh how enthusiastic the fan base is and he's talking

1110
01:55:10,940 --> 01:55:14,940
about how much he enjoys he didn't know this was going to be a big hit blah blah blah talks about

1111
01:55:14,940 --> 01:55:18,940
the fans helping to write one of these books there was an online community at certain points

1112
01:55:18,940 --> 01:55:23,100
talking about all this and great this stuff I'm like jotting it down blah blah blah then he says

1113
01:55:24,060 --> 01:55:30,620
I don't remember what prompted this but he was tasked with creating a rock and roll band

1114
01:55:31,660 --> 01:55:40,220
of authors what a super group of authors including Dave Barry and Stephen King

1115
01:55:40,780 --> 01:55:45,900
wow he put together a band called the rock bottom remainders

1116
01:55:46,460 --> 01:55:56,060
a group of authors that were active from 1992 to 2012 and then a little revival in 2015

1137
01:58:07,180 --> 01:58:13,260
kingdom keepers episode in the tradition of the series having a million installments

1138
01:58:14,780 --> 01:58:20,060
uh so let me read this okay so I don't think Stephen King is is here in this performance he

1139
01:58:20,060 --> 01:58:24,700
was at the Craig Ferguson performance which I won't play today Dave Barry was here Ridley

1140
01:58:24,700 --> 01:58:32,460
Pearson Amy Tan was here uh and also at this performance the birds Roger McGuinn

1141
01:58:34,220 --> 01:58:37,900
who had been performing with the rock bottom remainders as a guest ringer

1142
01:58:38,860 --> 01:58:42,940
in part to help mask the fact that among other things the band hadn't rehearsed very many songs

1143
01:58:45,020 --> 01:58:49,740
and they were all a little jokey I think about this but this is an honor I decided to play this

1144
01:58:49,740 --> 01:58:57,260
little clip here uh in honor of uh Scott Gardner who is not here and I just wanted to make sure

1145
01:58:57,260 --> 01:59:03,900
that he knows we're thinking about him today he's fine and I want him to play yes he's fine but I

1146
01:59:03,900 --> 01:59:12,540
want him to be excited about the rock bottom remainders so here is them uh playing uh Sloop

1147
01:59:12,540 --> 01:59:25,340
Jambi by the Beats boys

1148

1149
01:59:38,860 --> 01:59:41,260
and they sound fine yeah

1150
01:59:44,060 --> 01:59:52,140
it's like sort of a campfire yeah a little trepidatious so this is one of my favorite

1151
01:59:52,140 --> 01:59:57,500
Beach Boys songs by the way well of course it is yeah but anyway this so I just want to make sure

1152
