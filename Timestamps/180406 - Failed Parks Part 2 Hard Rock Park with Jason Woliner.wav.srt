00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hmm... Welcome back, my friends, to the podcast that never ends.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:15,000
When you last left this band of weary travelers, we were lost adrift in a wilderness of pain, once known as Myrtle Beach's Hard Rock Park.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:25,000
With the world of Sid and Marty Kraft long in our wake, we venture forth into a barren land, littered with discarded, guitar-shaped shovels,

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:33,000
tattered white satin sheets, and rusted over high-fidelity speakers once used in Led Zeppelin the Ride.

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Join us, brazen boys and girls, as we re-enter this hallowed park of rock.

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Help us light the funeral pyre, so it may rise again.

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:57,000
We still aren't done with sculptures and everything, because while it's here, we can start talking about whatever the London...

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Were you gonna talk about Mount Rockmore?

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Yeah, Mount Rockmore was in the open.

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
We aren't even close to Mount Rockmore.

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Wait, is that the Stonehenge one?

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
No, that's Mount Rushmore.

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
This was during the groundbreaking they built...

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Okay, let's talk about the groundbreaking.

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Okay, so they had a big publicity stunt where they broke ground and it was called...

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:26,000
And basically, they built a Mount Rushmore called Mount Rockmore that was made out of Myrtle Beach sand.

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:34,000
And it was faces of famous rockers, Elvis Presley, Jimi Hendrix, John Lennon, and Bob Marley.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
But Bob Marley looks more like Albert Einstein.

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And they broke the literal ground with guitars that had been modified to be shovels.

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
So they put shovel heads on the end and the three guys...

21
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I guess it was John Goodwin and...

22
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Probably Monday.

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Probably Monday.

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
And they're just like, wait, what did they sing that song?

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
They're like, well, it's one for the money, dig.

26
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Two for the show.

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:11,000
And then everyone applauds and then they blow confetti at everyone.

28
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
And then Billy Joel's daughter, Alexa Ray Joel, performs.

29
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
And then do they smash the guitars?

30
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Do they smash guitars?

31
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
No.

32
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Do they smash them?

33
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I don't see that part.

34
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I feel like I saw footage of smashing guitars.

35
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
There's never a bad first time to find out Billy Joel's daughter sings.

36
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Why not have the debut of a rock park, have a rock star's daughter?

37
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Also, they finally break ground on the place and there is a lot of hype.

38
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
This story is picked up by a lot of news stations and what have you.

39
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:52,000
And there were some jokes done in a topical monologue by America's host Jay Leno.

40
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
If you'd like to hear his take on the subject.

41
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It's true that they're opening the world's first rock and roll theme park.

42
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
And they're already announced an awesome ride coming out.

43
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,000
A lot of demand for this is going to be the Rolling Stones Rascal Scooter Grand Prix.

44
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Also, it should be noted when Jay delivered that joke, he fucked it up.

45
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
He got tongue tied.

46
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
He did not stick the landing on that.

47
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Look, when you do late night jokes, you do a lot every day.

48
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
You do it for days.

49
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
You get mealy mouthed.

50
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Sometimes you get mealy mouthed.

51
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Sometimes you eat shit.

52
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
And he ate shit on that delivery much like the park.

53
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
But he was given a second chance, also like the park.

54
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Because he wanted to point out the least popular ride, the George Michael haunted men's room.

55
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Haunted?

56
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Again, another thing from another...

57
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
That joke feels...

58
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Not George Michael's men's room, but if George Michael has a men's room where he has ghosts of gay men looking for hookups.

59
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Wasn't that a topical news story in 2008?

60
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Wasn't he arrested in a men's room?

61
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Not for ghosts, I'll tell you that.

62
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I don't know where Jay got this ghost element.

63
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Oh, the ghost. Now I see your objection to it.

64
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It's more about that.

65
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Why was it not George Michael's men's room?

66
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Where does haunted come in?

67
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I guess it ties it to the haunted mansion.

68
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
But why are there ghosts?

69
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
There was a big debate in the writer's room that day of like,

70
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Shouldn't it be haunted restroom?

71
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
No, Jay, that doesn't really make any sense.

72
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'd like it to be haunted.

73
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
We can't analyze these things so much.

74
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
You do it.

75
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Some of these shows, nobody's going to be talking about this in ten years.

76
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I know you do.

77
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
They're going to move on.

78
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
He was wrong.

79
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Here we are.

80
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
In terms of, in addition to the media coverage,

81
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
like many brand new theme parks,

82
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
there was a preview center with a lot of the memorabilia

83
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
that would end up within the park.

84
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
The preview center apparently cost a million dollars.

85
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Where was the preview center?

86
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I think it was on the property.

87
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Who was going to, like at Disney,

88
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I get the preview center because you're in the park

89
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
and you go into a building and it shows you what's coming into the park.

90
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
This park wasn't built.

91
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Who headed to the site of a park that wasn't built

92
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
to look at the preview center?

93
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Also, I don't think they promoted the preview center well either.

94
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
And also the preview center, as they often are, was free.

95
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
So they spent all this money on this free thing

96
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
and I don't think they didn't sell a lot of the annual passes

97
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
at the preview center either.

98
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
They did this for Disneyland Paris, though, too.

99
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Disneyland Paris was not open and they opened a preview center

100
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
in the weird pastoral, you know, outside of Paris

101
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
where that park exists.

102
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
And it was not really near the rest of Disneyland Paris.

103
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
And then it got overtaken by like wayward hobo French youths.

104
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Like it's just full of graffiti and like 20 people were living

105
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
in the preview center for a while.

106
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
It was like a crack den.

107
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
That's a real bummer.

108
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Yeah, so, which I wonder, you've got to wonder,

109
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
did Hard Rock Park maybe be a good place to spend the night?

110
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I don't think a lot of people are poking around there.

111
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
You mean not a lot of police?

112
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

113
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
That did make me upset watching an abandoned,

114
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
there's a number of abandoned place explorers.

115
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
So many of them.

116
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
There's a lot.

117
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
And just thinking about like how many homeless people

118
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
there are in America.

119
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
And I'm sure in just in Myrtle Beach alone,

120
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
this huge empty plot of land.

121
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
That's what I'm saying.

122
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
You take the plot of land and you take that 400 million

123
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
and just give everyone free healthcare.

124
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I think you're going to say how many homeless people

125
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
are just like riding these roller coasters 24 seven

126
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
and just living in Knights of White Satin.

127
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
And like it's just this whole society of the remnants.

128
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I got a good deal up in, yeah,

129
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I'm staying up in Eagles life in the fast lane.

130
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Oh, congrats, man.

131
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I wish I could, wish I could, was willing to climb that high.

132
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Yeah, I'm in the kitchen of the red, red wine bar.

133
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
How are there not people living there?

134
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
There must be.

135
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I don't, I would think maybe somewhere.

136
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
The urban explorers that I watched did not come across.

137
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
All these, I'll do a quick side note.

138
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
All the people that go and tour these abandoned parks

139
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
are acting like they found Atlantis.

140
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
They all have this, whoa, I can't believe it.

141
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Here we are and they all have a backpack

142
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
and they all annoy me.

143
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
And like there's one guy, did you watch this one guy?

144
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
He was like, most of the doors have been locked up,

145
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
but most of the windows have been broken up

146
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
so it should be pretty easy to get into all these places.

147
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
And he's like so dramatic about it and it's like, shut up.

148
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
These are always like the most annoying guys.

149
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Did you say on another episode you're like just watching

150
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
and turn the sound off?

151
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Like they're always like wall to wall.

152
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Yes, I said that.

153
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Yeah, like it's always wall to wall annoying music

154
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
and just like the most obnoxious guys.

155
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Yeah, I mean it makes sense.

156
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
So like that's the guy who's like,

157
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I'm gonna go to an abandoned theme park.

158
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
This guy, also the guy I'm talking about,

159
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
he goes, it's absolutely torn apart.

160
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Look at this water.

161
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Can you imagine if you fell in that?

162
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
You'd be wet.

163
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Is it?

164
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
No.

165
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
It's like, it's a water, dirty water.

166
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
One of them I actually, that I saw,

167
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I actually found very endearing

168
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
because it was just like a very polite southern man

169
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
and he was like, yeah, I was one of the first

170
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
and one of the few annual pass holders

171
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
and I really enjoyed it.

172
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I miss this park a lot.

173
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Oh no.

174
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
He went in and did the exploring

175
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
and was able to then cut two shots

176
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
of what he was looking at now

177
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
with the footage he took in the park when it was,

178
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
and he was, and then he was like.

179
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Depressing.

180
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
All right, I gotta get out of here

181
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
and then after it's showing him going out of the park

182
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
and then it cuts to like,

183
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
at the top of the video he had the map of the park

184
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
in his home and then at the end of the video

185
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
he slaps the map again.

186
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
He's like, dammit, I forgot about this whole section.

187
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I forgot about, if I get to go back,

188
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
if I can go back, I got a whole section

189
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
because that's what I was like,

190
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
oh, I didn't even see the Knights of White Satin ride

191
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
or as it was eventually called at the Freestyle Music Park,

192
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
the Monstars of Rock.

193
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Monstars of Rock, yeah.

194
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Oscar ride.

195
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
What's that look like?

196
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Well, we're gonna miss areas like this man.

197
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
We're gonna miss.

198
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
We need a game plan.

199
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
We gotta keep rolling.

200
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
The park featured six rock environs

201
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
celebrating rock's culture, lifestyle, legends,

202
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
and irreverence, included All Access Entry Plaza,

203
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Rock and Roll Heaven, British Invasion,

204
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Lost in the 70s, Born in the USA, and Cool Country.

205
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Yeah.

206
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Born in the USA, famously said so.

207
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Yeah, that land explored what veterans were going through

208
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
after the Vietnam War.

209
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Veterans who couldn't get jobs at the closed refineries.

210
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
You would go on a ride where Americans would turn

211
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
their back on you after you gave your life to the service.

212
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
The Deer Hunter Experience.

213
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Oh, no, it's not a, it's a music park, not a movie park.

214
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Yeah, yeah.

215
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I, you know, we missed something.

216
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Was it Swinging London?

217
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
What is it?

218
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Oh, yes.

219
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Oh, yes.

220
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
We just, just to cover our sculpture bases,

221
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
we missed Phonehenge.

222
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Oh, Phonehenge.

223
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Oh, that's in British Invasion.

224
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
In British Invasion, there is a Stonehenge

225
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
that is made entirely out of red British phone booths.

226
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Stacked up.

227
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
So, just file that away.

228
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Can we talk about the Roadie's Thud show?

229
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Yeah, yeah.

230
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Let's do it.

231
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Yeah, also, let's not forget the Eagles' coaster

232
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
and the Cars' coaster, but the Roadie's Thud show,

233
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
since you brought it up, please.

234
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Take the lead.

235
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Send me this clip.

236
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
We've all watched the whole show?

237
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Yeah.

238
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
We have.

239
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
There's so many things about this.

240
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Like, just again, just watch this.

241
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
It's on YouTube.

242
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
There's someone that recorded the whole thing in three parts,

243
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
and there's this whole, like, sub-story going on

244
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
because it's obviously this, like, horny dad recording it

245
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
because for the last half, he's just filming the one woman

246
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
in the show.

247
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
The one woman who's named AJ.

248
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Your name's AJ.

249
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
But, and it's like, and you miss most of the show

250
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
because he just gets fixated on this one performer.

251
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Yeah, like pyrotechnics, big stunts happen,

252
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
and he's just, like, he's just focused on her midriff.

253
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
It's so gross.

254
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
He's looking at sweet drift.

255
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
And again, like the, like the stunt show episode

256
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
in this stunt show, in this park at large,

257
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
women don't exactly fare well.

258
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Not the most nuanced portrayal of women.

259
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
What the one has to, picture I saw of the woman's uniform.

260
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
It's crazy.

261
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
It's crazy to think this is 1992.

262
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
It's like the Tilted Kilt or something.

263
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Like, that's the uniform.

264
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Yeah, really demeaning.

265
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Maybe there was, like, T-shirts you could buy

266
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,000
of, like, the Runaways or the Mamas and the Papas

267
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
or Janis Joplin or any number of the important women

268
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
in the history of rock and roll,

269
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
but they are not really present otherwise.

270
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Yeah, in this whole park, it seems.

271
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Yeah.

272
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
AJ's representing for all women.

273
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
It's all on you, AJ.

274
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:46,000
So the show begins with, they announce the Bare Metal family.

275
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Oh, this is all I love.

276
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
This is what I love.

277
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
This is my favorite thing.

278
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Now, I wound up transcribing their whole song,

279
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
and I don't have to read it, but I was just like,

280
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I need to write it.

281
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
No, no, you have to read it.

282
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Oh, can I set the stage, which is that by literally, like,

283
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
you are looking at a stage with a bunch of equipment

284
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
and speakers, like a concert's about to begin,

285
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
and then a band is announced, the Bare Metal family,

286
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
and they walk out in front of the stage.

287
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
In front of the stage.

288
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Not on the stage, which at no point in the Roadie Stunt Show

289
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
is used by a band.

290
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
That's true.

291
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
They, the Bare Metal family, it's like four people

292
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
in bear costumes.

293
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
The announcer goes, heavy metal heads and rockers of all ages

294
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
give it up for the Bare Metal family.

295
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
And the costumes, they're big stuffed bears.

296
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
They kind of look like Kiss.

297
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Yes, they have kind of Kiss makeup on,

298
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
but also colored hair.

299
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
The girl has pink hair.

300
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I don't want to read the whole song, but it begins,

301
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
maybe I'll just read the whole song.

302
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Yeah, read the whole song.

303
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Look out, Yogi, step back, Smokey.

304
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Country bears are too hokey pokey.

305
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Goldilocks wants a band that rocks.

306
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Yes, of country bears.

307
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Yeah, they're just firing shots.

308
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Then the chorus is like, Bare Metal family.

309
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
And then the first bear's yummy, but he ain't no gummy.

310
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Daddy Bear likes it in your case, I think.

311
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Yeah, I couldn't understand what that was either.

312
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Did you write this too?

313
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I wrote a lot of it down, yeah.

314
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
But the grizzly easily shreds his face.

315
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
He's crazy mad, he's heavy dad.

316
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
That's the name of the dad.

317
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
And he does a guitar solo.

318
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
These rocking bears still attack people,

319
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
like the most rabid bears.

320
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Well, they are animals.

321
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
There's no singer in this band.

322
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Yes, they never say anybody.

323
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
This is a band that is sung about,

324
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
and they play instruments,

325
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
but sung about by a disembodied voice.

326
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
And when the one does a drum solo, is playing no drums.

327
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
No drums.

328
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
This mother rules with an iron paw,

329
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
slices keys into metal slaw,

330
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
she's a matriarch, plays her metal dark,

331
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
makes a moan, come on, show us your stuff.

332
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I have come on ma, show us your stuff.

333
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Oh, that's it, okay.

334
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Like a Bear and Steam Bear.

335
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Ma!

336
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Keyboard solo.

337
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
She's a preteen bear, takes her metal with hair,

338
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
makes a guitar sing like a wild thing,

339
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
damn girl, you can jam girl.

340
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Here is glam girl.

341
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
She wails.

342
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
While he's singing that,

343
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
the brother is waving his drumsticks in the air,

344
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,000
and then playfully kicking her in the bind.

345
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Yet more respect of women.

346
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Next on his feet to lay down the beat,

347
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
he's the cub of the club, he's a drum and machine,

348
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
he's, did you know what this was?

349
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
No.

350
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Something last, and he plays it mean,

351
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
he's what we need boy, we call him Speed Boy.

352
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Speed Boy, yeah.

353
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Let me hear, I might just,

354
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I'll cut this out and replace it if it sounds bad.

355
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
The audience needs to hear some of this.

356
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I don't know the tone though.

357
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
With a bear, metal, bat away!

358
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Get there, get there, get there!

359
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Metal, bat away!

360
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,000
A bear, metal, bat away!

361
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Yeah!

362
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Look out, you get, step back smoking,

363
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
country bears, not too hokey pokey,

364
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:18,000
golden locks, what's a half dead locks?

365
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Bear, metal, bat away!

366
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
There's a couple different versions of this show too,

367
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
because there's a show where the Bear Metal family

368
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
is doing their own show.

369
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Indoors.

370
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
It's independent of the Roadies show.

371
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
So I don't know what happened,

372
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
maybe they decided to combine two great shows into one,

373
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
that's my guess.

374
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Supergroup.

375
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Yeah, in the one show where they're alone

376
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
and they're not part of the Roadies stunt show,

377
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
when the dad is introduced,

378
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,000
he licks his paw in the dirtiest manner

379
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
and smacks his own butt.

380
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
And it's just, it's filthy.

381
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I don't know, it's so weird.

382
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
And then after he's done playing his bass solo,

383
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
he again licks his paw in the most dirty way I've ever seen.

384
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Not how a bear would lick his paw at all,

385
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
but perhaps a woman at a strip club would do it

386
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
if she thought that's what...

387
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:16,000
It's not exactly like the Hard Rock cafe or hotel kind of humor.

388
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Wait, wait, hold on.

389
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
What is the Hard Rock hotel cafe kind of humor?

390
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I feel like at least at the one in Orlando,

391
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,000
it's always like the door hanger would say,

392
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
was that a concert? I'm sleeping in.

393
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:37,000
If you want it, it was pretty focus group tested.

394
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
And sex is not a primary component.

395
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
It wouldn't be like, this type of humor on that same card,

396
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
it would have a picture of a bear and it would say,

397
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
getting some honey or something.

398
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
It would be like that.

399
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
So you're saying it doesn't go together.

400
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I agree. I agree with what you're saying.

401
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Did you notice that the audience is genuinely going nuts

402
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
for these bears?

403
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,000
They're really reacting like it's their favorite band.

404
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
The audience does like them.

405
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,000
There's a part two in that one video where the dad bear is dirty,

406
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
where whoever's taking the video just goes,

407
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
woo, like hell yeah. Lick that paw, babe.

408
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
There's a couple hell yeahs.

409
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I have a question about the continuity of this universe.

410
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Are the roadies for the bear band?

411
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
No.

412
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
It's for an unidentified rock star.

413
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
The band is identified, I think it's called Roaring Savage.

414
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Correct.

415
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Didn't Algorithm write the show?

416
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Well, actually, I don't know how in depth you want to go into the stunt show.

417
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
May as well.

418
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Which may be the worst stunt show in any theme park,

419
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
from what I can tell.

420
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
It's extremely confusing.

421
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
It's about a bunch of roadies who all clearly have hepatitis

422
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
who are made from a custodian named Nigel, right?

423
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Like that's the log line?

424
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
That wasn't conveyed to me that he's not a roadie.

425
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I didn't get that.

426
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Oh, no, he comes out with a broom.

427
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
He's got a broom and he's in a Hard Rock the Man cast member.

428
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Hard Rock the Man.

429
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
It begins with one of these things where you don't know that the show's begun.

430
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Like this custodian comes out and he's got a broom

431
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
and he kind of looks around at the equipment and he's like,

432
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
hey, maybe I'll try this out.

433
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
And then a roadie with either a British or an Australian accent

434
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
gets really mad and kicks him off.

435
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
He's like, it's for road crew only.

436
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
And the audience, did you notice this?

437
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
They're screaming at him like, get out of here.

438
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Get out of here, Nigel.

439
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Fuck you.

440
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
And like they hate this guy, Nigel.

441
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
And then he sneaks back onto the stage, does a back flip.

442
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
He like never speaks, I don't think either.

443
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
And then he gets them on his side and they're like, you go, Nigel.

444
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
He grabs a guitar.

445
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
He jams.

446
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
He rocks so hard that the guitar goes limp like a penis.

447
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Yeah, yeah.

448
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Oh, I miss that part.

449
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Yeah, yeah.

450
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
That's in part one.

451
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
He's caught again.

452
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
He's thrown off stage.

453
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
And then the show officially starts and they introduce these stunt roadies.

454
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I only, I didn't catch all the names.

455
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I'm sure you guys did.

456
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
There was a guy named Bulldog.

457
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
There was Pyro Jake.

458
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
And what were, and you?

459
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
C-Man.

460
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Yeah.

461
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Yeah.

462
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
No, no.

463
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
And that's all I have, if there's more.

464
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I don't know if AJ is the name of the...

465
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Yeah, I don't have them written down actually.

466
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
And they, he keeps, Nigel returns.

467
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
He keeps causing trouble.

468
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
He starts blasting t-shirts at the crowd out of a cannon.

469
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
The rafter, he makes all the rafters fall like dominoes.

470
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
He freaks out.

471
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Okay, so then this is how we know the band is called Roaring Savage, because there's

472
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:44,000
a big backing and it says something like, Roaring Savage, the music never dies.

473
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
And he like rips it.

474
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
He rips it.

475
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Very clearly pre-ripped.

476
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Very clearly pre-ripped.

477
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Right down the middle.

478
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Right down the middle.

479
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
And they put it right back up after.

480
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:58,000
They put it together and then it spells out with the remaining letters, roadies suck,

481
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
which is so offensive to a roadie.

482
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Nothing can make you...

483
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,000
He amended the pre-existing sign to say something about us?

484
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
It's a live Mad Magazine fold-in.

485
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
It is that, I wrote that.

486
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Yeah, I wrote that.

487
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I wrote exactly that.

488
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I do appreciate that like we are giving some attention to the often forgot prequel to the

489
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Luke Wilson, Cameron Crowe roadies TV show.

490
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I'm assuming this is the inspiration or like the Rogue One to roadies.

491
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
This was a stunt prequel.

492
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Yeah, that inciting incident of the banner rip is what made them the roadies they are

493
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
today.

494
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Oh, one of the roadies has a remote that can control everything, sort of a McGuffin.

495
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
It took me a while to figure out what that was.

496
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
That's what AJ is her name?

497
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I guess so.

498
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I think AJ who is like in a jumpsuit that she like sexily strips out of and does a sexy

499
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
dance to get out of at the very beginning, but she eventually gets the remote.

500
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Oh, and the universal remote is called the Unicom, is that right?

501
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I think that's right.

502
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I think that's right.

503
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I think that's right.

504
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I think that's right.

505
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
It controls all the show action equipment, I believe is what they say.

506
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,000
They chase him around a lot and do a lot of like jumping up and down on these big speakers.

507
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
And then he winds up in a porta potty at some point.

508
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:22,000
He like goes and hides it and she uses the remote to lift it up and then drop it into

509
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
like a big wardrobe crate.

510
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
And it explodes.

511
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
It explodes.

512
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
They kill him.

513
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
They kill Nigel essentially.

514
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
You think.

515
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
You think.

516
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
You think he's dead.

517
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:38,000
And then he comes out dressed in this like crazy sequined costume and apparently smelling

518
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:44,000
like shit because AJ keeps like waving her hand in front of her face.

519
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Yeah.

520
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
But he gets revenge somehow.

521
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
He's on like a, what do you call it?

522
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
A zip, not a zip line, but like he's got a cable.

523
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Oh, a tightrope.

524
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Yes, he's on a wire.

525
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Yeah.

526
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Also, it's.

527
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
She makes him float above the crowd.

528
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Yeah, he starts flying through the air.

529
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
But then she gets covered in water and feathered.

530
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:11,400
Yeah, somehow he triggers like a water bucket falls on her, which she then sexily starts

531
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,880
doing like a sexy thing to.

532
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:18,000
But then immediately gets shot with a feather cannon, which is never explained.

533
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I think she's covered in wet confetti.

534
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Because the guy who's filming this at this point is just zoomed in on her like midsection.

535
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,500
There's no way to tell what's going on.

536
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:32,740
You would think it becomes her story arc.

537
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:37,560
You would think she and I think she is probably the most committed one from what I could tell.

538
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,560
Although Big Dog.

539
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,560
No, what was the guy?

540
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:43,040
We started ignoring C-Man midway through the show.

541
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,320
Bulldog scenes pretty.

542
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,440
He was barking a lot.

543
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,440
He was barking a lot.

544
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,800
There was a guy, I think it was Bulldog.

545
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,800
There's okay.

546
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:52,200
So there's this log sequence.

547
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,200
Tell me.

548
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,200
Okay.

549
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,320
In the YouTube video, they're bouncing.

550
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,240
There's this giant wall of speakers.

551
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:00,640
They're surrounded by trampolines and they're doing this chase where like one wolf, they're

552
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,320
basically juggling themselves.

553
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,320
Like one goes up as another goes down.

554
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,320
One goes up, another goes down.

555
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:08,320
On the concert stage where they've set up a lot of trampolines.

556
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:12,580
And one of the guys, I think it might have been Bulldog, seems to me in this clip like

557
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:14,320
he really hurts himself.

558
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,600
It's eight minutes in.

559
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:23,680
So I think part two, he falls on the trampoline and then crawls over and just lies crouching

560
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:27,320
for like a minute and then crawls back off stage.

561
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:30,200
And I think he really landed wrong.

562
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,520
If it's part of the narrative, it certainly isn't spelled out.

563
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:37,320
And it's the most realistic thing in all of the roadies stunt show.

564
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:40,920
Anyway, it was replaced by CSI Live.

565
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,800
Yeah, that's the epilogue.

566
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,240
Wait, in Freestyle Music Park?

567
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:50,320
Freestyle Music Park, CSI Live, which was also at some other parks, took over this space.

568
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:55,320
Which it's also, that's another crazy, like, yeah, talking about TV that like is huge and

569
00:23:55,320 --> 00:24:02,240
then you forget about, remember how the biggest show in America for years was about crime

570
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:08,280
scene investigators trying to piece together the events of crimes, that gruesome crime

571
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,280
scenes?

572
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,960
Like small bone fragments.

573
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:16,400
And there was a CSI, still is, I believe, a CSI experience at the MGM Grand.

574
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,400
Oh yeah.

575
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,400
Oh, that sounds right.

576
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,400
Yeah.

577
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:22,760
The CSI show moved also.

578
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:27,360
It moved from that park once the second park closed to like a six-fold legs, right?

579
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,880
To one of the six flags, I think.

580
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,080
It survived the closure of Freestyle Music Park.

581
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,080
I will say, yeah, sorry.

582
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:38,880
I was just going to say, there's another show that I think is a much better stunt show at

583
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,880
this park.

584
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,880
Did you guys see this?

585
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,880
Is this the Malibu one?

586
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:47,120
This is the, I don't want to go right into another stunt spectacular, but I think we

587
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,120
have to.

588
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:53,880
I just saw a clip of this where someone hits their dick and balls on a dive.

589
00:24:53,880 --> 00:25:00,400
This is a Malibu beach party show that featured some of your, yeah, it had motorcycles, it

590
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,140
had stunts off diving boards.

591
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:05,120
This is a much better show than the roadie stunt show.

592
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,120
That's how much there is.

593
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,200
We didn't have, we've missed entire stuntaculars.

594
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,200
Yes.

595
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,120
And like, I'll quickly go through this cause it's a 20 minute show.

596
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,480
I'm not going to tell you about all of it.

597
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,320
You know, it's, it's, first of all, they do a trick, which is a trick they do on another

598
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,320
ride.

599
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:23,560
They play about 10 seconds worth of the music so they don't have to pay royalty fees.

600
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,560
So the music is coming in fast here.

601
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:29,720
You're going from Barbara Ann to Barbie girl and there's a whole, that's going to come

602
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,160
back around by the way.

603
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,160
Keep going.

604
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,160
Oh yeah.

605
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,160
Yeah.

606
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,620
So I'm just going to go through a couple quick things.

607
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:38,680
So like there's a whole, you know, narrative with, I think Barbara Ann is a star.

608
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,680
Am I correct Jason?

609
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,680
Or did you watch this?

610
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,680
I didn't watch it.

611
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:44,600
I had like a clip in one of the abandoned things.

612
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:48,720
The character Barbara Ann never seen in any previous media.

613
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:55,200
Well you see, you meet a few different characters from popular songs like Gloria, G-L-O-R-I.

614
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,560
You meet a lot of folks from your favorite song.

615
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,200
You meet every rock heroine.

616
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,200
Not everyone.

617
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,200
Yes.

618
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,060
So, I mean, there's, you know, I'm, I'm again, I'm going to breeze through this cause we

619
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:06,320
are running long.

620
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:11,640
So there's a section where, you know, everyone's trying to court Barbara Ann and then all of

621
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:17,120
these other sexy girls come out of like, you know, your 1950s or 60s like changing areas

622
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,280
on a beach.

623
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:21,020
And then that's where they introduce Gloria and a different girl.

624
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:23,040
And then they go and meet Lola.

625
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:28,960
And of course we know Lola from the King song and Lola's clearly a man dressed as a woman,

626
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,960
which of course is very problematic.

627
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,440
Looks like a woman but talks like a man.

628
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,440
Of course.

629
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:37,920
And then like, honestly, I thought it was going to be whatever Lola wants Lola gets.

630
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:42,360
Well that would have been a little bit of variety in terms of the music in this park.

631
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,360
And we know that.

632
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,360
It's hard rock.

633
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,360
It's hard.

634
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,360
Like Barbara Ann.

635
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,360
Yeah.

636
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:50,400
Or the hardest rock song, Lola.

637
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:56,520
But Lola is revealed to be a real mischief maker named Icky Micky.

638
00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:00,760
Icky Micky, a real troublemaker around these parts.

639
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:01,760
And then at a certain point.

640
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,440
Is that a nod to Micky Dolan?

641
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,000
It might be.

642
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:10,720
At a certain point, Chuck Berry song about like pedophilia.

643
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,840
Icky Micky was a real 12 year old Chuck Berry was into.

644
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:19,500
Oh, that's probably true.

645
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:24,000
And then there's like, there's a sea monster that shows up that Barbara Ann kisses, which

646
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,480
looks a lot like a Sid and Marty Croft character.

647
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,880
Sigmund and the sea monster.

648
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,160
Or Sigmund and the sea monster, excuse me.

649
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:34,440
There's a whole thing where there's motorcycles just flying around.

650
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,820
I don't know why they're there.

651
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:40,760
They're like stunt bikes that don't like, they're not fifties appropriate motorcycles.

652
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:44,440
There's a section where the men are trying to impress the women and they all have giant

653
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:48,920
hot dogs because this park is obsessed with dicks.

654
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,880
It's just dicks everywhere.

655
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:58,640
And then they dive into the water that's on fire to like roast their weenies, I guess,

656
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,640
is the joke.

657
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:03,320
So again, let's not give them too much credit.

658
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,680
It's possible they weren't thinking about that.

659
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:09,840
So Malibu Beach Party Show, we'll post a link to that.

660
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,720
That is the Cliff Notes version of it.

661
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:15,440
You're going to have more, the listeners will have more homework to do, the amount of homework

662
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,360
that is longer than the episode itself.

663
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:22,860
Oh, and Leroy Brown is in the show and he's a lifeguard.

664
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:26,200
Does he spit into the wind in the, like a fan?

665
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:29,640
No, but they call him Captain Steroids because he's strong.

666
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:34,080
One of the girls goes, okay, Captain Steroids, because he's like a strong guy.

667
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:39,960
Does the events of the Malibu Beach Party make the character Jeremy so sad that he kills

668
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:40,960
himself?

669
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:45,400
He's a child at a desk just watching all the events play out.

670
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,520
Why didn't they ask me?

671
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,960
I missed that party.

672
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:54,520
Okay, so an entire other area we haven't, what have we?

673
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:59,520
We forgot John's 50th birthday at the other stunt show.

674
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:05,520
So John Binkowski, back to the protagonist of the tale.

675
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:09,240
So we're, yeah, I'm going through YouTube and you're looking for clips of the bare metal

676
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:14,240
family and it says bare metal family slash John's birthday surprise.

677
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:18,800
Yeah, because unlike the cinemard at Croft Park where it seems like photography was not

678
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:24,980
allowed, photography was definitely allowed at this park and all I gotta say is just more.

679
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:27,080
Just I want to shoot it into my veins.

680
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:33,720
I can't get all the video, all the photos, listeners, if you have any, like get it to

681
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,720
us.

682
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:38,360
However, like I want to, this will be the first one where I'm not drained by the episode.

683
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:41,360
I'm going to keep going with Hard Rock Park.

684
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,520
I mean, I'm definitely going to eBay after that.

685
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,400
I haven't done any merch hunting.

686
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:50,400
Well, you know, so much of the merch legally had to be destroyed.

687
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,400
What?

688
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:54,160
Oh right, as part of the bankruptcy.

689
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:57,440
We'll get to that in a few minutes.

690
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:02,120
Oh yeah, so it's John's birthday and I watched this clip.

691
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:06,040
I didn't know who John, I wasn't as, it was one of the first clips I watched.

692
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,720
So I was like, who is it?

693
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:12,080
And no one in the audience knows who John Benkowski is, I think.

694
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,080
I would assume that.

695
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:18,440
So yeah, so they have the bare metal family come out and do their normal show and then

696
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:24,440
they announce that it's John's birthday, which is a break from the format of the show and

697
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:32,120
like two like sexy girls in like stewardess outfits, like pink dress, short dresses come

698
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:36,360
up into the stands and take John down to here.

699
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,940
I'll show you guys.

700
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:45,260
They take John down and then they announced that they have a present for John and this

701
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:48,760
will load.

702
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:51,640
It's a Beatles anthology box.

703
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:54,320
They lower a wheelchair from the rafters.

704
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:59,800
Cause it's John's 50th birthday wheelchair and he gets in the wheelchair.

705
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:00,800
Yeah.

706
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:05,960
It does seem like in like weird taste, pretty poor taste.

707
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:13,160
Like maybe a diaper or a walker even, but like a wheelchair, they're probably like disabled

708
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:18,840
people in the audience there making a joke of a wheelchair.

709
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,840
Like, ah, he's got to sit in a wheelchair.

710
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:24,600
People who are the most shit out of luck at a theme park are now further mocked by the

711
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,800
founder of the park.

712
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:30,440
The Walt Disney of Hard Rock Park.

713
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,840
I have a theory about this.

714
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:35,860
This is all presented as if it's a surprise.

715
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:39,720
I'm guessing not a surprise, perhaps John's own idea.

716
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:45,560
Well, it feels in the comedic voice of the rest of John Burkowski's material.

717
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,920
So that's a guess.

718
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:50,860
If anyone has any other information about John's 50th birthday, let us know.

719
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:53,120
This was a jam packed 150 days.

720
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:57,720
They had time for multiple shows, a birthday celebration, change outs of the location of

721
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,120
the bare metal family.

722
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:03,220
It's a good thing his birthday fell within those six months of the park being open.

723
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:06,680
If it had been during the chapter 11 period, what a bummer that would have been.

724
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:10,160
Yes, someone would have had to just give him a wheelchair instead of lower it from the

725
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,880
sky.

726
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,680
He would have lived in it on the street.

727
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:20,240
We know what did happen during the chapter 11 was the show, another show, we haven't

728
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:24,760
gotten into, Country on the Rocks got an award for being the best new theme park show of

729
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,560
the year anywhere in the country.

730
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:31,080
And this award was presented as Hard Rock Park was fighting chapter 11.

731
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,080
Wow.

732
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:36,800
We didn't even discuss Winston the punk rock bulldog.

733
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:39,800
That's what I have my cursor on right now to say.

734
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,800
Their other mascot.

735
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:45,320
Yeah, so I looked up, because the first thing I looked up said, okay, the famous characters

736
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:49,960
from this park was bare metal family and Winston the punk rock dog.

737
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:53,720
And I looked up bare metal family, you find a lot of stuff about it, but I cannot find

738
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:58,080
a thing about Winston the punk rock dog except for a photo of him.

739
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,760
What does Winston refer to?

740
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,920
Is it a reference to anyone in rock?

741
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:02,920
Winston Churchill.

742
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:03,920
He's British.

743
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:06,520
He's a rock and roll leader.

744
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:11,200
He's got like a mohawk and he's like a real Johnny Rotten type, I guess.

745
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,080
But he's a tough, tough bulldog.

746
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:19,280
His lower fangs lend themselves perfectly to the punk rock attitude.

747
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:23,460
The punk movement, though many genres are not represented in the park, punk is represented

748
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:30,800
by Winston the punk rock dog and also by the punk pit, which is a bounce house that is

749
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,640
themed around mashing.

750
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:36,280
And there's a bunch of like towers with inflatable spikes.

751
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:39,400
So what did I say?

752
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,400
Mashing.

753
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,400
Mashing.

754
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,280
Hey man, you're a narc.

755
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,680
No narcs in this park.

756
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:47,160
You finally caught me too uncool for a hard ride.

757
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,960
Well, Jason knows all the cool slang and I don't.

758
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:50,960
As always.

759
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:51,960
Yes, that's right.

760
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,920
I forgot about the adult and kid friendly bounce house.

761
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:55,920
I...

762
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:59,720
Oh, we haven't even talked about the cow pie life-size checkerboard.

763
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:10,280
Oh yeah, checkers made out of giant cow shits in cool country is where that existed.

764
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:15,880
By the theater, by the ice skating theater, which I believe was converted to a country

765
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,280
music themed ice show.

766
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:21,680
Oh yeah, the original ice theater that the park was built around was utilized to perform

767
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:24,720
Country on the Rocks.

768
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:28,320
But it's still an ice show, an ice country show.

769
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:35,040
Yeah, there's a... we have not touched upon the free air guitars rack.

770
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:39,560
It's an invisible rack that you can get a free air guitar for shaky humor.

771
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,400
I think that's actually a solid gag.

772
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,720
Yeah, that's not bad.

773
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:47,920
A little more in line with what you were mentioning as the hard rock cafe mode of humor.

774
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:48,920
Yeah, harmless.

775
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:52,560
Yeah, a little good clean fun.

776
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,720
Speaking of good gags, we forgot about the bathroom mirror.

777
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:56,720
Oh.

778
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:57,720
Oh yeah.

779
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,720
Yeah, this is so convoluted.

780
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:03,680
So the bathroom mirror would... it was like a video and it would be on like a 10 second

781
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:04,680
delay.

782
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:05,680
Is that right?

783
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,920
10 second, like about... so you'd walk up to the mirror and there was no one there and

784
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:13,320
it would be confusing and then you would watch yourself walk up to the sink.

785
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,320
It's pretty good.

786
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,320
It is a pretty good...

787
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,920
I don't know what a gag is.

788
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:21,680
I don't know what like that has to do with a rock and roll, but it's a good gag.

789
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:27,000
Are we finding... is this becoming the number one theme park bathroom?

790
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,680
Is it beating the Harry Potter with the strange giggling?

791
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:36,960
I feel like there's weirdly another bathroom we've talked about that's not coming to me.

792
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,240
The secret Tiki Room one?

793
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,240
That's a good bathroom.

794
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,360
That's still like stuck in time?

795
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,920
I like Gomer's Gentleman's Lair.

796
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:43,920
The Tiki Room bathroom?

797
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:44,920
Yeah, there's one right to the left.

798
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:48,400
When you... if you were at the Tiki Room in Disneyland and you're in a little pre-show

799
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,680
area, you go up the stairs and instead of going straight through the doorway, there's

800
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:55,320
a door to your left that's a bathroom that's a holdover from when it was going to be a

801
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,320
dinner theater show.

802
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,760
So there's like a very small set of bathrooms there.

803
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,960
Which rumor is might be coming back.

804
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:02,960
Oh, where?

805
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,240
In the Aladdin's Oasis part of Disneyland.

806
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,240
Oh wow.

807
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,240
But these rumors pop up all the time and we don't know.

808
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:13,160
But they originally wanted to be a restaurant with live birds on top of it.

809
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,160
That's why they built the bathrooms there.

810
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,160
They thought it was going to be...

811
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:17,120
So you can clean the bird shit off of your clothes dinner show.

812
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,680
It wasn't after you eat there.

813
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:21,160
No, the Tahiti Terrace, that was something else.

814
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,160
Tahitian Terrace?

815
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,480
Tahitian Terrace was next to it.

816
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,480
Next to the bathroom?

817
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,480
Next to the tea.

818
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,480
Yeah.

819
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:32,680
Anyway, we're talking about restaurants that don't have funny rock related names at all.

820
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:33,680
Yeah, right, sorry.

821
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:34,680
But let's not ignore...

822
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,800
Does not have a funny rock related name.

823
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,400
You could not have set that up better.

824
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,880
Scott, I don't think you meant to.

825
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:46,520
You know, Goodwin always wanted to own a fish and chip shop.

826
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:49,280
And he finally got his chance at this park.

827
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,840
Codpiece Fish and Chip Restaurant.

828
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:57,080
I have the coat of arms right here, Jason, you can see.

829
00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:03,080
It's a lion and he's got a little codpiece underneath that says made with pride, battered

830
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,080
and fried.

831
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,080
Wow.

832
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:08,480
I thought the restaurant you were going to mention was...

833
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:22,360
It was called Great Meals Diner, but the E-A-T in great and the M-E in meals were capitalized

834
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:27,960
on the map and in the neon sign, the other letters would burn out and it would just say

835
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:28,960
eat me.

836
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:33,600
And that's like another one of the great jokes that we've been talking about.

837
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,480
Great rock and roll jokes.

838
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:41,680
Knockers love saying eat me.

839
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,000
I feel like we're...

840
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:48,920
I think the listeners at this point are picturing a park that is, you know, 10,000 acres.

841
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:54,160
It's 55 acres.

842
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:59,440
I will say with every single thing that we're saying, as much as a lot of these ideas are

843
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:06,280
insane or sound shitty or we're like goofing on them, there is something very nice that

844
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:12,240
it does seem to be the vision of this one guy who just like really had an idea, like

845
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:16,760
didn't even actually have an idea for a park, but just like fell into this thing.

846
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:17,760
Yeah.

847
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:18,760
And ran with it.

848
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,760
Yeah.

849
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:23,760
Ran with it and didn't have a lot of oversight for better or worse.

850
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,120
Yeah, because he didn't have a lot of committees.

851
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:29,600
He didn't have to check, it was a pure name licensing thing and he didn't have to check

852
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,360
with Hard Rock about a lot of these decisions.

853
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,360
They just went nuts.

854
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:35,880
Yeah, they paid them, I said 2.5 million a year for the license.

855
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:36,880
Wow.

856
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:37,880
I think it was.

857
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:38,880
Something like that.

858
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:39,880
So we...

859
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:44,520
They were very insistent on the logo, the Hard Rock logo is, you know, that classic

860
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,760
circular kind of logo.

861
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:47,760
Classic.

862
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,760
Classic.

863
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:55,800
And that was a subject of debate whether like did people, the billboards, did people, were

864
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,720
they not clear enough that it was a theme park?

865
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:02,040
People just think it was advertisements for the cafe.

866
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:06,160
Pretty bad move in the ads if you can't tell it's a theme park at all.

867
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:12,560
Well, that is if you buy ads, which was one of the downfalls of this park according to

868
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:16,860
all these articles is that I guess they were, they ran out of, they had exactly enough money

869
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:18,160
to build the park.

870
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,560
They had, then they had no more money to advertise it.

871
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,560
No.

872
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,880
They neglected to buy any ads before opening day.

873
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:27,640
So they just opened the park without advertising it.

874
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:33,400
And there was some Hard Rock license thing where Hard Rock, the company, would not let

875
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:36,040
them make deals with local Myrtle Beach hotels.

876
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,040
Yeah.

877
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:42,000
There was no local outreach, which is really key to get locals on your side anytime you

878
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,160
build a theme park.

879
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:46,360
I don't think people realize, I mean, it's very clear at Universal Hollywood, there's

880
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:49,000
houses right above the studio tour.

881
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,560
I guess a lot of those are at this point owned by Universal.

882
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:55,920
Universal Orlando usually doesn't stay open that late nowadays cause there are houses

883
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,000
directly behind the backstage area.

884
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Oh really.

885
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:03,700
And that's why there's not like a million midnight fireworks shows at that park.

886
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:05,000
This place made no efforts.

887
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Made little effort.

888
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,040
They thought that just because people came to Myrtle Beach, they would just go, oh, there's

889
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,240
a theme park over there.

890
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,240
Let's go.

891
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,240
They'll drive by it.

892
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,240
Yeah.

893
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:14,240
Yeah.

894
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:19,400
And also, yeah, that, I mean, this is really not what people came to Myrtle Beach to do.

895
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,720
They didn't want to rock out.

896
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:29,480
It's more of a budget conscious, Myrtle Beach or the theme park, I think university mentioned

897
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,680
Panama City, Florida.

898
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:33,320
I was thinking of Ocean City, Maryland a lot.

899
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:37,480
More of like a budget conscious sort of like vacation spot.

900
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,480
Right.

901
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:42,760
And also like if you're a fan of this music, I don't know that you would travel to go ride

902
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:47,680
the Led Zeppelin coaster or like it doesn't, it doesn't seem like that might necessarily

903
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:53,160
translate. They didn't establish that part, a crucial part of the Led Zeppelin fandom

904
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:56,460
experience is going on Led Zeppelin the ride.

905
00:40:56,460 --> 00:41:02,240
It's so, it's so crazy to make that in the way you talk about, we've, our podcast is

906
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,240
podcast the ride.

907
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:06,560
We talk about back to the future, the ride, and it feels like the definitive, it's the

908
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,560
ride of that experience.

909
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,040
This is, this is Led Zeppelin the ride.

910
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:15,400
It is just a roller coaster that plays a Led Zeppelin song on it.

911
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:18,440
And that summarizes the entire Led Zeppelin experience.

912
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,440
I was thinking about this.

913
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:24,600
So what is, if we're blue sky-ing it, what is the Led Zeppelin ride?

914
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:28,420
What is the definitive Led Zeppelin e-ticket experience?

915
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:31,340
Like do we want to see the band?

916
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:36,840
Do we want to see robots of the band or do we want to see the levee breaking?

917
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:38,180
Or do you want to see the real levee?

918
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:40,400
You want to climb the stairway to heaven?

919
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,700
See, now that's what I'm talking about.

920
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:44,280
That's what it should be, right?

921
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,520
They tried.

922
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:48,160
That that came up, that came up.

923
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,160
Oh, okay.

924
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:54,760
Because, uh, one of the band members wanted the song, the one song that the ride played

925
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,160
to be stairway to heaven.

926
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,960
That would make sense, I think.

927
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:03,200
But as the other band members pointed out, this is a very popular song to play at funerals

928
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:07,640
apparently, and they thought it would be a bit morbid.

929
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:12,860
But thinking ahead, they thought like, Hey, maybe every year we rotate out the song and

930
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:17,040
in year four or five, we get stairway to heaven in there.

931
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,160
But at that point, it's such a hit.

932
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,320
We can get it in there.

933
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:27,800
Oh, by the way, John Binkowski, our hero, had to go, he went and pitched this to Robert

934
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,600
Plant and Jimmy Page.

935
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:34,120
He's like in person showing him video of like a previs of what the coaster is going to be

936
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:36,400
like and how it syncs up with a whole lot of love.

937
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:41,520
And he got himself into, he embarrassed himself by singing the song in front of Robert Plant.

938
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,440
He's singing Robert Plant's own song in front of him.

939
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,720
You gotta give it up.

940
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:45,720
He's ballsy.

941
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:46,720
Yeah.

942
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:51,080
And this is the biggest band that, it's in the park, I would think, right?

943
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:52,080
Yeah.

944
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:53,400
Well, is it, no, I guess the Eagles.

945
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,960
Are the Eagles like bigger selling because of that greatest tips?

946
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,920
Maybe because they tour and they toured longer.

947
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,160
So that's another thing when you're talking about.

948
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,320
So yeah, let's talk about the Eagles.

949
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:04,320
The Eagles ride and the RPM ride are both worth talking about.

950
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:06,160
So let's start with the Eagles ride.

951
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,360
The Eagles life in the fast lane.

952
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:13,080
All I know about it or want to say about it is that the phrase, the coasters finale was

953
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:18,280
a helix around metal, metallic rock and roll scarecrows, which shot plumes of fire into

954
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:23,400
the sky, which I think reflects the music of the Eagles very well.

955
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:26,160
I didn't even pick up that it was scarecrows.

956
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:29,440
I just thought it was like a logo from one of the album covers.

957
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:35,280
It's basically like a poorly themed mine coaster ride that blares life at the fast lane at

958
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,280
you.

959
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:40,760
And you pull up next to some weird statues and a fireball goes off and that's the ride.

960
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:47,760
It's as much of a nightmare as the man's experience at the hotel California.

961
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:53,240
It's a metaphor of what he feels having to be at that scary hotel.

962
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:56,320
Or the Eagles member who was in the car.

963
00:43:56,320 --> 00:44:01,400
I mean the story about life in the fast lane is that he was in a car that his drug dealer

964
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:07,160
was driving and they were speeding down the PCH like way too fast.

965
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:10,360
And I forget what show it was.

966
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:13,160
He turned to it's like, Hey, slow down man.

967
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:18,160
And the drug dealer turned to him and went, Hey, that's life in the fast lane.

968
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:25,320
And then in the four hours Eagles documentary, which this is shaping up to be the same length,

969
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:31,680
the Eagles member then goes like, Oh yeah, life in the fast lane.

970
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:34,680
Oh, that's a ride.

971
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:38,560
That's a roller coaster right there.

972
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:41,960
And he knew to get the ride made, he'd have to write the song first.

973
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:42,960
Yeah, yeah.

974
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,680
I guess I got to do this step.

975
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,800
I think before you get on, here's a plus up.

976
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:51,920
I think before you get on Eagles life in the fast lane, you should watch a dramatic reenactment

977
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:52,920
of that scene.

978
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:56,160
Actors playing Glenn Fry or whatever.

979
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,320
And then right, Hey, that's life in the fast lane.

980
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,640
Doors open, you get on the ride.

981
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:03,720
Or there should just be an actor next to you on the roller coaster playing a drug dealer

982
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:06,960
who says that to you as you're like going crazy fast.

983
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:10,120
Like a great movie ride character who jumps in.

984
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:16,200
Just every row, the left seat is taken up by a person dressed in drug dealer costume.

985
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:20,520
And that person has to ride a roller coaster all day, every day.

986
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:23,180
That's his job.

987
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:27,040
Better than being AJ, but then getting sprayed with wet confetti.

988
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:28,720
And then there's RPM.

989
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:33,840
RPM from a technical standpoint, I think is interesting.

990
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:37,180
Before we met, it plays a car song, right?

991
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:39,120
It plays a lot of songs, I think.

992
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:40,120
It plays a lot of songs.

993
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:41,600
It plays 10 seconds of a lot of songs.

994
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:45,840
Yeah, like I was saying before, it's like, to get by is that you can play 10 seconds

995
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:48,000
of something and you don't have to pay.

996
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:55,120
So this ride, uh, in terms of is unique in coaster design in that you got in the car

997
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:58,600
and it had a fair swill style lift hill.

998
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:05,600
So like each car was like lifted up to the top of a hill, like with a first wheel mechanism.

999
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:10,080
And then, uh, you went down the hill and you went and threw the rest of the coaster.

1000
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:15,940
An interesting note about this ride is that, uh, this hadn't been tried before and it had

1001
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:18,560
not been experimented and perfected.

1002
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:24,920
So a lot of technical issues with this one cause it was kind of like a live test.

1003
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:26,480
Like it broke down a lot.

1004
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:29,040
It didn't hold a lot of people per hour.

1005
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:32,600
The queue line had a karaoke set up.

1006
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:34,080
Do you guys see this?

1007
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:35,080
Yes.

1008
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:36,560
That's designed to pass the time.

1009
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:41,080
Designed to pass the time of like how long it would take for each fair suite, like each

1010
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:43,200
fair swill mechanism to load the car.

1011
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:46,960
The video is so slow, it's so slow.

1012
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,960
And then the ride is over.

1013
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:50,960
And then the cars play.

1014
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:51,960
Yeah, insane.

1015
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:54,560
All right, so a karaoke show will make people not met.

1016
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:58,000
You know, just watch a three hour karaoke show.

1017
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:02,120
So then you could volunteer to do karaoke in line and there'd be a guy hosting it and

1018
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:05,600
he'd roast your ass if you were a bitch at it.

1019
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:10,120
And it's just, it's so much, it's so much going on.

1020
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:15,680
How was all of this held in one magical place for only six months?

1021
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:17,680
For only five months.

1022
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:23,440
Maybe we start talking about what happened, which is the financial collapse of 2008 that

1023
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:27,280
occurred exactly when the park opened.

1024
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:31,200
Well we haven't even talked about the ticket pricing system.

1025
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:37,880
You're not a fan of this podcast if you didn't shriek with delight at that phrase.

1026
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:41,600
Okay, so before we get to the crash of 2008.

1027
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:46,920
Okay, so there was a very simple ticket pricing system for this.

1028
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:53,080
No matter how old you were over the age of three, it cost $50 to get it.

1029
00:47:53,080 --> 00:48:00,560
The thinking is that's $50 folks, uh, roughly the same price as the medieval times dinner

1030
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:01,680
and a show.

1031
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:03,680
Uh, that's $50.

1032
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:08,120
Uh, the thinking being most of the rides, everyone could ride.

1033
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:14,480
So why, why would we charge less for the kids if everyone's riding it?

1034
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:20,880
Uh, there was a no, I think later on there was like an after 4pm ticket.

1035
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:26,280
Um, honestly the best deal seemed to be the annual pass was only $150 so you went three

1036
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:27,280
times.

1037
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:29,520
You paid that and you'll pass off baby.

1038
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:32,840
You think people got refunds on the annual pass when the park closed?

1039
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:33,840
No, absolutely not.

1040
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:34,840
No, no way.

1041
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:35,840
I might've tried.

1042
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:37,960
Um, yeah, that's the thing.

1043
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:41,760
Like no, no discounts or previews for locals.

1044
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:48,960
This one large, large price, um, which apparently they're a multiple Ripley's believe it or

1045
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:53,920
not in in Myrtle beach, multiple attractions they host.

1046
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:59,200
And to see all of those attractions is like $55 at that time.

1047
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:04,280
$50 for from, from three and up is $50.

1048
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:08,000
So like expensive, expensive for like a family of four.

1049
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:14,400
And for that you don't even get a nap in white satin sheets to be in the, in the moody blues

1050
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:15,400
bed.

1051
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:16,400
No.

1052
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:19,680
And there's no, the hard rock cafe is not close by.

1053
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:22,800
So you're not even, even if you were like, Oh, we'll eat, we'll go to the park and then

1054
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:23,800
we'll see.

1055
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:29,160
Like it's, you can't even eat in a town full of deals and discounts.

1056
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:31,320
And entertainment of all varieties.

1057
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:32,680
It's sink or swim.

1058
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:36,640
And for the hard rock park, it was sink extremely quickly.

1059
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:37,640
Yeah.

1060
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:43,200
So it also during the, during the financial collapse, and this is when the phrase staycation

1061
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:48,000
was popularized, a lot of people were, I think people in Myrtle beach were taking staycations

1062
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:52,760
and not going half mile to a, to hard rock park.

1063
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:59,000
Um, so people would, would overhear people talking about like, Oh, what is it?

1064
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:03,000
It's some sort of amusement, but like the hotel owners or the restaurant people that

1065
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:07,080
ask about it and no one knew like word of mouth in a small town.

1066
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:09,040
This isn't a huge metropolis.

1067
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:10,400
Like Myrtle beach isn't that big.

1068
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:15,280
It is a huge theme park that like, it'd be like people living a mile from Disneyland

1069
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,360
being like, Oh, there's that thing over there.

1070
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:18,360
What's that fucking thing?

1071
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:19,360
Oh yeah.

1072
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:20,360
Someone was telling me about that.

1073
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:21,360
Yeah.

1074
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:22,360
What is that?

1075
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:23,360
Who cares?

1076
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:24,360
Shut up.

1077
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:25,840
The guy who created the parks hit one of his regrets.

1078
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:31,080
He was saying was that it looked like a normal theme park, but people, so people would drive

1079
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:34,660
by and just go, Oh, that's some boring theme park with roller coasters.

1080
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:37,080
And they didn't know what kind of magic they were in store for.

1081
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:42,640
If they came, they didn't know it was full of lewd cows and punk dogs and music that

1082
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,840
didn't bleed over into other lands.

1083
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:51,280
They didn't know shitting bricks, exits, chicken exits for if you got too scared, there was

1084
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:55,680
a sign with a cartoon chicken shitting bricks.

1085
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:56,680
That's good.

1086
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:58,520
It's good to make people feel bad.

1087
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:00,840
All right.

1088
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:03,880
Well, pussies this way.

1089
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:06,840
So it, it, uh, the bottom fell out.

1090
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:10,800
It record gets prices in 2008.

1091
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:17,200
It became, so it got bought for $25 million off of what a cost of like almost 400 million

1092
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:18,200
to build it.

1093
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:22,080
Uh, so they, they really kind of took a bath on that.

1094
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:30,480
It became freestyle music park and they lost their license with the hard rock company and

1095
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:35,920
at, and bankruptcy court made them destroy every bit of merchandise with the hard rock

1096
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:36,920
logo on it.

1097
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:42,200
So they must have had like a giant bonfire of like, and they, and I only had to destroy

1098
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:45,600
every t-shirt and key chain and everything.

1099
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:50,220
Um, they had to re theme the entire park in three months.

1100
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:56,560
And so that's how you wind up with things like the Monstars of rock ride, which was,

1101
00:51:56,560 --> 00:52:02,040
they took the nights of white satin ride, which, so this went from, uh, being like everyone

1102
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:05,880
talking about it, like it was the greatest dark ride ever built to what, uh, that guy

1103
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:12,060
Jeremy Thompson calls the most universally hated dark ride in existence.

1104
00:52:12,060 --> 00:52:13,720
One to the bottom.

1105
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:19,600
I think that actually, I think like the greatest dark ride of all time, uh, might be an overstatement.

1106
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:26,640
I think that's an over, it looks shitty, the Monstars, but I mean, it's hard to top superstar

1107
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:27,640
limo.

1108
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:31,360
Like it's a higher profile one.

1109
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:33,860
People are upset because it was replaced, I think.

1110
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:37,120
So they're being extra harsh on the Monstars of rock.

1111
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:40,200
Well, like the Mike Mitchells of the world.

1112
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:43,360
You gotta have the mother suckling her son.

1113
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:45,880
I'm going to take out my IP.

1114
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:48,240
Frankenstein playing the drums sucks.

1115
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:50,240
I want my IP.

1116
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:54,120
There are like two friends, I guess this might be a zombie, but this is a picture from that

1117
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:55,120
monster's ride.

1118
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:56,540
What are these characters?

1119
00:52:56,540 --> 00:53:00,940
It's like, yeah, there's, it's like some sort of Frankenstein playing the drums, uh, like

1120
00:53:00,940 --> 00:53:03,980
Jack pumpkin head playing the guitar.

1121
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:06,560
It almost has disdain for its audience.

1122
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:08,660
Like it's almost like daring you though.

1123
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:12,400
And also, take this, isn't Monstars trademarked for space jam?

1124
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:13,400
Yeah.

1125
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:15,600
Like this is again, 2009?

1126
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:19,640
They didn't exist long enough to find out if that would be an issue.

1127
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:23,720
Um, the Led Zeppelin ride, do you know time machine time machine?

1128
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:25,280
I didn't get to watch that one.

1129
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:26,840
I watched the ride through.

1130
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:27,840
Okay.

1131
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:31,960
Uh, so the Led Zeppelin roller coaster became a roller coaster called time machine.

1132
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:36,120
And uh, I don't know if it alternated what time you went back to, but the ride through

1133
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:40,280
I watched you were going up the lift hill and it said like, welcome to time machine

1134
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:43,580
and welcome to the 1990s.

1135
00:53:43,580 --> 00:53:46,560
And then like I said, this will come up later.

1136
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:53,760
It plays such frenetic clips of like, if you want to be my lover, you got to get with my

1137
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:54,760
friends.

1138
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:56,000
And then just onto something else.

1139
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,900
It's like, it's hitting the fair use like every 15 seconds.

1140
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:02,480
It's just rotating through songs.

1141
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:03,480
It's so insane.

1142
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:09,840
This whole, it's like this whole park is like going through legal loops.

1143
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:12,080
It's the roller coaster ride there on, um,

1144
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:16,800
all the sections got renamed rock and roll heaven became Myrtle's beach.

1145
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:19,920
Um, born in the USA became kids in America.

1146
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:23,080
British invasion became across the pond.

1147
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:28,980
Cool country became country USA and they were immediately sued by the old owners for not

1148
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:32,660
changing enough.

1149
00:54:32,660 --> 00:54:38,160
Like the hard rock, uh, corporations sued, sued the new owners saying that you just like

1150
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:40,000
basically barely changed this.

1151
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:44,240
And then, um, and that only lasted like what a couple more months I think.

1152
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:45,240
Wow.

1153
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:47,920
And this, there's like nothing to talk about with freestyle.

1154
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:52,400
It does not have the charm and the wit of a hard rock park.

1155
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:57,400
This, I mean, the freestyle run seems like the real bottom of the theme park barrel.

1156
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:59,560
Yeah, that it's, yeah, it's desperate.

1157
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:01,440
It was pretty sad.

1158
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:06,720
And um, and then it closed and then I guess some of the rides went to a park called Asia

1159
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,160
Park in Vietnam.

1160
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:09,160
Yes.

1161
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:15,080
Uh, so I went to the Asia Park website and um, it just seems like mostly a standard amusement

1162
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:18,600
park except the fact that there's a nights in white setting.

1163
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:21,440
No, no, that's just dead.

1164
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:27,920
I, the funny thing about the Asia Park website is that they're like, check out our monorail

1165
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:36,360
and I on the homepage I was like, that monorail looks familiar and it is very clearly a Disney

1166
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:41,280
World monorail, uh, and then you click on the link and then it shows you the actual

1167
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:43,260
monorail and it looks totally different.

1168
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:47,320
So they stole some art.

1169
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:52,320
It might be the purple one, which has been commissioned for killing a person.

1170
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:58,600
Um, yeah, very weird Asia Park to have actual pictures of your monorail, but use like a

1171
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:00,720
different picture.

1172
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:05,720
And they banned to buy Led Zeppelin the ride and then just call it the ride I think.

1173
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:06,720
Yeah.

1174
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:11,040
One footnote about Hard Rock Park, according to a Yelp, one of the three Yelp reviews that's

1175
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:12,040
up.

1176
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:13,040
Oh no.

1177
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:18,960
Um, apparently there were spiders everywhere.

1178
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:20,640
The spiders from Mars?

1179
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:22,960
They were like, I don't know.

1180
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:23,960
They rebranded.

1181
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:25,720
We meant to do this.

1182
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:28,360
What questions do you have for the Spider Woman?

1183
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:33,520
They said they were trying to watch the Bohemian Rhapsody Firework show and every bench you

1184
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:35,800
sat on was just crawling with spiders.

1185
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:39,960
Um, leftover from the clay quarry.

1186
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:45,320
So, uh, I don't want to say real quick because I don't know that this is going to be quick,

1187
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:50,000
but like when you think a concert's over, but then you keep clapping and the band comes

1188
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,080
out for a killer encore.

1189
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:53,320
Like us right now.

1190
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:58,800
I want to talk about this stuff they had planned that never got built for Hard Rock Park cause

1191
00:56:58,800 --> 00:56:59,940
there's a lot of it.

1192
00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:07,040
They had grand plans, which I think honestly, if the economic conditions had been better,

1193
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:12,000
you know, I feel like there are a lot of, of, of new parks that open and people kind

1194
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,800
of go like the first year is always a wash.

1195
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:20,920
Uh, so I think like if the economy had been doing better and they had been able to compromise

1196
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:27,320
on like ticket tiers or advertising the second year, I think this park might still be around

1197
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:32,680
or at least have gotten a few more years and they certainly had grand plans.

1198
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:39,560
Like uh, for example, Rockin' Horror Nights, their version of Halloween Horror Nights.

1199
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:41,360
Here is some concept art for a poster.

1200
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:44,760
It is a guitar that is also a chainsaw.

1201
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:47,240
What don't they turn a guitar into?

1202
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:49,680
And it's got the tagline, what?

1203
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:54,640
Afraid of a little music, which I'm not quite sure what that's a play on.

1204
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:59,320
Oh, you know, and also the third thing that they made a guitar and do is that they do

1205
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:01,080
have a sword in the stone ripoff.

1206
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:02,080
Oh yeah.

1207
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:05,120
They crown the king or queen of rock every afternoon.

1208
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:11,360
I'm sure they have a guy dressed in like a leather vest.

1209
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:17,120
There was plans for a wedding chapel, the little white chapel kind of themed after the

1210
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:19,640
little white chapel, uh, in Vegas.

1211
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:27,880
Uh, so if you want to have an unconventional rock and roll wedding, um, there was a Paradise

1212
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:31,360
City, which I love.

1213
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:37,600
Paradise City was going to be like their version of downtown Disney or a city walk, but they

1214
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:39,440
wanted to go a step further.

1215
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:44,520
Like our California landmarks, the Americana and the Grove.

1216
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:47,960
Uh, there was going to be condos above Paradise City.

1217
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:51,040
So you could have a time share at the Hard Rock Park.

1218
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:54,840
And this is in addition to plans for a Hard Rock hotel.

1219
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:57,680
Uh, people were going to live there.

1220
00:58:57,680 --> 00:58:58,680
Yes.

1221
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:01,840
People, you could live in Hard Rock.

1222
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:03,000
Um, wow.

1223
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,720
Well we know where Bugmane would be.

1224
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:10,840
The summer house would be.

1225
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:13,320
Our friend who lives at the Americana in Glendale.

1226
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:15,520
Uh, water rides.

1227
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:17,680
They had plans for so many water rides.

1228
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:24,120
It's like, they really want a welcome to the jungle themed rapids ride.

1229
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:27,480
So with those, so Paradise City and welcome to the jungle, there was a whole Guns and

1230
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:29,720
Roses section or we don't know.

1231
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:33,200
It just happened because there was a song.

1232
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:35,720
Patience Planet.

1233
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:39,200
Every song is becoming.

1234
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:40,240
I think this is the name.

1235
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:43,640
Was Chinese democracy out by then or did it come out in 2010?

1236
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:45,640
No, I think that was 2010.

1237
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:46,640
Yeah.

1238
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:47,640
There was plans.

1239
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:49,000
I don't know if we can put those songs in there.

1240
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:57,160
They were going to, okay, they were lengthen the track on, uh, on the RPM coaster, on the

1241
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:58,160
cars coaster.

1242
00:59:58,160 --> 00:59:59,160
Cause it was short.

1243
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:01,600
The criticism of it was that the ride was very short.

1244
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:02,600
Yeah.

1245
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:06,040
So then they were going to put in a magnetic launch system halfway through and they were

1246
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:09,440
trying to pair with Jaguar to do it.

1247
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:10,560
The car company.

1248
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:11,560
The car company.

1249
01:00:11,560 --> 01:00:13,280
Yes, that's right.

1250
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:18,760
And speaking of car companies, the Ford Motor Company not doing well at the time.

1251
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:26,160
They were approached for, uh, build a factory, build a factory on site and, uh, what appears

1252
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:34,160
to be like a swinging pirate ship, but it was going to be a giant, uh, uh, Ford convertible,

1253
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:36,480
a giant Lincoln convertible.

1254
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:40,360
Uh, and then more ads is what you're saying.

1255
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:41,360
More ads.

1256
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:42,360
Yeah.

1257
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:43,360
The cars would save the part.

1258
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:44,360
Yeah.

1259
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:46,360
Cars would say the cars and rock and roll are intertwined.

1260
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:52,120
And you would see that in the attraction called Mustang Sally.

1261
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:58,600
Mustang Sally was going to be a journey through route 66, including like America's main street.

1262
01:00:58,600 --> 01:01:02,800
And you would start at Chicago and end in Los Angeles.

1263
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:05,200
I know we keep, we keep saying this over and over again.

1264
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:08,800
Here are the top songs in 2008.

1265
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:10,460
Viva la Vida by Coldplay.

1266
01:01:10,460 --> 01:01:12,480
I kissed a girl, Katy Perry.

1267
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:13,480
These songs are not old.

1268
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:15,200
This is what 2008 was like.

1269
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:16,200
So it's crazy.

1270
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:18,160
Mustaries a decade old.

1271
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:19,160
Yeah, that is crazy.

1272
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:20,160
Oh my God.

1273
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:22,680
Number three must've been like an Eagles song though, right?

1274
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:23,840
Believe it or not.

1275
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:25,720
It's like womanizer Britney Spears.

1276
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:31,400
Well, Mike, what if I were to tell you that Mustang Sally stopped at a drive in hamburger

1277
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:35,840
car hoppers, stir up, or racing into a drag race.

1278
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:36,840
What is this ride?

1279
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:39,520
You just drive around, you drive around.

1280
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:42,960
Honestly, the way they describe it, you're driving through like this main street and

1281
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:43,960
stuff.

1282
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:48,880
It sounds kind of like what radiator racers, radiator Springs, radiator Springs racers

1283
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:49,880
became.

1284
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:52,560
So it was going to, would there be a daddy's little fatty?

1285
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:53,560
Yeah.

1286
01:01:53,560 --> 01:01:56,160
Little fatty stunt show.

1287
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:58,960
Did they get the Bob Wills in his Texas playboys license?

1288
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:03,080
Well, he was going to go in the Bob Wills in the Texas playboys land.

1289
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:04,080
What?

1290
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:06,120
Entire section.

1291
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:13,080
And then, and then they had a big plan in the year 2026 to open the hall of black musicians.

1292
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:17,000
It was not a lot of just one small room.

1293
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,400
Not a lot of rap.

1294
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:20,040
Not a big deal.

1295
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:21,040
Not a lot of women.

1296
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:25,600
Oh God, I didn't even talk about the Arlo Guthrie Alice's Restaurant.

1297
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:27,160
Oh yeah.

1298
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:28,160
That's crazy.

1299
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:29,160
Arlo Guthrie.

1300
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:33,040
And then the big, the big centerpiece of this Alice's Restaurant, this, which is a very

1301
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:35,960
boring song that some old people like.

1302
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:39,440
That me and my nerd friends thought was hilarious when we were 13 years old.

1303
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:41,880
The reason Jason got into comedy was Arlo Guthrie.

1304
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:43,960
Arlo Guthrie and the Adventurer's Club.

1305
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:45,800
Like influenced the folk singers.

1306
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:50,800
The centerpiece of this, this is actually built, the centerpiece was a lazy Susan with

1307
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:52,880
Arlo Guthrie's face on it.

1308
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:56,720
Then you would turn it around and he would be young and then he would be old.

1309
01:02:56,720 --> 01:03:02,960
So they weren't able to pull off the extension, the hyper speed extension to the roller coaster,

1310
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:06,120
but they were able to build a table size lazy Susan.

1311
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:07,120
Correct.

1312
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:09,160
So yeah, this place pulled off some stuff.

1313
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:13,040
With Arlo Guthrie's face on it.

1314
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:15,760
I mean with this thing, this is, I mean it's crazy.

1315
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:18,440
So was that, was there more new stuff coming?

1316
01:03:18,440 --> 01:03:21,840
Well just the Hard Rock Hotel.

1317
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:25,840
We said the Hard Rock Hotel and it was Heavy Metal Graveyard was the name of the sculpture

1318
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:30,200
garden you would enter through, exclusive for hotel guests.

1319
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:33,920
Hotel separate from the condos, what?

1320
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:40,040
And there would be tombstones there at like, graves of dead, like heavy metal people?

1321
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:45,920
No, that's just what they called the sculpture garden with the upsetting mouth sculpture.

1322
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:46,920
So that did exist.

1323
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:48,720
They already had a cemetery.

1324
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:56,120
But it wasn't like gravestone to Metallica's dead bass player or something.

1325
01:03:56,120 --> 01:04:02,280
Their wish list for the Halloween event was like, stuff themed to like Alice Cooper, Marilyn

1326
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:08,040
Manson, Iron Maiden, which didn't Halloween Horror Nights get Alice Cooper?

1327
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:09,040
They had Black Sabbath.

1328
01:04:09,040 --> 01:04:10,040
They had a Black Sabbath house.

1329
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:12,280
Alice Cooper has designed mazes for Halloween.

1330
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:14,600
He's designed mazes for Halloween stuff.

1331
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:19,920
Also on their wish list to not get closed.

1332
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:21,160
Get everything on the list.

1333
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:25,200
I feel like no one visits the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, right?

1334
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:29,080
That's got to be one of the lowest, like do you know anyone who's gone to Cleveland to

1335
01:04:29,080 --> 01:04:30,080
visit that?

1336
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:31,080
Just Vic Berger.

1337
01:04:31,080 --> 01:04:32,080
Right.

1338
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:35,520
But he was only there because he was at the convention.

1339
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:41,640
I feel like that is an existing rock and roll tourist destination that no one I know has

1340
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:43,560
ever expressed an interest in going.

1341
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:44,560
No one you know.

1342
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:48,960
We know nothing but kitsch hounds and psychopaths.

1343
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:51,800
Nobody's taking the plunge to Cleveland.

1344
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:53,560
I'll go there if I'm there for some reason.

1345
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:56,360
There would be no reason I would make a trip.

1346
01:04:56,360 --> 01:05:00,340
But no one is like traveling to a rock and roll tourist.

1347
01:05:00,340 --> 01:05:04,520
Like this whole thing does seem like it was a bad idea from the beginning.

1348
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:09,160
I think like and like the name Hard Rock Park is like a bad name.

1349
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:13,160
I think it should be like Rockland or something.

1350
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:14,160
Right.

1351
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:17,200
Rockland is better.

1352
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:18,720
Rockland theme park.

1353
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:20,920
Put theme in the name so people know.

1354
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:21,920
Yeah, that helps.

1355
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:26,480
I would think it was a Hard Rock Cafe if I saw that logo and it told me what exit to

1356
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:27,480
get off.

1357
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:28,480
Oh, parking for Hard Rock Cafe.

1358
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:29,480
Terrific.

1359
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:30,480
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

1360
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:33,560
Well, yeah, also, yeah, it doesn't it sound like it sounds like a theme park based on

1361
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:37,320
a restaurant more than the concept of hard rock.

1362
01:05:37,320 --> 01:05:42,080
So it's going to be roller coasters that are like tables.

1363
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:46,240
It's like a check in stand.

1364
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:48,320
Their macaroni is pretty good.

1365
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:52,600
Yeah, it's because like what is the what is an average baby boomer?

1366
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:54,480
What do they think of the Hard Rock Cafe?

1367
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:59,240
Do they think of their rock and roll heroes or do they think of like a hamburger that's

1368
01:05:59,240 --> 01:06:00,240
OK?

1369
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:02,700
Like do they think what do they think of when they think of the brand?

1370
01:06:02,700 --> 01:06:04,440
What is the brand inspire in them?

1371
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:08,720
This is my thing with the brand in general is what what is it?

1372
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:10,840
What I don't know what it's getting at.

1373
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:15,520
And you go to Hard Rock Cafe and there's a car rotating around and like it'll say like

1374
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:19,960
save the planet, but also save a few fries for me.

1375
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:28,800
Like it's like it's this weird, really passionate but attitude and like that hard rock humor.

1376
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:31,400
I could get a job writing their sign jokes.

1377
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:36,320
You know, my family always had positive associations with it, for one thing, because the food was

1378
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:38,800
always better than playing Hollywood.

1379
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:40,120
The food was always better here.

1380
01:06:40,120 --> 01:06:43,120
Oh, well, what a mountain to climb.

1381
01:06:43,120 --> 01:06:45,600
The food is better than playing Hollywood.

1382
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:48,160
At the restaurant and then always had a great time at the hotel.

1383
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:50,160
I stayed at the hotel last year in Orlando.

1384
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:51,160
It was great.

1385
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:55,160
The hard rock, the brand, the Hard Rock Hotel in Orlando is good.

1386
01:06:55,160 --> 01:06:56,160
Yeah.

1387
01:06:56,160 --> 01:07:01,360
The Hard Rock restaurant out here and anywhere else blows hard.

1388
01:07:01,360 --> 01:07:02,640
It's so bad.

1389
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:03,640
They're terrible.

1390
01:07:03,640 --> 01:07:04,640
They're so overpriced.

1391
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:07,960
You also had a bad experience at one of the other hotels, right?

1392
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:09,040
Didn't you stay at one?

1393
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:10,040
The Hard Rock?

1394
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:11,040
The Hard Rock Hotel.

1395
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:12,720
Didn't you tell us tell me a story?

1396
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:13,720
You got beaten up, right?

1397
01:07:13,720 --> 01:07:19,680
There were symbols on the lamps in the hallways and someone was eating the symbol.

1398
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:20,680
Yeah, that was it.

1399
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:21,680
We were in Orlando.

1400
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:23,160
The hotel was still nice, but in the...

1401
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:24,160
Oh, yeah.

1402
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:25,160
This is insane.

1403
01:07:25,160 --> 01:07:26,160
Wait, that was Orlando or Vegas?

1404
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:27,160
Oh, God.

1405
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:28,160
Is there one in Vegas?

1406
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:29,160
Yeah.

1407
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:30,160
Yeah.

1408
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:31,160
I don't remember which one.

1409
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:32,160
It's off the trip.

1410
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:33,160
Oh, yeah.

1411
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:35,320
It probably was Vegas then because there were a lot of real drunk people.

1412
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:40,920
This dumbest decision you could possibly make in Las Vegas at a hotel is in the hallway

1413
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:47,560
over the light fixtures putting real symbols from a drum set.

1414
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:48,560
They hang.

1415
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:54,280
They are everywhere and all that happens during the night is that drunk guys just bang on

1416
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:56,440
them as they're walking to their room.

1417
01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:57,440
Oh, God.

1418
01:07:57,440 --> 01:08:02,400
So you get in the middle of the night, you're jolted away because some asshole came back

1419
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:05,280
and just started clanging a symbol.

1420
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:06,280
That's rock and roll, man.

1421
01:08:06,280 --> 01:08:08,320
They've had a lot of incidents in Vegas.

1422
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:14,440
There was a thing where there was a three-year-old who got hit by a growing machine and he made

1423
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:20,920
his way to the Hard Rock Cafe and picked up the guitar and the sign and played it because

1424
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:23,840
he was the size of the guitar by that point.

1425
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:29,160
And the SWAT team had to shoot him down and there was a little Indian in his pocket.

1426
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:30,160
So they about...

1427
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:36,720
Yeah, look, it's a troubled franchise in general and drunk guys and blown up kids.

1428
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:40,200
So you know...

1429
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:41,200
Get out of this.

1430
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:44,440
What's the point of getting out of this?

1431
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:45,440
I don't know.

1432
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:46,440
I think we're stuck.

1433
01:08:46,440 --> 01:08:47,440
We can't leave here.

1434
01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:48,440
What about other...

1435
01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:49,440
No, go ahead.

1436
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:53,680
Oh, just as a little footnote.

1437
01:08:53,680 --> 01:09:01,260
There's a book on Amazon called Grandstand by Reed Barwick that's kind of the primary

1438
01:09:01,260 --> 01:09:08,920
colors of more of freestyle music park than Hard Rock Park.

1439
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:17,080
But it's a lightly fictionalized ebook by a former employee in 2010.

1440
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:23,820
Hard Rock Park is known as Rock Time Amusement Park and Freestyle Park becomes Good Times

1441
01:09:23,820 --> 01:09:25,480
Park.

1442
01:09:25,480 --> 01:09:31,920
And it's about a reporter named Caitlin Tufts and her managing editor Jack O'Banion set

1443
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:37,560
out to discover the real story behind Rock Time Amusement Park in Myrtle Beach.

1444
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:38,840
And in the reviews...

1445
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:43,920
And so basically there's something fishy afoot at this rebranded rock themed amusement park.

1446
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:45,920
So it's clear what the guy's talking about.

1447
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:52,260
He was working as a purchasing manager at Freestyle and he would watch the new owners

1448
01:09:52,260 --> 01:09:57,400
walk through with Russian investors who bailed out the park and made it become Freestyle

1449
01:09:57,400 --> 01:09:58,400
Park.

1450
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:02,900
And this was his quote to Myrtle Beach Online, and why he wrote the book.

1451
01:10:02,900 --> 01:10:06,780
You're watching things and you think, this would be an interesting story if there was

1452
01:10:06,780 --> 01:10:10,220
something to it more than what there was.

1453
01:10:10,220 --> 01:10:15,880
Which I think anything would be an interesting story if there was something more to it that

1454
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:16,880
would make it interesting.

1455
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:19,740
A flourish does make a story interesting.

1456
01:10:19,740 --> 01:10:22,280
And so it's about this reporter trying to get to the bottom of what happened at this

1457
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:26,640
park and there's a review that has a spoiler in it that mentions this journalist Caitlin

1458
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:34,740
Tufts that's investigating has to become a sniper and take out the bad guys while the

1459
01:10:34,740 --> 01:10:36,640
FBI is closing in.

1460
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:42,000
So that's Grandstand, that's the inside story of Hard Rock becoming Freestyle and the shady

1461
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,000
dealings.

1462
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,640
Check it out, read Jay Barwick on Amazon.

1463
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:50,060
Yeah, I looked up that book after you mentioned it to us earlier.

1464
01:10:50,060 --> 01:10:56,560
It is $9.99, a little high for a Kindle self-published book.

1465
01:10:56,560 --> 01:11:00,340
It is $399 pages long.

1466
01:11:00,340 --> 01:11:05,120
And I am going to buy it as soon as I get home.

1467
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:09,440
I actually have it right here and here now is the prologue.

1468
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:10,440
Dedication.

1469
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:20,200
But all this said, we did feel there were some missed opportunities though for like

1470
01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:21,760
more music themed stuff.

1471
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:23,800
Yeah, I mean we all had different ideas.

1472
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:26,940
I mean some of us would have plussed the park up as is.

1473
01:11:26,940 --> 01:11:31,080
My particular idea for the park would be to bring it back but you know make it more a

1474
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:32,840
little more modern.

1475
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:36,320
But we can all, yeah Jason you were about to say you had some ideas.

1476
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:48,320
Well yeah, I mean number one with a bullet, missed opportunity, Gigi Allen themed bathroom.

1477
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:54,520
I feel like you know another group to bring it up a little closer to present day but still

1478
01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:58,120
keep it not exactly too timely.

1479
01:11:58,120 --> 01:12:02,040
Some sort of chocolate covered starfish and hot dog flavored water.

1480
01:12:02,040 --> 01:12:05,040
Oh all of the water in the park is hot dog flavored.

1481
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:07,080
Can you imagine if you fell into that water?

1482
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:09,240
Oh yeah, like butter beer has been such a hit.

1483
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:14,280
If you could get hot dog water and you get a little chocolate starfish on top that would

1484
01:12:14,280 --> 01:12:15,280
be great.

1485
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:18,160
And you're just saying that though because the Sheridans have had a great relationship

1486
01:12:18,160 --> 01:12:21,720
with hot dog water over the years.

1487
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:24,120
Specifically Jason Sheridan.

1488
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:27,000
And then for this I got to give credit to a YouTube user.

1489
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:28,240
They use their real name.

1490
01:12:28,240 --> 01:12:32,140
I'm not going to read that.

1491
01:12:32,140 --> 01:12:36,080
On a comment I think I pulled this from the time machine ride through I watched.

1492
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:40,800
They said I am sad that none of the songs from Tragic Kingdom by No Doubt were on there

1493
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:46,640
like Spiderwebs, Don't Speak, Excuse Me Mister, Sunday Morning or Just Like a Girl.

1494
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:52,320
It'd be cool if someday a dark ride was themed to the tragic kingdom with 14 scenes for each

1495
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:53,320
of the songs.

1496
01:12:53,320 --> 01:12:59,280
Which this would be the most elaborate dark ride ever made and I think it's time.

1497
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:02,560
I think we need to take this person's advice.

1498
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:10,960
Take Elias's advice and let's build this Tragic Kingdom ride.

1499
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:17,280
Not to contradict her comment but to be fair Hard Rock Park is full of spiderwebs.

1500
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:22,800
Oh, I guess that was, you know everyone talks about the attention to detail.

1501
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:24,920
And I guess that's the nod to No Doubt.

1502
01:13:24,920 --> 01:13:25,920
Yeah, yeah, it's in.

1503
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:28,280
That's what the spiders were about.

1504
01:13:28,280 --> 01:13:31,640
I had a couple ideas for some coasters.

1505
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:35,680
I thought, you know, let's get some more modern bands in there, I agree.

1506
01:13:35,680 --> 01:13:43,920
And let's represent one of the best, we're all thinking about it, blues traveler.

1507
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:49,800
So the runaround roller coaster and you are in a giant, your ride vehicle is a giant John

1508
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:51,780
Popper harmonica.

1509
01:13:51,780 --> 01:13:57,120
And as you move past certain sections of the track you go through his big sweaty mouth

1510
01:13:57,120 --> 01:13:59,600
and it's like he is playing you.

1511
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:03,720
I have another idea which is a double coaster, like the dueling dragons kind of vibe but

1512
01:14:03,720 --> 01:14:07,280
it's based around the spin doctor's two princes.

1513
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:12,440
You get to choose which prince and at the end you determine which prince wins the hand

1514
01:14:12,440 --> 01:14:14,360
of the girl.

1515
01:14:14,360 --> 01:14:21,040
And another guy legitimately a big rocker not represented in the park is Ozzy Osbourne.

1516
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:28,100
And so, and you know, obvious one, don't you want to get on the crazy train?

1517
01:14:28,100 --> 01:14:34,560
And so my idea for a crazy train roller coaster is that you have one of those quick launches,

1518
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:39,600
magnetized launches, and it's like you are getting sucked up, pulled into his nostrils

1519
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:41,480
and up into his brain.

1520
01:14:41,480 --> 01:14:47,520
He's snorting you like cocaine and then you get to go in, take your crazy train through

1521
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:49,000
Ozzy's brain.

1522
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:55,960
And you see flickers of ideas that he's having of some of the crazier things he's done in

1523
01:14:55,960 --> 01:14:57,000
his life.

1524
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:02,040
Like when he did a Nazi goose step and then dipped his testicles into a music executive's

1525
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:04,640
glass of wine and then peed in it.

1526
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:09,280
So you could watch, you passed by a video kind of playing him having the idea.

1527
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:13,640
But then at the end, right, when you think Ozzy's lost his mind entirely, there's a nice

1528
01:15:13,640 --> 01:15:19,240
little ending, which is that you pass by a little glimmer of the idea for the Osbournes

1529
01:15:19,240 --> 01:15:20,240
TV show.

1530
01:15:20,240 --> 01:15:21,240
Oh, nice.

1531
01:15:21,240 --> 01:15:22,240
That ties it all together.

1532
01:15:22,240 --> 01:15:24,980
A good idea he had that turned everything around.

1533
01:15:24,980 --> 01:15:27,200
That's crazy train the ride.

1534
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:28,200
That's great.

1535
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:29,600
I mean, let me throw a few out.

1536
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:30,600
Sure.

1537
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:31,600
If you wouldn't mind.

1538
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:32,600
That sounds good.

1539
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:34,320
Yeah, so I'm thinking maybe more modern.

1540
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:37,760
So like what rock songs have really like permeated the culture?

1541
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:44,160
And let me start by saying, wouldn't it be cool to go on a dark ride in a nuclear power

1542
01:15:44,160 --> 01:15:45,160
plant?

1543
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:47,840
And especially one that maybe is melting down.

1544
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:48,840
Hell yes.

1545
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:51,040
I'm talking about, and Jason knows where I'm going with this.

1546
01:15:51,040 --> 01:15:55,800
I'm talking about radioactive Imagine Dragons the ride.

1547
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:57,880
Okay, welcome to the new age.

1548
01:15:57,880 --> 01:15:58,880
All right.

1549
01:15:58,880 --> 01:15:59,880
And you're going through it now.

1550
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:01,880
I'm taking liberties with the song.

1551
01:16:01,880 --> 01:16:06,200
It's not really about a meltdown, a nuclear power plant, but we're just gonna like the

1552
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:09,320
Knights in White Satin make some shit up about what it is.

1553
01:16:09,320 --> 01:16:16,120
So you're just going through there and you all have to wear vests, like thick metal to

1554
01:16:16,120 --> 01:16:17,240
prevent it.

1555
01:16:17,240 --> 01:16:19,560
And of course you make it out of there narrowly.

1556
01:16:19,560 --> 01:16:22,240
All right, let's talk kids.

1557
01:16:22,240 --> 01:16:23,800
Kids have to play in fun areas.

1558
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:24,800
Okay.

1559
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:25,800
They better.

1560
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:26,800
They better, yeah.

1561
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:32,120
So we're gonna have obviously have them go to the fun, we are young section of the park.

1562
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:36,140
And they're gonna play on, you know, the little equipment and there's gonna be water spraying.

1563
01:16:36,140 --> 01:16:43,040
My last idea, not as new of a band, but I guess keeping in the tradition of the hard

1564
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:49,160
rock and it's how current it is, this attraction is much like this upcoming Millennium Falcon

1565
01:16:49,160 --> 01:16:52,000
simulator ride to Star Wars land.

1566
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,760
This attraction is called The Day the Music Died.

1567
01:16:54,760 --> 01:16:59,840
And you have to sit and pilot the plane that Richie Valens, the Buddy Holly, and the Big

1568
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:01,360
Bob were on.

1569
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:05,720
Can you change history and keep these three musical legends alive?

1570
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:08,960
And the great thing about this is a simulator, you can lose.

1571
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:13,560
And then if you lose, much like in Star Wars land, employees will come up to you later

1572
01:17:13,560 --> 01:17:14,920
and go, I heard what you did.

1573
01:17:14,920 --> 01:17:15,920
I heard what happened.

1574
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:18,180
I heard you let them down.

1575
01:17:18,180 --> 01:17:20,920
And that'll follow you around Hard Rock Park, which is fun.

1576
01:17:20,920 --> 01:17:21,920
It's interactive.

1577
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:23,240
It's what everyone wants now.

1578
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:26,240
You know what they're already starting to call today because of you?

1579
01:17:26,240 --> 01:17:27,600
The day the music died.

1580
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:28,600
It's already good.

1581
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:29,600
The day's not even over.

1582
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:30,600
That's what people are saying.

1583
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:31,600
Yeah.

1584
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:33,640
What a reputation to carry around with you.

1585
01:17:33,640 --> 01:17:40,040
But if you do crash the plane, they congratulate you for allowing that classic song to be written

1586
01:17:40,040 --> 01:17:41,040
about the plane crash.

1587
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:42,040
Right.

1588
01:17:42,040 --> 01:17:44,040
Well, there's a walk around American Pie.

1589
01:17:44,040 --> 01:17:46,040
Is that what you're saying?

1590
01:17:46,040 --> 01:17:47,040
Yeah.

1591
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:48,040
Yeah, okay.

1592
01:17:48,040 --> 01:17:51,200
So you, yeah, wait a minute.

1593
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:57,840
Or you think you're supposed to keep the plane in the air, or you land it safely, and then

1594
01:17:57,840 --> 01:17:58,840
you ruin...

1595
01:17:58,840 --> 01:18:01,400
Dom McLean doesn't get to have a career.

1596
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:05,080
But there's a Dom McLean walk around, and if you do crash a plane, he comes around and

1597
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:06,080
thanks you.

1598
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:07,160
He says, thank you.

1599
01:18:07,160 --> 01:18:08,160
I've been inspired.

1600
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:10,040
And it's played by Dom McLean.

1601
01:18:10,040 --> 01:18:11,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1602
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:12,040
Dom McLean is playing himself.

1603
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:13,040
He's around.

1604
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:14,040
Uh huh.

1605
01:18:14,040 --> 01:18:15,040
So that's, I mean, those are just some ideas.

1606
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:17,000
They're not fleshed out, but you know.

1607
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:23,280
I would just, my only thing, I would just give Winston the punk rock dog a friend.

1608
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:30,640
It would be a walk around character dressed as Macklemore, dressed as that anti-Semitic

1609
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:34,000
character that he performed at once and got in trouble for.

1610
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:38,720
His name is Churchill.

1611
01:18:38,720 --> 01:18:40,360
Winston and Churchill.

1612
01:18:40,360 --> 01:18:41,360
Wow.

1613
01:18:41,360 --> 01:18:43,320
Well, we covered it all.

1614
01:18:43,320 --> 01:18:48,160
That's roller coasters, that's kids' areas, that's shows, new technology.

1615
01:18:48,160 --> 01:18:54,520
And I feel like that coda we just did was like the day in the life of our immediately

1616
01:18:54,520 --> 01:19:01,040
classic album of Failed Rides, the podcast, the ride, the episode.

1617
01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:06,400
And with that being said, here's 70 more ride ideas.

1618
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:11,480
Okay, now we're coming back to the station.

1619
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:14,320
Jason Walliner, you've survived Podcast the Ride.

1620
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:15,880
Thank you so much for having me.

1621
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:19,200
That's saying something in this case.

1622
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:23,660
It's usually not the badge people really have to wear with pride, but you really survived

1623
01:19:23,660 --> 01:19:25,640
something here.

1624
01:19:25,640 --> 01:19:30,840
I feel like we've all spent a day together in 100 degree South Carolina heat at the Hard

1625
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:31,840
Rock bar.

1626
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:35,640
Yeah, you know, we'll never in our lives get to go there, but I kind of do feel like we

1627
01:19:35,640 --> 01:19:36,640
went there.

1628
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:37,640
Yeah.

1629
01:19:37,640 --> 01:19:38,640
Yeah.

1630
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:41,560
It feels like we really spent some time in that environment.

1631
01:19:41,560 --> 01:19:46,680
And we got more time out of this than people got out of the world of Sid and Marty Croft.

1632
01:19:46,680 --> 01:19:49,200
We got a more robust amount of hours.

1633
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:55,760
Mikey is going to tell us to leave soon and we're not allowed to come back in and do the

1634
01:19:55,760 --> 01:19:56,920
parts we liked again.

1635
01:19:56,920 --> 01:20:00,080
The lights will be shut off of this podcast episode.

1636
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:02,040
This part still exists.

1637
01:20:02,040 --> 01:20:03,520
It's still on Google Earth.

1638
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:08,560
If you want to check it out, you can still fly around it and walk around it like that

1639
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:11,440
weird post-apocalyptic thing.

1640
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:14,560
It's used for post-apocalyptic scenes and movies.

1641
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:15,560
Oh yes, Revolution.

1642
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:16,560
Revolution.

1643
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:17,560
But as I said, a lot of...

1644
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:18,560
I forgot to get to Revolution.

1645
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:19,560
Did you watch that?

1646
01:20:19,560 --> 01:20:20,560
I didn't watch it.

1647
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:21,560
I didn't watch it.

1648
01:20:21,560 --> 01:20:27,400
But a lot of, you know, now a lot of the park is just, as I said, seven hours ago, the Medieval

1649
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:31,860
Times horses are now running free around that place.

1650
01:20:31,860 --> 01:20:32,860
And how beautiful.

1651
01:20:32,860 --> 01:20:34,520
What a beautiful image.

1652
01:20:34,520 --> 01:20:41,720
Just like a couple of white horses free to roam where the land where people once walked.

1653
01:20:41,720 --> 01:20:42,720
Once rocked.

1654
01:20:42,720 --> 01:20:44,000
When once rocked.

1655
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,520
Hey, thank you so much for being here.

1656
01:20:46,520 --> 01:20:52,000
Any further thoughts, Jason, or anything you'd like to alert the world to?

1657
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:53,000
No.

1658
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:56,040
You said it.

1659
01:20:56,040 --> 01:20:57,840
That'll do it, folks.

1660
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:00,160
Thanks for joining us.

1661
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:03,765
And in the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make.
