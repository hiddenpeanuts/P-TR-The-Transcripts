1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:03,440
Dog.

3
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:11,800
Warning, the following podcast may contain fake stories where Amelia Earhart is an asshole,

4
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:19,580
real stories about mule piss, and overworked PAs who must abduct children and clean toilets.

5
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:26,020
Your quest is to not lose your phone so you can hear guest Django Gold and the Good Boys

6
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:28,500
talk Legends of the Hidden Temple.

7
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,780
On Podcast The Ride.

8
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:55,380
Welcome to the Temple of Unnecessary Knowledge, I'm Scott, your guide.

9
00:00:55,380 --> 00:01:00,380
The Temple is filled with many dry facts about things from our childhoods that don't matter,

10
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:05,620
and one of today's themes teams will get to say more of those facts than anyone else.

11
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:07,820
Will it be the Silver Sheridans?

12
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:09,880
Maybe.

13
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:10,980
It could be.

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,360
This is a temple that's a lot less nerve wracking than the television show temple.

15
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,740
Than the temple that we will be talking about within this temple.

16
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:23,980
Yes, alright, so mild conference in the Silver Sheridans, or will it be the Magenta Mikes?

17
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:29,920
Oh I think it will be, yeah, this is my excitement level, like in my mind I'm doing an excitement thing,

18
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,760
like what if I was a kid and being a Nickelodeon?

19
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:38,480
Yeah, you've got like an enthusiasm ceiling, that's a lot of kids I think in any public

20
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:43,220
forum, you can just sense, you can see that line that they can't quite make it over, much

21
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:46,920
like some of the obstacles we'll discuss from the show.

22
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,760
Yeah, yeah.

23
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:54,540
Or will it be a special competitor visiting us from the East Coast, you may have seen

24
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:58,660
him on the Late Show with Stephen Colbert, he's got a special out called Bag of Tricks

25
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:04,700
on his YouTube channel, Django Industries, representing the gold golds, it's Django Gold.

26
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:09,840
Yeah, what a perfect name, I could have gone with that in a million years.

27
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,520
I had another one and then I thought, wait a second.

28
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,400
I think you were saying.

29
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,620
There's a color, I was like proudly staring at another one.

30
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,600
No, no, why reinvent the wheel?

31
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:19,940
The color is staring right back at me.

32
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,040
Did you have gold gold first and work backwards?

33
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:28,560
No, I was saying, I had an entire other one and then another color, it was just the Jade

34
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,280
Jankos.

35
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,280
Oh, okay.

36
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,140
I like how that sounds, that's the thing.

37
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:33,320
J with a D, that's not bad.

38
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,560
Yeah, yeah, and you add a D to it.

39
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,160
That's pretty good, I think you can take that one too.

40
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:37,460
These are both good names.

41
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:38,900
You should be able to pick your own name.

42
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,940
Choose your own, only you can choose.

43
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:50,600
We're talking about legends of the Hidden Temple, the seminal Nickelodeon game show

44
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:56,400
from, that ran from 93 to 95, filmed at Universal Studios Florida, Nickelodeon Studios.

45
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,360
Fabulous Universal Studios Florida.

46
00:02:58,660 --> 00:02:59,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

47
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:02,940
The tags on every show just haunted our dreams.

48
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,000
I made like, I must make it to this movie.

49
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,220
I mean, they really were just like giving you like this golden apple in the horizon.

50
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:15,680
Imagine you'll be there where the water runs like, or the slime runs like water, the fountains

51
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,220
and all that stuff.

52
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:18,840
Just dip a cup in, we don't even charge you.

53
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,860
You would never, yeah.

54
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:24,340
The real life Willy Wonka Chocolate Factory of some, like this is a place that only your

55
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,700
dreams could be concocted in.

56
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,940
Did any of you guys ever make it out?

57
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,120
I didn't.

58
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:29,600
No.

59
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:37,200
I took the tour and I watched the fake, there was a fake game show that they would do.

60
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,040
To make it, to give you that flavor.

61
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:41,640
They call it like the lab.

62
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:44,640
Just like this generic game show.

63
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,580
It was like, it's kiddie pool.

64
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,240
Theme park competition.

65
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,680
Pretty much.

66
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,160
And they would, I don't think they could ever do this now, but it's like there were two

67
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,140
sets of bleachers and one were the parents and one were the kids.

68
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,800
And I was like just terrified.

69
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,740
I was not going to find my parents.

70
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,680
Oh man, yeah.

71
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:07,740
Even though that is their main job, reuniting families afterwards.

72
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:10,140
Kids get lost in these theme parks all the time.

73
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,760
I got lost as a kid like at least 10 times.

74
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,260
Me and my sister, we would just get separated so easily.

75
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:20,360
Our parents weren't as worried about it as they would be now for example.

76
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,300
But yeah, I empathize for sure.

77
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:25,000
Although more easily solved now you would think.

78
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:25,920
Yes, that's true.

79
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:26,360
That's true.

80
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:31,120
But did any of those lead to like you had to find adults?

81
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:33,060
You had to, like an announcement had to be made?

82
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:33,380
Oh yeah.

83
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:38,940
We were regular visitors at the White Emergency Tent with the PA.

84
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,400
100%.

85
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:45,360
What would always happen was we'd be at a theme park with our dad for example and he'd

86
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,180
be like, all right, I'm going to go to the bathroom now.

87
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:53,360
You guys wait here for one and a half minutes and like 20 seconds in like, dad's dead.

88
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,560
We got to start moving.

89
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,980
And so we'd move off and that would be that.

90
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,560
This chaos would ensue.

91
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,640
But like this would just happen 100% of the time anytime we'd go anywhere.

92
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,440
We were just totally irresponsible.

93
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:09,040
Did I ever tell the story about, I think I didn't say it when we talked about the Santa

94
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,000
Cruz Beach Boardwalk, but stop me if I did.

95
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:15,640
Where I got lost, I just wandered off at the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk when I was a kid.

96
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,640
Not now as an adult.

97
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,600
Not now as an adult.

98
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,060
No, no, no.

99
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,900
I was just there but I did not get lost.

100
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,460
My child had eyes on me.

101
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:26,300
It's my main memory from being up there that I just wandered off.

102
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:29,000
I was just like dumb and thought I could leave.

103
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:36,820
And meanwhile, my mom was getting some business from like a kind of like a card tricks guy

104
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:37,820
on the pier.

105
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:38,820
A three card Monte table?

106
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:39,080
Maybe.

107
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,740
Oh yes, a three card Monte table.

108
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,700
Yes, before it got converted into a weed table.

109
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,580
And then my mom looked around and I was gone.

110
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:01,160
And she made the leap that this is a distraction that is being used to kidnap me.

111
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:06,040
Like when she put it together, she spit out something that was, I don't know the exact

112
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:09,940
phrasing, but it was something, it was just this like, because it's her movie moment.

113
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:14,720
It was maybe the chance to like, I swear to God if you have my little boy, I will move

114
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,200
heaven and earth to get him back.

115
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:19,180
She did like a Liam Neeson taken speech.

116
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

117
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:20,700
Wow.

118
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:24,560
I don't know that she's specifically referred to a special set of skills because I don't

119
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,820
know if she has one, but she might've said like, but I will, you know how you get super

120
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:32,460
power strength if you, you know, you can lift a car up in an emergency, said, Hey, that's

121
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,380
what's going to happen to me.

122
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:36,460
And I'll throw you into the ocean unless you have information to give me.

123
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,240
Every parent has their child saving fantasy.

124
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:39,680
Yeah.

125
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:43,340
The same way that every guy has their like what I would do in a fight type fantasy.

126
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,360
Every mom and dad is like, I know what I will, you know.

127
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:49,680
Although, well you say that, but like, do you?

128
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,480
I think I'm petrified of this situation coming up.

129
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:54,500
Yeah.

130
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:59,660
You know, I have there's been a couple of times where I've had the thought that like

131
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:03,940
it's not too detailed, but that I would kill to save my child.

132
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:04,800
So I do.

133
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:09,320
You start to like your you have a little fantasy about I don't know, like

134
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:13,140
it's usually like a little more fantastical in my version where like an ogre bursts into

135
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:13,320
the house.

136
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:14,280
Fighting a troll.

137
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,380
Yeah, it's more fun at least in my version, but I still am like imagining killing something

138
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:20,800
to protect my child.

139
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,640
I feel that.

140
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:25,800
But I think my mom had a much more realistic version of this in her mind

141
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:30,000
growing up with things from our world and not like you're in your version.

142
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:34,360
Like you stomp a face in and yellow goo comes out.

143
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:34,720
Yeah, yeah.

144
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,720
That yellow bastard is in the city.

145
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:39,120
It's not you fighting some crystal meth addict.

146
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,520
Just trying to pawn your child.

147
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:46,920
And my mom, my mom was probably like whatever the last dateline she watched, whoever

148
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:51,060
that was on that was probably who she was imagining killing to protect me.

149
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:51,680
Sure, sure.

150
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,220
But I have.

151
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,980
Yeah, that's that has entered my mind.

152
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:58,960
I have specific memories of in the mid later 90s.

153
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:03,920
My family invested in a set of I don't know if this ever come up.

154
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:04,720
Maybe it has.

155
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:10,940
But a thing that caught on right before cell phones was, OK, we have

156
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,180
walkie talkies.

157
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:15,400
Oh, you had little walkie talkies.

158
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,100
Oh, my God.

159
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:19,700
And you would have like a two to eight channels.

160
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:24,280
And it's like, OK, we're going to be on channel number six or seven.

161
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:31,480
And very quickly we learned how many radio channels are occupied by emergency

162
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:36,000
services, beach patrol, Disney security.

163
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:41,960
I turned it on once and got like this is a private channel reserved for Disney

164
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,400
security.

165
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:44,520
Please vacate this channel.

166
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,840
We told you to leave.

167
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,640
Yeah, that seems pretty hackable.

168
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:50,500
They really should have some sort of secure channel for that.

169
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:51,080
Yeah.

170
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,880
So some kid with a radio.

171
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,840
Disney company doesn't have any money or anything.

172
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:56,040
Yeah, yeah, that's true.

173
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,460
I feel like we had those two, but I can't.

174
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:01,120
I'm going to ask some questions when I get I'll ask my parents.

175
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,860
They occasionally worked.

176
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:03,540
Yeah.

177
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,960
But the other thing is, oh, what a nursemaid.

178
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:07,180
Yeah, exactly.

179
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:10,380
We lost a few kids, but the more or less we lost a few kids.

180
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:16,100
The other thing is other families would buy them and we would start hearing other

181
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,760
people on the show.

182
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,620
It's like on a baby monitor.

183
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,920
You can pick up radio or you pick up the neighbors, you know.

184
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,280
And did you sense like any particular peril or like, you know, like, did you feel

185
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:34,480
like you saw too deep through the window of a broken home or something?

186
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,660
No, it's just kids cursing at us.

187
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,940
You didn't develop a relationship with like a trucker or anything like.

188
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,200
No, no.

189
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:44,640
You seem like you've been a CB radio kid.

190
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,280
I you know, it never came up.

191
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:47,460
Huh?

192
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:48,320
All right.

193
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,660
Well, a little past the track.

194
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:50,580
Never too late to start.

195
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,020
Yeah, I'll get you one.

196
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:54,400
Anyway, I just felt bad in pencils.

197
00:09:54,860 --> 00:10:00,220
Situation that the guy who was running a scam on my mom was in that moment he had to

198
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,460
go, no, no, no, I'm not scamming.

199
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,420
I mean, I am.

200
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:04,580
I am.

201
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,060
But it's not a kidnapping.

202
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:09,000
It is a much lighter monetary scam.

203
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,700
It is like a $15 scam.

204
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:12,660
Yes.

205
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,180
Not what's the I don't know.

206
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,400
What's the cost of a child?

207
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,460
What's a child going for?

208
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:17,060
These days?

209
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:17,800
Yeah.

210
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:18,440
50K.

211
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:20,380
Is that then?

212
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:22,060
Now, is it where this is 1994?

213
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:22,900
Right before?

214
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:23,180
Yeah.

215
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:25,500
Would you pay for me in 1994?

216
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:26,900
That's pretty good.

217
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:27,140
All right.

218
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:27,840
And with inflation.

219
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:28,400
That's right.

220
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,800
We're the one who say Tannic movie studios and ask like, what do you guys

221
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,020
sell?

222
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:34,040
What do you sell kids around here?

223
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,540
Legend of the Hidden Temple.

224
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,260
And you brought this to us, Jane.

225
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:43,140
What was calling out to you about this of all strange themed entertainment?

226
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,760
It was a show that I really loved watching as a kid.

227
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,420
And it was also a show that I loved watching as like a stoned college student, because

228
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:53,680
it was always on like the like whatever the throwback channel is.

229
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:59,380
And what really appealed to me about it is that it is so hard.

230
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:04,800
They make these games so impossible for like an 11 year old who's developing their

231
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,780
brand eye coordination, who doesn't quite get logic and like object permanence and all

232
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:09,000
this stuff.

233
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:12,760
They're not quite, you know, their brains aren't at the adult level and

234
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:16,120
they make this game impossible, like so difficult.

235
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:20,220
I sent you that doc with all those like trivia facts and it said like, what, the temple

236
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,620
run completion rate is like 26 percent.

237
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:26,380
That's crazy low for a kids TV show.

238
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:26,640
Right.

239
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,760
Every one of every four episodes.

240
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:30,460
Yeah.

241
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:30,940
Yeah.

242
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:31,380
Yeah.

243
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,420
That's that's pretty nice.

244
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:36,020
Three and four and with failure, which is it just feels like crazy to me.

245
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:36,480
Am I wrong?

246
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:37,620
Like, no, no, no.

247
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:38,700
You would be frustrated.

248
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,980
The only more frustrating game which we've talked about is Nick Arcade.

249
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:42,400
Yes.

250
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:45,500
Which was like kids would never win the final round.

251
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,860
And I remember just driving me so nuts.

252
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:50,700
Well, that was also like kind of like wonky or controls of our talk.

253
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,060
Yeah.

254
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:53,880
This is just like is all physicality.

255
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:54,180
Yeah.

256
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:55,240
It's made impossible.

257
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:56,820
Frustrating to.

258
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:57,160
Yeah.

259
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:59,860
I just was frustrated by it, too, because you wanted kids to win.

260
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:00,380
Absolutely.

261
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:00,860
Yeah.

262
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:04,380
You don't want this kid to be humiliated and like, you know, sad in front of a

263
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,280
national audience.

264
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:06,880
They get no trip to space camp.

265
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:10,020
They get no keyboard or whatever the hell, you know.

266
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:14,120
And you get that you see the list of what they could have and then you watch them

267
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,020
in three minutes later.

268
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,500
Usually watch them be denied.

269
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,440
It's wild, man.

270
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:18,340
It's a show, I guess.

271
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:20,440
It helps you measure your expectations.

272
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:21,380
Maybe as a kid.

273
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:25,780
You know, we were saying we all dreamed of going to Nickelodeon studios as

274
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:29,720
children and then we're watching people get to.

275
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:34,020
But yet they get a dream, but also much of the dream is crushed.

276
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:34,320
Yeah.

277
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,540
So just based on the difficulty of it, that's why I think it's so enthralling

278
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:41,040
because you're watching someone like attempt what seems like the impossible.

279
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,160
So when they do get it, it's like amazing.

280
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,320
It's like genuinely stirring.

281
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,460
I was watching these clips on YouTube and I was like at

282
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:50,740
the edge of my seat watching these kids from like 25 years ago or whatever doing

283
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:50,900
this.

284
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,140
I was like, oh, go, go.

285
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:52,740
No, the monkey.

286
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,180
No, he's got to twist the monkey.

287
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,300
Like I was just like so into it.

288
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,680
That's why I think it's so good about the show.

289
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,600
It really just kind of draws you in just based on how hard it is.

290
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:06,380
I saw a snippet of an interview with Kirk Fox, Kirk Fox, excuse me.

291
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,140
That was the host, right?

292
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:09,080
Yeah, that was his name.

293
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:13,580
It was an interview and he was just like shaking his head at the end of the interview.

294
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:18,420
And he's like, you know, three year basically three years break down to like three

295
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,140
seasons, 93, 94, 95.

296
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:22,700
He's like, like eight teams a year.

297
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:28,440
When learning how this show was made was a true I think I had heard it

298
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:33,920
in passing before, but really just taking a second to figure out how they did it.

299
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:40,140
And like the 12 to 14 hour days and like brutally block shots like the money.

300
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:44,120
Like it all said, it does when you learn anything, it spoils the illusion of like

301
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:50,120
this temple is up there for like a year's time and they're giving kids the ultimate

302
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,860
fantasy of like, no, this is just this temple was up and running for two weeks

303
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:57,460
and then shut down and we're we're on to something else like the deadwood set.

304
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:02,580
I had a question, though, about that when you're talking about the you're watching

305
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:04,420
it stoned in college.

306
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:04,920
Yeah.

307
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:10,540
For me, if I was stoned, then the frustration and the futility of it,

308
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:13,040
I feel like would weigh very heavily on me.

309
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:13,320
Well, it does.

310
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:17,840
Watch it will not succeed and like be trapped in a box like the paranoia.

311
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:21,600
It really is like a bad dream where you're like digging through some hole.

312
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,460
You can't like the doors on opening, the doors on opening and like you're being

313
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:27,680
attacked and grabbed by a temple guard.

314
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,620
Like it's just like it really is like some horror show.

315
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:34,640
I could see myself getting paranoid and sad about for me, mostly just just kind of

316
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:38,920
like it's good, clean, fun, you know, punctuated by just watching sad children.

317
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:44,400
Which in at least a lot of success along the way, it's like devised to, you know,

318
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:46,340
like it weeds out the losers.

319
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,100
It sure does.

320
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:49,280
They all start with so many.

321
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:49,800
Yes.

322
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,380
Kids.

323
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:53,920
Thirty two teams won in the history of the whole thing.

324
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,420
That's out of one hundred and twenty episodes.

325
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,100
You multiply that each team has two kids.

326
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,820
That's sixty four out of one thousand four hundred and forty.

327
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:10,060
That like and that's because it starts with what it's it's

328
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:15,260
six or eight teams doing that opening, like water traversing.

329
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:15,760
Yeah.

330
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:16,180
Yeah.

331
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,160
Always always a situation.

332
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,480
So you and that that weeds a ton out.

333
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,220
Yeah, that's the real eugenics.

334
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:26,500
It's like absolutely like, all right, we don't need any purple ones.

335
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:30,140
Those are like they're like the sperm that don't pretty much really.

336
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:31,260
That's not we're not even at.

337
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:35,080
In a way, Legend of the Hidden Temple is a metaphor for sexual intercourse.

338
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,540
Oh, and that the I wonder if that reflects like the no, no, probably being a sperm is more

339
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,820
futile, but it's all but it's similar.

340
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,920
So you do the temple to fertilize an egg.

341
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,620
Olmec stands in for God,

342
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:52,440
judging you for your sin or your righteous act of procreation.

343
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,500
Olmec is God and the temple is a womb.

344
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,560
Simultaneous simultaneous metaphors.

345
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,200
It's like a Ulysses or something.

346
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,680
It's like a lot of shit's happening.

347
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,420
Really, every text is in there.

348
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:06,200
So you might as well just use this as it's our creation myth.

349
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,480
It's actually Legend of the Hidden Temple.

350
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:10,940
That was one of the episode titles, The Lost Chapter of James

351
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:11,900
Joyce's Ulysses.

352
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:13,720
You'd say I defined it.

353
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,740
I feel like the show Flora's Lava is the only thing I've seen

354
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:20,460
that feels like as ambitious as this.

355
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:22,500
I've never actually watched any.

356
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:27,640
I know that I know that all older kids at parks that I go to are playing.

357
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:28,100
Really?

358
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:31,220
Lava and the yeah, no, that that's like I didn't know kids like that.

359
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,080
It makes sense.

360
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,760
But Flora's Lava is a recent show, right?

361
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:34,120
Yes.

362
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:37,960
I'm just saying I can't think of another like theme, like highly themed.

363
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:38,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

364
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:41,240
Pain in the ass to set up show.

365
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,860
Well, like most extreme.

366
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:44,420
What is that?

367
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,220
Is that what it's called?

368
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,020
What's M.

369
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,760
X.

370
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:46,760
C.?

371
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,020
Most extreme elimination.

372
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:48,980
Yeah, I guess you're right.

373
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,160
Like American Ninja Warrior stuff.

374
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:50,740
That's crazy.

375
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:52,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

376
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:54,860
But it's all American Gladiators, kind of is too, in a sense.

377
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,240
Yeah, but also all kind of like it's like that.

378
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:00,460
Some of them are like pylons and just like industrial equipment.

379
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:04,060
Right here to like have a whole little little world that you enter.

380
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:04,840
But those aren't his theme.

381
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:05,820
You know, I'm going back.

382
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:06,620
Those are that theme.

383
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,700
They're just giant and massive in scale and crazy to set up.

384
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,800
But like Flora's Lava is like cool.

385
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,660
They do set up.

386
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:13,720
It looks cool, I think.

387
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,020
Yeah.

388
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:17,620
And the episodes I've seen early days of pandemic lockdown.

389
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:20,680
Just sitting inside watching Flora's Lava.

390
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:23,480
Yeah, I was like, I don't know if this is helping or hurting,

391
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:26,800
but I think it's making me feel more insane.

392
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:30,160
Not not playing it, though, you're saying you weren't up on your couch.

393
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,300
No, I was not worried about walking around my home.

394
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,140
I was not worried about the dangers of that.

395
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,680
Solo isolated Flora's Lava by yourself.

396
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:40,440
Yeah, it's all we could do.

397
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,660
Hopping back and forth from your refrigerator to your.

398
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:45,740
Somehow switching to Tiger King was healthier.

399
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:51,560
American Gladiators and Indiana Jones or Young Indiana Jones,

400
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,660
I saw as a reference point a lot.

401
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:58,200
Let me say someone whose first job in L.

402
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:58,380
A.

403
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:03,020
was working on the American Gladiators remake, also a pain in the ass to shoot.

404
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:03,680
Sure.

405
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:07,120
You know, you I don't think you've ever said this on the show or to us.

406
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:12,600
Well, I bring it up now because there's a documentary about America.

407
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:13,500
There's two.

408
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:14,360
Oh, wow.

409
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,100
Competing ducks.

410
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:15,820
They are competing.

411
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:20,500
My my friend John, who was my college roommate, John Katz,

412
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:25,640
technically my boss on the show is interviewed in the ESPN plus one.

413
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:29,100
So you can get a real peek behind the scenes.

414
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:32,680
This feels like it always feels to me like not if not your superhero.

415
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,980
Is it your super villain origin story?

416
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,700
I was not a good time.

417
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:42,040
It's definitely surreal of like, ah, another writer's strike is happening.

418
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,860
You know, mm hmm.

419
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:45,840
They didn't try to get you to be a P.

420
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:45,880
A.

421
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:49,680
on the documentaries just to like, you know, no, no, I haven't been.

422
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:50,440
Rhymes.

423
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,000
I haven't been pulled back in.

424
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,120
You know, yeah.

425
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:57,560
Once you once you leave the gladiator lifestyle, it's always calling you back.

426
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:57,920
Right.

427
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:58,680
Yeah.

428
00:18:59,400 --> 00:18:59,400
Yes.

429
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:03,340
Dreams of firing Nerf balls at you from a cannon.

430
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:07,500
I wake up screaming at night thinking I'm still in the Sony soundstage.

431
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:10,300
Like people would imagine themselves being in Saigon.

432
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:10,820
Yeah.

433
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:11,580
All right.

434
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:13,620
Well, that's the P.

435
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:16,580
A.

436
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:16,260
's main duty was testing the cannons and the balls.

437
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:17,320
Yeah.

438
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,380
Run, run.

439
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:20,960
Faster, boy.

440
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,440
What's also the legal liability for these shows?

441
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,220
You wonder when you have children like doing kind of like, yeah,

442
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:29,080
semi dangerous stunts like, all right, so we're going to have a kid

443
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:33,120
try to scale a 20 foot pole while you know,

444
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,440
Temple Guard throws things at him.

445
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:36,160
It'll be fine.

446
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,240
All those parents are in the audience.

447
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:37,520
Right.

448
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,380
I don't know.

449
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:41,880
And I can't tell if this was a particularly dangerous.

450
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,540
I think anything where you have like a sliding thing that you have to climb up,

451
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:46,240
you can easily.

452
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:46,720
Yeah.

453
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:52,840
And anytime there's like human man jumping out at a child in a tight space,

454
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:54,460
like a kid's going to fall and hit the wall.

455
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,080
It's going to like that is a crazy element.

456
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:58,700
That was always like the only scary part of the show.

457
00:19:58,820 --> 00:19:59,020
Yeah.

458
00:19:59,020 --> 00:19:59,720
Holy shit.

459
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:03,060
A man is enveloping that child in his arms

460
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,920
and going to take him back into his little den.

461
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:05,520
Yeah.

462
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:06,400
I couldn't have done it.

463
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:06,920
Of course.

464
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,960
I would have like panicked, I think.

465
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:09,320
Yeah.

466
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:12,280
You know, if you know it's coming because they come out every which way

467
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:15,920
in these in these like secret doors like, you know, yeah, it's traumatic.

468
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:16,860
Yeah, I couldn't.

469
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:17,540
I don't think I could.

470
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:20,340
I wanted to do it and I probably would have agreed to do it,

471
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:24,080
but I probably would have just frozen and then the episode would not have aired.

472
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,840
It's a miracle that any of these kids got through that temple in one piece.

473
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:27,340
Yeah.

474
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,420
Yeah, it really is.

475
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,360
Even without that, even if you remove that component and I'd be less

476
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:36,460
afraid of kind of the the magical elements and the like swinging on the pit

477
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:41,040
or getting lost in the, you know, in the whatever the packing peanuts down there,

478
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:44,440
then just like a ladder, the hidden stairs.

479
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:48,080
Yeah, those I feel like are the biggest that you're you're nervous

480
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,600
and people are yelling.

481
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:50,080
Yeah.

482
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,340
Is appointed like imagine how much anxiety you get now

483
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:55,120
when you're trying to do some complicated task and people are watching

484
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,660
and you don't have like a hundred people screaming at you

485
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:00,080
and knowing all your school friends are watching on TV.

486
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,460
Yeah, it's a lot.

487
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:01,920
Oh, yes.

488
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,880
And if you mess up, you will be made.

489
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:04,620
Everyone will.

490
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:08,680
When you mess up, you'll have kids on the playground like, hey, dumbass,

491
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:11,580
you got you got to go to the top door.

492
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:12,300
Hello.

493
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,880
It's obvious from a third party perspective.

494
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:18,240
You try to put the monkey's idol head in where its ass should go.

495
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:18,720
Yeah.

496
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,500
Doing you fucking idiot.

497
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:24,340
That is apparently one of the most troublesome elements.

498
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,500
Like, oh, that's what I mean.

499
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,180
Not the monkey.

500
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,780
Yeah, the kids never could do the monkeys.

501
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:32,940
There is a there's a YouTube channel called Peeled Eyes

502
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:36,880
that has some compilation videos and they're like, here's the best temple runs

503
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,220
and here's the worst temple runs and best or worst.

504
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,500
Everyone's having trouble with that monkey.

505
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,100
I don't know.

506
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:43,280
Yeah.

507
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:47,260
I feel like they made it too big and they made the podium for it too tall.

508
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:50,920
So the kids are constantly reaching up past their eyeline.

509
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,740
Yeah, it's just really you got to have had a growth spurt.

510
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,540
The deck is just totally stacked against all these poor little kids.

511
00:21:56,620 --> 00:22:00,800
This is yeah, that is the because it definitely became a real thing.

512
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,500
The difficulty of the of the silver monkey.

513
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:09,900
And I've seen that defense now that like they have to get pieces off of tall shelves

514
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:13,100
and that when they're doing so, first of all, that it probably just tumbles

515
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,320
out of their hands.

516
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:14,600
Yeah.

517
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,700
And that's where they're starting.

518
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:19,780
And that which then like obfuscates, it's like in shadow.

519
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,400
Which piece is this?

520
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:23,380
It's not iconic to them.

521
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,900
They probably especially the first ones.

522
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:26,500
Yeah, the first one.

523
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,680
No point in reference.

524
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,140
They're all taped in like three days.

525
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:29,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

526
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:35,440
And we know we all are thinking we could do this easily because we have it.

527
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,020
And we watch this all the time.

528
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:41,260
But if you were the first astronauts into the capsule, you definitely don't know.

529
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,700
But you like, yeah, yeah.

530
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:45,320
If you if you don't if you can't make out the basic shape of it

531
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:49,160
and then you have to stack it in the right way, it is I think like some forgiveness

532
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,000
needs to be shown to these.

533
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:51,640
Yeah.

534
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:55,800
They should have gotten three tokens to save them from the temple guards.

535
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:56,700
That's what I say.

536
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:57,760
Oh, yeah.

537
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,380
Yeah.

538
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:01,240
Do you think it was maybe it was kept low

539
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,660
because there were not a lot of temple guards?

540
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,940
I feel like there were a lot of temple guards.

541
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:09,400
I remember seeing many episodes in which both kids would get blanked out by temple guards.

542
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,740
It feels like a higher probability than like a whammy.

543
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,920
Yeah, definitely more traumatic.

544
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:18,400
Yeah, that's true.

545
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,180
Yeah, yeah.

546
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:24,700
I mean, you didn't feel the drama of when like a whammy walks out

547
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:27,520
and then like four others and they're doing a conga line.

548
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,680
There should be more game shows, though, where a guy just pops out

549
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,140
and drags a contestant away.

550
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,960
Like a real fortune, for example.

551
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:41,400
Yeah, like you get like a consonant wrong and then you just get dragged into a dark room.

552
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:41,860
Yeah.

553
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:45,500
I mean, it's really only the and I don't know if you'd call this a game show

554
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:48,780
besides this element, but it's really only showtime at the Apollo.

555
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,940
Oh, with the Sandman.

556
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,840
Yeah, it's the only other.

557
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,560
But he doesn't physically grab you.

558
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:55,840
That's the difference, I think.

559
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:56,820
Oh, yeah, true.

560
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:57,140
Yeah.

561
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,220
If Sandman was just enveloping you with his huge feathered arms,

562
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,800
that would change the vibe.

563
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:02,320
Yeah, true.

564
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,580
Or if his if his famous broom

565
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:07,500
in which which he whisks the contestants away.

566
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:12,060
Well, if he's if that is much, much bigger and you actually get caught

567
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:14,980
and the bristles sure ground up a little bit.

568
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:15,340
Yeah.

569
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:19,020
Well, I you know, we talked about on the show that we were all scared

570
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,400
by temple guards before.

571
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:25,240
But I think I neglected to think about the thing that was most scary,

572
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:29,540
which is the room with trees that you have to reach into.

573
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:34,000
And one of those trees could be possessed by the spirit of a temple guard.

574
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:34,360
Yeah.

575
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,400
Fucking kidding me.

576
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:39,500
And the tree grabbing you, it seems 10 times worse.

577
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:40,100
Yeah.

578
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:42,740
And there's this moment of tension before the kid reaches in.

579
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:44,860
Where it's like, is this tree going to be OK?

580
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:49,380
And they put their hand like, ah, you know, it's like a really, really traumatizing.

581
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:53,340
This is we did an entire episode about scary trees

582
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:56,580
that scare me specifically.

583
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,580
And I don't think this even came up.

584
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:58,780
Yeah, it didn't.

585
00:24:59,200 --> 00:24:59,280
Oh, wow.

586
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,960
I actually maybe this was the fuel.

587
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:01,820
Suppressed memory.

588
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:02,280
Yeah.

589
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:02,500
Yeah.

590
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,500
So this is really separate.

591
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:07,620
There was I watched a few episodes and it wasn't until a latter day

592
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:11,340
one where the presence of the trees made themselves known.

593
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:13,700
And I just like, oh, you're kidding.

594
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:15,640
I don't think the kids made it there.

595
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:16,720
Thank God.

596
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,780
And like they got eliminated before.

597
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:21,200
I'm just picturing these temple guards like coming like, you know,

598
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,280
after the taping with a kid in the family going back to the hotel room.

599
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:27,500
Temple guards jumps out of the adjacent hotel room and grabs the kid

600
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:30,240
and brings them out that extra door that hotel room.

601
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:31,060
Yeah.

602
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:31,440
Yeah.

603
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,780
The balcony ways in bed after the after the night.

604
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:37,660
Temple guard comes out from under the bed and drags him down to hell.

605
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,480
Mini fridge.

606
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:41,340
Yeah.

607
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,800
It's a false mini fridge.

608
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:44,280
There's room for a guy in there.

609
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:47,140
I'm being taken by a non-union actor.

610
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:50,820
This is a temple guard, by the way, the most non-union.

611
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,660
Well, I was actually thinking about this.

612
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:55,100
I was wondering if they might be like stagehands or something,

613
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:57,880
because there's no way there's like a full time temple guard position.

614
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,260
I have a little insight into this.

615
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:01,140
I read an interview.

616
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,040
There was an AV club interview with is it Scott Stone?

617
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:08,300
I think one of the creators and he a recurring segment,

618
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:12,700
if a recurring theme rather, if you can believe it, is the cheapness of the show.

619
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:15,520
And one detail, it wasn't even something he was like,

620
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,300
it was just in the middle of something he was saying,

621
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,680
that the whole show was really cheap.

622
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,460
Everybody in the show had a million jobs.

623
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:26,280
My cousin Jed was a was the writer, applying one single writer.

624
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:30,560
And he was also one of the temple guards and also in half of the legends

625
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,860
themselves dressed up in costumes.

626
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,940
So there was no money.

627
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,400
So which was well, again, we should maybe like step through an episode or something.

628
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,360
That might be a good way to do it.

629
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,820
But like we've neglected that.

630
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:45,300
There's this minor educational element of every episode, which is like

631
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:48,280
it teaches you about Christopher Columbus's spear or whatever like that.

632
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:48,940
Yes.

633
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:49,320
Yeah.

634
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:49,520
Yeah.

635
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:53,180
Like they are the magic spinning top of Ponce de Leon.

636
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,040
Yeah.

637
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:57,220
Where you kind of start to suspect like, wait a minute.

638
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:02,640
I don't think every historical figure had an item as an object has a totem.

639
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:03,760
Yeah.

640
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:06,620
Find Harriet Tubman's walking stick.

641
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,780
It was on that.

642
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:11,660
I'm like, oh, I don't know about that.

643
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:15,280
Maybe possibly a lot of very metaphorical.

644
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,180
Objects.

645
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:16,460
Yeah.

646
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,840
Not necessarily historically accurate.

647
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:21,900
If you had to, that just does just make me think like there are objects

648
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:24,740
associated like with Trump, for example.

649
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:25,120
Oh, yeah.

650
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:28,180
But if you are right, it's it's a hundred years from now.

651
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,980
And Trump only gets one object.

652
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:31,440
What's the I know what it is.

653
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,260
What is the Diet Coke button?

654
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:34,940
Oh, very good.

655
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:36,400
The button you would hit to get a new diet.

656
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,020
That's pretty good.

657
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:37,840
I was going to say the hat.

658
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:39,400
But the whole way.

659
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:39,760
Sure.

660
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:40,260
The hat.

661
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:40,980
Yeah.

662
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:42,400
Donald Trump's hutch.

663
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,060
More iconic, I suppose.

664
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:44,500
Yeah.

665
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,920
But in my heart, it's the Diet Coke.

666
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:46,940
No, I think that's a good one.

667
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:47,500
It's pretty good.

668
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,240
I mean, I flashed it could have been the orb.

669
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:51,120
I remember when he told me it was fine.

670
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:51,760
The orb is good.

671
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:54,800
Let's let's just like step through how this worked a little bit.

672
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:58,980
And I think some like some anecdotes will spill out along the way.

673
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:04,820
But like basic premise is kids are doing feats of strength and little

674
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:09,380
getting feats of knowledge or at least like memorization

675
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:14,580
that eventually lead them to a trip through Olmec's temple,

676
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:21,100
an ancient stone head god who co-hosts and narrates the show as well.

677
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:24,120
It all culminates in a big run through the temple where you must.

678
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:28,060
You learn early in the show about one of these magical,

679
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,280
definitely real historical objects.

680
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:34,460
And then you get the chance to go, I mean, like pillage the temple.

681
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:35,180
Oh, yeah.

682
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:37,120
It is like a point robbing.

683
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:37,600
I didn't consider this.

684
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:38,400
Essentially

685
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:40,580
to try to then colonial.

686
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,700
Yeah, the guards are protecting their shit.

687
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:43,620
That's true.

688
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:44,020
Yeah.

689
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,160
The guards are the good guys.

690
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:45,580
Yeah.

691
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,860
The children are the bad guys.

692
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:47,140
Right.

693
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,400
You really should be rooting for them.

694
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:49,960
I don't know.

695
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,820
And like, oh, I don't discount that the children are the bad guys.

696
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:53,740
That's definitely true.

697
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:56,500
But they are also like pawns in a way.

698
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:59,800
They're kind of like to go to get into another tomb,

699
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:02,400
the or the you know, the Cave of Wonders in Aladdin.

700
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:02,960
Yes.

701
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:06,960
But it's really it's Jafar using the kid Aladdin.

702
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:07,440
Yes.

703
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,460
I guess who's Jafar in this?

704
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:11,400
Kirk Fogg.

705
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,040
Kirk Fogg.

706
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:12,600
Yeah.

707
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,300
The malevolent Kirk Fogg.

708
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:17,820
Puppet Master working for the East India Trading Company,

709
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,780
sending these kids to pillage, you know, beloved ruins.

710
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,380
Well, they're going to think it's fun to them.

711
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:25,460
It's a fun little child.

712
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:29,100
But within we get all the but we they trade in these like

713
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,780
artifacts worth millions of dollars.

714
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:33,760
And we convince them, you know, they just want like bikes and

715
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,320
pocket calculators and that will about, you know, that'll satisfy them.

716
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,180
And then we keep the profits.

717
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:41,440
It's kind of like the Chipmunks movie from the 80s.

718
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:42,580
Oh, that's right.

719
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:43,460
That's one of those.

720
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:43,620
Yeah.

721
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:44,380
They're like smuggling.

722
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:47,340
They're having the chipmunks and chipmunks smuggle like diamonds and cash

723
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:48,640
for the bad guys.

724
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:51,100
And they don't realize what pawns they are.

725
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:51,460
Right.

726
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,020
Uh huh.

727
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,040
Isn't this all of it?

728
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:56,040
Isn't this like the writers, everybody?

729
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,060
Aren't we all just serving the profit of some billionaire masters?

730
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:00,640
That's correct.

731
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,120
The Archfiend, Kirk Fogg.

732
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:02,780
Yeah.

733
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:03,000
Yeah.

734
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,640
He's a it all goes to Kirk.

735
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:08,740
Yeah, he ultimately he's like the Soros figure.

736
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:12,320
He just running town.

737
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,180
Your conspiracy theory.

738
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:14,560
Yeah.

739
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:17,420
Kirk Fogg has his hands a lot in a lot of pies.

740
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:18,420
Yeah.

741
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:22,120
He's been suspiciously present in a lot of calamities throughout the world.

742
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:22,400
Yeah.

743
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:24,720
You know, there's a way to go massacre.

744
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:29,080
If you look at the back of the video in 2019 of Kirk Fogg saying

745
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:31,060
there's going to be a pandemic in 2020.

746
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:33,980
You know, Kirk Fogg lab leak theory.

747
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,060
Yeah.

748
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,560
It all goes back to Kirk Fogg.

749
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,160
He took the monkey.

750
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:45,340
He took the silver monkey and used it to smash the sealed windows at the lab.

751
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,960
Oh, yeah.

752
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:47,760
He cracked it.

753
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,580
Makes perfect sense.

754
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:50,840
Makes perfect sense.

755
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:52,960
All adds up around the globe.

756
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:56,680
And he does a little repelling repels in.

757
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:57,500
Yes.

758
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,160
God, you're right.

759
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:58,600
He does.

760
00:30:58,760 --> 00:30:59,020
I forgot.

761
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:01,900
Well, you know, he didn't at the beginning because I watched an early one

762
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:05,820
and he just he's introduced and then he just he just shows up calmly,

763
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:06,700
walks down the stairs.

764
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:11,500
So then what a shock it was to leap forward and he swings in on a rope

765
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:14,940
and the camera kind of like turns around him perfectly.

766
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:16,700
A hell of an inch.

767
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:19,620
I mean, like this guy must have been feeling himself.

768
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,480
There's a slight budget increase.

769
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:24,520
Season two and three went to carabiners and rope.

770
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:28,700
And they're like, well, we got Kirk doing this exciting entrance.

771
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:33,460
So we can't we can't get the kids top pizza with toppings on it

772
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:35,060
while they sit in the break room.

773
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,680
Yeah, that's good.

774
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,400
It's all she it's all she's made.

775
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:40,040
Kirk's vlog is coming on jetpack.

776
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:43,440
And these kids are like receiving like $15 of Hasbro merchandise.

777
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,400
Hey, he's the one who's got to pump them up.

778
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:48,420
But they got to do it.

779
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:49,360
That's true.

780
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:54,100
Olmec positive feelings about Olmec growing up.

781
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:59,120
We do we all like the wish we could have seen him be operated in person.

782
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,420
I loved Olmec.

783
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:07,540
Olmec was a really weird discovery that D Baker, the voice of Olmec.

784
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:12,260
I mean, it has a huge filmography like TV and film.

785
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:14,300
Voice actor extraordinaire.

786
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:20,580
The oddest one was discovering that he is Klaus the fish on American Dad.

787
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:22,300
Oh, well, I didn't know that.

788
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:22,780
Yeah.

789
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,900
The world of voice acting is relatively small.

790
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,500
It's only like 100 people in total.

791
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:27,480
Yeah, it is true.

792
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:27,980
Yeah.

793
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:28,300
Yeah.

794
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:28,460
Yeah.

795
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,620
It's always the same.

796
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:30,040
Yeah.

797
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,060
Nice and nice and fat off these roles.

798
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:35,900
If you get in there, you're in there for good, which I think he did launch his.

799
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:42,960
I think he was a purely Orlando actor who like this kicked off the whole thing for him.

800
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,320
And he's one of the primary guys for that.

801
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:49,580
He was doing Orlando productions of King Lear and so forth like that.

802
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:52,140
I think I think that's genuinely true.

803
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,000
I do think that's the thing.

804
00:32:54,260 --> 00:33:02,060
And also Epcot thought he was in the something called the Anacomical players in a.

805
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:05,820
There was like an area in Disney World themed after the human body.

806
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:09,260
Basically, I don't know one second of what I like.

807
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:13,720
I have the like some ghostly remnant in my brain, the phrase Anacomical players,

808
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,440
but I could not tell you what that comprised.

809
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:23,340
It seems like a tough thing for improv to, you know, you want like any topic in the world

810
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:25,360
to be on the table for you.

811
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:28,100
You ask the audience for a word and you could take it anywhere.

812
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:32,880
So to limit it to to take 99.

813
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,740
9 percent of topics off the table for your improv.

814
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:37,900
I got stomach again.

815
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:38,520
Nice.

816
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:38,820
Nice.

817
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:39,520
We got bladder.

818
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:40,180
Yeah.

819
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:40,720
Yeah.

820
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:41,660
Somebody said penis.

821
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:43,200
I got to pretend we didn't hear it.

822
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,160
Yeah.

823
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:48,210
Would you ram bunctious children name any body part you can think of?

824
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,900
Yeah, that doesn't sound like it's going to go wrong.

825
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:54,840
That had to be in the wonders of life pavilion.

826
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:55,400
I'm assuming.

827
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,170
Yes, that was at least it was air conditioned, you know.

828
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:01,520
That's the improv outside in the Orlando.

829
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,280
That sounds like you're dressed like a spleen.

830
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:05,280
Yeah.

831
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:11,480
Again, you're a kid and you imagine that this is the infinite budget

832
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:14,860
and that the people doing it have made it and are set for life.

833
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:20,480
And just the, you know, the glamour in which the show is made to then discover

834
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:24,960
that, first of all, that Olmec is I think I was picturing like it's the ninja.

835
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:27,600
It must be the ninja turtle technology.

836
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,860
And by that, I mean, oh, yeah, a little puppet that is like attached

837
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:36,160
via airwaves to a suit and that like that's how it's syncing up.

838
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:36,220
Right.

839
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,840
The same radio waves that Jason used with his old with the shitty

840
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,960
with the crappy walkie talkie.

841
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:42,320
Yeah, yeah.

842
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,960
Shopping network walkie talkie.

843
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:46,740
And as long as like legends of the hidden temple is on,

844
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:49,000
that's committed on Channel seven.

845
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:49,660
Nobody else.

846
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:50,380
Nothing else.

847
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:50,900
Yeah.

848
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:53,200
Make sure no kids in this park use Channel seven.

849
00:34:55,180 --> 00:35:00,660
That's the ambulance driver nurse line for like the kid who eats it

850
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:03,080
and on the swing in the temple.

851
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:07,660
So then you suddenly hear a nurse's voice coming out of a line

852
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:09,400
and nurses voices coming out of Olmec.

853
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,500
We lost another one.

854
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:11,980
We lost another one.

855
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:13,500
Sorry, I was asleep.

856
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:15,540
I've been here for 10 hours.

857
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:19,100
But instead, no, this was the actor.

858
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:23,220
D Baker is like down at the bottom of Olmec.

859
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:27,380
He's got a two by four attached to the bottom lip, which is the only part.

860
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:28,980
He's doing it himself.

861
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:29,440
Yeah.

862
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:32,680
So he's just like moving a piece of wood for it.

863
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:36,560
He has his foot on two by four, moving the jaw or his hand.

864
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:37,860
I think I think it's hand controlled.

865
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Maybe I can't.

866
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,100
Well, what I can't picture is if he's like, is he does he get a chair

867
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:47,240
or is he curled into a ball so as to be able to give him a chair?

868
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,880
He negotiated in season two.

869
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:49,660
Yeah.

870
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,200
And they gave him a child's chair.

871
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:52,520
Right.

872
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:53,560
Or he does this.

873
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,720
That's the budget increase.

874
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,480
Man, I wonder where that head is right now.

875
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:01,260
I yeah, I'm not sure what I want to give to have that in my possession.

876
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,280
Yeah, really.

877
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:04,880
Is there is there like a Nickelodeon vault?

878
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:07,860
Like because there's I there's like a dub.

879
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:10,260
If you're a wrestling fan, there's like in Stamford, Connecticut,

880
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:10,880
there's a W.

881
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:14,220
E.

882
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,060
W.

883
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:14,220
vault that has like the famous cages from certain matches.

884
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:15,560
And it has costumes.

885
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:16,060
Yeah.

886
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:16,720
A vault.

887
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,640
They have like a big warehouse type thing that has all this stuff

888
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:22,920
from the history of the company of the of the evil company.

889
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:26,180
And even the bad stuff.

890
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:28,340
Do they need to start a fire in there?

891
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,720
They probably should in certain parts of it.

892
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:33,000
But like Little Corners.

893
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,640
Yeah, I wonder if Nickelodeon history.

894
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,900
I wonder if there's got it's got to be somewhere.

895
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,920
There might be an Orlando based, you know, repository warehouse.

896
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:42,500
Yeah, I was like, what's his name?

897
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:46,840
The the show was pizza guy has a big warehouse full of shit.

898
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:48,320
I can never.

899
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:48,740
Oh, yeah.

900
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:49,580
Aaron Aaron.

901
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:50,300
Yes.

902
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:50,880
Uh huh.

903
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:54,680
So like there's got to be a bunch of weird warehouses in Orlando,

904
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,380
is what I'm saying.

905
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:56,540
Possibly.

906
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,960
Or it was all or like they assumed nobody would.

907
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:04,320
It's not like people are going to get fixated on this for decades and decades.

908
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,860
Potentially spend.

909
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:08,400
You have four adult men

910
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,940
this passionately disgusted discussing the

911
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:17,120
mechanisms of how a child's game show head work.

912
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:17,560
Yeah.

913
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:18,180
Yeah.

914
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:18,820
Forget Olmec.

915
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:20,800
I'll I'll settle for the two by four.

916
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,020
I want to get to D Baker's to buy.

917
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:26,180
So that could be that could be one of the artifacts in like the reboot.

918
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,700
D Baker's to buy for

919
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:33,320
the extra splintery to buy for the friendly.

920
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,000
D Baker.

921
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:38,660
But yeah, so that's that's pretty lo fi.

922
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:41,900
And then they start the basically they set it up.

923
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:42,980
Let's test it.

924
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:43,820
It looked bad.

925
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:44,780
It wasn't enough.

926
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:47,380
And they realized they needed one more element.

927
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:49,280
And they thought, what if we made the eyes glow?

928
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,180
Maybe that will step it up somehow.

929
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:57,280
But again, you know, he's already D Baker's already moving wood back and forth.

930
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:59,820
I don't think he can like flick another thing.

931
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:00,900
He's not a puppeteer.

932
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:01,380
So right.

933
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:02,860
One man banned things.

934
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:06,600
So that's like a bellows and like symbols on his knees.

935
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:07,600
Between his knees.

936
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:08,620
Yeah.

937
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:10,700
Can we attach something to his blinks?

938
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:11,520
Can we control?

939
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:14,180
Now, Olmec, how would you like to favor us with a song?

940
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:18,720
And you know, no, quite plainly, Morgan.

941
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,620
Not today, please.

942
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:21,760
Yeah.

943
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,460
So they're scouring for what's the solution there.

944
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:29,620
And they go to a radio shack that has a disco ball

945
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:31,900
that is voice activated.

946
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:37,240
And they just like they dig the mechanism out of that, put it in the eyes,

947
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:39,140
just like solder it them.

948
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,220
And again, this is the creators of the show.

949
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:41,620
Yeah.

950
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:44,340
Just like Jerry rigging this up to the end.

951
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,200
That ended up being enough and this works well enough.

952
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,760
That's American community right there.

953
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:49,440
Yeah.

954
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:49,740
Yeah.

955
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:53,120
We're all, you know, you know, in in in strike era,

956
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,020
we're all talking about low staffs and you're like this thing.

957
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:59,600
I think there were I think there were four forget writing staff.

958
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:03,860
There were four people behind the scenes of this show in general.

959
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:04,840
Yeah.

960
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:07,180
No one worked on this.

961
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:12,340
The fewest amount like, OK, can the temple guard, can we give the temple guards,

962
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:16,180
can we space out the runs enough that the temple guards can also go

963
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:17,920
get the pizzas and come back?

964
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:22,140
It's yeah, this is crazy, though, because like, I guess Guts is probably

965
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:25,940
technically a more dangerous show for kids because you got kids on bungees

966
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:29,380
jumping off five, ten feet like platforms.

967
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,440
But still, it feels like all these shows are like so understaffed.

968
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:35,780
I am surprised there was not more kid injuries.

969
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:40,460
And this is also in the air before like crazy private equity optimization.

970
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,200
So it's kind of surprising they weren't willing to show a little more money

971
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:46,440
on a show like, you know, cost very little to make.

972
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,480
And they turn them out.

973
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,680
I'm just amazed that they were so cheap on this.

974
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:55,360
I think Florida is not the most in the 90s,

975
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,420
maybe not the most safety focused.

976
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,200
Sure.

977
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:02,020
Occupational states are really not the friendliest to a lot of the unions

978
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:03,660
ever in general.

979
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,520
Like Florida was dangerous.

980
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:10,560
The Temple Guard Union was broken up immediately by Pinkerton's, the TGA

981
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:14,400
support the TGA was wild and crazy kids.

982
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,500
Orlando as well.

983
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,720
What was I think that was all over?

984
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:20,160
I think I was like on a farm somewhere.

985
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:22,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

986
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,000
Really nondescript locations.

987
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,180
Was that like in Ventura or something?

988
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:28,040
Yeah, I think it was around here sometimes.

989
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,660
They found the raging waters.

990
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:32,060
I feel like I recognize a park sometimes.

991
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:32,420
Right.

992
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:33,460
And yet wonder why.

993
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:37,900
Why aren't they asking me the coolest kid in the San Fernando Valley?

994
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:40,900
I'm the best kid here.

995
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:41,600
Why didn't they?

996
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:44,260
Are my parents not getting the word out about me enough?

997
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:46,360
The Valley's top kid that was

998
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:49,400
three years running.

999
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,480
That was the thing about legend.

1000
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:52,320
The hidden temple.

1001
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,520
A lot of the kids.

1002
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:58,660
Were from the Orlando area and it was like ages 11 through 14.

1003
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:01,780
But then it would take so long to get around the chute.

1004
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:05,300
Sometimes those kids were like 15 doing that show.

1005
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:07,560
You know, some kids with a little gross little mustache.

1006
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:12,860
Just just dominating Robin Hood's maze or whatever.

1007
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:17,860
So now this one kid is really tall, but isn't very coordinated.

1008
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,360
He's trying hard.

1009
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,760
Got to impress his girlfriend.

1010
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,160
It's going to impress his kids.

1011
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:28,500
Yeah, his girlfriend drove him here.

1012
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:31,320
She is 16 and has a car.

1013
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:37,800
This was a misperception I also had about these shows a lot that the

1014
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:43,920
could you guys tell this at the time that like that the kids never seem like they

1015
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:46,960
know each other or have any chemistry?

1016
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:48,640
Yeah, I think they get randomly paired up.

1017
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:49,380
I think so.

1018
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:49,740
Yeah.

1019
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:54,060
Because the connection is they aren't looking each other in the eye,

1020
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:56,480
especially if it's boy, girl, their their nerves.

1021
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,120
They just even be I'm next to a girl on television.

1022
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:01,340
You feel that's tougher than the temple.

1023
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:04,900
There's a lot of missed high fives, I feel like.

1024
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:05,300
Yeah.

1025
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:06,840
You don't sense that the camaraderie.

1026
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:09,160
That doesn't help the success rate either.

1027
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:12,220
Well, you're just paired up some random feels like your childhood buddy.

1028
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:13,640
I bet you'd do better at it.

1029
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:14,460
I think so.

1030
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:15,120
Yeah.

1031
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:18,160
There'd be some trust there, I think.

1032
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:21,980
But instead, yeah, you could tell that it's

1033
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:24,860
they probably had not met before that day.

1034
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,640
And yet this is all right.

1035
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:29,240
This is some mental gymnastics I did when I was a kid.

1036
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:31,140
It was all right.

1037
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:35,880
The prize, the big prize at the end is probably a trip that we know.

1038
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:36,880
There was space camp.

1039
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:38,000
There would be space camp.

1040
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:39,700
But that's like a group, right?

1041
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:43,700
Sometimes it's like in one that I watched, it's like you're going to the holiday

1042
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:45,140
in in Mexico City.

1043
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:49,480
And I feel like I would think,

1044
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:52,420
but it doesn't seem like these people know each other very well.

1045
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:53,880
Now they have to take a trip together.

1046
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:54,580
That's amazing.

1047
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,640
I wonder if they sent them together, if they gave them.

1048
00:42:57,140 --> 00:42:58,560
Basically, we've been told about the budget.

1049
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:01,320
Imagine they probably had both families, one hotel room.

1050
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:02,540
Possibly.

1051
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:02,980
Yes.

1052
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:04,460
Yeah, maybe just just for.

1053
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:05,480
It's a suite.

1054
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,220
Have a suite size.

1055
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:11,020
You can rock, paper, scissor for couch.

1056
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:12,780
There's a big sectional.

1057
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:15,100
Can sleep on the long part of it.

1058
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:15,520
Yeah.

1059
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:19,240
Nice bonding, actually, for a family to sleep in one triangle together.

1060
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:20,660
One year.

1061
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:23,260
You guys love adventure.

1062
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:23,960
Come on.

1063
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:26,040
Yeah, this is part of the adventure.

1064
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:30,660
The adventure continues using using the dinner voucher for Denny's

1065
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:31,960
with some random family.

1066
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:34,740
Yes, you do all have to split this.

1067
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:36,320
Oh, you brought other kids.

1068
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:36,800
Sorry.

1069
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:38,600
That was the winning.

1070
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:40,460
Meant to be a six way split.

1071
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:43,560
That trip costs under four hundred dollars, right?

1072
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:44,740
That they're giving people.

1073
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:45,260
Yeah.

1074
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:45,840
After you.

1075
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:48,640
Well, I mean, the holiday in felt kind of.

1076
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:49,740
Yeah, unless it's a night.

1077
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:52,040
Sometimes you get a nicer holiday in.

1078
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:52,420
Sure.

1079
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:53,060
Sometimes.

1080
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:55,440
There's a lot of variance in that particular brand.

1081
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:55,820
Yeah.

1082
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,220
Also, back in the 90s, we didn't maybe I didn't as a child.

1083
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:02,000
I feel like there was still like this illusion that hotels were like

1084
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,640
of that nature, were like kind of like fancy in a way.

1085
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:04,960
Yeah.

1086
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:06,400
Oh, the best Western.

1087
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:10,460
And that was as an adult, you know, it's like, you know, you know, it's a flea bag.

1088
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:11,740
But back then you might you might be.

1089
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:12,540
Oh, has a swimming pool.

1090
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:13,640
It's a nice hotel, you know.

1091
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:14,620
Uh huh.

1092
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:14,640
Right.

1093
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:15,920
It's the right photo.

1094
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:18,480
And yeah, when you when you don't know any better, we're doing it

1095
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:19,780
just that it is a hotel.

1096
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:20,200
Yeah.

1097
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:21,500
It's not my house.

1098
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:22,380
Take me there.

1099
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:26,940
I learned this number seven or eight years ago or so.

1100
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:28,380
I missed a flight at L.

1101
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:28,780
X.

1102
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:28,780
A.

1103
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:32,640
And they're like, well, give you a voucher for really cheap hotel room.

1104
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:34,780
Do you want to go to this Hyatt

1105
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:39,000
that costs like 40 more dollars?

1106
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:40,920
Or do you want to go to Armada in?

1107
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:43,780
And I didn't I was like, oh, the money.

1108
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:45,760
Ramada's are usually nice, right?

1109
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:46,840
No.

1110
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:50,260
Immediately placed in a room next to a conference room

1111
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:55,740
that was having the loudest revival church service you've ever seen.

1112
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:58,220
And had to go back down and go like, hey, can you

1113
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:00,580
can we have another room?

1114
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:02,960
There's a church revival still going there.

1115
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:05,220
What time was that still going on?

1116
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:07,480
It was like nine thirty at night.

1117
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:07,900
Really?

1118
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:08,220
Wow.

1119
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:08,740
Yeah.

1120
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:11,700
And it was just like you should have gone in there, though.

1121
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,380
I I don't know why I didn't just take a lift back to Los Angeles.

1122
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:17,220
I don't know why you didn't just get born again.

1123
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:19,980
Yeah, that could have been your lucky break.

1124
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:20,940
You'd be in heaven right now.

1125
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:21,460
Yeah.

1126
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:24,460
And if and if everywhere is perfect, then it doesn't matter

1127
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:25,920
how bad the hotel room is.

1128
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:27,940
You were the El Segundo.

1129
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:29,440
God's what?

1130
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:32,460
What what I think, yeah, because I would always

1131
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:35,860
you would sense the lack of chemistry, but like Double Dare was families.

1132
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:39,720
So you would end up rooting for just whatever family you thought you liked better.

1133
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:45,600
But they did like a smart medieval times type thing here with branding each team.

1134
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:49,140
So it's more like you were rooting for your sports team every episode

1135
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:51,620
versus you cared at all about the kids themselves.

1136
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:52,660
That's a good point.

1137
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:56,380
And really, I mean, maybe are you like

1138
00:45:57,160 --> 00:46:00,220
two questions and anyone answer, did you have favorites?

1139
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:04,820
And was the favorite more based on the color or the animal color?

1140
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:05,460
Color.

1141
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:06,360
I'd say so.

1142
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:07,780
It's the it's the more prominent.

1143
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:10,600
Yeah, the animals are a little harder to make out.

1144
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:12,020
They're a little abstract.

1145
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:12,460
Right.

1146
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:14,600
There's some real cocoa pellies.

1147
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:16,200
Yeah, just six cocoa.

1148
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:22,600
Yeah, the red cocoa, the blue cocoa belly.

1149
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:28,440
His drawings all made by Kirk Fogg's brother.

1150
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,180
He's an artist in New Mexico.

1151
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:31,740
Yeah.

1152
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:33,180
Do you feel that way, though?

1153
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,320
Did you feel like and did you have a favorite?

1154
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:36,280
I can't remember.

1155
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:39,740
I would assume based on my values as a kid is probably the silver snakes,

1156
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:41,360
as was every boy's I imagine.

1157
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:42,960
But who knows?

1158
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:45,200
Just due to snake being the like snake.

1159
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:47,520
And so silver is cool, you know.

1160
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:48,220
Sure, sure.

1161
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:49,800
But I also don't remember to be.

1162
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:56,300
I think I feel like I would gravitate to the more extreme, like

1163
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:59,880
what I now know are like, you know, like like the Memphis colors,

1164
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:01,560
you know, like an old Taco Bell.

1165
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:02,120
Oh, yeah.

1166
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:04,900
Because these colors were new to us in the 90s.

1167
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:06,660
Also very southwest.

1168
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:09,820
So like I I still have to consult.

1169
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,820
You get the pack of 64 crayons and they would have those color.

1170
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:15,420
I remember like you get like if we get a double the crayons,

1171
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:17,080
you would get those colors you're talking about.

1172
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:18,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1173
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:19,540
And they felt they felt novelty.

1174
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:21,060
They were being used in our code.

1175
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:24,680
We were the first generation who were getting those colors in our clothes.

1176
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:25,080
Yeah.

1177
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:25,900
Yeah.

1178
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:29,360
So I feel like I would go green

1179
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:35,280
monkeys because it was kind of a more of a turquoise.

1180
00:47:35,340 --> 00:47:37,480
It felt like an extreme green.

1181
00:47:37,660 --> 00:47:37,980
Yeah.

1182
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:38,520
So I think so.

1183
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:39,380
That's a question.

1184
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:43,420
If you had the if you had to pay your silver snakes,

1185
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:46,040
you think if they if they let you choose, which is a big if.

1186
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:50,320
Yeah, I imagine everyone piled on the water to colors and everyone else had to suffer.

1187
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:50,900
Yeah.

1188
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:51,760
Yeah.

1189
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:51,820
Yeah.

1190
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:53,480
The dregs what's left in the pile.

1191
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:54,120
You also OK.

1192
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:58,580
It's red jaguars, blue barracudas, green monkeys, orange iguanas.

1193
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:01,420
That's a good I mean, because iguanas also feels like that.

1194
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:03,280
That also felt like an animal of the time.

1195
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:03,820
Yeah.

1196
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:06,900
That's an animal that we're sunglasses.

1197
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:07,720
Yeah.

1198
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:08,060
Yeah.

1199
00:48:08,060 --> 00:48:09,800
Not all of these would purple parrots.

1200
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:11,340
I don't think you're catching a parrot in some.

1201
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:13,260
But that's what I was my team.

1202
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:14,100
You'd be prepared.

1203
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:16,380
There's no this is like guessing.

1204
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:19,780
This is just I was I was like, that's my team every time.

1205
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:21,280
I was never win.

1206
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:23,380
Oh, and then I was disappointed.

1207
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:24,780
Yeah.

1208
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:26,360
Jason Blue Bear Acudas.

1209
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:27,080
Blue Bear Acudas.

1210
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:27,820
Yeah.

1211
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:30,020
It was a calming shade of blue.

1212
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:31,420
Yeah, I agree.

1213
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:32,660
Yeah.

1214
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:32,760
Yeah.

1215
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:34,780
Barracuda is an interesting animal.

1216
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:35,360
Mm hmm.

1217
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:35,600
Yeah.

1218
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:36,200
Yeah.

1219
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:36,700
Yeah.

1220
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:37,860
It feels like educate.

1221
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:39,400
It feels like it's not a primary.

1222
00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:40,220
You know what I mean?

1223
00:48:40,220 --> 00:48:41,600
No, it's not.

1224
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:42,260
No, it's not.

1225
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:43,140
Bear or dog.

1226
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:43,800
Yeah.

1227
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:46,140
Those are the primary animals.

1228
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:46,520
Yeah.

1229
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:47,560
Bear and dog.

1230
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:48,740
Bear, dog.

1231
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:49,700
Yellow dog.

1232
00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:51,940
And so that's all like a name, I think.

1233
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:52,880
Yeah.

1234
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:55,660
Sometimes you think of cats once in a blue moon.

1235
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:56,840
You remember cats.

1236
00:48:57,820 --> 00:48:58,220
Anaconda.

1237
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:00,840
I well, so we don't overlap.

1238
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:02,380
So we wouldn't have a problem.

1239
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:04,580
Yeah, we'd all be fighting to the death on that.

1240
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:04,880
Yeah.

1241
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:05,320
Yeah.

1242
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:05,980
Yeah.

1243
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:06,360
Yeah.

1244
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:07,600
Then you just take it to the moat.

1245
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:10,820
So that's the first challenge that's right up at the top,

1246
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:12,600
which is kind of good for excitement.

1247
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:13,920
Real fast.

1248
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:17,500
You can maybe get a little tease of what the

1249
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:23,380
legend is, you know, and then you're just right into the,

1250
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:24,760
it's always a moat challenge.

1251
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:28,320
And maybe you're jumping across inner tubes.

1252
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:31,300
Maybe you're going across some wire or something.

1253
00:49:31,660 --> 00:49:33,880
Either way, it's chaos.

1254
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:38,180
And either way, at least one team is really eating shit.

1255
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:38,820
Yeah.

1256
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:45,040
I read that this would sometimes take half an hour to do.

1257
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:47,480
For each taping.

1258
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:48,800
Yes, for each tape,

1259
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:52,200
which this might be a good chance to talk about the tedium.

1260
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,960
I really, truly, I think I knew the bare bones of this,

1261
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,920
but that they would shoot five episodes in a day.

1262
00:49:59,220 --> 00:49:59,980
My God.

1263
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:04,760
And then do all the moats, all the steps, all the temple.

1264
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:07,260
You just had like hundreds of kids

1265
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:08,720
in a holding room at all times.

1266
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:09,460
Oh, God.

1267
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:10,880
That's the worst part.

1268
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:14,160
Green monkey seven, green monkey seven.

1269
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:17,040
Getting confused about which green monkey it is.

1270
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:19,660
There was one job, one number to remember.

1271
00:50:19,940 --> 00:50:23,280
A break room with like arcade games and pizza.

1272
00:50:23,580 --> 00:50:25,200
And how sick must you have been

1273
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:28,160
of being in that fucking break room by the end of the day?

1274
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:30,980
Well, imagine like that lighting is not good.

1275
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:32,780
The smell is not good.

1276
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:35,760
Like old because they're just leaving those pizzas out.

1277
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:39,620
And you are bloated from pizza and like store brand soda,

1278
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:41,880
like public store brand Dr.

1279
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:42,520
Pepper,

1280
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:45,020
just guzzling it over and over.

1281
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:45,360
Dr.

1282
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:46,600
Special or something.

1283
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:47,960
Yeah, Dr.

1284
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:48,280
Good.

1285
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:48,640
Dr.

1286
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:49,100
Temple.

1287
00:50:50,740 --> 00:50:51,660
That's their in-house.

1288
00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:52,260
Yeah.

1289
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:53,160
They probably brew it up.

1290
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:55,260
We save money by making our own Dr.

1291
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:55,520
Pepper.

1292
00:50:55,820 --> 00:50:58,360
If we just make all our soda for the year,

1293
00:50:58,580 --> 00:50:59,620
right before the tapings.

1294
00:50:59,620 --> 00:51:00,460
If we use the boat water and it's flavoring.

1295
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:05,320
With rubber-made containers and cans of seltzer

1296
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:06,780
and buckets of syrup.

1297
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:10,400
Okay, so Jed, we need you to write three legends,

1298
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:11,980
then go mix up the soda.

1299
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:14,620
Put it in the carbonation machine.

1300
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:17,500
And really rinse that rubber-made out

1301
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:20,080
because the kids were getting pretty sick yesterday.

1302
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:21,980
Also, you're the lifeguard,

1303
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:23,740
so make sure you have these teams drown

1304
00:51:23,740 --> 00:51:25,700
in front of their families, please.

1305
00:51:26,140 --> 00:51:27,280
Brush up on CPR.

1306
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:28,580
We can't give you a full lesson.

1307
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:29,860
We can't get a specialist out,

1308
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:31,600
but just like find a book if you can.

1309
00:51:31,660 --> 00:51:32,860
If the kids want to drink a water,

1310
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,380
tell them to go drink from the moat.

1311
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,880
We don't have running water here.

1312
00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:40,860
Remember, you can't put makeup on

1313
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:43,000
until after the moat sequence

1314
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,140
because you did it in the wrong order last time.

1315
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:48,380
You scared a kid, they nearly drowned.

1316
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:50,940
You could put a little zinc on your nose.

1317
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:54,020
That'll just read as lifeguard materials.

1318
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:56,820
But don't push your GD luck, okay?

1319
00:51:58,700 --> 00:51:59,440
You hear me, Jed?

1320
00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:01,140
I don't want to say this again, Jed.

1321
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:03,840
The whole thing is on Jed's back.

1322
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:07,520
But yeah, this thing was done maddeningly,

1323
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:09,560
I mean, not quickly on the day.

1324
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:13,080
It seems like these tapings were probably incredible slogs.

1325
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:16,760
But okay, the breakdown on this, 40 episodes a season,

1326
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:20,200
all done within two weeks.

1327
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:24,860
So that's like what we all watched over the course of,

1328
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:27,540
for the first time they aired a couple months,

1329
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:29,740
but then you're still watching it in college.

1330
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:32,160
Like where do I put it on, on Peacock?

1331
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:34,000
Not Peacock, what fucking streamer's wish?

1332
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,480
It's on Paramount Plus.

1333
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:36,980
Paramount Plus, god.

1334
00:52:37,580 --> 00:52:40,540
It's two weeks of these people's lives.

1335
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:44,100
Multiply that by three, three seasons, we're up to six.

1336
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:46,720
And this is, for somebody like Kirk Fogg,

1337
00:52:47,140 --> 00:52:49,240
this is what he'll be known for forever,

1338
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:52,600
for something that he did over six weeks of his life.

1339
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:56,160
It's pretty crazy to think of it that way.

1340
00:52:56,180 --> 00:52:58,820
That's shorter than some plays get.

1341
00:52:58,820 --> 00:53:00,840
How long did the moon landing take, you know?

1342
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:02,180
That's true.

1343
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:04,340
Hey, hey, hey, you know what, if we're crunching numbers.

1344
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:07,300
Kirk Fogg, Neil Armstrong, Tare Potato.

1345
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:09,860
Big important things in American history, so yeah.

1346
00:53:10,180 --> 00:53:10,800
Yes, true.

1347
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:14,400
Yeah, you know, the QAnon shaman is famous

1348
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:15,780
for something that happened in just.

1349
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:16,440
Yeah, that was like two hours.

1350
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:17,400
Just three hours.

1351
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:18,620
Yeah, same deal.

1352
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:21,920
So actually the two weeks is pretty meaty.

1353
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:26,400
Do you think a day of shooting a legend in the hidden temple

1354
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,460
was worse than like a day of shooting Elf?

1355
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:31,880
Because like Elf notoriously would be like a slog,

1356
00:53:31,940 --> 00:53:33,840
because like you couldn't get the puppet wouldn't work.

1357
00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:35,900
The angle was wrong.

1358
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:38,480
Puppet engineers were banging their heads

1359
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:39,000
against the wall.

1360
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:40,500
Everyone was just miserable.

1361
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:43,540
At least that's just one component.

1362
00:53:43,780 --> 00:53:46,400
Yeah, you don't have like a bunch of impatient children

1363
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:48,400
if you get wrangled all times.

1364
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:49,360
I guess that's true.

1365
00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:51,260
It's more controlled, I suppose.

1366
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:53,640
And you do have a puppet, which I imagine

1367
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:56,800
that that plank of wood came out,

1368
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,420
like the duct tape connecting it.

1369
00:53:58,420 --> 00:53:59,500
That seems a little foolproof though.

1370
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:01,260
It's just a lever, you know.

1371
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:02,420
Yeah, that's true.

1372
00:54:02,420 --> 00:54:03,900
Yeah, yeah, maybe that is,

1373
00:54:04,060 --> 00:54:05,520
it's pretty basic engineering.

1374
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:07,260
Olmec does have to display the range of emotions

1375
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:08,420
that Elf does, you know.

1376
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:10,780
I bet Olmec was easier to do than Elf.

1377
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:11,500
Yeah, I agree.

1378
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:12,760
From controlling the character.

1379
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:15,880
He's stationary, all he does is his mouth opens

1380
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:17,920
and his eyes glow, you know, that's easier than.

1381
00:54:17,980 --> 00:54:20,020
Yeah, and they never had to give him sunglasses.

1382
00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:20,720
Exactly.

1383
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:23,980
Yeah, worst case they could ADR Olmec.

1384
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:25,140
Yeah, yeah, true.

1385
00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:27,060
They could get footage of him dead on

1386
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:30,100
and then like later in a sound booth have him

1387
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:34,560
talk about Benjamin Franklin's little glasses or something.

1388
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:39,720
Let's talk about some of these legends.

1389
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:42,840
That's a good, because I completely forgot this.

1390
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:43,940
I completely forgot.

1391
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:46,000
I forgot everything but the end of the show.

1392
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:47,380
Yeah, yeah, me too.

1393
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:49,300
I don't think anything else about the format of it.

1394
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:50,800
The end of the show is obviously the thing

1395
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:52,740
you want to get to.

1396
00:54:53,060 --> 00:54:55,320
The rest has a certain chaff quality to it

1397
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:56,660
where it's like, all right, let's go through

1398
00:54:56,660 --> 00:54:59,520
these kind of like generic rope climbing games

1399
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:01,720
and all that while we're waiting for the freaking temple.

1400
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it feels like time killing

1401
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:06,540
and not all of it can be as like big scale

1402
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:07,940
as the big temple run.

1403
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:12,640
But yeah, I 100% forgot that there's this zone

1404
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:16,600
where Olmec weaves the tail of the item

1405
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:19,180
and how it ended up in the temple.

1406
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:24,140
And then you have to remember what he said.

1407
00:55:24,140 --> 00:55:26,340
Oh, that's right, it's reading comprehension.

1408
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:27,460
Yes, yeah, yeah.

1409
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:28,180
Listening comprehension.

1410
00:55:28,180 --> 00:55:30,400
It's a little mini SAT thing.

1411
00:55:30,580 --> 00:55:33,980
And it feels very Carmen and San Diego inspired to me.

1412
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:35,280
Yes, yeah, true.

1413
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:36,860
In the sense of like, we're gonna give the kids

1414
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:38,760
a little something they're gonna use.

1415
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:44,160
Yeah, yeah, except that it's nonsense, right?

1416
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:48,540
It's all lies about Abraham Lincoln riding a horse.

1417
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,820
Yeah, yeah, yeah, his favorite, Abraham Lincoln spurs.

1418
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:55,580
Why wouldn't it be the hat?

1419
00:55:55,700 --> 00:55:56,760
The hat's right there.

1420
00:55:56,780 --> 00:55:57,960
Abraham Lincoln's also.

1421
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:03,280
I still am so history deficient

1422
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:08,720
that it took me a long ways through the episode

1423
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:12,280
the jewel encrusted egg of Catherine the Great.

1424
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:15,500
Me as an adult to think, wait a minute,

1425
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:18,340
I bet Catherine the Great didn't have

1426
00:56:18,340 --> 00:56:20,040
a jewel encrusted egg.

1427
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:23,080
Teaching his kids all these useless fake facts.

1428
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:27,720
on tests and reports.

1429
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:29,760
That gets lodged in their head.

1430
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:32,440
The real Benjamin Franklin one is called

1431
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:35,160
the Electrified Key of Benjamin Franklin,

1432
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:37,980
which we all kind of know that story.

1433
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:39,200
That's rooted in something.

1434
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:40,840
But we all know that is apocryphal.

1435
00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:43,680
But I don't know that we can track down

1436
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:45,980
the broken wing of Icarus.

1437
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:48,920
It's been lost to history.

1438
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:51,220
Wait a minute, yeah, we have character,

1439
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:53,580
for example, there's Amelia Earhart,

1440
00:56:53,580 --> 00:56:57,680
a fairly recent historical figure versus Icarus.

1441
00:56:57,700 --> 00:56:59,980
Icarus, a fictional allegory.

1442
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:03,760
The scales of Pontius Pilate.

1443
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:08,420
Oh, the silver, Judas' little baggy of silver.

1444
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:09,080
Yeah, Judas' little silver.

1445
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:13,580
What is the most, is Amelia Earhart the most recent person?

1446
00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:14,620
That has to be right, right.

1447
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:15,520
I'm trying to think.

1448
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:17,920
I don't have the whole list in front of me.

1449
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,960
Like, Jimmy Carter's mobile phone.

1450
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:24,680
Magic Johnson's NBA Championship ring.

1451
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:27,640
Did you just steal it?

1452
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:30,360
He was here for the All-Star game or something?

1453
00:57:31,180 --> 00:57:32,740
The jersey of David Justice.

1454
00:57:33,060 --> 00:57:34,400
The Gordon Lady's gun.

1455
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:41,400
The dried Japanese banquet vomit of George Bush.

1456
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:47,620
Oh, yeah.

1457
00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:49,880
Bill Clinton's saxophone.

1458
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:51,300
That was the only one done real time.

1459
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:53,100
Like, hey, we're planning a show.

1460
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:53,660
That's great.

1461
00:57:53,740 --> 00:57:55,700
Somebody called his buddy at KTLA.

1462
00:57:55,980 --> 00:57:56,640
Like, hey, could you?

1463
00:57:56,760 --> 00:57:59,520
Can someone take it to FedEx, please?

1464
00:57:59,820 --> 00:58:02,760
Hurry, six o'clock is the last drop off.

1465
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:04,760
Orlando ASAP.

1466
00:58:06,180 --> 00:58:08,460
It's a pretty strange assertion

1467
00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:10,820
that every historical figure has a primary item,

1468
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:13,340
and you can tell that they are stretching with some of them,

1469
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:15,960
because you end up with, the Amelia Earhart one,

1470
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:18,340
you're like, oh, is it her goggles

1471
00:58:18,340 --> 00:58:21,320
or a little propeller pin or something?

1472
00:58:21,380 --> 00:58:25,520
No, it is the lucky pot-bellied pig of Amelia Earhart.

1473
00:58:27,060 --> 00:58:28,700
Well, I guess she didn't take it with her.

1474
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:29,660
You got it.

1475
00:58:29,740 --> 00:58:30,760
Exactly, yes.

1476
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:35,340
Like, Broken Wing of Icarus, maybe they thought,

1477
00:58:35,340 --> 00:58:37,640
well, maybe it fell to earth,

1478
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:39,100
but since we don't, I guess they're like,

1479
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:41,640
the wreckage of Amelia Earhart,

1480
00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:43,240
we don't know what happened exactly,

1481
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:45,940
so how would the wreckage of, that would be a clue.

1482
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:47,420
So they did think this through.

1483
00:58:47,420 --> 00:58:50,220
Like, it's gotta be something that she didn't take,

1484
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:52,000
so it was like, her little buddy,

1485
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:54,020
like, fueling up the plane or whatever.

1486
00:58:54,340 --> 00:58:55,300
This is a weird story.

1487
00:58:55,700 --> 00:58:59,340
Carved her a little wooden pot-bellied pig.

1488
00:58:59,580 --> 00:59:01,040
Here, take it for good luck.

1489
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:02,760
She says, no.

1490
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:06,580
Doubly weird, because here's something for good luck.

1491
00:59:06,820 --> 00:59:08,560
No, thanks, I won't need it.

1492
00:59:08,620 --> 00:59:09,900
I, Amelia Earhart, will make it.

1493
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:11,300
I'm doing a perfectly safe task.

1494
00:59:12,580 --> 00:59:17,320
It's a very time-tested, very easy function to do.

1495
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:21,040
But also, I crafted this especially for you.

1496
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:22,880
I did wood carving for you.

1497
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:26,420
Fuck you, engineer, working on my rickety plane.

1498
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:28,700
So yeah, if you take anything away from this,

1499
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:29,600
it's that she's mean.

1500
00:59:29,780 --> 00:59:31,380
She's rude and thoughtless.

1501
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:34,380
Yeah, yeah, so we can all feel a little less sorry

1502
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:36,040
about Amelia Earhart passing,

1503
00:59:36,140 --> 00:59:40,980
because now we know she was a terrible gift non-acceptor.

1504
00:59:41,100 --> 00:59:42,220
Just appreciate her employees.

1505
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:46,500
The one kind of face on a person that struck me,

1506
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:48,960
Lawrence of Arabia's headdress.

1507
00:59:49,140 --> 00:59:52,580
There's no way the kids know.

1508
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,100
I'm sure the writer even was like,

1509
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:57,220
they're not thinking about the real guy.

1510
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:58,200
They're just thinking like,

1511
00:59:58,460 --> 01:00:00,600
I saw that movie at like 2 a.

1512
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:00,780
m.

1513
01:00:00,780 --> 01:00:01,680
on TV.

1514
01:00:01,740 --> 01:00:04,040
Yeah, the headdress of David.

1515
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:07,000
No, Lawrence, Lawrence of Arabia.

1516
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1517
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:13,200
It's also funny, because you're always right around

1518
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:15,620
the corner from horrors,

1519
01:00:15,620 --> 01:00:17,260
where if you look up the real story,

1520
01:00:17,340 --> 01:00:20,080
because the real stories are from terrible times

1521
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:21,460
and about terrible people.

1522
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:24,840
So like the jewel-encrusted egg of Catherine the Great,

1523
01:00:25,260 --> 01:00:27,660
because I first Google, did Catherine the Great

1524
01:00:27,660 --> 01:00:31,400
actually have a jewel-encrusted egg, like a dumbass?

1525
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:33,520
And then you start, then you learn real,

1526
01:00:33,620 --> 01:00:35,560
one of the facts that the kids have to remember

1527
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:39,260
is the name of her friend, Gregory Orlov,

1528
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:41,240
who I think was actually some like.

1529
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:42,640
Oh man, that's gotta be a tough one.

1530
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,640
What was the name of Catherine the Great's friend?

1531
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:46,720
The kid's like, Gregory Romolf.

1532
01:00:50,820 --> 01:00:52,100
And yeah, the pressure,

1533
01:00:52,100 --> 01:00:54,480
you have to remember Russian last names,

1534
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:56,420
or you don't get a huffy.

1535
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:02,380
That haunts a kid, you know that, for the rest of his life.

1536
01:01:03,420 --> 01:01:08,040
Mom, dad, why didn't you enroll me in Russian history classes

1537
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:09,300
when I was 11?

1538
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:13,500
Okay, you know, when I would watch these game shows,

1539
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:17,180
I thought like, okay, I think I could do the flags

1540
01:01:17,180 --> 01:01:21,140
on Double Dare, I think I could handle what would you do.

1541
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:24,140
That's what it was called, right, the other Mark Summers?

1542
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:24,560
Yeah.

1543
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:28,280
But this show, I think the only part I was like,

1544
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:32,160
I bet I could do that, like the step on the ground

1545
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:36,840
answer a question that the giant stone man said

1546
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:39,120
90 seconds ago, you know?

1547
01:01:39,260 --> 01:01:40,820
Would you be worried though about,

1548
01:01:40,820 --> 01:01:43,460
because what was flashing through my head was timing

1549
01:01:43,460 --> 01:01:47,280
of the probably janky step to light it up.

1550
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:50,260
And you know that's what gets you even on current game shows

1551
01:01:50,260 --> 01:01:53,460
on Jeopardy is the like, getting the rhythm of the thing.

1552
01:01:53,900 --> 01:01:56,060
You feel like you got the reading comprehension,

1553
01:01:56,140 --> 01:01:59,360
but do you think you could master the perfect step?

1554
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:01,760
I'd be worried every step of the way.

1555
01:02:01,820 --> 01:02:03,460
I'd just be worried about every,

1556
01:02:03,460 --> 01:02:05,640
I'm sure I would try to like hurt myself

1557
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:07,440
like trying to nail in the floor.

1558
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:10,540
Which I'm sure the response time on that floor,

1559
01:02:10,540 --> 01:02:12,600
like you said, the Jeopardy buzzer,

1560
01:02:12,740 --> 01:02:15,820
no way that was super accurate.

1561
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:17,020
You may be a little ahead,

1562
01:02:17,020 --> 01:02:18,520
you gotta be a little ahead of it.

1563
01:02:19,580 --> 01:02:21,480
And yeah, I don't think they're mastering the rhythm.

1564
01:02:21,580 --> 01:02:24,300
It would be great to see a kid so stressed

1565
01:02:24,300 --> 01:02:26,220
that they just puncture the floor.

1566
01:02:26,220 --> 01:02:26,540
Yeah.

1567
01:02:27,260 --> 01:02:29,060
They go all the way through.

1568
01:02:29,220 --> 01:02:30,340
Kick Jed right in the head.

1569
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:32,960
He's under there for some reason.

1570
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:35,960
He's just turning light switches on and off.

1571
01:02:36,740 --> 01:02:38,240
That's the one man band too.

1572
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:40,740
He has like one, two, three, four platforms.

1573
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:43,300
He's got two with his fingers and two with his toes.

1574
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:44,480
I hate this guy.

1575
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:46,180
I turn the corner in this building

1576
01:02:46,180 --> 01:02:48,340
and he's always there doing something.

1577
01:02:48,700 --> 01:02:51,300
And he seems so tired and so sad.

1578
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:54,300
Smoking cigarettes every time I see him.

1579
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:00,180
Jed, I told you, don't smoke under the steps.

1580
01:03:00,940 --> 01:03:04,540
The one, this one really seemed like a stretch to me.

1581
01:03:05,180 --> 01:03:08,640
The golden pepperoni of Catherine de' Medici.

1582
01:03:11,020 --> 01:03:12,480
Who, and this was.

1583
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:14,280
It's almost like an Italian slur or something.

1584
01:03:14,700 --> 01:03:16,480
It sounds offensive, yeah.

1585
01:03:16,820 --> 01:03:17,900
Well and what's weird about it,

1586
01:03:17,940 --> 01:03:20,100
this is about the Queen of France.

1587
01:03:20,260 --> 01:03:22,340
Yeah, she famously loved pepperoni.

1588
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:25,000
Yeah, so why are we, and then the story is about

1589
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:28,480
her therapist, Linguini.

1590
01:03:29,060 --> 01:03:30,660
I think maybe they just didn't,

1591
01:03:30,660 --> 01:03:32,100
they just didn't do this right.

1592
01:03:32,620 --> 01:03:34,360
They got some names wrong.

1593
01:03:34,360 --> 01:03:35,600
Well this is also before the internet,

1594
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:36,700
so you just had to kind of go on

1595
01:03:36,700 --> 01:03:38,080
whatever knowledge you already had.

1596
01:03:38,700 --> 01:03:40,260
So you're just kind of patching it together.

1597
01:03:40,300 --> 01:03:42,240
Who's gonna call you out, a bunch of dumbass kids?

1598
01:03:42,940 --> 01:03:43,880
Yeah, they don't know.

1599
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:46,580
They're wrote listening to these stories

1600
01:03:46,580 --> 01:03:49,240
so that they can step on a button correctly.

1601
01:03:49,340 --> 01:03:50,240
They are not gonna correct.

1602
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:53,140
But in this case, was it like,

1603
01:03:53,300 --> 01:03:56,340
was Catherine de' Medici from France, Italy,

1604
01:03:56,760 --> 01:04:00,160
kid says France, then they like, no, uh, whoa.

1605
01:04:00,620 --> 01:04:01,820
Oh wait, uh oh.

1606
01:04:01,820 --> 01:04:02,240
Maybe.

1607
01:04:03,180 --> 01:04:03,820
What do we do?

1608
01:04:03,820 --> 01:04:05,700
Back to one, everyone.

1609
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:08,060
We need to redo that.

1610
01:04:08,100 --> 01:04:09,840
The camera ran out of tape.

1611
01:04:11,780 --> 01:04:13,960
Oh, side fact about it, I am happy though

1612
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:16,760
that they made, I think maybe they needed

1613
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:19,040
to make up some bullshit about Catherine de' Medici

1614
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:22,060
because in real life, she was under a lot of pressure

1615
01:04:22,060 --> 01:04:25,360
to like continue the family line and have a lot of babies.

1616
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:27,100
A recurring thing of all of these,

1617
01:04:27,540 --> 01:04:29,980
like were the real people's lives as fun

1618
01:04:29,980 --> 01:04:31,640
as Olmec's legend told?

1619
01:04:31,640 --> 01:04:34,360
And then it's like, they had 15 children

1620
01:04:34,360 --> 01:04:35,720
and the three survived.

1621
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:38,360
The horrors of being all of these people.

1622
01:04:38,540 --> 01:04:39,280
But this woman.

1623
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:41,120
You would all be dead, children.

1624
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:46,440
You should be begging to go the Punta Cana Ramada.

1625
01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:49,320
It's better than any palace

1626
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:51,520
that any of these kings could have dreamed of.

1627
01:04:53,620 --> 01:04:56,820
The real woman, she had to like continue the family line.

1628
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,540
So she had to reproduce and fast.

1629
01:04:59,540 --> 01:05:04,140
So she had to do all of the known at the times

1630
01:05:04,140 --> 01:05:07,480
perfect ways to ensure that you will get pregnant.

1631
01:05:07,860 --> 01:05:10,380
Those including drinking mule urine

1632
01:05:10,940 --> 01:05:13,820
and covering her vagina in cow dung.

1633
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:19,180
Yeah, this is a royal we're talking about.

1634
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:22,500
This is a queen has to put cow shit.

1635
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:24,820
Was there a rationale for both of those things?

1636
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:26,620
Not that I saw.

1637
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:32,860
because if she asked, so why do I drink mule urine?

1638
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:35,700
It's a lot of, look.

1639
01:05:36,340 --> 01:05:36,860
If you have to ask.

1640
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:38,580
It took an hour to explain it.

1641
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:40,000
It was mostly himing and hawing.

1642
01:05:40,220 --> 01:05:42,460
Yeah, you're not gonna get it I don't think.

1643
01:05:42,580 --> 01:05:43,440
You're not gonna understand it.

1644
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:44,500
That's queen shit.

1645
01:05:44,500 --> 01:05:45,840
It's a science thing

1646
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:48,360
and we don't wanna burden you with that.

1647
01:05:48,660 --> 01:05:49,660
We don't, we just want.

1648
01:05:52,580 --> 01:05:56,480
You just keep your head on in the game

1649
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:58,780
of fucking and drinking mule piss.

1650
01:05:59,410 --> 01:06:01,900
Look, here's my guess for the shit

1651
01:06:02,460 --> 01:06:04,480
is that it's like shit is fertilizer.

1652
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:05,840
Sure, there you go.

1653
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:06,320
Oh!

1654
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:09,720
It's surely a semantic device.

1655
01:06:15,140 --> 01:06:17,580
everyone is pretty miserable.

1656
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:19,740
It's pretty funny.

1657
01:06:19,740 --> 01:06:20,700
It's a very grotesque film.

1658
01:06:21,020 --> 01:06:22,520
But it's very grotesque

1659
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:25,620
and the only people who are happy are just constantly,

1660
01:06:25,620 --> 01:06:29,320
even they just have to be constantly backstabbing everyone.

1661
01:06:29,900 --> 01:06:32,120
They can never let their guard down.

1662
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:34,420
So they can be one of the two people

1663
01:06:34,420 --> 01:06:38,060
with living in the comfortable life of smearing couch.

1664
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:41,240
Yes, and it will probably drive them insane.

1665
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:42,500
Yeah, that too.

1666
01:06:42,680 --> 01:06:43,180
Yeah, yeah, everybody.

1667
01:06:43,180 --> 01:06:45,180
If you aren't dying from one of the diseases

1668
01:06:45,180 --> 01:06:47,780
or from just random animals and bugs being around,

1669
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:49,640
then you go loony.

1670
01:06:49,860 --> 01:06:51,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1671
01:06:52,220 --> 01:06:55,300
The other thing, not to get into too uncomfortable,

1672
01:06:55,300 --> 01:06:58,300
you brought this one up, Harriet Tubman.

1673
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:01,440
I think it's strange that there were three episodes

1674
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:04,440
that had slavery figures in them.

1675
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:05,300
Yeah, sure.

1676
01:07:05,460 --> 01:07:09,180
Because besides, look, there's weightier reasons

1677
01:07:09,180 --> 01:07:12,420
why that is weird, but also how did all these artifacts

1678
01:07:12,420 --> 01:07:16,000
from the South end up in this Mesoamerican temple

1679
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:19,080
that otherwise has things that Icarus used?

1680
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:20,080
You're saying?

1681
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:22,180
It's a real catch-all temple.

1682
01:07:22,420 --> 01:07:23,140
It really is.

1683
01:07:23,140 --> 01:07:24,200
It's a temple of the mind.

1684
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:27,200
Yeah, I guess maybe, yeah, that's a good way to think of it

1685
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:28,720
versus an actual location.

1686
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:30,200
Yeah, if you had a pinpoint on the map,

1687
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:32,980
it would be like, not be detectable by a GPS.

1688
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:35,080
It's everywhere and nowhere all at once.

1689
01:07:35,380 --> 01:07:37,520
Lay lines converge on the temple.

1690
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:41,620
It's like a multiverse inflection point,

1691
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:42,880
and that's how items end up there.

1692
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:45,260
Multiverse of history and myth, all colliding.

1693
01:07:45,540 --> 01:07:48,200
We have done more backstory, by the way,

1694
01:07:48,740 --> 01:07:53,320
in a little over an hour than they ever did.

1695
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:55,120
We have access to the internet.

1696
01:08:00,220 --> 01:08:03,240
We have established more concrete logic

1697
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:05,920
than the stone production people.

1698
01:08:06,100 --> 01:08:07,740
Because we all have computers,

1699
01:08:08,020 --> 01:08:11,060
and we don't have to win Encyclopedia Britannica's,

1700
01:08:11,060 --> 01:08:12,340
like some of the kids on the show.

1701
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:13,440
You have knowledge back there.

1702
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:14,860
You won We All Fortune.

1703
01:08:16,380 --> 01:08:17,760
Odd outmoded prizes.

1704
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:20,600
They wouldn't give that to you actually at the show, right,

1705
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:23,160
where you'd have to buy two suitcases to take it home?

1706
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:25,940
They'd probably ship it to you, I imagine.

1707
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:27,340
I would think.

1708
01:08:27,460 --> 01:08:29,220
Could I just get the hair gel?

1709
01:08:29,540 --> 01:08:30,880
That seems easier to pack.

1710
01:08:31,460 --> 01:08:32,220
LA looks.

1711
01:08:33,540 --> 01:08:35,620
I'll take the LA looks package, please.

1712
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:37,260
Can I say one that I like?

1713
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:37,980
Oh yeah, yeah, please.

1714
01:08:38,100 --> 01:08:39,860
Robin Hood and Marianne's ladder.

1715
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:41,760
Ladder.

1716
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:43,260
Or Marianne, sorry, Madey Marianne.

1717
01:08:43,480 --> 01:08:43,920
Ladder.

1718
01:08:44,060 --> 01:08:44,940
Their ladder.

1719
01:08:45,360 --> 01:08:46,620
Is that like a Rapunzel thing or something?

1720
01:08:46,740 --> 01:08:48,920
I guess, because yeah, he rescued her,

1721
01:08:49,160 --> 01:08:50,840
but wouldn't it be, there's more fun.

1722
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:52,460
Yeah, it's Bo and Arrow.

1723
01:08:52,460 --> 01:08:54,360
That's probably my go-to.

1724
01:08:54,420 --> 01:08:56,020
Is Hal with the feather or something?

1725
01:08:56,320 --> 01:08:56,580
I don't know.

1726
01:08:56,700 --> 01:08:57,460
The ladder is funny.

1727
01:08:57,660 --> 01:08:58,460
The ladder is funny.

1728
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:01,840
Her tree does not factor in or anything that he robbed.

1729
01:09:02,380 --> 01:09:04,940
Right, like a sack of gold coins.

1730
01:09:06,540 --> 01:09:06,980
Ladder.

1731
01:09:07,480 --> 01:09:09,240
Well, maybe it'd be interesting to see

1732
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:10,780
what ladders used to look like,

1733
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:14,560
as opposed to our fancy modern ladders.

1734
01:09:14,700 --> 01:09:15,740
This is educational.

1735
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:18,800
Wow, so they couldn't fold up back then, huh?

1736
01:09:19,360 --> 01:09:19,420
Wow.

1737
01:09:19,880 --> 01:09:21,460
Boy, we have it pretty good, don't we?

1738
01:09:21,850 --> 01:09:23,980
Yeah, so these are insane.

1739
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:29,040
So you get past this zone,

1740
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:33,540
the kids, as we said, are just like sperm

1741
01:09:33,540 --> 01:09:37,100
not making it very far into the fertilization process.

1742
01:09:37,900 --> 01:09:39,280
So you don't have, we don't care,

1743
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:41,480
you don't learn the kids' names even at the beginning.

1744
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:42,140
You get nothing.

1745
01:09:42,360 --> 01:09:43,240
It's only the teens.

1746
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:44,700
So then eventually you get

1747
01:09:44,700 --> 01:09:47,140
kind of an awkward little banter segment.

1748
01:09:47,240 --> 01:09:49,320
They've picked out just a couple detail

1749
01:09:49,320 --> 01:09:50,840
that are usually just like,

1750
01:09:50,840 --> 01:09:52,020
so you do dance, huh?

1751
01:09:56,380 --> 01:09:58,840
because this zone can be a very awkward zone.

1752
01:09:58,860 --> 01:10:01,140
Kirk's interviewing like 30 of these kids a day.

1753
01:10:01,720 --> 01:10:03,740
He's already talked like seven Kevins today.

1754
01:10:04,100 --> 01:10:04,360
He doesn't have…

1755
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:06,420
He can't keep it straight.

1756
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:08,080
So you do soccer too, huh?

1757
01:10:08,300 --> 01:10:08,780
Wow.

1758
01:10:09,860 --> 01:10:11,620
You like hamburgers, huh?

1759
01:10:12,900 --> 01:10:14,260
Yeah, Kirk Fogg has been awake

1760
01:10:14,260 --> 01:10:15,760
for like 48 hours at this point.

1761
01:10:15,860 --> 01:10:16,540
He's just like, all right.

1762
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:19,320
By his own admission,

1763
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:21,280
because I've done some interview with him

1764
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:23,320
where they ask him really generic questions.

1765
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:24,240
And I like this one.

1766
01:10:24,300 --> 01:10:26,160
What was a typical day like at Nick Studios?

1767
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:27,920
Typical day for me was showing up

1768
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:29,020
and walking around the set,

1769
01:10:29,060 --> 01:10:31,340
trying to figure out what the show was about.

1770
01:10:32,620 --> 01:10:33,260
That, what?

1771
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:36,240
Did they not even brief you on anything?

1772
01:10:36,500 --> 01:10:36,980
You know what?

1773
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:39,860
Seems like he was as lost as anybody.

1774
01:10:39,860 --> 01:10:40,260
He was in a fog.

1775
01:10:40,260 --> 01:10:40,980
That wouldn't shock me.

1776
01:10:40,980 --> 01:10:41,880
Kirk was in a fog.

1777
01:10:42,340 --> 01:10:42,340
Oh yeah.

1778
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:44,240
I didn't get a lot of hands-on guidance.

1779
01:10:44,280 --> 01:10:45,360
So it was a bit overwhelming

1780
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:46,600
due to the nature of production.

1781
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:48,760
He also says that he got the part

1782
01:10:48,760 --> 01:10:50,300
because they didn't have a lot of time.

1783
01:10:50,980 --> 01:10:51,880
I don't know, get him in.

1784
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:53,020
He's in, he's going.

1785
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:55,540
That episode of success is just showing up.

1786
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:56,000
Yeah, yeah.

1787
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:56,260
That's right.

1788
01:10:56,540 --> 01:10:56,900
Sometimes.

1789
01:10:57,200 --> 01:10:58,060
It's half the battle.

1790
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:00,440
So he doesn't know any better than anybody else.

1791
01:11:00,720 --> 01:11:02,960
And then you're on to Temple Games.

1792
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:04,800
And I don't have a lot to say about Temple Games.

1793
01:11:04,980 --> 01:11:05,740
Because this is also,

1794
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:07,260
it's like you're just waiting for the…

1795
01:11:07,320 --> 01:11:08,420
Yeah, the Temple Games are filler.

1796
01:11:08,500 --> 01:11:10,100
They're basically just like another version

1797
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:12,220
of what you would see on Guts or Double Dare.

1798
01:11:12,260 --> 01:11:12,620
Yeah.

1799
01:11:12,620 --> 01:11:13,640
Like it's nothing really

1800
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:14,720
very Temple specific.

1801
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:15,840
And you know, it's like, all right,

1802
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:17,100
put these balls in a basket.

1803
01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:17,460
You know, it's…

1804
01:11:18,140 --> 01:11:20,820
The only interesting thing maybe sometimes

1805
01:11:20,820 --> 01:11:24,140
is that they do have to tie into the story.

1806
01:11:24,260 --> 01:11:24,820
Right.

1807
01:11:24,980 --> 01:11:27,080
So you now have to fold in

1808
01:11:27,080 --> 01:11:30,560
real historical events into what is usually just like

1809
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:34,120
going up and down or like being on some boxes.

1810
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:38,380
Maybe throwing some items to knock other items down.

1811
01:11:38,540 --> 01:11:41,240
For instance, in the one that I mentioned

1812
01:11:41,240 --> 01:11:43,380
about like Russian history, it was like,

1813
01:11:43,820 --> 01:11:45,360
they had to, in order for her to get in power,

1814
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:47,580
they had to depose some czars.

1815
01:11:47,580 --> 01:11:51,280
So you need to knock out four czars to win the…

1816
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:52,000
Yeah, yeah.

1817
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:53,340
And it's some like filler.

1818
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:57,180
So the kids are defeating czars and that's the game.

1819
01:11:57,220 --> 01:11:59,780
It's time to make Anastasia an orphan

1820
01:11:59,780 --> 01:12:01,800
by knocking these bottles over.

1821
01:12:03,480 --> 01:12:06,360
I also, one of them was like

1822
01:12:06,360 --> 01:12:08,020
the Underground Railroad, right?

1823
01:12:08,020 --> 01:12:08,300
Sure.

1824
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:09,600
Because it's part of that story.

1825
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:09,840
Oh, that's right.

1826
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:11,860
With like the mine cart, failing to understand

1827
01:12:11,860 --> 01:12:12,800
that it's a metaphor.

1828
01:12:12,940 --> 01:12:15,060
There's no actual railroad.

1829
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:16,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1830
01:12:16,180 --> 01:12:17,260
So you don't get the fun.

1831
01:12:17,260 --> 01:12:19,960
Yeah, you can't do anything with some train mechanism.

1832
01:12:20,220 --> 01:12:22,580
But they do, and again, they're trying to keep it educational.

1833
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:24,980
So they're telling you a little bit about how that worked

1834
01:12:24,980 --> 01:12:26,260
and there'd be like hiding spots

1835
01:12:26,260 --> 01:12:27,980
and then you're trying to make it up to Canada.

1836
01:12:28,300 --> 01:12:30,660
And what that ultimately leads to

1837
01:12:30,660 --> 01:12:32,500
is just the funny line from Kirk Fogg.

1838
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:35,920
All right, so the green monkeys, they made it to Canada.

1839
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:37,760
That means they're going to the temple.

1840
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:42,780
Really simplifies that.

1841
01:12:43,240 --> 01:12:46,140
Most of those facts can be true at the same time.

1842
01:12:46,820 --> 01:12:50,060
Yes, technically, it has lower stakes situations

1843
01:12:50,060 --> 01:12:51,980
than higher stakes situations.

1844
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:53,760
The slaves are freed and more importantly,

1845
01:12:53,980 --> 01:12:55,520
you all will be competing for the bikes.

1846
01:12:56,320 --> 01:12:59,680
That's in the past and right now what's important is

1847
01:12:59,680 --> 01:13:01,880
you get to get a walk in.

1848
01:13:01,940 --> 01:13:02,840
Get to that cave.

1849
01:13:03,100 --> 01:13:05,020
Gravity of this moment is.

1850
01:13:05,780 --> 01:13:07,040
Yeah, I was thinking a moment of silence

1851
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:10,060
to appreciate this and now Olmec explained

1852
01:13:10,060 --> 01:13:10,760
what they're doing.

1853
01:13:11,880 --> 01:13:14,400
The temple games were the pendants rounds

1854
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:16,300
and I was stressed out.

1855
01:13:16,700 --> 01:13:17,380
They gotta get enough pendants.

1856
01:13:17,380 --> 01:13:19,420
You gotta have the pendants like winning the trivia.

1857
01:13:20,100 --> 01:13:23,980
To get the advantage for the big game, for the race.

1858
01:13:24,240 --> 01:13:25,520
I mean, I was like.

1859
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:29,600
I felt relieved if they would get two pendants

1860
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:30,820
because then I think.

1861
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:32,020
Then they're impervious.

1862
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:33,640
Yeah, they're pretty much.

1863
01:13:33,900 --> 01:13:37,380
But man, if you got a pendant and a half or one half

1864
01:13:37,380 --> 01:13:39,800
and you had to find that other half,

1865
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:41,960
I was like, oh God, they're not gonna make it.

1866
01:13:42,220 --> 01:13:44,120
That's like when you would go into a video game

1867
01:13:44,120 --> 01:13:45,180
and you're like fighting a boss

1868
01:13:45,180 --> 01:13:47,040
or in the last level and you have one star.

1869
01:13:47,660 --> 01:13:49,900
It triggered, like that would trigger my same anxiety

1870
01:13:49,900 --> 01:13:52,180
about it like I'm not getting out of this.

1871
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:54,280
I do not have enough going in.

1872
01:13:54,380 --> 01:13:55,120
This is all I got.

1873
01:13:55,540 --> 01:13:55,640
Yeah.

1874
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:57,420
Temple guard in the second room done.

1875
01:13:57,420 --> 01:13:57,720
Yeah.

1876
01:13:57,820 --> 01:13:58,300
Game over.

1877
01:13:59,100 --> 01:13:59,200
Yeah.

1878
01:13:59,540 --> 01:14:02,880
I have a very specific memory of watching my dad

1879
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:05,520
taking a nap in his recliner.

1880
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:07,880
Very 90s dad thing.

1881
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:09,180
Taking a nap in his recliner.

1882
01:14:09,460 --> 01:14:12,940
I wanted, the show came on and like as I got closer

1883
01:14:12,940 --> 01:14:15,260
to the temple run, I like just scooted over

1884
01:14:15,260 --> 01:14:16,840
and just sat in the chair next to him

1885
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:20,000
because I'm like, if I'm gonna jump out of my skin

1886
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,160
and if I'm gonna get scared,

1887
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:24,980
at least I'll feel better if he's close by

1888
01:14:24,980 --> 01:14:27,660
even though he is totally dead asleep.

1889
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:29,680
Yeah, he can't do anything against those temple guards

1890
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:32,160
if they were to jump out of the television and attack you.

1891
01:14:32,380 --> 01:14:35,860
I don't know why I didn't just change the channel.

1892
01:14:36,020 --> 01:14:38,960
I guess because the cable provider

1893
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:41,240
had not given us Cartoon Network yet.

1894
01:14:41,240 --> 01:14:43,960
So I was like, well what do I watch besides Nickel,

1895
01:14:43,960 --> 01:14:45,920
I mostly watch Nickelodeon.

1896
01:14:46,180 --> 01:14:47,400
That's your whole life also.

1897
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:49,660
You're gonna not watch some Nickelodeon?

1898
01:14:49,820 --> 01:14:50,180
You have to.

1899
01:14:50,260 --> 01:14:52,180
You're not gonna be watching the best part of the show.

1900
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:52,960
Yeah.

1901
01:14:53,100 --> 01:14:53,720
High drama, man.

1902
01:14:54,040 --> 01:14:54,160
Yeah.

1903
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:56,300
It was our job at the time.

1904
01:14:56,540 --> 01:14:57,960
It was all, I felt a duty.

1905
01:14:58,160 --> 01:14:59,760
I have to consume four hours

1906
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:01,920
of whatever this channel is showing me.

1907
01:15:02,580 --> 01:15:06,260
Probably the repeat that's gonna air in two to three hours.

1908
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:07,940
And I wouldn't remember,

1909
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:09,760
I feel like I would just like not even know

1910
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:11,120
they were repeats sometimes.

1911
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:14,820
You just kinda get full, like, did I?

1912
01:15:15,380 --> 01:15:17,740
I'm gonna watch the same one, I don't know,

1913
01:15:18,020 --> 01:15:20,040
like 14 times and not know.

1914
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:23,340
There could have been five episodes if I didn't know.

1915
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:23,880
Yeah.

1916
01:15:25,580 --> 01:15:28,400
The discovery to me, watching the best of compilation

1917
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:30,640
that there were not just some teams who won,

1918
01:15:30,980 --> 01:15:33,480
but teams who won with one kid going through.

1919
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:36,140
Like they had a medallion, they had a pendant,

1920
01:15:36,860 --> 01:15:38,120
they got taken by a guard,

1921
01:15:38,120 --> 01:15:41,100
they never encountered any other guard

1922
01:15:41,100 --> 01:15:44,840
that got the artifact and then they got out,

1923
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:48,720
either with a lot of time or with the skin of their teeth.

1924
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:51,000
And I was just like the solo winners

1925
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,020
of like you are a god to me.

1926
01:15:54,100 --> 01:15:55,100
Buy a lottery ticket.

1927
01:15:57,260 --> 01:15:59,580
Do you think they're all doing well today?

1928
01:15:59,660 --> 01:16:02,220
They're all Fortune 500 CEOs, I think, the winners.

1929
01:16:02,720 --> 01:16:04,480
If you look at the list, you start to go,

1930
01:16:04,540 --> 01:16:06,260
oh wow, yeah, Temple, Temple.

1931
01:16:06,260 --> 01:16:07,660
Warren Buffett ran.

1932
01:16:09,380 --> 01:16:11,440
Blue Barracuda, yeah, yeah.

1933
01:16:11,860 --> 01:16:14,360
I think you could rewrite the Bruce Springsteen

1934
01:16:14,360 --> 01:16:18,320
song Glory Days about a Legends of the Hidden Temple winner

1935
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:21,920
that's now at a bar near the Nickelodeon studios in Orlando.

1936
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:24,480
I would never stop talking about this if I won that.

1937
01:16:24,500 --> 01:16:26,260
I would be talking about it every day of my life,

1938
01:16:26,380 --> 01:16:28,580
every new person I met, 100%.

1939
01:16:28,580 --> 01:16:29,560
Yeah, percent of like,

1940
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:31,800
you and like Olympic level athletes,

1941
01:16:32,340 --> 01:16:34,100
that's like how hard it is to win this.

1942
01:16:34,380 --> 01:16:35,960
So I would, you should be proud.

1943
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:38,240
Also on top of that, the Olympics were boring

1944
01:16:38,240 --> 01:16:39,000
and for grownups.

1945
01:16:39,480 --> 01:16:39,960
100%.

1946
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:42,180
This air, they kept rerunning,

1947
01:16:42,420 --> 01:16:44,020
the Olympics didn't get rerun on Nick.

1948
01:16:44,020 --> 01:16:45,720
That's true, that gets rerun once and forgotten.

1949
01:16:45,940 --> 01:16:47,220
So better, better than the Olympics.

1950
01:16:47,240 --> 01:16:49,960
I agree, I respect these kids more than I respect

1951
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:51,180
Michael Phelps, he trained.

1952
01:16:51,460 --> 01:16:53,580
These kids were just thrown into it.

1953
01:16:53,660 --> 01:16:55,160
That's a good point, yes.

1954
01:16:55,160 --> 01:16:55,860
Full of pizza.

1955
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:59,600
Of course they're good, they thought about being good.

1956
01:16:59,620 --> 01:17:01,820
These kids, the odds were completely against them.

1957
01:17:01,860 --> 01:17:03,340
Absolutely, paired up into the terrible.

1958
01:17:03,340 --> 01:17:07,660
A complete stranger told lies about historical figures

1959
01:17:07,660 --> 01:17:08,920
and forced to memorize them

1960
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:11,320
and then put this impossible puzzle

1961
01:17:11,320 --> 01:17:13,780
with fucking adults ready to grab them.

1962
01:17:14,140 --> 01:17:15,780
Absolutely, these guys are the real heroes.

1963
01:17:16,020 --> 01:17:17,520
Screaming audience, they've been separated

1964
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:18,820
from their parents all day.

1965
01:17:19,180 --> 01:17:23,240
Fed crappy pizza, only Jed tending to them.

1966
01:17:23,620 --> 01:17:24,100
100%.

1967
01:17:24,100 --> 01:17:25,260
There should be an Olympics where.

1968
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:26,680
These kids should all be on Mount Rushmore,

1969
01:17:26,700 --> 01:17:27,960
it should be like 90 kids.

1970
01:17:28,980 --> 01:17:30,320
Oh, I'm for it, yeah, yeah,

1971
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:31,940
I'll blow up a couple of them at least

1972
01:17:31,940 --> 01:17:37,680
and refashion them as all of the winning red Jaguars.

1973
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:42,240
They should also have an Olympics

1974
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:44,480
where the people don't train at all.

1975
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:46,580
That would be awesome.

1976
01:17:46,840 --> 01:17:48,380
That's a million dollar idea.

1977
01:17:48,660 --> 01:17:50,660
Olympic swimming pool and you just find some people,

1978
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:52,620
keep them in a room for 10 hours eating pizza

1979
01:17:52,620 --> 01:17:54,420
and then you go, oh by the way, you're doing swimming.

1980
01:17:55,560 --> 01:17:56,380
You're getting in the pool.

1981
01:17:57,060 --> 01:17:58,200
So I think that people would.

1982
01:17:58,200 --> 01:18:00,240
Yeah, you really can't train for this in any real way.

1983
01:18:00,820 --> 01:18:02,560
Yeah, it's not like you're gonna get the layout

1984
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:03,260
of the temple.

1985
01:18:03,420 --> 01:18:03,900
No.

1986
01:18:03,960 --> 01:18:05,960
It's not like a mission impossible mission.

1987
01:18:06,760 --> 01:18:11,060
You could, I guess if you knew the sequence of events

1988
01:18:11,060 --> 01:18:15,380
and you could utilize, have your parents help you,

1989
01:18:15,980 --> 01:18:18,380
you'd have to use every room of your house,

1990
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:19,840
assuming that you're in a house

1991
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:22,920
and then get up on the roof probably.

1992
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:23,380
Oh, you mean like.

1993
01:18:23,380 --> 01:18:24,860
I think you could do speed runs.

1994
01:18:24,920 --> 01:18:26,700
Obstacle course, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1995
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:28,700
Try to send a better call Saul

1996
01:18:28,700 --> 01:18:30,140
or he's like running them through.

1997
01:18:30,140 --> 01:18:30,840
I'm just thinking that's a lot.

1998
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:33,160
How you're gonna steal all the suits.

1999
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:35,060
Yeah, I think you could rig up,

2000
01:18:35,480 --> 01:18:37,940
but it'd be guesswork unless you knew somebody

2001
01:18:37,940 --> 01:18:40,620
who had the blueprints or something.

2002
01:18:40,660 --> 01:18:41,660
But if you know that person

2003
01:18:41,660 --> 01:18:43,840
then you probably have more inside information.

2004
01:18:44,200 --> 01:18:46,680
It could probably scam the system in some other way.

2005
01:18:46,760 --> 01:18:47,200
Yeah.

2006
01:18:47,200 --> 01:18:49,580
The only thing I think in all seriousness

2007
01:18:49,580 --> 01:18:52,020
that I could do to train for this as a kid

2008
01:18:52,020 --> 01:18:55,560
would be to desensitize me to being frightened.

2009
01:18:56,140 --> 01:18:57,860
That's the only thing that would help

2010
01:18:58,380 --> 01:18:59,740
is I don't know how you do that.

2011
01:18:59,940 --> 01:19:02,980
You just pay a friend to fucking jump out.

2012
01:19:03,080 --> 01:19:03,860
I get jitters so often.

2013
01:19:03,860 --> 01:19:04,400
Yeah, like every day.

2014
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:05,220
Yeah, scare me.

2015
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:07,260
A couple kids are gonna jump out at me during the day.

2016
01:19:07,560 --> 01:19:08,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2017
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:11,180
So you just have PTSD permanently going forward.

2018
01:19:11,340 --> 01:19:13,560
It would damage me, but I would be less reactive

2019
01:19:13,560 --> 01:19:14,780
when it would happen on the show.

2020
01:19:14,840 --> 01:19:16,620
Maybe you need a network of people

2021
01:19:16,620 --> 01:19:18,360
because I think there's a fear of the unknown.

2022
01:19:18,420 --> 01:19:19,320
They're wearing masks.

2023
01:19:19,380 --> 01:19:20,600
That's part of the scary thing.

2024
01:19:20,600 --> 01:19:22,600
And if you kind of know it's your friend,

2025
01:19:22,940 --> 01:19:24,300
even a shock gives you a little.

2026
01:19:24,380 --> 01:19:26,340
So you need to like get a friend

2027
01:19:26,340 --> 01:19:29,440
to get all the people he knows who you don't.

2028
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:32,400
Well, they need to coordinate with everyone, yeah.

2029
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:34,860
So they just need to coordinate and it can come from anywhere.

2030
01:19:35,140 --> 01:19:35,580
Yeah, yeah.

2031
01:19:35,640 --> 01:19:36,660
That's a good point

2032
01:19:36,660 --> 01:19:38,720
because the one thing I saw about the show

2033
01:19:38,720 --> 01:19:40,400
is that the temple guards were told,

2034
01:19:41,020 --> 01:19:43,000
switch up how you jump out.

2035
01:19:43,380 --> 01:19:46,060
Get them sometimes when they first get in the room,

2036
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:48,140
get them when they're almost out of the room

2037
01:19:48,140 --> 01:19:49,280
or halfway through.

2038
01:19:49,580 --> 01:19:52,580
I remember this very well that sometimes you go like,

2039
01:19:52,900 --> 01:19:54,140
okay, there's no temple guard.

2040
01:19:54,360 --> 01:19:54,660
Ah!

2041
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:56,960
And then sometimes it would happen immediately.

2042
01:19:57,680 --> 01:19:57,800
Yeah.

2043
01:19:57,860 --> 01:19:58,940
Because I would be freaked

2044
01:19:58,940 --> 01:20:00,760
because I would be like, oh, is it okay?

2045
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:01,820
Okay, okay, it's okay.

2046
01:20:01,940 --> 01:20:03,280
It's okay, it's all right.

2047
01:20:03,540 --> 01:20:05,860
And if we're all too afraid as viewers,

2048
01:20:06,060 --> 01:20:07,260
then imagine in person.

2049
01:20:07,860 --> 01:20:09,960
I can, yeah, I think of all the shows,

2050
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:12,020
I probably would have said I wanted to do this one the most,

2051
01:20:12,160 --> 01:20:13,580
but no way in reality.

2052
01:20:13,880 --> 01:20:15,040
Maybe you've been a little relieved

2053
01:20:15,040 --> 01:20:16,140
when you didn't make it all the way?

2054
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:18,220
Yeah, because this was the story of my life as a kid going,

2055
01:20:18,440 --> 01:20:20,480
oh, Alien Encounter is gonna open in Disney World.

2056
01:20:20,700 --> 01:20:21,840
Oh, Mike, it's open already.

2057
01:20:22,360 --> 01:20:23,280
Oh, it is.

2058
01:20:23,900 --> 01:20:26,820
Oh, I don't know.

2059
01:20:26,940 --> 01:20:28,020
I don't really know if I wanna,

2060
01:20:28,180 --> 01:20:28,580
are you sure?

2061
01:20:28,680 --> 01:20:30,120
It's right here, it's open, there's no line.

2062
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:31,620
Oh, you know what?

2063
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:32,560
And then I didn't go.

2064
01:20:32,820 --> 01:20:34,760
My little sister and my dad went.

2065
01:20:34,760 --> 01:20:37,440
I might need to have lunch.

2066
01:20:37,620 --> 01:20:38,160
It's 8.

2067
01:20:38,160 --> 01:20:38,580
30.

2068
01:20:38,940 --> 01:20:41,980
We had a giant buffet character breakfast.

2069
01:20:42,780 --> 01:20:42,780
Yeah.

2070
01:20:42,980 --> 01:20:43,380
Yeah.

2071
01:20:43,660 --> 01:20:46,440
But I can't even remember the lie I told to try to,

2072
01:20:46,460 --> 01:20:47,360
I did get out of it.

2073
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:48,440
I didn't go on Alien Encounter.

2074
01:20:48,500 --> 01:20:50,160
But we were sitting right there and I go, oh,

2075
01:20:50,300 --> 01:20:51,200
I think I said to like,

2076
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:55,020
it's too bad Disney Adventure said it opens in August.

2077
01:20:55,500 --> 01:20:56,220
Yeah, yeah.

2078
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:57,240
No, Mike, it's open now.

2079
01:20:57,240 --> 01:20:58,300
Well, as we tell ourselves.

2080
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:00,860
Jay, what was your level of frady catness?

2081
01:21:00,940 --> 01:21:03,240
Because we, the three of us have some,

2082
01:21:03,320 --> 01:21:07,620
we're somewhere on the scale of frady to not frady,

2083
01:21:08,740 --> 01:21:10,160
as cats are concerned.

2084
01:21:10,260 --> 01:21:10,860
Sure, sure.

2085
01:21:11,060 --> 01:21:13,520
What did, like, do you think you would have been able

2086
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:15,060
to handle this decently?

2087
01:21:15,320 --> 01:21:17,160
I feel like I probably would have been out

2088
01:21:17,160 --> 01:21:18,540
in one of the earlier two rounds.

2089
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:19,220
Yeah.

2090
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:21,780
I doubt I would have done well at the moat.

2091
01:21:22,180 --> 01:21:23,900
I might have done well with memorization,

2092
01:21:23,960 --> 01:21:25,660
but God knows when you're paired with some rando,

2093
01:21:25,940 --> 01:21:26,800
what their level is.

2094
01:21:27,140 --> 01:21:30,360
I would certainly get eliminated by the temple game.

2095
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:32,880
So it'd be a miracle if I was among the last team

2096
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:34,220
to be there, for sure.

2097
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:36,720
So you think you make it a little bit of the way.

2098
01:21:36,720 --> 01:21:37,420
Maybe, yeah.

2099
01:21:37,580 --> 01:21:39,920
I don't see myself, if I'm being perfectly honest,

2100
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:41,720
I don't see myself ever making it to the temple.

2101
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:44,240
If you ran the simulation a hundred times,

2102
01:21:44,440 --> 01:21:47,860
I might make it like twice and not win once.

2103
01:21:47,960 --> 01:21:48,820
That's probably me too.

2104
01:21:48,820 --> 01:21:51,700
Which how cool would that be to put in stats

2105
01:21:51,700 --> 01:21:53,720
about ourselves as children?

2106
01:21:54,020 --> 01:21:57,580
Run it through a reconstructed temple and see

2107
01:21:57,580 --> 01:21:59,000
what would happen.

2108
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:02,300
And then watch this, that it like, wait a minute,

2109
01:22:02,580 --> 01:22:05,040
I peed myself when the temple guard

2110
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:05,040
showed up?

2111
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:06,480
I drowned in the fucking

2112
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:07,320
styrofoam room?

2113
01:22:07,780 --> 01:22:08,600
I died?

2114
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:10,420
You're not supposed to die.

2115
01:22:10,680 --> 01:22:15,920
On run number 51, I got so scared that I started

2116
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:18,540
eating the packing peanuts and then choked.

2117
01:22:18,540 --> 01:22:19,820
I choked on the monkey head.

2118
01:22:20,080 --> 01:22:20,880
Fell to the bottom.

2119
01:22:21,340 --> 01:22:22,860
None of the crew stopped me.

2120
01:22:23,100 --> 01:22:24,700
Kirk and Jed didn't help me.

2121
01:22:25,260 --> 01:22:26,200
They laughed.

2122
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:31,300
The other children, they brought out all the children

2123
01:22:31,300 --> 01:22:32,440
waiting backstage.

2124
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:34,420
Hey kids, you gotta see this.

2125
01:22:35,020 --> 01:22:36,740
They all mocked me in unison.

2126
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:40,140
I just rewatched Moneyball recently.

2127
01:22:41,580 --> 01:22:43,900
Let me be like Bill Simmons, holds up.

2128
01:22:45,380 --> 01:22:46,680
Have you watched Moneyball?

2129
01:22:46,680 --> 01:22:50,400
I think I'd like to better now because I watched

2130
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:51,580
more baseball.

2131
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,940
So, and it's very much structured like a,

2132
01:22:54,040 --> 01:22:55,080
it's a little boring.

2133
01:22:55,640 --> 01:22:57,960
It's kind of structured like a baseball game.

2134
01:22:58,200 --> 01:22:59,680
Yeah, you can come and go.

2135
01:22:59,720 --> 01:23:01,520
You can talk to people, drink a beer.

2136
01:23:01,900 --> 01:23:03,320
But there is early scenes.

2137
01:23:03,720 --> 01:23:05,740
Jonah Hill is explaining to Brad Pitt, like,

2138
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:07,900
okay, here's what Saber Metrics is.

2139
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:09,880
All the players have all these different stats.

2140
01:23:10,220 --> 01:23:14,020
We need to add them up and we boil that down to one number.

2141
01:23:14,020 --> 01:23:16,120
We try to get one number for everyone.

2142
01:23:16,120 --> 01:23:20,140
So to do the Saber Metrics, I would like every kid

2143
01:23:20,140 --> 01:23:22,480
who ran Legends of the Hidden Temple,

2144
01:23:22,680 --> 01:23:24,920
like did the game show and it's like,

2145
01:23:24,920 --> 01:23:27,160
who is the best kid?

2146
01:23:27,580 --> 01:23:31,180
We know we can't afford a star on the Purple Parrots,

2147
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:33,880
but it's about building a smart Purple Parrots.

2148
01:23:33,900 --> 01:23:34,400
Yeah, exactly.

2149
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:36,300
We won't win this year.

2150
01:23:37,360 --> 01:23:40,100
But we won't win 11 years down the line.

2151
01:23:40,300 --> 01:23:42,480
It's a rebuilding year for the Purple Parrots.

2152
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,320
Oh shit, we gotta move to Las Vegas, all right.

2153
01:23:45,830 --> 01:23:49,320
By 1995, yeah, the kids are great.

2154
01:23:50,120 --> 01:23:51,220
But the Sadie of…

2155
01:23:51,580 --> 01:23:53,300
By episode 119.

2156
01:23:54,140 --> 01:23:56,100
There should have been a coach for each team

2157
01:23:56,100 --> 01:23:58,360
that was consistent with all the episodes.

2158
01:23:58,740 --> 01:23:59,360
Oh sure.

2159
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:01,020
Like almost like on The Voice or something.

2160
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:04,200
So you'd have, yeah, whatever, six coaches.

2161
01:24:04,660 --> 01:24:07,360
Well, I think that they, I think there maybe was

2162
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:14,020
that element on the reboot, on the CW reboot from…

2163
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:17,060
Yeah, I didn't forget about it

2164
01:24:17,060 --> 01:24:20,120
as much as I didn't know it happened at all.

2165
01:24:20,120 --> 01:24:22,600
I missed this 100%.

2166
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:25,620
Well, I remember, the only reason I remember it existed

2167
01:24:25,620 --> 01:24:28,660
is because whenever it was coming out at Comic-Con,

2168
01:24:28,920 --> 01:24:32,520
Olmec was on the show floor and I took a photo with him.

2169
01:24:32,720 --> 01:24:35,000
And that's the only reason it was on my radar

2170
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,780
as being around, because I was like, why is Olmec here?

2171
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:40,720
You found the casting notice at some point.

2172
01:24:40,940 --> 01:24:43,260
Yeah, I thought about submitting for it.

2173
01:24:43,260 --> 01:24:44,120
You were trying to get me to do it.

2174
01:24:44,120 --> 01:24:44,920
And you refused.

2175
01:24:45,380 --> 01:24:47,140
Yeah, because I was doing physical therapy,

2176
01:24:47,360 --> 01:24:49,140
I think for my shoulder at the time.

2177
01:24:49,260 --> 01:24:52,280
And I was like, I absolutely don't want to do legends.

2178
01:24:52,620 --> 01:24:53,100
It's always something.

2179
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:55,700
No, I'm full of ailments.

2180
01:24:56,400 --> 01:24:58,360
The podcasters, burden, yeah.

2181
01:24:58,620 --> 01:25:01,180
How's your, you guys peeing regularly lately?

2182
01:25:01,380 --> 01:25:02,540
How's that working?

2183
01:25:03,540 --> 01:25:03,900
Yeah, how's your streams?

2184
01:25:04,240 --> 01:25:05,720
The stream is, Scott, as I explained,

2185
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:07,300
the stream is fine, it's just when you're a man

2186
01:25:07,300 --> 01:25:10,060
and it's later 30s, sometimes it just dribbles out a bit

2187
01:25:10,060 --> 01:25:12,020
at the end, that's all, it's normal.

2188
01:25:12,540 --> 01:25:14,100
Django, you're our guest, you don't have to disclose,

2189
01:25:14,100 --> 01:25:15,080
that's how your streams look.

2190
01:25:15,340 --> 01:25:17,000
But if you want, I'm just gonna give you the floor.

2191
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:18,020
Well, just check my website,

2192
01:25:18,360 --> 01:25:19,880
it should have all my pertinent medical details.

2193
01:25:20,180 --> 01:25:20,420
Okay, great.

2194
01:25:20,420 --> 01:25:21,680
Oh, great, that's very nice of you.

2195
01:25:21,680 --> 01:25:21,720
Oh, cool.

2196
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:23,440
Just get in front of it, put it out there.

2197
01:25:23,460 --> 01:25:24,620
Board type and all that jazz.

2198
01:25:24,780 --> 01:25:27,540
Like my chart, but exclusively for you

2199
01:25:27,540 --> 01:25:30,600
and your comedy, comedy dates and blood type

2200
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:32,980
and the miles per hour on your stream.

2201
01:25:34,040 --> 01:25:35,140
Yeah, yeah.

2202
01:25:35,900 --> 01:25:37,100
Horsepower, I don't know, however you want.

2203
01:25:37,100 --> 01:25:38,120
They're measuring quarks.

2204
01:25:38,280 --> 01:25:39,360
Okay, got it, got it.

2205
01:25:41,780 --> 01:25:45,600
I, yeah, it came back and I think it may have had

2206
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:48,340
the element that Kirk Fogg was your mentor.

2207
01:25:48,340 --> 01:25:52,040
They felt like they had to keep him in there somewhere,

2208
01:25:52,440 --> 01:25:54,160
even though the host changed.

2209
01:25:58,620 --> 01:26:00,100
in the movie.

2210
01:26:00,380 --> 01:26:02,480
Made for TV, scripted movie.

2211
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:04,420
Made for Nickelodeon movie,

2212
01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:08,140
which came out in November 2016.

2213
01:26:08,140 --> 01:26:09,800
Oh wow, I had no idea.

2214
01:26:10,220 --> 01:26:11,500
A cursed time.

2215
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:18,660
But I watched this, I skimmed through this a little bit.

2216
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:21,060
Also on Paramount Plus.

2217
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:25,440
Not Yank Down, the recent shows Yank Down.

2218
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:28,640
That one is still making them a hefty profit, I'm sure.

2219
01:26:29,260 --> 01:26:29,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2220
01:26:29,480 --> 01:26:31,160
People are watching that one every day.

2221
01:26:31,500 --> 01:26:33,380
And then, gotta keep that.

2222
01:26:33,660 --> 01:26:35,880
No, weirdly this whole thing is on the back

2223
01:26:35,880 --> 01:26:37,800
of Legends of the Hidden Temple movie.

2224
01:26:37,800 --> 01:26:40,480
If Legends goes, now we're gonna sunk.

2225
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:41,680
It all implodes.

2226
01:26:42,020 --> 01:26:43,660
And we gotta sell, we gotta merge.

2227
01:26:43,860 --> 01:26:48,520
Mission Impossible, Top Guns, Legends, scripted movie.

2228
01:26:48,780 --> 01:26:50,940
That's what's holding up Paramount Plus.

2229
01:26:51,280 --> 01:26:54,720
Kirk Fogg kind of the Tom Cruise of his time,

2230
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:57,300
because he really was him on the rope.

2231
01:26:57,400 --> 01:26:58,440
I don't know if you can tell.

2232
01:26:58,800 --> 01:26:59,820
No CGI there.

2233
01:27:00,180 --> 01:27:03,680
He insisted, I'm doing the swing every episode.

2234
01:27:03,800 --> 01:27:06,080
And if it kills me, it kills me.

2235
01:27:06,740 --> 01:27:08,000
Gotta go out swinging.

2236
01:27:09,700 --> 01:27:10,960
I watched a little of this thing.

2237
01:27:11,040 --> 01:27:13,360
It exists in a confusing universe and timeline

2238
01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:16,200
where the Hidden Temple is a theme park now.

2239
01:27:16,220 --> 01:27:19,600
It's kind of a chintzy theme park where Kirk Fogg works.

2240
01:27:19,780 --> 01:27:23,120
And they use his real name over and over again.

2241
01:27:23,380 --> 01:27:25,460
And he's presented as like a cheese ball.

2242
01:27:25,500 --> 01:27:27,260
Like the show is not very good.

2243
01:27:27,380 --> 01:27:30,760
It's a very theme parky animal actors kind of show.

2244
01:27:31,180 --> 01:27:33,280
But then there's this kid who's like insist like,

2245
01:27:33,500 --> 01:27:35,640
yeah, I know you can say it's fake if you want,

2246
01:27:35,640 --> 01:27:37,000
but the legend is real.

2247
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:38,100
I know it is.

2248
01:27:38,400 --> 01:27:39,260
And I'm gonna find it.

2249
01:27:39,260 --> 01:27:42,400
And then like, and he talks to Kirk who like believes,

2250
01:27:42,620 --> 01:27:44,360
no, I've always known it's real.

2251
01:27:44,700 --> 01:27:47,620
And you're like, wait, but does the show exist?

2252
01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:53,100
Why do they all know who he is and his full name?

2253
01:27:53,560 --> 01:27:57,160
And it's kind of strange.

2254
01:27:57,300 --> 01:27:58,060
And then in the end,

2255
01:27:58,100 --> 01:28:01,100
Kirk gets his wish to go live in the temple.

2256
01:28:01,880 --> 01:28:03,460
That's what it seems like.

2257
01:28:03,460 --> 01:28:05,860
He doesn't want to do this minimum wage

2258
01:28:05,860 --> 01:28:07,180
theme park job anymore.

2259
01:28:07,400 --> 01:28:09,260
So the door closes and seals.

2260
01:28:09,260 --> 01:28:11,120
Say goodbye to your wife and kids, Kirk.

2261
01:28:11,720 --> 01:28:14,280
You're doing your dream of living inside a temple.

2262
01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:15,960
It's close encounters.

2263
01:28:16,340 --> 01:28:19,940
He like, his wife and kids are nothing compared

2264
01:28:19,940 --> 01:28:21,680
to the chance for adventure.

2265
01:28:21,940 --> 01:28:24,220
It's like when Bumblebee says he wants to stay on earth

2266
01:28:24,220 --> 01:28:25,480
with Sam Witwicky.

2267
01:28:27,800 --> 01:28:29,800
I watched the end of it yesterday.

2268
01:28:30,120 --> 01:28:30,520
Oh, I see.

2269
01:28:30,980 --> 01:28:33,060
The Bummi oddly a little more on your mind.

2270
01:28:33,700 --> 01:28:34,280
It's difficult.

2271
01:28:34,300 --> 01:28:35,160
Sam before wrestling.

2272
01:28:35,420 --> 01:28:39,400
The premise of the movie is not dissimilar

2273
01:28:39,400 --> 01:28:41,840
to the Revenge of the Mummy Ride in Florida,

2274
01:28:42,040 --> 01:28:45,620
where it's like, okay, this is the set of a movie,

2275
01:28:45,620 --> 01:28:48,560
but also we've stumbled upon a real temple.

2276
01:28:49,360 --> 01:28:49,800
You know?

2277
01:28:49,900 --> 01:28:53,280
And also the Brendan Fraser movies exist in this world,

2278
01:28:53,280 --> 01:28:54,580
but so do curses.

2279
01:28:54,820 --> 01:28:56,920
I love that they keep Kirk in the mix.

2280
01:28:57,380 --> 01:28:57,760
Yeah.

2281
01:28:58,080 --> 01:28:59,240
It feels very thoughtful.

2282
01:29:00,040 --> 01:29:02,120
Heretical for them to pretend he never existed.

2283
01:29:02,340 --> 01:29:04,060
He's like the only, him and Ulmer are like

2284
01:29:04,060 --> 01:29:05,660
the only two consistent things you remember

2285
01:29:05,660 --> 01:29:06,480
about that show, really.

2286
01:29:06,760 --> 01:29:09,780
Yeah, pretty, yeah, that is the franchise to me.

2287
01:29:09,800 --> 01:29:12,400
The idea of a temple is still kind of generic,

2288
01:29:12,520 --> 01:29:15,180
but if there aren't these two guys involved,

2289
01:29:15,320 --> 01:29:16,020
then what do you have?

2290
01:29:16,280 --> 01:29:17,660
And this one, they make him act.

2291
01:29:17,980 --> 01:29:20,140
He has this other, you're pushing into it.

2292
01:29:20,140 --> 01:29:24,480
It is played like, you know, it's true, all of it.

2293
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:29,720
He gets to do that to this kid, making him like,

2294
01:29:29,720 --> 01:29:31,580
I know your friends make fun of you,

2295
01:29:31,580 --> 01:29:33,560
but the legends of the Hidden Temple are real.

2296
01:29:33,720 --> 01:29:34,800
I know they are.

2297
01:29:35,100 --> 01:29:36,640
Your friends make fun of you for being a fan of a show

2298
01:29:36,640 --> 01:29:37,880
that was on 20 years ago.

2299
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:42,180
Yeah, I don't know.

2300
01:29:42,500 --> 01:29:44,140
I like seeing it.

2301
01:29:44,560 --> 01:29:46,280
It makes me smile to see Kirk.

2302
01:29:46,760 --> 01:29:47,800
The show's fun.

2303
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:49,680
It's fun to think about for a little bit.

2304
01:29:50,240 --> 01:29:51,200
Fun to hear the lore.

2305
01:29:51,320 --> 01:29:54,100
We missed how Kirk said that a girl threw up

2306
01:29:54,100 --> 01:29:56,520
in the pit of despair at one point.

2307
01:29:56,560 --> 01:29:59,760
They had to stop the taping, make sure she was okay,

2308
01:29:59,800 --> 01:30:00,920
and then keep going.

2309
01:30:01,580 --> 01:30:04,540
They do still owe the remats of material.

2310
01:30:04,540 --> 01:30:05,300
Yeah, of course she had to finish the goddamn show.

2311
01:30:06,980 --> 01:30:10,700
Statistically, there was probably more throw-up incidences

2312
01:30:10,700 --> 01:30:13,040
than teams that won every season.

2313
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:16,560
Yeah, that temple was just a fucking crawling germ factory.

2314
01:30:17,060 --> 01:30:19,560
Scared children vomiting in various crevices.

2315
01:30:19,740 --> 01:30:22,140
Yeah, the bathroom, kids might have had

2316
01:30:22,140 --> 01:30:26,760
nervous shit in that tiny bathroom in the holding area.

2317
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:28,560
So many kids.

2318
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:30,520
It was a miserable taping experience, I'm sure.

2319
01:30:31,140 --> 01:30:33,220
Jed, got that problem again.

2320
01:30:33,440 --> 01:30:34,000
Jed.

2321
01:30:35,060 --> 01:30:38,180
No, you can clean up the bathroom with the makeup on.

2322
01:30:38,240 --> 01:30:40,500
We don't give a shit, okay?

2323
01:30:40,500 --> 01:30:42,140
You just can't be on the cameras.

2324
01:30:43,460 --> 01:30:44,940
Can't you be calming these kids down?

2325
01:30:45,140 --> 01:30:46,200
Learn balloon animals.

2326
01:30:46,420 --> 01:30:49,040
Jed, Jed, start doing balloon animals.

2327
01:30:49,340 --> 01:30:50,760
Jed, you're the counselor now.

2328
01:30:50,760 --> 01:30:52,620
You're the balloon animal counselor.

2329
01:30:53,820 --> 01:30:56,440
Get a DJ set up, do some songs.

2330
01:30:57,580 --> 01:30:59,780
Have him do the chicken dance, that'll keep him calm.

2331
01:31:01,180 --> 01:31:02,180
Have we missed anything?

2332
01:31:02,300 --> 01:31:03,700
Have we missed any big ticket items?

2333
01:31:03,700 --> 01:31:06,100
I just wanted to say one of the titles of another episode.

2334
01:31:06,120 --> 01:31:07,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah, go for it.

2335
01:31:07,120 --> 01:31:09,060
The mush pot hat of Johnny Appleseed.

2336
01:31:09,920 --> 01:31:10,600
The mush pot?

2337
01:31:10,640 --> 01:31:11,520
The mush pot.

2338
01:31:11,860 --> 01:31:16,500
Is that like where your cauldron you used to make apple mash?

2339
01:31:16,720 --> 01:31:19,100
Yeah, whatever he wore on his head.

2340
01:31:19,100 --> 01:31:20,900
At least that's what I remember

2341
01:31:20,900 --> 01:31:23,000
as far as the legend of Johnny Appleseed.

2342
01:31:23,060 --> 01:31:24,440
Yeah, I don't remember him having a hat,

2343
01:31:24,600 --> 01:31:25,700
but I guess I haven't really thought about it.

2344
01:31:25,700 --> 01:31:27,120
I don't think about Johnny Appleseed that much.

2345
01:31:27,660 --> 01:31:29,040
We had like a pan.

2346
01:31:29,040 --> 01:31:31,200
Yeah, it was a cauldron so he could do apple things.

2347
01:31:32,100 --> 01:31:32,640
That's a mush pot.

2348
01:31:32,640 --> 01:31:36,200
It was a mush pot, all right, come your ass down.

2349
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:37,760
Jason, you should know what a mush pot is.

2350
01:31:37,780 --> 01:31:39,100
Listeners, you can't see us right now,

2351
01:31:39,140 --> 01:31:41,420
he's standing and shouting and pointing at us.

2352
01:31:41,620 --> 01:31:44,920
He's slicing open the couch and pulling the stuffing out.

2353
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:46,640
I didn't even know he had a knife on him.

2354
01:31:46,700 --> 01:31:48,800
Yeah, I do, the knife of Michael Carlton.

2355
01:31:49,860 --> 01:31:52,120
The rarely used knife of Michael Carlton.

2356
01:31:52,680 --> 01:31:54,100
The podcasters box cutter.

2357
01:31:56,900 --> 01:31:57,020
Yeah.

2358
01:31:57,020 --> 01:31:58,800
I'm surprised, Jason, I am surprised you'd be like,

2359
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:00,800
oh, you've never cooked something in a mush pot before?

2360
01:32:01,540 --> 01:32:03,220
Like, that's an East Coast thing, I guess.

2361
01:32:07,580 --> 01:32:09,600
Williamsburg, yeah, we use a mush pot all the time.

2362
01:32:09,640 --> 01:32:14,120
Growing up in the colonies, being in the Boy Scouts,

2363
01:32:14,260 --> 01:32:17,920
we certainly did a lot of interesting dishes

2364
01:32:17,920 --> 01:32:24,060
in Dutch ovens, which is just a large cast iron guy.

2365
01:32:24,280 --> 01:32:27,460
You can throw into a burning fire, you know?

2366
01:32:28,180 --> 01:32:29,380
But you didn't, they should,

2367
01:32:29,620 --> 01:32:32,020
like the scouts should teach you that, you know,

2368
01:32:32,360 --> 01:32:34,380
if you're in a situation, if you're overheating

2369
01:32:34,380 --> 01:32:35,800
and you don't have your hat,

2370
01:32:36,100 --> 01:32:37,400
if you do have your pot,

2371
01:32:37,820 --> 01:32:39,560
a mush pot can easily be your hat.

2372
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:40,120
Right.

2373
01:32:41,700 --> 01:32:45,000
And that you should spread apple seeds wherever you go,

2374
01:32:45,180 --> 01:32:45,900
just to make it look like the world.

2375
01:32:45,900 --> 01:32:48,180
You can just do that automatically, you know?

2376
01:32:48,240 --> 01:32:51,060
Well, that's nice, just to keep the world beautiful.

2377
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:53,400
Also, we didn't, maybe the one other thing

2378
01:32:53,400 --> 01:32:55,500
is that the reboot ended up on the CW,

2379
01:32:55,700 --> 01:32:57,500
but it was supposed to be on Quibi.

2380
01:32:57,900 --> 01:32:58,140
Oh.

2381
01:32:58,140 --> 01:32:58,660
Yeah, right.

2382
01:32:58,960 --> 01:33:01,420
Which itself almost is sort of lit.

2383
01:33:01,440 --> 01:33:03,140
10 minute episodes of Legends would be interesting.

2384
01:33:03,280 --> 01:33:04,700
You just cut all the chaff

2385
01:33:04,700 --> 01:33:06,500
and basically just go straight to the temple, I imagine.

2386
01:33:06,580 --> 01:33:08,300
Yeah, that's true, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2387
01:33:08,300 --> 01:33:10,300
They probably all should have been.

2388
01:33:10,300 --> 01:33:10,620
Yeah.

2389
01:33:10,840 --> 01:33:12,560
Well, again, this would have saved,

2390
01:33:12,780 --> 01:33:15,020
Paramount Plus is riding on Legends and Quibi,

2391
01:33:15,020 --> 01:33:16,460
I think it would have saved Quibi.

2392
01:33:16,740 --> 01:33:16,980
Yeah.

2393
01:33:17,220 --> 01:33:20,360
Would you, can I ask, if the offer was on the table,

2394
01:33:20,380 --> 01:33:22,600
you'd have to do anything other than somebody called you

2395
01:33:22,600 --> 01:33:24,280
and said, I need you to help me out

2396
01:33:24,280 --> 01:33:25,360
on Legends of the Hidden Temple

2397
01:33:25,360 --> 01:33:27,320
and it's the CW version's back,

2398
01:33:27,640 --> 01:33:29,400
it's tomorrow and you're available.

2399
01:33:29,540 --> 01:33:30,340
Would you want to do it?

2400
01:33:30,400 --> 01:33:31,240
Is it a paid position?

2401
01:33:32,020 --> 01:33:35,760
You get, you get 150, it's non-union,

2402
01:33:35,920 --> 01:33:37,340
but you get like, let's say you get like $300.

2403
01:33:37,340 --> 01:33:39,200
I'm not breaking the WGA strike

2404
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:40,760
to go work on Legends of the Hidden Temple,

2405
01:33:41,220 --> 01:33:42,240
the second reboot.

2406
01:33:42,740 --> 01:33:44,640
That's my stance, you hear that, WGA?

2407
01:33:45,160 --> 01:33:45,560
No.

2408
01:33:45,560 --> 01:33:48,240
Well, look, it's, you know, it's an iffy,

2409
01:33:48,380 --> 01:33:51,560
you could call it research, I know we read a legend,

2410
01:33:51,640 --> 01:33:52,800
but is that really writing?

2411
01:33:55,320 --> 01:33:57,500
I'm a union man, I'm standing with my union on this one.

2412
01:33:57,560 --> 01:33:57,960
Okay.

2413
01:33:58,100 --> 01:34:00,360
But in the, let's jump ahead.

2414
01:34:00,520 --> 01:34:00,960
In a vacuum.

2415
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:02,180
After we get a perfect deal.

2416
01:34:02,980 --> 01:34:04,900
I guess it depends on how much I'm getting paid.

2417
01:34:05,700 --> 01:34:06,560
Not even $300.

2418
01:34:07,040 --> 01:34:07,440
Yes.

2419
01:34:13,200 --> 01:34:13,600
Yes.

2420
01:34:13,880 --> 01:34:14,280
100?

2421
01:34:14,940 --> 01:34:16,320
Okay, 100 is the line.

2422
01:34:16,380 --> 01:34:18,080
So win a prize though.

2423
01:34:18,280 --> 01:34:20,180
Well, it depends what the prize is, I guess.

2424
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:21,520
It's a Huffy bike.

2425
01:34:22,360 --> 01:34:22,760
No.

2426
01:34:22,920 --> 01:34:25,920
If it's an adult road bike, maybe.

2427
01:34:26,360 --> 01:34:28,680
Yeah, the Huffys look, the Huffys are maybe a little.

2428
01:34:28,980 --> 01:34:29,980
Does Huffy still make bikes?

2429
01:34:30,440 --> 01:34:31,600
I think they might be around.

2430
01:34:32,080 --> 01:34:33,320
I'm not even, is it all kids?

2431
01:34:33,340 --> 01:34:34,880
Acquired by Yamaha at some point.

2432
01:34:35,080 --> 01:34:37,080
Right, is there some sort of absorbing of.

2433
01:34:37,480 --> 01:34:40,460
Yamaha is now owned by the Saudi Wealth Fund.

2434
01:34:40,600 --> 01:34:41,660
Well, that's, yeah.

2435
01:34:41,980 --> 01:34:43,280
I wonder if Huffy is an independent company.

2436
01:34:43,280 --> 01:34:45,120
So is this show, all things are.

2437
01:34:45,120 --> 01:34:46,520
All things are, yeah.

2438
01:34:46,780 --> 01:34:49,000
We didn't tell everybody we got bought a while back.

2439
01:34:49,660 --> 01:34:51,660
Yeah, so yeah, I'm doing, I'm.

2440
01:34:51,660 --> 01:34:52,460
You're doing it no matter what.

2441
01:34:52,720 --> 01:34:53,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2442
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:54,960
I also wanna do floor is lava.

2443
01:34:55,640 --> 01:34:56,660
I think I could do it.

2444
01:34:56,940 --> 01:34:57,300
Yeah?

2445
01:34:57,580 --> 01:34:59,400
It looks hard and it looks like you get hurt a little bit,

2446
01:34:59,400 --> 01:35:00,400
but I think I could do it.

2447
01:35:00,560 --> 01:35:04,140
Well, you need to just get like a video reel ready to go

2448
01:35:04,140 --> 01:35:06,620
of you just like tumbling and jumping

2449
01:35:07,220 --> 01:35:10,340
and I guess mainly not getting scared

2450
01:35:10,340 --> 01:35:12,760
by people jumping out at you.

2451
01:35:13,320 --> 01:35:14,080
That'd be a great reel.

2452
01:35:14,320 --> 01:35:17,920
Just you blase as people try to scare you.

2453
01:35:19,400 --> 01:35:22,760
I'm Mike Carlson and this is my non-shocked reel.

2454
01:35:22,920 --> 01:35:25,540
This is my standing my ground reel.

2455
01:35:25,580 --> 01:35:28,200
Iron Mike, that's the name I want.

2456
01:35:29,040 --> 01:35:30,160
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

2457
01:35:30,160 --> 01:35:31,480
I guess that doesn't sound like.

2458
01:35:32,020 --> 01:35:33,720
Well look, if you need to pull a gun out

2459
01:35:33,720 --> 01:35:35,060
over the course of it, then you do.

2460
01:35:35,460 --> 01:35:36,800
Whatever it takes to stand your ground.

2461
01:35:36,840 --> 01:35:39,540
To prove that I am tough enough to be on a game show

2462
01:35:39,540 --> 01:35:40,400
and make $200.

2463
01:35:41,220 --> 01:35:43,620
So I'm in, are you in?

2464
01:35:44,180 --> 01:35:44,920
Yeah, I'll do it.

2465
01:35:45,300 --> 01:35:45,340
Okay.

2466
01:35:45,440 --> 01:35:48,200
I think I'd be pretty awful at it.

2467
01:35:49,300 --> 01:35:49,360
Yeah.

2468
01:35:49,780 --> 01:35:50,640
Although I don't know.

2469
01:35:50,780 --> 01:35:51,640
I don't know that I would be good either.

2470
01:35:51,780 --> 01:35:52,100
I'm just saying.

2471
01:35:52,160 --> 01:35:53,000
Wait, what am I saying?

2472
01:35:53,060 --> 01:35:53,880
I hate haunts.

2473
01:35:54,160 --> 01:35:55,420
That's probably why I hate it.

2474
01:35:55,620 --> 01:35:56,140
That I don't wanna do it.

2475
01:35:56,140 --> 01:35:57,060
And Jason would be out too.

2476
01:35:57,140 --> 01:36:00,000
Yeah, no, I would take the $300 a day

2477
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:04,640
to come up with like the tissue box shoes of Howard Hughes.

2478
01:36:05,100 --> 01:36:06,280
Oh, you'd write on it.

2479
01:36:06,280 --> 01:36:06,480
You'd scam.

2480
01:36:06,480 --> 01:36:07,020
Yeah, I would.

2481
01:36:07,760 --> 01:36:09,340
Oh no, no, after the perfect.

2482
01:36:09,340 --> 01:36:10,500
After, after, after.

2483
01:36:10,920 --> 01:36:11,240
Okay, sorry.

2484
01:36:11,920 --> 01:36:13,020
Come on, you'd admit it.

2485
01:36:13,200 --> 01:36:13,640
You'd scam right now.

2486
01:36:13,660 --> 01:36:15,520
The tissue box shoes of Howard Hughes.

2487
01:36:15,540 --> 01:36:17,980
Jason's making $300 a week to come up with legends.

2488
01:36:18,280 --> 01:36:19,920
Wait, well, he noticed $300 a day.

2489
01:36:19,920 --> 01:36:20,740
No, not for a week.

2490
01:36:21,320 --> 01:36:21,420
No, no.

2491
01:36:21,420 --> 01:36:22,700
It's for performing on the show.

2492
01:36:24,120 --> 01:36:25,080
No, you're getting Jed rate.

2493
01:36:25,120 --> 01:36:26,500
You're getting Jed 1983 rates.

2494
01:36:26,520 --> 01:36:29,340
Can I lease right from home and just hop on Zooms?

2495
01:36:29,340 --> 01:36:29,820
No, you're coming in.

2496
01:36:29,980 --> 01:36:30,780
Oh no.

2497
01:36:30,940 --> 01:36:32,340
And they're shooting down in Culver City.

2498
01:36:32,720 --> 01:36:35,540
Oh man, that's supposed to be a part of town.

2499
01:36:35,760 --> 01:36:37,260
Yeah, and it's not at the Sony lot.

2500
01:36:37,280 --> 01:36:38,300
It's a different place.

2501
01:36:38,760 --> 01:36:39,820
And they're doing it.

2502
01:36:40,160 --> 01:36:42,880
And it's outside on the hottest days of the year.

2503
01:36:43,140 --> 01:36:45,240
Yeah, legend of the hidden temple in the sun.

2504
01:36:46,860 --> 01:36:49,160
Finally, the newest obstacle, heat stroke.

2505
01:36:52,620 --> 01:36:53,700
Jenga, do you feel like you have,

2506
01:36:53,920 --> 01:36:56,300
if you had to get boiled down to one item,

2507
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:58,640
it's 200 years from now.

2508
01:37:01,380 --> 01:37:02,720
Ooh, that's a good question.

2509
01:37:03,280 --> 01:37:03,980
My phone?

2510
01:37:04,440 --> 01:37:05,740
For all of us, it's just our phones.

2511
01:37:05,860 --> 01:37:07,940
Yeah, the sad thing about today,

2512
01:37:08,360 --> 01:37:09,720
the phone of the guy.

2513
01:37:10,060 --> 01:37:10,580
Yeah.

2514
01:37:12,180 --> 01:37:14,760
The nondescript phone of Jango Gold.

2515
01:37:20,340 --> 01:37:22,200
from the other dirty cases.

2516
01:37:22,440 --> 01:37:23,940
Yes, it's a clear dirty case

2517
01:37:23,940 --> 01:37:25,920
as opposed to the black dirty case

2518
01:37:25,920 --> 01:37:27,220
or the gray dirty case.

2519
01:37:28,340 --> 01:37:32,140
Well, thank you for weaving part of your legend

2520
01:37:32,140 --> 01:37:33,020
here with us today.

2521
01:37:33,020 --> 01:37:34,660
Yes, this is part of all our legends.

2522
01:37:34,920 --> 01:37:37,080
Yes, for adding a chapter to all of our legends.

2523
01:37:37,620 --> 01:37:40,040
Jango Gold and your nondescript phone,

2524
01:37:40,180 --> 01:37:41,860
you survived podcast the ride.

2525
01:37:42,700 --> 01:37:45,240
But hey, you're not walking away empty handed.

2526
01:37:45,340 --> 01:37:45,880
Ooh, what am I getting?

2527
01:37:45,940 --> 01:37:47,420
Let's exit the, while you're getting the,

2528
01:37:48,100 --> 01:37:49,720
you get to do a plug.

2529
01:37:49,860 --> 01:37:50,360
Oh, great.

2530
01:37:50,580 --> 01:37:52,640
That's a prize worth all the huffies in America.

2531
01:37:52,880 --> 01:37:54,580
That's a, yeah, it's a prize in a way.

2532
01:37:54,700 --> 01:37:56,340
And there's some greater,

2533
01:37:57,220 --> 01:37:58,780
in two years it'll be a prize

2534
01:37:58,780 --> 01:38:00,620
when there's awareness of what you're doing.

2535
01:38:00,860 --> 01:38:01,300
Absolutely.

2536
01:38:01,880 --> 01:38:05,300
Yeah, listeners, by the time this episode airs,

2537
01:38:05,300 --> 01:38:08,040
my standup special entitled Bag of Tricks

2538
01:38:08,040 --> 01:38:09,640
will be available on YouTube.

2539
01:38:09,820 --> 01:38:12,460
You can probably just Google Jango Gold Bag of Tricks

2540
01:38:12,460 --> 01:38:15,600
or go to YouTube and go to my account name

2541
01:38:15,600 --> 01:38:17,800
which is at Jango Industries.

2542
01:38:17,820 --> 01:38:20,700
Go there, subscribe, watch the special.

2543
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:21,300
It'll be great.

2544
01:38:21,360 --> 01:38:22,080
It'll be really good.

2545
01:38:22,840 --> 01:38:24,980
And it's just you, there's no temple guards.

2546
01:38:25,160 --> 01:38:28,260
Very, very few temple guards in the special.

2547
01:38:28,700 --> 01:38:30,360
Although I'm still editing it, so who knows?

2548
01:38:30,420 --> 01:38:32,660
Maybe I could drop something in at the last minute.

2549
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:33,200
Yeah.

2550
01:38:33,200 --> 01:38:34,880
Yeah, I mean, isn't that a night, you know,

2551
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:38,260
we're trying to reinvent standup specials here and there

2552
01:38:38,260 --> 01:38:39,980
and you know, maybe I do it without an audience.

2553
01:38:40,040 --> 01:38:41,680
Maybe I do it with jump scares.

2554
01:38:42,080 --> 01:38:44,120
With spooky, yeah.

2555
01:38:44,660 --> 01:38:45,480
Spooky monsters.

2556
01:38:45,960 --> 01:38:46,980
Scary guys in masks trying to throw me off.

2557
01:38:46,980 --> 01:38:49,660
The first ever standup special in a haunted house.

2558
01:38:50,060 --> 01:38:50,880
It's a pretty good idea.

2559
01:38:50,940 --> 01:38:53,740
Spooky Bag of Tricks by Jango Gold.

2560
01:38:54,300 --> 01:38:55,020
Oh yeah.

2561
01:38:55,100 --> 01:38:55,100
Wow.

2562
01:38:55,280 --> 01:38:57,320
Well, you got your scary name already ready to go.

2563
01:38:57,620 --> 01:38:59,440
So the rest, the rest writes itself.

2564
01:38:59,700 --> 01:39:01,520
Besides that you have to now write

2565
01:39:01,520 --> 01:39:03,680
an hour of spooky standup material.

2566
01:39:04,580 --> 01:39:05,940
About haunted houses.

2567
01:39:05,940 --> 01:39:07,580
If I start now, I'll be ready by Halloween.

2568
01:39:08,420 --> 01:39:09,440
Yeah, well, get cooking.

2569
01:39:09,560 --> 01:39:11,680
I think you got a hell of a gimmick on your hands.

01:39:27,940 --> 01:39:30,420
This episode not taped before a studio audience.

2579
01:39:31,520 --> 01:39:33,560
Nickelodeon Studios, Universal Orlando Florida.

2580
01:39:33,560 --> 01:39:35,940
And this one did take 10 hours to do.

2581
01:39:36,140 --> 01:39:36,640
Yeah, yeah.

2582
01:39:36,700 --> 01:39:38,000
We cut it together into two.

2583
01:39:38,180 --> 01:39:40,340
You're some 40 other guests in here.

2584
01:39:40,420 --> 01:39:40,820
Yeah.

2585
01:39:40,880 --> 01:39:41,320
Bang them out.

2586
01:39:41,560 --> 01:39:42,920
Yeah, yeah, we did the, we like,

2587
01:39:43,060 --> 01:39:46,320
we did all the regular fact parts and then everybody's

2588
01:39:46,320 --> 01:39:48,980
and then we, we shoveled them out, all had pizza.

2589
01:39:49,200 --> 01:39:50,980
And then we all did the riff part.

2590
01:39:51,100 --> 01:39:52,780
So if anything funny that happened.

2591
01:39:52,920 --> 01:39:53,480
It was cut out.

2592
01:39:53,520 --> 01:39:54,800
Oh yeah, we did it out of order.

2593
01:39:54,860 --> 01:39:57,740
The last four episodes with guests, we've all been,

2594
01:39:57,840 --> 01:39:58,800
and then there was some of the same.

2595
01:39:58,820 --> 01:40:00,740
There was an hour of American gladiators anecdotes

2596
01:40:00,740 --> 01:40:01,340
I cut out too.

2597
01:40:01,360 --> 01:40:01,860
Yeah, yeah.

2598
01:40:01,860 --> 01:40:03,100
