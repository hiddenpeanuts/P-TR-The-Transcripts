1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Dog.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Ah, there you are.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
The volunteers for our frightfully late show.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
The happy hosts are beginning to materialize.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
They've been backstage sucking fog.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
As you leave tonight, there's a little matter we forgot to mention.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Beware of hitchhiking Valencia teens.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Now, live and live, screaming from die nasty type frighter,

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
it's Hot Gas the Fright Line!

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Hello!

12
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Hello!

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Hello!

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Hi!

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
It's wonderful to see you, happy Halloween.

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Welcome to Hauntcast the Fright Live.

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
We could do an opening joke or we could get right to the costumes.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
What do you say?

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I think a lot needs to be explained here.

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Let's start with Jason.

21
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Wait, wait, what were the names?

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Slash and Burn.

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
No, no, no, Slash and Burn.

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Okay, okay, great.

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Gag and Slash and Burn, ladies and gentlemen.

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Slash and Drain.

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Slash and Drain.

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Gag and Slash and Drain.

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Gag and Slash and Drain.

30
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Yeah, I'm the Sleepy Time Tea Bear.

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Cheers.

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Hey!

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Yeah.

34
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Oh, no, yeah.

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
There is no character you should be playing more...

36
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I know!

37
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
...than this bear in a night shirt.

38
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Wow.

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
And if you really wanted to go full tilts, just sleep through the rest of the show.

40
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Well, look, the hit's coming back off in a few minutes or else I'm going to pass out from me.

41
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Or it's just going to lull me to sleep.

42
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
A lot of these costumes might need to be bailed on for various reasons.

43
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You'll learn mine soon.

44
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
But first, Jason, can you just, can you ask me what I am?

45
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Yeah, because I am wondering.

46
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Scott, what are you?

47
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'm Nimgaloo!

48
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Oh, now I see it.

49
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Yes! Yes!

50
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
My dream came true, I'm Nimgaloo!

51
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Oh, if this is a foreign language to anyone,

52
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I've had an ongoing obsession with a character from a film that I will assuredly never see

53
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
called Epic, but I know in my heart, in my heart,

54
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
that Nimgaloo is a wise, well, caterpillar or something,

55
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
and he's played by Steven Tyler,

56
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
the great voice actor Steven Tyler.

57
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Get well soon, Steven.

58
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
And now I'm him-a-ray!

59
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Potential for injury very high.

60
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Also, I don't know if the listeners can hear this as this becomes a podcast episode,

61
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
but there is a big fan that is powering this,

62
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
and that is not conducive to live show recording,

63
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
and I think I learned how to shut it off,

64
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
so I think what we'll do is just kind of slowly deflate,

65
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
and then I'll be able to sit, it's still going to be puffy, don't worry,

66
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:25,000
but then I'll be able to sit, you know, in probably like eight minutes or so.

67
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
So we'll let this linger while we question Michael Carlson.

68
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Look at us, we got a bear, we got a wise worm.

69
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
What happened to you?

70
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Well, I just, I wanted to sort of, you know how Benihana, they prepare the meal?

71
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
While you're at the table?

72
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Yeah.

73
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
So that's what I'm planning on doing with my costume.

74
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It's something that's been come up.

75
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
There's a phrase that maybe I invented, maybe I didn't,

76
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
that's been recently talked about on the show.

77
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
The phrase I'm talking about is of course plush pile.

78
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:07,000
So folks, I, for my costume, I'm going to be a plush pile

79
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
of some of the plushes that I own.

80
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
This is Casey at the Bat.

81
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
He was one at California Adventure many years ago by a friend of mine.

82
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
They make a Casey at the Bat in this century?

83
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
They did before the Pixar Pier renovation.

84
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
This is Raphael that I had when I was a six year old.

85
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Wow. Nice.

86
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
This I won when I was 18 at Islands of Adventure.

87
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Oh, cool.

88
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Jason, it's Magneto.

89
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
The sacred text.

90
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I still have the tag on him too.

91
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
It says plush toy.

92
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Well, he fits right in.

93
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
And a couple others.

94
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I have my original Winnie the Pooh.

95
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Whoa.

96
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I have Stimpy.

97
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
And then two legendary plushes from my life.

98
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
This is Pino, my first plush ever.

99
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I didn't realize I was going to be tugging on the audience's heartstrings tonight.

100
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
And then the much-discussed Ernie doll.

101
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Oh, cool.

102
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Oh, interesting.

103
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
That has a ripped open crotch and looks a bit haunted.

104
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
No, don't point it at the livestream.

105
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Don't get computer viruses.

106
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
You've cursed us all.

107
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Okay, Robert the doll rules apply.

108
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
You have to ask Ernie if you would take a picture.

109
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
And if you take one without it, it's show of disrespect.

110
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
You're in for trouble.

111
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Don't take a photo unless you ask.

112
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Oh my god.

113
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Oh, I didn't realize.

114
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I turned to look at it and it was like I was getting kissed in the face by crotch puff.

115
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Wow, that is torn wide open.

116
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Oh, no.

117
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
An unfortunate seat accident.

118
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
This doll is like 37 years old.

119
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Wow.

120
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,000
This is what almost happened to you on the Riddler's Revenge one time.

121
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
It's very true.

122
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Multiple coasters at Six Flags almost destroyed my genitals.

123
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
So, yes.

124
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
But anyway, I am a plush pile tonight.

125
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Wow, wow.

126
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I'll try to keep this up and we'll see if it's possible.

127
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Yeah, we'll see what happens here.

128
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Well, yeah, this is great.

129
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I mean, I'll have a seat when I can.

130
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
We'll see.

131
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
It'll just like distribute weight weirdly.

132
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Let's try it.

133
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Here we go.

134
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Okay.

135
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Oh, you know what?

136
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Hey, well, I'll puff it up at the end if I can.

137
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
But look at this.

138
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I feel like Halloween is bringing out the kid in us.

139
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
We got so much coziness here.

140
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I'm living my dreams being in glue.

141
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I love it.

142
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Childhood toys.

143
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
And it's just so great to like I feel like the Halloween season is is really doing it

144
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
for us going to do a couple.

145
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Whoa.

146
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
What?

147
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
What the hell was that?

148
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
What was that?

149
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Get wait.

150
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Get up here.

151
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
What was that?

152
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Oh, my God.

153
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Oh, my God.

154
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
What is that thing?

155
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
There's a Minotaur.

156
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
It's a Minotaur.

157
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
It's the Minotaur.

158
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Hide.

159
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Oh, no.

160
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
No, no, no, no, no, no.

161
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
The Minotaur game here.

162
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
No, you know, Minotaur, you might as well grab that mic if you want.

163
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
You know, if you're going to be up here.

164
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Oh, my God.

165
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
No, no, no, no, no.

166
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
The Minotaur found Michael Carlson.

167
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Oh, no.

168
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
No, no, no, no, no.

169
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Geez.

170
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
This is a big surprise.

171
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Big fan.

172
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Big fan.

173
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Nice to meet you.

174
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Thanks, buddy.

175
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Thanks.

176
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Thanks.

177
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Michael Carlson, though.

178
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
What?

179
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
We have some unfinished business.

180
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
That's true.

181
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
We do.

182
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Oh, my God.

183
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
This doesn't concern me, so I'm just going to chill.

184
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Yeah, yeah.

185
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
No, we're fine.

186
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
This has nothing to do with us.

187
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,400
Let me can I can I mean, I know why you're here, but let me explain for any listeners

188
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,900
who don't remember.

189
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,800
Oh, my God.

190
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,800
Geez.

191
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,800
This guy.

192
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,560
You are quite formidable, sir.

193
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,560
Can I?

194
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,560
Yes.

195
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,560
Yeah, yeah.

196
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:14,720
You look a lot scarier than the version I saw after the lights were on when I didn't

197
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,600
do the escape room two years ago.

198
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,600
Hey!

199
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,600
Let Scott set this up.

200
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,600
Okay, sorry.

201
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,600
Thank you.

202
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,600
Thank you.

203
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,060
I need to give some context to the audience.

204
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:27,600
If you don't remember, last year in our haunt cast season, Mike had to tap out of an escape

205
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,700
room called Project Minotaur.

206
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:30,700
Two years ago.

207
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,500
And you explained it pretty fully.

208
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,600
I mean, I think with the problem you were having, just given like the type, the facial

209
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,260
restrictions and everything, the problem you were having is that you were scared shitless

210
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,660
of a Minotaur.

211
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:42,200
That's completely what it was.

212
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,900
And now he's come here to enact his revenge.

213
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:46,900
Yeah.

214
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:49,300
Oh, my God.

215
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,940
That's right, Michael.

216
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:53,280
Last Halloween, you chickened out.

217
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,360
So I know you're a man of fear.

218
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,900
Not the man of no fear, the daredevil.

219
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,200
Oh, yeah, that's daredevil.

220
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,200
That's not Michael.

221
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,200
That's not Michael.

222
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,200
Okay.

223
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:11,200
So tonight, in front of me, your pals, and this whole audience, you must face your ultimate

224
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,200
fear!

225
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,200
Oh, my God.

226
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,200
Whoa, what is that?

227
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,200
What does that mean?

228
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,200
Is his fear of you the Minotaur?

229
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,200
No!

230
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,200
His fear of missing out on something.

231
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,200
Oh.

232
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,200
That's right.

233
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,200
Okay.

234
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,200
Michael, pull out your phone.

235
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,500
Where is it?

236
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,500
Do you have your phone with you?

237
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,500
Yeah, I have it, I have it, I have it.

238
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,500
Okay, I'm glad the plush pile went away.

239
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,500
Okay.

240
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,500
Do what he says, Mike.

241
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,500
I'm doing it.

242
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:39,500
He sends a reminder for everything, whether it be a Taco Bell coupon, a new episode of

243
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:44,500
Club Random, or a toy that you want, a Ninja Turtel.

244
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,500
Yeah.

245
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,500
Oh, the notifications.

246
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:52,500
You've got to delete one of your notifications, and I am really watching you to do it.

247
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,500
Oh, my God.

248
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,500
Oh, my God.

249
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,500
You have to do it for real.

250
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,800
For real.

251
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,800
The Minotaur's watching you, Mike.

252
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,800
But Minotaur, do you know what you're asking?

253
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:05,800
If he gets rid of one of these, Mike will only have hundreds of notifications left.

254
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,800
This is a real deal to have to take.

255
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,800
All right, all right, all right.

256
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,800
Here, here's what I'll do.

257
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,800
You just got to go to settings and then notifications.

258
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,800
Wait, okay, no, no, this is good.

259
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,800
He's got something, he's got an idea here.

260
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,800
What are you doing?

261
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:22,800
Okay, I've been getting a lot of notifications from an ex user named Deal Vibes.

262
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,800
Okay.

263
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,800
Okay.

264
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:28,100
I have to promise to delete it if Deal Vibes is on threads too.

265
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,100
Oh, wow.

266
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,100
You can't follow Deal Vibes on anything else.

267
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:34,100
You can't get an invite code to follow Deal Vibes anywhere.

268
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,100
Oh, okay.

269
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,100
All right, I'm watching.

270
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,100
Go ahead and delete it.

271
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,100
Now it says account notifications.

272
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,100
I have it on all posts.

273
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,100
Oh, no.

274
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:46,100
It's got to go away, big dog.

275
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,100
None.

276
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:50,100
And I've unfollowed it.

277
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,100
He did it.

278
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,100
Unfollowed!

279
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,100
Wow!

280
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,100
He did it.

281
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,400
He did it.

282
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,000
Well, Mike, that is so brave of you.

283
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:05,200
I just sent Jason a Deal Vibes tweet about ham two days ago.

284
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:12,080
Well, and that followed the two or three pounds of frozen meatballs you sent me.

285
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:17,240
Deal Vibes was telling us about a discount on frozen meatballs, so I guess that's out

286
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,240
the window.

287
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,240
It was out of stock by the time I looked.

288
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,880
Jason will be fine without the meatball deals.

289
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:28,580
I just want to say I'm going to give you an intimate moment of paternal pride.

290
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:29,580
Wow.

291
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:30,580
Mike likes those.

292
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:31,580
Whoa.

293
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:32,580
Okay.

294
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:33,580
Michael Carlson.

295
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:34,580
Yeah.

296
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:39,580
Your bravery has made me a proud, proud papa.

297
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:42,580
Oh, my God.

298
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:47,580
Your bravery will save the autobots, I mean, the Minotaurs.

299
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:48,580
Whoa!

300
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,580
Whoa, cool.

301
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:50,580
Thank you so much.

302
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:52,580
You are a brave little boy.

303
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:53,580
Thank you.

304
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:57,280
Go ahead and say that to the audience.

305
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,280
I'm the bravest little boy.

306
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,280
He's the bravest little boy.

307
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,280
Yes!

308
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,280
Mike, he did it!

309
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,280
He faced the Minotaurs!

310
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,280
He did it!

311
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,280
Give him a hug.

312
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,280
Hug it out.

313
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,280
Minotaurs.

314
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,280
Thank you.

315
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,280
Thank you, Minotaurs.

316
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:11,280
Thank you for making this right here tonight.

317
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,280
Really appreciate it, sir.

318
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,280
It's literally the least I could do.

319
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,280
Minotaurs, roll out!

320
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,280
Yay!

321
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,280
Give it up for the Minotaurs.

322
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,280
Here, this way, this way.

323
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,280
Minotaurs, this way.

324
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,980
Give it up for the Minotaurs.

325
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:22,980
Here, this way, this way.

326
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:23,980
Minotaurs.

327
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:24,980
Go hang backstage.

328
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:25,980
We'll pound some later.

329
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:26,980
Thank you so much, Minotaurs.

330
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:27,980
Bring the grinch back there.

331
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:28,980
That way, that way, that way.

332
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:29,980
Oh, God.

333
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:30,980
He's never been to the theater.

334
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:31,980
Careful on the steps.

335
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:32,980
My gosh.

336
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:33,980
The steps have been illegal.

337
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,980
Oh, yeah, leave that, I guess.

338
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:37,980
Oh, jeez.

339
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:38,980
Well, this is what happens.

340
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:41,980
The Minotaur really cares about property, and I like...

341
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:42,980
Yes.

342
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,980
Look, he has rules.

343
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:46,980
Has he found his way out yet?

344
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,680
Well, this is what happens when you get true surprises.

345
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,680
That was a big surprise.

346
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,240
I did not know that was coming.

347
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,240
Mike did not know that was coming.

348
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,640
It was less of a surprise to me, I would say, and to the Minotaur himself.

349
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:02,280
But wow, incredible bravery to start us off.

350
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:05,480
I think that's a great place to start because we're in the haunt season.

351
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,980
This is the bravest season for you.

352
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:12,320
I think you've shown a little bit of bravery out there in the world, in the world of haunts,

353
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,320
right?

354
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,320
Thank you.

355
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,320
Yeah, no.

356
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:20,660
As far as being brave, being a brave little boy.

357
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,660
But I want to...

358
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,660
What are you doing there?

359
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:23,660
Oh, that's the mic.

360
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:24,660
Putting the mic back.

361
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:25,660
Sorry.

362
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:26,660
Now I'm on edge.

363
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:27,660
You never know.

364
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:28,660
Now I think there's shit happening everywhere.

365
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:29,660
The audience should be, too.

366
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:34,660
There could be Minotaurs behind each and every one of you.

367
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:37,660
Yeah, so haunt...

368
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:43,660
Haunt has become my season, I think, in a lot of ways.

369
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,120
I remember there was an episode a couple years ago where Jason said Christmas was going to

370
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,120
be his season, he was going to be a little jingle bell boy or something.

371
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,720
Sounds like him.

372
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,720
But haunt season is mine.

373
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,000
I continue to live my truth.

374
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
But there is...

375
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Hold on one second.

376
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,240
There's a guest here that we've talked about for many months.

377
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,680
We need to have him on the show more.

378
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,120
He has agreed to come.

379
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:10,080
I would like to bring him out here before we talk about anything else.

380
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:14,500
Ladies and gentlemen, does he need anything else other than just to say his name?

381
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,500
Anthony Geo is here.

382
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,500
Anthony Geo.

383
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,500
Wow!

384
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,500
Yay!

385
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,500
Decia.

386
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,500
Here he is.

387
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,500
Thank you.

388
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,500
Mike, deal vibes.

389
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,500
Just dropped a big one.

390
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,500
What?

391
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,500
No!

392
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:39,920
You can't.

393
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,920
You had to.

394
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:41,920
It's what had to be done.

395
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,920
Was it a meatball based deal?

396
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:43,920
It was meatball based.

397
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:48,500
You could get it with Kohl's cash.

398
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,740
I can't believe deal vibes was like a...

399
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:51,740
It's a thing with ham?

400
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:52,740
I thought it was going to be...

401
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:56,740
I mean, it sounds like a vape store or something.

402
00:15:56,740 --> 00:16:01,140
Well, it's a frozen 10 pound ham, you see.

403
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:04,040
Deal vibes, you can get a sound bar.

404
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:09,580
They know the newest video games and also they can give you like a pound of meat.

405
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:11,580
It's just so versatile.

406
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:18,260
You did send me a deal that I bought recently, which was for $4.97 on sale.

407
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:24,580
The replica vintage Ghostbusters toy, Fearsome Flush, which is a haunted toilet.

408
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:25,580
Oh, nice.

409
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:31,540
I used to see it for years at collectible shops and I was always like, I got to get

410
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:32,540
it.

411
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,920
We all ate shit by the late 90s.

412
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,920
Yeah.

413
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:36,920
They literally did.

414
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:37,920
Jason's a sure collectible shop.

415
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,040
Jason owns a little toy toilet now.

416
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,040
Yep.

417
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,040
That's right.

418
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:46,240
Deal vibes also kind of sounds like Jason's Spidey sense.

419
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,240
Like my deal vibes.

420
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,240
My deal vibes.

421
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,240
Yeah.

422
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,640
So anyway, we were talking about haunts and there was a lot of discussion about what this

423
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,160
episode should be about.

424
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:03,260
J.O. and I spent weeks discussing it.

425
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:08,300
Just there's famous haunts, you know, and there's all these different Halloween characters

426
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:11,420
that have appeared at these haunts.

427
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:14,420
And I was saying, yeah, let's just sort of dig into the lore of something.

428
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:17,620
And then J.O. said, no.

429
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:22,720
He said, we need to do something important.

430
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,020
We need to go back.

431
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:28,020
Whoa.

432
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,020
We need to go back.

433
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,020
He said, we need to go back.

434
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:31,020
He said, we got to go back.

435
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:34,020
And I said, what do you mean go back?

436
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,020
What is that?

437
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:38,020
And he said, no, we need to go way back.

438
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,020
Way back.

439
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:40,020
2019.

440
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:43,020
We need to go to 2019.

441
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:46,020
It's pretty far back in a lot of ways.

442
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,020
Okay.

443
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,020
I don't remember that, but okay.

444
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:52,020
And he said, we need to go back to Valencia.

445
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:54,020
Wow.

446
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:56,020
Damn.

447
00:17:56,020 --> 00:18:06,020
Ladies and gentlemen, we went back to Fright Fest.

448
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:08,020
Wow.

449
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:12,020
You are in Six Flags Fright Fest 2.

450
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:14,020
This is Six Flags Fright Fest 2.

451
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:16,020
Oh my God.

452
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:22,020
This is the Empire Strikes Back of Fright Fest episodes.

453
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:24,020
Or the Jaws 2.

454
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:27,020
This is Jaws 2 of Fright Fest.

455
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:29,020
Careful with that sequel thing.

456
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,020
A lot of sequels out there.

457
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:33,020
This is Attack of the Clones of Fright Fest.

458
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:37,020
This is the last Jedi of Fright Fest.

459
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,020
I know.

460
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,020
I know.

461
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,020
So we did it.

462
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,020
We went back.

463
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,020
We went back.

464
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,020
We went back.

465
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:46,020
And not much has changed.

466
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:48,020
Oh, hell yeah.

467
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,020
Yeah.

468
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:53,020
So what's interesting is you go back and listen to old episodes,

469
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:58,020
because I want to make sure we weren't recovering things we've said before or whatever.

470
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:02,020
And the number one thing I learned today when I was re-listening to this episode we've done,

471
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:13,020
which Gio and I went in 2019 to Fright Fest, is that Jason said in 2019 that he wishes a roller coaster would crush his genitals,

472
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:17,020
because it would make his life easier.

473
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:21,020
I think he said destroy my genitals.

474
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:25,020
I had forgotten that.

475
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:28,020
That might be the funniest thing I'd ever heard.

476
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:31,020
But he said it.

477
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,020
That's okay.

478
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:37,020
In the earlier show tonight, I was begging the bride from the Haunted Mansion to cut my head off.

479
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:40,020
So some things never change.

480
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:43,020
Jason is the kinkiest member of the podcast.

481
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:44,020
Yeah.

482
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,020
I'll drop these...

483
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:48,020
There's these phrases that feel researched.

484
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:57,020
Jason and I say this word in a good way, is the freak of podcasts, the ride.

485
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:03,020
You know they're wrong with being a little free.

486
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:08,020
Real quick, I did go to the sphere.

487
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:10,020
I'm not going to talk about it, but we'll talk about it later.

488
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:13,020
And they did not do Freak Like Me.

489
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:17,020
They didn't do their first ever full band rendition.

490
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,020
No.

491
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:21,020
Well, did they do Boyfriars from the Sky?

492
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,020
No.

493
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,020
No, they didn't.

494
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:28,020
Anyway, so we went back to Fright Fest and...

495
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,020
I should explain.

496
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:31,020
That's why I'm dressed this way.

497
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,020
Oh yeah, please.

498
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:34,020
So my costume is...

499
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:40,020
I'm wearing a Taz and Bug shirt that says, Kicking It Old School.

500
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:42,020
They're wearing backwards jeans.

501
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:44,020
They're kind of dressed like crisscross.

502
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:46,020
This is not licensed.

503
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:48,020
There's no way this is licensed.

504
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:51,020
And then I'm wearing some pajama pants.

505
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:56,020
And I'll say, this is essentially the official uniform of anyone at Six Flags.

506
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,020
Employee or guest, right?

507
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:04,020
There are so many people walking around in pajama pants.

508
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:10,020
So I just thought I'd say that for the listener.

509
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,020
So he's in the mood.

510
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:14,020
He's in the festive mood of Six Flags.

511
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:18,020
How to start the stories that we experienced...

512
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:20,020
Let me just say this first.

513
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:24,020
I lost my driver's license and debit card at Six Flags.

514
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:27,020
Hang on, hang on.

515
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:31,020
You lost your driver's license, debit card, and insurance card.

516
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:37,020
That is all true.

517
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:43,020
I kept saying to Gio, it feels like I did this on purpose, but I did not.

518
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:45,020
This is a pain in the ass.

519
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:47,020
No, no. We'll get to it.

520
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:48,020
We'll get to it.

521
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:50,020
But I wanted to start with maybe the hottest topic.

522
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:54,020
Is that we were enjoying a very tall alien at Fright Fest.

523
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:58,020
And then I go to Gio, I go, my driver's license is missing.

524
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:03,020
You saw the alien and you were scared.

525
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:05,020
And I was like, oh, he's scared of the alien.

526
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:08,020
And then I said, and this is...

527
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,020
We'll get to it.

528
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:12,020
But I said, it smells like there's gas leaking.

529
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:20,020
Because in the area where the alien was, near the DJ, there was a gas leak.

530
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:26,020
What if that's just what the tall alien smells like?

531
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:28,020
That's a nice smell on his planet.

532
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:30,020
So here's the tall alien.

533
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,020
Yes.

534
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:33,020
By the way, this guy rules.

535
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,020
Awesome.

536
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,020
And he was on stilts.

537
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:38,020
First of all, there were so many people on stilts at Fright Fest.

538
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:41,020
I thought, you know, maybe being on stilts is actually easy.

539
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:45,020
Because there's so many people that do it.

540
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:48,020
And not concerned when children were around.

541
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:49,020
It wasn't like a...

542
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:51,020
I used to think that must be so hard to learn.

543
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,020
And then I was like, you know what?

544
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:54,020
I could be on stilts.

545
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:57,020
I could probably do it.

546
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:58,020
I think I could be on stilts.

547
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:59,020
Yeah.

548
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:00,020
Yeah.

549
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:02,020
But then I was like, I'm not sure.

550
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,020
Yeah.

551
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:04,020
But they were fantastic.

552
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:06,020
I mean, we'll get to it.

553
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:10,020
But yes, yeah, Mike Lost is a social security guard.

554
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:13,020
His birth certificate.

555
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,020
What if this isn't Mike?

556
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:18,020
This is a stolen identity sitting here.

557
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,020
It's possible.

558
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:22,020
Mike, can you bring up that picture I sent you?

559
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:27,020
So this alien, I'm assuming, was in the entertainment area called Invasion.

560
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:31,020
It was like an alien-themed area.

561
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:37,020
Can I ask, did any of the Six Flags aliens say, take me to your dealer?

562
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:43,020
Like the classic weed-smoking green alien.

563
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:46,020
Some of the dads did, for sure.

564
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:52,020
I do think we smelled weed quite a bit at Six Flags.

565
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,020
I'm so sorry.

566
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:56,020
If you weren't smelling natural gas, you were smelling weed.

567
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:58,020
I was smelling weed.

568
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:04,020
OK, so you wanted to maybe start to go chronologically?

569
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,020
We can go back.

570
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:08,020
So we won't get to that point, because that was kind of a turning point.

571
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:11,020
Yeah, that was sort of mid-trip.

572
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:18,020
I've got everything back, but it was a real pain.

573
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:19,020
You've got to go to the DMV.

574
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,020
It's a hole.

575
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:23,020
First you've got to go to the Six Flags Lost and Found.

576
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:24,020
So, well, we did.

577
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:25,020
We'll go there.

578
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:27,020
And a reliable place, surely.

579
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:31,020
Very little found.

580
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:35,020
So, OK.

581
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:39,020
This is like a great teaser.

582
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:41,020
You start in the middle and then you go back.

583
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:44,020
So, yeah, we made the journey up to Valencia.

584
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:49,020
And it was weird because there were no storms in the forecast,

585
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:54,020
but the clouds were just ominous, sort of going up.

586
00:24:57,020 --> 00:25:02,020
So that was on our way out of Burbank toward Valencia.

587
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:05,020
And I was like, what's going on in Valencia?

588
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,020
And then I checked the weather.

589
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:07,020
And it was clear.

590
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:10,020
It was like God was like, turn back now.

591
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:14,020
There was something biblical about it.

592
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:18,020
It was pooled alien gas.

593
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:23,020
And then like this, I turn and I go, is that one of the roller coasters?

594
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:28,020
I mean, we were like 10 miles from it, but still.

595
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:29,020
Right.

596
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:31,020
It might as well be.

597
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:33,020
You just fall off the end.

598
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:34,020
Yeah.

599
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:35,020
Into a hole.

600
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:39,020
So I should say, very nice of them to invite us.

601
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:41,020
That's right.

602
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:46,020
They didn't listen to the first one.

603
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:47,020
I don't know.

604
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:48,020
Oh my God.

605
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:49,020
We shouldn't be allowed.

606
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:51,020
We shouldn't be invited.

607
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:57,020
I mean, I do love the place.

608
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:58,020
I do too.

609
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:01,020
We had a better time than the first time.

610
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,020
I would say that.

611
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,020
It was smooth.

612
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:05,020
Well, no, Mike did lose a lot, but.

613
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:10,020
You had a better time, but you lost all of your ID.

614
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:13,020
Wow.

615
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:18,020
So I don't know how well you remember an old, many years ago episode.

616
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:22,020
So I still have my same plug-in car.

617
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:27,020
I got an electric car right before doing the Six Flags trip.

618
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:35,020
And before they directed me to plug it in near what was basically like.

619
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,020
It was a fucking shack.

620
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:40,020
It was an in-ground trip.

621
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:44,020
It was like when your school was doing construction growing up.

622
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:46,020
And they bought some in-ground trailers.

623
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:48,020
Yes.

624
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:49,020
To do music class in.

625
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:52,020
Yes.

626
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:55,020
So that would be like an auxiliary building off the school.

627
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:59,020
And so I'm like, I wonder what's going to happen this time.

628
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:01,020
I wonder if they've upgraded the EV charging.

629
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:06,020
And we got to the booth and I excitedly asked, do you have EV charging?

630
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:07,020
And they said, yes.

631
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:09,020
We have four.

632
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:10,020
Three or four?

633
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:13,020
Four spaces for you to charge in.

634
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:15,020
And I was like, we were elated.

635
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:17,020
We were like, boy, they're up.

636
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:19,020
Maybe this is going to be a whole different situation.

637
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:21,020
We're going to take all four.

638
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:28,020
I'm going to park vertically and then I'll plug one here, plug one in the tailpipe.

639
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:33,020
Plug one in another part of a car because I don't quite know how cars work.

640
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,020
Put one in your mouth.

641
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:39,020
And I'll just drink the electricity.

642
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:44,020
Like it was Fog Juice.

643
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:48,020
So we did not have to park by the shack.

644
00:27:49,020 --> 00:28:01,020
It was nearly impossible to get to the actual charging stations because there were so many cones blocking the one parking lot that had it.

645
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:06,020
Well, also there were four trucks parked in the spots that weren't electric.

646
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:12,020
We looped around the parking lot three times.

647
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:13,020
Yes.

648
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:15,020
The full circumference of the parking lot.

649
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:18,020
Which is roughly 10 square miles.

650
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:22,020
We're running late for the media event.

651
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:25,020
And I'm like, we got to get to the full throttle bar.

652
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:30,020
Because the full throttle bar again is where the media event takes place.

653
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:32,020
Mike was like, I have to get to that.

654
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:34,020
I don't know if I was.

655
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:42,020
I do think it's fair to say that there was no time where Gio ever uttered, I need to get to the full throttle bar.

656
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:45,020
So that's true.

657
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:54,020
But then we found an employee and this would kind of set the bar because if you remember last time, it was fully staffed with teens.

658
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:55,020
Yes.

659
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:58,020
And almost none of the teens knew anything.

660
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:00,020
No.

661
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:04,020
I will say we found many adults who were helpful.

662
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:10,020
So that, I mean, this is like breaking news, right?

663
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:14,020
Six Flags employs adults now.

664
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:24,020
And it immediately was different because when you talk to an adult, they understand what.

665
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:29,020
Why?

666
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:37,020
And so we asked her, she was in the parking lot, one of the attendants, you know, where's the electric parking?

667
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:39,020
And she said, oh, well, it's over there.

668
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:40,020
And she goes, there's four spots.

669
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:43,020
And then she leaned in and she goes, one's broken.

670
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:47,020
So there's only three, technically only three.

671
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:50,020
And then she goes, oh, okay.

672
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:52,020
And then we go, do we have to go back around?

673
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:54,020
And she goes, no, just go and find a spot.

674
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:57,020
So adult, but very teen like energy.

675
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:00,020
But helpful teen energy.

676
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:01,020
Yes.

677
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:03,020
Here's my little message of hope.

678
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:13,020
What if the helpful adults were the teens from four years ago and they've grown up and they've learned?

679
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,020
Wow.

680
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:16,020
That's our show.

681
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:22,020
Beautiful.

682
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,020
That is beautiful.

683
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:26,020
And I'd like to think that is true.

684
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:38,020
They learned the hard fought lessons, not that the pandemic taught everyone that, oh shit, Six Flags caught the, you can eat food here every day pass.

685
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:39,020
Oh, yes.

686
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:40,020
So now.

687
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:41,020
Right.

688
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:42,020
That's true.

689
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:43,020
Got a hard scrabble world out there.

690
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,020
You know.

691
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:45,020
Right.

692
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:47,020
I just got a daily vibes that says you can do that.

693
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,020
What?

694
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:50,020
I'm missing everything.

695
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:53,020
You can take up residence at Six Flags.

696
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:57,020
If you can fit in a locker, you can spend the night.

697
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:02,020
Okay.

698
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:03,020
So she was very helpful.

699
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:04,020
Very helpful.

700
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:05,020
Yeah.

701
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:06,020
She said, yeah, go ahead.

702
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:07,020
And she kind of just was like, yeah, whatever.

703
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:08,020
Yeah.

704
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:09,020
She said, because people are leaving right now.

705
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:10,020
Yes.

706
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:11,020
Go ahead and take a spot.

707
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:16,020
But then she did kind of point us toward the open spots, but they were all one way.

708
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:19,020
So we were kind of going head on.

709
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:21,020
We were pissing people off.

710
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:24,020
But people weren't happy we were going the wrong way.

711
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:25,020
She told us to break the rules.

712
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:26,020
She did.

713
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:27,020
She did.

714
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:28,020
Yeah.

715
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,020
We would never have done it without her.

716
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:35,020
But it honestly saved us because the place they wanted us to park was like the farthest

717
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:41,020
parking lot in the gravel way past all the different deer blinds that they have sitting

718
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:43,020
in those parking lots.

719
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:45,020
Do you have a photo of the...

720
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:46,020
I don't have a photo of the deer.

721
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:49,020
Jason, in the first episode, named them deer blinds.

722
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:51,020
But they're almost like sniper towers.

723
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:57,020
They're like sniper towers that sit every 50 yards in this massive lot.

724
00:31:57,020 --> 00:32:04,020
And there are just sleepy teens in them.

725
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:11,020
And I can't imagine, even if they saw something that they needed to do something about, what

726
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:13,020
do they do?

727
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:20,020
Do they like light a lantern and then like another one lights a lantern and then another

728
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:29,020
one does and eventually that reaches the CEO of Six Flags and he calls the cops?

729
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:35,020
Or he has like a fog horn or he like rings the bell in like a bell tower or a big horn.

730
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,020
Yes.

731
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:37,020
Right.

732
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:41,020
And then the strongest team comes out.

733
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:53,020
Well, the fog horn alerts fog horn leg horn.

734
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:58,020
I say I'll take care of this one.

735
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:02,020
And he can, he doesn't have to do a lot of heavy lifting.

736
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:07,020
He can intimidate people just by looks because he is falling apart.

737
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:11,020
Rotting fog horn leg horn.

738
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:15,020
So you're saying he's like a statue at a Six Flags version of fog horn.

739
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:17,020
Yeah, it's a costume.

740
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:19,020
It's a fur costume.

741
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:25,020
But it was made when Clinton was in office.

742
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:28,020
You know, it's funny you say that you're not wrong.

743
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:31,020
There are no walk around characters.

744
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:36,020
And then even the stuffed stuffed plushie plushies.

745
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:38,020
You could call them plushies if you want.

746
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:45,020
You know, you'll see they have more Mario Super Mario stuff than they do.

747
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:46,020
Like Bugs Bunny.

748
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:47,020
Oh, OK.

749
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,020
That's funny.

750
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:49,020
So you bring this up.

751
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:55,020
We're looking at one of these like claw machine things and it's all Mario and Luigi.

752
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:57,020
And he says, man, I don't know.

753
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:58,020
He goes, I don't know.

754
00:33:58,020 --> 00:34:02,020
Why isn't this just filled with bugs?

755
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:08,020
And I thought he meant literal bugs.

756
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:15,020
And I answered in the most nonchalant way, yeah, I don't know.

757
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:20,020
And then to Mike's credit, his identity had been stolen at this moment.

758
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:25,020
So he was just sort of literally was getting to us.

759
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:26,020
Yeah.

760
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:30,020
So CalGas was like monitoring our symptoms.

761
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:31,020
Ah.

762
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:34,020
OK.

763
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:35,020
So we're in the car.

764
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:36,020
We parked.

765
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:40,020
This is going to take four fucking hours.

766
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:42,020
Buckle up.

767
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:48,020
So I am so, I'm like the full throttle part of the media event, the full throttle bar,

768
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:50,020
it's going to be over in 20 minutes.

769
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:51,020
I got to get there.

770
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:52,020
I got to get there.

771
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:54,020
So I'm being probably embarrassing.

772
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:55,020
I don't know.

773
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:56,020
You can tell me what I was doing.

774
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:57,020
No, no, no, no.

775
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:59,020
It was the fastest I've ever seen you.

776
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:00,020
I.

777
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:04,020
Yeah, it was going full throttle.

778
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:05,020
Oh, yeah.

779
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:11,020
You were, you were hauling ass like because there was a point where we were sort of like

780
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:13,020
kind of doing the run walk.

781
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:14,020
Well, you took off.

782
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:16,020
I was like, damn, Mike's pretty quick.

783
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:17,020
Let me say this.

784
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:22,020
And I don't want to I'm thrilled you're on the show, but you went back to the car twice.

785
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,020
I did.

786
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:25,020
I had to go back because I forgot a couple of things.

787
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:28,020
Don't you remember even why I was just seeing red?

788
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:29,020
Yeah.

789
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:30,020
Yeah.

790
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:35,020
And I was like, we are going to miss the whole part, the whole full throttle experience.

791
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:37,020
Yes, you were.

792
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:39,020
I can't remember why I went back twice.

793
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:41,020
Probably to make sure it was.

794
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:45,020
I guess I appreciate that.

795
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:46,020
I can't remember.

796
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:47,020
Yeah.

797
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:52,020
So that we I can't wait to now to then now learn what is in the full throttle bar.

798
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:53,020
Oh, well.

799
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:57,020
Well, you soon you will find out.

800
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:00,020
Mike's kitchen now has a third glass.

801
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:11,020
So the first time we did this, yeah, this this lounge, they gave you a free

802
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:16,020
a plastic skull glass that was filled with like a dreamsicle milkshake.

803
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:21,020
Let's just say the budget has been cut a little bit

804
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:24,020
from the media event, which is fine.

805
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:26,020
I'm not whatever.

806
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:30,020
But it's not quite the spread it used to be.

807
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:33,020
So we run into the park.

808
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:38,020
I find an employee and I incorrectly say the name of the place we're going.

809
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:40,020
I say, where's the full throttle lounge?

810
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:45,020
And the guy looks to me completely befuddled and he goes, well, there's a

811
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:47,020
he's looking around.

812
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:51,020
He goes, a full throttle bar over there.

813
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:00,020
All right.

814
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:01,020
Probably.

815
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:04,020
And I go, I think it's the same one.

816
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:06,020
I don't think there's a bar and a lounge.

817
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:11,020
So luckily, it was the full.

818
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:13,020
In case you don't know, the full throttle bar

819
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:17,020
is close to the entrance of Six Flags.

820
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:20,020
So we made it over there pretty quick, pretty quick.

821
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:22,020
And we did get slow down a little metal detectors.

822
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:26,020
We did. Yes. So there are metal detectors you go through and whatnot.

823
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:31,020
And then Mike's metal detector went off and the teen said, walk through again.

824
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:33,020
And then it didn't go off and he goes, all right, you're good.

825
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:42,020
And Mike almost was like, are you sure?

826
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:49,020
Yeah, but I was so normally I would.

827
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:51,020
Yeah, I would have tried to clarify, but we were in a rush.

828
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:54,020
So is that between the passes?

829
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:57,020
Is that when your wallet was pickpocketed?

830
00:37:57,020 --> 00:38:01,020
I don't think so, because I think I had to show my.

831
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:05,020
No, I didn't have to show my ID anywhere to get into Six Flags.

832
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:09,020
Papers, papers, please.

833
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:12,020
I think I know where I lost it.

834
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:15,020
I think I know. I think it was by the tall alien.

835
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:17,020
It was by the gas. It was by the gas. And by the gas.

836
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:18,020
Yeah. OK.

837
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:20,020
One of those no good stilt walkers.

838
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:22,020
They're distracting.

839
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:24,020
I think I know where I lost it.

840
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:26,020
One of those no good stilt walkers.

841
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:29,020
They're distracting. You think they're cool and they're grabbing all your shit.

842
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:30,020
That's true.

843
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:32,020
Well, there's another person under them.

844
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:33,020
Oh.

845
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:37,020
And that's like opening up their little alien trench coat.

846
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:40,020
What you think is a knee is a hand.

847
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:49,020
Yeah. So if you're not familiar with the geography of Six Flags or this is the

848
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:53,020
this is the full throttle bar, sports bar.

849
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:56,020
FT.

850
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:59,020
No need to have the full name there.

851
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:01,020
You know, shorthand.

852
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:06,020
I mean, some might say you want to you might want to reprint the sign.

853
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:10,020
Yeah. Center the poster and the text on it.

854
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:14,020
But fix the warping wood that surrounds it.

855
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:18,020
That HP inkjet ran out of ink a long time ago.

856
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:21,020
During the print.

857
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:22,020
Yep.

858
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:27,020
Is that a that's not a cockroach in the bottom left, is it?

859
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:29,020
Yes, it is.

860
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:35,020
It is a I think it is a bug.

861
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:36,020
Yeah, I think that is.

862
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:37,020
I do think it's a bug.

863
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:38,020
You got your wish.

864
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:40,020
It is full of bugs.

865
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:43,020
How did it get out of the clog?

866
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:48,020
Oh my God.

867
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:50,020
OK, so Mike, you you went in.

868
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:53,020
So we so we we kind of have a diversion here.

869
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:54,020
Yeah. You go in.

870
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:56,020
Why don't you tell what happened when you were in there?

871
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:58,020
And I'll I'll say what would have been pretty.

872
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:00,020
Oh, so OK. Yeah.

873
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:04,020
Previously, a couple of years ago when we did it, there was there was like many tables

874
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:07,020
and there were a lot of different items you could get.

875
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:10,020
And this year it was a little pared down.

876
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:14,020
You could get Skeratia wings.

877
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:18,020
OK. And this is what the table looked like when I was there.

878
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:23,020
It was like one plate with two wings on it.

879
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:28,020
Now, look, was this the most opportunistic photo of all time?

880
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:33,020
As far as in between periods where no one had like loaded more wings onto this table?

881
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:35,020
Probably.

882
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:38,020
But the rest of the table just black.

883
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:41,020
There's no other. It's just tablecloth and crumbs.

884
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:43,020
There's nothing on the red note.

885
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:47,020
Whatever the sign is on the right, there is no food that aligns with the sign.

886
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:53,020
I think you sent me this photo with no context.

887
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:59,020
And you probably Jason, when I sent you this photo, did your tummy get a little rumbly?

888
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:05,020
I mean, I got a little scared, but then my tummy got rumbly.

889
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:08,020
So, yeah, they had a couple wings to eat.

890
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:12,020
They had these dirt cups, graveyard pudding.

891
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:16,020
And then they had a couple drinks.

892
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:20,020
They had a couple cocktails, Devil's Punch and Demon Lure.

893
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:28,020
And I had a Devil's Punch, which was basically like a sugar drink, which I liked.

894
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:37,020
Graveyard pudding, by the way, is probably the worst thing I've ever heard call, I mean, worms and dirt.

895
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:41,020
And I'm like, yeah, that doesn't sound great, but I know it from being a kid.

896
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:47,020
But graveyard pudding feels like you want to do another draft on that one.

897
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:57,020
It's like our cemetery is on a flood plain.

898
00:41:57,020 --> 00:42:04,020
The old groundskeeper is like, we got the graveyard pudding, it's loose.

899
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:08,020
Get the snowshoes.

900
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:14,020
We got to wait for the winter season for a graveyard pudding to shore up.

901
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:20,020
We just put it on the river because at that point you can't tell who's who.

902
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:24,020
Just throw some sandbags around it.

903
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:30,020
So I was in there and I was like, I got to get Gio some graveyard pudding.

904
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:33,020
And I brought two graveyard puddings out.

905
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:39,020
He came out, I wasn't looking at him, he goes, Gio.

906
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:46,020
And I said, no.

907
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:49,020
He would not eat the graveyard pudding.

908
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:54,020
And I didn't know its name at the time.

909
00:42:54,020 --> 00:43:00,020
It was, the graveyard pudding was like chocolate pudding with like stale Oreos on top.

910
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:01,020
And worms.

911
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:03,020
And there were some worms involved.

912
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:05,020
One or two.

913
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:10,020
So I ended up just eating the stale Oreos off both graveyard puddings and then throwing.

914
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:12,020
With your tongue?

915
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:14,020
Yeah.

916
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:16,020
I tongue the Oreos.

917
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:18,020
Tongue and stale Oreo.

918
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:20,020
Yeah.

919
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:27,020
So Mike goes inside and he's at the table and whatnot.

920
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:29,020
And I'm kind of just hovering outside.

921
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:34,020
I was like, well, I'm going to do a lap because there's a little bit of time and stuff.

922
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:38,020
So I do a lap around full throttle.

923
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:41,020
Do you have a picture of the drain by Jim?

924
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:43,020
I do, yes.

925
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:45,020
Okay.

926
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:49,020
So this is not, someone did not throw up.

927
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:51,020
So that's not a throw up.

928
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:55,020
But this is, I think this is devil's blood.

929
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:56,020
Devil's punch.

930
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:57,020
Devil's punch.

931
00:43:57,020 --> 00:43:58,020
The devil's punch.

932
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:01,020
Because someone came out of full throttle while you were in there and I was standing

933
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:10,020
outside, took a sip and said, oh, this tastes like shit.

934
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:17,020
And then threw it into the drain.

935
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:19,020
Boosh.

936
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:24,020
Touchdown.

937
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:26,020
That is such an aggressive spill.

938
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:27,020
Yeah.

939
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:29,020
He really spiked it down.

940
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:31,020
He threw it down.

941
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:34,020
Did he get high fived by anyone after?

942
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:43,020
Well, he may have been inspired to spike because inside the full throttle bar, bar, bar, bar,

943
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:50,020
there was a plaque of the Raiders, which tout we love because the Raiders have not been

944
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:53,020
in Los Angeles for decades.

945
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:56,020
And this is one of the only things on the wall.

946
00:44:56,020 --> 00:45:02,020
The Oakland, every theme park in Southern California still has a lot of Oakland Raiders

947
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:04,020
merch.

948
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:05,020
Yes.

949
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:07,020
Which I've been told is not the way to say.

950
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:08,020
Like a dress.

951
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:13,020
In case, the City Walk Saga theme says Oakland Raiders merch.

952
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:14,020
Okay.

953
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:17,020
That's not what sports people call.

954
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:20,020
What do they call it?

955
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:22,020
Parafinalia?

956
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:26,020
Odds and ends?

957
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:28,020
I don't remember actually.

958
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:29,020
Oh, okay.

959
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:31,020
Who pointed this out to you?

960
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:35,020
And also this is the most micro canceling I've ever heard.

961
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:42,020
I was listening to the theme song of your 19 part mall thing.

962
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:47,020
I don't remember, but somebody thought that was really funny that we referred to it as

963
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:48,020
merch.

964
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:49,020
Anyway.

965
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:51,020
Oakland Raiders are everywhere.

966
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:52,020
Yes.

967
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:53,020
Yes.

968
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:56,020
So I do my lap.

969
00:45:56,020 --> 00:46:01,020
And my lap is around the Full Throttle Bar and I get to the back of the bar.

970
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:08,020
And this is around the place where last time I saw the dad tell his son to watch your brother

971
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:11,020
have to take a shit.

972
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:13,020
That was in 2019.

973
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:14,020
Okay.

974
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:15,020
Things are different now.

975
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:17,020
You can't just say that.

976
00:46:17,020 --> 00:46:20,020
It's a different time.

977
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:23,020
You bring your kids into the bathrooms.

978
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:27,020
I have to shit wait here.

979
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:37,020
And so I make my way around and I see, I made a little note of this.

980
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:44,020
There's an audio, I should say there's an audio loop happening as I'm walking and it

981
00:46:44,020 --> 00:46:46,020
says warning.

982
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:50,020
The park is about to be infested with demons, ghouls and ghosts.

983
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:54,020
It's like giving this like five minutes on a loop and then running into that same audio

984
00:46:54,020 --> 00:47:03,020
queue is, if you want to smoke, please go to the designated smoking areas.

985
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:08,020
And as I do my loop, I see one of the designated smoking areas, which I thought as I was turning

986
00:47:08,020 --> 00:47:13,020
the corner, oh, the fog machines are on now.

987
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:14,020
No.

988
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:15,020
No.

989
00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:19,020
People are like cigarettes are alive and well.

990
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:20,020
People are letting it rip.

991
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:27,020
And it's like just, it's basically just like a little concrete semi circle like this where

992
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:29,020
you've like, that's where you have to like sit.

993
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:32,020
And there's a little, there's like a little line that you can't cross.

994
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:36,020
So I walked past them and I got a little sad.

995
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:38,020
I got a little sad as I walked past them.

996
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:42,020
And then I make my way back around the other side of the full throttle bar.

997
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:49,020
And I'm now in what I'll describe as just like a children's Bugs Bunny Looney Tunes land.

998
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:50,020
Yes.

999
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:51,020
Right.

1000
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:55,020
There's like Bugs House and I think that's it.

1001
00:47:55,020 --> 00:47:57,020
But that's what's happening.

1002
00:47:57,020 --> 00:48:03,020
And I'm coming up and I'm as I'm walking up, there's a teen with his back to me and he's

1003
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:07,020
kind of guarding the area like guarding Bugs's area.

1004
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:10,020
And a guy is walking towards him.

1005
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:14,020
So now I'm walking past his back, a guy is walking towards him.

1006
00:48:14,020 --> 00:48:20,020
And the teen says to the guy trying to walk into Bugs's area, hey, sorry, you can't, this

1007
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:22,020
area is restricted.

1008
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:25,020
And the guy goes, well, how did he get back here?

1009
00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:31,020
And points at me and I simply just walked around the building.

1010
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:36,020
And the teen looks at me, looks back at the guy and goes, damn, I don't know.

1011
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:52,020
So the opsec doesn't seem great at Six Flags between the damn I don't know and the like,

1012
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:54,020
oh, you can come to the mountain texture.

1013
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:56,020
Yeah, yeah, that's fine.

1014
00:48:56,020 --> 00:48:58,020
He didn't yell at you to leave though.

1015
00:48:58,020 --> 00:48:59,020
No, he didn't.

1016
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:03,020
He I just kept walking and he didn't even ask like, sir, sir, any.

1017
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:05,020
There was no attempt.

1018
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:11,020
And then the guy was not allowed back to smoke.

1019
00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:18,020
I guess I guess I could have been like, hey, you can just walk around the other side.

1020
00:49:18,020 --> 00:49:23,020
But at that point, I was seeing a man dump the drink into the.

1021
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:25,020
So this is OK.

1022
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:27,020
So let's let's jump around a little bit.

1023
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:32,020
So what's interesting about the Looney Tunes area, which is the kid area of Six Flags,

1024
00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:37,020
and it's like not says a kid area and it's all kid rides and it's very Looney Tunes heavy.

1025
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:44,020
And it nots you walk kind of through the Snoopy area, but it's not they don't like use it for the haunt.

1026
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:46,020
I see. Just kind of darkened.

1027
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:50,020
Yeah. So like you really can't you probably might not even be able to tell it Six Flags.

1028
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:59,020
They do a weird thing where they just throw like a harsh red light on everything.

1029
00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:01,020
So so this is what he was guarding.

1030
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:08,020
He was like guarding the prep of the red lights for on Looney Tunes Lodge.

1031
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:10,020
So that was for the listener.

1032
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:13,020
That was like all smiling characters, but just lit red.

1033
00:50:13,020 --> 00:50:18,020
Basically, since the Looney Tunes, the rides aren't running, the Looney Tunes aren't around.

1034
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:22,020
It really feels like they died.

1035
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:27,020
Like it feels like something bad happened to the Looney Tunes because it's like lit.

1036
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:32,020
If the signs weren't lit at all, I guess you go, OK, well, yeah, if you really squint, you can see.

1037
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:41,020
But it's like there's such a sinister vibe in this area because you're getting scares from like it was like this is a clown area or something.

1038
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:46,020
And that's me in the picture. I do look startled.

1039
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:56,020
Now, what's interesting, we've talked about this before on the show is that in the daytime, you can go into Bugs Bunny's house.

1040
00:50:56,020 --> 00:51:00,020
And odd little creepy like the rooms were like priests live.

1041
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:02,020
Yeah, yes.

1042
00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:07,020
Somebody who's taken a vow of celibacy lives in this room.

1043
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:13,020
Like the unfinished big short houses where Steve Carell is like, what's going on?

1044
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:16,020
What's here?

1045
00:51:16,020 --> 00:51:19,020
And we happened upon like a group of teens.

1046
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:26,020
So this is what it looks like.

1047
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:33,020
This is where Bugs goes to self flagellate.

1048
00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:39,020
Oh, cool. They got the Texas Chainsaw Massacre license this year.

1049
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:43,020
And I had like a blurry photo, but I don't have it on here.

1050
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:52,020
So we ran in. So this is we come up and all of a sudden we see we see teens that don't work there in Bugs's house.

1051
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:55,020
And they're being bad.

1052
00:51:55,020 --> 00:52:00,020
Swearing. Oh, yeah. Discussing PG-13 sexuality.

1053
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:02,020
They're they are. They're on.

1054
00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:06,020
They're climbing on top of Bugs fridge.

1055
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:14,020
Two teen boys are sitting on top of Bugs's fridge and some girls taking a photo of them.

1056
00:52:14,020 --> 00:52:18,020
And as soon as we walked by, I don't think because of us, they left.

1057
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:21,020
But it felt like maybe that's why.

1058
00:52:21,020 --> 00:52:27,020
Because they take the photo on Bugs's fridge and they jump down and they leave.

1059
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:32,020
They got a deal vibe of like these nerds are here.

1060
00:52:32,020 --> 00:52:36,020
These older men, they were doing in the photo. It was pretty naughty, Mike.

1061
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:39,020
What were they doing? Double middle fingers on top of Bugs fridge.

1062
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:42,020
No, no. Yes.

1063
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:45,020
They were an American icon.

1064
00:52:45,020 --> 00:52:47,020
Not on my watch.

1065
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:52,020
They were four and a half feet in the air doing double deuces.

1066
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:55,020
I don't know about that.

1067
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:57,020
Do you call giving the middle finger a deuce?

1068
00:52:57,020 --> 00:52:59,020
Is that one of the things?

1069
00:52:59,020 --> 00:53:03,020
I don't know. It's past my bedtime.

1070
00:53:03,020 --> 00:53:10,020
It really is that I get to keep looking over and every time I look at you, I forget that you were the sleepy time bear.

1071
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:14,020
And I have like the point of view from the tea box.

1072
00:53:14,020 --> 00:53:18,020
Like, wow.

1073
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:20,020
Wow.

1074
00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:23,020
Starstruck. I'm starstruck.

1075
00:53:23,020 --> 00:53:30,020
I'll tell you this. This is a lot better than the last NPM show we did where I was eating the carcinogen candy.

1076
00:53:30,020 --> 00:53:32,020
Oh my God.

1077
00:53:32,020 --> 00:53:35,020
Shaving weeks off my life every time I completed a loop.

1078
00:53:35,020 --> 00:53:40,020
Oh yes. Just sadly gnawing on a candy thong.

1079
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:45,020
Like mashing it like a horse.

1080
00:53:45,020 --> 00:53:49,020
Wow. So yeah, these teens were being bad.

1081
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:55,020
But I did think it was an interesting choice to keep Bugs' house lit up like this.

1082
00:53:55,020 --> 00:54:00,020
Because everything else is red and then Bugs' house is lit like a normal night.

1083
00:54:00,020 --> 00:54:04,020
Well, I will say this is still very scary.

1084
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:09,020
Maybe the scariest. I wasn't there. It might be the scariest thing I've seen so far.

1085
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:14,020
Well, like what is on his wall? Are those roots coming into the house?

1086
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:18,020
But isn't it above ground? There's no trees.

1087
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:21,020
Yeah, he's a remedy burrows underground. Thank you.

1088
00:54:21,020 --> 00:54:25,020
So you enter a underground world essentially.

1089
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:29,020
I mean the fridge almost looks like Flintstones-ish.

1090
00:54:29,020 --> 00:54:32,020
What does it look like on the outside?

1091
00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:35,020
It's not a big carrot, is it?

1092
00:54:35,020 --> 00:54:37,020
Oh shit, he might live in a big carrot.

1093
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:41,020
That's what I'm questioning. Where do the roots come from if it's a big carrot?

1094
00:54:41,020 --> 00:54:43,020
Someone new up here.

1095
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:45,020
Yeah, Mr. Smartypants.

1096
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:46,020
We're all lost now.

1097
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:49,020
Everyone will be put on the spot tonight.

1098
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:54,020
Yes, so yeah, that's either a root or a fucking fossil or something.

1099
00:54:56,020 --> 00:55:03,020
But okay, so yes, that was that kind of children's area that they just threw a red light on.

1100
00:55:03,020 --> 00:55:06,020
That was the red light district of Six Flags.

1101
00:55:06,020 --> 00:55:08,020
Oh no.

1102
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:12,020
Okay, Mike, so I'm sure you want to go in it?

1103
00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:14,020
Whatever you got is good.

1104
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:20,020
So I heard the audio loop and I met you and you said you got me a pudding cup and I said no.

1105
00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:22,020
Refused to eat it, yeah.

1106
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:23,020
Yes.

1107
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:30,020
And then I started to, so it was getting towards a time of, so I had mentioned they're doing this countdown.

1108
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:33,020
Attention to park goers, demons.

1109
00:55:33,020 --> 00:55:38,020
They're kind of getting up towards like the fright fest boundary.

1110
00:55:38,020 --> 00:55:41,020
And I'm like, oh, it's getting later, it's getting dark.

1111
00:55:41,020 --> 00:55:45,020
And there are still a lot of little kids here.

1112
00:55:45,020 --> 00:55:46,020
Yeah, yeah.

1113
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:51,020
And so at that point I said, Mike, I'm going to start an infant count.

1114
00:55:54,020 --> 00:56:00,020
Because I was really curious how many kids were going to stay for this.

1115
00:56:00,020 --> 00:56:02,020
Young kids.

1116
00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:08,020
Okay, so when I say infant count, they are in a stroller or one of these wagons you can rent.

1117
00:56:08,020 --> 00:56:11,020
And they can't walk far on their own.

1118
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:17,020
Well, look, the under three crowd, they love the conjuring universe.

1119
00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:23,020
They like Bluey, they like Annabelle the haunted doll.

1120
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:31,020
They were very sad to hear about the houses that weren't open on opening night.

1121
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:34,020
So there were a lot of infants.

1122
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:40,020
I'll just say my infant count total by the, so I started like around what, 730?

1123
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:44,020
I saw my last infant at 1130.

1124
00:56:44,020 --> 00:56:47,020
My total count was 18.

1125
00:56:50,020 --> 00:56:55,020
The one at 1130 was going into the park as we were leaving.

1126
00:56:58,020 --> 00:57:00,020
Because I go, I said 17.

1127
00:57:00,020 --> 00:57:03,020
And then I go, oh, no, 18.

1128
00:57:03,020 --> 00:57:05,020
As we were walking out.

1129
00:57:05,020 --> 00:57:10,020
Okay, so then we head towards the opening ceremony.

1130
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:17,020
Yes, and they do sort of, all the haunts do sort of an opening of the haunt, which is a fun thing.

1131
00:57:17,020 --> 00:57:25,020
And this one, similar to the one I think a couple years ago, where it was just they do a countdown and it feels like a warning.

1132
00:57:25,020 --> 00:57:29,020
And then they unleash all the monsters, people on stilts.

1133
00:57:30,020 --> 00:57:34,020
So this is in the DC area where they do this.

1134
00:57:34,020 --> 00:57:39,020
And there's a lot of, would you say generic clowns?

1135
00:57:39,020 --> 00:57:43,020
Yeah, I kept saying, is that Joker's son?

1136
00:57:43,020 --> 00:57:48,020
Because I don't know much about, like these guys know like this stuff.

1137
00:57:48,020 --> 00:57:49,020
And I'm like, is that Joker?

1138
00:57:49,020 --> 00:57:51,020
And Mike's like, that's not Joker.

1139
00:57:51,020 --> 00:57:53,020
I was like, they have the license to Joker.

1140
00:57:53,020 --> 00:57:55,020
Why didn't they just make it Joker?

1141
00:57:55,020 --> 00:58:03,020
Like this is, they use this, they use this image a lot around the park.

1142
00:58:03,020 --> 00:58:07,020
And there are a lot of the scare actors that do look like this.

1143
00:58:07,020 --> 00:58:09,020
This looks like the Joker.

1144
00:58:09,020 --> 00:58:11,020
It looks kind of the Joker.

1145
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:12,020
It's like, it's got the ha ha.

1146
00:58:12,020 --> 00:58:13,020
It's like Jane Leno the Joker.

1147
00:58:13,020 --> 00:58:15,020
Yeah.

1148
00:58:15,020 --> 00:58:16,020
You know what?

1149
00:58:16,020 --> 00:58:21,020
It looks a little more like Flabber from Big Bad Beetleborgs.

1150
00:58:21,020 --> 00:58:28,020
And written on his hair, it says ha ha, which is what you say when you watch Jane Leno.

1151
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:30,020
That's true.

1152
00:58:30,020 --> 00:58:31,020
You all say.

1153
00:58:31,020 --> 00:58:34,020
Do you hear about this gas leak?

1154
00:58:37,020 --> 00:58:40,020
So yeah, a lot of the scare actors are clowns, which makes sense.

1155
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:42,020
Obviously, Haunt has evil clowns.

1156
00:58:42,020 --> 00:58:49,020
But they're very much, to us, I think, suggesting that they're related to Joker and DC Universe without saying it.

1157
00:58:49,020 --> 00:58:50,020
Yes.

1158
00:58:50,020 --> 00:58:54,020
Because I suspect they don't have full license to make.

1159
00:58:54,020 --> 00:58:55,020
It has to be.

1160
00:58:55,020 --> 00:58:56,020
It has to be.

1161
00:58:56,020 --> 00:59:00,020
Because it's right by their Batmobile for the Batman coaster.

1162
00:59:00,020 --> 00:59:01,020
Yes.

1163
00:59:01,020 --> 00:59:03,020
Where like, there's all these clowns up to mischief.

1164
00:59:03,020 --> 00:59:11,020
But then there's pictures of Harley Quinn nearby to suggest in the park goers' mind.

1165
00:59:11,020 --> 00:59:14,020
I heard some guy say, Joker, can I have a picture?

1166
00:59:16,020 --> 00:59:19,020
So I mean, people, I think like it's kind of working.

1167
00:59:19,020 --> 00:59:23,020
I think it does work, yes, because of how Jokerish these performers are.

1168
00:59:23,020 --> 00:59:29,020
But I think in the eyes of David Zaslav, they are unrelated.

1169
00:59:32,020 --> 00:59:33,020
Yeah.

1170
00:59:35,020 --> 00:59:39,020
No, but in Halloween season, we celebrate the monsters.

1171
00:59:40,020 --> 00:59:42,020
Cheers, Zaslav.

1172
00:59:43,020 --> 00:59:48,020
That's who gets the final lantern of the Six Flags.

1173
00:59:48,020 --> 00:59:53,020
And then he gets it, and then he's like, he takes a piece of IP and throws it in his fireplace.

1174
00:59:55,020 --> 00:59:57,020
Here's a photo of us with...

1175
00:59:58,020 --> 00:59:59,020
Damn.

1176
01:00:00,020 --> 01:00:03,020
Yes, that's a great... Ooh, that's a really gross photo.

1177
01:00:03,020 --> 01:00:04,020
Yeah.

1178
01:00:06,020 --> 01:00:08,020
So in that photo, you see the logo.

1179
01:00:09,020 --> 01:00:14,020
So you see this all over the park, and it says, Snickers Presents.

1180
01:00:15,020 --> 01:00:22,020
And this really bugged me the entire night because there are no Snickers available.

1181
01:00:23,020 --> 01:00:27,020
You would think of Snickers as the main sponsor.

1182
01:00:27,020 --> 01:00:28,020
There would be Snickers everywhere.

1183
01:00:28,020 --> 01:00:32,020
You could buy a Snickers, or you could get a frozen Snickers from a cart.

1184
01:00:32,020 --> 01:00:35,020
There are no... We had to look so hard to find the Snickers.

1185
01:00:35,020 --> 01:00:39,020
The Snickers were buried under other candy bars in a little shop.

1186
01:00:39,020 --> 01:00:44,020
There was one candy shop we found, and then we were scouring them to find it.

1187
01:00:45,020 --> 01:00:49,020
And then in the very right, there was a couple Snickers bars.

1188
01:00:50,020 --> 01:00:52,020
But you would think, yeah, they would be plentiful.

1189
01:00:52,020 --> 01:00:54,020
You could put a fun-sized one in Graveyard Pudding.

1190
01:00:55,020 --> 01:00:56,020
Yes.

1191
01:00:56,020 --> 01:00:57,020
Done and done. Yes.

1192
01:00:58,020 --> 01:01:00,020
That's the body that's buried.

1193
01:01:01,020 --> 01:01:03,020
It's a little Snicker corpse.

1194
01:01:04,020 --> 01:01:07,020
But yes, Snickers seemingly has been around with Six Flags forever.

1195
01:01:07,020 --> 01:01:09,020
They must have signed a deal decades ago.

1196
01:01:10,020 --> 01:01:13,020
I can't... And they put $5,000 a year or something.

1197
01:01:14,020 --> 01:01:17,020
They forgot. It's not big enough to show up on a spreadsheet.

1198
01:01:18,020 --> 01:01:19,020
Not their concern.

1199
01:01:20,020 --> 01:01:23,020
There's a direct deposit from Snickers.

1200
01:01:25,020 --> 01:01:27,020
And no one is noticing.

1201
01:01:28,020 --> 01:01:29,020
That's still on AutoPay? Oh my God.

1202
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:31,020
I'm not going to say anything.

1203
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:32,020
Did you say anything?

1204
01:01:36,020 --> 01:01:37,020
There's so much Snickers everywhere.

1205
01:01:39,020 --> 01:01:40,020
And barely any actual bars.

1206
01:01:41,020 --> 01:01:42,020
But no available Snickers.

1207
01:01:43,020 --> 01:01:48,020
I think here's the time, and this is going to sound like I'm being ungrateful, and I'm not.

1208
01:01:49,020 --> 01:01:58,020
But part of getting a pass to go is that generally you get to skip a line so you get to experience everything.

1209
01:01:58,020 --> 01:02:00,020
This was not the case for Press Day.

1210
01:02:01,020 --> 01:02:04,020
There were two mazes we were allowed to skip the line for.

1211
01:02:05,020 --> 01:02:10,020
The other mazes we were allowed to be in a different line that was faster than the regular line.

1212
01:02:11,020 --> 01:02:14,020
And then we were not allowed to skip the lines on any of the roller coasters.

1213
01:02:15,020 --> 01:02:16,020
And the park was packed.

1214
01:02:17,020 --> 01:02:23,020
So we didn't get to do any roller coasters the whole time because of how much... we had to get to the mazes.

1215
01:02:24,020 --> 01:02:27,020
Yes. I'll also say most of the roller coasters were broken.

1216
01:02:28,020 --> 01:02:29,020
They were not working.

1217
01:02:30,020 --> 01:02:33,020
So it was creating... there was nowhere for people to go but the mazes.

1218
01:02:34,020 --> 01:02:36,020
Missing track. Car just taking off. It broke.

1219
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:41,020
Well, we did see a breakdown in front of us.

1220
01:02:42,020 --> 01:02:44,020
I saw a roller coaster... was it when you were in Willoughby's?

1221
01:02:45,020 --> 01:02:46,020
I think so.

1222
01:02:47,020 --> 01:02:48,020
So a coaster broke down going up the lift.

1223
01:02:49,020 --> 01:02:50,020
Oh yeah, I saw it too.

1224
01:02:51,020 --> 01:02:58,020
And a teen climbed the tiny staircase that runs parallel to the roller coaster track.

1225
01:02:59,020 --> 01:03:02,020
And there's people locked in, looking up.

1226
01:03:03,020 --> 01:03:08,020
And a few of them are going, I want off. I want off. I want off.

1227
01:03:09,020 --> 01:03:11,020
And the teen's not acknowledging them.

1228
01:03:12,020 --> 01:03:18,020
And the teen kind of comes down to the front of the car and kind of looks at it.

1229
01:03:18,020 --> 01:03:25,020
And kind of gives it a little... I'm not making this... gives it a little kick and stuff.

1230
01:03:26,020 --> 01:03:29,020
And something does something but nothing...

1231
01:03:30,020 --> 01:03:31,020
It was sort of on a lift hill.

1232
01:03:32,020 --> 01:03:34,020
It was on a lift hill off of the little staircase.

1233
01:03:35,020 --> 01:03:39,020
And then gives a thumbs up down to the control center.

1234
01:03:40,020 --> 01:03:43,020
And the thing started back up again.

1235
01:03:43,020 --> 01:03:53,020
And you know how when you're in a park and people are going up and they're excited and there's a little bit of giddiness?

1236
01:03:54,020 --> 01:03:56,020
I've never heard a more quiet roller coaster.

1237
01:03:57,020 --> 01:04:00,020
As they ascended and went.

1238
01:04:04,020 --> 01:04:06,020
They're just quietly saying the Hail Mary.

1239
01:04:06,020 --> 01:04:12,020
And then I said to you, I go, I don't care what's running today, I'm not getting on a roller coaster.

1240
01:04:13,020 --> 01:04:15,020
You really did not want to go on a roller coaster.

1241
01:04:16,020 --> 01:04:18,020
I just watched someone kick start a fucking car.

1242
01:04:19,020 --> 01:04:24,020
Because when we went the first time, we went on Twisted Colossus and it crushed my genitals.

1243
01:04:25,020 --> 01:04:28,020
And it made us feel like we were going to die.

1244
01:04:29,020 --> 01:04:32,020
And I did want to go on it but we would go over to the coaster and it was like an hour wait.

1245
01:04:32,020 --> 01:04:37,020
So it was literally like we can either do the mazes, which is what this event is for, or go.

1246
01:04:38,020 --> 01:04:43,020
So I'll say this right now, I do propose that we have to go back and do the coasters on a different episode.

1247
01:04:44,020 --> 01:04:48,020
I would like Fright Fest as far as, this is a franchise now obviously.

1248
01:04:49,020 --> 01:04:51,020
But it's going to have to, you know.

1249
01:04:52,020 --> 01:04:53,020
Snickers presents.

1250
01:04:54,020 --> 01:04:55,020
Snickers presents Fright Fest.

1251
01:04:56,020 --> 01:04:59,020
It's going to have to split off into its own sub-episode.

1252
01:04:59,020 --> 01:05:02,020
Well also, you know what I'm always saying, you got to experience the queue.

1253
01:05:03,020 --> 01:05:05,020
You can't skip the queue.

1254
01:05:06,020 --> 01:05:08,020
Well for Justice League that's true.

1255
01:05:09,020 --> 01:05:11,020
So we didn't, yeah, did not do any coasters.

1256
01:05:12,020 --> 01:05:15,020
I wanted to do Batman or Riddler's Revenge but we just literally didn't have time.

1257
01:05:16,020 --> 01:05:17,020
Right, right.

1258
01:05:18,020 --> 01:05:19,020
Okay, so the ceremony opened.

1259
01:05:20,020 --> 01:05:22,020
So the opening ceremony was beautiful.

1260
01:05:23,020 --> 01:05:24,020
It was great.

1261
01:05:25,020 --> 01:05:26,020
I mean it's really, I joke.

1262
01:05:27,020 --> 01:05:28,020
They did a great job.

1263
01:05:29,020 --> 01:05:36,020
I'll say like they really, they like, everyone's trying really hard.

1264
01:05:37,020 --> 01:05:38,020
They're putting a lot of effort in.

1265
01:05:39,020 --> 01:05:40,020
We love the effort.

1266
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:44,020
It's like Six Flags is holding these people back in a way.

1267
01:05:45,020 --> 01:05:46,020
The Six Flags, yes I agree.

1268
01:05:47,020 --> 01:05:49,020
The Six Flags corporation itself is the issue.

1269
01:05:50,020 --> 01:05:51,020
It's not the performers.

1270
01:05:52,020 --> 01:05:53,020
And again, thank you for the tickets.

1271
01:05:54,020 --> 01:05:55,020
But that said.

1272
01:05:55,020 --> 01:06:02,020
Well I Googled as we were sitting here because I was trying to find the quote that the newer CEO said like,

1273
01:06:03,020 --> 01:06:04,020
we want to change your image.

1274
01:06:05,020 --> 01:06:09,020
We don't want to just be like a babysitter park where people drop off their kids.

1275
01:06:10,020 --> 01:06:19,020
And I couldn't find that but the second result immediately I found was firing a Six Flags CEO, change.org petition.

1276
01:06:20,020 --> 01:06:22,020
How many people have signed on?

1277
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:25,020
1,434.

1278
01:06:26,020 --> 01:06:27,020
That's not very many.

1279
01:06:28,020 --> 01:06:29,020
They're trying to get to 1,500.

1280
01:06:30,020 --> 01:06:32,020
So far they haven't gotten there yet.

1281
01:06:33,020 --> 01:06:34,020
What does it say on there?

1282
01:06:35,020 --> 01:06:37,020
What's the reasoning for them wanting the CEO fired?

1283
01:06:38,020 --> 01:06:41,020
Given the current state of the Six Flags chain.

1284
01:06:42,020 --> 01:06:45,020
As a bonus to the radically different state five years ago.

1285
01:06:45,020 --> 01:06:57,020
In regards to his comments on the recent earnings call where he stated the guests were of the quote Kmart and Walmart category.

1286
01:06:58,020 --> 01:06:59,020
Jesus.

1287
01:07:00,020 --> 01:07:02,020
Well yeah, let's fire him in.

1288
01:07:03,020 --> 01:07:04,020
Let's sign the petition.

1289
01:07:05,020 --> 01:07:08,020
We're looking for the big lots and target crowd.

1290
01:07:09,020 --> 01:07:10,020
Put our names on that petition.

1291
01:07:11,020 --> 01:07:13,020
Jason pass that around so we can sign it.

1292
01:07:13,020 --> 01:07:16,020
And Zaslov cackled as he said he loved it.

1293
01:07:17,020 --> 01:07:19,020
Putting down his customers, how very rude.

1294
01:07:20,020 --> 01:07:25,020
But like all the photos that we've looked at like Walmarts and Kmarts are cleaner.

1295
01:07:26,020 --> 01:07:27,020
Yeah.

1296
01:07:28,020 --> 01:07:30,020
They're like full on grocery stores.

1297
01:07:31,020 --> 01:07:32,020
Yes.

1298
01:07:33,020 --> 01:07:34,020
You can find us Snickers at a Walmart.

1299
01:07:35,020 --> 01:07:36,020
I would hope.

1300
01:07:37,020 --> 01:07:40,020
There's like two Kmarts left and they're like, oh yeah.

1301
01:07:40,020 --> 01:07:41,020
I would hope.

1302
01:07:42,020 --> 01:07:45,020
There's like two Kmarts left and they look like they're functioning better.

1303
01:07:46,020 --> 01:07:47,020
Yes.

1304
01:07:48,020 --> 01:07:50,020
The snicker-less zone presented by Snickers.

1305
01:07:51,020 --> 01:07:54,020
The scariest concept of all.

1306
01:07:55,020 --> 01:07:57,020
What if all the Snickers disappeared?

1307
01:07:58,020 --> 01:08:01,020
We're going to get to the mazes but this brings up.

1308
01:08:02,020 --> 01:08:05,020
This brings up, okay, I joined a couple Facebook groups.

1309
01:08:05,020 --> 01:08:08,020
That are devoted to Six Flags Magic Mountain.

1310
01:08:09,020 --> 01:08:14,020
And a lot of like it's interesting because there's a lot of factions involved in these groups.

1311
01:08:15,020 --> 01:08:19,020
Some are very like goofing on Six Flags and some are like very defensive of it.

1312
01:08:20,020 --> 01:08:24,020
Like, you know, trying to say like, oh, there's great scare actors and the makeup people are great.

1313
01:08:25,020 --> 01:08:26,020
And that's probably all very valid and true.

1314
01:08:27,020 --> 01:08:33,020
And then you will get sort of a peek into controversies that are happening in the annual pass holder community.

1315
01:08:33,020 --> 01:08:38,020
And the big one that I noticed was there's an issue with the VIP lounge.

1316
01:08:41,020 --> 01:08:50,020
Apparently there is a tier of annual pass at Six Flags that on the website promised you access to a VIP lounge.

1317
01:08:51,020 --> 01:08:52,020
The Coca-Cola VIP lounge.

1318
01:08:53,020 --> 01:08:54,020
The Coca-Cola VIP lounge.

1319
01:08:55,020 --> 01:08:59,020
And all of a sudden in the last couple weeks Six Flags changed their policy.

1320
01:08:59,020 --> 01:09:02,020
And now you have to pay $11 to get in the VIP lounge.

1321
01:09:03,020 --> 01:09:05,020
And people are fucking furious.

1322
01:09:07,020 --> 01:09:09,020
Which I understand. It makes a lot of sense.

1323
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:13,020
So we had to check out what the VIP lounge was.

1324
01:09:14,020 --> 01:09:16,020
Yes. Okay, so this is outside.

1325
01:09:17,020 --> 01:09:18,020
Yeah.

1326
01:09:19,020 --> 01:09:21,020
Well, we got a lot of amenities here.

1327
01:09:22,020 --> 01:09:24,020
So we have a lot of amenities here.

1328
01:09:24,020 --> 01:09:25,020
So outside, yeah.

1329
01:09:26,020 --> 01:09:28,020
Well, we got a lot of amenities here.

1330
01:09:29,020 --> 01:09:32,020
Wait, the first one, the first one, in and out access.

1331
01:09:33,020 --> 01:09:36,020
So not only can you go in, you can leave as well.

1332
01:09:37,020 --> 01:09:38,020
Door functionality.

1333
01:09:39,020 --> 01:09:40,020
You're allowed to leave.

1334
01:09:41,020 --> 01:09:43,020
I know a lot of you thought you'd be able to go in and not come out.

1335
01:09:44,020 --> 01:09:47,020
I know people on the Facebook group are saying this is hell.

1336
01:09:49,020 --> 01:09:53,020
Don't worry everyone, Hotel California rules do not apply here.

1337
01:09:54,020 --> 01:10:02,020
Okay, so it reads, you know, for the listener, comfortable seating areas, massage chairs,

1338
01:10:03,020 --> 01:10:08,020
charging ports, video games, foosball table, free drinks and snacks.

1339
01:10:09,020 --> 01:10:11,020
Free they say, however, not anymore.

1340
01:10:12,020 --> 01:10:13,020
So not anymore, you have to pay $11 to get in.

1341
01:10:14,020 --> 01:10:17,020
First thing we noticed looking in, because Mike was like, maybe I'll do it.

1342
01:10:18,020 --> 01:10:20,020
And I was like, well, let's just like peek inside first.

1343
01:10:21,020 --> 01:10:23,020
And we peeked inside. Do we have a photo of that? Yes.

1344
01:10:24,020 --> 01:10:35,020
It's rough.

1345
01:10:36,020 --> 01:10:37,020
Scratched up window.

1346
01:10:38,020 --> 01:10:45,020
It's got like a Boys and Girls Club rec room energy to it.

1347
01:10:46,020 --> 01:10:48,020
Yes. A lot of stray wires.

1348
01:10:48,020 --> 01:10:55,020
Yes. It really looks like those memes of a picture of a nearly empty apartment.

1349
01:10:56,020 --> 01:10:59,020
And there's a flat screen TV and a dirty recliner.

1350
01:11:00,020 --> 01:11:02,020
It says, when men live alone.

1351
01:11:05,020 --> 01:11:08,020
Yes. 100%. So that's the...

1352
01:11:09,020 --> 01:11:11,020
That's the gaming house.

1353
01:11:12,020 --> 01:11:13,020
Gaming house.

1354
01:11:14,020 --> 01:11:16,020
Okay. So the first thing you'll notice in this picture, and I'll describe it.

1355
01:11:16,020 --> 01:11:19,020
So this is the gaming house. We're taking this from the outside in.

1356
01:11:20,020 --> 01:11:23,020
We didn't know if you could go in, you could come out at this point.

1357
01:11:24,020 --> 01:11:31,020
And there are one TV, and I watched this happening because there were a couple of teens in there.

1358
01:11:32,020 --> 01:11:34,020
One of them left their backpack, which is sitting on the ground there.

1359
01:11:35,020 --> 01:11:37,020
Their mom was not happy about that.

1360
01:11:38,020 --> 01:11:40,020
There were a lot of teens lingering here.

1361
01:11:41,020 --> 01:11:43,020
Yes. And it was the most teen presence I felt the whole night.

1362
01:11:43,020 --> 01:11:45,020
Heavy teen energy in this area.

1363
01:11:46,020 --> 01:11:50,020
And so the TV on the left definitely didn't work because the kids said so.

1364
01:11:51,020 --> 01:11:54,020
And the TV on the right, the Xbox was busted.

1365
01:11:55,020 --> 01:11:57,020
It was just on a loop trying to connect.

1366
01:11:58,020 --> 01:11:59,020
Nothing's on.

1367
01:12:00,020 --> 01:12:02,020
Yeah. Nothing's on. Also, the sign said there was a foosball table.

1368
01:12:03,020 --> 01:12:05,020
There was no foosball table.

1369
01:12:06,020 --> 01:12:08,020
We looked up and down for the foosball table.

1370
01:12:09,020 --> 01:12:10,020
That's the type of game they had.

1371
01:12:10,020 --> 01:12:12,020
If you could turn the Xbox on.

1372
01:12:13,020 --> 01:12:15,020
Foosball table, the video game.

1373
01:12:16,020 --> 01:12:17,020
Which is not available today.

1374
01:12:18,020 --> 01:12:19,020
I will say this.

1375
01:12:20,020 --> 01:12:24,020
I don't have a good photo of it, but they did have cookies and Sprite.

1376
01:12:25,020 --> 01:12:28,020
So you could get cookies and Sprite in there.

1377
01:12:29,020 --> 01:12:30,020
I'm listening.

1378
01:12:31,020 --> 01:12:33,020
Sleepy time bear is awake.

1379
01:12:35,020 --> 01:12:37,020
He's out of hibernation.

1380
01:12:37,020 --> 01:12:45,020
I go up to the person working, the lounge, and I said, oh, how much is it to get in?

1381
01:12:46,020 --> 01:12:50,020
And they said, well, it's $11 if you have the annual pass, or if you don't, it's $22.

1382
01:12:51,020 --> 01:12:54,020
And I was like, no, thanks. Thank you.

1383
01:12:55,020 --> 01:12:56,020
So we did not go in.

1384
01:12:57,020 --> 01:12:59,020
I guess we should have to get the free Sprite and cookie.

1385
01:13:00,020 --> 01:13:05,020
But it would be the most expensive Sprite ever procured.

1386
01:13:05,020 --> 01:13:09,020
Yeah. In hindsight, I think we should have. I should have at least done it.

1387
01:13:10,020 --> 01:13:12,020
Next time, I will spend the $22 to see.

1388
01:13:13,020 --> 01:13:17,020
Like, could you just clear out the Sprite in a garbage bag?

1389
01:13:18,020 --> 01:13:20,020
Like, they call it the Jason Sheridan.

1390
01:13:22,020 --> 01:13:23,020
Load up.

1391
01:13:24,020 --> 01:13:26,020
Bring a ForceFlex Glad bag with you.

1392
01:13:27,020 --> 01:13:29,020
Yeah, you got to get a sturdy...

1393
01:13:30,020 --> 01:13:31,020
Oh, you got to get ForceFlex.

1394
01:13:32,020 --> 01:13:33,020
Jason's preferred type of garbage bag.

1395
01:13:33,020 --> 01:13:34,020
Yeah.

1396
01:13:35,020 --> 01:13:42,020
I think maybe, yeah, if you had a ton of kids to feed, and maybe you could do it.

1397
01:13:43,020 --> 01:13:44,020
Yeah, maybe that's the new hack.

1398
01:13:45,020 --> 01:13:46,020
That could be.

1399
01:13:47,020 --> 01:13:50,020
Because it used to be you get the annual pass with the food plan, and you could eat every meal there.

1400
01:13:51,020 --> 01:13:53,020
And now you just go into the VIP lounge.

1401
01:13:54,020 --> 01:13:55,020
Get a sack of cans.

1402
01:13:56,020 --> 01:13:58,020
Maybe that's where Bugs is living now.

1403
01:14:00,020 --> 01:14:01,020
Okay, so that way we won't pass there.

1404
01:14:01,020 --> 01:14:02,020
You know what, I have something to say.

1405
01:14:03,020 --> 01:14:05,020
Once in a while you said, and then we'll get to the mazes.

1406
01:14:06,020 --> 01:14:08,020
I do not really care if you get to the mazes.

1407
01:14:09,020 --> 01:14:12,020
I hope there's like five more lounges to discuss.

1408
01:14:13,020 --> 01:14:14,020
I'm all about lounges.

1409
01:14:15,020 --> 01:14:16,020
There was, okay...

1410
01:14:17,020 --> 01:14:18,020
I want to hear a little about the mazes.

1411
01:14:19,020 --> 01:14:20,020
There's some questions I have.

1412
01:14:21,020 --> 01:14:22,020
From the Facebook group, I cropped up people's names here.

1413
01:14:23,020 --> 01:14:24,020
This is really funny.

1414
01:14:25,020 --> 01:14:27,020
Somebody said, Hurricane Harbor is having a staffing issue, and none of the slides are open today.

1415
01:14:28,020 --> 01:14:29,020
Only the lazy river and the wave pool.

1416
01:14:29,020 --> 01:14:32,020
So they can keep letting people in and taking their money instead of just, I'm so sick of this.

1417
01:14:33,020 --> 01:14:34,020
They will never see another annual passports from me.

1418
01:14:35,020 --> 01:14:37,020
They will never see another single red coin from me.

1419
01:14:38,020 --> 01:14:39,020
I'm done with what at one time was a great place to be.

1420
01:14:40,020 --> 01:14:42,020
And then the person comments, many of their employees are minors.

1421
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:44,020
They have school today.

1422
01:14:45,020 --> 01:14:49,020
It's probably busier today since LA USD is off.

1423
01:14:51,020 --> 01:14:58,020
So, maybe all the teens are now staffed at Hurricane Harbor, which is the park right next to Six Flags.

1424
01:14:59,020 --> 01:15:04,020
So if you join the Six Flags group on Facebook, that's sort of like the type of information you'll get.

1425
01:15:05,020 --> 01:15:07,020
Also Mike, your Facebook photo is Howard the Duck.

1426
01:15:08,020 --> 01:15:09,020
Yeah, he's playing a guitar.

1427
01:15:10,020 --> 01:15:11,020
Yeah, sweet.

1428
01:15:12,020 --> 01:15:14,020
Call him Howard the Duck.

1429
01:15:15,020 --> 01:15:16,020
And I can't feel it.

1430
01:15:17,020 --> 01:15:18,020
I love this song.

1431
01:15:19,020 --> 01:15:21,020
So, I had to eat a meal.

1432
01:15:22,020 --> 01:15:23,020
We talked about this last time.

1433
01:15:24,020 --> 01:15:27,020
I kept misremembering where things were from last time.

1434
01:15:27,020 --> 01:15:30,020
It's a very convoluted part.

1435
01:15:31,020 --> 01:15:32,020
It's hard.

1436
01:15:33,020 --> 01:15:35,020
It feels like it's changing around.

1437
01:15:36,020 --> 01:15:43,020
Like if you were to go in one building and come out, it's like changing geography.

1438
01:15:44,020 --> 01:15:49,020
And like you go, okay, so last time four years ago, the app was not even working at all.

1439
01:15:50,020 --> 01:15:51,020
It wasn't working this time.

1440
01:15:51,020 --> 01:15:52,020
It wasn't working this time.

1441
01:15:53,020 --> 01:15:58,020
Well, it was working technically better, but you would go in and you would click on something and it would say,

1442
01:15:59,020 --> 01:16:02,020
No ride found for this ride LD.

1443
01:16:03,020 --> 01:16:08,020
So you would continually get error messages when you would click on it.

1444
01:16:09,020 --> 01:16:11,020
Because we were trying to figure out where mazes were and it would just be,

1445
01:16:12,020 --> 01:16:19,020
and then this one was like, illegal input com dot Six Flags dot KMP dot core.

1446
01:16:19,020 --> 01:16:29,020
Live thrill level API model does not contain element with name un-cone.

1447
01:16:30,020 --> 01:16:31,020
Unknown is misspelled.

1448
01:16:35,020 --> 01:16:37,020
Dollar sign thrill level.

1449
01:16:38,020 --> 01:16:41,020
And Mike's like, why aren't we riding the coasters tonight?

1450
01:16:41,020 --> 01:16:48,020
So we ate at, so I ate at Johnny Rockets and we forgot, I almost, I forgot that you have to like,

1451
01:16:49,020 --> 01:16:51,020
if you want to drink a beer, you have to drink a beer in a pen.

1452
01:16:52,020 --> 01:16:54,020
They put you in a little pig pen.

1453
01:16:55,020 --> 01:16:58,020
And there were like two pig pens you're allowed to drink in.

1454
01:16:59,020 --> 01:17:02,020
One is by the Johnny Rockets and one is by, I know it's not a different Johnny Rockets,

1455
01:17:03,020 --> 01:17:04,020
but it feels right to say that.

1456
01:17:04,020 --> 01:17:05,020
But there's a separate Johnny Rockets.

1457
01:17:06,020 --> 01:17:07,020
So I did that.

1458
01:17:08,020 --> 01:17:09,020
The meal was insane.

1459
01:17:10,020 --> 01:17:11,020
Like it was like $50.

1460
01:17:12,020 --> 01:17:13,020
Are you serious?

1461
01:17:14,020 --> 01:17:18,020
I think I have, I bought a beer and then I bought us two, I bought a hamburger and fries.

1462
01:17:19,020 --> 01:17:22,020
I bought a beer and I bought two waters and it was 45.

1463
01:17:23,020 --> 01:17:24,020
Oh my God.

1464
01:17:25,020 --> 01:17:26,020
43.

1465
01:17:27,020 --> 01:17:29,020
With a little member benefits discount.

1466
01:17:29,020 --> 01:17:30,020
For the listener, Jason just fainted.

1467
01:17:33,020 --> 01:17:34,020
Oh, that's a sleeping cap.

1468
01:17:35,020 --> 01:17:36,020
It's kicking in.

1469
01:17:37,020 --> 01:17:40,020
A beer is like way more expensive than like California Adventure.

1470
01:17:41,020 --> 01:17:42,020
Like beer is like what?

1471
01:17:43,020 --> 01:17:44,020
$13, $14.

1472
01:17:45,020 --> 01:17:46,020
It's always climbing everywhere.

1473
01:17:47,020 --> 01:17:48,020
I'm not saying it's good.

1474
01:17:49,020 --> 01:17:50,020
I'm just saying I was like shocked.

1475
01:17:51,020 --> 01:17:52,020
So yeah, you get two.

1476
01:17:53,020 --> 01:17:54,020
So I was like $45.

1477
01:17:55,020 --> 01:17:56,020
And then I bought a beer.

1478
01:17:56,020 --> 01:17:57,020
So I was like $45.

1479
01:17:58,020 --> 01:18:01,020
And I felt like I became Jason Sheridan at that moment.

1480
01:18:02,020 --> 01:18:03,020
Like I embodied him.

1481
01:18:04,020 --> 01:18:10,020
But also this is what like now having done Shaqtoberfest that I finally did a Haunt thing.

1482
01:18:11,020 --> 01:18:14,020
I'm just like, I think rule of thumb, don't ever eat at any of these things.

1483
01:18:15,020 --> 01:18:17,020
For food, for cost, for shadiness.

1484
01:18:18,020 --> 01:18:19,020
Sure.

1485
01:18:20,020 --> 01:18:21,020
For life.

1486
01:18:22,020 --> 01:18:23,020
To live, to keep living my life.

1487
01:18:23,020 --> 01:18:26,020
You either eat there every day or not at all.

1488
01:18:27,020 --> 01:18:29,020
You know, those are the rules.

1489
01:18:30,020 --> 01:18:31,020
Those are the rules.

1490
01:18:32,020 --> 01:18:33,020
Train your stomach.

1491
01:18:36,020 --> 01:18:41,020
Okay, I think we now we start to head towards the haunts, right?

1492
01:18:42,020 --> 01:18:43,020
I'll say this.

1493
01:18:44,020 --> 01:18:47,020
I want to show a video that you took real quick of the DJ that was playing.

1494
01:18:53,020 --> 01:19:06,020
I really like the juxtaposition of that.

1495
01:19:07,020 --> 01:19:12,020
There was a rapid fire zoom in and out of Dippin' Dots carts.

1496
01:19:13,020 --> 01:19:15,020
That's what you should have had for dinner.

1497
01:19:16,020 --> 01:19:17,020
Yeah.

1498
01:19:18,020 --> 01:19:19,020
Only $28.

1499
01:19:20,020 --> 01:19:21,020
Per dot.

1500
01:19:23,020 --> 01:19:35,020
Okay, so I had one small thing before we get to the haunts, which we had to double back.

1501
01:19:36,020 --> 01:19:40,020
And what we didn't notice when we first walked in were the Six Flags.

1502
01:19:41,020 --> 01:19:46,020
And we didn't notice them because I don't think they think they were lit up because we were arriving during daytime.

1503
01:19:47,020 --> 01:19:49,020
At night, they were lit up.

1504
01:19:49,020 --> 01:19:52,020
And I said, Mike, look at the Six Flags.

1505
01:19:53,020 --> 01:19:55,020
They're flying at half mast.

1506
01:19:57,020 --> 01:20:03,020
Six Flags was flying at half mast for Dianne Feinstein.

1507
01:20:03,020 --> 01:20:21,020
All six flags.

1508
01:20:22,020 --> 01:20:24,020
All six? What do we think? Yes!

1509
01:20:25,020 --> 01:20:26,020
Of course all six.

1510
01:20:27,020 --> 01:20:28,020
Are you a monster?

1511
01:20:29,020 --> 01:20:31,020
And find out where Bugs is? Fuck!

1512
01:20:33,020 --> 01:20:37,020
More flags, more fun. But today, a little less fun.

1513
01:20:38,020 --> 01:20:40,020
In somber remembrance.

1514
01:20:41,020 --> 01:20:46,020
So they were all flying at half mast for Dianne.

1515
01:20:47,020 --> 01:20:48,020
Yeah.

1516
01:20:50,020 --> 01:20:53,020
So yeah, I put a little bit of a damper on the thing.

1517
01:20:54,020 --> 01:20:55,020
Can I show one?

1518
01:20:56,020 --> 01:21:01,020
You know, Mr. Six worked in her office in 1943.

1519
01:21:01,020 --> 01:21:08,020
Do you think Newsom appoints Mr. Six as the new senator?

1520
01:21:09,020 --> 01:21:15,020
That's right. He's as old as Biden, but he's got more energy.

1521
01:21:16,020 --> 01:21:17,020
Yeah, it's true.

1522
01:21:18,020 --> 01:21:20,020
Let me just, I just want to show a quick photo of an exterior.

1523
01:21:21,020 --> 01:21:22,020
Yeah.

1524
01:21:23,020 --> 01:21:26,020
Live life gear.

1525
01:21:27,020 --> 01:21:29,020
A building just says, live life gear.

1526
01:21:29,020 --> 01:21:30,020
Yikes. Yikes.

1527
01:21:31,020 --> 01:21:33,020
Not sure really what it means. Anyway.

1528
01:21:34,020 --> 01:21:36,020
So I guess we could talk about a minute.

1529
01:21:37,020 --> 01:21:40,020
I'm going to talk about the venue narc. We don't have, we shouldn't do too much more.

1530
01:21:41,020 --> 01:21:44,020
Which is horrible to say, because I could do this for three hours longer.

1531
01:21:45,020 --> 01:21:46,020
But just to be aware of.

1532
01:21:47,020 --> 01:21:48,020
Yeah, no, I, yeah, yeah.

1533
01:21:49,020 --> 01:21:50,020
This is what it is.

1534
01:21:51,020 --> 01:21:53,020
Unless we could just, let me keep it up until 5 a.m., right?

1535
01:21:54,020 --> 01:21:55,020
Yeah.

1536
01:21:56,020 --> 01:21:57,020
It's a sleepover now.

1537
01:21:57,020 --> 01:22:02,020
So I'll say something positive that I noticed from a distance.

1538
01:22:03,020 --> 01:22:07,020
Okay. Six Flags had a saw maze and a conjuring maze.

1539
01:22:08,020 --> 01:22:09,020
Yes.

1540
01:22:10,020 --> 01:22:11,020
That's licensed. The movies, people know.

1541
01:22:12,020 --> 01:22:13,020
That's right, yeah.

1542
01:22:14,020 --> 01:22:15,020
We did both of those.

1543
01:22:16,020 --> 01:22:18,020
We did both of those. Here's the thing. Fright Fest, we went on the 30th of September.

1544
01:22:19,020 --> 01:22:23,020
Fright Fest opened two weeks prior without the conjuring maze open or the saw maze open.

1545
01:22:23,020 --> 01:22:27,020
So people were going to Fright Fest without the two sort of headliner mazes open.

1546
01:22:28,020 --> 01:22:31,020
And people in the Facebook group were like tracking it like any action at the saw maze yet.

1547
01:22:32,020 --> 01:22:35,020
So people, they knew that's where saw was, but it wasn't open yet.

1548
01:22:36,020 --> 01:22:37,020
People were like, school started, be patient.

1549
01:22:41,020 --> 01:22:46,020
Well, hey, I saw that little jigsaw on a tricycle, so he might have had class.

1550
01:22:46,020 --> 01:22:48,020
Yeah, we should say, honestly, here's the thing.

1551
01:22:49,020 --> 01:22:53,020
We had a great time. Both saw maze and conjuring maze were really good.

1552
01:22:54,020 --> 01:22:57,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah. We went to saw first. Is that right, Mike?

1553
01:22:58,020 --> 01:23:08,020
We went to saw first. And this happens on some mazes where a lot of times the scares come from an actor, a clown, a crazy chainsaw man jumping out at you or something.

1554
01:23:09,020 --> 01:23:13,020
The saw maze is different. It's just people crawling out of the maze.

1555
01:23:13,020 --> 01:23:27,020
It is just sad people being hurt badly, irreparably hurt, begging for you to help them.

1556
01:23:28,020 --> 01:23:32,020
And you can't do anything. You want to.

1557
01:23:33,020 --> 01:23:35,020
So what you're saying is it was a six flags.

1558
01:23:40,020 --> 01:23:41,020
Got him.

1559
01:23:44,020 --> 01:23:46,020
They were so committed.

1560
01:23:47,020 --> 01:23:52,020
They were great. All the performers were great. And I don't have the one photo here that I sent you last night.

1561
01:23:53,020 --> 01:24:01,020
Possibly the most disturbing scene from a maze of all the haunts I've gone to this year is in the saw maze.

1562
01:24:02,020 --> 01:24:07,020
And it is a woman who is just in like a pile of syringes.

1563
01:24:08,020 --> 01:24:14,020
And there's like syringes sticking out of her arm. And boy, that sticks with you.

1564
01:24:15,020 --> 01:24:18,020
I didn't like that you sent it to me again.

1565
01:24:19,020 --> 01:24:26,020
It was in this at one point. I feel like some entity deleted it because it's so disturbing.

1566
01:24:26,020 --> 01:24:31,020
Right. Yeah. But it was. I said it was great. I didn't like it.

1567
01:24:32,020 --> 01:24:38,020
But they were really committed. That's your type of thing. I think you would probably enjoy it.

1568
01:24:39,020 --> 01:24:44,020
But I'll say that I liked and this is my preference of all these mazes.

1569
01:24:45,020 --> 01:24:52,020
When the scare actors kind of like, it feels like they're going off script a little. They're having a little fun with it.

1570
01:24:52,020 --> 01:24:57,020
So like a lot of the rooms you go past, they're like the person in the syringes or there's someone like,

1571
01:24:58,020 --> 01:25:02,020
his legs cut off or they're like tied up to something and they're like, help me, help me, help me.

1572
01:25:03,020 --> 01:25:11,020
And then one person, I think you heard this Mike, was someone was like a teenager and he goes, please, I have a family.

1573
01:25:17,020 --> 01:25:19,020
Which I really liked.

1574
01:25:20,020 --> 01:25:22,020
Everyone was great in there.

1575
01:25:23,020 --> 01:25:25,020
I'm someone's son.

1576
01:25:29,020 --> 01:25:31,020
I work at the water park.

1577
01:25:34,020 --> 01:25:37,020
Yeah. So that one was a little bit of a change up.

1578
01:25:38,020 --> 01:25:42,020
The conjuring, I guess, was my favorite, I think, of everything.

1579
01:25:43,020 --> 01:25:46,020
We should, God, I know we have so much. We're not going to get to.

1580
01:25:46,020 --> 01:25:48,020
It's a good sequel, I think.

1581
01:25:49,020 --> 01:25:53,020
Yeah, we'll do a sequel. On the way up to the conjuring, there's like a place that just sells glassware.

1582
01:25:54,020 --> 01:25:57,020
There's just a big booth that sells glassware.

1583
01:25:58,020 --> 01:26:00,020
It's like a place at a mall or something.

1584
01:26:01,020 --> 01:26:05,020
And like you can get like your name engraved on a piece of glass around like it's crazy.

1585
01:26:06,020 --> 01:26:08,020
And then we saw this.

1586
01:26:09,020 --> 01:26:11,020
We came so close.

1587
01:26:12,020 --> 01:26:14,020
It's the Jason mug with your favorite thing, soccer.

1588
01:26:14,020 --> 01:26:15,020
Soccer.

1589
01:26:16,020 --> 01:26:17,020
Football.

1590
01:26:18,020 --> 01:26:20,020
But yeah, the conjuring maze was really good.

1591
01:26:21,020 --> 01:26:23,020
And they do crazy stuff at Six Flags.

1592
01:26:24,020 --> 01:26:29,020
Like they change the elevation you're walking at sometimes, which is like that's not they don't do that at Horror Nights.

1593
01:26:30,020 --> 01:26:31,020
You don't walk downstairs in a maze.

1594
01:26:32,020 --> 01:26:33,020
That's just how the ground is there.

1595
01:26:34,020 --> 01:26:35,020
You had no choice.

1596
01:26:36,020 --> 01:26:39,020
Yeah. And there was a performer there you liked a lot.

1597
01:26:40,020 --> 01:26:41,020
That was the guy who kind of ushered us in.

1598
01:26:41,020 --> 01:26:42,020
So you go into the conjuring house.

1599
01:26:43,020 --> 01:26:49,020
The whole bit is it's the family's house and they have I don't know much about the conjuring, but I think it's like they collect the shit and you know.

1600
01:26:50,020 --> 01:26:55,020
Yeah, they're investigated paranormal investigators and everything's haunted in the room.

1601
01:26:56,020 --> 01:26:59,020
And then they for some reason keep the thing afterwards.

1602
01:27:00,020 --> 01:27:01,020
Yeah.

1603
01:27:02,020 --> 01:27:03,020
They don't learn their lesson.

1604
01:27:04,020 --> 01:27:09,020
And so we go in and there's a scaracter immediately and he goes, wait, wait, what are you doing in here?

1605
01:27:09,020 --> 01:27:10,020
And I'm like, this guy's great.

1606
01:27:11,020 --> 01:27:12,020
He was really selling it.

1607
01:27:13,020 --> 01:27:15,020
He goes, don't you know what happens at this time of night?

1608
01:27:16,020 --> 01:27:19,020
And he gives us this spiel of like, this is not this is not a house you want to be in.

1609
01:27:20,020 --> 01:27:21,020
Get out of here. Get out of here.

1610
01:27:22,020 --> 01:27:26,020
And then lightning crashes like there's an effect and he goes, oh, it's too late.

1611
01:27:27,020 --> 01:27:29,020
He goes to the basement, my friends.

1612
01:27:30,020 --> 01:27:35,020
And so we all run to the well, like, you know, head to the basement.

1613
01:27:35,020 --> 01:27:41,020
But there's just that natural lull that happens where like people are like walking into the next scare.

1614
01:27:42,020 --> 01:27:44,020
And I just tend to be like the last person to go in.

1615
01:27:45,020 --> 01:27:46,020
I'm not like that is excited.

1616
01:27:47,020 --> 01:27:48,020
I want those people to have that.

1617
01:27:49,020 --> 01:27:53,020
And so I kind of get stuck in the opening room with him for a second because like it's there's a lull.

1618
01:27:54,020 --> 01:27:58,020
And I look back at him and he goes to the basement.

1619
01:28:03,020 --> 01:28:04,020
Yeah, yeah, to the basement, to the basement.

1620
01:28:05,020 --> 01:28:08,020
As if I was going to like run out the front door.

1621
01:28:09,020 --> 01:28:10,020
Yeah, you can do it. Go ahead.

1622
01:28:11,020 --> 01:28:12,020
Come on.

1623
01:28:13,020 --> 01:28:14,020
To the basement, my friend.

1624
01:28:15,020 --> 01:28:16,020
That was your favorite guy the whole night.

1625
01:28:17,020 --> 01:28:18,020
I love that guy.

1626
01:28:19,020 --> 01:28:20,020
You kept talking about him.

1627
01:28:21,020 --> 01:28:22,020
Yes, I did like him. He was great. He had a great energy.

1628
01:28:23,020 --> 01:28:24,020
Kind of like an Orson Welles.

1629
01:28:25,020 --> 01:28:27,020
Yeah, 22 year old, a teen Orson Welles.

1630
01:28:28,020 --> 01:28:30,020
Orson Welles that worked at a water park.

1631
01:28:31,020 --> 01:28:32,020
Right.

1632
01:28:32,020 --> 01:28:34,020
I work the wave pool, my friend.

1633
01:28:35,020 --> 01:28:36,020
I guess I guess we can close out.

1634
01:28:37,020 --> 01:28:39,020
Let's just talk real quick about Sewer of Souls.

1635
01:28:40,020 --> 01:28:41,020
Okay.

1636
01:28:42,020 --> 01:28:48,020
Sewer of Souls is a returning maze, of course, and it is a maze where you wear 3D glasses.

1637
01:28:49,020 --> 01:28:51,020
And Gio remembered to bring his 3D glasses.

1638
01:28:52,020 --> 01:28:53,020
And it is very much the same.

1639
01:28:54,020 --> 01:28:55,020
But I'll say this.

1640
01:28:56,020 --> 01:28:58,020
We kind of trashed Sewer of Souls in a way a couple years ago.

1641
01:28:58,020 --> 01:29:03,020
And I think both of us left Sewer of Souls this year realizing we made a big mistake.

1642
01:29:04,020 --> 01:29:05,020
Yeah.

1643
01:29:06,020 --> 01:29:07,020
We kind of loved Sewer of Souls this time.

1644
01:29:08,020 --> 01:29:10,020
Yes, especially when you're not wearing the glasses.

1645
01:29:11,020 --> 01:29:17,020
The glasses are, they say on them, only for viewing of chroma depth 3D images.

1646
01:29:18,020 --> 01:29:20,020
That's not what's in Sewer of Souls.

1647
01:29:21,020 --> 01:29:22,020
No.

1648
01:29:23,020 --> 01:29:26,020
Sewer of Souls is just like props and like black lights and stuff.

1649
01:29:26,020 --> 01:29:27,020
A bunch of poop?

1650
01:29:28,020 --> 01:29:31,020
Yes, a big pile of shit where like a woman's standing next to it.

1651
01:29:32,020 --> 01:29:33,020
And she says, do you want some?

1652
01:29:35,020 --> 01:29:37,020
That's the first scene in Sewer of Souls.

1653
01:29:38,020 --> 01:29:39,020
Wow.

1654
01:29:40,020 --> 01:29:41,020
You want some?

1655
01:29:42,020 --> 01:29:43,020
It's a big pile of shit.

1656
01:29:44,020 --> 01:29:46,020
$11 for annual pass holders.

1657
01:29:47,020 --> 01:29:49,020
$22 for general audience.

1658
01:29:52,020 --> 01:29:54,020
The Coca-Cola Sewer of Souls.

1659
01:29:57,020 --> 01:30:00,020
Sorry, our Xbox Series S is down.

1660
01:30:01,020 --> 01:30:06,020
There's one part of Sewer of Souls where I believe you're getting shit out of a big anus.

1661
01:30:07,020 --> 01:30:12,020
Because there's a big inflatable like Scott suit on both sides and you're kind of pushing through it.

1662
01:30:13,020 --> 01:30:18,020
And Gion are like, wait a minute, did we not notice this last time that you're going through an anus?

1663
01:30:19,020 --> 01:30:21,020
It's like the implication is like you are now the shit.

1664
01:30:22,020 --> 01:30:23,020
You are the shit.

1665
01:30:23,020 --> 01:30:25,020
You become be the shit.

1666
01:30:26,020 --> 01:30:28,020
So please enjoy as you're exiting tonight.

1667
01:30:29,020 --> 01:30:32,020
We've set up some inflatable anuses as you.

1668
01:30:33,020 --> 01:30:35,020
Happy squeezing.

1669
01:30:36,020 --> 01:30:37,020
I know we're in the home stretch here.

1670
01:30:38,020 --> 01:30:39,020
I just wanted to make a note.

1671
01:30:40,020 --> 01:30:41,020
Mike, you were offered the shit, the big pile.

1672
01:30:42,020 --> 01:30:43,020
And she said, do you want some?

1673
01:30:44,020 --> 01:30:45,020
And then you go, what?

1674
01:30:46,020 --> 01:30:47,020
And she goes, we've got plenty.

1675
01:30:48,020 --> 01:30:49,020
Which made me laugh.

1676
01:30:50,020 --> 01:30:51,020
That was good.

1677
01:30:51,020 --> 01:30:52,020
She was really fun.

1678
01:30:53,020 --> 01:30:54,020
She really was good.

1679
01:30:55,020 --> 01:30:56,020
I mean that sincerely.

1680
01:30:57,020 --> 01:30:58,020
That was really good.

1681
01:30:59,020 --> 01:31:01,020
And we both left Sewer of Souls going, Sewer of Souls is good.

1682
01:31:02,020 --> 01:31:03,020
We like Sewer of Souls.

1683
01:31:04,020 --> 01:31:05,020
We were too hard on it.

1684
01:31:06,020 --> 01:31:07,020
And there were things you didn't remember.

1685
01:31:08,020 --> 01:31:09,020
And you go, that must be new.

1686
01:31:10,020 --> 01:31:11,020
And I was like, it's not.

1687
01:31:12,020 --> 01:31:13,020
I looked it up.

1688
01:31:14,020 --> 01:31:15,020
I think it's because I didn't wear the glasses.

1689
01:31:16,020 --> 01:31:19,020
I feel like they would pass these around like a dare officer and be like, this is what drinking is like.

1690
01:31:19,020 --> 01:31:21,020
Yeah, it's just making you disoriented.

1691
01:31:22,020 --> 01:31:23,020
They're horrible.

1692
01:31:24,020 --> 01:31:25,020
Do you want to put them on for a moment?

1693
01:31:26,020 --> 01:31:27,020
They also gave us kind of 3D glasses like that.

1694
01:31:28,020 --> 01:31:36,020
When we went to the Christmas like drive through and it made it look like, you know, every light was like snowflakes or snowmen or stuff.

1695
01:31:37,020 --> 01:31:38,020
You drove with these?

1696
01:31:39,020 --> 01:31:40,020
But no, but that's what I was about to say.

1697
01:31:41,020 --> 01:31:42,020
They handed us these.

1698
01:31:43,020 --> 01:31:47,020
They went, here's your pounded half a fudge and here's your Christmas glasses.

1699
01:31:47,020 --> 01:31:49,020
And I'm like, I have to drive.

1700
01:31:50,020 --> 01:31:52,020
I am not going to put these on.

1701
01:31:53,020 --> 01:31:57,020
All right. I guess I'll just park, finish the fudge, then get on the road.

1702
01:31:58,020 --> 01:32:00,020
Well, how do we go out here?

1703
01:32:01,020 --> 01:32:02,020
I'm sorry. It's hard. I know.

1704
01:32:03,020 --> 01:32:06,020
There's so much stuff and we obviously that we're going to have to, it's going to have to have a sequel.

1705
01:32:07,020 --> 01:32:09,020
I mean, also, here's the thing.

1706
01:32:10,020 --> 01:32:11,020
Here's the thing.

1707
01:32:12,020 --> 01:32:15,020
For to do a Fright Fest 3, we need to add some people to the team.

1708
01:32:15,020 --> 01:32:20,020
Okay. So we can't just, it can't just be Gio and I going to Fright Fest every year.

1709
01:32:21,020 --> 01:32:22,020
Now, Scott has leveled up his haunt game.

1710
01:32:23,020 --> 01:32:24,020
That's true. Yes, with the help of Shaq.

1711
01:32:25,020 --> 01:32:31,020
But I'm going to need, I'm going to need a pledge from two other guys that they're going to, they're going to Fright Fest with us.

1712
01:32:32,020 --> 01:32:38,020
You know what? I honestly, I kind of wanted to this time around, but I had a wedding to attend.

1713
01:32:39,020 --> 01:32:40,020
So I was at a wedding that night.

1714
01:32:40,020 --> 01:32:48,020
But let me say, let me get oddly heartfelt for an episode that was just about a bunch of shit and a big anus.

1715
01:32:49,020 --> 01:32:50,020
That I like.

1716
01:32:51,020 --> 01:32:52,020
Just.

1717
01:32:54,020 --> 01:33:00,020
I'm at this wedding. I've had a drink or two and I see a picture of the boys back at it.

1718
01:33:01,020 --> 01:33:02,020
And Janiel, I texted you this Mike.

1719
01:33:03,020 --> 01:33:05,020
I was genuinely like, wow, Mike and Gio are there again.

1720
01:33:06,020 --> 01:33:08,020
I've never felt more like a nerd for my own podcast.

1721
01:33:08,020 --> 01:33:11,020
I'm so happy the dynamic duo made it back.

1722
01:33:12,020 --> 01:33:14,020
And I would love to join next time around.

1723
01:33:15,020 --> 01:33:16,020
Yeah.

1724
01:33:17,020 --> 01:33:18,020
All right.

1725
01:33:19,020 --> 01:33:30,020
And before we can let you go, I think we have to give you a really big, we can't let a Fright Fest episode end without this is a big old say the line Bart situation.

1726
01:33:31,020 --> 01:33:32,020
Do you know what line we're referring to?

1727
01:33:33,020 --> 01:33:35,020
I think it'll help. I think it'll help if I put this image up.

1728
01:33:35,020 --> 01:33:40,020
There's Mrs. Tass.

1729
01:33:42,020 --> 01:33:44,020
There he is with her.

1730
01:33:45,020 --> 01:33:50,020
She's wearing the clockwork orange glasses to pry her eyes open.

1731
01:33:51,020 --> 01:33:52,020
That's right.

1732
01:33:53,020 --> 01:33:54,020
That's right. A fresh coat of paint we thought.

1733
01:33:55,020 --> 01:33:57,020
They do look good. Yeah, yeah.

1734
01:33:58,020 --> 01:33:59,020
They look good. Does it make you think anything?

1735
01:34:00,020 --> 01:34:03,020
Yeah. I mean, Six Flags sucks and I love it.

1736
01:34:03,020 --> 01:34:06,020
Yes. He did it. He did it.

1737
01:34:08,020 --> 01:34:12,020
Anthony Gio, you survived podcast The Fright.

1738
01:34:13,020 --> 01:34:15,020
You know, we're here. You know, I know you got to get out of here.

1739
01:34:16,020 --> 01:34:19,020
You have a prior engagement, so we'll let you go and we'll do the wrap up without you.

1740
01:34:20,020 --> 01:34:21,020
But give it up for Anthony Gio, ladies and gentlemen.

1741
01:34:22,020 --> 01:34:23,020
So happy to have you back.

1742
01:34:24,020 --> 01:34:25,020
Incredible.

1743
01:34:26,020 --> 01:34:29,020
Hey, enjoy your screening of Killers of the Flower Moon.

1744
01:34:30,020 --> 01:34:31,020
It starts at midnight over there.

1745
01:34:31,020 --> 01:34:32,020
Yeah, yeah, you'll be fine.

1746
01:34:33,020 --> 01:34:34,020
All right. That's Anthony Gio, folks.

1747
01:34:35,020 --> 01:34:36,020
That's Anthony Gio.

1748
01:34:37,020 --> 01:34:40,020
Hey, as for us, you survived podcast The Fright Live.

1749
01:34:41,020 --> 01:34:42,020
Really happy to have you here.

1750
01:34:43,020 --> 01:34:44,020
And...

1751
01:34:45,020 --> 01:34:46,020
Boys, boys.

1752
01:34:47,020 --> 01:34:48,020
Oh, what?

1753
01:34:49,020 --> 01:34:50,020
Whoa.

1754
01:34:51,020 --> 01:34:52,020
Whoa.

1755
01:34:53,020 --> 01:34:54,020
Whoa.

1756
01:34:55,020 --> 01:34:56,020
That's so odd.

1757
01:34:57,020 --> 01:34:59,020
Right as there is an exit, there is also an exit.

1758
01:34:59,020 --> 01:35:00,020
What?

1759
01:35:01,020 --> 01:35:02,020
What the fuck is that?

1760
01:35:03,020 --> 01:35:05,020
Don't you remember? It's been so long.

1761
01:35:06,020 --> 01:35:07,020
It's the Sector Keeper.

1762
01:35:08,020 --> 01:35:09,020
Wow.

1763
01:35:10,020 --> 01:35:12,020
We haven't talked to the Sector Keeper in years.

1764
01:35:13,020 --> 01:35:14,020
Sector Keeper.

1765
01:35:15,020 --> 01:35:16,020
What's going on, buddy?

1766
01:35:17,020 --> 01:35:21,020
I'm flying high and I'm feeling fine.

1767
01:35:22,020 --> 01:35:23,020
Oh, wow.

1768
01:35:24,020 --> 01:35:25,020
The boys are so good.

1769
01:35:25,020 --> 01:35:26,020
I'm feeling fine.

1770
01:35:27,020 --> 01:35:28,020
Oh, wow.

1771
01:35:29,020 --> 01:35:33,020
Boys, boys, all your talk of Halloween haunts has awoken my ghostly spirit.

1772
01:35:34,020 --> 01:35:37,020
And now I have an important mission for you.

1773
01:35:38,020 --> 01:35:39,020
Oh, my God.

1774
01:35:40,020 --> 01:35:43,020
Well, look, the clock is ticking. We do not have time to get into the mission.

1775
01:35:44,020 --> 01:35:45,020
Is there some way that you could just give us the gist of it?

1776
01:35:46,020 --> 01:35:47,020
Yeah, yeah, let's just get to the gist of it.

1777
01:35:48,020 --> 01:35:50,020
So, yes, I'll tell you more very, very soon.

1778
01:35:51,020 --> 01:35:54,020
But for now, there's only one place this mission can be achieved.

1779
01:35:55,020 --> 01:36:00,020
Beautiful, sunny Orlando.

1780
01:36:01,020 --> 01:36:03,020
Oh, okay.

1781
01:36:04,020 --> 01:36:09,020
Well, I guess we're well, I mean, I would say yes, but we don't have any choice in this, do we?

1782
01:36:10,020 --> 01:36:11,020
No.

1783
01:36:12,020 --> 01:36:13,020
Okay.

1784
01:36:14,020 --> 01:36:16,020
I don't want to get haunted. So, hey, thank you so much for popping in Sector Keeper.

1785
01:36:17,020 --> 01:36:18,020
We'll talk about it soon.

1786
01:36:19,020 --> 01:36:20,020
We'll see you soon, boys.

1787
01:36:20,020 --> 01:36:21,020
Oh, my God.

1788
01:36:22,020 --> 01:36:24,020
I will inflate here.

1789
01:36:25,020 --> 01:36:27,020
Wow, what a great guest array.

1790
01:36:28,020 --> 01:36:30,020
And you survived. I'm going to try to inflate right at the very end.

1791
01:36:31,020 --> 01:36:33,020
Hey, Minotaur, if you're back there, come say good night.

1792
01:36:34,020 --> 01:36:35,020
But you survived haunt cast the Fright.

Thanks to the Minotaur.

1798
01:36:47,020 --> 01:36:48,020
No!

1799
01:36:49,020 --> 01:36:50,020
No!

1800

Thank you so much, Matt. And thank you all for coming.
