00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Hi everyone. This episode was recorded a while ago. A simpler time when the only thing we had to worry about was a global pandemic.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:18,000
We again want to voice our support for the protests against police brutality going on across the country and now across the world.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The other day on Twitter we linked to bail funds and mutual aid funds.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:32,000
There's also links in this episode description to GoFundMe pages for the family of Breonna Taylor and Darnella Frazier, who recorded the murder of George Floyd.

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
As well as a group called BEAM that focuses on black mental health and the National Lawyers Guild.

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Thank you for listening. Stay safe and once again, black lives matter.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Podcasting Titan Mike Mitchell joins us for the ultimate discussion of churros on Podcast The Ride.

8
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, the only theme park podcast where we have to stop halfway through every episode to swap out the six propane tanks that power the show.

9
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I'm Jason Sheridan, joined as always by Mike Carlson.

10
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Yes, I am Mike Carlson. Yes, we're doing something backwards I feel like as far as being able to record here.

11
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I feel like we're using an old school way of powering. We really should just use some sort of electrical system, but we're not.

12
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:01,000
No, no, we're using clean burning propane. Was that a Johnny Carson?

13
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
No, that was Hank Hill. It was Hank Hill. Yeah, it's close though. It's close. That's Scott Gardner.

14
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Yeah, yeah, good voice and good recording method. Yeah, I mean now that we all have our six separate tanks, we're certainly burning through a lot, but it's the only way to get it done.

15
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Yeah, you gotta do what you gotta do.

16
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Yeah, boy, this is a fun one. This is fun to talk about for a little while. Talk about things you miss from the days of theme parks being open.

17
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I'm excited to have some mouth memories.

18
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:45,000
What was wrong with that? That was an acceptable phrase I feel. You hit me recently for saying gross stuff, but that one, I don't know why that one hits me real strange.

19
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Mouth memories. It's perfectly natural when you're thinking about something you ate once, it's a mouth memory.

20
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'm impressed. I love it.

21
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:04,000
And today it's mouth memories of one of our favorite things to munch on, which is a big foot long rod. It's mouth memories of foot long rods.

22
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
What is this? What is this innuendo?

23
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,000
These are just things that I'm saying innuendo. I don't know what you're talking about. It's what a churro is.

24
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
This is not our podcast. This is not the podcast I know.

25
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Hey, let's bring in our guest, a man who deals professionally with mouth memories. You know him from the Doughboys and the Birthday Boys. It's Mike Mitchell.

26
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Hey guys, how are you?

27
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Hi Mitch.

28
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Great. Thanks for joining us.

29
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I don't know if I want to be known as the mouth memories guy, but I guess I'll take it.

30
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Provisional mouth memory historian, Mike Mitchell.

31
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I do have a lot of good nice, nice mouth memories over the years.

32
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It's like, it's like regular life where you have, you have good memories and bad memories. The bad memories usually just burn in your mouth.

33
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I think burning your mouth is the bad memories.

34
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Yeah, nothing like a burning, but burning sensation, burning mouth memory. No, acidic. You don't like that.

35
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Yeah, we're getting like, I don't know, when you're younger getting dirt or fucking dog shit in your mouth or something.

36
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
What? Dog shit?

37
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
You know how kids, you know how kids always wrestle around and get a bunch of dog shit in their mouth?

38
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I mean that wasn't my experience, but.

39
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Ah man, that happens all the time back where I'm from.

40
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Jason, Jason, do you have that experience as well since you're more from that part of the country?

41
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Well, no, but I'm not the king of mouth memories, you know, I'm not.

42
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Maybe this is, this is maybe a good point of discussion. What is everyone's worst mouth memory?

43
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
What is the worst thing that you've had in your mouth?

44
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
And I'll start just to give you guys time to think of one.

45
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
One time I was really dumb as a kid, although still too old of a kid.

46
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I think I might have been nine or 10 and I had, I was so absent minded that I let, I think I did like chew on stuff.

47
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I wasn't supposed to chew on like toys and even like a wire or something.

48
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I did chew stupidly and I picked up, I was like, you know,

49
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:17,000
robotically picking up a glass of water and then just instead picked up a like a loose wire of like an AC adapter.

50
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I remember it was for a portable TV and I just put it in my mouth against my tongue and it gave me a shock.

51
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,000
So probably the stupidest thing I ever did.

52
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It wasn't that bad of a shock, but definitely a shock.

53
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,000
That is, that is more insane than wrestling around and getting dog shit in your mouth.

54
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It really is because I chose it. There were plenty of things that there was, there were edible things near me.

55
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
There was water. Yeah. Why would I put just the end of a plug?

56
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Did your hair frizz out like a mad scientist?

57
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
And I became a different person.

58
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I started to like speak in different voices as if I was getting different frequencies from the radio.

59
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Right. Yeah. You know, baddie coda-esque situation.

60
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Wow. Are you, can you still, do you still feel electrified on certain nights?

61
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:19,000
If you ever see anything weird happening, you know, the like patterns in the sky or what you think might be happening in the sky,

62
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
or what you think might be a meteor shower. It's, it's me.

63
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
It's still residual from this nine year old accident.

64
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Wow. That's crazy. You're like a Jamie Foxx electro character from The Amazing Spider-Man 2.

65
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Jesus. What? What? What's wrong?

66
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It's a good, a good mind memory. That movie. Yeah.

67
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:55,000
That I will say that it's the music when like Electro is like turns into Electro or whatever is so bad that it is kind of funny.

68
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Isn't there like, isn't there a music, isn't there music that's like Electro Man?

69
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Like there's like weird background music when he becomes Electro. Do you know what I'm talking about?

70
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I think I do, but I don't. Yeah. Yeah, I kind of do, but I don't know. I don't remember anything about it.

71
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I mean, I just, I remember just like the whole thing is ridiculous and I was laughing the whole time.

72
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Let me just say this is wrong, but it's something like Electrify, like kill them all, Electrify.

73
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
It's very, very, very shitty. I remember that much.

74
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Man, I'm trying to find it. I can't. I, ooh, if we, if we find it, we'll post it though. I want to hear this.

75
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
If not, we'll just lay in. We'll like use that little sample of you just now.

76
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
We'll make another track and we'll lay it under the actual movie.

77
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:53,000
That'll just be what people think. Like your mind, everyone's mind memory of this in 20 years will now be your soundtrack for Electro.

78
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Any other mouth memories?

79
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Well, the night, oh, you're asking Mitch or you're asking all of us?

80
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Anybody.

81
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Well, my, the, if you want a bad one and it's not, I want the worst.

82
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
As bad as you can go.

83
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Okay. Well, I had a surgery when I was, I think in eighth, seventh or eighth grade, because I had too much gum.

84
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Like there was too much gum in my mouth and not chewing gum, gum.

85
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Spearmint? Oh damn.

86
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,000
No, no, no. I had like excess gum and they were like, well, we're going to cut it off.

87
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Oh.

88
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:32,000
So I went and had a surgery and they put me out for it, but I remember it.

89
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
So it was like one of those surgeries where like they didn't really like completely knock you out.

90
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I think they just gave me the gas.

91
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:48,000
So I, I have memory of being kind of half asleep and woozy, feeling like a knife on my gums.

92
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Whoa.

93
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Oh my God.

94
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Dear Lord.

95
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
It was, it was kind of traumatic.

96
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
This is a, this is a joker origin story.

97
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Yes. That's a good point.

98
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Gas that made you crazy.

99
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
And then a knife on your face.

100
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:13,000
And I asked for the mirror and the surgeon, surgeon gave me the mirror and I said, oh wow, that looks a lot better.

101
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Thank you.

102
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
That's great.

103
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
That, that mirror moment is great.

104
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
And the Simpsons, it was, it was Perry on Simpsons, which you know, yes.

105
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
That's one of those where I knew the parody first and not maybe had not seen the original yet.

106
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Oh wow.

107
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Yeah.

108
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Yeah.

109
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I have some bad mouth memories.

110
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Let's see.

111
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:45,000
One of my, one of my first ones, and I think that it like made me hate this creature more than anything is that I had a, I was at my grandma's house and I had a Coca-Cola and it was on the porch.

112
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I took a sip of it and then in my mouth I felt moving.

113
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
What I pulled out was a carpenter ant.

114
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Oh man.

115
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Pretty big.

116
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:03,000
And it was, and it, and it, and it just stuck with me forever that I could like feel all of its legs in my mouth.

117
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Oh yeah. I'm looking those up.

118
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Those are huge.

119
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Oh my God.

120
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Like, like a penny sized.

121
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Yeah.

122
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
People, it's funny because like people on people in California are like, ants are cool.

123
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
And look, ants are cool in their own way.

124
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Like they like are, you know, they do their little thing and they're like, they're like a little crew and they're really tiny out here.

125
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:30,000
But on the East Coast, we just have a lot of carpenter ants, which are kind of like these bigger black ants.

126
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,000
And they like are more to me, like they always felt more like cockroaches were like in your kitchen or something.

127
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:43,000
And if you had stuff out there would just be like, you'd move it and then there'd be like seven of those big things and they'd all scatter and it sucked.

128
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Yeah.

129
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:55,000
But I also ate, I also was at the, I was at LAX airport and I ate a Labre bakery sandwich and I bit into it and there was a stone in it, like a little rock.

130
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Oh, that was a bad mouth memory.

131
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I have a lot of bad mouth memories.

132
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Mitch, didn't you, weren't you with me somewhere where you bit into something hard?

133
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Yeah, I was at, it was at, what's it called? The Hillstone.

134
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Oh yeah.

135
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I think so.

136
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Oh, was it bone?

137
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Yeah, it was bone. Yeah, it was from the, it was from the French dip sandwich.

138
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Yeah, I think I've had a similar experience with that same establishment and that same sandwich.

139
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Really?

140
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Yeah, I think they're just, I think they're just going too fast because they do everything but from scratch there.

141
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
And I think sometimes they're just going too fast.

142
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Not that I want to drag out all the, I have a couple of quick bad mouth memories.

143
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Sure.

144
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Or worse than the bone.

145
00:11:52,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Okay, so both, so two, the first time, I think it was like one of the most I've ever been sick to my stomach and it felt like such a betrayal because I liked it so much, the place, and it was the Wendy's Super Bar.

146
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
That's what it's called. Can someone, anyone know if that's right?

147
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
They used to have a little buffet. I think it was called the Super Bar.

148
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:40,000
And it was salad, tacos, and spaghetti. And we loved it. Everyone in my family loved it. And I had it when I was like once in elementary or middle school, went to bed and just woke up in the middle of the night and just, it was just bad.

149
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:48,000
But in terms of unpleasantness, I got my wisdom teeth out.

150
00:12:48,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Summer after my junior year in college. And I was, you know, on the mend for like three or four days. Like I was starting to feel better. So I went into this desk job internship I had, you know, the Monday after.

151
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I think I had it done on a Thursday. And I was like, I think I'm okay to go into work. And it was starting to hurt. And so I just like took a Vicodin or whatever. And then it was like lunchtime. And I'm like, man, I'm starving.

152
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I just like kind of started doing solid food again. And I went and I, because it's me, I got a kielbasa sandwich.

153
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:43,000
A big kielbasa because I just wanted some comfort food. And I bit in and it was one of the most painful sensations I've ever experienced.

154
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Oh my God.

155
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:55,000
No spices and the salt or everything. And I just like threw it in the garbage and went to my boss and was like, I'm sorry. I have to go home.

156
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I overestimated how I was feeling.

157
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,000
That's a tough surface. Like it can be pretty taut. The sausage casing.

158
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Yeah, for sure. One of the most taut foods.

159
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Pretty taut. Yeah. Soft to roll but taut surface. Yeah, you're right.

160
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
It's tauter. Yeah. Is there a tauter food? Mitch, you're the expert.

161
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Hmm. I tauter. No, I mean my stone sandwich from La Brea Baker is more taut.

162
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Stones are very taut. Yes.

163
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I, Jason, I went out too early after I had my wisdom teeth removed and I went drinking.

164
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:47,000
And I remember just like blood leaking into my mouth from the wounds, like from the spots where I was stitched up in my mouth.

165
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Yeah, mine was. I shouldn't have been drinking booze.

166
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Yeah, mine stuck around. My recovery was long. I had sores for a while.

167
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Bone spurs, little pieces of bone slowly peeking through my gums.

168
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
God, you couldn't serve. Yeah, I was going to say.

169
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Yeah, yeah. I was using prescription grade mouthwash for like months after that.

170
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Bone spurs in your mouth? Bone spurs, yeah.

171
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
That's wild. I was back to work like a day later after my wisdom teeth were gone.

172
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I know everyone has a wildly different experience with that. My friend was in bed for like two weeks.

173
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
And I was back to work like the next day. It's weird how that is.

174
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:39,000
By the way, I was going to say a tot food taffy. Is taffy tot?

175
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I think so because there's a pull to it. That seems right.

176
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
There is a pull to it, but it is also like, oh yeah, you're right. I guess I don't know. You're right.

177
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,000
It's something that's tight, right? Like a, oh, jerky, beef jerky.

178
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Beef jerky. There we go. Jerky's good. Yeah, like diner steak, like diner skirt steak, I feel like.

179
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Yeah, it's interesting though because the kobasa has like the skin, the outer skin is the tot thing.

180
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
It's almost like it has like a tot shell. Yeah.

181
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:21,000
It's like the whole item is not the same consistency. So like with a steak, obviously sometimes the outside is a little bit more cooked than the inside.

182
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:26,000
But it's hard. There has to be different classifications here is what I'm saying.

183
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Sure. I picked something that literally you can keep stretching with taffy, but still in my mind that is a hard candy to eat.

184
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,000
It is. I don't know. I guess like rock crystal candy.

185
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Which will factor into today's topic, by the way, a little spoiler. Yeah. Yeah.

186
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:58,000
They have interacted with with churros. I think maybe it's if you took taffy and pulled it over something else, like it would have the tautness of a casing.

187
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
So if you like, if you made a sausage out of taffy with the taffy lining.

188
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Yes. How come? How come that hasn't happened yet? It should.

189
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:13,000
What would go well with it? What would be good inside? What filling do you want in a taffy sausage?

190
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Hmm. Buttercream.

191
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:24,000
So like something soft, something something with give, you know, more than taffy, I think.

192
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I agree. I say I vote egg.

193
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Just just yolk.

194
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Yeah, just a yellow yolk and not like Cadbury style.

195
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
You're talking about just actual egg.

196
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
You take it out of the shell and put it into a different shell.

197
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
That is my vote.

198
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
This is this is so far.

199
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:56,000
This podcast is a it's something for jigsaw to listen to because it sounds torturous.

200
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Well, maybe what all this is served to do is make the idea of our topic that much sweeter.

201
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:13,000
We've had all of our worst mouth injuries that now I mean, all in any world, we'd be thrilled to think about churros.

202
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
But now how great does a churro sound to you after all that shit?

203
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Yeah, very good.

204
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,000
No, 100 percent. I'm I would kill for one right now.

205
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I want one very bad. It sucks.

206
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Yeah, I know. This is this.

207
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
You know, it's a good we're still doing this in quarantine times for the we'll say for the historical record.

208
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:39,000
And of all the things that you can't get in the parks and they're remarkably there's no like, you know, mobile.

209
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Service situation.

210
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I'm sure there are places that sell churros, perhaps even superior to Disneyland churros in and around the city and other cities.

211
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
But yeah, I'm missing them a lot from theme parks right now.

212
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
And Mitch, this was your call. This was this is something you wanted to talk about.

213
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Well, there was there as far as as far as things to.

214
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Yeah, I mean, I think it's a good thing.

215
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I think it's a good thing.

216
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I feel like there's never a time I don't do it, which is fucked up because I've gone like, you know, twice in a week or whatever.

217
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
So I shouldn't shouldn't be doing it.

218
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
So I shouldn't shouldn't be doing it.

219
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:22,000
But, uh, getting a churro is is is the is the is the big one to me.

220
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:33,000
And I can remember so specifically the first time I ever like even heard of churros, which was before we went to the park.

221
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I think it's the time we took up.

222
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:46,000
My family took a Winnebago down there with this with another family, my godparents family, and my godfather son Neil was just talking about churros and I didn't even know what they were.

223
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:54,000
And I put the I loved fried dough because I was a kid, you know, and then like, oh, it's kind of like fried dough, but it's got churros in it.

224
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
And it was kind of the most exciting thing I had ever heard of.

225
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:04,000
And then I can't really remember that for it because I can barely remember anything.

226
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I mean, like, I remember parts of Disney World in my head, but I was probably like eight, seven or eight years old when we went down there this time.

227
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
So I don't know if I remember specifically.

228
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I can't remember anything.

229
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I mean, I remember parts of Disney World in my head, but I was probably like eight, seven or eight years old when we went down there this time.

230
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
So I don't know if I remember specifically.

231
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I have like a vision of my head that we were near like the Country Bear Jamboree the first time I ever had one.

232
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
But I can't remember specifically.

233
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I kind of associate them with frontier lands in general.

234
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I feel like that's, you know, you can get them a bunch of places, but that that tends to be one in the parks.

235
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
My two spots.

236
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I have two spots in Disneyland, but but I want to hear everyone's I want to hear everyone's churro thoughts.

237
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Well, there are a lot more there's a lot more spots in Disneyland.

238
00:20:52,000 --> 00:21:04,000
There's certainly spots in Disney World, but Disneyland, they're they're like kind of everywhere and started in the Disney form started at Disneyland, not at Disney World.

239
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
All right. All right.

240
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Yeah. What's what are the perennial spots we feel like in the in the parks?

241
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Where do you do it, Mitch?

242
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:21,000
My two spots are so when I get into the park, I usually now this is going to probably fuck people up because they probably don't do the same route.

243
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
But I I go to Tomorrowland first.

244
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I go in and I take a right towards Tomorrowland and I usually get a fast pass for either Star Wars or Space Mountain.

245
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
And I just see what's available, obviously.

246
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:42,000
And then usually Space Mountain is like a thing that you have to wait the entire, you know, a few hours for or whatever, sometimes the whole day.

247
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Exactly my route, exactly what I do.

248
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Yeah. Do you really?

249
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Yeah, yeah. And it's kind of good to do it because Star Tours has like if you check the weight on that, that's sort of your litmus test for everything else in the park.

250
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Like if that's crazy, you go, oh, it's going to be bad.

251
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
And maybe there won't even be a Space Mountain option.

252
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Yeah. Yeah, I know. That's that's an it.

253
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Look, it's not that like it's not like this is like some sort of really thought out route.

254
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,000
It's basically going straight and taking your first right.

255
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Yeah, make sense to me. Right.

256
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:25,000
But when I'm there, I usually do I'll get on the Buzz Lightyear ride, especially if that's just like a walk on because I think that's fun.

257
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
The Buzz Lightyear shooter master.

258
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:33,000
What is the bug Buzz Lightyear blaster astro blasters astro blaster.

259
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
OK. And then I'll do that.

260
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I'll do that. I'll do that right.

261
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
And then I'll get off and I'll get a churro right.

262
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
It's basically against you guys will know exactly what I'm talking about.

263
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:54,000
But it's when you're walking towards Space Mountain and it's kind of like right there where the kind of split happens where you can go to the like to get food to the left or go towards Space Mountain to the right.

264
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
You know what I'm talking about? Oh, yeah.

265
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
It's like in front of Star Traders, the gift shop, the Star Tours gift shop.

266
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Yes. Yeah. Yeah.

267
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:08,000
And I'll go there. I'll get myself a churro and a Coca-Cola.

268
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
So it's maybe like in your first hour in the park.

269
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
It's it's an early part of the day for you.

270
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Yeah. Usually the thing is, is that like driving down there, I never want to I never really want to get food.

271
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
And if I do get food, I'll tell you what I do if I do get food.

272
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:29,000
But but driving down there, I like I'm like, oh, I want to just eat theme park food the entire day.

273
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:35,000
And so like a lot of times you go down there, you know, it's an hour ride or whatever hour plus.

274
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:41,000
And so a lot of times you'll grab something like a coffee and a bagel or whatever.

275
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:52,000
But if I if I if I don't eat anything at all and I'm just driving on this route, that will be like kind of my first snack of the day is a churro and a Coca-Cola.

276
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
The healthiest of all breakfasts.

277
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Yeah, that's a lot of sugar, Mitch.

278
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:04,000
It's a lot of sugar. I mean, hey, in my mind, Jason, it's a theme park day.

279
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
I'm doing I'm doing the parks. I'm right there with you.

280
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:14,000
No, trust me. I mean, I a lot of times if I'm going early in the morning, I I may have already had my share.

281
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,000
I may have gotten coffee and donuts or coffee and Danish on the way down before I left the city.

282
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,000
And then then are you still doing a churro or no?

283
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I don't I I get a churro every now and then, but they're not usually one of my go tos.

284
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Yeah, interesting.

285
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,000
I agree with Jason. Not one of my go tos either.

286
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
This makes so much sense because it is mine.

287
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,000
And I feel like we're often on separate sides of the tree scale.

288
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,000
And I get churros way more than than anything else.

289
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
What are you? What are you?

290
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
What are you guys? What are the what are the for Carlson and Jason?

291
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
What is a thing when you go to the park that you get almost every time you go?

292
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Jason, go ahead.

293
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:06,000
I usually I mean, I'm a big chocolate guy, so I'm usually one something from either one of the candy stores,

294
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:16,000
like one of the confectionaries or some sort of elevated ice cream, not just a scoop,

295
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:23,000
not just a scoop, either like a scoop with a chocolate cone or a sundae or a milkshake.

296
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Yeah, because you're like you're saying it's a theme park day.

297
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Some of the like little chocolate cake or treats back in Star Wars, back in Galaxy's Edge,

298
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,000
the little there's these little chocolate and passion fruit puff balls.

299
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Those are very good.

300
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I'll say what's the Ronto wraps have entered the permanent.

301
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
I get it every time for me. It's now on the list.

302
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Yeah, Ronto wrap is like the best thing.

303
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
And then the vegetarian option is really good.

304
00:25:53,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Like Ronto wrap is I that might be the thing I'm craving from the parks the most right now.

305
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Yeah, it's so good that that that for me, you guys know that I that I love pizza port.

306
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
I'm a fan of pizza port.

307
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,000
And yes, we were I was trying to remember if we talked about this on the show

308
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:18,000
or is this just a sidebar conversation with you because that's like that's a topic we really want to do with you.

309
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
But I feel like we all got to go down to do.

310
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
I don't want to do some bullshit Zoom version of the pizza port episode.

311
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Right. No, yeah, we got we got to go down and see in the pizza.

312
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:33,000
I genuinely like the pizza port and I like big theme parky slices of pizza.

313
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
And that is exactly what pizza port is.

314
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,000
It's a big fucking looks like a looks like it's from a movie.

315
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
It's I mean, it's perfect.

316
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
And look, it's not the best pizza in the world, but it's I think it's damn good.

317
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
And they got giant pepperoni slices on there.

318
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
It's a blast. I love pizza port.

319
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,000
But I like to wrap my head over that.

320
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,000
We all have thoughts very, very early in the podcast.

321
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Mike and I went down one day and ate at pizza port to try the hamburger pizza.

322
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:09,000
And I remember we sent pictures to Scott and he was so horrified.

323
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Kind of rightly so because it did look like a big pile of garbage.

324
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
I mean, that was a special event pizza.

325
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
So special limited time offering.

326
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Yeah, they got specially shitty.

327
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:30,000
I think my thought and I don't want to ruin the episode because we will do that as its own thing.

328
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:36,000
But I think I love what you're saying, Mitch, and you have me sold on the idea of it.

329
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
The idea sounds great, but I feel like the reality is lacking.

330
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:49,000
I think that pizza over the year, I feel like I've watched it get more expensive, smaller slices and shittier quality.

331
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Like just every year they shave off a little bit, a little bit until like a pretty well, that's a five dollar hunk of pizza.

332
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
That's all right. It's pretty good.

333
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Now it's I feel like nine dollars and the quality is a little questionable.

334
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
I always I always just feel like I can get two of those.

335
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:16,000
I can get two slices of pizza, poor pizza and which is I mean, you're right that they have gotten smaller, but they're pretty decently big.

336
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
And I'll be good for the rest of the I mean, I'll be I'll be fine.

337
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
And I'm sure I got a churro on that. That's a theme park day to me.

338
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
I'm very happy.

339
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:30,000
I'm very happy. So kind of serviceable, like quick salads at pizza port, too.

340
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
That's like, oh, I just need some vegetables.

341
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
I've been eating garbage.

342
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Those big pieces of garlic bread in the red bag.

343
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Delicious garlic. So garlic like it's garlic breadsticks, breadsticks.

344
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Yeah. See, people like pizza port. You like it.

345
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
It's good.

346
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:57,000
I know how this goes, where if I don't like it, then not only are the other hosts against me, but 85 percent of our audience.

347
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
So this is the beginning of the pizza part is good movement.

348
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,000
And I recognize that there's better pizza on property.

349
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
There we go. There's better pizza.

350
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,000
But sometimes you want like school cafeteria pizza.

351
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
And where where is this better pizza? Where is it?

352
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:22,000
The pizza, the Vietnam poli, the pizza in downtown Disney is like actually like very solid pizza.

353
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Mm hmm. See, not on the not on the lot.

354
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Get out of here. That's yeah.

355
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
You want it. You don't want to leave the park is what you're like.

356
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
If you're stuck in there, those gates, you know, I don't care.

357
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:39,000
I did. Look, I think you know what, Jason, I'm sorry to say this, but I think eating in downtown Disney is trash.

358
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
You say this having done our Earl of Sandwich episode.

359
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
You know what? That was bullshit, too.

360
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,000
I can't. My ears are flutter.

361
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
I can't handle this.

362
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
There is there's good there's good food and downtown.

363
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
But I don't know. I want to eat in the parks.

364
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I like eating in the parks.

365
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,000
And it's funny because I don't eat at a ton of places in the parks.

366
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
I don't eat at a ton of places in the parks.

367
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
I pizza port is one of like one of my main spots.

368
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:20,000
And then I have eaten right there near near the like at in Tomorrowland at the like that little state, those stands there, which I like.

369
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Basic burger place.

370
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Yeah, the basic burgers and stuff like that, which people also kind of don't love.

371
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:31,000
I don't know what's what part of this what part of the park is best for food.

372
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:43,000
But I will say if I don't get a churro in Tomorrowland near near that the gift shop for Star Tours, I'm getting it outside the Haunted Mansion.

373
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:48,000
I think you guys I think you guys know the card I'm talking about.

374
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Oh, yeah. That will be a little later in the day if I made my way over that way.

375
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Interesting. You know, it's weird.

376
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
I feel like I don't typically go to either of those.

377
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:03,000
I feel I think my primary spot is one of the ones in front of the castle.

378
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:12,000
And that's like a night like I feel like I get a nice iconic Disneyland moment because often you're rushing past the castle to get to other things.

379
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:20,000
And that's the thing that makes you stop in that nice, you know, square area, the hub and then be there for a minute.

380
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:27,000
And it's nice to be holding that big churro and looking up at the castle and kind of being in the heart of the place and doing a primary Disney show.

381
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Doing a primary Disneyland thing.

382
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:38,000
That's what that's what I call a panic churro spot, because for me, if I'm getting one from there, it's because I hadn't gotten a churro all day.

383
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,000
And then like my fat guy mentality kicks in and I'm like, I need a churro.

384
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:52,000
And it's like me desperately trying to get one on the way out of the park or like crossing through lands or something like that.

385
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,000
So I like this strategy and psychology is all interesting.

386
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:01,000
That's a yeah, that's a panic churro spot for me. I truly I think that I think churros are the things I've eaten the most at Disney.

387
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:07,000
I love them, especially if they're look, if it's a hot, fresh churro.

388
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Come on. It's unbeatable.

389
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
You know, that's a great point.

390
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:21,000
There there's a I feel like there's a big difference between like a hot, fresh churro and one that's been like hanging out for a little while.

391
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Yes. And that is that is a huge that is that's a huge issue.

392
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:32,000
I mean, like there you can if you get if you get a cold churro, still good, still good.

393
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Yeah, it's it's it's not it's not it's it's it's it's it's a bummer.

394
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:43,000
It bums me out. Sometimes, you know, if I get a cold churro, that means I got to go searching for a hot churro after that.

395
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
I got to get two in a day.

396
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
That's fair.

397
00:32:47,000 --> 00:33:01,000
I'll tell you what I I mean, the place I like the churros in is they've been doing like in terms of limited time stuff Sundays with like a churro cut in half and wedged into a Sunday.

398
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
And that's a place I like to see a churro.

399
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:25,000
You can kind of tell that like this the margins on this or the raw cost of the ingredients are like next to nothing because a churro Sunday with a churro wedged in it is not that much more money than a Sunday without a churro wedged in it.

400
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:35,000
But in my mind, it does elevate it. Similarly, like at some of the sit down restaurants, they'll do like bite sized churro bites with the dipping sauce.

401
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,000
And I love a dipping sauce. See, I agree with Jason.

402
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Oh, yeah. I was I'm just going to like I think sometimes when I get if I get a regular churro, sometimes it does feel like, well, it's not so fresh.

403
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
And it's it's a lot. There's a lot of it to eat.

404
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
And sometimes it feels like a little bit of a chore.

405
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
I usually like to split it in general.

406
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:08,000
But if there's a sort of specialty, if there's some specialty one, which when we were doing 80s at the 80s night at Disneyland, there was a Reese's peanut butter Reese's peanut butter like pieces churro.

407
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
And we're like, well, that sounds like interesting. Let's get it.

408
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
We got it. It was not good.

409
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
But we wanted to try it.

410
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:27,000
And then but on the other side of that is like a year or two prior, my friend was out here and there was a s'mores churro with a little like marshmallow dipping sauce.

411
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:37,000
And that was excellent. See, that's interesting because I was looking up all of the like different flavor churros, which Disney has gotten into in the last few years.

412
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:42,000
And I don't know. I think there's two issues.

413
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:51,000
One, like some of the flavors like I got to say cookies and cream, a solid ice cream, a wonderful in a blizzard or a milkshake.

414
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,000
But cookies and cream as a flavor. Not my favorite.

415
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Not not one of my go to when it's just like they just shove some crushed up cookies and some goo on there.

416
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:09,000
And then the other thing you run into with these kind of like variants of churros is you're creeping to six dollars or more.

417
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Like the value. Yeah. The perceived value is starting to disappear.

418
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Regular churros are at four seventy five at Disneyland already.

419
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,000
And Jason has an app to track this like a stock sap.

420
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:27,000
I looked I did look this up. I looked this up and I wrote this all down.

421
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,000
The dipping sauces will get you probably around like five fifty.

422
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:38,000
And yeah, I don't know. I just the perceived value in my mind sometimes.

423
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:47,000
I feel like I feel I feel like a churro shared is a really good option, although it goes pretty fast between two people.

424
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:51,000
I have I have I have a lot of thoughts on what you guys have all said.

425
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,000
I can probably just please I can just I can just sum it up by saying I'm angry.

426
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Oh, boy. Oh, what happened?

427
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Where did where where were you made angry?

428
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
No, no, not really angry.

429
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:09,000
But also we didn't stop down for my dumb joke enough, Carlson, that it's a churro when you have to eat a cold one.

430
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Oh, that's great. Yeah, that's really good.

431
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,000
The connection is a little my connection is kind of going a little in and out.

432
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:22,000
So I apologize. Yeah, I think the fuzziness of our connection made the enunciation tougher.

433
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
I missed it, too. I blame Zoom.

434
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Well, although I know it's good that now that I've brought it up multiple times and gotten churro out there, I think that people are just probably bent over slapping their knees right now.

435
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
They've paused the show probably.

436
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
They probably only show us pause.

437
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:49,000
During these trying times, Mike Mitchell has given us some relief, some solace, just some laughs.

438
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
The comedians are saving America's spirits.

439
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
All with churro.

440
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Who would have thought it would be that easy?

441
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:02,000
I don't like I don't like a couple things you guys said.

442
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
One, I don't like churros and ice cream.

443
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
I'm sorry, Jason.

444
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,000
OK, first of all, it's cool.

445
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,000
It's cooling down the churro to my you're getting a cold churro no matter what.

446
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
And I don't like flavor churros.

447
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
I don't like dipping sauces.

448
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
If I get a churro, I want straight up churro.

449
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,000
I want to I want pure churro.

450
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Pure churro.

451
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
I want pure churro.

452
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
I want pure churro.

453
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Pure churro.

454
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
That's what I say when I get to the front of the line.

455
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
I want pure churro.

456
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,000
You're going to give me a beer churro.

457
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,000
I genuinely just like the old classic version of it.

458
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:49,000
I now this being said, my godfather's son, who hyped up churros for me, he's he he owns

459
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,000
a restaurant in Quincy and he had a restaurant in in Braintree at one point.

460
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Oh, wait, no, Weymouth Landing.

461
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Shit.

462
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
It doesn't matter.

463
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
But he better get it right.

464
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
In Weymouth Landing.

465
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
That's where I was.

466
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,000
And he and he he was the only one who was in the restaurant.

467
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:11,000
And he had churros as it was like it was called Passport and he had a bunch of like different

468
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
foods from all over the world.

469
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
It was kind of what the idea of the restaurant was.

470
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
And it was a fantastic restaurant.

471
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:22,000
And there was a churro dessert and it had dipping sauces and there was like chocolate

472
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
and caramel and everything.

473
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
And I did enjoy those there.

474
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:30,000
But when I'm in when I'm in Disney, I don't need when it comes to dip and save it for

475
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,000
a pretzel with cheese because I don't need I don't need dipping for the day.

476
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Mitch, America, I believe, has agreed with you or Disneyland guests have because I read

477
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:47,000
somewhere that they did try to do dipping sauces as an add on option in the carts and

478
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
that they were they were pretty roundly rejected.

479
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:53,000
I think they weren't loved by the by crowds.

480
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
But also what does this thing say?

481
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,000
It said they're they're difficult, difficult to sell and hard to keep warm.

482
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
So it actually might be a little bit of a surprise to me.

483
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Difficult to sell and hard to keep warm.

484
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,000
So it actually might have been more logistics than the audience rejecting them.

485
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
But they did not take off at Disneyland.

486
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Yeah, that makes sense.

487
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:17,000
I mean, like I and I and I love the Mickey pretzel with that is actually probably my

488
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:25,000
second snack as far as as Disney snacks go as a Mickey pretzel with the cheese.

489
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Yeah.

490
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Yeah, I do like that.

491
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
I don't get that often, but I do like that.

492
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,000
I like the cream cheese one, the stuffed one.

493
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Oh, wow.

494
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Yeah, that one's real good.

495
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
What is it stuffed with?

496
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Like sweet cream cheese.

497
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Really?

498
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
I think there might be a peppery.

499
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
There might be a pepper Jack stuffed one, too.

500
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Can you get the then you get the dipping cheese as well and dip it?

501
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
No, you don't get the dipping cheese.

502
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
I think it's like one or the other.

503
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Oh, you probably could get it.

504
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
You probably order it separate.

505
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Sure.

506
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Yeah.

507
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
That's an add on though.

508
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Right. Yeah.

509
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
It doesn't add on.

510
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Yeah.

511
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Oh, you're paying for it.

512
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Yeah.

513
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
You're going to you're going to pay.

514
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
You get whatever you want.

515
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
You're going to pay.

516
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Mitch, I'm going to make you more angry.

517
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,000
How do you do you know about the Caliente churro?

518
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,000
No, but please do tell me is there cheese in it?

519
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:26,000
No, it's kind of it's like rolled in red red hots, red hots or spicy cheese.

520
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Spicy Cheetos that I have tried that one as well.

521
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
It's insane.

522
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:40,000
It's one of the craziest things man has ever attempted.

523
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,000
And man's hubris in creation.

524
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,000
It does. It's like it's the sweetest, sugariest, craziest thing.

525
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,000
There's no way you can eat even like a quarter of it.

526
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
I feel like.

527
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Oh, have you tried it?

528
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
I haven't.

529
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
No, I haven't tried it.

530
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
No.

531
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Honestly, that's just it sounds like an abomination.

532
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:10,000
I would never I mean, like even when it is like I've been tempted by like, oh, the strawberry churro.

533
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:15,000
But I just I know that I just love the classic churro.

534
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
There's nothing better.

535
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,000
I don't know about add-ons in general.

536
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,000
It seems like if I had to get Mitch's hard, no, I don't know if I'm hard.

537
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,000
No, but I haven't had a great example to change my mind.

538
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Mike, are you sort of like amenable to it?

539
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,000
But you're also you haven't had a lot of success.

540
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Well, as I said, I seem to I from earlier when we were talking about treats, I am generally I try to do one treat.

541
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,000
If it's a big day at Disney, one treat a day.

542
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,000
And usually I save that till the end of the day.

543
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:56,000
And usually and I mentioned this before, it's usually my two scoop cone with the sugars on the outside with the sprinkles.

544
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
That's usually what I get.

545
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
And I rarely do.

546
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,000
I probably literally at Disney have a churro a year.

547
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Probably like probably that we're pretty opposite.

548
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
This is crazy.

549
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:15,000
So I just it doesn't it's not in my top three, I think.

550
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:22,000
So I'm I'm I totally recognize that if it's warm and it's good, the regular churro is delicious.

551
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,000
And I've had a lot of now I've tried these other versions and most of them fail.

552
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:35,000
I do do think that's smores when they had that I think was limited time is I think maybe I even liked it better than a regular one and it had a dipping sauce.

553
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:47,000
So I'm not I like the experimentation with this, but I think probably in general they haven't really figured out a formula to like completely put new flavors in these things.

554
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Like most of these things fail.

555
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,000
These different versions.

556
00:42:52,000 --> 00:43:02,000
It's hard. I think it's hard to like, you know, it's like it's it's science here and it's you know, you work very hard trying to come up with a new equation, like a new formula.

557
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
And it just doesn't work.

558
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Most of the time it doesn't work adapting the churro into a new form.

559
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:16,000
I feel like like I feel like it's like it's just as an American thing to get like a new mainstream snack that would fit in at a theme park.

560
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:29,000
I feel like I just remember being around when or, you know, being a kid when when Buffalo Chicken became more popular and you saw more places and yeah.

561
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:42,000
I felt even that when that was happening, it felt like is this going to work like Buffalo Chicken like and I mean, of course I loved it, but it felt it felt to have like a mainstay sort of snack or dessert at a theme park.

562
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:54,000
I mean, I'm trying to think of like for me in my eyes with Disney. What are the rundowns of snacks? You got pretzels. You got churros. You got ice cream. You got pickles.

563
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:59,000
What are some what what are some newer like within the last 10 years besides Ronto wraps or something?

564
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:10,000
They've got like a lot of different cookies. They have those big like they have a lot of things in the confectionary like they'll have like a big piece of chocolate with peanut butter inside.

565
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:21,000
They have fudge. They'll have these like I like these things called tiger tails that are like marshmallow with like sugar on the outside that looks like it's the Cheshire cat's tail.

566
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:35,000
That's pretty good or Tigger's tail at Disneyland. A lot of the carts, the outdoor carts have the chimichangas or the the corn.

567
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:40,000
The yeah, not quite a low take corn, but kind of similar.

568
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:51,000
That's a macaroon presence. There's a Matterhorn macaroon. Although I have found that out from an article. I didn't really know this macaroon before, so I don't know if that's a primary.

569
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Oh, delicious. Yeah, it's a coconut mac macaroon that looks like a little mountain with icing on top.

570
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:02,000
But then the French macaroons have they've been making those more in the parks.

571
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Don't you think that churros are like a what's a good way to describe it? A load bearing snack? That's not good.

572
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Yeah, I like that. Yes, a pillar foundational. A foundation snack.

573
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:25,000
I like a found like ones that you can find all around everywhere, not specific to like certain parts of the park, but are could kind of float around.

574
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:35,000
That's a good point. Yes, because some some of these things feel like they need to be in certain areas, but there's like there's nowhere where a churro is out of place.

575
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Yes. And also, I got to say this. We haven't talked about it yet.

576
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Ease of the ease of snacking with a churro. You get the little piece of paper.

577
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:52,000
You got a big stick. You just you just taking a big bite out of that thing. You know, you don't have to get any of the cinnamon sugar on there.

578
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,000
And on yourself by on there is what I mean.

579
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Not yet. That's great. Your body. There's no there's there's no dipping involved.

580
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:06,000
You just you just eating the thing straight up. I think it's I think it's just an easy snack for me to eat.

581
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Yeah. Well, much like the the revelation in the now classic film, The Founder with Michael Keaton about the founding of McDonald's, the revelation that the burger does not have extra plates or containers.

582
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:26,000
It comes in its own wrapper. I think it's a similar simplicity to the churro.

583
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Yes. Yeah. Yeah. The ice cream when you're eating an ice cream, especially with two scoops, it's a race against the clock.

584
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Yep. It's it's good, but it is it can be a bit stressful if maybe you're not feeling like you want to like furiously lick.

585
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Oh, yeah. Especially if you're in Florida. Man, watch out. Yeah, that thing.

586
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:53,000
It's toast, but it's sure. Oh, you can stroll and you can split to major functions.

587
00:46:53,000 --> 00:47:00,000
And can I also just say this? It's not too hot that it's an issue on a really hot day.

588
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:08,000
It's not an overly hot product where, like, you're like, oh, man, I don't really want to, like, have a bowl of soup while I'm walking around.

589
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:13,000
It's not soup in a bread bowl. That's right. It's not super bread bowl.

590
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Look, am I now trying to convince you that churros are the best snack in the Disneyland parks by the end of this?

591
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Yes. And I think that we're getting there. I think I'm getting closer.

592
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:27,000
I feel like it's an argument. It's not an argument towards people who don't like churros.

593
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:36,000
It's about like moving it from number four to maybe number two. Yes. Yeah, I guess I am not arguing against it.

594
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:53,000
I just think I being at the park, here's here's I think that perhaps the bare bones presentation of the churro is part of maybe why it's not in my top three or five or something like an ice cream has a lot of colors.

595
00:47:53,000 --> 00:48:01,000
It sprinkles have a lot of colors. If I'm getting a cookie or something, it's got I like a cookie with a lot of different frosting on it.

596
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:07,000
I do think perhaps when I'm in the park, I am looking for something that feels a little more fantastical.

597
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:20,000
So the churro itself is pretty standard. It's a brown and a sugar, but it doesn't sort of evoke even the I know it's such a theme park food, but it doesn't give me like the feeling like I'm in some sort of magical candy land.

598
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,000
It's a big long stick that you chew on.

599
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:32,000
It doesn't have a face on it. It doesn't have sprinkles. It doesn't have many colors. It's good.

600
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:44,000
I'm just saying if it was like a magic, like maybe it was like Merlin's wand. Oh my God churro and it had a little color or something.

601
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Then I'm like waving it around and pretending I'm a I'm a wizard. And then I'm feeling like I'm really part of this whole magical Disney Day.

602
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Or like in Japan, it's shaped like a Mickey, you know, it's shaped like Mickey's and it's classic.

603
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:04,000
If you look at it, if you look down the barrel, it looks like a which I don't think I realized till our treats episode recently. Yes. Yeah.

604
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,000
In Tokyo, specifically in Tokyo specifically. Yeah. Yeah.

605
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:20,000
That's the other thing. Like I Mitch, I'd be inclined to agree with you, but I feel like the the churro would get knocked out by the classic Mickey ice cream bar in my at least in my concern.

606
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:31,000
The Mickey ice cream bar is great. Yeah. And also I just I just want to quickly ask, did Carlson mean Merlin from the sword in the stone?

607
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:38,000
You wanted to be like his wand? Yeah, I look I'm just spitballing here. I doesn't have to be Merlin from sword in the stone's wand.

608
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:43,000
But I'm just saying he is he's one of the first one. You know, it could be a fairy godmother's wand.

609
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Well, hold on. My question to you guys is Jason, your favorite snack of the park is what was it? A bowl of sweet cream or something?

610
00:49:53,000 --> 00:50:05,000
A taxi sausage. I would probably go like a sundae like like an ice cream sundae. Some sort of a soft drink cup filled with sweet cream.

611
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:09,000
If I remember if I remember correctly, your skittles.

612
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:16,000
I like a I like a Disney like shopping bag full of skittles.

613
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Mike brings a thermos of ice and he's like, can you just a shopping bag of skittles so I can combine it with my icy thermos?

614
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Yeah, I dip each skittle in a different flavor, a different color part of the icy.

615
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:38,000
I just feel like look, the interesting snacks that's over in California Adventure.

616
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:46,000
If I'm going to get a bread bowl with mac and cheese in it or a cone rather a bread cone with mac and cheese, I'm going over to California Adventure.

617
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,000
And that there's a reason that that's not available everywhere.

618
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Right. Like, I love that. I love the mac and cheese cone.

619
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Yes, I do, too.

620
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:00,000
I mean, like, but Churro is just a classic. It's so great.

621
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,000
And I might I might bring this up, Mike.

622
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:07,000
I agree with you that there might be if there was some way to put a stamp on the Disney.

623
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:11,000
I like that in Japan, if you look down the barrel, it's a Mickey shape.

624
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:18,000
I think that's cool. But it's not like it's still it's a subtle detail, so subtle that I missed it entirely.

625
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:23,000
And so it would be nice if there was something to, you know, if it had Mickey ears on the end or something.

626
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:30,000
But the whole thing, if it was a color and if it was flavored, as we've established, I think the flavors are no good.

627
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:35,000
So I think just for taste, it has to stay just just basic and cinnamon.

628
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:41,000
And as it comes, you could do a food, you could do a food coloring, though, that wouldn't affect the taste.

629
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:45,000
I suppose. But I you know, it feels that feels weird to me.

630
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:51,000
I'll go back to my as much as it was one of the best moments of my life to have a blue wine on the table.

631
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:56,000
I was drinking it and going, but why this is just added food coloring.

632
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,000
I kind of, you know, as much as it looks cool, I do.

633
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:02,000
I know it's just white wine with some blue blue in it.

634
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
What is the purpose of this blue?

635
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,000
I want I want some flavor out of my fake color.

636
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Right. So I have just I just Google this because I thought I remembered it and I was right.

637
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
I am texting everyone.

638
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:17,000
There was I think it might be limited time.

639
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:21,000
But they were selling lightsaber churros.

640
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Yeah, I remember. Yeah, that's good.

641
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:28,000
So I've so I think I think they were just for an event and I've sent you a picture of them.

642
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
So that is closer to what I'm talking about.

643
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,000
I do think like it's a neon red and neon blue.

644
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:37,000
I don't even necessarily need to be that different in color.

645
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:42,000
But I do think that's just just just just just the food coloring that those still taste the same.

646
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:46,000
Basically, those those I have to I have to check.

647
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,000
I don't know that to be the case.

648
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:55,000
Do you guys recall when there was a little trend of rose gold items in the park?

649
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Yeah, I sure do. Pink and gold.

650
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:01,000
And I did you I think I might have been with you, Mike, when you had a rose gold churro.

651
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Am I misremembering this?

652
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
It's possible.

653
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
But did I split it with Lindsay?

654
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
I don't know.

655
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:12,000
She's usually the one that likes the churro, I think a little bit more than me.

656
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:17,000
So generally, if we had it, it was like maybe she wanted it and then we split it.

657
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
I don't remember.

658
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:22,000
I don't have the memory of having the rose gold.

659
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
I might be able to.

660
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:30,000
That churro was for millennials, so it probably tastes like freaking avocado toast.

661
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Or ass or ass.

662
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Carlson, I just want to say to you that I and I mean, and Jason, both of you, you're both volunteers.

663
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,000
I can't believe you're not I can't believe you're not really churro guys.

664
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:48,000
I mean, it truly it flips my entire worldview about you guys.

665
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:52,000
I I I I'm shook to my core.

666
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:56,000
I thought you I thought you I just clearly just assumed you were both churro guys.

667
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Well, I'm sorry to let you down.

668
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:04,000
I hear I like I I don't want to seem like I don't like them either.

669
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,000
It's like I also like and these are I think these are in the same family.

670
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:11,000
I am a big fan of those cinnamon twists at Taco Bell.

671
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
I love those.

672
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
So you like so you so hold on.

673
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
So you like the worst churro?

674
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Well, I'm saying that I like it.

675
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:24,000
The family and they don't have a lot of other options as far as dessert at Taco Bell.

676
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
I mean, they do have a lot of other options.

677
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,000
But I like a little of that.

678
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:31,000
So I'm just saying I'm just defending myself that I like I'm in the family here.

679
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:38,000
I just there's stuff makes me feel more part of the special special world than a churro.

680
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:42,000
I also have a sense of cinnamon.

681
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:46,000
I find kind of irritating to the gums in large quantities.

682
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
I love cinnamon toast crunch.

683
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Cinnamon is a bad mouth memory.

684
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
What are you talking about?

685
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Cinnamon is a bad mouth memory.

686
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
What are you talking about?

687
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
But like it irritates.

688
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
It can irritate.

689
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Cinnamon irritates you?

690
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Yes, you have a little cut or something or like cinnamon toast crunch.

691
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:18,000
If you don't let it like soak in milk and like the specific you're eating cinnamon when you have a cut or eating kielbasa when you just had dental surgery or having a banana at 10 a.m.

692
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:21,000
I read you know you can overdo it on cinnamon.

693
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:25,000
There's a reason dentists tell you like don't buy cinnamon toothpaste.

694
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
It's it's it's not great.

695
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
It's caustic.

696
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Wait, is that a real thing?

697
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
I have had dentists say like, yeah, don't get cinnamon.

698
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Why would you have cinnamon?

699
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
For sure don't have cinnamon toothpaste.

700
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
It was a trend for a while.

701
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
I know what you mean.

702
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,000
It's like medicine.

703
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,000
That's cinnamon.

704
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Can I quickly can I quickly ask have you moved on to bubblegum bubblegum toothpaste?

705
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Well, I'm on the birthday cake toothpaste.

706
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Cinnamon tree is a classic.

707
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:00,000
I think I feel like cinnamon toast.

708
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Obviously, when you're when you're just cinnamon toast with butter and cinnamon on top of it.

709
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Yeah, great tree.

710
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:12,000
I don't know if I like stuff that's cold as much that cinnamon like I don't love cinnamon cereals.

711
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
I think I enjoy cinnamon toast crunch, but it wasn't my favorite.

712
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,000
I like frosted flakes.

713
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:21,000
I like a like a more sugar like I mean, they're all sugar based but kind of like, oh, it's corn flakes and sugar.

714
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,000
I'm fine with that.

715
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Cinnamon cinnamon toast crunch.

716
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Not my favorite.

717
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,000
I still like it.

718
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:30,000
But I tried cinnamon coke and cinnamon Coca Cola is is bad.

719
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,000
It was it was not good at all.

720
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Like I I I I I I think I enjoy cinnamon stuff when it's warm or hot warm to hot.

721
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
Mitch, what do you think about horchata?

722
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:46,000
The cold rice drink usually have very cinnamon forward flavor there.

723
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Do you know what?

724
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
That is probably you got me.

725
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:53,000
That's probably the one cold cinnamon thing that I really like that I do.

726
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
I like a lot.

727
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:58,000
I don't even know if I love it, but I do really like it.

728
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Yeah, I had cinnamon toast crunch yesterday.

729
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,000
I like cinnamon.

730
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,000
I like cinnamon.

731
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,000
I'm this is you like like cinnamon.

732
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
You like cinnamon toast crunch.

733
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:14,000
You like Taco Bell things and not.

734
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:18,000
And I like cutting my mouth and pouring cinnamon into the wound.

735
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:22,000
I think it feels good.

736
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Cinnamon toast crunch is in the top five cereals.

737
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:28,000
But like I can't I can't overdo it.

738
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:36,000
I can't overdo it in the way that golden grams do not irritate in the way that cinnamon toast crunch do another all timer.

739
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:41,000
The double scoop ice cream with a cone with sprinkles.

740
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,000
There's so much going on.

741
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,000
I can get a I can get a sherbet scoop.

742
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
I can get a cookie dough scoop.

743
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:51,000
I can then enjoy eating the sprinkles off the side of the cone.

744
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:58,000
There's so many different things there that stimulate my mind as well as my palate that I enjoy.

745
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Like it's just such a ultimate theme park experience.

746
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
It feels so indulgent as a kid.

747
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:12,000
I used to like looking at a cartoon strip with like 10 different ice cream scoops on a cone and I'm not I'm not doing that obviously but I'm getting the closest.

748
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Yeah.

749
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:16,000
What cartoons what cartoon strips are you reading.

750
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:21,000
What it was probably did Dagwood ever have a big ice cream cone in addition to a big sandwich.

751
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
You know he did.

752
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,000
You know he did.

753
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,000
Joghead.

754
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Joghead was definitely.

755
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:30,000
I had a bunch of shakes bunch of scoops.

756
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,000
He had so many others.

757
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:36,000
I'm for sure if you look up Joghead lots of scoops there has to be a picture of him.

758
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:39,000
I will Google it right now.

759
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,000
So I always like that.

760
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
So that's it's just nothing is going to beat that for me.

761
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:49,000
It has to be visually busier for you like a baby's mobile.

762
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
I am a lot like a baby.

763
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:54,000
That's called eye memory Scott.

764
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
It's a cousin of mouth.

765
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
I'm a little bit of a

766
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
entertain me snack.

767
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,000
I'm sure.

768
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Oh OK.

769
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,000
Cinnamon brown.

770
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:06,000
I have bored done straight line garbage.

771
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Put on a show for me snack.

772
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,000
I know.

773
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:14,000
So on top of that I can't believe that you guys chose the Taco Bell cinnamon twists which

774
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:21,000
are like they're they're like the empty shell of sure they're like if I hate this analogy

775
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:26,000
I would be like I would just snapped churros right before they were about to break apart.

776
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,000
They would be cinnamon twists from Taco Bell.

777
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
Cinnamon twists shells.

778
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:34,000
They pay you to cart them away.

779
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:37,000
They're like please please we cannot get rid of.

780
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:40,000
We've had the same stock since 1989.

781
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,000
And they're still good.

782
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,000
They still taste good.

783
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
I've sent you all a photo of Joghead.

784
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:49,000
He's got one two three four five six scoops on an ice cream cone.

785
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,000
This is this is a guy.

786
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,000
This is one of my childhood heroes.

787
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
Can you will you do Joghead's line.

788
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:59,000
I'm going to do the other line and just let's just enact this little scene of the cover you sent us.

789
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Sure.

790
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,000
It's very it's very 70s is what we're looking at.

791
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
It says teen disco tech light show.

792
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Man I dig having a lot of wild colors in my fingertips.

793
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,000
All right.

794
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,000
And I have my tongue sticking out.

795
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:18,000
It's like I'm like licking my lips and I'm holding that ice cream cone and I say so do I.

796
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Great scene.

797
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
That was that was better than Riverdale.

798
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Great.

799
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,000
But hold on a second.

800
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,000
Hold on.

801
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,000
I.

802
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,000
What.

803
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,000
What.

804
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,000
Hold on one moment here.

805
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Yeah.

806
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Joghead likes the ice cream.

807
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:40,000
First of all Carlson you kind of look like Joghead.

808
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,000
He's a tall man.

809
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Yeah.

810
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:47,000
And he and he and he's attracted to the color of the ice cream.

811
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:52,000
You may be a lot like Joghead and I see a lot of similarities is what I'm saying.

812
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
Mike Mike looks like Joghead.

813
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
I behave like Joghead.

814
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,000
We're a dyad.

815
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:00,000
We're a dyad in the.

816
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,000
In the river force.

817
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:06,000
You're you're are you Kylo and I'm Ray.

818
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,000
I guess that's how I do it.

819
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:13,000
By the way by Jason you really should not bring up new Star Wars when Mitch is that is a dangerous.

820
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:16,000
That is really dangerous.

821
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:19,000
We don't want to get off on a bad thing here.

822
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Well we don't want to get go down this route but Mike you you set up a transition perfectly with this Joghead cover of the teen disc teen disco tech light show goes right to the origin of Disneyland churros.

823
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Oh right right.

824
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:39,000
I'm assuming we all saw this apocryphal perfect perfect story.

825
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:44,000
This is what yes Mitch get ready to hear the tale of how the churro came to Disneyland.

826
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,000
Oh wow.

827
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,000
It's a lovely story.

828
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Jason go ahead.

829
01:01:47,000 --> 01:02:04,000
Well OK so there was a man named Jim Loman and he was in charge of the food and beverage services at Disney's Fantasyland and they were about to open a teen nightclub that one week we talked about a lot on the show called Videopolis.

830
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,000
Yeah.

831
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
And it's it's so fun.

832
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
It's very 80s.

833
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:24,000
It's it's a lot of cast off L.A. Olympics televisions rigged up to show the triangle's purple and teal triangles all the big like fonts and stars of the day.

834
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:43,000
And he needed some sort of like snack to sell back there to teens and he attended a race at the Long Beach Grand Prix and saw a churro booth and that it was very popular and you only needed a very small warming oven for it.

835
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:58,000
And he found the company who made it reached out said Disneyland was interested but they knew the churros they were selling were only six inches so they knew they need a little a little more Disney oomph to it a little more Disney magic.

836
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:05,000
So they asked them to make it 12 inches and pretty much an immediate hit.

837
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:22,000
The story goes that like as they were rolling out the cart they were going to test it out in frontier land first and just the smell of cinnamon sugar like cause like 30 people to follow that cart and then they just kept adding churro carts like the Pied Piper.

838
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:26,000
Yeah.

839
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:34,000
They could they could have driven those people right into the river right into the rivers of America.

840
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:37,000
Jason when was this what year was this.

841
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:40,000
This would have been 85 around 1980.

842
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:45,000
The churro was born at Disneyland in the summer of 85 right when I was born.

843
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:53,000
And shortly before me and the who's the other big oh as we I alluded to at the top of the show.

844
01:03:53,000 --> 01:04:08,000
So one of the big changes over the years of how they did this eventually as they added more and more churro carts they roped it into like the outdoor food and beverage vending along with like the popcorn and the ice cream carts and that sort of thing.

845
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:16,000
But the original churro carts were loaded up with six propane tanks each and they would run out and they'd have to reload it.

846
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:21,000
And the other thing is propane is explosive.

847
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,000
That's insane.

848
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,000
Yeah.

849
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:35,000
So this operated by teens mostly teens wheeling around a bunch of propane in a theme park propane wielding teens.

850
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:39,000
And now you're opening your opening makes even more sense.

851
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
Jason I thought you were just being funny.

852
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:42,000
Yeah.

853
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
It was not just a non sequitur.

854
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:50,000
It was a very very specific reference to the story.

855
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:57,000
Jim Lohman also kind of got my ass in terms of some of my complaints about churros getting more expensive.

856
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:08,000
He he is quoted as saying you know people wondering like well food's a little pricey at Disneyland and the price of churros it's just cinnamon sugar and dough.

857
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:11,000
It's like a kind of a doughnut basically.

858
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:21,000
And he says it's either low food prices and pay to watch shows and watch entertainment or higher food prices so that all that stuff can be wrapped up into one.

859
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:28,000
So I mean it's fair enough kind of kind of fair enough.

860
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:34,000
But they they also he includes in that fireworks live entertainment and clean restrooms.

861
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:38,000
I'm hoping you would have clean restrooms regardless.

862
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
I'm sure of money.

863
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:43,000
You make them cheaper and now there's shit on the ground.

864
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:49,000
Jim Lohman also responsible for the barbecue skewers skewers at Bengal Barbecue.

865
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:54,000
And what VIP is this guy a Disney legend.

866
01:05:54,000 --> 01:06:03,000
He was that he I don't know if he's still at the company but it was something like multiple decades like he worked worked for them was still working for them in the 2010s.

867
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:15,000
And he met his wife a long time ago at the at the Tahitian Terrace and then she like helped them figure like in their kitchen they figured out the Bengal Barbecue menu together.

868
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:20,000
So the whole family there's maybe there maybe there are PTR legends.

869
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,000
Yeah I think they are.

870
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:24,000
I mean we all have the official ceremony sometime this summer.

871
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:27,000
I assume we'll be at the Anaheim Hotel.

872
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:32,000
So yeah and be a distance with markers and you know it'll be it'll be perfectly safe.

873
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
Yeah very safe. Yeah.

874
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:37,000
See I can't. How are you even asking if he's a legend.

875
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:45,000
This is your Carlson you're a man with pure pure pure pure pure hatred in your heart.

876
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
I can't believe your heart.

877
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
I hate your heart.

878
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
I don't hurt her.

879
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
I hate in my heart.

880
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
That's not true.

881
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:56,000
It is true.

882
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
Stronger ice cream love.

883
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Love the love for the ice cream is stronger in my heart.

884
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
That's all ice cream.

885
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
Come on ice cream is little baby.

886
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
I look I love ice cream.

887
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:16,000
But you say babies look sometimes for babies and I love it and I'm a big baby and I like to get I like to eat ice cream.

888
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,000
I think you're trashing ice.

889
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:22,000
So this is gonna be more controversial than your force awakens opinion.

890
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:26,000
Well Mike I know you love all three of those films very much.

891
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:29,000
Of course. Would you like to elaborate.

892
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:35,000
I said that I said that I loved Rondo wraps.

893
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
That is the truth.

894
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:42,000
I love that's the first thing you've liked in the Star Wars universe and decades.

895
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:55,000
Rondo wraps are look I thought BB8 was like an impressive toy and it was only until I found out that they turned him into like a police robot recently that I kind of.

896
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:58,000
I've been like everything I kind of caught this.

897
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
That was the idea of the technology.

898
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:06,000
The company yeah the company that made the BB8 is also now making like drones.

899
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:10,000
So now there will be like BB8 drones on the streets.

900
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:13,000
It's a if you see one don't go near it.

901
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
Yeah.

902
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
We live in a dystopia in many ways but yeah.

903
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:22,000
We already have to push the postmates bots into the river.

904
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:26,000
It's not going to be any river left soon.

905
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
Well these robots in it.

906
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:35,000
I have not I have not I have not written the I've not been able to ride the new Star Wars.

907
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,000
Rise of the Resistance.

908
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:39,000
Yeah I haven't I have not I have not been on that ride yet.

909
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:46,000
So my judgment of Galaxy's Edge I just still kind of wish that Galaxy's Edge was.

910
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:57,000
I like I said I wish there was a Cloud City restaurant and I wish that there was like Hoth and different parts of the like I wish they went so all out on Star Wars land.

911
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:58,000
Why wouldn't you.

912
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:02,000
You're Disney you own you have more money than anyone else on earth.

913
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
Why not go crazy with it.

914
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:08,000
I had more money than anyone else.

915
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:13,000
About two months ago it's mostly tied up in like Saudi Arabia at this point.

916
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
They got some fridge loans.

917
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
They bought a lot of the debt.

918
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:42,000
Mitch I'll have to dig this up and send it to you but there there there was an interview with a former like executive from the Florida parks and he talked about how Disney MGM studios there was a plan to kind of make like half half like I think it was often half Tatooine sort of leading back ending it around Star Tours or no I think was Tatooine and Endor.

919
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:47,000
And then that all kind of got scrapped once once Disney eventually bought Lucasfilm outright.

920
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
And so cool.

921
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:50,000
God damn it.

922
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:54,000
Mitch I sent you that video that when they were going to do Lucas port.

923
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:55,000
Yes.

924
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:58,000
That to me is that video is heartbreaking.

925
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
It's heartbreaking video.

926
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
Wait explain it for the audience.

927
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:08,000
So there was a new information to me that like Lucas was going to sort of oversee Tomorrowland in a way.

928
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
And it was going to be called Lucasport.

929
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:15,000
I mean I know he was he obviously with Captain EO and Star Tours was getting a more of an elevated profile.

930
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:25,000
But then there was a Star Wars roller coaster that I really wasn't aware of and it had photos from it like stuff that would have been on it and it was like you could choose your own path on the roller coaster.

931
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:32,000
And basically you were going through you know Dagobah you're going through the like the core of the Death Star.

932
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:40,000
It looked like sort of your ultimate like original trilogy dream for a Star Wars ride.

933
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:44,000
Like what it did seem like exactly what Mitch would be the intent of the end.

934
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:47,000
And I'm sorry you know I thought you're talking to Scott about his dream for Star Wars right.

935
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:48,000
Yes.

936
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,000
No no no no.

937
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:57,000
Well it was for me too because architecturally oh my God that was the most like Epcot 80s Disney future building.

938
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
I am upset that there is no Lucas board for sure.

939
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:00,000
Yeah.

940
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:07,000
Yeah no no that that that that is that 100 percent is that is what I I wanted more than anything.

941
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:13,000
And I still want and I hope that they I mean like whatever.

942
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:22,000
There's a lot of there's a lot of there's a lot of stuff that is that is for real impressive about Galaxy's Edge and it is it is cool.

943
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:29,000
I just I just thought it was going to be more and maybe that it will be more with that with the hotel and everything and that will change things.

944
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:42,000
But I think you'll rise of the resistance is very impressive Mitch and I'm sure you'll be down there soon as Disneyland opens back up because you've been a big proponent that coronavirus is a hoax and you're not going to get sick.

945
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:46,000
It's not.

946
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:48,000
Open back up.

947
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
That's what I said.

948
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:55,000
Day one I've been saying open back up.

949
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:58,000
The virus can't be worse than the cure.

950
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,000
Yeah.

951
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:00,000
Yeah.

952
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,000
Yeah.

953
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
The cure can't be worse than the disease.

954
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:08,000
Mitch said that and then trumped by I think saw his tweet and then started saying it.

955
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:09,000
Yeah.

956
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:14,000
I want to push I want to I'm going to I'm just going to tell people that.

957
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:20,000
Every time I'm down at the park I have a churro and I haven't and I haven't gotten COVID-19 yet.

958
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
Churro is a remedy.

959
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:29,000
I'm just saying there might there's something there there might be something there.

960
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:32,000
There's a curative name there's something curative about it.

961
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:35,000
Like hydroxy chloropin whatever that's called.

962
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:36,000
Yeah it did.

963
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:41,000
Do you know it doesn't made you get COVID-19 so very well maybe the cure.

964
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:44,000
I just that's that's all I'm saying.

965
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
So I'm sorry you go ahead.

966
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
No no no you go.

967
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:55,000
I was going to say like if there was a churro place nearby how like to your apartment how often would you get one do you think.

968
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:58,000
That's a good question because there was.

969
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:02,000
Oh I know exactly what you're talking about and I didn't like that place.

970
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:14,000
I didn't like that place either and it was like such a it was like such like a in the L.A. way of like oh there here is this like it was called churro burro.

971
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:17,000
And I don't want to say I didn't like a place that has now gone out of business.

972
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:29,000
I feel bad but they basically made churro ice cream sandwiches and that's all they did and they took over that they took over a place called I think it was called Ramekin.

973
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:46,000
Which was just a dessert place and I thought was like fantastic and no one ever went there but it was like they just would they they they serve like different desserts there and like we'll give you like like a like a bread pudding or something like like hot desserts too.

974
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:56,000
It was great and no one really ever went there and then churro burro opened up and it was strictly just like these churro ice cream sandwiches and I was like oh there's not enough variety for me.

975
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:05,000
And also like I said I don't like mixing the cold with the with the churro and I didn't and I didn't think the place was was that great and it's gone out of business and that sucks.

976
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:16,000
So every every now and then there is a street cart around in Los Angeles little street carts that have churros and they're really good.

977
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:19,000
Yes. Yeah they were.

978
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:24,000
Yeah they were yeah they were there I mean like BS Tacaria had great churros.

979
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:33,000
Yeah. And they have now since closed but I think they're reopening at some point there's there's places where you can get some great local great churros here.

980
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
But but I place.

981
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:36,000
Yeah.

982
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:40,000
There's one other Disney churro question I had for everyone.

983
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:45,000
Has anyone venture Mitch you've already made your feelings about downtown Disney clear.

984
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:54,000
Has anyone tried the California churro company carts in downtown Disney.

985
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:55,000
No.

986
01:14:55,000 --> 01:15:09,000
It is like it is there's a lot of carts in downtown Disney which we barely mentioned in the downtown Disney ordeal because they're so impulse by but there there is like a different kind of churro in downtown Disney and

987
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:18,000
to me it's just not canon like they've got so many flavors of churro and I'm like there's no way this is going to be.

988
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:22,000
I'm like I'm liking what you're saying here I like this this is you're right.

989
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:34,000
It just doesn't feel right it just doesn't feel can or and then there's like you know popcorn filled popcorn like it's just a little off like it's not the same stuff as in the park it's a little strange.

990
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:37,000
They have like a fruity pebbles churro right or they yeah.

991
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:42,000
That's something I would try and it would be not as good as my mind would imagine it.

992
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:48,000
They have grape soda they looks like they have watermelon I don't know about any of this.

993
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
I don't watermelon sounds extra bad.

994
01:15:50,000 --> 01:16:01,000
Downtown Disney failed me when I left the park and I didn't get a pretzel and I was really hoping to have a Mickey pretzel and then I got to the wet souls pretzel stand and they were closed to.

995
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:10,000
You shouldn't call it downtown Disney keep those things open when there's people around it's foolish and get them open ASAP.

996
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:21,000
Open them up now as fast as you can I mean you're saying that but then I also was seeing on some Disney Twitter account that I follow probably because of you guys.

997
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:28,000
There was the downtown Disney did open up today right like they were opening up shops and stuff today.

998
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:32,000
Florida I don't know when this is coming out but yeah.

999
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:37,000
These jokes could be not jokes by the time this comes out.

1000
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:38,000
Yes.

1001
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:44,000
Like everything could be open by the time this comes out and by the way if we released it tomorrow everything could be open.

1002
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:47,000
I don't I have no idea what's going on anymore.

1003
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:56,000
But the thing that will remain is that the grape soda churros at California Churro Company are probably questionable.

1004
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:59,000
Oh Scott that's right up your alley like a fine wine.

1005
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:03,000
Exactly the exact same thing.

1006
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
I was thinking maybe we could do a little.

1007
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
I don't want to dwell on any of these too long.

1008
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:19,000
I'm just going to try to quick hit him because I couldn't believe when I once I started looking into it how many bizarre Churro variations there were and I feel like we've not been kind to Churro variations.

1009
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:29,000
If I could just kind of list a couple of these and just see the ones that seem like the most experimental and let me just get kind of a gut reaction from you guys.

1010
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:31,000
Let's see.

1011
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:34,000
Apparently these are all for special events and stuff.

1012
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:40,000
At some point they tried a banana pudding churro rolled in vanilla cookie crumbles with banana pudding dipping sauce.

1013
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:42,000
I don't know.

1014
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,000
I don't know.

1015
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:44,000
I don't know.

1016
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,000
It depends.

1017
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:49,000
Like if a chef was doing that maybe.

1018
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:52,000
But if it's like banana extract I don't know.

1019
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:56,000
You need a precision that needs to be like precise to be good.

1020
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:58,000
Yeah.

1021
01:17:58,000 --> 01:17:59,000
That's what you're saying.

1022
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:00,000
So not teens?

1023
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:04,000
If teens are making it perhaps not.

1024
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
Let's go a little more savory.

1025
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
Maple bacon churro.

1026
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
This was in California Venture at one point in time.

1027
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:15,000
Dusted with cinnamon sugar and topped with maple icing and crumbled bacon.

1028
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:19,000
No.

1029
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:21,000
No.

1030
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
My answer is going to be no for all.

1031
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
But that is no.

1032
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:29,000
Let's leave the maple bacon behind in the 2010s.

1033
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:32,000
I'm a big maple guy but I don't.

1034
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:37,000
You're playing a real you're really rolling the dice when you start sticky.

1035
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:41,000
Who knows when that bacon was cooked or how good quality it was.

1036
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:42,000
I don't know.

1037
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:43,000
Yeah.

1038
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
It does often seem like charcoal.

1039
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
It seems like a year old.

1040
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:48,000
Yeah.

1041
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:53,000
I have some I have some churro facts open on my computer.

1042
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:56,000
I searched fun facts about Disney churros.

1043
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:57,000
Yes please.

1044
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:06,000
And in the video section it says Disneyland churro facts and the video is marked for 47 seconds long.

1045
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
So there seems to not be a ton.

1046
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:10,000
There is there's another video.

1047
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:16,000
There's another video of how long is the Disneyland churro which is somehow longer than the facts video.

1048
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:26,000
It's 50 seconds long and in the preview of the video it shows that the Disneyland churro is 16 inches long.

1049
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:28,000
Really.

1050
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,000
That's bigger than I thought.

1051
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:30,000
Yeah.

1052
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:31,000
Hmm.

1053
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:32,000
That's impressive.

1054
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:35,000
I think maybe they started it like they.

1055
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:36,000
Yeah.

1056
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,000
They did it.

1057
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:38,000
Like they.

1058
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:39,000
Yeah.

1059
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
They definitely again wanted something longer.

1060
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:43,000
I.

1061
01:19:43,000 --> 01:20:01,000
This was kind of a difficult episode to research at this moment because if you Google Disneyland churro you just get bombarded with a million websites who got content out of like Disneyland releases the churro recipe which is it's funny for a couple of reasons.

1062
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:05,000
One they put up a video of how to make them like two years ago.

1063
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,000
It's not like it was this great secret.

1064
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:26,000
And two it really feels like they're tempting fate because I think the one thing you really shouldn't gamble with if you're a home cook is heating a skillet of foot with a full cup of oil because that's just the easiest way to start a fire.

1065
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
That's the easiest way to cause chaos.

1066
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,000
And remember.

1067
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:30,000
Jesus Christ.

1068
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:41,000
If you're going to do that remember they did to put out a grease fire turn off heat put a lid on it or try throwing some salt or baking soda at the grease fire.

1069
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:57,000
But in in doubt when in doubt just call 911 but be very careful if you're trying to fry chicken or make churros at home because I don't I don't mess around with like a skillet of oil in at least when I cook.

1070
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:07,000
By the way Jason when you were talking that that little bit of audio that you heard was me queuing up the secrets of Disney origins of churros at Disneyland in 4k.

1071
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:13,000
And an advertisement played as I had paused it but then an advertisement played.

1072
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:20,000
And now I've completely but I I have this now bookmarked because this is the this is it's about four minutes long.

1073
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
It's the longest thing I found.

1074
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:31,000
But it seems like Scott it seems like it was some of the history that that you were talking about earlier or maybe it was a Jason who was telling us about the history.

1075
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:34,000
The Jim Loman tale yes.

1076
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:37,000
Yeah great man.

1077
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
Yeah.

1078
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:44,000
I let me do one more thing I discovered it's actually odd.

1079
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:45,000
Yeah.

1080
01:21:45,000 --> 01:22:05,000
A while ago Mitch you you said something about the Taco Bell sure ask items being like what Thanos would leave behind and relatedly there was an event in 2019 where they did a set of Infinity Stone churros.

1081
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:06,000
Yeah.

1082
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
I'm going to text you guys.

1083
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
This is a link that did it.

1084
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:11,000
Forgive me.

1085
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:16,000
There's that couldn't find like you know a worthy compendium of all of them.

1086
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:20,000
You're just going to have to scan these articles that I'm sending you.

1087
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
But you I feel like you need to see photos.

1088
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:26,000
I can't just describe them because if I describe them they sound OK.

1089
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:27,000
Let me do it really fast.

1090
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:30,000
These are spread out all across the parks.

1091
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
This is yeah it's it's it's rough.

1092
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:36,000
I mean I think the one that you're looking at you know you got all of them here.

1093
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:56,000
Soul Stone orange space stone blue raspberry mind stone lemon power stone blackberry time stone green apple and I think you're mainly looking at the reality stone cherry and that one I believe is covered in like pop rocks candy rock candy.

1094
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:57,000
Yeah.

1095
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:58,000
Yeah.

1096
01:22:58,000 --> 01:22:59,000
It looks terrible.

1097
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:00,000
These are horrible.

1098
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,000
Fucks.

1099
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:04,000
These are so fucked.

1100
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:07,000
It's a nightmare.

1101
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:20,000
It's really it's like the purple one though if you click on the purple one it looks like it was like sitting in the freezer and like part of it froze and part of it didn't.

1102
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:23,000
Yes.

1103
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
Yes the top of it looks frozen.

1104
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:36,000
Yeah it looks like it's just like somebody accidentally put it somewhere and now they're selling it like it or like the freezer was broken like half of the freezer wasn't working.

1105
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
The other half was doing an OK job.

1106
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
Oh that looks fucking disgusting.

1107
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:54,000
And by the way this is the this is the Twitter account that the Walt Disney World News Twitter account was the one that I that I saw the downtown Disney thing and my my my my question is why did these have to be separate articles.

1108
01:23:55,000 --> 01:24:03,000
Why couldn't all these power in this power stone and whatever the infinity stone churros be in just one article.

1109
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:09,000
Yes there's a new article for each review of each different color churro.

1110
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:13,000
I'm tempted to criticize that but it does sound like something we would do.

1111
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
That's true it does sound like that.

1112
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:28,000
That's just like all these dozens of sites getting posts out of like the Disneyland just rewording the Disney parks blog or the rewording Joe roadies Instagram posts.

1113
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:35,000
The the soul stone the orange looks like it's bleeding orange blood.

1114
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:42,000
It's like there's a consistency like thick orange blood is oozing out of an orange churro.

1115
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:46,000
Blood orange is popular but when does it actually look like it's bleeding.

1116
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,000
That's true.

1117
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:51,000
You know what actually it also could just be buffalo sauce.

1118
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:57,000
It could be delicious buffalo sauce soaked in an orange churro.

1119
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:00,000
Oh let's celebrate crispy.

1120
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:04,000
By the way I want I just want I just want to give the headlines for each of these things.

1121
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:10,000
Review new power stone churro lacks cosmic power at Hollywood land in Disney California Adventure.

1122
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:19,000
And then here is and then the other one is review don't exchange your soul for the soul stone churro in Disney California Adventure.

1123
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:27,000
All of them are like these all the headlines are like these suck.

1124
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:34,000
In different dressed up you guys are the Marvel experts if you had to come up with a headline to describe your feelings.

1125
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:39,000
Oh well I'd have to be about each stone I guess.

1126
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:44,000
So what are we at the time stone.

1127
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:50,000
You don't save time for one of these.

1128
01:25:50,000 --> 01:26:02,000
I was going to go for a generic for like the anytime a newspaper tries to write about comic books and inevitably the headline is Biff Bam Pow comics not for kids anymore.

1129
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:09,000
So Biff Bam Pow these these churros will torture your taste buds.

1130
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:12,000
Pretty good.

1131
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:16,000
There'll be an infinity war in your stomach.

1132
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:29,000
Here's my headline this one specifically made for all the listeners just like all the Avengers movies and Galaxy's Edge these churros suck.

1133
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
Oh no Pete.

1134
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:42,000
It's just going for cheap heat Mitch going to war with the Marvel fans now to bring it on baby.

1135
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:50,000
Mitch is challenging you the military industrial complex the military advisors.

1136
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:51,000
Yeah they're gonna be upset.

1137
01:26:51,000 --> 01:27:09,000
I found just we were speaking about teens and churros a little bit and because of that I googled Six Flags Magic Mountain churros and apparently Six Flags Magic Mountain had an event last year where if you bought a churro you could stay late in the park and ride special rides.

1138
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:21,000
Special purchase a churro at a participating food location inside the park and you'll receive a special event wristband to an extent to attend an exclusive ride event that night.

1139
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:28,000
So you would get like a special like after hours event if you bought a churro at Six Flags.

1140
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:31,000
Everything going well.

1141
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:38,000
That's how dire it is over there that you that they're that you they give a special park treatment if you buy a churro.

1142
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:56,000
Basically yes what that is saying is that like let's look at let's break this down the special after hours event at Disney cost you know 100 $150 this event cost $5 and they're losing money because they're also giving you a churro.

1143
01:27:56,000 --> 01:28:02,000
So it's like you're paying like maybe two dollars to stay late at Six Flags.

1144
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:13,000
Mike you sent a picture of all the different churros in an infinity gauntlet and it's kind of unpleasant look.

1145
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:16,000
Yes that's right.

1146
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:26,000
It looks like it looks like like some sort of fungus run amok or like like some sort of plant growth that's not natural.

1147
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:27,000
Yeah.

1148
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:37,000
What is the what's the Natalie Portman move annihilation Disney's annihilation.

1149
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:44,000
That is very annihilation ask it's a very it's it's it's someone says it's so basically someone brought bought.

1150
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:55,000
I wonder if they were just selling that it was it's the Thanos is glove and it's filled with every stone and churro infinity stone churro.

1151
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:56,000
They were selling.

1152
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
Yeah.

1153
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:06,000
I mean it's like who wants to do that I mean whatever wants that bloggers people writing these things the bumper car boys.

1154
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:07,000
Yeah.

1155
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:16,000
They they're what they were selling a Thanos like mug like in his like infinity gauntlet which makes a lot more sense than this.

1156
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:17,000
Yeah.

1157
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:20,000
Like they're not in the shape of stones.

1158
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:31,000
Why would why would they you know what I mean like they're not infinity sticks infinity sticks infinity stone cookies would make more sense.

1159
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
Yeah.

1160
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:34,000
Yeah.

1161
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:35,000
Yeah.

1162
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:43,000
Like it's just or a moose shells as we came as we were talking about on the treats episode.

1163
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:53,000
You know what guys what I thought I was going to turn you around and say have you say that churros are the number one snack in the Disney Park.

1164
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:59,000
But after seeing the infinity stone churros you've won me over churros suck.

1165
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:08,000
Oh no no we can't have no it's like it's like a Thanos defeated us.

1166
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:11,000
Mike lost his resilience.

1167
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
No this is bullshit here.

1168
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
Wait and I but I think I could turn it around.

1169
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:19,000
I'm sitting on something that I think might help us have a happy ending here.

1170
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:24,000
I'm going to check your phones one more time because I'm going to send you a series of three photos.

1171
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:34,000
Mike you brought up six flags and I take you now to six flags Mexico a park I don't believe I realize existed until now.

1172
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:38,000
It was formerly the park that had trapped free Willy.

1173
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
That was before six flags bought it.

1174
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:43,000
So don't hold that against these photos.

1175
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:44,000
Yeah.

1176
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:45,000
Yeah.

1177
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:50,000
I'm not building a good case but I'm going to send you three lovable pals and they don't have an official name.

1178
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:53,000
But you know what I'll make one up right now.

1179
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:54,000
In an alliterative way.

1180
01:30:54,000 --> 01:31:00,000
These are I'll name them the churro chums at six flags Mexico.

1181
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:05,000
You can take photos with three giant churros.

1182
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:13,000
They're like avatar proportions if a human being is five to six feet I think these are like 10 to 11.

1183
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:17,000
They look like will vinton claymation characters.

1184
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:32,000
They kind of remind me they're sort of in the family of other characters I love like the walking Hershey bars in Hershey land or also they're a little bit like my buddy Charlie chip the mascot of fries electronics.

1185
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:36,000
The greaser looks like a California raisin to me.

1186
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:37,000
Very much so.

1187
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
That might be where I'm getting the will vinton vibes.

1188
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
He's got big old sneakers.

1189
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:49,000
They've got sort of like Mickey Mouse s glims just the just the black little twigs and then big white gloves.

1190
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:54,000
There's kind of a Mike said agree sir you might call him kind of an Elvis looking one.

1191
01:31:54,000 --> 01:32:05,000
There's just a guy in a big mustache and a sombrero and and then and then like a cowboy the sheriff for churro town and he's got a big gun.

1192
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:06,000
He's got a gun.

1193
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:11,000
It's like an unforgiven like Clint Eastwood and unforgiven he's seen too much.

1194
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:12,000
He's killed too many.

1195
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:15,000
It's it's it's it's it's there's two things that stand out about him.

1196
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:20,000
One is that yes it is just it's just a straight up gun.

1197
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
It's not like a fun churro gun.

1198
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:26,000
It's a straight up just like fucking big ass gun.

1199
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:31,000
And then she was that he just you just fall into his baby blue eyes.

1200
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
He has these baby blue eyes.

1201
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:34,000
Oh my God.

1202
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:35,000
You're right.

1203
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:36,000
You're right.

1204
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:37,000
The other one of them is wearing sunglasses.

1205
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:40,000
You can't tell the other his eyes are not as piercing.

1206
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:47,000
Yeah God this who is he like who's like who's an actor who's got some of the best eyes right now.

1207
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
Who's like a classic blue eyed.

1208
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,000
He's just he's such a hunk.

1209
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
Who's got the best eyes right now in the business.

1210
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:56,000
He's got the best eyes right now.

1211
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
Actors with good eyes.

1212
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:03,000
I'm looking at you actually you know what don't people who's the serial killer that people think is hot.

1213
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:04,000
All of them.

1214
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:05,000
All of them.

1215
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:06,000
Yeah.

1216
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:07,000
Yeah.

1217
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:08,000
Yeah.

1218
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:11,000
But the one who's like especially hunky a lot of people were saying oh well.

1219
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
Did Zac Efron play him.

1220
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:14,000
Yeah.

1221
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:15,000
Who's that.

1222
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:16,000
Which one is that.

1223
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:17,000
I got a picture.

1224
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:21,000
I got a picture of Bradley Cooper that he it's very similar.

1225
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:25,000
Well it's a little he's a little lighter than this guy but he's got the eye.

1226
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:28,000
He's got eyes that really draw you in I think.

1227
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:34,000
So this churro is like a combo Bradley Cooper and Ted Bundy.

1228
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
Yeah there you go.

1229
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:40,000
I agree.

1230
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:44,000
And he's got a gun so there's sort of the threat angle.

1231
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:54,000
And he's very macho like I bet he is I bet he kind of talks like what's what's his character in Star is Born.

1232
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
Oh.

1233
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:57,000
Oh God.

1234
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:58,000
Jackson Jackson made.

1235
01:33:58,000 --> 01:33:59,000
Yeah.

1236
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:00,000
It's scared as guys.

1237
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
I mean yeah.

1238
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:05,000
I'm just I just want to do right by you.

1239
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:08,000
Want to take another look at you.

1240
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:09,000
That's the lie.

1241
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:10,000
Yeah.

1242
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:11,000
There you go.

1243
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:16,000
That's what Mitch says when he walks away from the churros.

1244
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:20,000
I just want to take one more look at you.

1245
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:25,000
I saw I saw Bradley Mike Carlson's Bradley Cooper and I raised him a crisp pine.

1246
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:29,000
Yeah the crisp prying as the good he has the key is a good eyes too.

1247
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:34,000
I think I think if I think I think Bradley's maybe a little bit more a little bit more hypnotizing.

1248
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
I think I think those work a little bit better.

1249
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:49,000
So the three churro eyes the three men were the most attracted to our Bradley Cooper crisp pine and this churro sheriff the churro sheriff slay me.

1250
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:55,000
I would love to hang out with a churro sheriff in like in a Pizza Hut sort of fashion.

1251
01:34:55,000 --> 01:35:06,000
Wait what do you mean pizza in a pizza fashion like in that like you know I would I would eat them like how the how pizza eats himself and his little buddy there eats them too.

1252
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
I think I would I would want to eat that.

1253
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
Oh right.

1254
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:11,000
Sure.

1255
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:12,000
Like my friend.

1256
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:15,000
But you're just lowering him in so you can take a big bite out of him.

1257
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:22,000
Yeah yes I mean like I would be looking into his big blue eyes as I as I ate him but I mean I would eat him for sure.

1258
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:25,000
How can you turn down eating a giant churro like that.

1259
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:26,000
If he was a man.

1260
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:32,000
I said I said that I'd feel bad as I ate him.

1261
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:37,000
What if he what if he was like Joe stop stop.

1262
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:42,000
I'm in pain you're hurting me you're killing me.

1263
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
Or what if he was like keep it going.

1264
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
You're doing the right thing.

1265
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:49,000
It's a living.

1266
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:55,000
And he is and he's like you're like hey put the gun to my temple while I eat you.

1267
01:35:55,000 --> 01:36:05,000
You know honestly what this has made me think is that Disney needs to have some sort of churro property.

1268
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,000
They've got to do some sort of churro property.

1269
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:15,000
Well you know that brings us back to Videopolis because they would to drum up churro sales when they first introduced them they would play.

1270
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:24,000
She's got Betty Davis eyes but they change it to she's got piercing churro eyes.

1271
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
Six likes really the six flags.

1272
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:36,000
Yes like the piercing churro I've had six lights really skirting copyright here with the piercing churro.

1273
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:39,000
Do you know what you know what.

1274
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:40,000
Here's what I think.

1275
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
What do you guys think of this.

1276
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:55,000
Every churro stand there's it's Pluto's ass and then the and then the and then the churros are just come out of those you wrap them right from there.

1277
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
What do you guys think.

1278
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:00,000
Wait they come out of his ass out of the hole.

1279
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
They come out of his ass.

1280
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:06,000
Yeah yeah yeah they come out of the Pluto's asshole basically.

1281
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
So he is like a long shits.

1282
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:11,000
So yeah Pluto is taking these big long shits.

1283
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:19,000
And then also like how people pick up dog mess with like plastic baggies those those white rappers are kind of like the baggies you know what I'm saying.

1284
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:24,000
If the baggies are like kind of themed well I think I do like this idea.

1285
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:33,000
Yeah Mike this is the what you were lacking in terms of Instagram ability in terms of visual panache with churros.

1286
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:36,000
I think Mitch just just just invented it.

1287
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:37,000
He fixed the problem.

1288
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:46,000
If the Pluto makes a noise when it comes out to that'll be an extra little level of imaginary like like relieved.

1289
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:47,000
Oh struggling.

1290
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:48,000
OK yeah.

1291
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:49,000
Yeah.

1292
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:53,000
Because it's a long piece like you shouldn't be making that like 16 inch shits.

1293
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:54,000
Wait a minute.

1294
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:59,000
So Pluto suffering every time someone orders sure how he's screaming.

1295
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:02,000
And then at the end and he's relieved at the end.

1296
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:03,000
He's relieved at the end.

1297
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,000
It's a good thing.

1298
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,000
He's struggling while it comes out.

1299
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:15,000
But also I just want to say that canonically then that's what the churros are then Pluto shits.

1300
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:18,000
And I think that that is better than the alternative.

1301
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:19,000
Right.

1302
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:20,000
And they won't say shit.

1303
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:23,000
So what are they are they Pluto dumps.

1304
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:24,000
Pluto dumps.

1305
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:28,000
Or make it alliterative as I like to do.

1306
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:29,000
Pluto plops.

1307
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:30,000
Pluto plops.

1308
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:31,000
Oh that's cute.

1309
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,000
Yeah that's a cute way to do it.

1310
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:34,000
Here we go.

1311
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:35,000
Churros anymore.

1312
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:36,000
Right.

1313
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:42,000
The most offensive thing you can do to its culture and where it came from.

1314
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:43,000
You don't name it.

1315
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,000
You don't call it churros anymore.

1316
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,000
You throw that out the window and you call them.

1317
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:48,000
That dumb old name.

1318
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:53,000
No those are Pluto plops now.

1319
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:54,000
Come on everyone.

1320
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
Come back to the Disney parks.

1321
01:38:56,000 --> 01:39:02,000
Make a new mouth memories with Pluto plops.

1322
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:05,000
Yeah it's great.

1323
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:06,000
You did it.

1324
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:07,000
You fixed it.

1325
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
It's IP Mike Mitchell.

1326
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:12,000

01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:13,000
Wow.

01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:14,000
Wow.

1329
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:15,000
A brilliant idea.

1330
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:19,000
Thank you for spitting perfect imaginary ideas with us.

1331
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:28,000
Straight fire straight fire from that.

1332
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:29,000
I don't really have it.

1333
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:32,000
I don't have anything to really promote except for that.

1334
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:39,000
You know we should open that back up the parks.

1335
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,000
Hashtag open the gates.

1336
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:43,000
Hashtag Mike Mitchell.

1337
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:44,000
I'm on the side.

1338
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:45,000
I'm on the side.

1339
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,000
We're going to lock the gates.

1340
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:52,000
Of course something that and also I'm trying to get her eyes out of people by saying all

1341
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:53,000
that stuff was bad.

1342
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:54,000
Don't be mad at me.

1343
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:55,000
I'm sorry.

1344
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:56,000
Or the boys.

1345
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:57,000

Gotcha.

Look you made everybody so happy with Pluto plops by the end.

1350

I think we did it.

1358
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
I think yeah I don't.

1359
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:37,000
Look next time when the park when I feel comfortable going to the park next maybe I will first

1360
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:40,000
thing try a churro to see.

Wow.
