1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Boo.

4
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:18,000
The following haunt cast contains child television producers, wholesome TV romance, a deep conspiracy

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:27,040
to yet again make dad look foolish, and names, names, and yes more names.

6
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:35,040
Adam Sass joins us to talk murder she wrote, mystery theater, on today's haunt cast, The

7
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,040
Fright.

8
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:59,040
Welcome, foolish mortals, to haunt cast The Fright, the haunt cast about scream parks hosted

9
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:07,000
by three good ghouls whose hair is turning gray from fright and also age.

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:15,040
I'm Scottlejuice for the C's great, and over here, Frightful Narlson.

11
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:22,720
Frightful, I'll write him down in case I introduce him, Frightful Narlson, and to my left.

12
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,040
Jagged Slash and Drain.

13
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,040
Okay, let's, slash and drain.

14
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,040
Like, slash and you drain the flood.

15
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:37,040
No, no, I get that, it's the, like, I guess, you're taking the D-E-N and turning that into

16
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,040
drain, it's the same bookends of letters, I guess.

17
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,040
There's stuff floating around, yeah, the same letters are mostly floating around.

18
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,040
I think I like it.

19
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,040
Mm-hmm.

20
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,040
I think I like it.

21
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,040
This is kind of, this was the path I took too.

22
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,040
Thumbs up for our guest.

23
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:56,040
Mine was just an, I finally fixed what, that lasts so many years, I think.

24
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,040
I think that, mine is like, I didn't make a new one up, I just corrected the mistakes

25
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,040
of the past haunt cast.

26
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,040
You just, like, nudged what had been in the past.

27
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:09,040
Yeah, well, I felt like, I've been reflecting on our past haunt cast, the Frights, of which

28
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:14,040
there have now been many, and in my head, every single one of them has, like, ten minutes

29
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,040
of name discussion.

30
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,040
This one's no exception.

31
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:21,040
Now, but maybe, that we've cleared this up, I gave everyone advance time to come up with

32
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,040
their names, now, we just plow ahead.

33
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,040
And we're gonna do the podcast now.

34
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,040
The names that we love, and now we're free.

35
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:32,040
So, future haunt cast, you know, unless you change a couple episodes in, we fuck it all

36
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,040
up again.

37
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,040
Well, we'll see.

38
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,040
That is fine, that's acceptable.

39
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:42,040
It is haunt cast, the Frights season, this is kicking it off, so a lot of fun stuff planned.

40
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:47,040
We're hitting some haunts, and by that I mean Mike, and Mike only is hitting some haunts,

41
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,040
because he loves them, as established now.

42
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:55,040
But we're not just attending Halloween events, we are also hosting Halloween events.

43
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,040
For the first time ever, we're doing a live haunt cast, the Frights.

44
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:05,040
We've got two Halloween shows, live and live streaming, or live screaming, thanks to Dynasty

45
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,040
Typewriter.

46
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:10,040
That is Friday, October 20th, I believe.

47
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:16,040
Tickets available for both, for now, but grab them while you can, and if you're not in LA,

48
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,040
live scream it.

49
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:22,040
And we're, I think it's exciting that we get to dimensionalize this season, and to,

50
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:25,040
you know, do our attempt at a haunt.

51
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:30,040
I agree, and I think if you, I think you, from what we're talking about doing, I think

52
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,040
you're going to want to be at the haunt cast shows.

53
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,040
I think so.

54
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,040
Yeah, yeah.

55
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,040
So I'll just say that.

56
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,040
Fun stuff cooking up.

57
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:46,040
But, before we get there, we are kicking off the month at large with the scariest shit

58
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,040
you could ever imagine.

59
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:52,040
An attraction with the word murder in the title.

60
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,040
Can you imagine?

61
00:03:54,040 --> 00:04:00,040
Does that justify putting it in this month, which I've now started to question, should

62
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,040
it have not been in the month?

63
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,040
Because it's just a pleasant attraction about the post-production process.

64
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,040
Well, but there's lots of secrets to be uncovered in Cabot Cove, you know?

65
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,040
Yes, true.

66
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:17,040
Well, it is a place, yes, there's a setting that has a lot more horror and intrigue and

67
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,040
such.

68
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,040
We're talking about the Murder She Wrote Mystery Theater.

69
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,040
I think that name was nudged here and there, but that's what it is in my head.

70
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:32,040
And joining us to talk about this, a longtime listener, first-time caller, someone who's

71
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:39,040
very passionate about Murder She Wrote, much like Jessica Fletcher, is a novelist, and I

72
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,040
suspect this is not a coincidence, and we'll get into it, we'll talk about it, but the

73
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:49,040
award-winning author of LGBTQ Young Adult Books for Penguin Random House, including

74
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,040
Your Lonely Nights Are Over, it's Adam Sass.

75
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,040
Hello.

76
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,040
Hello.

77
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,040
I am so, yes, I am a longtime listener.

78
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,040
This is very like a Clifford Will Rise moment.

79
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:05,040
I'm very much having an out-of-body experience right now.

80
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,040
Like you made it to Dinosaur World.

81
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:12,040
For real, no, for real, I'm having the Martin Chord face right now where I'm just like

82
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:15,040
petrified, like petrified with joy.

83
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,040
Yeah, this is great.

84
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,040
Surrounded by three Larry the Scary Rexes.

85
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,040
That's right, yeah.

86
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,040
Hopefully not so scary.

87
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,040
No Charles Groden's, no.

88
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,040
I don't think I...

89
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,040
Well, one.

90
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,040
Well, hey, hey.

91
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,040
He's our Uncle Martin.

92
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:34,040
No, I think, no, and no, I think, I was approving of Slash and Drain earlier because it did

93
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:40,040
feel, I was going to say it did feel, I wanted to wait to be properly introduced as his podcast

94
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:45,040
fashion, but I wanted to comment Slash and Drain, I feel like is very H.H. Holmes.

95
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:50,040
It feels very, it feels very like, oh, you have a methodical system of like, oh, you

96
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:54,040
slash and drain it, like you have a, like it's like, it's not just murder, it's like,

97
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,040
oh, you just did it once.

98
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,040
Like, no, you've got an apparatus.

99
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,040
It's like Sweeney Todd.

100
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,040
Sure.

101
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:07,040
Yeah, the boarding houses with the gas pipes going into them, the barber shop chair that

102
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,040
like dumps you into the contraptions.

103
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:13,040
Slash and Drain, you got a system that felt very correct.

104
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,040
It's just like cold, it's industrial.

105
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,040
He doesn't even think of it as killing.

106
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:19,040
It's just like, you know, I do this, I slash and drain.

107
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:22,040
Yeah, it was Slash and Drain, you know, it's a service he provides.

108
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:27,040
Well, last year everyone was going crazy for Terrorfire 2.

109
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,040
Oh, yeah.

110
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:33,040
I never sat down and watched, but I watched the clips of, and it is like, uh.

111
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,040
This was the thing with the clown.

112
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,040
The clown.

113
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:40,040
You all yelled at me for not remembering the clown, who then we determined was not mentioned

114
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,040
when it came up.

115
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,040
Is that, that's that one?

116
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:47,040
Well, wasn't it like, wasn't it maybe said in like a big cacophony of noise or something?

117
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,040
The name, we checked this.

118
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,040
This was with Griffin.

119
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,040
I can't remember.

120
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:54,040
There was Marshall Gate, and then there was that like, you don't remember the name of

121
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,040
the clown?

122
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,040
It was just said.

123
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,040
The name of the clown was not said.

124
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,040
Okay.

125
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,040
I don't remember the details.

126
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:05,040
It was another, it was one of those where yell and yell and yell and check the tape.

127
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,040
We yell a lot on the show.

128
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:10,040
Yeah, it is my goal as a listener to like gain the confidence throughout the show to

129
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:13,040
then like badger you about something that you don't remember.

130
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:21,040
If you're at all any from the backlog, because you are, and thank you and bless you for this,

131
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:25,040
you have, you've listened to like, it sounds like everything you've been a supporter of

132
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,040
the show, which we really appreciate.

133
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:32,040
So that said, yes, if you recall something that I shit out of my mouth one time, there

134
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,040
was that it was incorrect or wrong.

135
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,040
We're going to open with the list of grievances.

136
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,040
Yes, this is how we're going to do this.

137
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:43,040
No, I mean, listen, yeah, I was introduced to you through through the pandemic.

138
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:46,040
And it was, it got me through it.

139
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,040
And this is when I was writing all of these books.

140
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:54,040
And so like this was, you know, as I was writing this, which is a very, um, um, contrary to

141
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:59,040
what the show Murder She Wrote would have you believe it is a very long involved draining process,

142
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:03,040
not just happily typing.

143
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:06,040
And then, you know, she just then Murder She Wrote as a show.

144
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:11,040
We're going to get to this, but like, I do want to pull you all with like your knowledge of the show

145
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,040
itself, because there's the mystery theater.

146
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:16,040
But then we're talking about the show as well, because I think that's a little important to

147
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:22,040
understanding the power of what Original Universal did with this with this theater.

148
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:27,040
But anyway, no, no, everybody here got me through like an immense up and down.

149
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:36,040
I had put out my first book in the first year of lockdown, which I do do not recommend.

150
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,040
You can help it.

151
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:42,040
Creativity on top of all that was was tough for anyone.

152
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:46,040
I was going to say like anybody who had to like release anything and then it was, you know,

153
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:50,040
but then it's like people are releasing stuff now and we're in the middle of something now.

154
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:55,040
There's going to be something that's going to fuck up the release of something.

155
00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:03,040
But like also writing, I feel like can be like a I mean, you tell me I feel like it can be like a lonely process, an arduous process.

156
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,040
So that on top of pandemic seems a little crazy.

157
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:11,040
It's like I know we're all like making fun of like parrot.

158
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,040
That's a parasocial relationship now.

159
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:15,040
But I'm like parasocial stuff got me through it.

160
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:22,040
I think like you can have a very healthy parasocial thing as long as you remain in control of it at a certain point.

161
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:25,040
But I think you do need because like I'm an extroverted person.

162
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:30,040
So like it didn't come naturally to me to be like, oh, just like be in my room and then I'll write everything in my room.

163
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,040
And then it's the pandemic.

164
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:36,040
So I'll release the book virtually in my room and then I'll just stay in my room.

165
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:40,040
And so that's kind of how my first two books went.

166
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:44,040
And now I'm at my third one and I am finally getting out and meeting readers for the first time.

167
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,040
Oh, sweet.

168
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,040
And it's been amazing.

169
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:54,040
It's been like I did like my first book tour and it was it was fantastic, which is something Jessica Fletcher is always doing on Murder, She Wrote.

170
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:58,040
She was basically like solving murders on book tours, essentially.

171
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:02,040
Though that's a lot of the justification for getting her to these different places.

172
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,040
There'd be like stops.

173
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:08,040
Yeah, there'd be like a third of the season would be Cabot Cove, her town.

174
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:12,040
And then to shake it up, she'd like and then the third would be like New York City.

175
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,040
She's dealing with some publishing industry stuff.

176
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:21,040
Someone's adapting once it once a season, someone's adapting something and then she's dealing with a Hollywood kind of murder.

177
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,040
And then there'd be like tour stops or like a niece's wedding.

178
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,040
Oh, yeah.

179
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,040
Yeah, because otherwise, how do you like how do you keep it small town charm?

180
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:35,040
But then don't have like you're not stuck in small town for every to do.

181
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,040
How many seasons were eleven?

182
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,040
Is that right?

183
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,040
Twelve.

184
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:44,040
So that's 12 seasons, 264 episodes and four post series movies.

185
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,040
Movies.

186
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,040
So many murders.

187
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,040
So many murders, yes.

188
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,040
In fact, I'm wearing a shirt.

189
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,040
Yeah, nice.

190
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,040
I killed them. I killed them all.

191
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:59,040
That is a popular online joke is that she was actually she was a slash and drain.

192
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,040
And it was her doing it, which is which is actually a theory I don't subscribe to.

193
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,040
I actually think it's a little bit more metaphysical than that.

194
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:11,040
I think she is sort of such an entity and it's such a force for good.

195
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:19,040
She was sort of metaphysically drawn to these areas of immense conflict just before a murder was about to happen.

196
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:34,040
And it almost like she, you know, I think it was a lot more spiritual than that, where she just happened to be in these locations when there was so much tension in the town or so much tension in the place that it happened around her.

197
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:38,040
Wow. Yeah. So I have a very I've been with the show for a really long time.

198
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,040
So she's this guardian angel figure.

199
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:48,040
Yes. She can't stop it necessarily, but it's better that she be she's like there and planted on the ground and ready to go when shit hits the fan.

200
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:57,040
Exactly. Her role was usually to clear the name of an innocent person who had been wrongfully blamed by like an incompetent police force.

201
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:03,040
So again, these the shows are very rewatchable because the shows like running theme is like these police can't do a thing.

202
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:08,040
They just are arresting the wrong person on purpose just to wrap this up.

203
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:13,040
And so like a lot of this stuff sort of a lot of it really does just hold up to today.

204
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,040
Timely. Very timely. Yeah.

205
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:20,040
So there's a way that there's a there's a there's still a comfort to this show.

206
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:26,040
But yeah, it's it's it's writing can be a very solitary thing.

207
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:39,040
And so I think, you know, and definitely like experiencing podcast the right during this time was was because, you know, because theme parks were and are like super important to me, not just Disney, but just any any of the theme parks.

208
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:43,040
I grew up right outside of Gurney. Yeah. Yeah.

209
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,040
Yeah. For Six Flags, my sixth person as well.

210
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:59,040
And Universal, which obviously I'm going to get into on here with the universal original universal Orlando, Florida is my preferred anything like to anything now at all.

211
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,040
Yeah, for sure.

212
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:09,040
Almost to the point where I'm like, I almost can't go to the current Orlando because like I'm just so like, none of it's the same.

213
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:13,040
I'm too roller coasters every like taking over those sound stages.

214
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,040
This should be calmer and drier.

215
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,040
I was like, yes.

216
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:26,040
Well, you know, so I had the and I remember there was an episode we all brought this up, but there was the VHS tape that John Forsyte hosted.

217
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,040
Oh, yeah.

218
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:32,040
That we all know and love retail price at the time.

219
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,040
$40.

220
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:39,040
My parents had no choice but to pay.

221
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,040
We had to leave with it.

222
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,040
So I was like nine years old by Charlie.

223
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:54,040
I was like, no, I don't understand because no, because so this goes even further back because like the bug first hit me when like in 1989 when Disney MGM opened, they like John Ritter hosted a special.

224
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,040
I don't know if you all saw this.

225
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,040
Yes.

226
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,040
They, you know, forgive me.

227
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,040
I get because there was so many specials.

228
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:08,040
They've made like four specials when that I definitely remember John Ritter run around those been being in the boat that where that rocks back and forth.

229
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,040
He's getting hit by the wave.

230
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,040
Yeah.

231
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:17,040
So like, no, it was an important special in my house because I just was such a like movie kid at such an early age.

232
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:22,040
And this was like and it just made Disney MGM feel like so huge.

233
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:26,040
And so and John Forsyte is in that as well.

234
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:35,040
So he like crosses both like he joins the world kind of Angela Lansbury as well because she was such a universal person.

235
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,040
But she's also Mrs. Potts.

236
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,040
Yeah.

237
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,040
So her voice is playing.

238
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:45,040
They're still using the recordings of her because Mrs. Potts is like a big suited.

239
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:50,040
Mrs. Potts is a big lumbering teapot as tall as the beast.

240
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:53,040
Strange aspect of all these shows.

241
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,040
But yeah, that's true.

242
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,040
Yeah.

243
00:14:55,040 --> 00:15:02,040
You have these sort of like like John Forsyte and Angela Lansbury really did like kind of cross this boundary between the two.

244
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:12,040
If you went to both parks around 91 or 92, you were like it there wasn't such a war on now.

245
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:15,040
You know, there was that there was a little reaching across the aisle.

246
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,040
Sure.

247
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,040
You viewed it all as one continuum.

248
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,040
I did.

249
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,040
Yes.

250
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:27,040
I was super into this John Ritter special, which is very I urge anybody at home to watch it because it's all on YouTube.

251
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,040
And it's the most 1989 thing you've ever seen.

252
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:37,040
It is like there's this opening act that they do down the main drag leading up to the Chinese theater.

253
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:42,040
Is it one of those where it's like there are 200 ladies with big feathered hats.

254
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:45,040
It's like all 40s Hollywood glamour.

255
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,040
Yes, exactly.

256
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,040
There was so much kickline stuff.

257
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,040
There was like Ann Miller.

258
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,040
They got her in a kickline.

259
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,040
Yeah.

260
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:55,040
And but they're like it's like Ann Miller and the Pointer Sister.

261
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,040
They were very Team Disney.

262
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,040
Yeah.

263
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,040
Yeah.

264
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,040
You can force them out of there.

265
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,040
Then we got the Golden Girl.

266
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,040
They were always pulling those Golden Girls out for DM.

267
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:15,040
So but then you got me into the VHS of the of the John Forsyte thing, which is probably the best way you could view unless you're finding something I did not.

268
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,040
Probably the best way you could view what Murder, She Wrote Mystery Theater actually was.

269
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,040
Some of the actual.

270
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,040
Yeah.

271
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,040
Well, queued up here.

272
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:27,040
You say you say John Forsyte's name three times and he appears.

273
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,040
Here's his intro.

274
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:35,040
I love the you know if you can play these for almost every universal OG attraction, which we're running out.

275
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,040
It's a curtain.

276
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,040
I know.

277
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,040
We are almost out of the original stuff.

278
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:43,040
I don't we've not done earthquake special effects.

279
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:47,040
Or maybe that might be an extra.

280
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,040
That one another.

281
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,040
Yeah.

282
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,040
They've named that three different times.

283
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,040
Like that was the span of the opera.

284
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:55,040
Then it was Gory gruesome grotesque horror makeup show.

285
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,040
And I've tracked all this.

286
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,040
I've tracked the decline to me.

287
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,040
It's so much more famous and popular now.

288
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,040
I'm sure.

289
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,040
But but like but not to me.

290
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,040
Yeah.

291
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,040
You know you like the original way.

292
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:12,040
But here you know I love handing it off to John Forsyte to do the succinct intro.

293
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:15,040
The succinct intro of the attraction so we don't have to.

294
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:19,040
So let's let him.

295
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:23,040
It's murder she wrote and it's post production time.

296
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:28,040
The most challenging drama of all takes place after the cameras stop rolling.

297
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,040
Editing.

298
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,040
That's true.

299
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,040
Recording dubbing special effects mixing.

300
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:40,040
They're just some of the elements that finalize each episode of Angela Lansbury's hit series.

301
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,040
Cut cut for us on the set.

302
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:49,040
But when we go into the heart of how motion picture history is made you the visitor will be the star.

303
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:58,040
It's great entertainment because Universal Studios Florida is lights camera action.

304
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:01,040
That could have been said at any point in the longest.

305
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:06,040
Never let an old fart like that do that now.

306
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,040
They'd never.

307
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,040
Oh yeah.

308
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,040
So great.

309
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:12,040
Like that's the end of a that's the end of the empire.

310
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,040
Especially I think yes.

311
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:26,040
Both parks I would say but especially universe what I remember like looking at like brochures in the hotel room when you go or in the hotel lobby when you went to Orlando in the 90s that you'd leave through that.

312
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:32,040
And yeah there's maybe the centerfold of it is back to the future the ride with big dinosaur in the center.

313
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:48,040
But like they also they take pages to show you all of the kind of elderly classic actors who made a point of being there who are now I can't but I feel like you know they're there was there like they were like oh yeah.

314
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,040
Well she was I'm not sure if she was at her line.

315
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:55,040
I know she was at Hollywood when they did something out there but yeah there was that type of like I think they had.

316
00:18:55,040 --> 00:19:00,040
Yeah exactly all those type of you see a tribute was a thing you could do.

317
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:04,040
And yes and I would say Lucy was not in her prime.

318
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:07,040
I mean in the sense of popularity obviously she was sure.

319
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,040
I'm dead at that point.

320
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:23,040
It's all such that I when I think about Universal Florida 90 to 92 I think about like older ladies with kind of like you know like what's not pompadour but like you know just like yeah yeah yeah.

321
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:36,040
Yeah that kind of hair feels like very powder and maybe like maybe wig and maybe dye and like it was so much a part and that it all that and that you go in and it's all Schwab's pharmacy and it's all classic 50s 50s.

322
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:48,040
Yeah Golden Age of Hollywood you were saying like John Forsyth and Angela Lansbury kind of tied the parks together but the other thing that would tie them together was Golden Age of Hollywood.

323
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:55,040
And if you got an older actor who had seen the Golden Age of Hollywood they were set you know.

324
00:19:55,040 --> 00:20:01,040
It was amazing like you could I mean I'm getting all blurry now I'm like I'm like Mickey Rooney was one of them.

325
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:13,040
But yeah yeah but I remember them being like because that's the other thing was you know you'd have like even this this video this VHS that was so expensive.

326
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,040
So neat.

327
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,040
Very stiff.

328
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,040
Very stiff.

329
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:20,040
But children love rewatching stuff.

330
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:26,040
I did and I like what rewatched it so many times and now I'm like rewatching it and I'm like showing it to my friends them.

331
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:30,040
I was like I'm about to be on this you know show we're gonna have to you know catch up on this stuff.

332
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:40,040
I like John Forsyth he's like I'm like oh this was like my guy and then like I put it on and my friends are just like watching him go in 1861 Thomas Edison.

333
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:46,040
And I'm like I don't remember being how it opened.

334
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:49,040
And this is you as a child this is who you liked.

335
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:52,040
It's a theme park for children.

336
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,040
For children.

337
00:20:53,040 --> 00:21:00,040
But this alleyway was for mom and dad and the grandparents Alfred Hitchcock at the one end and Angela Lamsbury at the other.

338
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,040
You know.

339
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:09,040
It's truly it's truly a bygone era and I almost want to say like you know like to anybody at Universal who's currently listening to this.

340
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:19,040
No I'm because like so my mom was visiting six months ago and she was like oh you know she knows she remembers she was like oh you love Universal.

341
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:26,040
I'm like did but she was like oh we'll go to Universal and then I was and then I was going through like what they currently got.

342
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:29,040
We were going to Universal Hollywood it's obviously different.

343
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:34,040
And then I realized I'm like well it's just a lot of herky jerky you know rollercoaster.

344
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:39,040
So we end up going to Disneyland because I was like there's just not a lot my mom could like do.

345
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,040
Yeah.

346
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:50,040
And then we ended up not doing it like because it was like well they can't really do the whole family much now because you the idea was that you were like you would do Jaws Back to the Future King Kong the Ghostbusters show.

347
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:58,040
And then you'd then you'd be like all right here's old Hitchcock he's gonna you know here's you know Shirley MacLaine she's gonna remember old hitch.

348
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:05,040
And you know and then you do the Mervishing Rose and it took seven minutes you could sit down in the cool like I just feel like there was.

349
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:13,040
And the tour is probably giving you a lot more that you know they're stressing more that like and this is where Music Man or Bye Bye Birdie was felt like they're reaching.

350
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:24,040
Now I think you go at the furthest back anything is there's psycho because it's just perennial classic but otherwise it's like Back to the Future is now like a classic film that's as old as they're.

351
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,040
That's as close as they bring up.

352
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:33,040
They're even mentioning it like I mean they'll mention it because it's like the Clock Tower is on the tour but like is it I don't even know if it's on the I haven't done the tour in a while but.

353
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,040
Kind of depends on what's filming.

354
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,040
Basically yeah exactly so.

355
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,040
Not a lot right now.

356
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,040
Well.

357
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:47,040
Yeah now you just I mean like they if I would like to if I was a tour guide now I might just break down and go like and recently we've been filming.

358
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:50,040
Look it's all in Atlanta okay.

359
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,040
We got nothing.

360
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,040
Nothing happens here all right.

361
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,040
We're doing the voice again.

362
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:56,040
The actors are on strike so we're.

363
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,040
Heroes.

364
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:02,040
We might be shooting like Hot Bench here or something some judge show but that's about it.

365
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,040
We can't take you in there.

366
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,040
The voice.

367
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:08,040
Oh look it's the sound stage and it has the voice set in it.

368
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:13,040
It has the voice and it's the voice for now until we bulldoze it to make more Nintendo.

369
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,040
Yes.

370
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,040
Probably.

371
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:20,040
But that was kind of the thing where you know you have.

372
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:30,040
You know you'd have these sort of attractions for everybody and I'm not trying to be like well you know don't chase the youth but I think that's sort of one of those things where it's like I don't know what like.

373
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:36,040
Your grandparents like if your grandparents were going to like take a kid to the universal park now.

374
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,040
Yeah.

375
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:40,040
Like I mean maybe they they probably just have to go on all the kids stuff.

376
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,040
Right.

377
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:46,040
Not to talk like you know Walt at the festival but like what could the parents do.

378
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:49,040
But it's kind of a little bit of that.

379
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,040
Like I think there was so much of a purge of that.

380
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,040
Well isn't both.

381
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:55,040
OK it's not.

382
00:23:55,040 --> 00:24:05,040
Not to jump ahead but I believe I believe murders this murder she wrote attraction in Florida and the equivalent which is the like Foley stage and how we make sound effects.

383
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:09,040
The version of that in Hollywood both replaced by Transformers the ride.

384
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:21,040
So both of the like sit down process oriented these kind of like these these pleasant for everybody attractions replaced by one that like isn't quite for everybody.

385
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,040
Correct.

386
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,040
Well I mean why don't what Mike what you think.

387
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,040
Yeah I know.

388
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:31,040
Thanks for covering my well I will say that yes to transformable fuck you up but then it will break your heart.

389
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,040
Yes.

390
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:40,040
So so grandparents should endure the potential physical trauma in order to get to that because if like do you want to weep.

391
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,040
Do you want to.

392
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:45,040
And probably like the feelings of your whole life are coming to you in that Optimus Prime.

393
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:53,040
Yeah I mean I actually made my mom go on this a couple of years ago because I was like remember you love this Spider-Man ride when we went on in 2000 and she's like OK.

394
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,040
She did like it.

395
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,040
She remembers that.

396
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,040
And she went on and she hated it.

397
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,040
She was really upset by it.

398
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:01,040
Did she just know did she just hate it because it's worse than Spider-Man.

399
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,040
Was that what fed into it.

400
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:05,040
In arguably worse than Spider-Man.

401
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,040
That might have been it.

402
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:08,040
I would be honest if that was why.

403
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:14,040
But I believe that your tolerance for getting jerked around changed in 20 years.

404
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,040
Yeah.

405
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,040
It's kind of one of my things.

406
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:22,040
And I think you know you've said this Mike on several occasions where I'm like I'm just trying to stay fit so I can do these rides.

407
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,040
Yes.

408
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,040
As long as I can.

409
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,040
Yeah.

410
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,040
Yeah.

411
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:45,040
I'm like that's truly like I'm like because I'm seeing myself being like OK because my husband is like starting to tap out on some things where I'm just doing and I'm like great single rider line like not like sort of keeping the existential dread from my head every time he says something that he's like you know I think it might be done with Space Mountain.

412
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:56,040
I'm like cool I'll do a single rider then that's cool you just have a churro right here in this you know this Tomorrowland dump you know and then I'll just just go over here.

413
00:25:56,040 --> 00:26:01,040
You're asserting that like you being done with Space Mountain does not make me be done with Space Mountain.

414
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,040
I'm not accepting my mortality.

415
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,040
This is not a marriage decision.

416
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,040
Yeah.

417
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:12,040
I will I will probably go through years of like secret pain before I like before I admit like I can't do Space Mountain anymore.

418
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,040
I think that's good though.

419
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,040
Yeah.

420
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,040
I think that's what I'm going to do too.

421
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:18,040
I think that's like that's a good that's like a will to live.

422
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:26,040
That's what I feel like it is the trade off is the joy you're robbed of like that's like what I would be robbed of that joy.

423
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,040
Yeah.

424
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:29,040
That would be of life would define.

425
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:34,040
And you can appreciate the landscape thing and the place making more.

426
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,040
This is going to willingly tap out.

427
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:51,040
I you guys knew I had family visiting and I think my my main tap outs were my brother went on the mummy and I'm like I don't do the mummy out here the last time I did it when it comes to the dead stop I got like slammed into the seat.

428
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,040
Fair.

429
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,040
That's fine.

430
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:56,040
My dad and brother were like we're going on the Matterhorn.

431
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,040
I'm like God speed.

432
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,040
I couldn't do that at 20.

433
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,040
Like I really like yeah yeah yeah.

434
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:12,040
I think then I was like a laughing at like my dad sure enough I met up with them afterwards he was like yeah I don't know everyone.

435
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:19,040
It's a room full of quitters here and so sad disappointing because like the Matterhorn hurts but it makes you feel alive.

436
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,040
So you have to go on it sometimes.

437
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:30,040
I'm not saying every time the other things make you feel that's not the only thing that makes you feel like one of the top 10 things that make you feel alive on this planet.

438
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:36,040
So did eating a very cold Mickey bar in the Plaza restaurant.

439
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:41,040
I don't like because you and I could go pretty hard together for a long day and I don't like hearing this from him.

440
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:43,040
I also thought it was interesting.

441
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,040
It's a hard thing to accept.

442
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:54,040
What Jason just said I was almost like meant to be followed by like a big applause or like you won the rap battle like cold Mickey bar in the plaza.

443
00:27:54,040 --> 00:28:02,040
Probably not Tiffany chandeliers but in the style.

444
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:04,040
I know people at home are like going I agree.

445
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,040
Yeah absolutely.

446
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,040
You got some O's there.

447
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,040
Yeah.

448
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:15,040
September late September heat wave in Southern California that air conditioning strong.

449
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,040
Was it there?

450
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,040
It's been pretty cool lately.

451
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,040
It was hot.

452
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:26,040
It's any day I was at the size maybe the one day but like the day we were at first it was so hot it was so crowded.

453
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,040
It's kind of just a hot plate.

454
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,040
Yeah.

455
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,040
It's a hot planet.

456
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,040
Yeah.

457
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,040
Yeah.

458
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,040
All of it.

459
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:36,040
And California adventure like too.

460
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:41,040
Not the most certain parts of the most shape but that's San Francisco.

461
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:44,040
Man they're still figuring out the restaurant order.

462
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,040
That was brutal.

463
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:51,040
This is definitely the future of this podcast is definitely Jason going like oh but the heat.

464
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,040
Oh yeah.

465
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,040
The heat.

466
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,040
Well because the next five years.

467
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:57,040
I can barely enjoy the bench.

468
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,040
My agony is.

469
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:06,040
Because the next five years of like at least Disney is going to be like just restaurant development.

470
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:15,040
So it's going to be a lot of like all right well they're going to have to it's going to be pretty focused on that which you know better than no I think that I'm there's there's some restaurants that I'm like OK you could ask.

471
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,040
Sure.

472
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,040
You could add some more there.

473
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:23,040
There's some there's some stuff to balance out but yeah you do have to figure out the ordering can get a little chaotic.

474
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,040
Yeah.

475
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:29,040
Tiana's palace and San Francisco were like just slammed.

476
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:39,040
But then I'm sure that once that food arrived once that Instagrammable food arrived that it was some of the finest food you've ever consumed.

477
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,040
That was alright.

478
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,040
OK.

479
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,040
Yeah.

480
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:52,040
And it's and that's it's not like it's not going to get any better than that's all right because we know how these things are like they're they're they're watching these places for the first month.

481
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,040
Yeah.

482
00:29:53,040 --> 00:30:00,040
And then we maybe our little ant man food starts to get a little less manicured a little less detail oriented.

483
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,040
Yeah.

484
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:11,040
So yeah my husband and I loved the Pym test kitchen and we just noticed we've like gone back we like went back a year later we were like this is not so Pym.

485
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:15,040
Mr. Pym's hands are not all over these items.

486
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,040
Get all normal.

487
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,040
Yeah.

488
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:21,040
Too busy fighting crime to focus on his kitchen.

489
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:25,040
Don't open a restaurant if you're not going to be there every day Pym.

490
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,040
Mr. Pym.

491
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:31,040
Jurassic Cafe and I was like oh we should go back to Jurassic Cafe.

492
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:34,040
Had a pretty good meal there at the open like around the time.

493
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:37,040
We've been saying you've been nuts about that one for years.

494
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,040
I have been nuts.

495
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:40,040
And the Jurassic Cafe is a good restaurant.

496
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:45,040
Getting rice and beans and mollo pork and arepas.

497
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:54,040
And this time it was the pork shredded pork dumped on a massive plate of rice and then handed to you.

498
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:57,040
I can't I'm I'm dial back dial back.

499
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:00,040
I'm surprised that you're surprised that the Jurassic Cafe is not of.

500
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,040
Oh I don't.

501
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:05,040
I was just it was just so crowded.

502
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:10,040
Look serves me right for me once and again and again shave on me.

503
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:16,040
I think as the restaurant sort of like sort of normalize out and you know maybe kind of do so.

504
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:20,040
So the snack carts are the ones that like always like deliver for me 10 times.

505
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,040
Oh sure.

506
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:29,040
I think the little cosmic eats outside of Guardians Tower always delivers with the like purple custard orb thing.

507
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,040
I always get that.

508
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,040
Oh I've never done it.

509
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,040
That's a dessert thing.

510
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,040
It's a dessert thing.

511
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:38,040
It's a little cards a little trolley just outside the tower and it's dumb getting the name wrong cosmic orb.

512
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,040
It's something like that.

513
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:41,040
It's like a giant cream puff.

514
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:47,040
Giant cream puff and inside is like really really really cold purple custard.

515
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:49,040
Was that all shade for Mike?

516
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,040
You don't know that's OK.

517
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,040
Oh no I said that's OK.

518
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,040
You don't know the name.

519
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,040
Oh OK.

520
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:58,040
I was like I went on here being like damn it a year ago I would have known.

521
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:06,040
I'm sure people out there are yelling with the name of the thing but nobody's had these orbs.

522
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,040
I have not had the orb.

523
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:09,040
No I had the orb once.

524
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,040
Yeah it was pretty good.

525
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:16,040
I'd say like yeah if you're in Avengers campus I would say like the shawarma and the orbs like just delivered 10 times.

526
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,040
The shawarma is good yeah.

527
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,040
Are they keeping up the shawarma?

528
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:21,040
I haven't had it recently but the last time I had it was good.

529
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,040
And then of course Ronto wrap is still good.

530
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:27,040
I think that's another like kind of short order thing where they do one thing.

531
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,040
Yes.

532
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,040
And they just pow pow pow pow pow.

533
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,040
Yeah.

534
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,040
They got a really limit.

535
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:35,040
It's got to be like original McDonald's as portrayed in the founder.

536
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:38,040
We do burgers and we do fries and let's not get too much more complicated.

537
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:41,040
No gumbo at Ronto's Roasters.

538
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,040
No please don't.

539
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:46,040
No matter what space gumbo name they come up with.

540
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,040
That does sound good.

541
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,040
Yeah yeah.

542
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,040
But it belongs in the hanger or whatever seven not the other one.

543
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:53,040
Let's okay back to Murder She Wrote a little bit.

544
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:59,040
Forsythe's introduction let you know that this is they're putting a couple of things together.

545
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:10,040
It's a kind of it's a making of Murder She Wrote experience but this is also the attraction in original Florida that is representing the post production process.

546
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:17,040
So the rooms are editing Foley and then sound mixing.

547
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,040
Like ADR.

548
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,040
ADR.

549
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:30,040
Yes because I was going to say that sounds very very dry but what that actually becomes is now people from the audience have to live do lines of these actors over the dial.

550
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,040
And it's a gag every time.

551
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:41,040
I'm telling you like I'm watching these and I found some other like just very poorly camcorder shot stuff and even then the comedy just bled through the screen to me.

552
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:47,040
I did this I went through this attraction twice as I was like I was thinking I was like nine.

553
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,040
Yeah my family did this.

554
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:59,040
I don't know what it is with like Illinois and driving to Orlando but we did we were like Aurora Illinois to like Orlando was like the thing to do.

555
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,040
I don't know what we were saying.

556
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,040
How many hours are you talking?

557
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,040
22?

558
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:05,040
From Schaumburg it's like 20 or 22 hours.

559
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,040
Yeah essentially.

560
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,040
Are we stopping?

561
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,040
Yeah.

562
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,040
Where are we stopping if we're stopping?

563
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,040
We stopped at like.

564
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,040
Tennessee?

565
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,040
Georgia.

566
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:16,040
We were always like I remember we always stopped at like once I started seeing I remember getting excited.

567
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:22,040
I remember getting excited to see Waffle Houses because then whenever we hit the Waffle House I was like we're close we're close we're close we're close.

568
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:24,040
Get me out of this car.

569
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:32,040
So like we were not just like so it was like me my brother my parents and my brother was littler and so like but we drove like with my aunt as well.

570
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:37,040
Like so she it was a really like they feel like they just don't do family vacations like this.

571
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,040
Hopefully people fly.

572
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:47,040
But yeah there I remember like specifically we went down and I just saw my aunt on the book tour and I was telling her that I was going to be talking about the murder she wrote show.

573
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,040
Oh wow.

574
00:34:48,040 --> 00:35:07,040
And she was like oh my god I can't believe it because she so this was this long ago like she got like so she came down with us and like we were literally like so young and little that like in the car this is like an old station wagon like she was in the back seat and like my brother and I were like in the wheel wells of the car basically like sleeping.

575
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:18,040
And we were like so like a cat down there and it was being like so like hilarious at the time but now I'm just like that didn't need to happen.

576
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,040
Didn't need to happen.

577
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:31,040
But then yeah but then as soon as we hit Universal Orlando which I had been like you know psyching myself up for because it had like back to the future I'm a super back to the future guy my dog's name is Marty.

578
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:47,040
And that is like I remember just being so keyed up by the time we got in there and I didn't know I didn't I didn't watch murder she wrote really like I had seen like a few episodes with like my grandma I didn't really it didn't really pop out but I known Angela Lansbury from Bedknobs and Broomsticks.

579
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:53,040
And I think at the time yeah Beauty and the Beast was out.

580
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,040
Oh sure.

581
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:57,040
Just those that's huge for kids.

582
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,040
She's a legend at that time already.

583
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:13,040
Oh my god yeah and so like and so I did it like twice like I think we went two days in a row and my parents were both just like oh great well we did that I don't know if we need to go a second time the second day and I was like oh no we must go again.

584
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:16,040
I had to really learn the process of this.

585
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:18,040
Yeah take notes about the post-production.

586
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,040
I did I did.

587
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:23,040
So it's a longer show 25 minute show.

588
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:29,040
Yeah I feel like theme park shows they try to keep on the shorter side nowadays.

589
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:48,040
It was so I so I when I was catching up on this I caught up on this and the MGM studio sort of analog which was at the time monster sound show with Martin Short and Toby Chase and they did all three like at the same time and I remember like I remember the video that like they were rushing

590
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,040
for like nine minutes.

591
00:36:49,040 --> 00:37:00,040
So you're not because you aren't you aren't moving it's all in that's all in one theater as opposed to this where you get what you get like a mini show and one exactly and you move you move all the way down to the end of the row all the way to fill in every

592
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:15,040
you do it again which like I feel like just just the having to move spices it up and give some energy to them and that you like that one host isn't sweating it for the full 25 solid for 10.

593
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,040
I'm excited.

594
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,040
Yeah.

595
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:24,040
These are three actors a day who got to do like a real meal.

596
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,040
Yeah.

597
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:28,040
Orlando improv actors are eating.

598
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:34,040
This was that's very exciting would think at the at the time here to maybe introduce it a little further.

599
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,040
I got one more.

600
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:57,040
You're right that it's hard to find really good quality of this thing where you're dealing with a lot of camcorder but you're helped out by the John Forsyth video and you're also helped out by the 1990 Universal Studios Florida electronic press kit which gives you full frame footage of the show but also have a little bit of Angela Lansbury introducing it herself.

601
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:00,040
Here and she explains some of the premise.

602
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:05,040
I am so delighted that you've agreed to help out and become our executive producer.

603
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:15,040
You know it takes more than 200 people to make a single episode of murder she wrote and of course the executive producer is responsible for absolutely everything.

604
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:43,040
Which that statement is it is it is either totally true or the executive producer literally never is goes to the set or is part of one meeting or it's the worst scumbags in Southern California or that or just like the celebrity who they needed to sell they needed their name on to sell the show and they would not begin to have time to participate in either it's it's already on Larry Sanders who's the executive producer.

605
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:49,040
It's it's already on Larry Sanders is doing it's all on his back or they don't ever show up at all.

606
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:56,040
I'm so happy you played that I've been like literally was like my whole body just like yeah I was like so rocking out.

607
00:38:56,040 --> 00:39:10,040
But like it is because it is like it's perfect that like we're executive producers us the tourists in the audience because for some EPS you might as well be like just some tourists from Aurora Illinois like for as much as involved as you were.

608
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:13,040
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah열 Oh thank you you're you know Reading.

609
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:32,040
It's good like that's why I came back like on the second day I was like I was like no Angela requested me I'm her executive producer I need to check in make sure the show's still going okay yeah maybe the new person maybe the new people aren't as like effective as I was nine years old you know at producing this show.

610
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:40,040
Yeah yeah I'm on a tight leash and it really is funny that like the transformer stage is in there because it gives me the same rush as like Optimus because she's like.

611
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:48,040
I'm so delighted you're going to be my executive producer I'm like I will executive produce this show anytime thank you so much I had such a great time.

612
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:56,040
I'm comfortable is everything I can't believe we had to do a satellite uplink again.

613
00:39:56,040 --> 00:40:13,040
I was like thank you so much for being in again yeah I know I'm telling you like this or there's there's something to this realm this this epicenter of universal Orlando where it's like the good vibes are there like the sort of like affirming the cell right right right is there your bravery has saved the show.

614
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:16,040
Well done executive producers.

615
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:30,040
Yes it filled me with that much love and watery eyed joy and that is why I dragged everybody back again to learn Foley again and ADR again.

616
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:35,040
Your family is still like that's something called Foley invented by Jack Foley.

617
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:39,040
They go my god there are rides here.

618
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:43,040
Yeah my brother is just like jaws jaws jaws he said we're going to do jaws.

619
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:51,040
I was like yeah but like you know I'm just going to check earlier in the day make sure she's okay make sure she's got everything she needs.

620
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:57,040
Nice fruit basket in the dressing room everything that's here liking do we like bananas are we off bananas right now.

621
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:04,040
I was thinking that like old school universal wait times chalkboard just get higher and higher with wait times on back to the future jaws.

622
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:09,040
You emerged from the second helping of Mercheroad.

623
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,040
I was like no that's first.

624
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,040
Oh 80 minutes for jaws huh.

625
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:17,040
It's right there when you walk in may as well start the day there.

626
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:31,040
This is a cycle with my brother that would repeat because like they would like from like as time went on I would like leave him at some place that was sort of like kid appropriate and cool and then I would go do some like mature woman thing.

627
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:44,040
Like so it was like it would be like so I remember vividly going to the I was like my mom was like take your brother to go see D3 the mighty ducks and I was like sure and I left him there and I went across the theater and I saw the first wives club.

628
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:54,040
I had a great time and she was mad that I would leave him there because he added me out but yeah.

629
00:41:54,040 --> 00:42:07,040
Let me bring up something not to veer away from Florida but while we're talking murder she wrote in the universal theme park world something that would have brought together your and your brother's interests.

630
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:28,040
On the universal tram tour which I did jaws as mentioned and murder she wrote live together because you do the jaws experience you're in New England what's called Amity Island at the top of it and then you're veering your way out of there and you're still in the little pleasant New England vibe.

631
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:41,040
And you as a tour guide if I've now played my clip about because you got a long path out of there you really got to like fill it and they give you the clips to fill it so one is about how the shark the shark the shark is not working.

632
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:45,040
I repeat their shark is not working you get a shy.

633
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,040
And hit.

634
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:47,040
What's that.

635
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,040
Serotonin hit just now.

636
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,040
Oh good.

637
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,040
Yeah.

638
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:51,040
Yeah.

639
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:54,040
Richard Dreyfuss impersonating an intercom.

640
00:42:54,040 --> 00:43:22,620
But then then is the part where you get to say but you know some less scary stuff happen around here because this same location was the town of Cabot Cove on murder she wrote and I that was a part that I look forward to doing as a tour guide because like you've done your scary stuff you've heard your you've heard your John Williams jaws score and then so it's maybe the audience is a little like freaked out or they're just like energized amped up and then you get to give them a little pleasant little bit of a

641
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:44,040
I get to like get calm as they get calm and it would it wouldn't make anyone laugh that's not a laugh moment that jaws and murder she wrote of the same area but it but like calm smiles from everybody in that trance I really liked watching the wave of people like all murders well that's nice that's nice and one of the top five TV show things that you've heard about.

642
00:43:44,040 --> 00:44:03,040
Like the murder song is pretty untouchable it's a banger I don't skip it I never skip I never skip a very calm song to call a banger it's a yes sure it bangers can be what's your top what's everyone's top five real quick greatest American hero oh god I don't know if I'm gonna do all five but I'm sure we're gonna do all five.

643
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:23,340
Say your definitive list now I'm going cheers is number one I think yeah start to track the next generation is number two. Yeah taxi. Taxi's a pretty good theme yeah. I'm a twin piece person so it'd be the twin piece theme. That's really good. Very good. I'm gonna go with the

644
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:38,140
There's a show nobody knows called give me a break with Nell Carter and that had two theme songs the first one's kind of inessential but the second one is done by Jay Graydon my favorite studio musician Steely Dangai look up the song greatest song so the second give me a break song.

645
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:57,940
Every other sitcom in the 1980s was called give me a break at some point. Every network had one. So this is give me a break ABC okay I want give me a give me a break CBS. Yeah I had a lot of respect for Murder She Wrote as a kid because I knew that was my grandparents' name.

646
00:44:57,940 --> 00:45:13,940
favorite that Matlock yeah and I like the theme song and I would kind of have watched these shows. What's that? Saying you have respect for the funny way to put it. It is like a like I respect my elders kind of show it. Yeah the shows radiates with the goodness that's in the

647
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:29,940
that's like not and it's not this like oh the way things were sort of Reaganite with fake goodness where you're like oh yes this is evil underneath but like there's like an actual like it holds up she holds a fairly open minded views on everything and I think that's the thing that's really cool about this show.

648
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:46,940
like oh the way things were sort of Reaganite with fake goodness where you're like oh yes this is evil underneath but like there's like an actual like it holds up she she holds a fairly open minded views on everything like there's not like a lot of like her being like she helps everyone.

649
00:45:46,940 --> 00:46:14,940
helps everybody yeah I so I watched I was gonna watch the pilot and then jump ahead like five or six years because I think that's a decent way to see like how TV shows kind of change and stuff then I found out the pilots part it's a two parter oh yeah so I watched the second episode and I was really enjoying it until the very end the conclusion of the two part pilot is insane the solution.

650
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:44,940
it's the one with the pool lights yes the pool lights and the plot of the count of Monte Cristo comes into play heavily it's like she and she makes a lot of deductive like it's a lot of jump to conclusions where it's like you put that to get like like someone references the count of Monte Cristo to the killer and who's like a friend of hers which would be a recurring theme where it'd be like she'd have to because murder sure would end like one of two ways it would always be like a freeze frame and it would be like a freeze frame on her

651
00:46:44,940 --> 00:47:14,940
just laughing like and then they'd freeze and then they play the and it would be again huge serotonin hit but then like a third of the time it would be a sort of a grim ending where she'd have to arrest you know she was gonna have to aid in the arrest of of a beloved person or would be like a very unfortunate situation and then it would just be her sort of shaking her head solemnly and would freeze on that and there'd be sort of a long sting yeah and then the then the end credits but in that yeah this one is similar where you

652
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:44,940
like she nabs the guy because like he has a background that's sort of kind of Monte Cristo is yeah yeah and but then it does have a freeze frame at the on the train oh she did on the am track yeah she makes like Adam West Batman deductions sometimes where she draws just an insane conclusion that's absolutely correct and you're like well wait a minute it's like and gets there and like you just care about both of them so much you're just like yes sure

653
00:47:44,940 --> 00:48:05,780
she's a genius thing yeah it also it was reminding me watching it now it shares a lot with Colombo in that the star of the show is acting circles around everyone else doing the like yes well I work at the office you know like I'm doing kind of stiff TV acting though but

654
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:35,780
Colombo's full of fucking killer actors. So does Murdasheer wrote in Murdasheer. Correct. That's what Colombo has like John Cassavetes shows up Robert I guess I was gonna say Robert Colombo. Jason does Tom Bosley not mean anything to you? Well Bosley's not in the earlier episodes. Bosley's not. It takes it's so funny. Ned Beattie is in the pilot he's great. It's funny because like Murdasheer wrote is one of the like I talk about Murdasheer wrote the way a lot of people talk about shows now

655
00:48:35,780 --> 00:49:05,780
I'm like just hang on till episode 11 it's great like and you just like because the first 10 are just like rough and then they find their way but I would say once you hit season two that show just hits like season two and three hit everything is a hit and like it is this hit like so there is like so there's these sort of tiers where like obviously Angela Lansbury is just doing the circles then you have like a lot of just like just haven for bit parts but then you've also got a lot of

656
00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:35,780
like in Colombo where there's like a lot of all the guest star names are either young folks on their way up or like old folks kind of on their way like sort of out of retirement. Oh sure. And you'll get like there's like one episode in season two called Menace Anyone that is young Bryan Cranston and a young Linda Hamilton. And it's like the mashups are insane. Yeah. There's my favorite episode of all time is a season two one called Jessica Behind Bars. I've tweeted

657
00:49:35,780 --> 00:50:05,780
about this show kind of once a year because I'm just like begging you could watch it on its own. It's a bottle episode where she like does like a writing course at a women's prison and then like someone is murdered the prison and they go into lockdown and then like literally like the prisoners like riot and take over the prison. Whoa. And she has to solve the murder before like the National Guard comes in and wipes everyone out. They firebombed. No like then the like tonight on murder she wrote of this episode is 30 seconds.

658
00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:28,780
It's more exciting than die hard. You're like what? And it's like you're screaming at people and people screaming at her and the guest stars and it's like Adrian Barbeau, Yvonne DeCarlo and you've got oh my gosh Vera Miles from Psycho and like just name after name Eve Plum, Jan Brady. Yeah.

659
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:29,780
Wow. And she's like but she's rocking kind of like she's a prisoner. She's like yeah I'm a prisoner. And it's great. Yvonne's Eve Plum. Fuck. The audience is a whole pooting and hollering at Yvonne DeCarlo. Yvonne DeCarlo is like playing like the sort of like crooked chef. Like she's like the chef who's been like skimming and like like the meals are like cruel and unusual because she's been like selling off the menu to like better people. And she's like she's like she's like the chef.

660
00:50:58,780 --> 00:51:28,780
She's kind of like wrapped into it and she's kind of like crabby lunch lady. She's like yeah what are you going to do about it. Like it's great. I don't think I've ever seen a non Munster's performance from Yvonne DeCarlo. That's the thing. If you want to see Yvonne DeCarlo like outside of Munster's. Wow. Wow. She's freaking it. I might not recognize her. Yeah. Jessica behind bars season two. But like you'll have so you'll have these like these casts that are just so so great. And then actually speaking of that was where as we're recording this hopefully they are currently.

661
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:52,460
Somewhere in town negotiating sag after sag. Yeah. Hopefully soon. This is something that was that has kind of come to light a little bit more lately. Something that Angela Lansbury basically did for. She basically used murder she wrote as a way to ensure sort of aging or ailing actors and actresses to continue their sag benefits.

662
00:51:52,460 --> 00:51:53,420
Like so you see actors that you like. Oh I'm not the Cairo like or show up in one episode like because back then you do one episode of a big hit network show. Right. That would be enough to like extend your health benefits. That would be enough to like keep your house. That would be enough to like kind of keep you around. And it kind of became this open secret that like if you sort of were in the business and you kind of been around and you were in trouble. Find get word to Angela and she'd get you.

663
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:52,460
Just five lines on murder she ran so she kind of used this as a way to shuttle many many many older actors and actresses who had not worked in years decades maybe. I'm like welling up a little. It was so yeah that is beautiful. It was beautiful. No. So so she was something she actively did and I think this became a little bit more known after her passing. And which was just this last year she hung up for such a long time. It's an amazing person. But no the Drew Carey.

664
00:52:52,460 --> 00:53:06,220
I think I could be a little bit more active for time. Truly. She was doing Drew Carey level stuff where she like again but it was kind of a similar like no no thanks needed. Like she just kind of wanted like she 형 just had this immense power within the show and she was like great.

665
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:26,860
You know so and so to be in this thing you know and then there'd be like kind of more up and coming younger folks like there it would be a mix of like this young star Jessica Walter who was like the victim the killer and a suspect across like she played like.

666
00:53:26,860 --> 00:53:32,060
I love this about old shows like this where they would just come back and they'd a new character.

667
00:53:32,060 --> 00:53:45,820
Oh yeah. Robert Culp. A lot of Columbo. Culp was in so many Columbo. I just finished watching it because I had been such a murder she wrote person and I was like all right we'll give Columbo a shot and I got like so obsessed and then I was like Robert Culp again.

668
00:53:45,820 --> 00:54:04,940
Amazing. Different guy. Different guy. And that happens you see that on the law and orders a lot with New York actors or Broadway actors where they're like yeah there's a victim one season a murderer the next a lawyer the following season. Beautiful. Beautiful. And it's like hey they got health insurance.

669
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:20,340
Yeah. So I mean that's the thing. So like that. So as like. So what she would usually kind of do for some of her closer friends was they would be regular townspeople in Cabot Cove. So you'd be in like three or four episodes a season towards the end seasons eight through 12.

670
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:41,300
She leaves Cabot Cove and she moves to New York City and you can tell they start doing like the declining ratings. Let's change the music up thing. So they do like they hit that like early 90s saxophone every time they do like a scene change like they do this sort of saxophone like jazzy sexy sax version of the theme.

671
00:54:41,300 --> 00:55:10,260
And it's very jazzy. Watch night see it's very it's a little you're starting to get to that. They sort of get a little shaky. But in that time that's when like she had she kept a lot of folks you could tell. And there's a and there's a few actors who you can tell like have maybe maybe serious ailments. I think one actress had like survived a stroke. And but there is like a character who like is sort of like she runs a shop in town and she has like maybe two every time she goes to the mall.

672
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:26,460
And every time they do a Cabot Cove episode there's like she has three lines and they see her and like she goes out of her way to just say hello to her at a shop. And that's it. And that's all she does. And then got her like insured for like the rest of her days. And it was an amazing thing.

673
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:34,460
So this is this is an attraction starring a hero hero hero and more so than Optimus Prime even.

674
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:43,860
Well that's I put it to you. I put it to you. He might be good. I was probably might be getting health insurance for the other transform. Yeah we know about that.

675
00:55:44,260 --> 00:55:46,260
They're unionized. Yeah yeah the other.

676
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:49,260
Jessica Fletcher could find the all spark if it was Miss A.

677
00:55:49,260 --> 00:56:05,620
I she potentially could. And I and this is it's it's funny back back to the to the to the to the attraction here. There is I don't know how much you're able to like see through the thing but there is a sort of a what's it that they have to get in this.

678
00:56:06,380 --> 00:56:16,580
The black pearl. I have to admit it's a little confusing from camcorder. Yes but there. Yeah I mean this is a question I had for you in general is like the if knowing the show so well.

679
00:56:18,340 --> 00:56:26,420
How do you think. How well do you think they pulled off a mini mystery that has to work in this theme park show setting.

680
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:30,780
They had like great because they have like two and a half minutes of time. Not an hour.

681
00:56:30,940 --> 00:56:45,340
So what they did so they had like so like from what I can remember the plot of this is there's they're looking for the black pearl which is wild because when Pirates of the Caribbean the movie came out.

682
00:56:46,340 --> 00:56:57,980
I was such a like fan of this ride. They were like it's called the curse of the black pearl. I was like well I can't do that because the black pearls part of murder which has been gone for a decade.

683
00:56:58,180 --> 00:57:02,820
I was like well like I don't know like how do they like do they make a deal with like universal because like that's pretty famous.

684
00:57:02,820 --> 00:57:08,500
The black pearl from that from that show. Like no one major IP. The people I was with on the trip.

685
00:57:10,140 --> 00:57:16,780
So every time like I see the parents of the Caribbean or I see it like on you know flip through on Disney plus I'm always just like black pearls.

686
00:57:17,580 --> 00:57:18,380
Stolen.

687
00:57:18,380 --> 00:57:20,340
It's stolen. It's stolen.

688
00:57:20,340 --> 00:57:21,100
Acting like you guys.

689
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:21,460
Stolen.

690
00:57:21,460 --> 00:57:22,100
One MacGuffin.

691
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:24,740
Yeah it's.

692
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:37,580
She goes into this creaky haunted house which seemed to be like the thing both this and Monster Shannon show did where they were like person enters a spooky sort of manner and they kind of bump into creaky things.

693
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:41,740
Because we got a lot of opportunity. What this really is setting up is doing all of the foley.

694
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:56,420
And you know you could do the foley you know for a scene that's her talking to the shop owner but then you wouldn't have like the box that you tumble with all the junk in it or the howling wind or so.

695
00:57:56,420 --> 00:57:59,740
Or she that she bumps into a suit of armor.

696
00:57:59,740 --> 00:58:00,180
Yeah.

697
00:58:00,180 --> 00:58:00,980
So you.

698
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:01,420
Yeah.

699
00:58:01,420 --> 00:58:05,620
They clearly need to set up a scenario where all the foley gadgets.

700
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:10,780
Yeah there's like a Zoltar like fortune teller machine.

701
00:58:10,780 --> 00:58:11,620
In the house.

702
00:58:11,620 --> 00:58:21,820
Yeah it's in the house and like and they're never interacted with it's funny because like then she goes in and she's and then like there's people that she's clearly already interacted with.

703
00:58:21,820 --> 00:58:35,100
Because she was sort of arriving at that moment that's in the last final minutes of every episode where she's been around she kind of knows what everybody's situation is there's this sort of you know this beautiful alluring woman Leilani.

704
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:43,980
And they're all kind of on the hunt for this black pearl and someone has been murdered and the black pearl has been stolen and then there's this like nasty Dr.

705
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:46,460
Ashbrook or something and make his name is.

706
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:48,780
And then.

707
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:56,900
And then there's like the local sheriff character so it's pretty true to life and then it ends with.

708
00:58:57,260 --> 00:59:02,620
With like a big guest star gag in the form of Mr.

709
00:59:02,620 --> 00:59:05,500
Tom Selleck which it doesn't show up in the John Forsythe thing.

710
00:59:05,540 --> 00:59:06,100
OK yes.

711
00:59:06,140 --> 00:59:10,620
Now explain this to me because it was a little hard to parse the full full context thing.

712
00:59:10,620 --> 00:59:18,220
There is some joke made and we'll talk about like the hosts the like editors and all these characters.

713
00:59:18,220 --> 00:59:18,540
Yeah.

714
00:59:18,620 --> 00:59:24,860
Earlier in the thing there is a joke about what if we could put Tom Selleck in it.

715
00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:31,900
Because Tom Selleck being like the the go to for hunk at this time it seems to be the context.

716
00:59:32,340 --> 00:59:43,780
But then I honestly in watching the camcorder version couldn't tell when Selleck shows up is that footage for another thing or did they they shot custom Tom Selleck footage for this.

717
00:59:43,940 --> 00:59:44,300
Wow.

718
00:59:44,620 --> 00:59:47,340
To my understanding like it's not from an episode.

719
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:47,900
Wow.

720
00:59:48,580 --> 00:59:51,060
So why does he show up.

721
00:59:51,100 --> 01:00:02,540
Well in the editing sequence the editor is showing like here we have a shot of Jessica reaction reacting and there could be it changes based on what she's looking at.

722
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:05,180
So it cuts to a young couple making a kiss.

723
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:05,740
Yeah.

724
01:00:05,780 --> 01:00:06,580
Or a gun.

725
01:00:06,580 --> 01:00:07,020
A gun.

726
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:07,700
Or a gun.

727
01:00:07,860 --> 01:00:13,700
This is like a very like this is a very like film school kind of like your your little editing 101.

728
01:00:13,740 --> 01:00:19,180
They do that demonstration of like change the the significance of the shot by what they're looking at.

729
01:00:19,180 --> 01:00:20,740
So that's a that's a good little genuine.

730
01:00:21,260 --> 01:00:23,660
Communicating ideas with visual.

731
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:28,580
Like it's yeah by the time I got to film school and they were like it's called the Kuleshov effect.

732
01:00:28,620 --> 01:00:29,860
I was like I understand.

733
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:31,620
It's from the Murder She Wrote Show.

734
01:00:31,660 --> 01:00:32,660
Into the mystery theater.

735
01:00:32,700 --> 01:00:34,620
I was the executive producer for one episode.

736
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:38,300
I had a little film experience.

737
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:39,060
I'm a little above this.

738
01:00:39,060 --> 01:00:40,660
I have been an executive producer already.

739
01:00:41,300 --> 01:00:44,500
But one of those things is or you could get to Tom Selleck.

740
01:00:44,820 --> 01:00:45,900
They kind of swoon over.

741
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:48,020
So it's a callback at the very end of the show.

742
01:00:48,020 --> 01:00:49,540
So it's supposed to be just like a gag.

743
01:00:49,540 --> 01:00:50,660
It's not previous.

744
01:00:50,700 --> 01:00:56,380
It's not it's all it's just like oh we could do Tom Selleck and then she's interrupted by like you got to go to the next sound stage.

745
01:00:56,620 --> 01:01:00,860
So you don't see the shots you're to kind of just think like oh she's making a Tom Selleck reference.

746
01:01:00,940 --> 01:01:09,060
And then by the time you get to the end and you see everything pieced together when Tom Selleck shows up it's like oh they really got him.

747
01:01:10,020 --> 01:01:10,460
Wow.

748
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:13,540
And what what does he do.

749
01:01:13,580 --> 01:01:14,180
Why is he there.

750
01:01:14,220 --> 01:01:15,260
Is he a character.

751
01:01:15,260 --> 01:01:16,820
Is he because she's in a.

752
01:01:17,220 --> 01:01:17,460
OK.

753
01:01:17,460 --> 01:01:19,500
You're saying this is the end.

754
01:01:19,580 --> 01:01:22,660
I'm sorry I'm asking basic plot questions but boy is the footage not great.

755
01:01:22,740 --> 01:01:28,660
I feel like this is I feel like this was so lost in the burning of the Library of Alexandria.

756
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:33,940
But like this is like I'm like the one surviving person who recalls this ride.

757
01:01:34,020 --> 01:01:39,020
Yes who was a child who went and because other kids were there of your age then.

758
01:01:39,260 --> 01:01:43,620
But maybe it didn't like your brother didn't land but it land you remember.

759
01:01:43,660 --> 01:01:50,540
I'm there I was in it I absorbed it I chose to let all of this information and I am the keeper of the information.

760
01:01:50,660 --> 01:01:56,060
Yeah there are not copy in the way that you can watch the whole Hitchcock show.

761
01:01:56,100 --> 01:02:00,020
You can see the wandering around the show area.

762
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:00,540
Real.

763
01:02:00,580 --> 01:02:00,820
Yeah.

764
01:02:01,100 --> 01:02:08,220
So this but it's that so you're in a she's it's essentially cutting straight to the end of an episode she's in a creaky she solves the mystery.

765
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:11,140
But then it's these characters established but then sell it.

766
01:02:11,820 --> 01:02:12,980
Why what is he.

767
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:22,660
So in a regular murder she wrote episode we kind of mentioned before like how sometimes there's like this little epilogue where she just then goes to meet a friend and it's a freeze frame laugh.

768
01:02:23,060 --> 01:02:29,260
And that's kind of what this is which is like she solved the mystery and she's like all right I'm expected somewhere.

769
01:02:29,580 --> 01:02:37,980
And then she goes to dinner and then in the new meetup with Tom Selleck who did show up on the show because she did a crossover two parter with Magnum P.

770
01:02:37,980 --> 01:02:38,260
I.

771
01:02:39,220 --> 01:02:41,780
Which in which Jessica Walter was on it.

772
01:02:41,860 --> 01:02:42,420
Wow.

773
01:02:42,460 --> 01:02:44,740
So this was so there is a Magnum P.

774
01:02:44,740 --> 01:02:48,980
I were she's in it and then there's a murder she wrote where he's in it.

775
01:02:49,060 --> 01:02:51,060
Oh so the universes have tied together this.

776
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:52,820
I had to like hunt down Magnum P.

777
01:02:52,820 --> 01:02:55,620
I to like understand the first half of this episode.

778
01:02:55,940 --> 01:02:56,580
Oh yeah.

779
01:02:56,980 --> 01:03:03,060
I was like I was like I had a good time with it but I was like I'm not it's not he's not one of my guys.

780
01:03:03,140 --> 01:03:08,100
So like I was like a little bit like well let's just get to the her stuff.

781
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:22,780
While we're talking plot the Black Pearl thing is ultimately solved in this pretty silly way where she's after the Black Pearl and then the Black Pearl is discovered inside a baseball.

782
01:03:22,940 --> 01:03:23,180
Yeah.

783
01:03:23,580 --> 01:03:24,700
Peels apart like.

784
01:03:25,580 --> 01:03:25,740
Yeah.

785
01:03:25,780 --> 01:03:26,300
Yeah.

786
01:03:26,420 --> 01:03:30,540
And then everyone's like oh my god it's the Black Pearl and she goes is it.

787
01:03:30,700 --> 01:03:32,540
And then she drops it it shatters.

788
01:03:32,860 --> 01:03:35,860
Oh and it's a fake out fake Black Pearl.

789
01:03:36,460 --> 01:03:40,180
And whoever the real killer is has the real pearl on them.

790
01:03:40,340 --> 01:03:54,580
Oh they have they from the farthest reaches of my memory they did not set up like why it was important that we then have a fake because they never there's no proceeding stuff like there's no set up.

791
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:56,460
What's the Black Pearl also.

792
01:03:56,540 --> 01:03:58,900
It's just a big black pearl.

793
01:03:59,180 --> 01:03:59,620
Yeah.

794
01:04:00,220 --> 01:04:00,860
It's a gem.

795
01:04:00,860 --> 01:04:04,900
It's just something that somebody wants it's not like the proof that somebody did something.

796
01:04:04,940 --> 01:04:06,340
No no no it's like a Maltese Falcon.

797
01:04:06,380 --> 01:04:10,220
It's a yeah yeah it's like a little just thing the dreams are made of.

798
01:04:10,260 --> 01:04:19,260
Yeah it's a McLaughlin and it's like yeah which I feel like that that also is one of the most famous like throw it on the ground and shatters and you know it's fake.

799
01:04:19,300 --> 01:04:19,900
It's a yeah.

800
01:04:20,060 --> 01:04:20,340
Yeah.

801
01:04:20,500 --> 01:04:33,020
So they also did that because they needed another with the real reason they did because they needed another thing to Foley and they needed something else to happen for the ADR moment to happen later because all the characters sort of react to it.

802
01:04:33,260 --> 01:04:33,620
Oh yeah.

803
01:04:34,020 --> 01:04:36,380
Shattering and it's very like upsetting to a lot of people.

804
01:04:36,420 --> 01:04:37,180
Sure sure sure.

805
01:04:38,380 --> 01:04:38,660
OK.

806
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:42,260
So like also just functional stuff in the show.

807
01:04:42,540 --> 01:04:44,420
Let's just like room by room in a little bit.

808
01:04:44,540 --> 01:04:44,740
Yes.

809
01:04:45,700 --> 01:04:46,180
Editing.

810
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:47,580
Editing is stretched.

811
01:04:47,620 --> 01:04:50,660
You get the little demonstration of like what reaction shots could do.

812
01:04:50,700 --> 01:05:05,740
You also get this kind of odd really specific of its time that like they didn't put the powder on the shoe so we can paint we can use our digital machine to put and you're like what what could this possibly have been what proto CGI.

813
01:05:06,100 --> 01:05:07,620
It's like MS Paint probably.

814
01:05:07,660 --> 01:05:07,940
Yeah.

815
01:05:08,020 --> 01:05:09,780
Like it's something very simple.

816
01:05:10,780 --> 01:05:27,700
What you get what unites all of the stages I would say is that they all the actors and all of them make the choice that post production people are all kind of bitter and kind of Brooklyn.

817
01:05:28,220 --> 01:05:30,540
They're working class Brooklyn people.

818
01:05:30,620 --> 01:05:37,740
This feels like the origin of the Universal Studios New Yorker which is like the very famous the street folk.

819
01:05:37,780 --> 01:05:38,060
Yeah.

820
01:05:38,380 --> 01:05:40,420
They're all kind of doing this.

821
01:05:40,460 --> 01:05:41,140
Come on.

822
01:05:41,180 --> 01:05:41,900
Like there's a lot.

823
01:05:41,940 --> 01:05:42,700
Yeah there's a lot.

824
01:05:43,260 --> 01:05:46,500
They're they're doing the thing which is like they need you to hurry up.

825
01:05:46,940 --> 01:05:47,820
Hurry up get in.

826
01:05:47,860 --> 01:05:49,380
Like you know so there's not a lot of sweet stuff.

827
01:05:49,380 --> 01:05:50,540
They're kind of like hurry up get in.

828
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:54,700
It's also something that like a lot of performers can do quite easily.

829
01:05:54,740 --> 01:05:58,180
It's not an it's not a you can kind of just kind of usher folks.

830
01:05:58,700 --> 01:06:02,140
Like some like thin slurry like you're from Finland.

831
01:06:02,340 --> 01:06:03,980
What's a really specific dialect.

832
01:06:04,020 --> 01:06:04,900
It's not very specific.

833
01:06:05,540 --> 01:06:07,060
It allows someone to make a choice.

834
01:06:07,100 --> 01:06:08,020
It's nice and broad.

835
01:06:08,420 --> 01:06:20,060
And I think the thing that was kind of cool for you know me who was like kind of like I had done Disney so much and then I did the sort of step up into Universal which is sort of like you go from being a kid to being a preteen.

836
01:06:20,460 --> 01:06:29,580
And when you're a preteen and that's kind of what universal sort of is is this sort of like OK you've aged up a little bit from Disney and you're going to get these rides that are a little more intense.

837
01:06:29,900 --> 01:06:32,660
You're going to get sort of humor that's a little more.

838
01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:35,060
Oh wow.

839
01:06:35,100 --> 01:06:35,780
He said that.

840
01:06:36,380 --> 01:06:37,340
Knowledge violence.

841
01:06:37,380 --> 01:06:39,060
They acknowledge romance.

842
01:06:39,100 --> 01:06:40,020
If not sex.

843
01:06:40,100 --> 01:06:40,780
Right.

844
01:06:40,900 --> 01:06:42,100
It's a little body.

845
01:06:42,420 --> 01:06:43,220
It's a little body.

846
01:06:44,700 --> 01:06:45,260
Little.

847
01:06:46,420 --> 01:06:47,660
Like Jessica Fletcher.

848
01:06:47,820 --> 01:06:48,620
Jessica Fletcher.

849
01:06:48,660 --> 01:06:49,460
Big body.

850
01:06:50,260 --> 01:06:52,660
So Jessica Fletcher throughout the show.

851
01:06:52,700 --> 01:06:56,140
So when we meet her in the pilot she's lost her husband.

852
01:06:56,380 --> 01:07:10,060
She's like this widow who was a schoolteacher and then she just she wrote this book and then her nephew her grown nephew like reads it and then like submits it to a publisher without asking her.

853
01:07:10,420 --> 01:07:12,500
And they're like I think it's fabulous.

854
01:07:12,540 --> 01:07:13,780
Why don't you come down to New York City.

855
01:07:14,580 --> 01:07:16,620
And she's like always in over her.

856
01:07:16,660 --> 01:07:18,460
She's like oh I didn't want anyone to read that.

857
01:07:18,700 --> 01:07:25,900
So she's got this sort of like throughout she has many suitors throughout the run of the show.

858
01:07:26,180 --> 01:07:38,780
Some regular some one offs but she never goes further than like a little sort of dalliance a little like sort of anytime they get close enough she's just like oh I just wouldn't be right to Frank's memory.

859
01:07:38,900 --> 01:07:44,860
Like it was like it's a little they were very clear about where it would kind of begin and end.

860
01:07:45,780 --> 01:07:46,780
Always refuses to drink.

861
01:07:46,820 --> 01:07:49,820
She was very teetotaling but like not in a judgmental way.

862
01:07:50,340 --> 01:07:51,220
Well that's what you want.

863
01:07:51,260 --> 01:07:53,340
Yeah yeah it's not because you shouldn't either.

864
01:07:53,860 --> 01:07:58,300
She was just like oh you have whatever you have your third martini I will have a little sharing.

865
01:07:58,340 --> 01:07:59,580
That's like 60s Batman.

866
01:07:59,620 --> 01:08:01,220
He was the orange juice.

867
01:08:01,260 --> 01:08:02,020
No that's right.

868
01:08:03,860 --> 01:08:10,380
He does he is judgy though because in the movie there's that part like oh yeah there may be drinkers Robin but they are also people too.

869
01:08:13,540 --> 01:08:16,060
Well but you know hey I love that I love that.

870
01:08:17,020 --> 01:08:33,420
They all are very everybody is also very like frizzy hair and very big glasses like what I'll read to the back row is kind of like somebody in a like a nerdier profession is maybe what they're convinced somebody's in dark rooms a lot.

871
01:08:33,460 --> 01:08:37,020
So everybody they all look like MTV's Kennedy.

872
01:08:37,540 --> 01:08:57,900
I was going to I was I was saying like I think because this was happening across like literally across the street from Ghostbusters the show like everyone here is doing either Rick Moranis or Annie Potts from like they're doing like a Janine Malmas or they're doing a Louis Tully in visual form probably.

873
01:08:57,980 --> 01:09:03,860
And I guess they're a little bit of a green there too but yeah you know Rossi's they seem stressed.

874
01:09:04,620 --> 01:09:10,660
That the show isn't they need you young nine year old Adam Sasse to produce the show.

875
01:09:11,300 --> 01:09:27,780
They're a little this is irregular but you know it's not so uncommon I mean to like portray all put you know I'm an editor to some extent and I like to portray all post people as like you know the malcontent.

876
01:09:28,460 --> 01:09:45,780
You know like it is constantly stressed and peeved and like but it is there is kind of a truth to that like as the last step of the process that everything gets like piled on and like you know I'll start we're running out of money and you got to do it quick and fast now and like say you're going to get up a long hours and.

877
01:09:45,900 --> 01:09:47,700
It's a frenzied nature to it.

878
01:09:47,780 --> 01:10:00,500
Yeah yeah they aren't wrong about that and feeling like underappreciated maybe even more so at that time because editing was so clunky big old machine oh yeah like the boy slow and.

879
01:10:00,620 --> 01:10:01,700
And you had to do a lot of stuff.

880
01:10:02,780 --> 01:10:07,820
Live like I mean there was I mean I think at the end they make a reference to like I can't do a live.

881
01:10:08,340 --> 01:10:08,660
Next.

882
01:10:09,540 --> 01:10:10,580
I don't understand.

883
01:10:10,580 --> 01:10:33,260
Well I mean that is universal nonsense I think because that's all it's the same format as the Harry and the Henderson's thing which we talked about years ago on here but that the construct that like we're shipping this out to the network but the sound dropped out so we just have to so the actors have to go on it becomes Saturday Night Live for a second.

884
01:10:33,620 --> 01:10:34,300
Well you.

885
01:10:35,900 --> 01:10:41,860
But only like one scene only one act like in what world is that specific technical problem.

886
01:10:42,660 --> 01:10:51,540
They eventually cut that specific because there were too many like precocious 10 year olds in the crowd going like how would it did you made a tape do that.

887
01:10:53,020 --> 01:10:55,700
Explain exactly how that audio track goes away.

888
01:10:55,740 --> 01:11:01,420
But the videos fine how would it only be the video and not the audio why wouldn't you just like stop airing the show entirely.

889
01:11:01,660 --> 01:11:05,180
Why do we have Angela's dialogue but we don't have this other character.

890
01:11:06,100 --> 01:11:07,100
It's a stereo.

891
01:11:08,300 --> 01:11:09,100
Two tracks.

892
01:11:09,140 --> 01:11:14,140
I guess yeah they mixed everybody else on the right but that doesn't seem wise so I think you got a center at all.

893
01:11:15,660 --> 01:11:25,300
I mean but God bless it then becomes a perfect way yes to get like you know bad mom and dad actors to like miss their cues slightly.

894
01:11:26,260 --> 01:11:33,460
Did you guys ever do a version of this I bet we talked about this in special effects stages but it was a long time ago I don't remember.

895
01:11:34,540 --> 01:11:41,700
The like where you volunteered for that specific for I think kids could only do fully and I think kids are doing them the voice parts.

896
01:11:42,460 --> 01:11:46,220
My brother and I were perpetually like.

897
01:11:47,940 --> 01:11:53,420
Big brave kids not scared of nothing except when it was like hey why don't you be on superstar TV.

898
01:11:54,380 --> 01:12:02,100
Or how about you join in this then and then I was like I will disappear into this couch right now like I'm going to raise my hand down.

899
01:12:03,500 --> 01:12:03,780
Yeah.

900
01:12:05,020 --> 01:12:14,780
Don't have hands as far as your day I was driving to this like I was driving here and I was like I was getting the like the anxiety of like superstar TV or I was like.

901
01:12:15,860 --> 01:12:20,940
I'm just going to like go do this fake Gilligan's Islands episode I'm like get in there and I'm part of the show.

902
01:12:21,780 --> 01:12:23,300
That's how this feel being on podcast.

903
01:12:23,780 --> 01:12:28,780
That is a blank part where they it's pre recorded Mike Scott and Jason and then I say something.

904
01:12:30,060 --> 01:12:35,140
And you know you're like here's your home VHS tape like yeah we give you a copy.

905
01:12:35,300 --> 01:12:41,940
I'm going to tell you at the end this is not for public release we did this just for you I swear to God I would be fine with that.

906
01:12:41,940 --> 01:12:46,700
I would be like that's for everybody that's for everybody but like I this was just for me.

907
01:12:47,380 --> 01:12:53,580
You know what's interesting is I feel completely the same way I still have kind of a divide.

908
01:12:54,020 --> 01:13:02,740
Like I've lost nerves and that I can do this podcast I've been in a bunch of sketches and stuff and there's nothing that stresses me out about that.

909
01:13:03,100 --> 01:13:15,820
But anything that resembles broadcast action that like still and there's less of that in the world now but like the level of I get to be in several Conan sketches in front of the audience.

910
01:13:15,980 --> 01:13:26,060
And that is like fuck me you're fucking like yeah like like if you have one line it is scary it is so much scarier than this talking for hours.

911
01:13:26,500 --> 01:13:42,260
Like any construct of broadcast which I felt doing these shows were like a little red lights going to come on and they're saying it so fast and you're like wait but where and what if it doesn't and what and like everybody I'm going to fuck it up and everyone will the whole show will come to a stop and everyone will point and laugh at me.

912
01:13:42,700 --> 01:13:43,700
It's just different.

913
01:13:43,820 --> 01:13:45,140
Any things with this feel.

914
01:13:45,180 --> 01:13:58,940
There's also a slight addition to that that's that's that's a little that the nuance to this that also is more my fear because I've gotten up I've done book tours I've done where it's just me speaking I'm doing like Ted talks on this book and I've.

915
01:13:59,940 --> 01:14:09,780
Again like I've done a bunch of stuff like I should not be nervous about this I think I think the the specifically the theme park who wants to be who would like to be here.

916
01:14:10,340 --> 01:14:26,940
It's the act of you have to raise your hand everyone's going to see you raise your hand and if you if they pick that that person to the that other person then you have to like do that slow lowering of your hand and I go you didn't get picked there is something to that there is something that.

917
01:14:26,940 --> 01:14:40,180
Yeah like I threw my hat in the ring you put yourself out there myself out there again at nine was not doing in life I was only brave at the theme park not at my school or in my life but.

918
01:14:42,140 --> 01:14:45,300
I think you're three can relate but yes yes.

919
01:14:46,060 --> 01:14:46,620
Bravery.

920
01:14:47,860 --> 01:14:55,940
I'm like okay I'm like so I'm only brave here and I was like but there is an element of that where it's like you're putting yourself out there you throw your hat in the ring and.

921
01:14:56,660 --> 01:15:07,780
And it's like you weren't and then everyone saw it's the everyone saw everyone saw everyone knows but then but then that's all of course that's all made up nobody saw but you feel like everybody saw exactly yeah yeah.

922
01:15:08,140 --> 01:15:23,700
But that hey to that end if you came to the Vegas groove blender and I didn't pick you to come spin the wheel of my yeah and if that's how you felt you felt like everybody saw and you would like I don't look it was it was random so now I found this is a there's probably three people who I hope feel better now yeah.

923
01:15:24,580 --> 01:15:26,500
Blue 30 saw you but we didn't.

924
01:15:27,300 --> 01:15:27,900
He knows.

925
01:15:28,660 --> 01:15:31,700
He's so you put up the signal yeah you didn't get picked.

926
01:15:33,420 --> 01:15:35,300
What a big disappointment for you.

927
01:15:35,940 --> 01:15:45,180
You're you're all alone just farting root beer there is this sort of like little great kazoo that sort of lives on our shoulders that's like well that didn't go well.

928
01:15:46,660 --> 01:15:49,900
You tried and you thought you thought you could do something to me.

929
01:15:50,300 --> 01:15:58,780
Yes guess you're invisible maybe they didn't see you at all we should call you and they rejected you would not have worse that time.

930
01:15:59,260 --> 01:16:00,820
Nice try dumb dumb.

931
01:16:03,140 --> 01:16:06,740
Next time I should do us a favor and just keep your hand down.

932
01:16:07,740 --> 01:16:16,500
Don't go anywhere don't go in public anymore yeah I know that's this is that's absolutely all psychologically there and in this kind of thing.

933
01:16:16,940 --> 01:16:30,900
But then so they don't know what they're setting people up for the stress they're causing children but that you know and I feel like I have less to say about Foley Foley is like we've seen these Foley shows you turn the cranks and you back the big sheet with the wind.

934
01:16:31,420 --> 01:16:38,500
I feel like I'm maybe the most interested in stage three in this ADR zone.

935
01:16:39,060 --> 01:16:51,380
Yep and I maybe I'm saying that because the video that I watched that's on YouTube I am 90% sure that the person at that stage is Paula Pell.

936
01:16:52,380 --> 01:16:59,820
You mentioned when we were just DMing that this was yes this was an early role for Paula Pell.

937
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:10,620
Great longtime SNL writer star later of girls but also the she did a qui be which was a murder she wrote.

938
01:17:10,620 --> 01:17:11,820
Oh right.

939
01:17:11,820 --> 01:17:13,300
Maple worth.

940
01:17:13,300 --> 01:17:14,580
Maple worth.

941
01:17:14,580 --> 01:17:15,580
Maple worth.

942
01:17:15,580 --> 01:17:16,580
Maple worth maybe.

943
01:17:16,580 --> 01:17:17,580
Yes.

944
01:17:17,580 --> 01:17:24,860
So that's interesting that that like and I and I found that when she was doing press for that show and they're asking why murder she wrote what's the murder she wrote.

945
01:17:24,860 --> 01:17:32,380
Well one of my pre SNL I worked at the murder she wrote show and like lived this whole murder she wrote experience.

946
01:17:32,460 --> 01:17:40,580
Yeah yeah I think she was on like Seth Meyers or she was talking about like that she got the call to audition for SNL like from.

947
01:17:41,340 --> 01:17:44,220
Like from the murder she wrote.

948
01:17:44,220 --> 01:17:44,900
She was like wow.

949
01:17:44,900 --> 01:17:51,340
The middle of doing like oh right I wanted to get in here we need to go right here you you you over here over here you you you.

950
01:17:51,620 --> 01:17:53,100
And then like she's good at it.

951
01:17:53,100 --> 01:18:00,420
And she was yeah there is a it has to be her in this video because we did see it we were we were trying to find clips and not.

952
01:18:00,620 --> 01:18:06,580
Again this is no shade on the other performers who did that but like there was something about what she was doing.

953
01:18:07,300 --> 01:18:12,380
A first of all she wasn't doing a Brooklyn like she wasn't doing this sort of.

954
01:18:12,380 --> 01:18:12,860
Oh yeah.

955
01:18:12,860 --> 01:18:18,420
Everybody else was sort of doing like an impression of the Simpsons impression of John Travolta.

956
01:18:18,820 --> 01:18:26,140
They were all kind of do well yeah I should come over here like like no like there's a little Tony dance in there like that's a it's a it's a lot of things.

957
01:18:26,180 --> 01:18:30,140
Yeah I once but hers was like kind of just she's doing a polyp thing.

958
01:18:30,660 --> 01:18:30,860
Yeah.

959
01:18:30,860 --> 01:18:34,820
And like she's just confidently being like she's doing like frenzied.

960
01:18:35,020 --> 01:18:36,420
I read everybody in OK.

961
01:18:37,060 --> 01:18:40,060
But you can tell it's lived in she's comfortable in her own skin.

962
01:18:40,140 --> 01:18:42,180
She's it's just her speaking.

963
01:18:42,220 --> 01:18:47,340
She's got that right of like mundane ity just like a regular person.

964
01:18:47,340 --> 01:18:52,300
She like she's very good at which already she was polishing as the because I think she was in Orlando.

965
01:18:53,180 --> 01:18:55,060
Just doing like what is all the Orlando stuff.

966
01:18:55,100 --> 01:19:01,620
I think she was on the adventure club adventures club like whatever she was part of that show.

967
01:19:01,900 --> 01:19:07,260
But she would also be like the mom in sketches for M.M.C. and all that.

968
01:19:07,580 --> 01:19:11,500
So she's already like she's done what she does on TV.

969
01:19:11,940 --> 01:19:14,180
You know before SNL even.

970
01:19:14,220 --> 01:19:17,980
Well she's doing like she's I mean she's putting in the yards on on on so much.

971
01:19:18,020 --> 01:19:18,340
Yeah.

972
01:19:18,380 --> 01:19:20,660
Probably just like completely second nature.

973
01:19:20,700 --> 01:19:38,100
So by the time you do get to the SNL stage you've got that sort of like again doing it must be like it must have been almost frankly almost nothing to get up in front of like Lauren Michaels and have this like kind of flat like reaction that he sometimes does with folks when like.

974
01:19:39,140 --> 01:19:46,980
However many damn times a day she's like looking at like just half board Orlando tourists who maybe are just trying to get out of the sun.

975
01:19:47,020 --> 01:19:47,860
Some are sleeping.

976
01:19:48,700 --> 01:19:49,860
They don't know murder she wrote.

977
01:19:49,900 --> 01:19:54,020
They don't care how a show gets people from other countries who don't know the show.

978
01:19:54,060 --> 01:19:55,540
So they're just like blank staring at it.

979
01:19:56,580 --> 01:20:01,780
Like just like my fussy brother who's just like jaws is happening right now.

980
01:20:02,540 --> 01:20:06,300
And he was just like when is this over 20 minutes.

981
01:20:07,140 --> 01:20:08,700
And was a dream probably.

982
01:20:12,380 --> 01:20:13,020
She's just doing it.

983
01:20:13,100 --> 01:20:21,140
Yeah I'm sure she's I mean working like that kind of crowd that must just be the like the coldest crowd on earth.

984
01:20:21,500 --> 01:20:21,740
Yeah.

985
01:20:21,780 --> 01:20:24,780
Like it just must be like you know it must vary.

986
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:25,900
You probably like it got a great crowd.

987
01:20:25,940 --> 01:20:28,060
There's a lot of great you know people love stuff.

988
01:20:28,380 --> 01:20:31,780
They have really good planned laugh lines especially with the stuff.

989
01:20:32,220 --> 01:20:34,820
But that's got to be touch and go.

990
01:20:34,860 --> 01:20:40,740
There's got to be certain ones that I mean from my tour guide experience is definitely that we're just like there's not one today.

991
01:20:40,780 --> 01:20:42,140
Nobody's given me anything.

992
01:20:42,300 --> 01:20:44,140
So you can counter it's a couple of things.

993
01:20:44,180 --> 01:20:47,900
It's like at least in that job it's tough audiences.

994
01:20:47,940 --> 01:20:49,140
So it steals you up against that.

995
01:20:49,180 --> 01:20:55,700
But also you kind of I was so nervous shy never done anything performance wise when I got that job.

996
01:20:55,900 --> 01:20:57,380
So it also was helpful for me to go.

997
01:20:57,500 --> 01:20:59,540
Some audiences are nothing.

998
01:20:59,820 --> 01:21:09,460
Yes sometimes they just aren't paying attention and my every little tick or even they don't notice tiny fuck ups that I would typically be in my head about for days after.

999
01:21:09,660 --> 01:21:19,500
It was kind of a nice like you don't need to care so much about like they are not that engaged so you can let shit slide a little bit.

1000
01:21:19,900 --> 01:21:22,260
That's a cool thing about a theme park job.

1001
01:21:22,460 --> 01:21:25,140
And doing the same thing over and over again.

1002
01:21:25,900 --> 01:21:30,260
There you develop a level of precision I feel like.

1003
01:21:30,380 --> 01:21:30,820
Sure.

1004
01:21:30,940 --> 01:21:32,860
Like she did.

1005
01:21:32,900 --> 01:21:36,100
Look I got I got I was sloppy on many occasions.

1006
01:21:36,460 --> 01:21:38,260
She I feel like gained some precision.

1007
01:21:38,420 --> 01:21:44,380
I think I just mean like like preciseness of speaking or like confidence of movement.

1008
01:21:45,140 --> 01:21:48,900
Well I definitely had it on the like the town of Cabaco Vaughn murder sure.

1009
01:21:48,940 --> 01:21:53,140
Exactly certain parts I'm like oh I love doing the little like the one way you say that.

1010
01:21:53,180 --> 01:21:58,820
Yeah you can just really like nail that part.

1011
01:21:59,660 --> 01:22:09,060
I ran a week Jane and I ran into we're at universe Hollywood and ran into an old co-worker of hers who was doing the New Yorker couple.

1012
01:22:09,620 --> 01:22:11,860
And I wasn't me.

1013
01:22:11,900 --> 01:22:18,660
I think the one thing about doing is like oh you are casting this because you keep it up.

1014
01:22:19,140 --> 01:22:22,140
Like she had full conversations with us.

1015
01:22:22,700 --> 01:22:24,980
Oh she was in character like Daniel Day Lewis style.

1016
01:22:25,860 --> 01:22:26,780
Like Daniel Day Lewis style.

1017
01:22:27,140 --> 01:22:30,260
She was like how are you how are you doing.

1018
01:22:30,300 --> 01:22:31,860
And like did you get roasted.

1019
01:22:32,060 --> 01:22:32,300
Did you get roasted.

1020
01:22:32,300 --> 01:22:33,260
Look at the chest guys.

1021
01:22:33,260 --> 01:22:34,380
Look what you're wearing there on your head.

1022
01:22:34,380 --> 01:22:42,020
We got roasted a little you know they were talking about like the building was under some construction so they were sitting at tables outside.

1023
01:22:42,540 --> 01:22:51,340
But I think being able to sustain it for both time and then like eight shows a day for like something like this.

1024
01:22:51,460 --> 01:22:53,060
Endurance is huge.

1025
01:22:53,140 --> 01:23:02,740
I remember early on when I was like like a kid and I was like kind of auditioned for some like local theater thing and like a big thing.

1026
01:23:02,740 --> 01:23:04,540
And it was like I think it was like Wizard of Oz or something.

1027
01:23:04,540 --> 01:23:09,940
There was some musical thing and it was like my earliest memory of rejection.

1028
01:23:10,740 --> 01:23:17,100
And it was but it was like a big part of it was like they just had like every kid and it was like 100 200 kids.

1029
01:23:17,180 --> 01:23:19,100
It felt like the whole theater was just filled with kids.

1030
01:23:19,660 --> 01:23:24,980
And it wasn't I thought it was going to be like oh we'll do we'll do parts we'll do parts of the show.

1031
01:23:25,460 --> 01:23:28,060
All they had you do was sing happy birthday over and over again.

1032
01:23:28,660 --> 01:23:29,580
And you didn't stop.

1033
01:23:29,620 --> 01:23:30,100
I really.

1034
01:23:30,860 --> 01:23:33,660
And it was like what they were doing was testing.

1035
01:23:33,700 --> 01:23:44,420
Can this kid sit down and like keep it together and then keep their endurance and their energy up for like an ungodly amount of time without fidgeting without getting bored without letting their energy fall.

1036
01:23:45,860 --> 01:23:48,300
Probably very abusive tactics.

1037
01:23:48,380 --> 01:23:48,980
I don't know.

1038
01:23:49,340 --> 01:23:50,700
Yeah that sounds like it was.

1039
01:23:50,940 --> 01:23:56,660
That was a big part of it was like yeah like testing like like how is your energy.

1040
01:23:56,660 --> 01:24:00,900
Can you keep that energy ball up in the air for that long.

1041
01:24:01,740 --> 01:24:02,620
And yeah I do.

1042
01:24:03,220 --> 01:24:06,580
I was like I was annoyed.

1043
01:24:06,620 --> 01:24:08,980
So I like I sang it like twice and I was like I sung it twice.

1044
01:24:08,980 --> 01:24:09,500
I sung it.

1045
01:24:09,860 --> 01:24:17,100
I stopped like it was like part of the first wave cut and I was like what are you talking about.

1046
01:24:17,140 --> 01:24:17,460
Wow.

1047
01:24:17,500 --> 01:24:18,700
I did the full Pearl.

1048
01:24:18,740 --> 01:24:19,780
I'm a star meltdown.

1049
01:24:21,860 --> 01:24:33,540
But I you know I was adding up that like Paul Pell killing it in this show at this time in the same distance like not even the buildings like next to each other.

1050
01:24:33,540 --> 01:24:37,260
You've also got Wayne Brady Ghostbusters.

1051
01:24:37,580 --> 01:24:43,540
You've got Cheryl Hines in Hitchcock show Orlando actors in early uniform.

1052
01:24:44,060 --> 01:24:44,940
And those are big.

1053
01:24:44,980 --> 01:24:49,100
Those are like gigantic comedy careers that came out of.

1054
01:24:49,540 --> 01:24:58,940
And then you got it's not the same thing but over it you know Nickelodeon you got you got Keenan you got young Keenan starting an endless career.

1055
01:24:58,940 --> 01:25:06,260
And there was some I think there was some just general comedy actor mojo happening at early Universal Orlando.

1056
01:25:06,300 --> 01:25:08,340
They were letting folks play there.

1057
01:25:08,420 --> 01:25:13,980
I think they were letting folks kind of go and I think they were trying stuff out in that first few years.

1058
01:25:15,660 --> 01:25:31,700
There needs to be like more of like the mythologizing of the Orlando scene and I'm not even really joking I'm joking a little bit but like there needs to be like Tom shale's book like of oral history is like just Orlando theme park scene of people who like made it pretty big coming out of there.

1059
01:25:32,220 --> 01:25:33,180
Oh Dee Bradley Baker.

1060
01:25:33,260 --> 01:25:35,380
Legends didn't tell what we talked about no longer.

1061
01:25:35,420 --> 01:25:38,260
That's a huge career that was just around there.

1062
01:25:38,300 --> 01:25:38,620
Yeah.

1063
01:25:38,820 --> 01:25:47,980
Probably ones we're maybe also maybe people who are quieter about their maybe more embarrassed by their Orlando theme park.

1064
01:25:48,020 --> 01:25:52,700
Yeah everybody should because I hear it and then I I light up like knowing this about Paula Pell.

1065
01:25:52,940 --> 01:25:56,460
If anyone listening to this has a connection to Paula Pell she'd be a dream guest.

1066
01:25:56,620 --> 01:26:00,020
Let me put that into the world but given all that experience.

1067
01:26:00,060 --> 01:26:01,500
But yeah I don't know.

1068
01:26:01,620 --> 01:26:01,940
It was.

1069
01:26:02,020 --> 01:26:02,420
You're right.

1070
01:26:02,500 --> 01:26:03,300
It was a scene.

1071
01:26:03,740 --> 01:26:05,460
Maybe that's maybe you should try to.

1072
01:26:05,620 --> 01:26:15,740
Or we all could try to pitch that as a like an HBO miniseries that should be two episodes but is stretched out to nine episodes.

1073
01:26:15,780 --> 01:26:16,060
Yeah.

1074
01:26:16,420 --> 01:26:16,700
Sure.

1075
01:26:16,740 --> 01:26:16,900
Yeah.

1076
01:26:18,140 --> 01:26:19,140
The typical format.

1077
01:26:19,180 --> 01:26:19,740
These days.

1078
01:26:20,180 --> 01:26:20,500
I think so.

1079
01:26:20,580 --> 01:26:20,860
Yeah.

1080
01:26:21,860 --> 01:26:22,700
So hopefully.

1081
01:26:23,460 --> 01:26:23,780
Yeah.

1082
01:26:23,860 --> 01:26:27,700
But what have we missed like in terms of beats of this.

1083
01:26:27,900 --> 01:26:29,980
Well any big moments that you enjoyed.

1084
01:26:30,020 --> 01:26:30,380
So they did.

1085
01:26:30,620 --> 01:26:34,780
So they did the full bit like so like during the ADR section to wrap that up they did.

1086
01:26:34,820 --> 01:26:50,340
So the big laugh line they would always do because you because you've got these kids because they have to you have to replace the dialogue for the sort of elegant this elegant couple you've got like Ash Brooke and Leilani and you've got this sort of just like tuxedoed and

1087
01:26:50,340 --> 01:27:11,260
gown and everybody sort of fancy and then they always picked the most like like mom sure like like just wearing the night shirt as a day shirt like kind of just tourists fanny pet like and it was always funny because you know you've got this like elegance on the screen and then you've got this sort of like you betcha Fargo accent.

1088
01:27:12,220 --> 01:27:24,580
And it was great every time and like it was always like that mean it was always like the Leilani would I remember like both times the Leilani would like be great and like hit the mark and hit the and hit the dialogue beats correctly.

1089
01:27:26,340 --> 01:27:41,220
But it would just be the voice was so funny but then the Ashbrook the guy was always just like seven seconds late like he was always just like then they played and that would be funny because he'd like you know then when they did the replay at the end you'd have the character.

1090
01:27:41,260 --> 01:27:57,580
Sort of mouth moving and then just as he's finished speaking you'd go it's a lie like you'd have you sort of like you think they like that's yeah maybe that's a design to talk about humiliating dad is the big laugh always in these shows.

1091
01:27:57,580 --> 01:27:57,820
Yeah.

1092
01:27:58,100 --> 01:28:00,020
You gotta humiliate them up to fail.

1093
01:28:00,580 --> 01:28:09,860
It was and I was I can probably attest to that because I went both two days in a row when I went the dude was late almost to the second.

1094
01:28:09,940 --> 01:28:10,260
Yeah.

1095
01:28:10,260 --> 01:28:10,780
Every time.

1096
01:28:10,980 --> 01:28:24,500
Well you're like and I to a point where like I at the time I was of course not thinking galaxy brain like this but I was imagine if I was I was like they did this on purpose they're trying to see they're doing this on like I would have how far would I.

1097
01:28:24,740 --> 01:28:25,220
Case.

1098
01:28:25,660 --> 01:28:27,300
My thinking was that advanced at that point.

1099
01:28:27,340 --> 01:28:28,540
But no.

1100
01:28:28,940 --> 01:28:37,860
Well that was one of my reality break is as Star Wars Galactic Star Cruiser has come up a lot recently as it was closing.

1101
01:28:38,420 --> 01:28:47,100
I think one of my things that it would have been harder to break reality is like these people don't spend 48 hours on the ship like we do.

1102
01:28:47,900 --> 01:28:51,420
They have to stop at Target for a few things on the way home.

1103
01:28:52,100 --> 01:28:52,660
Oh yeah.

1104
01:28:52,700 --> 01:28:54,740
Well I am like sleeping.

1105
01:28:56,140 --> 01:28:57,340
That's just two in your head.

1106
01:28:57,420 --> 01:28:59,460
They've got off the ship.

1107
01:28:59,820 --> 01:29:00,340
Yes.

1108
01:29:00,420 --> 01:29:00,740
Yeah.

1109
01:29:00,780 --> 01:29:00,900
Yeah.

1110
01:29:00,940 --> 01:29:01,380
Don't live.

1111
01:29:01,420 --> 01:29:04,060
They didn't build them a little a little caught.

1112
01:29:04,220 --> 01:29:08,700
I have to stop at gas and I'll probably just run in the little Caesars next door.

1113
01:29:08,700 --> 01:29:10,300
I really don't feel like cooking.

1114
01:29:11,100 --> 01:29:20,780
Yeah that's that's what I'm so glad you all brought this up on the Taron Killam episode I just listened to where it was like we're talking about the during the kiss good night sleeping in the castle thing.

1115
01:29:21,660 --> 01:29:26,580
Where it was like where does the where does the butler what I don't know what that situation is.

1116
01:29:26,620 --> 01:29:26,900
Yeah.

1117
01:29:27,300 --> 01:29:28,740
Like he's got to be somewhere.

1118
01:29:29,140 --> 01:29:30,620
You want to be able to leave or.

1119
01:29:30,860 --> 01:29:33,260
Or there's two butlers and one is a night shift.

1120
01:29:33,300 --> 01:29:34,780
One is the I don't know.

1121
01:29:34,900 --> 01:29:36,100
I'm still fascinated by that.

1122
01:29:36,340 --> 01:29:38,180
I feel like I need a resolution on that.

1123
01:29:38,300 --> 01:29:38,580
Yeah.

1124
01:29:38,980 --> 01:29:46,460
We got to find somebody who's actually stayed in the dream suite seemed like that was like Taron got a brief tour but who has done.

1125
01:29:46,780 --> 01:29:50,220
And if there are other people who stayed overnight in the dream suite who weren't like.

1126
01:29:50,540 --> 01:29:51,420
Kings or queens.

1127
01:29:51,820 --> 01:29:54,060
Or who aren't like the captains of industry who we've been.

1128
01:29:54,060 --> 01:29:54,380
Struck.

1129
01:29:54,380 --> 01:29:55,060
Oh sure.

1130
01:29:55,180 --> 01:29:55,660
Are there.

1131
01:29:56,460 --> 01:29:56,940
Are there.

1132
01:29:57,540 --> 01:29:58,580
Good people.

1133
01:29:58,620 --> 01:30:02,180
Dick Van Dyke was up there yesterday at Disneyland waving to everybody.

1134
01:30:02,380 --> 01:30:02,660
Yesterday.

1135
01:30:03,100 --> 01:30:03,500
Yeah I think.

1136
01:30:03,620 --> 01:30:04,340
Are you two days ago.

1137
01:30:04,700 --> 01:30:05,420
In the last two days.

1138
01:30:05,420 --> 01:30:06,180
In the dream suite that's where he was.

1139
01:30:06,180 --> 01:30:07,620
I believe so over pirates.

1140
01:30:08,140 --> 01:30:12,900
Didn't they flip one of those to an elegant dining room.

1141
01:30:13,180 --> 01:30:14,700
Perhaps perhaps that's the balcony he was in.

1142
01:30:15,180 --> 01:30:16,780
I don't know what he was up there anymore.

1143
01:30:16,780 --> 01:30:19,940
I'm not saying he was staying there but he was up on that balcony area so perhaps.

1144
01:30:19,980 --> 01:30:22,620
The club 33 balcony area waving at people.

1145
01:30:22,620 --> 01:30:23,740
So maybe it was just that then.

1146
01:30:23,740 --> 01:30:23,820
Yeah.

1147
01:30:23,820 --> 01:30:25,060
Maybe it was just the club 33.

1148
01:30:25,140 --> 01:30:25,740
Still.

1149
01:30:25,940 --> 01:30:26,380
Love that he's.

1150
01:30:26,380 --> 01:30:26,940
Pretty good.

1151
01:30:26,980 --> 01:30:27,420
Yeah.

1152
01:30:27,580 --> 01:30:28,460
97.

1153
01:30:28,620 --> 01:30:29,060
Still waving.

1154
01:30:29,060 --> 01:30:29,700
I was going to say get out.

1155
01:30:29,780 --> 01:30:31,660
Let's bring back diagnosis Murray.

1156
01:30:31,660 --> 01:30:32,060
Oh yeah.

1157
01:30:32,060 --> 01:30:34,060
No speaking of the show these pleasant.

1158
01:30:34,420 --> 01:30:35,660
He was on a worse one.

1159
01:30:35,900 --> 01:30:36,300
He was on.

1160
01:30:37,540 --> 01:30:42,620
Wait no no no because don't when you're making that list don't throw out Cosby mysteries.

1161
01:30:43,500 --> 01:30:45,660
I just remember literally this week.

1162
01:30:45,660 --> 01:30:47,740
Remember there was the Cosby mystery.

1163
01:30:48,100 --> 01:30:49,700
That was so short lived or.

1164
01:30:49,820 --> 01:30:50,780
Yeah that didn't make it.

1165
01:30:50,780 --> 01:30:52,340
I know for years.

1166
01:30:52,380 --> 01:30:52,620
Yeah.

1167
01:30:52,620 --> 01:30:53,180
That was.

1168
01:30:53,300 --> 01:30:53,580
Yeah.

1169
01:30:53,580 --> 01:30:55,900
Oh so you know Cosby is fucking so mad.

1170
01:30:55,940 --> 01:30:56,260
Yeah.

1171
01:30:56,660 --> 01:31:00,140
I'm the this is the only one that doesn't run for over a decade.

1172
01:31:00,140 --> 01:31:03,220
And he was the more current star obviously he had had a huge hit.

1173
01:31:03,700 --> 01:31:04,660
Pretty recently.

1174
01:31:04,660 --> 01:31:08,380
It had another one just Cosby soon after.

1175
01:31:08,420 --> 01:31:08,700
Yeah.

1176
01:31:08,700 --> 01:31:12,300
Well it was funny because because you've got Angela Lansbury and Dick Van Dyke both of

1177
01:31:12,300 --> 01:31:19,060
whom had like pivoted from you know it's not it's I feel like Cosby was pivoting from a sitcom.

1178
01:31:19,100 --> 01:31:20,220
Yeah like murder.

1179
01:31:20,940 --> 01:31:25,500
But then like Dick Van Dyke was you know Dick Van Dyke who is a killer on one of the

1180
01:31:25,500 --> 01:31:29,860
Columbus and I was always I've seen that one.

1181
01:31:29,860 --> 01:31:31,100
It's very sinister.

1182
01:31:31,140 --> 01:31:32,220
He's got like a beard.

1183
01:31:32,980 --> 01:31:34,220
It's it's again.

1184
01:31:34,420 --> 01:31:42,020
I got very it's like with I hate how lizard brain I am about this where I'm like no you're

1185
01:31:42,020 --> 01:31:42,540
not bad.

1186
01:31:42,660 --> 01:31:47,260
I can't accept that into my body like seeing Angela Lansbury in Manchurian Canada I was

1187
01:31:47,260 --> 01:31:52,380
like I don't yeah I don't think you maybe I don't watch this.

1188
01:31:54,180 --> 01:31:54,660
Wow.

1189
01:31:54,900 --> 01:31:55,900
So evil in that.

1190
01:31:55,900 --> 01:31:57,540
She is evil in that.

1191
01:31:57,540 --> 01:31:57,780
Yeah.

1192
01:31:57,780 --> 01:32:00,100
So evil and so good and yet.

1193
01:32:00,700 --> 01:32:01,460
It just bugs you.

1194
01:32:01,860 --> 01:32:08,100
Yeah but I've seen it like I think I've seen it like once and I was like OK but like I don't

1195
01:32:08,100 --> 01:32:08,900
want to see it again.

1196
01:32:08,980 --> 01:32:12,020
I don't need to like I can't like I can't just like always be seeing this.

1197
01:32:12,060 --> 01:32:14,420
But do you accept her in Sweeney Todd.

1198
01:32:15,020 --> 01:32:21,580
You know I do because that's that's a whimsy plus like we got our guy who is Sweeney Todd

1199
01:32:21,580 --> 01:32:22,460
to her Mrs.

1200
01:32:22,460 --> 01:32:25,820
Levitt who is a regular love interest in Murder She Wrote.

1201
01:32:26,500 --> 01:32:35,020
He shows up and once a season he is I think he's like an Irish like secret agent.

1202
01:32:35,980 --> 01:32:39,100
My it's it's I want to say like he's with like M.I.

1203
01:32:40,180 --> 01:32:44,940
Six six like and I don't know like but then he's Irish so I don't know.

1204
01:32:46,420 --> 01:32:46,660
Yes.

1205
01:32:46,660 --> 01:32:47,820
James Bond is Scottish.

1206
01:32:48,060 --> 01:32:48,420
Right.

1207
01:32:48,420 --> 01:32:48,820
He's in M.I.

1208
01:32:48,820 --> 01:32:49,100
Six.

1209
01:32:49,100 --> 01:32:49,340
Yeah.

1210
01:32:49,340 --> 01:32:50,140
That's right.

1211
01:32:50,140 --> 01:32:50,620
That's right.

1212
01:32:50,620 --> 01:32:52,420
So yeah I think he's like an M.I.

1213
01:32:52,420 --> 01:32:52,900
Six agent.

1214
01:32:52,900 --> 01:32:59,140
He's always like once a season she'd get wrapped up into some international intrigue thanks

1215
01:32:59,140 --> 01:32:59,740
to him.

1216
01:33:00,380 --> 01:33:01,660
Michael Haggerty was his name.

1217
01:33:02,020 --> 01:33:08,100
And and they had the that's the closest she ever came to having like a torrid affair.

1218
01:33:09,220 --> 01:33:13,620
And like that's one of where I could convince myself were like whenever they cut away they

1219
01:33:13,620 --> 01:33:14,740
were like together.

1220
01:33:15,700 --> 01:33:20,020
Because it was always like out of time was far from they were out of the United States.

1221
01:33:21,020 --> 01:33:24,220
They were always like some vacation spot internationally.

1222
01:33:25,020 --> 01:33:29,980
And it was usually like he was getting her involved in like the Russians every time.

1223
01:33:30,660 --> 01:33:35,940
It was just like some Russian attache was like the thing and then he was murdered and

1224
01:33:35,940 --> 01:33:38,340
like she was still the only one who could solve it.

1225
01:33:39,100 --> 01:33:39,940
It was very funny.

1226
01:33:40,180 --> 01:33:45,460
Now do we in the torrid affair area they don't show it because it's a theme park show.

1227
01:33:45,500 --> 01:33:49,060
But do we think she and Tom Selleck hooked up.

1228
01:33:49,820 --> 01:33:57,140
So I think so it feels very date night because he's there and he's got like this again

1229
01:33:57,180 --> 01:34:02,460
they're wearing incongruous outfits because he's wearing Magnum P.I. sort of like open

1230
01:34:02,460 --> 01:34:05,620
shirt the hairy chest sort of the Tom Selleck kind of look.

1231
01:34:05,660 --> 01:34:08,020
Is he supposed to be Magnum is that subtly implied.

1232
01:34:08,060 --> 01:34:09,820
Is it just a shot from Magnum.

1233
01:34:10,060 --> 01:34:13,980
You know what honestly I need to look at it because like it doesn't reappear anywhere

1234
01:34:13,980 --> 01:34:17,220
else and there is slightly different.

1235
01:34:17,420 --> 01:34:24,660
I remember it being like so wild that I can't remember like my like best friend from high

1236
01:34:24,700 --> 01:34:29,540
school's name but like I can remember like the lighting on the murder she wrote Tom Selleck

1237
01:34:29,540 --> 01:34:30,780
shot was like slightly different.

1238
01:34:31,300 --> 01:34:35,740
Not it was not quite matching the lighting on Angela's face so it could have been they

1239
01:34:35,740 --> 01:34:37,780
pulled it from a Magnum episode.

1240
01:34:37,980 --> 01:34:40,580
But I don't know why they would do that and not just reshoot it.

1241
01:34:40,860 --> 01:34:42,420
Well because maybe getting him is tough.

1242
01:34:42,460 --> 01:34:45,740
Maybe they just found something that correlated maybe decently.

1243
01:34:46,100 --> 01:34:46,380
Who knows.

1244
01:34:46,620 --> 01:34:48,060
He still has to sign off.

1245
01:34:48,100 --> 01:34:50,620
He still have to like get paid and get signed off.

1246
01:34:50,660 --> 01:34:54,420
Yeah but maybe but then he doesn't have to like go drive to a place and do.

1247
01:34:54,500 --> 01:34:54,940
Yeah.

1248
01:34:54,940 --> 01:34:55,260
True.

1249
01:34:55,260 --> 01:34:56,540
Be in one camera setup.

1250
01:34:56,580 --> 01:34:59,220
I think they were both universal television.

1251
01:34:59,260 --> 01:35:06,380
If I remember the wall of DVDs at the backlot tour on the on the lot itself.

1252
01:35:06,660 --> 01:35:09,100
Murder she wrote was next to Magnum.

1253
01:35:10,260 --> 01:35:14,820
I'm going to solve my own mystery here and say I think that was pre-recorded Tom Selleck

1254
01:35:15,180 --> 01:35:17,620
because there is no two shot of them.

1255
01:35:17,980 --> 01:35:21,020
They are abusing my executive producer editing.

1256
01:35:21,980 --> 01:35:27,060
The thing remembrance is there's you cut there's her talking and it's a it's a they

1257
01:35:27,060 --> 01:35:30,860
just keep cutting back and forth between the two of them talking and it's slightly dimmer.

1258
01:35:31,060 --> 01:35:32,380
Yeah it's a slight gag.

1259
01:35:32,420 --> 01:35:33,980
It's a glorified like a gag.

1260
01:35:34,020 --> 01:35:34,380
Yeah.

1261
01:35:35,260 --> 01:35:42,500
The magic of editing magic of editing and they had in the ADR section they had the

1262
01:35:42,500 --> 01:35:44,220
crowd could get involved.

1263
01:35:44,300 --> 01:35:49,580
So I don't know if they didn't shoot they didn't show this part in the in the whole

1264
01:35:49,620 --> 01:35:52,900
camp in the in the John Forsyte video but like they did show it.

1265
01:35:53,340 --> 01:35:57,140
You can hear it if you see the like when she walks into dinner with.

1266
01:35:57,180 --> 01:35:58,820
Oh there's a bunch of like clap trap.

1267
01:35:58,860 --> 01:36:00,260
Like the audience all makes a bunch of noise.

1268
01:36:00,300 --> 01:36:02,100
So they're like they had us do Walla Walla.

1269
01:36:02,140 --> 01:36:04,380
They're like OK yes and the crowd does a Walla Walla Walla.

1270
01:36:04,420 --> 01:36:09,620
So we're going to record a Walla Walla Walla Walla and I say Walla Walla Walla and it

1271
01:36:09,620 --> 01:36:11,220
just turned into screaming.

1272
01:36:11,900 --> 01:36:13,620
I say the video is like what's happening.

1273
01:36:13,660 --> 01:36:15,180
Why is this restaurant.

1274
01:36:15,780 --> 01:36:19,100
I was wondering that about you if you all saw that.

1275
01:36:19,140 --> 01:36:23,660
Because I was like out of context it has to be like what's what's wrong with this audio.

1276
01:36:23,820 --> 01:36:28,020
It sounds like the prisoners in the pit and Dark Knight Rises doing that.

1277
01:36:30,860 --> 01:36:33,100
She's going to make the the the faith jump.

1278
01:36:35,900 --> 01:36:42,260
She has wandered into a restaurant where the like demons from hell are feasting and she's

1279
01:36:42,260 --> 01:36:43,380
in evening wear.

1280
01:36:43,540 --> 01:36:43,820
Yes.

1281
01:36:43,900 --> 01:36:46,820
Something's amiss in this restaurant that's nothing but demons eating.

1282
01:36:46,860 --> 01:36:48,780
Hellraiser box has been opened.

1283
01:36:49,020 --> 01:36:50,220
Yeah I hear the steak off.

1284
01:36:50,220 --> 01:36:51,380
Pop is good here.

1285
01:36:52,620 --> 01:36:57,180
So yeah so you recorded a Walla Walla Walla and then you were thinking you were creating

1286
01:36:57,180 --> 01:37:04,380
a nice sort of dinner sort of a sort of conversational tone and then you hear it and you're

1287
01:37:04,380 --> 01:37:06,180
just like this stinks.

1288
01:37:06,220 --> 01:37:06,900
We overdid it.

1289
01:37:06,940 --> 01:37:07,740
We didn't do good.

1290
01:37:07,780 --> 01:37:08,300
We overdid it.

1291
01:37:08,340 --> 01:37:12,540
So the second time you went you're like OK and you tried to like the next the people all

1292
01:37:12,540 --> 01:37:12,900
around you.

1293
01:37:12,940 --> 01:37:13,220
I was.

1294
01:37:13,460 --> 01:37:14,340
Take it down a notch.

1295
01:37:14,380 --> 01:37:15,820
Take it down a couple notches.

1296
01:37:16,220 --> 01:37:20,300
Yes unfortunately my authority was undermined by my height.

1297
01:37:21,460 --> 01:37:23,220
Your EP level of control.

1298
01:37:24,500 --> 01:37:30,020
Oh you know also I think when in that Pellipel version when Tom Selleck appears then she

1299
01:37:30,020 --> 01:37:36,860
like melts to the floor so happy as she to see Tom says she just she falls out of her

1300
01:37:36,860 --> 01:37:39,660
chair at the mere sight of Tom Selleck.

1301
01:37:39,700 --> 01:37:40,500
It's who wouldn't.

1302
01:37:40,780 --> 01:37:42,660
Yes fine acting.

1303
01:37:43,660 --> 01:37:44,900
Big theme park feints.

1304
01:37:45,140 --> 01:37:46,300
It plays to the back row.

1305
01:37:46,540 --> 01:37:52,980
Also what you mentioned this in the DMs I forgot we make in the list of great performers

1306
01:37:52,980 --> 01:37:54,420
at that time in Orlando.

1307
01:37:54,460 --> 01:37:55,260
Moe.

1308
01:37:55,380 --> 01:37:56,340
Yeah right.

1309
01:37:56,340 --> 01:38:01,100
From Guts my record did this job to which you remembered from our episode and I forgot

1310
01:38:01,220 --> 01:38:02,820
but this is one of the things she was doing.

1311
01:38:02,900 --> 01:38:08,540
Wait maybe concurrently with being on Guts like she's on Guts but they you know they

1312
01:38:08,540 --> 01:38:10,820
block shoot them so she also still keeps the theme park.

1313
01:38:10,980 --> 01:38:16,020
I think what Moe exposed at least to me and maybe to y'all during that episode was like

1314
01:38:16,620 --> 01:38:21,780
oh there's just like it was not like Nickelodeon was not this like well you can just

1315
01:38:21,780 --> 01:38:22,820
retire off of this.

1316
01:38:23,020 --> 01:38:24,340
Yes right.

1317
01:38:24,780 --> 01:38:28,700
Because I was like oh well you're just like set you know you worked on your Moe.

1318
01:38:28,900 --> 01:38:29,740
Yes I know.

1319
01:38:29,780 --> 01:38:34,060
So you're just like yeah you know you're currently living in Brentwood off of your Guts

1320
01:38:34,060 --> 01:38:34,460
money.

1321
01:38:35,140 --> 01:38:36,180
How it should be.

1322
01:38:36,260 --> 01:38:36,900
How it should be.

1323
01:38:37,220 --> 01:38:39,300
The world and a great voiceover career.

1324
01:38:39,980 --> 01:38:43,260
But still like she should have that should have been a choice to keep doing it.

1325
01:38:43,540 --> 01:38:44,580
So you should have got it.

1326
01:38:44,860 --> 01:38:46,820
You could have wrapped it up in 96 if she had to.

1327
01:38:46,860 --> 01:38:50,820
Recording with Mike O'Malley and just racing across Mrs.

1328
01:38:50,820 --> 01:38:52,900
Doubtfire like to the Murder She Wrote Theater.

1329
01:38:53,020 --> 01:38:55,140
I got to catch the 530 show.

1330
01:38:55,220 --> 01:38:59,140
I put my big Janine glasses on and go hey what's going on over here.

1331
01:38:59,180 --> 01:39:00,740
Like it's.

1332
01:39:01,260 --> 01:39:03,740
Stopping at a hot dog cart for a quick lunch.

1333
01:39:03,780 --> 01:39:04,260
Yes.

1334
01:39:04,260 --> 01:39:05,860
And becoming Janine.

1335
01:39:05,900 --> 01:39:06,700
You like that part.

1336
01:39:06,700 --> 01:39:08,020
Well I like that part.

1337
01:39:09,180 --> 01:39:10,060
But the hurrying.

1338
01:39:10,220 --> 01:39:12,940
The hurrying is not as hot as that.

1339
01:39:13,980 --> 01:39:15,940
Mel's whatever is there.

1340
01:39:17,140 --> 01:39:17,860
What's on the way.

1341
01:39:17,900 --> 01:39:19,020
The stomachache burger.

1342
01:39:19,180 --> 01:39:19,460
Yes.

1343
01:39:21,980 --> 01:39:25,300
Well it's a great little condensed Murder She Wrote.

1344
01:39:25,340 --> 01:39:27,740
It's a great vehicle for performers.

1345
01:39:28,820 --> 01:39:32,820
You know true movie making process the thing that they've lost a little bit.

1346
01:39:33,060 --> 01:39:37,540
This goes away and becomes Hercules and Xena.

1347
01:39:37,580 --> 01:39:41,660
It's funny I don't want to throw an episode under the bus but I remember we brought up this Mo one.

1348
01:39:41,700 --> 01:39:42,500
How great was she.

1349
01:39:42,500 --> 01:39:43,260
She was so excited.

1350
01:39:43,420 --> 01:39:45,980
That's when I think of that nice pandemic episode.

1351
01:39:46,020 --> 01:39:47,300
Yeah that's high for sure.

1352
01:39:47,460 --> 01:39:51,940
Then I think about when the period of time where we're like we're going to be back together in person soon.

1353
01:39:51,940 --> 01:39:55,540
What the fuck can we burn off that sucks where we aren't doing it in person.

1354
01:39:55,740 --> 01:39:57,540
Hercules and Xena maybe Hercules and Xena.

1355
01:39:58,140 --> 01:39:59,980
We can jam that out on Zoom.

1356
01:40:00,020 --> 01:40:02,740
That's one of like two that I did participate in.

1357
01:40:02,940 --> 01:40:04,340
I was excited for that.

1358
01:40:04,340 --> 01:40:05,940
You were in Hercules and Xena.

1359
01:40:05,940 --> 01:40:07,260
You had the bravery.

1360
01:40:07,300 --> 01:40:13,580
I had the one time I had the bravery to do a reaction shot like wearing like.

1361
01:40:13,580 --> 01:40:14,220
Amazing.

1362
01:40:14,220 --> 01:40:15,540
Oh that's right.

1363
01:40:15,740 --> 01:40:19,380
See I'm telling you I forgot because the pandemic episodes I started blacking out.

1364
01:40:19,380 --> 01:40:20,940
I'm so desperate for them to be done.

1365
01:40:20,940 --> 01:40:20,980
You know what we should do.

1366
01:40:20,980 --> 01:40:27,060
We should do like an office ladies about our pandemic episodes where we do reactions to the episode.

1367
01:40:27,060 --> 01:40:29,860
I would like subscribe to a fourth tier for that.

1368
01:40:29,980 --> 01:40:32,620
And that will give you perspective on what we were thinking behind the scenes.

1369
01:40:32,620 --> 01:40:36,660
And then like if we were proud of it and proud of each other.

1370
01:40:36,860 --> 01:40:44,940
And I'll say remember this was the day we had to do this under the under the shadow of that was when Trump blew off all the bombs around the church.

1371
01:40:44,940 --> 01:40:46,860
And then we had to pull it together.

1372
01:40:46,860 --> 01:40:47,340
That's right.

1373
01:40:47,340 --> 01:40:53,380
So that we could talk about you know the what's the most mundane thing.

1374
01:40:53,580 --> 01:40:56,980
The photo booth where you could film music videos with your mom.

1375
01:40:57,140 --> 01:40:58,620
Yeah we had to.

1376
01:40:58,620 --> 01:41:00,900
You remember what a tough time in America.

1377
01:41:00,900 --> 01:41:03,380
Yeah I think it's a great idea.

1378
01:41:03,380 --> 01:41:10,180
And most of it will be like I'll re litigate how much laughter I got for jokes that I said like I'll be like well that was a good one and you guys didn't laugh enough.

1379
01:41:10,180 --> 01:41:11,180
It would have worked in person.

1380
01:41:11,180 --> 01:41:14,780
That was the technology was just lagging and other way if it had been a person big laugh.

1381
01:41:14,780 --> 01:41:15,060
Right.

1382
01:41:15,060 --> 01:41:23,700
Also because like you know if you all are anything like me that sort of first at least that first year.

1383
01:41:23,820 --> 01:41:31,380
Like I have started like in like one division style sort of stitching that year out of my memory.

1384
01:41:31,380 --> 01:41:41,420
Oh I don't believe like I've completely like because I moved to I moved to North Carolina and then I came back and I'm back in the place where I was in like 2018 2019.

1385
01:41:41,420 --> 01:41:45,300
So my brain continues to believe it's 2018.

1386
01:41:45,300 --> 01:41:46,100
Yeah no me too.

1387
01:41:46,100 --> 01:41:51,380
And so I'm just like I have this sort of like vertigo where I'm like it's not 2018.

1388
01:41:52,020 --> 01:41:58,660
I say last year about 2019 or 2018 constantly still I did it two days ago.

1389
01:41:58,660 --> 01:42:02,100
I go well we went here last year and I really meant before the pandemic.

1390
01:42:02,100 --> 01:42:09,020
It's really wild how there is sort of and it timed out this way there is sort of a lost Thanos snap five years.

1391
01:42:09,020 --> 01:42:10,020
100 percent.

1392
01:42:10,020 --> 01:42:11,940
It's horrifying.

1393
01:42:11,940 --> 01:42:12,940
Yeah.

1394
01:42:12,940 --> 01:42:18,860
And it's like OK well you know I would revisit some episodes because you probably don't remember them.

1395
01:42:18,860 --> 01:42:20,260
No I don't remember a lot of them.

1396
01:42:20,340 --> 01:42:21,620
You're probably just like oh yeah.

1397
01:42:21,620 --> 01:42:27,300
I struggled to think of one we actually did especially like there was a minute where like it was fun.

1398
01:42:27,300 --> 01:42:28,780
It's like a fun little summer camp.

1399
01:42:28,780 --> 01:42:29,700
We all get to stay.

1400
01:42:29,700 --> 01:42:32,860
We got to stay indoors and it's actually interesting.

1401
01:42:32,860 --> 01:42:34,580
We're doing an episode over Zoom.

1402
01:42:34,580 --> 01:42:37,940
That's not what. And then by month 14.

1403
01:42:37,940 --> 01:42:43,940
Fucking God you know the only one I remember going that was good was McGruff 2.

1404
01:42:43,940 --> 01:42:45,220
On Patreon.

1405
01:42:45,220 --> 01:42:46,860
I remember going I think McGruff 2.

1406
01:42:46,860 --> 01:42:48,580
I forgot we did that on Patreon.

1407
01:42:48,580 --> 01:42:51,100
I think I think you're I mean I mean I was zoomed rather.

1408
01:42:51,100 --> 01:42:52,100
Yeah.

1409
01:42:52,100 --> 01:42:55,340
Yes but your patrons during that time were very good.

1410
01:42:55,340 --> 01:43:03,620
I will say they were all very good but I would say the patrons were really singing because like I think it's best during these times when people get a little delirious.

1411
01:43:03,620 --> 01:43:04,620
Sure.

1412
01:43:04,620 --> 01:43:06,580
And so that's sort of the pay in the sort of second gate.

1413
01:43:06,580 --> 01:43:08,620
That's when everybody kind of get a little silly.

1414
01:43:08,620 --> 01:43:10,020
You've got to become a little.

1415
01:43:10,020 --> 01:43:12,860
You're not really sticking to you don't have to.

1416
01:43:12,860 --> 01:43:13,860
Sure.

1417
01:43:13,860 --> 01:43:14,860
Stick to.

1418
01:43:14,860 --> 01:43:15,860
We're going mad.

1419
01:43:15,860 --> 01:43:16,860
Listeners are going mad.

1420
01:43:16,860 --> 01:43:18,060
We're all let's just all go mad together.

1421
01:43:18,060 --> 01:43:20,220
It was a little validating in that way.

1422
01:43:20,220 --> 01:43:21,220
That's nice to hear.

1423
01:43:21,220 --> 01:43:30,940
That it's all tangents and it's about this topic that's it's not just like oh this beloved thing it's like a really wild never thought about that thing.

1424
01:43:30,940 --> 01:43:35,540
Like well it was I remember early on saying fuck it we're doing Kevin Spacey.

1425
01:43:35,540 --> 01:43:36,540
I.

1426
01:43:36,540 --> 01:43:39,300
Now is the day it's a fuck it time and this is happening.

1427
01:43:39,300 --> 01:43:43,220
When the question marks popped up I was like whatever this team.

1428
01:43:43,220 --> 01:43:44,220
Excuse me.

1429
01:43:44,220 --> 01:43:45,220
What is this from the theme park podcast.

1430
01:43:45,220 --> 01:43:46,220
Oh even it's back.

1431
01:43:46,220 --> 01:43:47,220
Oh that's good.

1432
01:43:47,380 --> 01:43:50,380
Like what's now happening.

1433
01:43:50,380 --> 01:43:51,380
For who.

1434
01:43:51,380 --> 01:43:52,380
For the devil himself.

1435
01:43:52,380 --> 01:43:53,380
My god.

1436
01:43:53,380 --> 01:43:54,380
Yeah.

1437
01:43:54,380 --> 01:43:55,380
Kevin Spacey.

1438
01:43:55,380 --> 01:43:56,380
Sitting.

1439
01:43:56,380 --> 01:44:04,500
Sitting in my bedroom and on the small TV having rented a digital copy of Beyond the

1440
01:44:04,500 --> 01:44:10,700
Sea and that opening where he's like I'm like hell Joel's to mama.

1441
01:44:10,700 --> 01:44:11,700
I'm like oh no.

1442
01:44:11,700 --> 01:44:12,700
Oh my.

1443
01:44:12,700 --> 01:44:13,700
This is so odd.

1444
01:44:13,700 --> 01:44:14,700
I can't go anywhere.

1445
01:44:14,700 --> 01:44:15,700
Yeah.

1446
01:44:15,700 --> 01:44:16,700
That's what I'm saying.

1447
01:44:17,180 --> 01:44:18,180
That was your bottom.

1448
01:44:18,180 --> 01:44:19,180
That was mine.

1449
01:44:19,180 --> 01:44:20,180
Yeah.

1450
01:44:20,180 --> 01:44:21,180
This.

1451
01:44:21,180 --> 01:44:22,180
Yeah.

1452
01:44:22,180 --> 01:44:24,460
I feel partly responsible for this because I did sort of right before the Kevin Spacey

1453
01:44:24,460 --> 01:44:28,860
stuff came out like I did feel I did say something you know to a friend I was like you know I

1454
01:44:28,860 --> 01:44:33,260
wish I just wish more like celebrities were like you know who are closeted which like come

1455
01:44:33,260 --> 01:44:36,340
out and then like the monkey's paw finger curls.

1456
01:44:36,340 --> 01:44:37,340
Oh yeah.

1457
01:44:37,340 --> 01:44:38,340
What is this you mean?

1458
01:44:38,340 --> 01:44:40,260
I have an announcement to make.

1459
01:44:40,260 --> 01:44:41,260
I'm gay.

1460
01:44:41,260 --> 01:44:42,580
I'm like we're like not now.

1461
01:44:43,460 --> 01:44:46,020
Now I have a smoke bomb to throw.

1462
01:44:46,020 --> 01:44:49,020
I need an apology to make.

1463
01:44:49,020 --> 01:44:52,140
It really was like okay.

1464
01:44:52,140 --> 01:44:55,980
I know everyone's coming out story is unique and different.

1465
01:44:55,980 --> 01:45:00,780
Usually there aren't suspicious murders circling.

1466
01:45:00,780 --> 01:45:06,900
It's very it's very interesting and then like a few short years later like you know you

1467
01:45:06,900 --> 01:45:12,060
know so I am I am a young adult author of LGBTQ stories and we are part of the rise

1468
01:45:12,100 --> 01:45:16,980
of book bands and I'm part of all the don't say gay and all the groomer talk.

1469
01:45:16,980 --> 01:45:17,980
So there's a lot of that.

1470
01:45:17,980 --> 01:45:21,660
So it's very delightful that like a few short years earlier he sort of set the stage for

1471
01:45:21,660 --> 01:45:27,360
like yes it'll just sort of sort of mix the word cloud in people's minds of like coming

1472
01:45:27,360 --> 01:45:28,860
out and allegations.

1473
01:45:28,860 --> 01:45:29,860
Oh yes.

1474
01:45:29,860 --> 01:45:31,860
That's great and underage.

1475
01:45:31,860 --> 01:45:35,060
Most people just aren't really paying to check down not really paying attention.

1476
01:45:35,060 --> 01:45:39,780
They just go I remember him coming out like some yeah he did something.

1477
01:45:39,780 --> 01:45:40,780
He did something.

1478
01:45:41,100 --> 01:45:47,180
No matter how many trials overturn things for him you're like you're not going to forgive

1479
01:45:47,180 --> 01:45:53,740
this man for he still did something that he can't take back that is awful.

1480
01:45:53,740 --> 01:45:54,740
Funnily enough no.

1481
01:45:54,740 --> 01:45:55,740
Yeah.

1482
01:45:55,740 --> 01:45:57,740
That's that's actually fascinating.

1483
01:45:57,740 --> 01:46:00,580
That's a very good point.

1484
01:46:00,580 --> 01:46:04,820
But to fictional murders any anything we want to say before we wrap this up it goes away

1485
01:46:04,820 --> 01:46:08,900
Hercules and Zena for a brief time that gets pulled those pretty quick becomes Transformers

1486
01:46:09,020 --> 01:46:14,620
the ride becomes the the the home of the greatest moment in the park sincerity.

1487
01:46:14,620 --> 01:46:15,620
Of course.

1488
01:46:15,620 --> 01:46:16,620
Yeah.

1489
01:46:16,620 --> 01:46:21,380
But and I don't mean to pit you guys against each other but this is like you know one gets

1490
01:46:21,380 --> 01:46:27,940
but very different types of theme park entertainment in the same spot and I know you miss one.

1491
01:46:27,940 --> 01:46:30,820
I don't know how can we all still be friends.

1492
01:46:30,820 --> 01:46:32,860
Well I think so.

1493
01:46:32,860 --> 01:46:37,700
I would just say I was really trying to figure out what would be in a meeting in the middle

1494
01:46:37,780 --> 01:46:38,780
here.

1495
01:46:38,780 --> 01:46:43,940
Well like because you know this is such a classic early universal we talk about they

1496
01:46:43,940 --> 01:46:48,460
brought making the movies with such the theme and that was very interesting to kids some

1497
01:46:48,460 --> 01:46:51,820
kids not every kid but some kids the best one.

1498
01:46:51,820 --> 01:46:52,820
Us.

1499
01:46:52,820 --> 01:46:53,820
Yes.

1500
01:46:53,820 --> 01:46:54,820
We did like that stuff.

1501
01:46:54,820 --> 01:46:58,300
But I was trying to think like is there there's definitely a better murder she wrote ride

1502
01:46:58,300 --> 01:46:59,980
experience than this.

1503
01:46:59,980 --> 01:47:01,780
There has to be.

1504
01:47:01,780 --> 01:47:05,540
So I was trying to figure out what's it going to meeting not maybe it wouldn't still be

1505
01:47:05,580 --> 01:47:11,420
here today but if they had built a ride what do we think that I like that.

1506
01:47:11,420 --> 01:47:15,180
Because I think I think there's there's a case to be made that they still could do this

1507
01:47:15,180 --> 01:47:19,820
because we've been seeing on Screamscape lately they've been talking about doing these pop

1508
01:47:19,820 --> 01:47:24,740
up sort of old attractions and I'm like well it's going to cost so much money to do a pop

1509
01:47:24,740 --> 01:47:25,740
up jaws.

1510
01:47:25,740 --> 01:47:26,740
Sure.

1511
01:47:26,740 --> 01:47:28,740
How little would it cost to do a pop up murder she wrote.

1512
01:47:28,740 --> 01:47:33,340
You would have I know you have gay guys around the block like you for sure would like again

1513
01:47:33,340 --> 01:47:34,500
you have like just tons of people.

1514
01:47:34,540 --> 01:47:38,500
I feel like there's like that like the fan base of the show has maintained.

1515
01:47:38,500 --> 01:47:44,420
So I feel like you could do like a pleasant maze.

1516
01:47:44,420 --> 01:47:45,420
Sure.

1517
01:47:45,420 --> 01:47:46,420
Yeah.

1518
01:47:46,420 --> 01:47:47,420
With a little.

1519
01:47:47,420 --> 01:47:48,420
You could do some scares.

1520
01:47:48,420 --> 01:47:49,420
Yeah.

1521
01:47:49,420 --> 01:47:51,940
Like there's sort of old trickery happening there.

1522
01:47:51,940 --> 01:47:54,020
But yeah I feel like you can get her in her.

1523
01:47:54,020 --> 01:47:59,740
They look if you had enough like street performers in the classic trench with the flashlight

1524
01:47:59,740 --> 01:48:02,740
which is they kind of have her kind of in a lot.

1525
01:48:02,980 --> 01:48:05,420
Is she not kind of bike around town.

1526
01:48:05,420 --> 01:48:06,420
That's not very active.

1527
01:48:06,420 --> 01:48:10,340
So we got like maybe bike ride vehicles is the way to go.

1528
01:48:10,340 --> 01:48:11,340
OK.

1529
01:48:11,340 --> 01:48:12,340
Yeah.

1530
01:48:12,340 --> 01:48:13,340
It's not.

1531
01:48:13,340 --> 01:48:14,340
Maybe you keep that open air.

1532
01:48:14,340 --> 01:48:17,460
Maybe you build a little outdoor or take over in here in Hollywood.

1533
01:48:17,460 --> 01:48:20,220
You could just have that be in actual Cabot Cove.

1534
01:48:20,220 --> 01:48:21,220
Sure.

1535
01:48:21,220 --> 01:48:22,220
Yeah.

1536
01:48:22,220 --> 01:48:23,220
I would absolutely.

1537
01:48:23,220 --> 01:48:26,860
I can if you did if you took over the Cabot Cove area because it's really right now they

1538
01:48:26,860 --> 01:48:27,860
do the shark jaws.

1539
01:48:27,860 --> 01:48:28,860
Yeah.

1540
01:48:28,980 --> 01:48:33,980
But then I think but then the shark is sort of like foreground all the Cabot Cove stuff

1541
01:48:33,980 --> 01:48:34,980
is background.

1542
01:48:34,980 --> 01:48:35,980
You got enough room.

1543
01:48:35,980 --> 01:48:39,180
You could have people like you could have.

1544
01:48:39,180 --> 01:48:40,460
It would interfere with it.

1545
01:48:40,460 --> 01:48:41,460
Exactly.

1546
01:48:41,460 --> 01:48:42,460
Because people completely separate.

1547
01:48:42,460 --> 01:48:43,460
Yeah.

1548
01:48:43,460 --> 01:48:45,180
And then you have the tram folks going.

1549
01:48:45,180 --> 01:48:46,820
Shark keeps attacking.

1550
01:48:46,820 --> 01:48:51,660
You know they don't that sound doesn't have to travel and you can have these sort of frankly

1551
01:48:51,660 --> 01:48:58,660
you could do like an immersive Wizarding World type where you're just sure Cabot Cove.

1552
01:48:59,460 --> 01:49:00,460
Right.

1553
01:49:00,460 --> 01:49:02,220
And just you know we're all you know theme parks are going.

1554
01:49:02,220 --> 01:49:03,220
We're not doing rides anymore.

1555
01:49:03,220 --> 01:49:07,700
We're doing seemed restaurants and pubs and those sorts of things.

1556
01:49:07,700 --> 01:49:08,700
True.

1557
01:49:08,700 --> 01:49:09,700
So fish houses.

1558
01:49:09,700 --> 01:49:10,700
Fish houses.

1559
01:49:10,700 --> 01:49:11,700
Lobster houses.

1560
01:49:11,700 --> 01:49:17,700
Do sort of like all those sort of like you know you know just sort of down east Maine

1561
01:49:17,700 --> 01:49:19,060
you know sort of sort of stuff.

1562
01:49:19,060 --> 01:49:21,860
And if I don't see in theme parks there's not a lot of that.

1563
01:49:21,860 --> 01:49:22,860
Like here's the Maine.

1564
01:49:22,860 --> 01:49:23,860
Yeah.

1565
01:49:23,860 --> 01:49:24,860
Right.

1566
01:49:24,860 --> 01:49:25,860
Sure.

1567
01:49:26,580 --> 01:49:29,100
What's that like the Columbia Harbor House type like food.

1568
01:49:29,100 --> 01:49:30,100
Yeah.

1569
01:49:30,100 --> 01:49:34,020
Where you're like oh yeah you go in there and it's all just like nautical and woodsy

1570
01:49:34,020 --> 01:49:36,060
and you could kind of do that.

1571
01:49:36,060 --> 01:49:41,060
And then some walk around Jessica Fletcher's or kind of interact with you like have you

1572
01:49:41,060 --> 01:49:45,260
seen I'm looking for I'm looking for you know I'm looking for the sheriff.

1573
01:49:45,260 --> 01:49:46,460
I have some information.

1574
01:49:46,460 --> 01:49:50,740
You could do like a Nazi's ghost town alive or something immersive like that where if

1575
01:49:50,780 --> 01:49:56,300
want to participate you can sort of run around town all day and help her solve things.

1576
01:49:56,300 --> 01:49:57,300
But if you just want to eat lobster rolls.

1577
01:49:57,300 --> 01:49:59,380
But if you just want to eat a lobster roll great.

1578
01:49:59,380 --> 01:50:01,140
They'll give you a necklace.

1579
01:50:01,140 --> 01:50:06,340
They'll give you a necklace who you don't want to engage with Jessica Fletcher.

1580
01:50:06,340 --> 01:50:07,340
It lights up.

1581
01:50:07,340 --> 01:50:08,340
It lights up.

1582
01:50:08,340 --> 01:50:09,340
It lights up.

1583
01:50:09,340 --> 01:50:12,660
Sort of like a Fogo to Chow thing where you like flip it to red if you just don't want

1584
01:50:12,660 --> 01:50:13,660
to die.

1585
01:50:13,660 --> 01:50:14,660
Exactly.

1586
01:50:14,660 --> 01:50:15,660
Yeah.

1587
01:50:15,660 --> 01:50:16,660
You don't want to keep walking.

1588
01:50:16,660 --> 01:50:17,660
Leave the mysteries to you.

1589
01:50:17,660 --> 01:50:18,660
That would be great.

1590
01:50:19,580 --> 01:50:22,700
If they did do like a murder she wrote Dark Ride.

1591
01:50:22,700 --> 01:50:31,100
I think we've seen how you can adapt a TV show well with the ride in Europe based on

1592
01:50:31,100 --> 01:50:33,820
the Swedish hit Vipa Salt Kraken.

1593
01:50:33,820 --> 01:50:34,820
Oh yeah.

1594
01:50:34,820 --> 01:50:35,820
That was a pandemic one.

1595
01:50:35,820 --> 01:50:36,820
That was a pandemic episode.

1596
01:50:36,820 --> 01:50:37,820
Yeah.

1597
01:50:37,820 --> 01:50:38,820
Vipa Salt Kraken.

1598
01:50:38,820 --> 01:50:43,940
I'm getting submerged from the fog.

1599
01:50:43,940 --> 01:50:48,580
I purposely placed over all of those memories but I'm very happy that that's been raised.

1600
01:50:49,500 --> 01:50:54,300
It seems like a very pleasant ride, a similar setting, not a ton of conflict.

1601
01:50:54,300 --> 01:50:55,300
Yeah.

1602
01:50:55,300 --> 01:50:59,780
There's a little just a smattering of conflict but it's just about being with your pals from

1603
01:50:59,780 --> 01:51:00,780
TV.

1604
01:51:00,780 --> 01:51:05,540
An animatronic Jessica in three or four minutes could easily start with a mystery and solve

1605
01:51:05,540 --> 01:51:07,020
it by the end of the ride.

1606
01:51:07,020 --> 01:51:08,020
Yeah.

1607
01:51:08,020 --> 01:51:09,020
Yeah.

1608
01:51:09,020 --> 01:51:10,580
And then like oh and I couldn't have done it without you.

1609
01:51:10,580 --> 01:51:12,940
Your bravery saved my case.

1610
01:51:12,940 --> 01:51:13,940
I'm telling you.

1611
01:51:13,940 --> 01:51:14,940
Freedom Fletcher.

1612
01:51:15,300 --> 01:51:21,900
Even if she was like I'm Angela Lansbury, this is all a TV show, I would be even more

1613
01:51:21,900 --> 01:51:22,900
happy about that.

1614
01:51:22,900 --> 01:51:26,300
You could do the thank you for executive producing my show.

1615
01:51:26,300 --> 01:51:31,460
Like please I kind of need that hit back in my life.

1616
01:51:31,460 --> 01:51:35,020
Watching that video again really brought that back where I'm like I did need to hear that

1617
01:51:35,020 --> 01:51:37,740
again that she was very delighted that I'm going to produce her show.

1618
01:51:37,740 --> 01:51:44,900
Well then let me say how about we amend the end of the episode and I say Adam says thank

1619
01:51:44,900 --> 01:51:47,620
you for executive producing our show.

1620
01:51:47,620 --> 01:51:48,620
Oh my god.

1621
01:51:48,620 --> 01:51:53,060
It feels justified because you brought so much to the table.

1622
01:51:53,060 --> 01:51:54,060
You knew so much.

1623
01:51:54,060 --> 01:51:58,180
You filled in gaps of knowledge that we all had because it's getting a little bit lost

1624
01:51:58,180 --> 01:51:59,180
to the sands of time.

1625
01:51:59,180 --> 01:52:03,140
I brought the frog DNA to the dino DNA that was necessary.

1626
01:52:03,140 --> 01:52:04,140
Yes.

1627
01:52:04,140 --> 01:52:05,140
The missing piece.

1628
01:52:05,140 --> 01:52:06,140
Right.

1629
01:52:06,140 --> 01:52:07,140
You filled it in.

1630
01:52:07,140 --> 01:52:08,140
But the regular one too.

1631
01:52:08,140 --> 01:52:11,660
You survived podcast the ride and what an absolute delight.

1632
01:52:11,660 --> 01:52:14,260
Like this is it's an ideal kind of episode.

1633
01:52:14,660 --> 01:52:18,060
Another thing to put into the world when we run into these things where like it's the

1634
01:52:18,060 --> 01:52:22,980
hard pitch on something that nobody's ever brought up as I want to do that and not even

1635
01:52:22,980 --> 01:52:23,980
as anybody's runner.

1636
01:52:23,980 --> 01:52:25,900
It's never been on a list and you come in.

1637
01:52:25,900 --> 01:52:29,180
I love murder she wrote mystery theater.

1638
01:52:29,180 --> 01:52:32,300
I will bring the passion about it and it's just what you did.

1639
01:52:32,300 --> 01:52:33,500
I really appreciate it.

1640
01:52:33,500 --> 01:52:38,100
I could not have been more delighted to get a response on that.

1641
01:52:38,100 --> 01:52:40,340
That was very very cool.

1642
01:52:40,420 --> 01:52:46,100
This was yeah this was definitely a shooting my shot moment that was that I'm that again

1643
01:52:46,100 --> 01:52:49,420
I'm glad I quieted that scared.

1644
01:52:49,420 --> 01:52:52,780
Don't raise your hand for superstar TV kid inside me.

1645
01:52:52,780 --> 01:52:54,660
It was like don't get involved.

1646
01:52:54,660 --> 01:52:59,580
Everyone will see everyone will know you DM your favorite show and didn't get a response.

1647
01:52:59,580 --> 01:53:00,940
No this was very cool.

1648
01:53:00,940 --> 01:53:01,940
This is very cool.

1649
01:53:01,940 --> 01:53:09,660
And I knew I also listening to these I knew you were making your way through all the OG

1650
01:53:09,740 --> 01:53:14,700
Orlando and you want to see it go away without your circular you were circling and I knew

1651
01:53:14,700 --> 01:53:18,940
that there was like maybe not a ton of like because I knew there was a ton of knowledge

1652
01:53:18,940 --> 01:53:22,580
out there that existed like to research.

1653
01:53:22,580 --> 01:53:27,220
And there was important stuff outside of that.

1654
01:53:27,220 --> 01:53:33,580
And and yeah is this the first was this the first attraction universal closed permanently

1655
01:53:33,580 --> 01:53:34,580
in 96.

1656
01:53:34,580 --> 01:53:36,420
God was it.

1657
01:53:36,420 --> 01:53:41,180
It's also something we didn't say it also has the reputation of like it was it was an

1658
01:53:41,180 --> 01:53:44,860
opening day attraction and one of the only ones that worked because all of those big

1659
01:53:44,860 --> 01:53:48,460
robotics based ones were really fucked up technically.

1660
01:53:48,460 --> 01:53:51,500
But this one like I think it's the same producer.

1661
01:53:51,500 --> 01:53:55,260
Yeah as maybe Hitchcock or maybe one of the other or maybe the horror show.

1662
01:53:55,260 --> 01:53:56,260
I'm not sure.

1663
01:53:56,260 --> 01:54:01,860
But like it was like this this one woman like well for real her stuff ran perfectly.

1664
01:54:01,900 --> 01:54:07,340
I think Spielberg has a lot to thank after he cut the big film strip with the scissors

1665
01:54:07,340 --> 01:54:11,980
and then like everything sort of felt all the big tech stuff that was right flashy flopped

1666
01:54:11,980 --> 01:54:12,980
you know.

1667
01:54:12,980 --> 01:54:19,180
But this is about that's about personalities the actors in the room local landsbury helps

1668
01:54:19,180 --> 01:54:22,580
actors this is about this attraction is about people.

1669
01:54:22,580 --> 01:54:27,300
It's about people and I like as we're getting back to that as a film industry it's a film

1670
01:54:27,300 --> 01:54:28,980
and television industry.

1671
01:54:28,980 --> 01:54:34,940
We are hopefully returning to that place where there is it is more people centric a little

1672
01:54:34,940 --> 01:54:36,540
bit more.

1673
01:54:36,540 --> 01:54:40,220
I think it's I think it's the perfect way to to start off a haunt cast.

1674
01:54:40,220 --> 01:54:41,220
I could not have been more delighted.

1675
01:54:41,220 --> 01:54:42,220
I hope so.

1676
01:54:42,220 --> 01:54:45,620
I should have said you survived haunt cast the fright and I should say look I'm just

1677
01:54:45,620 --> 01:54:48,740
spitballing let's exit through the crypt shop.

1678
01:54:48,740 --> 01:54:49,740
OK.

1679
01:54:49,740 --> 01:54:50,740
Oh yeah.

1680
01:54:50,740 --> 01:54:52,580
You would like to plug.

1681
01:54:52,580 --> 01:54:53,580
Yes.

1682
01:54:54,300 --> 01:54:58,580
My newest YA novel is called Your Lonely Nights Are Over.

1683
01:54:58,580 --> 01:55:01,620
It is I'm pitching it as Scream Meets Clueless.

1684
01:55:01,620 --> 01:55:03,740
It is a teen slasher.

1685
01:55:03,740 --> 01:55:08,580
It is if you see if you if you look up the cover it is basically my notes were like do

1686
01:55:08,580 --> 01:55:17,100
Fear Street do Christopher Pike and it's channeling that sort of like 90s teen thriller.

1687
01:55:17,100 --> 01:55:22,580
It's sort of like a lost Kevin Williamson 90s slasher film.

1688
01:55:22,620 --> 01:55:31,380
But it involves two gay best friends Deary and Cole who are at war essentially with their

1689
01:55:31,380 --> 01:55:38,260
larger LGBTQ queer club in high school because like in Clueless Deary and Cole are sort of

1690
01:55:38,260 --> 01:55:43,780
like popular and funny and hot and the rest of them they call they call them the flops

1691
01:55:43,780 --> 01:55:48,460
and they are all to them they're like oh you're just jealous and so there's these and the

1692
01:55:48,460 --> 01:55:52,540
flops are basically like oh well you're not really involved in the queer club you're not

1693
01:55:53,020 --> 01:55:56,700
raising money you're not raising awareness you don't come to the meetings and they're

1694
01:55:56,700 --> 01:56:01,020
very like you know kind of livid about that so it just becomes this sort of like who's

1695
01:56:01,020 --> 01:56:06,900
the better queer person sort of fight which is very very queer community right now.

1696
01:56:06,900 --> 01:56:10,460
There's a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of dark satire about how I feel about being in

1697
01:56:10,460 --> 01:56:11,460
the queer community right now.

1698
01:56:11,460 --> 01:56:13,420
The idea of like fracturing.

1699
01:56:13,420 --> 01:56:16,860
Well it's like who's bad for the community who's good for the community and why.

1700
01:56:16,940 --> 01:56:23,580
So there's a lot of intro fighting and it gets all very nice and juicy and cutthroat

1701
01:56:23,580 --> 01:56:29,580
silver tongue dialogue but then into that drama comes Mr. Sandman who is a masked killer

1702
01:56:29,580 --> 01:56:35,500
who starts targeting members of the queer club they start dropping and so Deary and

1703
01:56:35,500 --> 01:56:41,740
Cole because they have been such enemies to this club are blamed and so Deary and Cole

1704
01:56:41,740 --> 01:56:48,220
basically are like very annoyed that they have to solve this series of slayings because

1705
01:56:48,220 --> 01:56:54,460
if they don't they'll either be next or worse they're gonna probably go down as the killers

1706
01:56:54,460 --> 01:57:00,780
for this so it is yes it is a it is for spooky season I suggest everybody pick it up if you

1707
01:57:00,780 --> 01:57:04,220
like a good because that's the other thing is that I've noticed is that like because

1708
01:57:04,220 --> 01:57:07,900
I know like you know I know you love haunts Mike and I know but like I know like there's

1709
01:57:07,900 --> 01:57:14,060
some type of like uh you know Halloween time I've noticed people sort of go into two camps of

1710
01:57:14,060 --> 01:57:18,780
horror like the movies they watch or the kind of stuff they read there's like the the hardcore

1711
01:57:18,780 --> 01:57:22,860
types who are like I'm watching uh all the gory stuff I'm watching Saw I'm watching you know

1712
01:57:22,860 --> 01:57:26,140
Hellraiser I'm watching all this stuff and then there's sort of this other group over here very

1713
01:57:26,140 --> 01:57:32,380
valid still that's like I will watch um Nightmare Before Christmas I will watch Halloween Town

1714
01:57:32,860 --> 01:57:39,740
and I will watch maybe one scream and scream seems to be the sort of like connector between the two

1715
01:57:39,740 --> 01:57:46,460
factions I've noticed literally I have I've never seen scream and I have a DVD library copy right

1716
01:57:46,460 --> 01:57:53,340
now so I'm about to go into screen I am so excited it's really good it's it's great it's like

1717
01:57:53,340 --> 01:57:57,420
because the thing that makes it different than like an 80s like a Freddy or a Jason or Michael

1718
01:57:57,420 --> 01:58:02,620
Myers is um it's well a it's sort of like a speaking of Jessica Fletcher it's a whodunit

1719
01:58:02,620 --> 01:58:07,900
the screen movies are always like the killer is someone you have met it's it really is an

1720
01:58:07,900 --> 01:58:13,180
Agatha Christie sort of thing but it's like it's it's and it's got a slickness to it that I think

1721
01:58:13,180 --> 01:58:19,580
helps make the horror of it go down for folks who don't usually like fuck with horror oh oh this

1722
01:58:19,580 --> 01:58:23,900
might be a good gateway for me I think so because like it's basically like it's sort of like

1723
01:58:23,900 --> 01:58:28,780
like one third horror and blood I mean it is bloody and scary but then like it's two

1724
01:58:28,780 --> 01:58:35,660
thirds humor so like it's just great it's a funny thing uh you know Wes Craven made the first four

1725
01:58:36,220 --> 01:58:41,980
and uh then he passed but then you know they're they're been keeping that going and uh they're

1726
01:58:41,980 --> 01:58:46,620
just incredibly slick they're full of just great performances um and that's kind of what I what I

1727
01:58:46,620 --> 01:58:52,300
wanted to do with Your Only Nights Are Over was um I realized that like this wasn't falling into

1728
01:58:52,300 --> 01:58:59,180
the same like oh god this this this movie again uh was with Scream because you loved the characters

1729
01:58:59,180 --> 01:59:03,740
so much you were having recurring characters and it was the characters and the people and the humor

1730
01:59:03,740 --> 01:59:09,260
that made you feel kind of safe within the scary stuff and so I really wanted to do that in this

1731
01:59:09,260 --> 01:59:13,500
book where it was like there's a lot of like bodies are dropping there is a lot of there's

1732
01:59:13,500 --> 01:59:19,580
there's some gore there's some scares there's some dread um it's but it is just a very kind of slick

1733
01:59:19,580 --> 01:59:24,860
funny Halloween time and they're kind of like your best friends and you're like oh my best

1734
01:59:24,860 --> 01:59:30,060
friends are here I feel fine and I'm laughing and I'm not too and I'm never too scared and I'm but

1735
01:59:30,060 --> 01:59:36,380
I'm scared for them so I wanted to hit that sort of note and uh I feel that I have done that so

1736
01:59:36,380 --> 01:59:41,020
yeah you can pick that up anyway sounds great yeah well congrats to you on having it out there and

1771
02:03:11,500 --> 02:03:16,540

1772
02:03:18,860 --> 02:03:24,540
and I used to live in long beach like across the bay from the queen mary and I was like you can
