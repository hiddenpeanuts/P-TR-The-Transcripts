1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Warning, the following podcast may contain confusing meat-based analogies, Texas tombs

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,560
available for easy online purchase, and the entrapment of annoying teens who probably had

5
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:18,560
it coming.

6
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:25,400
Jury duty's Andrew Weinberg whisks us to a true fantasy land, Scotch Plains, New Jersey.

7
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:49,400
It's Bowcraft Amusement Park on Podcast the Ride.

8
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:54,400
Welcome to Podcast the Ride, a podcast about theme parks, but also about the treachery of

9
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:58,320
communism, the beast that wants to suck America dry.

10
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:04,640
I'm patriot Scott Gardner, joined by the equally concerned Jason Sheridan.

11
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,120
That's right, at ease, soldier.

12
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:10,280
They can't get us here in the garage.

13
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:16,000
When we release this recording though, they might listen and learn what we say.

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Be careful where we release it.

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,800
Mike Carlson, equally vigilant.

16
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,800
Hi.

17
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:26,440
I will stay on a tilt-a-whirl all night until I know everything is safe.

18
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,800
The world is safe from communism.

19
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,240
So that's like my anti-protest.

20
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:38,920
Yeah, that's the last mention of safe that will be said on this episode.

21
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,320
That's fair.

22
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:46,600
These hopefully are enticing previews about today's topic, a park that you may not know

23
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:52,600
I feel like there's like three to five listeners who are like, wait, what?

24
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:58,080
When this showed up in the feed, like probably Jersey natives.

25
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:01,800
They're doing this and I'm excited we're doing this.

26
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:08,080
It comes to us from Jersey native and amazing comedy writer, one of the greats from the

27
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,920
history of Late Night with Conan O'Brien, the co-creator of the legendary series Eagle

28
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,920
Hearts.

29
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,920
That's right.

30
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:22,040
And now one of the folks behind the very funny reality bending comedy.

31
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,040
Is that fair?

32
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,040
It's not.

33
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,040
Oh, here.

34
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,040
Well, I'll let you.

35
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,040
The show is called Jury Duty.

36
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,040
I didn't want to call it a prank show.

37
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,040
Exactly.

38
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,040
Okay.

39
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,040
Okay.

40
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,040
That's that would be verbose.

41
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:36,280
Jury Duty is the name of the show, which is out now on free V. It's Andrew Weinberg.

42
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,280
What's going on?

43
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,280
Hello.

44
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,280
Hi.

45
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,280
Thanks for having me.

46
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:45,880
Thank you so much for doing this and for bringing us this place that we did not know.

47
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,840
Okay.

48
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:53,560
I'll dive in and say we've known each other for a while now, worked together in various

49
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:58,560
forms, but I have never, for some reason I didn't, I never like put you in the theme

50
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,560
park box.

51
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,760
It did not occur to me to have you on the show.

52
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,760
What percentage of the general public is outside the theme park box?

53
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,360
Oh, that's a good question.

54
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:11,160
Well, I think there's boxes within the box.

55
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:14,120
Yeah, there's different boxes and this is, we don't have time for this.

56
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,360
We don't have time to discuss what kind of box we are.

57
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,200
We cannot discuss the hierarchy of the box.

58
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,200
Yeah.

59
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,080
You know, like attending and visiting and enjoying or tolerating a theme park is one

60
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:29,800
thing, but then like, you know, knowing the names of every street and fake area and type

61
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,760
of trash can that's ever been, you know, these are the depths of the box.

62
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,760
Right.

63
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,760
That we sit in.

64
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,880
Everyone's a little bit in the box though, cause like we had an engineer in New York

65
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,320
who did our live show at the Bell House and he didn't seem like a theme park guy, but

66
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:46,720
We talked about Mars 2112 and he came up and he was like, I remember that place.

67
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,720
Like there's always going to be that.

68
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,720
Yeah.

69
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:53,440
So that's the biggest box is somebody who just goes, I remember that.

70
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,440
Yeah.

71
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:58,600
But somewhat rare in that I worked at a theme park.

72
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,600
Yeah, yes.

73
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,600
Indeed.

74
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:05,520
Well, this is why I feel like a fool for not asking you previously discovering that you

75
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,520
are in fact a charmer.

76
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:11,480
I've been following laughing at your foolishness all these years.

77
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,800
More than I've wanted to be on the show.

78
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,280
One day it's going to hit him like a ton of bricks.

79
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,280
This idiot.

80
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,720
Well, that's look, that's me now.

81
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:27,480
Here I am eating crow and saying, I'm so delighted to have you knowing that the writing, whatever,

82
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:35,920
but the legacy of a seasonal employee for Bo craft amusement park in New Jersey.

83
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,800
Now I'm interested.

84
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,920
Tell us about Bo craft and your time there a little bit.

85
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:50,000
OK, so I grew up in Mountainside, New Jersey, Union County on route 22.

86
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,360
That's our main.

87
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,360
It's one.

88
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,360
It's not like a freeway.

89
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,840
We don't call them freeways there.

90
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:02,720
OK, we call them highways or and we call them route or route route 22 route 78.

91
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,560
And Jason, feel free to corroborate any of these Jersey isms.

92
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,560
Are you?

93
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,560
Where are you from?

94
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,680
I grew up outside of Philadelphia, but I spent a lot of time in South Jersey.

95
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,680
Sure.

96
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,680
And a family down there.

97
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,680
Me too.

98
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,680
Did you go to the shore?

99
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,680
Yeah, we went down the shore.

100
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,000
Where did you go?

101
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,440
We would go to Ocean City.

102
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,440
OK, so Gillian's Wonder Pier.

103
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,440
Gillian's.

104
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,440
Well, yeah, is it Wonderland?

105
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,280
Those pier, even though it's not on a pier, it is not on a pier.

106
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,280
It's called Wonderland.

107
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,280
Yeah, could be wrong.

108
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,520
But yeah, the Gillian family is like well entrenched in ocean.

109
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,480
Like the current mayor is a Gillian.

110
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,480
Really?

111
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:41,320
There was a mayor before him.

112
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,080
I hate to butt in here on the website.

113
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,880
It says Gillian's Wonderland Pier.

114
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,320
Oh, so that's a total tie.

115
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,320
Yeah, both.

116
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,320
Wow.

117
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,080
And too many words, too many things.

118
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,080
A little too complicated.

119
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,360
So yeah, we used to go to the shore just north of there, halfway to Atlantic City called

120
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,080
Margate, where the elephant is where Lucy is.

121
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,080
Yeah.

122
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,080
Yeah.

123
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,080
And so I spent a lot of time on the Ocean City boardwalk.

124
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,080
Wait, what's Lucy?

125
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,080
Lucy is a giant.

126
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,000
And I'm amazed we haven't done a second gate on Lucy.

127
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,280
Lucy is like a multi-story tall elephant.

128
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,400
It's like 50 feet tall.

129
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,200
And it was a hotel at one point.

130
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,200
Yeah.

131
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,200
It was a hotel.

132
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,000
I think it was an eccentric man's house at one point.

133
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,480
They moved it several blocks.

134
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:24,240
Yeah, it survived a number of hurricanes.

135
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,040
It's been moved a few times.

136
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,040
To rock.

137
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,040
Yes.

138
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:31,320
In the mid 20th century.

139
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,320
This is a museum.

140
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,840
You can still go to it.

141
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,040
And yeah, they saved Lucy.

142
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,040
How weighty.

143
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,240
This doesn't seem like big enough.

144
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,240
How many rooms could this hotel have?

145
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,240
Not that many.

146
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,680
People were smaller then.

147
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:48,120
And they were willing to share bathrooms.

148
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,840
You just pee down the trunk.

149
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,840
Yeah.

150
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,840
Let's go.

151
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,840
Yeah.

152
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,040
You have any number of release valves with an animal anatomy.

153
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,040
Yes.

154
00:06:56,040 --> 00:07:00,880
By the 90s, it was mostly like come take a tour, visit the gift shop, that sort of thing.

155
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,880
Which I did.

156
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,880
Yeah.

157
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:10,960
But Gillian, my greatest memory there is, what do you call the Ferris wheel where the

158
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,720
cars are attached at the front and back and the...

159
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,680
Oh shit, that's exactly what you told me.

160
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,680
Okay.

161
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,680
You have any spoon?

162
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,680
That's all right.

163
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:22,280
Well, we also should have cleared the space for justiculation.

164
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,280
Yeah, that's true.

165
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,280
Justiculation zone.

166
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,280
We should have known you were going to come to like...

167
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:30,600
So the Ferris wheel car, you're in a cage, that's like a roof, and the cars are attached

168
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,560
to the front and back and they spin side.

169
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,560
We have like a steering wheel and they spin sideways so they loop upside down.

170
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,680
It's not the zipper.

171
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,920
The zipper is like the oblong one.

172
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,800
Everywhere kind of causes something different.

173
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:49,600
There's a ride at the park, at Bowcraft, that we always just called, no matter what it was

174
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:53,000
called, we always just called it the Himalayas.

175
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,600
And it's just a ride that kind of goes up and down hills.

176
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,920
And it goes behind a backdrop from part of it.

177
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,920
Yeah.

178
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:06,920
The main important part of the ride is that pop music has played like eardrum shatteringly

179
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,920
loud.

180
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,920
Yeah.

181
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,920
Is that the one with...

182
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:13,560
There's like rock stars painted on it.

183
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,560
Sometimes there's rock stars or there's snowmen.

184
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,600
Or Marine or his master put Batman.

185
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:23,040
What you realize is these are basic rides or basic shapes and they're modular.

186
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,040
Yeah.

187
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,920
And you can add the rock stars or yetis.

188
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,920
Yeah, yeah.

189
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,920
Or both.

190
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,440
Or like all the jokers on one wall.

191
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,440
Yeah.

192
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,440
Every joker.

193
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,440
Yeah.

194
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,440
Like airbrushed.

195
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,440
Airbrushed too.

196
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:39,200
As long as that's the only through line between all of them is airbrushed.

197
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,200
Oh, airbrushed.

198
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,200
Yeah.

199
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,720
I mean, if it's Jersey, if you go further up there, if you go to like Wildwood or Seaside

200
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,720
Heights, then it might be airbrushed.

201
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,720
Yeah.

202
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,880
Tony Soprano, Scarface.

203
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,840
When you think of Jersey Shore, you're thinking up there.

204
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,400
What we're talking about is more of a Philly crowd.

205
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,400
Yes.

206
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:01,480
But you're from North is where we're talking.

207
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,480
That kind of trash.

208
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,480
Not clarified types of trash.

209
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,920
Yeah, we're different kinds of trash.

210
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,920
We respect each other.

211
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:09,920
Yeah.

212
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,920
But we don't often interact.

213
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,920
Except that like christenings.

214
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,920
Yeah.

215
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,920
I feel like.

216
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,920
So this is very special.

217
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:17,920
The two of you were facing each other.

218
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,920
Bar mitzvahs or christenings.

219
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:19,920
Yeah.

220
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,680
A rare piece of chords between types of trade.

221
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,680
That's right.

222
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,680
That's right.

223
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:29,240
Bocaft is in like it's in a similar neck of the woods to.

224
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:32,640
Bocaft is in Scotch Plains, New Jersey, next to Mountside.

225
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:37,160
It is a by definition a roadside amusement park.

226
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:42,640
They had like we're talking about those kind of just modular rides that go around in a

227
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,640
circle.

228
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,640
Some of them are flat circles.

229
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,360
Some of them are tilted circles.

230
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,360
So elevated circles are a treat.

231
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,240
Or the Himalayan was like a sort of a wavy circle.

232
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,240
Right.

233
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,240
Every type of circle.

234
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,240
Yeah.

235
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,520
Ferris wheel, which is a vertical circle.

236
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:59,700
Circle tipped on its side.

237
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,700
From hell.

238
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,700
On steroids.

239
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:04,700
Yeah.

240
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:07,600
Not your daddy's.

241
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:13,040
So and then they had a little bit bigger the next level of like the spider.

242
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,800
You know what that is.

243
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,520
I don't think I can picture a spider.

244
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,520
I know.

245
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,520
Yeah.

246
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,140
My dad and I got stuck on a spider once.

247
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:22,400
With the arms and then it kind of goes up and down.

248
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,400
But it also spins.

249
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:31,080
So it spins in a circle while arms with pods at the end go up and down and you spin within

250
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,080
that.

251
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,280
Again, spinning is the key.

252
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:39,680
It's kind of like Dumbo if you were like on a big spider instead of Dumbo cars.

253
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,120
If you could spin Dumbo in a circle.

254
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,680
That would kind of be like this.

255
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,680
Yeah.

256
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,680
Yeah.

257
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,680
Good.

258
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,680
We never talked about.

259
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,680
And there was a scrambler.

260
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,360
I feel like that has multiple regional names.

261
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,360
I'm looking on the website.

262
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,360
We call it a scrambler.

263
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,360
This is just called Scram.

264
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,360
OK.

265
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,360
OK.

266
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,360
It's both the ride type and the ride name.

267
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,880
It seems like they would combine them in some cases.

268
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,160
In this particular place.

269
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:08,040
It's like the Q-tip or Xerox of the.

270
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:11,600
It's at the brand or what we've just come to call it.

271
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:17,360
I was a ride operator for two maybe three summers.

272
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,360
Wow.

273
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,600
I just did the basic level rides.

274
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,040
I was only certified for that.

275
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,040
No certification whatsoever.

276
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,040
Yeah.

277
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,040
I was going to say.

278
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:32,800
That was part of it is like you were given basic information about how you can turn the

279
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,880
ride on and off.

280
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,120
And that was about it.

281
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,120
Wow.

282
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,120
So.

283
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:41,320
This has to be a little more nuanced than on and off.

284
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,320
Usually.

285
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,320
I mean, I don't know.

286
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,320
Yes.

287
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:50,680
I guess because they thought the potential for injury was low, there wasn't like you

288
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:54,680
need to like drill these procedures.

289
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,320
Sure.

290
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,320
So most of them.

291
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,320
OK.

292
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,320
If you want me to get into the mechanics.

293
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,320
Yeah.

294
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,080
Get us under the hood.

295
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,080
OK.

296
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,520
So most of the rides like OK.

297
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:13,560
They boats which were spinning boats on a going around a circle like pony rides on the

298
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,560
circle.

299
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,560
Sure.

300
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:18,160
Kitty boats seems to be the name for anyone keeping track.

301
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,160
Yes.

302
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,160
So I would do that.

303
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,080
I did the motorcycles which same deal.

304
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:26,520
But they were motorcycles just on like a metal platform.

305
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:33,360
But at one point there was a ramp and the motor so go up and then back down.

306
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,360
That's pretty good.

307
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,360
That's advanced.

308
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,400
Well, no, it's not the scrambler.

309
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:41,480
The scrambler I did do and that was there was like more you had to do.

310
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,480
They were like gears.

311
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,480
Oh, wow.

312
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,120
And how old were you?

313
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,920
I was 17, 18.

314
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:49,920
OK.

315
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,920
Maybe 19.

316
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:55,360
Previous summer jobs to this shittier jobs than this.

317
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,980
This actually is one of the better summer jobs.

318
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,280
Like retail sucks.

319
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,520
I was I worked at Abercrombie and Fitch one.

320
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,520
Oh, wow.

321
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:13,280
Summer and winter break and I folded clothes for however eight hours, whatever.

322
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,280
Not you.

323
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,280
You weren't sent out shirtless.

324
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,640
I really I was talking about this with someone else.

325
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:27,360
I really don't think this was like 97, 96, 97.

326
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,040
Maybe I don't really think it was that yet.

327
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:38,160
I recall more like, you know, what they call preppy stuff, sweaters with stripes and khakis.

328
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,160
Sure.

329
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,160
Yeah.

330
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,800
I wonder how long they actually had the shirtless guy.

331
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,800
I don't know.

332
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,800
That does feel like a small window.

333
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:47,920
I will say that they did have a like you had to be good looking enough.

334
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,960
And my friend's girlfriend worked there.

335
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:53,960
So she was like, come when I'm there and I'll say you're good looking.

336
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,960
Wow.

337
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:56,880
Wow.

338
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:03,840
Because they write down like a number when they're like whatever application or whatever.

339
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,600
So they would say like you're an eight or something.

340
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,600
I don't think they would tell you, but they'd be like, thanks.

341
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,600
Wow.

342
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,600
Whoa.

343
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,600
Wait a minute.

344
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:17,080
And is that is the is the girlfriend convincing the others or is she one of the scores that

345
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,440
counts in the total tally?

346
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,120
She's like an Olympic judge.

347
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:24,520
She's a judge like vouching for me for whoever will ultimately hire me.

348
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,080
Okay, right.

349
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:33,280
And I don't know like if I it's like a lie that would be easily exposed on day one.

350
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:39,200
I assume that like manager never actually came to the floor.

351
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,200
Yeah.

352
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,640
Sales are down today.

353
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:46,240
The staff is not as attractive as we can get.

354
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:52,000
We're we're all saying this as if I like we're not giving you numbers mentally.

355
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,360
No, I haven't given you a number mentally.

356
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:58,280
But I'm curious, were you offended by the suggestion that you needed the help?

357
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,280
Yes, you need to rig the system.

358
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:05,160
If I'd known that they were looking for that, I would probably not have been like, yeah.

359
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:10,000
Well, she had to be like the trans Abercrombie Fitch was run by the one who could incide

360
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,600
evil and one could speak no evil.

361
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,960
Was it a Les Wexner company?

362
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:15,960
Oh, I don't know.

363
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,080
Oh, is that what you were saying?

364
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,080
No, no.

365
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,080
Okay.

366
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,720
So other job.

367
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:27,120
Yeah, I worked my friends.

368
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:36,240
His family was like had these all marine industries like salvage and like scrap yard.

369
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,800
There's a they use it for sets a lot in Staten Island.

370
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,760
There's like a ship graveyard.

371
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,120
Oh, wow.

372
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,160
And they own that.

373
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,720
So one summer he and I worked for a few weeks.

374
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:55,440
I believe he quit after one week at the family, the company's paint recycling facility on

375
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,440
Staten Island.

376
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,440
Oh, God.

377
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,440
Yeah.

378
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:02,080
Nothing in here sounds great.

379
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,080
And that was yeah.

380
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:06,840
So you know, like when you recycle paint and you drop off your cans wherever, then those

381
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,960
go to a place like this.

382
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:16,520
And someone like me sorts them into like three, one of three basic colors or something in

383
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,160
55 gallon drums.

384
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:25,160
And then so yeah, I did like stuff like that another summer at their like on the docks

385
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:29,480
in Port Newark, like where like welding and stuff happens.

386
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,480
These are real things.

387
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:37,080
I was a laborer.

388
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,400
God for comedy writing.

389
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,400
Yeah.

390
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,400
So Bo Krap was not actually that bad.

391
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,400
Yeah, yeah.

392
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,400
Oh, seemingly.

393
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:46,200
And like easy, easy training.

394
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,200
Yeah, it's certainly.

395
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,200
Yeah.

396
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:53,120
Oh, another person is in no particular order.

397
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,120
Oh, sure.

398
00:16:54,120 --> 00:17:01,440
The uniform was a red and white vertical striped shirt about maybe two inch thick stripes.

399
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,360
And can you picture another place where you see that uniform?

400
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,080
TGI Friday.

401
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,080
Exactly.

402
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,080
Yes.

403
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:16,280
So we went there to the TGI Fridays at the Blue Star Shopping Center after work one day

404
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,200
with my friends who didn't work there.

405
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,000
So I was the only one wearing the red and white striped shirt.

406
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,120
And I honestly didn't like think about it at the time.

407
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,120
Yeah.

408
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:29,680
I was walking into Fridays wearing a Friday's uniform.

409
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:36,600
And they had me join them in a birthday, you know, singing to a party.

410
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,840
You were just immediately cramped and put to work.

411
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:45,560
That was bucket list moment.

412
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,040
To be part of the excitement.

413
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,600
Friday's staff.

414
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,120
The world's famous Friday's birthday shows.

415
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:57,520
Here's what's weird is that I know that the uniform was red and white striped shirts because

416
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:03,600
I did a little bit of digging and I found a Facebook group about four people who used

417
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,040
to work at Bo Krap.

418
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,040
Really?

419
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:10,000
There were not more than 20 people in this group.

420
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,520
I did not see you active at least.

421
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,520
This is on Facebook?

422
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,520
This is on Facebook.

423
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:18,000
Can I see it if I don't have a Facebook account?

424
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Yeah.

425
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I said, oh wait, no.

426
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,280
I have like a burner account basically.

427
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,280
I did not join.

428
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,280
Yes.

429
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,280
You don't have to join.

430
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,280
Okay.

431
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,280
You have a...

432
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:32,920
You're welcome to use my login to see the group if you want.

433
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:35,760
I think I saw everything that there was to see.

434
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:40,040
I have the highlights and there's four highlights.

435
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,440
One is about the red and white striped shirts.

436
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,440
This is from someone named Dina.

437
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,440
Do you remember Dina?

438
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,440
I don't.

439
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,440
Okay.

440
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,840
Two of the posts are from John.

441
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,840
Do you remember?

442
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:49,840
Oh.

443
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,840
No, John.

444
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,840
I might.

445
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:56,640
I know exactly which John it is too.

446
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,480
Well not Doxam with the laziness.

447
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,200
Say no more.

448
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:08,680
John posted about someone named Gene and how the board needs to have a picture of Gene.

449
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,680
The what?

450
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,680
The message board?

451
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:14,160
I thought you were talking about like there's like a board of directors of BoKraft.

452
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,680
Oh no, no, no, no.

453
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:18,200
The message board is the Facebook group.

454
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:22,560
Do you remember a Gene and did you work for a Gene?

455
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,440
He was in a management position?

456
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,760
It's implied I think.

457
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,760
I honestly wouldn't remember anyone by name.

458
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,040
Probably by face.

459
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,040
Makes sense to me.

460
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,480
You did not meet lifelong friends.

461
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,480
There were not memorable summer friends.

462
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,480
Yeah, we weren't a big family.

463
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,480
At least I was.

464
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:43,360
If everyone else was a big family, I was not part of it.

465
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:49,760
Can you corroborate then something else that John says which is, if someone told me the

466
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:54,720
things that went on at BoKraft, I don't think I'd believe them.

467
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,040
I mean he'd have, John would have to be a little more specific.

468
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,040
Except the Buddhist generic.

469
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:04,800
I never saw orgies or child sacrifice.

470
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:13,400
I did see one ride operator get led away in handcuffs on the job once.

471
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,600
Whoa, what's the story there?

472
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,080
I never found out.

473
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,080
But none of my business.

474
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:22,000
I feel like that was kind of normal.

475
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,080
That kind of employee.

476
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,080
Like what's the employee?

477
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,120
That's like collective employees.

478
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,120
Oh, I see.

479
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:35,120
So like a mildly shady bunch is what you're...

480
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,120
It was a very Jersey.

481
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,120
Yeah.

482
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,120
I was not above that.

483
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,120
Right, right.

484
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,120
And how comforting for the guests of BoKraft.

485
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:47,120
Yeah, so my experience actually operating rides.

486
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:54,120
So the motorcycle one, there are age and height restrictions for like everything.

487
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,120
This is smart.

488
00:20:56,160 --> 00:21:01,160
I didn't put up much of a fight if parents were like, let my kid go on.

489
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,160
Sure, sure.

490
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:05,160
So this is a motorcycle one.

491
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:13,160
They were like, let my possibly walking toddler go on with his older brother.

492
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,160
These were two seaters.

493
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:22,160
Like maybe this is a three step toddler, not a walks on their own.

494
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,160
Yeah.

495
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,200
Well, yeah, I would find out soon.

496
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:32,200
So my other problem is I was not very attentive.

497
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,200
Sure.

498
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,200
So most of these rides would be like an egg timer.

499
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,200
Just twist it till it reached.

500
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:43,200
There was like a peg where it would stop.

501
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,200
And then that starts the ride and shuts it off when it's done.

502
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,200
Okay.

503
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,200
You wouldn't have to shut it off.

504
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,200
The ride would auto shut down.

505
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,200
Yes, yes.

506
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,200
It's jacuzzi bubbles.

507
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,240
But it was like a red button.

508
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,240
Sure.

509
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:01,240
So I'm like, yes, your baby can go on the ride.

510
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,240
Sure.

511
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,240
I don't care.

512
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:10,240
And so I turn on and I'm like just looking at other things.

513
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:15,240
It's like blood curdling scream from the mother.

514
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:19,240
The baby is like clinging for dear life.

515
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,280
Hanging on the side of this motorcycle.

516
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,280
Oh my God.

517
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,280
Which, hey, credit to the baby.

518
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,280
If the baby is old enough to cling, much less for dear life.

519
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:34,280
Old enough to go on this ride.

520
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,280
It doesn't rhyme.

521
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:41,280
This is not the last instance of someone to clinging on for dear life.

522
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,280
Yes.

523
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,280
But I feel like that would be other kids.

524
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:48,280
After each one of these stories, could we live post to the Facebook group?

525
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,320
Does anyone remember a baby clinging to?

526
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,320
Well, they will remember one of them.

527
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,320
Yeah.

528
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,320
But that's a sign.

529
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:57,320
One of them makes it in the New York Times for sure.

530
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,320
A little more publicized than this one.

531
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,320
You were able to keep it quiet until now.

532
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:04,320
It also happened on the Scrambler where these parents were like,

533
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,320
let our one year old, whatever, baby come on with us.

534
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,320
Yeah.

535
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:12,320
And the Scrambler, if you've ever been on it,

536
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:17,320
because I myself as not a baby, because I remember it.

537
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,360
So I had to be at least four.

538
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,360
Four is the cutoff from where adults remember things.

539
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,360
I think so. Yeah, yeah.

540
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:29,360
So I was on it with my sister and it's just like a bench

541
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:32,360
and then the thing that just like swings closed.

542
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:35,360
So other than that, there's nothing keeping you in place.

543
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,360
So I slid down into the wheel well.

544
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,360
Oh my God.

545
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,360
And I'm just bouncing around in there.

546
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,360
And like, I remember that.

547
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,360
Jesus.

548
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,400
Wow.

549
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:48,400
Is that one of the first memories then by like,

550
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,400
is this haunting?

551
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:52,400
Well, that's what made me afraid of metal.

552
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,400
You know how I scream when I see metal.

553
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,400
Oh yes, I've noticed too.

554
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,400
Not fun to drive with me.

555
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,400
A lot of you.

556
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,400
Many, many opportunities.

557
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,400
No, but so then I went on.

558
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:11,400
I know you're like, this is too perfectly crafted a narrative.

559
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,400
No way this is true.

560
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:17,440
I went on to operate the very same scrambler.

561
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,440
It is that one really?

562
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,440
Yes, at Bo Raft.

563
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,440
Oh my God.

564
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:23,440
And yeah, so these parents are like,

565
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,440
we're going on with our baby.

566
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,440
And I look and the kid is like standing on the bench

567
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,440
and the parents are like, I guess holding him.

568
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,440
But like, this is like a pretty fast ride.

569
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,440
Like a baby could get hurt.

570
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,440
Yeah.

571
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,440
I considered it not my responsibility.

572
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,440
You don't own the place.

573
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,480
Yes.

574
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,480
Customers always write.

575
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,480
That's true.

576
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,480
They insisted you craft an experience.

577
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,480
Sorry, I thought service came first.

578
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:57,480
My favorite memory as a ride operator was

579
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:01,480
the aforementioned boats, kiddie boats.

580
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,480
Yeah.

581
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,480
Are you looking up pictures so you get,

582
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,480
it's not that important.

583
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,480
I do have the website.

584
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,480
It just seems like sometimes you are and sometimes you're not.

585
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,520
Yeah, that was a weird.

586
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,520
I'm on and off.

587
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,520
If you'd like me to stay on, I could stay on.

588
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:20,520
A weird discovery that the full website is still active.

589
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:24,520
So for a brief moment, I thought this place was open.

590
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,520
Yeah, it closed a few years ago.

591
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:29,520
Yeah, the Wikipedia page quickly discovers that like,

592
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,520
yeah, closed down in October 2018.

593
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:35,520
But still, yes, there's no indication on the website

594
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,520
anywhere that this is not a place.

595
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:40,560
It's not even like the rides are rotting.

596
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,560
The rides are gone.

597
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:44,560
It's like New Jersey's Space Jam website.

598
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,560
Oh, yeah.

599
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,560
An ancient web artifact.

600
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,560
You were saying.

601
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,560
Now I'm looking at the boats, although it doesn't give me a full,

602
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,560
it's a pretty tight shot.

603
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,560
So if I need to know about the mechanism, I can't.

604
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:59,560
Again, this is a standard egg timer ride.

605
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:03,560
Slow day and these like teenagers, like,

606
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,560
you know, like 14 years old maybe.

607
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:09,600
Like the perfect, like just the worst age kids, you know,

608
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,600
the most annoying.

609
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:15,600
I think it's around 13, 14, maximum annoying.

610
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,600
OK, yeah, yeah, I know I sucked then.

611
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,600
Yeah, I did too.

612
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,600
I suck now.

613
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:25,600
But so it was like, it seemed to be that there was a boy and girl

614
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:31,600
couple and then like another boy, hang her on third wheel.

615
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,600
Always a great combination.

616
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

617
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:39,640
So he's like, I'm going to show her that like I'm cool too.

618
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,640
I swear to God, he said this out loud.

619
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,640
He said his own thoughts.

620
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:51,640
Really self damning, really embarrassing.

621
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:55,640
No, so he's like, hey, I want to ride the cutie boats.

622
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,640
And I'm like, you're too big.

623
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,640
And plus, like, there's nowhere else online.

624
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,640
So like, I don't want to run it.

625
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,640
But like, no, you're too big.

626
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,680
He's like, come on.

627
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,680
I was like, no, he kept fighting.

628
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,680
I was like, you know what?

629
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,680
Like, sure, go ahead.

630
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,680
Go on.

631
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,680
Yeah.

632
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:16,680
Gets in the tiny thing, you know, like squishing in this boat

633
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,680
that's made for those kids.

634
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,680
You know, thinking he's funny.

635
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,680
Saying whatever to his friends.

636
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,680
Turn it on.

637
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,680
I think it's two minutes.

638
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:28,680
I'm starting to get down and I reset the timer.

639
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,720
At this point, it's like his jokes have slowed down.

640
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,720
The time goes down.

641
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,720
I reset it again.

642
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,720
So now he's on there, you know, like six minutes.

643
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,720
His other friend and the girlfriend just want to leave.

644
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,720
He's like, come on.

645
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,720
And he's going around in a circle.

646
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,720
He's like, wait.

647
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,720
And I just kept resetting it.

648
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,720
He was like, just let me off.

649
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,720
And I was like, I can't.

650
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,720
It's on a timer.

651
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,720
I'm like, I'm going to go.

652
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,760
He just let me off.

653
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,760
And I was like, I can't.

654
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,760
It's on a timer.

655
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,760
It's like, I can't.

656
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,760
I kept him on there for like 14 or 16 minutes.

657
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,760
Wow.

658
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,760
Yeah.

659
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:08,760
And he just sat there for most of it.

660
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,760
Yeah.

661
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,760
So he just gave up.

662
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,760
He just like, well, I guess.

663
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:15,760
He believed that there was nothing I could do about it.

664
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:20,760
You did convince him of the reality of this ride that has one move.

665
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:21,760
Yeah.

666
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,760
It just happens in perpetuity.

667
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:29,800
They decided that for the most enjoyment, 14 minutes is the correct ride length.

668
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,800
Really?

669
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,800
Wait, we focus group tested this.

670
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,800
This one, you're going to need some time.

671
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,800
They said, look, 90 seconds too short.

672
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,800
Like three days is too long.

673
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:44,800
You will probably want to go home and get a good night's sleep and try it again.

674
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,800
But we're still tinkering.

675
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,800
We're open to a three day excursion.

676
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:49,800
Yeah.

677
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,800
I was pleased with that.

678
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:53,800
That's incredible, Revo.

679
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:57,800
So you used your powers of poor ride operation for good.

680
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:00,800
And for, well, not evil, but negligence.

681
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,800
Yeah.

682
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:06,800
I don't think it meets any other, anyone's definition of good, except like it was fun for me.

683
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,800
More morally good, I feel.

684
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,800
I guess.

685
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,800
It depends on who you ask in that scenario.

686
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,800
Eye for an eye or something.

687
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,800
Yeah.

688
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,800
Revenge for him.

689
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:16,800
He was annoying.

690
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,800
So he had to get dizzier.

691
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,800
Yeah.

692
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:19,800
Yeah.

693
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:20,800
Something annoying had to happen to him.

694
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,800
Yes.

695
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,840
There was no way.

696
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:26,840
And that's not, that's not like if he was on the scrambler for 10 minutes, he might

697
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:27,840
start to get sick.

698
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,840
Oh yeah.

699
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:34,360
No, this was like he wanted to be a funny guy going on the little kids ride and I didn't

700
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:39,000
want to have to operate the ride just for him.

701
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,120
And you're ultimately, who is the funny guy?

702
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:49,840
Him who got shut up or you telling the story on a comedy podcast professionally.

703
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:56,640
Yeah, actually I think he, he wrote for modern family for seven seasons.

704
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:02,600
He has a bunch of Emmys.

705
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,880
You recognized him on stage three years in a row.

706
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,880
And he married the girl that his friend was dating.

707
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,880
Yeah.

708
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:13,000
Using that sad story in.

709
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:18,760
Who just goes from like one unseen Hulu show to the next?

710
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:21,000
Like just it's work.

711
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
The dream.

712
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Yeah.

713
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,480
Well, that's, that's all great.

714
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:31,080
Was there any repercussion for, did anyone notice the peril that you put babies in or

715
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,080
care?

716
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,880
I was never like asked about it later.

717
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:36,840
Like what happened there or something.

718
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:42,360
And the screams not enough to get the attention of other ride operators.

719
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,720
I don't think, no.

720
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,720
Nor would they.

721
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,440
No, just Karen blended into the other screams.

722
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,440
Yeah.

723
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:51,400
It's like when we were at Six Flags, like if I wanted to complain to someone, there was

724
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,600
no one around.

725
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:56,400
Like I couldn't find like a person to like, be like, Hey, you know what?

726
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,680
There were the Superman rides just running and no one's there.

727
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,680
No one's working.

728
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:02,000
Like there, I, we didn't know where to go.

729
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Is this magic mountain?

730
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
This is magic.

731
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Yeah.

732
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Yeah.

733
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Have you been, have you had the pleasure?

734
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:12,720
I have my daughter, Nico, who's 14, loves rides.

735
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:17,640
So for a few of her birthdays, I went there.

736
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:20,120
Was everything to your liking?

737
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:25,960
Well, I'm judging it against Six Flags Great Adventure.

738
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:26,960
Oh, sure.

739
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:27,960
Yeah.

740
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:28,960
Yeah.

741
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:29,960
Yeah.

742
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:35,360
I've not been to in 30 years, but apparently has like a lot of huge ride.

743
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,480
Yeah.

744
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,000
That's the Kingda Ka one.

745
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Yeah.

746
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Yeah.

747
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,080
They also have a drive through Safari or did.

748
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,080
Oh yes.

749
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,080
Right.

750
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,080
Still have that.

751
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,080
Still there.

752
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,080
Yeah.

753
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,200
I think they've changed it a little, but Great Adventure.

754
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,680
Well, you know, very crowded and overrun with teens.

755
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,400
That's sit on a lake.

756
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:58,920
It's full of like lots of nice landscaping and trees and stuff.

757
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,640
I don't like where you're going with this comment.

758
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,640
You know, I think-

759
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,920
You're saying it doesn't just bake in the sun like Magic Mountain?

760
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:05,920
No, it doesn't.

761
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:06,920
On the top of a mountain.

762
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:07,920
Yeah.

763
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:13,600
As you climb any number to elevations to discover what rides are closed that day.

764
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,600
Yeah.

765
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:17,680
And it had the like gondola chairlift thing.

766
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,680
Yes.

767
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:21,480
To take you from one end to the other.

768
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:25,720
As opposed to Magic Mountain where I think there is the building for that that hasn't

769
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:29,960
been open for three decades, but they haven't gotten rid of the building.

770
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:30,960
Yeah.

771
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,360
It's not, there's some like-

772
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:35,720
The Red Tower is some like Hugh Hefner connection or something.

773
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,320
I can't remember what that story is.

774
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,320
That's closed.

775
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,320
That sounds-

776
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,200
Does he own that only?

777
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,200
In Magic Mountain?

778
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:46,400
It was supposed to be a Playboy club with Ian Magic Mountain.

779
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:49,360
I like the rides at Magic Mountain.

780
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:52,120
It was supposed to be in Hugh Hefner's Playboy club in Chicago.

781
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,120
A giant tower?

782
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,120
What?

783
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,120
That's a legend.

784
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,120
That's the legend of it.

785
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,120
Wait, the big one?

786
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,120
I believe so, yeah.

787
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:01,760
They realized they could not fit a tower inside a restaurant.

788
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,560
In the middle of Chicago.

789
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:06,920
The tower was originally built for Hugh Hefner and was to be the centerpiece for the Playboy

790
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,920
club of Chicago.

791
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:13,040
But how could a centerpiece be hundreds of feet tall?

792
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,040
I see it on two websites.

793
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,760
Is this like a country club?

794
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,360
Playboy country club?

795
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:20,680
I'm going to need to do more reading to answer any of these questions.

796
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,800
Must be serious acreage to allow this.

797
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,760
Well, we'll find out.

798
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,000
We got to report back about this.

799
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,680
This is fascinating.

800
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:30,040
So that was the sum total.

801
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:33,480
That was what you operated or was that all of them?

802
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:36,280
It's kind of the same deal that reaps over here?

803
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,280
Yeah.

804
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,280
There was a thing.

805
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:45,800
There were these go-kart type things with like big fiberglass racing car shells that

806
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:52,680
went around the lake and had a rail like the Disney cars that exactly like that.

807
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,680
Sure.

808
00:33:53,880 --> 00:34:03,400
Those were kind of fun to operate because there you would stop them at point B and that

809
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:07,640
was like 50 feet from point A where the riders get on.

810
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:13,200
So you would stand on the outside of the car and like push this lever with your foot while

811
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,200
like riding it.

812
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:16,400
Oh, the little like standing right.

813
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,400
Yeah, yeah.

814
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,440
They do that at the Disney one too.

815
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,480
Yeah, to move them short distances.

816
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,480
Yeah, yeah.

817
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:28,120
So that's like about as fun as ride operating got at BoCraft.

818
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,120
That does look fun.

819
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:35,200
I think we've never talked about that in relation to the Autopia, the little stand and drive.

820
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:42,840
Yeah, that kind of no matter the budget of park, that is the most efficient way to move

821
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,720
those kinds of cars apparently.

822
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:49,200
And it has, yeah, as far as a job, it has the appeal of like the garbage man who stand

823
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,760
on the back of the truck.

824
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,760
Oh sure.

825
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

826
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,840
The perk of a slight breeze.

827
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:58,160
I always thought like that looks like the most fun job ever.

828
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:05,320
You get to stand like outside of a moving truck.

829
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:08,360
And possibly necessary for smell purposes.

830
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:15,040
Well in my town, it would be those guys would like pick up the can and dump it in.

831
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:19,880
It wasn't the trucks grabbing and lifting, which seems to do it now.

832
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,600
It takes so long.

833
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:25,320
It's like herky jerky.

834
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:29,480
It doesn't seem like the best way to collect garbage.

835
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,480
Yeah, no.

836
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:36,200
And where I grew up outside of Philadelphia, it was everyone just kind of bought whatever

837
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,280
garbage can they felt like.

838
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,880
So every house's garbage can was different.

839
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,360
You could express yourself via garbage.

840
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,840
You could really express yourself.

841
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,200
Yeah, that's nice.

842
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:48,040
Flags, lawn ornaments, crazy garbage.

843
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,120
What kind of can did you have?

844
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,960
It was just a brown round can.

845
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:51,960
Nice.

846
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,920
It's just because everyone's like, oh God, I got to rake.

847
00:35:54,920 --> 00:36:00,360
Or no, I guess you just raked leaves to the sidewalk and left them on the curb.

848
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,360
Really?

849
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:05,280
You left a truck would come around and suck up leaves every fall.

850
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,280
Really?

851
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,680
You guys had a suck up leaves truck?

852
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,680
Yeah.

853
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:09,680
We had to put them in a bag.

854
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:10,680
I'm from the Midwest.

855
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:13,240
We had to put them in a bag and then they would come and maybe do a special collection.

856
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:18,080
We might put them in a bag to drag it to the sidewalk where then you dumped it in piles.

857
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,080
Really?

858
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,040
This is familiar to anyone?

859
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,040
I mean, I know in West Coast.

860
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,960
I don't even remember what we did with our leaves.

861
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:26,600
I think there was like a secondary market for them.

862
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:29,360
We sold them.

863
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:35,880
Inevitably one or two houses would just burn them in the backyard in a metal can.

864
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:40,040
Then everyone in the neighborhood, you would just hear like your parents and the neighbors

865
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:42,880
going like, she's seen them burning their leaves again.

866
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,280
It's like, yeah, I know.

867
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,960
And I'm just like, I don't know why.

868
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,960
First off, I don't know why everyone's mad.

869
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:53,360
And second off, I don't know why those people were burning their stinky dead leaves.

870
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:56,160
And why are all the parents discussing it in such hushed tones?

871
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:00,600
They'll burn us if we don't talk louder about it.

872
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:04,240
Well, because it's sometimes dead silent in the summer.

873
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:07,320
I think sound could just travel blocks and blocks.

874
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,320
What was that?

875
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,440
What were they saying about our leaf burning?

876
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,160
Every now and then you hear like a barking dog.

877
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:18,560
I feel like the neighborhood I grew up in and you go outside to where it was, it was

878
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:22,720
houses and houses away.

879
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,000
You live in a really eerie.

880
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:29,040
It sounds like Truman Show-esque like audio all around.

881
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,400
This is actually suburban Philadelphia.

882
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,280
Yes.

883
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,680
In Pennsylvania or New Jersey?

884
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:39,400
In Delaware County, in like a mayor of Easttown country.

885
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,920
Right.

886
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:46,600
So I, yeah, no, I only remember that one stuck out in mind because there were always like

887
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:53,760
everyone had like big either like German Shepherds or Yellow Labs or Black Labs.

888
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:59,080
And there was a couple of dogs who it's like, OK, that is a German Shepherd and it's very

889
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:03,000
friendly and that one is German Shepherd and he's mean.

890
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,440
And I saw one attack a mailman once.

891
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,520
Oh, no.

892
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:13,920
I believe the mailman maced the dog and then vaulted over a fence and ran back to his car.

893
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:20,520
And I saw this from half a block away and I was just like, oh, why?

894
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,520
Well I'm going inside the rest of the day.

895
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:27,320
I'm never going to tell anyone this until I'm on a podcast.

896
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,800
Twenty two years later.

897
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:33,280
A mailman maced a dog and we haven't heard the story in six years of doing the show.

898
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,280
Yeah.

899
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,280
That's shocking to me, honestly.

900
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:38,880
Because I didn't want to tell anyone because it was actually one of the nice dogs.

901
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:41,800
And I think it just got startled from a mailman.

902
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:45,800
I think it was sleeping on the front step and it just got startled by a mailman.

903
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,800
Oh, hmm.

904
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:52,120
Remember when German Shepherds and Dobermans were as scary as dogs got?

905
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:55,040
They were like the scariest dogs there were.

906
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:58,360
As opposed. Are you saying that there are now scarier breeds?

907
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,520
Yes.

908
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,600
I don't know that I don't have a dog.

909
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,200
I don't know. So I'm not then I'm not walking.

910
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:08,560
It was like in movies if you were a guard dog was a German Shepherd or Doberman, possibly

911
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:12,560
a Rottweiler, but there was no like pit bull or a.

912
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,560
Right.

913
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,560
You know, what was Cujo?

914
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:17,320
I feel like he was a mastiff.

915
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,320
Just very slobbery.

916
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,320
Yeah.

917
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,320
Yeah.

918
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,320
Possibly had mange.

919
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,320
What's the Sandlot dog?

920
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,320
St. Bernard.

921
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,320
Yeah.

922
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,760
And we love St. Bernard's in the 90s because of Beethoven.

923
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,760
Sure.

924
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:29,760
They weren't scary.

925
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,760
They were.

926
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:31,760
Right.

927
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:32,760
Everyone loves St. Bernard.

928
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:38,080
Was that's hey, that's where the laughs came from in the case of Beethoven and Groten,

929
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:39,960
the straight man, he anchored it.

930
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:45,840
You see, of course, I was thinking you're the torture of the kid on the ride, making

931
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:48,240
him stay on the ride and go over and over.

932
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:53,640
That is the third act of the film Clifford, which comes up a lot with Charles Groton makes

933
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:55,180
Clifford be low.

934
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:56,180
You want how bad?

935
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:57,180
How much do you want to be on this?

936
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:59,940
And it was a he's a mouthy kid.

937
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:02,080
You really you did Clifford in real life.

938
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,160
What year was Clifford?

939
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:07,560
Clifford was well, it was made in like 90 but sat on the shelf until 94.

940
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,360
So it came out in 94.

941
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,360
Yeah.

942
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,360
Yeah.

943
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,360
I definitely didn't see it in 94.

944
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,360
OK, OK.

945
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,360
Well, there are a lot of people did.

946
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,360
No, no, no.

947
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,360
Ripping it off.

948
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:18,920
Only Clifford has reached peak popularity now.

949
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:23,160
I would say in the last year as multiple podcasts have started to talk about it.

950
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,520
I think Tom Sharpling is a big Clifford.

951
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,520
Yeah.

952
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:27,520
Big Clifford.

953
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:28,520
He has props.

954
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:29,520
He has the collection.

955
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,520
Oh, that's right.

956
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:31,520
He has the suit.

957
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,160
He has a real Clifford suit.

958
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,160
Yeah.

959
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:39,440
We started calling our audience Cliffords, but due to their theme park enthusiasm and

960
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,640
their eternal childlike wonder.

961
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:46,960
And half of them like it and half of them will still sometimes find a way to pretty

962
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:47,960
good.

963
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:48,960
Pretty good.

964
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,960
That's kind of what I thought it would be.

965
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,360
Honestly, it's stuck more than I ever thought it would.

966
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,360
Yeah.

967
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,360
Yeah.

968
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:59,040
I did not intend for it to be the official name of our audience where we're saying it

969
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:02,160
not even as a, Hey, Clifford, so we got a show coming up.

970
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,160
Click on the link.

971
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:05,080
It became so casual.

972
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,080
So fast.

973
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,080
Yeah.

974
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:09,760
I'm sorry if you're a Clifford who doesn't like it, but you are.

975
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,040
But I did still call you a Clifford.

976
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,040
But you are a Clifford.

977
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,640
Let's be honest.

978
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:14,640
We are too.

979
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:15,640
But you are too.

980
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:16,640
That's why it's here.

981
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,800
Uh, it says we're talking about, uh, kids.

982
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:20,800
I watched.

983
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:21,800
Uh-oh.

984
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,520
We're all afraid of this.

985
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,200
You'll know what segue we're afraid of when we get there.

986
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,200
No, it's not the fairest, Will.

987
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,600
That was like a Byron Allen segue.

988
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:34,080
I understand you've gone on a date.

989
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:37,880
I just didn't want to forget the story because it involves the scrambler specifically, but

990
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:44,040
I, I got a pretty good, uh, video view of Bowcraft because there, there was a YouTube

991
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:48,000
account called Coaster Kids, Coaster with a K, Kids with a K.

992
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:53,680
Um, and they were, uh, riding all the rides at Bowcraft.

993
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:57,160
It appeared to have the park to themselves.

994
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,160
When was this?

995
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,800
This is maybe five or six years old.

996
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:04,440
So, uh, they're all, or five or six years ago, excuse me.

997
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:09,280
Um, and they all seem to be in their like preteen years.

998
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:13,160
So they're probably all in college and probably if family brings it up, they're like, I don't

999
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:15,680
want to talk about Coaster Kids anymore.

1000
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:18,800
Um, excuse me.

1001
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,560
Aren't you one of the Coaster Kids?

1002
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:21,560
Shut up, man.

1003
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:22,560
I told you.

1004
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:23,560
I told you.

1005
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:24,560
Check it out over here.

1006
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,560
A Coaster Kid.

1007
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:31,160
They didn't seem super jazzed to be at Bowcraft, but the moment that stuck out to me was when

1008
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:39,120
they ride, uh, rode the scrambler and, uh, the, the main, uh, girl, uh, yelled while

1009
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:40,840
sitting in a scrambler bench.

1010
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,320
This bench is really hot.

1011
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,320
Oh yeah.

1012
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,320
I remember that too.

1013
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,320
Yeah.

1014
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:50,560
And that might've been part of it is that, that footwell, it was like one of those solar

1015
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:51,560
ovens.

1016
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:56,160
We're just like, every angle was hot metal.

1017
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,160
Yeah.

1018
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,920
And I was bouncing around.

1019
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:04,360
I read a lot of scramblers and, um, that kind of doesn't go away no matter how fancy the

1020
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:09,000
park is, but, um, they rode this and when they got off, they were viewing it and the

1021
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:14,320
girl went, uh, this is probably the sketchiest scrambler I've ever been on.

1022
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:17,680
Uh, my seat was held together by duct tape.

1023
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,880
Yeah, that could be.

1024
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:21,600
You never want to hear that.

1025
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:24,360
Um, that's not the thing you want to hear.

1026
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:32,040
Uh, I remembered that Bowcraft is featured in a Bruce Willis Demi Moore movie.

1027
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:37,400
Um, I don't remember the name, but it was like a mortal thought.

1028
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:38,400
Yes, yes, yes.

1029
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:45,040
So there was a poster in the main building slash arcade for mortal thoughts.

1030
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:53,600
And if you didn't know that trivia, you'd be like, why are you like fans of this?

1031
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,000
Huge mortal thoughts fans.

1032
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:59,600
It, well, it's made especially cause I was like, oh yeah, I'd like to see how this is

1033
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:00,600
you.

1034
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:03,480
Oh, I like a good movie filmed in a theme park and you put it on it.

1035
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:08,360
It's once it, well, it's also like, it is a brutal rape slash murder scene.

1036
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:10,120
It is like in a parking lot.

1037
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:11,120
Yeah.

1038
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:12,120
Yeah.

1039
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:15,960
It's the background essentially of like a horrifying sequence.

1040
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:19,640
And they're very proud of their place in cinema history.

1041
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:22,680
Hey, without us it would have been all sad.

1042
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:24,920
There wouldn't have been some nice bright lights behind that.

1043
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:29,080
A lot of people seeing that movie going, I'd like to visit that place behind this horrible

1044
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:32,080
thing that's happening.

1045
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:35,560
Rather be in there than in this scary van that the scene happens in.

1046
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:39,160
You know who's buried in, uh, Scotch planes?

1047
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:40,160
No.

1048
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:42,480
Go around guessing until we get it.

1049
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:47,480
Dudley Moore.

1050
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:48,480
What?

1051
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:53,920
I don't, I like, I don't, I haven't looked into why, what is connection to Scotch planes

1052
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:54,920
New Jersey is.

1053
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:55,920
Wow.

1054
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:56,920
Was he, was a mistake?

1055
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:57,920
He fell out of a car.

1056
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:58,920
It's a mistake.

1057
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:05,920
Like the packing slips at Scotch planes.

1058
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:06,920
Oh well.

1059
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:07,920
Just leave it there.

1060
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:08,920
Just following instructions.

1061
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:17,920
I found a little Scotch planes history, um, in terms of birth famous people from Scotch

1062
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:18,920
planes.

1063
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:23,640
That's the birthplace of Judy Bloom of composer Mark Shaman.

1064
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:26,120
Who's come up a bunch of times lately.

1065
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:30,160
Um, this, this is just dry statement.

1066
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:35,920
John Gano, the man who baptized George Washington.

1067
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:36,920
That's a historical character.

1068
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:38,240
I didn't know that.

1069
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:42,200
I think as an adult is what, I think it's just, it wasn't born in England.

1070
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:43,200
Oh yeah.

1071
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:44,200
So, oh wait.

1072
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:45,200
Yeah.

1073
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:49,080
So the, to be born there and then quickly go on to baptize George Washington.

1074
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:51,120
Why do you have to be baptized later?

1075
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:52,120
I don't know.

1076
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:53,120
Why?

1077
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:55,840
When I started looking into this, there were people who thought it was fake or something

1078
00:45:55,840 --> 00:46:00,280
like, no, he would have been baptized as a, historians were arguing about whether George

1079
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:01,960
Washington was baptized as a baby or not.

1080
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:03,640
Was it another one of his like PR thing?

1081
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:09,600
I remember George Washington's PR man, Mason Weems, with all of the different George Washington

1082
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,400
legends like were fake.

1083
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:12,560
Like the wooden dentures.

1084
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:13,560
Yeah.

1085
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:16,400
It was all his PR guy talking about what a great guy this was.

1086
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:17,400
Really?

1087
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,000
Could that PR, could this be fake?

1088
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,600
This is another Weems exclusive.

1089
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:22,600
That's right.

1090
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:23,600
So wait, sorry.

1091
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:27,120
Is Weems a recent person or an at the time person?

1092
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:28,120
You mean like a new guy?

1093
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:31,120
The slimy PR guy from the 18th century.

1094
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:32,120
I can't believe the old days.

1095
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:33,600
That's what I want.

1096
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:37,840
It is a modern, like George Washington's current agent, essentially.

1097
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:38,840
Yeah.

1098
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:41,840
You're saying the IP of George Washington is still being preserved and there would be

1099
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:44,720
a PR person now still trying to push an area.

1100
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:45,720
Yeah.

1101
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:49,360
You bring up these weirdos who like the person who's holding the Bozo license or whatever,

1102
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:51,400
who has the George Washington license?

1103
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:56,320
I guess you might call that the estate, but I thought it's more fun to think of him as

1104
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:57,320
an IP.

1105
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:58,320
Okay, here we go.

1106
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:05,800
Mason Weems, Mason Locke Weems, October 11th, 1759 to May 23rd, 1825, usually referred to

1107
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:11,240
as Parson Weems, was an American minister, evangelical bookseller and author who wrote

1108
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:14,480
the first biography of George Washington immediately after his death.

1109
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:18,760
Some of the pop popular stories about Washington can be traced to Weems, including the cherry

1110
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:19,760
tree.

1111
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:23,160
Oh, they all threw that he threw a cherry tree across the Potomac.

1112
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:26,160
Yeah, that was the crossing.

1113
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:37,040
Wow, geez, well, this is he's like a like a Trumpian like, yeah, who was the one who

1114
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:41,400
skipped a coin or a rock across the Potomac?

1115
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:42,400
Is that also Jefferson?

1116
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:43,400
Or is this one of them?

1117
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:44,400
It probably was a lie though.

1118
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:45,400
Yeah.

1119
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:46,400
I mean, why?

1120
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:47,400
Yeah.

1121
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:50,400
Why does it make him fit to be a leader?

1122
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:51,400
That's like a trick.

1123
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:52,400
It doesn't make you strong.

1124
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:53,640
Yeah, I don't know.

1125
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:54,640
Just like wrist strength is not much.

1126
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:55,640
What are you going to do with that?

1127
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:56,640
I bet he's good at dealing cards.

1128
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:57,640
Slightly 3% more quickly than a typical card dealer.

1129
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:58,640
The name Parson Weems sounds familiar, but I don't know.

1130
00:47:58,640 --> 00:47:59,640
Okay, I want to learn more about Parson.

1131
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:00,640
I'm kind of into colonial era publicists.

1132
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:01,640
That's the easier guy.

1133
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:02,640
Yeah, that's the number one.

1134
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:03,640
It doesn't get bigger than Weems.

1135
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:04,640
Never thought it would come up in the spot.

1136
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:05,640
If I could get a little bit of a sense of it, I mean, I'm not a big fan of Parson Weems.

1137
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:06,640
I mean, I'm not a big fan of Parson Weems.

1138
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:07,640
I mean, I'm not a big fan of Parson Weems.

1139
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:08,640
I mean, I'm not a big fan of Parson Weems.

1140
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:31,800
I feel like calling yourself Mason Locke just sounds like a stronger, makes a stronger impression.

1141
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:32,800
Okay.

1142
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:35,800
If you were Mason Locke Weems' agent, you would have told him to change his name.

1143
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:36,800
Yeah, I would have changed his name.

1144
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:37,800
Parson Weems.

1145
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:40,520
Parson Weems didn't have his own Parson Weems.

1146
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:45,280
Yeah, I was like Irving Thalberg just going like, you're Judy Garland now, you're Fred

1147
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:46,280
So-and-so now.

1148
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:47,280
Right.

1149
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:51,040
See, he was so busy helping his clients, he forgot to help himself.

1150
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:52,040
Yeah.

1151
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:53,840
The curse of Weems.

1152
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:54,840
Oh, Weems.

1153
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:55,840
The curse of Weems.

1154
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:57,320
Oh, Mr. Weems.

1155
00:48:57,320 --> 00:49:02,720
Scott, you also mentioned, I think when we were talking about doing this episode, that

1156
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:06,040
the other movie filmed here is the Rob Reiner movie North?

1157
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:07,040
Yes.

1158
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:08,280
Yeah.

1159
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:10,720
Another like, what, you filmed it?

1160
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:11,720
Yeah.

1161
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:13,800
No poster at BoKraft for North?

1162
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:14,920
What year was North?

1163
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:15,920
I think also 94.

1164
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:16,920
94, yeah.

1165
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:17,920
94.

1166
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:21,560
And also like I hated, like sat on a shelf like Clifford.

1167
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:27,560
I remember Roger Ebert's review, like him hating that movie more than any movie he'd

1168
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:29,040
ever seen in his life.

1169
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:30,160
I kind of remembered that.

1170
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:34,840
I never saw it and I just, yeah, it was like such aggressive hatred.

1171
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:36,640
I'll get around to North.

1172
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:39,280
I did not know that was shot there.

1173
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:40,280
Oh, it's really quick.

1174
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:44,240
I feel like they would have been like, kids would have known that at the time.

1175
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:47,400
Unless North was so...

1176
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:52,920
If they were listening to Ebert as I was as a young child, 10 year old.

1177
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:57,320
Kids had gotten ahold of the script and said, this is going to turn out to be a bad movie.

1178
00:49:57,320 --> 00:50:02,440
Let's not go to BoKraft and try to see it being shot.

1179
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:04,120
This is a bizarre...

1180
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:11,760
Elijah Wood, John Lovitz, Jason Alexander, Alan Arkin, Dan Aykroyd, Kathy Bates, Julia

1181
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:17,000
Louis-Dreyfus, Reba McIntyre, John Ritter, Abe Vigoda, Bruce Willis.

1182
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:21,480
Yeah, because they were all prospective foster parents.

1183
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:23,000
He was a free agent.

1184
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,840
He was like, I hate my parents.

1185
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:25,840
I want new parents.

1186
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:27,720
I'm going to like audition parents.

1187
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:34,360
So it's probably like each of those was like coupled up and like had a scene or two where

1188
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:36,600
like, try us.

1189
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:39,480
We do funny things.

1190
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:42,560
We are extremely broad mom and dad characters.

1191
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:44,780
But clearly not right for you.

1192
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:48,240
So that's why it comes this early in the movie.

1193
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:49,240
Not right.

1194
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:50,240
We have them for a day though.

1195
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:52,240
So get them in and out.

1196
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:56,280
Per law, we get to hang out with him for a day or two.

1197
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:58,040
It's probably a fun shoot.

1198
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:00,680
Elijah must have had a blast.

1199
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:02,680
Was that also a rape scene?

1200
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:04,680
No, not.

1201
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:10,680
Something about the poker parking lot vibe.

1202
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:15,300
You know, I wasn't planning on putting it in the movie, but now that I'm seeing the

1203
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:17,480
parking lot, it just kind of feels like...

1204
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:20,760
You know, well, no one's seen it here, so we'll never know.

1205
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:23,640
It easily could be.

1206
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:28,840
Well, look, if we're talking about horrible things, why don't we talk about what happened

1207
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:29,840
after...

1208
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:31,040
Let's be very clear.

1209
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:32,440
After you were a ride operator.

1210
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:33,440
Yes.

1211
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:34,440
It's a absolve you of this.

1212
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:36,440
By after you mean like a week after.

1213
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:38,440
Was it that close?

1214
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:39,440
Yes.

1215
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:40,440
Oh my God.

1216
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:45,640
I left sometime in August to go to college.

1217
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:52,920
And yeah, it was like the next week, a kid fell off the top of the Ferris wheel, which

1218
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:55,320
is like, I don't know, 30, 40 feet.

1219
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:56,320
That's up 50.

1220
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:57,320
Really?

1221
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:58,320
Even more.

1222
00:51:58,320 --> 00:51:59,320
Yeah, that's a big fall.

1223
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:02,320
I was going to say 50, but I was like, eh.

1224
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:06,720
You don't need to try to impress them with how tall the Ferris wheel was.

1225
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:08,920
You'd be like one of those Hugh Hefner things.

1226
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:10,320
We've got to look into it more.

1227
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:16,120
Yeah, I'm not self-conscious about the size of Bo Kress Ferris wheel.

1228
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:21,920
I'm going to really bomb out on this butt guest of like fake brag about Ferris wheel

1229
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:22,920
numbers.

1230
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:25,920
What's he compensating for?

1231
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:28,920
What a little man.

1232
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:33,920
Little man with a big Ferris wheel.

1233
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:36,920
Big Ferris wheel lies.

1234
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:43,920
Okay, so kid fell off and he didn't die.

1235
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:47,920
Which allows us to have a little fun talking about it.

1236
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:48,920
Everyone breathe a sigh of relief.

1237
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:53,920
Which allowed him to have an act two in life.

1238
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:57,920
So, I don't know, it's a few years, 10 years or whatever.

1239
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:01,920
At some point I was like, whatever happened to that kid?

1240
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:06,920
Maybe I didn't even know if he had died or not.

1241
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:12,920
So, I Googled like Bo Kress Ferris wheel fall or whatever.

1242
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:17,920
Found the kid's name and then Googled that name.

1243
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:25,920
The next thing he comes up in, he was part of a robbery gang.

1244
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:29,920
Like bank robberies possibly or maybe just store robberies.

1245
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:31,920
It's like gas stations.

1246
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:33,920
Yeah, like 12.

1247
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:35,920
Wow.

1248
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:40,920
First off, I did the same thought process.

1249
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:41,920
I looked at the kid's name.

1250
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:45,920
I said, well, maybe there was a follow up with him 10 or 20 years later.

1251
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:46,920
How are you doing?

1252
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:47,920
What are you doing now?

1253
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:51,920
And the only other results of that name are indicted.

1254
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:57,920
Yeah, part of a string of robberies across like Northern New Jersey.

1255
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:58,920
Or your hometown.

1256
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:03,920
He was from, he was living in my hometown, Mountainside at the time.

1257
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:06,920
He was known as Name.

1258
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:13,920
I apologize that a couple towns over is John Gano, the man who baptized George Washington.

1259
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:20,920
But all you got is Ferris wheel fall survivor and gas station robber.

1260
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:25,920
I feel like that's a pretty good defense of like, your honor.

1261
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:28,920
I fell off a Ferris wheel when I was younger.

1262
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:34,920
Yeah, that's what I thought. It was like some Phineas Gage type thing.

1263
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:36,920
But it didn't seem to work.

1264
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:48,920
It didn't. There was no mention of I'm surprised none of the articles about the robberies were like, by the way, one of these people fell off a Ferris wheel and was talking right after the end.

1265
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:52,920
Like it was fine fractured his skull, but they repaired and he was fine.

1266
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:55,920
Do you think he was going in the gas stations going, give me all the money.

1267
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:57,920
I fell off a Ferris wheel.

1268
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:59,920
Like, wait, what? How do you do that? Just shut up.

1269
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:01,920
I did it. Give me the money.

1270
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:04,920
All right. Well, here we go.

1271
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:05,920
Wait, you survived though?

1272
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:07,920
Of course I survived.

1273
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:10,920
Oh, that's right. I'm looking at you.

1274
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:28,920
They were just afraid it would set a dangerous precedent if they let them off that like kids growing up maybe like in poor, you know, would be like I should fall off a Ferris wheel because that'll give me license to rob stores later in life.

1275
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:29,920
And that's how I get by.

1276
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:32,920
Parents would be like nudging them off.

1277
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:35,920
Oops, my kid fell off.

1278
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:37,920
He's free to rob stores now.

1279
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:38,920
Yeah.

1280
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:41,920
Surely the Joker has done this as an alibi.

1281
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:45,920
It's like I just I fell in the access chemicals stuff and I ain't been right since.

1282
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:50,920
And then there would be like kids trying to fall off like lesser rides.

1283
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:52,920
I fell off a Tilted Whirl.

1284
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:56,920
But I want to commit more tame crimes.

1285
00:55:56,920 --> 00:56:08,920
So mine will be more like a little more like parking tickets at least stealing like build a bear skins and stuff secretly low level $25 crime.

1286
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:09,920
Yes.

1287
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:10,920
I would say you know what I'm saying.

1288
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:12,920
The skin of the build a bear, not the stuffing.

1289
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:13,920
Stealing. Oh, yeah.

1290
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:15,920
Yeah. Not the outside of the store.

1291
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:16,920
But of the bear.

1292
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:19,920
Was the Tilted Whirl at full speed when you fell off?

1293
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:21,920
Yes, your honor.

1294
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:22,920
OK.

1295
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:23,920
All right.

1296
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:25,920
So you are free to go.

1297
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:36,920
I when so then it's all it's potentially like if you know that paying for college is not going to work out for your kid at an early age.

1298
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:38,920
All you got to do take a ride on a Ferris wheel.

1299
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:42,920
Well, that's why they started in line for the first.

1300
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:48,920
So you had to take a polygraph that you were not in this financial game.

1301
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:51,920
But you just wanted to enjoy the ride.

1302
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:53,920
Are you here for fun and frivolity?

1303
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:54,920
Yeah.

1304
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:59,920
Do you have any ulterior motives for riding the Ferris wheel today?

1305
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:00,920
No.

1306
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:03,920
OK.

1307
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:07,920
Are you aware of the story of the boy from 1994?

1308
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:08,920
This law.

1309
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:09,920
What?

1310
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:10,920
Never mind. You can go on.

1311
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:12,920
Your honor, my client couldn't have done this.

1312
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:17,920
His retinas were damaged when he was very young by any number of sun bleached colors.

1313
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:22,920
This is this is a big thing that stuck out to me when I saw the park.

1314
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:27,920
Like, look at this messed up sun bleached like Pinocchio statue.

1315
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:28,920
Take a look at this.

1316
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:33,920
Well, there's they certainly did not have license to use Disney.

1317
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:34,920
Yeah.

1318
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:35,920
Oh, sure.

1319
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:38,920
I would also argue the bigger problem is the design of Pinocchio.

1320
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:40,920
They're not necessarily just his faded colors.

1321
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:43,920
Or that he is bulbous and frightening.

1322
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:44,920
That would be what I'm getting at.

1323
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:45,920
You know what?

1324
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:54,920
They did have a Griffith Park style small trim, not the tiny one, but like.

1325
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:57,920
A little bit bigger than that.

1326
00:57:57,920 --> 00:57:58,920
Sure. Yeah.

1327
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:00,920
Yeah. I mean, that's good.

1328
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:05,920
Like I it feels like a place I would take my kids to if it was.

1329
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:08,920
It doesn't seem like shady despite all of these.

1330
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:09,920
It really wasn't.

1331
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:12,920
No shadier than any other.

1332
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:14,920
Like, yeah, yeah.

1333
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:18,920
Yeah. It seemed like a roadside carnival that just put down roots.

1334
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:19,920
Yes.

1335
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:23,920
It seemed like it was much more of a nature park in the 40s.

1336
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:24,920
I believe so.

1337
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:27,920
And the owners were very into their roots.

1338
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:28,920
Oh, yes.

1339
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:31,920
Well, let's get into that.

1340
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:33,920
You might be wondering what is this name?

1341
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:34,920
Why Bowcraft?

1342
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:40,920
And it's because it started as a small archery and ski equipment store.

1343
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:43,920
It's like so that was the that was the business.

1344
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:45,920
It was a guy named Ted Miller.

1345
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:50,920
Then he went to war and did like odd jobs in the war.

1346
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:57,920
Sharpened bayonets and such made enough money to buy the property surrounding

1347
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:00,920
Bowcraft and turn it into other stuff.

1348
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:02,920
Ski slopes and miniature golf.

1349
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:05,920
And then it slowly, you know, became a theme park.

1350
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:07,920
Do they still have miniature golf?

1351
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:08,920
I don't even remember.

1352
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:11,920
I think that may have like faded away.

1353
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:12,920
They did.

1354
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:13,920
They did.

1355
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:15,920
OK. All right. Well, then I'm fine.

1356
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:17,920
Then I'm pulling things out of nowhere.

1357
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:23,920
But so he and his wife Ted and Isabel Miller are the owners.

1358
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:26,920
And you can find a couple things about them pretty quickly.

1359
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:28,920
One, Christian scientists.

1360
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:34,920
Two, members of the John Birch Society, the hyper conservative.

1361
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:39,920
I mean, what do I don't I'm no expert in this, but like very arch

1362
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:45,920
conservative, crazy, conspiratorial, really right wing, very anti-communist.

1363
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:50,920
I think used to be a little more like people like, oh, they're crazy.

1364
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:53,920
OK, we're conservative, but we're not John Birch Society conservatives.

1365
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:57,920
Now they're like the mainstream Republican Party.

1366
00:59:57,920 --> 00:59:59,920
Do they still exist?

1367
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:00,920
John Birch?

1368
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:02,920
I think in some form or another.

1369
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:03,920
I think so.

1370
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:05,920
But is it a little like mission accomplished?

1371
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:08,920
Now the whole party is the John Birch Society.

1372
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:11,920
They never seem to be happy.

1373
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:13,920
So they're probably still complaining.

1374
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:15,920
Communism keeps threatening us.

1375
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:16,920
He's coming.

1376
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:17,920
Yes. Yeah.

1377
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:22,920
Around every like with the you know, on like Netflix shows and drag

1378
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:25,920
performances, there's communism everywhere.

1379
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:27,920
Bud Light marketing.

1380
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:30,920
You just can't get away from it.

1381
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:35,920
And this is what the owners of BoCraft were trying to warn about.

1382
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:37,920
They quote some local website.

1383
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:41,920
They would put they would often put up anti-communist and right wing slogans on

1384
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:44,920
the message board facing Route 22.

1385
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:47,920
So they were very out and about with that stuff.

1386
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:52,920
And I found an ad that was in local papers for when it was still just a ski

1387
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:55,920
shop, BoCraft ski shop.

1388
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:57,920
And there's, you know, nice things.

1389
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:02,920
And our goals are quality merchandise, service, friendliness, constant

1390
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:04,920
improvement and perfection.

1391
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:06,920
Then a little box under that.

1392
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:10,920
We are also an American opinion bookstore with books and pamphlets which tell

1393
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:15,920
the truth about the treachery lies and enslavement of communism.

1394
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:18,920
Yes, I also had the little box.

1395
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:20,920
We own a nice little box.

1396
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:21,920
What a loaded box.

1397
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:23,920
Sounds like you have everything.

1398
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:25,920
My sporting needs. Great.

1399
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:27,920
One more thing.

1400
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:34,920
Oh, hey, you know, the you know, that weird bookstore, you know, they opened a

1401
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:36,920
bunch of kiddie rides.

1402
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:38,920
Oh, that sounds good.

1403
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:40,920
That with my my carousel.

1404
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:44,920
That's a well, I want my year, my five year old to learn about the treachery.

1405
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:45,920
Yeah.

1406
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:47,920
What year was he alive?

1407
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:49,920
This owner, I think.

1408
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:52,920
I think he sold.

1409
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:54,920
He was still alive when you worked there.

1410
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:55,920
Look, I don't know.

1411
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:58,920
I don't know if he sold it a couple years later.

1412
01:01:58,920 --> 01:01:59,920
Did he after the accident?

1413
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:03,920
He was running it during the when the accident happened.

1414
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:04,920
Yes.

1415
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:07,920
Did you have any sense of the right winginess of this place?

1416
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:10,920
For some reason, I knew about John Byrd's.

1417
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:13,920
I don't think I really knew what that meant.

1418
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:18,920
And I was not aware of like who owned the place, who was like in charge.

1419
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:20,920
Sure, sure.

1420
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:21,920
It wasn't reflected in it.

1421
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:24,920
There was no like you asked for a raise.

1422
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:27,920
Like, what do you get out of here?

1423
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:28,920
Binko.

1424
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:32,920
We never asked for a rate.

1425
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:35,920
I've been here three weeks now.

1426
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:42,920
You barge into the office, slam the door, the door just falls apart behind you.

1427
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:45,920
No babies have died on my watch.

1428
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:49,920
Been alarmed and screamed possibly, but it's not a death.

1429
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:52,920
Stronger for it.

1430
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:58,920
I when I bring all this up, that it is a theme park that grew out of odd little roots,

1431
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:08,920
where it was one little business and then became a theme park, but that there was a right wing John Birch influence infused in the early days of the book.

1432
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:09,920
What does this remind us?

1433
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:10,920
Where have we heard?

1434
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:11,920
Oh, not a wall.

1435
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:12,920
Not very far.

1436
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:13,920
Not very far.

1437
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:16,920
Which we this was something we found long, long ago.

1438
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:23,920
One of the first episodes with Ryan Perez that I don't know if you knew this, that the same thing with not the job.

1439
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:34,920
He the Walter not who started the place had this agenda of, well, it's it's a it's fried chicken and then we'll open a Calico ghost town.

1440
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:40,920
And then also there's a little thing called the Freedom Center, a very sad little books.

1441
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:43,920
I finally I think for the first time I saw a picture of the Freedom Center.

1442
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:44,920
It is the plainest sign.

1443
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:45,920
Yeah.

1444
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:46,920
Yeah.

1445
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:47,920
Saddest little room.

1446
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:58,920
One of the things you could do in the early 60s, at least at Knott's Berry Farm was go and get conservative literature with titles like I found a couple of the specifics.

1447
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:02,920
The socialist plan for conquest and communism on the map.

1448
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:03,920
Yeah.

1449
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:08,920
We found that like newsreel of Walter not saying like expousing his his belief.

1450
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:09,920
Oh, we do.

1451
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:10,920
Oh, I thought I had found that for the first time.

1452
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:11,920
OK, I can't remember.

1453
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:12,920
We played it on the show.

1454
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:17,920
I can't remember if that was was that playing in the Freedom Center or was that just something he was getting like interviewed?

1455
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:18,920
I can't remember.

1456
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:19,920
I'm not sure.

1457
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:24,920
I just know that you would go in and get really dry and scary little pamphlets.

1458
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:25,920
Yeah.

1459
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:27,920
And we've been talking about the Freedom Center ever since.

1460
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:38,920
It's come up many times and I wanted to see if I could come in with something more specific than the Freedom Center when it comes to Walter Knott's John Birch conservatism.

1461
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:49,920
And I really like what I found, which is that Walter Knott did a very special week of live entertainment in Anaheim in Disney's backyard.

1462
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:53,920
And well, it's I mean, it was entertainment, but it was also a school.

1463
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:56,920
It was a school that went by several names.

1464
01:04:56,920 --> 01:05:02,920
One was Christian anti-communist school and another one, a little blunter, was anti-red school.

1465
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:03,920
Wow.

1466
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:05,920
OK.

1467
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:16,920
And so this what this was was like a big outdoor event in like a football stadium, like a high school football stadium.

1468
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:18,920
And families came.

1469
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:19,920
People brought their kids, people.

1470
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:34,920
Orange County parents were encouraged to pull their kids out of quote unquote real school and put them into for this week anti-communist school and watch really dry lectures about the commie thread.

1471
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:44,920
This event was put on by not just Walter Knott, but also the founder of the Crystal Cathedral down near Disneyland and Carl Karcher, a.k.a.

1472
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:45,920
Carl's Jr.

1473
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:47,920
Carl. Wow.

1474
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:52,920
Yeah, they put on a little anti-communist Coachella.

1475
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:53,920
Wow.

1476
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:54,920
Lasted all week.

1477
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:55,920
That's wild.

1478
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:58,920
Can't get that out of your head the next time you see a Carl's Jr.

1479
01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:00,920
He was like a Walter Knott.

1480
01:06:00,920 --> 01:06:03,920
These people made Walt Disney look like a socialist, I guess.

1481
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:04,920
Yeah, really?

1482
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:05,920
Yes.

1483
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:09,920
Much is made of the kind of traditional nature of Walt Disney, but he was nowhere near.

1484
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:14,920
You have to think about the kind of person that wants to create like an amusement park.

1485
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:24,920
Well, first of all, the kind of money that they have and like property ownership and where does that put you like a mass amount of property?

1486
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:26,920
Where does that put you politically?

1487
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:27,920
But what were you saying?

1488
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:30,920
Just that like, no, this is what the world should be.

1489
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:31,920
Oh, yeah.

1490
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:39,920
Carefully manicured that usually involves some element of like the way it was back in the old days.

1491
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:41,920
Yeah. You know, before all the stuff.

1492
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:44,920
Yeah. Remember a simpler time.

1493
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:47,920
They have been remembering simpler time.

1494
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:56,920
Like, I don't even know if anyone certainly no one's around for the simpler time, but it's just like, man, you guys started remembering the simpler time like a month later.

1495
01:06:56,920 --> 01:07:03,920
Well, also, like at this point, our old people talking about like the 60s and 70s as simpler times.

1496
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:06,920
Probably good strong gasoline.

1497
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:07,920
Yeah.

1498
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:11,920
Yeah. Everyone was everything was copacetic.

1499
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:17,920
My memory of circa 1968 is that things were functioning great.

1500
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:18,920
Yeah.

1501
01:07:18,920 --> 01:07:20,920
Everybody pretty chill.

1502
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:24,920
Most months had no significant assassinations.

1503
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:29,920
His entire weeks would go by without a very famous assassination.

1504
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:30,920
Yeah.

1505
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:32,920
An unthinkable assassination.

1506
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:41,920
There was also one of the big stars at this great school that kids got to go to was a guy named Herb Philbrick.

1507
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:48,920
And he would get up and say things like, the free world is shrinking and the communist controlled world is growing.

1508
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:50,920
It's the old salami tactic.

1509
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:52,920
One slice at a time.

1510
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:53,920
Well, Jason.

1511
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:55,920
Oh, the old salami tactic.

1512
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:56,920
Jason can get behind this.

1513
01:07:56,920 --> 01:07:57,920
Salami for lunch today.

1514
01:07:57,920 --> 01:07:58,920
Did you really?

1515
01:07:58,920 --> 01:07:59,920
Yeah.

1516
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:00,920
Okay.

1517
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:01,920
Well, Jimmy John's.

1518
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:02,920
Oh, really?

1519
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:03,920
Yeah.

1520
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:04,920
Okay.

1521
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:05,920
Well, you've heard the salami tactic before?

1522
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:06,920
Yeah.

1523
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:08,920
That's how I order every time.

1524
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:11,920
It's hard through these apps to order ahead and you put salami tactic.

1525
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:13,920
They don't know what the hell you're talking about.

1526
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:15,920
Use the salami tactic.

1527
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:16,920
Use the salami tactic.

1528
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:25,920
I mean, if that was an existing phrase or it became like if he was the first and last person to say salami tactic.

1529
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:30,920
Well, we haven't started to apply it to anything else, which I guess, you know, mission accomplished.

1530
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:32,920
It only refers to communism.

1531
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:39,920
Is it like you can trick people into eating 10 pounds of salami by serving them one slice at a time?

1532
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:45,920
You know, yeah, it's a much less elegant version of what is the thing of like boiling the frog?

1533
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:46,920
Boiling the frog.

1534
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:47,920
Yeah, yeah.

1535
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:48,920
Where they don't notice.

1536
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:49,920
Yeah.

1537
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:57,920
Just like you slowly turn up the temperature, you slowly feed person slice after slice of salami and they don't even realize they're eating pounds of salami.

1538
01:08:57,920 --> 01:08:58,920
You know what?

1539
01:08:58,920 --> 01:08:59,920
They're going to notice.

1540
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:03,920
They're going to eventually notice if it's in a period of time.

1541
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:07,920
Has anyone ever eaten lots of salami without realizing?

1542
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:10,920
Well, let's ask the guy who might have.

1543
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:13,920
Well, I was going to I thought it was more like the potato chip.

1544
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:18,920
Like, oh, you can't just eat one potato chip and then you just start eating potato chips and you're all the way in.

1545
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:20,920
That is better.

1546
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:22,920
That is much better because it comes in a bag.

1547
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:24,920
You maybe don't notice you're watching TV.

1548
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:31,920
I don't I can't imagine the scenario where like, God, an hour went by and sure enough, I'm full.

1549
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:34,920
My body is entirely full of salami now.

1550
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:37,920
You know how you when you start snacking on salami, you can't stop.

1551
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:39,920
You just keep going.

1552
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:40,920
I feel like football game.

1553
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:47,920
You got the big bowl and we've all wondered, does the host have some ulterior motive for me eating all this salami?

1554
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:49,920
Are they fattening me up?

1555
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:52,920
What's really behind this that I'm too blind to realize?

1556
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:55,920
No, keep eating, please.

1557
01:09:55,920 --> 01:10:00,920
You might get your home is my home and my salami is your salami.

1558
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:02,920
As long as it's all of it.

1559
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:08,920
I'm going to leave the salami out here next to this picket fence, this bucket of white paint with a brush.

1560
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:10,920
You know, just keep eating the salami.

1561
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:12,920
I'm not trying to like brushing it up.

1562
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:19,920
You to rely on me for your salami because you're no longer capable of getting your own salami.

1563
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:23,920
The salt and nitrates just hooks full salami freedom.

1564
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:25,920
I imagine you will.

1565
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:27,920
I don't want you to become dependent on me.

1566
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:29,920
Big Salami brother.

1567
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:40,920
Forever indoctrinated into only eating salami, trying to recruit others to eat salami.

1568
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:50,920
The other with this guy who is saying this, his old thing, he he would frame it as he was never asked back.

1569
01:10:54,920 --> 01:11:00,920
You were his speech went on to include 30 more somewhat inelegant salami related metaphors.

1570
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:03,920
The world about the casing is what really.

1571
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:13,920
It's like the entire earth is getting trapped in a giant salami casing sucking us closer, trapping in the taste.

1572
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:18,920
He had clearly eaten a submarine sandwich for lunch, but forgotten to write his speech.

1573
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:23,920
You're on in five.

1574
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:25,920
Okay, one sec.

1575
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:29,920
Maybe if you weren't so busy eating salami, you would have time to write your speech.

1576
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:31,920
Of course.

1577
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:42,920
But sure enough, the speech came to him quickly and as he got up exceedingly slowly lurched to the stage, his belly about to explode.

1578
01:11:44,920 --> 01:11:46,920
This was the children or?

1579
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:47,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1580
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:49,920
No, yeah, kids come.

1581
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:50,920
It's a day in a park.

1582
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:52,920
You get to skip school, right?

1583
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:55,920
Miss not is going to be there for that's very far.

1584
01:11:55,920 --> 01:12:05,920
The burger guy is going to be there and Herb Filbrick, an FBI spy, hid in a communist organization to rat on them.

1585
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:06,920
That's who this is.

1586
01:12:06,920 --> 01:12:08,920
That's Mr. Salami.

1587
01:12:08,920 --> 01:12:16,920
Why do you think that analogy or would like appeal to kids like kids would understand you kids?

1588
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:18,920
You kids understand salami.

1589
01:12:18,920 --> 01:12:21,920
You all use salami bags staring back at me.

1590
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:31,920
You kids who are just presented sandwiches and don't really think about where they come from or how the contents are acquired.

1591
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:40,920
Every Halloween going from door to door, getting fat with the salami slices you're handed for all you do is say trick or treat and you get it for free.

1592
01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:43,920
The commie price.

1593
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:45,920
One slice at a time.

1594
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:56,920
That's what's crazy is I forgot that wasn't even the one I was going to read and I'm sure glad I did now.

1595
01:12:56,920 --> 01:13:01,920
The other thing he said was communists are rough, tough, nasty, and they hate you.

1596
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:12,920
And then furthermore, the events organizers explained that anyone who considered this school alarmist may themselves be a communist.

1597
01:13:12,920 --> 01:13:13,920
Of course.

1598
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:14,920
Wow.

1599
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:15,920
Could you say it again?

1600
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:18,920
Rough, tough and nasty, tough, nasty, and they hate you.

1601
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:30,920
Anyone who says that the salami slice metaphor is confusing is undoubtedly a communist who probably had a big old lunch of salami.

1602
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:40,920
So Walter not look, he gave us some rides that we like and he set up one of the great speeches ever given.

1603
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:43,920
Two children.

1604
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:48,920
So this is, you know, John Birch Society and themed entertainment go hand in hand.

1605
01:13:48,920 --> 01:13:50,920
Always a great fit.

1606
01:13:50,920 --> 01:13:53,920
I don't think anything else on the bow craft.

1607
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:57,920
One thing that both craft the coaster seems like it was all right.

1608
01:13:57,920 --> 01:14:03,920
The coaster seems like a it's called the crossbow in keeping with the new to me.

1609
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:04,920
Oh, maybe it's new.

1610
01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:05,920
Okay.

1611
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:08,920
So they did not have anything that you were there.

1612
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:09,920
A decent size.

1613
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:11,920
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1614
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:15,920
Was it one of those like it fits in like a little pen?

1615
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:16,920
Yeah.

1616
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:17,920
Like, yeah.

1617
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:19,920
No, not going to know it.

1618
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:23,920
It had a genuine, decent set that like went up the hill.

1619
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:25,920
The crossbow was the name of it.

1620
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:27,920
Is there anything on it online?

1621
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:28,920
Yeah, you'd find.

1622
01:14:28,920 --> 01:14:29,920
They sold it off.

1623
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:35,920
The coaster kids, I believe, gave it mostly one scream or one point five screams.

1624
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:38,920
And said it was mostly very rattly.

1625
01:14:38,920 --> 01:14:44,920
Oh, I'm going to assume that the coaster kid rating is higher than one point five.

1626
01:14:44,920 --> 01:14:45,920
No, no.

1627
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:49,920
I'm sorry that these the total amount of screams you can get.

1628
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:52,920
Is it four or five or ten?

1629
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:53,920
How bad was this coast?

1630
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:54,920
I don't know.

1631
01:14:54,920 --> 01:14:56,920
Well, they were the only ones on it.

1632
01:14:56,920 --> 01:15:00,920
So if they made any noise, you would have heard it across the way.

1633
01:15:00,920 --> 01:15:08,920
Yeah, crossbow operated from July 2006 to 2018.

1634
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:09,920
There you go.

1635
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:16,920
Well, I'm happy to be here when you learned that this part got what I thought looked like an OK roller coaster.

1636
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:18,920
But the coaster kids have taught me is not.

1637
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:19,920
Yeah, the coaster kids would know.

1638
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:21,920
Yeah, I would know.

1639
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:25,920
I found a Reddit thread where people were remembering Bo craft.

1640
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:26,920
Did you see this?

1641
01:15:26,920 --> 01:15:28,920
No, I think.

1642
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:30,920
I think two things.

1643
01:15:30,920 --> 01:15:37,920
One one commenter said when I was growing up, this place had a reputation of being owned by white nationalists.

1644
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:43,920
And someone replied, no, not white nationalists, John Burt Society types, but not Nazis.

1645
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:45,920
So clearly got that clear.

1646
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:46,920
Let's be clear.

1647
01:15:46,920 --> 01:15:50,920
Just people who associate with a lot of Nazis.

1648
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:51,920
Yeah.

1649
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:52,920
Yeah.

1650
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:53,920
Crypto Nazis.

1651
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:54,920
Yeah.

1652
01:15:54,920 --> 01:16:04,920
The fact that I really like someone said fun fact about that carousel, assuming the setup didn't break by the last time your kid wrote it.

1653
01:16:04,920 --> 01:16:08,920
The music it played wasn't physically part of the ride in the middle.

1654
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:12,920
There was a CD player and a very large speaker.

1655
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:20,920
Whoever was operating the ride would have to climb into the middle and restart the music manually every time it finished.

1656
01:16:20,920 --> 01:16:24,920
Oh, that must be why it just played all the time.

1657
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:27,920
When I was there, they just restarted.

1658
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:29,920
They hit it on loop and just let it go.

1659
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:30,920
Yeah.

1660
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:31,920
You were near the carousel.

1661
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:34,920
You heard the carousel all at all times.

1662
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:35,920
Wow.

1663
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:41,920
So once CD players developed the loop option, they stopped making teens climb into the center.

1664
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:48,920
I think I did do the merry-go-round or carousel and I don't remember climbing in the middle.

1665
01:16:48,920 --> 01:16:52,920
Was it like a record album and you'd have to put the needle on the phone?

1666
01:16:52,920 --> 01:16:54,920
Oh, I don't know.

1667
01:16:54,920 --> 01:16:55,920
They didn't go into it.

1668
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:56,920
It's a wax cylinder.

1669
01:16:56,920 --> 01:17:02,920
They said they shazamed it and it was a mass-produced CD, but then they never found what the name was again.

1670
01:17:02,920 --> 01:17:04,920
Some lovely memories of the park.

1671
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:05,920
Yeah.

1672
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:08,920
And those are mankind's two memories.

1673
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:11,920
That's all that's left of this place.

1674
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:18,920
Yeah, the carousel was kind of janky and then another person chimed in and, hey, we didn't have a bunch of white nationalists on that.

1675
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:20,920
I was like, no, no.

1676
01:17:20,920 --> 01:17:22,920
It's just kind of white national.

1677
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:23,920
It was on the down-box.

1678
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:24,920
I don't know.

1679
01:17:24,920 --> 01:17:31,920
It didn't have any weirdness associated with it at the time.

1680
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:32,920
The rides went in circles.

1681
01:17:32,920 --> 01:17:36,920
If you got up above them, you would not see rides that went in swastika shapes.

1682
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:37,920
Yes.

1683
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:39,920
It's a very impractical shape for a ride.

1684
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:46,920
I know that's never where you plan to bring one of those Hugh Hefner towers so you could see it from above.

1685
01:17:46,920 --> 01:17:49,920
I'm going to inspect these rides.

1686
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:53,920
Make sure there's no weird shapes to talk about.

1687
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:59,920
Well, this is what really becomes the legacy of the place unless anybody has anything else.

1688
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:02,920
I had to the exit here.

1689
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:08,920
So as you said, Jason, it closes in like 2017, 2018 or so.

1690
01:18:08,920 --> 01:18:10,920
Fall.

1691
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:14,920
It just becomes like apartments, townhouses, just boring stuff.

1692
01:18:14,920 --> 01:18:16,920
For white supremacists.

1693
01:18:16,920 --> 01:18:20,920
They will only accept.

1694
01:18:20,920 --> 01:18:22,920
But what happens to all of these rides?

1695
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:24,920
You don't just have to get rid of the ride.

1696
01:18:24,920 --> 01:18:26,920
You don't just bulldoze them.

1697
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:28,920
There's another potential function of these things.

1698
01:18:28,920 --> 01:18:34,920
So all of the rides went up for sale on a website called rides for you dot com.

1699
01:18:34,920 --> 01:18:36,920
Number four.

1700
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:37,920
Number four.

1701
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:40,920
And you have rights for you right now.

1702
01:18:40,920 --> 01:18:42,920
Great. Perfect.

1703
01:18:42,920 --> 01:18:44,920
What a great thing to find out about.

1704
01:18:44,920 --> 01:18:45,920
Right.

1705
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:46,920
For you.

1706
01:18:46,920 --> 01:18:48,920
What you're going to say.

1707
01:18:48,920 --> 01:18:50,920
I think some of them are still on there.

1708
01:18:50,920 --> 01:18:55,920
And I mean all of them because the roller coaster was like it's everything from there was a price list.

1709
01:18:55,920 --> 01:19:00,920
Like even the biggest, most expensive one is still there.

1710
01:19:00,920 --> 01:19:05,920
I'm able to find a buyer post the demise of Michael Jackson.

1711
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:09,920
There are not a lot of buyers for small roller coasters out there.

1712
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:17,920
Yeah, that way you could buy that from for five hundred thousand down to a helicopter for five.

1713
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:20,920
Can you search by park?

1714
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:21,920
You can search.

1715
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:24,920
I'm looking at the you can go like use.

1716
01:19:24,920 --> 01:19:27,920
I think it actually has by part.

1717
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:29,920
It seems to be by some of it.

1718
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:38,920
You have to figure out the context where you would have to do some forensic work to figure out if that's it'll tell you like what year the ride is from.

1719
01:19:38,920 --> 01:19:39,920
But I don't know.

1720
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:41,920
You have to really you have to dig a little bit.

1721
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:45,920
It doesn't tell you if any of the rides are in the background of the Bruce Willis film.

1722
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:47,920
Mortal thoughts.

1723
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:50,920
Tilted worlds.

1724
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:53,920
There's a couple of Tilted worlds available under used.

1725
01:19:53,920 --> 01:19:56,920
There's one scrambler available.

1726
01:19:56,920 --> 01:19:58,920
This is I don't know how we have.

1727
01:19:58,920 --> 01:19:59,920
We've not come across this.

1728
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:01,920
This is shocking that we have no no no.

1729
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:03,920
We talk about trying to buy.

1730
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:06,920
Usually it's McDonald and stuff like playground equipment.

1731
01:20:06,920 --> 01:20:08,920
But we have not.

1732
01:20:08,920 --> 01:20:13,920
I mean, we've mentioned what rides we might want to own if we had our own ranch, let's say.

1733
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:16,920
But we have not seen this.

1734
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:18,920
I'm shocked that this hasn't come across our.

1735
01:20:18,920 --> 01:20:23,920
This is it's a it's a really good source for if it was ever going to be an opportunity.

1736
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:28,920
You know, there's probably some more work involved in terms of getting it out here unless we just go.

1737
01:20:28,920 --> 01:20:34,920
We let this drive our decisions and we go move to rural New Jersey.

1738
01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:35,920
It's not rural.

1739
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:38,920
Well, no, it isn't.

1740
01:20:38,920 --> 01:20:42,920
I mean, we will find rural New Jersey rebuild.

1741
01:20:42,920 --> 01:20:43,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1742
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:44,920
There you go.

1743
01:20:44,920 --> 01:20:45,920
Right, right.

1744
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:48,920
Buy this log flume for eight hundred thousand dollars.

1745
01:20:48,920 --> 01:20:52,920
You might have a log flume.

1746
01:20:52,920 --> 01:20:53,920
That's it.

1747
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:57,920
It's a lot to wrap your head around buying and like where is it all sitting right now?

1748
01:20:57,920 --> 01:20:59,920
A blog flume in parts.

1749
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:01,920
It's kind of crazy.

1750
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:04,920
Well, that's like that Batman and Robin roller coaster at Six Flags.

1751
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:12,920
Great Adventures sat like just the pieces were rusting in the woods for a while.

1752
01:21:12,920 --> 01:21:19,920
After because I think it was supposed to get flown to Brazil and then parts of it did and the park went under like some sort of crazy things.

1753
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:21,920
Wait, which what?

1754
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:29,920
There was a Batman and Robin themed after the Batman and Robin the movie from the late 90s and at what park?

1755
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:30,920
At Great Adventure.

1756
01:21:30,920 --> 01:21:34,920
Yeah, I remember that near freefall.

1757
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:36,920
It was I forget.

1758
01:21:36,920 --> 01:21:38,920
I've gotten rid of freefall.

1759
01:21:38,920 --> 01:21:50,920
But then this this opened and it was kind of controversial when it opened because it drew from the local power grid and kept causing brownouts.

1760
01:21:50,920 --> 01:21:52,920
The one ride.

1761
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:56,920
The one ride because it would do it would do like a zero to 60 zero to 70.

1762
01:21:56,920 --> 01:22:00,920
They would do a big launch and that requires a lot of power.

1763
01:22:00,920 --> 01:22:06,920
So like with universal bill, it's like we don't really feel like we're sorry.

1764
01:22:06,920 --> 01:22:10,920
The Incredible Hulk themed roller coaster universal Orlando.

1765
01:22:10,920 --> 01:22:14,920
They built a power substation just for this.

1766
01:22:14,920 --> 01:22:16,920
But Six Flags did not do that.

1767
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:29,920
They were on the main grid and just plugged into one outlet long extension cord and the residents pay the price that that that long film I believe is from Adventureland.

1768
01:22:29,920 --> 01:22:34,920
The place we talked about with Gabris and you could buy a Ferris wheel.

1769
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:36,920
You could buy a drop tower.

1770
01:22:36,920 --> 01:22:44,920
The double shot, which is from another strangely named Jersey Shore play lands castaway Cove.

1771
01:22:44,920 --> 01:22:45,920
Oh, this was in this year.

1772
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:49,920
Yes, you can buy that ride from rides for you.

1773
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:51,920
Yeah, I thought that was still there.

1774
01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:59,920
I think I also looked at unless I think it's possible that because they only show you pictures of the rides in context.

1775
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:05,920
And I think it's possible that they are selling rides before they have been removed from their initial setting.

1776
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:09,920
Oh, now maybe you're getting down the alarm about that practice.

1777
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:15,920
It just doesn't seem like a good because if people are paying the part that isn't that isn't it double dipping?

1778
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:17,920
Yeah, good.

1779
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:19,920
And isn't aren't there commies involved?

1780
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:31,920
This presence that one one last thing because you mentioned that because there was seemingly a big playland sign outside of Bo craft.

1781
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:33,920
Did you see the commercial?

1782
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:35,920
Yes, like 80s commercial.

1783
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:36,920
Yes, I have it.

1784
01:23:36,920 --> 01:23:40,920
Do you have a land wants to play it in Rye, New York?

1785
01:23:40,920 --> 01:23:41,920
Yeah.

1786
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:46,920
Oh, no, this is I think I think Bo craft was called Bo craft play land for is that what you're saying?

1787
01:23:46,920 --> 01:23:49,920
Yeah.

1788
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:57,920
The fabulous Bo craft amusement park experience with acres of fun for everyone rides the all new giant sky wheel the exciting bumper car rides.

1789
01:23:57,920 --> 01:24:01,920
Tilted world kiddie rides a fun filled day for everyone and close to home.

1790
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:03,920
So you save gas Bo craft amusement park.

1791
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:04,920
We're 22.

1792
01:24:04,920 --> 01:24:07,920
It's got planes open tonight till 11.

1793
01:24:07,920 --> 01:24:13,920
Seven of those.

1794
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:15,920
Not open tonight.

1795
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:18,920
Close today.

1796
01:24:18,920 --> 01:24:20,920
I've never seen the ad drive over.

1797
01:24:20,920 --> 01:24:22,920
Yeah, it's pretty fun.

1798
01:24:22,920 --> 01:24:26,920
I that was just there aren't that many YouTube results for Bo craft.

1799
01:24:26,920 --> 01:24:29,920
And that's like the first one decently produced.

1800
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:34,920
But they really stress the both of both of the ads out there stress the cheapness and the savings.

1801
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:40,920
Save money on gas like I that made me laugh.

1802
01:24:40,920 --> 01:24:43,920
So what do you want to go to great adventure for?

1803
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:44,920
What's so great about that?

1804
01:24:44,920 --> 01:24:48,920
Think about how much goddamn gas you would use.

1805
01:24:48,920 --> 01:24:56,920
I think the song in the ninety four one refers to cheapness.

1806
01:24:56,920 --> 01:24:58,920
Oh, my God. Yeah, you're right.

1807
01:24:58,920 --> 01:25:00,920
This Bo craft amusement park.

1808
01:25:00,920 --> 01:25:05,920
Yeah, I remember that price available 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. every day tonight.

1809
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:07,920
Yeah, that I totally remember.

1810
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:08,920
Wow.

1811
01:25:08,920 --> 01:25:11,920
That might have been when you worked there potentially.

1812
01:25:11,920 --> 01:25:12,920
I did.

1813
01:25:12,920 --> 01:25:15,920
I have one more thing from rides for you dot com.

1814
01:25:15,920 --> 01:25:18,920
I think we're all thinking about the opportunities.

1815
01:25:18,920 --> 01:25:21,920
This opens up Andrew, especially.

1816
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:25,920
This is your this is your shot for right.

1817
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:28,920
And to operate again, don't you get in?

1818
01:25:28,920 --> 01:25:33,920
Aren't you hankering to get the old the finger, the button pushing finger?

1819
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:38,920
But now you own the means of production as well.

1820
01:25:38,920 --> 01:25:43,920
That's the dream of a ride operator.

1821
01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:51,920
Well, this is the biggest opportunity that we all have is that, you know, like a big, tall thrill ride.

1822
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:52,920
That seems impossible.

1823
01:25:52,920 --> 01:25:55,920
Are we you have?

1824
01:25:55,920 --> 01:26:00,920
But this one ride owner for millennials through a ride ownership is just beyond.

1825
01:26:00,920 --> 01:26:02,920
Yes, our generation has been screwed.

1826
01:26:02,920 --> 01:26:04,920
It's like we'll never own a ride.

1827
01:26:04,920 --> 01:26:06,920
Our parents each had a couple of tilt the world.

1828
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:09,920
You guys are renting your thrill ride.

1829
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:11,920
Yeah.

1830
01:26:11,920 --> 01:26:14,920
Our only hope is that our parents fed the generationally.

1831
01:26:14,920 --> 01:26:16,920
We've become the right owner.

1832
01:26:16,920 --> 01:26:17,920
That's right.

1833
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:18,920
Yeah.

1834
01:26:18,920 --> 01:26:23,920
But so there's categories of ride.

1835
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:24,920
Right.

1836
01:26:24,920 --> 01:26:27,920
And there's there's still the world and scrambler and that kind of thing.

1837
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:29,920
And then I saw the tab dark ride.

1838
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:31,920
Oh, please, please, please.

1839
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:39,920
Because like Andrew generally, I think we start salivating over dark rides just to talk about or to think about because a lot of these rides are fun, but they don't have stories.

1840
01:26:40,920 --> 01:26:47,920
And with a dark ride, you get like an immersive world and a tale and the idea that they are selling every part of a dark ride.

1841
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:49,920
Yeah, so exciting to me.

1842
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:51,920
And it's not just any dark ride.

1843
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:56,920
It is a ride called Tomb Rider 3D.

1844
01:26:56,920 --> 01:27:03,920
It is a name that is a ripoff of Tomb Raider, but a font that is a ripoff of Indiana Jones.

1845
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:05,920
Yeah, yes.

1846
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:13,920
But a ride where if you watch the ride through is more of a ripoff of the Revenge of the Mummy from Universal.

1847
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:18,920
So it's a it's got a great little triptych of ripoff.

1848
01:27:18,920 --> 01:27:24,920
This ride was made by the Ripley's Believe It or Not organization.

1849
01:27:24,920 --> 01:27:31,920
This ride was in downtown San Antonio, literally across the street from the Alamo.

1850
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:32,920
Wow.

1851
01:27:32,920 --> 01:27:38,920
You can do a Google image of where this now closed ride was and then just whip it around and see the Alamo.

1852
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:42,920
Is there like a Hollywood Boulevard in front of the Alamo, like a tourist trap?

1853
01:27:42,920 --> 01:27:47,920
Yes, there is an entire it's all Ripley's and Guinness Book of World Records.

1854
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:49,920
Like the Great Pyramids.

1855
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:51,920
There's like the Pizza Hut right next to it.

1856
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:52,920
Right.

1857
01:27:52,920 --> 01:27:53,920
Of course.

1858
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:54,920
Is that one true?

1859
01:27:54,920 --> 01:27:55,920
It is.

1860
01:27:55,920 --> 01:27:59,920
I've seen pictures like through a Pizza Hut window of the Great Pyramids.

1861
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:00,920
Geez.

1862
01:28:00,920 --> 01:28:01,920
Well, bubblegum shrimp.

1863
01:28:01,920 --> 01:28:04,920
Very close to every historical landmark.

1864
01:28:07,920 --> 01:28:14,920
This ride, to bring up something that was mentioned a little earlier, this ride shared a wall with the Jimmy Johns.

1865
01:28:14,920 --> 01:28:16,920
Shared a wall.

1866
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:20,920
How lucky.

1867
01:28:20,920 --> 01:28:22,920
Something Jason could only dream of.

1868
01:28:23,920 --> 01:28:29,920
Did you have to put the connections together of like this ride looks familiar or does it list where it was?

1869
01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:36,920
I don't think it lists where it was, but it shows you the sign and it shows you every every part of it.

1870
01:28:36,920 --> 01:28:37,920
There's a lot of photos.

1871
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:39,920
Yeah, there's so many photos.

1872
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:46,920
There's the like there's the opening scene where there's like skeletons who can talk warning you not to go in there.

1873
01:28:46,920 --> 01:28:49,920
I guess they're trustworthy skeletons, not like some of the others.

1874
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:50,920
What's their game?

1875
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:57,920
There's like little root this black light rooms with here's bats and scale and bad skeletons stay away from the shoot those.

1876
01:28:57,920 --> 01:28:59,920
It's a laser tag, by the way.

1877
01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:01,920
Yeah, you have like it's a it's a buzz light year.

1878
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:02,920
Yes.

1879
01:29:02,920 --> 01:29:04,920
That look like the original Nintendo Zapper guns.

1880
01:29:04,920 --> 01:29:05,920
It is exactly like that.

1881
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:07,920
The cheapest little guns.

1882
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:18,920
I watched a ride through of it and I would say that the user like because the person filming has about point five percent accuracy and I am not blaming that person.

1883
01:29:18,920 --> 01:29:21,920
I am blaming the tiny, tiny targets.

1884
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:25,920
I think it's three hits for the entire ride, which is a long ride.

1885
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:28,920
This ride looks great.

1886
01:29:28,920 --> 01:29:30,920
It's a piece of American history.

1887
01:29:30,920 --> 01:29:32,920
I value much more than the Alamo.

1888
01:29:32,920 --> 01:29:38,920
I would love to get my my hands on it to start shooting skeletons again.

1889
01:29:38,920 --> 01:29:41,920
There's a really great thing on the front of or inside the ride.

1890
01:29:41,920 --> 01:29:47,920
They've just basically taped a sign reminding you to buy a photo at the end of the ride.

1891
01:29:47,920 --> 01:29:49,920
It's just literally like it's literally taped.

1892
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:50,920
Yes.

1893
01:29:50,920 --> 01:29:55,920
The front says don't don't forget view your right photo located at the exit elevators.

1894
01:29:55,920 --> 01:29:58,920
It's got that hot metal that you were rattling around.

1895
01:29:58,920 --> 01:30:01,920
It's going for it.

1896
01:30:01,920 --> 01:30:03,920
Do you know about that dark ride?

1897
01:30:03,920 --> 01:30:04,920
The scary ride.

1898
01:30:04,920 --> 01:30:10,920
I think it was also New Jersey that had a real dead body in it.

1899
01:30:10,920 --> 01:30:11,920
Jesus.

1900
01:30:11,920 --> 01:30:12,920
No, no.

1901
01:30:12,920 --> 01:30:13,920
No, no.

1902
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:14,920
Yeah.

1903
01:30:14,920 --> 01:30:16,920
One of the like, you know, like zombified.

1904
01:30:16,920 --> 01:30:23,920
It wasn't just like a skeleton because I feel like once a body is a skeleton, it's just like a skeleton.

1905
01:30:23,920 --> 01:30:26,920
But it was like some kind of like call it a body anymore.

1906
01:30:26,920 --> 01:30:27,920
Yeah.

1907
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:28,920
It's like the baby toddler designate.

1908
01:30:28,920 --> 01:30:30,920
It's the opposite of the baby toddler.

1909
01:30:30,920 --> 01:30:33,920
It was like a skeleton of a dead guy.

1910
01:30:33,920 --> 01:30:38,920
But like it was like more than that.

1911
01:30:38,920 --> 01:30:43,920
And it was in this it was on that that old the old HBO autopsy show.

1912
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:44,920
Wow.

1913
01:30:44,920 --> 01:30:45,920
Really?

1914
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:46,920
Yeah.

1915
01:30:46,920 --> 01:30:47,920
Where?

1916
01:30:47,920 --> 01:30:51,920
I think it was somewhere in New Jersey like in like Seaside or something.

1917
01:30:51,920 --> 01:30:52,920
Jesus.

1918
01:30:52,920 --> 01:30:57,920
And they were like where did this body come from?

1919
01:30:57,920 --> 01:30:59,920
And just there for a long time.

1920
01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:00,920
Yeah.

1921
01:31:00,920 --> 01:31:01,920
Whoa.

1922
01:31:01,920 --> 01:31:02,920
Wow.

1923
01:31:02,920 --> 01:31:06,920
Listeners, if you know if you've seen this episode of autopsy, let us know.

1924
01:31:06,920 --> 01:31:07,920
Is this coming to Max?

1925
01:31:07,920 --> 01:31:11,920
We'll be able to see that on Max.

1926
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:13,920
Are they going to keep the question?

1927
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:16,920
Are you going to keep the old autopsies on after you turn it into Max?

1928
01:31:16,920 --> 01:31:17,920
Wait, can I ask a question?

1929
01:31:17,920 --> 01:31:20,920
Where is Cinemax in all of this?

1930
01:31:20,920 --> 01:31:21,920
That's what I wanted to know.

1931
01:31:21,920 --> 01:31:22,920
Cinemax is so weird, right?

1932
01:31:22,920 --> 01:31:24,920
They were just like, but we're Matt.

1933
01:31:24,920 --> 01:31:27,920
Like and they just like shoved them aside.

1934
01:31:27,920 --> 01:31:28,920
You don't count.

1935
01:31:28,920 --> 01:31:29,920
They don't have to listen to you.

1936
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:30,920
Nice Max.

1937
01:31:30,920 --> 01:31:33,920
Get yourself one.

1938
01:31:33,920 --> 01:31:35,920
Did Cinemax become something else?

1939
01:31:35,920 --> 01:31:38,920
Did they become like is stars or epics?

1940
01:31:38,920 --> 01:31:39,920
The former Cinemax?

1941
01:31:39,920 --> 01:31:40,920
I don't know.

1942
01:31:40,920 --> 01:31:42,920
I think Cinemax is still around though.

1943
01:31:42,920 --> 01:31:43,920
Is it regular form?

1944
01:31:43,920 --> 01:31:44,920
I could be wrong.

1945
01:31:44,920 --> 01:31:45,920
They just ceded the Max.

1946
01:31:45,920 --> 01:31:46,920
I got to check that out.

1947
01:31:46,920 --> 01:31:50,920
Are they part of the family of?

1948
01:31:50,920 --> 01:31:53,920
I think David Zaslov made them a part of it.

1949
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:57,920
Put a knife to their throats.

1950
01:31:57,920 --> 01:31:58,920
Give up the Max.

1951
01:31:58,920 --> 01:32:04,920
It used to be HBO got like the new release movies first that were out of theaters and

1952
01:32:04,920 --> 01:32:07,920
then they would move to Showtime or Cinemax.

1953
01:32:07,920 --> 01:32:14,920
In current times, the HBO Max recently added lists like Miss Congeniality.

1954
01:32:14,920 --> 01:32:15,920
Check it out.

1955
01:32:15,920 --> 01:32:16,920
Wow.

1956
01:32:16,920 --> 01:32:19,920
It was known for having the like soft core porn.

1957
01:32:19,920 --> 01:32:20,920
Yeah.

1958
01:32:20,920 --> 01:32:21,920
Yeah.

1959
01:32:21,920 --> 01:32:22,920
Yeah.

1960
01:32:22,920 --> 01:32:24,920
It says add Cinemax to your TV subscription now.

1961
01:32:24,920 --> 01:32:25,920
It's still its own thing.

1962
01:32:25,920 --> 01:32:26,920
I think it's still something.

1963
01:32:26,920 --> 01:32:31,920
It says that there's also another thing that says some Cinemax content is on HBO Max.

1964
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:34,920
But apparently you can just order Cinemax.

1965
01:32:34,920 --> 01:32:35,920
Huh?

1966
01:32:35,920 --> 01:32:36,920
Wait.

1967
01:32:36,920 --> 01:32:39,920
They have worked out a deal then that makes it.

1968
01:32:39,920 --> 01:32:40,920
Wait, it is.

1969
01:32:40,920 --> 01:32:41,920
It's owned by HBO.

1970
01:32:41,920 --> 01:32:44,920
It is part of our discovery.

1971
01:32:44,920 --> 01:32:45,920
Mystery solved.

1972
01:32:45,920 --> 01:32:48,920
How like insulting that no one was concerned.

1973
01:32:48,920 --> 01:32:50,920
There'd be confusion.

1974
01:32:50,920 --> 01:32:52,920
Everyone's just trying to lie low.

1975
01:32:52,920 --> 01:32:54,920
They're not trying to ruffle any feathers.

1976
01:32:54,920 --> 01:32:57,920
Just take Cinemax's name.

1977
01:32:57,920 --> 01:33:00,920
No one's just going to do it.

1978
01:33:00,920 --> 01:33:01,920
They won't care.

1979
01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:02,920
Do ya?

1980
01:33:02,920 --> 01:33:03,920
Do ya?

1981
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:04,920
What are you going to stand up for yourself Cinemax?

1982
01:33:04,920 --> 01:33:05,920
Cinemax?

1983
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:06,920
No sir.

1984
01:33:06,920 --> 01:33:09,920
What are you going to hit me with your soft core porn?

1985
01:33:09,920 --> 01:33:13,920
Some people, some people prefer that.

1986
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:16,920
You're going to scramble my face like you're a screen is scrambled.

1987
01:33:16,920 --> 01:33:18,920
They don't admit they watch me, but they do.

1988
01:33:18,920 --> 01:33:21,920
It's a formative part of everyone's upbringing.

1989
01:33:21,920 --> 01:33:22,920
Yeah.

1990
01:33:22,920 --> 01:33:24,920
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

1991
01:33:24,920 --> 01:33:27,920
It's a good transition porn.

1992
01:33:27,920 --> 01:33:31,920
Nothing too shocking and maybe a little story in there too.

1993
01:33:31,920 --> 01:33:33,920
No horror.

1994
01:33:33,920 --> 01:33:37,920
I wish we could buy pieces of Tomb Raider.

1995
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:38,920
Just some of it?

1996
01:33:38,920 --> 01:33:39,920
Maybe they piecemeal it.

1997
01:33:39,920 --> 01:33:40,920
It's all or nothing.

1998
01:33:40,920 --> 01:33:41,920
Well we don't know.

1999
01:33:41,920 --> 01:33:44,920
It's all or nothing, but if you talk to the owner, maybe we talk to the owners, which

2000
01:33:44,920 --> 01:33:48,920
we know of their names because they're in these articles.

2001
01:33:48,920 --> 01:33:50,920
And I have to look down at my phone.

2002
01:33:50,920 --> 01:33:54,920
But I bet it's a buyer's market on all these rides.

2003
01:33:57,920 --> 01:34:01,920
Tomb Raider is expensive though.

2004
01:34:01,920 --> 01:34:03,920
But cheaper than a lot of them.

2005
01:34:03,920 --> 01:34:04,920
Yeah.

2006
01:34:04,920 --> 01:34:05,920
You can buy a Tilt The World.

2007
01:34:05,920 --> 01:34:06,920
It's just a down payment on a house.

2008
01:34:06,920 --> 01:34:08,920
You can buy a Tilt The World.

2009
01:34:08,920 --> 01:34:09,920
You can actually live in it.

2010
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:10,920
That's what you do.

2011
01:34:10,920 --> 01:34:12,920
You double up and we all do it.

2012
01:34:12,920 --> 01:34:13,920
Yeah.

2013
01:34:13,920 --> 01:34:15,920
Our families live together now in this tomb.

2014
01:34:15,920 --> 01:34:17,920
There's a Kmart.

2015
01:34:17,920 --> 01:34:18,920
A fake tomb.

2016
01:34:18,920 --> 01:34:19,920
A fun tomb.

2017
01:34:19,920 --> 01:34:23,920
We live in a parking lot not too far away and no one's really in there right now.

2018
01:34:23,920 --> 01:34:26,920
So you mean the tomb raider in there?

2019
01:34:26,920 --> 01:34:27,920
Yeah.

2020
01:34:27,920 --> 01:34:28,920
It's 250,000.

2021
01:34:28,920 --> 01:34:29,920
Yeah.

2022
01:34:29,920 --> 01:34:30,920
For Tomb Raider.

2023
01:34:30,920 --> 01:34:35,920
And all it would entail is that our kids wake up every morning, see the shape of the shadowy

2024
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:40,920
shape of a person and wonder if it is their mom and dad or the other mom and dads who

2025
01:34:40,920 --> 01:34:43,920
live there or scary skeletons.

2026
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:48,920
The worst thing is their keys are just the old laser guns and they can't get in the

2027
01:34:48,920 --> 01:34:49,920
house.

2028
01:34:49,920 --> 01:34:50,920
30 minutes.

2029
01:34:50,920 --> 01:34:51,920
I can't hit it.

2030
01:34:51,920 --> 01:34:52,920
There's no way in.

2031
01:34:52,920 --> 01:34:53,920
I have to pee.

2032
01:34:53,920 --> 01:34:54,920
All right.

2033
01:34:54,920 --> 01:34:55,920
All right.

2034
01:34:55,920 --> 01:34:56,920
Wait.

2035
01:34:56,920 --> 01:34:57,920
How about this?

2036
01:34:57,920 --> 01:35:00,920
Wait, there's a different dark ride where you can just buy the two passenger vehicles,

2037
01:35:00,920 --> 01:35:02,920
which were made by Sally Dark Ride.

2038
01:35:02,920 --> 01:35:03,920
It looks like you're like in a barrel.

2039
01:35:03,920 --> 01:35:04,920
Sally Dark Ride.

2040
01:35:04,920 --> 01:35:05,920
Very famous company.

2041
01:35:05,920 --> 01:35:06,920
We love Sally.

2042
01:35:06,920 --> 01:35:07,920
Sally's like kind of the DI.

2043
01:35:07,920 --> 01:35:09,920
They're like the indie cool ride makers.

2044
01:35:09,920 --> 01:35:10,920
Not all corporate.

2045
01:35:10,920 --> 01:35:13,920
They don't follow the rules.

2046
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:17,920
But this, we could buy just the vehicles and then we could take them over to the big dog

2047
01:35:17,920 --> 01:35:20,920
garage and we could convert them into real cars.

2048
01:35:20,920 --> 01:35:21,920
Oh, yeah.

2049
01:35:21,920 --> 01:35:24,920
Drive those around bourbon, go to the Bob's big boy and show them off.

2050
01:35:24,920 --> 01:35:25,920
Mm hmm.

2051
01:35:25,920 --> 01:35:26,920
So that would be good too.

2052
01:35:26,920 --> 01:35:29,920
We're doing it for, but we have to get the permission of Jay Leno's garage to do this.

2053
01:35:29,920 --> 01:35:30,920
Well, permission.

2054
01:35:30,920 --> 01:35:33,920
We're paying them to actually make them into real working vehicles.

2055
01:35:33,920 --> 01:35:36,920
Oh, we're paying for their mechanical services.

2056
01:35:36,920 --> 01:35:38,920
And by that you mean Jay himself.

2057
01:35:38,920 --> 01:35:41,920
Yeah, I can make that can get this employee there, I assume.

2058
01:35:41,920 --> 01:35:44,920
Well, no, because there was his friend who pulled him out.

2059
01:35:44,920 --> 01:35:46,920
I know all about that fire.

2060
01:35:46,920 --> 01:35:48,920
Sat on him and put out the fire.

2061
01:35:48,920 --> 01:35:53,920
I was admitting a story I knew very well about Jay Leno's burn to make a joke.

2062
01:35:53,920 --> 01:35:58,920
But thank God there's other people who work there or it could have been much worse for old Jay.

2063
01:35:58,920 --> 01:36:03,920
Yeah, Jay, what do you got that motorcycle accident and the burn within like three weeks of each other?

2064
01:36:03,920 --> 01:36:06,920
But no, now he's going to build us a real car.

2065
01:36:06,920 --> 01:36:10,920
Now things are looking up for Jay because, wait, look, the show's been off the air.

2066
01:36:10,920 --> 01:36:12,920
The guy needs a job.

2067
01:36:12,920 --> 01:36:13,920
Yeah.

2068
01:36:13,920 --> 01:36:21,920
Besides working, besides doing probably like 400 standup dates within 365 days a year.

2069
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:26,920
500 episodes of You Bet Your Life that he films within three weeks.

2070
01:36:26,920 --> 01:36:31,920
If that if that same video voiceover guy said, come see Jay Leno stand up.

2071
01:36:31,920 --> 01:36:32,920
He's on tonight.

2072
01:36:32,920 --> 01:36:34,920
He would be correct on any night.

2073
01:36:34,920 --> 01:36:35,920
Any night.

2074
01:36:35,920 --> 01:36:40,920
Why is this 22 meter Ferris wheel only two hundred thousand dollars?

2075
01:36:40,920 --> 01:36:41,920
That seems suspicious.

2076
01:36:41,920 --> 01:36:43,920
What year? What year is it?

2077
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:44,920
Hmm.

2078
01:36:44,920 --> 01:36:45,920
What year?

2079
01:36:45,920 --> 01:36:46,920
Let's see.

2080
01:36:46,920 --> 01:36:50,920
It is a ninety nine ninety four model.

2081
01:36:50,920 --> 01:36:51,920
Technical year.

2082
01:36:51,920 --> 01:36:52,920
Good year. Good year for you.

2083
01:36:52,920 --> 01:36:55,920
We need to become like car guys in that regard.

2084
01:36:55,920 --> 01:36:56,920
Yeah.

2085
01:36:56,920 --> 01:36:57,920
Oh yeah. What year is your Ferris wheel?

2086
01:36:57,920 --> 01:36:58,920
Yeah.

2087
01:36:58,920 --> 01:36:59,920
In eighty seven. Oh, beauty.

2088
01:36:59,920 --> 01:37:01,920
What a beauty.

2089
01:37:01,920 --> 01:37:02,920
Great year.

2090
01:37:02,920 --> 01:37:03,920
Great year.

2091
01:37:03,920 --> 01:37:04,920
You just got it.

2092
01:37:04,920 --> 01:37:06,920
Ninety five was a bad year.

2093
01:37:06,920 --> 01:37:09,920
Because this one is five hundred forty nine thousand.

2094
01:37:09,920 --> 01:37:11,920
Well, this if we know it's a twenty eighteen.

2095
01:37:11,920 --> 01:37:14,920
So it's right off the showroom floor.

2096
01:37:14,920 --> 01:37:15,920
It's like buying a used car.

2097
01:37:15,920 --> 01:37:16,920
Yeah.

2098
01:37:16,920 --> 01:37:17,920
Yeah.

2099
01:37:17,920 --> 01:37:18,920
That's it.

2100
01:37:18,920 --> 01:37:21,920
It depends on if you want classics or the new sky diver is the one I was talking about

2101
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:24,920
where they're attached.

2102
01:37:24,920 --> 01:37:25,920
OK. Yeah.

2103
01:37:25,920 --> 01:37:27,920
At the front and back.

2104
01:37:27,920 --> 01:37:28,920
Oh, I see.

2105
01:37:28,920 --> 01:37:29,920
Yeah.

2106
01:37:29,920 --> 01:37:32,920
How much a skydiver going for?

2107
01:37:32,920 --> 01:37:39,920
You can get what's it going to take to get you into a skydiver tonight.

2108
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:43,920
I can go as low as eighty nine thousand.

2109
01:37:43,920 --> 01:37:44,920
Oh, God.

2110
01:37:44,920 --> 01:37:47,920
I mean, I look my wife wants me to bring.

2111
01:37:47,920 --> 01:37:48,920
All right.

2112
01:37:48,920 --> 01:37:52,920
Not a penny more than 90.

2113
01:37:52,920 --> 01:37:53,920
No, it infeas.

2114
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:54,920
I'm watching.

2115
01:37:54,920 --> 01:37:57,920
I'm looking over this contract.

2116
01:37:57,920 --> 01:37:59,920
Well, look, we're going to we're going to get down to press.

2117
01:37:59,920 --> 01:38:01,920
We're going to figure this out.

2118
01:38:01,920 --> 01:38:04,920
We're going to somebody here is going to buy a ride and the sand.

2119
01:38:04,920 --> 01:38:09,920
We will make sure that the slow the show slowly becomes very technical and lacking in comedy.

2120
01:38:09,920 --> 01:38:10,920
Yeah.

2121
01:38:10,920 --> 01:38:14,920
Just like Jay's transition from the show to Leno's garage course, which where there is

2122
01:38:14,920 --> 01:38:15,920
no room for jokes.

2123
01:38:15,920 --> 01:38:17,920
That is not what he's there for.

2124
01:38:17,920 --> 01:38:19,920
We are there for there for car information.

2125
01:38:19,920 --> 01:38:20,920
Yes.

2126
01:38:20,920 --> 01:38:23,920
Closing thoughts about Bo Craft.

2127
01:38:23,920 --> 01:38:25,920
Fun to go back mentally.

2128
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:26,920
Yeah.

2129
01:38:26,920 --> 01:38:27,920
The commercial.

2130
01:38:27,920 --> 01:38:29,920
I had not heard that as many years.

2131
01:38:29,920 --> 01:38:32,920
And it reminded you of helpful information.

2132
01:38:32,920 --> 01:38:37,920
Reminded you of the value of saving gas for your entertainment purposes.

2133
01:38:37,920 --> 01:38:39,920
Yeah, like local commercials.

2134
01:38:39,920 --> 01:38:41,920
I feel like that's not a thing anymore.

2135
01:38:41,920 --> 01:38:42,920
Yeah, that's true.

2136
01:38:42,920 --> 01:38:43,920
Yeah.

2137
01:38:43,920 --> 01:38:44,920
Yeah, I do miss it.

2138
01:38:44,920 --> 01:38:47,920
Well, that's part of you know, it's not things not the way things used to be.

2139
01:38:47,920 --> 01:38:50,920
Can we go back to our simpler time?

2140
01:38:50,920 --> 01:38:53,920
Yeah.

2141
01:38:53,920 --> 01:38:57,920
Something that was around the corner needs to be advertised to me on TV.

2142
01:38:57,920 --> 01:39:01,920
Well, I'm glad you could return to a simpler time with us.

2143
01:39:01,920 --> 01:39:05,920
Chansey Winford, you survived podcast The Ride.

2144
01:39:05,920 --> 01:39:09,920
Let's exit through the gift shop because I know you definitely have something to plug.

2145
01:39:09,920 --> 01:39:16,920
You were part of one of the main creative minds behind this show, Jury Duty on Free V.

2146
01:39:16,920 --> 01:39:25,920
I don't mean to make you just pitch the show, but it is a crazy like unprecedented reality

2147
01:39:25,920 --> 01:39:28,920
bending. I believe I said that's accurate, right?

2148
01:39:28,920 --> 01:39:29,920
Yes.

2149
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:34,920
And it doesn't quite feel pranky because there's no like gotchaism to.

2150
01:39:34,920 --> 01:39:37,920
Yeah, so I stand by my earlier statements.

2151
01:39:37,920 --> 01:39:41,920
Yes, and I stand by my prank refusal.

2152
01:39:41,920 --> 01:39:43,920
What can you tell us about Jury?

2153
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:58,920
Yes, so we this guy Ronald answered an ad, a Craigslist ad to be part of a documentary about the legal system on following a jury in a trial.

2154
01:39:58,920 --> 01:40:05,920
We picked him and he showed up for this trial and got on the jury.

2155
01:40:05,920 --> 01:40:18,920
And we kept him sequestered for 17 days without his phone, living in a hotel with four of the actors actually lived at the hotel with him.

2156
01:40:18,920 --> 01:40:24,920
He's just he's surrounded day and night as an entire world of actors, trial and what he goes home to.

2157
01:40:24,920 --> 01:40:30,920
Everyone he basically ever encountered in the 17 days was an actor.

2158
01:40:30,920 --> 01:40:37,920
Yeah, it was incredible that we pulled this off.

2159
01:40:37,920 --> 01:40:44,920
Just because any time you try to do something funny or even that is an opportunity to blow it.

2160
01:40:44,920 --> 01:40:45,920
Yeah, yeah, right.

2161
01:40:45,920 --> 01:41:11,920
And it's not like it's like reverse Borat where like instead of having one sky controlling everything with a bunch of people who don't know you have a bunch of people steering this and trying to work like having to trust everyone from top to bottom to every day not screw up.

2162
01:41:11,920 --> 01:41:13,920
And we somehow didn't.

2163
01:41:13,920 --> 01:41:15,920
An immersive environment you created.

2164
01:41:15,920 --> 01:41:16,920
Yeah.

2165
01:41:16,920 --> 01:41:17,920
Much like Walter Knot.

2166
01:41:17,920 --> 01:41:19,920
Manicured worlds.

2167
01:41:19,920 --> 01:41:22,920
Our anti-communist message comes through.

2168
01:41:22,920 --> 01:41:36,920
Yeah, we built this like world around him and he became involved like emotionally invested in like these other people's like drama that we threw at him like forced him to be a part of.

2169
01:41:36,920 --> 01:41:48,920
This is the craziest thing about it I feel is that like the pulling it off is one thing but then it becomes like a it functions as a sitcom also where you are into the characters.

2170
01:41:48,920 --> 01:41:50,920
So many funny people in it.

2171
01:41:50,920 --> 01:41:57,920
You are following their stories and sometimes you can like lose sight of the fact that like oh wait he's not right.

2172
01:41:57,920 --> 01:42:04,920
They are fake and he is real and he doesn't know that they're fake like it like the stories work even regardless of that which is fascinating.

2173
01:42:04,920 --> 01:42:05,920
Yeah.

2174
01:42:05,920 --> 01:42:26,920
And also we had to create a court case a civil lawsuit that he would sit there and listen to and think about for hours a day and like like witnesses coming up and we'd like write you know bunch of dumb shit for this like expert witness.

2175
01:42:26,920 --> 01:42:29,920
And like everything had to like line up like.

2176
01:42:29,920 --> 01:42:41,920
Yeah, you couldn't like you're watching the viewer now on free V is watching the like greatest hits and the fun stuff that happened but you had to sell the reality and make a bunch of boring.

2177
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:58,920
Well, yeah, we would have we had witnesses that didn't make the show to fill more court time a witness would sit there for like an hour and a half or something doing like dry testimony that had like two jokes in it because that's what we're going to show and we didn't want it.

2178
01:42:58,920 --> 01:43:12,920
To stand out you know it's like anytime they something like strange happens and and he might be like wait a minute you have to follow that with hours of nothing.

2179
01:43:12,920 --> 01:43:22,920
That's the thing is like it's like well these people are kind of crazy and like James Marsden is here.

2180
01:43:22,920 --> 01:43:39,920
Yes, that's true. Yes, the real actor as himself is serving jury. Yes. Yes. It's like is this some kind of like prank or something and then you just watch James Marsden sit there doing nothing for six hours and I guess it's probably not.

2181
01:43:39,920 --> 01:43:50,920
He is not getting up to a story clearly yeah yeah every time around I'm not in the TV business but this does not seem like a TV show.

2182
01:43:50,920 --> 01:44:07,920
It's so crazy and just and relevant to the listener one of the episode episode four I will direct me I mean watch all of them but I will direct people specifically to episode four which films at a hallowed location for you the Clifford's I'll say again.

2183
01:44:07,920 --> 01:44:26,920
There is an entire sequence of the show filmed at Margaritaville in City Walk where you had to take over you got to you had the honor of having full run one of our favorite place yet do you want to know that I've been in like the kitchen and the bathroom.

2184
01:44:26,920 --> 01:44:40,920
Yes, all the racks there any the whole episode we did filthy Jimmy would never allow that. No the kitchen seemed like normal kitchen then there's like if you know the layout I assume you do.

2185
01:44:40,920 --> 01:44:42,920
Oh yeah sure.

2186
01:44:42,920 --> 01:45:11,920
So you got the you got the bar you got the blender at the front you get the store behind the stage is this like another kitchen but like a sort of smaller and I have in there a lot but that soda machine didn't work so then on the other side at the top of like that ramp by the gift shop is a little like hidey hole that has a soda machine in it and like some other so I hung out I would just stay in there.

2187
01:45:11,920 --> 01:45:15,920
And I had an ear wig in because I donned the blue.

2188
01:45:15,920 --> 01:45:23,920
Oh my god yes wow and I was on the floor for the ultimate blue uniform in our society.

2189
01:45:23,920 --> 01:45:27,920
Honestly, I may have been wearing these very same pants.

2190
01:45:27,920 --> 01:45:29,920
My pants are perfect.

2191
01:45:29,920 --> 01:45:42,920
I still have the black sketches I was given to be because I had to be consistent with the uniform of a Margaritaville employee because I was on the floor with an ear wig.

2192
01:45:42,920 --> 01:46:03,920
Because the whole restaurant was extras the waiters were mostly real waiters but one the one who interacts with the group is an actress and so I had to if any extras were acting up or to give the actors any notes like if Ronald got up to the bathroom you know we pulled them away somewhere I would have to run up to them and be like do this or whatever.

2193
01:46:03,920 --> 01:46:05,920
Oh he's got a chance to like give some notes.

2194
01:46:05,920 --> 01:46:07,920
So you can see me a couple times.

2195
01:46:07,920 --> 01:46:10,920
Wow yes I did see you in the yeah yeah you're in the cut.

2196
01:46:10,920 --> 01:46:11,920
Yeah.

2197
01:46:11,920 --> 01:46:15,920
Wear like hey and back to the BoKreff roots.

2198
01:46:15,920 --> 01:46:19,920
Yeah I've worn a lot of fun colorful uniform.

2199
01:46:19,920 --> 01:46:36,920
I read an interview also with Jake Simansky who directed the show great guy Funny or Die alum and he said that you Ronald the real person is aware that there's cameras for a lot of it but in this particular case you're the real person.

2200
01:46:36,920 --> 01:46:45,920
Yeah there's a lot of it but in this particular incident he did not know like it was all hidden cameras that had to be built into the Margaritaville surroundings.

2201
01:46:45,920 --> 01:47:03,920
Because the Margaritaville was just like they had the night off to hang out together so the cameras weren't going to be watching them but yes we built all these hides it's like bamboo hut with the with a mirror.

2202
01:47:03,920 --> 01:47:11,920
Another just like mirrored column that was hollow with that guy was in and is that then wait a mirror that it can shoot through on the other end.

2203
01:47:11,920 --> 01:47:26,920
Wow a lot of that if you ever are in a situation that you're not sure about and you see inexplicable mirrors all over the place you're probably on some sort of show you haven't been told about.

2204
01:47:26,920 --> 01:47:42,920
Go to go to free V where I believe is this episode is coming out all the episodes are now posted crazy to watch what you guys pulled off but also that it's funny and fun to not just like social experiment and that's yeah it's fun characters.

2205
01:47:42,920 --> 01:47:50,920
Yeah, everybody did a great job and you're a streaming service that literally has free in the name and you can see it anywhere which is a nice change of pace.

2206
01:47:50,920 --> 01:47:52,920
Yeah apparently not Canada.

2207
01:47:52,920 --> 01:47:53,920
Oh OK.

2208
01:47:53,920 --> 01:47:54,920
Disappointed Canada.

2209
01:47:54,920 --> 01:47:55,920
Well sorry.

2210
01:47:55,920 --> 01:47:57,920
Well if there's any content.

2211
01:47:57,920 --> 01:47:58,920
Anyone in America.

2212
01:47:58,920 --> 01:48:00,920
A country that matters.

2213
01:48:02,920 --> 01:48:05,920
We ignore we don't even want to hear the word we call our Canadian listeners.

2214
01:48:05,920 --> 01:48:06,920
Amazon was like.

2215
01:48:06,920 --> 01:48:07,920
You wish you got Clifford.

2216
01:48:07,920 --> 01:48:11,920
Amazon was like this is going to be available worldwide and I was like uh uh.

2217
01:48:12,920 --> 01:48:14,920
Not as filthy.

2218
01:48:14,920 --> 01:48:24,920
As a John Birch Society member a lot of feelings about the go to free V and thank you for doing it in a place where the where the V is free.

2219
