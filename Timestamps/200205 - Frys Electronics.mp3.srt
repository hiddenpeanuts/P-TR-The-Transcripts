1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,880
Welcome to a podcast, The Ride,

3
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,200
that I have been building up to my entire life.

4
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:29,480
I'm Scott Gardner and joined by Mike Carlson

5
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,080
and Jason Sheridan, hey fellas.

6
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:31,920
Hi.

7
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,600
Yeah, there's a nervous energy in the room

8
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,640
that this is gonna even go well.

9
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,320
Pressure's on, pressure's on.

10
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,160
I've been thinking about it,

11
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,900
but that can't be where I come from.

12
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:44,800
I have to come from a place of enjoyment.

13
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,640
Yes.

14
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,400
Because when I realized that this podcast

15
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,360
was potentially the outlet for me to talk about

16
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,400
this area of fascination that I've had forever,

17
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,160
which is Fry's Electronics,

18
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,400
when it all came together, of course,

19
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,600
this is where I can finally,

20
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,200
because I didn't know, there was one point in time

21
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:07,480
where I thought, should I try to make a documentary

22
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:10,080
where I go to every single Fry's

23
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,640
and explore the theme of every single Fry's?

24
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,480
That doesn't seem like a good idea.

25
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:17,960
Sort of a My Date with Drew, following your journey.

26
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,680
Oh, absolutely, and it'd be cute as hell.

27
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,520
Yeah.

28
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,320
It's a super, super watered down, super size me,

29
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,640
where I don't get unhealthy or learn any of that.

30
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,000
I just waste a lot of time.

31
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,320
But it's this, this is where I put it,

32
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,920
and I'm ready for it.

33
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,880
I think the documentary, though, still could happen.

34
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:43,040
I think, well, maybe there's more interest in it now,

35
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,160
but I'm gonna have to do it quick,

36
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:47,800
because I don't know how much time these stores have left.

37
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,760
If anyone on the Patreon has a bunch of money

38
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:54,440
to make documentaries, and they wanna fund this,

39
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,400
please contact us soon.

40
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,840
Yeah.

41
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,840
Look at you, Kevin Perger.

42
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:04,080
Oh yeah, he's a documentary funder.

43
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,080
That's right, that can be number two,

44
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:09,480
after the HALIX one we're in that's on the way.

45
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:12,320
So let me ask, because the long and short,

46
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:15,560
Fry's Electronics, chain of electronics stores,

47
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,600
I was unfamiliar with until,

48
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,040
I had lived out here for a few years.

49
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,480
There's one by the Burbank Airport,

50
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,000
and I used to work over there,

51
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,400
I used to work at a post house,

52
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,720
and some of the engineers, that was sort of like,

53
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,720
their go-to place for cables or components,

54
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,320
and then sometimes I think of, they're just like,

55
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,280
oh, I'm gonna treat myself at lunch, I'll go to Fry's.

56
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,120
Because it's-

57
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,280
I don't know if I call that a treat, but sure.

58
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,240
Well, I think for engineers, that is a treat.

59
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,200
Oh, to like, to peruse and do all of that.

60
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,040
To peruse.

61
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,840
Look at the wires and the circuitry.

62
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,840
Because yes, it is an electronics store,

63
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,360
but it's sort of more in the radio shack area,

64
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,040
components is a perfect word.

65
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,560
It's like, yeah, it's like boards, and yeah.

66
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,240
It reminded me of, like, I feel very safe there.

67
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,520
I'm like, oh, this is so fun,

68
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,600
it's like being back in the 90s,

69
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:06,320
and like, we didn't really know what home computers were,

70
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,360
and every, ooh, what's that, what's that?

71
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:11,480
Yeah, and a place where you would go get Wired Magazine,

72
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,280
and where Wired Magazine would be prominently featured.

73
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,000
And the Bible was Wired Magazine,

74
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,120
in the hallowed halls of a Fry's.

75
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,440
A new issue of the good word.

76
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,320
But you were getting at a specific point,

77
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,400
or you're just like, refreshing it,

78
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,240
what you knew about it before you got to Los Angeles.

79
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:30,560
Yeah, and my experience, I went there,

80
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,880
I think about a year, year and a half ago,

81
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,560
because I was told, like, oh,

82
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,520
because I said something like,

83
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,240
I have a printer, it's kind of old,

84
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:42,000
but I need to print some stuff,

85
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,280
but I wanna buy a new cartridge.

86
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,680
And they were like, oh, if you have the old one,

87
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,240
take the Fry's, they'll refill it.

88
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,080
Okay.

89
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:53,080
Which they did, and that lasted, that kinda worked.

90
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,080
Right, right.

91
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,760
It kind of works.

92
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,600
The printer is on its last legs, granite,

93
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,960
but I feel like it went through that refilling

94
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,040
pretty quickly.

95
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,680
Well, let me be clear, as a store,

96
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,560
Fry's is a horrible store.

97
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,840
Yeah.

98
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,520
Maybe I shouldn't say that if I wanna get in good with them

99
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,440
to do the documentary.

100
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,120
I have a scratch horrible,

101
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,400
it leaves some things to be desired.

102
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,280
My experience is that everything that I've ever bought

103
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,760
from there has not worked.

104
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,200
And that is usually like $8 items,

105
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,520
it'll be like, you know how there's like the red

106
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,480
and yellow sound cables, and you know,

107
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,320
what if I needed a wire that put that into a single stereo?

108
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,280
Oh, they have a part at Fry's, okay, sounds good.

109
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,240
Try it at home, nothing happens.

110
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,320
I need to go somewhere else and get a real one.

111
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,560
I've never, hard drives I've gotten just fizzled immediately,

112
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,800
never worked once.

113
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,520
Almost every product I've ever gotten from there

114
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,720
didn't even, didn't break, it just never worked.

115
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,520
I'm trying to think, cause I think I bought fans,

116
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,720
like USB fans, there's a indie wrestling show out here

117
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,840
called PWG, and in the summer months,

118
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,360
there's a thing called the Battle of Los Angeles,

119
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,440
and it's three days, and it used to be that you would wait

120
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,480
in this receipt of parking lot in the oppressive heat.

121
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,360
So I was so prepared this year,

122
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,360
I went and got a bunch of USB fans,

123
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,960
and I went to Fry's to get them,

124
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,920
and they didn't know what I was talking about.

125
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,400
And then I did finally find a few,

126
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,640
I bought them and they did not work.

127
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,640
They wouldn't work with,

128
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,360
because I was gonna put them on like a battery,

129
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,280
like a iPhone battery, the external battery.

130
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,080
Oh yeah, and then keep that going the whole time

131
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,520
that you're there, three days.

132
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,720
And they didn't work, and I had to buy them off Amazon,

133
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,600
I think.

134
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,520
So your experience is zero, mine's zero, Jason's kind of.

135
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,960
Well, we had a podcast related one,

136
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:37,320
where we were, you and I went there,

137
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,960
because we have these mic stands now.

138
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,120
We've had them for a while.

139
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,920
We were trying to brag, but.

140
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,840
Hate to brag.

141
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,160
We do have stands.

142
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,920
We're like, I forget, we might've eaten lunch,

143
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,040
or, but we're, you were like, oh, let's,

144
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,720
I think I'll run to Fry's, try to find some mic stands.

145
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,520
And they had a mic stand.

146
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,480
They did not have three identical ones.

147
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,520
They did not have three priced reasonably.

148
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,040
I think there was one and it was weird.

149
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,640
They had like one and it was like $100 or something.

150
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,480
Yeah.

151
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,440
It was a single mic stand.

152
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:14,120
It'd be possible to find item, a microphone stand.

153
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,720
This, because I think also, and maybe once in a while,

154
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,640
I start going, you shouldn't order from Amazon.

155
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,200
We should just go to a store and get it.

156
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,040
It's easier.

157
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,800
You're supporting the business.

158
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,800
Amazon shouldn't have any more of our money.

159
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,640
And then we went to Fry's and it was impossible.

160
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,840
And there was like a $15 mic stand on Amazon

161
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,600
that is the one, or the ones we're using.

162
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,040
Yes, and there's things that you would maybe get

163
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:41,760
from Best Buy, but that, if something you think

164
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,520
is covered by Best Buy, go to Best Buy

165
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,340
and Best Buy will be fine.

166
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:46,960
If you, if it would only be at Fry's,

167
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:47,800
you're kind of screwed,

168
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,560
because there's a very good chance you'll buy that thing.

169
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,960
It just won't work at all.

170
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,800
Yeah.

171
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,520
So why would we be talking about an electronics store

172
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,960
where not one item you buy works

173
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,840
and they don't even have microphone stands?

174
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:03,840
Because this is maybe the best themed chain store

175
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:06,680
that exists.

176
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,840
And there, I guess there's other things that are themed.

177
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,240
I, you know, obviously restaurants,

178
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,920
your rainforest cafes and whatever.

179
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:15,680
I can't think of another example of a, not nationwide chain,

180
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,600
but a chain that is all over the country

181
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,000
with many, many locations where everyone

182
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
has a distinct theme.

183
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,100
And it's not even crappy often.

184
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,580
It's not even just like they put up some flowers

185
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:30,800
and that's supposed to feel like Hawaii or something.

186
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,120
Some of these places have aggressive theming,

187
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,520
massive show pieces.

188
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,440
There's, I would argue there is theming in Fry's

189
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,840
that is in some places better than like original

190
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,560
California adventure.

191
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,400
Yeah.

192
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,280
There is a feature of the Burbank one

193
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:53,280
that once I was inside of it, I was like, oh my God.

194
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,720
I was shocked.

195
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,560
Yes.

196
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,880
Like I was shocked.

197
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,800
Some of it is melting.

198
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,640
Some of it is very good.

199
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:06,080
And the Thousand Oaks one is-

200
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,600
Or is it Canoga Park, I believe you're thinking of.

201
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,360
That's the one by where I grew up.

202
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,960
That was my home one.

203
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,240
I don't want to spoil that theme.

204
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,080
No, I think-

205
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:16,920
If you're building to it.

206
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:20,560
Well, maybe it's a good place to get into it a little.

207
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,360
I imagine we'll talk the most about Canoga Park

208
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,520
and Burbank, but this is probably where my obsession

209
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,720
started because one of these opened in the 90s,

210
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,140
very close to where I grew up.

211
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:34,200
And okay, we're gonna go to this store.

212
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,280
Okay, sounds boring.

213
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,720
I guess we got to walk in.

214
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:41,800
And the initial like check-in tunnel

215
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:46,880
is an Alice in Wonderland flipped on its side rabbit hole.

216
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,000
It is an entirely like,

217
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
would you call it a vertical perspective?

218
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,280
It's like you are going down a rabbit hole.

219
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:57,120
So there's chandeliers hanging the wrong way.

220
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,560
There's mirrors on the ceiling.

221
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,080
It looks like you're going down.

222
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:06,080
And it would be a perfectly acceptable set to be in a ride.

223
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,440
It's legitimately very well done.

224
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,200
And beyond that, the entire store is this very well done

225
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:18,200
Alice in Wonderland theme with massive hulking statues

226
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,120
of not even Disney style.

227
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,920
It's very like old Lewis Carroll line drawing,

228
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,120
like creepy as hell.

229
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,560
Massive statues.

230
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,960
There's like dozens of them of many, many characters

231
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:36,480
from Alice in Wonderland, Jabberwockies, like everything.

232
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,960
Playing cards.

233
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,720
People, the cards painting the bushes,

234
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,480
scary Mad Hatter.

235
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,600
The queen of hearts.

236
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,120
Yeah, yeah.

237
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:47,960
So you've been in that one.

238
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:48,800
I have been in there.

239
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,040
Yeah, I ended up in there once and I saw there was fries

240
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,640
and I went low, let me see what the theming was.

241
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,080
This is ages ago.

242
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,680
That's how long you would like suggest it like that.

243
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,600
And I went in and I was like, oh my God.

244
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,440
It's crazy, right?

245
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,280
It's crazy.

246
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:08,080
You don't see stuff like that just in some big box store.

247
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,800
Like truly, it's not maybe a lot of the stuff

248
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,360
in fries isn't theme park level, but it is.

249
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,160
Okay, you know those, the mini golf courses

250
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,360
at Disney World, your Fantasia Gardens.

251
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:23,240
I would argue that at least this Alice in Wonderland

252
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:26,160
one in Canuckle Park, if that's what the theming was,

253
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,720
if it was a bunch of those statues around

254
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,240
in like a mini golf course, you'd be like,

255
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,760
this is incredible.

256
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,560
We gotta take pictures of everything.

257
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,960
This is so well done.

258
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:37,480
I have no information about why these stores are so good.

259
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,440
Who did all of this stuff?

260
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,640
Was it like former Imagineer people?

261
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,760
It's at least also maybe the level of like the haunts,

262
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,680
like the knots haunts that are shockingly well done.

263
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,320
They're a little like rough around the edges

264
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,520
and put together with tape, but pretty great

265
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,600
for something that's only up temporarily.

266
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,480
I don't know.

267
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,720
I don't know who did the, why are these stores this way?

268
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,600
Yeah, it's a good, we probably,

269
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,480
I don't wanna say Fries II coming eventually,

270
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:10,160
but we probably could do some more investigative journalism

271
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,520
and figure it out.

272
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,840
Yeah, maybe we should have.

273
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,680
Because it's not readily available.

274
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,240
I'm just, there's plenty for this Fries part one.

275
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,680
Sure, well, and I'll tease right now,

276
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,720
there will be a reason to do a Fries II

277
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,560
and we'll get to that at the end.

278
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,920
Stay tuned at the end.

279
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,480
There's a little bit of a cliffhanger coming.

280
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,840
But yes, you're right.

281
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,080
We should have thought ahead and gone,

282
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,760
was it like recently laid off Imagineers

283
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,200
who had to get it out?

284
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,600
Was it people who wanted to do it DIY,

285
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,080
rough and tumble style, just get their hands dirty again?

286
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,600
Yeah, I mean, it takes, look, it takes a while.

287
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,800
I've been chasing some McGruff leads here for months now

288
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,640
for McGruff II.

289
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,720
Some of these episodes are in the queue for a while.

290
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,160
I try, yeah. It's not for nothing.

291
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,160
You gotta keep digging.

292
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,040
You gotta keep, as my dad says in the newspaper,

293
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,480
you gotta keep pulling the threads.

294
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,760
You gotta keep on the story.

295
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,240
Your dad a journalist, I don't know much we've said.

296
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,080
Yes.

297
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,840
You really get to like maybe use some lessons from him.

298
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,400
Yes. In the show.

299
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,280
Yeah, he'll send some stuff once in a while.

300
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:08,480
If I mentioned I'm looking for a certain thing,

301
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,480
certain address, although I already have an address.

302
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,840
Oh. I have to write a letter is what I'm saying.

303
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,600
I've tried email a lot.

304
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,520
This is intriguing.

305
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,360
I've tried a lot of email.

306
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,360
You're not allowed to say more

307
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,240
about what letter you have to write.

308
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,600
I have to get in contact with the guy who wrote the songs,

309
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,240
the McGruff songs, and I know where he lives, I think.

310
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,480
Oh my God.

311
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,520
And it's not from weird,

312
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,040
and this is what my dad had nothing to do with it.

313
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,880
I just look up in the white pages.

314
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,720
Okay.

315
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,560
Yeah.

316
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,600
And I said, I don't think I can,

317
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,680
I don't think this guy's checking his email.

318
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,000
Don't get addresses on the dark web.

319
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,320
Make sure you do it legally.

320
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,160
It was legally.

321
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,400
Use your compact computer, you bought it at a frond.

322
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,240
So.

323
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:49,600
Whitepages.com, do it the right way.

324
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,280
I'm gonna write a handwritten letter, I think.

325
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,200
Which might be the only way,

326
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,120
that might be the medium that he shows respect.

327
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,800
He's not wasting his time on Twitter.

328
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,680
He wrote some of the greatest songs of all time.

329
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:05,880
Why is he leaving his DMs open?

330
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:06,720
Yeah, he shouldn't.

331
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,600
Yeah.

332
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,000
Well, so we gotta do that next.

333
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,600
Let's discover who did these.

334
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,240
While we're talking about the Woodland Hills one,

335
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,480
let me just try, if I remember anything else.

336
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,920
One of the craziest things,

337
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:23,520
there is a knight fighting an airborne Jabberwocky.

338
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,800
I didn't read it, the Jabberwocky's not in the movie,

339
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,400
not in the Disney one, so I had to look up,

340
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,640
is that what that is, this crazy fanged beast

341
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,760
with big dragon wings, and it's terrifying.

342
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,800
I'll post some photos, but they created

343
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:40,560
this really crazy monster that is perpetually airborne.

344
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,200
And then the rest of it's all great.

345
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,600
It's all hedges, it's like black and white checkered floor.

346
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,840
The caterpillar is crazy.

347
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,800
Right, right.

348
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:54,120
Cheshire cats, there's a frog with a powdered wig.

349
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,140
Can't be mad at that.

350
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,260
No, no.

351
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,500
Well, it's just next to, you know,

352
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:05,420
like a, either like, it's a bunch of washer dryers

353
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:10,420
or like a, you know, like a pack of like Lipton Ice tees

354
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:12,020
that they haven't unwrapped,

355
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:14,020
that they just like left all of the plastic on.

356
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,580
A pallet. Yeah, a pallet,

357
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:16,980
that's the word, yeah, yeah.

358
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:22,140
I would also say that with the level of creepiness,

359
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:23,460
Mike, you know what I'm talking about,

360
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,940
some of the stuff in this one is kind of like the,

361
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:29,020
especially the downstairs of San Rio Puroland.

362
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:29,860
Oh yeah.

363
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:32,540
Where there's some like kind of ghastly horrifying

364
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,660
uncanny valley kind of statues.

365
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:37,740
Yeah, yeah, and their little cottages.

366
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:38,580
Yes, yeah.

367
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:40,420
A giant Alice sobbing.

368
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,140
Jesus.

369
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:47,140
She's got her head in her hands, covering her eyes, crying.

370
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,340
Oh, you know what they have also with Alice?

371
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:53,540
They have the house, the little cottage

372
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:55,300
that her arms are bursting out of,

373
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:56,980
and you can walk through the middle of that,

374
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:00,020
and that is a little tunnel where you can test car stereos.

375
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,780
You know, the car, like what we,

376
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:05,300
you know those little plates that you have installed

377
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,340
that connect to your MP3 player?

378
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,340
That's what they sell.

379
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:13,780
Like the most easily stealable stereos that exist.

380
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:16,740
This is still, and so this is also a dimension

381
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,660
of what's crazy about going to a Fry's

382
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:21,340
is the locked in time aspect.

383
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:25,060
So many of them have like a huge CD

384
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:30,020
and it says audio CDs or like video software,

385
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:35,020
things that are not exactly how we frame things anymore.

386
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:39,580
The Burbank one, you go into a UFO

387
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:43,420
for the like testing room with a theater,

388
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:48,420
like a big theater, to like see how good this projector

389
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,820
audio setup is.

390
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:54,780
And when I was there last week,

391
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,620
well first off you could enter from two sides

392
00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:00,220
and one sides had a lot of tower speakers,

393
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:02,460
which I don't think has been,

394
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:07,460
that hasn't been in fashion as far as I know for,

395
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:10,060
if I'm being generous, five years

396
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:11,460
might have been the end of that.

397
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:16,380
If you're building a great like 2001 hi-fi system,

398
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,500
if you want, if you're like looking to support

399
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:21,420
your non HD big screen TV,

400
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:22,540
yeah.

401
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:24,580
If you want to, if the thing that Needles is on

402
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:26,900
in Back to the Future 2,

403
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:29,180
if you're making one of those setups.

404
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:32,140
But if you went the main entrance of the Flying Saucer,

405
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:36,420
you enter this theater room and they were playing,

406
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,500
I believe it was Cars 3.

407
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,540
Okay, reasonably recent.

408
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:43,380
I was gonna say that is at least a movie in the last decade.

409
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:46,220
The aspect ratio was not recent.

410
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:49,540
It was not, like it was a big screen

411
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:52,300
and it did not take up much of it.

412
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,420
Was it four three?

413
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:56,300
No, it was widescreen, but it stopped.

414
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:59,660
Like there was a lot of wall on either side.

415
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:04,100
It did not strike, it was not like where you have to go in

416
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:08,580
with the remote and click like source, picture view,

417
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:12,380
theater, four by three, 16 by not.

418
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:15,220
Like they had not done that correctly.

419
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:16,460
They have these, okay.

420
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:20,700
So most fries have what they say on the door

421
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:23,020
is a presentation room.

422
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:26,540
And it is like, it is truly a demonstration of

423
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,660
exactly what you're describing,

424
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,780
where you need to do so many settings

425
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:31,820
and where you have like seven remotes.

426
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,980
And the presentation rooms are all like that.

427
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,780
The remotes are all splayed out.

428
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:39,060
It's like a mini movie theater with like probably eight

429
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:41,660
in a row and then three rows maybe.

430
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:44,500
And the remotes are just scattered everywhere.

431
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,260
There's just loose wires.

432
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:48,820
There's wires connecting to speakers

433
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,140
that aren't there anymore.

434
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:52,140
Sometimes there'll be like a faded poster

435
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:57,060
that's like avatar or one that I went to has

436
00:17:57,060 --> 00:18:01,660
like a framed photo that's just like 150 faces

437
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:03,860
all from the Star Wars prequels.

438
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:06,180
It's just like, here's Hayden and here's Natalie

439
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,740
and all of the characters.

440
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:12,340
There was one, the one that I went to in Vegas,

441
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:14,460
I went to a fries in Vegas.

442
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,900
I took time out of a Vegas trip.

443
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:19,940
This one, I looked in the back of the projection room

444
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:22,300
and there was no projector in the spot

445
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,140
where there should have been.

446
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:27,500
And it was just like a little container of potpourri.

447
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:30,020
It was just like a bunch of pine cones and shit.

448
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:31,500
I didn't even see the remotes

449
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,460
because it was pitch black in that room.

450
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:37,380
Besides the image, this is news to me.

451
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,220
There were remotes in there.

452
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:41,780
But what I did see when I was exiting

453
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:46,820
was this display of earmuffs, earmuffs for your baby.

454
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:51,100
So earmuffs.

455
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:51,940
Earmuffs.

456
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:55,300
So, and I was like, oh, is this a health thing?

457
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,380
And I'm like, no, this is just literally

458
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:58,500
if you want to bring your baby,

459
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,500
comfort your child.

460
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,180
Bring your baby to a concert.

461
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:03,260
Yeah, voices can be heard,

462
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:06,020
but everything will be much less loud.

463
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,820
The child seems to enjoy the earmuffs.

464
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:09,780
I don't believe it.

465
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:10,620
Oh, of course.

466
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:14,900
Yeah, so baby would keep on a massive thing on their head.

467
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,820
Studio monitor headphones, yeah.

468
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:20,380
That makes them, that muffles all the sound around them.

469
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:21,940
Fry's, I think is a good place to go

470
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:24,220
if you fail on Shark Tank

471
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:28,140
and you fail on all any other sub CNBC way

472
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:29,180
to get that guy.

473
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:31,020
QVC didn't accept you home shopping.

474
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,740
Fry's will.

475
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:34,300
There's all kinds of bizarre.

476
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,140
They will carry almost any product.

477
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:39,420
Yeah, including just like, you know, kites.

478
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:40,900
I got kites.

479
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:41,740
Bugles.

480
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:43,540
The snack.

481
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:44,380
Any snack.

482
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:45,700
Oh yeah, yeah, sorry.

483
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,780
I should have, because they might carry instruments.

484
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:49,780
They do have musical instruments as well.

485
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:50,620
They have some instruments.

486
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:55,060
But they also just have funions and like circus peanuts.

487
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:58,180
An upsetting amount, like convenience store level

488
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:00,420
amount of snacks.

489
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:01,260
Yeah.

490
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:04,020
In a really long like impulse by IELTS.

491
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:08,540
Fry's is always, they're built to hold 30 people

492
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,860
in the checkout line.

493
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:10,700
Yeah.

494
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:15,260
And typically you will go and see one person, zero people.

495
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:17,940
Perhaps in the entire store.

496
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:20,060
This is really, this didn't used to be the case.

497
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:21,820
A couple of years ago, it wasn't this way as much,

498
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:24,220
but mainly you will like walk around a Fry's

499
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:25,860
and see no one.

500
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:29,500
And probably not see items on the shelves.

501
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,260
If you do a Google News on Fry's,

502
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:34,740
a lot of places are going, what's going on?

503
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:35,980
Are they closed or not?

504
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:37,860
How can a store stay open

505
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,700
that has like 75% empty aisles?

506
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,300
One of the things I liked about,

507
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:44,020
they closed the Fuddruckers in Burbank,

508
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:44,860
which is very sad.

509
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:45,700
Yeah.

510
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:46,540
I know Scott's not a fan,

511
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:48,900
but I was a big fan of the fact that when you'd walk

512
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:52,660
in there, it felt like I was five years old

513
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:54,580
in Schomburg, Illinois.

514
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:56,620
The music was the same.

515
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:58,100
They hadn't changed a thing on the wall.

516
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,500
The only difference is Burbank has a tonight show booth.

517
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,340
Yeah.

518
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:02,180
Which is great.

519
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:03,000
It's a beautiful downtown Burbank.

520
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,260
Beautiful downtown Burbank.

521
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:06,340
But I liked that about it, is like felt you,

522
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,180
like you went back in time.

523
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:09,500
It's the same way with Fry's,

524
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,700
except more like there's an apocalypse happened

525
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:13,580
or something.

526
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:14,420
Oh yes.

527
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:17,260
It's been rooted, everything feels like the quickie mart

528
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:19,980
with the hurricane chow.

529
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:20,820
Yes.

530
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:21,900
Where cat is crossed out and it says,

531
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:22,860
hurricane chow.

532
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,460
You can imagine a scenario where like,

533
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:26,500
you're one of the last people on earth

534
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,860
when you're in a Fry's.

535
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:28,700
Yeah.

536
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:29,540
Yeah.

537
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:31,380
And you can only live off of.

538
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:33,060
Funyuns, Bugles.

539
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,420
Fax machine ink.

540
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:35,460
Fax machine ink.

541
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,860
That's the nutritional value of fax machine ink.

542
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:41,060
There's gotta be some protein in that.

543
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:43,220
Now, hold on one second,

544
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:46,500
because the Burbank one is area 51 themed.

545
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,340
Yes.

546
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:51,020
And we haven't mentioned the Atomic Cafe.

547
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:51,860
Yeah.

548
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:53,300
The restaurant that's inside.

549
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:56,100
So did you also have a stint at the Atomic?

550
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:56,940
Did you eat?

551
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,140
I wasn't sure if you would eat.

552
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:59,180
I didn't eat.

553
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:00,700
I did.

554
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:01,700
Well here, you go first.

555
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,380
I'll explain my experience.

556
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:06,140
Just to say the Burbank theme,

557
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:07,500
you're right, it's area 51 theme,

558
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,460
but it's also really what it is.

559
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:10,300
Yeah.

560
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:13,500
You're inside a B movie.

561
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,340
Right.

562
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:16,260
You're in a bad 50s sci-fi movie

563
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,620
where aliens have landed

564
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:20,100
and they've caused things to be gigantic.

565
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:20,940
Yeah.

566
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,620
So there's flying saucers.

567
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:24,820
There's huge ants.

568
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:25,660
Giants.

569
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:26,620
That is really the crazy thing.

570
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:28,780
There's massive ants everywhere.

571
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,980
A bunch of them, so many of them.

572
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:33,540
There's Jeeps that were demolished

573
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:35,940
and blown up down the center.

574
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:38,540
They had to bring these huge artillery vehicles in

575
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:41,140
and then torch them through the middle.

576
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:43,900
There's mannequins of soldiers crying

577
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,540
like they're about to get disintegrated.

578
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:48,860
There's amazing tableaus in this entire thing.

579
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:51,660
I mean, the very first thing that happened is I walked in

580
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:53,820
and was immediately startled by the statue

581
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:56,220
of a young newsboy.

582
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:57,420
Holding a newspaper.

583
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:58,260
Oh!

584
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:02,220
I thought it was a person and I was like, oh!

585
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,740
You were staring yourself in the mirror.

586
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:04,580
I was looking.

587
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:08,180
And I'll tell you this, as kind of a fries expert,

588
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:11,780
and I'll give you my full stats in a little while,

589
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:13,540
you can tell if the fries is gonna be good

590
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:15,180
based on that entry tunnel.

591
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:17,500
As with my childhood one that kept me interested

592
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,540
my whole life, that Alice going on the rabbit hole,

593
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:20,660
it's amazing already.

594
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:22,660
That paper boy is right away.

595
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:23,500
Right away.

596
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,420
So if you don't see something cool

597
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:26,300
in that first 10 feet,

598
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,060
you could probably skip the rest of the fries.

599
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,500
But with Kanoka Park and Burbank,

600
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,100
they're hitting you right off the bat.

601
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:32,940
Yeah, I think it's,

602
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:35,180
and the customer service is supposed to be

603
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:37,060
like a facade of a gas station,

604
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:39,340
like a 50s gas station.

605
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:41,540
And then the checkout is a diner.

606
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:42,380
Right.

607
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:44,900
So there's like, you know, egg specials and everything.

608
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:47,100
Sadly, you can't have the egg specials.

609
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:51,260
But as you were saying, if you go to the back corner,

610
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:54,060
there is a full cafe.

611
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:56,100
You can have lunch in the fries.

612
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:59,340
With real neon.

613
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:00,580
That was what impressed me.

614
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:01,860
Real neon signs.

615
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:02,740
It buzzes.

616
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:04,100
It buzzes loud.

617
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,300
It buzzes loud.

618
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,780
Like it's the real deal.

619
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:11,140
And there are Cadillacs that you can sit in

620
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:15,860
with what appears to be the original seats

621
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:19,460
because you sink below the table.

622
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:21,940
Like not exactly thought out.

623
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:24,380
Playing on a giant projection screen,

624
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,420
I had to watch it for a few minutes

625
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:28,820
and then search some specifics.

626
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:31,020
Playing the famous B movie,

627
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:33,580
This Island Earth when I was there.

628
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:36,540
The main film in Mystery Science Theater, The Movie.

629
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:37,380
The movie.

630
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:38,860
The theatrical release movie.

631
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:40,060
Whoa.

632
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:42,860
So this, if this sounds familiar at all,

633
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:45,700
the Disney World Sci-Fi Drive-In.

634
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:46,740
Yeah.

635
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:48,820
It's, they have a miniature one of those

636
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,340
in this awful electronics store.

637
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:53,620
And it's pretty good.

638
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:54,460
Yes.

639
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:55,300
It's good.

640
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,420
There's three cars.

641
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:58,100
It's very, it's all very well done.

642
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:00,380
How, who's going to eat here?

643
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:02,940
Okay. Well, so here's what happened to me.

644
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:04,820
So I looked it up.

645
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:08,300
It's not, it's one of those unclaimed places on Yelp,

646
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,820
which either means the restaurant's gonna be really good

647
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:12,420
or something's up.

648
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:13,500
It was the latter.

649
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:18,500
So one of the few pictures was a sign saying

650
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:22,300
Cafe Hours, 9 a.m. to 7 p.m.

651
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:24,540
I found this in the middle of the day.

652
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:28,820
And I was like, okay, it's a few minutes before three.

653
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:32,420
I will swing by and get a late lunch or a snack

654
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:34,340
or whatever they have.

655
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:37,220
I walked in at 310 to be greeted by a sign

656
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:41,420
that said Cafe Hours, 11 to 3.

657
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:45,060
And when I went, hey, are you still open?

658
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:47,060
The woman was surprised to see me.

659
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:49,500
I went, oh no, we're closed.

660
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:54,500
So the next day I went back at two and I was served.

661
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:57,220
I did eat.

662
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:59,860
How many people were there eating?

663
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:04,500
The first day there was one man who had finished,

664
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:07,140
like looked like a sandwich and a cup of coffee.

665
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:07,980
Okay.

666
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:10,560
The second day there was me.

667
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,700
You were the one man.

668
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:14,220
I was the one man.

669
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:17,380
They have one man a day that eats at this cafe.

670
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:18,380
In four hours.

671
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:20,020
In four hours.

672
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:21,900
Scott, did you order anything?

673
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:22,820
What did you have?

674
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:25,020
I ordered a smoothie.

675
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:25,860
Okay.

676
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:27,860
I did not have hard food.

677
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:29,020
What did you have?

678
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,540
Did you have hard food?

679
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:36,260
I had a, I had an iced coffee and a slice of lemon cake.

680
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:37,460
Wonderful.

681
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:41,220
And I gotta say, pretty good.

682
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:42,060
I was surprised.

683
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:45,900
I also have to say that I enjoyed the smoothie very much.

684
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:48,140
Shockingly large smoothie menu.

685
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:50,460
I was gonna say, what is it basically the gist of the menu?

686
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:52,020
A smoothie, some desserts.

687
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:52,860
Can you get a sandwich?

688
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:57,420
Smoothies, like club sandwiches, like one breakfast.

689
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:59,740
Like it said breakfast burrito, breakfast quesadilla.

690
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:02,040
I wasn't sure.

691
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:04,140
When I asked for half and half with the coffee,

692
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:06,060
they gave me coffee mate.

693
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:08,860
They gave me the red cab coffee mate, sweet and cream.

694
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:10,940
I was like, oh, do you have milk instead?

695
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:11,780
I don't.

696
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:12,620
The answer is no.

697
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:13,460
They did.

698
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:14,300
They did.

699
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,660
They do have a coffee menu.

700
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:18,500
The iced coffee wasn't the worst I've ever had.

701
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:19,340
It was fine.

702
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:20,420
It was kind of, you know.

703
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:21,380
But who is this?

704
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:23,580
Why do they have a diner in here?

705
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:26,700
No, who are people doing such exhaustive?

706
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,580
I didn't know this existed until a few months.

707
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,180
I didn't know that I've been in that fries

708
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:31,300
a couple of handful of times.

709
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:32,380
I didn't know this even existed.

710
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:33,820
So you probably thought it was like theming,

711
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:36,380
like a fake little diner, but it's a real diner.

712
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:39,060
Cause it's off to, it's way in the corner.

713
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:39,900
It's off to the side.

714
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:42,220
So I must've seen it from afar and went, oh, that's fun.

715
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:45,860
It's behind like huge shelves.

716
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:47,620
Like it's by where they store shit,

717
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:49,540
which none of the fries really cover

718
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:51,500
where the storage very well.

719
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,340
Yes.

720
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:53,860
And they just, as I've said,

721
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:57,260
they just leave loose pallets out everywhere.

722
00:27:57,260 --> 00:28:00,300
It's like a Sam's club, like a shitty looking Sam's club.

723
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:01,660
Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

724
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:04,660
When I looked to my right, I could see the other Cadillacs.

725
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:06,180
And when I looked to my left,

726
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:11,180
I could see an entire aisle of Aquafina 24 pack bottles.

727
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:17,140
Like the longest row I have ever seen of one item.

728
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:22,020
I was next to like a display case for Red Bull

729
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:23,140
that was empty.

730
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:26,580
Also an empty display case for something,

731
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:30,700
some drink that has Guarana,

732
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:33,180
like it's you know, a weird new,

733
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:35,660
like the natural energy thing.

734
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:39,820
So much emptiness as said.

735
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:44,820
Now there's also some things to say about the smoothies

736
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:47,620
because again, as I've said,

737
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:51,260
well, here, let me just get this out of the way now.

738
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:54,060
As I said, months, probably like over a year ago,

739
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:56,020
we said maybe fries could be an episode.

740
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:58,460
And I was already pretty fries versed,

741
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:00,660
but in the time since then,

742
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:03,260
I have made a point of going to as many fries as possible.

743
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:04,860
And now at this point,

744
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:07,940
I've been to eight of the nine fries

745
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:09,540
in the Southern California area,

746
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:11,940
including in San Diego County.

747
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:13,820
And I've been to one in Las Vegas.

748
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:18,260
So I've got a lot of fries to compare contrast.

749
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:20,780
Now, you know, you're in a really good one.

750
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:23,020
You've really hit the mother load if there is a cafe

751
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:25,540
and all of the cafes are different.

752
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:28,060
There's like a NASA themed one

753
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:30,020
where it's called Cafe Canaveral

754
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,700
or this one's the Atomic Cafe.

755
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:35,140
Yeah, but no matter what the theme is,

756
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:38,820
the smoothies are always themed after rock and roll.

757
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:42,220
I'll read some of the items,

758
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:46,420
Shunk Berry, Yogurt a Friend,

759
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:48,980
I guess after the Carole King,

760
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:53,180
Peach Boys, the same pun as in Food Rocks, Epcot.

761
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:57,780
One is called, and again, I've seen this in another state.

762
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:59,980
I saw this in Nevada and at the Atomic Cafe,

763
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:03,100
Hawaiian Webbing Song.

764
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:06,660
And the ingredients don't give you a clue why it's webbing.

765
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:09,060
I'm like, is there some like, is there pollen,

766
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:11,020
well, the bees don't make webs.

767
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:13,420
I honestly don't know why webbing,

768
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:15,140
but it's not a typo, I don't think,

769
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:18,540
or it's a typo that's standardized at every fries.

770
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:22,100
The drink that I had was called Peachy Paul and Mango.

771
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:25,220
Does that mean Peter, Paul and Mary?

772
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:27,140
But then when you see Paul and Mango,

773
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:30,420
you think of Paul and Ringo, but Peachy isn't,

774
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:33,700
but Peachy also doesn't sound like Peter.

775
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:36,260
No, but it's got a P.

776
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:38,660
Yeah, I guess it's Peter, Paul and Mary.

777
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:40,260
It's Peachy something and Mango?

778
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:41,980
Peachy Paul and Mango.

779
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:42,980
Peachy Paul?

780
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:44,340
Paul, they didn't change that word.

781
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:45,260
I was gonna say, wait, wait.

782
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,100
Paul.

783
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:48,180
Peachy Paul and Mango.

784
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:51,700
Chunk Berry still, none of it really works.

785
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:54,740
Peach Boys, and then I'm drinking one item.

786
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:59,660
It's gotta be multiple, you can call it a Peach Boy.

787
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:01,340
You can't call it the Peach Boys

788
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:03,540
because there's one singular item, the drink.

789
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:05,220
Yeah, it's as if they made one.

790
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:07,980
Yeah, because if you make multiple versions.

791
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:10,380
I should also mention on the way out,

792
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:12,940
it seems fitting that you mentioned

793
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:15,020
the aliens made everything bigger

794
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:20,020
because I picked up something to share with my lady friend.

795
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:25,300
I got this big muffin.

796
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,060
This muffin was so big.

797
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:28,820
It was a really big one, $1.99.

798
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:31,420
Didn't you bring part of this muffin to a record one time?

799
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:32,540
Were you still eating the muffin?

800
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:33,500
That was a different muffin.

801
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,340
A different muffin.

802
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:35,980
It was also a very large muffin though.

803
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:36,820
We commented on it.

804
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:39,260
That was like the standard Trader Joe's muffin.

805
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:41,460
This was a big muffin, only $1.99.

806
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:46,460
So a fair value, had an electronic store style price tag

807
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:48,060
in front of it.

808
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:50,780
Did they have to take it off like it was liquor?

809
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:52,340
No, just on the display.

810
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:53,180
Buying a video.

811
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,020
Just on the display.

812
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:54,980
It was like buying a video game.

813
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:56,300
You had to take a slip.

814
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:58,180
They get it out of the jewel case.

815
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:01,100
This cinnamon streusel muffin was pretty good too.

816
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:02,440
The lemon cake also good.

817
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:06,580
There's some bougie cafes that I've gone to in Los Angeles.

818
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:08,940
Gotten a baked good and been like, this is stale.

819
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:10,660
This has been sitting in the freezer cake.

820
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:13,900
This stuff was better than some of that.

821
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:14,740
Weird.

822
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:17,100
Will you stop off at Fry's now to get a baked good?

823
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,340
Maybe, probably.

824
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:19,180
I wanna go back.

825
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:20,340
I might go for a under smithy.

826
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:22,380
And get a sandwich.

827
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:25,300
It might be the cheapest club sandwiches at Burbank.

828
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:29,380
Should they convert mostly to selling muffins and smoothies?

829
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:31,260
Just every row. Nationwide.

830
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:35,020
For these many square feet is just all muffins now.

831
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,340
Fry's muffins.

832
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:40,100
Fry's is now pivoting to muffins.

833
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,980
And the screening room is.

834
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:43,020
Muffin based.

835
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:44,780
I'm not sure how yet.

836
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:47,540
While they're playing a video of a rotating muffin.

837
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:48,380
Oh boy.

838
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:49,540
Okay.

839
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:50,620
The greatest film.

840
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:53,940
When you add this up,

841
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:55,780
this one has the presentation room.

842
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:57,620
So you can go sit and watch like a scene.

843
00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:00,060
I've been to Fry's where they were playing

844
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:01,700
just like all of Bumblebee.

845
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:03,980
You're just watching the full movie Bumblebee.

846
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:06,220
Sometimes they just do snippets of scenes.

847
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:10,820
One time I just sat and watched the full T-Rex attack

848
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:11,980
from Jurassic Park.

849
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:14,940
And that one was a very well done theater.

850
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:15,980
Like the sound was great.

851
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:17,500
The picture quality was great.

852
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:18,660
The settings were right.

853
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:21,260
And there was another family in there doing the same thing.

854
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:23,980
We're just watching Jurassic Park on the big screen.

855
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:25,260
On a random Saturday.

856
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:26,100
It was lovely.

857
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:27,340
Great scene.

858
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:29,460
So this one has the presentation room.

859
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:32,540
But also you can sit in the drive in

860
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:34,780
and watch a classical sci-fi.

861
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:36,300
The people behind the counter,

862
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:39,900
when I walked up it said like, do not detect video.

863
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,100
I asked, do you ever put that on?

864
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,020
And they were like, oh, is it not on?

865
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:42,860
Sure.

866
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:43,940
And they put on the movie for me.

867
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:44,780
Hey, great.

868
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:47,300
And I sat and watched Earth versus the Flying Saucers.

869
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,500
They're switching it up.

870
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,900
It's not always the same thing.

871
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:50,740
No.

872
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:51,620
And they told me sometimes they play like

873
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:53,020
just a bunch of trailers.

874
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:54,180
Yeah. Yeah.

875
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:55,460
The woman working there was great.

876
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:56,700
I mean, she was very nice.

877
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:59,860
And yeah, I really enjoyed it.

878
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:01,300
I would definitely go back to Shane.

879
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:03,500
The hours are so short on it.

880
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,340
I mean.

881
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:07,740
I guess if you're like running,

882
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:11,620
if you are a home theater installer

883
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:13,540
and you're picking up some components

884
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:15,980
and you need a bite to eat, this is fine.

885
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:18,220
There's office parks around.

886
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:19,660
Are you a home theater installer

887
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:20,500
who needs a bite to eat?

888
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,300
I wish, when I worked around the corner,

889
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:24,660
I wish I realized there was a restaurant there.

890
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:26,180
Cause like every now and then I was like,

891
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:28,020
I just kind of want a plain sandwich.

892
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:28,860
Well, you know what?

893
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:30,340
It's a very industrial area where you're,

894
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:31,820
there's not a lot of choices.

895
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:32,660
That's right.

896
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:35,900
Especially that, yeah, if we can get the word out,

897
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:37,460
maybe we can help save this thing.

898
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:39,820
If you work in the North Burbank area,

899
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:42,500
go frequent the fries.

900
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,340
Because I am worried about all of these.

901
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:45,940
They are starting to go.

902
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:48,180
I'll say we're recording this in early February.

903
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:49,980
I'm not sure when we're putting it out,

904
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:53,140
but even if we put it out in two days,

905
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:54,820
like half of these could be gone.

906
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:57,620
But it kind of looked like this like two years ago.

907
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:58,860
It's been a long time.

908
00:34:58,860 --> 00:34:59,700
That is also the thing too.

909
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:01,260
Do they just own the land?

910
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:02,940
And there was my question.

911
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:03,780
Do you have an answer for that?

912
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:05,380
Maybe they can just stay open.

913
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:08,380
I saw that the Anaheim one has been bought

914
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:09,580
by another company.

915
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:11,180
Like they bought the land,

916
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:13,420
but they aren't kicking the fries out yet.

917
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:16,060
They're just like getting the jump on owning the land.

918
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:18,940
So that maybe is a little example.

919
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:20,820
Maybe we'll start seeing the land go.

920
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:22,100
And then when places can figure out

921
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:23,060
what they're going to build there,

922
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:24,140
then that's the end of fries.

923
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:25,660
How are they making any money?

924
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:28,780
Oh, there's another corner of the Burbank one

925
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:29,860
that I forgot about.

926
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:33,740
They have a very robust office supply section.

927
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,900
And like I used to, you know,

928
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:41,660
talking about trying to not use Amazon so much.

929
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:46,660
I used to like go to a few like mom and pop stationary stores

930
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:49,060
for like pens or notepads.

931
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:51,060
And then you could also buy stuff individually

932
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:54,140
if you didn't want like a pack of 10, you know,

933
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:55,740
legal pads or whatever.

934
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:58,420
And a lot of those have closed down,

935
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:01,260
but like fries still has a lot of the like,

936
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:02,860
do you just need one of something?

937
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,260
Here's a variety.

938
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:06,260
You know, a lot of, there's less staples now.

939
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:07,940
There's less office depots now.

940
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:09,260
Circuit cities are gone.

941
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:12,140
I don't know how fries is sticking around,

942
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:13,860
but I'm glad for things like that.

943
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:14,700
Yeah.

944
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,340
Now I was thinking like,

945
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,980
oh, I've been thinking about like swapping out the memory

946
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:20,220
on my laptop.

947
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:23,180
And I try to like, well, if I wonder a little,

948
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:25,460
I'll find that section in fries.

949
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:30,460
And I got tired of looking before I found it.

950
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,820
And I was also like, I don't know.

951
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:37,660
Cause this aisle says component, this aisle says memory,

952
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:40,020
but there's nothing in it.

953
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:42,460
There's nothing in any of them.

954
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:47,020
I saw an aisle in one that was all Nintendo branded.

955
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:50,260
It's big, bright, you know, cardboard pieces

956
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:54,900
that have peach and Donkey Kong and all the smiling faces.

957
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:57,100
And there are no games.

958
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:58,620
It is only the display.

959
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:00,900
Nintendo, here's your place for Nintendo.

960
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:03,260
And not one game could be found.

961
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:06,460
A lot of Sobe style beverages,

962
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:08,740
a lot of like elaborate glass.

963
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:09,580
Oh yeah.

964
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:10,420
But it's like.

965
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:13,100
That have been there for seemingly over a decade.

966
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,060
I, yeah.

967
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:15,460
Or as you said Scott,

968
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:18,300
Gourwanna stuff when that was going to never.

969
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:20,860
Like I don't, it's a mystery.

970
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:21,700
I love it.

971
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:22,860
I kind of, I love it.

972
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:24,220
There is like, so,

973
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:26,780
the mysteries of LA of which there are many,

974
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:28,860
like get less and less every year.

975
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:31,100
There's very few places that are just,

976
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:33,020
you can walk into and just wander

977
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:35,700
and have a bizarre fun time.

978
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:36,980
When I was thinking about doing this episode,

979
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:39,700
I thought how, how much I,

980
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:40,740
every time I go to a Frisbee,

981
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:43,380
I'm reminded of a part of a movie that I like very much,

982
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:46,580
which is the, the Brady Bunch movie.

983
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:48,460
The Brady Bunch movie with live action.

984
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:50,700
It's a show is live action as well.

985
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,420
The, the very first movie where the,

986
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:57,220
the family's kind of down and Gary Cole is Mike Brady says,

987
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:58,540
put on your Sunday best gang.

988
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:02,100
We're going to Sears and then set to it's a sunshine day.

989
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:05,100
They have a big romp in Sears and just have a blast

990
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:07,140
and look at everything and dance around.

991
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:09,500
This is how it is every time Aaron and I,

992
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:11,540
my wife, Aaron and I go to a Frisbee.

993
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:13,740
We look, we look at the theming and the theming is fun,

994
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:14,820
but that's only part of it.

995
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:18,140
The rest is like, what bizarre items do we have?

996
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:20,220
There was one time where we found like a refrigerator

997
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:22,700
that you could draw on.

998
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:25,300
Like you, I don't know, like you can write your note,

999
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:26,780
but we were just like, I don't know,

1000
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:29,020
let's draw a little like cat pictures on this thing.

1001
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:31,140
And then you'll open the fridge and there'll be something

1002
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:33,500
in there that doesn't belong.

1003
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:40,220
One time at my favorite fry, I'll go, I'll, I'll say now,

1004
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:41,420
the best fries that I've been to,

1005
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:42,820
maybe I won't even say which one it is,

1006
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,860
but the most fun we had at fries was when we were perusing

1007
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:50,100
refrigerators and then opened a fridge that had a Jake

1008
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:53,180
Paul month calendar inside.

1009
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:54,620
Why is it in the fridge?

1010
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:55,820
What's happening?

1011
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:57,660
And I think that same one,

1012
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:00,700
there were a bunch of wine glasses that were branded

1013
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:04,620
for Tempur-Pedic, like the mattress company.

1014
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:07,380
Tempur-Pedic wine glasses.

1015
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:11,340
Also, so many of the nine stores that I've been to

1016
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:15,260
have had just empty shelf, empty shelf, empty shelf,

1017
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:19,700
then huge full shelf teaming with Will Smith Genies.

1018
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,940
Tons of Will Smith Genies.

1019
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:24,140
The one I gave out at the live shows.

1020
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:24,980
That one.

1021
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:25,820
Yeah, yeah.

1022
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:27,820
I didn't even put together, yeah, you didn't even realize

1023
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:29,220
there was the fries connection there.

1024
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:30,060
Yeah.

1025
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:32,340
They have so many of these.

1026
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:35,780
The last one we went into, we like hit all the butt,

1027
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:37,340
their chest buttons at once.

1028
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:39,500
They're all just like, you ain't never got it.

1029
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:42,820
You ain't never had it, you ain't never, you ain't,

1030
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:44,380
you could do shit like that.

1031
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:45,220
Yeah.

1032
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:46,620
You're playing with the toys.

1033
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:49,500
They also, oh, bizarre magazines I wrote down

1034
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:52,620
at the same, one of the fries I went to,

1035
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:54,460
among the magazines they had,

1036
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:59,220
Ukulele Magazine and then American Waterfowler.

1037
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:05,180
This is where print media has come to have its last gas.

1038
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:06,140
Waterfowler.

1039
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:08,060
Like duck hunting, I guess.

1040
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:09,540
Yeah, I was gonna say, is that what that is?

1041
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:12,940
Like we're reviewing the new whistles for this year.

1042
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:15,380
The new decoys.

1043
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:18,140
I heard there's a new duck blind I wanted to check out.

1044
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:23,140
So the book aisle was not what I was,

1045
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:30,420
the book aisle was a mix of like sheet music books,

1046
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:31,500
technical guides.

1047
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,300
There's a lot of sheet music.

1048
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:37,100
There may be like one or two non-fiction or fiction,

1049
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:38,500
but like I don't.

1050
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,780
We were in, when we were there for the music stand,

1051
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:43,940
we were in the music area and there's like sheet music,

1052
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:47,140
like two different types of Casio keyboards.

1053
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:48,700
And then like.

1054
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:52,340
John Kerry's reporting for duty or whatever.

1055
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:56,540
Like some, there was definitely some like odd non-fiction

1056
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:58,380
book that was like out of place.

1057
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:01,380
Oh, I see, like, yeah, yeah.

1058
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:02,580
I was gonna say profiles and courage.

1059
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:03,420
Is that Obama's book?

1060
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:04,860
General Wesley Clark's.

1061
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:09,020
Profiles and Courage, I believe is John Kennedy's book.

1062
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:10,980
What's the Obama one I'm thinking of?

1063
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:12,620
Yeah, right, he writes too.

1064
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:14,420
I can't remember.

1065
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:17,100
This is where, yeah, if you're wondering where like,

1066
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:20,780
there's like the Dennis Rodman's Bad As I Wanna Be book.

1067
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:25,460
An original sitting there still from.

1068
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:28,660
If you're a president's brother who wrote a children's book,

1069
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:30,740
wondering where it was distributed.

1070
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:33,100
Billy Carter's book, children's book.

1071
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:36,260
There's also a lot of them that have,

1072
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:38,780
you know, they have big signs that say compact discs.

1073
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:41,500
You will no longer find any of those.

1074
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:46,260
I will say, I recall as a kid that Fry's was a good place

1075
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:48,060
to find CDs.

1076
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:51,660
Really specifically, I remember Fry's carrying

1077
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:55,780
the most obscure Beck album, Stereopathic Soulmanure.

1078
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:56,620
Wow.

1079
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:59,020
An album that is not even on Spotify today

1080
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:00,740
that I think is a little hard to find.

1081
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:04,380
I was a huge Beck fan and like, here, really?

1082
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:07,340
Like it's like this album of oddities and like,

1083
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:10,940
so they had like carry deep cut music at one point in time.

1084
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:14,540
Now, it's mostly empty vinyl shelves.

1085
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:16,420
Again, I'm glad I checked several.

1086
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:21,420
Several Fry's had a bunch of very expensive vinyls

1087
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:26,620
of mystical, wait, what's the song?

1088
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:27,700
What's the ass song?

1089
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:29,140
Shake your ass, watch yourself.

1090
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:30,900
Watch yourself, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1091
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:36,620
Like $20 vinyl of an album that is so old

1092
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:39,340
that it has a guest appearance from Snoop Doggy Dog

1093
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:41,100
as opposed to Snoop Dogg.

1094
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,700
Well, they are their new,

1095
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:45,500
because you know, they reprint these vinyls.

1096
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:46,980
Yeah, I assume it was a reprint.

1097
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:47,820
A reprint.

1098
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:51,900
Why, who needs, I don't understand getting music

1099
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:56,220
on vinyl from like 2000, because that was not the medium.

1100
00:42:56,220 --> 00:43:00,220
I can see getting a nice vinyl of Fleetwood Mac

1101
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:02,460
where it's like, that's the medium it was distributed in,

1102
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:06,500
but why would you want a vinyl of Baby One More Time?

1103
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:09,180
That was never the way it was released.

1104
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:10,980
Yes, it's a good point.

1105
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:12,900
Maybe though you wanna hear Baby One More Time

1106
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:15,540
with the little needle at the top and a little crackle.

1107
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:17,740
Maybe that actually makes it special.

1108
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:18,580
I don't know, I'm just-

1109
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:20,180
It makes you feel like Britney,

1110
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:22,700
you can imagine that Britney Spears was like Billie Holiday.

1111
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:25,060
Yeah, maybe it's sort of that's the idea.

1112
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:26,820
I don't know, I'm just guessing.

1113
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:28,620
Not real music unless there's a crackle.

1114
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:31,540
You got a little crackle and then it breaks.

1115
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:33,180
You ever heard of this old, I forget,

1116
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:34,860
you know, real Americana singer

1117
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:36,420
and the name of Britney Spears?

1118
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:37,540
Now, now, now.

1119
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:42,860
Like that's better, I think.

1120
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:45,700
The old lady dropped it in the water at the end.

1121
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:48,060
That part on vinyl, that just really sparkles.

1122
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:48,900
Oh yeah.

1123
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:51,900
You feel like you're listening to a 60s comedy album.

1124
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:52,740
It's very new art.

1125
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:54,500
It was funny before, but now.

1126
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:59,140
So yeah, look, it's a blast.

1127
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:00,780
They're all a blast.

1128
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:03,020
And I mean, especially the one,

1129
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:05,180
if you're listening to this in the LA area,

1130
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:07,500
you gotta go to the Burbank one,

1131
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:10,060
go sit in the drive-in,

1132
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:13,620
go make sure the Atomic Cafe doesn't go out of business.

1133
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:16,260
I really love the Canoga Park one too.

1134
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:17,660
But if you guys are down,

1135
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:21,340
I'd like to go in reverse order of my favorites.

1136
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:22,180
Yeah, yeah.

1137
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:23,020
Well, counting down.

1138
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:25,180
Like a Casey Kasem style countdown.

1139
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:26,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1140
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:28,140
Although I don't have the number ready to go.

1141
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:30,180
Now, actually, let me also say,

1142
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:33,020
there's plenty that I haven't gotten to.

1143
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:35,100
As I said, Southern California I've covered.

1144
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:36,860
I haven't been to NorCal.

1145
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:38,100
I haven't been to Texas.

1146
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:39,620
There's a few of them there.

1147
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:40,860
Oh my God, there's so many.

1148
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:41,700
There's a ton.

1149
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:42,540
There's so many.

1150
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:44,340
I know some of the other themes.

1151
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:47,380
Phoenix, it's an Aztec temple.

1152
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:48,700
Tempe, Arizona.

1153
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:49,780
It's golf.

1154
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:52,500
Everything looks like golf holes.

1155
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:55,900
Ancient Egypt, the Wild West, the Mayans.

1156
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:56,740
Milton, Georgia.

1157
00:44:56,740 --> 00:44:59,740
The store's themed after the history of Milton, Georgia.

1158
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:02,300
There was a Downers Grove one,

1159
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:03,220
which I never even,

1160
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:05,340
I don't think we ever went to in Illinois,

1161
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:06,980
but that says regional history.

1162
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:07,940
It was just about.

1163
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:10,620
Now, that's where you gotta watch out.

1164
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:13,660
Some of them, I have that in the category

1165
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:15,180
of essentially themeless.

1166
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:17,900
Fisher, Indiana.

1167
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:20,740
Wilsonville, I'm not sure what state that's in.

1168
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:22,500
Renton, Washington.

1169
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:24,300
These are themeless and they are dead to me.

1170
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:25,140
Yeah, if you look it up.

1171
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:26,820
I do not care.

1172
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:27,660
How dare you?

1173
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:30,220
You should have tried like your brothers

1174
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:33,500
in Austin, Texas or San Marcos, California.

1175
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:36,580
Mike, also you were saying

1176
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:39,020
before I get into the specific ones,

1177
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:41,540
you brought up this piece of history

1178
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:45,860
that they essentially merged with another store.

1179
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:50,420
Yeah, so there was a company called Tandy who,

1180
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:52,060
let me see here.

1181
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:54,620
Many internal corporate philosophies at Disney theme parks

1182
00:45:54,620 --> 00:45:56,220
were borrowed by this company.

1183
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:57,060
What?

1184
00:45:57,140 --> 00:46:01,700
Which they basically to boil down all of this information,

1185
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:04,340
they opened up a crazy electronics store

1186
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:06,420
called Incredible Universe.

1187
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:07,940
Jason, did you see any of this?

1188
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:08,820
No.

1189
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:12,220
Incredible Universe is, and I'll show you the photo then.

1190
00:46:14,180 --> 00:46:16,980
Incredible Universe was like a fries,

1191
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:18,500
but maybe even more ambitious.

1192
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:23,500
There were McDonald's inside the Incredible Universe.

1193
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:25,420
And let me show you, Jason, can you see that?

1194
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:26,500
I don't have a big picture.

1195
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:29,140
What time period are we talking here?

1196
00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:29,980
Mid 90s.

1197
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:30,820
Yeah.

1198
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:31,660
Oh, okay.

1199
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:34,540
There were two test stores that were very profitable

1200
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:38,580
and then they opened like 17 and it was just an insane flop.

1201
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:39,420
Okay.

1202
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:41,820
It went down so fast and they sold the couple

1203
00:46:41,820 --> 00:46:44,020
that were working two fries.

1204
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:48,260
Yes, and one of the ones that I experienced

1205
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:52,540
in the San Diego proper location,

1206
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:55,020
I could tell used to be an Incredible Universe.

1207
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:55,860
Right.

1208
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:57,260
I was immersed in this stuff enough.

1209
00:46:57,260 --> 00:47:02,260
And that one had, let me remember, let me find the photo.

1210
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:06,100
Oh yeah, that one you walk in and there's this huge marquee

1211
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:10,940
that says the big show and a lot of real neon on it.

1212
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:13,220
It's pretty jaw-dropping.

1213
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:14,900
Another one that says music theater

1214
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:17,620
and it's a neon sign that looks a lot like old Disney,

1215
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:19,260
the neon armadillo.

1216
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:20,420
Right.

1217
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:23,500
And this one mostly was unthemed and mostly sucked,

1218
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:27,860
but getting the vibe of Incredible Universe was exciting.

1219
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:31,420
Incredible Universe also had daycare facilities for shoppers.

1220
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:32,260
Whoa.

1221
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:35,700
Huge showrooms for displaying and demonstrating products

1222
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:38,740
and the Tandy company, which I was talking about,

1223
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:40,780
eventually they bought Radio Shack.

1224
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:42,020
Oh, okay.

1225
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:45,420
That's why the Tandy kind of rings a bell to me.

1226
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:46,260
Tandy.

1227
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:48,740
And they have other holdings.

1228
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:53,060
I think Incredible Universe also had like karaoke booths.

1229
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:58,740
You could record your own CD inside the store.

1230
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:02,060
Their pictures are, the pictures honestly look very similar

1231
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:03,980
to like a Fuddruckers too.

1232
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:04,820
Yeah.

1233
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:06,740
Neon, as you were saying, like a lot of neon.

1234
00:48:06,740 --> 00:48:08,940
Clashy, too many aesthetics.

1235
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:09,780
Yeah.

1236
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:10,900
There's one I'm thinking of, have you seen it,

1237
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:13,300
there's like an illustration of everything you can do in it

1238
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:14,780
and it looks like Where's Waldo.

1239
00:48:14,780 --> 00:48:15,620
I don't think I have seen that.

1240
00:48:15,620 --> 00:48:17,100
There's so much to do.

1241
00:48:18,340 --> 00:48:19,820
Again, Brady Bunch and Sears,

1242
00:48:19,820 --> 00:48:22,260
you could go spend five hours potentially

1243
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:23,460
at an Incredible Universe.

1244
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:27,260
Yes, I admire the ambition.

1245
00:48:27,260 --> 00:48:28,460
Yeah.

1246
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:29,700
But it is fucked up.

1247
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:31,020
Clearly.

1248
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:33,780
They don't have the staying power of the Fries franchise.

1249
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:34,620
Oh, here it is.

1250
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:36,420
It's like a drawn map, like a theme park map.

1251
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:37,260
Yes, yeah, yeah.

1252
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:39,500
Are there any details on that that you can note?

1253
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:41,420
Yeah, it's a small machine.

1254
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:43,980
I don't think I'm making up that you could do karaoke

1255
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:44,980
in this store.

1256
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:46,300
It's a small picture.

1257
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:48,500
Let me see if I can find a bigger, oh, here it is.

1258
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:51,020
Yeah, this is what it is.

1259
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:52,620
I love the vibe of the picture.

1260
00:48:52,620 --> 00:48:53,460
Right?

1261
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:55,660
It looks like a theme, but that looks like something

1262
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:57,980
advertising, you know, Universal Florida.

1263
00:48:57,980 --> 00:49:01,380
Yeah, okay, it says, how about some popcorn or juji fruits?

1264
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:02,300
In our home theater room,

1265
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:03,620
you'll feel like you're at the movies.

1266
00:49:03,620 --> 00:49:05,180
These rooms are filled with all the best audio

1267
00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:06,420
and video technology,

1268
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:09,580
so you can just sit down and experience the products.

1269
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:14,220
There's an area here that says, game never over, dude.

1270
00:49:14,220 --> 00:49:15,900
And it's like arcade games.

1271
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:16,740
Yes.

1272
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:20,300
You feel like you would have hung out here all day.

1273
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:21,140
Oh yeah.

1274
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:22,220
Yeah.

1275
00:49:22,220 --> 00:49:24,180
Auto, oh, they had a place where they would install

1276
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:26,980
stereo stuff into your car.

1277
00:49:26,980 --> 00:49:29,700
Sure, a lot of Best Buy's have that still.

1278
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:31,340
All right, don't put it down.

1279
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:33,300
Well, no, I'm just kidding.

1280
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:34,300
Just kidding.

1281
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:37,140
We can make, yeah, Scott's right, karaoke booth,

1282
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:39,140
or I guess butcher their favorite songs

1283
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:40,900
while starring in a music video.

1284
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:41,740
What?

1285
00:49:41,740 --> 00:49:44,500
By the way, if some famous producer makes you a star,

1286
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:45,700
we want our cut.

1287
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:49,620
You see, you and your mom could have reprised

1288
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:51,700
your crotch grab and duet.

1289
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:54,860
Yeah, I was, yeah, they didn't open one,

1290
00:49:54,860 --> 00:49:55,940
I don't think, in Illinois.

1291
00:49:55,940 --> 00:49:59,620
Tandy ran Computer City too,

1292
00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:02,620
which was later sold to CompUSA.

1293
00:50:02,620 --> 00:50:05,340
I kinda remember Computer City.

1294
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:06,180
I don't know if I do.

1295
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:07,820
Or maybe it's just generic enough

1296
00:50:07,820 --> 00:50:09,860
that they all used to sound like this.

1297
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:12,500
Everywhere used to be like these places.

1298
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:13,340
Yeah.

1299
00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:16,620
Tandy had like Incredible Universe, Computer City,

1300
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:20,380
The Edge in electronics, McDuff Electron,

1301
00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:23,780
like all of these chains that are just like nothing to us.

1302
00:50:23,780 --> 00:50:26,020
The people dedicated their lives to.

1303
00:50:26,020 --> 00:50:26,860
The Edge.

1304
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:27,700
It's just dust to us.

1305
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:29,340
It lives to The Edge.

1306
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:32,220
There's a stage here in the drawing

1307
00:50:32,220 --> 00:50:34,140
where two cheerleaders are dancing.

1308
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:34,980
What?

1309
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:37,140
And there's a big video screen behind and it says,

1310
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:38,500
where all the cool stuff happens,

1311
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:40,180
this is where the giant screen display is

1312
00:50:40,180 --> 00:50:43,140
and the occasional live performance and prize giveaway.

1313
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:44,780
And sometimes there's a clown running around

1314
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:45,940
making balloon animals.

1315
00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:46,780
No, fuck off.

1316
00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:48,380
Get out of here.

1317
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:49,220
No.

1318
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:50,060
Cool.

1319
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:50,900
Who knows what else?

1320
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:53,940
Well, I'm pretty sure somebody actually does.

1321
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:55,420
Very irreverent.

1322
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:57,820
There's another moment in The Simpsons

1323
00:50:57,820 --> 00:51:00,100
in the episode where they go to the try and save

1324
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:01,420
to get a photo.

1325
00:51:01,420 --> 00:51:04,140
And they're all,

1326
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:05,500
Bart wants to get in and out of there

1327
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:07,660
because it's where he like stole the video game.

1328
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:08,500
Yes.

1329
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:09,820
But all the Simpsons have things they wanna do.

1330
00:51:09,820 --> 00:51:13,500
And Marge says, we're gonna have a great time.

1331
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:15,220
That's what these stores feel like.

1332
00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:18,620
Like the family is gonna hang for,

1333
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:21,220
when does this happen anywhere in the world now?

1334
00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:23,540
The family's just gonna hang at a store.

1335
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:27,980
Maybe like a new Whole Foods where you can like drink.

1336
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:28,820
That's the only thing I can think of.

1337
00:51:28,820 --> 00:51:30,340
Yeah, that might be the more modern equivalent.

1338
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:32,140
I mean, we used to go to,

1339
00:51:32,140 --> 00:51:34,540
there was a retail store called Venture in the Midwest.

1340
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:36,020
I'm sure I've talked about on the show before.

1341
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:36,860
I don't remember Venture.

1342
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:37,680
Did you have Venture?

1343
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:38,520
I don't think it was the West Coast.

1344
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:39,740
We didn't have Venture, no.

1345
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:42,300
Venture though, was where we went before Target was around.

1346
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:44,780
Target didn't come in until I was maybe 10 or 11,

1347
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:47,140
We had Jane's Way and Caldor,

1348
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:49,220
like all these smaller scales.

1349
00:51:49,220 --> 00:51:50,820
What are those, James?

1350
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:51,660
Caldor.

1351
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:55,180
But we used to, we would go,

1352
00:51:55,180 --> 00:51:56,820
my grandmother would come over.

1353
00:51:56,820 --> 00:51:59,620
She had a discount on Wednesday's Adventure.

1354
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:02,900
We would go and like eat a grilled cheese sandwich

1355
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:05,660
at the tiny little cafe in Venture.

1356
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:08,500
And they would sell like, they would have Ices,

1357
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:12,340
cheap stale popcorn, and they would make you a grilled cheese.

1358
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:15,780
So we would like make a little day or night of it,

1359
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:17,180
whatever, I guess.

1360
00:52:17,180 --> 00:52:21,780
And yeah, I remember eating grilled cheese in a Venture.

1361
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:24,860
It's where you would go,

1362
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:28,700
so your parents could run some, get like some stuff.

1363
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:32,280
And if you do enough,

1364
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:34,680
if you get the kids walking around the store a bunch

1365
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:36,500
and you get them some snacks,

1366
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:38,700
then they will be tired when they go home.

1367
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:41,220
They will like, it is a place to wear out children.

1368
00:52:41,380 --> 00:52:42,700
Strategy, yeah.

1369
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:44,260
And every time you'd go to Venture,

1370
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:47,300
there was a chance if I cried hard enough,

1371
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:50,220
I could get a toy, because Venture had toys.

1372
00:52:50,220 --> 00:52:51,780
And I don't think I threw a fit every time,

1373
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:53,460
but I did once in a while.

1374
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:57,340
But I found some of the best Ninja Turtles in Venture.

1375
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:58,820
That one of the greatest moments of my life

1376
00:52:58,820 --> 00:53:01,100
is finding April O'Neill figure.

1377
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:05,020
I must have been five years old, five or six years old.

1378
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:06,500
She was the hardest one to find.

1379
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:08,220
They don't make as many female characters,

1380
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:09,300
at least they didn't.

1381
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:11,220
They probably have changed it a little bit.

1382
00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:12,440
Impossible to find.

1383
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:16,300
I remember I'm walking down the aisle towards the checkout

1384
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:18,060
and I'd already checked the Ninja Turtle aisle

1385
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:21,500
and I looked and I saw a face down Ninja Turtle toy

1386
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:22,860
and I had a feeling.

1387
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:24,700
I could feel it in my stomach.

1388
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:25,540
I could feel it.

1389
00:53:25,540 --> 00:53:27,300
And I turned it over and it was April

1390
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:29,380
and I was so thrilled.

1391
00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:32,460
Like Venture from that point on, I think was extra magical.

1392
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:36,140
So there has always been part of the retail tradition

1393
00:53:36,140 --> 00:53:36,980
in America.

1394
00:53:37,460 --> 00:53:40,740
I didn't realize Fry's was gonna open up this bigger thing

1395
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:43,940
of how much I liked hanging out in stores.

1396
00:53:43,940 --> 00:53:47,780
Not any, some could, I have dreadful memories of like,

1397
00:53:47,780 --> 00:53:50,860
where we gotta go to Mervyn's, go to Mervyn's.

1398
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:53,260
Some of them were so boring and it didn't help

1399
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:55,380
when they named it Mervyn's California.

1400
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:57,180
That didn't do anything to change the vibe.

1401
00:53:57,180 --> 00:53:59,460
You put a cool font on it, doesn't fool me.

1402
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:02,180
Mervyn's California is still boring old Mervyn's.

1403
00:54:02,180 --> 00:54:05,340
But the right store where you could make a day of it,

1404
00:54:05,340 --> 00:54:06,500
I missed this a lot.

1405
00:54:07,180 --> 00:54:08,580
There's almost nowhere but, yeah.

1406
00:54:08,580 --> 00:54:13,220
The war, like the dark wood and the cafe smells of a board.

1407
00:54:13,220 --> 00:54:16,220
Like even the first few years I lived out here,

1408
00:54:16,220 --> 00:54:19,180
if I was, I would go to Borders, like.

1409
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:20,260
Beautiful venture there.

1410
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:22,140
Venture black and white, like zebra,

1411
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:23,820
like diagonal zebra stripes.

1412
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:25,420
Cause the Virgin Mega store.

1413
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:26,260
Oh yeah.

1414
00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:28,020
Virgin Mega store is worth taking time out

1415
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:28,860
of your Disney World trip.

1416
00:54:28,860 --> 00:54:30,380
What a treat, incredible.

1417
00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:32,380
I bought blood sugar sex magic there.

1418
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:35,420
I missed, why don't, why aren't there listening stations now?

1419
00:54:35,420 --> 00:54:39,380
Why aren't there rows of 35 oddly nice headphones?

1420
00:54:39,380 --> 00:54:43,420
Fry's has headphone testing stations.

1421
00:54:43,420 --> 00:54:44,820
Cause I did do that.

1422
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:45,660
Oh.

1423
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:47,260
I bought some nice headphones a couple of years ago

1424
00:54:47,260 --> 00:54:49,500
and I did, I don't think I actually learned anything

1425
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:51,620
from the ones I tried at Fry's.

1426
00:54:51,620 --> 00:54:53,140
But they did have them there.

1427
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:54,620
They had them, they're carrying out the tradition.

1428
00:54:54,620 --> 00:54:56,220
They're carrying some of that.

1429
00:54:56,220 --> 00:54:58,020
Let me say something else that Fry's has,

1430
00:54:58,020 --> 00:54:59,620
and I've never seen this in person,

1431
00:54:59,620 --> 00:55:01,620
and I can't imagine when this ever occurs.

1432
00:55:01,620 --> 00:55:04,500
But in theory, on the right day,

1433
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:06,060
and if there is an event going on,

1434
00:55:06,060 --> 00:55:10,780
you could say hello to your old friend, Charlie Chip.

1435
00:55:10,780 --> 00:55:13,340
We know him, Charlie Chip.

1436
00:55:13,340 --> 00:55:17,140
The mascot who is outside of all the Fry's,

1437
00:55:17,140 --> 00:55:18,500
he's on the signage.

1438
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:23,300
He is a big yellow rectangular creature.

1439
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:26,340
And no, he is not SpongeBob SquarePants.

1440
00:55:26,340 --> 00:55:27,780
He's not a sponge.

1441
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:30,700
He is a computer chip, obviously.

1442
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:34,100
And well, the store is themed,

1443
00:55:34,100 --> 00:55:36,500
also his costumes are themed.

1444
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:41,180
I found the website of the place that made the suit.

1445
00:55:41,180 --> 00:55:43,460
So here he's a cowboy.

1446
00:55:43,460 --> 00:55:47,500
Here he's like the creature from the Black Lagoon.

1447
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:48,460
He's an old prospector.

1448
00:55:48,460 --> 00:55:50,340
The old prospector is my favorite one.

1449
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:51,180
Wow.

1450
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:56,180
He's the Mad Hatter from my hometown one.

1451
00:55:56,180 --> 00:55:59,700
He's a rocker with a big triangle guitar.

1452
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:01,780
He's in a train.

1453
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:04,180
He's in a little conductor's uniform.

1454
00:56:04,180 --> 00:56:05,260
Charlie Choo Choo.

1455
00:56:05,260 --> 00:56:07,220
He's an Aztec guy.

1456
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:08,060
Yeah.

1457
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:12,180
I love Charlie Chip and he's a golfer, an astronaut.

1458
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:13,780
He's had so many jobs.

1459
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:14,940
Charlie Chip rules.

1460
00:56:14,940 --> 00:56:17,900
And Jason, if you weren't already endeared to him,

1461
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:20,420
when I Googled image Charlie Chip,

1462
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:24,900
look, save the date for a hot dog and a Pepsi for 50 cents.

1463
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:28,060
50 cents, that's Costco prices, wow.

1464
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:31,540
From Charlie Chip to you as he doffs his top hat

1465
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:33,460
and his fancy uniform.

1466
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:35,500
I love Charlie Chip.

1467
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:37,420
There appears to be plush too.

1468
00:56:37,420 --> 00:56:38,260
What?

1469
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:39,660
There appears to be a Charlie Chip plush.

1470
00:56:39,660 --> 00:56:40,820
I can't find it on eBay.

1471
00:56:40,820 --> 00:56:43,460
I don't know if they sold them in stores at one point,

1472
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:45,020
but it does exist.

1473
00:56:45,020 --> 00:56:47,780
There's gonna be a lot of viewer homework.

1474
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:48,980
So to our Facebook or Twitter,

1475
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:51,260
if you've ever met Charlie Chip, please,

1476
00:56:51,260 --> 00:56:54,260
if you have a plush, send us a photo.

1477
00:56:54,260 --> 00:56:55,820
Look at Charlie Chip's plush.

1478
00:56:55,820 --> 00:56:58,380
Not to be confused with Charles Chips,

1479
00:56:58,380 --> 00:57:01,380
the chips that come in a tin can.

1480
00:57:02,220 --> 00:57:04,060
No, that's totally different.

1481
00:57:04,060 --> 00:57:06,060
I think my grandmother did have Charles Chips.

1482
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:07,340
Charles Chips was my father.

1483
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:09,700
I'm Charlie Chip.

1484
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:11,100
Please, not Mr. Chips

1485
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:14,100
and not Charles Entertainment Cheese.

1486
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:14,940
No.

1487
00:57:14,940 --> 00:57:15,860
There's plenty, there's a lot,

1488
00:57:15,860 --> 00:57:18,260
who also wears like a hat and a suit.

1489
00:57:19,580 --> 00:57:22,540
So that's all the big picture stuff.

1490
00:57:22,540 --> 00:57:24,980
I think maybe now I could kind of store by store it.

1491
00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:27,460
And I don't have a lot except for the final one,

1492
00:57:27,460 --> 00:57:29,260
my favorite one.

1493
00:57:29,260 --> 00:57:30,620
Also, if you're in the LA area,

1494
00:57:30,620 --> 00:57:34,900
you may have been to the Manhattan Beach location.

1495
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:35,740
That one's nice.

1496
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:38,980
It's like sort of like Island Hawaii themed.

1497
00:57:38,980 --> 00:57:41,340
And this one is nice because it has a little like

1498
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:43,860
outdoor patio in the center of the store

1499
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:48,300
with a little lake with a koi and turtles in it.

1500
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:51,300
There's several fries that have creatures

1501
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:53,460
that live in the fries.

1502
00:57:53,460 --> 00:57:56,340
They get to spend their entire life in the fries.

1503
00:57:56,340 --> 00:57:57,580
Lucky animals.

1504
00:57:57,580 --> 00:57:58,420
Yeah.

1505
00:57:59,420 --> 00:58:01,780
It's a great place to live.

1506
00:58:01,780 --> 00:58:06,060
It's covered in dirty hoses and pond skimmers.

1507
00:58:06,940 --> 00:58:08,940
There's like a really dusty bench

1508
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:11,260
that doesn't seem made for anyone to sit in.

1509
00:58:11,260 --> 00:58:13,740
And if you did, it would shatter immediately.

1510
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:17,460
When you're in this little like island zone,

1511
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:21,420
you can see through the window behind shelves

1512
00:58:21,420 --> 00:58:24,100
and just see all the shit that's fallen back there.

1513
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:28,380
See like old mist CDs that no one's removed.

1514
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:31,100
And then once it fell in 98.

1515
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:35,260
This was the fries where I noticed that some,

1516
00:58:35,260 --> 00:58:38,380
at least this fries sells pepper spray

1517
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:41,900
out of an aisle where they loose,

1518
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:45,540
they dubbed the larger category heat guns.

1519
00:58:45,540 --> 00:58:47,340
Can you buy a Taser at a fries?

1520
00:58:47,340 --> 00:58:48,340
I think maybe.

1521
00:58:48,340 --> 00:58:49,180
Maybe.

1522
00:58:49,180 --> 00:58:50,780
You'd have to call that a heat gun.

1523
00:58:50,780 --> 00:58:53,540
Like so cops, you know where to go.

1524
00:58:54,380 --> 00:58:57,700
I bet Charlie Chip has worn a cop uniform at some point.

1525
00:58:57,700 --> 00:59:00,780
Can you get a 3D printer that could print a plastic gun?

1526
00:59:01,860 --> 00:59:05,100
I don't think so because I think 3D printers are too new.

1527
00:59:05,100 --> 00:59:05,940
Too new.

1528
00:59:05,940 --> 00:59:08,100
So thank God they aren't participating

1529
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:10,020
in this wave of 3D printer violence

1530
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:11,740
that affects the solid.

1531
00:59:11,740 --> 00:59:12,580
That's good.

1532
00:59:13,340 --> 00:59:17,380
I was going up the list, Fountain Valley,

1533
00:59:17,380 --> 00:59:19,900
which is in Orange County off the four or five.

1534
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:21,980
This one's named after ancient Rome.

1535
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:25,780
So there's all kinds of marble statues in it,

1536
00:59:25,780 --> 00:59:28,620
beautiful statue work and those, you know,

1537
00:59:28,620 --> 00:59:30,820
like amazing murals.

1538
00:59:30,820 --> 00:59:32,140
It's all very well done.

1539
00:59:32,140 --> 00:59:34,700
Too much hubris for that one.

1540
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:36,860
Too much metaphor.

1541
00:59:36,860 --> 00:59:40,340
The ancient Rome, like is there a neurofiddle?

1542
00:59:40,340 --> 00:59:42,340
Like, you know, that one is.

1543
00:59:42,340 --> 00:59:43,340
Doomed to fall.

1544
00:59:43,340 --> 00:59:45,300
Doomed to fall.

1545
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:49,260
Now this is the fries where I discovered

1546
00:59:49,260 --> 00:59:51,900
that there is an item that we haven't talked about

1547
00:59:51,940 --> 00:59:56,300
that they sell and that is bizarre fragrances.

1548
00:59:56,300 --> 01:00:01,300
They, there are huge aisles where you could just wander

1549
01:00:01,620 --> 01:00:05,660
forever and look item by item at bizarre made in China

1550
01:00:05,660 --> 01:00:09,860
and seemingly named in China fragrances.

1551
01:00:09,860 --> 01:00:11,860
Allow me to read some of the names

1552
01:00:11,860 --> 01:00:13,700
that I've seen over the years.

1553
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:15,900
Four Lady Classic.

1554
01:00:17,020 --> 01:00:18,260
Hello Pretty.

1555
01:00:19,220 --> 01:00:21,420
Gold number one.

1556
01:00:21,420 --> 01:00:23,780
Okay, so cool.

1557
01:00:23,780 --> 01:00:26,020
Most of that is in lowercase.

1558
01:00:26,020 --> 01:00:27,380
Okay, so cool.

1559
01:00:27,380 --> 01:00:29,340
Super army for man.

1560
01:00:29,340 --> 01:00:31,060
Man cool.

1561
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:33,900
Best orange.

1562
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:35,620
Bravery for man.

1563
01:00:35,620 --> 01:00:36,940
What?

1564
01:00:36,940 --> 01:00:38,300
Popular sport.

1565
01:00:42,660 --> 01:00:43,980
And that one did, I recall,

1566
01:00:43,980 --> 01:00:46,780
have a little football player silhouette on it.

1567
01:00:46,780 --> 01:00:47,620
Popular sport.

1568
01:00:47,620 --> 01:00:49,500
Popular sport.

1569
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:52,220
If you're a football player looking for a fragrance

1570
01:00:52,220 --> 01:00:57,220
to sort of cover up your sweat, try popular sport.

1571
01:00:58,100 --> 01:01:00,180
Black Intense.

1572
01:01:00,180 --> 01:01:01,900
Bravo Extreme.

1573
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:06,220
This one in all caps says, bros.

1574
01:01:06,220 --> 01:01:10,380
And then in smaller font, inspired by Hugo Boss.

1575
01:01:10,380 --> 01:01:14,340
It's not a Hugo Boss product.

1576
01:01:14,340 --> 01:01:15,180
No.

1577
01:01:15,180 --> 01:01:16,140
It's inspired by a company.

1578
01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:17,260
Inspired by.

1579
01:01:17,900 --> 01:01:18,740
How do you spell that?

1580
01:01:18,740 --> 01:01:20,580
Was it B-R-O-S-S?

1581
01:01:20,580 --> 01:01:21,420
B-R-O-S-S.

1582
01:01:21,420 --> 01:01:22,260
Bros?

1583
01:01:22,260 --> 01:01:23,100
Bros.

1584
01:01:23,100 --> 01:01:24,580
That's so unpleasant to hear.

1585
01:01:24,580 --> 01:01:25,420
Bros.

1586
01:01:26,300 --> 01:01:27,340
It's bros.

1587
01:01:27,340 --> 01:01:31,460
That's like, so could you sell RC Cola

1588
01:01:31,460 --> 01:01:33,740
and it says inspired by Pepsi?

1589
01:01:33,740 --> 01:01:34,580
Yeah.

1590
01:01:34,580 --> 01:01:35,660
Like that's allowed.

1591
01:01:35,660 --> 01:01:37,220
I guess you could.

1592
01:01:37,220 --> 01:01:38,540
In the ripoff game.

1593
01:01:38,540 --> 01:01:41,700
It's like when you see a generic product

1594
01:01:41,700 --> 01:01:43,220
in like a Target or something

1595
01:01:43,220 --> 01:01:45,220
and in real fine print it says like.

1596
01:01:45,260 --> 01:01:47,380
Check the ingredients.

1597
01:01:47,380 --> 01:01:48,660
Yeah.

1598
01:01:48,660 --> 01:01:51,460
Active ingredients similar to Advil or whatever.

1599
01:01:51,460 --> 01:01:54,860
Oh, it's like the generic from CVS or whatever.

1600
01:01:54,860 --> 01:01:58,020
They don't say inspired by Tylenol.

1601
01:01:58,020 --> 01:02:00,980
Like when you go to see the generic like Safeway cereal

1602
01:02:00,980 --> 01:02:02,660
and it's like magic gems

1603
01:02:02,660 --> 01:02:05,100
and then it doesn't say inspired by Lucky Charms.

1604
01:02:05,980 --> 01:02:07,220
Shorms.

1605
01:02:07,220 --> 01:02:09,020
Lucky Shorms.

1606
01:02:09,020 --> 01:02:11,860
Yeah, that's better equivalent obviously for this.

1607
01:02:11,860 --> 01:02:12,700
The.

1608
01:02:12,700 --> 01:02:14,580
Blessed Shorms.

1609
01:02:14,820 --> 01:02:15,660
Blessed Shorms.

1610
01:02:15,660 --> 01:02:18,020
Leprechaun's bounty.

1611
01:02:18,020 --> 01:02:23,020
For us, I mean, we could do this for all the cereals.

1612
01:02:23,020 --> 01:02:24,220
Flakes.

1613
01:02:24,220 --> 01:02:25,060
Floakes.

1614
01:02:25,060 --> 01:02:25,900
Floakes.

1615
01:02:27,260 --> 01:02:29,700
They're grr-okay.

1616
01:02:29,700 --> 01:02:30,660
Cheerios are like.

1617
01:02:30,660 --> 01:02:31,500
Cheerios.

1618
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:34,340
Choro.

1619
01:02:34,340 --> 01:02:35,180
Chumios.

1620
01:02:35,180 --> 01:02:36,660
Not really like chums.

1621
01:02:38,220 --> 01:02:39,420
Two friends.

1622
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:40,580
Fruit Loops.

1623
01:02:40,580 --> 01:02:41,420
Fruips.

1624
01:02:41,420 --> 01:02:42,740
Fruips, yeah, that's what you see.

1625
01:02:42,740 --> 01:02:44,100
Fruips is easy.

1626
01:02:44,100 --> 01:02:45,420
Count Chocula.

1627
01:02:46,220 --> 01:02:47,380
Chonk.

1628
01:02:47,380 --> 01:02:48,420
Chonk.

1629
01:02:48,420 --> 01:02:49,380
Chonk is good.

1630
01:02:51,220 --> 01:02:52,340
Yummy Mummy.

1631
01:02:53,900 --> 01:02:55,180
Yum.

1632
01:02:55,180 --> 01:02:56,340
Yummy Mummy's a real one.

1633
01:02:56,340 --> 01:02:57,180
Really?

1634
01:02:57,180 --> 01:02:58,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1635
01:02:58,020 --> 01:02:58,860
Yummy Mummy's.

1636
01:02:58,860 --> 01:02:59,700
I was just laughing at Yummy Mummy.

1637
01:02:59,700 --> 01:03:01,220
You didn't see it's a funny name.

1638
01:03:01,220 --> 01:03:03,340
I think it does just honestly make me laugh.

1639
01:03:03,340 --> 01:03:04,300
Yummy Mummy.

1640
01:03:04,300 --> 01:03:05,740
What flavor is Yummy Mummy?

1641
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:08,220
The same as the other Monster cereals essentially

1642
01:03:08,220 --> 01:03:09,620
except for Count Chocula.

1643
01:03:09,620 --> 01:03:12,180
Not like, and then we got Boo Berry too.

1644
01:03:12,180 --> 01:03:13,580
Boo Berry.

1645
01:03:13,580 --> 01:03:15,340
There's Fruit Brute as well.

1646
01:03:16,940 --> 01:03:19,100
Yummy Mummy and Fruit Brute are the lesser known

1647
01:03:19,100 --> 01:03:19,940
of the Monsters.

1648
01:03:19,940 --> 01:03:21,140
Which is the Frankenstein?

1649
01:03:21,140 --> 01:03:21,980
Frankenberry.

1650
01:03:21,980 --> 01:03:23,020
That's Frankenberry, oh right.

1651
01:03:23,020 --> 01:03:26,220
The three, the Trinity is Frankenberry,

1652
01:03:26,220 --> 01:03:27,900
Count Chocula, Boo Berry,

1653
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:31,420
but then the lesser known are Yummy Mummy and Fruit Brute.

1654
01:03:31,420 --> 01:03:34,340
And of course the crunch back of Notre Dame.

1655
01:03:35,820 --> 01:03:36,740
That's very good.

1656
01:03:38,900 --> 01:03:39,740
Here I'm almost done.

1657
01:03:39,740 --> 01:03:40,580
Yeah, exactly.

1658
01:03:40,580 --> 01:03:43,460
777VIPMen, which for some reason

1659
01:03:44,340 --> 01:03:45,900
says under it, you are exalted.

1660
01:03:45,900 --> 01:03:47,340
What?

1661
01:03:47,340 --> 01:03:48,660
These are so bizarre.

1662
01:03:48,660 --> 01:03:51,100
And then one that is a perfect cologne

1663
01:03:51,100 --> 01:03:52,660
either for if you are this person

1664
01:03:52,660 --> 01:03:55,860
or if you're looking to snag a knight

1665
01:03:55,860 --> 01:03:57,860
with one of our, the biggest heroes

1666
01:03:57,860 --> 01:04:01,260
in Podcasts that Ride World, CEO Knight.

1667
01:04:02,460 --> 01:04:05,140
If you're looking for a cologne you can put on

1668
01:04:05,140 --> 01:04:08,220
to make a very special gentleman say hello.

1669
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:12,460
Try CEO Knight.

1670
01:04:13,460 --> 01:04:14,740
Good day with Mr. Eisner.

1671
01:04:14,740 --> 01:04:17,140
Okay, moving up the list, Vegas.

1672
01:04:17,140 --> 01:04:19,260
I'm happy to say the last time I was in Vegas

1673
01:04:19,260 --> 01:04:23,180
that we called a lift from the Flamingo Margaritaville

1674
01:04:23,180 --> 01:04:24,980
to Fry's Electronics.

1675
01:04:24,980 --> 01:04:26,780
What a day, living my best life.

1676
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:27,620
How many minutes?

1677
01:04:27,620 --> 01:04:30,060
And I had a Landshark Lager loaded up

1678
01:04:30,060 --> 01:04:31,300
to enjoy the fries with.

1679
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:33,100
How many minutes away?

1680
01:04:33,100 --> 01:04:33,920
It's pretty quick.

1681
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:35,020
It's not that far from the strip.

1682
01:04:35,020 --> 01:04:37,500
And it's near the mall that has one of those weird,

1683
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:41,300
which one, GameWorks or one of those odd arcade chains

1684
01:04:41,300 --> 01:04:42,140
that they didn't take off.

1685
01:04:42,140 --> 01:04:43,380
GameWorks or Dave and Busters, something like that.

1686
01:04:44,300 --> 01:04:45,140
I think it's a GameWorks.

1687
01:04:45,140 --> 01:04:47,060
Yeah, that's all I grew up with.

1688
01:04:47,060 --> 01:04:50,980
You pass by, if you're driving to Vegas from California,

1689
01:04:50,980 --> 01:04:53,380
you do see it right before you get to the strip.

1690
01:04:53,380 --> 01:04:55,820
Oh, yeah, I'm sure I've seen it.

1691
01:04:55,820 --> 01:04:57,660
I always wanted to do it every time.

1692
01:04:57,660 --> 01:04:59,900
Again, this podcast opened up now.

1693
01:04:59,900 --> 01:05:01,620
I can go, it's justified.

1694
01:05:01,620 --> 01:05:03,620
We went and had a great time.

1695
01:05:03,620 --> 01:05:05,980
It was bizarre to have to explain to Aaron's parents

1696
01:05:05,980 --> 01:05:07,980
who we were with, like, wait, what are you doing?

1697
01:05:07,980 --> 01:05:09,100
They went in the car.

1698
01:05:09,100 --> 01:05:10,900
They didn't, no, they didn't go with us.

1699
01:05:10,900 --> 01:05:11,740
But they just asked like,

1700
01:05:11,780 --> 01:05:14,060
so what are you guys up to today?

1701
01:05:14,060 --> 01:05:18,420
Well, you see, these electronic stores are so bad

1702
01:05:18,420 --> 01:05:20,860
that they are funny, you see.

1703
01:05:20,860 --> 01:05:23,300
Oh, you know what's something I forgot to say is that

1704
01:05:23,300 --> 01:05:24,940
I've always found it a little confusing,

1705
01:05:24,940 --> 01:05:27,980
the way the logo is where it says fries huge

1706
01:05:27,980 --> 01:05:30,060
and electronics really small.

1707
01:05:30,060 --> 01:05:31,420
And I think it's like above the-

1708
01:05:31,420 --> 01:05:32,340
It is above.

1709
01:05:32,340 --> 01:05:35,220
So I, for maybe over a decade,

1710
01:05:35,220 --> 01:05:38,420
called this place Electronic Fries.

1711
01:05:38,420 --> 01:05:40,100
I had it reversed.

1712
01:05:40,140 --> 01:05:43,460
And I, I mean, that works just as well,

1713
01:05:43,460 --> 01:05:45,940
but I think I said out loud a lot of times

1714
01:05:45,940 --> 01:05:47,500
without being corrected.

1715
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:49,500
Yeah, can we go to Electronic Fries?

1716
01:05:51,020 --> 01:05:53,380
So the Vegas one, the inside,

1717
01:05:53,380 --> 01:05:55,660
there's not a lot to talk about

1718
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:59,020
except for the potpourri in the projection booth.

1719
01:05:59,020 --> 01:06:00,300
But the outside's really nice.

1720
01:06:00,300 --> 01:06:02,380
It's a big slot machine.

1721
01:06:02,380 --> 01:06:04,620
The barricades that stop a truck

1722
01:06:04,620 --> 01:06:09,140
from driving into the store are big stacks of quarters.

1723
01:06:09,140 --> 01:06:09,980
That's a lot of fun.

1724
01:06:10,860 --> 01:06:12,300
And inside it's just like photos of Vegas history,

1725
01:06:12,300 --> 01:06:14,540
like Evil Knievel jumping over the mountain.

1726
01:06:14,540 --> 01:06:18,340
And a good way to have some fun off the strip

1727
01:06:18,340 --> 01:06:19,620
if you don't feel like firing guns

1728
01:06:19,620 --> 01:06:23,020
or the other stuff that people do during the day in Vegas.

1729
01:06:23,020 --> 01:06:23,860
Liberace.

1730
01:06:24,820 --> 01:06:25,660
I'd like to.

1731
01:06:25,660 --> 01:06:26,980
Would you go to Michael Jackson's house?

1732
01:06:26,980 --> 01:06:29,300
The Bazaar house, as Eva clarified.

1733
01:06:29,300 --> 01:06:32,860
A man takes you to, a man has champagne in his limo

1734
01:06:32,860 --> 01:06:34,660
and takes you to Michael Jackson's house.

1735
01:06:34,660 --> 01:06:35,500
Get in.

1736
01:06:35,500 --> 01:06:36,340
Oh.

1737
01:06:38,220 --> 01:06:40,620
I honestly am contemplating a quick jaunt

1738
01:06:40,620 --> 01:06:44,020
to go see Aerosmith in two weeks in Vegas.

1739
01:06:44,020 --> 01:06:47,460
Wait, now you saw the Grammys, did you not?

1740
01:06:47,460 --> 01:06:48,540
That's not their fault.

1741
01:06:48,540 --> 01:06:50,500
That was an audio mix problem.

1742
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:51,460
What do you mean?

1743
01:06:51,460 --> 01:06:53,180
That was a mix problem, I believe.

1744
01:06:53,180 --> 01:06:55,580
Not a problem with the greatest rock and roll band

1745
01:06:55,580 --> 01:06:56,420
of all time.

1746
01:06:56,420 --> 01:06:58,420
What is, one episode you're telling me

1747
01:06:58,420 --> 01:06:59,980
that his skin looks perfect.

1748
01:06:59,980 --> 01:07:00,820
The next you're telling me

1749
01:07:00,820 --> 01:07:03,060
the Grammys performance wasn't their fault.

1750
01:07:03,060 --> 01:07:04,700
What is this Aerosmith defense?

1751
01:07:04,700 --> 01:07:07,140
I don't think that the performance was their fault.

1752
01:07:07,140 --> 01:07:08,140
I think they couldn't hear.

1753
01:07:08,140 --> 01:07:08,980
It was a real important though.

1754
01:07:08,980 --> 01:07:11,060
Were they on the rotating Lil Nas X stage

1755
01:07:11,060 --> 01:07:12,380
that I just missed?

1756
01:07:12,380 --> 01:07:14,260
There was a room, they forgot to go to that room.

1757
01:07:14,260 --> 01:07:15,260
How'd they go to the room?

1758
01:07:15,260 --> 01:07:16,900
Hey, they're banging on the door.

1759
01:07:16,900 --> 01:07:17,740
Come see us.

1760
01:07:17,740 --> 01:07:20,780
Mason Ramsey, the yodeling kid locked us in here.

1761
01:07:20,780 --> 01:07:25,980
The arrows also, going to see Aerosmith

1762
01:07:25,980 --> 01:07:28,060
is also if I can figure out,

1763
01:07:28,060 --> 01:07:30,860
if we can figure out a way to get free tickets.

1764
01:07:30,860 --> 01:07:32,060
Well, listeners.

1765
01:07:32,060 --> 01:07:35,380
Well, I'm not, there's a few things I'm exploring.

1766
01:07:35,380 --> 01:07:36,220
Oh, I see.

1767
01:07:36,220 --> 01:07:37,060
Yeah.

1768
01:07:37,060 --> 01:07:40,300
I'm writing a letter to Steven Tyler, handwritten.

1769
01:07:40,300 --> 01:07:41,140
I got his address.

1770
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:42,220
I like how this is stationary.

1771
01:07:42,220 --> 01:07:43,060
Yeah.

1772
01:07:43,060 --> 01:07:44,100
Just real letter based now.

1773
01:07:44,100 --> 01:07:46,340
Claiming that you're his son.

1774
01:07:46,340 --> 01:07:48,500
It's another Liv Tyler situation.

1775
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:50,540
Yeah, he just have to pay up.

1776
01:07:50,540 --> 01:07:52,260
He doesn't even want to go through it.

1777
01:07:52,260 --> 01:07:54,380
Two tickets will shut me up, sir.

1778
01:07:54,380 --> 01:07:55,980
You don't even have to meet me after.

1779
01:07:55,980 --> 01:07:56,820
Yeah.

1780
01:07:56,820 --> 01:07:57,640
Though I'd let ya.

1781
01:07:57,640 --> 01:07:59,820
Yeah, if you would drape a scarf

1782
01:07:59,820 --> 01:08:02,420
from your mic stand on to me during the performance.

1783
01:08:02,420 --> 01:08:03,260
Like it to bless me.

1784
01:08:03,260 --> 01:08:04,500
We'll ravel you up.

1785
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:05,740
Yeah.

1786
01:08:05,740 --> 01:08:08,620
My next favorite one is the city of industry.

1787
01:08:08,620 --> 01:08:10,580
The theme is industry.

1788
01:08:10,580 --> 01:08:11,420
Yes.

1789
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:12,260
Yes.

1790
01:08:13,700 --> 01:08:15,460
There's big gears.

1791
01:08:15,460 --> 01:08:18,220
There's huge bolts on the outside.

1792
01:08:18,220 --> 01:08:19,140
Yeah.

1793
01:08:19,140 --> 01:08:19,980
Wonderful.

1794
01:08:19,980 --> 01:08:22,940
And then inside there's like big 1800s tech.

1795
01:08:22,940 --> 01:08:24,100
It kind of looks like the journey

1796
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:25,780
to the center of the earth ride.

1797
01:08:26,620 --> 01:08:28,700
It's very exciting. Gears and steampunk.

1798
01:08:28,700 --> 01:08:29,740
Yeah, yeah.

1799
01:08:29,740 --> 01:08:31,900
If you're a steampunk and you want to do some like

1800
01:08:31,900 --> 01:08:34,620
cool photos, go check out the prize

1801
01:08:34,620 --> 01:08:37,540
and check out the city of industry in general.

1802
01:08:37,540 --> 01:08:42,020
This was one that had a great toy selection.

1803
01:08:42,020 --> 01:08:45,220
Toys that no child would ever want.

1804
01:08:45,220 --> 01:08:50,220
One that I saw was from a brand of toy called Yellies.

1805
01:08:51,020 --> 01:08:53,940
And the specific, I don't know what Yellies means.

1806
01:08:53,940 --> 01:08:55,940
I guess they make a sound if you touch them.

1807
01:08:55,940 --> 01:08:57,700
But the, I don't remember this.

1808
01:08:57,700 --> 01:09:00,340
I just took a photo that the specific Yellie

1809
01:09:00,340 --> 01:09:03,700
I was looking at was named Toofy Spooder.

1810
01:09:03,700 --> 01:09:08,700
So if you want to give your child a Toofy Spooder

1811
01:09:08,780 --> 01:09:10,620
and then have him like wait to see if then

1812
01:09:10,620 --> 01:09:12,020
you're just playing a prank

1813
01:09:12,020 --> 01:09:13,740
and you're going to give him the real toy.

1814
01:09:13,740 --> 01:09:16,340
I've looked up Yellies.

1815
01:09:16,340 --> 01:09:19,380
Fluffer Puff is one.

1816
01:09:19,380 --> 01:09:21,780
Yellies Peaks is one I believe.

1817
01:09:21,780 --> 01:09:23,940
Yellies Clutzers.

1818
01:09:23,940 --> 01:09:26,100
Yellies Clutzers, Toofy Spooder.

1819
01:09:26,100 --> 01:09:27,380
Bo Dangles is one.

1820
01:09:27,380 --> 01:09:30,140
Mr. Bo Dangles.

1821
01:09:30,140 --> 01:09:31,540
Mr. Bo Dangles.

1822
01:09:31,540 --> 01:09:33,020
Here's Toofy Spooder.

1823
01:09:33,020 --> 01:09:34,620
I see Toofy Spooder right here.

1824
01:09:36,620 --> 01:09:38,740
Only one left in stock, order now.

1825
01:09:38,740 --> 01:09:40,340
Yeah.

1826
01:09:40,340 --> 01:09:43,300
There's one child who's been brainwashed into thinking

1827
01:09:43,300 --> 01:09:47,460
what Kyle's movie Brigsby Bear he thinks.

1828
01:09:47,460 --> 01:09:48,300
Oh right, yes.

1829
01:09:48,300 --> 01:09:49,780
There's only one piece of entertainment

1830
01:09:49,780 --> 01:09:51,100
and it's Yellies and Toofy Spooder.

1831
01:09:51,100 --> 01:09:53,820
Toofy Spooder is the only character.

1832
01:09:53,820 --> 01:09:56,020
Parents are listening to this going like

1833
01:09:56,940 --> 01:09:59,380
you idiots, Yellies were like the tickle me

1834
01:09:59,380 --> 01:10:01,740
Elmo of last year, you morons.

1835
01:10:01,740 --> 01:10:03,460
People are so mad for not knowing Yellies.

1836
01:10:03,460 --> 01:10:05,340
You would know, the Toofies, I barely

1837
01:10:05,340 --> 01:10:09,620
survived the Toofy Spooder phenomenon of 2017.

1838
01:10:09,620 --> 01:10:10,780
Did we mention the?

1839
01:10:10,780 --> 01:10:13,980
Uncut Gems, there's a Toofy Spooder that's diamond encrusted.

1840
01:10:13,980 --> 01:10:16,740
I got a Toofy Spooder, it blinks.

1841
01:10:16,740 --> 01:10:19,740
I originated this shit.

1842
01:10:19,740 --> 01:10:23,140
Houston, Texas's entryway is oil derricks.

1843
01:10:23,140 --> 01:10:25,260
Oil.

1844
01:10:25,420 --> 01:10:27,700
There will be blood ass entryway.

1845
01:10:27,700 --> 01:10:30,900
Rach Ross Perot visited, he'd be so happy.

1846
01:10:30,900 --> 01:10:33,820
The Austin, Texas one is a huge piano.

1847
01:10:33,820 --> 01:10:36,460
It's for contributing the music scene there.

1848
01:10:38,580 --> 01:10:40,620
Not all the entrances are great and sometimes

1849
01:10:40,620 --> 01:10:43,060
there's a theme that's great beyond that.

1850
01:10:43,060 --> 01:10:45,260
We forgot to say about the Burbank one,

1851
01:10:45,260 --> 01:10:46,980
UFO crashing out of it.

1852
01:10:46,980 --> 01:10:47,820
Yes, very good.

1853
01:10:47,820 --> 01:10:49,060
This thing just belongs in City Walk.

1854
01:10:49,060 --> 01:10:49,900
Yeah.

1855
01:10:49,900 --> 01:10:50,900
It's total City Walk style.

1856
01:10:50,900 --> 01:10:52,340
Yeah.

1857
01:10:52,340 --> 01:10:56,020
They also had a toy in City of Industry called Pooperooz.

1858
01:10:56,020 --> 01:10:58,500
These are toys that poop prizes.

1859
01:10:58,500 --> 01:11:00,860
There's another little toy inside if you squeeze.

1860
01:11:00,860 --> 01:11:02,060
Let me look it up, Pooperooz.

1861
01:11:02,060 --> 01:11:03,500
Pooperooz.

1862
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:05,820
I just found something called FurReal.

1863
01:11:05,820 --> 01:11:09,020
FurReal friends, Ricky, the trick loving interactive plush

1864
01:11:09,020 --> 01:11:10,020
pet toy.

1865
01:11:10,020 --> 01:11:11,220
Trick loving.

1866
01:11:11,220 --> 01:11:12,940
Sorry, what am I looking at?

1867
01:11:12,940 --> 01:11:13,820
Pooperooz.

1868
01:11:13,820 --> 01:11:14,580
Pooperooz.

1869
01:11:14,580 --> 01:11:16,700
P-O-O-P.

1870
01:11:16,700 --> 01:11:18,500
Not Toofy Spoodler.

1871
01:11:18,500 --> 01:11:20,140
Pooperooz is not Toofy Spoodler.

1872
01:11:20,140 --> 01:11:22,820
Toofy Spoodler is not a Pooperooz.

1873
01:11:22,820 --> 01:11:24,460
Toofy Spoodler is a Yelly.

1874
01:11:24,460 --> 01:11:27,900
Pooperooz, squishy surprise pooping pet and toy toilet.

1875
01:11:27,900 --> 01:11:28,980
Styles may vary.

1876
01:11:28,980 --> 01:11:30,020
Toilet.

1877
01:11:30,020 --> 01:11:33,500
Yeah, you can get a toilet with this character.

1878
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:36,540
Look at, she's coming out of the toilet.

1879
01:11:36,540 --> 01:11:37,700
She lives in the toilet?

1880
01:11:37,700 --> 01:11:39,060
Jason, look.

1881
01:11:39,060 --> 01:11:41,700
She lives in the toilet.

1882
01:11:41,700 --> 01:11:42,380
Wow.

1883
01:11:42,380 --> 01:11:44,020
Pooperooz.

1884
01:11:44,020 --> 01:11:44,940
And just to be.

1885
01:11:44,940 --> 01:11:46,380
Mattel makes Pooperooz.

1886
01:11:46,380 --> 01:11:47,020
Whoa.

1887
01:11:47,020 --> 01:11:47,740
Oh, look at this.

1888
01:11:47,740 --> 01:11:49,620
This is a glammed up toilet.

1889
01:11:49,660 --> 01:11:51,300
This is a pink sparkly toilet.

1890
01:11:51,300 --> 01:11:54,380
Yeah, we got sparkles all over that thing.

1891
01:11:54,380 --> 01:11:56,580
My Jay Leno is my Sandler.

1892
01:11:56,580 --> 01:11:57,420
Yeah.

1893
01:11:57,420 --> 01:11:59,580
Yeah.

1894
01:11:59,580 --> 01:12:02,500
Mattel Pooperooz, squishy surprise pooping pet and toy

1895
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:04,260
toilet assortment.

1896
01:12:04,260 --> 01:12:06,740
I want to clarify that, again, on these shelves

1897
01:12:06,740 --> 01:12:10,220
that there were as many Toofy Spooders and as many Pooperooz

1898
01:12:10,220 --> 01:12:12,980
as there were Will Smith genies.

1899
01:12:12,980 --> 01:12:15,340
Exactly the same amount of stock.

1900
01:12:15,340 --> 01:12:17,860
Oh, there's also a toy called Lockstars.

1901
01:12:17,860 --> 01:12:21,780
That is a toy where it's like locks that have faces.

1902
01:12:21,780 --> 01:12:23,940
What if your favorite locks came to life?

1903
01:12:23,940 --> 01:12:25,380
Lockstars.

1904
01:12:25,380 --> 01:12:27,380
Oh my god, no.

1905
01:12:27,380 --> 01:12:28,420
All right, Lockstars.

1906
01:12:28,420 --> 01:12:29,740
Lockstars.

1907
01:12:29,740 --> 01:12:31,060
We got to get all of these guys.

1908
01:12:31,060 --> 01:12:33,660
Not Rockstars, Lockstars, which is good.

1909
01:12:33,660 --> 01:12:34,420
All right, I've found.

1910
01:12:34,420 --> 01:12:37,860
I'm going to dunk all these in some CEO love or like,

1911
01:12:37,860 --> 01:12:41,700
gentlemen today or Mr. Yes.

1912
01:12:41,700 --> 01:12:42,900
Big time number one.

1913
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:43,940
Big time number one.

1914
01:12:43,940 --> 01:12:45,300
Pooperooz makes Lockstars.

1915
01:12:45,300 --> 01:12:46,420
Seven great times.

1916
01:12:46,420 --> 01:12:47,340
Midnight man.

1917
01:12:47,340 --> 01:12:50,180
Download the collector's list for Lockstars

1918
01:12:50,180 --> 01:12:52,060
from the Hasbro website.

1919
01:12:52,060 --> 01:12:52,900
So these are all like names.

1920
01:12:52,900 --> 01:12:54,260
Do the Lockstars have names?

1921
01:12:54,260 --> 01:12:55,220
That's what I'm looking for.

1922
01:12:55,220 --> 01:12:56,260
Oh yeah, please.

1923
01:12:56,260 --> 01:12:57,500
We got to know.

1924
01:12:57,500 --> 01:12:59,100
Oh, this is in a different language.

1925
01:12:59,100 --> 01:13:00,980
They're just locks.

1926
01:13:00,980 --> 01:13:02,060
List of, no.

1927
01:13:02,060 --> 01:13:04,700
There's definitely some angry bird times.

1928
01:13:04,700 --> 01:13:06,780
Teach your kid to love locks.

1929
01:13:06,780 --> 01:13:09,340
Yeah, that's a thing they need.

1930
01:13:09,340 --> 01:13:11,140
Locks and toilets.

1931
01:13:11,140 --> 01:13:13,860
Lockstars, I can't find their names.

1932
01:13:13,860 --> 01:13:16,260
Now I look forward to going to the bathroom

1933
01:13:16,260 --> 01:13:19,420
because I think I'm giving a gift to my favorite Pooperooz.

1934
01:13:19,420 --> 01:13:24,100
Pooperooz, it says also Pooperooz Surprise-arooz,

1935
01:13:24,100 --> 01:13:25,820
which are blind figures.

1936
01:13:25,820 --> 01:13:27,900
So you don't know what Pooperooz you're buying

1937
01:13:27,900 --> 01:13:29,580
and what toilet they come with.

1938
01:13:30,500 --> 01:13:31,580
The toilets are different.

1939
01:13:31,580 --> 01:13:32,780
This is a gold toilet.

1940
01:13:36,300 --> 01:13:38,460
Oh, and you scoop out their shit.

1941
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:40,980
Okay, so here's what happens.

1942
01:13:40,980 --> 01:13:42,180
Sorry, what is a Pooperooz?

1943
01:13:42,180 --> 01:13:44,060
A Pooperooz lives in the toilet and shits?

1944
01:13:44,060 --> 01:13:47,100
Pooperooz lives, okay, so this is like a bunny Pooperooz

1945
01:13:47,100 --> 01:13:49,300
with a little pink wig on.

1946
01:13:49,300 --> 01:13:52,220
And then once you take the bunny out,

1947
01:13:52,220 --> 01:13:55,180
you take a little scooper and you clean up the bunny shit

1948
01:13:55,180 --> 01:13:57,020
from the gold toilet.

1949
01:13:57,020 --> 01:13:58,300
Gold toilet?

1950
01:13:58,300 --> 01:14:00,820
So like a Liberace toilet.

1951
01:14:00,820 --> 01:14:01,660
I guess he would have that

1952
01:14:01,660 --> 01:14:03,540
or he would have the pink sparkly toilet.

1953
01:14:03,540 --> 01:14:05,940
So the Pooperooz also poop.

1954
01:14:05,940 --> 01:14:06,780
Yes.

1955
01:14:06,780 --> 01:14:09,540
They are, they live in a toilet and probably eat poop,

1956
01:14:09,540 --> 01:14:11,380
but then poop out the poop as poop.

1957
01:14:11,380 --> 01:14:13,940
But one of those is a toilet with a face.

1958
01:14:14,900 --> 01:14:16,340
Is a toilet a Pooperooz

1959
01:14:16,340 --> 01:14:18,020
or is that just the housing of a Pooperooz?

1960
01:14:18,020 --> 01:14:19,140
I think it's the housing of a Pooperooz,

1961
01:14:19,140 --> 01:14:22,660
but the toilet is sentient and likes getting pooped in.

1962
01:14:22,660 --> 01:14:23,500
Nom nom nom.

1963
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:24,340
So this is Pooperooz.

1964
01:14:24,340 --> 01:14:26,940
Like our droid invention, P-O-O-P.

1965
01:14:26,940 --> 01:14:30,820
Yes, like the droid, the bathroom droid

1966
01:14:30,820 --> 01:14:32,980
that we had Mace Windu take a shit in.

1967
01:14:34,340 --> 01:14:36,060
Pooperooz. He says delicious.

1968
01:14:36,060 --> 01:14:38,500
He thinks you messed a Windu.

1969
01:14:38,500 --> 01:14:42,020
Family of whimsically cute squishy pooping pets.

1970
01:14:42,060 --> 01:14:43,580
This Pooperooz multipack

1971
01:14:43,580 --> 01:14:45,860
comes with two original Pooperooz figures,

1972
01:14:45,860 --> 01:14:49,700
a sheep and a dog and one surprise baby Pooperooz figure.

1973
01:14:49,700 --> 01:14:52,300
There are two possible baby figures for each set.

1974
01:14:52,300 --> 01:14:54,180
Unbox your Pooperooz family pack

1975
01:14:54,180 --> 01:14:56,940
to see which baby Pooperooz pet will be yours.

1976
01:14:56,940 --> 01:14:58,580
Includes a mini toilet that hides

1977
01:14:58,580 --> 01:15:01,020
two magical dissolving paper packages

1978
01:15:01,020 --> 01:15:04,740
with your Pooperooz pet baby themed foods inside.

1979
01:15:04,740 --> 01:15:08,980
Feed your Pooperooz pets, then squeeze to help them go.

1980
01:15:08,980 --> 01:15:10,060
Oh my God.

1981
01:15:10,060 --> 01:15:13,460
So they eat food, they shit in a special toilet

1982
01:15:13,460 --> 01:15:17,300
that is sentient that can talk and winks at you.

1983
01:15:17,300 --> 01:15:18,340
Nom nom nom.

1984
01:15:18,340 --> 01:15:20,460
And then you clean up the toilet.

1985
01:15:20,460 --> 01:15:23,780
So the toilet is not actually hooked up to plumbing.

1986
01:15:23,780 --> 01:15:26,100
You're the one who scoops it out as if it was cat litter.

1987
01:15:26,100 --> 01:15:27,460
Oh yeah, oh great.

1988
01:15:27,460 --> 01:15:29,980
So if you don't like that toilets

1989
01:15:29,980 --> 01:15:32,820
make their own poop go away with water

1990
01:15:32,820 --> 01:15:35,940
and you wish you could fish poop out of toilets.

1991
01:15:35,940 --> 01:15:38,740
Okay, here's a storage case for your Pooperooz.

1992
01:15:40,140 --> 01:15:41,300
In a briefcase?

1993
01:15:41,300 --> 01:15:42,660
Your toilet briefcase.

1994
01:15:44,260 --> 01:15:46,460
All right, yes, well I've been working very hard

1995
01:15:46,460 --> 01:15:49,740
on the presentation and I think you're going to

1996
01:15:49,740 --> 01:15:51,980
invest a lot in our company if I could just,

1997
01:15:51,980 --> 01:15:54,500
oh no, I took the Pooperoo briefcase.

1998
01:15:55,620 --> 01:15:58,940
My God damn son screwed me again.

1999
01:15:58,940 --> 01:16:01,620
I left it in a cab.

2000
01:16:01,620 --> 01:16:04,060
My toilet briefcase in a cab.

2001
01:16:04,060 --> 01:16:04,900
Moving on.

2002
01:16:04,900 --> 01:16:06,260
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have made this a drug deal

2003
01:16:06,260 --> 01:16:09,540
where there's three million dollars in a briefcase

2004
01:16:09,540 --> 01:16:10,940
but he took the Pooperooz.

2005
01:16:10,940 --> 01:16:11,780
Yeah that's.

2006
01:16:12,900 --> 01:16:15,700
All right Hasbro quarterly earnings call.

2007
01:16:15,700 --> 01:16:18,420
Moving on from the Star Wars unit.

2008
01:16:18,420 --> 01:16:20,420
Heading into the Pooperoo unit.

2009
01:16:20,420 --> 01:16:22,220
We're seeing record sales.

2010
01:16:23,900 --> 01:16:26,860
This is, I do like this a lot.

2011
01:16:26,860 --> 01:16:27,900
Get some Pooperooz.

2012
01:16:27,900 --> 01:16:29,620
So I may have to start getting some Pooperooz.

2013
01:16:29,620 --> 01:16:34,620
I cannot find the names of the lock stars but I don't know.

2014
01:16:35,780 --> 01:16:37,820
How would you name a lock star?

2015
01:16:37,820 --> 01:16:39,020
I'm Kenneth Key.

2016
01:16:39,020 --> 01:16:40,620
I'm Kenneth Keyhole.

2017
01:16:40,620 --> 01:16:43,580
There's no themes when you're dealing with locks.

2018
01:16:43,580 --> 01:16:44,420
Yeah.

2019
01:16:44,420 --> 01:16:45,620
There's no facets.

2020
01:16:45,620 --> 01:16:47,500
I'm a Connie combination.

2021
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:50,540
Lock star names.

2022
01:16:50,540 --> 01:16:51,420
Mickey metal.

2023
01:16:51,420 --> 01:16:52,860
Mickey metal is pretty good.

2024
01:16:53,820 --> 01:16:56,220
This elsewhere, besides toys,

2025
01:16:56,220 --> 01:16:59,020
this particular fries had a price tag printing machine

2026
01:16:59,020 --> 01:17:02,540
that was just printing into oblivion with the tag.

2027
01:17:02,540 --> 01:17:05,380
Just a big ribbon of tag piling up.

2028
01:17:05,380 --> 01:17:08,220
I feel like maybe now it just is engulfed the entire store.

2029
01:17:08,380 --> 01:17:09,500
No one stops it.

2030
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:10,460
If you open the door,

2031
01:17:10,460 --> 01:17:15,460
he would just get flooded by one single giant price tag ribbon.

2032
01:17:15,660 --> 01:17:20,140
And maybe most notably in the cool vinyl section,

2033
01:17:20,140 --> 01:17:25,140
this fries had a vinyl of the essential R Kelly.

2034
01:17:25,180 --> 01:17:27,180
Still, I checked the date.

2035
01:17:27,180 --> 01:17:30,460
This was the month after Surviving R Kelly aired

2036
01:17:30,460 --> 01:17:32,940
and they were featuring it huge.

2037
01:17:32,940 --> 01:17:34,740
Buy your R Kelly guys.

2038
01:17:34,740 --> 01:17:37,940
Load up before it's illegal to do this.

2039
01:17:37,940 --> 01:17:38,780
Yeah.

2040
01:17:39,700 --> 01:17:40,740
Incredible.

2041
01:17:40,740 --> 01:17:44,300
R Kelly right next to Toofy's, Spooders and Pooperoo's.

2042
01:17:44,300 --> 01:17:45,420
This is the place.

2043
01:17:45,420 --> 01:17:47,340
So that's my number three.

2044
01:17:49,020 --> 01:17:50,340
I'm down to two more.

2045
01:17:52,220 --> 01:17:56,540
Atlantis is the theme of my second favorite,

2046
01:17:56,540 --> 01:17:59,060
which is in San Marcos, California.

2047
01:17:59,060 --> 01:18:01,100
And I credit a listener to the show,

2048
01:18:01,100 --> 01:18:03,020
and forgive me, I don't recall your name offhand

2049
01:18:03,020 --> 01:18:04,620
if you're listening now,

2050
01:18:04,620 --> 01:18:06,980
but somebody after our Christmas show was like,

2051
01:18:08,580 --> 01:18:10,060
I know you guys wanna talk about fries.

2052
01:18:10,060 --> 01:18:11,980
You have to go check out the,

2053
01:18:11,980 --> 01:18:14,820
say this one, it's like near Carlsbad,

2054
01:18:14,820 --> 01:18:16,380
themed after Atlantis.

2055
01:18:16,380 --> 01:18:18,340
And in fact, it inspired a trip there.

2056
01:18:18,340 --> 01:18:21,740
And I took, like we ended up going to Coronado Island

2057
01:18:21,740 --> 01:18:22,860
with partially thinking,

2058
01:18:22,860 --> 01:18:24,820
oh, and then we can go see the remaining fries

2059
01:18:24,820 --> 01:18:25,660
for this episode.

2060
01:18:25,660 --> 01:18:26,940
Oh my God.

2061
01:18:26,940 --> 01:18:28,500
This one, yeah.

2062
01:18:28,500 --> 01:18:30,420
Oh yes.

2063
01:18:30,420 --> 01:18:32,940
This is a lot of information to get, isn't it?

2064
01:18:34,500 --> 01:18:36,620
This one, as I said, the rule of thumb is,

2065
01:18:36,620 --> 01:18:38,660
is there anything good in the entrance area?

2066
01:18:38,660 --> 01:18:43,660
When you walk into this store, there are two soldiers.

2067
01:18:43,700 --> 01:18:48,060
There are soldiers in the war for Atlantis.

2068
01:18:48,060 --> 01:18:50,260
They are like standing in tubes.

2069
01:18:50,260 --> 01:18:53,660
They're being preserved like by amniotic fluid

2070
01:18:53,660 --> 01:18:56,980
so that they can fight, protect Atlantis one day.

2071
01:18:56,980 --> 01:18:59,580
They look like storm troopers mixed with like

2072
01:18:59,580 --> 01:19:02,700
sea diver helmets, like old, like, you know,

2073
01:19:02,700 --> 01:19:04,260
20,000 leagues into the sea helmets.

2074
01:19:04,420 --> 01:19:07,420
And they have armor that is made of turtle shells

2075
01:19:07,420 --> 01:19:09,060
and scorpions.

2076
01:19:09,060 --> 01:19:11,660
Like this is like Atlantis world building.

2077
01:19:11,660 --> 01:19:14,260
They thought like, what would an Atlantis soldier uniform

2078
01:19:14,260 --> 01:19:15,100
look like?

2079
01:19:15,100 --> 01:19:17,900
Well, they'd protect themselves with big turtle shells.

2080
01:19:17,900 --> 01:19:18,740
That's awesome.

2081
01:19:18,740 --> 01:19:19,580
That's legitimately awesome.

2082
01:19:19,580 --> 01:19:20,420
That is great.

2083
01:19:20,420 --> 01:19:21,260
Yeah.

2084
01:19:21,260 --> 01:19:24,340
Then above you, you look and there's a huge chariot

2085
01:19:24,340 --> 01:19:28,180
made out of shells made out of like a big cone shell.

2086
01:19:29,300 --> 01:19:31,500
It looks like something King Triton would be in.

2087
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:33,540
Again, this one, incredible art design.

2088
01:19:33,540 --> 01:19:34,500
It's so great.

2089
01:19:34,500 --> 01:19:36,500
The chandeliers are made of shells.

2090
01:19:36,500 --> 01:19:38,540
There's a language that they made up

2091
01:19:38,540 --> 01:19:40,540
like the Indiana Jones adventure.

2092
01:19:40,540 --> 01:19:42,020
Wow, really?

2093
01:19:42,020 --> 01:19:42,980
Yeah, I think so.

2094
01:19:42,980 --> 01:19:45,260
If you like, you can kind of read the English

2095
01:19:45,260 --> 01:19:48,980
if you look close, but if they had decoders like that, right.

2096
01:19:50,060 --> 01:19:52,380
A language in a store.

2097
01:19:52,380 --> 01:19:55,700
There's giant aquariums all over the thing.

2098
01:19:55,700 --> 01:19:57,500
And they say like the fries fish.

2099
01:19:57,500 --> 01:19:59,980
Thank you for not tapping on the wall.

2100
01:20:00,940 --> 01:20:04,500
There's like a, there's so many fish that live in this one.

2101
01:20:04,500 --> 01:20:07,060
This one has a little cafe with an aquarium window outside

2102
01:20:07,060 --> 01:20:08,660
and there are eels in it.

2103
01:20:08,660 --> 01:20:10,900
There's eels that live right outside.

2104
01:20:10,900 --> 01:20:13,780
I took a video where I just panned from an eel

2105
01:20:13,780 --> 01:20:16,980
over to a Pepsi machine that no one's taken a Pepsi from

2106
01:20:16,980 --> 01:20:17,940
in four months.

2107
01:20:17,940 --> 01:20:19,220
Wow.

2108
01:20:19,220 --> 01:20:20,500
But that's a cafe.

2109
01:20:20,500 --> 01:20:21,340
That's a cafe, yes.

2110
01:20:21,340 --> 01:20:22,380
There's a cafe in that one, okay.

2111
01:20:22,380 --> 01:20:24,900
Which I don't think is named anything fun

2112
01:20:24,900 --> 01:20:26,020
even though it's Atlantis.

2113
01:20:26,020 --> 01:20:28,620
But like, the set design in this one,

2114
01:20:28,620 --> 01:20:29,980
this one has like, forgive me,

2115
01:20:29,980 --> 01:20:30,980
I don't know the technical term,

2116
01:20:30,980 --> 01:20:33,900
but you know like the old electricity conductor

2117
01:20:33,900 --> 01:20:36,260
where it's kind of rabbit ears and then like,

2118
01:20:36,260 --> 01:20:39,860
zzzz, like single bolts are shooting up and out of it.

2119
01:20:39,860 --> 01:20:41,620
There's a couple of those that are huge

2120
01:20:41,620 --> 01:20:43,980
and plaques that tell you the history of those.

2121
01:20:45,020 --> 01:20:49,660
Some of this fries genuinely looks like a lower budget

2122
01:20:49,660 --> 01:20:51,380
Tokyo Disney Sea.

2123
01:20:51,380 --> 01:20:52,900
That is how it feels.

2124
01:20:52,900 --> 01:20:53,740
Yeah.

2125
01:20:55,060 --> 01:20:57,500
I can't even, we need to know who made these.

2126
01:20:57,980 --> 01:20:59,660
We have to figure that out.

2127
01:20:59,660 --> 01:21:01,020
Yeah, yeah.

2128
01:21:01,020 --> 01:21:02,940
Because they tried, they really tried.

2129
01:21:02,940 --> 01:21:05,860
They had to like, Atlantis doesn't write itself.

2130
01:21:05,860 --> 01:21:08,540
We don't really, there's no firm movie

2131
01:21:08,540 --> 01:21:11,740
that is the Atlantis movie and they figured it out.

2132
01:21:12,580 --> 01:21:16,020
I would wanna watch the movie that is like this store.

2133
01:21:16,020 --> 01:21:18,460
I'm gonna text Doug Barnes and see if he knows.

2134
01:21:18,460 --> 01:21:20,140
Good idea, yes.

2135
01:21:20,140 --> 01:21:21,980
Theme park insiders.

2136
01:21:21,980 --> 01:21:23,700
He might, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2137
01:21:23,700 --> 01:21:25,500
That's a very good call.

2138
01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:27,180
Also this one you can buy a flash drive

2139
01:21:27,860 --> 01:21:29,260
that looks like a minion.

2140
01:21:29,260 --> 01:21:30,100
Oh yeah, that's nice.

2141
01:21:30,100 --> 01:21:30,940
So that's fun and helpful.

2142
01:21:30,940 --> 01:21:33,700
Was it listener Beedy who told you about Fries

2143
01:21:33,700 --> 01:21:35,700
who gave us the record albums after Christmas?

2144
01:21:35,700 --> 01:21:37,340
Yes, yes, who gave us presents, yes.

2145
01:21:37,340 --> 01:21:38,180
Yes, very nice.

2146
01:21:38,180 --> 01:21:39,020
Okay, there you go, yeah.

2147
01:21:39,020 --> 01:21:39,860
Yeah.

2148
01:21:39,860 --> 01:21:40,700
Well, yeah, if you're listening.

2149
01:21:40,700 --> 01:21:41,540
Thank you, shout out again for those presents.

2150
01:21:41,540 --> 01:21:43,220
Thank you for inspiring a fun trip.

2151
01:21:44,260 --> 01:21:46,300
And yeah, this was what you were totally right.

2152
01:21:46,300 --> 01:21:47,780
It was totally worth making the trip for.

2153
01:21:47,780 --> 01:21:49,020
Yeah.

2154
01:21:49,020 --> 01:21:49,860
It was great.

2155
01:21:49,860 --> 01:21:50,900
This one's wonderful.

2156
01:21:50,900 --> 01:21:54,100
I went looking for pictures of this Fries

2157
01:21:54,100 --> 01:21:56,580
and found a message board for people

2158
01:21:56,580 --> 01:21:58,940
into something called Mermaiding.

2159
01:21:58,940 --> 01:22:02,980
And that appears to be living their lives

2160
01:22:02,980 --> 01:22:06,180
or being mermaid enthusiasts.

2161
01:22:06,180 --> 01:22:08,900
And well, this will keep me up,

2162
01:22:08,900 --> 01:22:11,420
but they seem very excited to find out

2163
01:22:11,420 --> 01:22:13,020
about the Atlantis Fries.

2164
01:22:13,020 --> 01:22:14,660
You Jesus.

2165
01:22:14,660 --> 01:22:15,980
Oh no.

2166
01:22:15,980 --> 01:22:18,020
It's like a place where they can go live.

2167
01:22:18,020 --> 01:22:18,860
Don't judge what, don't judge.

2168
01:22:18,860 --> 01:22:21,020
I think they're just gonna go hang.

2169
01:22:21,860 --> 01:22:24,260
I mean, I guess if I can support steampunks

2170
01:22:24,260 --> 01:22:26,020
taking photos of the industry one,

2171
01:22:26,020 --> 01:22:27,820
then I should be happy for the mermaid-ers.

2172
01:22:27,820 --> 01:22:29,300
Sure, mermaid-ers.

2173
01:22:29,300 --> 01:22:31,220
And if we're gonna support the pooperoo's

2174
01:22:31,220 --> 01:22:34,500
and all these other alternative lifestyles.

2175
01:22:36,020 --> 01:22:37,780
There's a ton of,

2176
01:22:37,780 --> 01:22:40,060
there's room for specific fetishists

2177
01:22:40,060 --> 01:22:41,140
within the fries community.

2178
01:22:41,140 --> 01:22:43,020
I assume, yeah, there's humans that are like,

2179
01:22:43,020 --> 01:22:45,500
kind of pooperoo's, like they're living,

2180
01:22:45,500 --> 01:22:47,940
like furry versions of pooperoo's,

2181
01:22:47,940 --> 01:22:49,700
where they poop in a toilet with a face

2182
01:22:49,700 --> 01:22:51,140
and then scoop it out

2183
01:22:51,140 --> 01:22:53,060
and don't send it to the sewer system.

2184
01:22:53,060 --> 01:22:56,020
I'm not a person, I'm a little pooperoo.

2185
01:22:57,660 --> 01:22:59,100
To play in the toilet all day.

2186
01:22:59,100 --> 01:23:00,540
Oh man.

2187
01:23:00,540 --> 01:23:03,100
We need to dress up as pooperoo's.

2188
01:23:03,100 --> 01:23:04,380
If Fries was really smart,

2189
01:23:04,380 --> 01:23:06,220
they would start catering to that market

2190
01:23:06,220 --> 01:23:07,980
and selling gigantic toilets

2191
01:23:07,980 --> 01:23:11,020
that people could live in and pretend to be pooperoo's.

2192
01:23:11,020 --> 01:23:13,420
And of course make them gold.

2193
01:23:13,420 --> 01:23:16,820
Each giant gold toilet costs $50,000.

2194
01:23:16,820 --> 01:23:21,820
The placement of the big aquarium in the Atlantis Fries

2195
01:23:22,340 --> 01:23:25,060
makes it seem like that is the brain trust.

2196
01:23:25,060 --> 01:23:28,980
Like this collection of coral and fish and eels are like,

2197
01:23:28,980 --> 01:23:31,300
this is, we must protect,

2198
01:23:31,300 --> 01:23:34,460
we must protect the brain trust, the council.

2199
01:23:34,460 --> 01:23:35,820
It's like the Citadel, yes.

2200
01:23:35,820 --> 01:23:37,580
That's where the Justice League lives.

2201
01:23:37,580 --> 01:23:38,420
Yeah. Yes.

2202
01:23:38,420 --> 01:23:40,540
And so you'd cut to board meetings there

2203
01:23:40,540 --> 01:23:45,220
with like a Neptune guy and then a huge turtle who speaks.

2204
01:23:45,420 --> 01:23:48,380
They're going after the coral.

2205
01:23:48,380 --> 01:23:50,620
The coral wall won't be strong enough.

2206
01:23:50,620 --> 01:23:52,540
They'll chip away at it.

2207
01:23:52,540 --> 01:23:55,580
Just throw out the HD DVD players.

2208
01:23:55,580 --> 01:23:59,620
Blue Ray won that battle years ago.

2209
01:23:59,620 --> 01:24:01,620
We never know, it could come back around.

2210
01:24:01,620 --> 01:24:03,300
It's not going to come back around.

2211
01:24:03,300 --> 01:24:05,580
It's not like a laser discs or cassettes.

2212
01:24:05,580 --> 01:24:07,180
There's no enthusiast.

2213
01:24:07,180 --> 01:24:08,220
Silence.

2214
01:24:08,220 --> 01:24:13,060
And then a Triton guy like whips a big line of seaweed.

2215
01:24:14,020 --> 01:24:15,460
Watch.

2216
01:24:15,460 --> 01:24:19,020
I will not have this insolence here in the presentation room.

2217
01:24:22,100 --> 01:24:26,580
So that brings us to my absolute favorite one.

2218
01:24:26,580 --> 01:24:28,580
And counting down all the way to number one.

2219
01:24:28,580 --> 01:24:29,580
And we're finally here,

2220
01:24:29,580 --> 01:24:32,740
the number one of the themed fries countdown.

2221
01:24:32,740 --> 01:24:36,620
And they really had to bring it in the backyard

2222
01:24:36,620 --> 01:24:39,980
of Disneyland, Anaheim, California.

2223
01:24:40,140 --> 01:24:43,540
The pressure was on and they did not disappoint.

2224
01:24:43,540 --> 01:24:45,660
The Anaheim fries,

2225
01:24:45,660 --> 01:24:47,180
it's not going to sound like the greatest thing

2226
01:24:47,180 --> 01:24:51,380
once I say it, but it is like a NASA space station.

2227
01:24:53,100 --> 01:24:55,980
And it's just very well done.

2228
01:24:55,980 --> 01:24:57,700
There's big satellites.

2229
01:24:57,700 --> 01:24:59,500
It has cafe, canaveral,

2230
01:24:59,500 --> 01:25:02,420
where of course you could buy rock music themed smoothies.

2231
01:25:03,820 --> 01:25:07,100
There's like little toy space shuttles

2232
01:25:07,100 --> 01:25:09,940
that are going along tracks that just like go back and forth

2233
01:25:10,900 --> 01:25:12,020
and you can watch those for a while.

2234
01:25:12,020 --> 01:25:14,780
The theater is inside a huge space shuttle.

2235
01:25:14,780 --> 01:25:19,020
They have Apple think different posters still.

2236
01:25:19,020 --> 01:25:19,860
Classic.

2237
01:25:21,100 --> 01:25:22,860
This is the one where he opened a refrigerator

2238
01:25:22,860 --> 01:25:25,180
and a Jake Paul calendar was inside.

2239
01:25:26,660 --> 01:25:30,740
So, I mean, none of that sounds that great in and of itself,

2240
01:25:30,740 --> 01:25:34,620
but here is why it's my favorite fries.

2241
01:25:34,620 --> 01:25:37,540
There is a sign and the sign says,

2242
01:25:37,540 --> 01:25:39,860
launch your own space shuttle.

2243
01:25:40,780 --> 01:25:41,620
What are you talking about?

2244
01:25:41,620 --> 01:25:42,460
What does that mean?

2245
01:25:42,460 --> 01:25:45,540
Then you look under the sign and there is like

2246
01:25:45,540 --> 01:25:49,300
a giant half space command car.

2247
01:25:49,300 --> 01:25:51,180
I don't know spaceships well enough to describe,

2248
01:25:51,180 --> 01:25:53,900
but it's almost like just to the capsule parts

2249
01:25:53,900 --> 01:25:57,020
that the Apollo 13 astronauts have to land in

2250
01:25:57,020 --> 01:25:58,660
is the big triangular thing.

2251
01:25:58,660 --> 01:26:00,820
It's like one of those sliced down the middle

2252
01:26:00,820 --> 01:26:02,620
and there's a little set of stairs

2253
01:26:02,620 --> 01:26:04,740
and you can walk inside of it.

2254
01:26:04,740 --> 01:26:07,500
And it's a full console unit with like computers

2255
01:26:07,500 --> 01:26:09,420
and buttons that you can push.

2256
01:26:10,180 --> 01:26:13,420
I think it's a photo of Neil Armstrong.

2257
01:26:13,420 --> 01:26:17,380
And you go in there and like, wow, this is cool.

2258
01:26:17,380 --> 01:26:20,700
And then a little video starts.

2259
01:26:20,700 --> 01:26:25,700
And the video is, so it's just like kind of some like

2260
01:26:25,820 --> 01:26:30,820
space doodads, a little like asteroid shapes whizzing by.

2261
01:26:31,580 --> 01:26:36,180
And then a man appears in a little frame

2262
01:26:36,180 --> 01:26:39,140
and he's in an orange astronaut jumpsuit.

2263
01:26:40,060 --> 01:26:44,260
And he's very flat and pleasant, just like the most like,

2264
01:26:44,260 --> 01:26:46,580
you know, kind of by the numbers guy.

2265
01:26:46,580 --> 01:26:49,420
And he says, welcome to mission control.

2266
01:26:49,420 --> 01:26:51,540
We need you on our team.

2267
01:26:51,540 --> 01:26:53,340
Your role as our new flight director means

2268
01:26:53,340 --> 01:26:55,140
that you are directly in command

2269
01:26:55,140 --> 01:26:57,060
of today's space shuttle launch.

2270
01:26:57,060 --> 01:26:59,100
Our launch sequence has begun.

2271
01:26:59,100 --> 01:27:00,780
So prepare to press that red button

2272
01:27:00,780 --> 01:27:02,100
directly in front of you.

2273
01:27:02,100 --> 01:27:03,900
You turn and look, there is a red button

2274
01:27:03,900 --> 01:27:04,900
and it starts flashing.

2275
01:27:04,900 --> 01:27:06,220
Press the red button.

2276
01:27:06,220 --> 01:27:08,060
And we're like, what, what does this do?

2277
01:27:08,100 --> 01:27:10,020
And then we look around the bigger store

2278
01:27:10,020 --> 01:27:13,220
and the same video is playing on a huge screen

2279
01:27:13,220 --> 01:27:16,020
projected like over by the checkout aisle.

2280
01:27:17,340 --> 01:27:19,100
And now pressure is on.

2281
01:27:19,100 --> 01:27:19,940
What do you mean?

2282
01:27:19,940 --> 01:27:21,860
I have to launch the space shuttle myself.

2283
01:27:21,860 --> 01:27:24,180
You're like, you're not sure when to press it.

2284
01:27:24,180 --> 01:27:25,500
And then finally it starts telling you,

2285
01:27:25,500 --> 01:27:27,060
oh, okay, you press the red button.

2286
01:27:27,060 --> 01:27:29,260
And then you turn and you look

2287
01:27:29,260 --> 01:27:34,260
and you see a video of a spaceship launching

2288
01:27:34,860 --> 01:27:37,100
from a top of the Anaheim fries.

2289
01:27:38,220 --> 01:27:42,260
Specifically, it is the one that you are in

2290
01:27:42,260 --> 01:27:43,500
and you recognize it.

2291
01:27:43,500 --> 01:27:47,300
And then beautiful Apollo 13 music plays.

2292
01:27:47,300 --> 01:27:48,940
It's all very stirring.

2293
01:27:48,940 --> 01:27:50,980
There's a space launch and you did it.

2294
01:27:50,980 --> 01:27:51,980
You did it yourself.

2295
01:27:51,980 --> 01:27:55,700
It's very similar to Blue 32's alien spacecraft

2296
01:27:55,700 --> 01:27:58,460
taking off from the MGM Grand.

2297
01:27:58,460 --> 01:28:02,060
From the, yeah, composite it into the MGM Grand

2298
01:28:02,060 --> 01:28:03,100
where you are.

2299
01:28:04,060 --> 01:28:05,900
It's all so wonderful.

2300
01:28:05,900 --> 01:28:09,500
It's like an interactive experience.

2301
01:28:09,500 --> 01:28:10,540
They need you.

2302
01:28:10,540 --> 01:28:11,860
Let me play you a little bit of this video

2303
01:28:11,860 --> 01:28:13,380
just to get a sense of the guy

2304
01:28:13,380 --> 01:28:16,260
and just kind of the vibe of the graphics.

2305
01:28:16,260 --> 01:28:18,500
It's small where you guys are, but take a look.

2306
01:28:18,500 --> 01:28:21,820
Welcome to mission control.

2307
01:28:21,820 --> 01:28:24,300
We need you on our team.

2308
01:28:24,300 --> 01:28:26,100
Your role as our new flight director

2309
01:28:26,100 --> 01:28:27,580
means that you are directly in.

2310
01:28:27,580 --> 01:28:29,660
So I don't know who this guy is.

2311
01:28:29,660 --> 01:28:32,220
I don't know if he works in the store or something,

2312
01:28:32,220 --> 01:28:37,220
but it's, what this guy got to do essentially is my dream.

2313
01:28:37,940 --> 01:28:40,820
This is a pre-ride video

2314
01:28:40,820 --> 01:28:43,460
that plays in a really specific location

2315
01:28:43,460 --> 01:28:46,740
all day constantly on a loop.

2316
01:28:46,740 --> 01:28:49,660
And it can only be seen at the Anon Fros.

2317
01:28:49,660 --> 01:28:52,220
It feels so much like the Warbird and Soren intro

2318
01:28:52,220 --> 01:28:53,060
or something.

2319
01:28:54,380 --> 01:28:56,260
And I just love that this is there.

2320
01:28:56,260 --> 01:28:57,540
It's exactly my dream.

2321
01:28:57,540 --> 01:28:58,860
You go into some boring store

2322
01:28:58,860 --> 01:29:02,140
and there's a video that plays that is only there.

2323
01:29:03,060 --> 01:29:04,380
And the only thing I don't like about it

2324
01:29:04,380 --> 01:29:06,340
is that I'm not in it.

2325
01:29:06,340 --> 01:29:08,820
I am so jealous of this.

2326
01:29:08,820 --> 01:29:10,380
I want to be the flight,

2327
01:29:10,380 --> 01:29:12,860
the guy directing you to press the red button.

2328
01:29:12,860 --> 01:29:14,540
It would make me so happy.

2329
01:29:14,540 --> 01:29:16,700
There's no reason it should be me.

2330
01:29:16,700 --> 01:29:18,060
Why would it be me?

2331
01:29:18,060 --> 01:29:19,740
I'm not really an actor.

2332
01:29:19,740 --> 01:29:22,420
I didn't know the people making this at the time.

2333
01:29:22,420 --> 01:29:23,460
I don't know when it was made.

2334
01:29:23,460 --> 01:29:27,460
I don't know if it was made 15 years ago or two years ago,

2335
01:29:27,460 --> 01:29:31,820
but I really want to be in this video.

2336
01:29:31,820 --> 01:29:34,460
So here's what I did.

2337
01:29:34,460 --> 01:29:35,580
You put yourself in the video.

2338
01:29:35,580 --> 01:29:37,180
I put myself in the video.

2339
01:29:38,380 --> 01:29:41,780
Now allow me to explain what exactly I mean by that.

2340
01:29:41,780 --> 01:29:43,700
And I'll pull out the second screen

2341
01:29:43,700 --> 01:29:45,260
so that you guys can see.

2342
01:29:46,660 --> 01:29:48,180
What I'm about to show you.

2343
01:29:48,180 --> 01:29:49,380
Fries does seem like a place

2344
01:29:49,380 --> 01:29:50,820
that would still have a lot of ads

2345
01:29:50,820 --> 01:29:54,020
about the second screen experience.

2346
01:29:54,020 --> 01:29:56,980
A thing the media was trying to really catch on

2347
01:29:56,980 --> 01:29:59,380
eight or 10 years ago that did not stick.

2348
01:29:59,380 --> 01:30:01,060
It's happening with this

2349
01:30:01,060 --> 01:30:02,820
because we now, you the listener,

2350
01:30:02,820 --> 01:30:04,260
are gonna have to go to our Twitter

2351
01:30:04,260 --> 01:30:07,100
so that you can see a clip of this.

2352
01:30:07,100 --> 01:30:08,700
So what I'm gonna show you guys,

2353
01:30:08,700 --> 01:30:12,260
the clip that I just showed you of that fellow,

2354
01:30:12,260 --> 01:30:15,540
I have recreated to a T.

2355
01:30:15,540 --> 01:30:16,740
Oh my God.

2356
01:30:17,740 --> 01:30:18,980
Welcome to mission control.

2357
01:30:18,980 --> 01:30:21,580
I need you on our team.

2358
01:30:21,580 --> 01:30:22,980
Your role is our new flight director.

2359
01:30:22,980 --> 01:30:23,820
I'll let it play for a minute.

2360
01:30:23,820 --> 01:30:26,620
The man of today's space shuttle launch.

2361
01:30:26,620 --> 01:30:28,740
Our launch sequence has begun.

2362
01:30:28,740 --> 01:30:30,300
So prepare to press that red button

2363
01:30:30,300 --> 01:30:31,700
directly in front of you.

2364
01:30:31,700 --> 01:30:34,380
And proceed to mission STS-10.

2365
01:30:34,380 --> 01:30:35,220
Good luck.

2366
01:30:35,220 --> 01:30:36,340
And have a good flight.

2367
01:30:37,660 --> 01:30:40,540
So I rented a space suit to do this.

2368
01:30:40,540 --> 01:30:41,380
Wow, wow.

2369
01:30:43,460 --> 01:30:46,140
It happened to be once I got it and put it on

2370
01:30:46,140 --> 01:30:48,900
by just sheer coincidence,

2371
01:30:48,900 --> 01:30:51,500
the exact same space suit that he was wearing.

2372
01:30:51,500 --> 01:30:52,340
Really?

2373
01:30:52,340 --> 01:30:55,140
I don't know if it was rented from the same costume place

2374
01:30:55,140 --> 01:30:57,980
or if it's just a standard issue space suit costume,

2375
01:30:57,980 --> 01:31:00,140
but it was exactly it.

2376
01:31:00,140 --> 01:31:03,460
And I filmed this by myself

2377
01:31:03,460 --> 01:31:06,020
in front of green fabric in my apartment.

2378
01:31:08,100 --> 01:31:08,940
How long?

2379
01:31:08,940 --> 01:31:09,780
Wow.

2380
01:31:09,780 --> 01:31:12,380
How long, all of it to take to put together?

2381
01:31:12,380 --> 01:31:13,220
I'm not sure.

2382
01:31:13,220 --> 01:31:16,260
I've been shipping away at it slowly.

2383
01:31:16,260 --> 01:31:18,980
I filmed it a really long time ago.

2384
01:31:18,980 --> 01:31:19,820
Wow.

2385
01:31:19,820 --> 01:31:21,620
And then I've tried to prioritize, you know,

2386
01:31:21,620 --> 01:31:23,300
like actual work.

2387
01:31:24,540 --> 01:31:26,940
That would have generated a massive amount of income,

2388
01:31:26,940 --> 01:31:27,780
hopefully.

2389
01:31:28,620 --> 01:31:29,460
Or some income.

2390
01:31:29,460 --> 01:31:31,140
I've tried to do things that have not been

2391
01:31:31,140 --> 01:31:33,420
at a financial or time loss to me.

2392
01:31:33,420 --> 01:31:34,260
Yeah.

2393
01:31:34,260 --> 01:31:36,820
So it took me, but a month or so ago,

2394
01:31:36,820 --> 01:31:38,140
I picked it up and I recreate.

2395
01:31:38,140 --> 01:31:40,380
So we'll post a side by side,

2396
01:31:40,380 --> 01:31:42,420
but this is exactly the,

2397
01:31:42,420 --> 01:31:45,100
I do motion graphics too.

2398
01:31:45,100 --> 01:31:48,780
I recreated the frame and I tried to recreate the delivery.

2399
01:31:48,780 --> 01:31:50,700
I didn't like put a bunch of stank on it.

2400
01:31:50,700 --> 01:31:52,180
I even tried takes where I was a little more,

2401
01:31:52,180 --> 01:31:53,580
we need you and blah.

2402
01:31:53,580 --> 01:31:55,300
And then I realized, no, no, no,

2403
01:31:55,300 --> 01:31:56,940
I gotta be like that guy.

2404
01:31:57,140 --> 01:31:58,660
I have to do exactly what he did.

2405
01:31:58,660 --> 01:31:59,740
That's the charm of it.

2406
01:31:59,740 --> 01:32:00,860
Yeah, yes.

2407
01:32:00,860 --> 01:32:02,020
He's not showy.

2408
01:32:02,020 --> 01:32:04,660
He's not putting on some like sweaty performance

2409
01:32:04,660 --> 01:32:07,540
and that's what I tried to do as well.

2410
01:32:08,620 --> 01:32:12,020
So where does that leave us now?

2411
01:32:13,940 --> 01:32:15,860
What I now have to go do.

2412
01:32:15,860 --> 01:32:17,860
Yes, I'm sure I'm thinking the same thing,

2413
01:32:17,860 --> 01:32:19,180
but yes, continue.

2414
01:32:19,180 --> 01:32:20,580
I have this produced.

2415
01:32:20,580 --> 01:32:22,780
And I also, I didn't show you this,

2416
01:32:22,780 --> 01:32:24,300
but I have all of the components up

2417
01:32:24,300 --> 01:32:26,260
through the space launch part as well.

2418
01:32:26,260 --> 01:32:28,780
The opening logo with the Charlie chip.

2419
01:32:28,780 --> 01:32:31,220
I've been spending my time very wisely.

2420
01:32:31,220 --> 01:32:32,060
Wow.

2421
01:32:33,260 --> 01:32:35,100
This is a second gate episode too.

2422
01:32:35,100 --> 01:32:35,940
I, yes.

2423
01:32:35,940 --> 01:32:36,780
Spine the paywall.

2424
01:32:36,780 --> 01:32:40,500
I, the reason to do all of this is none.

2425
01:32:40,500 --> 01:32:41,660
It's just for my, you know.

2426
01:32:41,660 --> 01:32:42,500
Hey, I get it.

2427
01:32:42,500 --> 01:32:44,580
It's for my, I feel like I have an opening here.

2428
01:32:44,580 --> 01:32:46,100
Disney's not gonna put me in something.

2429
01:32:46,100 --> 01:32:47,020
Universal's not gonna put,

2430
01:32:47,020 --> 01:32:48,380
I don't think even a Bush Gardens

2431
01:32:48,380 --> 01:32:49,620
is gonna put me in a video.

2432
01:32:49,620 --> 01:32:50,460
Right.

2433
01:32:50,460 --> 01:32:53,740
This feels like my chance to give people instructions

2434
01:32:53,740 --> 01:32:56,740
in a specific place to do a specific thing

2435
01:32:56,740 --> 01:33:00,300
and be seen on a loop all day, every day.

2436
01:33:00,300 --> 01:33:02,100
But first I have to do one thing.

2437
01:33:02,100 --> 01:33:05,780
I have to go talk to someone at the Anaheim fries

2438
01:33:05,780 --> 01:33:07,060
and get them to play this.

2439
01:33:07,060 --> 01:33:07,900
Yes.

2440
01:33:07,900 --> 01:33:09,260
Now I don't know who that person is.

2441
01:33:09,260 --> 01:33:10,820
The website lists, you know,

2442
01:33:10,820 --> 01:33:13,260
an official general manager you can call.

2443
01:33:13,260 --> 01:33:15,460
I'm gonna, I'm just gonna go and suss it out

2444
01:33:15,460 --> 01:33:17,460
and see who I can talk to.

2445
01:33:17,460 --> 01:33:19,940
You, I'm trying to think here.

2446
01:33:20,860 --> 01:33:24,060
Is there any scenario where the manager

2447
01:33:24,060 --> 01:33:26,020
doesn't start hitting the panic button?

2448
01:33:26,020 --> 01:33:29,220
Like in a casino or a bank?

2449
01:33:29,220 --> 01:33:32,020
Well, you know, it's really, I mean, what,

2450
01:33:32,020 --> 01:33:34,020
so let's play this out.

2451
01:33:34,020 --> 01:33:37,700
I go in and you know, maybe important context

2452
01:33:37,700 --> 01:33:40,500
is that I've thought through like,

2453
01:33:40,500 --> 01:33:43,700
why would they just for no reason

2454
01:33:43,700 --> 01:33:45,700
take out the video that they already have?

2455
01:33:45,700 --> 01:33:47,660
And potentially, I don't know who that guy is

2456
01:33:47,660 --> 01:33:48,500
in the original one.

2457
01:33:48,500 --> 01:33:49,340
Right.

2458
01:33:49,340 --> 01:33:51,860
The employee could be like the CEO of fries.

2459
01:33:51,860 --> 01:33:52,700
I don't know.

2460
01:33:52,700 --> 01:33:53,540
Yeah.

2461
01:33:53,540 --> 01:33:55,700
So the stakes could be, yeah, I don't know.

2462
01:33:55,700 --> 01:33:57,460
I think it is an actual fry family.

2463
01:33:57,460 --> 01:33:59,540
So that guy could be a fry.

2464
01:33:59,540 --> 01:34:00,380
Right.

2465
01:34:00,380 --> 01:34:01,300
In which case, I don't think I have any chance

2466
01:34:01,300 --> 01:34:02,140
of overturning him.

2467
01:34:02,140 --> 01:34:02,980
No.

2468
01:34:02,980 --> 01:34:06,340
But if he's like a manager who perhaps even left in a huff

2469
01:34:06,340 --> 01:34:07,620
and was like a problem,

2470
01:34:07,620 --> 01:34:09,620
then maybe they've been looking to get rid of him.

2471
01:34:09,620 --> 01:34:10,460
I don't know.

2472
01:34:10,460 --> 01:34:11,820
I truly have no information on that.

2473
01:34:11,820 --> 01:34:13,460
What is your approach?

2474
01:34:13,460 --> 01:34:15,820
Are you gonna send a letter first?

2475
01:34:15,820 --> 01:34:16,780
Are you gonna go with person?

2476
01:34:16,780 --> 01:34:19,180
Are you gonna wear a suit?

2477
01:34:20,020 --> 01:34:21,060
Or just a shirt and tie?

2478
01:34:21,060 --> 01:34:21,900
Or casual?

2479
01:34:21,900 --> 01:34:22,740
Dear Mr. McGruff.

2480
01:34:22,740 --> 01:34:25,420
I think, well, I think I'm gonna call,

2481
01:34:25,420 --> 01:34:27,500
I need to come up with a reason,

2482
01:34:27,500 --> 01:34:29,540
like what is the shorthand for why I need to speak

2483
01:34:29,540 --> 01:34:31,060
to the general manager?

2484
01:34:31,060 --> 01:34:32,700
I don't know that offhand.

2485
01:34:32,700 --> 01:34:33,540
I'll figure that out.

2486
01:34:33,540 --> 01:34:35,820
I'll just say, like, maybe I can say like,

2487
01:34:35,820 --> 01:34:37,420
I'm a vendor and I'm interested in,

2488
01:34:37,420 --> 01:34:39,620
no, I shouldn't say I'm trying to sell a product.

2489
01:34:39,620 --> 01:34:40,900
I don't really know.

2490
01:34:40,900 --> 01:34:43,500
That initial approach, I'm not totally sure.

2491
01:34:43,500 --> 01:34:47,380
But why does the store need to change out this video

2492
01:34:47,700 --> 01:34:49,180
and put me in it?

2493
01:34:49,180 --> 01:34:50,780
I'll tell you why.

2494
01:34:50,780 --> 01:34:55,780
The old version was not 4K HD,

2495
01:34:55,860 --> 01:34:57,740
which the new video is.

2496
01:34:57,740 --> 01:35:01,020
I finally, people have been begging for it.

2497
01:35:01,020 --> 01:35:03,460
I've finally taken the Anaheim launch sequence

2498
01:35:03,460 --> 01:35:07,060
and rendered it in the best format we have, 4K.

2499
01:35:07,060 --> 01:35:08,500
And this is an electronics store.

2500
01:35:08,500 --> 01:35:10,900
They need to be cutting edge, right?

2501
01:35:10,900 --> 01:35:12,940
They need this thing to be in 4K.

2502
01:35:12,940 --> 01:35:17,020
Is the TV monitor they're using 4K capable?

2503
01:35:17,020 --> 01:35:17,940
Probably not, no.

2504
01:35:17,940 --> 01:35:19,300
It's like, it's a projector

2505
01:35:19,300 --> 01:35:22,700
and then it's like a little tiny screen inside of a space.

2506
01:35:22,700 --> 01:35:24,220
But I still think it's gonna look sharper.

2507
01:35:24,220 --> 01:35:26,060
It's gonna look nicer.

2508
01:35:26,060 --> 01:35:30,860
So I just, because I'm a local and I'm a fan of the store,

2509
01:35:30,860 --> 01:35:35,860
just on spec, I wanted to recreate this presentation in 4K.

2510
01:35:37,220 --> 01:35:39,780
And because the original actor wasn't available to me,

2511
01:35:39,780 --> 01:35:41,460
I decided to step in for myself.

2512
01:35:41,460 --> 01:35:43,020
I recast the part.

2513
01:35:43,020 --> 01:35:46,220
I think that you should say all of that,

2514
01:35:46,220 --> 01:35:48,980
all the things you just said, all that information,

2515
01:35:48,980 --> 01:35:51,820
you should run into the fries yelling,

2516
01:35:51,820 --> 01:35:54,620
where is the manager with the computer open

2517
01:35:54,620 --> 01:35:57,020
and just start yelling that at the manager

2518
01:35:57,020 --> 01:35:59,300
and playing off of your computer.

2519
01:35:59,300 --> 01:36:01,140
I could add that I have a heat gun

2520
01:36:01,140 --> 01:36:03,140
that I purchased at a fries.

2521
01:36:04,460 --> 01:36:07,500
I would not yell I have a gun of any kind.

2522
01:36:08,460 --> 01:36:10,300
I would ease all my anger on the urgency.

2523
01:36:10,300 --> 01:36:11,140
The footage is 4K now,

2524
01:36:11,140 --> 01:36:11,980
but I didn't have the original actor.

2525
01:36:11,980 --> 01:36:13,100
So I pulled myself in the footage.

2526
01:36:13,100 --> 01:36:13,940
Take a look at the footage.

2527
01:36:13,940 --> 01:36:14,780
Let's do this now.

2528
01:36:14,780 --> 01:36:15,820
Let's go change out the footage.

2529
01:36:16,340 --> 01:36:17,380
Let's talk followers.

2530
01:36:17,380 --> 01:36:19,540
Here's the number of followers you have on the internet.

2531
01:36:19,540 --> 01:36:20,700
Here's the number I have.

2532
01:36:20,700 --> 01:36:22,180
I can boost the followers.

2533
01:36:22,180 --> 01:36:25,460
How many followers does Fries have on Twitter?

2534
01:36:25,460 --> 01:36:26,300
Let's flip that up.

2535
01:36:26,300 --> 01:36:27,940
I thought we were competing even.

2536
01:36:27,940 --> 01:36:30,020
I read that Fries, it took them a while

2537
01:36:30,020 --> 01:36:31,820
to get into the online game.

2538
01:36:31,820 --> 01:36:34,420
Yeah, their website has been weak.

2539
01:36:34,420 --> 01:36:35,580
Yeah, it's real bad.

2540
01:36:35,580 --> 01:36:36,420
Yes.

2541
01:36:36,420 --> 01:36:37,380
So I don't even know.

2542
01:36:37,380 --> 01:36:38,220
I don't see.

2543
01:36:38,220 --> 01:36:39,580
They don't have a fun snarky.

2544
01:36:39,580 --> 01:36:41,660
35.6K followers.

2545
01:36:41,660 --> 01:36:42,500
Damn it.

2546
01:36:42,500 --> 01:36:44,060
Yeah, but we had six that.

2547
01:36:44,300 --> 01:36:46,420
But they haven't posted since Black Friday.

2548
01:36:46,420 --> 01:36:47,380
Oh my God.

2549
01:36:47,380 --> 01:36:48,220
Oh my God.

2550
01:36:48,220 --> 01:36:51,020
Well, look, when we post this,

2551
01:36:51,020 --> 01:36:52,620
they're gonna see Twitter activity

2552
01:36:52,620 --> 01:36:54,260
like they haven't seen in forever.

2553
01:36:54,260 --> 01:36:55,100
That's true.

2554
01:36:55,100 --> 01:36:56,060
They're gonna be shocked at the numbers.

2555
01:36:56,060 --> 01:36:59,340
Just like when we gave Eisner the podcast, The Ride Bump.

2556
01:36:59,340 --> 01:37:00,180
Yes.

2557
01:37:00,180 --> 01:37:01,940
One of his most active tweets was our video.

2558
01:37:01,940 --> 01:37:02,780
Right.

2559
01:37:02,780 --> 01:37:05,180
And this video could do the same thing for Fries.

2560
01:37:05,180 --> 01:37:06,740
And we got acknowledged on the other one.

2561
01:37:06,740 --> 01:37:08,980
And I think we could get acknowledged here.

2562
01:37:08,980 --> 01:37:09,820
I think you're right.

2563
01:37:09,820 --> 01:37:13,340
Oh, some controversy in the replies.

2564
01:37:13,380 --> 01:37:14,540
Oh, at Fries?

2565
01:37:14,540 --> 01:37:15,380
Yeah.

2566
01:37:15,380 --> 01:37:16,220
Oh no.

2567
01:37:16,220 --> 01:37:18,180
Bernie Bros.

2568
01:37:18,180 --> 01:37:19,420
Fries Bros.

2569
01:37:19,420 --> 01:37:21,380
At Gravis Lizard says,

2570
01:37:21,380 --> 01:37:23,060
in case you missed it,

2571
01:37:23,060 --> 01:37:26,700
we now know why Fries Electronics is a ghost town.

2572
01:37:26,700 --> 01:37:29,300
They're trying to convert to a consignment model

2573
01:37:29,300 --> 01:37:32,380
because they can't or won't pay for merchandise.

2574
01:37:32,380 --> 01:37:35,660
Apparently this is what Best Buy and Walmart do.

2575
01:37:35,660 --> 01:37:38,540
And Fries vendors haven't bit yet.

2576
01:37:38,540 --> 01:37:40,220
And Fries replied,

2577
01:37:40,220 --> 01:37:41,500
Hi Gravis.

2578
01:37:42,460 --> 01:37:45,980
We are adding vendors every week and stock along with it.

2579
01:37:45,980 --> 01:37:48,180
We appreciate any patience and support

2580
01:37:48,180 --> 01:37:49,580
during this transition.

2581
01:37:50,740 --> 01:37:53,460
So, you know, I don't know what Axe,

2582
01:37:53,460 --> 01:37:55,780
this Gravis has to grind.

2583
01:37:55,780 --> 01:37:57,540
I don't know what his deal is, but.

2584
01:37:57,540 --> 01:37:58,740
They did respond.

2585
01:37:58,740 --> 01:38:01,580
He was a little negative and he got their attention.

2586
01:38:01,580 --> 01:38:03,020
But that was mid December

2587
01:38:03,020 --> 01:38:05,020
and it's been radio silence ever since,

2588
01:38:05,020 --> 01:38:06,060
even in the replies.

2589
01:38:06,060 --> 01:38:07,980
It's time to liven up the Twitter.

2590
01:38:07,980 --> 01:38:10,420
It's time to give their social media something to do.

2591
01:38:10,420 --> 01:38:11,260
Yes.

2592
01:38:11,900 --> 01:38:14,220
I don't want to do some approach that's angry.

2593
01:38:14,220 --> 01:38:17,220
I don't want people demanding that I be in the thing.

2594
01:38:17,220 --> 01:38:19,180
What I'm going to do, I'm going to post this.

2595
01:38:19,180 --> 01:38:21,340
And if you're listening to this

2596
01:38:21,340 --> 01:38:22,500
and you want to watch my video

2597
01:38:22,500 --> 01:38:24,540
and just comment something nice, like,

2598
01:38:24,540 --> 01:38:25,900
wow, cool vid.

2599
01:38:25,900 --> 01:38:28,820
Boy, people would flip out if they saw this.

2600
01:38:28,820 --> 01:38:29,660
Yeah.

2601
01:38:29,660 --> 01:38:32,460
Excellent work, astronaut sir.

2602
01:38:32,460 --> 01:38:33,780
Yeah.

2603
01:38:33,780 --> 01:38:35,900
Just say something nice and that like,

2604
01:38:35,900 --> 01:38:38,060
you enjoyed it and I seem cool.

2605
01:38:38,060 --> 01:38:38,900
Yeah.

2606
01:38:38,900 --> 01:38:41,380
And then they'll see so much positive reaction

2607
01:38:41,380 --> 01:38:43,700
and I'll have like a, you know,

2608
01:38:43,700 --> 01:38:46,500
like when a, how it's always a good idea

2609
01:38:46,500 --> 01:38:49,020
to cast somebody who's big on social media in a movie.

2610
01:38:49,020 --> 01:38:49,860
Yeah, yeah.

2611
01:38:49,860 --> 01:38:51,260
That's kind of what I'd be getting here.

2612
01:38:51,260 --> 01:38:52,260
It makes the movie better.

2613
01:38:52,260 --> 01:38:53,140
It always does.

2614
01:38:53,140 --> 01:38:54,740
And all of the followers, all,

2615
01:38:54,740 --> 01:38:56,700
if you put a Vine star in your movie,

2616
01:38:56,700 --> 01:39:00,780
all the followers are going to go see the movie, for sure.

2617
01:39:00,780 --> 01:39:02,420
And that's what I think could happen.

2618
01:39:02,420 --> 01:39:04,660
I think I could even propose that, you know,

2619
01:39:04,660 --> 01:39:07,620
I'm actually a host of a podcast

2620
01:39:07,660 --> 01:39:09,100
and we've got a pretty big following.

2621
01:39:09,100 --> 01:39:10,220
And I think I could promise,

2622
01:39:10,220 --> 01:39:12,180
and it's people who are often in Anaheim

2623
01:39:12,180 --> 01:39:13,020
going to Disneyland.

2624
01:39:13,020 --> 01:39:13,860
Right.

2625
01:39:13,860 --> 01:39:15,060
And I think I could promise that if we, you know,

2626
01:39:15,060 --> 01:39:18,580
say you did some kind of events to now, you know,

2627
01:39:18,580 --> 01:39:20,980
officially unveil the new video,

2628
01:39:20,980 --> 01:39:24,100
we could get probably a lot of our listeners to come

2629
01:39:24,100 --> 01:39:26,020
and spend some money in the store

2630
01:39:26,020 --> 01:39:29,660
to get some, to get a peachy Paul and mango

2631
01:39:29,660 --> 01:39:30,700
at Cafe Canaveral.

2632
01:39:30,700 --> 01:39:32,500
Or a broken USB fan.

2633
01:39:32,500 --> 01:39:33,340
Yeah.

2634
01:39:33,340 --> 01:39:35,660
Yeah, catering's taken care of.

2635
01:39:35,660 --> 01:39:37,380
Or, you know, get a,

2636
01:39:38,420 --> 01:39:40,780
buy a cologne called like,

2637
01:39:40,780 --> 01:39:42,860
the number one city gentleman.

2638
01:39:42,860 --> 01:39:45,620
Pooper, or a poopable.

2639
01:39:45,620 --> 01:39:46,460
What is it called?

2640
01:39:46,460 --> 01:39:47,540
The Poopadillies.

2641
01:39:47,540 --> 01:39:48,380
No.

2642
01:39:48,380 --> 01:39:49,220
Pooperooz.

2643
01:39:49,220 --> 01:39:50,420
Pooperooz.

2644
01:39:50,420 --> 01:39:51,260
I said Pooperooz.

2645
01:39:51,260 --> 01:39:52,620
But what was the first one?

2646
01:39:52,620 --> 01:39:53,660
The Yellies.

2647
01:39:53,660 --> 01:39:54,500
The Yellies.

2648
01:39:54,500 --> 01:39:56,060
The Yellies are not Pooperooz.

2649
01:39:56,060 --> 01:39:59,180
There's probably a cologne called like, Pooh opposite.

2650
01:40:00,460 --> 01:40:03,020
If you want to smell like the opposite of poo.

2651
01:40:03,020 --> 01:40:04,260
Right.

2652
01:40:04,260 --> 01:40:05,100
Good poo.

2653
01:40:05,100 --> 01:40:07,340
So go buy some Pooperooz, buy some Pooh opposite.

2654
01:40:08,180 --> 01:40:09,020
I think if there was gonna,

2655
01:40:09,020 --> 01:40:11,060
this is a great chance for them to do an event,

2656
01:40:11,060 --> 01:40:12,820
to drum up interest in the store.

2657
01:40:12,820 --> 01:40:16,940
I know the podcast thread fans are loyal and positive,

2658
01:40:16,940 --> 01:40:20,340
and you're gonna come see your old pal Scott

2659
01:40:20,340 --> 01:40:22,740
make his debut on the big screen.

2660
01:40:22,740 --> 01:40:24,380
He'll come out, right?

2661
01:40:24,380 --> 01:40:26,340
I can't wait to see you there.

2662
01:40:26,340 --> 01:40:27,260
I think they will.

2663
01:40:27,260 --> 01:40:29,660
And then we all, when this happens,

2664
01:40:29,660 --> 01:40:31,700
all of us together, what will we be doing?

2665
01:40:31,700 --> 01:40:34,100
We'll be having fun in a store together.

2666
01:40:34,100 --> 01:40:34,940
Yeah.

2667
01:40:34,940 --> 01:40:38,860
It's incredible universe and it's 1996 and we're having fun.

2668
01:40:38,860 --> 01:40:40,860
We're having a real experience in person.

2669
01:40:40,860 --> 01:40:42,540
We're living our fries story.

2670
01:40:42,540 --> 01:40:43,380
Right. Wow.

2671
01:40:43,380 --> 01:40:45,940
There will be zero clowns though.

2672
01:40:45,940 --> 01:40:46,980
No clowns.

2673
01:40:46,980 --> 01:40:47,940
Unfortunately.

2674
01:40:47,940 --> 01:40:48,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2675
01:40:48,780 --> 01:40:50,380
Unless I pay out of pocket for that.

2676
01:40:50,380 --> 01:40:53,060
And there are one of you guys who wants to dress up.

2677
01:40:53,060 --> 01:40:53,900
I'll dress up.

2678
01:40:53,900 --> 01:40:54,740
Oh, okay.

2679
01:40:54,740 --> 01:40:55,580
All right.

2680
01:40:55,580 --> 01:40:57,020
You and Jason will do it too.

2681
01:40:57,020 --> 01:40:58,300
Carlson the clown.

2682
01:40:59,340 --> 01:41:02,500
I mean, we could also invite an old friend named Choco, but.

2683
01:41:02,500 --> 01:41:03,580
No, wait a minute.

2684
01:41:03,580 --> 01:41:04,420
Okay.

2685
01:41:04,420 --> 01:41:05,260
Cancel the clowns.

2686
01:41:05,260 --> 01:41:06,100
No clowns.

2687
01:41:06,100 --> 01:41:06,940
I'll say this.

2688
01:41:06,940 --> 01:41:08,620
If the fries doesn't want to play ball,

2689
01:41:08,620 --> 01:41:10,220
I say, fuck them.

2690
01:41:10,220 --> 01:41:13,660
And we'll find a store that will play this video.

2691
01:41:13,660 --> 01:41:14,780
Will play this space.

2692
01:41:14,780 --> 01:41:16,500
So they don't have to be space themed.

2693
01:41:16,500 --> 01:41:17,500
Yeah. It doesn't matter.

2694
01:41:17,500 --> 01:41:18,340
Yeah.

2695
01:41:18,340 --> 01:41:21,500
We'll find like a TJ Maxx with like a break room TV.

2696
01:41:21,500 --> 01:41:23,180
And that'll be enough, I think.

2697
01:41:23,180 --> 01:41:25,020
We'll get everyone out to the TJ Maxx.

2698
01:41:25,020 --> 01:41:26,820
Did you mean broken TV?

2699
01:41:26,820 --> 01:41:27,660
You feel like.

2700
01:41:27,660 --> 01:41:30,180
No, I meant break room TV.

2701
01:41:30,180 --> 01:41:31,940
Like a thing in the back that they wheel around

2702
01:41:32,340 --> 01:41:34,340
and they haven't upgraded that in 25 years.

2703
01:41:34,340 --> 01:41:35,180
Yeah.

2704
01:41:35,180 --> 01:41:36,020
That's fine.

2705
01:41:36,020 --> 01:41:37,140
Or play it on the, you know, the little TV

2706
01:41:37,140 --> 01:41:40,380
at a checkout counter at a supermarket.

2707
01:41:40,380 --> 01:41:41,220
I don't care.

2708
01:41:41,220 --> 01:41:42,460
Gas station radio network.

2709
01:41:42,460 --> 01:41:43,300
Yes.

2710
01:41:43,300 --> 01:41:44,140
That's always been a dream.

2711
01:41:44,140 --> 01:41:44,980
Gas station radio.

2712
01:41:44,980 --> 01:41:45,820
Yeah.

2713
01:41:45,820 --> 01:41:48,740
Why have we all just settled into

2714
01:41:48,740 --> 01:41:50,460
that it's only Seth Meyers clips?

2715
01:41:50,460 --> 01:41:53,780
Like we could be providing quality content

2716
01:41:53,780 --> 01:41:56,820
for gas station TVs all the time.

2717
01:41:56,820 --> 01:42:00,100
So what do you guys think I have a shot?

2718
01:42:00,100 --> 01:42:00,940
It's a good question.

2719
01:42:01,100 --> 01:42:03,700
I think that if you could get to someone

2720
01:42:03,700 --> 01:42:07,460
in the Fry's company that is interested

2721
01:42:07,460 --> 01:42:09,100
on a creative level.

2722
01:42:09,100 --> 01:42:10,700
If it's just the general manager,

2723
01:42:10,700 --> 01:42:13,460
I'm a bit skeptical that they're going to

2724
01:42:13,460 --> 01:42:16,380
even know how to do what you're proposing.

2725
01:42:16,380 --> 01:42:19,020
I don't know that they can even access the machine.

2726
01:42:19,020 --> 01:42:20,300
That's what I'm saying.

2727
01:42:20,300 --> 01:42:21,140
Yeah, that's a concern I have.

2728
01:42:21,140 --> 01:42:24,100
You may have to go up to a higher level

2729
01:42:24,100 --> 01:42:25,420
in the Fry's company.

2730
01:42:25,420 --> 01:42:26,260
Yeah.

2731
01:42:26,260 --> 01:42:27,940
Cause I would imagine this stuff breaks down

2732
01:42:27,940 --> 01:42:29,060
once in a while.

2733
01:42:29,060 --> 01:42:31,500
I mean, oftentimes it seems like they don't fix it.

2734
01:42:31,500 --> 01:42:34,900
So maybe they don't have a handy man to repair things.

2735
01:42:34,900 --> 01:42:36,580
Probably one guy works all the Fry's.

2736
01:42:36,580 --> 01:42:38,380
Yeah, one guy who works all the Fry's.

2737
01:42:38,380 --> 01:42:40,660
But if you can get some, I think maybe you shoot

2738
01:42:40,660 --> 01:42:44,820
for a higher level, you shoot for a Fry's PR even.

2739
01:42:44,820 --> 01:42:45,660
Yeah.

2740
01:42:45,660 --> 01:42:48,180
And you see if you can get in that way is because,

2741
01:42:48,180 --> 01:42:49,900
cause yes, going up to the general manager

2742
01:42:49,900 --> 01:42:52,260
who just wants to go home might be tough.

2743
01:42:52,260 --> 01:42:54,940
And it doesn't want to deal like somebody

2744
01:42:54,940 --> 01:42:58,420
who buys a television shows for networks.

2745
01:42:58,420 --> 01:43:00,220
All they want to do is not do any work.

2746
01:43:00,220 --> 01:43:01,060
Yes.

2747
01:43:01,060 --> 01:43:03,260
So they're going to pass immediately.

2748
01:43:03,260 --> 01:43:04,700
And it's exactly the same thing.

2749
01:43:04,700 --> 01:43:06,140
They want to be lazy.

2750
01:43:06,140 --> 01:43:08,740
They just want to like check who's working on Sunday.

2751
01:43:08,740 --> 01:43:10,140
Yeah, that could be trouble.

2752
01:43:10,140 --> 01:43:12,540
So maybe, yeah, maybe try to go up the corporate ladder

2753
01:43:12,540 --> 01:43:16,220
a little bit and don't feel, and look, I think, you know,

2754
01:43:16,220 --> 01:43:19,140
you don't have to be humble about this podcast.

2755
01:43:19,140 --> 01:43:19,980
Yeah.

2756
01:43:19,980 --> 01:43:20,820
Exaggerate.

2757
01:43:20,820 --> 01:43:21,660
Yeah, juice it up.

2758
01:43:21,660 --> 01:43:22,500
How many people listen?

2759
01:43:22,500 --> 01:43:23,340
Now's the time.

2760
01:43:23,340 --> 01:43:25,260
Yeah, we've said numbers that are like,

2761
01:43:25,260 --> 01:43:28,380
you can stretch things to where the number million is used.

2762
01:43:29,380 --> 01:43:34,180
We've had a million downloads in 2019, over.

2763
01:43:34,180 --> 01:43:35,020
Wow.

2764
01:43:35,020 --> 01:43:35,860
That's true.

2765
01:43:35,860 --> 01:43:37,460
You know, a million downloads in 2019.

2766
01:43:37,460 --> 01:43:38,580
So we could be looking at,

2767
01:43:38,580 --> 01:43:41,300
we get a million new shoppers for this.

2768
01:43:41,300 --> 01:43:44,780
Hey, you guys know that Wired magazine you sell?

2769
01:43:45,780 --> 01:43:47,060
Guess who's been in it.

2770
01:43:47,060 --> 01:43:47,900
Okay.

2771
01:43:47,900 --> 01:43:48,720
We've been in this.

2772
01:43:48,720 --> 01:43:50,820
This podcast has been featured in your own,

2773
01:43:50,820 --> 01:43:52,620
we've been in your store already.

2774
01:43:52,620 --> 01:43:53,460
Own magazine.

2775
01:43:53,460 --> 01:43:55,540
Right under your own noses.

2776
01:43:55,540 --> 01:43:56,380
We've been here.

2777
01:43:56,540 --> 01:43:58,620
We hope to someday sell vinyls.

2778
01:43:58,620 --> 01:44:00,540
Our music career is on the rise.

2779
01:44:00,540 --> 01:44:05,540
You still have that GQ-ish from two years ago

2780
01:44:05,620 --> 01:44:07,180
where we are in a list.

2781
01:44:07,180 --> 01:44:09,180
Could we just go to the owner of a fries

2782
01:44:09,180 --> 01:44:11,700
and like have a little USB drive and say like,

2783
01:44:11,700 --> 01:44:14,420
we're selling our podcast in fries now?

2784
01:44:14,420 --> 01:44:17,100
Well, if they're a consignment model,

2785
01:44:17,100 --> 01:44:19,300
at least consignment, you just put it on the shelf

2786
01:44:19,300 --> 01:44:21,460
and no one makes money until it sells.

2787
01:44:21,460 --> 01:44:22,680
Right, so that's what I'm saying.

2788
01:44:22,680 --> 01:44:24,660
So we could put like 10,

2789
01:44:24,700 --> 01:44:26,540
we'll put like the first year of podcast,

2790
01:44:26,540 --> 01:44:28,420
the ride on little drives.

2791
01:44:28,420 --> 01:44:30,420
That's a great idea with our logo.

2792
01:44:30,420 --> 01:44:31,260
Yeah.

2793
01:44:31,260 --> 01:44:32,080
Oh wow.

2794
01:44:32,080 --> 01:44:33,900
This is an angle no podcast is thinking of.

2795
01:44:33,900 --> 01:44:35,260
Yes. Selling in stores.

2796
01:44:35,260 --> 01:44:38,100
It's like country music still sells CDs.

2797
01:44:38,100 --> 01:44:40,540
You gotta go to the right stores

2798
01:44:40,540 --> 01:44:42,460
and sell the physical media.

2799
01:44:42,460 --> 01:44:45,580
Wow, podcast the ride season four.

2800
01:44:45,580 --> 01:44:46,420
Right.

2801
01:44:46,420 --> 01:44:47,260
Yeah, wow.

2802
01:44:47,260 --> 01:44:49,620
You'll buy the seasons on the little flash drive.

2803
01:44:49,620 --> 01:44:51,540
This is where the like, which one's on?

2804
01:44:51,540 --> 01:44:53,300
Oh yeah, Hershey Park with Susser.

2805
01:44:53,300 --> 01:44:55,060
This is a classic season.

2806
01:44:55,060 --> 01:44:56,140
I gotta buy this one.

2807
01:44:56,140 --> 01:44:58,780
We could do commentary on the episodes,

2808
01:44:58,780 --> 01:45:00,660
we could do special features.

2809
01:45:00,660 --> 01:45:01,780
Interactive menus.

2810
01:45:01,780 --> 01:45:02,740
Interactive menus.

2811
01:45:02,740 --> 01:45:04,420
Second screen experience.

2812
01:45:04,420 --> 01:45:07,140
It's gonna be a real second screen experience.

2813
01:45:07,140 --> 01:45:11,340
The making of Scott's Anaheim launch video.

2814
01:45:11,340 --> 01:45:12,180
Yes.

2815
01:45:12,180 --> 01:45:14,580
Unused takes, outtakes,

2816
01:45:14,580 --> 01:45:16,980
moments where I was just cracking myself up.

2817
01:45:16,980 --> 01:45:18,400
Production notes.

2818
01:45:20,060 --> 01:45:20,900
And written notes.

2819
01:45:20,900 --> 01:45:21,740
Yeah, credits.

2820
01:45:21,740 --> 01:45:22,740
Read all of our,

2821
01:45:22,740 --> 01:45:23,700
I missed that from DVDs.

2822
01:45:23,700 --> 01:45:25,580
Read everyone's credits.

2823
01:45:25,580 --> 01:45:26,420
Oh yeah.

2824
01:45:26,420 --> 01:45:27,820
Jason Sheridan, the circle.

2825
01:45:27,820 --> 01:45:28,660
Yeah.

2826
01:45:31,460 --> 01:45:32,300
This is great.

2827
01:45:32,300 --> 01:45:35,460
Well, okay, so this is maybe even a bigger.

2828
01:45:35,460 --> 01:45:36,980
This is a saga.

2829
01:45:36,980 --> 01:45:38,620
And it's in and of itself.

2830
01:45:38,620 --> 01:45:40,140
Collectively have a bigger,

2831
01:45:40,140 --> 01:45:42,100
this could be the start of having a bigger presence.

2832
01:45:42,100 --> 01:45:44,780
Spaghet's the Ride could be the primary podcast

2833
01:45:44,780 --> 01:45:46,220
of Prize Electronics.

2834
01:45:46,220 --> 01:45:47,060
Yeah.

2835
01:45:47,060 --> 01:45:47,980
And it doesn't close tomorrow.

2836
01:45:47,980 --> 01:45:49,060
If they aren't entitled,

2837
01:45:49,060 --> 01:45:50,700
the Anaheim store might be closed

2838
01:45:50,700 --> 01:45:51,820
by the time this comes out.

2839
01:45:51,820 --> 01:45:53,900
We might want to put this out soon.

2840
01:45:53,900 --> 01:45:56,780
I also, yeah, maybe we should probably rush it.

2841
01:45:56,780 --> 01:45:59,300
I also, the last time I went to the store,

2842
01:45:59,300 --> 01:46:01,060
in order to film the exterior shots,

2843
01:46:01,060 --> 01:46:03,460
so I could do my new comp of the,

2844
01:46:03,460 --> 01:46:05,980
my 4K comp of the shuttle taking off.

2845
01:46:07,140 --> 01:46:08,140
The last time I went to the fries,

2846
01:46:08,140 --> 01:46:10,140
they were not playing this video.

2847
01:46:10,140 --> 01:46:12,040
So I could be up against the issue

2848
01:46:12,040 --> 01:46:13,300
of they don't do it anymore.

2849
01:46:13,300 --> 01:46:14,140
Yeah.

2850
01:46:14,140 --> 01:46:14,980
That's true.

2851
01:46:14,980 --> 01:46:15,820
Yes.

2852
01:46:15,820 --> 01:46:18,140
And again, I'm really worried about who this guy is.

2853
01:46:18,140 --> 01:46:19,620
Who was in it to begin with?

2854
01:46:19,620 --> 01:46:20,460
Right.

2855
01:46:20,460 --> 01:46:22,340
Who was in the heir to the Fry's fortune?

2856
01:46:22,340 --> 01:46:24,620
You would take it just being played once,

2857
01:46:24,620 --> 01:46:25,460
and then back to the regular person.

2858
01:46:25,460 --> 01:46:26,300
Absolutely.

2859
01:46:26,300 --> 01:46:27,140
Oh my God.

2860
01:46:27,140 --> 01:46:28,700
If we could say a time,

2861
01:46:28,700 --> 01:46:31,260
and all of my friends and family and listeners

2862
01:46:31,260 --> 01:46:34,180
are going to come and watch,

2863
01:46:34,180 --> 01:46:35,700
the pride that I would feel.

2864
01:46:35,700 --> 01:46:36,780
A pilgrimage.

2865
01:46:36,780 --> 01:46:37,620
Yeah.

2866
01:46:37,620 --> 01:46:38,540
To the Fry's Anaheim.

2867
01:46:38,540 --> 01:46:39,820
Right next to Disneyland.

2868
01:46:39,820 --> 01:46:41,740
Then everybody goes there after.

2869
01:46:41,740 --> 01:46:42,580
Right.

2870
01:46:42,580 --> 01:46:43,620
It's the best day we ever had.

2871
01:46:43,620 --> 01:46:46,140
And then we recreate a video,

2872
01:46:46,140 --> 01:46:47,700
a Disney ride video,

2873
01:46:47,700 --> 01:46:50,220
and see if we can sneak it on something.

2874
01:46:50,980 --> 01:46:51,820
Sure.

2875
01:46:51,820 --> 01:46:52,660
Yeah.

2876
01:46:52,660 --> 01:46:53,480
Well, that's that's step.

2877
01:46:53,480 --> 01:46:54,320
Yeah.

2878
01:46:54,320 --> 01:46:55,160
If we can get this one working.

2879
01:46:55,160 --> 01:46:56,420
We've met a few ride operators.

2880
01:46:56,420 --> 01:46:57,580
I wonder if anyone's like, you know,

2881
01:46:57,580 --> 01:46:58,900
there's just a VCR drive.

2882
01:46:58,900 --> 01:47:00,140
If I put it in there,

2883
01:47:00,140 --> 01:47:02,420
I could kind of switch a wire.

2884
01:47:02,420 --> 01:47:03,260
It's us.

2885
01:47:03,260 --> 01:47:05,900
We say one of us is saying high speed roller coaster type

2886
01:47:05,900 --> 01:47:06,740
ride in the dark.

2887
01:47:06,740 --> 01:47:07,740
No one notices.

2888
01:47:07,740 --> 01:47:08,740
Oh hell yeah.

2889
01:47:08,740 --> 01:47:09,940
I mean, that's good.

2890
01:47:09,940 --> 01:47:10,780
Wait a minute.

2891
01:47:10,780 --> 01:47:11,820
This video is too crisp.

2892
01:47:13,620 --> 01:47:16,580
This hasn't been played the 10,000 times.

2893
01:47:16,580 --> 01:47:17,580
Yeah.

2894
01:47:17,580 --> 01:47:19,220
Lost color as it's gone.

2895
01:47:20,100 --> 01:47:20,940
Okay.

2896
01:47:20,940 --> 01:47:23,100
So that look, that's my fries journey.

2897
01:47:23,100 --> 01:47:26,860
So now clearly fries two needs to happen.

2898
01:47:26,860 --> 01:47:27,700
Yes.

2899
01:47:27,700 --> 01:47:29,460
Because I need to begin this saga.

2900
01:47:29,460 --> 01:47:32,100
I need to see if I can successfully get this thing played

2901
01:47:32,100 --> 01:47:33,060
or if I don't.

2902
01:47:33,060 --> 01:47:33,900
Right.

2903
01:47:33,900 --> 01:47:36,780
You know, hopefully things go the way that we want it to.

2904
01:47:36,780 --> 01:47:38,500
Hopefully the stores don't close.

2905
01:47:38,500 --> 01:47:41,460
And in a perfect world,

2906
01:47:41,460 --> 01:47:46,100
we'll see you at the launch of fries launch,

2907
01:47:46,100 --> 01:47:49,140
fries Anaheim launch mission two.

2908
01:47:50,060 --> 01:47:50,900
Starring Scott Gardner.

2909
01:47:50,900 --> 01:47:51,740
Wow.

2910
01:47:51,740 --> 01:47:55,140
I can't imagine what would get in the way of this happening.

2911
01:47:55,140 --> 01:47:57,100
I can't wait to see you there.

2912
01:47:57,100 --> 01:48:00,620
Hopefully before the summer, hopefully it's in 2020.

2913
01:48:00,620 --> 01:48:02,220
This is a good goal to set for the year.

2914
01:48:02,220 --> 01:48:03,060
Yeah.

2915
01:48:03,060 --> 01:48:03,900
Sure.

2916
01:48:03,900 --> 01:48:04,740
Yeah.

2917
01:48:04,740 --> 01:48:05,580
Huh.

2918
01:48:05,580 --> 01:48:06,900
Yeah.

2919
01:48:06,900 --> 01:48:09,100
Figure out your carpools now.

2920
01:48:09,100 --> 01:48:10,580
Who are you going to ride with?

2921
01:48:10,580 --> 01:48:11,940
The store's going to be packed.

2922
01:48:11,940 --> 01:48:12,780
It's going to be, you know.

2923
01:48:12,780 --> 01:48:15,380
We have most people in a fries in 20 years.

2924
01:48:15,380 --> 01:48:16,620
In all of them.

2925
01:48:16,620 --> 01:48:18,980
By the way, that's the hardest thing to do.

2926
01:48:19,820 --> 01:48:20,660
I know.

2927
01:48:20,660 --> 01:48:21,980
I think 10 people would do it.

2928
01:48:21,980 --> 01:48:23,340
So we'll see you.

2929
01:48:23,340 --> 01:48:24,980
You survived podcast, the ride.

2930
01:48:24,980 --> 01:48:27,660
Thanks guys for walking down fries.

2931
01:48:27,660 --> 01:48:28,500
That's great.

2932
01:48:28,500 --> 01:48:30,220
Empty memory lanes.

2933
01:48:30,220 --> 01:48:32,500
There was too much in this episode, honestly.

2934
01:48:32,500 --> 01:48:34,500
It could, this could have been split in and of itself,

2935
01:48:34,500 --> 01:48:36,820
but now as I said, you guys help with my journey.

2936
01:48:36,820 --> 01:48:38,860
Go say nice things on the Twitter.

2937
01:48:38,860 --> 01:48:42,060
Let's get fries talking and see you at the launch.

2938
01:48:42,060 --> 01:48:43,180
Yeah.

2939
01:48:43,180 --> 01:48:44,980
Three, two, one.
