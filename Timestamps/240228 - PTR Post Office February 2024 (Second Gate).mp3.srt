1
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:05,200
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:26,940
Hey, welcome to the PTR post office, the first all Patreon edition.

3
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:28,280
We're doing it fully on here.

4
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:29,180
That makes sense.

5
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,240
That guy, the last time we did this, we asked like,

6
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,380
where do you want us to do social media stuff?

7
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:38,180
Clearly no one could decide if they're doing blue sky or threads or nothing at all.

8
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:44,680
But the one thing that was loud and clear is that it makes sense for you guys here on Patreon to ask these questions and to do it here.

9
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,880
So thank you for making that loud and clear.

10
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:51,620
And also, this is actually a PTR post office.

11
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,920
There are no, I don't have suspicious surprises around the corner this time.

12
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:01,220
Unless you count the big octopus that's coming in right now.

13
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:05,100
Whoa, it's the 20,000 leads under the sea big octopus.

14
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,960
You did it, you bought it and you hit it all these years.

15
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:08,540
That's right.

16
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:15,280
Here, bring him in and he's gonna, Jason, he's gonna take you to task for pronouncing moho pork wrong.

17
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:18,820
So, all right, let's settle in for the next 40 minutes of that.

18
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,460
And no, that's not, no, we're, it's real.

19
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:22,860
It's questions.

20
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:24,620
Yeah, we're doing it.

21
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:27,040
I'm a little bit shaky here.

22
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,660
I'm just saying.

23
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,760
Of this nature.

24
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,120
I'm a little bit on edge.

25
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:32,440
I didn't sleep last night.

26
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,240
I don't know if it's happened yet.

27
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:44,800
I'll just say this in this one instead of the other that I text, I forget if the audience has heard this episode or not, but I just had a really nice Disneyland visit or California adventure visit with my family.

28
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,640
And especially enjoyed going on the red car trolley.

29
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,840
And right after I texted you guys, hey, I'd like to order up a red car trolley episode.

30
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,180
Yeah.

31
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:55,140
And Aaron was like, they're going to think you're up to some shit.

32
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,880
Oh yeah, that is a good point.

33
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:00,560
They're gonna be like, why are you all of a sudden asking for red car trolley?

34
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,780
You have pretty glowing things to say about it.

35
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,060
I did, yes.

36
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,580
And I think you'd know I'd be a little peeved.

37
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,800
You're like, I like the trolley.

38
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,220
I have a lot on the trolley.

39
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,380
Yeah, I gotta be careful.

40
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,860
You know, it's gotta be like an impartial party.

41
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:27,660
Because I remember when I used a lot of the Spider-Man episode to show a clip of Mike on Mansers and you were like, after 15 minutes, you were like, I should note this is my favorite ride of all time.

42
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:29,780
I'm like, no, no, no, we'll do it.

43
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:30,320
We'll do it.

44
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:34,340
I forgot about, I truly had forgotten about that.

45
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,960
But yeah, that sounds like me.

46
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,560
Stay away from everybody's.

47
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,240
No nonsense on everybody's area.

48
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:47,000
And I won't interrupt what the listeners, what the audience wants to know at this point in time.

49
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,900
Do we got anything loaded up?

50
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,300
Oh, question wise?

51
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,560
Top question waiting on Jason.

52
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,260
You were all like, I got my screenshots.

53
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:55,540
There's a lot of good questions.

54
00:02:55,780 --> 00:03:01,020
I got my screenshots and I had a pinned note, but I was gonna drink a sip of water.

55
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:02,320
All right, here.

56
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:02,960
Put it down.

57
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,940
Don't prioritize water over audience.

58
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:09,160
I'll give her the priority because I had it ready to go last time.

59
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,200
Marnie Shore.

60
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,080
Oh, hey.

61
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,160
You know, right.

62
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:19,160
Marnie Shore asked, would love to hear your thoughts on the rising trend of Instagram trap experiences.

63
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:26,880
Museum of Ice Cream, WNDR Museum, Color Factory, et cetera.

64
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:28,300
What do you guys?

65
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:31,560
Well, I don't know anything in that list, to be honest.

66
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:35,020
Instagram trap experiences, she said.

67
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,480
All are like pop-up photo, like background places.

68
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:44,860
Disney had the one in the old ESPN zone for a while.

69
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:56,800
You know, the original, the location of the original Disney store in the Glendale Galleria, not far from us, turned into like an Instagram museum for a little bit,

70
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:01,980
which I think I thought about letting my kiddo run around for a while, but those are, it depends.

71
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,700
Boy, they'll price those things.

72
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:07,200
They'll gouge you on those on these on the Instagram traps.

73
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,140
That's for sure.

74
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:21,100
There is one in the Burbank Mall that it's like it's so I don't know what the price get in is, but it is like the size of like it may have been a former Claire's.

75
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:27,940
Like if you can imagine how compact Claire's are and I can't imagine Claire's at Burbank Mall closing.

76
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,360
There must still be a Claire.

77
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,660
But I'm using that.

78
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:31,400
Just a Claire shape, you're saying.

79
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:35,320
Yeah, it is like that compact.

80
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:39,720
Like they could barely fit the big pair of lips or whatever in there.

81
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:46,960
I went to something I accidentally stumbled into something that might qualify as this also with my son.

82
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:54,500
There's kind of a charming not not Claire, but Montclair, a town not far from here, as a little.

83
00:04:54,500 --> 00:05:01,300
They've got this swing space that was built out of a former Costco that is now all of these little temporary exhibits.

84
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:07,620
There's a dinosaur thing that's why we went and that satisfied a dinosaur loving toddler.

85
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:15,080
But right next to it, we weren't even planning on going to something called Bubble World that looks completely like dumb Instagram trap.

86
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,920
And I was I was avoiding my son even seeing this like I don't want to pay for this.

87
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,740
This seems annoying.

88
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:25,360
And then he kept like bubbles, bubbles and like, all right, fine, let's do it.

89
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:31,540
But I, dude, I think you're going to be kind of a frady cat and not want to do anything because I've seen billboards for this.

90
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:35,740
This is like a big ball pit, essentially, but maybe a little more art directed.

91
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:39,140
So I'm going to pay so much money for you to do nothing.

92
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:41,200
And then he proved me wrong.

93
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,860
He went apeshit in bubble world.

94
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,200
It was one of the best father son times.

95
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:57,600
I guess, you know, there were parts of it that were kind of like little insta traps were like here being a bathtub full of rubber duckies with like 100 rubber duckies and that stuff, whatever.

96
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:06,020
But a gigantic ball pit for families to go in that like looks where you feel like you're in a CD rom from 1992.

97
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,700
It like brought something out of him.

98
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,700
He was much crazier than usual.

99
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:11,080
Really?

100
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,680
That's just diving it.

101
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,580
I had to stop him.

102
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:14,860
We don't know what's in there.

103
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:18,960
Don't just dive in to the bubbles without we know nothing.

104
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,260
I don't think you're allowed to dive.

105
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,120
We just didn't.

106
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,540
Something took him over.

107
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:22,960
Yeah.

108
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,500
So I will.

109
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:28,000
I'll say nice things about bubble world if I'm getting the name right.

110
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,720
But do you guys have experience with anything of that nature?

111
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:32,860
Yeah.

112
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:37,560
Lindsay had a rap party for Infinity Train or whatever.

113
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,300
A premiere party.

114
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:38,640
I don't know.

115
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:44,760
I remember there was some sort of party at a very Instagrammable place on Melrose or maybe La Brea, somewhere around there.

116
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:51,760
That was like kind of a fruit based Instagrammable plate, like a photo app.

117
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:57,740
And I am like a sucker for just like a room with some weird music and mirrors.

118
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:04,380
Like if you put some mirrors and lights in a room and you walk around like, oh yeah, I'm good.

119
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:08,360
Like I'm not saying like, oh, this is my favorite thing ever.

120
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,740
But I kind of think I'm easy when it comes to some of this stuff.

121
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:16,720
Now, this was a party, so I didn't pay like $50 to get into it.

122
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,680
And maybe that would influence me more.

123
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:19,980
But I don't know.

124
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,580
I mean, taking a picture in front of a big thing I like.

125
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:27,220
And that's kind of the premise or bigger unusual thing I should say.

126
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:34,460
I'm catching up on what Marnie sent because I have not heard of WNDR Museum because we're not in a city that has one.

127
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:38,200
Chicago, San Diego, Boston looks like the Boston one.

128
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:40,880
Here's a bunch of orbs in a mirror room.

129
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,000
So you're happy, Mike, with that?

130
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:43,540
No, it's good.

131
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:43,840
I'm good.

132
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:51,700
And I think like money wise, yeah, if it's like $75 to take a photo in the mirror room, I'm like, I don't necessarily need to do that.

133
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:56,940
But more more nonsense is always good, I feel, don't you think?

134
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:05,960
And it's nice to in a world where with dead malls and where we're losing space, like doing something with it and doing something that is an experience.

135
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:09,320
I mean, I'm sure you're going to get good ones and bad ones.

136
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:20,740
But I certainly like physical experiences still existing and filling the like incredible amounts of void that we have for various reasons in the 2020s.

137
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:28,680
I think that's that's what I could say is like, well, at least it's helping struggling malls stay afloat.

138
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:42,180
Like, I think even one of the ones like Concord Mall, which I grew up going to in Wilmington, Delaware, which seems to be doing pretty well.

139
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:48,180
Got some press a while back because that is where the perfectly preserved Burger King is.

140
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:57,220
If you remember that, like someone like who worked there, like when in it backstage or broken or something.

141
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:04,320
And it was just storage, but it was a perfectly preserved like Burger King from the 90s.

142
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:04,840
Oh, wow.

143
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:09,280
And I was like, man, that looks like the Burger King that I remember going to with the Concord Mall.

144
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:13,540
And then it turned out to be the Burger King I grew up going to at the Concord Mall.

145
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:14,680
Yours was the one.

146
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:15,600
Yeah, the one.

147
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:16,060
Yeah.

148
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:21,660
I was like, I think I saw Toy Story and then to eat lunch at that mall.

149
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,280
Wow.

150
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:22,760
Wow.

151
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,900
At that Burger King.

152
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:28,580
But even they, I think it opened some of these Instagram things.

153
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:32,640
I think it's so funny to me when they are referred to as museums.

154
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:39,740
But yeah, they're probably not for me, but like they're actively not for me.

155
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,780
They are for younger people.

156
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:44,600
I bet some people would be, some of these would be for you.

157
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,060
Some of them might be for me.

158
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,000
Let's just brainstorm real quick.

159
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:53,840
What would a Jason Sheridan go to if he saw, like if it was like Cookie World or something.

160
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:59,200
And there were big cookies and you could like kind of go in there and it's like you're the mouse from if you give a mouse a cookie or something.

161
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:05,900
I would say when that Museum of Ice Cream one opened, I was like, I didn't see anyone actually eating ice cream.

162
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,180
I feel it's just like.

163
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:10,100
Well, that's a good plus for your version of this.

164
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,240
Oh, different ice cream.

165
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,340
Jason's Museum of Ice Cream is what we should do.

166
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:18,300
Dreyer's has one room, Breyer's has another room, Blue Bonnet gets one.

167
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,720
Oh, so it's a corporate kind of thing.

168
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,560
It's a sponsored.

169
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,440
Well, I think they ought to band together.

170
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:24,340
Okay, so it's for the common good.

171
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:25,100
For the common good.

172
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,100
The general theme of ice cream.

173
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,320
Yeah, Ben and Jerry's.

174
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,560
So it sounds like actually you just want to open up a big ice cream store.

175
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:38,880
Yeah, I guess I could just go to the aisle of my local supermarket and get what I'm looking for.

176
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,520
Because I'm picturing like I'm picturing the photo op.

177
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:46,060
It's you and the big waffle cone with the sprinkles on the side and the frosting.

178
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:51,040
But what you're picturing is just a bunch of ice cream brands opening up little stores in rooms.

179
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:54,200
Yeah, little taste like little tasting in each room.

180
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:59,680
Because like what the big ice cream cone with sprinkles like is that just dirty plastic?

181
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:00,300
Yeah.

182
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:06,340
I'm watching a bunch of I'm watching people at Museum of Ice Cream, which was that ever in L.

183
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:06,880
A.?

184
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,580
It's currently New York, Chicago, Austin, Singapore, Miami.

185
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:11,900
I feel like I saw somebody go there.

186
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:14,780
I feel like there was one a few years ago.

187
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,500
Maybe it's gone here now.

188
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:19,140
But I'm watching people slide into like a big pit of sprinkles.

189
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:21,260
But you want edible sprinkles.

190
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,420
Yeah, I want edible sprinkles.

191
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:25,420
No other riff raff coming in there.

192
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:27,720
Like you buy an hour, you get the hour.

193
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:31,100
Those are fresh sprinkles that only you can consume.

194
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:38,100
It sounds what you want is a strip mall full of different ice cream brands having their own stores and all the stores are free.

195
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,040
Well, even just root like little.

196
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,380
Yeah, it can be samples.

197
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,540
It doesn't have to be full.

198
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:48,420
I mean, I also in the brief sizzle reel I'm watching, I do think that people are eating ice cream.

199
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,180
Oh, that's good.

200
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,400
I don't think that you may have been judging off of several photos that you saw.

201
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,840
I think it'd be bizarre if there was a museum of ice cream in which you didn't eat.

202
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,920
I'm also seeing the word unlimited.

203
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:04,520
So let's not judge this ice cream museum until in New York, Chicago or Singapore.

204
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:05,880
Jason, get to Singapore.

205
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,680
I do want to go.

206
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:17,940
I will take a lot of I would like to hit it's there for a few more months that this is more of an art exhibit.

207
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:28,820
But that Luna Luna Park that Drake bought, which is like a simulation of a theme park, but it's like all rides designed by like Keith Haring did one.

208
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,320
Basquiat did another.

209
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:34,980
Yes, and it was all like it was in storage for a long time and just so kind of preserved.

210
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:35,900
It is interesting.

211
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:40,780
But I think unless I'm wrong, you can't go on these rides.

212
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,600
You can't go on the rides.

213
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,640
No, they think they want the urgency.

214
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,840
Little delicate.

215
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:47,920
No, I want to break it.

216
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,020
I want to break the Basquiat coaster.

217
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:51,180
Yeah.

218
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,420
Would you rather do that, Scott?

219
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:53,600
Or would you not go?

220
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,960
Sea rides you can't go on.

221
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,280
Or would you rather ride a big ice cream cone like a horse?

222
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:04,540
Because you can get on the big plastic ice cream cone like a horse in my version.

223
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,300
Yeah, I think I'm I think I'm after that.

224
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:10,540
And after my fun ball pit experience, I'm a doer, not a watcher.

225
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,200
Right.

226
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:11,760
Yeah.

227
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:12,200
Yeah.

228
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,720
Oh, and and the shackle.

229
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,700
We you were you were going wild on that.

230
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:19,980
I sure was.

231
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:20,920
Yeah, Shacktoberfest.

232
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:21,600
Shacktoberfest.

233
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:22,140
Excuse me.

234
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:27,580
Though that is what Aaron was exclusively calling it Shackleween, as as was I around the house as well.

235
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:29,220
That sounds different Alexandria.

236
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,200
It is.

237
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,720
It's a it's a fun.

238
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:34,540
It's a fun, purposeful mispronunciation.

239
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:35,020
Yeah.

240
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:35,500
Thank you.

241
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,000
Hmm.

242
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,100
What else we got here?

243
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,840
Yeah, let me do this.

244
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,900
Let's see here.

245
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:52,380
JJ Sigler asked if you could build your dream park using five lands and areas from any theme park in the world, which five would you choose and why?

246
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,860
So this is something I've been thinking about for years.

247
00:13:55,160 --> 00:14:04,440
I don't know that I'm going to work out some of my math on the air, but this is fun to sort of like choose your own like pieces for your own theme park.

248
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,620
So I think I'm starting.

249
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:11,960
I don't want to steal some of what you would pick, but I have to start with Marvel Superhero Island from Islands of Adventure.

250
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:12,420
Sure.

251
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,520
That's my number one.

252
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,020
Would you agree that's your number one?

253
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,600
I think that's my number one, too.

254
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,060
OK.

255
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:17,880
Is there anything?

256
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,180
Maybe we could do this all together.

257
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:20,600
Like, is there would you say Port of Entry?

258
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,760
There's no fucking way that's going in mine.

259
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,420
But go ahead.

260
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:24,480
OK, fair enough.

261
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:30,760
Like, I know you guys like the Marvel you grew up with, but where we talk with one of the best five lands on Earth.

262
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,860
Not what the question was.

263
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:32,460
Yeah, you're right.

264
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:32,940
It's yours.

265
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:33,800
It's our personal.

266
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,200
Well, that's why it's not going to mine.

267
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:36,600
Yeah, so that's OK.

268
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,620
But no, I'm not putting that awful port of entry in mine.

269
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,180
I just want to make sure that's clear.

270
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:47,420
Whether I was going to pick Port of Entry or Hollywood Boulevard from Hollywood Studios.

271
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:48,040
OK.

272
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:50,220
Because I like the Golden Age of Hollywood.

273
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:55,840
To my my way of thinking that the mashup element is more fun.

274
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:59,720
So I don't want to even put Port of Entry there just because it's too much like Islands.

275
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,240
And because you hate it.

276
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,540
And because I hate it.

277
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,000
It's a vile place.

278
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,920
But are you having to lagoon?

279
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:10,020
This is too much Islands of Adventure.

280
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:14,260
And then, you know, I think we're just going to go with Seuss Landing and then maybe Harry Potter.

281
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:16,420
We don't talk about Seuss Landing that much.

282
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,700
I'm picking Epcot.

283
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,000
I'm picking the opening of Future World with the Spaceship Earth as the opening.

284
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,080
Oh, OK.

285
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:24,660
Yeah.

286
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,120
And then right next to it is World Celebration.

287
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,320
No, not in ours.

288
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:30,540
No, mine is just the intros.

289
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:35,960
Mine is just just the turnstiles or whatever they call them now and the spaceship Earth.

290
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:38,020
That's the whatever that garden is.

291
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:39,560
And do they still have the names?

292
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,140
The names have been moved, right?

293
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:42,120
They moved names.

294
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:44,200
Did they ever reset them up?

295
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:44,800
I don't know.

296
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,980
They said they were going to make a…

297
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,740
It doesn't matter to this exercise, I don't think.

298
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:52,060
But then, yeah, you turn left and you hit Marvel Superhero Island.

299
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,860
Damn, that's pretty good.

300
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:54,880
That's fun.

301
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:55,860
Yeah.

302
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,400
And then I'm going to probably have to pick…

303
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:04,060
I'm trying to think, because I do really like Cars Land.

304
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,520
I'm a big Cars Land fan.

305
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:07,300
Yeah.

306
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,220
So I think that's a that's a very viable top five.

307
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:13,660
I'm putting Cars Land in there for sure.

308
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,060
I don't think Toon Lagoon is making it.

309
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:18,460
Wow.

310
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,700
You know, I love Toon Lagoon.

311
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:29,440
There's definitely be like, there'll definitely be like some sort of Dagwood presence in this new park, but not his own land, sadly.

312
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:30,020
OK.

313
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:34,420
But so t-shirts, merchandise, parades, perhaps.

314
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,880
He'll be around.

315
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,060
Dagwood on the move.

316
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,120
Dagwood will be around.

317
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,560
Marmaduke will be around.

318
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,140
Funky Winker Bean also around.

319
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,600
And then I'm trying to think.

320
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:50,020
I want to do like a thing that I liked as a kid,

321
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:56,660
which I want to just put the full Sandwich Village I grew up in, grew up with in this new park.

322
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,800
So this is one of the lands.

323
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,200
It's just full Sandwich Village.

324
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,720
None of the rides have been upgraded.

325
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,260
Yeah.

326
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:08,940
Like the best they had was like a coaster that is probably it's probably like a little bit bigger than Gadget's Go coaster.

327
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:11,060
In my mind, it's it's insane.

328
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:12,920
I never went on it because I was too afraid.

329
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,820
And then we stopped going there after I was probably 13 or something.

330
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:16,880
So I never got brave.

331
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,620
If it's still there, I should go.

332
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:21,020
I should when I go back, I should go on it.

333
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,660
So I'm putting all of Santa's Village into this park.

334
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,180
As a land.

335
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,080
That's really good.

336
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:32,140
And it's got an ice skating rink next to it called the Polar Dome, which I also will.

337
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:37,320
That's also going in there, which was falling apart 30 years ago.

338
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:42,240
And then at this point, what do you got left?

339
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,920
I don't want to put mine down.

340
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,600
I can't even keep mine straight in my head.

341
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:46,540
It's all lands.

342
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,600
That's the exercise here.

343
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:52,500
So like I'd love to just take Velocicoaster, but I don't necessarily need that Jurassic Park land.

344
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:56,060
Yeah, I don't care about that so much.

345
00:17:56,060 --> 00:18:01,620
Can you go in and can you trade in and out or just it's Velocicoaster its own thing and you don't have the rest?

346
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,380
Yeah, I probably I mean, we can for the fun of it.

347
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:09,700
It seems like I should I should follow sort of what the prompt was.

348
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,640
Can would you would it be OK?

349
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:18,900
You think it would be OK, though, if I took just a Gudetama part of Pearl land and put it.

350
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,700
That's a small room like it's kind of a big room.

351
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:24,940
You mean like the where you wait for the show?

352
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:25,640
No, good.

353
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,280
So Gudetama has his own.

354
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,600
I don't know if it was.

355
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,620
Oh, no, you went after me.

356
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:31,160
Gudetama is the lazy egg.

357
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:31,580
Yeah.

358
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:35,860
But he has a whole room with like a bunch of activities and a lot of pictures of his body.

359
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:36,280
Oh, wait.

360
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:36,760
Yeah.

361
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:37,000
Yeah.

362
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:37,180
Wait.

363
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:37,980
That's like a kitchen.

364
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:38,520
Right.

365
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:38,860
Yes.

366
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:39,500
OK.

367
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,000
Yes.

368
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,020
That is a lot of fun.

369
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:49,260
Yeah, there's another this is in this is not in a full Gudetama area, but I do have strong memories of peering down his asshole.

370
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:50,020
Yes.

371
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:53,000
And there was a video screen in the airplane cartoons.

372
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:56,520
Yes, you can watch cartoons through Gudetama's asshole.

373
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,440
And it's delightful.

374
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,220
I just bought two Gudetama toys at Target.

375
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:01,420
Yes.

376
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,040
Are too little like a plush.

377
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,700
How do you can you pull Pure Land entirely as if you go into one enough?

378
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:10,920
I think you could just throw Pearl in there.

379
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:11,200
Yeah.

380
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:11,960
And that would be good.

381
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:21,540
And then, yeah, then I would love to take something from Disney Sea and I'm trying to figure out what part of it that's my I think my I think I'm taking the island.

382
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:23,340
I'm taking a mysterious island right.

383
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,160
Yeah.

384
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:24,960
The volcano.

385
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:29,280
That is you know, and the attractions inside that's centerpiece.

386
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,040
Right.

387
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:36,220
I think I might have to I'm just I'm just out of between their tomorrow land and Discovery Land.

388
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:38,100
But you know what I don't like any of those right now.

389
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,120
Yeah, I want to know.

390
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,220
I want Tony Solaroni.

391
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,000
I want.

392
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:43,400
Yeah.

393
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,860
I want Tokyo's tomorrow land.

394
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:45,580
I'll take that.

395
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,920
Maybe I would take Paris's Main Street.

396
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:51,680
I might steal cars from you if we're allowed to double up.

397
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:52,460
Future World.

398
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,120
That's this is getting greedy.

399
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,200
I want Future World with Spaceship Earth.

400
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:00,880
And then I get past that and get to Tokyo volcano.

401
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,480
That's all in one park.

402
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:03,060
OK.

403
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,660
And all of Sanrio Puroland.

404
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,620
And we have a couple.

405
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,120
So we all have overlap so far.

406
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:08,780
I think so.

407
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:09,940
I think I have one more.

408
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:12,480
Maybe I just put World Showcase in as well.

409
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,600
Does that count?

410
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,700
Or do you have to be?

411
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,440
You have to pick a pavilion.

412
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:19,160
No, I think it's a land though.

413
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:20,180
Don't you think?

414
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:21,260
It's big.

415
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:24,260
I think there's no reason that there were no caps.

416
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:24,700
You're right.

417
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,540
So why not?

418
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:26,180
There were no caps.

419
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,960
So I have the first part of Epcot, just Spaceship Earth.

420
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:29,980
That's the entrance.

421
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:31,240
Then I have Marvel.

422
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,380
You're saying you're not taking.

423
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,140
But you're not taking.

424
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:33,480
Are you?

425
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:34,060
Can you?

426
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:35,160
I don't need any of the other rides or anything.

427
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:35,920
I don't even need Guardians.

428
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,920
You're not even taking Guardians?

429
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:37,200
No.

430
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,120
That's close enough, though.

431
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:38,880
Why don't you just grab that?

432
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,160
Eh.

433
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:39,980
Grab it.

434
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:41,460
I insist.

435
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,140
All right.

436
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:42,860
I'll take Guardians.

437
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:44,020
Put Guardians in your super park.

438
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,000
Guardians in the super park.

439
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,040
I'm putting it in mine.

440
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:46,720
You know what?

441
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,040
You're right.

442
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:47,900
Because it's a perfect.

443
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,340
It leads into Marvel Superhero Island then.

444
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:50,840
Yeah.

445
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,880
So it's a good transition there.

446
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:53,260
Sure.

447
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:53,680
Oh, yeah.

448
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:59,280
And then I think Cars Land is kind of goes next over there.

449
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:03,420
And we'll figure out how to transition that thematically.

450
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:05,260
I could take you to World Showcase though, potentially.

451
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:05,940
And then.

452
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,640
I could come out of Canada or.

453
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,040
World Showcase in Pearl Land.

454
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:10,740
Mexico.

455
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:12,020
You're getting Southwest-y.

456
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:12,400
And then.

457
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:12,760
And Santa's Village.

458
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:13,620
Did I take too much?

459
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:14,900
I think that's fine.

460
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:15,320
I don't know.

461
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:16,720
I wasn't keeping track of a five.

462
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:17,700
Jason, do you have?

463
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:17,700
Whatever.

464
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:17,860
Jason, what have you got?

465
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:18,380
OK.

466
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:23,100
I am going with trying to do.

467
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,700
I'm the spirit of the mashup, as Mike said.

468
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:32,800
You know, so I'll take the entry of Hollywood Studios, MGM Studios, Hollywood Boulevard.

469
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,200
So I'll take that.

470
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,040
You go left.

471
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:36,600
You hit.

472
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:39,020
I'm also taking Marvel Superhero Island.

473
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:39,580
Sure.

474
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:40,240
You go right.

475
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,520
You hit Pandora.

476
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:41,860
Great.

477
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:42,440
Oh, yeah.

478
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:42,840
That's good.

479
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:43,620
So that's three.

480
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:44,020
Right.

481
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:44,980
That's three lands.

482
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:46,900
OK.

483
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,960
Going around, curving around.

484
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,520
I'm going to say the Magic Kingdom Tomorrowland.

485
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:53,200
Great.

486
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,820
Mostly for vibes.

487
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:55,160
Yeah.

488
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,100
And people move her.

489
00:21:56,520 --> 00:22:02,680
And then I'm going to go back in time and resurrect the Hanna-Barbera land from King's Dominion.

490
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:03,560
Oh, OK.

491
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:07,120
So because in this fantasy, I can go home again.

492
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:09,380
I can return to Yogi's Cave.

493
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:10,880
Yogi's Cave.

494
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:11,140
Yeah.

495
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:11,840
Your home.

496
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:12,600
Your home.

497
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:15,320
Anytime you close your eyes is Yogi's Cave.

498
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:16,180
Yeah, that's right.

499
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,840
It was kind of dark in there, you know.

500
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:22,600
When you close your eyes at night, you're back in Yogi's Cave.

501
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:23,520
Yeah.

502
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,480
You dream of Yogi's Cave.

503
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,280
That's beautiful.

504
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,040
Boy, that's that's that's kind of nice to do.

505
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,280
I think these are some super perks.

506
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:35,920
I'm also like I'm kind of thinking about like taking that like even I don't know why you'd need to do that.

507
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:42,060
Now, I kind of like lower lot the lower lot Universal Hollywood that I grew up with,

508
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,440
and I want to take the star way to get to it.

509
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,860
So most of my whichever four, I don't know.

510
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:52,010
I don't want to if I narrowed it down, then the fifth is you have to for no reason take lots of escalators

511
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:55,380
down to the BT Adventure in the original tram tour.

512
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:56,680
That's not Jurassic Park.

513
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:57,500
The ride yet.

514
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,560
I don't want Jurassic Park.

515
00:22:59,600 --> 00:22:59,820
The ride.

516
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:03,540
I want Lucy a tribute and I want AT&T at the movies.

517
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:04,300
Now we're talking.

518
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,180
Or there's a big phone that I stand in.

519
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:10,500
I think all of us need at least one pick that's like, you know, is that the best?

520
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:10,760
No.

521
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,520
But did I did I grow up with it?

522
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:12,860
Right.

523
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:18,120
I guess I could get rid of Spaceship Earth and replace it with the Wizard of Oz walkthrough with the MGM Grand.

524
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:19,160
Oh, that's not bad.

525
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:20,320
That's interesting.

526
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:21,660
Oh, Pulse and Casino.

527
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:26,080
Or like I want a New York, New York roller coaster.

528
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:26,900
Oh, yeah.

529
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:29,200
Or at least just the New York, New York Hotel.

530
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:29,780
Oh, you know what?

531
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:30,520
Let's do this.

532
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,420
What hotel?

533
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:34,900
Pisteo Hotel somewhere for your new resort.

534
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:37,900
Boardwalk.

535
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,060
You're doing boardwalk.

536
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:39,380
OK.

537
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:40,020
Yeah.

538
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:40,600
Yeah.

539
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:45,440
Do I want contemporary or do I want swan and or dolphin?

540
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,200
I can't I can't split them up.

541
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,240
It's like splitting up siblings in a in a litter.

542
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:51,200
Oh, yeah.

543
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:53,020
The contemporary.

544
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,960
Yeah, that's yeah, that would have been my number two.

545
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:56,340
Yeah.

546
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,060
Yeah.

547
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:58,320
I don't know.

548
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,780
It's probably a Disney hotel.

549
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:01,000
Probably Polynesian.

550
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:11,240
I could say like I could say like, I don't know, the Luxor when it opened or something, but like new Luxor.

551
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,040
Yeah, maybe.

552
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,440
But I didn't get to go when I was younger.

553
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:18,380
So not the one with like the adult playground arcade that's coming to it.

554
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:21,520
Oh, that's coming to the I think there's like, what does that mean?

555
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:23,240
Does it like an Instagram?

556
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:27,480
Yeah, like a David Buster's, but maybe a ball pit kind of.

557
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,540
It's adult just because I got it.

558
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:29,900
It's not like, yeah, yeah.

559
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,340
Or anything.

560
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:35,600
Yeah, it's it's aimed at older millennials who grew up with Discovery Zone and Chuck E.

561
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:35,800
Cheese.

562
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:39,060
But then also want to drink a White Claw when you do it.

563
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:39,740
That's who I am.

564
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,240
That's me.

565
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:41,140
That's who you are.

566
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,100
A lot of arcades going in.

567
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:46,400
I feel like really spaces in the casino.

568
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,600
Should we go back to Vegas for this?

569
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,080
Maybe.

570
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:50,640
What a big event it is.

571
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:51,980
It sounds like they have White Claws.

572
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,100
We got a White Claws.

573
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:59,540
Well, there's also the massive mini golf that is coming to Mandalay Bay, I think.

574
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:00,280
I don't know about that.

575
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:04,480
It's like multi stories with like restaurants and bars and stuff.

576
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,100
Now you're sweetening the pot here.

577
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,200
When is the Universal thing?

578
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:10,500
The Maze's?

579
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,020
When is that stuff open?

580
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:14,200
I don't know if there's a timeline.

581
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,640
That could fuel a return.

582
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:16,940
Yeah, that's a good idea.

583
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:17,400
Yeah.

584
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:18,820
Here's one.

585
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:24,540
Jeremy Ayala, would you all ever consider doing a theme park pizza final four?

586
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:26,260
That's interesting.

587
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,880
And I'm like and then somebody says like, well, yeah, the hot dog Hall of Baloo.

588
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:33,140
But for but for pizza, pizza, pandemonium.

589
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:37,060
I that's interesting.

590
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:47,340
And what I'm what I'm doing in my head is like is so you know, you guys shout that if there's an obvious answer that I'm missing,

591
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,680
shout it at me.

592
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:51,780
Theme park pizza can be a rough area.

593
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:52,860
Am I wrong?

594
00:25:53,440 --> 00:26:02,960
I am not I don't immediately think of a pizza that I'm salivating over in a theme park as opposed to just like in a city in a real place.

595
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:08,880
You know, the one in Epcot is it's all it's pretty I don't like any amount of that tone.

596
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,280
That's nowhere close to it.

597
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:10,980
It's not.

598
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:16,300
But it's like at least like wood fired and adds some flavor to it.

599
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,420
It's not my favorite.

600
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:22,660
The one at downtown Disney is is all right as well.

601
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,500
But is that a theme park?

602
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:27,760
I think we got to go in theme parks.

603
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:33,020
I think that's the only thing that comes to mind where I go, oh, I would like to have that flatbread pizza I had again.

604
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:38,780
Not that I crave it like I crave other pizza, but that's the best thing I can think of off the top of my head.

605
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:39,360
Good.

606
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:46,560
I feel I feel like there is like theme parks do this thing or this thing kind of with a little novelty and there's something to it.

607
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:53,340
But like theme park pizza always feels like expensive and disappointing for something that should be a given.

608
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:59,480
And yeah, can you even listeners are probably yelling one that like, no, this one is good.

609
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,440
The big pizza riso.

610
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:00,980
I don't know.

611
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:03,660
We didn't do it last time, but I bet it's not.

612
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:09,080
Well, that's more that's more incendiary than what I said about Port of Entry, I think.

613
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,500
I don't know that.

614
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:11,380
I don't know.

615
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,200
I suspect I don't know if that is.

616
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:18,980
I think some of the pizza riso argument has been that the theming is better than we or other people have given credit for.

617
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:22,780
Are there are there are there a lot of people saying that the pizza is great?

618
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:23,920
I actually I don't know.

619
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:24,600
And I haven't had it.

620
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,300
So I don't know.

621
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:30,340
Well, I'll go for the theming, but I haven't eaten the pizza.

622
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:31,880
Yeah, I don't know.

623
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:38,800
I'm not sure if the big argument for pizza riso other than just it's good is that does the good mean the pizza or does the good just mean the vibes?

624
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,380
I think it's gotten work.

625
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:49,620
Mama Melrose in Hollywood Studios has I always like the pizza there that felt like actual cooked wood fire pizza.

626
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:58,160
I occasionally find myself in the mood for Fantastic Four Cafe or the Universal Studios Florida.

627
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:02,840
You know how you're like, oh, I just want kind of like cafeteria pizza.

628
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:06,360
You know, I want no, I don't feel that way.

629
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:12,320
I will sometimes like you don't do the pizza dominoes little Caesars like do what?

630
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:13,320
Do I don't know.

631
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:17,820
I'll do like a meat cheese or say, you know, I just shared a bar.

632
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:21,180
It was a big old slice with my son on the same trip I was talking about.

633
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:22,080
And that was pretty satisfying.

634
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:28,540
But, you know, like Greasey kind of like New York or mall style cafeteria.

635
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,180
You're doing nothing for me.

636
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:31,380
I think more pizza.

637
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:33,040
That's the better example.

638
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:35,520
Not cafeteria, but mall pizza, borrow.

639
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:43,460
That's the perfect example where you're like, I kind of want to borrow like and that's what you get at like Fantastic Four Cafe.

640
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:45,700
You get a good pizza in Vegas.

641
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:49,120
I feel like sometimes like there's the one place that you know, it's not good.

642
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:51,660
And you're you're charged twice what you should be.

643
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:52,020
Oh, yeah.

644
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:54,300
But you're kind of not paying attention at that point.

645
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,300
You just need something.

646
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:59,460
So New York, New York, you get a good slice at the end of the night or something.

647
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:00,480
Is there one there?

648
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:01,120
Yeah.

649
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:01,740
Yeah.

650
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,580
There's that secret pizza at the Cosmopolitan.

651
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,220
You got to go down back hallways.

652
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:07,260
I don't know about that.

653
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,240
There's record labels on the walls.

654
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,080
I don't know anything about that.

655
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:10,720
Have you done that?

656
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:12,480
No.

657
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,560
But I've had it recommended to me by a couple of people.

658
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:16,420
Secret.

659
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,580
I like the idea of it.

660
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,460
We would have to just go do some work.

661
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:26,780
I would I would be it's not like the most exciting idea for me to go eat all the pizza at Disneyland or something.

662
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:33,200
You look at good pizza at Disneyland and you don't include the outside pizza place.

663
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,020
I'm here.

664
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:35,240
I'm looking at a list right now.

665
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:36,020
What am I even going to land?

666
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,280
Do you even have one in your head?

667
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:38,100
What is pizza?

668
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:40,780
Well, there used to be a pizza press across the street.

669
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:45,780
Fosley, the lovely Anaheim Hotel, Anaheim Hotel.

670
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:47,280
It doesn't doesn't count.

671
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:49,100
Red Rose Tavern has pizza.

672
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,540
I've never heard of it before.

673
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:51,920
Picture doesn't look good.

674
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,480
Boardwalk pizza and pasta.

675
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:55,880
Maybe I've had that.

676
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:56,720
Maybe that's fine.

677
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:58,280
Maybe I've had a pizza there.

678
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:05,940
I write I pose this to listeners like convince me that theme park pizza isn't a merely fine to bad area.

679
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:09,860
I like I like I like theme park food.

680
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:12,920
I'll definitely like theme park food, but it's I can't think of any.

681
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:16,480
And then like your run of the mill theme park, you know, your six flags or whatever.

682
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:19,140
I feel like pizza is garbage across the board.

683
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:24,960
Yeah, I for whatever reason it does, I don't order pizza a lot at a theme park.

684
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:30,860
And I do think maybe it's it's a even an unconscious thought that most of the pizza is bad.

685
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:33,420
This is one of the shortest listicles I've ever seen.

686
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:34,940
Yeah, there's three entries.

687
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:37,780
I would rather I also think a lot of the I know this has gotten better,

688
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:42,360
but like even like a hamburger or a cheeseburger generally bad at the quick service.

689
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:47,980
So I'm more apt to even order a bad hot dog than I am a bad hamburger.

690
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:49,200
I think you're safer.

691
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:50,660
Yeah, I agree.

692
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:51,300
I'm with you.

693
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:51,680
I don't know.

694
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,200
I got more flavorful.

695
00:30:53,640 --> 00:31:00,700
Yeah, I mean, like there's once in a while you get something, you know, the did they bring back the fried green tomato sandwich at the hungry bear?

696
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:01,660
I feel like they did.

697
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,980
They did at some point.

698
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:03,960
I don't know if it's still.

699
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:04,300
Yeah.

700
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,940
And like I guess I got a cheeseburger there once and you're just like, that's fine.

701
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:13,600
It's just not I don't understand why some of the food at a theme park isn't as good as like Pizza Hut.

702
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:15,500
It's not good in the trash.

703
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:16,440
Yeah, exactly.

704
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:24,580
I love Pizza Hut when it's it's like it's like I guess warmest, but also it's like saltiest.

705
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:26,340
Yeah, you get a good Pizza Hut.

706
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:26,920
You go.

707
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:29,960
I can tell this is destroying my body, but it's delicious.

708
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:37,960
I don't understand why you don't go in like Tomorrowland to the quick service and like the hamburger at least tastes like a Big Mac,

709
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:42,460
which is they figured out scientists have figured out the way to make a Big Mac,

710
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:50,620
the cheapest possible thing they can buy to give you to make your brain at least get fooled into thinking you're eating something pretty good.

711
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:57,560
I don't understand why the technology doesn't exist for them to at least do that and fool me in the way that fast food fools me.

712
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:58,440
Yeah, I don't know.

713
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:00,800
Yeah, it's it should be better more often.

714
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,140
That's right.

715
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:04,500
Well, I'm sorry if this was a negative answer, but I was a bad answer.

716
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:04,760
I'm sorry.

717
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:05,240
I don't know.

718
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,620
Theme park pizza is a weird.

719
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,160
But I'd like to be corrected on this.

720
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,200
Please somebody shine a light.

721
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,260
Maybe there's a good read.

722
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:16,080
I could see that somebody's like, you know, a Kenny Wood or Hershey Parker, something like the oddly has a really good pizza place.

723
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,360
But I don't know.

724
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:20,260
I'm going to read this one while I'm looking at it.

725
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:28,440
Brian Wright, if you could choose any current television show to do a filmed on location Disney World episode, i.

726
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:28,520
e.

727
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,220
the full house.

728
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:29,960
Disney episodes.

729
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:33,760
What show would it be and what escapades with the characters get into?

730
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,220
And I have my answer ready to go.

731
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:37,020
Shark Tank.

732
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:38,880
It is Shark Tank, ABC.

733
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:46,440
I never really mentally crossed Shark Tank over with the parks until I heard Damon did the candlelight vigil.

734
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:47,000
Oh, yeah.

735
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:53,080
And now you're probably you might be thinking Shark Tank is a reality show that can't well not this episode.

736
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:53,560
It's not.

737
00:32:54,020 --> 00:33:02,520
I am going to write an hour long, no negotiations, no pitches episode that is just Shark Tank goes on a Disney World vacation.

738
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:14,260
And just like all the it's just you piece them off into their own little adventure and then bring them back together for a nice firework show where they all reflect on what good friends they are and how much money they have.

739
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:16,860
I need jerks.

740
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:21,520
I would love to see Kevin do the Indiana Jones spectacular.

741
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,320
Just have to do every bit of it.

742
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,480
And he misses the spikes.

743
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,640
They always killed a lot of time that way.

744
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:38,640
Barbara is a little horned up and so she like her, her being with like Gaston being like a like a beef cake would be good for her.

745
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:47,360
I don't have any other if you guys I'll think if you guys have other answers, but I at least I was ready to go.

746
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,980
Well, feel free to pitch your own shows.

747
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:49,640
ABC show.

748
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,420
ABC is not given.

749
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,680
It's just what I thought of.

750
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:55,120
And it's the main they do say current.

751
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:59,480
It's the main current show that I gasp when there's a new one.

752
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,340
Oh, we got a new Shark Tank.

753
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,360
I really like whatever his name is.

754
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:07,160
I apologize.

755
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:10,440
I forget his name, but the guy who is in charge of kind bar.

756
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:15,240
I think he should be a perma shark when Mark Cuban leaves.

757
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:20,000
So I'd like to see kind bar guy get in a like, I don't know.

758
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:22,260
Is there a problem you could solve with kind bars?

759
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:25,440
Is anyone hungry or hangry?

760
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,000
Oh, right.

761
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:31,300
In a ride somewhere like he gives, you know, he goes on the Jungle Cruise and there's a lion roaring.

762
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:35,480
And if you think you're going to get attacked, but then he gives him a kind bar and that's good.

763
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:36,940
That ends the conflict.

764
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:37,360
Right.

765
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,120
That's perfect.

766
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,560
Yeah, I was going to say like, I guess it's but it's canceled.

767
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:41,580
Young Sheldon.

768
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,680
I don't think you and Sheldon went to Disney or anything.

769
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:45,360
CBS.

770
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,060
No.

771
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:46,480
Yeah.

772
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:49,740
But again, I, you know, pick your dream theme park.

773
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:53,640
I say pick whatever does not have to be in the Disney brand and maybe shouldn't be.

774
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:56,600
Yeah, he could have gone to Six Flags over Texas.

775
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:58,840
Yeah, but this is Disney World specifically.

776
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:00,260
Oh, Disney World specifically.

777
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:03,520
You're saying it could have been an episode there.

778
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:06,440
Yeah, because I think their show takes place in Texas.

779
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,100
I don't know.

780
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:11,680
All I know is it comes on sometimes and I go every actor that's ever lived is on this show.

781
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:13,240
Oh, every actor.

782
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,620
And Bigly Jr.

783
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,840
and Annie Potts.

784
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:16,580
Yeah, Wally Sean.

785
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:20,120
Long stretches where Young Sheldon doesn't appear and it's about the adults.

786
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:22,740
And I was like, should I start watching Young Sheldon?

787
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:23,320
Reba?

788
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,860
Maybe Young Sheldon is good.

789
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:25,580
I don't know.

790
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,540
But like all these actors I like are on there.

791
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:28,900
I haven't done it yet.

792
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:31,340
I'm just saying that once in a while I go, what is this show?

793
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:35,950
Now, now after it's been canceled, after it's over, you binge Young Sheldon.

794
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:39,880
Really quick, Robert Herjavec is kind of the outdoor sports guy.

795
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:40,680
He's like the skier.

796
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,080
You get him to Blizzard Beach.

797
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:45,020
You get him having fun with the Gator and whatever.

798
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:45,320
Right.

799
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:45,660
Right.

800
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,020
Something fun happens.

801
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,300
Strap a GoPro to him.

802
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,700
But any other TV shows you want to send to Disney World?

803
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:50,720
Sure.

804
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,900
The TV show I am fully caught up on, Reacher.

805
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:59,360
Reacher is either helping someone or he's hiding out at Disney World.

806
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:00,880
Remind me what Reacher is.

807
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:02,480
Jack Reacher series.

808
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:03,140
Yeah.

809
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:08,560
So Jack Reacher, yeah, he is a former military police officer.

810
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:21,080
And when he got discharged, of course, for doing the right thing, but going against orders, he now takes, he just wanders the country.

811
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:29,140
And he always, he only has a toothbrush on him and he'll just buy a new set of clothes and throw out the clothes he's wearing.

812
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:41,440
The newest season he gets back together because people are starting to kill his old, the 110th military police members are starting to die.

813
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:44,620
And ones are trying to reach out to each other for help.

814
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,020
So what's he doing in Disney World?

815
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:52,520
Well, he hitchhikes around the country and takes buses and trains just all around the country.

816
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:57,720
So he could just be going to see what it is or he could be helping.

817
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:04,260
Usually he helps solve a mystery or help solve a problem in a small town or something.

818
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:13,720
But sometimes he needs to hide out with his new whatever friends he makes along the way, you know, so he could just be hiding because it's hard.

819
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:20,720
It's like finding a needle in a haystack in those 40 square miles or whatever it is, you know.

820
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:23,720
Does he find love at all in the show?

821
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,500
Oh, Reacher gets laid all the time.

822
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:27,220
He does.

823
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:28,080
So much.

824
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:35,780
I've read like six or eight of the books and he's got a new parmore every, because it's like everyone knows, everyone knows the score.

825
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,860
Reacher's not going to stick.

826
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,620
It's just a fling, you know.

827
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:42,200
That's one of those strong Jasonisms parmore.

828
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,880
He's got a new flavor.

829
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:45,880
That's insane.

830
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:47,920
You need to, you've got to get an A in there.

831
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,200
That one's not a regional one.

832
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:52,600
Do you think Reacher could go to Jelly Rolls on the boardwalk?

833
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:53,880
Oh, Reacher would love it.

834
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,020
And find a new parmore.

835
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:56,860
If he could get some blues playing.

836
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:59,040
He loves blues and clown and rock.

837
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:00,440
Is it parmore permanently for us now too?

838
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,440
I guess, yeah.

839
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:02,180
Is it?

840
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:02,480
How is it?

841
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:02,680
It feels weird.

842
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,100
I don't know.

843
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:03,520
It's like I'm saying the word.

844
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:05,540
Mickey Mouse and his parmore mini.

845
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:12,780
Yeah, so Reacher at Jelly Rolls singing along to Don't Stop Believing or something.

846
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,840
Does he have to like blend in?

847
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,960
Does he have to pretend to be a piano guy?

848
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:17,500
Like, all right, you're up bud.

849
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:18,320
Oh, shoot.

850
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,180
And then he magically is really good.

851
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:21,420
Is he good at stuff sometimes?

852
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:22,260
I mean, he's always good at stuff.

853
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:23,940
Oh, Reacher's good at so much.

854
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:27,280
But has he pulled out like a skill like piano playing out of the blue?

855
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:33,460
Well, his mother is French, so he can probably speak French in the French Pavilion and wow.

856
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:35,160
OK, that's good.

857
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,940
That would be a good scene or two.

858
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:42,180
And then he can just beat the shit out of like rowdy, you know, rowdy guests.

859
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:46,040
You know, the whole show is him beating up other parkgoers.

860
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:46,640
Yeah.

861
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:50,940
Oh, he beats up all the bad guys, you know.

862
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:51,160
Yeah.

863
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:55,260
So I think bad guys have the infiltrator, the parkgoers, just like beating up annoying people.

864
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,500
Yeah, Jafar, guest on.

865
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:00,620
Well, he usually doesn't start a fight, but he certainly finishes.

866
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:02,280
Has he beat up a lion yet?

867
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,340
He beats up Robert Patrick.

868
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:06,000
Is it Robert Patrick?

869
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:07,820
From The X-Files?

870
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,580
Yeah, from The Terminator and The X-Files.

871
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,480
His most famous role.

872
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:13,280
Replacing David Duchovny.

873
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:13,620
Sure.

874
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:15,120
He was on Peacemaker.

875
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:16,420
Yeah, that's it.

876
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:16,740
Oh, yeah.

877
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:17,640
So he got beat up.

878
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:18,700
He's an older man.

879
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:19,340
He is an older man.

880
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:21,580
Why is Reacher beating up like a 70 year old man?

881
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:25,300
Oh, well, I don't want to give away what happens.

882
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,480
No Reacher spoilers.

883
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,300
He's a tough guy.

884
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,140
I like Robert Patrick.

885
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:28,540
I'm just saying.

886
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:32,080
By the way, can also just I'm sorry, I want to close it out.

887
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:34,320
Mark, I think you want to get him.

888
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:37,860
Mark Cuban goes into Pandora and you just just paint him blue.

889
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:38,960
Figure out a reason.

890
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:45,400
We'll figure out the reason, but just like make him like, you know, like, like, boy, I got to wash this stuff off.

891
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:48,620
And then I now it was thinking about villains.

892
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,640
Let's get Damon in.

893
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:54,560
Damon is doing is Mickey in Phantasmag.

894
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,960
He shoots fireworks out of his fingers.

895
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,860
What about my imagination?

896
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:03,740
I thought of Fubu.

897
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:06,080
Anyway, just want to make sure I'm covering.

898
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,900
No, I think you might really have a holding out.

899
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:11,400
Well, but I don't have a why am I forgetting her name?

900
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:12,320
QVC.

901
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:13,160
Laurie.

902
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:14,600
I got nothing for Laurie.

903
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:15,940
I'll try by the end of the episode.

904
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:25,180
It's funny because I haven't watched any real shows in so long that to make it current, like I'm trying to think we're like we're halfway through and are.

905
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:25,740
Mm hmm.

906
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:28,760
So that's that's still already but still in the air.

907
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,580
There's another season coming.

908
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:30,920
So technically it is current.

909
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,100
You're going to send and or to Disney World.

910
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,060
I'm going to send him to Disney World.

911
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:38,260
I'm going to send him to the first part there in Batu, but then they break out of Batu.

912
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:42,320
It's just like kind of a bottle episode and they end up in just Hollywood.

913
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,400
So now they have to figure out where they are.

914
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:46,740
They have to get back home.

915
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:50,520
OK, and then and or has to do.

916
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:53,100
Cashin has to do the Indiana Jones stunt show.

917
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:53,460
Great.

918
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,440
That should be part of.

919
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,200
Yeah, I'm going to give that to Richard to.

920
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:56,520
Yeah.

921
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:57,260
Yeah.

922
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,980
That's not even a question.

923
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:00,420
Yeah.

924
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:00,680
Yeah.

925
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:08,860
So they like they end up on Slinky Dog and stuff and like you portray like Slinky Dog as if he's sort of just like the giant like worm thing.

926
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:12,220
The Millennium Falcon is like sitting in an empire or something.

927
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,220
So you have to portray some of these things as if they're kind of alien.

928
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:16,460
But it's tongue in cheek.

929
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,080
You know, you know, it's wink, wink, wink.

930
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:19,340
It's a fun bottle episode.

931
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,900
It's a little bit of a departure from the normal tone of the show.

932
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:24,160
But yeah, you use everything.

933
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:29,200
Tower of Terror is very is sort of like maybe the big climax of.

934
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:30,300
No, you know, I take that back.

935
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:33,320
Rock and Roller Coaster is a big climax of it.

936
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:39,440
And they have to like jump to light speed and they have to find a vehicle that goes fast enough to go to light speed.

937
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:40,980
And Aerosmith's limo does it.

938
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:41,540
And the closest.

939
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:43,660
Yeah, that's the best thing they can not start tours.

940
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:49,540
Aerosmith's limo is the thing that can finally take them back to Batuu and back to their own universe.

941
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:50,020
Yeah.

942
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:56,060
And then they like see that they also see the pre-show of Aerosmith and they're confused because they're like, who are these aliens?

943
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,700
They look stranger than the aliens in our world.

944
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:01,340
The one in the way just the way.

945
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:03,160
Our galaxy has no one this cool.

946
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:03,600
Yeah.

947
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:06,360
Well, of course, they're very impressed with how cool they are.

948
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,760
These men in their mid fifties.

949
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:11,660
This transcends all time and language and culture.

950
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:16,920
And what yeah, what happens too is that they're so impressed by the garments they're wearing and the scarves and whatever.

951
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:22,540
And like the silk and the silk and just Joe Perry's whole aesthetic that they all start dressing like them.

952
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,660
So that carries through for the rest of that show.

953
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:27,320
The Endor characters all get glammed out.

954
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:29,760
Yeah, like late nineties Joe Perry.

955
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:30,380
Yeah.

956
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,880
So that's just like they never have to talk about it again.

957
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,060
But now they all have clothes like that.

958
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:40,180
They go and fashion their clothes that going forward to look more like late nineties Aerosmith.

959
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,400
And it's a fun.

960
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:50,000
It's just a fun episode, you know, because that's a that's much heavier show, I would say, than Mandalorian or the other shows.

961
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,600
Yeah, so I think this this will be a nice, nice little break.

962
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:58,920
And of course, synergy and it'll be because the Batuu is there.

963
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:01,760
They can shoot it there and it already looks like some Star Wars.

964
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:03,700
So I think it's some trouble.

965
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:04,240
That's good.

966
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:07,400
I think the opening scenes really quick.

967
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:13,160
Maybe Laurie proposes that Sunny Eclipse record an album and and tells him that he'll show.

968
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:17,200
She promises to blow it up on QVC that there's she takes him under.

969
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:21,160
But you know, they negotiate a decent rate, you know, 15 percent for three hundred thousand or whatever.

970
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:22,160
OK.

971
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,360
Oh, my God, I did them all.

972
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:24,600
That could be.

973
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:26,140
I feel like yours is the most viable.

974
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:27,500
I mean, clearly it is.

975
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:32,820
But it also maybe I could see it being like maybe a 20 minute version of what you're saying for like a promo.

976
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:34,280
Yeah, yeah.

977
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:36,200
I do think they aren't good actors, though.

978
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:38,820
They've tried things where they like that's why I need to get involved.

979
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:45,580
I can direct I can broaden because in another in a movie that I otherwise genuinely loved, Good Burger 2.

980
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:46,120
Oh, yeah.

981
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:46,940
I can watch Good Burger.

982
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:48,580
I really liked Good Burger 2.

983
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:49,240
I'm not kidding.

984
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:52,100
I think there are there are like huge laughs in it.

985
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:53,900
I put it on like, what's this crap?

986
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:54,740
I'll make fun of this.

987
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:56,740
By the end, I'm like, I love it.

988
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:59,700
I'm laughing more than I have in any comedy in a long time.

989
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:04,500
But one of the things that was throwing me at the beginning was Mark Cuban as a cameo and he's not good.

990
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:09,420
I was so disappointed because I want to see Mark Cuban acting and doing high jinks so badly.

991
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:14,540
He was one of the things that sunk it and then it had to claw its way back, which it did do.

992
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:15,440
You know what?

993
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:18,800
The revelation of that movie, Kel, Kel is funny.

994
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:20,340
He remains funny.

995
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:22,300
He really brings it.

996
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:24,760
That's you know, like bringing the old buddy back.

997
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:25,860
Kel is very good.

998
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:27,660
I didn't grow up with it.

999
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:31,940
I found I only I only watched it and liked it for the first time a couple of years ago.

1000
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:33,300
It was kind of caught off guard.

1001
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:33,820
How much I liked it.

1002
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:35,800
That's a real endorsement though, because you didn't grow up with it.

1003
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:37,140
It's not blind nostalgia.

1004
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:41,140
No, if anything, I didn't I don't even like a lot of all that stuff.

1005
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:44,280
I always found it kind of like random wacky at the time.

1006
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:47,100
Yeah, but I like honestly Good Burger 2.

1007
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:53,700
Whoever I think was maybe the writers of the original, besides the people who should not be in playing society anymore.

1008
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:55,220
There's some new people too.

1009
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:55,700
Yeah.

1010
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:56,200
Yeah.

1011
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:57,580
Newer actors are good in it.

1012
00:44:57,580 --> 00:44:59,920
Yeah, that's there's Scott's movie.

1013
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:01,160
I do want to watch it.

1014
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:01,980
I am.

1015
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:07,520
Kel has cameoed on SNL a couple of times and always like nails his line.

1016
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:08,780
Like he's always funny.

1017
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:09,660
He's good.

1018
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:11,500
I mean, that's and I agree that's good.

1019
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:15,520
But I was like, are we going to see the cracks if he has to carry a movie?

1020
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:16,640
No, no, no.

1021
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:17,800
Kel was great.

1022
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:19,640
Kel brought it.

1023
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:20,540
Big Good Burger 2.

1024
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:22,100
I'm happy to say on Mike.

1025
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:23,380
All right.

1026
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:29,220
Let's I don't have one that I've been staring at exactly.

1027
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:33,640
Yeah, I there's a couple different ones that are asking about my music taste.

1028
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:38,620
So I guess I could pick a specific like a more of a me focused like grab bag.

1029
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:40,560
Let me let me combine all this.

1030
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:44,100
This will be a quick and we don't need to go around unless it's unless we want to.

1031
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:47,340
Somebody asked is it both a Swifty and a Clifford?

1032
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:51,700
Knowing that I saw the heiress tour has this person wondering how hard it was to get tickets.

1033
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:53,380
How much checking did I have to do?

1034
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:54,840
What did I think of the concert?

1035
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:56,620
What is your favorite Taylor Swift album?

1036
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:57,920
This is Julie.

1037
00:45:58,100 --> 00:45:59,220
Julie wrote this.

1038
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:00,920
I did no checking.

1039
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,720
My sister checked and got these and I was even just family.

1040
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:05,820
You all have the gift.

1041
00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:07,380
We all have the all of the force.

1042
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:08,120
We all.

1043
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:08,700
Yes.

1044
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:11,060
Our father is for it.

1045
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:13,320
No, my father could give a shit about checking.

1046
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:18,020
Both parents do and don't have the patience for something like this.

1047
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:24,880
Although my mom met this man, he doesn't he doesn't seem like a guy who would want a lot of like immediate toy deals from Target.

1048
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:29,880
But no, my mom was my mom called to see if she could get me on the Bozo show,

1049
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:33,560
which is how the way that you used to do it when they would give out free tickets, but didn't do it.

1050
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:36,320
And in hindsight, I went, I bet she could have checked.

1051
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:37,640
I bet she could have called harder.

1052
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:39,160
That was the origin story.

1053
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:40,460
Yeah, I bet she could.

1054
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:42,880
Because at the time you're like, well, she called like, what are you going to do?

1055
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,600
But then like, oh, well, I'm like, there's got to be a way.

1056
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:47,680
And then you said the problem is technology hasn't caught up.

1057
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:49,480
Phones block each other.

1058
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:51,400
They were, you know, lines busy.

1059
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:52,660
So your call gets rejected.

1060
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:55,860
We need a technology that makes endless checking possible.

1061
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:56,240
Yeah.

1062
00:46:56,300 --> 00:47:00,200
And you were an original funder of the of the early Internet and of the smartphone.

1063
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:00,820
Exactly.

1064
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:03,980
Yeah, I knew what the potential was for this type of technology.

1065
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:07,580
It's incredible you do this podcast, even though you have seven billion dollars.

1066
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:12,760
Yes, I should be on Shark Tank, not this podcast.

1067
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:15,840
You are the Winklevoss triplet.

1068
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:18,860
You are the secret third Winklevoss swim.

1069
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:20,500
Yeah.

1070
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:23,440
So, so Taylor, so my sister was like, oh, do you want to go?

1071
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:27,500
Because she, I don't get the tickets for my dad and her to go.

1072
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:29,660
And then I was like, yeah, I would like to go.

1073
00:47:29,820 --> 00:47:34,380
And I really, I was kind of ignorant to all the whole like culture that had developed at these shows.

1074
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:34,680
Yeah.

1075
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:36,680
So I kind of was going in blind.

1076
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:38,640
I did not realize it was four hours.

1077
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:40,720
It was so long.

1078
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:44,280
And it was at SoFi Stadium and what it was, nine nights or something.

1079
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:48,180
And Heim opened, which I'm a bigger Heim fan than I am Taylor Swift fan.

1080
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:49,540
You got me into them.

1081
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:50,780
I, I, yeah, yeah.

1082
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:51,760
I think they're right.

1083
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,200
I'm a big, big fan of them.

1084
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:56,220
And but I do like a lot of Taylor Swift.

1085
00:47:57,060 --> 00:47:59,120
So I had a fantastic time.

1086
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:00,520
We were just talking about this a couple of days ago.

1087
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:01,780
So you guys are hearing this again.

1088
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:04,780
It's not only do I just, I like a lot of songs,

1089
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:10,560
but also being anywhere where, where somebody's at like the height feeling of their like cultural relevance.

1090
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:11,940
There's an excitement.

1091
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:14,040
And especially when teenage girls are involved,

1092
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:18,520
there's a like a vibration that is happening in a group of this many people.

1093
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:19,580
Interesting.

1094
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:21,820
Just normal stuff to say.

1095
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:26,260
Well, but you know, like the Beatles, how excited the room is.

1096
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:27,120
There's an energy.

1097
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:31,340
If you've pieced what I'm saying out of context, yeah, you could arrest me.

1098
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:32,000
That's fine.

1099
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,780
If you pulled out just that there's an excitement when teenage girls are involved.

1100
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:36,840
But Mike Carlson.

1101
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:37,280
Yeah.

1102
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:39,800
But I was like, oh, this is important.

1103
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:41,140
What I'm at is important.

1104
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:43,480
This is an important moment in American history.

1105
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:47,420
So it was like it was it was like exciting in that way.

1106
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:49,400
But yeah, it's also very themed.

1107
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:50,540
It's a theme park show.

1108
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:51,400
It's great.

1109
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:53,060
Like she jumped into the production.

1110
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:54,300
I don't know, like the set.

1111
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:58,500
There's a lot of different sets, obviously, for the different eras, for the different albums.

1112
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:01,380
And like they build a house and she's in the house or whatever.

1113
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:06,600
And then there's a part where she the stage turns into water and then she jumps into a hole in the stage

1114
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:10,080
and they have like a video screen for swimming like down the stage.

1115
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:14,720
The whole thing is very full of little theme park tricks.

1116
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:20,540
Sounds like a great, great material that would fill the sphere.

1117
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:22,320
No, she's too big.

1118
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:24,860
She's like she would never know.

1119
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:28,820
Do not do not do not put the chains of sphere on Taylor.

1120
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:30,540
The twenty thousand people, please.

1121
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:31,280
She'd have to pay.

1122
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:37,100
She'd have to play a year straight every day to to to meet the demand of that show.

1123
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:38,680
And it would be nice.

1124
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:39,980
You would not make the money either.

1125
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:41,740
But yeah, I it's fun.

1126
00:49:41,740 --> 00:49:42,140
It was fun.

1127
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:46,060
I I feel like a bit of a poser, though, because I should be more hardcore.

1128
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:47,400
I was upset.

1129
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:48,800
I'm only played like seven songs.

1130
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:50,180
I was like, we could have had another.

1131
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:51,300
Give me another few.

1132
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:52,740
They're playing so far.

1133
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:53,920
That was fun to see them play.

1134
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:56,360
But you but you know, hey, you just give us some opinion.

1135
00:49:56,380 --> 00:49:57,440
I don't think you're a pose.

1136
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:58,080
I don't.

1137
00:49:58,380 --> 00:50:01,280
Should you be deeper into Taylor Swift than that?

1138
00:50:01,820 --> 00:50:02,380
I don't.

1139
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:05,900
Do you think because it's like a girl thing, a teenage girl thing?

1140
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:09,560
I mean, she's not that's Olivia Rodrigo is 20.

1141
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:10,960
This was about 35.

1142
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:14,500
So well, it's more it doesn't have to line up with it.

1143
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:15,940
You're lining up with the age of the artist.

1144
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,480
I listen to a lot of seventy five to eighty five to dead.

1145
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:19,980
Oh, yeah.

1146
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:21,080
I'm right there with you.

1147
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:21,960
Yeah.

1148
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:22,620
Yeah.

1149
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:25,880
The closer to death, the better I say when it's music.

1150
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:27,080
Oh, yeah.

1151
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:31,660
Well, and if you're wondering, Donald Fagan at the forum pre Eagles was great.

1152
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:32,700
And what's your errors?

1153
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:33,900
What's your Fagan era?

1154
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:34,720
It's a night.

1155
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:35,660
Nightfly, baby.

1156
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:37,540
Yeah.

1157
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:38,020
Yeah.

1158
00:50:38,260 --> 00:50:38,260
Yeah.

1159
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:40,880
This is this one's interesting.

1160
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:41,620
I don't know.

1161
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:43,680
I wonder if you remember this, Jason.

1162
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:48,140
Robert Hernandez during the episode where Scott revealed the signatures that he had in a book.

1163
00:50:48,580 --> 00:50:53,960
Jason said that he had an artifact to in fact that he would reveal in 2023 timestamp.

1164
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:55,020
Twenty three minutes.

1165
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:56,180
That's strange.

1166
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:57,240
Simulation.

1167
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:59,480
Well, will we ever know what these are?

1168
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:00,940
Do you know what he's talking about?

1169
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:06,960
Well, one artifact is discussed on the upcoming city walk saga.

1170
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:07,760
Oh, that was one.

1171
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:09,160
Oh, that was one of them.

1172
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:13,280
The other artifact, I'll just say it now.

1173
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:17,760
I bought one of those imagineering coffee table books.

1174
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:19,900
There's like two volumes of it.

1175
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:27,360
And I bought it at this like you use like collectible and Nick next door in Burbank.

1176
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:30,280
There wasn't it used to have an art gallery, too.

1177
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:36,620
There was an art show I went to there once of like art inspired by the Museum of the Weird Art.

1178
00:51:36,620 --> 00:51:37,800
That was pretty cool.

1179
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:45,960
So I bought this book there and it was like twenty five dollars because the it was out of print.

1180
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:48,600
But there was a rip in the cover.

1181
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:49,840
So it was covered.

1182
00:51:49,920 --> 00:52:02,820
It was basically cover price when I got it home and I opened it up inside was a Disney imagineering inner office envelope that was signed by like 20 people.

1183
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:06,700
And I could only make out like some of the names.

1184
00:52:07,540 --> 00:52:07,540
OK.

1185
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:12,080
Like Martin Sclar's signature is very clearly says Marty Sclar.

1186
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:12,540
OK.

1187
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:14,780
But I don't know what the other ones were.

1188
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:18,780
So, yeah, I forgot all about that.

1189
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:24,880
Anyway, so I'll have to bring that in sometime and maybe you guys can help me identify some of the others.

1190
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:40,600
But someone clearly got this book or it was somebody who worked at Imagineering's and then they maybe they were a guest of someone and they just went around and got a bunch of signatures on this envelope.

1191
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:42,040
Interesting.

1192
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:46,180
Well, we'll have to I don't know that I'm going to be so good at identifying it.

1193
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:52,060
But I'm sure I might know more like, oh, that name that guy worked on such and such.

1194
00:52:52,060 --> 00:52:52,540
I see.

1195
00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:56,760
You're saying I should just identify the name that I don't even figure out the name.

1196
00:52:57,160 --> 00:53:00,820
But some most people's signatures are kind of gobbledygook.

1197
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:01,680
Sure.

1198
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:02,760
Interesting.

1199
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:03,420
All right.

1200
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:04,080
Well, that's good.

1201
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:05,040
Here's another Jason one.

1202
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:05,380
I don't know.

1203
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:06,160
What does this refer to?

1204
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:08,740
How far along is Jason in his tap dancing journey?

1205
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:13,380
Oh, I was talking about I always want to take tap dancing classes.

1206
00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:14,340
Oh, right.

1207
00:53:15,380 --> 00:53:17,960
Yeah, I got to get some of the ocarina's infusion.

1208
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:18,940
Got to get some M.

1209
00:53:18,940 --> 00:53:19,180
S.

1210
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:19,740
injections.

1211
00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:23,100
Few things before that happens.

1212
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:25,560
Hopefully you're all the way to tap dancing.

1213
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:26,360
Yeah.

1214
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:28,500
And then maybe I'll look into it more.

1215
00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:30,120
Yeah, it's interesting.

1216
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:37,040
I get I'm trying to think of that was even I guess dance classes, especially at the time when you're like a little boy.

1217
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:39,060
It's like I don't take dance classes or whatever.

1218
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:41,220
Although I was in a dance show in high school.

1219
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:44,180
I've talked about this before, so I never thought about taking tap.

1220
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:48,880
But I guess I wasn't as enamored with like singing in the rain until I was older.

1221
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:50,680
Yeah, you were a singing in the rain.

1222
00:53:51,100 --> 00:53:52,120
I was singing in the rain kid.

1223
00:53:52,120 --> 00:54:02,060
Yeah, because, yeah, I saw it on the great movie ride and then I went to blockbuster or movies and rented it.

1224
00:54:02,060 --> 00:54:05,520
You remember the cow video store movie?

1225
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:06,460
No, I don't remember that.

1226
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:12,340
I think it got bought by video update at some point, the much less exciting named video update.

1227
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:15,700
I'm going to say this one because I thought of the answer and it's fast.

1228
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:20,400
Julian Key, what were your favorite anecdotes from the Sumner Redstone book Unscripted?

1229
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:23,540
I read it but a little while ago, so I don't remember a ton of it.

1230
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:25,700
I was very deep in, but it's all kind of faded away.

1231
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:27,060
There's a lot of names to keep track of.

1232
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:35,040
But I do remember that Sumner had a 90th birthday that was huge and all his Hollywood friends are there and everybody had to come kiss the ring.

1233
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:36,660
And Tom Cruise and everybody.

1234
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:41,340
It might have been at that Bel Air, the Herb Albert Jazz Club.

1235
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:48,080
And then he tried to do the same thing for his 91st and people didn't feel like they owed him as much.

1236
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:51,480
And his health had severely declined and his mood had severely declined.

1237
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:56,080
So it's just him and all of his weird like nurse girlfriends and everybody who was like vying for the money.

1238
00:54:56,080 --> 00:55:04,160
And I think Tony Bennett did come, but the whole week he'd been talking about Tony Bennett's working with Lady Gaga right now.

1239
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:06,260
She's a real dame, here's your cum.

1240
00:55:06,460 --> 00:55:08,480
And then Lady Gaga was not at his birthday.

1241
00:55:08,780 --> 00:55:14,220
So even though it was like, isn't there one of the there's a Simpsons where like Mr.

1242
00:55:14,420 --> 00:55:22,020
Burns has a big giant birthday and they have an an Earth and people have all spelled his name and in a satellite picture.

1243
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:23,260
And he's still really sad.

1244
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:29,300
That's what happened with Sumner that he just like still it was like anybody would be thrilled with this as a birthday.

1245
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:33,120
And then he was just like Lady Gaga didn't cum.

1246
00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:39,300
He drove away sad and cried and fought with all the nurse wives.

1247
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:40,500
Oh, God.

1248
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:42,480
That's hilarious.

1249
00:55:43,460 --> 00:55:48,300
This is this is a deceased man who I think we're allowed to to laugh at.

1250
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:49,980
Bad man.

1251
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:50,820
Bad man.

1252
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:52,920
What else we got?

1253
00:55:54,160 --> 00:56:00,300
Alex Tucker asks if you could pitch a licensed cartoon character restaurant a la Garfield Eats, what would it be?

1254
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:01,860
What would the menu items be?

1255
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:02,820
How obscure would you get?

1256
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:04,520
Could there be a King Feature Syndicate diner?

1257
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:06,280
Of course, I mean, you know, that's true.

1258
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:12,620
But I think I think you'd want a more like mono focus on one character or one property because like King Features.

1259
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:13,200
Yeah, sure.

1260
00:56:13,940 --> 00:56:15,040
But that unlimited.

1261
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:18,700
That's too much to try to brainstorm here, I think.

1262
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:25,660
So I think, you know, it's obvious with Garfield, it would be obvious with we talked about Dagwood earlier to just do a sandwich.

1263
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:29,220
I don't really necessarily want to do like an obvious one.

1264
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:30,120
You know what I mean?

1265
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:33,340
You would want to really surprise people with the property.

1266
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:44,480
Well, I mean, if we're going by Garfield Eats rules, it should be kind of like it barely has to do with the character where it's like, hey, welcome to Ziggy Curry.

1267
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:46,120
Oh, what?

1268
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:46,760
Ziggy?

1269
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:50,080
Now this is a restaurant in my did Ziggy like Curry?

1270
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:50,780
Is that from?

1271
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:52,800
No, it's just what I look.

1272
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:55,300
I I love Ziggy growing up.

1273
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:57,020
I love two things in my life.

1274
00:56:57,020 --> 00:57:02,500
I love Ziggy and I love Donald Trump and these men inspire me to be who I am today.

1275
00:57:03,020 --> 00:57:04,720
Ziggy means everything to me.

1276
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:12,400
And you're like, why are you like bursting into what you you seem like a real mess, like just the mere thought of Ziggy makes you break down in tears.

1277
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:13,560
Don't worry about it.

1278
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:15,000
He is Curry, but he didn't have.

1279
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:15,700
I don't know.

1280
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:16,280
Shut up.

1281
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:17,200
Go to Ziggy Curry.

1282
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:19,660
Ziggy Curry closes six weeks later.

1283
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:25,520
And then and then the owner of Ziggy Curry gets weird.

1284
00:57:27,060 --> 00:57:29,040
And not fun weird either.

1285
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:32,180
Like, oh, yeah, no, that's right.

1286
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:33,620
I think Scott has made his decision.

1287
00:57:34,100 --> 00:57:34,800
Is there a precious?

1288
00:57:34,860 --> 00:57:35,420
It's fine.

1289
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:35,620
It's fine.

1290
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:35,940
It's fine.

1291
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,700
I have eat the cat eggplant.

1292
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:39,000
We have that.

1293
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,580
That's going to do just as well.

1294
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:43,440
Oh, let's let's reboot eat the cat.

1295
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:44,340
Like, let's.

1296
00:57:44,340 --> 00:57:44,560
Yeah.

1297
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:45,460
I was eat the cat.

1298
00:57:45,620 --> 00:57:46,560
Now come back.

1299
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:47,460
I'm sorry.

1300
00:57:47,460 --> 00:57:48,080
Yeah, I wonder.

1301
00:57:48,260 --> 00:57:52,300
Maybe that that that might be one of those that have been like 14 for attempts.

1302
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:56,640
They've they've had a lot of meetings about eat the cat.

1303
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:56,960
Yeah.

1304
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,460
Worth telling us at this point.

1305
00:57:58,660 --> 00:58:00,920
I was going to say like David the gnome or something.

1306
00:58:01,140 --> 00:58:02,420
David and the gnome cafe.

1307
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:04,180
It's like a tea shop.

1308
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:04,740
Yeah.

1309
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:06,760
It's mostly like tea, I think.

1310
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:07,480
Tea.

1311
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:07,960
A few of me.

1312
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:08,440
Mushrooms.

1313
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:11,500
But is it going to you want it to be as depressing as the as the show?

1314
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:11,660
Yeah.

1315
00:58:11,660 --> 00:58:12,280
The series.

1316
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:12,560
Yeah.

1317
00:58:12,580 --> 00:58:16,960
And the confusing is the show was because the show was dubbed over as a Spanish show

1318
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:18,880
bought by two men.

1319
00:58:19,540 --> 00:58:23,520
Let's call them B Weinstein and H Weinstein.

1320
00:58:24,420 --> 00:58:25,660
Oh, wow.

1321
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:27,440
And then dubbed over for American children.

1322
00:58:27,740 --> 00:58:29,500
Just getting a toe hold in the media landscape.

1323
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:32,880
Yeah.

1324
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:33,780
David gnome cafe.

1325
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,020
The gnome cafe.

1326
00:58:35,820 --> 00:58:40,520
And it serves, let's say, tea and you said mushrooms.

1327
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:41,760
Like mushrooms.

1328
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:42,720
Or mushroom tea.

1329
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:43,220
Like little.

1330
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:44,660
You're not talking about the psychedelics.

1331
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:45,920
I'm not talking about psychedelics.

1332
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:46,500
You know what?

1333
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:47,780
I am talking about the psychedelics.

1334
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:48,000
Oh, OK.

1335
00:58:48,420 --> 00:58:49,480
You can hallucinate.

1336
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:52,100
Yeah, that might put you on the same wavelength as the trippiness of the show.

1337
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:52,940
This cafe is an.

1338
00:58:52,940 --> 00:58:55,060
Hallucinate that you die and become a tree.

1339
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:56,140
It's in Amsterdam.

1340
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:57,040
OK.

1341
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:59,640
And is mushrooms legal in Amsterdam?

1342
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:02,040
Maybe.

1343
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:03,640
You're asking the wrong room, baby.

1344
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:06,920
I know you can get weed other places.

1345
00:59:07,180 --> 00:59:07,900
You can get weed.

1346
00:59:08,060 --> 00:59:08,860
Prostitution is legal.

1347
00:59:08,860 --> 00:59:12,020
The David the gnome cafe is also a brothel.

1348
00:59:12,020 --> 00:59:13,680
So you can get tea.

1349
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:17,020
You can get psychedelics and then you can.

1350
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:19,520
You can have sex with a beautiful woman in a big gnome hat.

1351
00:59:19,580 --> 00:59:23,020
A beautiful woman legally in a big gnome hat.

1352
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:24,500
You're mainly.

1353
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:29,420
This is less about like the indulgence for you and more you wanting to know that it's all legal.

1354
00:59:30,020 --> 00:59:31,560
You're worried about getting in trouble.

1355
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:34,520
I love Amsterdam because you're going to really cut loose.

1356
00:59:34,620 --> 00:59:36,100
No, because I won't get in trouble.

1357
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:37,200
Yeah, of course.

1358
00:59:37,220 --> 00:59:39,500
That's what a big thing in my life is that I will get in trouble.

1359
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:40,940
And this I won't.

1360
00:59:40,940 --> 00:59:48,460
If I open up the David the gnome brothel slash tea mushroom cafe copyrights fine hallucinates fine.

1361
00:59:48,540 --> 00:59:49,420
Prostitution is fine.

1362
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:49,920
Cool.

1363
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:50,320
Yeah.

1364
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:53,420
And there's a loose fox in there like the show.

1365
00:59:53,420 --> 00:59:54,240
Oh, just a random.

1366
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:57,580
And and wildlife rules are lax there, too.

1367
00:59:57,580 --> 00:59:57,820
Right.

1368
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:00,020
You can just have a fox wandering around in America.

1369
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:04,520
It is not legal to have a fox wandering around a cafe, but it is in Amsterdam.

1370
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:08,780
And the fox's name is Swift like it was on the show.

1371
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:10,360
Jason, what do you got?

1372
01:00:10,580 --> 01:00:11,520
Are you fitting in one more?

1373
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:11,960
One more.

1374
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:12,980
Yeah, I got.

1375
01:00:13,580 --> 01:00:14,520
Well, this is too quick.

1376
01:00:14,740 --> 01:00:14,860
OK.

1377
01:00:15,140 --> 01:00:17,480
So pick which question you like.

1378
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:18,980
I think is no.

1379
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:20,280
What a diss to the other question.

1380
01:00:20,380 --> 01:00:26,780
If you could bring back one extinct attraction from a Disney or Universal park, which would you choose and why?

1381
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:31,220
Or which area of the parks as your the best background music?

1382
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:32,880
Who said this one?

1383
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:33,500
This one was.

1384
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:35,620
Can we list both of them before we insult one of these?

1385
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:37,360
David Pavetto.

1386
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:38,480
Great.

1387
01:00:40,340 --> 01:00:46,500
Wait, it's bringing back one ride or it's what has the best loop like background background music in the park.

1388
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:52,400
What's more, I guess, bringing back a ride, although have we said that we answered this question before?

1389
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:54,460
I feel like we've answered that before.

1390
01:00:54,640 --> 01:01:00,640
I feel like my answer is usually Horizons or the original Journey into Imagination.

1391
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:01,920
Yeah, those are the answers.

1392
01:01:01,940 --> 01:01:03,180
Those are the safe answers.

1393
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:04,640
Those are the safe answers.

1394
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:12,860
The second is really safe because it's like there's not a lot they would have to do to restore Journey into Imagination.

1395
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:17,160
And there's always discussion about plussing it up and changing it.

1396
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:19,080
And, you know, that's never happening.

1397
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:26,580
The unsaid, the literally the most unsafe answer is the brief Millennium Simulator ride, which is not documented at all.

1398
01:01:26,580 --> 01:01:29,200
Journey to Jerusalem, the shaky.

1399
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:35,500
Yeah, which there was like they had to declare in the literature they declared which was the Holy Land.

1400
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:39,400
I've thought about this ride with everything going on like dear God.

1401
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:41,640
Yeah, that would be a journey to Jerusalem.

1402
01:01:42,140 --> 01:01:44,660
That would have been interesting for sure.

1403
01:01:44,820 --> 01:01:47,220
Yeah, there's no yeah, we did talk about going with it.

1404
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:49,080
Alright, Scott has answered.

1405
01:01:49,980 --> 01:01:55,860
Yeah, I it's I'm trying to think if there's even other like most things that are gone.

1406
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:58,360
I think there's a reason for it.

1407
01:01:59,080 --> 01:02:03,760
In general, I guess I shouldn't blanket say that not Horizons and not the original Journey.

1408
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:07,700
Yeah, but it would have to be a nostalgia pick.

1409
01:02:08,020 --> 01:02:12,560
And like as a kid, you know, we just talked about Toad.

1410
01:02:12,980 --> 01:02:19,140
But I mean, obviously my memory was shot and I didn't remember there were two tracks on Toad from Disney World, which is something.

1411
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:23,000
So it's not like I can say Toad because I need to experience what I did as a kid.

1412
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:26,160
We still have Toad and I think it's perfectly fine out here.

1413
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:28,880
So yeah, I guess I have to go.

1414
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:33,200
Maybe I go with like the original film Spider-Man, not the new HD version.

1415
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:35,060
You want it to go backwards?

1416
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:37,680
Yeah, it's more like what it was when I was a kid.

1417
01:02:37,700 --> 01:02:38,440
I was a teenager.

1418
01:02:39,060 --> 01:02:40,280
Yeah, it's more PlayStation.

1419
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:41,420
It looks more PlayStation.

1420
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:44,720
So your answer is worse graphics on Spider-Man.

1421
01:02:45,060 --> 01:02:46,680
Yeah, the graphics got too good, I think.

1422
01:02:46,940 --> 01:02:48,400
Yeah, voice acting is still good.

1423
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:49,140
It can still be.

1424
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:53,140
They could have plus it up to make it clear, like clearer and the 3D better.

1425
01:02:53,140 --> 01:02:56,860
But these new graphics, do we need it like that?

1426
01:02:56,860 --> 01:02:58,140
I need it to be more cartoonish.

1427
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:00,840
I think it's Spider-Man.

1428
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:01,460
That's my answer.

1429
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:06,060
I want the original film of Spider-Man that makes it more like a cartoon.

1430
01:03:06,180 --> 01:03:07,880
Yours is more easily achievable.

1431
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:09,340
Just all right, you heard them boys.

1432
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:10,820
Put the old movie back in.

1433
01:03:10,820 --> 01:03:11,940
Put the old movie back in.

1434
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:15,260
It's been eaten by rats back there.

1435
01:03:15,660 --> 01:03:18,660
Every coffee is full of rat bites.

1436
01:03:19,220 --> 01:03:19,880
I don't know.

1437
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:20,820
The guy says.

1438
01:03:20,820 --> 01:03:25,500
This guy says it on his paywall podcast, so we should do it.

1439
01:03:25,620 --> 01:03:27,920
Oh, you know what my actual answer is?

1440
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:30,160
Because nobody bothered to film it.

1441
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:35,940
I want to know what the simulator was in the Buena Park McDonald's that justified it being called McThriller.

1442
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:37,700
That's a great answer.

1443
01:03:37,700 --> 01:03:39,160
I want that simulator back.

1444
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,480
Yeah, that is a great answer.

1445
01:03:42,820 --> 01:03:44,760
I could take all the pictures and know what it was.

1446
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:51,980
Just from the era that it was created, there's no way it wasn't bad or very bad.

1447
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:53,840
And when I say that, I mean good.

1448
01:03:53,860 --> 01:03:54,720
Uh-huh.

1449
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:55,140
Yeah.

1450
01:03:55,140 --> 01:03:55,900
If that makes sense.

1451
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:56,780
That sentence makes sense.

1452
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:57,380
I think it did.

1453
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:57,920
Yeah.

1454
01:03:58,060 --> 01:04:00,960
Oh, I never got to Scott.

1455
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:02,160
Maybe you got to this.

1456
01:04:02,220 --> 01:04:14,740
I don't remember when it closed, but at Knotts, there was that like the house where like you're standing on a slope and like the water is poured upward.

1457
01:04:14,740 --> 01:04:16,300
You know what I'm talking about?

1458
01:04:16,340 --> 01:04:17,420
I remember something like that.

1459
01:04:17,460 --> 01:04:18,920
That sounds very familiar.

1460
01:04:19,340 --> 01:04:25,950
It's still in the Calico ghost town in the middle of California and Nevada area.

1461
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:27,080
Oh.

1462
01:04:27,420 --> 01:04:30,460
That Walter Knotts kind of.

1463
01:04:30,460 --> 01:04:34,180
There's like perspective and it looks like an adult is smaller than a child.

1464
01:04:34,340 --> 01:04:34,700
Yeah.

1465
01:04:34,820 --> 01:04:36,740
It's like, I forget what it's called.

1466
01:04:37,980 --> 01:04:41,300
But that seems like it would still delight me.

1467
01:04:41,660 --> 01:04:42,320
Okay, the house.

1468
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:43,100
The house.

1469
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:43,880
The house.

1470
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:45,440
Jason says the house.

1471
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:46,240
Oh, Mickey's birthday.

1472
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:48,540
Like Mickey's house and Mickey's birthday land.

1473
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:49,440
We should do that.

1474
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:50,800
That's a topic we should do soon.

1475
01:04:50,860 --> 01:04:51,120
Yeah.

1476
01:04:51,460 --> 01:04:53,560
Is that a show with all that with Darkwing Duck and whatever?

1477
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:53,860
Yeah.

1478
01:04:54,220 --> 01:04:55,520
And CJ, who my dad liked.

1479
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:56,180
Oh yeah, your dad.

1480
01:04:56,180 --> 01:04:57,720
We saw the show a bunch of times.

1481
01:04:57,960 --> 01:04:57,980
Disney character.

1482
01:04:57,980 --> 01:04:59,340
Because he wanted to see CJ.

1483
01:05:01,020 --> 01:05:02,240
You know what I like is that CJ.

1484
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:04,360
All right.

1485
01:05:04,420 --> 01:05:05,820
Well, CJ coming soon.

1486
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:08,800
Let's wind it down here.

1487
01:05:09,220 --> 01:05:10,500
You Survived podcast, the ride.

1488
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:20,920
I think this is good doing it on Patreon audience.

1489
01:05:21,020 --> 01:05:22,720
I think you fixed it for us.

1490
01:05:23,140 --> 01:05:24,340
Now you can do it.

1491
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:28,240
Do as long of a question as you want without having to pay for one of those

1492
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:32,360
check marks, which now are only on the accounts of awful people.

1493
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:36,940
And he didn't know on the accounts of some often people who are like,

1494
01:05:36,940 --> 01:05:37,880
I'll try this.

1495
01:05:37,940 --> 01:05:39,380
This will make me normal.

1496
01:05:39,780 --> 01:05:40,180
What happened?

1497
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:40,480
All right.

1498
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:42,760
Well, we're taking the post office away from that site.

1499
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:44,860
Let's see how long they last now.

1500
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:46,260
Yeah, it's going to dry up.
