1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,320
May the fourth, believe it or not,

3
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,680
is the day that it is today,

4
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:30,200
which is a day when people talk about Star Wars stuff

5
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,220
for some reason, and that's what we're going to do

6
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:36,040
here today on podcast The Ride the Second Gate.

7
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,800
I'm Scott Gardner, hi Jason Sheridan.

8
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,080
Hi, yeah, it's the Star Wars day, everyone.

9
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:43,080
It's the start, like dead on the dot as this is released.

10
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,040
Dead on the dot.

11
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,360
What are your plans?

12
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:49,220
A lot, you know, there's been a lot of mid pandemic,

13
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:51,160
May the fourth, so what do we all do

14
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,260
now that we're on the loose?

15
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:54,960
Mike Carlson.

16
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,280
Yeah, it's a good question.

17
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,320
How will I celebrate?

18
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,300
I will probably more prominently display

19
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:05,640
my Dexter Jettster toy, sort of maybe on the mantle.

20
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,720
As usual, it's kind of put back in my display, but.

21
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,120
Well, take him on a little journey.

22
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:13,100
There's a thing, I think in my house,

23
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:17,960
you could get, there's like the Nativity scene at Christmas,

24
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,960
which Nativity sets come with the three wise men,

25
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,960
and I think we would make the three wise men travel.

26
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:27,920
They'd be like over off in the credenza,

27
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,700
in the corner of the one living room,

28
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,000
and then they'd make their way to the dining room,

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,920
and then over by the lamp, and it like,

30
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,080
so by the time it got to December 25th,

31
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,640
now they're priced.

32
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,040
So you could take Dexter on a little journey.

33
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,040
Oh, I see what you're saying.

34
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,120
Yeah, over the weeks heading up to May the fourth.

35
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,160
I thought you were gonna say like,

36
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:49,660
he should be one of the wise men, which I agree with,

37
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,560
but I was just trying to figure out what other three,

38
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:56,560
like is it, it's Dexter and like, Subulba maybe.

39
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,080
Who are the wisest of all the prequel characters

40
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,200
who would bring gifts?

41
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,120
I mean, Yoda is obvious as a wise choice.

42
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,000
You want prequel only characters.

43
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,280
I think we want prequel only characters.

44
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,760
Any of the pod racers, Team Toppa Galeys.

45
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,040
I don't know, I'll have to come back to this.

46
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,480
I was thinking the last time,

47
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,000
cause there was a little bit of this talk in the last,

48
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,000
in the episode with Mad Apodaca,

49
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,320
I feel like there should be,

50
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:26,440
we should be part of starting a support group

51
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:29,720
for significant others of podcast listeners

52
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,200
who now talk out loud about the prequels

53
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,960
way more than they used to or ever have due to listening.

54
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,920
And it's not just us, it's Doughboyz and anything,

55
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,800
Bug Affiliate.

56
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,560
I feel like podcast world is dominated by prequels.

57
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,600
And now there's people who don't listen to these podcasts,

58
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,040
who have to hear these names every goddamn day.

59
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,320
That's true, yeah.

60
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,560
And we should do something to help.

61
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,560
I've spread the disease,

62
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,240
way before we did this podcast,

63
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,560
like Jason knows, I've been talking about

64
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,320
every one of the pod racer names,

65
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,440
as long as he's known me.

66
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:02,360
Yeah, yeah, you've wrote it into stage shows.

67
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,720
Yeah, like say eight or nine years ago.

68
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,840
Yeah, and we worked like, some we knew.

69
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,680
Podrace the musical, you wrote a full,

70
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,520
tried to mount it off Broadway, couldn't get the funding.

71
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,560
Couldn't get the funding.

72
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,520
Some we knew was House Sitting once,

73
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:19,800
and you threw episode one on the big screen.

74
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,920
It's like eight or nine years ago.

75
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,840
Yeah, yeah.

76
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,640
It was like motion smoothing was on or something,

77
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,960
so it just looked like a Windows XP.

78
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,760
It looked better, it looked better honestly.

79
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,280
Oh, you think it looked better?

80
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,160
Yeah, it looked good.

81
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,400
Something was not calibrated.

82
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,800
I think it was like a standard,

83
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,200
it was a regular DVD going into a massive television.

84
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,680
But yeah, once we all started doing these podcasts,

85
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,760
then this infection spread to the general population,

86
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,120
and there was a different type of pandemic.

87
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:45,960
There was a different type of.

88
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:46,960
What happened to me?

89
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,040
I didn't know any of these names.

90
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,640
I had a, because I was thinking about this

91
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:52,000
because I was, I had some video on,

92
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,240
I don't even remember what it was,

93
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,800
but realizing that Erin, my wife,

94
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,760
who's never seen any of them, that she recognized Watto,

95
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,640
that she like laughed at the appearance of Watto

96
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,680
and sounded like, you've never seen these movies.

97
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,480
Now you know who Watto is.

98
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,320
Right.

99
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,640
Because of this spread of this,

100
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,480
which I guess a lot of people would say is not a bad thing.

101
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,320
No.

102
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,520
It's just interesting.

103
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,360
It is interesting.

104
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,520
Yeah.

105
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,360
I'm sorry.

106
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,200
Can we go back?

107
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:21,120
Scott, did you say that like your household growing up,

108
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,800
the three wise men, essentially elf on a shelf,

109
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,400
their way to the nativity?

110
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,920
Did I understand that correctly?

111
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,760
Yes.

112
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,600
Yeah.

113
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:33,040
That was a way to keep things going for all of December,

114
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,560
for an evolution to be built.

115
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,400
I wonder if this is,

116
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,560
I feel like this is not only my house,

117
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,400
but maybe I'll feel crazy if it was.

118
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,840
No, I never considered that,

119
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,400
but I think that's so charming.

120
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,680
And that's really like,

121
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,840
that's like an advent calendar of like,

122
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,000
where are these guys gonna be next?

123
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,840
Yes.

124
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,320
Something that goes all through December.

125
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,160
I think it would just be weekly moves.

126
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,520
I can't recall a specific spot.

127
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:58,440
We also maybe bailed on this and only did this one time

128
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,120
and only moved them once,

129
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,120
but it kind of makes me want to bring it back.

130
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:02,960
Yeah, it is good.

131
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,720
A little journey of those guys have very prequely names.

132
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,440
I don't know the names of the Kings.

133
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,600
The three wise men?

134
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,640
Yeah.

135
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,480
Offhand.

136
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,800
What are the names of the three wise men?

137
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,640
Why do I know this?

138
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,480
The three wise men.

139
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,320
Let me look.

140
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,160
Names.

141
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,880
Let's see, Juan Sandage.

142
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,560
No, that's a pod racer.

143
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,320
Let's see.

144
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,640
Oh, these are not that famous.

145
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,880
So I don't feel like shamed for not knowing these.

146
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:31,840
It's Gaspar or Caspar,

147
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,480
Melchior.

148
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,320
Melchior?

149
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,160
Melchior.

150
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,080
Melchior.

151
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,440
And Balthazar.

152
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,400
Oh, Balthazar.

153
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,560
Much like the sorcerer's apprentice.

154
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,400
Yeah, yeah.

155
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,240
Balthazar.

156
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,320
Those are good names though.

157
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,160
They are cool.

158
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:45,980
They are cool names.

159
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,160
They'll all be prequels characters.

160
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,000
Okay.

161
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,200
They're gonna be in that galactic Senate somewhere.

162
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,040
Oh yeah.

163
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:53,880
Oh yeah.

164
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,160
The Balthazarians.

165
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,560
There's a whole species based on them.

166
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,160
Yeah, like Balthazarians.

167
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,680
The voice, warming the voice up

168
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,920
for the rest of this episode.

169
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,760
The voice.

170
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,480
Everyone should get their voice warmed up.

171
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,920
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

172
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,800
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

173
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,280
A, B.

174
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,960
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

175
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,080
Harmonize with Lucas.

176
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:13,920
Arrr.

177
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,760
Arrr.

178
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,600
Arrr.

179
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,080
There you go, Scott got it.

180
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:17,920
Arrr.

181
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,920
You take the fifth.

182
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,760
I'll be on the third and you take the fifth.

183
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,320
By the light.

184
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,160
By the light.

185
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,520
Yeah, we're gonna do barbershop as George Lucas

186
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,840
on this episode.

187
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,080
Let's just, yeah, we'll whip it into shape

188
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:31,920
before we do it.

189
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,760
Yeah.

190
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,120
This episode is about Lucasport.

191
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,440
And if you're looking at that word

192
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,480
and have never seen that word,

193
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,200
that's because this was never built.

194
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,840
And for me, this was recent information.

195
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,680
Yes, absolutely.

196
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,920
I only knew about Lucasport within the last few years.

197
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:52,920
This was a designed and planned and drawn development

198
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:57,360
for Disneyland specifically that never got finished.

199
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,760
But it was going to take over,

200
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,400
if green lit, it was going to take over a ton

201
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,920
of Tomorrowland and be a way to give George Lucas

202
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:10,520
and his properties a big futuristic presence

203
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:14,280
and also utilize a lot of the dead zone of Tomorrowland,

204
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,080
which it's crazy to think that some of it has been

205
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,440
a dead zone since 1984.

206
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,960
Oh man, yeah.

207
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,600
And it's interesting, we're doing this right

208
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:27,600
as the Tokyo parks announce a massive Tomorrowland redo,

209
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,440
including just demolishing Space Mountain

210
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,680
and rebuilding a totally new version.

211
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,280
A whole new Space Mountain, that's crazy.

212
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,920
Yeah, I estimated cost of this project, 56 billion yen,

213
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,080
which at current exchange rates,

214
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,560
when the dollar was stronger, that would be 500 million.

215
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:49,800
The numbers I saw was 437 to 438,

216
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,880
but somewhere around there, millions of dollars.

217
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,720
Wow, wow.

218
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,360
Like we're pushing half a billion dollars

219
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:00,080
to redo Space Mountain and the surrounding areas.

220
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,480
And it's not, you know, I've been there,

221
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:06,040
it wasn't even like, oh yeah, this isn't such trouble.

222
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,280
It's just, they went, oh, you know what?

223
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,080
We can make this look nicer.

224
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,200
Exactly, yeah.

225
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,760
I mean, I think, you know, pictures I've seen Tokyo,

226
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,920
Disneyland, the Tomorrowland still looks

227
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,680
aesthetically pretty good, but I read up,

228
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,560
write up on the project, the new stuff

229
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,200
and what Tomorrowland's like on the Disney tourist blog.

230
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,480
And it's like, oh, it is kind of suffering

231
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,480
from a similar problem that other Tomorrowlands have,

232
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,760
where it's like, oh yeah, and then there's Star Tours,

233
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,520
and then there's a Monsters Inc ride,

234
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,720
and then the logic starts to fall apart a little.

235
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,560
Sure.

236
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,360
In terms of theming. It's not one cohesive.

237
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,640
Yeah, yeah, it's very all over the map there, I would say,

238
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,760
but very cool.

239
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,240
Very fun still.

240
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:51,120
I'm a little sad that we are losing just a pure 1983.

241
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:51,960
Yeah.

242
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,800
I mean, it was so wonderful being there.

243
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,600
It like, I mean, it's, the Space Mountain

244
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:03,040
Disneyland in America feels very similar,

245
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,360
like campus-wise, like they're clones of each other,

246
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,600
but the little touches, just like the whatever,

247
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,800
like the weird like pipe roof and the,

248
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,200
like the like moving walkway to get up there.

249
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,880
Just little things are very, oh, this is exactly how it was

250
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:23,000
in Disneyland in the 70s and 80s, which it's, you know,

251
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,560
it, hey, it rips me up when one of those changes.

252
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,400
Yeah.

253
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,240
The design looks cool. It looks good to me.

254
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,400
Yeah, it does look cool.

255
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:34,040
It would be, it would be a bummer losing the shape of the

256
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,160
ridge, that original Space Mountain building,

257
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,920
which I still like better, I think, than this new design,

258
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:42,720
but I'm still like, yeah, cool. Let's do it.

259
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,800
Like, why not?

260
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,080
Well, this is the spirit that you wish all over the parks had

261
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,960
and could afford to have is just,

262
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:52,080
there's no pressing reason to do it.

263
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:52,920
Yeah.

264
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,560
Like there's, whereas in the American parks,

265
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,680
there's things that have just been rotting for decades

266
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,640
and decades that really need to be changed.

267
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,760
And then in Tokyo, they have the luxury of, I don't know,

268
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:08,280
what do you think? It's like house remodeling instead of

269
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:11,800
waiting until something is like rusted over and like the,

270
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,680
you know, it's going against a code.

271
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,520
I know.

272
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,120
They're just, I don't know, let's get to that now.

273
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:16,960
It's pretty cool.

274
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,880
Yeah. I don't even want to,

275
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,000
and then there's stuff where,

276
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,880
and this is going to cut me off because I could go on and on

277
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:22,720
about this.

278
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,400
Then they're going to just redo the outside of Ralph Brennan's

279
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,120
jazz kitchen and make it look like nothing.

280
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,280
Did you see these pictures?

281
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,120
I did. Yeah. Yeah.

282
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,120
There's some downtown Disney changes coming there.

283
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,360
They're sort of like Palm Springs,ifying it.

284
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,760
I feel,

285
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,880
I didn't know they were redoing Ralph Brennan's.

286
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,720
I missed that.

287
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,560
I got to show you a picture.

288
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,800
I know. I mean, we're getting a did tie funk.

289
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,960
I know that's pretty cool.

290
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,880
Your blood pressure shouldn't go this high, Jason,

291
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,960
but I'm going to show this to you.

292
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,000
And I want, I just want you to sort of temper.

293
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,080
Well, look, no, I thought I was coming here today.

294
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,600
It was going to like, to Scott, you know,

295
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,200
an uva bar.

296
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,040
Oh, they're being re-done.

297
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,080
New names for these two.

298
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,640
I'm suspicious, but I, you know,

299
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,920
a uva has slid a little bit, I will say.

300
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,760
Okay.

301
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,920
Too expensive now.

302
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,480
So if, if they keep the space, then that's good.

303
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:11,880
Jason is inspecting the new Brennan.

304
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,840
Is it staying?

305
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,880
Oh, it is.

306
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,200
Yeah. I don't know what this is.

307
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,040
Yeah. What is this?

308
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,080
They're just kind of painting everything white.

309
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,120
Everything's, everything at downtown Disney's getting a Palm

310
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,000
Springs sort of veneer.

311
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,640
So they're making it look less like a New Orleans style

312
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,040
building.

313
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:28,880
I get, yeah.

314
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,080
Anything with like specific character, I guess,

315
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:32,920
is starting to go well.

316
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:36,480
Although I don't mind, like, I like Splitsville aesthetically.

317
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,120
I like that that is kind of, that's sort of Palm Springsy

318
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,880
sixties mod meets current bland.

319
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,120
I do not mind that.

320
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,720
And there's other buildings at downtown Disney that I think

321
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,800
are not good.

322
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:51,920
I'm in, I'm in favor of some downtown Disney remodeling.

323
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,080
Yeah. No, I'm not.

324
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:56,400
No, no, I'm not a purist for, for downtown Disney.

325
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,240
The way it is.

326
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,160
I just think like there's no personality in that new

327
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,920
Ralph Brennan's jazz.

328
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:02,760
Yeah. Yeah.

329
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,600
That's all I'm saying.

330
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,560
That one is confusing.

331
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,960
Cause that always seems pretty busy.

332
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,960
Like when we had that meal and we were shocked at how good it

333
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,800
was.

334
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,640
Yeah. Yeah.

335
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,560
Well, I think that,

336
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,960
I think the great Ralph Brennan taste will remain.

337
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,760
Oh, well that hopefully, hopefully they're not making

338
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,280
that bland like the outside.

339
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,760
You say it's exciting that Din Tai Fung is coming.

340
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:25,520
There's no way I'm ever going there. Right?

341
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:28,560
Like the way the level of crowded that those places are.

342
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,400
Yeah.

343
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,880
Notoriously. So as documented on Americana brand memes.

344
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,000
I, yeah.

345
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,120
You're going to have to go there.

346
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,720
Cause we have to do a new saga about it.

347
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:41,320
So you're going to have to, we have to wait all day.

348
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:44,480
We all have to do it just for journalism's sake.

349
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,200
I mean, I think like, you know, flipping Katal to like,

350
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,920
I, I've never been there.

351
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,720
I know there's a substantial paella menu.

352
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,440
I don't, I, I've looked at the menu before and I'm like,

353
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,840
oh, it's like Spanish and Mediterranean food.

354
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:03,400
I don't know that the name necessarily communicated that to

355
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,920
the average Disney guests, like the average public.

356
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,800
No, it seems like nothing. Yeah.

357
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,280
Yeah. I'd like to try it before it closes.

358
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,680
It always seemed interesting,

359
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,440
but I just never got around to it.

360
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:17,360
So yeah, I kind of get that.

361
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,920
Didn't I, Fung's an interesting get that area will probably be

362
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,840
mobbed because it's going back by like,

363
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,680
Yeah. Where is it?

364
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:27,280
The movies that the stuff they're going to start demolishing

365
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:30,840
the movies and I saw a sandwich out sandwich,

366
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,680
which is coming back.

367
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,000
Cause it's becoming a cart.

368
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Yeah. Like it's going to be random places to get us Earl of

369
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,640
sandwich. They said, I don't know. I don't know how.

370
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,200
You're going to go down one of the, like a little alleyway.

371
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,920
And there's going to be somebody with just like 10 of the,

372
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,920
like a turkey and Thanksgiving style sandwiches.

373
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,640
I don't know how Robert is putting up with this. I'll,

374
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:51,640
I'll say that Robert should not have to deal with this.

375
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:55,000
Yeah. He should be, he's actually have a brick and mortar store.

376
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:59,520
He's focused on his son right now. He is making sure that the

377
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,600
breakfast club gets off the ground.

378
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:05,160
As long as Robbie's in a good place, Robert will be too.

379
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:09,160
You know, Robbie's got a great deal coming for like a

380
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:13,400
Stromboli delivery company fronted by a Tik TOK guy who's like a

381
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:16,840
twin, but really mean to his other twin and people love it.

382
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,280
Oh man. Yeah. He's doing a ghost kitchen for Ben Shapiro.

383
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,000
I was excited about that.

384
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:29,840
Shapiro's burritos. All right. They're extremely bland.

385
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,560
So bland. All right. Well, look, we, there'll be more of this talk.

386
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:38,520
We have a important discussion today about Lucas port.

387
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:41,840
Lucas port. Yeah. Lucas port. Which it's like, okay.

388
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,200
If you, if you don't know anything about this,

389
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:49,400
presumably we will be posting some of the art that is

390
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:53,720
cropped up for it. And that's the, it looks so great.

391
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,560
Oh my God.

392
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:00,080
I know. Yeah, I know this thing even more. Cause like, I think you,

393
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:03,040
I don't know if we'd all agree, but like Westcott was this, you know,

394
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,200
the West coast Epcot that never got built.

395
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:09,280
And I think that for a lot of us is like the dream thing that never happened.

396
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:14,760
But the more I look at this art and there also is a version of this

397
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,320
where, which was in a second park, which we'll talk about a little bit.

398
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,440
This might be number one now for me.

399
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,240
This is, yeah, that was not really cool. I mean,

400
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,960
there's some amazing unbuilt Disney stuff. We haven't really,

401
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,800
really dug down a Westcott being, I think the other big one.

402
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,200
And then tomorrow land 2055. Yeah. Which is cool too.

403
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,720
But this thing, this thing, this with the star Wars,

404
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,920
he ticket like, Oh man. Yes.

405
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:47,040
Architecture wise, it is this amazing

406
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,360
crystal cathedral. Yes. Looking, you see, you were,

407
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,600
you said something in your little warmup, JSA,

408
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:58,000
that's like a crystal superstructure. Yes. It's so awesome.

409
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,840
It's, you know, it's all abstract and multi-tiered. It looks like that crazy.

410
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:09,000
It's like a giant version of that crazy KFC down on Western for Helen.

411
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,840
Yeah. You know what I mean?

412
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,440
It was much bigger and crystal and not a KFC.

413
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:18,160
Well, Tony Baxter kind of overseeing this all, of course,

414
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:23,160
tried to get the giant crystals in the original land pavilion proposal.

415
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,640
Oh yeah. He loves crystal, giant crystals.

416
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:29,960
And I, I, I just don't know the science. Like to me,

417
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:34,400
these seemed like, you know, Bart melting ants with a magnifying glass.

418
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:38,280
I'm like, how do you keep this from just heating inside?

419
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,320
Like the sun shining on it.

420
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:45,480
That was a problem at a Vegas, a very like bright glass Vegas

421
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,400
casino. I forget which one is that right?

422
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:52,600
Trees got lit on fire around the pool. A couple of palm trees got nailed.

423
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,680
Sure. There's a lot of, you see some glare in Vegas in general. It's like,

424
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,480
how is this not frying people down below?

425
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:03,640
There is some stuff where like you see in Vegas or you just think about in

426
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:09,000
Vegas, where it's like, this isn't a front to God's creation. Like it is amazing.

427
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,880
I mean, I saw the water level by one of the, like, uh, is it by the Hoover dam?

428
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:18,680
The, the, the water's very low out in the desert out there right now,

429
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:22,560
where it's like an intake pump in the aquifer is below,

430
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:27,280
above the water line for the first time, maybe ever. And it's like, oh,

431
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:30,400
you don't want to see, you don't want to see that.

432
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:36,120
No, not terribly. Yeah. Yeah. Um, I don't know. They don't get into the details.

433
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,440
If we ever talked to Tony Baxter again, I would be interested.

434
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:42,400
Let's write that on the list of how do you make sure that guests don't fry like

435
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,280
ants inside your giant crystal structure? They're trapped in your crystal.

436
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,640
Yeah. Um, because I would assume he would have had to think about that,

437
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,720
but maybe not. I think he's, he knows what he's doing. This seems,

438
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,080
I think it would have worked. Um, it,

439
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:00,400
it also like, yeah, it's just this, like, I mean, it's, it's,

440
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,960
it's eighties retrofuture. It's so beautiful. It's really up my alley.

441
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:08,040
And it's all, yeah, it's all crystal prism and a big atrium that like,

442
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,840
that contains these, the idea of these little, I mean, it's very Epcot too.

443
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,400
They sort of stopped doing this post Epcot,

444
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:19,640
the idea of this little indoor campus that contains multiple

445
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,640
attractions connected by little bridges that get you up and above the train

446
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,280
track and, you know,

447
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:30,720
into disparate corners of this, this huge building.

448
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,480
And there's a good like side view drawing of what it would be,

449
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,440
like a cross section drawing that's on that's out there that you could see what

450
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,960
you're talking about pretty well.

451
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,600
Cause sometimes you see this stuff and it's like very abstract,

452
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:46,280
but like you can kind of see exactly where, I mean, I'm assuming you've,

453
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,480
it's going to be hard to see this,

454
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:52,040
but like it's a cross section and there's levels and it feels like a,

455
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,920
like a base. I think we've talked about this before as a kid.

456
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:59,480
I love the base of like a heroes and it's like little secret passages and

457
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:03,400
different rooms and like it feels, especially with a giant crystal thing,

458
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,120
it feels like other world, an other worldly type of base.

459
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:09,520
Yeah. And all the concept art and there, there were three, there were, you know,

460
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,560
physical models of it too.

461
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,920
It's like almost central that the monorail goes around it.

462
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:20,800
The people mover goes either through or around it.

463
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:25,000
The train is reroute it. So we, so there's all this mo that kinetic energy,

464
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,200
we always bring up. There's all this motion.

465
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,800
There's all this transit around it, like kind of like importantly,

466
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,880
like, and these aren't going away. These are important. We need,

467
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,280
you kind of need these.

468
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,600
Yeah, sure. Yeah.

469
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,320
They find a way to route attractions through or around it.

470
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,640
And then rocket jets would have moved inside.

471
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:45,760
Yeah. Those are,

472
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,040
which is maybe feels weird to trap those instead of being open.

473
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,160
I think they would have been up higher.

474
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,760
I bet it's like cooler to look at those maybe then to be on them,

475
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:00,200
but up higher is, is cool as opposed to what they did,

476
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,720
which is bring it down lower essentially right into the hub.

477
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:08,040
Yes. Which, yeah, that's a problem. And I'm sure as soon as they have money,

478
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:08,880
they'll get rid of it.

479
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:13,240
I mean, we've only been saying that for decades. So I,

480
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:17,920
so much of this stuff, like the, the circle, not the circle vision,

481
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,000
the Carousel Progress Theater,

482
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,640
which became in inventions after America Sings,

483
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:28,280
it's still haunting the land. It's still there.

484
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,840
How is, how is this the one thing?

485
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:35,480
It seems like just one of the most valuable pieces of real

486
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:38,120
estate in the world to me,

487
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:42,720
like that is a huge plot of land that you could easily blow up and turn into

488
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:47,400
something very cool. How is it? Maybe it isn't, maybe it's awkwardly small.

489
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:51,720
Maybe there is not enough space out of that Carousel Theater to really do

490
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:55,960
something. Well, I think, no, I think you can do something. I think that I,

491
00:20:56,040 --> 00:21:00,920
I'm guessing here, I I'm speculating, but I think it keeps falling under the,

492
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,200
well, we got to do a lot more. So why would we do a little thing?

493
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,520
We're going to have to gut the whole thing. Like we're going to have to get,

494
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:10,280
Autopia has to go, like we have to get rid of so much of this.

495
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,960
And every time probably proposals pop up, it's like,

496
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,200
it's either all or nothing.

497
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:15,960
We, yeah, yeah.

498
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,120
Probably what keeps happening with it as opposed to,

499
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,080
and it's such a pain in the ass to do it as opposed to they could just kind of

500
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:28,120
take bugs land away. That's a corner that nobody's going to go to for a while.

501
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,800
And we'll trade everything out and put new stuff in.

502
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,880
And that's an easy fix too, because it's like bugs land,

503
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,200
isn't making them any money. There's like,

504
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,880
was there even a gift shop in bugs land? No, I don't think so.

505
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,680
There was a couple of food stands. Yeah.

506
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:48,240
So there was like, Oh, the most popular thing we own. Yeah, that's going in. Oh,

507
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,360
it's food and drink and merchandise. Yeah. Of course that's going in.

508
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:55,040
Like there's no vastly more than there used to be. Yeah.

509
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:58,520
That's a rubber stamp, a quickly rubber stamp that.

510
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,760
But with Tomorrowland, it's a little bit, yeah,

511
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:05,080
it's that doesn't have the slam dunk nature for the money people.

512
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:09,440
I have to think just if they were to demolish the subs and Autopia,

513
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:14,240
the just demo and filling in the land,

514
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,800
that would just be so expensive before even putting something new there.

515
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,840
I think so.

516
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:23,960
It's like shut down for four years. Also, everything has to be shut down. Yeah.

517
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:27,000
Except maybe like a tiny little walkway to space mountain,

518
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:31,240
but also space mountain will probably get a redo too. Yeah. Even though.

519
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:36,320
And no clear IP to fuel any of this because the clear IP,

520
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:39,360
as with this in 1984 and what,

521
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:44,480
like when we didn't know what the galaxy's edge plan was clearly Star Wars,

522
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,840
Star Wars equals future. Yes.

523
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:51,280
And I feel like there's been plans where you end up with a big Millennium Falcon

524
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:54,120
over there. Yeah. That was about that sort of thing.

525
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:57,280
Before the full galaxy's edge. That was the idea. Yeah.

526
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,560
But now it's on the other side of the price.

527
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:03,360
It doesn't make sense to do more Star Wars over there. So what fuels it?

528
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:08,080
There is no future thing on the way, unless it's this Tron.

529
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:13,360
Our only hope is Tron. Yeah. The only possible thing. Yeah. And that's still,

530
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,880
I mean, I assume that's probably,

531
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:19,160
that's the best idea they have to is to do a version of Tron here and then just

532
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:22,840
make it aesthetically look like, you know, whatever they're going to do in Florida.

533
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,480
But that attraction will be over.

534
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:28,520
The original Tron will be in Shanghai will be over 10 years old.

535
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:32,080
Yeah. By the time it were to get built here.

536
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,000
I also wouldn't be, I know we're all over the place in this,

537
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,320
but I wouldn't be surprised if the Tokyo space mountain isn't going to use the

538
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:44,600
guardians coaster technology. Oh, I wouldn't be shocked.

539
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:48,000
A little more going on a little more like tricks and storytelling.

540
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,560
I saw one frame, like one screenshot of a Lee or no Disney put it up,

541
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:57,040
but one screenshot of like what the thing looks like. And I think like it's,

542
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,480
so there's a lot of screens on it. Spoiler alert.

543
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,760
So it does look like you're going through space. Yeah.

544
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,320
It does feel like a very, a really souped up space mountain for sure. Yeah.

545
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,400
So are we like,

546
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,120
I don't think they've definitively said if they're bulldozing the whole thing or

547
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,800
not, like they could keep some of the structure and build that for Tokyo.

548
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:21,280
Yeah. They could. Yeah. But they're, they're completely gutting space mountain.

549
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,360
I know that they're gutting it,

550
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:27,040
but I don't know like if they're leaving like the bones of it and building a new

551
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:31,000
case around it. I don't think so, but I know I could be wrong.

552
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,920
I think it's a totally new thing. Okay. But I could be wrong.

553
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:39,880
But that's my guess. But anyway, yeah. Some like foundation, some base of,

554
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:42,480
yeah, yeah, but it seems pretty new. So I guess you,

555
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,720
I guess what I'm getting at is I guess you could do like guardians space

556
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,520
mountain and like you could do that here,

557
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:51,360
but then you'd have to overlay it at this guardians and it wouldn't be space

558
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,440
mountain anymore. So I don't know.

559
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:57,000
In Disney and proper yet, unless they break that rule, right.

560
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:01,280
Which why not? I don't, I don't know. I, if, if it's,

561
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:05,200
if whatever it takes, if we, if we need more star wars over there,

562
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,800
not in galaxy's edge, fine. If it takes, if Marvel goes, whatever, I do not care.

563
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,680
Let me see. New things so bad.

564
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:15,360
Let me see how much you want new things. If it's Peter Pan space mountain,

565
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,240
do you want it?

566
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:20,960
Peter Pan galactic Peter pan galactic flight.

567
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:25,680
And it's like kind of a, it's like a new, like steampunk future pan.

568
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:30,400
And he has like, and they turn the little rocket ships into like little,

569
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,960
like I guess kind of like pirate ships, but they're like steampunk.

570
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:37,560
Like so the pirate ships you would see on an island of treasure,

571
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:42,240
like a treasure, some sort of island, a whole planet treasure plan.

572
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:45,760
Okay. All right. Is that how much do you want it new?

573
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,840
All right. All right. Okay. Pinocchio space Pinocchio.

574
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:55,920
More, more okay with okay. Yeah.

575
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,880
Pinocchio 30 99, which is coming soon. I hope.

576
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:05,160
Which is just AI. Okay. That's right. Yeah. Oh, I take an AI coaster.

577
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:08,800
That sounds great. Yes. Space mountain is now AI the ride.

578
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:12,040
David, we are on a roller coaster.

579
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,000
Okay.

580
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,160
Mommy.

581
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,120
Okay. It's like the ending of ET,

582
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:23,680
but it's the kid robot and he doesn't call you by your name.

583
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:28,280
Just everyone that goes by mommy, mommy, is that mommy?

584
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,920
And it's an exciting ride. But then at the end,

585
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:36,800
you have to sit underwater and watch David pray to the blue

586
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:40,000
fairy for, I mean, it's not years,

587
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,840
but you get like a full five minutes of sitting still and watching him in tone.

588
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,880
I wish I was real.

589
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:49,880
You do get one like very kind of melancholy, like happy day.

590
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:53,240
The end of the ride is like one perfect day with mommy. Like,

591
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:59,040
I believe, uh, kind of executive noted its way in of like,

592
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:02,560
you can't just end this movie with this child. Is that what happens?

593
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:05,120
That I recall correctly, like the,

594
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:10,160
the hyper evolved like beings in the future grant him a wish and it's like to

595
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,680
have like a happy time.

596
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:19,720
That is a, that is a movie with a fourth act. That is a rare structure movie.

597
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:24,600
And then he prayed for 1000 years.

598
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,560
I honestly, as we're talking about it, I'm like, I don't,

599
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:31,640
I was thinking like, Oh, maybe I should revisit this. And I'm like, no,

600
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:34,600
I'm getting upset. Like, I don't want to think about it.

601
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,520
He remotely thinking about a probably good.

602
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:42,600
I saw it whenever it came out when I was like 13 or 14 that I did not have the

603
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,880
emotional bandwidth to really stick my teeth into it.

604
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:48,440
Cause now I'd probably be like, I don't like this.

605
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,440
I don't want to finish this one.

606
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:53,640
Imagine being a parent, imagine having a little boy. Oh my God.

607
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:57,320
I might need a sec. I need to go smoke a cigarette or something.

608
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,400
Watching the boy like,

609
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:03,960
like her drive away and leave him in the fort. Jesus Christ.

610
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,480
Oh, yeah. Oh yeah.

611
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:09,000
Well that's the new theme for space mountain though, sadly.

612
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,120
And your deal with the devil you just made here.

613
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:14,680
Damn it. I shouldn't have left myself open to any possibility.

614
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:19,600
But the ride is you getting in a futuristic car and leaving your son in a

615
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,680
forest and driving away as fast as you can.

616
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:26,400
That's the new ending is like you getting back home and realizing you don't

617
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,120
have to take care of this creepy boy.

618
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:31,640
And they're like, uh, what's the lost daughter, the ride.

619
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:37,480
It's like there is an animatronic Jude law sex worker robot who's kind of

620
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:40,840
glib. So you get that. That's fun.

621
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:44,440
And if we're after character interaction and intimacy, they should make,

622
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:47,880
it's the first Disney experience where you could fuck an animatronic.

623
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,960
You get to find a West world finally coming true.

624
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:56,400
Shapek would make it happen. He's all about little up charges. That's true.

625
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,120
Yeah. Yeah. Sure.

626
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:02,320
What better way to like dole out little up charges at a time than through

627
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,640
robotic prostitution.

628
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:08,880
Sure. And the Disney play app features are just people like going on and on

629
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:13,280
about like, you know, Stanley did not live to see this project done,

630
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:17,280
but we kept, we have his notes and we looked at his original art, you know,

631
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,160
a lot of the original Kubrick work on it.

632
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:22,240
We think Stanley Kubrick would have loved this roller coaster.

633
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,320
Yeah.

634
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:27,120
For Kubrick ports. He Kubrick. Oh, well,

635
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,520
I believe we're getting ahead of ourselves.

636
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:33,320
I want at the end here to just sort of blue sky, some other director ports,

637
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:37,840
some other ports about this. Yeah, absolutely. Like that's what,

638
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:42,240
I think the strange thing about this is even the idea that this would be called

639
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:47,400
Lucas ports, because what you don't have in Disneyland is another

640
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:52,080
area. There's okay, there's, there's Pixar, but Pixar is still an entity.

641
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:56,800
It's not Lasseter port. There's no Lasseter port. There's no Lasseter pier.

642
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:02,520
No Lasseter place. Yeah. So it's strange that you would take another person.

643
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:06,560
I mean, or if they had, or if they had called it, what, uh, if,

644
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:10,920
if galaxy's edge was called Abrams port, sure. That would feel very strange.

645
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:11,800
Johnson port.

646
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:17,400
Abram, Johnson, Abrams, Kennedy, Kennedy port.

647
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:21,680
Yeah. Sounds like a law firm now. Yeah. So right. Did that? Yeah. No, that's not,

648
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:26,080
there is yet no precedence for it. And not since it really is.

649
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,880
I was thinking how strange the name is. It's a cool name,

650
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,600
but it'd be so weird if today there was still Lucas port.

651
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:36,080
But if you think about it, it is the same format as Disneyland. Yes.

652
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,320
Disneyland, Lucas port. Oh yeah. Yeah.

653
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:42,400
That's less weird if you view it from that angle.

654
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,720
It's interesting though, that that was the name,

655
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:48,960
like they were considering that as the name because of how much I think faith

656
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,920
they would have that George Lucas would continue probably to just like churn out

657
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,040
hits, which George Lucas, I mean,

658
00:30:56,040 --> 00:31:00,440
he produced Indiana Jones and would go on to make more star wars,

659
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:05,040
but years later, like it wasn't like he was, you know,

660
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:08,720
doing a new movie every couple of years, like Steven Spielberg wound up doing.

661
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:11,680
But at the time I think I could, this is also speculation,

662
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:16,680
but it feels like we need to invest heavily in this guy and kiss his ass as

663
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:19,080
much as possible and name.

664
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:21,520
Like we want him involved in this so much.

665
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:25,840
Let's name a whole land part of Disneyland after him. Yeah. Right.

666
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:29,600
What, but what is interesting is like, yeah, there's a star wars roller,

667
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:32,360
like an insane sounding star wars roller coaster.

668
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:38,040
But the rest of the concept art is kind of like interesting,

669
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:42,480
like future redesign, right? A version of alien encounter,

670
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,880
the Astro jets. So it's not all star wars. Right. That's it.

671
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,440
That even, I think again,

672
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:51,000
adds to my point where it's like it wasn't even like they were like doing

673
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,120
everything Lucas. So it was,

674
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,840
there was still stuff that was like space mountain was still there and that was

675
00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:00,520
not necessarily tied to George or these other things were not directly from like

676
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:03,200
THX or something. Yeah.

677
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:07,640
There was no American graffiti ride. So like, they still were like,

678
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,280
we're going to name the whole place after you,

679
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:12,960
even though it's not necessarily everything of yours. Sure.

680
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,520
Which actually your spirits,

681
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:19,560
but would they have then owed adding the Howard the duck is walking around?

682
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,720
Yes, they would have owed that which is radio land murders.

683
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:27,080
There's a radio land murders show radio show and audio,

684
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:32,000
a little audio play. Yes. Yes. They owed all of that. And, and because,

685
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:35,840
and if tomorrow I was in the same state it is now we would have still had Howard

686
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:40,840
the duck walking around and like I'm a guy playing young Harrison Ford driving

687
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,480
around in a car from American graffiti. Yeah.

688
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,040
We would have still had that show going on.

689
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:51,360
It's weird how much American graffiti there is at universal studios and then

690
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:56,280
none of that has ever gone. Just that you've got those diners. Oh, right. Right.

691
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,800
They're like, they're in both parks that there's a big,

692
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:02,720
this fifties drive in, but that's what that's from. Right.

693
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:06,760
Mel's diner is the diner in the movie,

694
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:10,600
but I think it's also like a kitschy looking,

695
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:14,280
a bit of Americana where they need to sell hamburgers anyway.

696
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:20,160
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. True. Is the, uh,

697
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:23,160
is the name of the sequel to American graffiti more American graffiti?

698
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,480
Absolutely is Michael.

699
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,200
Maybe the funniest sequel title I've ever heard too,

700
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:30,840
cause it's like really just like literally, yeah, here's more of it.

701
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:36,160
You like the first one more. Here's more. Uh, I wish more sequels. Cause like,

702
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:39,280
you know, we always hear like rise of so-and-so and it's,

703
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:43,840
there's these overused sequel titles and yeah, well, let's just do more. Yeah.

704
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,120
More red notice, more red notice.

705
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,960
They have a chance to just read to reset how we brand these. Yeah.

706
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:56,000
So just please more studios. Another bird box. Yeah. A second bird box.

707
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:02,080
More. Yeah. Uh, so yeah. Add more to any of the movies you like.

708
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,680
Um, yeah, let's, well, when I talk about this,

709
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:09,080
the ride a little bit, the, the, the primary thing,

710
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:14,080
which this was the first imagineer designed attempt at a Star Wars attraction.

711
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:20,320
And this would have been a massive indoor roller coaster that has set pieces,

712
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:28,240
animatronics, and mainly the big innovation decision points where you can veer

713
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,720
off onto different paths.

714
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:37,960
I think basically six different combos that you could do that involve what are

715
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:43,200
the, the, the choice that you make is like, do you, uh,

716
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:46,720
do you fight or fight or fight? Yeah. Uh huh.

717
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:51,360
And the, the fleeing takes you where, well, it's, what are,

718
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:56,360
what are all the scenes in this all told you start in Dagobah with Yoda and Obi-Wan.

719
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,320
Yeah. And it's like, yeah. So,

720
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,960
so you're in like what looks like from the art,

721
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:07,080
just like kind of space mountain ish roller coaster kind of cars.

722
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:12,560
We're in like a cool glass tube, essentially launching into space.

723
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:18,040
Yes. Uh, and then there's like full animatronic Dagobah and I guess it's like ghost

724
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:22,160
Yoda, maybe not real Yoda. I'm not sure like force ghost, but I'm not sure.

725
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:25,800
I don't know. It might not be cause there's, you see scenes from Star Wars,

726
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:29,440
I think like that happened like during the movie. So I'm not sure. Um,

727
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:33,480
but then apparently it would have been like a full animatronic show and trees

728
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:38,480
and everything like Dagobah. And then as if Yoda was using his force,

729
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:41,360
the car lifts up. And did you read this?

730
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:45,920
And what would happen is the whole scene basically would have lowered down to

731
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,480
make you feel like you were rising up out of the swamp.

732
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,240
His entire set, the whole,

733
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:56,200
swamp moves to make it feel like you're flying. But in reality, it's lowering,

734
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,480
the swamp itself is lowering.

735
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:00,840
I saw something that said it's you.

736
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:04,360
This force is strong with you. That's why the thing is.

737
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:08,160
Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But I'm yeah, practically. Yeah.

738
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:14,080
Yeah. Illusion would have been done. Uh, which just like this, for this alone,

739
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:18,480
if that was the whole thing, I would have been like, oh yeah, please. That's neat.

740
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:22,400
Uh, very, very cool. That's, and that's directed at you. That's what you're at.

741
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:26,480
The force is exactly. This is all the stuff I'm like, that's like lacking.

742
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:30,240
Like risers. I'm like, yeah, like more about me.

743
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,280
Isn't very about you, isn't it?

744
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:36,040
Do you feel like you're just along for the ride or I mean,

745
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:40,280
I know what's about me and we're like helping and stuff, but I don't know.

746
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:45,080
I want someone to talk about how like I'm the five force sensitive. I,

747
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,520
I'm the guy, you know, I want here.

748
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:51,520
Maybe if a rise of resistance was just one per car, I would be happier.

749
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,640
You know, like you, I don't want to share.

750
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:58,320
The worrying count on like a display. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

751
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:02,760
But all of the, you share all of it. You shared transformers, you share star tours,

752
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:08,760
but you like when the holograms say you, you're my only hope. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

753
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:13,600
And it's like, if I'm the rebel spy or whatever too, which has happened twice,

754
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:17,960
you know, but the rise of resistance, like, okay, let's get it.

755
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:22,560
Let's make me feel a little more special. So much shared spot. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

756
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,960
So yeah, Yoda and also just Yoda robot.

757
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:29,760
Also be great. Yeah. Um, where do you go from here?

758
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:35,360
Uh, circling some AT-ATs, uh, what else? Uh, dual.

759
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:39,240
It just said between Darth Vader and a Jedi, I guess,

760
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,440
I guess it kept it open.

761
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,280
They're unclear. Yeah, exactly. So yeah, this,

762
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:46,880
the coaster has three guest choice points where you would choose to dogfight or

763
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,720
flee.

764
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:51,560
Who would ever flee? Well, I mean, if you went on a lot, I guess.

765
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:55,480
I think the one, some of the tracks were more family friendly, but they,

766
00:37:55,480 --> 00:38:00,360
they're assuming that all the riders are rational actors. When in reality,

767
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:05,240
if a couple teenagers are in that car and they see little kids go like fight,

768
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:09,760
fight, we want loops as many loops. Let's terrorize these children.

769
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,000
It seems, yeah, it seems if you were going to fight,

770
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:15,680
then the coaster itself would then have loops versus fleeing.

771
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:16,880
You'd have a smooth flight,

772
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:21,160
which is so crazy because like that has to have a whole bunch of different,

773
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,720
like physics and it's not physics,

774
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:27,040
but like one thing has to go so much faster than the other.

775
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,920
And like to be able to build something that complicated,

776
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,960
I don't think there's any coaster still that's been built like this.

777
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,960
That's this complicated. Yeah.

778
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:39,800
That have that many variations. And I mean, look,

779
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:43,160
the show building would have had to have been massive and they had the full

780
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:46,360
parking lot to work with because there's no second gate. Right.

781
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,680
There's no California adventure.

782
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:52,240
We're going to go over the like berm. Like,

783
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,440
they would have had to build massive show buildings.

784
00:38:55,680 --> 00:39:00,040
So that's what some of the sky bridges would have had to get you to like all

785
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,920
the way out of the park.

786
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:06,000
But then if you think about where California adventure is, so like right at the,

787
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,760
so just a big corner of the parking lot is gone.

788
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,840
Basically you got to walk people.

789
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:14,520
I guess a precursor to Indiana Jones where there's a big old walk before you get

790
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,360
to the ride. Yeah.

791
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:18,960
That building where it's like when you're on the parking tram going to Disneyland

792
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,000
and you're like, Oh, that's a big warehouse. And you're like,

793
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,760
you are looking at the haunted mansion.

794
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,360
You are looking at the actual Indiana Jones would have been another one of the,

795
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:29,480
but when you think about, but this would have to be,

796
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:32,080
we're really talking multiple point,

797
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:36,960
like six different sections of coast and they all have to hook up and arrive.

798
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,320
It's insane. Yeah.

799
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:43,840
Justically it's like air traffic control. It's crazy. Space wise.

800
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:47,480
That's the, it's hard to pine for this thing in this ride too much because

801
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:51,080
that's insane. There's no way it would have had to take over like half of the

802
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:51,760
parking lot.

803
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:56,320
The only people I could see building it is the Oriental land company,

804
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:01,200
the Tokyo group. And even they, I feel like would have scaled back because how

805
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:04,240
much would it, this been not even in numbers back then,

806
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:08,120
but I feel like this alone would have been at least rise of the,

807
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,120
at least half a million,

808
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,480
500 million dollars,

809
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:14,200
the money it is. But like, I'm sure there's a version of it where just like,

810
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,000
it doesn't have, you don't have the choices.

811
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,880
You just put them on the path of like, yeah, yeah, that would have been,

812
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,840
you're right. That would have been the first thing to go. Yeah.

813
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:26,400
Cause that's not essential. It's a neat idea and it'd be neat for something.

814
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:27,480
Yeah. To do this.

815
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:31,360
But you could easily just, you know, give them the path that does the loops.

816
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,560
Yeah. Nothing's ever, you're right.

817
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:36,320
Nothing's ever done this coaster wise.

818
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:39,640
There's rides where you go off this way or that way,

819
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:44,680
but there is not, but those are more slower dark rides or trackless resistance

820
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:48,120
is kind of like that would just lick little differences between the way you go.

821
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:51,800
Yeah. But a coaster, yeah, we were talking about it kind of ride still has never

822
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:56,000
been. Yeah. And like with Hagrid's and universal Orlando, it's like they're,

823
00:40:56,080 --> 00:41:00,080
they're just now kind of experimenting even more with sort of like this,

824
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:03,200
there's a drop there and you go on another track at the end of that.

825
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:06,280
So like there's like stuff like that. That's kind of innovative in the code,

826
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:10,120
but that still feels like simple compared to what this is.

827
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:14,200
And it breaks down all the time. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

828
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:17,160
They open that thing too early. They definitely open Hagrid's too early.

829
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:19,040
It feels like, but if, if there were,

830
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:24,040
if you had to account for parts like that track switches over and over again,

831
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:28,320
and Hagrid's still only has one way that you can go. We're talking,

832
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:33,680
that Hagrid's is inside a building and then there's three different Hagrid's

833
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:39,720
right types of Hagrid paths. And then also what?

834
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:44,360
75% of everyone would just be hitting fight. Yeah. One of the track,

835
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:48,600
one of the tracks would be like getting a lot more use than the other.

836
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:51,800
Just hitting both because people just see something light up,

837
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:55,560
realize it's a button and just smack them. You know? Yeah. That being said,

838
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:59,560
obviously we build this, please like build the crazy version of it.

839
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:04,680
Yes. But it is, it is in all serious,

840
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:09,400
like what I've complained about as far as rise of resistance is I feel like it

841
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:12,600
doesn't put your body in a sense of panic during it.

842
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:15,160
Like I think some of the best rides do like Indiana Jones.

843
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:18,560
I was I on transformers alone yesterday, universal. Yes, I was.

844
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:21,520
That ride makes your body feel like something's wrong because you're

845
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:26,120
constantly banging into the back of it. Very unpleasant. Very physically

846
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:28,600
unpleasant. I dropped my phone. I thought it was lost.

847
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:33,160
You want that. You want to have your head banged. You want a question.

848
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:35,720
And you want to drop your phone. Yes. Uh,

849
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,880
and like some of the art in this is like you're,

850
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:41,240
you're going through like the tunnels of what I assume is probably the death

851
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:44,560
star, but might be a star destroyer. Um, and I was like, well,

852
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:47,800
this would like solve that problem of like having your body feel like it was

853
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,160
panicking a little bit.

854
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:53,400
Like it is an Indiana Jones or on any of the best e-ticket rides.

855
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:57,120
Isn't this the word you used about Buzz Lightyear that I get on? I panic.

856
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,040
Panic was wrong.

857
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:01,560
Panic so central to hear what you want out of these experiences.

858
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:05,880
I think panic is just something I feel a few times a day in general.

859
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:08,200
So the word is in the forefront of my mind.

860
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:10,800
You want to get it out in a controlled way.

861
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:15,800
You want to release the panic in a way that is fun and not, uh,

862
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:19,400
applied to the stresses of your life. Yeah, I think that is probably what it is.

863
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:23,000
Uh, I overuse the word on Buzz Lightyear. I apologize to the listeners.

864
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:26,880
Uh, more sort of anxious about getting a good score, but, um,

865
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:29,000
but I was on transformers yesterday.

866
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:33,680
I was like kind of just trying to like not look at the screen and like feel what

867
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:37,040
it was doing to my body, the ride vehicle. And it is, it is unpleasant,

868
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,320
but I think that's good. I think that's part of the ride.

869
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:43,680
So you tried to do kind of a Zen thing of just like being the moment,

870
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:48,560
feel what's happening. Feel the world around you. I do feel it. It sucks.

871
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:50,000
Remove the glasses.

872
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:54,280
Count your account, your breath as they're screaming, like, look out. It's,

873
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,440
it's Megatron.

874
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,880
Your shoulder. Yes. Your left shoulder is smacked into a hard piece of plastic.

875
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:02,920
Yeah. What does it feel like? Uh,

876
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:07,320
do you hear a tinny version of I feel good coming out of a

877
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:08,800
robot's walkman?

878
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:11,600
Yeah. Yeah. Uh, that is what I was doing.

879
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:15,680
That's like when I have the like bell at the end of a meditation session,

880
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:19,240
like a light bell to tell you it's, it's ended.

881
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:24,200
That's the, I feel good. That's the, yeah, the, I feel good slowly brain now.

882
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:27,760
So don't open your eyes slowly. Open your eyes and take in the,

883
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,560
the last song is like, give it to me now.

884
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:32,880
That's the last song we're talking about is I feel good earlier in the ride.

885
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:37,280
There's a little bit of I feel good towards the end. I think. Yeah,

886
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:40,040
I guess it's toward the end or is I'm trying to think where this,

887
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:44,000
where the songs are to me now. It's like a disco song, right?

888
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:47,440
Is that pulling into the station? Is that what you're thinking? I feel that.

889
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:50,760
I thought he catches you and goes, I feel good at the end.

890
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:56,480
Have we done transformers? We've not done transform. I was on the ride.

891
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:59,960
Really? I was on the ride yesterday going, did we do this?

892
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:03,280
I've talked so much about it and I was like, I can't remember.

893
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:07,640
Accurate to the movies because you find them on cable and you go like,

894
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:08,720
did I see this?

895
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:13,600
Well, yeah. And the way that I've been on that ride a bunch of times and I can't

896
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:16,120
tell you the plot. I don't know what song you're talking about.

897
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:19,360
I know my friend is there. I know.

898
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:22,560
James song. Isn't there a Rick James song on there in the ride?

899
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:25,720
I think it's something like that. Am I wrong? You know, they really think that's,

900
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:31,080
wait, that's wait, maybe it is. Uh, give it to me. Baby is on.

901
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:34,880
Is that the song? And you were on it yesterday and you don't know it was on it

902
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:36,760
yesterday. Yeah. They need to,

903
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:39,920
they need to add some of the later movie innovations into the ride.

904
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:43,000
They need to have Stanley Tucci drinking a bag of Chinese milk.

905
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:47,320
Uh, they need to have like Anthony Hopkins just kind of like walking around with

906
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:51,240
a cane going like they've been here much longer than you think.

907
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:53,440
The Knights of Arthur, you know,

908
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:58,240
we're all of our new oddball choices.

909
00:45:58,520 --> 00:45:59,560
You have any proof of this, Mike?

910
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:03,000
The song Bumblebee plays at the end of transformers ride when he catches you.

911
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,600
And somebody says, is it give it to me, baby, by Rick James?

912
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:08,000
I've been trying to figure it out forever. And then somebody says,

913
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,720
doesn't he play? I feel good by James Brown. Yeah. So I guess

914
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:15,120
that little dude, wait, but then this, so somebody says, oh,

915
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:18,000
that's what it is. And then somebody play. Yes, that is give it to me, baby,

916
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,840
by Rick James. This is fascinating. I've, I, is this so weird?

917
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:26,520
Is this the dress? Is this the blue dress might be the blue dress in my head?

918
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:29,920
And I didn't go on it yesterday and maybe both songs are in it somehow,

919
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:33,320
but why, what I've always picked up on, I think it's,

920
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:37,920
I know you're right. Cause it's the, but I swear I've heard like,

921
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,720
give it to me. And like I've heard,

922
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:44,120
are there multiple choices somehow? Does this sound familiar to you at all?

923
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:44,960
Do you have any idea?

924
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:47,360
I don't think there are multiple choices.

925
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:50,920
I'm wondering if one song plays when he catches you and one song plays.

926
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:56,760
It might be that. Yeah. So, well, let's all just see each,

927
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:59,720
all three of us try to remember this when we're going like, what happens?

928
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:02,760
What should we do coming up? What should we do?

929
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:06,720
Wow. I was like, I was sure the first half of the ride yesterday,

930
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:09,840
I was sure we did an episode and then I went, I don't think we have.

931
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:10,680
We've just come up a lot.

932
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:14,320
We've just explored it and Optimus looms large with his being proud of you.

933
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:15,480
Yeah.

934
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:18,720
I do think this is if you're implying any sort of, like,

935
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:23,400
any Transformers is better than Rise of the Resistance, then you're a,

936
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:26,360
you're a nutball. I'll say it.

937
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:29,680
There is elements of Transformers that is better than Rise of the Resistance.

938
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:33,000
This is, this is heresy.

939
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:34,680
I really like, you've always been a little,

940
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:37,360
you've been a little anti-rise the whole time from episode,

941
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:38,800
from the first time we talked about it.

942
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:42,480
You're not wrong about that. I have been a little anti-rise of the resistance.

943
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:46,320
Yeah. But the strong parts of Transformers are also the strong parts of Spider-Man.

944
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:50,960
Oh yeah. Well that's no, I'm not denying that. No, but that's true. That's true.

945
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:54,560
I don't know if I don't think there's time right now for my full dissertation

946
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:55,880
after I've been on Rise so many times.

947
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:58,440
What's better in Transformers than Rise of the Resistance?

948
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:02,480
Well, you get a lot of FaceTime with the characters and.

949
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:06,440
I characters I don't know or like, or want FaceTime with.

950
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:08,840
Beside the point, beside the point.

951
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:11,480
I don't get any character. I want to see a face.

952
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:13,280
It doesn't matter who the face belongs to.

953
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:15,040
You get a lot of FaceTime with the characters.

954
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:20,320
There's a lot of action happening. I still find Rise of the Resistance a little empty.

955
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:24,480
I feel it's part of an empty journey, especially like when you're,

956
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:27,960
and it's part of it because just the size of it is so big and they can't do so

957
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:31,040
many robots, stormtroopers shooting at you, but it feels empty.

958
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:33,960
I want like a lot of stormtrooper activity and shooting,

959
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:35,960
and then you feel more like stuff is happening.

960
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:40,720
And I truly do believe that the smoothness of the ride takes

961
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:43,400
takes me out of it a little. Like, I feel like it's too smooth.

962
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:47,200
It doesn't feel like we're in as much jeopardy as we should feel like.

963
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:51,320
I think that was a big thing with when listening to Tony

964
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:53,520
and other people talk about Indiana Jones, they want to ride a vehicle

965
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:56,880
that felt like you were in the action a lot more.

966
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:59,600
So that's how they figured and developed that. A lot of jostle. Sure.

967
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:03,680
A lot of jostling, because that's the weird goofy feeling

968
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:07,480
you feel off of these rides after you're done, which tricks your brain

969
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:10,360
into thinking you were actually sort of in some danger.

970
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:12,960
Oh, and where you get off and feel a little wobbly.

971
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:14,920
Yes, I think a lot happened to you.

972
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:17,880
And you lose like a few brain cells because your brain shouldn't be

973
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:20,360
jostling around in your skull like that. Yeah.

974
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:25,080
So it's like I think that it could feel a little bit more fuller.

975
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:26,720
But obviously that's a lot more money.

976
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:31,080
And I think that with Rise, yeah, it's such a smooth ride.

977
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:35,000
That ride vehicle works really well on like Poo in Japan.

978
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:36,800
But a thrill ride being triagles.

979
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:39,920
But a thrill ride is a little different. I hear you. Here's my things.

980
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:43,640
It's that you are in physical environments does so much for me.

981
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:48,760
Transformers is such screen chaos that does make me kind of woozy.

982
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:53,160
And I would I would take smoother over.

983
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:56,120
Yeah. Just feeling insane from Transformers.

984
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:59,880
And like after like I have no idea where I went or what I did or why.

985
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:01,840
Yeah, I would. Yeah.

986
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:03,960
I mean, that's you're right about that.

987
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:08,240
And I don't have very much except for Optimus now, because I feel so like

988
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:10,320
he's such a father figure to me now.

989
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:13,240
I don't have much affection for the Transformers characters.

990
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:15,080
I do the Spider-Man characters.

991
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:17,560
But like, I I don't know what it is.

992
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:22,000
I don't know if it's that I like I see their like their faces are so clear

993
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,200
to me by the end of the ride.

994
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:25,200
I feel like I've hung out with all of them,

995
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:27,600
including the Spider-Man characters in Orlando.

996
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:29,080
Sure. You know what I'm like?

997
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:33,480
Spider-Man characters I love, but we don't get to see very many characters

998
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:35,200
on this Star Wars ride.

999
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:38,600
And obviously, yes, also, I'm a man in his later 30s

1000
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:40,840
who would like to see some of the old characters.

1001
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:43,000
But that's not even not what I'm talking about necessarily.

1002
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:45,320
Yeah. Jason, where do you land on any of this?

1003
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:50,040
I don't know. I mean, I think

1004
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:54,280
Rise of Resistance is very impressive.

1005
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:58,040
I'm sure I like it more than Mike.

1006
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:05,200
My big thing was riding Runaway Railway is that it's a lot of similar

1007
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:08,400
technology, but it is just so much more fun.

1008
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:11,040
It's a lot more fun. It's really fun.

1009
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:14,240
And I think there's lots of fun stuff.

1010
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:19,360
I think the most fun element in Rise of the Resistance is the escape pod drop.

1011
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:22,160
Yeah, because it's just such a switch.

1012
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:25,560
Big surprise. It's like, oh, my God, there's another ride element.

1013
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:28,200
There's another ride system in play.

1014
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:30,760
We've done so many at this point. Yeah. Yeah.

1015
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:34,240
That late in the game that they still have something up their sleeve.

1016
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:38,080
Yeah. And that it's telegraphed like there's like if you're really paying attention,

1017
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:41,480
you see the other ones in the far distance in the screen drop

1018
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:46,480
and then you drop like there's just so many little moments of delight.

1019
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:50,000
A little little or little little. OK.

1020
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,200
Just want to make sure.

1021
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:54,000
Either either in this case and then you come around.

1022
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,760
There's a happy ending because you see the you know, Lieutenant Beck's OK.

1023
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:00,960
Like, yeah, of all the everything you're describing,

1024
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:03,160
I like so much more than anything in Transformers.

1025
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:06,760
I cannot go along with you on my favorite part of the Rise of Resistance

1026
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:10,720
is the pre show with Lieutenant Beck. Yeah, because there's a character,

1027
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:12,040
Mon Calamari in there.

1028
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:14,000
You can get right up on top of him.

1029
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,400
I mean, not on top of it.

1030
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:17,600
Not yet. He shows up.

1031
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:19,680
I want them to let me get on top of him.

1032
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:24,440
He shows up in audio form like when you are trying to escape.

1033
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:27,120
Yeah. But I bet one more animatronic

1034
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:30,320
Lieutenant Beck in the middle would be nice.

1035
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:32,040
I saw a lot of your problem. Yeah.

1036
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:35,760
And like Finn, like Finn, no one even unless you know where to look.

1037
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:37,680
You go, hey, do you see Finn on the ride?

1038
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:40,240
And people go, what? Yes. Yeah.

1039
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:41,800
Where was he?

1040
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:44,240
And you're like, well, there's a box and it was far away.

1041
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:47,080
And he was, you know, it's something I kind of like that the Finn

1042
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:49,120
animatronic is not that great.

1043
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:51,560
It reminds me of the ET cops.

1044
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:53,640
It's obviously better than those.

1045
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:57,560
But I like like what the what the ET ride was able to get away with.

1046
00:52:58,360 --> 00:52:59,960
That's a glorified mannequin.

1047
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:03,960
Yeah, that's kind of how with Finn's inability to move his body

1048
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:07,920
and then that he's off in a corner, it's there's something kind of like

1049
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:09,680
retro and charming to me about it.

1050
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:11,960
Yeah, I don't dislike it.

1051
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:14,240
I just it's like no one even knows where to look.

1052
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:18,120
I've had many people were like after riding it, not many, a couple

1053
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:20,880
where I go, yeah, then Finn, the Finn animatronic, like a what?

1054
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,320
What are you talking about?

1055
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:24,320
I go, yeah, he was like behind the box.

1056
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:26,040
Does he move? He might not move.

1057
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:28,920
He might be a statue, like the Incredible Statues.

1058
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:31,160
Or I think there's some at Universal, too, where like,

1059
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:35,040
I kind of don't mind the stat, like the little statues.

1060
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:39,000
If you have enough lighting, you got to hit those little, little,

1061
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:40,280
little statue.

1062
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:43,480
I I kind of don't mind them if the lighting cues are good.

1063
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:47,800
Like, yeah, I prefer a statue with a decent lighting set up.

1064
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:52,440
Then just a screen that might, you know, it's not going to be like those

1065
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:55,920
avatar screens where it's like, oh, they got to keep James happy.

1066
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:59,000
They got to keep those screens looking good if they're going to leave them in there.

1067
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,160
You know? Yeah, sure.

1068
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:02,240
But yeah, I know that's just a part.

1069
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:06,080
Yeah, partly me pining for this version of the ride is

1070
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:08,600
because it's got more of the old characters.

1071
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:13,480
But also it does feel like it solves a problem that I'm talking about,

1072
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:17,080
where it's like you get like a cool it's almost like what I what you want

1073
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:20,120
from something like is this the cars model, the Cars Land model,

1074
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:24,120
where you do get like great show scenes and then the parallel elements

1075
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:26,240
are and it's very much from the movie.

1076
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:28,160
But it feels like its own thing.

1077
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:30,120
It doesn't just feel like you're stepping through.

1078
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:35,600
There's that tricky balance they have to strike of you get everything

1079
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:38,960
that's in the movie, but it's not just taking you through the plot of the movie.

1080
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:40,360
And that is my concern.

1081
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:44,640
Looking at this, what this ride might have been is that if we're

1082
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:48,080
if it's Darth Vader, we're going past the Darth Vader fight

1083
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:50,160
and we're seeing the Death Star blow.

1084
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:54,360
Are we not in just we're passing by the things that happened in Star Wars,

1085
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:55,480
which would be cool.

1086
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:56,760
It would certainly be cool.

1087
00:54:56,760 --> 00:55:00,560
But I feel like they I'd be so curious what the story was in their head.

1088
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:04,480
Yeah, they don't say what it is exactly that happens on this.

1089
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:09,240
But I mean, there would be some loose, loose explanation, I assume,

1090
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:12,800
of like either you're going through like famous things that happened

1091
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:16,320
or you're like assisting in moments or something.

1092
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:19,040
I don't know. Sure. Sure. Yeah.

1093
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:21,080
I assume you're assisting if you're force sensitive. Sorry.

1094
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:24,280
Oh, I just don't want to forget to mention the third attraction

1095
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:28,160
that would have gone in this in the crystals would have been

1096
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:32,160
the early pitch on Alien and Counter. Right.

1097
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:33,920
Yeah. Seemingly before

1098
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:40,360
the it was the Nostromo before it was supposed to be even before the Alien.

1099
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:41,840
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1100
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:42,920
I didn't see that.

1101
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:45,600
Yeah, I didn't I didn't see that mentioned.

1102
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:49,560
I think the apocryphal story is that they got the rights to use Alien.

1103
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:53,480
They realized this would be way too scary for like an alien encounter.

1104
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:56,200
So they stuck it in the great movie ride. Right. Right.

1105
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:58,840
Because both those movies were pretty big.

1106
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:01,240
And this isn't also this isn't Cameron Port.

1107
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:04,720
This is no, which is all, by the way, an awesome would be awesome.

1108
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:08,760
I mean, Cameron Port, though Lucas would go on to consult on the

1109
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:12,080
the version of the Alien and Counter that came out. Right.

1110
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:13,280
Yeah. You forget he was.

1111
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:16,120
That's weird. Part of Alien and Counter in some way, too.

1112
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:18,880
Yeah. And so it it would have been interesting.

1113
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:21,680
There's a good review time video on this.

1114
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:25,440
And I think a thing they point out that's really interesting

1115
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:30,960
is that Alien and Counter, when built in Florida, had to fit in that space.

1116
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:35,440
And but if they had built it from scratch here in the Lucasport

1117
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:41,120
project, they could have made a massive like or multiple massive auditory.

1118
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:44,560
Like it could have been totally different. Sure. Sure.

1119
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:46,800
But a similar concept. Right. Right.

1120
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:51,000
I mean, this this thing looked it looked really neat.

1121
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:55,720
It would be I mean, if we had a locked in time, mid 80s

1122
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:58,280
Star Wars. Oh, yeah.

1123
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:02,160
With with animatronics from that era, there would be a certain

1124
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:06,560
there's a version of this that happened where it's an untouchable classic.

1125
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:08,760
And that's the definitive Star Wars ride.

1126
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:12,240
Yeah. Other than like the track needing to be replaced.

1127
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:16,200
I think, yeah, it would be really hard to demolish

1128
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:19,600
this in the same way that it's kind of still hard to demolish.

1129
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:23,360
Like they can't the you have to keep the fantasy land dark rides

1130
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:26,760
for some sort of like reverence to the past.

1131
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:29,160
I mean, obviously, like like it's for kids.

1132
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:31,160
Those are kids rides primarily.

1133
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:33,560
But yeah, it's so hypothetical.

1134
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:38,200
Like either if this had gotten done, is this just Disneyland classic?

1135
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:41,000
And then there's Lucas ports at the other parks.

1136
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,680
Or is this just an unachievable?

1137
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:47,280
I kind of think they ran the numbers on this quickly and realized

1138
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:51,240
this was not going to I bet this was not on the table for very long.

1139
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:54,640
Yeah, I guess. I mean, obviously, like they had models and stuff.

1140
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:58,080
So they put some work this because there's some stuff you come across

1141
00:57:58,080 --> 00:58:00,720
that seem more like ideas and one drawing of it.

1142
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:02,800
But it seemed like it got pretty far.

1143
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:07,040
But you would think that you'd ran the numbers on the ride itself

1144
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:09,280
and then didn't do anything.

1145
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:12,680
Yeah. Yeah. Centerpiece is essentially impossible to do.

1146
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:15,880
And yeah, because that would be the rest that would, I'm sure,

1147
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:17,920
be like the impetus for doing it is like this

1148
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:21,040
the craziest ticket we've ever built. Yeah.

1149
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:23,840
Had a very interesting like

1150
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:28,440
afterlife or half life where it's like if you notice in the model,

1151
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:30,520
it says welcome to venture port.

1152
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:34,360
Which I believe is what they were going to call this whole structure.

1153
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:37,320
Well, that if not Lucas, it seems like they were debating.

1154
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:40,240
Yeah. This port is that too weird and personal to him

1155
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:44,160
or is adventure port and venture port as a name?

1156
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:49,080
It comes up again in Westcott is just like the central area of Westcott.

1157
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:51,840
But then it also comes up as its own second gate.

1158
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:56,240
Yes, they were debating doing a second gate at Disneyland

1159
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:59,600
that would have had, you know, it would have had all this Lucas

1160
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:01,680
port stuff that didn't get built.

1161
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:03,720
Yeah. I was going to you probably were going to say the same.

1162
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:06,560
I was going to have a figment and dream finder thing.

1163
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:11,280
Wow. At Disneyland, Indiana Jones and Jules Verne area. Right.

1164
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:13,480
So all of that. Yeah.

1165
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:18,000
You know, the long planned discovery base sort of like this would have been.

1166
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,480
I mean, this all would have been Baxter.

1167
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:21,240
I was going to say this is Baxter land.

1168
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:24,480
If you've got Jules Verne in there, that's his number one guy.

1169
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:27,480
Indy stuff. That's all his stuff. Yeah.

1170
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:29,760
So like that would have been a version of Westcott.

1171
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:33,360
And then when I was reading that, I was like, do I want Westcott more?

1172
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:36,000
Do I want venture port more?

1173
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,640
I was like, it was a tough.

1174
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:39,440
I don't know that I even have a good answer.

1175
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:41,480
And this is separate from Discovery Bay.

1176
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:42,680
That's a different project.

1177
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:47,200
The hypothetical projects are so fascinating, even to our land 98

1178
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:51,680
before budget cuts like could have been cool, could have been cool.

1179
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:54,000
I wasn't against the notion of it.

1180
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:57,680
It just sort of every step of it turned out so badly.

1181
00:59:57,720 --> 00:59:59,000
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

1182
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:02,320
So so venture port would have been.

1183
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:05,240
Yeah, I guess they were just taking these designs and like, well,

1184
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:07,600
if you're not going to do in tomorrow, and maybe we can get more money

1185
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:10,320
for a full new park.

1186
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:12,520
And then, yeah, like Indy would have been over there.

1187
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:13,480
I think Indy would.

1188
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:16,880
And then maybe with more stuff around it, because Indy also has a full

1189
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:19,080
version of it's a bigger can.

1190
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:20,440
Maybe there's multiple rides.

1191
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:22,760
Yeah. Big Indy show set.

1192
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:26,160
So, yeah, I was like, I was like, because like Westcott,

1193
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:29,520
which we've talked a little bit about, which had its own like world showcase

1194
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:32,840
and the hotels seem very cool and the way you could like

1195
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:36,200
hang out there 24 hours a day, which is what we all want.

1196
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:41,160
And there was like a crazy 45 minute boat ride that took you around the park

1197
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:42,920
through tons of robots.

1198
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:46,680
But big crystal thing in the Star Wars, you take it.

1199
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:49,320
Mm hmm. Tough decision.

1200
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:50,800
I don't know. I don't have to make it.

1201
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:54,760
But Baxter has the best unbuilt slate.

1202
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:56,560
Everything you've ever heard that he wanted.

1203
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:59,240
Yeah. It didn't get done is so incredible.

1204
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:02,320
Yeah. But then, you know, a lot of Tokyo Disney, Tokyo,

1205
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:04,240
DCC does have lots of jewels, very stuff.

1206
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:07,200
It does have a more built out Indiana Jones area.

1207
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:09,920
So, yeah. So some of that is fulfilled.

1208
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:11,600
Yeah. He was correct.

1209
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:16,080
Like whatever comfort that likely gives that everyone's wanted to like

1210
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:19,760
the version that they did of what he wanted to do is the most beautiful

1211
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:21,200
theme park in the world.

1212
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:23,520
Yeah. It's truly next level.

1213
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:26,000
Yeah. And it's interesting.

1214
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,080
I don't know. Like interesting to think also.

1215
01:01:29,080 --> 01:01:34,680
Again, if they built this, would this be how dated would this look now?

1216
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:36,400
Yeah, it could be.

1217
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:39,280
Again, I would love it so much.

1218
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:44,000
There's there's concept art they did of the interiors of the atriums

1219
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,280
and the little bridges.

1220
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:49,960
And it looks so much like that star tours campus that I loved in Tokyo.

1221
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:50,960
Yeah, yeah. A lot.

1222
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:56,080
It is like such great 80s future and like, I don't know, it's all.

1223
01:01:56,720 --> 01:02:01,000
What do I even like? It's just like pipes, narrow corridors and blocky.

1224
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:04,160
And I mean that I have to remind myself I don't.

1225
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:07,000
I'm worried now that they're going to do something to that area.

1226
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,880
I don't think it's part of the Space Mountain thing.

1227
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:10,640
But it's but I'm worried. Yeah.

1228
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:15,080
I don't want Tony Solaroni going anywhere in those brick is that that area.

1229
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:16,520
Rules. Yeah.

1230
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:19,960
I saw a couple of people talking about like, that's a lot of money

1231
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:21,600
just to do Space Mountain.

1232
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:25,280
Like this could be a full tomorrow land like maybe.

1233
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:28,680
And I I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't show any of that.

1234
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:30,880
They just show kind of the courtyard. Yeah.

1235
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:32,960
Out front. Right. Yeah.

1236
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:33,960
Yeah. Please don't tell them.

1237
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:37,760
Don't tell me. I hope tomorrow and Astro zone is going anywhere.

1238
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:43,000
I don't know. I would I would mentally prepare for it in 2028.

1239
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,840
Whatever that's. Yeah.

1240
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:46,600
I got to go back one more time.

1241
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:48,120
You should go back. OK.

1242
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:52,960
It is strange because some stuff like I don't know that there's a there's a ton

1243
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:56,000
of design styles that you would call timeless.

1244
01:02:56,360 --> 01:03:00,040
But like stuff always comes back around.

1245
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:03,720
And I feel like mid century modern, if it ever starts to dip out of style,

1246
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:05,480
it comes back around so fast.

1247
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:09,400
I mean, that seems to be a lot of the design elements coming to downtown Disney.

1248
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:12,800
Yeah. Of like this is a throwback, but it's a throwback

1249
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:14,920
that just keeps coming back in style.

1250
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:16,760
Yeah. You know, you always keep landing.

1251
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:21,800
And but this like a super 80s new edition in tomorrow

1252
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:23,960
and might feel a little. Yeah.

1253
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:25,320
Could be a little dated. Yeah.

1254
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:29,120
Yeah. Depending on there's there's actually some like this art to me

1255
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:32,920
looks a little more timeless if you can see that, which is like the main piece.

1256
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:37,640
But then the other like there's another piece of art that has the the Astro

1257
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:39,520
jet or whatever the hell they're.

1258
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:43,120
And that looks like if I go, I can imagine how that looks.

1259
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:45,240
Just like an old convention center.

1260
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:48,080
Yeah. 30 years later, I could imagine people going like,

1261
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:51,000
so it doesn't look any like so good anymore. Sure.

1262
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,480
Yeah. Like that looks less mad.

1263
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:56,680
This picture looks a lot less cool and magical than that big,

1264
01:03:56,680 --> 01:03:59,240
beautiful picture of the whole land.

1265
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:01,480
Yeah. Right. Right. Yeah.

1266
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:06,120
So, you know, original Star Tours still has kind of a caked in mid 80s

1267
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:08,040
that I don't think bothers.

1268
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:08,800
Yeah, no, that's true.

1269
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:09,960
That's true. Super.

1270
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:14,120
You know, they did kind of a refresh and modernized it and screened it up

1271
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:17,520
a little bit. But, you know, just the lobby and exterior and everything.

1272
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:19,280
Yeah. Out of place.

1273
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:23,520
Really, this whole I guess you have Lucas port to thank for Star Tours

1274
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:28,640
because it caused them to do the math of how do we do a Star Wars ride?

1275
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:30,120
Well, you'd have to have all of these.

1276
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:33,040
There's so much universe you want to explore in so many different planets.

1277
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:34,480
How do you do all of that?

1278
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:36,080
We don't have the space to do it.

1279
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:38,200
Well, is there some way to do it in a small space?

1280
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:40,520
Thus, they find flight simulators.

1281
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:42,400
Thus, Star Tours gets done.

1282
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:46,680
Yeah. So they did like this all is the the homework, the path

1283
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:49,760
they had to go down to get to an amazing ride.

1284
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:53,640
Yeah, it is so crazy, though, when you think of how small and scope

1285
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:55,840
it ended up being, how big it was.

1286
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:58,600
And then like it was like a room, essentially.

1287
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:01,960
Yeah. Yeah. The craziest, biggest thing with all the characters as robots.

1288
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:04,560
And then a tiny little room

1289
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:07,360
moves with like none of the care.

1290
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:11,080
I mean, obviously some in the in the queue, but no characters basically.

1291
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:12,720
Yeah, yeah. R2 and T3PO.

1292
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:17,160
But then it's it's Rex, a great new, great new character,

1293
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:18,880
which no can't be mad about that.

1294
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:23,720
But it is funny to think about how small it got from how the blue sky phase.

1295
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:26,720
Yeah. But it's all fascinating.

1296
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:28,880
I mean, just the art is jaw dropping.

1297
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:30,880
I'm so glad it leaked.

1298
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:33,440
It's very cool to see it.

1299
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:35,440
And I just like those logo, the logos of.

1300
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:36,160
Oh, yeah.

1301
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:37,880
Venture Porter are awesome.

1302
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:40,480
I would. I mean, I know we're not.

1303
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:42,520
We maybe could talk to Tony Baxter again one day.

1304
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:45,600
I don't think we'll ever get to talk to George, but I would love some

1305
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:49,480
like tall commentary from George about what his ideas

1306
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:51,120
or what his thoughts were at the time.

1307
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:53,960
But he also this might have been like, here's what we have planned.

1308
01:05:53,960 --> 01:05:55,440
He's like, I don't know.

1309
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:56,200
How's the end of it?

1310
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:58,640
You know, we have no idea how involved he was in Luka.

1311
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:00,200
This might have been presented to him.

1312
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:02,360
Here's what I really here's what I want.

1313
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:06,360
I want Charlie Rose to be uncancelled for a day and interview George.

1314
01:06:06,560 --> 01:06:08,400
George seems to like talking to Charlie Rose.

1315
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:09,360
A perfect pair. Yes.

1316
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:11,280
Canceled Charlie again at the end of the day.

1317
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:13,360
Yeah, then he's back to cancel back to cancel.

1318
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:17,840
But George and Charlie just talk about Lucas Port for two hours.

1319
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:21,120
I just went in with Better Call Saul back.

1320
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:24,880
I was going back into Breaking Bad, and it's so funny that in the finale of

1321
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:25,840
well, the Charlie Rose.

1322
01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:26,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1323
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:27,680
The last episode.

1324
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:31,440
But then in the final episode that Walt shows up at Gretchen and Elliott's house

1325
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:34,400
and I saw you on Charlie Rose yesterday.

1326
01:06:35,480 --> 01:06:37,200
Charlie Rose is part of that.

1327
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:39,200
He is in the Breaking Bad.

1328
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:42,040
So every in like Better Call Saul, everything you're watching.

1329
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:44,240
Just keep in mind, Charlie Rose is out there.

1330
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:45,520
Yeah, he doesn't show up.

1331
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:49,520
We haven't seen him on TV, but like it just let him lurk

1332
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:52,320
like a ghost over everything that happens in Better Call Saul.

1333
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:56,120
I mean, they're saying it's going to link up with Breaking Bad a lot more as we go

1334
01:06:56,120 --> 01:06:58,160
on here. So I think it had he Charlie.

1335
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:01,400
All right. He can be uncancelled for two days.

1336
01:07:02,040 --> 01:07:04,760
The one to shoot his cameo on Better Call Saul.

1337
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:06,800
Look, I don't approve of what the guy did.

1338
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:08,160
No part of the story.

1339
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:12,200
No, my Vince Gilligan, that just sounds like Jimmy Buffett.

1340
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:13,720
No, you're right.

1341
01:07:13,720 --> 01:07:15,120
There's a piece.

1342
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:17,560
Someone showed me a photo of him with Jimmy Buffett.

1343
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:19,360
And I'm trying to remember Jim.

1344
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:21,880
Well, that makes it. Oh, they'd be thick as thieves.

1345
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:23,440
I think the same voice.

1346
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:27,280
Maybe that's why your plane got shot down by the Jamaican government.

1347
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:29,800
Wow. I got a time to turn that into my next show.

1348
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:32,120
Yeah, we could get Frank.

1349
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:34,800
I think Frank Bama could be one of Saul's clients.

1350
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:38,480
And please, while Jimmy is still with us, like, let's

1351
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:42,120
let's explore the Buffett verse with Kevin Gilligan behind the wheel.

1352
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:46,040
Better Call Saul is going to finally link up to the Jimmy Buffett verse.

1353
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:47,520
Better closer than you've ever seen.

1354
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:51,000
Saul's going to find Joe Merchant.

1355
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,240
Let me see if I can Google this, if this exists.

1356
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:56,360
A photo of Gilligan and.

1357
01:07:56,360 --> 01:07:58,560
Well, what else do we have to address here?

1358
01:07:58,560 --> 01:08:01,760
I mean, well, I guess we bring up a good an interesting point,

1359
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:08,280
which is devoting land to an auteur to an auteur filmmaker.

1360
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:09,640
Oh, yeah, here it is. It's available.

1361
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:11,320
It's Jimmy and Vince. Oh, wow.

1362
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:13,360
On set, I think. On set of what?

1363
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:15,320
Of Saul or Breaking Bad, I think.

1364
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:17,320
He came and visited. Yeah.

1365
01:08:19,240 --> 01:08:21,600
Got it. He should contribute an original song.

1366
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:23,760
Oh, man. Yeah, I think I think this might be.

1367
01:08:23,760 --> 01:08:26,680
Unless Vince was his visiting him on the set of Hawaii.

1368
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:29,000
Oh, no, no, no. It's on Saul.

1369
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,120
It's going. Jimmy.

1370
01:08:30,120 --> 01:08:33,520
Jimmy's caption is this 2015 going Hollywood in Albuquerque

1371
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:35,720
with Vince Gilligan on the set of Better Call Saul.

1372
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:37,960
Wow. Jimmy was there.

1373
01:08:37,960 --> 01:08:39,320
They didn't get him in the show.

1374
01:08:39,320 --> 01:08:40,560
Vince, come on.

1375
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:44,120
They should standardize that the only way that he ever does cameos

1376
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:48,000
is running away, holding a couple of margaritas like in Jurassic World.

1377
01:08:48,480 --> 01:08:52,320
There should be some scene where the cartel rolls into somewhere,

1378
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:56,520
opens fire and he ducks away, holding a bunch of margaritas.

1379
01:08:56,520 --> 01:08:58,720
What a good idea. I was just enjoying my desert Airbnb

1380
01:08:58,720 --> 01:09:00,600
and then this Winnebago blew up.

1381
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:05,000
The first caption, this is on Facebook for some reason.

1382
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:09,040
The first or the first comment is from a lady and she just wrote,

1383
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:10,960
now, that's two handsome men.

1384
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,040
And I can't disagree.

1385
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:17,120
Bam. You're not wrong.

1386
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:18,360
Thank you so much.

1387
01:09:18,360 --> 01:09:19,400
They share the same voice.

1388
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:20,400
They got the same voice.

1389
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:22,240
A handsome voice. Yeah.

1390
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:25,400
I created Better Call Saul.

1391
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:28,600
405 in an out burger.

1392
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:30,520
Better Call Saul.

1393
01:09:30,520 --> 01:09:33,800
You know, it's interesting to think about, like, if Lucas

1394
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:36,840
Board had been built, because Space Mountain had already been opened

1395
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:42,160
when they would have been working on this, that that means Tomorrowland,

1396
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:46,080
this hypothetical Tomorrowland would have ended up with two roller coasters,

1397
01:09:46,480 --> 01:09:53,320
a concept we are just now start getting around to in 2022.

1398
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:57,040
Yeah, yeah. God willing, with Tron and Tron and Space Mountain in Florida.

1399
01:09:57,040 --> 01:09:59,360
Yeah, roller coasters can go next to each other.

1400
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:01,360
Yes. Never believe that they can't.

1401
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:02,920
I know I am.

1402
01:10:02,920 --> 01:10:05,920
I have to say that Japan news, I am a little surprised

1403
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:09,800
a Space Mountain is being demolished, even with the idea of like,

1404
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:12,080
we can do better.

1405
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:16,360
One, I think maybe I'm just a little thrown by the optimism,

1406
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:21,560
by like the like iterating just because like, it seems like it's time.

1407
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:23,560
You know? Yeah, sure.

1408
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:26,400
Yeah, we're used to a certain.

1409
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:29,560
You've been. Yeah, you've been let down so many times here.

1410
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:30,440
You're used to it.

1411
01:10:30,440 --> 01:10:34,480
Yeah, especially because it's just like the newest DOW or media thing is like,

1412
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:37,440
well, streaming services are tightening their belts.

1413
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:40,400
You know, it's like it might be the end of pumping out.

1414
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:43,440
You know, investors are running for the hills.

1415
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:45,520
Let's talk about more fun stuff than that.

1416
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:52,080
But then it affects the thinking of the other wings of these massive.

1417
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:54,720
I know. I understand that.

1418
01:10:54,720 --> 01:10:58,080
But Universal's having great success with their parks recently.

1419
01:10:58,080 --> 01:10:59,400
Yeah, the parks are doing great.

1420
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:01,360
Peacocks in the toilet.

1421
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:05,120
Jason, no more talk of the industry drying up.

1422
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:09,520
Make it a loss leader like those hotel rooms, those cheap hotel rooms they built.

1423
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:12,920
Let's talk about and we should each have one comedy pitch

1424
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:16,480
and one legit pitch for director based lands.

1425
01:11:16,720 --> 01:11:19,120
That's what I think we should do.

1426
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:22,080
Obviously, I'm going to go with my I won't tell you which one is which,

1427
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:25,480
but I think I'll I'll first throw out Smithland Smithport,

1428
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:33,000
which you got the quick stop there, which is a convenience store and in

1429
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:37,160
pro in the same way, like on Galaxy's Edge would have performers with their own

1430
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:41,240
language, you know, and they would they would say, you know, one of them would say

1431
01:11:41,240 --> 01:11:43,840
they didn't have to they weren't even supposed to be there today.

1432
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:47,440
That would be what one person had to say every time you check out

1433
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:52,040
there and there would have to be, you know, we can all think of I haven't.

1434
01:11:52,160 --> 01:11:54,320
This is I'm doing this off the top of my head here.

1435
01:11:54,760 --> 01:11:58,160
But, you know, you would have, you know, dogma ride.

1436
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:01,040
There would be a practical rubber poop monster.

1437
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:04,160
Well, racing to the to get into the cathedral.

1438
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:05,960
Yes. Yes.

1439
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:08,040
While the loophole is still in effect.

1440
01:12:08,040 --> 01:12:11,200
Yes. Rickman, Alan Rickman, animatronic.

1441
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:15,400
Yeah. From from that race through the streets of Trenton.

1442
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:19,480
Race to the streets of Newark.

1443
01:12:19,480 --> 01:12:24,440
Yes. There should be a ride that simulates his career where you can decide

1444
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:27,880
do something new or go back to the old shit again.

1445
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:29,120
Back to the present.

1446
01:12:29,240 --> 01:12:30,680
Oh, shit again. Oh, shit again.

1447
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:32,040
View a skewniverse. Yes.

1448
01:12:32,040 --> 01:12:36,520
So there's a there's a button one button says view a skewniverse again

1449
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:38,880
or Jersey girl.

1450
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:43,520
And I would hit Jersey girl because I remember Jersey girl being sort of charming.

1451
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:45,320
But I thought it was all right.

1452
01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:48,280
You could read this and probably you got some you got a ride there.

1453
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:52,640
I don't know what type of ride it is, but definitely have a ride called the Dick Poner.

1454
01:12:53,960 --> 01:12:57,840
Now, got to tribute the Ticket is based on the tweet.

1455
01:12:58,360 --> 01:12:59,920
That's the big.

1456
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:02,440
That's the big. Yeah.

1457
01:13:02,440 --> 01:13:04,720
Yeah. That's the big ride.

1458
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:07,520
If you don't know what we're talking about, just look up Kevin Smith, the tweet.

1459
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:09,120
And I'm assuming it'll pop up.

1460
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:11,240
I got to be the first one.

1461
01:13:11,240 --> 01:13:12,720
Strap in for an experience.

1462
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:16,000
It's like boning like you're cheating on each other with each other.

1463
01:13:16,120 --> 01:13:17,320
That's right.

1464
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:21,920
And you know what? That ride is going to age well, because 10 years in.

1465
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:24,320
Still, there's still

1466
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:27,400
there's at least 10 years of life in that.

1467
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:28,680
Yeah. Yeah.

1468
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:30,400
You're right. OK.

1469
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:33,080
They're skip 15 seconds ahead if you're easily offended.

1470
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:37,840
Please keep your hands, arms and clit brown, taint areas inside the vehicle.

1471
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:45,120
I mean, we could all pitch, but I think that's the

1472
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:47,880
real stick. I don't know.

1473
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:51,160
If you've returned to the office and you're listening to this on speakers,

1474
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:53,480
congratulations, you're being sent home.

1475
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:56,680
I gave a warning.

1476
01:13:56,680 --> 01:13:58,280
That's fair. That's fair.

1477
01:13:58,280 --> 01:14:00,080
Smithport.

1478
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:02,360
All right. Get building Smithport.

1479
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:03,800
I have a pitch. Yeah.

1480
01:14:03,800 --> 01:14:05,960
Oh, yeah. Port Thomas Anderson.

1481
01:14:06,720 --> 01:14:08,040
Oh, OK.

1482
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:09,720
So you got to explore.

1483
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:14,360
I mean, the you know, there's a bibbidi bopbidi boutique

1484
01:14:14,360 --> 01:14:20,440
style shopping experience where you enter the house of Woodcock from Phantom Thread.

1485
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:25,000
And you this actually got branching pathways.

1486
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:28,960
So you either go to the like dress fitting experience

1487
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:33,640
where you get like an immaculate couture dress made for you or you get the

1488
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:40,240
I'm working or romantically involved with Woodcock experience

1489
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:42,320
where it's like a nightmare.

1490
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:46,680
But then towards the end, you realize that like you can control this nightmare.

1491
01:14:46,680 --> 01:14:48,920
Like maybe it's a nightmare both ways.

1492
01:14:48,920 --> 01:14:51,040
You get to eat the special.

1493
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:54,760
And of course, the food you get to eat the special mushrooms.

1494
01:14:54,760 --> 01:14:55,960
Oh, man. You're flat.

1495
01:14:55,960 --> 01:14:58,600
And it's like and the long order and the bacon.

1496
01:14:58,600 --> 01:15:00,560
Yeah. And then you can.

1497
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:04,040
I mean, you got to like even galaxy says his t-shirt.

1498
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:06,840
So you can have a buy t-shirt that says like

1499
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:11,720
I went to Port Thomas Anderson and all I got was flat on my back.

1500
01:15:11,720 --> 01:15:15,080
Sick with docile, you know, like whatever she says about him.

1501
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:18,840
I you know, there's other stuff.

1502
01:15:18,840 --> 01:15:22,920
There's a there'll be an attraction where you can beat up a bathroom

1503
01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:25,160
like from punch, drunk love.

1504
01:15:25,160 --> 01:15:26,840
It resets itself. Yeah.

1505
01:15:26,840 --> 01:15:27,760
Yeah. Screens.

1506
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:28,800
You just like, yeah.

1507
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:30,360
And you get the score at the end.

1508
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:32,480
What else did you beat up the bathroom?

1509
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:36,000
Mm hmm. I like what I like about this is this is all like modest budget.

1510
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:37,400
I think, too. You can do this.

1511
01:15:37,400 --> 01:15:40,200
You don't have to do a biggie tickets like the Kevin Smith

1512
01:15:40,760 --> 01:15:42,280
tweet ride is any ticket.

1513
01:15:42,280 --> 01:15:44,480
It's a massive, massive show building.

1514
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:46,040
It's a little more.

1515
01:15:46,040 --> 01:15:50,360
Maybe there's some more interactive, like theater elements.

1516
01:15:50,440 --> 01:15:56,000
You know, I the licensing on inherent vice might get a little complicated

1517
01:15:56,640 --> 01:16:01,680
or there will be blood that I feel like you could do a ride.

1518
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:03,680
You could do like a scene by scene.

1519
01:16:03,680 --> 01:16:04,960
There will be blood ride.

1520
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:06,960
Well, you could feel I mean, Geyser Mountain.

1521
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:09,560
They you do you do guys are out there.

1522
01:16:09,560 --> 01:16:11,080
We got blasted out of an oil well.

1523
01:16:11,080 --> 01:16:15,960
But then also a bowling alley where you're doing bowling.

1524
01:16:15,960 --> 01:16:20,920
But then part of it is to like escape without Daniel bludgeoning you to getting

1525
01:16:20,920 --> 01:16:21,840
smashed. Yeah.

1526
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:26,920
Milk. Yeah. You can have the mushrooms, omelet and the milkshake.

1527
01:16:27,160 --> 01:16:32,240
You know, and then like you do like superstar television, Boogie Nights style

1528
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:38,640
show where your mom and dad get picked to come out of the audience.

1529
01:16:39,240 --> 01:16:42,160
And then it's like, you know, you get you get where it goes from there.

1530
01:16:42,280 --> 01:16:46,360
Yeah. And Hard Eight Casino.

1531
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:49,680
OK, sure. There's a walk around Sydney.

1532
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:51,680
Yeah. Yeah.

1533
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:54,120
It's fantastic.

1534
01:16:54,120 --> 01:16:58,120
And then just a stage of Hame impersonators.

1535
01:16:58,320 --> 01:16:59,280
Oh, Haim. Haim.

1536
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:00,640
Excuse me. I never get it right.

1537
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:05,040
Haim impersonate like Haim face character Haim sisters.

1538
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:11,040
Reenacting the videos in front of like a screen like the

1539
01:17:11,720 --> 01:17:14,320
Mandalorian screen set.

1540
01:17:14,360 --> 01:17:18,320
So it looks like they're walking down Ventura Boulevard by the book.

1541
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:21,200
Oh, yeah. By the one Barnes and Nobles with a marquee.

1542
01:17:22,040 --> 01:17:25,880
They can slide different streets, different valleys, different parts of the

1543
01:17:25,880 --> 01:17:27,800
San Fernando Valley. Yeah, that's great.

1544
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:30,480
What do I want to do?

1545
01:17:31,160 --> 01:17:32,760
Let's get let's do Kelly Port.

1546
01:17:32,760 --> 01:17:34,920
Let's do a Richard Kelly.

1547
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:37,520
Yes. I thought you were either going David E.

1548
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:39,320
Kelly. Oh, that sounds good.

1549
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:42,040
Then you get is that like Ali McBeal?

1550
01:17:42,040 --> 01:17:43,120
L.A. law.

1551
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:46,160
I mean, hey, why not?

1552
01:17:46,160 --> 01:17:47,120
Yeah. Sorry.

1553
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:49,680
You know, well, all the Kelly's can be in this.

1554
01:17:49,680 --> 01:17:50,760
So you choose a path.

1555
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:55,480
Do you go to David Kellyport and get to have a big party with the dancing baby?

1556
01:17:56,240 --> 01:17:59,760
Or do you go to Richard Kellyport and get on the mega zeppelin

1557
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:02,760
from the finale of Southland Tales?

1558
01:18:03,200 --> 01:18:05,960
Finally live your own Southland Tale.

1559
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:09,240
Yeah. And and that, too.

1560
01:18:09,240 --> 01:18:13,080
There's a superstar limo of or not a superstar, a superstar television of

1561
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:16,360
where you get inserted into a porn with.

1562
01:18:16,360 --> 01:18:18,800
Oh, right. Right. Sarah Michelle Geller. Right.

1563
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:20,280
Sure. What's her name?

1564
01:18:20,280 --> 01:18:23,040
I can't. As if anyone would know.

1565
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:25,760
Get your Southland Tales knowledge out.

1566
01:18:25,880 --> 01:18:27,000
Get the body. He did.

1567
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,800
Krista Kapowski, Krista now, obviously.

1568
01:18:29,880 --> 01:18:32,360
Oh, of course. Yeah, of course. Of course. Of course.

1569
01:18:32,360 --> 01:18:36,440
Oh, it's like I was really I had an intimate moment with boxer Santeros.

1570
01:18:36,680 --> 01:18:41,080
Boxer Santeros, I probably could have pulled if I sat here

1571
01:18:42,680 --> 01:18:44,200
long enough.

1572
01:18:44,200 --> 01:18:47,680
The I mean, you get to live the experience of the box.

1573
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:52,880
2009 adaptation of that in the box short story, you get to open the box,

1574
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:56,520
you know, where it's like you get one million dollars if you press the button.

1575
01:18:56,520 --> 01:18:58,040
But someone dies.

1576
01:18:58,040 --> 01:18:59,480
Hmm. I don't like Richard.

1577
01:18:59,480 --> 01:19:00,840
He stole Boxer Santero.

1578
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:03,480
Boxer Santeros was a cut pod racer.

1579
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:05,240
He stole it.

1580
01:19:06,680 --> 01:19:09,480
Oh, man. It should be all directors from now on.

1581
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:10,880
They get their own land.

1582
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:12,320
You know, he's going forward.

1583
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:16,160
Well, they had the right idea then, and they've gotten off the trail.

1584
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:21,320
It's time. It's it's time to get back and it's time to build the dick boner.

1585
01:19:21,640 --> 01:19:22,920
Quite frankly.

1586
01:19:22,920 --> 01:19:26,240
Man, here's an early 2000s ass memory

1587
01:19:27,280 --> 01:19:30,920
buying Donnie Darko on DVD in high school.

1588
01:19:31,120 --> 01:19:34,320
Everyone's getting their mind blown watching it in someone's basement.

1589
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:35,160
Oh, yeah.

1590
01:19:35,160 --> 01:19:39,480
Taking it to college, realizing everyone else had the Donnie Darko DVD

1591
01:19:39,480 --> 01:19:42,400
because it was always on sale for five to ten dollars.

1592
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:46,600
Shortly, a year or two into college,

1593
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:50,760
going over to the Repertory Cinema to watch the Donnie Darko

1594
01:19:50,760 --> 01:19:56,680
Director's Cut release, despite all of us watching it so many times on DVD already.

1595
01:19:56,720 --> 01:19:58,480
You were that in the Darko. Whoa.

1596
01:19:58,480 --> 01:20:00,560
Everyone was excited for Darko, my man.

1597
01:20:01,240 --> 01:20:02,600
Everyone loved Darko.

1598
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:05,760
I saw once and I was it didn't I'm not trying to be cool or anything.

1599
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:07,640
I just was now I was like, oh, yeah, OK.

1600
01:20:07,640 --> 01:20:09,400
Mm hmm. I was not way into dark.

1601
01:20:09,400 --> 01:20:10,640
I was way in this Kevin Smith.

1602
01:20:10,640 --> 01:20:13,280
I'm not, you know, I'm just saying it's interesting.

1603
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:16,560
Yeah. Were you into Garden State?

1604
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:17,560
I like to garden state.

1605
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:19,680
Yeah, I thought Garden State was Braffport.

1606
01:20:19,680 --> 01:20:23,800
Braffport. Braffport for sure.

1607
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:27,640
It's the well, that's you're just you're you get in, you strap on,

1608
01:20:27,640 --> 01:20:30,840
and then you're given headphones and you send you're told that this is going

1609
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:32,840
to change your life, I swear.

1610
01:20:32,840 --> 01:20:36,640
And then you feel what it's like for your life to change forever.

1611
01:20:36,640 --> 01:20:38,120
Because you heard it. Yeah.

1612
01:20:38,120 --> 01:20:40,840
A sharing is creepy by the shins.

1613
01:20:41,160 --> 01:20:42,840
I mean, that's how you guys feel, right?

1614
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:46,160
Like your lives change forever as soon as you're it'll change your life.

1615
01:20:46,160 --> 01:20:48,400
I swear. As soon as I heard the song or saw the movie.

1616
01:20:48,520 --> 01:20:50,120
No, the mid the song song, the song.

1617
01:20:50,120 --> 01:20:52,920
Oh, yeah. That song I had been listening to the same.

1618
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:57,080
Oh, for that album, I had gotten three years before two or three years before.

1619
01:20:57,080 --> 01:20:58,040
Yeah, sure.

1620
01:20:58,480 --> 01:21:04,160
Well, look, Mike, maybe you could learn a lesson on the Scrubs ride

1621
01:21:04,840 --> 01:21:06,560
that you can't do this all on your own.

1622
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:08,440
You're Superman.

1623
01:21:08,440 --> 01:21:09,960
You want these personalized right?

1624
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:10,960
It's true.

1625
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:13,240
I would like to see.

1626
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:17,240
Yes, I would like to see that the Scrubs theme song,

1627
01:21:17,240 --> 01:21:20,160
I'm No Superman be visualized in a ride.

1628
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:22,840
That's what I actually Jason brings up a very good point

1629
01:21:23,240 --> 01:21:26,360
that if you could show me the lyrics with robots,

1630
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:28,160
that would be great.

1631
01:21:28,160 --> 01:21:31,480
There's we have fears that Lucasport would be dated, but Braffport

1632
01:21:31,960 --> 01:21:36,960
when installed in 2005, I think would be some things are timeless.

1633
01:21:37,160 --> 01:21:39,320
Braffport sounds real, actually.

1634
01:21:39,320 --> 01:21:43,040
Now the more we say it, the guy I'm going up to Braffport for the weekend.

1635
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:44,640
You're like, oh, yeah. Where is that again?

1636
01:21:44,640 --> 01:21:46,440
It's Northern California, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1637
01:21:46,440 --> 01:21:48,960
Northern sounds kind of Wisconsin to me a little bit.

1638
01:21:49,160 --> 01:21:50,160
Yeah, perhaps. Yeah.

1639
01:21:50,160 --> 01:21:52,120
My parents in Braffport.

1640
01:21:52,120 --> 01:21:54,040
Yeah, one of those little islands, South Dakota. Yeah.

1641
01:21:54,240 --> 01:21:55,680
Yeah. Braffport.

1642
01:21:55,680 --> 01:21:57,680
It's kind of it's good.

1643
01:21:57,680 --> 01:21:59,000
It's good. It's fine.

1644
01:21:59,000 --> 01:21:59,840
Braffport holds it.

1645
01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:01,080
Everything closes at nine.

1646
01:22:01,080 --> 01:22:04,360
Really early eight. Yeah.

1647
01:22:04,360 --> 01:22:06,520
Well, that I guess.

1648
01:22:07,080 --> 01:22:08,760
Happy May the fourth.

1649
01:22:08,760 --> 01:22:10,120
Happy May.

1650
01:22:10,120 --> 01:22:11,960
Well, that was all that was all over the map.

1651
01:22:11,960 --> 01:22:13,920
We chose a lot of different.

1652
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:16,360
We've fled and we and we fought.

1653
01:22:16,360 --> 01:22:17,280
We did it all.

1654
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:20,880
You survived podcast, the ride Lucasport edition.

1655
01:22:21,640 --> 01:22:25,160
And again, I know it's going to get rowdy this year for May the fourth.

1656
01:22:25,160 --> 01:22:25,840
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

1657
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:29,280
Just try to, you know, not

1658
01:22:30,520 --> 01:22:31,960
try to not lose your mind.

1659
01:22:31,960 --> 01:22:34,640
Yeah. Look, those these those helmets are constrictive.

1660
01:22:34,640 --> 01:22:36,680
And if you vomit inside them,

1661
01:22:36,680 --> 01:22:38,720
you get you get trapped with your own vomit.

1662
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:39,480
You passed out.

1663
01:22:39,480 --> 01:22:42,600
Is there any new Star Wars stuff right now?

1664
01:22:43,240 --> 01:22:44,320
There's no one coming.

1665
01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:45,880
Oh, we want coming out soon.

1666
01:22:45,880 --> 01:22:48,000
Star Wars celebration is happening soon.

1667
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:49,920
That's right. Is that the first one back?

1668
01:22:50,160 --> 01:22:51,280
I think it might be.

1669
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:52,480
Yeah, I would like to go to that.

1670
01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:54,920
Well, people people have been talking about.

1671
01:22:54,920 --> 01:22:58,520
And this was already a phenomenon before Covid Coachella cough.

1672
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:01,360
It's just that there is an art.

1673
01:23:01,360 --> 01:23:06,000
I read an article about this last night where it's like some people get

1674
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:10,480
they just spend so much time eating, you know, getting that desert dust in their lungs.

1675
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:12,360
They come back from Coachella with a cough.

1676
01:23:12,360 --> 01:23:15,200
And now this year, people came back from the return to Coachella

1677
01:23:15,200 --> 01:23:17,440
with either that or Covid-19.

1678
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:20,680
Will there be a Star Wars celebration cough?

1679
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:22,560
Yes. The answer is yes.

1680
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:25,240
Oh, OK. The answer is yes.

1681
01:23:25,240 --> 01:23:26,720
And it's concrete.

1682
01:23:26,720 --> 01:23:28,800
We people always thought San Diego Comic Con.

1683
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:31,800
People always talk about coming back from that a little fluid.

1684
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:33,280
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

1685
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:35,080
Oh, yeah. Force flu.

1686
01:23:35,080 --> 01:23:36,760
I got the it's not Covid.

1687
01:23:36,760 --> 01:23:38,120
It's just a little bit of force flu.

1688
01:23:38,120 --> 01:23:40,440
Yeah. Yeah. No, that'll that'll happen anyway.

1689
01:23:40,440 --> 01:23:41,800
I would like to go to it.

1690
01:23:41,800 --> 01:23:44,920
I did recently ask about press passes.

1691
01:23:44,920 --> 01:23:45,760
It was too late.

1692
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:46,760
I was told no.

1693
01:23:47,960 --> 01:23:48,760
So we tried.

1694
01:23:48,760 --> 01:23:49,960
That's not an episode coming.

1695
01:23:49,960 --> 01:23:52,000
That is not an episode of Star Wars celebration.

1696
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,560
So, yeah, anyway, sorry, we fucked up.

1697
01:23:55,560 --> 01:23:57,800
But other episodes coming soon.

1698
01:23:57,800 --> 01:23:59,160
Coming soon. Yes, for sure.

1699
01:23:59,160 --> 01:24:00,720
Keep it tuned here. Thanks, everybody.

1700
01:24:00,720 --> 01:24:01,720
Goodbye. Bye.
