1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:10,880
Step right up, step right up for a podcast episode like no other, full of Mark's looky

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:16,680
loos and talk of the Chicago World's Fair that for once does not lead to H.H. Holmes'

5
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:17,880
murder castle.

6
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:23,560
Leanne Bowen joins us to discuss carnivals on today's thrilling podcast, The Ride.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:49,280
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, the show hosted by three cake-eating Marks.

8
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,840
I'm Jason Sheridan, joined as always by Mike Carlson.

9
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:57,960
Yes, I am here, my name is Mike Carlson and I am a cake-eating Mark.

10
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:02,280
Figurative, I am both figurative and literal cake-eating Mark.

11
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,760
Scott Gerrarder here, of course, as well.

12
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:13,560
Yeah, am I correct, Jason, that you did you also visit a website devoted to carny lingo?

13
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:21,800
Scott, I visited any number of websites about carny lingo and reached the point where I'm like,

14
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:26,680
I have to set up to record, I have to tap out at the letter K.

15
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,160
I had to tap out because so much of the lingo was making me uncomfortable.

16
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,360
A lot of it was very upsetting to me.

17
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:42,200
I don't know if you were looking at the same one as me, but even more upsetting than the lingo itself

18
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:48,200
was the graphic design of the white comic sans over just bright blue.

19
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:54,120
It was upsetting to look at, not a visual carnival in the least.

20
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,160
That is exactly where I ended up.

21
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:02,200
I started on a website with like 12 terms and I was like, this isn't enough, there has to be more.

22
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:08,040
Be careful what you wish for because you're really getting to the weeds there.

23
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:14,760
I'm excited about that carny language because it has so much crossover with pro wrestling slang.

24
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,120
Yes, I encounter a lot of that too.

25
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,960
So I am a mark for cake.

26
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:27,160
I ate a cake last week and when I say I ate a cake, I ate the whole cake.

27
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,080
I did the whole thing myself.

28
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:29,800
Solo?

29
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,640
Yes, solo.

30
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,400
Why'd that come about?

31
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,320
It was a smaller cake.

32
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,000
Yeah, Lindsay was gone for a couple days.

33
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:47,240
So when no one's around, you're going to have to eat that whole cake.

34
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,440
Jason, you know what I'm saying.

35
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:54,520
Hey, brother, I know what you're talking about, especially when no one's around

36
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,520
or if people are around, you know.

37
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:04,040
Let's bring our guest in to see what she thinks about eating a cake alone.

38
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,680
She is not a mark.

39
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:12,680
In carnival parlance, actually once was an agent, a worker of the carnival.

40
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:21,160
She is a writer and producer, I believe, on the Apple TV show, Ted Lasso.

41
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,400
Right. Yes, she's not.

42
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,520
Yes, that's correct.

43
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,440
It's Leanne Bowen.

44
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,000
Thank you.

45
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:33,320
I'm trying to learn podcast etiquette and something in my brain is like,

46
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,480
you can't talk until your name is said.

47
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:39,980
Hey.

48
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:45,100
Yeah, I want to say for future, any other future appearances here,

49
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:49,100
otherwise, and any guests on our show, feel free to interrupt us anytime.

50
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,060
It doesn't matter.

51
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:51,580
Nothing we're saying is important.

52
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:52,620
So, yeah, no, no.

53
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:53,340
No, okay.

54
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:55,260
Yes, it's true.

55
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,220
I was an agent.

56
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:59,580
Yes, I am a writer on Ted Lasso.

57
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:02,620
What is a mark?

58
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:03,740
I don't know what a mark is.

59
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:07,020
Oh, it's like a rub.

60
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:07,660
It's a sucker.

61
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:08,540
A rub.

62
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,500
A sucker.

63
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,380
It's somebody that can be taken advantage of, essentially.

64
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:14,460
So like if it's a crooked carnival game.

65
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:17,020
I get it.

66
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:23,340
Yes, that guy with the short arms, he's the mark for a baseball tossing.

67
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,580
Like, because you can't throw it.

68
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:26,060
I get it.

69
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:27,340
With short arms, yes.

70
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:28,620
So yeah, you're limited.

71
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,780
You're not going to smash those bottles down.

72
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:35,020
Oh, I hope and I don't mean to be ableist.

73
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:36,620
I don't know.

74
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,460
I guess short arms could also throw very far.

75
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:39,420
I apologize.

76
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:43,660
You're just saying, oh, you're just saying it's the descriptor to point out somebody.

77
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,100
It's like a red hat.

78
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,940
Yeah, that guy can sing and play the piano.

79
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:47,980
He can't throw a baseball.

80
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:49,100
That's exactly.

81
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:55,180
Yeah, a Jason Sheridan type, you know, where it's like that doesn't make any sense.

82
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:56,780
What is he?

83
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:06,540
Yes, mark comes from the carnies when they would, you know, after someone lost a game,

84
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:09,660
they would pat them on the back with chalk on their hands.

85
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:15,740
So you would literally look like other workers would look for the marks in the crowd and

86
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:19,180
start and try to lure them over like, come here, come here, try this game now.

87
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,620
You know, that's amazing.

88
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:21,660
That's amazing.

89
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,340
That sounds it seems really smart.

90
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:26,620
I will say that's kind of the energy that I could see happening.

91
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:30,540
I didn't see that happening on the carnival, but like they seem like a very tight knit

92
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:35,980
community and I could see them having little secret things going on like that.

93
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:38,140
It was it was it was really interesting.

94
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:39,420
Yeah.

95
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:43,900
So so yeah, just to officially say we're talking carnivals today.

96
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:44,300
Yes.

97
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:47,660
We haven't done a lot of carnival talk on podcast the ride.

98
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:52,380
So yeah, we're going to finally address some of these topics.

99
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,900
I know everybody wants to know about.

100
00:05:55,340 --> 00:06:01,260
And with the broader umbrella of carnivals, you know, it seems like Leanne, like you're

101
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:06,860
in was a carnival that you that you worked at in the recent past, but the broader umbrella

102
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:18,140
also seems to include circa 1890s, you know, like weird train side hobo era that, you know,

103
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:24,220
you did not work at a carnival in the 1890s just to get that out of the way.

104
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:26,540
It was I think 2015.

105
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:29,180
Oh, fairly recently then.

106
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,060
Fairly recent.

107
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:36,300
I don't know if there's been a lot of like advances in carny like culture.

108
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:41,020
So there might be some like, like hanging out some hanging honors of the 1800s.

109
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:42,540
But yeah, it's interesting.

110
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:47,180
I didn't I wasn't seeking I guess I wasn't looking to work at a carnival.

111
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:52,060
Actually, it was interesting because I ran a red light and I had like a $400 ticket and

112
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:53,900
I usually would pay it.

113
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:57,420
But for some reason, I decided to go down to the courtroom and I didn't know that you

114
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:00,300
can do community service instead of paying tickets.

115
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,820
I was like, oh, I'm never paying a ticket again.

116
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:02,860
I'll just do community service.

117
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:06,860
I thought it was something like cleaning up the side of the road or, you know, I don't

118
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:11,020
know, doing something I saw down the street from my house.

119
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:13,020
There's like like work or carnival.

120
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:14,540
And I was like, are you serious?

121
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:15,900
I get to work a carnival.

122
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:21,500
Like I would have done that on a Saturday just to like hang out and see what it was like.

123
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,420
So it was cool.

124
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:24,460
It was really I.

125
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:28,940
Yeah, I went down there and I was maybe the oldest person that was working.

126
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:32,940
It was it must have been city run or something because it was a city of Los Angeles.

127
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:36,140
And there was this older lady sitting in it.

128
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:41,500
It was at a high school and this older lady sitting in the physical education office.

129
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:47,420
And then literally it was me and like six teenagers that were that were the like

130
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,340
authority on this carnival.

131
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:54,540
And they gave us she just gave us walkie talkies and keys to the go-karts.

132
00:07:54,540 --> 00:08:00,060
And she's like, yeah, just make sure like all the trash is taken out and like make sure

133
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,060
all the trash bins are taken over here.

134
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:08,380
Make sure all they have all what they need, because basically they would hire this company.

135
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:17,020
And I'm using finger quotes because they seem more like a roving community of of drifters.

136
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:24,860
That was that and they basically ran each stand.

137
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:25,740
They set it up.

138
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:28,140
They planned it all out like it was their deal.

139
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,380
And we just were sort of I guess.

140
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:32,380
And I don't remember seeing security there.

141
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:35,820
And then so, yes, that's all I did all day.

142
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,820
And at the end of the day, I was like, OK, guys, pick up your.

143
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:40,700
And then when I was done, she was like, here, pick up your envelope of tickets.

144
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,500
Go have fun.

145
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,460
I was like, oh, shit, I get to go like go on rides and stuff.

146
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:47,660
But I oh, I can go on.

147
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:48,700
It's crazy.

148
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:53,500
I carnival rides after seeing them set it up, it terrifies me.

149
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,300
Like I had to sit.

150
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,620
I'll stop talking a little while you guys can go.

151
00:08:58,620 --> 00:08:59,260
No, please.

152
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:02,140
But I think I got there at like 6 a.m.

153
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:05,500
and I got the run of the land and then they showed up at like 8 a.m.

154
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:09,580
And as they were coming in, I was directing them.

155
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:11,820
And then one guy like rolled down his window.

156
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,580
He's like, hey, where's the nearest liquor store?

157
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:14,940
And I was like, cool.

158
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,980
OK, you're going to set up a ride and then go get liquor.

159
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:25,260
So yeah, I carnival rides, if you have a feeling like they're scary

160
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:30,380
or you shouldn't go on it, your feeling is probably right because it is it's crazy.

161
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:38,700
I relatively unvetted community of folks, at least in the one that you experienced setting it out.

162
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:43,180
Did you feel just like random people who are strong or not strong?

163
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:45,180
I think not strong.

164
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:48,700
I think they they're just regular people.

165
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:54,940
They they feel like like if I feel I don't want to be like mean,

166
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:58,620
but I've been like, I don't know, like, has anyone been to Fresno?

167
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:09,820
They all were like, I feel like, oh, this is a family from Bakersfield.

168
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:12,300
They're like, we can get into the carney business.

169
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:18,060
And they they would they have these huge like wrenches that were like the size of my body

170
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:24,300
and they would set up these big rides and then they would just sit at them all day

171
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,460
and take tickets and nothing broke.

172
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,020
Thank God.

173
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:33,180
When you were illustrating that, you had kind of a miserable pose as if

174
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:38,940
the people who set these things up with the giant wrenches then just stare bitterly at their

175
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,060
creation all day.

176
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,020
Absolutely.

177
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:41,900
There was no joy.

178
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,340
There was no joy.

179
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:49,820
I think the people that had more like pizzazz were the people running the games because,

180
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,100
you know, you have to engage people.

181
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:56,780
But even then it was just like, like I've been to like a county fair and it feels a little more fun,

182
00:10:56,780 --> 00:11:00,220
but this was just a little sadder because it was at a high school in the valley.

183
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:06,700
And yeah, it just wasn't it didn't have what like the Orange County for the county fair,

184
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,980
the LA County Fair had.

185
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:14,380
But the craziest thing that happened was there was a little girl who I swear to God had to be 14.

186
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,100
It was a family fair too.

187
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:21,580
So, you know, clearly his family fair and she looked like she had giant angel wings

188
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,020
tattooed on her back.

189
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:26,700
And I was like, first of all, she's a baby.

190
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:32,700
Why is she working at this carnival and why does she have giant angel wings tattooed on her back?

191
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,220
It was it was such an experience.

192
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:37,260
I wish I had talked to Pete, talked to them more, but I think I was just,

193
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:40,540
I yeah, I just keep in your head down to some extent.

194
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,740
Yeah, I keep my head down.

195
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,860
Try not to let stuff follow me.

196
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:48,780
Yeah, it's interesting because I mean, we would have there would be a yearly carnival that would

197
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:51,580
be at the church by our house and we would always go.

198
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:55,580
I think I've told the story before I got thrown up on on the Tilt-A-Whirl.

199
00:11:56,460 --> 00:12:01,100
There were five there were, yeah, five of us in a Tilt-A-Whirl car.

200
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:04,860
My friend next to me, me, it might be six, it was six.

201
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,540
And then my sister.

202
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:06,860
That's too many.

203
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,380
Yeah, that's far too many.

204
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:09,580
Far too many.

205
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:13,340
I could see the car and just be like, get in, that's fine, get in, everyone get in.

206
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:17,100
Well, yeah, when my when my friend turned to me and said, I'm going to be sick.

207
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:21,020
And I was trying to yell at the operator, my friend is going to be sick.

208
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:22,700
Didn't matter.

209
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:23,420
It didn't.

210
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:24,780
That isn't a concern.

211
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,100
And then I was the buffer.

212
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:33,180
I got all the throw up and my sister and other two friends did not get any throw up on them.

213
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:33,740
Oh, my God.

214
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:38,860
But there was you definitely like kind of felt like, oh, everybody that works here,

215
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,860
like is a fan, like they all know each other.

216
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:44,300
Like it's they've been obviously on the road forever because this is sort of just

217
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:49,340
they're like traveling musicians or something like they've just been the road warriors.

218
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,180
Absolutely.

219
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,700
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

220
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:56,700
She's got a roadie stuff, too, where it's this like just massive.

221
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:01,900
You sort of don't think about the scale of this stuff and the setup and tear down and how briefly

222
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,660
some of it can be up.

223
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:11,820
And in just my my vague research, hearing about shifts that are 24 hours long of setting up a

224
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:16,620
Ferris wheel and then having to drive it all night and all day to the next place,

225
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:22,540
that sounds like incredibly tiring, which might be where that might be where I ran into

226
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:26,220
the carny term beanies.

227
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:29,420
Jason, did you read about beanies?

228
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:34,060
I think I read about beanies, but I think I've forgotten more than I've ever known about

229
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:36,060
carny Lego at this point.

230
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:42,540
This one jumped out because beanies are amphetamines because if you have to do stuff,

231
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:47,900
if you have to do that level of stuff for 24 hours, like to set up a tear down an entire

232
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:52,300
Ferris wheel and then drive for the entire rest of the day, you might need a little help.

233
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,220
You might need a little bit of beanies.

234
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:57,740
But again, is this what I'm describing from the 1910s?

235
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:02,380
I don't want to go saying that the people that you worked for, Leanne, are cranked up on beanies.

236
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:07,180
I really hate to stereotype and like, but it was that.

237
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,220
Like it was exactly that.

238
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:09,100
And that's it.

239
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:12,060
These are things that happen.

240
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,580
You don't blame them.

241
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:14,300
I guess I would also.

242
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,180
I don't blame them.

243
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:16,700
Absolutely.

244
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:20,380
I'm sure the profit turnover isn't very good and they're just trying their best.

245
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:25,020
But yeah, half of them were I know for sure one guy went to get alcohol

246
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,340
before the day started.

247
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:28,060
So there's that.

248
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,980
And who knows what else is going on?

249
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:35,740
There would be certain rides, like for whatever reason, I think like setting up a Tilt-A-Whirl.

250
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:39,260
And Tilt-A-Whirl was my favorite carnival ride as a kid.

251
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:41,020
I just I like that the best.

252
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:45,020
That one, for whatever reason, seems to like I'm not as scared by that.

253
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:50,060
But there would also be a ride where they were just hanging swings and you would swing around.

254
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:56,140
And more that I think about going on that now as an adult, where it's like really just a chain,

255
00:14:56,140 --> 00:15:01,900
they just hook a chain to something like that to me seems like that's that can just fly out.

256
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:05,340
How does that not happen more where there's like crazy stuff?

257
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:07,580
Because yeah, they're just transporting the stuff.

258
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,940
It's like Disneyland stuff.

259
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,700
There's always, you know, there's been accidents or whatever,

260
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:13,100
but those sit in the same spot forever.

261
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:14,220
Yes.

262
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:19,420
And they're not constantly taken apart and put back together like every few days.

263
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:23,340
I have like pieces of furniture that I've taken apart during like three moves,

264
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,460
and they're never the same.

265
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:30,060
The entertainment center is not the same as it was when I first put it together.

266
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,700
It's just like that's physics, I think.

267
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:34,860
Yeah, I don't know.

268
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:37,580
Go ahead.

269
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,860
Oh, yeah, I've never nothing broke.

270
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:44,700
I've loved I've always loved the carnival rides that would pop up in parking lots.

271
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:47,740
Like I grew up in the valley and there was like, yes, here comes one.

272
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:51,020
And I would ride the rides, but nothing is ever broken.

273
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:55,180
But yeah, I've seen I don't know if you guys have ever gone through like videos

274
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:59,020
and seen videos of like rides that I'm sure you guys have.

275
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:03,660
Like this podcast is probably you guys have dug deep into broken ride.

276
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:05,500
I saw it.

277
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:11,020
Well, you know what you end up with a lot of on YouTube is like sensationalist thumbnails

278
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:14,700
that portray some like impossible breakage.

279
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:17,260
Like a kid starting to fly towards the sun.

280
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,940
That's how high he's going.

281
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,300
And the click on it.

282
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:23,180
The sun has a mouth that's about to eat him as well.

283
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:25,820
And you're like, I don't think you click on it because you're like,

284
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,500
I just want to make sure this didn't happen.

285
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:32,140
I think I would have read about this in every newspaper.

286
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:37,580
But yeah, then you click on things and they're a little more mild and like, wait, how?

287
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,020
What's the accident?

288
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:41,180
Like it's too blurry to even tell.

289
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:43,740
I guess with this on the way to talk about carnivals,

290
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:48,220
I did see a pretty horrible one where some big things swung up and then just like

291
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:50,140
slammed back to the ground.

292
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:53,660
But I think there, here's where I have some hope is that,

293
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:56,860
you know, all right, we're talking about carnivals.

294
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:59,820
Let me find out about some grisly carnival accidents.

295
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,740
And they weren't that easy to find.

296
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:05,340
I don't think it's not as if there are hundreds every year.

297
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:06,940
I don't think that's the case at all.

298
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:07,660
Yeah.

299
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,020
It's very promising.

300
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:09,820
It's promising.

301
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,340
Yeah, it's promising.

302
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:11,980
It's great.

303
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:18,780
And it seems like most websites about carnival and stuff are like, well, in the modern day,

304
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:22,460
most are run pretty honestly.

305
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:27,820
Like they figured out like, well, there's ways to run these games where it's like,

306
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:32,220
oh, it's not crooked, but it's still a pain in the ass for people where they just end

307
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:35,820
up dishing out money because kids want a good prize.

308
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,900
They don't want a tiny comb.

309
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:41,580
I just remember like any Chuck E. Cheese or like carnival games.

310
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:45,340
The entry level prize is just like, would you like a tiny comb?

311
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:46,460
What about a kazoo?

312
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:52,140
It's like you see all those big prizes and then like you won and then they pull out something

313
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:55,820
underneath and it's just like a pencil sharpener or something.

314
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:56,300
Yes.

315
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,900
A non-display prize.

316
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:58,620
Sure.

317
00:17:58,620 --> 00:17:59,580
That would always get me.

318
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:05,580
It's funny because the history like of American popular culture all goes back to

319
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:07,660
like the same wells.

320
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:15,100
It all goes back to like carnivals and then vaudeville and then the funny pages

321
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,220
and all of this stuff.

322
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:23,660
But what the modern like version of a carnival comes for, it seemed like everyone kind of agreed

323
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:31,420
on like pointing at like, well, the 1893 Chicago World's Fair is like the origin of like the

324
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:38,940
modern carnival because like that introduced the concept of the midway and like every carnival

325
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:39,660
is a midway.

326
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:47,100
The World's Fair had a lot of exhibits, had a lot of modern technology, but the thing that

327
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:52,860
people gravitated towards of course was the Ferris wheel and the games and the prizes and

328
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:57,180
in a less enlightened time, the freak shows, you know?

329
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:57,680
Yeah.

330
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:58,420
Yeah.

331
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,100
Yeah.

332
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,800
The exhibits always, they're still weird.

333
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:11,120
Like they have them at the Orange County Fair and the LA County Fair in Pomona where like

334
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:17,360
tables set it like you can like set a table and then that you compete for ribbons for like

335
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,560
how you set a table.

336
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,920
For setting a table?

337
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:20,420
Really?

338
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,300
Yeah.

339
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,800
It's a huge thing.

340
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,300
Yeah.

341
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,960
It's like my theme is apples.

342
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,720
So you have a little plate in the shape of an apple and the placemats and apple and then

343
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,880
you have glasses and apple juice.

344
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,380
I don't know.

345
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:35,680
And there's wild, it's like decorating a cake except it's table setting.

346
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,680
I do not get it.

347
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,680
It's fascinating.

348
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,680
Also kind of like not great.

349
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,320
Some I'm like, okay, this is really shitty.

350
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,280
I was like, this is the Orange County Fair.

351
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,080
You better bring it.

352
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,720
Yeah, that feels a high profile.

353
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,840
Like you have to bring an A game to the Orange County Fair, which is the thing I feel like I

354
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,280
heard even living in Illinois.

355
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,400
I heard that phrase.

356
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,400
I know what it was necessarily, but the Orange County Fair.

357
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:01,920
The Orange County Fair.

358
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,960
I think I knew it before I knew like I lived here is what I'm saying.

359
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,400
Have you been now?

360
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,440
I have never been.

361
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:10,740
Yeah.

362
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:16,320
Fairs are like state fairs, county fairs are such they're weird own beasts because they like

363
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:21,520
share a lot of very similar things to carnivals, but then they'll set up for like a month or

364
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,320
a few months.

365
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,800
And like carnivals are usually in and out in like a week or less.

366
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:28,720
It's a quicker thing.

367
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:33,360
Probably because in the past they had to get the hell out of Dodge.

368
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,560
Who knows what inspired.

369
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,960
Before all the people in the town talked to each other and realized they had been swindled.

370
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,920
And then they ran them out like ran them out of town.

371
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:46,420
Yes.

372
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,560
Thousands of us with the shock marks on our back.

373
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:51,700
Right.

374
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,120
Wait a minute.

375
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,800
Did you see you have it too.

376
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,240
My son and my daughter and my priest all of us.

377
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,400
We talked about games.

378
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:11,600
Games loomed so large in my child brain because like I don't know we knew I think those were like

379
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:17,200
crappy like full of like cheap styrofoam plush oftentimes.

380
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,040
It was not your high quality plush that we might have had at home.

381
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:26,000
But the idea of winning, which I think is also why I like casinos.

382
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,920
There was something about like winning like your good how good you were could win something

383
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,800
that would like just make me gravitate toward the games.

384
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:41,600
And my strongest game memory is at this carnival that we had by the church.

385
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:47,120
There was a man who was operating it and it was as close I think as I would have ever gotten to like

386
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,800
old timey carnival barker.

387
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:54,400
But he had his own style and I will never ever forget the way what he was saying because we

388
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:59,920
would repeat it for years and he would be like we're playing for another big and we're playing

389
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:06,080
for a big and we're two big and for a jumbo to like over like playing.

390
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,280
Hey, step right up there.

391
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:12,320
You sir you are playing for a big and and he would talk about the different sizes depending

392
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,000
on how many people I think were playing this game.

393
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,680
I don't remember what game it was, but for years we would say we're playing for another big and

394
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:27,040
we're playing for a big and and we got so excited to play for a big and with this gentleman.

395
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,560
What a big and end up being.

396
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,080
I think it was just like I did not.

397
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,600
I never won a big.

398
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:37,440
I don't even think I won anything at that game, but we would play that game because we also were

399
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,400
entertained by this man and his sales pitch.

400
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:46,000
But a big you know you've seen they always have those giant things and I think a jumbo was the

401
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,200
biggest one you could get a big and was the next size down and then there was probably as Leanne

402
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:57,920
was talking about the under the counter you know decoder ring that you probably got if you didn't

403
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,800
actually do anything.

404
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:04,480
So I will that's I can I can like see this man's face in my mind.

405
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,400
I know this was over 20 years ago.

406
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:13,920
That one website that Scott and I were talking about with the comic sans like glossaries made

407
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:22,000
a very I it was like finding a diamond in a rough diamond in the rough where it was like oh

408
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:28,320
Barker is not a term carnies use that came along in the 20th century.

409
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:35,440
It came from someone else and it quoted like a couple of like a lifer carnival

410
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:46,080
professionals and they claim to be showmen that the term they used was showmen and I found an

411
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:51,440
institution in Florida called the International Independent Showman's Museum.

412
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,600
So I think there may be some truth in there.

413
00:23:54,240 --> 00:24:01,360
Also it is hard to tell where there is any truth just in the nature of this carnival business.

414
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:12,240
Right I saw some of this too the stuff I said is that what they call Barkers don't like the term

415
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,440
and they prefer to be referred to as talkers.

416
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:21,760
They're carnival talkers and I'm like who cares get out of here.

417
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:28,480
You guys get to choose a term for this specific like I don't like people have to fight to get the

418
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:34,800
pronouns they want used and then there's other people who are like um talkers please this is not

419
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,160
a plight that I care about.

420
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:36,960
That's so boring too.

421
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:37,600
Yeah really.

422
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:44,000
Well we talk so I mean you can get a little more creative with it and Barker is fun it reminds you

423
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,320
of dogs and dogs are like oh.

424
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:51,360
Yeah what's wrong with with barking I guess does that imply that there's they seem to think that

425
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:58,160
that implies no skill that we are just barking but barks are cool and they make you happy like dogs

426
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,680
right there's no problem with barking.

427
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:06,960
Well Scott the outside talker lures you into the tent and then the inside talker takes over

428
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:08,720
obviously.

429
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:15,200
Oh they just I guess they feel like they have a little more finesse than barking.

430
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:15,920
Yeah.

431
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,840
Talking requires a little more finesse I guess.

432
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:26,880
They didn't want to be they don't want to be too like hoity-toity about it they just want to be

433
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,560
like they're it's approachable talking is approachable.

434
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:34,640
I think they're just trying to be difficult they're just like oh so you're a bunch so you're

435
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:41,120
a barker huh I don't like the sound of that I want to wriggle out of this label I don't know why

436
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:49,040
though um the other the other thing I noticed about just in googling carnival barker is that like

437
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:54,480
eight of the top 10 results are people calling Donald Trump a carnival barker

438
00:25:55,280 --> 00:26:01,680
he is all he is less politician and more carnival barker or even uh

439
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:09,280
Michael Bloomberg tweeted that Donald Trump we know many of the same people in New York behind

440
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:16,880
your back they laugh at you and call you a carnival barking clown that's not the clown isn't the barker

441
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:24,000
no the clowns are silent typically or often at least and they would not be the

442
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:30,240
they're the person on the inside talking probably not that uh I you know it's this kind of

443
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:37,200
sloppiness in metaphors that I think caused Bloomberg the presidency and only that New York

444
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:43,520
elite the New York elite they're just not in touch with what the real people know well yeah

445
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:50,240
he immediately insulted the uh uh clowns he lost those votes and then he insulted carnival

446
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:56,800
professionals so you know everyone he said this he said this at the debate too I think and then

447
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:03,200
all the all the clowns in the audience all hushed you know like just cut to a section of them

448
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,520
they went back to their jobs at congress they went back to their jobs at congress

449
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:14,240
got it stick it to them Jason boy hell yeah we all enjoyed that

450
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:23,040
that yeah uh Leanne let's like just uh when you were a kid were you like way into rides and

451
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:26,960
this type of stuff in general or was it sort of just like a once you know once a year twice a

452
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:32,640
year thing like did you go to not spare where did you grow up oh yeah I grew up in the valley so

453
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:38,560
we would do um six flags a lot our school would do six flags I loved six flags when I was a little

454
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:43,520
like magic mountain we did disney I did to disneyland maybe like two or three times but

455
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:48,480
it was so expensive and then not spare from I did not scary farm for the first time when I was

456
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:54,560
like in my 20s and was like how come I didn't never gotten to this but yeah I loved rides I loved um

457
00:27:54,560 --> 00:28:02,160
I was terrified but loved the like freefall rides and for some reason I can't do them anymore I

458
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:09,680
don't know what it was I don't know where in my 20s or early 30s I just I like I think I went to

459
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:17,760
disneyland and I went on the the haunted um the one at California adventure and I went on it and

460
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:24,000
I was like and it scared the shit out of me I was just like my head was like curled down into my

461
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,880
body and I was like I'm never doing this again and I don't know why I don't know how that happened

462
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:35,440
but yeah when I was little I loved magic mountain I loved rides I would drag my dad to take me to

463
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:40,560
magic mountain he would literally sit at the bottom of each ride when me and my my brother

464
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:48,560
and sister would go on um I do I remember the point I think it was like I was in my mid-20s um

465
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:56,080
Goliath at Six Flags I don't know if you guys know the big orange one um I we it was when it first

466
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:05,040
opened up and um I waited the line was so long and we got to the top and uh finally got to the front

467
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:11,440
of the line and I remember I stepped into the car and I was like I can't I stepped right out and all

468
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:16,480
my friends were like what are you doing I was like I can't do this and they went on the ride

469
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:21,840
and then I went on an hour later because I was like no I'm gonna do it I got on and I regretted

470
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:27,520
it I was like I was right I shouldn't have got on this ride I I something about and I also I

471
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:34,640
I hate flying now like I used to love I I've been to different countries I never second thought

472
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,600
I never gave a second thought to getting on a plane but now I'm like I have to take I have to

473
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:45,520

474
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:52,480
the like loss of control like I something about that I just I can't and I will know I probably

475
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:57,680
won't get on another um roller coaster for the rest of my life I can really say yeah I can say

476
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:02,800
that with a lot of confidence not even with just take a sleeping pill just that'll help you get

477
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:14,320
through it six flags don't forget your sleeping pills they should sell them at the just like the

478
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:21,040
funnel cake stand at six flags or just make it in the batter just put it in the batter for god's

479
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:25,120

486
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:12,560
I'll be like forcing him onto stuff that I'll create him being a wimp by wanting it to go the

487
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:18,800
other way this were you always like that when you were a kid too yeah yeah big time no no like

488
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:26,080
super avoided thrill rides and built them up into like bigger monsters than they were they're

489
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:31,520
terrifying your body is not supposed to be doing those things yeah it's true brain is not wrong

490
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:38,240
about the no yeah it knows it knows what's going on you just have to override it and it depends

491
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:43,040
we've gotten I think probably not Jason but Scott and I have both gotten braver about what we're

492
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:49,600
willing to do since going on this or sorry sorry since doing this podcast it's forced us right to

493
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:55,920
be uh braver I will say with the with the flying though I was bad about flying a couple years where

494
00:31:55,920 --> 00:32:01,120
I was really good about it and now I am back to bad I am back to bad I don't know what happened

495
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:08,880
someone um recommended to me there's a training school where you can um you go through it you take

496
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:14,880
a class and then you and the whole class go on a practice flight with these teachers and you they

497
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:21,520
train you to not be afraid of flying it whoa that's yeah it's really interesting yeah so you take a

498
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:26,080
real commercial flight you take a real commercial flight and it's just you it's like a smaller plane

499
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:30,480
like you go from like southern California to northern California and you you fly there and

500
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:34,960
you fly back it's like an hour and an hour um and you pay for it you pay for the plane ticket

501
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:41,600
but um yeah they teach you the different things about a plane statistics turbulence like never

502
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:48,800
ever results in a crash so and there's just all these little things to sort of coping skills I

503
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:53,680
guess um I always wanted to do that I just never got around to doing it it sounds like an it sounds

504
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:58,400
like a future podcast the right episode quite honestly I was wondering do you guys have you

505
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:05,360
guys gone together to a park or oh yeah yeah set up a little mic and just like narrate a ride or

506
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:11,040
anything like that I think that would be fun that no well well I guess a tiny bit but a little bit

507
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:15,840
we've done some recording in the park I think there was a controversy early on we we threw out

508
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:19,520
the idea of recording at city walk and I think Jason thought we were going to get arrested if

509
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:26,080
we did that yes well so Jason is scared of the city walk police more than and Scott and I are

510
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:33,360
afraid of the ride bigger rides yeah no I mean I've always liked flying and roller coasters and

511
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:40,720
all of that sort of thing I'm just more scared of like errands and sending an email and laundry

512
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:46,960
laundry laundry uh emotional vulnerability asking for what I want and asking for help

513
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:53,520
so that's my that I think everyone has it about some stuff I just have it about these stupidest

514
00:33:53,520 --> 00:34:01,280
things imaginable so uh yeah these are your mental goliaths these are my mental goliaths

515
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:06,320
yeah emotional roller coasters yeah emotional rollercoaster yeah so if you just combine um

516
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:13,680
uh in if you just combine anxiety depression uh and happy go lucky it just comes out as flippant

517
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:20,960
and everyone loves it and you become a comedian I get that because like I you know I have low grade

518
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:25,600
anxiety and depression and it was worse when I was 20s and I've always loved horror movies like

519
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:30,320
I've loved just something terrifying me or scaring the show I mean I think it's because it's like

520
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:37,200
gets me out of my head so maybe that's what roller coasters are I'm trying to do horror movies now

521
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:41,200
because I was always scared of that we've talked about this on the show before you know I would go

522
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:45,760
in blockbuster and I would see you know Chucky or Hellraiser and I would think oh these are like

523
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:51,600
literal snuff films where I will watch humans being murdered over and over for 90 minutes or

524
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:57,680
two hours I will never I'll never do it and I've literally only in my 30s started getting through

525
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:05,920
some of these classics so I'm trying I'm trying I like look for new movies like I've searched for

526
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:13,440
movies that I haven't I feel like I've seen every um paranormal type of horror movie ever made and

527
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:21,600
I'm constantly searching Netflix or looking up lists and I it's like an addiction sure but

528
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:28,400
you said you had done not scary farm in general do you now like haunted houses and stuff more

529
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:32,880
and or like horror nights that type of thing I do I like horror nights I like when it's a really

530
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:40,640
scary one like um yeah I like when it's like I remember them saying like I mean the universal

531
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:46,240
studio one they will they might touch you and I was like oh my god I have to go I have to do it

532
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:51,280
like I have to do it and I remember doing one and it was like it was pretty scary but no one like

533
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:58,000
touched me so I was like oh shit but yeah yeah so yeah that's stuff I do think there's a lot to

534
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:08,000
that and uh as far as like that's such a comfort it's like a safe place to like excise your fear

535
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:15,600
excise that anxiety that we all feel just living yes I think that's what it is but I feel like

536
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:23,680
roller coasters you can still die it's like you can yeah sure sure sure yeah uh that's true I mean

537
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:31,520
I think so much of uh liking theme parks as much as we do there's such it's it's still pretty

538
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:36,640
controlled everything is about you know control and we're not like mission impossible two tom

539
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:42,720
we're not rock climbing none of us do that we don't do like real things we like a simulated

540
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:48,480
experience of like really dangerous things I don't want to really go in a haunted house

541
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:52,480
I don't really even believe in ghosts that much but I don't really want to do that but I will go

542
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:58,240
in a house where ghosts are having a party that's what I'd like fake ghosts are having a party I've

543
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:05,760
been on that a hundred plus times no that's true yeah I I I'm I do believe in ghosts is that fair

544
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:10,800
and I am terrified of them and I would never want to be in a haunted house a real haunted house

545
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:17,920
yeah do you have a ghost story do you have an interaction um I have a spiritual story

546
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:25,920
that is like it's not scary like my dad died and I was uh there for him in hospice and I took care

547
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:33,600
of him and then he asked me and it's been some time I'm not this is not heavy for me um but um

548
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:38,640
like two years later he wanted his ashes spread in Mexico so I went down to Mexico with my brother

549
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:44,720
my sister and we spread his ashes and I swear to god as if he was standing behind me I heard his

550
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:53,600
voice say thank you and like I'm a very like I it was crazy I can't explain it it's it it sounded

551
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:59,600
like his his voice existed in the physical world I don't know I don't I can't explain it I don't

552
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:08,080
know so that kind of just like reaffirmed my sort of like thought that there's we exist beyond our

553
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:14,640
physical selves um and it was really cool it was it was a really cool experience it didn't

554
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:19,920
terrify me it was like oh shit and it was like I'm kind of like oh cool so when I die something cool

555
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:27,040
is gonna happen so um and I was in an improv class once I was telling the story and the girl across

556
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:32,480
from me was like the same thing happened to me and she was like my dad died and I was like after

557
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:38,320
he died I was watching home videos sitting on my bed alone no one else was there and I popped in a

558
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:43,360
tape and she was about to press eject and then she heard her dad's voice say no you're gonna you want

559
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:50,160
to watch this one and and it was yeah and I was like oh my god so crazy and then she said she

560
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:56,960
watched the video and it was just her dad on like on a log like in a lake like why she said it was

561
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:02,960
the most it was she said it was very uneventful and she didn't understand why that one but um it

562
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:11,040
was just so it feels very bad that you would be here check this one out yeah yeah yeah so um so yeah

563
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:18,880
I totally believe in like spirits and like yeah another plane but yeah I'm still terrified of

564
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:26,000
ghosts when I was when my my kid would wake up many times in the middle of the night and I would

565
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:31,360
have to feed her we live in this house right now that was built in 1942 and me and my fiance are

566
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:35,840
always saying it's haunted it's haunted so I'd be there in like the middle of the night feeding her

567
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:41,920
and I'd be like eyeing the closet or like waiting for something to pop out and it was like I'm so

568
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:47,120
glad she sleeps better now but it was it was that was so that was really terrifying for me

569
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:54,720
sure every Los Angeles has the most haunted energy and I grew up in Pennsylvania where

570
00:39:54,720 --> 00:40:01,680
everything used to be a battlefield where like people died uh so you're saying it's more haunted

571
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:07,840
here I feel like it's more haunted here I was in London and I was like the city is so fucking old

572
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:14,800
there has to be ghosts where I there has to be ghosts in this building um I yeah so that's so

573
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:23,680
funny um what about LA like I don't just the energy uh I mean you hear about like like early

574
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:30,880
20th century LA uh you know there there was all those like I mean late 20th century LA had tons

575
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:38,480
of cults and new age stuff but then the the the tent revivalists and like the the like just kind

576
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:45,040
of maniac protestants like which they touched on a little in that HBO Perry Mason show of like uh

577
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:55,200
uh uh radio televangel you know pre-televangelist radio preachers and stuff and I I don't know I

578
00:40:55,200 --> 00:41:01,600
I've read stuff about like people thinking like oh it's just the light out here like the light drew

579
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:08,080
early filmmakers because they needed so much light to develop old film but it's just like

580
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:14,160
it's just sunny all the time just can drive people nuts you know that's so interesting and

581
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:21,440
I find for me the way time moves in Los Angeles very strange because you know back east I feel

582
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:27,200
like you would I would track time with like blizzards or winter summer rainstorms and stuff

583
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:36,240
and it's just the lack of change in weather out here sometimes or or the significance like we're

584
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:43,200
in the time of year in LA where it's 80 in the day and then like 45 at night like it's just like

585
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:49,920
the 30 to 40 degree drop took a lot of time to get used to ghosts make the temperature go down

586
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:56,880
well they do if they're in the root like you know there's truth there uh I you know I always think

587
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,840
of this just I think I said this before on an episode there was I think it was Paul Thomas

588
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:04,720
Anderson talking to Mark Maron about like how the comedy store was haunted and never did anything

589
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:10,400
ring more true to me than that statement because I was like how many store is haunted if you've

590
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:17,360
ever been in there it's scarier than any haunted house probably there's just a bad bad energy there

591
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:22,320
yeah and that's why everybody mythologizes it's so like oh we get the store and like we came up

592
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:26,080
through the store and it's because you were probably like literally fighting ghosts and

593
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:33,600
spirits there um that makes the neon carlin uh sign is gonna come to life and chomp yeah it's

594
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:38,480
like the opening of the cartoon ghostbusters where like signs are coming to life and it's all just

595
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:45,120
yeah the jay Leno's name strangles you it flies off the wall and strangles all the signatures

596
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:49,840
all their spirits are in the signatures are all haunted they're all anthropomorphic signatures

597
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:57,040
that come to life and they well yeah that's what I mean that's pauli sure of course he's he grew

598
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:04,080
up there so he's been haunted his whole life uh mitzi everybody all the whole family yeah um so

599
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:08,880
are there any podcasts where you can hear about mitzi and pauli and the store I wonder if that's

600
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:14,960
ever been discussed on a podcast before probably not probably not yeah we might be the first we

601
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:22,320
should get them all on I've never I've never heard it before uh let's talk uh what is everyone's

602
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:29,280
favorite carnival ride I love the tilt aware I mean till the whereas you can find at fairs and

603
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:35,600
at like you know uh more more smaller amusement parks and stuff guys which one's the tilt world

604
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:44,000
I don't I actually don't know what's why is that who cares that's not so insane lian cannot know

605
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:50,080
with scott I just know what I don't think I've been on one and I don't know off hand here I'll

606
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:56,640
bring I'm gonna bring it up uh the only way is this is this eye when we dangle the carrot of

607
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:02,480
an episode about tilt aware else you'd ever buy it I have brought up doing tilt to rule before

608
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:08,400
and you've never revealed I don't know what that is yeah I mean that's a good reason to do an

609
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:15,360
episode I suppose uh to learn how I feel like someone listening though well if lian doesn't

610
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:20,640
know like there's I don't know I picture all the carnival rides I'm like yeah that one is the tall

611
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:26,160
one and the kind of round one that's the spinny one I don't necessarily know the names so here's

612
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:33,680
here's the tilt a world okay so it's big it's the one with the like clam shells oh oh oh and the

613
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:38,640
yes they're on a track that spins and then the whole thing is spinning and there's kind of like

614
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:46,560
an up and down to it and the only reason I'm so shocked is because we had like we had a tilt a

615
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:50,320
world at the local santa's village which is another theme park that we would go to once or

616
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:56,320
twice a year in addition to whenever a carnival was around and to me the tilt a role was my local

617
00:44:56,320 --> 00:45:02,320
space mountain it was the thing I got the most excited for I was so like that's that was like

618
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:07,200
number one when we would go to any of these places was like I got to get back on the tilt a world so

619
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:11,440
I sort of thought of it in the same way you would think of a classic Disney attraction which is the

620
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:16,880
reason I'm and I guess because I got thrown up on to it's loom so large I got puke all over me on

621
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:23,600
one of these things and yet still you're so fond I still am so fine I haven't been on one in a long

622
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:31,440
time um but yeah my memory is just I really was so I was just as excited to go on that as I was

623
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:38,080
big thunder or whatever yeah we would any I mean we went to the jersey shore a ton and the

624
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:44,560
playland in ocean city like as a kid uh that was my like all right first thing got to go on the

625
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:51,680
tilde world uh mom and or dad or uh mom mom or papa like you know someone would be dragged on

626
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:58,800
with me and I think I liked it because it's like thrilling but it is it's it's like low to the

627
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:06,480
ground and it's you feel I always felt very safe because you had a big bar and this big like yeah

628
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:13,040
the canopy and and so like it was thrilling but it took me a little while when I was young to build

629
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:17,920
up to roller coasters but I always like the sensation of the tilde world and I always like

630
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:23,440
so did mama and papa like it oh they loved it I mean there's a million pictures of us when I go

631
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:27,840
back to the shoe when we go down the shore now when I go back to visit one of them is going on

632
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:34,640
the tilde world with like more mama or papa huh mama or papa well they're dead I just never

633
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:40,320
heard you say those words and those are your grandparents yeah my grandparents are mama and

634
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:50,800
papa oh wait wait say spell it spell it out for me uh m o m oh m o m oh it's a I thought I was

635
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:56,880
ending with an a okay mum right no no this isn't yeah no this is the grandparents thing well it was

636
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:05,200
to distinguish they were mama and papa and then my dad's grandparents were gram gram and gram pop

637
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:12,320
I don't know how gram pop ended up the easy like the most uh normal one uh but to distinguish

638
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:19,520
between the one set of uh grandparents on the other pop pup is there a switch there no no it's

639
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:28,560
pop pop okay all right pop pop yeah just getting clarity um okay uh and I guess now I have tilde

640
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:34,480
world clarity as well I don't think I've ever been on a tilde world y'all wow I guess am I missing out

641
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:41,040
big time the end you have first thing what's the vaccine yeah it's fun I like that I like the tilting part of it

642
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:46,560
actually work because you kind of like go back and forth like that um yeah I think I think it's it

643
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:53,360
feels safe I would say yeah if you're afraid of heights it's fine I don't think it's too crazy I

644
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:59,760
think it's fun yeah oh I'm not it's not a scared issue I just think I just have not if been in

645
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:05,200
have I not been in front of what have I just passed by them and not chosen it I don't know so yeah you

646
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:10,080
don't even remember coming across a tilde world I'm sure I've been I'm sure I've been in the

647
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:16,640
vicinity of one and just not uh made a point of it okay let me ask you this then Scott have you been

648
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:21,040
in the vicinity of this ride which I'm assuming aesthetically you're going to love

649
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:28,880
oh a gravitron that was my that was one of my favorite ones there's that version and then

650
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:33,280
there's the version that's like open and it's just like a cage and you would just spin around

651
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:40,880
yeah that's my one of my two favorites I have never been on a gravitron yeah so that's so

652
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:46,640
gravitron is when I got a little older when I graduated to a more intense experience because

653
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:51,120
I was very freaked out by the idea of the gravitron and in case you don't know what it is

654
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:55,680
it's basically like a big flying saucer at least this version is where you go inside and it's

655
00:48:55,680 --> 00:49:03,920
completely enclosed and it spins around really fast and pins you to the wall so it's going for

656
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:10,160
a couple minutes I mean maybe it was 90 seconds I know it felt like forever and you could basically

657
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:16,240
turn like as if you could turn upside down on the wall basically because the force was pushing you

658
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:23,600
so so aggressively and yeah you would just have fun on the wall

659
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:31,040
and those little pads would like slide up like in this picture you pulled up this woman is like at

660
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:37,280
near the roof and like her body is spread across two pads that was so fun and we would try to like

661
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:43,360
lift our arms up against off the wall to see if you can like you can counter that centrifugal

662
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:50,000
force it was really fun I'm concerned about some of the ceilings I'm seeing though but partially for

663
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:57,680
filth partially for just big metal bars these things that look like spikes I mean probably

664
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:02,720
you're not ending up that that part of the ceiling like you're staying close to the wall but

665
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:07,360
I have my safety concerns about this one big time I don't think yeah you're not strapped in

666
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:12,400
that one is really crazy aesthetically Scott all of these oh it's fantastic it's like ELO

667
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:18,080
album covers I like them very much yes yeah but if I don't go on it I just get to look

668
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:25,120
I maybe I'm that that's the way I win is just looking at a gravitron would you go Scott would

669
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:34,960
you go on a gravitron right now uh you mean just in like bored uh quarantine at old state like would

670
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:40,880
I am I worn down enough to get on a gravitron I would say if it's quarantine I wouldn't go in a

671
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:46,400
enclosed space with a bunch of people well it's funny spinning around but say yeah say we're all

672
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:50,240
say we all have either a vaccine or a regeneron coursing through our veins

673
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:58,320
would you go on a gravitron if you came across it I guess so is there is there nothing else to do

674
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:03,760
well there's a tilt a whirl would you would you do it tilt a whirl first I'd say that would you let

675
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:10,000
me sweeten the pot Papa Scott will you take will you take a little Jason on the gravitron for the

676
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:18,080
first time well I guess if I'm helping make somebody a man then I can't resist that I'm

677
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:23,040
gonna do my part and then we'll take you on the tilde whirl oh if we can get a picture of the

678
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:29,440
three of us on a tilde we're all together uh vaccine coursing through our veins I mean vaccine

679
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:34,560
course that's gonna be stir it up it'll make it more effective it's like a centrifuge uh

680
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:41,040
in a science lab but giant I'm sorry but there's a picture to the far left

681
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:48,800
and it's titled how to win it gravitron and this guy's standing how how is that he's completely

682
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:55,600
90 degrees from all the other folks on it yeah I don't know fascinating he's uh he probably works

683
00:51:55,600 --> 00:52:01,600
there and he's been doing this and his legs are incredibly strong this is like the super pro

684
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:08,000
indoor skydivers how when we win us rubes us marks were waiting to indoor skydive and then

685
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:15,280
you're watching the guys who work they're super showing off yeah right so there's gravitron pros

686
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:23,200
out there right again what we're saying use rides.com 120 000 you can get a grab a gravitron wow we

687
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:29,600
should buy a gravitron cheaper than I have some I actually have some uh

688
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:38,240
related to this the possibility of buying attractions uh I came across some fun stuff

689
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:45,600
because um you know one thing I like to do with with various topics is go to ebay type in the

690
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:51,680
topic of the episode or some other anything else tangential and uh look for price highest first

691
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:57,440
to see how how crazily high we can get and what's some of the weird stuff up at the top

692
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:05,440
and uh I did a little bit of that I just put in carnival on ebay and that was it and uh I found a

693
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:11,520
bunch of stuff I'll share the screen here if if we're interested in starting our own carnival if

694
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:17,360
we feel like we want to you know prove ourselves more you know work with our hand prove that we're

695
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:23,520
you know able-bodied and start touring the country I think it'd be pretty easy for us to just buy

696
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:32,960
a couple of uh carnival rides because you just go on ebay and for only a million dollars

697
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:41,520
there's all these bizarre listings almost all of them are not exactly a million dollars but

698
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:49,360
999,900 they bring it a little bit down just to not get you to that seventh digit um but you know

699
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:53,360
here we got like a big uh I don't know what to call out of these there's a swing one there's a

700
00:53:53,360 --> 00:54:02,720
drop ride we could buy a drop ride for a million dollars yeah um and the the strange thing about

701
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:09,920
them when you click on all of these they all have kind of big like unseemly titles that go on and on

702
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:18,080
that all end with we finance and then every one of them uh it says item location is in delano

703
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:24,960
minnesota but then if you dig further into the seller it is clearly a chinese company the chinese

704
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:31,920
company is called zingaland and their tagline is we dare you not to laugh

705
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:43,120
my theory is that they say that they are in uh delano minnesota because like all right how do we

706
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:49,440
prove that we are american well let's just put a pin in the exact center of the country like the

707
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:55,280
middle of america uh and then everyone will believe us but all of these they're just all

708
00:54:55,280 --> 00:55:00,880
really weird if you click on them um they all have the most bizarre descriptions such as there's like

709
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:08,320
like a dumbo type ride with um with a honeybee and uh and here's the description of that this

710
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:15,600
hot sail honeybee is widely used in theme park adventure land etc just like you are flying in

711
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:21,360
the flowers feel the miracle and happiness so play with your family and enjoy your life

712
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:27,680
oh my gosh and then someone's like this is the answer this is what i

713
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:33,440
this is everything i've lacked happiness too much anxiety depression all the things we've been

714
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:39,760
talking about the answer is we have to buy this hot sail honeybee for six hundred thousand dollars

715
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:46,400
and the the answer to the mystery like so much on the internet nowadays it's like oh it's just a

716
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:51,360
drop shipping scam it's just a drop shipping scam you can find that ride for like a hundred

717
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:58,000
thousand dollars on alibaba they just rebranded uh stuff it should not cost that much money that

718
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:02,720
that feels weird to me and i don't think this is the way to start your carnival business i oh the

719
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:08,800
other shady thing about these there's one other ride uh that's a crazy octopus ride all right

720
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:14,480
what's some more info about that one and it says crazy octopus ride it has its roots in a piece of

721
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:21,280
classical latin literature from 45 bc this book is a treatise on the theory of ethics very popular

722
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:29,520
during the renaissance wait what it's a book look it's a crazy octopus ride why does its

723
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:35,520
descriptor say that it's a book from the renaissance about ethics zingaland is not

724
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:41,520
careful about it someone is searching someone is searching for a book on the renaissance on ebay

725
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:46,960
and they're looking at the description and it's a a fun-filled adventure for you and your children

726
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:50,400
um must be 42 inches or

727
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:57,840
if you're yeah if you're looking for renaissance books about ethics on ebay and then you don't

728
00:56:57,840 --> 00:57:04,560
read very carefully uh you might end up buying a million dollar carnival ride yeah really be

729
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:10,720
careful it's happening a lot i think i've heard so be careful it's a very common scam out there

730
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:16,800
but anyway you know we talk about wanting to own playland uh stuff from mcdonald's and you know we

731
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:23,920
we could have this hot sale honeybee um uh we need someone to put it but i like the idea of owning

732
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:29,760
a hot sale honeybee so let's just let's maybe make a best offer maybe offer a price on ebay

733
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:36,720
oh sure uh what's the what's the offer price like uh nine hundred and fifty thousand dollars

734
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:41,760
okay oh you're still keeping it high all right i was gonna say i'll put seven dollars on this offer

735
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:43,840
okay well you could go that way if you want

736
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:49,360
i just want to be respectful seven to chip into our 950

737
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:58,560
leanne uh when you were working do you said i caught did you say you got keys to a ride

738
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:06,480
no uh a golf cart because we got keys with golf cars yeah oh i thought you said so card i think

739
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:12,720
oh no no no no no no i didn't get any access to any rights i got i got tickets and i i did

740
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:17,440
ride the ferris wheel no i did ride the ferris wheel that's right um and it was just real i think

741
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:23,520
it was just to relax at the end of the day um and it was just really slow it was small too it wasn't

742
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:29,520
huge um and that's yeah uh no no tickets i have a question from back in the boot when you were

743
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:33,920
describing the scenario this is a community service scenario in which then at the end of the day you

744
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:41,360
get tickets so you this is like a circular thing like you could in order to save money on tickets

745
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:48,160
run traffic lights go to court try to hope that you get to work at a carnival and then truly yeah

746
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:54,960
i didn't have to pay anything and i got to run a red light um it's a thrill attraction in and of

747
00:58:54,960 --> 00:59:02,160
itself yes that was yeah that's a that was a thrill ride um yeah i think um i don't it was so weird

748
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:07,600
the city was connected to it somehow the woman running it like didn't really care what i did

749
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:14,080
and i the whole time i was there i was terrified that everyone thought i was like a convict who

750
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:18,480
was doing community like they didn't know what like why i was doing community service so that

751
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:26,400
was always in the back of my mind um but yeah i i it it didn't feel like work and uh and it i felt

752
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:31,600
like i was those kids like they probably made 11 bucks an hour um i just felt like i was just like

753
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:38,080
in my teens again like in a minimum wage job hanging out and um what streaming service has

754
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:50,320
optioned this story uh quibi oh i'm so sorry bad news really sorry but no i haven't been reading

755
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:57,520
the trades i guess unfortunately the quibi office is packed up in the middle of the night and now

756
00:59:57,520 --> 01:00:01,840
it's just an empty field again with some old like the only proof it was ever there was just

757
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:08,720
some old flyers and uh prumbled up janitor sweeping up yeah cotton candy sticks there's like a one

758
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:14,240
glass jar of the candy uh and by janitor sweeping up still kind of smells like pizza

759
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,080
grissy teigen we've never heard of her

760
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:20,240
uh

761
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:28,400
at jeffrey kassenberg the worst advance man uh to use a carnival term the person who beats the

762
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:34,960
show into town and oh yeah does all the permits and uh potentially payoffs if need be jason reading

763
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:41,920
all these terms were you like this should have been my life i mean yeah it was kind of like oh

764
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:48,400
man this is so deep there's so much here that's so yeah i i could have lived this at least for a

765
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:54,400
summer or two or you're a big music man fan you like the idea of rolling into town in a cart and

766
01:00:55,040 --> 01:01:00,000
fooling a bunch of people and then leaving that's like a dream of yours last train out when they're

767
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:05,120
chasing you to the train and you're hopping on the caboose uh it's the michael jackson paul

768
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:11,600
mccartney say say say video yes you're selling people an elixir that doesn't work

769
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:19,920
uh yeah i i do wonder though like some of this carney uh lingo uh i had never heard have you

770
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:27,280
guys ever heard of a carney marriage i don't think so this was weird oh yeah what's what's

771
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:32,640
a carney marriage this okay this was a little it's one of those things where it's like a little too

772
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:38,160
perfect like where someone's like ah you're re i had the idea for the title of the movie it came

773
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:45,280
to me in the moment um this website says a carney marriage carneys are an unromantic lot as a rule

774
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:53,840
what according to others as a sign that a couple intends to be monogamous parentheses or relatively

775
01:01:53,840 --> 01:02:02,000
so for a while thus keeping the individuals more or less from straying and from unwanted romantic

776
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:08,960
advances they may engage in a carney marriage the sign that they are quote married in the eyes of

777
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:16,560
their fellows is a ride once around on the carousel or first wheel uh a divorce is less formal

778
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:22,640
sometimes with a ride turning in the other direction but more often at the end of the season

779
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:29,360
or when both parties just say to hell with it wait that's crazy but that also makes me think

780
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:34,320
that they're just all fucking all the time and they're like wait a minute guys we're monogamous

781
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:41,680
oh yeah i mean get on the ride you could probably honestly i had never thought about that but that

782
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:47,280
makes of course too much sense that there's just a whole like we're like 15 people and we're all

783
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:55,840
married to each other yeah and also you the guests once you buy a ticket you are married to us for

784
01:02:55,840 --> 01:03:01,120
the night you are married to us and uh it's gonna be a great three days it's gonna be a great long

785
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:08,240
weekend marriage no no no why are we people are mad about the phrase um i don't know i'm not a

786
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:13,760
barker that's an offensive term barker but but like well what do you feel about carney oh yeah

787
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:19,360
love it i'm a carney i'm one of the carnies and uh i'll engage in a carney marriage like you think

788
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:26,160
that would be the offensive term if any right well right but we're in a field where people are

789
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:34,800
still mad about sketch versus skit you know so who are we to just sketch skit yes skits i sure am

790
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:42,080
don't demean what i do with don't skits if your parents says skit they're an idiot they're out of

791
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:47,360
here yeah that's a sketch you know we have vassar make sketches

792
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:55,040
that with there being no uh my that you know there won't be like a big family holiday party

793
01:03:55,040 --> 01:04:02,320
for me this year i don't have to have the part where uh a uh one of my parents friends tells me

794
01:04:02,320 --> 01:04:07,360
an idea points to someone at the party and says now they're a character you know you should do

795
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:10,400
make something about them put in one of jay leno's skits

796
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:16,720
like i feel like that's still what happened like still somebody will tell me to submit something

797
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:27,440
to jay leno now for a cnbc car show no for the jay leno for jay leno's skit show

798
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:29,920
what are you talking about off the air for five years

799
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:37,920
uh not as far as i know i haven't turned on a tv in a number of years so he's still doing skits

800
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:46,160
ain't he gotta be uh leon let's talk uh carnival food oh yeah funnel cake love funnel cake funnel

801
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:51,840
cake i also yeah also at the orange county fair i which is a fair not it's kind of like a it's

802
01:04:51,840 --> 01:04:58,800
the same thing it's they're just like you said before it's planted um i had a hamburger on a

803
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:06,560
crispy cream donut and that is shit is so good it is like it is it's crack it's like the fat

804
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:14,400
and it's so good it's so it'll make your stomach hurt it's a beef patty does it have everything on

805
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:20,960
it as far as lettuce and tomato no it's like it's just beef cheese or not option and then the

806
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:27,360
crispy cream donut it's very good any no ketchup or anything either no no just the beef okay

807
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:34,480
that makes sense i mean at first my first instinct is to say that does that probably is good but it

808
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:37,600
also sounds disgusting but if you really think about it like eating uh eating something on a

809
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:45,840
hawaiian sweet roll it's not so different than having a donut it's not and it's just like fatty

810
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:56,000
cheesy meaty sweet i i was eating a sandwich a couple days ago and i had a donut and i

811
01:05:57,520 --> 01:06:01,920
as i said i've been i've been alone for a couple days uh and i ran out of dishes

812
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:06,800
they were clean they were all in the dishwasher i just hadn't run it i just hadn't run it it's

813
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:13,440
not like they were in the sink i swear to god uh so i put it in a bowl i put it yeah i put it in a

814
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:18,480
bowl and then i put a donut on top of the sandwich and i was like hmm and i took like a button i was

815
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:24,240
like that's not that's good that has to like that is good it's not gross i mean it's gross but it's

816
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:29,680
good it's weird it's weirdly good it just like hits all of the like everything in on your tongue

817
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:38,400
that's like this is crack i love it um i like uh funnel cake that and then i recently started trying

818
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:44,800
um fried things like i'd never tried it and it's like fried oreos or fried um

819
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:53,120
yeah snickers or i'll see like deep fried twinkies that exist i haven't tried those but it's like

820
01:06:53,120 --> 01:06:57,440
especially at the county fairs i've seen the pictures of the menu which is like what you're

821
01:06:57,440 --> 01:07:04,080
saying it's just like deep fried oreos and it's like five or five pieces that are all deep fried

822
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:11,280
and then yeah twinkies that are like have three layers of fat instead of one yeah yeah uh i have

823
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:18,480
not tried a lot of those uh uh what would you call them onstrosities is that too mean to the food

824
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:24,720
they're like food i think is the term yeah uh fair food okay that's nicer than uh than um

825
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:34,960
culinary horrors culinary abominations godless food godless food they don't exist anywhere else

826
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:43,040
but fairs and carnivals right so it's crazy the the the deep fried oreos i think are a little genius

827
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:48,400
because it gets soggy and so it's just like having a donut with just like chocolate and frosting in

828
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:55,120
the middle so it doesn't right the oreo is gone and it's just like a chocolatey frosty donut

829
01:07:56,400 --> 01:08:03,680
yeah i mean the best executions of oreos are you dip it in milk or like you pulverize it into ice

830
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:11,120
cream so you know changing it in some ways i know i yeah i actually hate oreos is that right people

831
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:16,800
don't like oreos just as they come they're fucking they're so gross like the cookie part is so dry

832
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:24,080
um the frosting is good i don't know i like the uh vanilla oreos but not chocolate oreos

833
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:29,280
interesting i guess i've heard that opinion i'm fine with cookies for whatever reason i like

834
01:08:29,280 --> 01:08:35,920
oreos i like the i like oreos uh in general but i don't have them a lot i do think i probably like

835
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:41,520
the double stuff oreos better because i the frosting is my favorite part um you're gonna

836
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:47,200
think i'm insane i've done the like thin ones where you get less cream i'm not saying i prefer

837
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:53,600
that but i've chosen i tried that i feel like having the thin one yeah i think it's an interesting

838
01:08:54,640 --> 01:09:00,240
i i don't taste like chocolate either it's just yeah they're not they're not chocolate true it's

839
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:08,400
yeah it's some other thing it's some a bitter dry yeah it's shocky i guess i don't deny any of this

840
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:13,840
don't mind it for whatever reason it's comforting though because you had him as kids that's sort of

841
01:09:13,840 --> 01:09:23,760
maybe a lot of yeah jason is still a milk and ice cream cookie dunker which i am not uh milk wait

842
01:09:24,320 --> 01:09:32,560
you you dunk cookies in milk yeah i'll do soy milk or almond milk a regular meal like once a week

843
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:39,040
i eat cookies most days yeah right but i but i'm saying like that to me feels like yeah you still

844
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:45,600
regularly dip cookies in milk yes correct how many hours ago did you do it is what i'm asking

845
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:50,240
i haven't done it in a while i ate ice cream last night but not a lot because it was cold so i was

846
01:09:50,240 --> 01:09:56,000
getting cold even colder eating the ice spirits the spirits were out last night they were in the ice cream

847
01:09:56,160 --> 01:09:56,960
now

848
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:04,000
but i i i would dunk i i guess we really actually didn't even dunk cookies and milk a lot when i was

849
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:10,720
a kid so i guess i didn't even have that as part of a ritual yeah i don't do it that often but i do

850
01:10:10,720 --> 01:10:16,560
like i do i understand the appeal of it oreos are much better dipped in milk because it gets softer

851
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:22,560
so you get a little it gets a little squishy i get it but i don't do i don't seek out a glass of milk

852
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:27,920
as soon as i have a cookie in my hand i just yeah and it's also look i'm uh i'm giving jason

853
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:33,200
some grief but honestly like is it that much different than having like lucky charm cereal

854
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:38,880
like it's just a bunch of candy it's just candy soaking in milk do you do that mike have you been

855
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:46,880
having lucky charms i um i will say i had a big box of fruity pebbles a couple weeks ago

856
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:54,480
yes my breakfast was fruity pebbles with banana so today yeah two hours ago yes

857
01:10:55,920 --> 01:11:04,240
you eat dessert all day every day i know yeah how are you both not just like hulking creatures

858
01:11:04,240 --> 01:11:12,480
that's what i i'm impressed that you don't just swell up i'm six three i walk a lot and i uh

859
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:18,800
often forget to eat other meals i just feel like oh i feel like garbage it's like oh it's dinner

860
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:26,400
time i forgot lunch i had the lucky charms and only water i wasn't when i was young i was never

861
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:32,560
allowed to have those i was so jealous of people who had those um cereals like i go to friends

862
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:38,480
houses and open their cupboards and so i never i think that the closest i got to sugar cereal was

863
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:44,800
like corn pops um and to this day i don't know if i've ever had lucky charms i don't think i've

864
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:50,240
ever had it yeah i wonder sure i have either this is another is another one of those tilt the world

865
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:57,840
i'm not sure that i've i have eaten fruity pebbles or lucky charms any maybe either your co-hosts are

866
01:11:57,840 --> 01:12:05,120
just going to give you the best fucking day of your life as soon as covid's over here stuff it in

867
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:14,160

868
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:20,480
tricks yes you think so this is shocking i haven't i mean i haven't had anything resembling any of

869
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:26,240
this in 20 years that that i can say with that's fine i'm not offended by that yeah cinnamon toast

870
01:12:26,240 --> 01:12:34,960
crunch yeah i'm not sure i don't think i'm gonna sue too sugar yeah because that was always a staple

871
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:41,200
of the little boxes at like hotels or like the right breakfast so i would get it there yeah wow

872
01:12:41,200 --> 01:12:47,200
this is blowing honestly this is blowing my mind uh yeah that's interesting because we you have

873
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:52,720
affection for a lot of these masks have you had the monster cereals conchocula boo berry

874
01:12:52,720 --> 01:13:03,680
frankenberry i have never had any of this wow wow i i don't know uh uh i i don't regret it

875
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:09,200
though i don't know it's fine i think it'd be a bizarre diet to be fighting today that would be

876
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:16,080
constantly having the craving for for boo berries scott is from uh here california i'm from here

877
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:20,800
yeah is it is this too personal a question can i ask what your parents did when you were younger

878
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:27,520
what they did yeah they're like profession uh uh teacher and lawyer oh wow

879
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:34,080
um okay neither of them was like they were like professors or like no professors

880
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:42,000
and none of them was a were none of them was an elf or a leprechaun or a vampire or a or a

881
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:48,000
frankenstein if that if that's part of the question so if that influenced my cereal taste my parents

882
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:56,640
were sugar salespeople ah that makes sense they both sold sugar for a living sugar barkers sugar

883
01:13:57,280 --> 01:14:00,640
well they didn't like sugar talkers they didn't they like sugar talkers better yeah

884
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:07,520
and mine one was a kelog one was a mills so uh yeah i guess their families viewed it yes they were

885
01:14:08,160 --> 01:14:16,480
they were starcross cereal lovers yeah we only eat this in our um let me i'm gonna talk about a

886
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:22,240
carnival right here uh a ride called the zipper do you guys know what a zipper is if i say it off

887
01:14:22,240 --> 01:14:29,920
hand uh i think it spins around it's like a tiny track in it it's yeah you're like uh you know the

888
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:36,480
ride is is like a big big boom i saw it described as um you know there's a big wheel on either end

889
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:44,880
like uh that rotates around uh so you're you're basically uh uh your vehicle spins along this big

890
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:53,360
thing as the entire thing flips around 360 and uh you are in one of you know 12 to 14

891
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:59,120
little l-shaped cages um does that sound familiar when i say it's kind of like a seat

892
01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:06,240
shaped like you could see where the you know you you would you would rest there on the bench um

893
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:10,400
this is the thing when i was thinking about carl stuff like you know that this is the thing i would

894
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:16,400
not do zippers seem terrifying to me and seem shady to me uh and then i was looking into it and

895
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:23,840
i don't think they have been shady for a long time but in the 70s four people died on the zipper

896
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:31,600
and they had to dramatically change how they did zippers forever uh um there's one incident where

897
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:37,360
uh it was an 18 year old worker who was manning the thing i don't know what happened he said that

898
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:42,800
he locked it up but then they near the site of it they found a loose pin on the ground

899
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:48,240
which they were like that's all that it was was a pin it was all it was keeping the door from opening

900
01:15:48,240 --> 01:15:56,960
up like 100 feet in the air um anyway and and uh so they just had to the zippers are not over they

901
01:15:56,960 --> 01:16:01,840
do zippers still today but they had to change how they build them uh jason i don't know if you grew

902
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:08,320
up with a aware of a congressman named bud schuster um we have an old battle axe in

903
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:14,800
pennsylvania he tried to start a motion to uh to ban zippers and it didn't work he didn't

904
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:23,360
zippers were not banned jason do you know him i don't know him no um he seems kind of fun he was

905
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:31,040
very uh anti-zipper and yet also a vocal opponent of the airbag like when ralph nader's trying to

906
01:16:31,680 --> 01:16:42,080
airbags i understand that seems like uh priorities yeah did where did nader try to ban zippers

907
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:47,920
uh he did not i yeah i don't i don't know and i don't think nader has uh weighed in on a zipper

908
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:55,040
yeah yeah he didn't care a lot about the carnival industry i guess was that anti-airbag no no pro airbag

909
01:16:55,120 --> 01:17:02,800
he was a big he was a big yes car safety advocate and seatbelt active or active it i think i said

910
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:10,400
activate advocate would be the word and i should learn how to speak uh that makes sense uh um yeah

911
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:16,800
nader is the guy nader's the guy with seat but he's the he was the foushee of uh safety for basically

912
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:22,320
yeah of course so he now today we'd all be furious at him for trying to make us not die

913
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:27,920
and well people were furious at him a couple years ago oh yeah oh yeah people are yeah i guess so

914
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:33,280
people are always mad at people are always mad wait why were people mad at him a few years ago

915
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:39,760
well because he ran for president uh the gold bush and they believe you know yeah i thought that was

916
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:44,000
i thought you meant people are mad at falchi a few years ago and i was like i don't

917
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:51,360
were they i was i was confused because that was 20 years ago i was thinking that's my reference for

918
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:58,400
nader too but yeah yeah i was like what has he done he's back what's he up to right right um so

919
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:03,040
no zippers for me with that history even though they've even though they fixed them i've never

920
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:11,840
been on the zipper that does make me uncomfortable that's one of those rides where i'd have to go

921
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:17,920
all right i'm doing it for the podcast which is a thing i think about now there's rides that i really

922
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:21,440
really don't want to go on i don't want to go on tatsu at six flags which is the one where you're

923
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:26,320
kind of like supermanning right that's that's the right it's the yeah they lie you down as you go

924
01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:31,040
right you're on your stomach essentially going through the air i really really am terrified of

925
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:41,280
it but if i can go well i gotta go on for the show it'll be funny for the show i probably will do it

926
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:46,400
but i really am scared of it well the reason i never went on a gravitron is because the way

927
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:53,520
it was explained to me was like okay you go in there's no seatbelts and i believe when it was

928
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:58,640
explained to me it was called someone was like it's called the hell hole and you go in there's no

929
01:18:58,640 --> 01:19:03,840
seatbelts and it starts spinning really fast and you're pressed against the wall and then the floor

930
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:10,640
drops out and i think that's a bit of an exaggeration from the floor slowly lowers and you don't really

931
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:16,240
need it because you're pressed against the wall and i think at some point they may have added like

932
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:22,640
light restraints like okay everyone the older ones you're not attached to anything but like yeah

933
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:28,160
newer ones they strap you in you can't do as much so right i would probably try it now

934
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:36,800
um kamikaze like other rides the kamikaze which is that's the like almost like they've i've seen

935
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:41,440
versions of where it's like a pirate ship and it basically swings back and forth yeah oh i love that

936
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:48,800
yeah um i've never been on one of those i like the pirate ship uh that was my second one of

937
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:53,600
two of my favorite carnival rides but yeah i couldn't go on the kamikaze either

938
01:19:54,400 --> 01:20:01,600
it's too terrifying like the two the two blades basically that go back and forth yeah yeah i see

939
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:09,600
i see now um yeah no probably you're not gonna do that no kamikazes no um

940
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:18,240
uh you know you're you're more committed i suppose uh uh you know doing things for the podcast

941
01:20:18,240 --> 01:20:24,560
you're right might it be funny if i went on the kamikaze maybe um do do i feel guilty in any way

942
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:30,960
but not no not at all let me ask you this if we were doing like a tv show would you be like oh

943
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:36,000
god all right i'll do it for the show like if like to be because it would be funny to watch us be

944
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:41,680
scared i suppose so there'd be more in it because it would like what's the point really in going so

945
01:20:41,680 --> 01:20:46,960
then i got in the thing and i was so scared you should have seen me if you had seen the look on

946
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:53,360
my face but if i guess if yeah if there was a visual component um they maybe there'd be more

947
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:59,360
in it right we uh lianne we've talked about before scott's a big beach boys fan and i had to entice

948
01:20:59,360 --> 01:21:05,040
him to be i get on one of these scary rides uh i said if you were to ride it with beach boy mike

949
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:09,600
love would that be enough incentive to get on and i'm trying to remember it was what ride was it again

950
01:21:10,720 --> 01:21:18,480
was that uh king daca the uh the very scary coaster in new jersey isn't mike love like the bad one like

951
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:25,280
he's oh yeah yeah for sure he's a bad man but of course you know i want to like ask him questions

952
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:30,400
and stuff okay that's fair yeah it'd be maybe be the most interesting to talk to in a way yeah

953
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:36,400
yeah but is there anything man lianne is there any like celebrity you would be like well i'd have to

954
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:41,840
go on with this person like because the photo op would be insane so you would get back on a crazy

955
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:46,480
rollercoaster like goliath like i would go on with this celebrity or even just for a large amount of

956
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:53,120
money is there a price oh large amount of money for sure okay okay so goliath yeah i would do

957
01:21:53,120 --> 01:22:02,400
goliath oh god does anyone pop into your mind like well i gotta do it if i don't know i don't

958
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:08,880
i don't think there's anyone in the world that i like okay i don't celebrity doesn't sure i don't

959
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:16,800
know i just don't i mean okay maybe if i could have lunch with like um like paul mccartney or

960
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:20,640
okay but not goliath with paul no

961
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:27,600
i feel like i couldn't enjoy i couldn't talk to him right right i it might kill him like i wouldn't

962
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:32,400
want to do that now that is a concern yeah that is a concern yeah michael love worry too yeah yeah

963
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:38,560
but what if michael but if michael have died next to you on king to koscot well there we get yes if

964
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:45,600
i'm present for the moment of michael loves demise i think if i could like stand in line with him for

965
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:50,720
an hour and then you know the price is going on the ride yeah paul paul is so cheap he doesn't

966
01:22:50,720 --> 01:22:59,760
pay for the fast pass okay i just like i like that question because i try to gauge exactly how

967
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:06,960
worth the fear is it was like an easy one or if it's like no well i guess money i i wouldn't go

968
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:16,160
below like 20 000 okay that's yeah the fear is strong yeah yeah um i'm trying to think what other

969
01:23:16,160 --> 01:23:22,240
oh uh bumper cars got the car in the hold what do we do we like bumper cars because i feel like

970
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:30,720
i always like the idea of it but it was never a satisfying experience i was i like them but i

971
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:36,880
feel like there were kids who would get in and immediately were like i got this like i know how

972
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:43,680
to nail people and i feel like every now and then like there were some very slow moving well i like

973
01:23:43,680 --> 01:23:49,520
like the the when i was younger the really little ones because you can't do too much damage but i

974
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:55,600
feel like i got nailed a number of times at like some of the bigger faster ones oh and there's

975
01:23:55,600 --> 01:24:01,200
some where you're only supposed to go one direction and i i fucked that up as a kid

976
01:24:01,200 --> 01:24:06,160
once like you're supposed to go around an area and i had never encountered that i had always

977
01:24:06,160 --> 01:24:10,880
encountered like the big open ones and like started immediately going the wrong way and

978
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:16,480
everyone started yelling at me so that was an unpleasant experience yeah leon were you gonna

979
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:22,880
say something i yeah i liked it because like all it was uneventful i feel and anticlimactic but

980
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:28,320
it was fun that like you and like six friends could be in like a same space together rather

981
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:32,560
than yeah i just felt like that was the best part like you could look across and be like oh yeah

982
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:37,520
that's my friend i'm gonna go get you right it felt yeah it felt like a little more yeah you could

983
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:42,640
like it felt like you had a lot of freedom too but you really didn't have too much and then i think

984
01:24:42,640 --> 01:24:48,160
i was in jason's boat where i would just get like nailed constantly i wasn't doing any of the

985
01:24:48,160 --> 01:24:54,480
aggressive stuff i was just getting hit over and over again yeah i think as long as we got no sparks

986
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:59,920
like i don't want to see like large physical sparks yeah yeah that's where it gets shady

987
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:04,320
isn't that how they operated like there'd be like a pole that would touch the top and it would just

988
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:11,440
like it would just like yeah yeah is that still just what it is like in a more elevated park

989
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:17,120
like a knots is it just uh or are we just sparking up is that how it still works i don't i think

990
01:25:17,120 --> 01:25:20,480
there's different versions of it because i remember there was sort of uh and i don't i

991
01:25:20,480 --> 01:25:25,520
really should look into it but it was only there in my hometown there was like a big building and

992
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:30,560
all of a sudden just this like like carnival opened up inside of it i think they were going

993
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:35,120
for a chuck-e-cheese thing but it was just like a big empty warehouse and they set up a bunch of

994
01:25:35,120 --> 01:25:40,640
games in there and there wasn't like a ceiling on their bumper cars and the bumper and whatever

995
01:25:40,640 --> 01:25:46,400
the gentleman carney who was working it would hop on the back of the cars while you were riding

996
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:54,880
which was scary very scary but there was yeah there was no ceiling there were no sparks in

997
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:58,000
that version so i wonder if there's a couple different i mean i guess we'll probably get

998
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:03,680
into it when we eventually do bumper car episode uh but there's another podcast that we've sort

999
01:26:03,680 --> 01:26:10,080
of have a feud with that kind of specializes in uh bumper cars um so i don't know is there really

1000
01:26:10,720 --> 01:26:16,880
the bumper car boys are our enemies i've never looked into it but they they talk about

1001
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:23,120
like they don't care about disney or universal or the big good one they they talk about bumper cars

1002
01:26:23,120 --> 01:26:28,880
like 85 percent of the episodes just really like give a big finger to everything that we like and

1003
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:33,920
that's why they're our enemies yeah so this this episode in general might be we're gonna get their

1004
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:39,440
ire yeah that we're even like infringing on their territory at all but yeah we're allowed to talk

1005
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:44,560
about whatever we want right we can do it uh so yeah i think there's a variety of ways yeah

1006
01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:49,600
the bumper car mechanism can work um it'd be another good it's always that narrow space it

1007
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:53,600
is like a floor of an office building and if they are looking for something to do with the former

1008
01:26:53,600 --> 01:27:02,800
quibi office it's converting it into yeah yeah just make that ceiling electric yeah that'd be

1009
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:09,920
easy enough um so yeah i i'm not a huge fan of bumper cars but again i like the idea of it

1010
01:27:11,200 --> 01:27:16,800
um i i i go karts i like the idea of more i though i've never actually been go karting

1011
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:26,800
oh i went once in vegas um it was pretty i think it was fine i guess i think it'd be more fun when

1012
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:32,320
i was younger and i didn't drive a car uh sure and like yeah like cool i guess you know this

1013
01:27:32,320 --> 01:27:36,000
but when you get it it's just like this little like cart and you just drive around a track and

1014
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:41,120
and you can't like bump it you can't do what you can do with bumper cars it's right you can't run

1015
01:27:41,120 --> 01:27:48,000
red lights you're living dangerously on the real road yeah yeah i was like i could take my car

1016
01:27:49,280 --> 01:27:55,840
80 miles per hour at that little bumper car sure um yeah what have we talked about there's the i

1017
01:27:55,840 --> 01:28:01,120
don't know this is the ring of fire that's the sort of just like gains momentum in a big loop

1018
01:28:01,120 --> 01:28:06,800
until it spins all the way around but it's really unnerving like because it does like right before

1019
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:12,800
it does the full one it like is almost there and then hangs for a little bit i think you know what

1020
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:18,080
bugs me about a lot of them and i put zipper in the sand ring of fire is the resemblance to cages

1021
01:28:18,640 --> 01:28:25,520
just that you it's not a fun cage like casey jr i don't i don't find them fun because of the like

1022
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:32,720
it's just such small inescapable it's like the lots of little triangles kind of cage and then it

1023
01:28:32,720 --> 01:28:38,720
and then the cage is going to do a thing that kind of upsets my body i'm in a mobile cage it's going

1024
01:28:38,720 --> 01:28:44,160
to upset me and that's what a lot of these things feel like to me it feels like maybe like the last

1025
01:28:44,160 --> 01:28:49,280
ride on the zipper before the carnival leaves town they just say keep the doors locked all the people

1026
01:28:49,280 --> 01:28:54,080
get stuck in there and then they take them to the next town and then train them to be carnies against

1027
01:28:54,320 --> 01:29:01,040
they like brainwash them along the way right oh god all the cars are pumped full of like

1028
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:07,120
audio teaching them carnie language it's they're just like reciting that dictionary that glossary

1029
01:29:07,120 --> 01:29:12,640
that jason read we're playing for another big and we're thinking or lamborans is like this hypnotic

1030
01:29:12,640 --> 01:29:22,320
kind of thing that drives you in two big and that's a good marker yeah so well i were onto this

1031
01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:27,840
carnie brainwashing scam that's why yeah no last ride of the night for don't ever do it

1032
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:34,000
if anyone listening you're just going to get driven one town over before you know it and you're like

1033
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:39,360
you get out of there and you're way more grizzled you look like you aged 30 years you use lots of

1034
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:45,920
like technology like marks nobody knows what you're talking about anymore well it's it's

1035
01:29:45,920 --> 01:29:51,920
punishment it's the two things one this is literally i believe the plot of something wicked this way

1036
01:29:51,920 --> 01:29:58,000
comes the red ray bradbury book i think a very old jason robards was in the movie version

1037
01:29:59,680 --> 01:30:07,920
and two i bet the people that they do that to are two of my favorite phrases i came across in the

1038
01:30:07,920 --> 01:30:15,680
glossary lot lice and looky loos those are the guests who come early stay late and they walk

1039
01:30:15,760 --> 01:30:21,600
around and they don't buy anything so that's their that's their punishment they get loaded up and

1040
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:26,640
they get loaded into the ride and driven to the next town so don't if you're a lot lice or a

1041
01:30:26,640 --> 01:30:33,440
looky lou you know don't be a looky lou don't be they just developed 30 ways to show their disdain

1042
01:30:33,440 --> 01:30:40,480
for everybody who comes to their carnivals all of this stuff all of this american entertain and i

1043
01:30:40,480 --> 01:30:44,800
and i think like they had fun fairs in the uk but all this stuff started just to be tricks

1044
01:30:44,800 --> 01:30:49,680
everything was just a trick everything yeah it's just to swindle people yeah it was just like

1045
01:30:49,680 --> 01:30:55,200
told and now it's so funny you were talking earlier about how like all of entertainment

1046
01:30:55,200 --> 01:31:01,680
sort of comes from this and it does yeah you know like comedy the variety show all of that stuff

1047
01:31:02,240 --> 01:31:08,560
and it's become this like multi-billion dollar industry but yeah it's so funny that it started

1048
01:31:08,640 --> 01:31:11,440
out just like how can we swindle all these people out of their money

1049
01:31:14,480 --> 01:31:21,520

and get demented and yell at jodie foster he seems to like sort of abduct her and there's a

1066
