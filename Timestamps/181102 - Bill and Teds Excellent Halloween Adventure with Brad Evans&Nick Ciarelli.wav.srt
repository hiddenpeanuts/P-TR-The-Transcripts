1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:02,680
Forever!

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:03,320
Dog!

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:09,000
Trigger Warning

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,020
If you're easily offended, today's haunt cast the fright might not be for you, okay?

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,060
So, uh, PC Police, turn your sirens off.

6
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:22,960
Uh, Vice Reporters, go eat some avocado toast.

7
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:26,320
And, uh, Snowflakes, get melted.

8
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:35,960
It's time for twisted cameos from pop culture figures like Brad Evans, Nick Cerelli, and yeah, Dr. Evil.

9
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:41,400
This is Bill and Ted's excellent Halloween adventure on Haunt Cast the Fright.

10
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:09,060
Welcome to Haunt Cast the Fright, a scary themed podcast event that much like Universal's Halloween Horror Nights is spreading into November.

11
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:13,060
Devilishly spreading past the month of October.

12
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:17,980
Uh, there, that's my justification of why we're still doing this past Halloween.

13
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,720
Uh, Mike Carlson is here, hello.

14
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,780
Yeah, and it makes sense because all the other, like, theme parks do past Halloween.

15
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,040
They go a week past with Horror Nights, they go, I think, with, with Knots, goes like a week past.

16
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,140
So this makes sense that we-

17
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,460
It does, that's why this is fine.

18
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,320
There we go.

19
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:36,020
Uh, Jason Sheridan.

20
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:40,360
Yeah, I had written down, like, oh, are we gonna use that justification?

21
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:44,100
I totally forgot to talk about it before this recording.

22
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:44,740
Of course we are.

23
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:48,220
And so I'm glad we just, like, all silently agreed to that.

24
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,980
That's exactly why.

25
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:55,200
If the audience would like us to keep explaining the justification, we're more than happy to.

26
00:01:55,420 --> 00:02:00,740
I don't think I said my own name, which is Scott Gardner, and now I will say the names of our guests.

27
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,080
But first, why they are here, it's a very specific reason.

28
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:10,180
I mean, first of all, they're very, they're very funny, very prolific writers from the UCB Theater in Los Angeles.

29
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:17,520
But also, they are two of the gentlemen who were brave enough to carry the torch, or perhaps the skewer,

30
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:23,760
in order to keep today's topic, Bill and Ted's Excellent Halloween Adventure, going,

31
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,540
even though it had been canceled by Universal Studios Hollywood.

32
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:32,680
You guys did a reprise of it at the UCB Theater for a couple of years.

33
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,680
And yes, I'm talking about Brad Evans and Nick Cirelli.

34
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,000
Thanks for being here, guys.

35
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:38,580
Hi.

36
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:39,980
Hi, thank you for having us.

37
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,240
Absolutely.

38
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:50,280
But and thank you for all for your work carrying this franchise beyond its sad theme park demise.

39
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:56,140
Yeah, without without permission from Universal Studios or whoever owns the rights to the character.

40
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:57,440
Yeah, whoever owns Bill and Ted.

41
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,060
But they were parodying so many different properties.

42
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:04,540
You guys were just carrying on that torch of parroting something that you didn't have the rights to.

43
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:04,960
Yeah.

44
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,680
That's really what that's the spirit of the show is what I'm saying.

45
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:14,760
Yeah. And carrying on the tradition of skirting legality issues in terms of intellectual property rights.

46
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:22,420
It seemed like Universal was haunted, fittingly enough, by like lawsuit worries.

47
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:30,240
Yeah, they were unable to use certain characters in the Bill and Ted Halloween show because yeah, I mean, it should be covered by parody law, I think.

48
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,640
Really? So that's why I was wrong. So there were like lawsuits.

49
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,120
I learned so much today.

50
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,760
That's the root. Well, that seems to be what they're implying.

51
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:43,860
About why you can't they couldn't take photos or video at a certain point from the audience.

52
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:48,560
It seemed like there was a certain point where like they were really cracking down on it.

53
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,920
Then maybe there was like some sort of behind the scenes specific drama or something.

54
00:03:53,260 --> 00:04:03,220
That was bad while perhaps in the effort to not create PR hubbub, which ended up happening and ultimately killing off the show.

55
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:07,220
Were they trying to keep all of the offensiveness hidden?

56
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:10,240
Secret. Yeah, yeah. All the sick jokes that they made.

57
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:18,800
What they should do is, and this is getting way ahead of ourselves, but if they do bring a bag, they should just do what many popular standups are doing now and having you check your cell phone in a bag.

58
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:23,340
There's a company that has a special plan and we can do the Bill and Ted show.

59
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:27,400
It's just that there will be no footage of it and you will not be allowed to speak about it.

60
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,200
Yeah, I think that makes sense. Yeah.

61
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,820
The Bill and Ted show is like a standup that got kicked out of the industry.

62
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,580
It happened. It was the original Me Too.

63
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:41,860
This show was a Me Too four years before the movement began in earnest.

64
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,720
They just talked to Dave Chappelle. He'll give them the name of that bag company.

65
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,180
It'll be fine.

66
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:50,820
The next few years of Marin are going to evolve.

67
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:59,660
He's going to stop complaining about when they do the check drop and start complaining about when they do the cell phone drop, when they return your cell phone bags to you.

68
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,740
Oh, is the way this is a big Marin's sticking point.

69
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:11,380
Oh, about comedians complaining about comedy clubs like, I'm still doing the act and they're passing out the checks for the check drop.

70
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:15,540
Is this the kind of thing that he says in the first 10 minutes of WTF?

71
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,660
Because if so, I wouldn't know.

72
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:23,120
It comes up on like standup episodes complaining about the check drop.

73
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,460
I don't I would know what the check drop is if you had said it.

74
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,700
I don't know. Oh, OK.

75
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:41,000
Well, it's similar to how do you remember when we went to the Pirates Dinner Adventure, how we're trying to enjoy the Pirate show and yet bills are landing and they're asking us if we which type of the cake that we brought.

76
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,260
We want to serve to us. Right.

77
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,060
And it's confusing.

78
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,500
And we ended up with two desserts.

79
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:50,020
And one of them stayed in my car and Jason still wanted it.

80
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,120
Jason wept. Jason wept.

81
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,340
But I threw it away because it had been in the car.

82
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,000
Let's not reopen Old Wounds.

83
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:57,380
What a nice show.

84
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,660
Think of those poor Pirate Dinner actors, though.

85
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:00,720
They're trying to focus.

86
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,860
The cake drop is what they.

87
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:13,760
On the Pirates exclusive podcast where they talk to past Pirate guests and new Pirate recruits from this season.

88
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,820
Boy, let's get into the cake drop.

89
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,660
Hey, but let's well here.

90
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,900
Let's let's talk about this show.

91
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,400
I'm not even sure where to begin.

92
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:25,620
I mean, like basic facts for any listener who doesn't know.

93
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:28,740
Universal Studios does the event Halloween Horror Nights.

94
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:43,880
And they were doing it in Florida long before they were doing it in Hollywood in a fixture from early on for I believe 1992 on was this live Bill and Ted show, which I think was less this way in the beginning.

95
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:57,780
But it evolved to become this grand celebration or or, you know, I guess, you know, an anti celebration of pop culture throughout the year.

96
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:02,700
And, you know, it, you know, it went there.

97
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:07,160
It was a little edgier than your typical theme park material.

98
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,140
But I guess.

99
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:20,960
OK, so was that was the show on your your guys radar pre 2013 or was it the article that got it is part of your fixation.

100
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:26,400
I saw the 2008 Bill and Ted's excellent Halloween adventure with friends when I was in college.

101
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:30,320
We went to Halloween Horror Nights and I didn't give it a second thought afterwards.

102
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,940
I was just like, well, this this that was interesting.

103
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:37,780
Yeah, that's the tapestry of theme park stuff like Cassie.

104
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,020
You don't think about it.

105
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,900
Yes. Then five years later, it got canceled here in Hollywood.

106
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:44,920
And I was sad that I didn't get to see it more than once.

107
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:53,220
Maybe perhaps not realizing the degree to which it changed every year and that you couldn't just see just one that wouldn't give you the full spectrum.

108
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:57,360
Like this is a 20 2008 is not similar at all.

109
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:00,500
The 2011 is not similar at all to 1994.

110
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,920
Yeah, yeah, I think we were watching some early ones on YouTube.

111
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:13,620
A lot of videos of this Bill and Ted's excellent Halloween adventure are on YouTube in their entirety, despite it saying no, no recording is allowed in a pre bag era.

112
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,340
This was possible.

113
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:19,620
But it seems like at first it's like just general movie characters are coming in.

114
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:26,280
Yeah, it's just like the Blues Brothers are coming out and the Terminator came up frequently.

115
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,520
Universal characters that were already associated with the park.

116
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,200
Yeah, yeah, it started more.

117
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,460
Yeah, it's just yeah.

118
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:40,220
But and yeah, and it seemed like there were a lot of in the early days like the DeLorean opens, but then it's not Doc Brown.

119
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:43,740
He was obsessed in general with fake outs.

120
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:51,540
Somebody arriving you think it'll be and then it is so who's Mulder and Scully like six months, six years into the X-Files.

121
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,620
They did it with with Scooby Doo.

122
00:08:54,740 --> 00:09:00,880
They have the mystery machine come out and they're like green smoke comes out.

123
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,320
Yeah.

124
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,680
We ate too many Scooby snacks.

125
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,840
Green smoke?

126
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,240
Yeah, weed does.

127
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,340
Weed is green.

128
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:08,960
The weed color.

129
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:12,540
I'm not doing the right stuff apparently.

130
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:23,800
But you know not to jump around too much in time in the history of this, but like kind of like you said you saw it in 2008 didn't really register with you as anything good or bad.

131
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:30,480
And then an article in Vice came out that sort of blew this whole thing wide open.

132
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:33,000
I don't have the headline in front of me.

133
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:48,140
It was by a writer, Jamie Tate, but it essentially alludes to that this show is extremely homophobic and racist and misogynist and all that.

134
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:56,380
This article got a lot of attention, probably less people being upset about it and more like really that's what they do there.

135
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:00,740
And Universal had to issue a statement if you weren't happy with the statement.

136
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:08,620
And then they for that season with a couple weeks to go canceled the show entirely and never to return in Hollywood.

137
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:10,000
It kept going in Orlando.

138
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:15,980
It kept going in Orlando because the braying hordes of Florida were just like more please.

139
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:38,380
But yeah, so this sort of it got all this notoriety for that reason, which then you know what probably in a couple years like 2015 you guys started doing this UCB show and it sort of imagines what it would have been had they done it that year.

140
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:39,300
Yeah, it kept coming.

141
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:43,060
Yeah, we wrote it with our friends Joe Quizzola and Chris Stevens and they played Bill and Ted.

142
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,440
There's some very funny Chicago.

143
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:51,180
Yeah, yeah, we were just we were like at like a party like in spring of that year just talking about it.

144
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:55,200
And we were just kind of like, oh, it would be fun to just do that show.

145
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,680
And then like I think one of them emailed us and we were like, hey, should we actually do this?

146
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,320
And we did it.

147
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:01,780
Wow.

148
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:04,980
And this was like no small feat.

149
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:11,180
This was essentially like a play that you wrote every year just to do one time.

150
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,920
30 people in the cast, multiple characters.

151
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:16,820
Yeah, I remember.

152
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:25,240
Yeah, that's we would be up after the first year we were up after this UCB show Ask Kat and it had like the UCB founders were there and we just had like 60 people backstage.

153
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:37,100
We couldn't get to shut the fuck up and you could just hear them echoing into the theater, disrupting like a comedy show that isn't just, you know, making fun of a deceased theme park show.

154
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,500
Yeah, we did. We did it for three years.

155
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,460
Ours was called Bill and Ted's spooky Halloween spoof tackler.

156
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:47,960
Oh, you had you amended it to make it a little more you skewered the title.

157
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:51,980
That title is so, you know, it's right there.

158
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:52,980
It's right there for you.

159
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,440
We spoofed the title.

160
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,300
That's one point I want to get across about the Universal show.

161
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:00,980
I wouldn't say it's parodying or, you know, satire.

162
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,500
This is these are spoofs.

163
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:07,080
This is like, yeah, it's very much like like scary movie or meet the spark.

164
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,820
Like it's that but live.

165
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:14,680
It is so much the the Friedberg sets of school of comedy.

166
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:30,320
The where it's not where the parody is that a character shows up that he's there is the like we we spoofed Austin Powers by having him walk in.

167
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,520
I say the things people like.

168
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:39,280
I'm wondering if that's why there were legal worries because it's like, well, there isn't really any parody.

169
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,400
There's no exploration of the ideas.

170
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,520
There's no connecting it to other ideas.

171
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,200
There was no commentary.

172
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:47,220
The big thing with parody law.

173
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:57,120
I was just dealing with a boring issue where like we couldn't show the concept art of a building in Saudi Arabia that will be the build the biggest building in the world.

174
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:04,200
But we could show it if we said like it looks bad or it might collapse in the Saudi Arabian sand.

175
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,920
That was a lawyer's suggestion.

176
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:06,800
Yeah.

177
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,820
So that makes it OK.

178
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:12,740
But we couldn't just show we couldn't show the building and say this is a building being built.

179
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,060
It had to be commented on in some way.

180
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:15,540
You had to.

181
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,020
Yeah, you had to.

182
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:18,420
Yeah, there's parody laws, but there's no spoof laws.

183
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:18,940
Yeah.

184
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:22,080
These studios are just begging for a take on Austin Power.

185
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:26,420
They're just like what like, you know, you can do awesome powers, but like what do you have to say about this guy?

186
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,100
So he's funny for our culture.

187
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:29,480
Yeah.

188
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,300
What is it?

189
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:34,540
What is the definition of the word spoof as opposed to parody?

190
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,280
Like, is there actually a difference?

191
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,140
If I looked it up?

192
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:38,720
I don't know.

193
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,100
I'd be curious.

194
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:42,140
It feels like it's the combination of two different words, but I don't think it is.

195
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:49,740
It in and of itself is it's an onomatopoeia in that it is doing its own purpose with by sounding so silly.

196
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:52,120
Oh, is it the is the word goof part of the word spoof?

197
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:53,060
Hmm.

198
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,740
Yeah, I think it's a way it's there.

199
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:57,500
The word spoof is parodying the word goof.

200
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:58,200
Yeah.

201
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,780
We're already so far down the rabbit hole.

202
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:03,540
It's spooky or combined with goofing.

203
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,720
It's a spooky goof.

204
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,120
Yeah.

205
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,040
Can we just say what would be a spoof?

206
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,660
I would say all like the Wayans Brothers movies are spoofs.

207
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,560
The airplane movies are spoofs.

208
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:13,200
I would say.

209
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:15,000
Are naked guns spoofs?

210
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,100
I would get through those spoofs.

211
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:18,720
Those are spoofs, but they're not parodies.

212
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:22,300
But like, wasn't it also a parody of a disaster movie like Airplane?

213
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:23,980
Yeah, like Airport.

214
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:24,620
Right.

215
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:28,240
They're like maybe 77 through 79 or whatever.

216
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:31,160
A spoof is just like a dumber pair.

217
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:33,320
Like it is just like a dumber parody of a thing.

218
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:43,720
I have a definition noun, a humorous imitation of something, typically a film or a particular genre of film in which its characteristic features are exaggerated for comedic effect.

219
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:46,500
So it sounds like Bill and Ted isn't even a spoof.

220
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:47,820
You don't think so?

221
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:48,660
Sounds like they don't exaggerate anything.

222
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,920
They don't exaggerate so much.

223
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:50,640
Yeah, true.

224
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:54,400
And Bill and Ted themselves kind of do what they did in the movie.

225
00:14:54,500 --> 00:15:14,040
I think there are spoof moments because, for example, the real Lindsay Lohan would not do a big line of blow with a thundering echoing sucking sound and then say Lindsay likey.

226
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,440
Maybe I'm wrong though.

227
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,080
You might be wrong about that though.

228
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:21,060
Yeah, that might have come from a real story from someone who knows.

229
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,020
That is seen in the canyons.

230
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:23,820
The canyons.

231
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,820
Sorry, Lindsay Lohan and James Dean.

232
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:27,980
Who can forget the canyons?

233
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,780
Who can forget the canyons?

234
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:34,780
Yes, from Paul Schrader, from a very good director, this odd porn movie.

235
00:15:35,600 --> 00:16:00,280
Yeah, I watched about five of these from YouTube and it got to the point where watching the one from the year 2000, when the crocodile hunter shows up to save Britney Spears from being attacked by saber tooth from the X-Men, at that point it lowered my expectations so much I wrote this is at least a connection.

236
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:08,100
Like this is at least connecting some disparate ideas and then the rock shows up and beats up saber tooth.

237
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:11,520
The rock that would not obviously not the actual rock.

238
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:21,640
But just like when he shows up at a real wrestling show, the rock got a huge pop from the audience just from his music playing and the guy walking down the aisle.

239
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,320
A lot of these audiences seem confused that it's like not the real person.

240
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:26,340
Maybe it's like tourists.

241
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,200
They're at Hollywood.

242
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,440
But like the guy that comes out as the rock people go insane.

243
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:31,440
Yeah.

244
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:33,940
And kiss shows up in a few with them.

245
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:35,040
And there is one.

246
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,200
There's a very funny one.

247
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:43,800
I think it's the same year 2001 where a guy is commenting as he's videotaping and he seems to be very horny.

248
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:47,100
And he went, that's kiss.

249
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,960
Also, that may actually have been kiss.

250
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:55,260
It was like the fourth generation kiss members.

251
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,080
It could have been kissed.

252
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,080
I bet it's not.

253
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,380
I bet it's not kissed.

254
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:00,680
Probably not.

255
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,140
They show five times a night for weeks.

256
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:06,880
Gene Simmons doesn't like to do stuff like that for free or a little money.

257
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:07,840
That's true.

258
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:08,540
Yeah.

259
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:14,340
But it's possible it's some weird iteration where like it's all it's one of their cousins and then three hired guns.

260
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:16,740
Yeah.

261
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:20,940
I felt the same way with one that I the only one I watched in full was 2007.

262
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:26,980
So at the end you get an Avril Lavigne look alike performing the song Girlfriend.

263
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:33,160
And I got the same feeling from the audience that they're like she gets a cheer and like is that Avril Lavigne?

264
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:33,600
Wow.

265
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:38,900
Which that being like if you believed the reality of this like in a way.

266
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:39,780
Yeah.

267
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:45,760
Avril Lavigne showed up to only sing the chorus of her song and then left.

268
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:56,640
And also the real Gerard Butler from 300 showed up and said is and the real cheerleader from Heroes.

269
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,720
That's a really bizarre thing of mine.

270
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:07,520
Maybe I think we probably all have our own to to show and tell the fact that Heroes was prominently featured in 2007.

271
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:09,340
Inexplicable today.

272
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:15,660
And the one big runner was a guy walks out with like big furry eyebrows.

273
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,660
He looks like animals were pressed onto his face.

274
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:26,240
And then it's like mumble explained that's supposed to be one of the actors in Heroes who apparently had thick eyebrows.

275
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,920
Oh maybe the horned rim glasses guy.

276
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,860
He didn't have glasses though.

277
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:31,640
Oh he didn't have.

278
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:32,080
Oh OK.

279
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:32,660
Who was.

280
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:35,120
Am I. Is this a wild leap that I'm wrong about.

281
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,100
Is Zachary Quinto in Heroes.

282
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,100
Yeah that was like his break.

283
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,300
Yeah that was his big break.

284
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,640
I think that's who it is.

285
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:42,860
I think they're saying he has big thick eyebrows.

286
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,000
Spoofing his eyebrows.

287
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:48,320
I was like the first thing I thought of was Peter Gallagher but I don't think he was on Heroes.

288
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:48,800
I don't think he was.

289
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,580
He was on the OC.

290
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:52,560
He was on the OC but he has very prominent eyebrows.

291
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:52,820
He does.

292
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:53,200
Yeah.

293
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,640
I don't think Quinto is unless they're thinking he's he wasn't Spock yet right.

294
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:58,260
No.

295
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,820
But who has prominent eyebrows.

296
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:04,500
He had a very specific look in that show.

297
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:05,920
Let me see how his eyebrows looked.

298
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:09,420
They could have just been making fun of the general idea of eyebrows.

299
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:13,980
There was a general idea of 20 of 2007.

300
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:16,860
Yeah what were the 2007 eyebrow trends.

301
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:19,640
Because right now thick brows are very on trend.

302
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:22,200
My mom though told me that I need to tweeze mine.

303
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,120
This is true.

304
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,340
She said I have two.

305
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:24,880
That's two.

306
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,040
They're too bushy.

307
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,360
I don't think I agree.

308
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:28,880
They seem fine.

309
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:29,800
They seem normal from here.

310
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:30,440
Yeah.

311
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:31,240
Everyone says normal.

312
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:32,420
Why am I in everyone's eyebrows.

313
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,040
I don't see anything weird going on.

314
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,880
I guess he has a lot of great sense of eyebrows.

315
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,680
I guess Quinto has a lot of eyebrow.

316
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:40,340
Yeah that's pretty prominent.

317
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:42,380
But that's a I mean that's a reach.

318
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:43,120
That's like a.

319
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:43,740
Got a laugh.

320
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,840
Everyone in the audience agreed.

321
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:46,440
Oh yeah.

322
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,700
That here you all know his big eyebrows.

323
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:50,760
Is there a running joke on heroes about his eyebrows.

324
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:52,820
No but it is weird.

325
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:59,560
It is weird like just the thing going back and watching these Bill and Ted shows online the things that you're like was this even popular at the time.

326
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:00,120
Right.

327
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:00,960
Heroes I think was.

328
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,320
We were heroes was it got fucked up by the writers.

329
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,360
Like that was a show that got messed up by the writers.

330
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:13,420
Also if anyone remembers a couple of years ago heroes came back for like 10 episodes.

331
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,020
Oh yeah.

332
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,080
Remember this.

333
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:15,860
Yeah.

334
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:20,060
Henry Zabrowski from Your Pretty Face is Going to Hell.

335
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:20,900
Oh wow.

336
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:21,700
Yeah.

337
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:22,780
Interesting.

338
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:30,060
Well Ben Bill and Ted today could have spoofed the return of heroes but vice I guess doesn't want that.

339
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,140
That's too extreme for Vice magazine.

340
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:32,620
Yeah.

341
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:37,040
But these shows were all all excuse me only taking place at the horror nights.

342
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:37,460
Yeah.

343
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:37,720
Right.

344
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:44,180
At night when maybe people were looser they were a little drunker very drunk maybe.

345
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:47,400
I don't know the history of alcohol at Universal Hollywood.

346
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:56,920
Some well someone told us there is limited alcohol at Hollywood now and that the Orlando one is is much more tame with alcohol now.

347
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,620
Oh but it used to be like a free for all.

348
00:20:58,620 --> 00:20:58,860
Yeah.

349
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:15,560
When my friend my friend and her family went when we were in high school and she said her she was like 16 and her parents were just buying margaritas for them and one for her and no one cared or paid attention.

350
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:22,740
As opposed to you in Orlando got super carted to where you couldn't get.

351
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:32,900
The woman at the Margaritaville Margaritaville stand though was willing to look at the picture of my passport on my phone and give me a margarita.

352
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:33,760
She played ball.

353
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:42,180
She played ball but the people at Disney were making my friend buy me drinks because when I went to Orlando in March my driver's license was expired.

354
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:49,560
So there were many places who would not serve me alcohol despite the fact that I'm a gray haired 34 year old man.

355
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:51,880
With facial hair.

356
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:52,760
With facial hair.

357
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,480
Prominent brows.

358
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,060
They can't be too careful.

359
00:21:56,660 --> 00:22:01,020
Those brows you know some worked on them you might not be able to booze anymore.

360
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,320
I'm too young.

361
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,900
That's what my mom wants though.

362
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:08,260
With your hat now with your Beastie Boy hat.

363
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:12,860
I would love to come over one day and you had incredibly thin eyebrows.

364
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:18,800
You're like I tried something new and I guess I just have to wait it out.

365
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,120
I finally listened to mom.

366
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,460
I finally listened to mom.

367
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:22,480
This is for you mom.

368
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,700
This is for you mother.

369
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:26,480
Mommy mommy.

370
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:37,700
Here's okay my overall because I assume that what this will turn into is saying all of the things that we found that happened in the show.

371
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:41,000
Which is a remarkable thing to do.

372
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:47,680
Like I just like copy and pasting sections from BillandTed.org and thanks for passing that our way Brad.

373
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:53,680
Just reading these synopses without affect is insane.

374
00:22:54,480 --> 00:23:01,240
But I truly like I was starting to go through it year by year and then I broke.

375
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:07,020
I actually I was doing it today and I'll save the moment when I broke.

376
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,560
That's just a tease for later.

377
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:16,080
But there was something I you know like I guess I admittedly woke up this morning not feeling great a little like sleep hazy.

378
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,660
And teetering on do I go back to bed.

379
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:23,400
And then there was one thing I read that was like I'm getting back in the bed and I took a nap.

380
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:26,520
I like this these synopses wore me out.

381
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:34,840
And in general Jason and I talked about this too that sometimes the research for these episodes is a pleasure.

382
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:42,040
Something like star tours which we love so much like you know my wife and I at home were like oh you know I need to watch more star tour stuff.

383
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,080
You want to watch while we eat dinner.

384
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:43,880
Oh yeah totally.

385
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:51,880
And we watch specials and it's fun and I'll remember this this thing it came up I was like do you want to I need to watch Bill and Ted stuff.

386
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:54,560
And she was like you know what no.

387
00:23:54,780 --> 00:24:00,800
And I was like yeah I know no I'm sorry I asked I don't I can't make you live with that in your own home.

388
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:05,220
These things are so they're so headache inducing all of these shows.

389
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,520
Aaron did you take off your wedding ring.

390
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:08,060
After I.

391
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:16,140
Yeah so this episode is passed I don't want to associate with you.

392
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,560
Me and Nick loved researching this one.

393
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:20,440
Psychopaths.

394
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,540
High tolerance.

395
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:23,260
Insane.

396
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:29,560
You are very good at curating this sort of trash like this.

397
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:34,920
I don't know how to describe the the the elements of our culture.

398
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:55,200
You guys wrote a web series directed by our very own Scott Garner called Death Valley Tween Fest which is a very funny critique of like the current you know YouTuber culture social media culture and is now you can now watch it is now available to watch it available on YouTube and Facebook.

399
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,880
Watch it's now a Facebook watch.

400
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:57,180
Yeah.

401
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:59,880
It's at Facebook dot com slash tween fest.

402
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:08,760
Doesn't matter where you see it as long as like the shows the shows so much funnier than all of the the lame platforms it's on.

403
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:13,820
If people send you guys like a blank DVD will you burn it and then send it back to them.

404
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:14,880
Yeah.

405
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,460
Definitely.

406
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:20,780
Do you like eBay sales of Tween Fest before that show.

407
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:21,120
Yeah.

408
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:40,060
You guys made me aware of a lot of the horrors of because it's a show kind of like I kept describing it as like all of the worst components of 2016 influencer culture all like get into a giant collision in the insufferable heat of the desert.

409
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:47,820
And it's like there's so much like so much horror you guys were aware of and like too much even to fit into the show.

410
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:48,220
Yeah.

411
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:48,920
The one thing.

412
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:58,300
Oh because a big Drew Tarver the listeners might know from other podcasts and such very very funny as a character who is a way.

413
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:01,560
What's the term the social social experiment.

414
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:02,240
Yeah.

415
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,680
He's based off Fousey tube and Josie Joey salad.

416
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,980
Like see what it like these words.

417
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:10,640
I recognize these words.

418
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,320
They're very.

419
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:14,700
Although but you're your whole thing on our podcast.

420
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:16,940
You're the one who's up on the current youth trend.

421
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,940
The most of the three of us.

422
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:19,320
Yeah.

423
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:22,880
And to me this even I have my limits.

424
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:25,420
But then when I saw you sell stuff.

425
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:26,240
You're right.

426
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,220
Millions of views.

427
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:34,320
My one of my favorite things on on Death Valley Tween Fest is the dabble dudes.

428
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:42,500
Which are a parody of the bus former BuzzFeed try to try to try guys.

429
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:42,940
Yeah.

430
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:48,960
And now any time I see the try guys in like the trades or stuff I just go like do they mean the dabble.

431
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,460
Do you know the dabble.

432
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:53,360
Do you miss printed up in your brain.

433
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:54,860
They dabble in different things.

434
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:55,600
Yeah.

435
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,700
Yeah.

436
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:56,980
Yeah.

437
00:26:56,980 --> 00:27:00,980
They start dabbling and wearing high heels and stuff you know doing girl stuff.

438
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:07,920
And then and then it becomes getting lizard brains and what else happens.

439
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:09,140
Yeah.

440
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,820
Replacing their blood with the hot sauce.

441
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:12,540
Their sweat glands.

442
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:14,080
Hot sauce.

443
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,200
Cannibalism.

444
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:17,180
Yeah.

445
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:30,960
Check out Tween Fest by the way in general I was going to say at the end but also of notes for any theme park fans out there because I was very excited to get to work with John Michael Higgins who stars in the show who has done many one of the

446
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:37,380
wonderful things all the Christopher guest films but to me will always be the guy who explains what's going to happen to you in test track.

447
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:39,520
Ask him about test track.

448
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:46,400
I feel like it's not my story to tell but I got to hear all the great behind the scenes test track scoops.

449
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,000
It was a blast.

450
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:48,600
Yeah.

451
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:49,260
Yeah.

452
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:50,700
We love garbage.

453
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:51,560
I don't know.

454
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,680
I just like to feel feelings you know I like good stuff and bad stuff.

455
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:57,320
The okay stuff is the stuff I have.

456
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:00,460
You do have very good taste both of you.

457
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:01,260
Oh thank you.

458
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:07,100
But then conversely you're also great at finding just these wonderful disasters.

459
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:26,260
I think what's also like fascinating about the Bill and Ted show is that like the monotony of of every single year where it is like the exact same thing over and over again and like the same characters come back and like the it's the same sort of like beats as they follow that there is just some sort of just kind of like I don't know.

460
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:28,760
There's like a dread and just like having to watch the same thing.

461
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:31,280
Oh yeah.

462
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:44,380
Well what are the what are the what are the components that do recur every year because your guys fictionalized show also have the same things but there's like the like the obvious all the references change but there's like the plot tent poles that are always the same.

463
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:49,360
Yeah I mean some of the things they do every year in the show we couldn't do because it would make our show too unwatchable.

464
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:55,660
They basically they open every year with like a warning being like this show is naughty and get out of here if you're offended.

465
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:56,620
Yeah yeah.

466
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:58,840
No photography and they're sexy dancers.

467
00:28:59,060 --> 00:28:59,280
Yeah.

468
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:01,260
You don't like getting horny leave.

469
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:03,000
Yeah.

470
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,400
If you don't like racism.

471
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:07,280
Yeah they put it all out there.

472
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:07,760
Yeah.

473
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,400
The original trigger warning.

474
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,160
Yeah yeah.

475
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,080
By the Bill and Ted show.

476
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,080
Two thousand or something.

477
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:17,240
But yeah they start with the dance number they always end with a big dance number.

478
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:24,440
The dance and the dance number it's it's not comedy usually it's usually just a bunch of sexy buff men and women.

479
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:30,160
Yeah it's like whatever like the sexiest men and women pop culture figures of that year come out and then they're they're dancing.

480
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,180
They dance for a while.

481
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:37,300
It's just a weird show because they bring in they get you horny and they make you laugh then they get you horny again.

482
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:37,820
Yeah.

483
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:44,380
It's book ended by these incredible by the end of the run of this these dance numbers were incredibly long.

484
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:44,820
Yeah.

485
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:45,580
Yes totally.

486
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:55,860
Many many songs and that have bizarre like in the in the 2007 one you just get a performance of Fight for Your Right to Party.

487
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:56,220
Yes.

488
00:29:56,220 --> 00:30:08,680
You just get the full Beastie Boys song but it's three guys who come out in the intergalactic wardrobe not the 80s Beastie Boys which I guess so that's I guess that's the spoof component.

489
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,120
What if we put them in different clothes that they also wore.

490
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:17,060
Some of the costumes are good and some of them are very bad.

491
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:19,560
What's your favorite costume.

492
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,420
I don't know it's all just a morass right.

493
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,740
Oh I like the Mr. Byrds.

494
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:25,340
Oh okay.

495
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:26,980
Mr. Byrds.

496
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:27,700
Next level.

497
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:35,220
Well okay here let's let's say this then there is always one of the components every year is that there is a concerted villain.

498
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:42,540
Perhaps multiple villains but it seems like typically a primary you know alpha villain.

499
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:43,080
Yeah.

500
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:53,680
And yes and this could be this could be a very scary character or it could be a funny villain like the Simpsons Mr. Byrds.

501
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:56,960
What let's hear we can we can go all the all out of order.

502
00:30:57,020 --> 00:31:00,440
What what what what happens in this Mr. Byrds year.

503
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:05,700
That's the 2001 Orlando that Mr. Byrds is the villain.

504
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:11,340
It's the villain will always come out will come out and say this big evil plan they have involving Bill and Ted.

505
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:20,440
They're going to take over the world using the theme park show and using their using their time traveling phone booth against them.

506
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:24,480
Yes they don't really it doesn't seem to be that they time travel.

507
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:30,840
No they don't use the weird thing about the Bill and Ted Halloween show is nothing Halloween based happens at all.

508
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:35,540
And there's not too much Bill and Ted stuff aside from they host it and they have a phone booth.

509
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:41,240
Yeah and they say and they say sixty nine and they say sixty nine so much that always comes back.

510
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:48,500
Bill and Ted introducing themselves like in the movies happens at the beginning of every show and the audience cheers.

511
00:31:48,500 --> 00:32:04,300
Yeah just said that and I feel like your guys's show at UCB was was good at pointing out that like does anyone remember these movies that what like I feel like the sequel the second one came out in 91 which was when this show started right.

512
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:12,740
Close to one and I feel like by 93 94 we had all kind of like checked out on Bill and Ted.

513
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:13,640
Yeah right.

514
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:25,600
Wayne and Garth despite having come technically later than Bill and Ted he had a much bigger pop cultural footprint is a much more quality holds up film does not have.

515
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:26,240
Yeah.

516
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:30,260
Doesn't have all the F words in it and I don't mean if you see K.

517
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:31,260
I mean the other.

518
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:32,100
Yeah.

519
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:40,140
Yeah much more endearing characters Wayne and Garth Bill and Ted who love to say gay slurs.

520
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:48,900
Yeah I would also just say though that it would be very weird if Wayne and Garth were hosting the Universal Horror Nights show in 2017.

521
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:56,240
We are to you you think because it's a more like guarded property we're we're we're I feel like yeah I think you're right.

522
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:06,680
Yeah I think NBC Universal owns it every now and then there's stuff that shows up in this where it's like the ambiguously gay duo shows up and I'm like well that they don't have to because they own it.

523
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:18,620
But then they're just again they're just anytime a comedy person shows up like they're just doing the lines that worked in the mood like when Shrek shows up he like farts like that's it.

524
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:24,300
Yeah no yeah they just it's like it's like cover it's cover band stuff it's like.

525
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:31,820
Yeah that's a good thing the scream the killer from scream goes what's up which I'm pretty sure is right from scary.

526
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:35,900
Yeah it is like it's scary movie killer guy.

527
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,480
They took a thing from a spoof and did that.

528
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,180
Yeah.

529
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:41,780
It was already a parody.

530
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:45,420
This stuff drives me insane.

531
00:33:45,760 --> 00:34:05,640
It honestly is kind of my like origin story of being a comedy writer because I remember very specifically that I like there was some like class skits project in ninth grade and I had worked hard on an original skit that did not you know that was about whatever we were doing in social studies.

532
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:19,280
And it did not go over terribly well but I was satisfied because it was original and then the most popular kid in school went up and said yeah baby and everyone in the classroom cheered.

533
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:31,920
And I like I still remember it I remember the point of view I had in the classroom when it happened how angry it made me I still things like this make me as angry today.

534
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:42,580
Like the idea that you don't have this rule anyone who doesn't have this rule in their brain you cannot do a comedy thing and get the laugh that someone else thought of.

535
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:56,200
It's not allowed but it's becoming allowed more and more we're breaking norms as we are in Washington in the comedy world norms are being broken as well and we need to stick with the norms.

536
00:34:56,440 --> 00:35:09,380
Yeah I try coaching improv or sketch students I am anytime they're like there is an improv scene about improv or like a sketch about I'm like hey okay maybe maybe don't do this.

537
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:17,300
Yeah, because it's it's just it just becomes a circle it just becomes the snake eating its own tail.

538
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:36,220
And it's not fulfilling. Yeah I mean I really feel like like the 2016 election broke everyone's like brains and now the like mainstream comedy kind of is doing this Bill and Ted cover band comedy type of things like Samantha B was singing Zendaya is Meachie last week like SNL did Meet the Parents.

539
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,120
Yeah, yeah.

540
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:55,480
Yeah, yeah. You're getting the laugh off of Robert De Niro saying you fucker like that you are taking your laugh from something a different comedy from 20 years ago, not allowed not the norms.

541
00:35:55,480 --> 00:36:18,920
Yeah, really yeah Melissa McCarthy doing the Matt Foley character as an old board it's just like, this is what the billet edge show is, but with famous people and that's what mainstream comedy. Yeah, and sometimes now, Scott I very much relate to that like that like the stress and anger of like trying to make an original it's like this is draft eight of something it's like already.

542
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:32,220
The guy's got to fall down this way in this line the rhythm needs to be like that that that that and then yeah someone goes out and goes like yeah do I make you horny baby that people cheer in the streets.

543
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:47,300
I mean honestly I find this in a weird way I find when people get a laugh out of saying grab them by the pussy or dance around the phrase grab them by the pussy in a way aren't they like using Trump's writing.

544
00:36:47,580 --> 00:37:16,880
Are you like in a weird way getting a laugh off of something he said to be funny that obviously is very offensive and awful but isn't that like if you're all the joke you're doing is just saying grab them by the pussy it's just recognizing the reference yeah.

545
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:41,560
I guess was an accident on his part maybe we'll never know with his follow up tweet yeah I know all this we yeah we have the same gene of this making our heads explode and your guys a show when you would do it at UCB there was a level of there was more commentary there was more like self awareness and irony to it which I

546
00:37:41,560 --> 00:38:01,640
was saying to you guys last night like these bill intents if they had just been a little a little more irony a little more self-awareness it would have just been a UCB variety like show yeah it would have just and Brad you would said like these are at least consistent like these are consistent yeah and they're very short they're very fast paced.

547
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:07,460
Yeah it was a more satisfying show than a lot of live comedy shows I've seen in Los Angeles.

548
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:24,860
Yeah one of my favorite things in I think it was in the 2016 one or maybe it was 2017 but I forget whether it was Bill and Ted just turns to the audience after some disaster thing of the year and just went our culture is good and must be preserved.

549
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:41,560
Like I think about that all the time all the time especially like yeah with the broken brain comedy which is like comedians like referring to it's like I don't call him Donald Trump I call him 45 and I'm like oh shoot me.

550
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:45,580
Or other here without name checking anything there are there.

551
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:55,720
Okay, John Oliver does the drum that he calls Trump drum yes there's other comedy that uses drum as a joke.

552
00:38:55,720 --> 00:39:03,980
But he you didn't think of that drum is not up for grabs you don't get to build on the joke of drums.

553
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:08,080
This is what this is the highest horse.

554
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:21,740
Yeah, I feel I'm so happy to vent about all of these things. Yeah. And look by getting into this area of spoofs and goofs, we get to where we're getting there these grievances so Bill and Ted's doing us a real service.

555
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:23,320
Yeah, thank you.

556
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:23,800
Thank you.

557
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:24,200
Thanks Bill and Ted.

558
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:42,300

559
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:52,020
My favorite HelloFresh meal is the balsamic fig chicken. It's very very awesome, and I made it which is pretty amazing in the place that I live my home.

567
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:19,200
Alright guys, I want to talk to you about a new product called Eero Plus. Eero Plus is like a new Wi-Fi system that's designed to provide simple reliable security that defends all your home's devices against a growing number of threats such as malware, spyware, phishing attacks, as well as unsuitable content.

568
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:27,240
The combination of Eero with Eero Plus provides complete protection for your network and all the devices and those who use them as they connect to the internet.

569
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:35,720
Okay, so what's included in Eero? Total network protection. Eero Plus offers the ability to block malicious and unwanted content across your entire network.

570
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:45,780
Advanced security. You know, by checking the sites you visit against a database of millions of known threats, Eero Plus prevents you from accidentally visiting malicious sites without slowing anything down.

571
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:55,060
Content blocking. Eero Plus automatically tags sites that contain violent, illegal, or adult content so you can choose what your kids can and cannot visit right in the Eero app.

572
00:41:55,240 --> 00:42:15,560
Ad blocking. Get rid of annoying ads and pop-ups on all your devices. Ad blocking also improves load times for ad-heavy sites so you can browse and stream faster than ever before, including third-party security apps, VPN production from encrypt.me, password management from 1Password, antivirus software from MalwareBytes.

573
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:29,380
Here's the thing. The single-router model just doesn't work for an increasingly high-bandwidth world. It's simple physics. Like light waves, Wi-Fi waves don't go through walls well. Imagine asking a light bulb in your living room to light your master bedroom. It would be crazy.

574
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:40,180
What you need is a distributed system. This is what offices have had for years. A considerable work and expense. With Eero, you can install an enterprise-grade Wi-Fi system in your home in just a few minutes.

575
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:48,080
Simply download the Eero app on your iOS or Android devices and it'll walk you through each step of the process. It's quick, easy, and painless.

576
00:42:48,400 --> 00:43:03,360
Current Wi-Fi routers are really tough to manage and optimize. The Eero app lets you manage your network from the palm of your hand so you know how many devices are connected at any given point, as well as the internet speed that you're getting from your service provider. You can also easily create and share a guest network.

577
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:24,260
Eero is protected with state-of-the-art WPA2 encryption, and because it controls the hardware and the software for your entire network, it ensures that you're always secure. Since traditional routers don't push software updates to their customers, they are left vulnerable to cyber attacks. Eero updates automatically so that you not only have the latest features, but the latest security at all times.

578
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:42,360
Eero has incredible customer support. It's something that the company is really invested in. You can call and get ahold of a Wi-Fi expert within 30 seconds. If you have any worries about your other connected devices during setup, one of Eero's experts can walk you through everything. Their experts can also help you if you're not sure how many Eeros are right for your home. Just call.

579
00:43:42,620 --> 00:44:04,280
So what I like about Eero is that it was very, very easy to setup, and now I finally get good coverage all over the apartment. It used to be there was like a dead spot in the bathroom. No longer I can get good Wi-Fi everywhere. And let me reiterate, this is very easy to setup. I was concerned I was not going to be able to do this. I did it in like less than 15 minutes. So incredibly simple. Michael can do it.

580
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:16,940
Okay, never think about Wi-Fi again. Get $100 off the Eero base unit and two beacons package and one year of Eero. Plus, visit Eero.com slash theme park and a checkout ad theme park. You're going to be very happy.

581
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:35,660
Okay, where do we? Okay, we I mean we could start anywhere. We could throw a dart. But as I said a while ago, as a case study, what is the what happened with Mr. Burns? Oh, yes. This is the 2000 Orlando show. Okay. Oh, I have my own synopsis. I can follow along.

582
00:44:35,660 --> 00:45:05,640
Okay, I still still like not totally crazy, but like by not 2017 2016 ones of just like super like there at least is an attempt at a through line and all the ones pre 9 11 seems so wholesome. Yeah, it's very nice going back and watching. Yeah. It's

583
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:35,480
So did the bill and Ted show in a way. I mean, yeah, I mean, yeah, so it's Mr. Burns and this guy just has this freakish rubber mask. Mr. Burns, but it only covers half his face and then his I don't mean to like insult the theme park after the played Mr. Burns in the 2000 Bill and Ted show. But like he doesn't do a great Mr. Burns voice. That's a hard voice to do. Was it Ted Cruz? Sorry, Ted Cruz played all a lot of Simpsons characters in a BuzzFeed video.

584
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:50,760
I sometimes I refer to this as if people know it, but often people don't look up Ted Cruz does Simpsons voices. Amazing piece of work. Yeah, I mean, I have a note just of all the I just wrote down all the people that are standing on stage with Bill and Ted by the end of the 2000 show. Oh, please.

585
00:45:50,760 --> 00:46:14,220
It's a real it's a real just clusterfuck. This bill and Ted, which like why are they on stage in 2000? But they're they're with Big Mama shaft, the Charlie's Angels, Mr. Burns Smithers, Karen and Jack from Will and Grace, Ethan Hunt, Storm and Mystique from X-Men and the crocodile hunter who never stops talking about how he likes to smear poop on himself. Yeah. Huh?

586
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:44,200
What's that about? I don't know. Is that like something like maybe there was an episode where he had to put like a I think that wasn't a feces on himself. Yeah. There is also a point at the end of the show where Elion Gonzalez. Yeah, I have Elion written down in all caps. He transforms into Enrique Iglesias and start and takes off his shirt and like dances. Janet there's a runner in the show. Janet Reno is chasing Elion Gonzalez across the stage repeatedly with like a big dog catcher net. Yeah.

587
00:46:44,220 --> 00:47:07,340
I'm just trying to get him and this just happens throughout just the I want to say a lot of these synopses thankfully are provided and kept up by Bill and Ted dot org. It's a great resource. Yes. Nonprofit website and work it is under the Halloween section. Yeah, there is a lot of donate to Bill and Ted dot org.

588
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:30,740
Is there a Patreon for Bill and Ted dot org? But the way these synopses are written there's something about where they don't put a lot of like English on it and I think it's wonderful. Like the way like what you just described it was described by their synopses writer and as such Van Halen's running with the devil plays and Janet Reno comes out of the phone booth with a net in her hands.

589
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:52,480
Alien Gonzalez runs out to get away from her and they chase about. Then after that characters who were apparently not on stage by the end Britney Spears and Lil Kim have a dance off that ends when Britney snatches Lil Kim's wig off. Then Britney is attacked by the villain wrestler, wrestler Kevin Nash from the WWF. The rock comes out to her rescue.

590
00:47:52,680 --> 00:48:08,160
What we will we hear was this again? Why is Kevin Nash? I think it was saber tooth, but he looks like Kevin Nash. So someone misidentified Kevin Nash's saber tooth is Kevin Nash. Wait, did Kevin Nash play saber tooth in the movie? No, that was Tyler Maine. Oh, excuse me.

591
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:19,440
Rest in peace, Tyler Maine. Running Bill and Ted dot org is probably a very hard job. Let's just give the benefit of the doubt. The person describing these. Kevin Nash is in Magic Mike and he played super shredder.

592
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:45,440
Really? Oh, well, then that's a indelible performance. I do love super shredder. By the way, if you're curious about what Mr. Burns' plan is, Mr. Burns has invented a pocket rocket that he has used to steal and store today's pop superstars. So like on a drive and there seems to be a part later where he like downloads characters and onto the stage.

593
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:56,280
So they're using Kid Napster dot kidnapster dot com. He's going to sell the pop stars themselves. That's pretty good. Kid Napster.

594
00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:16,260
Very pro Lars Erlich. No, yeah, as far as the Bill and Ted show goes, Kid Napster is closer to a joke than this celebrity comes out and does their thing. Are we discovering that the show got worse as time went on? It got hornier. Yeah, I think it got worse.

595
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:38,220
I guess I feel like the earlier versions of it were like they were strictly kind of like the universal properties of just like we have the Blues Brothers come out and then Terminator comes out. And then like at some point they were like, hey, let's get a little risky and throw in some of these other characters. So maybe it was just kind of like a cumulation of just too many characters and too much shit.

596
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:51,860
I think the Internet made our culture bad and have too many things. It used to be in 2000 summing up all the things with Bill and Ted, you could just do an hour. Oh, yeah, we all know the popular things. But then it's like we saw one with the hide your kid hide your wife guy.

597
00:49:52,460 --> 00:50:10,960
Oh, yeah, once you knew was the auto news guy. Yeah, once like and it got like a huge response in the show. But once the once memes come into it, once they start using just like people from commercials, just do it like once they start doing like William Shatner is the price line negotiator who becomes like a main character.

598
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:34,880
He is like he comes in like halfway through like like the 2000 and something one and you know, that was considered like a primary piece of pop culture at the time. Yeah, like for like that does. That's crazy that that is in there. But it is better than like stuff like in the 2005 one where they have the Dukes of Hazard and from the movie.

599
00:50:35,320 --> 00:51:04,860
And there's no way anyone cared about that movie. People probably did care about the price line man more than the Dukes of Hazard. So I think they write the show in advance is why sometimes. Yeah, they're they're predicting sort of like, oh, this will be a big deal. Yeah, we saw one where it's like it opens on the family from the vacation reboot. And they're like, hi, we're here looking and it's like the audience truly does not follow. Yeah, I didn't see that. How would you like represent them like the kids are just like too good to be.

600
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:27,700
Guys, but they had a son and a daughter in the vacation reboot. It's a it's two boys. But in the live show is a son and a daughter. They didn't even see it. Huh? And possibly written in advance to where and they'd already cast the daughter. Yeah. Yeah. What a funny thing also with vacation is like, you know how we're going to reinvent the wheel. Take one of the primary female characters away. Yeah. Yeah.

601
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:38,260
The problem we kind of we have a list of insane characters we saw a crosswalking 10 of these shows. Let's hear it. Strip. Arella Stanley Strip Arella.

602
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:54,040
It's like a spike. Wow. From Spike TV short lived adult entertainment block. Yeah. With Ren and Stimpy's party cart. I got off a Ren and Stimpy when they did that again. Yeah. You were in and still John K was back.

603
00:51:55,040 --> 00:52:12,260
There was a G girl for my super ex girlfriend. Uma Thurman's character G girl. Oh my super ex. Wow. Yeah. Luke Wilson. Yes. I've been corrected. Yeah. God. Jet Li's character was seeing who from Lethal Weapon 4.

604
00:52:15,220 --> 00:52:34,060
One of the best ones is Russell Brands Arthur. He opens the show. In 2011 it opens on Melissa McCarthy from bridesmaids hosting it with Russell Brands Arthur. No. Yeah. And talking to the audience as being like, oh yeah. We're all here.

605
00:52:34,380 --> 00:53:04,020
How you all know who I am. We're here to have some fun. Yeah. The Sucker Punch girls. Wow. Yeah. They maybe do a sexy dance. They are the sexy dance girls here. The Prince of Persia. Yeah. Prince of Persia.

606
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:25,240
I think Prince of Persia is like the incentive for like what like the time travel element of that year is where he's like I have my dagger which can make us go back in time. So it is just like this thing no one remembers. So if something has a time travel component it could get bumped up into primary pop culture feature. Yeah.

607
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:55,220
Even though they have the phone booth. Yeah. Yeah. We have this thing. I assume one of the years must have had a Balthazar Nicholas Cage's Sorcerer from the Sorcerer's Apprentice. Oh yeah. That type of thing. Yeah. Yeah. We I mean the mystery men were in it prominently one year and they kind of take over the show midway through. We think it might have been like a backdoor pilot type of thing. It's 1999. These kids don't know Bill and Ted so good. What if the mystery men start hosting a Halloween adventure. Yeah. Universal. Oh and if it's a Halloween adventure. Yeah.

608
00:53:55,220 --> 00:54:25,200
If it's still to this day was the mystery. I mean I loved mystery men when it came out in movies I was like on board for that. I was excited for it and I thought the movie delivered. Yeah. Yeah. We all know what song came from mystery. Yeah. All star. All star. I think people get their wires crossed and think that that came from Shrek. Right. But Shrek is I'm a believer. The cover of the monkey song. Yes. Yes. True. For me all star I really identify with rat race.

609
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:45,680
I don't know. Oh yeah. Yeah. A lot of the big. Yeah. A sleet stack from Land of the Lost is probably featured in one of the pet. John Dillinger from Public Enemies Johnny Depp's character the gangster John Dillinger who also is real. Yes he's real. This is the character.

610
00:54:46,940 --> 00:55:15,660
Huh. I mean the love guru is in one and he enters to the Austin Powers theme song and does Dr. Evil zip it thing. He said he says they're like people don't know the love guru catchphrases. Let's just have our Dr. Evil impersonate. I mean Dr. Evil is the villain of the Bill and Ted show more than any more than bin Laden more than more than the Terminator more than Mr. Burns. Yeah. Dr. Evil shows up in the final one in the 2017 one and the audience is perplexed why Dr. Evil.

611
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:36,000
Is there. I personally think Dr. Evil should have been the villain every year. He had a guy who did a really good Dr. Evil. Yeah. Orlando and the crap the crowd loved watching it. Yeah. That also if we're going to backdoor pilot if they were going to do a spoof show maybe from here on out it's Dr. Evil's layer of Halloween madness.

612
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:58,400
I also think post 2012 there should have been a Gangnam Style sequence every year every single year. Yeah totally agreed. And I'm surprised when there was not. Yeah. If I also by the way if Dr. Evil hosted it every year then when those bags are passed out to put your cell phones in he could encourage everyone to zip.

613
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:16,720
Oh that's great. That's really good. Pretty good. I hope the Universal Park people are listening to this. If the bad company is we can make them realize how much easier all the safety rules will be just by putting Dr. Evil at the very least is bad company having Dr. Evil be their spokesperson.

614
00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:46,380
Oh the 2010 show in Hollywood Ari Gold from Entourage is the villain. Whoa. Really. Yeah. He bought the Bill and Ted show and he's changing it up and he's like Bill and Ted are not relevant in 2010. So your places Bill with Justin Bieber who keeps getting mistaken for a woman and loves sugary cereal for some reason. He's a child. And then he replaced the joke. He's a little boy. Yeah. And then he replaced Ted with Snooki in this situation. Two people. Yeah. Yeah.

615
00:56:47,700 --> 00:57:11,000
This one Snooki I feel like and we'll do a full episode on the Disney California Adventure Aladdin show that I was obsessed with. Yeah. We have a clean version of a lot of this stuff. But Snooki was in that show. I mean not not a character but would be referenced almost every show I saw of the years. He would just the genie would say something and he would turn to the audience just be like Snooki.

616
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:40,980
It wasn't even a joke. He would just like say a line from Aladdin and look at you and go Snooki and it killed. Wow. Wow. Wow. Snooki played by a gentleman. No. He was a woman but he was drunk or horny or something. Yeah. Don't worry they spoofed her. They got her. They got her how drunk she was. Yeah we should say women don't fare well in these shows. No. No it's wreck it Ralph punching someone.

617
00:57:41,440 --> 00:58:00,360
Like it's there's a lot of that I feel like or dummies being tossed from the rafters of like yeah it's Britney Spears. Oh no get her out of there. And then they just toss it dummy down or something. Yeah. In general the I think like looking back probably a lot of pop culture has regrets about that.

618
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:17,960
The way Britney was treated in the so-called crazy Britney which is what they call her exclusively in the 2007 show. She's there's a silhouette that you think is going to be Dr. Evil. But then when she steps into the light it is Britney Spears with a shaved head.

619
00:58:18,460 --> 00:58:37,200
It's dark. I do feel like today people would ease off a little let a person who's under an immense amount of pressure you know go through a bad time. Why is this so insane that she would like be upset and shave her head like oh madness that she would shave her head.

620
00:58:39,860 --> 00:58:57,660
And in general that one's pretty crazy as I mentioned the Lindsay Lohan I like blow section is really odd and Paris Hilton had just been to jail and she gets it pretty hard. But then in the in the 2013 one the one pre cancellation there is this bizarre thing where wreck it Ralph.

621
00:58:57,660 --> 00:59:12,980
First of all again wreck it Ralph. Let's not glaze over that but the wreck it Ralph punches Nicki Minaj and Amanda Bynes another person suffering having a breakdown. Yeah. Yeah.

622
00:59:12,980 --> 00:59:15,840
Female mental illness is really taken to task.

623
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:26,980
This year since wreck it Ralph is coming back wreck it Ralph would punch out all the characters in the Handmaid's Tale.

624
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:31,300
Audience loves it.

625
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:53,280
There's like a real like I think there's this real like hatred for anything that's for teenagers or like any pops. There's a real like Justin Bieber is for babies like we hate Rebecca Black and Kylo Ren sucks. It's like this weird like like aggro like what like a college person a college males opinions would be or whatever.

626
00:59:53,320 --> 01:00:08,480
It's like a 40 year old white man like it is just like from the perspective of like the people that are writing Kylo Ren is a hipster who drinks cold brew. Yeah. Yeah. Got him. Got him. I wrote this down. This is the they went after Rebecca Black pretty hard in 2011.

627
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:21,240
Rebecca Rebecca Black she gets pushed out in like a tiny car and then she gets killed by Mr. Chow from the Hangover and then everybody dances to sexy and I know it with Osama Bin Laden and then Thor gives him a D a lap dance.

628
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:29,160
It's kind of just like the perfect synthesis of what what this show is and just the insane heights of just like jamming things together.

629
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:39,580
So Osama Bin Laden reminds me like I made sure to watch the 2001 one because I figured like oh god people would have been watching this like right in the aftermath.

630
01:00:39,780 --> 01:00:49,520
Yeah. September 11th and I was thinking like what what would they have slipped in like did they change that was a very heavy handed patriotism.

631
01:00:49,580 --> 01:01:03,480
And the two things that stuck out to me were one Jay and Silent Bob are in it a lot. Yeah. Because that was the year Jay and Silent Bob straight back swept to the multiplex in the summer of 2001.

632
01:01:04,180 --> 01:01:10,420
Those seem like the perfect characters to still be hosting. Yeah. Actually that's a better idea strangely.

633
01:01:10,780 --> 01:01:21,820
And in this one also I hope I'm not jumping on you here Jason but they are they appear at the beginning of the show and throughout it seems like but then also separately Blunt Man and Chronic.

634
01:01:22,620 --> 01:01:25,460
Oh and Chronic as well. OK I'm glad there's both of them.

635
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:31,140
No I assume it would be weird to have just Blunt Man as far as I know unless the description is wrong.

636
01:01:31,620 --> 01:01:33,960
Only Blunt Man. That's outrageous.

637
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:36,840
Blunt Man is the more famous of the two characters.

638
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:39,880
Is Blunt Man more famous than Chronic you feel?

639
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:42,640
I do. Blunt Man is like Batman.

640
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:48,840
Oh yeah. Chronic is a sidekick. Chronic isn't really like Robin. Which one which character is Blunt Man?

641
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:50,060
Kevin is Blunt Man.

642
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:55,480
So there's two Kevin Smith characters in this show but not two Jason Muses.

643
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:57,960
Yes that's.

644
01:01:58,040 --> 01:02:07,240
Great chart that and also Cornelius from Planet of the Apes and then the synopsis just calls it one of the good apes from Planet of the Apes.

645
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:10,360
But also Charlton Heston from Planet of the Apes.

646
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:16,080
He's got a little sash that says NRA on it like baby new year. He looks like baby new year.

647
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:21,640
But his sash says NRA and he's he's just doing Planet of the Apes lines.

648
01:02:22,460 --> 01:02:30,060
And and he also then Marky Mark Wahlberg is represented like they make fun of him for being Marky Mark.

649
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:35,280
And Heston gives him shit for playing his his old character badly.

650
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:40,340
And in fact Heston goes so far as to tell Marky Mark to eat his shorts.

651
01:02:40,980 --> 01:02:41,900
Wow.

652
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:43,760
The page.

653
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:44,460
In 2001.

654
01:02:45,060 --> 01:02:46,140
Yeah in 2001.

655
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:49,420
It was post 9-11 you gotta remember everybody was punchy telling each other to eat their shorts.

656
01:02:50,580 --> 01:02:52,080
What else about patriots.

657
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:57,340
Oh so of course if you're going to have Silent Bob there he's got to talk at some point.

658
01:02:57,720 --> 01:03:03,060
And his thing that he talks at one point is how he's proud to be a patriot and an American.

659
01:03:03,060 --> 01:03:04,120
Oh my god.

660
01:03:05,020 --> 01:03:06,900
It's a whole monologue about being an American.

661
01:03:07,260 --> 01:03:15,880
And then the other thing that happens that really stuck out because it is very long is at the end.

662
01:03:16,580 --> 01:03:22,020
There is a long sequence where they play the Hendrix Star Spangled Banner.

663
01:03:22,020 --> 01:03:30,740
Which I know which I mean it's pretty recognizable but also the person holding the video camera who

664
01:03:30,740 --> 01:03:35,880
2001 the video online is great because this is one of our favorite things like in the Bare Metal

665
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:41,580
family in the Hard Rock Park where the guy is clearly entranced by the sexy ladies.

666
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:50,160
This features a guy videotaping it but also commenting to his friend like oh boy I didn't

667
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:52,120
know this was going to be like that.

668
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:59,740
Like he sounds like a sketch comedy like person wrote a comedy sketch and the only detail for a

669
01:03:59,740 --> 01:04:01,880
character is like working class Joe.

670
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:08,880
And he talks like he's kind of from Brooklyn or somewhere and he's just going like every now and

671
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:11,860
he goes like oh no I'm a married man.

672
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:13,680
Like he's just saying it like that.

673
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:18,920
But he goes oh Hendrix Star Spangled Banner.

674
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:30,500
He says something like that and I think this I think this is one of the ones where people

675
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:36,220
in kiss makeup shows up and he also makes sure to acknowledge like that's kiss.

676
01:04:37,180 --> 01:04:39,660
Like he's so jazzed he's so excited.

677
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:42,140
Kiss is here take that al-qaeda.

678
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:49,780
And then at the very end he goes like I knew this was going to be good like I told you we should

679
01:04:49,780 --> 01:04:52,520
I'm glad we came glad we did this.

680
01:04:53,140 --> 01:04:57,620
I think I can safely say he speaks for the whole audience.

681
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:00,120
Yeah he speaks for the whole country.

682
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:03,100
He speaks for them that's why this ran so long.

683
01:05:03,220 --> 01:05:03,500
Yeah.

684
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:04,960
They all think that.

685
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:07,440
They all are like wow kiss is here.

686
01:05:07,540 --> 01:05:10,100
Wow I'm married I shouldn't have sex with those women.

687
01:05:10,100 --> 01:05:13,940
They're thinking these thoughts and they're like wow that was great.

688
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:21,000
Can I talk a little about 2002 because this is where 2002 is where my brain shattered.

689
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:23,600
Is Osama bin Laden in this?

690
01:05:23,860 --> 01:05:24,120
No still not.

691
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:25,820
Osama bin Laden has got to be the bad guy in one of these.

692
01:05:25,820 --> 01:05:29,320
He's the bad his Osama and Saddam are the bad guys in 2003.

693
01:05:29,380 --> 01:05:30,160
We'll get into that after.

694
01:05:30,320 --> 01:05:30,480
Okay.

695
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:31,880
We'll go in order.

696
01:05:32,260 --> 01:05:32,680
Let's just keep going.

697
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:36,300
What I rely on you guys for because I was like I assume they will do it.

698
01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:38,680
I can't do this anymore and I will tell you where I stop.

699
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:44,660
And you can see like my paragraphs were very long and then I just stops up for three lines

700
01:05:44,660 --> 01:05:53,800
because here's just highlights the Osborn's come out they're interrupted by Dr. Evil.

701
01:05:53,820 --> 01:05:59,160
Par for the course Dr. Evil's back and then you know Serlina shows up.

702
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:03,440
Of course the villainess of Men in Black 2.

703
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:09,340
Lara Flynn Boyle's Serlina you should know that Jason that's from your favorite song

704
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:10,580
Black Suits Come and Not Yet.

705
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:14,860
Serlina does not make a huge appearance in the Black Suits Come and Music video.

706
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:19,180
It's the only reason I know the name is because like so this is chick Serlina right.

707
01:06:19,380 --> 01:06:23,060
She be tripping like oh yeah that's the only reason I know the name Serlina.

708
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:23,640
Okay fair.

709
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:29,280
But so Serlina and then the Men in Black are also there and they receive a transmission

710
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:35,200
from the ultimate supreme being who turns out to be triumph the insult comic dog.

711
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:39,040
And then I melt then I went I left and I got in bed.

712
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:45,360
I could not handle any more stolen characters from legitimate comedy enterprises.

713
01:06:45,720 --> 01:06:49,640
What do you mean triumph the insult and I assume from the I don't know if anyone else

714
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:54,440
2002 in front of you I just was staring at a paragraph that was much more of the same

715
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:57,820
and like you know what I will wait I'll do it on the day.

716
01:06:57,840 --> 01:07:06,700
They can tell me that you know like Jimmy Fallon's Nick Burns the computer guy comes

717
01:07:06,700 --> 01:07:09,400
out and fixes the lighting the lighting grid.

718
01:07:10,540 --> 01:07:12,720
No more no more of this.

719
01:07:13,460 --> 01:07:18,060
One thing that's interesting to me is that just because of like what was popular at pop

720
01:07:18,060 --> 01:07:23,960
culture in the time sometimes characters will show up who down the line end up in the universal

721
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:31,720
parks like Mr. Burns shows up in 2000 but the Simpsons ride doesn't come along till 2008.

722
01:07:32,220 --> 01:07:42,340
A transformer shows up at some point well before the ride Harry Pothead the Harry Potter take off

723
01:07:42,340 --> 01:07:47,840
shows up long before I was surprised what year he showed up in because I feel like it was

724
01:07:48,780 --> 01:07:49,200
the movies.

725
01:07:49,660 --> 01:07:54,240
Do you think they're testing the waters for the characters to see how big the pop is and

726
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:57,940
that if the character gets a great response at the Horror Night show that maybe they'll put the

727
01:07:57,940 --> 01:08:02,640
ride in possible maybe the Dukes of Hazard ride was a possibility if they had gotten a bigger pop

728
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:03,620
when they did the show.

729
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:06,700
I mean the rock killed and now he's in the tour.

730
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:15,020
But if Nacho Libre had done better when he came out a real thing that happened maybe there would

731
01:08:15,020 --> 01:08:16,860
have been a Nacho Libre ride.

732
01:08:17,020 --> 01:08:21,260
That's true yes or if Anna Nicole Smith had gotten a bigger reaction there would be an Anna

733
01:08:21,260 --> 01:08:22,440
Nicole Smith ride.

734
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:28,360
I could go meet that designer of hers or whatever it's a guy who had the weird name.

735
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:33,180
I just know the lawyer Howard K Stern that he would have been in Robot on the Ride with the

736
01:08:33,180 --> 01:08:33,340
baby.

737
01:08:33,340 --> 01:08:34,400
The judge.

738
01:08:34,900 --> 01:08:36,480
Oh oh Judge Larry.

739
01:08:36,540 --> 01:08:37,080
Yeah yeah.

740
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:38,640
Judge Larry Sideland from the Anna Nicole.

741
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:40,660
Why am I just insane things on this episode.

742
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:45,460
That's just like villain Ted the villain Ted spirit has got you caught up in it.

743
01:08:45,580 --> 01:08:47,220
Listing things like the show.

744
01:08:47,220 --> 01:08:49,940
We are doing it.

745
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:56,040
This episode is a big list and it's I can only assume very trying on the audience or people

746
01:08:56,040 --> 01:09:01,560
have screamed as we've said each reference and I encourage you to at home just next time a

747
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:04,640
character has said just try giving a big yell.

748
01:09:04,740 --> 01:09:05,400
I think you'll have fun.

749
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:12,540
You made a reference like Paula Dean getting punched by Django and Dr. Schultz.

750
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:15,880
For a scream go ahead and scream at home.

751
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:18,660
Wait by who.

752
01:09:19,300 --> 01:09:20,580
Dr. Schultz.

753
01:09:20,580 --> 01:09:24,980
Dr. Schultz is the Kristoff Waltz's character who helps Django.

754
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:28,540
They use those characters in the villain Ted show.

755
01:09:28,620 --> 01:09:32,640
Yes and then they punch Paula Dean because she was racist.

756
01:09:33,940 --> 01:09:42,520
I say Garfield repeatedly gets mad about being mistaken for Puss in Boots so he pisses on the

757
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:45,860
W. Bush punches Dr. Evil and says don't mess with Texas.

758
01:09:45,860 --> 01:09:48,840
This is from the 2004 show.

759
01:09:49,820 --> 01:09:56,440
Everyone was like how is villain Ted the election years are very fun and their take in 2004 on Bush

760
01:09:56,440 --> 01:09:59,620
and Kerry is what if Dr. Evil ran for president.

761
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:06,020
Two years after any Austin Powers movie was made and his vice presidential candidate is Mr. Burns

762
01:10:06,020 --> 01:10:09,760
and he assembles his cabinet and this is the best.

763
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:14,400
If you're home please look up the 2004 Orlando villain Ted show.

764
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:22,300
Dr. Evil is the villain and his cabinet is Mr. Burns the wicked witch of the west and

765
01:10:22,300 --> 01:10:26,640
Michael Jackson is the secretary of child services.

766
01:10:27,660 --> 01:10:32,880
He carries Harry Potter off stage to have sex with him at some point.

767
01:10:33,020 --> 01:10:35,880
Django them out for balcony.

768
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:38,600
He has Darth Vader kidnap Bush and Kerry.

769
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:42,840
It's like this rogues gallery of all these cartoon even you're watching the wicked witch

770
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:46,120
the west and Darth Vader run around and be like hee hee hee.

771
01:10:46,180 --> 01:10:49,800
Why the wicked witch then because there's wicked witches in other years but when was that Franco

772
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:53,820
one the the the witch in many years later.

773
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:56,480
Yeah so why in 2004 is the wicked witch.

774
01:10:56,520 --> 01:11:00,200
Because it's such a wicked maybe wicked come back.

775
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:03,860
Dr. Evil so evil he's got to get all the evil.

776
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:05,160
He's got to get all those bad guys.

777
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:07,060
There's no reason for Vader to be in it.

778
01:11:07,060 --> 01:11:10,220
He got all the worst Michael Jackson the wicked witch of the west.

779
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:13,500
They had to step it up there are other ones like that like in the early years it does

780
01:11:13,500 --> 01:11:18,540
seem like the thing is combining all the villains like I have I made a just a pure list as you did

781
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:25,940
earlier bread of one point on the stage at the same time I believe Kirk Picard not evil but then

782
01:11:25,940 --> 01:11:33,500
we get evil the Borg Queen Ripley not evil men in black not evil the Terminator Darth Vader

783
01:11:33,580 --> 01:11:40,520
Poison Ivy and Mr. Freeze all at the same time and then we're going to be all over the map.

784
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:46,320
Let me take you to 1997 really fast a couple good things here.

785
01:11:48,100 --> 01:11:53,180
The the back to the future theme starts and the DeLorean appears but then it's not Doc and Marty

786
01:11:53,180 --> 01:11:56,720
that get out it's the cast of Seinfeld.

787
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:06,080
I'm sorry Seinfeld says now this is a show about nothing then Bill's cell phone rings

788
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:10,780
and it's the villain from scream who appears in it's in his hood and mask then he throws

789
01:12:10,780 --> 01:12:17,880
off the disguise to reveal he is actually Austin Powers then the men in black interrupt and

790
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:26,460
perform their song then Elaine from Seinfeld butts in and starts singing wanna be by the

791
01:12:26,460 --> 01:12:34,800
Spice Girls Elaine does this along with the Borg Queen and Batgirl then the Bill and Ted's

792
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:39,900
band Wild Stallions who we should say factory in a fair amount they that's the that's the

793
01:12:39,900 --> 01:12:44,800
right name right with all wise Wild Stallions yes because they constantly say it during the

794
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:51,640
and there's a giant Wild Stallions logo on stage sometimes and it took me about three

795
01:12:51,640 --> 01:12:59,140
viewings like three years watching to go like what the fuck is Wild Stallion and I'm like

796
01:12:59,140 --> 01:13:06,120
oh that's their band that's right these characters have a band like that's I did not remember you

797
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:11,680
get a lot of credit for knowing the basic facts about Bill and Ted at all I don't even think I've

798
01:13:11,680 --> 01:13:15,840
ever seen those movies all the way through the second one used to be on Comedy Central all the

799
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:22,640
time so they'd catch it like 15 minutes at a time but otherwise yeah they they're pretty lost

800
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:28,900
I should also say then at the end Kramer blows up the set a thing Kramer would do

801
01:13:28,900 --> 01:13:35,720
be like Gonzo the Muppet and like have a bunch of explosives and in season nine he might have done

802
01:13:35,720 --> 01:13:39,560
something like that he was getting a little wackier toward the end yeah that's true yeah

803
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:46,920
where that gag where he sees where he's a chicken or whatever in in that 97 one it before Kramer

804
01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:52,080
blows up the set it does end with Bill and Ted and Captain Kirk performing Smells Like Teen

805
01:13:52,080 --> 01:14:00,740
Spirits again years after there's Captain Kirk why Captain Kirk sings he was in Star Trek

806
01:14:00,740 --> 01:14:09,540
Generations in 1996 so that's why it's Kirk and the Hard together yes yeah yeah but the

807
01:14:09,540 --> 01:14:15,800
gate is first contact so I guess that's yes you should do a listing year drinking game

808
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:21,020
yeah everyone should take a shot when something is listed every time we say something that

809
01:14:21,020 --> 01:14:26,040
happened I mean this is what being at the Bill and Ted show is like right we're listing 26

810
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:29,480
years of things that happen in their show but they just list the things that happened this

811
01:14:29,480 --> 01:14:35,840
year yeah did we also just do a dance break for 15 minutes at the end of the episode oh we all do

812
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:44,880
backpack kid dance oh yeah the one thing that keeps coming back is uh Ethan Hunt uh repels it

813
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:55,800
but okay here's my thing the even hunt drops from the ceiling in 99 but the second movie hadn't

814
01:14:55,800 --> 01:15:01,620
come out yet and the first movie is a few years old then in the year that Mission Impossible 2

815
01:15:01,620 --> 01:15:07,460
came out he drops from the ceiling again the same gimmick like in Mission Impossible 1 but they are

816
01:15:07,460 --> 01:15:13,440
playing the Limp Bizkit song from Mission Impossible 2 that we like so much oh yeah our anthem for

817
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:20,060
skydiving so yeah and I feel like people going like Ethan Hunt like that gets a big pop but I

818
01:15:20,060 --> 01:15:24,500
would I kind of want to Ethan Hunt Mission Impossible 2 Ethan Hunt to ride in on a motorcycle

819
01:15:24,500 --> 01:15:29,800
I'm looking at 96 and Ethan Hunt of course comes out and performs old time rock and roll

820
01:15:30,980 --> 01:15:35,180
yeah which is of course the underwear dance from Risky Business which is two Tom Cruise characters

821
01:15:35,180 --> 01:15:41,060
so you could say that's kind of clever this show loves Risky Business Tom Cruise yeah we've seen

822
01:15:41,060 --> 01:15:46,440
multiple we've seen ones from like 2006 where he rolls out yeah it's like they they really do they

823
01:15:46,440 --> 01:15:51,700
love to confuse whoever the actor is with their right role like there's a lot of uh I've seen a

824
01:15:51,700 --> 01:15:56,900
lot of the guy who plays Bill saying to the guy who plays Ted my movie career is not going as good

825
01:15:57,660 --> 01:16:04,060
as yours Keanu oh yeah that's more sad than anything else Alex Winter though we've talked

826
01:16:04,060 --> 01:16:09,580
to to tie it all to tie it back to you know tween culture we're talking about Alex Winter a prolific

827
01:16:09,580 --> 01:16:15,500
director within that more didn't he he directed Smosh the movie yep he did yeah wow how about

828
01:16:15,500 --> 01:16:20,640
that so he's up to a lot fine Smosh that I don't think has appeared I would like if they had started

829
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:27,280
to get to that zone we're like Fred like you too characters you're annoying hasn't appeared

830
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:32,060
Fred would be good yeah and Fred would be a good candidate for like an older more established

831
01:16:32,060 --> 01:16:41,020
celebrity who dads like to if he punched uh Fred out if like oh yeah you know Judge Dredd uh punched

832
01:16:41,020 --> 01:16:50,440
Fred in the face yeah you mean to tell me Bill and Ted did not address when the one of the two Smosh

833
01:16:50,580 --> 01:16:56,980
that would be yeah for for the 2018 version the villain would be Anthony Padilla

834
01:16:56,980 --> 01:17:05,140
for daring to break up the duo yeah he's trying to split up Bill and Ted well and you know that

835
01:17:05,140 --> 01:17:10,400
when Bill and Ted got them yeah yeah he's like an end to all duos and then he'd get them back

836
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:18,280
together and he and the other Smosh guy would kiss and oh yeah to be like ew gross let's dance

837
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:25,460
let's ignore them and dance um anyone else say anything you like uh oh wait you know what I'm

838
01:17:25,460 --> 01:17:30,740
sorry one thing that we've missed here and Jason I think you alluded to it in all of the all of the

839
01:17:30,740 --> 01:17:35,240
characters that we have mentioned coming out we've forgotten and something that you guys kept up in

840
01:17:35,240 --> 01:17:47,960
the live show very well is that they are always presented in a way of Bill and Ted saying in

841
01:17:47,960 --> 01:17:57,120
one as well 96 always that delivery Brad and Nick in in one of your uh UCB shows uh my favorite

842
01:17:57,120 --> 01:18:05,320
one of that was when uh the very funny Devin Field came out as uh the they went the founder

843
01:18:05,320 --> 01:18:14,000
it was right croc right yeah we had the we like just combining things uh it was like there were

844
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:17,880
some Rick and Morty fans who were mad they weren't getting their Szechuan sauce from McDonald's and

845
01:18:17,880 --> 01:18:25,980
the founder comes out and gives it to them they lap it up from his hands and Szechuan sauce does

846
01:18:25,980 --> 01:18:30,960
show up in the 2017 version oh yeah we like predicted things in our show that they did in

847
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:36,520
like yeah anything else you remember there there was are the first it was the first year that we

848
01:18:36,520 --> 01:18:43,920
did we did a thing of like uh it was like Jurassic World uh like uh taking like their their uh

849
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:47,280
dinosaur machine got broken so it was like celebrities were coming out and they're like

850
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:51,780
combined and then they ended up doing that they ended up the real Bill and Ted show did that like

851
01:18:51,780 --> 01:18:57,680
the next year yeah wow yeah smart theirs were called Kardashian Raptors or whatever but we

852
01:18:57,680 --> 01:19:03,780
had it was like the the hybrid celebrities it was just stupid like little jokes of like gamer

853
01:19:03,780 --> 01:19:13,380
Gatlin Jenner oh my god I said Mike I interested so you wanted to highlight I was just gonna say

854
01:19:14,060 --> 01:19:20,860
my favorite thing from 96 is just Sean Connery James Bond coming out and suggesting to Bill and

855
01:19:20,860 --> 01:19:27,800
Ted let's get ready to rock I watched video that year and he does a big like it's like James Bond

856
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:32,680
comes out and it's a guy doing Sean Connery James Bond in 96 and he's like you were expecting

857
01:19:32,680 --> 01:19:37,120
someone else and the gets no reaction from the crowd I think the crowd's supposed to cheer because

858
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:41,560
they like him and not Piers Brosnan is what but everyone liked Piers Brosnan yeah I think an old

859
01:19:41,560 --> 01:19:47,280
man wrote it and was like we all miss this guy right and then he also wrote out in like a generic

860
01:19:47,280 --> 01:19:55,800
kind of convertible like a Cadillac like not a British like not it was just whatever was

861
01:19:55,800 --> 01:20:00,560
backstage that they could use and then the song that plays after that is Rock This Town by the

862
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:08,360
Straight Cats which would lead guitar by Mulder right right Mulder and Scully involved I left

863
01:20:08,360 --> 01:20:16,660
that out I'm sorry yeah one thing I think that we alluded to earlier that I do want to talk about

864
01:20:16,660 --> 01:20:24,080
so the no photography and videotaping okay because there's a lot of levels to this you know there's

865
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:29,160
been speculation online like we were saying that there was like legal threats or like they weren't

866
01:20:29,160 --> 01:20:36,660
supposed to do some sort of stuff for other companies that threatened the lawsuits but then

867
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:43,200
the the other thing about the no oh and no photo and video so that like the media did not have a

868
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:51,420
field day with it so to enforce the no photo or video I'm reading this from Halloween Horror

869
01:20:51,420 --> 01:20:57,240
Nights dot wikia dot com a very detailed website chronicling Halloween Horror Nights history

870
01:20:57,240 --> 01:21:03,920
according to reports from Bill and Ted audience members in 2009 and 2010 team members assigned to

871
01:21:04,200 --> 01:21:10,060
show security guards and officers of the Orlando police department have a top priority of seeking

872
01:21:10,060 --> 01:21:15,320
would-be photographers in the theater and keeping all their eyes sharply focused on each audience

873
01:21:15,320 --> 01:21:20,440
remember and will run right up to them with a flashlight the moment someone whips out a camera

874
01:21:20,440 --> 01:21:27,040
universal excuse me universal has said to be borrowing top ranked officers from the

875
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:33,560
Orlando police department to work a billion dead and universal employees or security guards will

876
01:21:33,560 --> 01:21:39,740
often turn the violator over to an OPD officer if they are caught and will allow them to deal with

877
01:21:39,740 --> 01:21:45,820
the person some of the guests who have been caught using photography and subsequently turned over

878
01:21:45,820 --> 01:21:52,400
claim to have been roughly treated by the cops on their way out of universal and some of them

879
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:58,400
other details that they had their camera permanently confiscated were taken to a backstage area where

880
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:04,580
were interrogated by an officer for answers were physically harmed or were incarcerated at the

881
01:22:04,580 --> 01:22:10,220
Orange County corrections facility for the night most of the people thrown out had also been

882
01:22:10,220 --> 01:22:15,600
reported to have been banned from the universal studios property ranging from a year to even a

883
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:22,180
lifetime why did you just kick them out for the night with a warrant like this is so intense they

884
01:22:22,300 --> 01:22:28,500
essentially hired off-duty or on-duty police officers to be Pinkerton's for this

885
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:35,040
villain dead show too rough up they're looking for the elite of the police force the toughest

886
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:41,640
most well-trained people to drag a person with a cell phone camera out of their arena throw them

887
01:22:41,640 --> 01:22:49,040
against a wall and say did you did you film the part where the wedding singer performs while

888
01:22:49,040 --> 01:22:56,800
Bill Clinton plays sax to win Monica Lewinsky back is that on your camera hey give me your film

889
01:22:56,800 --> 01:23:02,880
you piece of shit i'm a married man but i'm keeping your fucking gopro buddy

890
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:12,000
did you film the reggae predator smoking a bomb a real thing from the 2008 show

891
01:23:12,760 --> 01:23:18,860
uh why what is the what after everything we've just described let's add to this nightmare

892
01:23:18,860 --> 01:23:25,160
that it is being like that there are there's like military rules uh they like there's that

893
01:23:25,160 --> 01:23:31,400
there's like the incredible surveillance also we didn't work they're all on youtube now yeah

894
01:23:31,400 --> 01:23:36,580
every one of these videos has a warning saying not to tape it it's also interesting that just

895
01:23:36,580 --> 01:23:43,000
what took down the show was just like and like a written article it wasn't like video of

896
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:48,320
yeah oh that's gay superman it was just like a guy dryly describing this is what the show is and

897
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:53,000
then just going beat by beat just being kind of like this was just saying what the show is and

898
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:56,480
like that's what destroyed it like they didn't have to go through all of like this secret police

899
01:23:56,480 --> 01:24:02,720
it was not terribly judgmental and you know like far be it for me if there are more crazy details

900
01:24:02,720 --> 01:24:07,800
to share well we can find a part to do it but maybe we could talk about the 2013 show that

901
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:11,820
brought the whole enterprise down or at least in in hollywood and you're correct that it's like

902
01:24:11,820 --> 01:24:17,480
i mean i don't know it didn't feel to me like a super judgmental article because it is just like

903
01:24:17,480 --> 01:24:22,600
laying out here's what it was which if i copy pasted some quotes and there's you know the

904
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:28,060
writer says there's a scene where a shark nato appears and kim jung-hoon comes onto the stage

905
01:24:28,060 --> 01:24:33,320
to explain that the shark nato came into an exit into existence as a result of christin stewart

906
01:24:33,320 --> 01:24:42,000
sucking his dick too hard and they made a shark nato happen rather than a regular tornado where

907
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:48,220
did the sharks factor in um i don't maybe there's some nearby sharks that kim jung-hoon owned that

908
01:24:48,220 --> 01:24:57,820
swept up into the flurry of uh oral sex uh suction i uh and then like oh and then there's

909
01:24:57,820 --> 01:25:04,000
a moment there's a thing about corrie monteith's ghost they are mocking the recently dead of heroin

910
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:13,600
glee star gory mott very bleak a little bit yes bleak for them um but really where the the thing

911
01:25:14,260 --> 01:25:21,340
they did not get away with and rightfully so is that there is a and i just bolded these five words

912
01:25:21,340 --> 01:25:29,300
a witch turns superman gay and what you have and there's video of this just the most like

913
01:25:29,300 --> 01:25:38,780
mincing awful queen stereotype of uh of a gay person there is just no defending this or i don't

914
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:44,660
speak to you if you feel like defending this uh and it's not even i don't know it's not like it's

915
01:25:44,660 --> 01:25:51,020
the most offensive thing you've ever seen but it is but also it's not funny in any capacity and that

916
01:25:51,020 --> 01:25:56,500
could have saved it if it was like on the edge and like that's a bit of a stereotype but you know as

917
01:25:56,500 --> 01:26:02,580
a guy performed it felt like this is not no this is not what this if this is like what this show is

918
01:26:02,580 --> 01:26:07,940
this is the philosophy and it's what they're fighting for like don't um this is we should

919
01:26:07,940 --> 01:26:20,120
let this go it it it was 2013 it was 2013 which does not feel that long ago i guess we've come a

920
01:26:20,120 --> 01:26:28,760
long way since then and then we all fell into a toilet we fell we then went backwards well past

921
01:26:28,760 --> 01:26:36,240
2013 i don't know i mean i have like there there is i have read people writing about like oh

922
01:26:36,600 --> 01:26:41,700
mo erotic subtext in superman the zack snyder superman and stuff that does not seem like

923
01:26:41,700 --> 01:26:45,720
something they considered for this or like they saw that you're saying this is not some sort of

924
01:26:45,720 --> 01:26:52,760
a commentary on the zack snyder movie no i don't think it is uh but yeah this is just so i mean i

925
01:26:52,760 --> 01:26:59,720
guess what year was the the uh i mean the horrible prop eight was passed in 2008 but when did this

926
01:27:00,260 --> 01:27:08,220
legalize gay marriage was that 2009 2010 or something yeah so that was not that long before

927
01:27:08,220 --> 01:27:16,440
2013 but like also this is that this show was done in hollywood in the entertainment industry

928
01:27:16,440 --> 01:27:21,220
it's in the heart of the entertainment industry in a city with a very large gay population like

929
01:27:21,220 --> 01:27:28,420
that this is happening and that no one went like hey maybe we should not do this he's just bonkers

930
01:27:29,640 --> 01:27:33,740
single joke beyond that he's he's gay i don't think it's not the craziest thing in the world

931
01:27:33,740 --> 01:27:38,980
for a character to like have like effeminate qualities but there are jokes beyond that but

932
01:27:38,980 --> 01:27:44,800
this truly is like hey and that's it there's a single thing going on here which it happens

933
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:50,300
in the 2007 one i watched too where you know the pirates of the caribbean come out but then they

934
01:27:50,300 --> 01:27:56,340
turn to each other and your jitterbug and wake me up before you go go starts and they just like

935
01:27:56,680 --> 01:28:02,740
dance and flap their wrists around and like what are we doing what that's it that's what you got

936
01:28:02,740 --> 01:28:08,800
is like yeah just like we're gonna show what we think gay people are like it's really weird it's

937
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:12,100
really it's like the same i'm a gay guy it's like the same way they would play like gay people in

938
01:28:12,100 --> 01:28:16,600
like the 70s or 80s or something but like there's still bill and ted like gay people started being

939
01:28:16,600 --> 01:28:21,540
treated like humans in like 2009 or 2010 or something and then this is still happening on

940
01:28:21,540 --> 01:28:26,140
the bill and ted stage in 2013 it's the gay people from it's the gay characters from like

941
01:28:26,140 --> 01:28:30,100
mel brooks movies which is very regrettable it makes it a little harder to watch those movies

942
01:28:30,100 --> 01:28:36,980
pre-soap yeah yeah yeah i have a i have an interview with one of the writers just a short

943
01:28:36,980 --> 01:28:42,500
quote about the 2003 show oh boy yes please said i am also proud of some of the risks we took this

944
01:28:42,500 --> 01:28:51,520
year with some of our characters if you've seen the show you know who i am talking about i don't

945
01:28:51,520 --> 01:28:56,340
the booze these two characters receive and how these boos turn to laughter when the audience

946
01:28:56,340 --> 01:29:02,480
realizes how much fun we are making fun of these guys so much fun what a risk doing his part

947
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:07,260
yeah i think too like i'm really like sticking it to these guys yeah he was like helping america

948
01:29:07,260 --> 01:29:11,400
but how they portray saddam and osama in the show is do you guys want to get let's

949
01:29:11,400 --> 01:29:17,900
um they're all they're gay they're gay they're all they're just gay they're gay for each other

950
01:29:17,900 --> 01:29:24,640
they're wearing a victoria secret underwear yeah oh okay all gay men do exactly yes yes

951
01:29:24,640 --> 01:29:31,140
how do you make them even more evil i know make them gay yeah like i know everybody i know we're

952
01:29:31,140 --> 01:29:35,620
all like scared of these guys and what they might do to our country next but keep in mind they're

953
01:29:35,620 --> 01:29:46,240
gay i that said i think if if there was a 2018 bill and ted trump would be kissing every man

954
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:51,980
like that low hanging fruit of like trump kisses putin that happened on saturday night live

955
01:29:51,980 --> 01:29:57,660
last year i think that's true that's what it happened i was not arguing that it didn't

956
01:29:57,660 --> 01:30:02,480
suck no i know i know you weren't but yeah i finally got into how trump how much trump wants

957
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:11,080
to kiss spicer we all know it yeah what huh what are we like okay so this this article comes i mean

958
01:30:11,080 --> 01:30:15,220
i sort of i guess i got into it earlier but then yeah the show is the show is canceled for the year

959
01:30:15,640 --> 01:30:24,540
and their people are mad about it partially on the with the justification of well they had to let all

960
01:30:24,540 --> 01:30:29,720
of these actors go and that's a regrettable thing that's not a good thing as with the

961
01:30:29,720 --> 01:30:35,620
this the rosanne which played out in a very similar but with much higher stakes way this year

962
01:30:35,620 --> 01:30:40,260
really bill and ted was really a like predecessor of we don't live in the bill and ted show

963
01:30:40,820 --> 01:30:46,220
someone think about uh john goodman's financial stability no yes please everything

964
01:30:46,220 --> 01:30:54,400
going on in the world please um but so like yeah that's that's unfortunate but also i don't know

965
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:58,160
maybe you like put all the other actors into something else but also but then there was a

966
01:30:58,160 --> 01:31:05,040
follow-up article by the same vice writer uh who put i'll just read her quote which is a very

967
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:09,460
it's a guy it is a guy oh wait the name is the yeah the name's janey i was in the way yeah okay

968
01:31:09,460 --> 01:31:17,020
okay so uh the the writer says um uh well first of all he says as people call him people wrote him

969
01:31:17,020 --> 01:31:20,640
said like you know all these actors are out of work because of you you're you're a huge sack of

970
01:31:20,640 --> 01:31:24,980
shit also are we sure about that they couldn't just make them scare actor they couldn't just

971
01:31:24,980 --> 01:31:31,080
yeah they have other roles in yeah also it's a month long job more monsters like yeah also maybe

972
01:31:31,280 --> 01:31:36,960
pay them out for the whole yeah it's on the actors fault because it's your fault for putting for

973
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:43,040
approving a lisp and gay character and probably we're not being paid a lot of money well yeah i

974
01:31:43,040 --> 01:31:47,860
can only assume if there's specific skills that these uh theme park performers have some of them

975
01:31:47,860 --> 01:31:53,760
get a higher pay that is true stunt performers or professional dancers or mike myer character

976
01:31:53,760 --> 01:32:00,180
impersonators yeah man they have the strongest union in hollywood this is a quick side note i

977
01:32:00,180 --> 01:32:04,760
texted you a couple years ago because i there was an uh a listing to play austin powers in

978
01:32:04,760 --> 01:32:10,700
universal singapore and i thought you should just do that for six months what a time that would be

979
01:32:10,700 --> 01:32:15,540
shipping jason off to singapore we didn't have a podcast at the time we weren't doing a lot so i

980
01:32:15,540 --> 01:32:19,840
figured we did not have a lot going on go to singapore as opposed to now when we have so much going

981
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:28,360
talking about sending jason but you wanted to send me to singapore like normal gets shipped to

982
01:32:28,620 --> 01:32:36,200
you like a crate i had a big crate that said to singapore and i took a trip i put a string of

983
01:32:36,200 --> 01:32:41,400
treats on the ground yeah you kept trying to get into the box i don't fall i know you you eat the

984
01:32:41,400 --> 01:32:48,320
treats and you leave the very last one i'm too smart for it now um but so the writer ends up

985
01:32:48,320 --> 01:32:52,720
saying uh i never wanted to cause people to lose their jobs when i wrote that original article

986
01:32:52,720 --> 01:32:56,940
i just wanted to you know maybe get them to be less viciously homophobic

987
01:32:56,940 --> 01:33:03,880
if there were mass firings over this it seems like a very very extreme reaction from universal

988
01:33:03,880 --> 01:33:08,340
studios we also by the way don't know for a fact that they let all the actors go this was like a

989
01:33:08,340 --> 01:33:13,800
thing a commenter just lept to and like stung the guy on and of course people were all so mad in a

990
01:33:13,800 --> 01:33:19,600
way of like oh what so we can't laugh about anything anymore all this pc boohoo sorry you

991
01:33:19,600 --> 01:33:26,680
offended and this is i don't understand why these wires are crossed like i don't think we are

992
01:33:26,680 --> 01:33:30,720
prudes but i think there's like i think there's speaking the envelope

993
01:33:30,720 --> 01:33:42,520
but the like that's no free speech is important and that is why we must have to have superman

994
01:33:44,020 --> 01:33:51,340
glitter lipstick like can't we do like push the envelope without the and again this all proceeds

995
01:33:51,340 --> 01:33:56,360
i had all these thoughts in 2013 and now that this is the arguments you are seeing and having

996
01:33:56,360 --> 01:34:03,680
every day of your damn life uh like i don't know there's a like can't we push the envelope without

997
01:34:03,680 --> 01:34:10,040
being like just like not understanding of cultures and people who have a hard time

998
01:34:10,820 --> 01:34:17,460
uh yeah there's my little oh i guess scott's virtue signaling even the even the terms that

999
01:34:17,460 --> 01:34:21,980
have gotten in the popular culture is like from the worst people in the from the like

1000
01:34:21,980 --> 01:34:27,160
yeah far right reactionary you can you can trace anyone in the audience of a bill and ted show to

1001
01:34:27,160 --> 01:34:34,320
being a proud boy now for any everyone who attended it's a real microcosm of all america's problems

1002
01:34:34,640 --> 01:34:41,440
dr evil pretends to be trump in 2004 oh wow really yeah does he take off the wig he puts

1003
01:34:41,440 --> 01:34:46,160
he puts on the wig when he's running for president by the way guys i think the bill and ted show

1004
01:34:46,160 --> 01:34:54,000
called it oh yeah does it like give any clues of what does trump then blow up the set like kramer

1005
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:58,580
i think he hires mr burns as his vice president so maybe that's where we're headed

1006
01:34:58,580 --> 01:35:03,840
this is gonna get fired then very sheer will be good but yeah but mr burns is kind of based on

1007
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:09,580
rupert murdoch and obviously trump is in league with rupert murdoch so it kind of did uh presage

1008
01:35:09,580 --> 01:35:16,560
that in a way um and trump also factors in in 2007 because there's a part where there are big

1009
01:35:16,560 --> 01:35:22,080
thunderous footsteps like jurassic park and bill and ted ask if it's an earthquake but then no it

1010
01:35:22,200 --> 01:35:30,140
is rosie o'donnell and she is she is very large they've given her a lot of padding and then her

1011
01:35:30,140 --> 01:35:37,800
enemy trump comes out and yells at her and rips his sleeves off and says come here you

1012
01:35:37,800 --> 01:35:45,140
bitch and then like oh my god the trump is the hero of that what's that trump is the

1013
01:35:45,140 --> 01:35:49,540
hero of that scenario we're supposed to be on trump's side as the audience like today

1014
01:35:49,540 --> 01:35:56,640
trump is the hero in the versus rosie he did also presaging in the debate he like says with a smile

1015
01:35:56,640 --> 01:36:03,180
yeah i did make fun of rosie and then he's like waiting for applause which he gets uh like we do

1016
01:36:03,180 --> 01:36:09,620
live in the bill and ted show um and then also in the wrestling match he at some point calls her

1017
01:36:09,620 --> 01:36:18,980
java the rosie as opposed to rosie the hut yeah that's right much cleaner yeah yeah the rosie

1018
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:25,180
you know we talk about in comedy punching up or punching down bill and ted was just punching

1019
01:36:25,180 --> 01:36:31,660
like was just walking in a room punching in any direction running head first into a wall just

1020
01:36:31,660 --> 01:36:41,300
no face blindfolded yeah it's a freak uh organism like the dinosaur hybrids that is all uh fists

1021
01:36:41,300 --> 01:36:47,380
and arms that has no it's just a big ball of punching arms yeah i don't rolling around i

1022
01:36:47,380 --> 01:36:57,380
hurt i just need to hurt i must hurt this is our like the id of america like the the dark side

1023
01:36:57,380 --> 01:37:03,340
of america is represented the bill and ted show which is then surrounded by haunted houses filled

1024
01:37:03,340 --> 01:37:17,340
with like fears murderers the asylums the pumpkin headed creatures scary killer clowns and uh

1025
01:37:17,340 --> 01:37:25,900
i am fascinated by the movement to bring the show back oh wow um and i went to the facebook

1026
01:37:25,900 --> 01:37:34,440
group which is a closed group save bill and ted and maga yeah that's a subtext i haven't come

1027
01:37:34,440 --> 01:37:38,620
across that statement but i believe that most people believe that did you have to change like

1028
01:37:38,620 --> 01:37:45,140
your uh your facebook picture to like a blue lives matter facebook photo to get in m m carlson

1029
01:37:46,860 --> 01:37:52,340
659243 it's like one of those ones with this string of numbers i did have to prove though

1030
01:37:52,340 --> 01:37:58,140
that i was a fan somehow and well not somehow but with a question and it said if you're a fan of

1031
01:37:58,140 --> 01:38:06,720
bill and ted uh what number oh very special what number are we thinking of and i wrote 69

1032
01:38:06,720 --> 01:38:12,980
of course i hit enter and i was approved within a minute wow so i think he got it i don't know if

1033
01:38:13,580 --> 01:38:18,820
i don't know if you can do an auto thing i do think an administrator got uh text on their phone

1034
01:38:18,820 --> 01:38:24,360
and it said oh somebody wants to join the group and she was like oh did he say 69 because i say

1035
01:38:24,360 --> 01:38:31,760
her because there's two female administrators uh so they approved me and this group has 1091 members

1036
01:38:31,760 --> 01:38:38,700
more than we have more than our facebook group yep yep yep and people are i'm just gonna put

1037
01:38:38,700 --> 01:38:44,440
first of all it links also to a petition there's a petition and this still active

1038
01:38:44,440 --> 01:38:51,860
facebook page to save bill and ted um so let's see here i wrote a couple of the these are from

1039
01:38:51,860 --> 01:38:56,980
the petition actually first um someone said bill and ted has become a holiday tradition in a strange

1040
01:38:56,980 --> 01:39:02,840
way it's like seeing the rockettes in new york city it's the only thing my fam whole family can

1041
01:39:02,840 --> 01:39:07,820
agree on when we do our annual trip to halloween horror nights uh that's okay that's this is another

1042
01:39:07,860 --> 01:39:11,400
person i've been going to halloween horror nights for 14 years in a row and the best part is always

1043
01:39:11,400 --> 01:39:14,980
bill and ted's excellent halloween adventure even though through the months leading up to

1044
01:39:14,980 --> 01:39:19,480
halloween horror nights i wonder if a particular event will end up in that year's show so they're

1045
01:39:19,480 --> 01:39:24,900
they're very excited about they're nervous uh yes it includes foul language scantily clad women and

1046
01:39:24,900 --> 01:39:31,540
men pyrotechnics etc but the main theme remains to be the same be excellent to each other

1047
01:39:33,220 --> 01:39:37,620
oh definitely they say that definitely the straight writers the bill and ted show are

1048
01:39:37,620 --> 01:39:42,060
being excellent to gay people yeah and then there's somebody who goes on and on about all like

1049
01:39:42,060 --> 01:39:47,460
my husband organizes a halloween horror night trip every year for his office and i want to let you

1050
01:39:47,460 --> 01:39:52,280
know that that's a loss of three thousand dollars if we don't go to horror nights this year

1051
01:39:52,280 --> 01:40:01,460
however will they make that back yeah board it up yeah

1052
01:40:02,840 --> 01:40:07,900
i everyone should go on the facebook they just say 69 and you'll get in um and i don't want to

1053
01:40:07,900 --> 01:40:13,680
start any shit with his facebook page though i'm like uh i don't want anybody bad side yeah

1054
01:40:13,680 --> 01:40:18,940
i think it'd be funny if we started the feud with the save bill and ted facebook group

1055
01:40:18,940 --> 01:40:24,440
that's all you my man all right fine we had a weird interaction with some oh yes

1056
01:40:24,440 --> 01:40:30,740
the yeah we were doing the show making fun of the bill and ted show at ucb for

1057
01:40:30,740 --> 01:40:35,420
a few years and uh one year i think i just wrote the description of the show in like a

1058
01:40:35,420 --> 01:40:39,520
just like i didn't spend any time i was just like the universal studio show was bad and we're doing

1059
01:40:39,520 --> 01:40:45,260
it now uh i guess a bunch of them saw a bunch of actors and dancers and a pyrotechnic guy

1060
01:40:45,260 --> 01:40:51,500
from the hollywood show saw it and were commenting and just being like this uh you guys are being

1061
01:40:51,500 --> 01:40:58,020
rude and mean we all worked hard on the show until like the facebook event for the show yeah well

1062
01:40:58,280 --> 01:41:03,140
i don't think if they're gonna be mad just about that two minute section they're gonna be very

1063
01:41:03,140 --> 01:41:07,220
displeased with the entire episode that we've just done yeah yeah we're in trouble i was gonna say

1064
01:41:07,220 --> 01:41:12,520
that's not no matter what um i was fine with them ripping the show apart until those two minutes

1065
01:41:12,520 --> 01:41:17,540
where they went on our page i just hope that that the in general that the take that's out there as

1066
01:41:17,540 --> 01:41:23,820
the writer from vice says she was not trying to end this certainly if people want it to come back

1067
01:41:23,820 --> 01:41:28,860
talk to universal studios who also years later ended it in orlando by the way it has had its

1068
01:41:28,860 --> 01:41:35,220
final year uh in orlando but like i just hope that no one is like viewing this issue as like

1069
01:41:35,220 --> 01:41:40,280
oh yeah well people got butt hurt now we can't have our fun show anymore because that's not what

1070
01:41:40,280 --> 01:41:47,060
happened no one said there was not some protest take the show down if had they eliminated the

1071
01:41:47,060 --> 01:41:52,540
offensive gay material we could have this could have kept going like i would also they're doing

1072
01:41:52,540 --> 01:41:57,660
a bill and ted show in general yeah i wanted to continue forever yeah actually yes and you guys

1073
01:41:57,660 --> 01:42:01,700
were trying to make it keep going yeah i would also argue they could have ignored the article

1074
01:42:01,700 --> 01:42:05,640
and kept doing the gay stuff and no one would have had said no one would have cared yeah no one

1075
01:42:05,640 --> 01:42:10,560
everyone the audience was would have been delighted and people might have gone to see it because of

1076
01:42:10,560 --> 01:42:22,520
the article that probably would have helped the numbers i want to go see superman yeah that's what

1077
01:42:23,340 --> 01:42:29,980
uh uh well i don't definitively know why but it's just an observation uh in orlando

1078
01:42:29,980 --> 01:42:37,820
this would take place in a giant outdoor stage covered stage that for many years was a wild west

1079
01:42:37,820 --> 01:42:43,100
stunt show which was fun like that show was fun to be cowboys shooting at each other and the

1080
01:42:43,100 --> 01:42:48,960
flat the set would fall down at some point eventually became fear factor live and remained

1081
01:42:48,960 --> 01:42:55,940
fear factor live well after fear factors popularity wait uh but it would be used for this bill and ted

1082
01:42:55,940 --> 01:43:02,960
show it is such a huge plot of real estate and in one of the most valuable theme park locations

1083
01:43:02,960 --> 01:43:12,100
in the war like it is crazy how this just takes up like a corner of the park this giant amphitheater

1084
01:43:12,100 --> 01:43:18,420
yeah it's right next to diagon alley in a perfect expansion area potentially for harry potter or

1085
01:43:18,640 --> 01:43:24,840
there's been a lot of speculation of like oh a ministry of magic battle right like in it's they

1086
01:43:24,840 --> 01:43:32,320
have this giant thing there they can have a harry potter a very hot head hot box experience yeah oh

1087
01:43:32,320 --> 01:43:37,380
man that would rule at least a halloween overlay of harry pothead oh yeah yeah sure oh that'd be

1088
01:43:37,380 --> 01:43:44,580
good i kind of like that honestly yeah but like it seems crazy to me that this not only that this

1089
01:43:44,580 --> 01:43:52,060
did for 26 years but that like it takes up so much yeah of this park uh fear factor also what

1090
01:43:52,060 --> 01:43:57,540
a strange that'll be when we get when we get around to the fear factor live episode that i saw a

1091
01:43:57,540 --> 01:44:05,640
couple times and it was never fun like it was very unnerving yeah um uh so i i do want to talk about

1092
01:44:05,640 --> 01:44:13,040
what the last year's one was because this is like the peak this was like accelerationism writ large

1093
01:44:13,040 --> 01:44:20,940
so it starts with sean spicer but not just any sean spicer melissa mccarthy on the rolling

1094
01:44:20,940 --> 01:44:28,500
podium sean literally from second one is doing a joke from a popular television show from a tv show

1095
01:44:28,500 --> 01:44:37,560
yeah but nbc universal property yeah so uh she scolds the audience that this is a joke damn it

1096
01:44:37,560 --> 01:44:44,080
leave if you're gonna get butthurt the word i just the word you just used which again it's just a

1097
01:44:44,080 --> 01:44:49,620
virus that has infected our language like a phrase used by just the worst people it's a super

1098
01:44:49,620 --> 01:44:58,440
condescending term extremely you get yeah uh and the audience cheers at that line it cheers uh and

1099
01:44:58,440 --> 01:45:04,960
then she mentions her phrase john friends john snow and darrett dan denaris what is it from game of

1100
01:45:05,940 --> 01:45:12,160
yeah um sexy ladies dance um the show recounting the minute

1101
01:45:12,160 --> 01:45:21,500
uh what's that the guy's even hotter i don't even understand what i wrote um uh sexy about

1102
01:45:21,500 --> 01:45:27,240
the dress the color of the dress yeah there wasn't i don't think there was uh the dress

1103
01:45:27,240 --> 01:45:34,600
in it okay so some sexy ladies dance to most of pour some sugar on me i looked it up in 2017

1104
01:45:34,600 --> 01:45:42,440
that song was 30 years old uh bill and ted appear to rock music then death shows up

1105
01:45:42,440 --> 01:45:49,620
that is a reference to bill and ted finally just yeah but who is it really it is death it is

1106
01:45:49,620 --> 01:45:53,820
it is just death the whole time this is the most shocking reveal of the episode

1107
01:45:53,820 --> 01:46:01,740
uh one of them says that the fear factor stage is a shithole which i thought was pretty funny um

1108
01:46:01,740 --> 01:46:08,740
death is there to drag bill and ted to hell unless he can prove pop culture is worth redeeming

1109
01:46:08,740 --> 01:46:16,500
and uh then someone says the twerk fest is officially open and then someone says

1110
01:46:16,500 --> 01:46:23,520
hey boss baby and then someone says sean spicer and it's spicer again but he's wearing a diaper

1111
01:46:24,760 --> 01:46:32,560
oh why would that uh the twerk fest uh see yeah he says we've got gender neutral outdoor poop

1112
01:46:32,560 --> 01:46:40,060
stations you need a unicorn frappe or unicorn fettuccine alfreight like it's just oh they're

1113
01:46:40,060 --> 01:46:46,620
mad at all that unicorn stuff yeah they're mad at the unicorn stuff and gender neutral things again

1114
01:46:46,660 --> 01:46:53,580
oddly right leaning um the power rangers show up from the remake oh from the family

1117
01:47:10,660 --> 01:47:16,680
centipede yeah which like shark nado is essentially a joke thing to begin with yeah yeah they got it

1118
01:47:16,680 --> 01:47:24,820
they got to stick it to uh eating booty uh let's see what else oh there's a reoccurring video

segment uh where like they play rock guitar and then they say like trump tweets and then

1120
01:47:31,180 --> 01:47:40,020
their trump tweets appear on screen that is nothing like that keeps happening but it's a

1121
01:47:40,020 --> 01:47:46,820
right silly one about the show about like oh he like he's being mean but yeah yeah okay um

1144
01:50:27,940 --> 01:50:32,560
it's not wonder man from the marvel comics it is not wonder i was hoping it was going to be

1145
01:50:32,560 --> 01:50:37,760
yeah it's a wonder woman and then wonder woman does show up and kick his ass yeah

1148
01:50:55,240 --> 01:50:59,740
really into commercials in the billing tech show there's one with a buff like shirtless

1149
01:50:59,740 --> 01:51:06,140
guy from the old spice commercial and the crowd loves it um then below the beautiful ladies of

1150
01:51:06,140 --> 01:51:12,920
wrestling show up and someone says woman up you look like a couple of mcgregors which causes the

1151
01:51:12,920 --> 01:51:21,080
audience to lose their minds so they so we still are in the area of like these women look like

1152
01:51:21,080 --> 01:51:27,500
and these men look like women and that's bad still at the end of this nothing has been learned

1153
01:51:27,500 --> 01:51:33,840
yeah yeah uh then sexy lady i'll just speed up because it's it just starts to be callbacks at

1154
01:51:33,840 --> 01:51:39,080
a certain point uh sexy lady versions of bill and ted show up african-american versions of bill and

1155
01:51:39,080 --> 01:51:44,820
ted show up death shows up holding the it balloon not really acknowledge the avatar person from a

1156
01:51:44,820 --> 01:51:50,120
few years prior shows up and complains about how they have sex with their tails again uh and then

1157
01:51:50,120 --> 01:51:55,140
is that a na vi or is that yes a na vi yeah that is a joke and a few of them that the

1158
01:51:55,140 --> 01:52:00,400
na vi have sex yeah they're they're right digging at the the avatar worlds at disney world yeah

1159
01:52:00,400 --> 01:52:06,800
this they end the last four uh you know orlando ones with uh someone from avatar running in and

1160
01:52:06,800 --> 01:52:10,560
doing like the broadest performance i've ever seen they're dressed in an avatar costume and

1161
01:52:10,560 --> 01:52:15,020
then they have a mickey mouse like cap oh and they're like we they're screaming at the top of

1162
01:52:15,020 --> 01:52:18,700
their lungs we have sex with our tails we have sex with our tails and then they then they always

1163
01:52:19,120 --> 01:52:25,620
say what's the it's like uh avatar land coming in 2095 see now i can get behind that's a solid

1164
01:52:25,620 --> 01:52:30,960
joke because it's open that it did take a long time for that it's like the one perspective the

1165
01:52:30,960 --> 01:52:35,640
bill and ted show has is that yeah that's the one time it took a long time in politics yeah here is

1166
01:52:35,640 --> 01:52:42,080
an upsetting perspective they have uh i believe it's death says united airlines bring him to me

1167
01:52:42,080 --> 01:52:50,780
couple heavies come out and like grab a car rough him up united airline like yikes so uh but then it

1168
01:52:50,780 --> 01:52:57,240
very quickly jumps to someone complaining about how apple released the iphone 8 and the iphone 10

1169
01:52:57,240 --> 01:53:03,360
at the same time and where's the freaking iphone 9 kendall jenner shows up with a pepsi dr evil

1170
01:53:03,360 --> 01:53:09,760
shows up cash me outside is referenced but not the girl is not there uh they have to go back to 1991

1171
01:53:09,760 --> 01:53:14,880
to just go back to live their lives and that's that's kind of how it ends then they do a curtain

1172
01:53:14,880 --> 01:53:21,960
called to jump uh more sexy dancing an edge shearing impersonator death does a little dance

1173
01:53:21,960 --> 01:53:28,820
with david s pumpkins who is not named uh lady gaga there's so much more no no that's it hurry

1174
01:53:28,820 --> 01:53:36,520
up a lady gaga you can't take this anymore a lady gaga impersonator shows up and just does a number

1175
01:53:36,900 --> 01:53:42,800
um yeah and then there's a video there's a farewell montage of video stuff from previous

1176
01:53:42,800 --> 01:53:50,800
shows we are the champions pretty much just taking a victory lap so anyway i am physically tired

1177
01:53:50,800 --> 01:54:01,060
after that uh me too david has the uh the last uh i final straw words anymore i it should have ended

1178
01:54:01,060 --> 01:54:08,260
with just david s pumpkins in a spotlight going any questions and that's it like that would have

1179
01:54:08,260 --> 01:54:16,260
been he should have been the villain he's like the doctor evil of 2017 yeah so all right okay

1180
01:54:16,260 --> 01:54:23,600
this is oh this is awful this is very bad you guys got to you you got to imagine i mean it was still

1181
01:54:23,600 --> 01:54:27,840
going in florida but you were imagining for a little while what it would be like had it still

1182
01:54:27,840 --> 01:54:32,820
going in hollywood i remember i don't like i don't remember a lot from these shows even

1183
01:54:32,820 --> 01:54:36,520
that you were nice enough to have me in them and i had fun being in them i don't like i don't

1184
01:54:36,520 --> 01:54:41,400
remember anything from them because there was like a new thing every 10 seconds so i like that

1185
01:54:41,400 --> 01:54:46,560
accurately like the real universal one it was your show was such a barrage i do remember enjoying

1186
01:54:46,560 --> 01:54:55,980
betsy sudaro as uh the chubaca mom which was real and yeah mike hanford as trump's weird doctor

1187
01:54:56,340 --> 01:55:03,080
singing a duet and finding understanding because they both were in weird photos and got made fun

1188
01:55:03,080 --> 01:55:08,840
of so they fall in love um is there anything else you'd like to name check from your own

1189
01:55:08,840 --> 01:55:15,160
performances um in 2016 we had donald trump ask dirty grandpa to provide his dirt certificate

1190
01:55:15,160 --> 01:55:25,720
we had uh uh there's one uh let me see uh chris christy uh showed up and or oh no it was a

1191
01:55:25,720 --> 01:55:30,720
bill ordered uh postmates and larry willmore was his postmates driver because his show guy can't

1192
01:55:30,720 --> 01:55:35,760
that's like a lazy jothel doing these shows i'm like i do uber now so larry larry willmore drops

1193
01:55:35,760 --> 01:55:40,180
off his food and his food turns out to be the sausage from sausage party and then chris christy

1194
01:55:40,180 --> 01:55:48,720
comes in and eats it uh i think i really liked in 2016 again this was right before the election so

1195
01:55:48,860 --> 01:55:56,440
at the time it seemed like a very funny uh joke uh to to do ironically you had audience member

1196
01:55:56,440 --> 01:56:00,320
there was a box on stage where audience members could write down suggestions of things they wanted

1197
01:56:00,320 --> 01:56:04,820
to see in the show and then when it came time for that moment they just kept looking through and

1198
01:56:04,820 --> 01:56:17,740
said all the cards just said lock her up which was i mean that was that's crazy there was a

1199
01:56:17,860 --> 01:56:22,980
little news people were like not only should this person lose the election they should go to jail

1200
01:56:22,980 --> 01:56:29,800
yeah it's still happening yeah trump's gonna get bored but but you know by 2023 it needs like run

1201
01:56:29,800 --> 01:56:36,820
out of awful things to do it'll like maybe we'll get around to putting hillary in jail yeah but so

1202
01:56:36,820 --> 01:56:43,160
that yeah that's all great and i i think what i'm leading to is that i think we all we're a little

1203
01:56:43,160 --> 01:56:52,460
writers room here i think we owe the audience a take on what if god bless god bless god willing

1204
01:56:52,460 --> 01:57:00,180
that we're still going in orlando how would the bill and ted show be skewering 2018 thanos is the

1205
01:57:00,180 --> 01:57:05,500
villain probably yeah don't you think i was gonna pitch harry kondabalu is the villain

1206
01:57:05,500 --> 01:57:11,740
in the bill of dead show is like mad maybe he teams up with hannah gadsby and they're like

1207
01:57:11,740 --> 01:57:19,600
you guys should fuck up pc police yeah yeah taking or taking a boo away yeah i was gonna say that

1208
01:57:19,600 --> 01:57:28,420
pete davidson is the villain and they uh he has stolen bill and ted's big dick energy

1209
01:57:28,420 --> 01:57:35,020
and they you know what i had an idea but i think it could combine with yours which is there's a

1210
01:57:35,020 --> 01:57:39,840
revit like there's a there's a shadow he comes out in a smoke machine and there's no like you can't

1211
01:57:39,840 --> 01:57:45,440
see his face and bill and ted are like oh no slender man but then he comes into the light and

1212
01:57:45,440 --> 01:57:51,760
it's pete davidson that's great and i and i had another further thought because of course bill

1213
01:57:51,760 --> 01:57:57,660
and ted hallmark you have to incorporate characters from films that are intended to be funny so he so

1214
01:57:57,660 --> 01:58:04,140
he sees the back of the head of a girl with a ponytail and he's like oh sweet ariana come here

1215
01:58:04,140 --> 01:58:09,020
baby and he grabs her and starts to make out with her but it's a puppet from the happy time mergers

1216
01:58:11,300 --> 01:58:16,720
that's great um i i wrote i thought i was worried this would be too dark but then when i found out

1217
01:58:16,720 --> 01:58:22,600
they did the quarry montese the same year it happened uh zombie john mccain does the backpack

1218
01:58:22,600 --> 01:58:32,700
and his arms snap off in the end uh i i had i think i i wanted thanos because i thought there

1219
01:58:32,700 --> 01:58:36,580
would be an opportunity for like to have somebody come out and maybe you know this might be a little

1220
01:58:36,580 --> 01:58:40,920
too inappropriate but you have rose mcgowan come on start talking about the me too movement

1221
01:58:40,920 --> 01:58:47,760
and then thanos just snaps his fingers and she goes away and the audience cheers and all and of

1222
01:58:47,760 --> 01:58:53,700
course they can think that she is dr evil that's a good point i didn't think that's another layer

1223
01:58:53,700 --> 01:58:59,880
so there's room for multiple villains this is this there's a yes and situation a retread of 2004

1224
01:58:59,880 --> 01:59:04,680
where they just where there's like eight villains yeah and you know what let's get let's get the

1225
01:59:04,680 --> 01:59:10,600
terminator in as well yeah get him in there uh i just uh rupert murdoch and mickey mouse kissing

1226
01:59:10,600 --> 01:59:16,940
because of the fox disney manager oh yeah we know what merger really means yeah yeah they're merging

1227
01:59:16,940 --> 01:59:23,620
downstairs uh mister and missus incredible act out uh come out like they're gonna help and then they

1228
01:59:23,620 --> 01:59:30,720
just start acting out who's afraid of virginia wolf scenes oh what a reference yeah i know

1229
01:59:30,880 --> 01:59:37,400
this isn't the show you would write you got to think of what the i know well we're all so our

1230
01:59:37,400 --> 01:59:42,580
brains are all so irony poisons like fair enough they can think they can see a big shadow or big

1231
01:59:42,580 --> 01:59:47,700
shape coming and think that it's the supermoon and then they realize that it's mrs incredible's butt

1232
01:59:47,700 --> 02:00:00,700
oh yeah that made like two film reviewers horny yeah those great reviews yes um sarah huckabee

1233
02:00:00,700 --> 02:00:02,520
sings zendaya is mechi

1234
02:00:02,520 --> 02:00:08,980
it's very important a really crucial thing is that things be rough you can't just do the

1235
02:00:08,980 --> 02:00:14,780
recent past of 2018 you have to go back to you know august and things that no one remembers

1236
02:00:14,780 --> 02:00:20,820
already even though they happened in august which is why i would vote to get i want multiple malissa

1237
02:00:20,820 --> 02:00:25,840
mccarthy's i want her from happy time murders and i want life of the party running around and messing

1238
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:30,660
everything up oh yeah they're hosting the show at the top they're they're getting malissa mccarthy's

1239
02:00:30,660 --> 02:00:36,820
and sean speiser and sean spicer malissa mccarthy ethan hunt dancing to old time rock and roll

1240
02:00:36,820 --> 02:00:46,040
oh for the long time fans yeah um lady gaga uh from a star is born but she's just doing the

1241
02:00:46,040 --> 02:00:54,600
like just doing that one weird part from a very good like a good song but the weird part they put

1242
02:00:54,600 --> 02:01:01,020
in the trailer yeah and then they like they're like get her out of here yeah that's it i don't

1243
02:01:01,020 --> 02:01:08,060
i was gonna say that uh you could also have uh the bradley cooper's character i've not seen the film

1244
02:01:08,060 --> 02:01:13,660
yet but the maybe maybe a runner is they are trying to they need to escape from the clutches of

1245
02:01:13,660 --> 02:01:22,180
of thanos and hannah gadsby uh so because he they are trying to get signed by bradley cooper so that

1246
02:01:22,180 --> 02:01:27,640
their star can be born like they're trying to get wild stallions oh yeah the star is born tree they

1247
02:01:27,640 --> 02:01:35,320
want they want to be on jackson mayne's label uh-huh i'm just realizing this how about instead and

1248
02:01:35,320 --> 02:01:41,180
there's like a misdirect with the fox disney thing that um disney does it gets outbid to buy fox

1249
02:01:41,180 --> 02:01:47,100
and fox is bought by the crazy rich asians oh that's pretty good that's good i like that yeah

1250
02:01:47,520 --> 02:01:52,420
i don't know that i trust the creative team of bill and ted to touch the crazy rich

1251
02:01:52,420 --> 02:01:59,140
concern that will be problematic immediately no i think they have the right take i'm sure they

1252
02:01:59,140 --> 02:02:04,780
have the right touch to make that i've got an idea that is is totally non-problematic which is that

1253
02:02:04,780 --> 02:02:09,240
um the three you know they need to bill and ted need to make some escape they're trying to get

1254
02:02:09,240 --> 02:02:14,300
into their phone booth perhaps to go get to bradley cooper but they can't because the pathway is

1255
02:02:14,300 --> 02:02:22,160
by the four older women of book club who are demanding to suck their dicks they won't get out

1256
02:02:22,160 --> 02:02:27,180
of the way and so and they're like oh older gross get them out of here maybe they start to do it and

1257
02:02:27,180 --> 02:02:31,820
then uh and then they turn they're like the blockers parents what are you doing here the

1258
02:02:31,820 --> 02:02:38,100
blockers parents stop them uh along this line they just have a line uh the pill and ted would

1259
02:02:38,100 --> 02:02:46,320
say in unison the players from game night the players from game night the blockers from blockers

1260
02:02:46,320 --> 02:02:54,000
and uh the players from tag the taggers from tag um actually the blockers being like them also being

1261
02:02:54,000 --> 02:03:00,260
like pc police like trying to stop every sex scene oh yeah they come around at the end they come

1262
02:03:00,260 --> 02:03:08,080
around at the end of bill and they all have sex with each other or with the tag guys yeah all the

1263
02:03:08,080 --> 02:03:18,020
all of the urrs all uh all get and get into a big dog pile yeah um and uh you gotta get big mouth

1264
02:03:18,020 --> 02:03:23,280
in there uh because you always need a character that like is good like the thing that people do

1265
02:03:23,280 --> 02:03:29,840
like so um that was an alt idea i had is that also the the uh speaking about being blocked from

1266
02:03:29,840 --> 02:03:34,660
maybe the maybe big mouth gets a big embarrassing boner and it's too big for bill and ted to get

1267
02:03:35,640 --> 02:03:41,760
into their time like that um they have to wait for it to diffuse but he's he's so horny that

1268
02:03:41,760 --> 02:03:47,980
it won't go away um the infinity stones are stolen from thanos's gauntlet by oceans eight

1269
02:03:47,980 --> 02:03:57,400
that's good yeah yeah um the oh cookout is it cookout kathy is that her name the woman

1270
02:03:57,400 --> 02:04:02,320
who called the police on people grilling in san francisco is just constantly calling the police

1271
02:04:02,320 --> 02:04:09,240
throughout the show and crying yeah oh yeah no that's good they yeah and then and then i think

1272
02:04:09,240 --> 02:04:17,240
maybe the victory at the end maybe they're too late to get signed by jackson jackson made jackson

1273
02:04:17,240 --> 02:04:25,060
maine well or he may have just passed by that as as all star is boards uh i still don't know i don't

1274
02:04:25,060 --> 02:04:29,980
know what happens in stars born don't tell me it's you say it's obvious but i don't know star

1275
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:36,660
the first one was from 1937 they all followed the same you just told us to you spoiled it i'm

1276
02:04:36,660 --> 02:04:41,920
gonna have to put a tag on this i actually don't know what i've never seen you you haven't seen the

1277
02:04:41,920 --> 02:04:50,700
30s stars they made so many of them it's fine i don't know the 30s film uh uh i have one more

1278
02:04:50,700 --> 02:04:56,380
it is happily never mind yeah he signs them oh no i was gonna say maybe there's a reasonable hour

1279
02:04:56,660 --> 02:05:01,420
i was my idea was that there's like some distorted they get in the they get in the machine but they

1280
02:05:01,420 --> 02:05:05,480
end up they were just trying to travel in space they end up traveling at time instead and like

1281
02:05:05,480 --> 02:05:11,060
how do we end up here we're back in 1983 we missed it now we can't get signed but a cool dude named

1282
02:05:11,060 --> 02:05:16,560
brett cavanaugh rolls around and says bill and ted you guys would be perfect new members in my squad

1283
02:05:16,560 --> 02:05:23,260
hey meet squee and tobin and then they party all night long and then brett cavanaugh gets the venom

1284
02:05:26,880 --> 02:05:27,360
symbiote

1285
02:05:27,360 --> 02:05:31,980
you got dennis miller he's gonna write an article for babe.net but he's like guys i need four weeks

1286
02:05:31,980 --> 02:05:41,480
to do it man that is a deep hole wow i don't even get it dennis miller said he was gonna take four

1287
02:05:41,480 --> 02:05:47,240
weeks to say his comments on uh michelle the white house course remember from nine months ago

1288
02:05:47,240 --> 02:05:53,080
the world moves very fast and it's constantly 15 things happen a day the world is moving too fast

1289
02:05:53,080 --> 02:06:00,100
it's always bad so that's where it's why we need this bill and ted show to summarize the year to

1290
02:06:00,100 --> 02:06:05,620
give us perspective yeah because the incredible pace of the new seagull how do we even know what

1291
02:06:05,620 --> 02:06:10,460
the year was and now that bill and ted's gone there's no way of knowing the ideas that we just

1292
02:06:10,460 --> 02:06:14,520
threw out and that was probably what five seven ten minutes that makes up about a minute and a

1293
02:06:14,520 --> 02:06:15,900
half of the show

1294
02:06:15,900 --> 02:06:26,900
we need 50 times those ideas yeah yeah you need like 200 writers minimum of these shows just to

1295
02:06:26,900 --> 02:06:35,020
generate the pure volume the pill and ted show is very much like those like spam pop-up ads of like

1296
02:06:35,020 --> 02:06:41,720
you're not gonna last five minutes playing this game this horny game

1297
02:06:43,020 --> 02:06:49,440
um well you know i would like to say as with many things if you're i think we just proved

1298
02:06:49,440 --> 02:06:55,260
our ability right as writer as bill and ted i think we proved that we could write in bill and

1299
02:06:55,260 --> 02:07:02,400
ted's voice so universal if you want to bring back the show as the facebook group wants we want this

1300
02:07:02,400 --> 02:07:08,840
too we just want like a little bit of an adjustment and i think we're the guys to do it so universal

1301
02:07:08,840 --> 02:07:14,840
you know where we are uh or if you want to switch it to jay and silent bob yeah we're into that

1302
02:07:14,840 --> 02:07:22,260
too the mystery men oh oh yeah now is the time to do the mystery men halloween spooks

1303
02:07:22,260 --> 02:07:26,400
or the show takes place in the house with the clock in the walls

1304
02:07:26,400 --> 02:07:30,340
clocks i don't know how many clocks are in those walls

1305

1307
02:07:50,480 --> 02:07:54,700
a little thing here's a little side for mike and jason we haven't had a guest on in a second and

1308
02:07:54,700 --> 02:08:00,640
since the last time we had a guest on i realized we should not merely ask if they have anything to

1309
02:08:00,640 --> 02:08:07,060
plug we should allow our guests the opportunity to exit through the gift shop oh that's a little

1310
02:08:07,540 --> 02:08:12,540
theme parkification that's been sitting right there that we haven't done so now for the first
