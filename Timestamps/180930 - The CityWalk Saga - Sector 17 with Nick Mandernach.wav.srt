1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Forever...

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Dog!

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
When your town has let you down

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
When your porch has fallen short

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
When you're too worn out to run

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
And need some ribs or a Cinnabon

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
You need a place, a place for rock

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
A place for roll, a place where Oakland Raiders merch is sold

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
A sublime hot topic and billabong

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
A place where you can purchase a candy thong

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
So let's go take a walk

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Let's all go to City Walk

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Tonight, tonight

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Hello, we're cresting the hill, we've almost made it.

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
We're so close to the end of this.

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Joining us today, writer on People of Earth and the upcoming NBC show, I Feel Bad, Nick Mondernock.

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Hey, thanks for having me.

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Hello.

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Thank you for being here.

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm so excited to talk about this sector with you guys.

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I think you got a great one.

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I got a great one.

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
And it's an interesting one because this one is entirely Fallen Brothers.

24
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Yes.

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It's all things that aren't there anymore, including one that was very recently demolished.

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Now, the building of one is still around.

27
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
So there's remnants of all of it, but it's all experiences you can no longer have.

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And we're relying on your memories here today.

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It's a haunted episode.

30
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It's a haunting, haunted episode.

31
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Speaking of haunted.

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Oh!

33
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Oh!

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Boys, boys, boys.

35
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
He's with us.

36
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Hello.

37
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You never know when these start.

38
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It's the sector clipper.

39
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
He's back.

40
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Boys, how are you?

41
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Good.

42
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Wow.

43
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:22,200
You came in and your iconic way of no sound or interesting ghostly way of appearing, we

44
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,000
just turn and you're there.

45
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Yes.

46
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Yes.

47
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
My soul is feeling fulfilled.

48
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Thank you.

49
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
You're at sector 17.

50
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Oh, great.

51
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Yeah.

52
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You're feeling good because we're almost there.

53
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
So many stones have been...

54
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
You give us the stones.

55
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Yes.

56
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I send them USPS because sometimes I can't make it.

57
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You know I have a job, right?

58
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Oh, really?

59
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
You mentioned your job.

60
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I'm still working at the admissions gate in heaven or in hell.

61
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Oh, that's right.

62
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Okay.

63
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,680
But hopefully my skills apply in heaven when you save my soul.

64
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,400
I'm glad you remembered from three days ago because I've been...

65
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,600
Look, the last three days have been a fog.

66
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,600
Of course.

67
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,520
When you escape, are you going to try to get our job at City Walk?

68
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,000
If you'll give me a reference.

69
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Oh, cool.

70
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Oh, yeah.

71
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I can actually...

72
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I do have a connection.

73
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
My older brother used to sell light up swords there at City Walk.

74
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'd love to put...

75
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I can totally look that up.

76
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
No higher praise.

77
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Yeah.

78
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Yeah.

79
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Wow.

80
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
No kidding.

81
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
How long did he hold that down for?

82
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I think...

83
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Again, this is an easy summer.

84
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,720
I think he did this like a summer of it and yeah, you just had like just a bag of those

85
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,720
like neon glow swords.

86
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,000
I think he had a blast.

87
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Excellent.

88
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
You've given me so much strength that being at sector 17.

89
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Banjo-Kazooie.

90
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
White 2K bug.

91
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Oh.

92
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
All these things you missed.

93
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
They're coming to you now.

94
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,520
Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City.

95
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,520
Thank you, boys.

96
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,520
Thank you.

97
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,120
Oh, you're seeing all the pop culture you missed.

98
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,120
Wonderful.

99
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,120
Yes.

100
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,120
You're giving me great strength.

101
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,120
Is it...

102
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,120
And it's give...

103
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,120
You're enjoying it?

104
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,120
It's giving you joy?

105
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,120
Yes.

106
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,120
And it would bring me greater joy.

107
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,120
The sector 17 stone.

108
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,120
Would you like your assignment?

109
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,120
Oh, of course.

110
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,120
Well, yes.

111
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,120
Yes.

112
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:06,000
Give us the places and we'll get you that stone or we'll get it from you rather.

113
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,760
You remember how it works.

114
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,480
Yes, of course we all remember.

115
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,680
Sector 17.

116
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,720
Gibson Amplitheater.

117
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,520
Saddle Ranch.

118
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,520
And Marvel Mania.

119
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,920
And some ghostly phlegm in your throat there.

120
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,320
It's an amphitheater.

121
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,800
I think you put an L in there.

122
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,800
Yes, I was...

123
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,720
Wow, even human flaws are coming back to you.

124
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,720
Yes, it's very nice.

125
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,720
Thank you.

126
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,720
That's why you're becoming so human.

127
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,720
Yeah.

128
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,720
I can't wait to sprain my ankle again.

129
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,320
You wouldn't think that's something you would miss.

130
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,920
No, but you do as a ghost.

131
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,600
You sprained your ankle and that's how you drowned in the fountain.

132
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,600
No, I didn't drown.

133
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,600
I died of a staph infection.

134
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,600
Oh, right.

135
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,600
But it forced you to fall down.

136
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,600
Yes.

137
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,160
I think that's why I was thinking of it.

138
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,080
It forced you to fall down and you were like, you couldn't get up for a while.

139
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,520
So you're exposed to more water than the average child in the fountain.

140
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,520
Yes, you're right.

141
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,520
You're right.

142
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,600
The water filled my lungs inducing the coma.

143
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,600
But boys, boys, let's focus.

144
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,600
Let's focus.

145
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,600
Yeah.

146
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,600
I mean, where do we begin?

147
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,480
I guess, well, let's kick it off with the Gibson amphitheater.

148
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,480
Yeah.

149
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:11,920
So this was the concert venue that was at Universal for many years, I believe, opened

150
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,400
in the 70s.

151
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,840
And it apparently was part of the tour.

152
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:19,620
It was like the slope and the seats.

153
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:22,420
It was outdoors, first of all, to begin with.

154
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:26,060
And it was for stunt shows, I think.

155
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:29,160
But that didn't, you know, those are only used during the day.

156
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:34,400
And supposedly some employee who was probably not compensated properly for the idea was,

157
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,720
he said, why don't we have bands come play at night?

158
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:45,080
And with the kickoff of Jesus Christ Superstar in, I want to say 1972, though I could be

159
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:51,920
wrong, it became one of LA's great concert destinations until it closed down for the

160
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:55,560
Harry Potter experience to be opened up.

161
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:59,400
It's funny, when I started going through it, like, I think by the end, the acts kind of

162
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,680
like whittled down a little bit.

163
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,880
And I was like, so ready to laugh, but they actually had huge like radiohead toward there.

164
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,640
I think they had like they had like some pretty massive acts.

165
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,520
Oh, here's one that I thought was so interesting.

166
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:18,640
The Dalai Lama was really the Dalai Lama came and did like and did like, you know, a talk

167
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,640
or whatever that is.

168
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:24,400
So I love the idea that the Dalai Lama was at City Walk for like a day, a night or so

169
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:29,680
that walking around and were people like scalping tickets.

170
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,840
Who opened for him?

171
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

172
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,880
Right, right.

173
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:40,760
I well, stemming from that, you might have found in the same list is similar area.

174
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:48,600
Pope John Paul II also spoke at the Gibson Amphitheater, at that time, the Universal

175
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,600
Amphitheater.

176
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,920
He was doing a tour of LA and did mass at Dodger Stadium.

177
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,920
Yeah.

178
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:59,720
And he did this special event at the Universal Amphitheater.

179
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:03,960
Really glad I came across this right before we recorded.

180
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:09,800
It was an event where you could be there in person and see the pontiff with your own eyes.

181
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:15,080
But also, this event was simulcast to similar sized venues all across the country in St.

182
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,080
Louis and Denver.

183
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:21,000
And using satellite technology, all these cities were, you know, uplinked and able to

184
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,120
experience the pope all at the same time.

185
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:31,280
And the name of this event was Papal Space Bridge 87.

186
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:36,280
That's one way of describing like internet technology and broadcast.

187
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:41,760
What essentially is a conference call today was regarded as a space bridge.

188
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,760
Space bridge.

189
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:47,720
That's like Thor's Rainbow Bridge that two realms are connected by.

190
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:51,760
Heimdall is the one responsible for guarding.

191
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,760
And space bridge.

192
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,760
That's crazy.

193
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,760
It's such a fun name, too.

194
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:59,560
The Sector Stones will open the space bridge for me to go to heaven.

195
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,560
Oh, my God.

196
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:06,960
Oh, that's what will take you back off of the love radiating from Pope John Paul II,

197
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,240
who's left this mortal coil.

198
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,240
But he's in heaven.

199
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,240
You'll meet him.

200
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,240
He'll be my guide.

201
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,240
Wow.

202
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,800
And you'll be it'll as you cross the bridge, it'll be playing the anthem of city walk,

203
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,800
Gasolina.

204
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:24,840
I believe we established also John Paul II's favorite song.

205
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:29,760
Daddy Yankee will drive me in a golf cart.

206
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,560
There was a part of it.

207
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:36,480
I bet now it's his favorite song, but I bet as of Papal Space Bridge 87, his favorite

208
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:42,120
song was the song played for him on guitar by a man with no arms who played with his

209
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,440
feet.

210
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:48,120
That happened at Papal Space Bridge 87 at the Universal Amphitheater.

211
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:53,920
That happened at Papal Space Bridge 87, but also happened at Hoover School, the elementary

212
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,520
school I went to when in 1993.

213
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,880
Hoover School 93.

214
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,440
Is it the same guitarist?

215
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,440
It had to be.

216
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,440
Right.

217
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,440
There could have been so many.

218
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,440
Maybe he's the space bridge.

219
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,440
Maybe he's really what is uniting us all.

220
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:15,800
His music and his guitar is like Heimdall's sword that unlocks the bridge.

221
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:20,600
So there's hardly any events more special than Papal Space Bridge, but did you guys

222
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,600
get to...

223
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,320
I grew up in LA, so I saw some stuff there and Nick, I imagine you did too.

224
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,720
I'm a Valley kid, so I was there.

225
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,320
I'm actually shocked that I didn't.

226
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,320
I looked through these.

227
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,320
Really?

228
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,200
I was like, how did I miss...

229
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:38,040
All American Reject seems to have been there every other weekend for years.

230
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:41,880
And I loved so many pop punk, which is totally what I was into.

231
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,080
I can't believe I missed that.

232
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,080
Oh, gotcha.

233
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:49,360
I have a friend, my friend Perry's I think snuck backstage and we had a Weezer thing.

234
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,360
Yeah.

235
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,480
And got to land like Meta, like got pictures of it.

236
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,680
It might have been Weezer, Antonacious D touring together possibly.

237
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,760
Yeah, there were great concerts there.

238
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,080
I saw Weezer there.

239
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:04,200
Not on that tour, but on the, when they were touring their famous albums, their classic

240
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,240
albums Blue and Pinkerton.

241
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,840
First night they would do Blue album, second night they would do Pinkerton.

242
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,400
I only went to Pinkerton.

243
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:14,760
I was trying to save money at the time and Pinkerton being my favorite album of theirs.

244
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,760
Oh, gotcha.

245
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:21,480
And it was very, they did half of the new Weezer and then half old Weezer where Rivers

246
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,040
dressed up like he did when he was 22.

247
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,040
And he dressed up.

248
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,040
Oh wow.

249
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,040
So the first, yeah.

250
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:31,480
So Weezer was going through a phase where they had Josh Fries, who was like a famous

251
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:36,480
kind of drummer who played with like everyone from like Nine Inch Nails to I forget, he

252
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,000
was playing with the replacements a couple years ago.

253
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,440
Was he in with like the Queens of the Stone Age world?

254
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,440
Maybe.

255
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,740
Yeah, he's played with everybody.

256
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:45,740
He was playing drums.

257
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,160
They took Pat from Weezer off the drums.

258
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,400
He was playing guitar.

259
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,040
Rivers was not playing any guitar.

260
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:55,360
He was just being a slick front man and he had a trampoline on stage and he would jump

261
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:00,080
up and down and like to the point where you would be like, he's going to, excuse me, he's

262
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,280
going to fall and hurt himself.

263
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:05,920
Like he was like kind of this like guy like very stilted with his arms in the air and

264
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,920
like you're like, what is this?

265
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:09,000
I don't think coordinated when I think of Rurik's call.

266
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,400
I'm not thinking like, yeah.

267
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,760
I saw him do Jimmy Kimmel Live and he had like a ukulele for no reason and he like started

268
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:18,680
smashing it and you're like getting the sense that he's out of control.

269
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:21,880
But the first part of it, he's so he's just on the mic and he played, they played stuff

270
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:25,400
like Suzanne, which is one of the best songs, which is great.

271
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:30,040
And then there was like an intermission and he came out and he was old and now Pat was

272
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,420
back on the drums.

273
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:35,280
He was wearing his like sweater vest again, like he was in the mid nineties and then they

274
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,880
just did Pinkerton all the way through, which was great.

275
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,680
But it was very weird that he played Rivers like cosplay.

276
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:45,080
He played as himself on the show.

277
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:51,160
My theory, I've said this to you, not on the podcast, is that Weezer is our Beach Boys.

278
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:54,840
They're the band like he's going to be, he will dye his hair black.

279
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:59,920
He will be doing the, he will still be wearing sweaters progressively bigger and bigger as

280
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,600
he gains age and weight.

281
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:07,840
We like, we will be, Rivers is not going anywhere until he's 87 years old and they'll start

282
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:11,140
doing, it'll be the Christmas album.

283
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:14,600
We do the, we do Pinkerton again, but with an orchestra.

284
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:19,040
They have like a cruise ship, but like, we're already in a cruise, there's a Weezer cruise

285
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,160
to like, just absolutely light up your point.

286
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:27,240
Like yeah, that's, they're in the, they're in the cruise world.

287
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,480
This is a, here's a bit of Weezer trivia.

288
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,520
I don't know if you know this, you know, they're, they're, they're big hit, they're smash hit

289
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,840
new song, Africa.

290
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:37,880
You know, that the public has embraced so thoroughly.

291
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,400
Africa actually, they didn't write Africa.

292
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:45,880
Africa was this older band called Toto in the eighties and my, and my parents saw them

293
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,200
at the, the Gibson.

294
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,200
Oh really?

295
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:54,480
In, in 82, but one of the first concerts with the enclosed, with the roof.

296
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,480
Right.

297
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,920
Which it was outdoor before.

298
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,600
That was the year it got enclosed.

299
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,600
82.

300
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,600
Yeah.

301
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:06,160
And I'm very jealous of my parents for having seen prime Toto 82 for free apparently.

302
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:11,680
Cause I forgot, I haven't brought this up in any of these sectors yet that my mom worked

303
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,240
at, at universal in the early eighties.

304
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:20,760
She was a, she was an accountant in what was like the big towering black skyscraper there

305
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,760
at the Ted.

306
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,600
That's now like the smallest building on the property.

307
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,840
But yeah, but everybody, everybody went for free.

308
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,840
And they also went to one other concert.

309
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:36,240
I think maybe the first concert my parents saw together at all, possibly while dating

310
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:41,000
was the first concert with a roof, Frank Sinatra.

311
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:47,680
And, and there was a moment that my dad's reminded me of my whole life from this concert

312
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:54,380
where he, Sinatra is setting up a song and he says, all right, there's this one's one

313
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:55,840
of the classics.

314
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,320
This is some real music.

315
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:00,960
You're about to hear not like that Betty Davis.

316
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:12,040
I shit furious, which I developed the theory that maybe he's mad at Kim Karns cause he

317
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,600
like tried to roofie her or something.

318
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:18,360
And then, but she like put a coaster on top of the glass just the time and he didn't get

319
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:23,000
to like a buddy took her away when he wasn't looking like it was like, okay, you gotta

320
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
get out of here.

321
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Save yourself.

322
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,240
And then Frank's camp betrayed him and like, I know things you can't know.

323
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,240
Get out of here, Kim.

324
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:35,560
The first few years of gambling being legal in Atlantic city and Jersey, Frank Sinatra

325
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,400
kind of had the run of the place.

326
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:41,620
Like Steve Wynn, the exclusive contract and stuff.

327
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:44,520
And they would just let him gamble at all hours.

328
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,520
There's a story.

329
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,000
I think that there's a Dean Martin book.

330
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,920
There's a story of the two of them wanting to play cards and like going to the tables

331
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:58,320
in Atlantic city where one of them was doing a residency and demand it.

332
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,280
Like we want the dealer to deal by hand, which is like very illegal.

333
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:09,200
It's why you gotta do the machines and like the dealers like, uh, and the pit bosses like,

334
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,200
oh, it's Frank Sinatra.

335
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,200
You gotta do it.

336
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,840
And he was an asshole about it.

337
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,840
Roommate.

338
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,840
Oh, really?

339
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:18,840
You know him up there?

340
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:22,120
Sinatra is my roommate in hell.

341
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,120
You get him?

342
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,120
Yes.

343
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,760
We, we, we room together.

344
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:30,360
It's weird that he has to share the space, but I guess it's hell and you're being punished.

345
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,200
So, um, has he changed his ways?

346
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:38,720
Is he, uh, no, he's still a son of a bitch.

347
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,480
This is, this is total.

348
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,360
This is absolutely true.

349
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,720
Also in my, my family history.

350
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,760
I don't think I've said this on the podcast before.

351
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:51,600
One of the stranger stories in my family's history, my, uh, grandfather wrote for, um,

352
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:57,040
as you know, modern screen magazine or some like a fifties entertainment magazine.

353
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:02,240
And he wrote something unflattering about Frank Sinatra and Sinatra sent thugs to his

354
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,440
residence to dangle him over a window.

355
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,280
And he said nothing happened.

356
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:11,800
He got, he, he wriggled out of it, but one day he opened the door and Sinatra's guys

357
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,800
were there.

358
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,800
Oh my God.

359
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,800
Yeah.

360
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:19,560
My grandfather, uh, um, and which I've, so I've always thought like if that had gone

361
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:23,240
the other way, maybe my mom isn't born.

362
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,940
Maybe I'm not born.

363
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:28,000
Maybe I'm a lost soul, just like the sector keeper.

364
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,960
If Sinatra had gotten.

365
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:33,080
So you have a, you want to send Frank a message via the sector keeper?

366
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,080
Oh yeah.

367
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,080
Sure.

368
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,080
I can pass it.

369
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,080
Yeah.

370
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:40,080
Now's my whiteboard on her fridge.

371
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,080
Hmm.

372
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,080
What, what?

373
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:46,040
I mean, I, Hey, I guess just, Hey, fuck off chairman.

374
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,600
That should get the job done.

375
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,040
You gotta be careful when there's no more room in hell, the dead will walk the earth.

376
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,040
Oh God.

377
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,040
I'm going to run into him.

378
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:58,960
What if the sector keeper, you wouldn't, I mean, let's cut a deal here.

379
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:03,700
Just please promise you won't like introduce us if I end up in hell and if we don't get

380
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:06,000
you out, I mean, I have every intention of getting you out.

381
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Of course.

382
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,760
If you get all of the sector stones, I won't send the ghost of Frank Sinatra after you.

383
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,760
Oh my God.

384
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:18,960
I think we really have cause to do this right because now my soul is at stake.

385
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:27,160
He's going to get like, I didn't get my, my boys didn't get their hands on your grandpa.

386
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,160
It's Frankie's revenge.

387
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,520
You know what's so funny to me?

388
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,880
I was just like, I was just reading someone like posted like a tweet or something about

389
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,680
like these rap music, we're worshiping these thugs.

390
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,680
It's so funny.

391
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,280
Cause I guarantee you that guy would be like, not like Frank Sinatra.

392
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,280
These days.

393
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:43,080
Frank Sinatra is a man bankrolled by the mob.

394
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,080
Yeah.

395
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,080
By the outfit itself.

396
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,080
What are you talking about?

397
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,080
Like what is your...

398
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:51,320
A man, a man that I heard Donald Trump tell a story that he was horrified by.

399
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,320
Trump was like, yeah, I was hanging out with...

400
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,320
The man with no shame.

401
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,920
He was, I was like, I was hanging out with Sinatra and a man, this is on an old Howard

402
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,920
Stern show.

403
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:59,920
He goes, yeah.

404
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,760
And a guy, we were in Vegas and a guy came up to him and was like, Mr. Sinatra, I just

405
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,520
got married to your music.

406
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:07,080
We danced to your music as the first, like the first song.

407
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,840
And Sinatra goes, get him boys.

408
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:13,520
And he just had the shit kicked out of the sky.

409
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,200
And Trump, and Trump is telling a story.

410
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,200
Trump's like, yeah.

411
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,280
Like you can tell Trump is put off by this.

412
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,080
One of the most terrible men.

413
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,080
Vile.

414
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:25,080
Vile man is like, that guy was a little crazy, huh?

415
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,840
Oh my God.

416
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,480
Sector keeper, has he hurt you?

417
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,480
Boys, boys.

418
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,480
No, no, no.

419
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,480
That means yes.

420
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:38,360
Tell me about the Gibson.

421
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:41,840
I think that sticks out in my mind.

422
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:47,760
And I don't think I went to this, but this was where Conan, when Conan did his live tour

423
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,280
before he had his TBS show.

424
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:54,320
But after the Tonight Show, he played the Gibson amphitheater, which is spitting distance

425
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,680
from the sound stage built for him to host the Tonight Show.

426
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:05,160
So like it's probably his first time back on universal property and he is doing like

427
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:12,280
a sold, like a packed show, like around the corner from where he had just been fired.

428
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,280
Zucker is clenching his fists.

429
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,280
How dare he?

430
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,160
I thought I exiled him.

431
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:22,120
He was banished and now he's spitting on my very turf.

432
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,120
Yeah.

433
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:28,680
Jeff Zucker, who now is at CNN and Trump is like, shit and all.

434
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,200
He's calling him like little Jeff.

435
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,200
Right.

436
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,920
He's getting, he's getting the Trump business.

437
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:38,480
So in this case, I as little Jeff or little, little, little, he was using the D's.

438
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,520
Oh, he was calling him little.

439
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,520
What's his name?

440
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,520
Corker.

441
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,520
Oh, really?

442
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,520
Right.

443
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,520
He was using condescending.

444
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,520
He wasn't just writing little.

445
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:49,600
He would write LIDD like, wasn't a Bob Corker he was goofing on.

446
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,360
Oh, maybe he was like little Bob Corker.

447
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,360
He was calling him.

448
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,360
I'll find it.

449
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,360
That's so confusing.

450
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,560
Wasn't it little like, wasn't like Marco Rubio?

451
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,560
Yeah.

452
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:01,800
He's the same.

453
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,800
What the?

454
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,520
He's gone out of really great.

455
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,520
Conan.

456
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,520
Oh yeah.

457
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,520
There you go.

458
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,520
He just cycles through.

459
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:18,440
If he ever decides to have like a punch up room of name generators, though I don't support

460
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,440
the man.

461
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,440
That'd be a fun gig.

462
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,440
Yeah.

463
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,840
If you could think of mean names.

464
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,560
It's you and Dennis Miller and Dan Manin.

465
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:31,360
The millennial, the millennial comedian.

466
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,320
Yeah, Gavin Mcginnis.

467
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:37,080
The old from a Fred boys.

468
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:44,000
Oh, the Gibson was also the home for a long time of the MTV movie.

469
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,920
Was it the movie awards and the Teen Choice Awards?

470
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,920
Mm hmm.

471
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:52,480
This is famously, we've mentioned him before, Sasha Baron Cohen.

472
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,320
His friend Bruno was there.

473
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:59,960
His associate Bruno fell on Eminem.

474
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:03,360
Oh, the second mention of this on our podcast.

475
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,760
That's where that famous accident occurred.

476
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,120
That famous accident.

477
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,120
Yes.

478
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,560
The butt to face, wasn't it?

479
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,560
Wasn't it like.

480
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,560
Yes.

481
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,560
Yes.

482
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,560
And all of D12 got mad and left.

483
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,560
All of D12.

484
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:17,880
In a totally spontaneous moment.

485
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,360
Headed for the Purple Hills.

486
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,960
Jason, did you ever see a concert at Gibson?

487
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,960
No, never.

488
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:24,960
I never was.

489
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,160
Never saw it at the MTV.

490
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:32,560
Real brief, the only other thing I saw there, a free concert that I, well it wasn't free,

491
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:35,520
I saw it for free, put on by The Shins.

492
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,560
Hey, second Shins mention.

493
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,560
Another return.

494
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,560
Oh, that's funny.

495
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,640
We talked about the Garden State earlier.

496
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:46,560
Oh, wait, the Sector Keeper, Sector Keeper, you should listen to this band, they're called

497
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,560
The Shins, they change your life, I swear.

498
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,560
The Shins?

499
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,560
The Shins.

500
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,560
Do you remember?

501
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:54,400
Yeah, do you remember how body parts work?

502
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,880
That's a thing you could injure, you could twist your shin.

503
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:01,960
It's also the name of a band, and they are so good that they could change your life,

504
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,960
I swear.

505
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:03,960
Oh, excellent.

506
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:04,960
I'll check them out when I ascend to heaven.

507
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,560
When you get all your memories back.

508
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,560
Thank you.

509
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,320
I think they'll give you strength.

510
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:15,480
The other things I saw there, in 2005 I saw Beck Two Nights in a Row, a Guero tour, that

511
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,480
was fantastic.

512
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,480
Oh, sure.

513
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:21,000
And my dad dragged me to a concert in 1998 that I was all harumphy about, and probably

514
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,480
like a real jerk during it.

515
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:28,920
Like, I have to go with my dad, this lame concert instead of the rap I like, instead

516
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,720
of Busta Rhymes.

517
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:35,960
And this concert that I frowned and crossed my arms through the whole time in 1998 was

518
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:38,160
Chicago and Hall & Oates.

519
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,160
Oh my God.

520
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,160
Wow.

521
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,720
This is my exact wheelhouse today.

522
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,760
I've seen both of them multiple times.

523
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,720
I made a video with Chicago.

524
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:48,720
Wow.

525
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:54,600
I'm bored and mad in a Chicago concert in 1998, and then how many years later?

526
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:59,000
Thirteen years later, I did a video with the band for Funny or Die, and I got to say,

527
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,840
hey, Chicago, meet my dad.

528
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:01,840
Oh, great.

529
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:02,840
Yeah.

530
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:03,840
Wow.

531
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,840
That's awesome.

532
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,840
That's how many years after the fact.

533
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:09,200
I feel like that made up for what a little jerk ass I was, but I'd love to see that

534
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,200
concert.

535
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,200
I have a Chicago story.

536
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,200
Why?

537
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,200
Now we're talking.

538
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,720
The Toronto player from Chicago went to my church, and I used to basically like-

539
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,720
Wait, can I name it?

540
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,720
Can I name it Trumpet is Pankow?

541
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,720
That might, that might, I literally do not remember.

542
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,720
You were in school, Nick Pascot.

543
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,720
Scott fucking taking me to task.

544
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,720
This is my dream.

545
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,720
What was it, Perizator, Loftney, or Pankow?

546
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,720
Pankow.

547
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,720
Let's go Pankow.

548
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,720
I only, I learned their names because I had to block them.

549
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,720
Oh yeah.

550
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:40,480
I had to arrange them in as it was very, it's very hard to move eight people around.

551
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:45,120
But what happened, I was playing, I did like half ass trumpet through, through middle school

552
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,120
and high school.

553
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:51,200
I would just like pretend to play a lot of the time because it hurt my teeth.

554
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:56,040
And I played, I did play at the church and it became clear that my mom had like, was

555
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:59,320
friends with the, or like talked to the trumpet player and wanted him to come and encourage

556
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,720
me to continue to play.

557
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,600
So he, so I played, but I blew it.

558
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,440
I mean, I could, I forgot the solo.

559
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,240
I just like, I like, I like fucked up.

560
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,600
I was like, my armchair was all fucked up.

561
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,040
It was like, like it was all, so he came up after us.

562
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:15,080
He's like, and clearly like wanting to like support me, but knowing that it would never

563
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:18,120
happen and he just was kind of dancing around and like playing trumpet.

564
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,120
All right.

565
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,120
Wow.

566
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,120
Nice.

567
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,120
But he had nowhere to go.

568
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,120
They didn't know.

569
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:27,040
Just honestly, it is the most honest thing, but it was just him like clearly like being

570
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:30,880
asked to bolster me and not being able to in good faith.

571
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,880
Oh my God.

572
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,320
It sounds like he didn't like force a compliment.

573
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,560
No, he didn't force a compliment again.

574
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:39,000
And I respect, this is a, this is a story of respect.

575
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,560
We just like, yeah, all right.

576
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,000
But there's nothing else to say.

577
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,520
Like what else could you talk about?

578
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:47,040
So it was just, I just had an awkward like three minutes of him just going like, right

579
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,040
on.

580
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,040
Whoa.

581
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:52,160
I think it, I think it's Loftney, this blonde guy.

582
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,160
Yes.

583
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,160
Yes.

584
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,160
That's it.

585
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,160
Lee Loftney.

586
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,600
He was one of the nicest guys in the shoot.

587
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,320
They were all very nice, but those horn guys, especially, and you're like, wow, I can't

588
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,320
believe you guys are here.

589
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,320
You guys are legends.

590
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,920
Hey, it's been a crazy ride.

591
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:11,840
That kind of just wasn't, it was, I honestly, I'm so, my Chicago day was very special to

592
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,840
me.

593
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,920
I feel like mine went, went better than yours.

594
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:15,920
Yeah, definitely.

595
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:19,600
But no, but I, you know something, even at the time I was like, this is the right thing

596
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,600
to do.

597
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:24,680
You should not, do not, do not encourage my talent, my lack of talent.

598
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,680
Don't do it.

599
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,680
Yeah.

600
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:30,040
He say, well, yeah, if you, I, and you know, you're a, you're a working successful comedy

601
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:39,180
writer now as opposed to a, like a twice divorced trumpeter in a, in like a garage ska band

602
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:41,960
or something.

603
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,720
Just failing out.

604
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,720
Yeah.

605
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,720
Well, congrats.

606
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,080
You, you made it out of that alive.

607
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,080
Yes.

608
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,960
Any other memories of the amphitheater?

609
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:58,200
Oh, you know, we mentioned this because it was replaced by Harry Potter and I think some

610
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,640
of the foundation stayed.

611
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,960
I think they kept some of the infrastructure of the building.

612
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,960
Right.

613
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,640
I'm not totally sure, but you know, I said this in the Harry Potter episode, but I think

614
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,400
it's a shame that they had to tear down the place where the greatest album of all time

615
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,440
was recorded, the blues brothers briefcase full of blues.

616
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:18,800
I feel like it should stay up as a historic monument.

617
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:22,520
And so I'm, I'm mad at the Harry Potter ride.

618
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:26,760
I go on it, but I, I shout, what about the blues brothers?

619
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:32,040
Oh, and also the, the last, the last blues brothers concert was there.

620
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,040
Oh, right.

621
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,040
It's every year's later.

622
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,040
Yeah.

623
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:40,320
So blues heads, a lot of history here.

624
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:44,320
Should I maybe keep talking about the blues brothers for way longer?

625
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,320
Okay.

626
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:53,680
Why don't we continue the music discussion though and jump on over to saddle ranch.

627
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:56,480
Yes, please boys.

628
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,480
Saddle ranch.

629
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:03,000
I mean, saddle ranch was the final restaurant occupying this space, but certainly not the

630
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
first.

631
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,060
No, this is a very exciting area.

632
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:10,600
Now the building is gone entirely and I'm not sure why and I don't know what's going

633
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,600
in there.

634
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,880
Well, I know the rumors about it.

635
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,880
Oh really?

636
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,320
Do you have anything you can say?

637
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,320
Sure.

638
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,560
But there's a message board rumors that the tooth some chocolate factory is going right

639
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:25,320
where the saddle ranch, the giant rip off Willy Wonka dessert restaurant that's in Orlando

640
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:28,080
already might be going where saddle ranch is.

641
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:33,680
Very popular chocolate, chocolate emporium and also like savory, savory treats.

642
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,840
There are sweets and savory.

643
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:36,840
Anything you would want.

644
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:37,840
Yeah.

645
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,120
The whole thing smells like chocolate.

646
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:47,560
So when you order a plate of mozzarella sticks or wanton nachos or something, you will not

647
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:50,000
stop smelling that chocolate odor.

648
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Yeah.

649
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,360
So just like, I like that they're keeping up the tradition of that space, which is just

650
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,600
quick closures.

651
00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:03,040
Just like, just, just, just a, you're spending millions of dollars creating a brief anecdote.

652
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:07,040
It heads up to being mentioned on a podcast briefly.

653
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,040
Okay.

654
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,600
So I have a full list here.

655
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:17,040
Uh, uh, it, when it initially opened, it was called a Whompomper's wagon works restaurant.

656
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:20,240
That was, and the backstory of this, do you know the backstory?

657
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:28,440
Yeah, it was about a flim flam man who, uh, uh, found a good, a good, uh, line that's

658
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:33,560
selling people wagon pieces and build a giant factory on top of this hill at the Cuyenga

659
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,960
pass.

660
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,040
And now they had converted it to a restaurant.

661
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:42,360
This way I didn't, I just copy and pasted the bio and hadn't read it till right now.

662
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:45,240
My, my little thing says CL Whompomper.

663
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:48,040
I was going to ask what the name was.

664
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:55,280
CL Whompomper, a legendary slick talking wagon salesman who invented wheeling and dealing.

665
00:28:55,280 --> 00:29:00,560
This character invented the general notion of wheeling and deal while dealing.

666
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,560
Great grandfather.

667
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:06,280
You have so many connections to this place.

668
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,280
Wow.

669
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,280
Yes.

670
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:11,280
He, I, I'm with him right now.

671
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,280
Yes.

672
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:19,880
I'm so proud of the, uh, he was an entrepreneur in this chocolate place is piss on his grave.

673
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:26,160
So you want him like remembered and I want him honored.

674
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,160
Yeah.

675
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,160
Yes.

676
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,160
Yes.

677
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,160
Boys boys.

678
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:33,720
Promise me one day you'll reopen the Whompomper.

679
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,720
Promise.

680
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,600
You were quick to make that promise.

681
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,600
Okay.

682
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,600
You can do it.

683
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,600
Yeah, I can do it.

684
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:46,520
I mean, there's an old saying in LA, you know, when the Piz that if you want an easy go of

685
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:54,160
it for a little while, try to open a restaurant now.

686
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,000
I feel like CL Whompomper.

687
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Am I getting the name right?

688
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
It's actually it's Hopper.

689
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Well, Hopper, excuse me.

690
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Excuse me.

691
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Yeah.

692
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Whomp Hopper.

693
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
CL Whomp Hopper.

694
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:08,120
I feel like he probably is related to like other deceased characters from different,

695
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:14,240
you know, shopping and dining experience, centers like Merryweather Pleasure or even

696
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:18,960
TGI Friday, TGI Friday or even just because I want to say the name Marvel McFay from Astral

697
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:19,960
World.

698
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:20,960
Yeah.

699
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:21,960
Yeah.

700
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:22,960
Yeah.

701
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,800
And do you find are you looking at a photo of him from somewhere?

702
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,080
Because there are photos of him.

703
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,080
I'm bringing him up.

704
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,080
I have not seen the photo.

705
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,440
I'll do it all the time.

706
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:33,960
You're right on the money because would you believe that he is a bearded man in a top

707
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:34,960
hat?

708
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:35,960
Of course I believe that.

709
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,680
Which is this him?

710
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,680
Yeah.

711
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:41,120
And who else does he remind you of?

712
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,120
Imagine you're Joe Roady.

713
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:47,960
Are you going to say Stan Lee from the Marvel medium?

714
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:48,960
I'm still not.

715
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:49,960
You're all wrong.

716
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:53,800
The original top hat, old timey beardo in theme park.

717
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,000
Yeah.

718
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:01,400
And when this restaurant opened, who was hired to play CL Whomp Hopper?

719
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:05,840
But Ron Schneider, the original actor who played Dream Finder.

720
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:06,840
Wow.

721
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,320
Literally the same man.

722
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,320
Wow.

723
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,320
He's just playing him.

724
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:14,600
He isn't CL Whomp Hopper who obviously was a real man who you the sector keeper.

725
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,600
Yes.

726
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,600
But he did him justice.

727
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,600
Oh, that's good.

728
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,600
So he did him justice.

729
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,600
He played him well.

730
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,240
His portrayal was not piss on the grave.

731
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,240
No.

732
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:26,760
Here's a photo of Ron Schneider that also came up in the search results.

733
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:29,320
He's holding Figment the Dream Finder.

734
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,040
He's a whimsical guy.

735
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,040
Wow.

736
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:36,240
So yeah, I really wish I could have experienced this place.

737
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,680
A restaurant with a plot, obviously, always up my alley.

738
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:45,920
Aesthetically, like it's this like fake rusted out tin shack, but then you go in there and

739
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,840
it's nine rooms.

740
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:48,840
It's huge.

741
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:49,840
It's so massive.

742
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:50,840
It's so big.

743
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:57,640
Also, they made a point of using reclaimed barn wood to construct it, I read, and corrugated

744
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:00,200
tin roofs just like back in the day.

745
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,200
I'm looking at the picture.

746
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,200
I love a shack.

747
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:06,160
And it looks like they're tin roofs, but the roof is made to look like it's wood.

748
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,160
Right?

749
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,160
Am I wrong?

750
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:11,160
Like that's what I'm getting from the mixed materials.

751
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,160
Yeah, mixed materials.

752
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:19,200
But then you go inside and it's brass and it's bricks and it's dull 80s Browns and Tiffany

753
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:23,000
lamps and all the stained glass, all the shit I love to swim in.

754
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
It's beautiful.

755
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
It is amazing.

756
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,360
It's like if you were watching the movie version of Hello Dolly and just ran face first into

757
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,360
the TV screen.

758
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:34,200
That's what Whomper's Wagon Works looks like.

759
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,440
And so that lasted 81 to 86.

760
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,440
Then it became Whomps.

761
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,440
It's such a game.

762
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,440
Whomps restaurant.

763
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:44,440
I like how Hooters tried to become Hoots.

764
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:47,440
Whompers became Whomps.

765
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,600
Whomps lasted 86 to 88.

766
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:58,320
And then it got taken over by an old friend of ours, Tony Romas in 1988 to 1995.

767
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:03,080
As we said, one of the only establishments to make the city walk jump, to be put in a

768
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,320
different location.

769
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,480
This one's the one in my heart.

770
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,280
We were finally recalling it with Eva.

771
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:14,480
Yeah, that's my Tony Romas.

772
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,960
Did you ever make it to that one?

773
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:19,680
Or do you have like a first Universal Studios memory?

774
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:23,780
I definitely remember like Hard Rock was, I remember being young enough to be impressed

775
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:26,600
by the Hard Rock Cafe.

776
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:30,000
I was floored by that.

777
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,440
So that was probably my memory, like they've got all this memory.

778
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,440
Holy cow.

779
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:39,160
I also remember a big thing that my friends and I would do because we were in high school,

780
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:43,680
but like we didn't like like Rap Rock is we would go to BB King's House of Blues, but

781
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,920
to hear the music.

782
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:48,720
So we'd go there and there's like, I think we had like a substitute teacher who played

783
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,760
harmonica there and we fucking idolized him.

784
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,400
We thought it was so fucking cool.

785
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,880
We would go there.

786
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:57,120
We did see like the Scottlights played there, which was like fun.

787
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,440
We would often be at BB King's House of Blues.

788
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,440
Wow.

789
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:05,680
That's funny because we've covered that one and I don't, yeah, I don't even think of any

790
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:09,000
as I don't even think of it as a place anyone would have gone to.

791
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Right.

792
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Yeah, definitely.

793
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
But we were those kids.

794
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
You know what I mean?

795
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
We kind of appreciated good music.

796
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,040
Oh, so you must have gone to that baked potato down at the bottom of the hall.

797
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

798
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,040
We got bad expensive baked potato.

799
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:22,040
I mean, that place is so fucking expensive though.

800
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,040
I mean, it is.

801
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,040
The club, the baked potato.

802
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,040
I don't know anything about it.

803
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,040
I know it's reputation.

804
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:31,320
Yeah, it's it's it's at the base of the hill off of the Coenca Pass.

805
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,600
Right near by jazz place.

806
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:36,120
Yeah, but I think it's like there's like I mean, maybe this is I was in high school

807
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:39,440
and maybe the entry fee was even three dollars, which seemed prohibitive to me.

808
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,840
But I remember it seemed really expensive.

809
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:47,040
But we would also go to there's a place Charlie O's, which is again now a fallen brother in

810
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,040
the in the valley.

811
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,040
We would we would go there.

812
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,760
But there was actually like a time where there was like a pretty good amount of like jazz

813
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,560
and you know, if you were.

814
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,560
Yeah.

815
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:59,680
You were like you were a high school jazz jazz cat.

816
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:03,840
You were consciously very consciously like a Ryan Gosling, Lala Link.

817
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:04,840
Yes, exactly.

818
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:07,840
And that would be problematic.

819
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:10,520
Like, stop, like stop.

820
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:13,520
Stay away from the right at the time.

821
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,520
All right.

822
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:18,040
So they gave you your your your jazz fix and gave us our jazz fix.

823
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,040
That's nice over there.

824
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,040
Totally.

825
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:24,720
And yeah, this this Rome is also, I found, like aesthetically perfect.

826
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:31,160
Well, they kept a lot of the original building, but then there was also some Roman columns,

827
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,160
right?

828
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,160
Yeah.

829
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:34,160
It's like weird.

830
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:37,520
There's it's like two styles mushed together.

831
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:41,800
It somehow looks smaller than Whompomper's, but I don't think that's right.

832
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,800
Whomp hoppers.

833
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,800
Whomp hoppers.

834
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:50,000
This is the photo of that restaurant is something I would like just stare at for a full 16 years

835
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,640
and 60 seconds just to like take me back to that time.

836
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:59,480
And it reminds me of how like it's the kind of it's a lot like I took a trip to a mall

837
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:05,040
and to outside of Toronto where Mean Girls was shot like any of the mall scenes and Mean

838
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,040
Girls.

839
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:11,480
And I it's so locked in time, like perfect of the of this dull late 80s aesthetic.

840
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:16,680
And I showed right after I've been our friend Danny Jelinek, I showed photos of this mall

841
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:20,680
and he was I showed him like four or five and he was like, I don't know what you're

842
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:21,680
showing me.

843
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:26,440
I don't know why these are photographs worth being read display.

844
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:30,880
Like I don't know what you're seeing and I don't blame him.

845
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:31,880
I don't.

846
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:36,440
But do you do you know what I'm with this photo, that logo, that sign?

847
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:39,280
Well, you're you you actually went to this place.

848
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,280
I did.

849
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,280
So that's another element.

850
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,280
It's my Schomburg.

851
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:46,240
But what I this is I think what you're actually describing is what I was talking about on

852
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:49,280
the Pleasure Island episode where I was reading through people's memories and looking at their

853
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,320
photos of it.

854
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,760
I have obviously some memories of Pleasure Island, too, but I didn't live my teenage

855
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,260
years there or my early 20s there.

856
00:36:56,260 --> 00:37:02,040
But by the end of it, I had this deep nostalgia for a place that I never was.

857
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:07,200
Yeah, I thought I was living the this youth that these people had had and they were also

858
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,200
like they loved it.

859
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:11,160
And you can feel it with reading the writing and looking at the photos.

860
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:13,040
So it's like the same thing.

861
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,400
What you're describing, I think it's similar.

862
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:18,480
There's a similar thing of like it reminds you of a place and it's like it's probably

863
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:22,280
really just like remembering being a kid or like it's really all that.

864
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:28,040
Though I bet there was less of a culture surrounding the Tony Romus if I had to guess.

865
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,320
But Pleasure Island seems like it had a big culture.

866
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:34,280
All that like the knots and Disney dance clubs seemed like they had it.

867
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:37,600
And people like the other these Facebook groups are crucial for everybody, like pooling their

868
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:41,760
memories and there's real community in these theme park places.

869
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,840
You're mentioning this is a quick Universal Studios, but off of movies.

870
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:49,880
But I remember this this time I was in middle school and we went to the the movie theater,

871
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:52,480
like the the Universal, like the AMC there or whatever.

872
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:57,120
This is one of the first times I went like I was I don't know me like like 13 or something

873
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,120
like that.

874
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,120
We wanted the group.

875
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:03,600
My crush, Ariel Fortune sat next to me and I was so floored and I was so fucking nervous

876
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,600
that she sat next to me.

877
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,960
So you would say Fortune favored you that night.

878
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:16,000
Nothing, nothing from the you make me weak.

879
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Fortune favored me.

880
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Airport is set next to me.

881
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,640
I got a large like like Mr. Pibb or something like that or like Dr. Fever or whatever.

882
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,160
I put it in my seat before the movie starts.

883
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,160
Ariel turns to me.

884
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,440
She goes, oh, like, can I have some of your soda?

885
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,600
And I just panic and I just go, it's empty.

886
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,880
But it wasn't empty.

887
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:32,880
It was completely full.

888
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:33,880
It was completely full.

889
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:36,160
And so I just didn't touch it the entire.

890
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,160
I don't know why I panicked.

891
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,160
I just said no.

892
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,880
I don't know what I thought was going to happen.

893
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:44,040
But yeah, then at the end of the end of the she watched me as I picked up a clearly a

894
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:48,360
full through it entirely away.

895
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,960
Nick, that's actually a very alpha move.

896
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,000
And you're really good.

897
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,400
You're really going to turn that into something.

898
00:38:55,400 --> 00:39:02,280
If I just if I'm not like lied, just bizarrely lied and denied both of us, but I just said

899
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,280
no.

900
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,280
Oh, man.

901
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:07,720
You could have you could have been married with Ariel.

902
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:08,720
For a fortune.

903
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:09,720
Yeah.

904
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:10,720
In an alternate universe.

905
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:13,720
You married Ariel Fortune.

906
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,360
Tour in the country in.

907
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,360
Yeah.

908
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:18,160
Low rent trumpet clubs.

909
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:23,440
That's tempted by trumpet heads left and right.

910
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,440
Trumpet groupies.

911
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,440
Please.

912
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,440
I can't.

913
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,440
I've Ariel at home.

914
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,440
Yeah.

915
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,440
You're you're just in Chicago.

916
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,440
Yeah.

917
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,720
Look, I know I'm a passable at the right.

918
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,680
Actually, I got her once I come home.

919
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:37,680
I'm just a little quieter.

920
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:38,680
How was your trip?

921
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:39,680
Good.

922
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:40,680
Yeah, it was good.

923
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:45,680
I'm not going to write home about it.

924
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:48,680
You're selfish to tell her.

925
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:52,080
It's like you're on the road.

926
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:55,080
That's the road.

927
00:39:55,080 --> 00:40:01,640
It's like a drama playing out with your other life.

928
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:05,720
Well, you know, what wasn't in the cards for you with with your trumpet career was being

929
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,200
a country star.

930
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,120
Country star.

931
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:12,680
Probably the most interesting in my mind.

932
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:15,640
What do you know about country star?

933
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:21,360
So country star and and we alluded to this very early on in this series.

934
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:27,520
Country star was the attempt to make a Planet Hollywood ask Hard Rock Cafe ask restaurant

935
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:34,000
solely focused on country music, which is very funny because at the same time there

936
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,120
is Red Cross from it, which we'll get to later.

937
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:42,360
The Marvel Mania restaurant, which was an attempt to make a hard rock ask a restaurant

938
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:45,080
based on the Marvel Comics properties.

939
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:48,600
Country star was owned by a number of famous country musicians.

940
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:49,600
Does someone have the list?

941
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,600
I do right here.

942
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,600
Yeah.

943
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:55,680
Country music superstars, including Vince Gill, Winona Judd, Reba McIntyre and TV hosts

944
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,600
Lorraine Crook and Charlie Chase.

945
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:02,080
I know all of them.

946
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,080
You do.

947
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:05,680
So that's before you were.

948
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:06,680
Yes.

949
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:07,680
Oh, OK.

950
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:11,880
They were so long putting the clues together, Michael.

951
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:12,880
Thank you.

952
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:13,880
You know what?

953
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,160
You you've you know, Garth Brooks, right?

954
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:18,720
Oh, well, yeah, he was before you're in Chris Gaines.

955
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:19,720
Oh, you do.

956
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,880
I did get to experience Chris Gaines.

957
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:22,880
Oh, OK.

958
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:23,880
You went you went back the other way.

959
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:26,880
I taught him as Garth Brooks.

960
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:27,880
Chris Gaines.

961
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:32,440
I would like if in a little wing of the country star cafe, there was like the Chris Gaines

962
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,760
Blue Room.

963
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,760
It's a little like sad.

964
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:40,480
You have to request that ahead of time on your reservation.

965
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,480
Country started me.

966
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:45,240
The outside of the building is nearly not.

967
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:50,000
It's unrecognizable because they built giant facades that look like jukeboxes in front

968
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,200
of it, which I don't necessarily associate with country music.

969
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,200
Yeah.

970
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,760
Like do that might be like kind of more like a giant.

971
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:02,440
It is like, yeah, Johnny Rockets, American graffiti, like the the fifties that didn't

972
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:06,240
really exist, but we imagine in our imagination it did.

973
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,240
They on a roadhouse.

974
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:08,640
They probably had a jukebox, though.

975
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:09,640
I guess that's true.

976
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:16,320
But like you said, the old the the Wop Hopper Hopper Wop Hopper looks like it could be country

977
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,320
star.

978
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:20,680
Yeah, like that actually looks more probably like what you would think they went.

979
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:25,200
They went backwards and not to jump ahead, but then they removed the jukeboxes for Saddle

980
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:28,000
Ranch and it just went back to being a rusted out shack.

981
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,760
So what was the point of this?

982
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:30,760
It's weird.

983
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:32,240
I wish this.

984
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:36,840
I wish I went to this because I don't know if you have this over on your thing.

985
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:39,760
They had a menu that's fantastic.

986
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,000
They don't have the full one here.

987
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:47,140
But for instance, you could get Reba McIntyre's garden vegetable pasta or what known as Hickory

988
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:48,600
smoked chicken.

989
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:54,600
Very clever name or the Vince Gill cheeseburger.

990
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:55,920
You know, like that.

991
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,800
That is what I want from one of these restaurants.

992
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:02,040
Clever sounding cheeseburger names will come up again on this episode.

993
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:03,040
Oh, yeah.

994
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,040
Last hour.

995
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:06,400
I think Hard Rock seems to have less of that.

996
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:10,800
I think they used a little more, but you don't get like the Joe Perry macaroni or something.

997
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:11,880
But that's what I want.

998
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,280
I want everything named.

999
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:14,440
There's a few I think.

1000
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:17,720
Every now and then I feel like they have a seasonal menu.

1001
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:22,480
Like that's the quarterly menu or something where it's just like pit bull spicy chicken

1002
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:23,480
wings.

1003
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:24,480
What is the rest?

1004
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:25,480
There was a restaurant.

1005
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:30,480
Mr. Worldwide's wide mouth club.

1006
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:35,520
Oh man.

1007
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:38,880
I want to have that now.

1008
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,360
That's one of my great theme burger.

1009
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:44,680
That's when I was in Orlando last year is not buying the limited edition pit bull Mr.

1010
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:49,040
Worldwide t shirt that was only being sold at Hard Rock, Orlando.

1011
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:57,080
Did you say have you seen the video classic comedy clip of Pitbull and Jimmy Fallon playing

1012
00:43:57,080 --> 00:44:03,360
giant beer pong while the while the Sims outside of Moe's while all the Simpsons characters

1013
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:09,960
including the Simpsons and Sideshow Bob standing next to each other all cheer him on and it

1014
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:15,600
opens at this great little like skit in the in Moe's like you're Mr. Worldwide, huh?

1015
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:17,760
Well I bet you can't do beer pong though.

1016
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,000
No, that's where you're wrong.

1017
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
All right, let's do it.

1018
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,920
It's the most mumbled sketch I've ever seen.

1019
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:30,560
I know we still have a year plus left, but I feel like that's going to be the most representative

1020
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:33,560
piece of 2010s culture.

1021
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:42,440
Jimmy Fallon playing giant beer pong while the silent cast of the Simpsons raise their

1022
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:43,440
arms.

1023
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:44,440
Yeah, raise their.

1024
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:46,480
Well, Gil the salesman.

1025
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:52,600
Gil the salesman became president.

1026
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:57,580
At this country star they have they would have like the outfits worn by your favorite

1027
00:44:57,580 --> 00:44:58,580
country super.

1028
00:44:58,580 --> 00:44:59,580
Did you ever go by the way?

1029
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:00,580
I don't know.

1030
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:01,580
I missed this.

1031
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:02,580
Do you remember it even being there?

1032
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:04,560
I think I might vaguely remember that.

1033
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:09,280
Yeah, but you could there was a monitor that you could touch and you could choose between

1034
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:15,040
reading a biography of the star listening to an interview or watching the music video

1035
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:16,600
that the clothes were worn in.

1036
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:19,600
Biography please.

1037
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:25,720
Jeremy we're being seated.

1038
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:26,720
Let's go.

1039
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:31,600
I want to read about the Judd family, the first family of country music.

1040
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:33,600
How many pages is this?

1041
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:34,600
How many?

1042
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:39,240
Man, this and the premiere was the opening of this restaurant was attended by Loretta

1043
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:43,560
Lynn, Charlie Pride, Hoyt Axton, Diamond Rio, Wayne Gretzky and Little Richard.

1044
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:44,560
Wayne Gretzky.

1045
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:45,560
Yeah.

1046
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:46,560
What?

1047
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:47,560
I don't know.

1048
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:48,560
You know what?

1049
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:49,560
Wait, that reminds me.

1050
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:50,560
We didn't have time.

1051
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:54,880
We somehow missed this in the Tony Roma's episode, but there was, let me pull this fact

1052
00:45:54,880 --> 00:46:05,280
up that the, when it was a Tony Roma's, there was an event that was like, there was a rib

1053
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:08,880
eating contest that happened up here.

1054
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:14,000
Just while we're talking celebrities in this location, really glad I could go backwards

1055
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
and fit this in.

1056
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:23,440
In this Tony Roma's, this the fifth annual celebrity rib eating contest.

1057
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:29,160
Maybe we all together can participate in the, the next one, the 31st or whatever.

1058
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:30,160
Yeah.

1059
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,160
Whenever they do.

1060
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:35,440
I promise to hold a rib contest.

1061
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:37,480
Oh, yay, man.

1062
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:42,000
We have so many incentives to give you what you want on the other side of the space bridge.

1063
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,240
Daddy Yankee will serve you ribs.

1064
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:51,000
We can wipe up the sauce with the Pope's robes.

1065
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
He doesn't mind.

1066
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:58,280
The winners, if you were wondering of the celebrity rib eating contest, were five stand

1067
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:03,400
up comedians, Monty Hoffman, Bill Fox, Tom Tanik, Al Cleithin and Greg Goldman, who

1068
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:06,160
together called themselves Comic Rib Leaf.

1069
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:07,800
Oh, wow.

1070
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:10,280
So many celebrities.

1071
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:14,600
So it was a rib eating contest and you had a team?

1072
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:15,600
Yes.

1073
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:18,600
So it was the cumulative five.

1074
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:20,280
How many ribs can a group of five eat?

1075
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:25,000
In a nod to Comic Relief, they also gave the money to a charitable cause, but their, their

1076
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:30,960
charitable cause was their family court lawyers.

1077
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:37,720
Their bankruptcy lawyers from the stand up bust.

1078
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:40,920
Jason roasting Comic Rib Leaf.

1079
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:42,760
Take that.

1080
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:43,760
Okay.

1081
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:51,920
So, and then after Country Star, this became, then it became the saddle ranch, which is

1082
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:56,360
a long time fixture of the, of the sunset strip.

1083
00:47:56,360 --> 00:48:02,040
One of the sleazy in the best ways locations on the.

1084
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:03,040
Horrifying mannequins.

1085
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:06,400
I don't know if you guys passed by, but the mannequins are horrifying outside of it.

1086
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:10,560
They're just like, they're skin like, they're like weird, sallow skin.

1087
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:16,480
Let's make sure to show the proper respect it is called the saddle ranch job house.

1088
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:19,080
Oh boy.

1089
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:24,360
I have one story about this, which is I was hanging out on my, in my tour guide summer,

1090
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:30,720
I was hanging out at the saddle ranch one night and I was new to, I was newly 21 and

1091
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:33,520
I was trying drinks I hadn't had.

1092
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:37,160
And so I was somewhere where I'd had a mojito and I thought that's fun.

1093
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:40,520
It's mint and you know, that's new to me.

1094
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:44,760
So I went up to the saddle ranch bartender and I said, I'll have a mojito please.

1095
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:46,700
And he was like, oh yeah, cool.

1096
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:47,700
That's good.

1097
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:48,700
That's, that's real great.

1098
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:50,520
Uh, I got news for you though, buddy.

1099
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:53,960
We're drinking man drinks tonight.

1100
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:56,440
He rejected my order.

1101
00:48:56,440 --> 00:49:03,120
He mocked, which to me, a mojito while sweet still, you can taste the alcohol in it.

1102
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:09,160
That to me isn't the ultimate example of a like froufy girl drink.

1103
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:14,080
So like when it's hot in the middle of the summer, like that's a perfect drink.

1104
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:16,120
It'll be so sweet on these parsely.

1105
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:19,240
I'm sure that's what a Hemingway was drinking in cute.

1106
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:25,800
Well that and rum daiquiris and yeah, you can easily kill yourself with mojito.

1107
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:31,600
I remember ordering like a vodka cranberry and my friends were like a red drink.

1108
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:36,160
We don't have, don't drink, don't order something with like a bright color.

1109
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:37,160
That's not what you do.

1110
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:38,600
That's not what a man does.

1111
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:39,600
I was like, really?

1112
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:45,400
This was your origin story as ever since then you've only drank the brightest color.

1113
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:50,480
I scan the menu for the most neon color, the most unnatural color.

1114
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:52,240
And then I want to drink as much of it as possible.

1115
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:57,120
If it has five of the colors, that is the best.

1116
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:58,800
Uh, yeah, good for you.

1117
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:01,920
Fuck those guys and fuck this bartender and fuck Sinatra.

1118
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:08,280
And then sorry to the person who complained in the iTunes reviews that we swear too much.

1119
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:13,800
I never went to Saddle Ranch, but I feel like it was a few years living out here until I

1120
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:19,520
realized because my knowledge of it was that it's where people went in West Hollywood to

1121
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:21,280
get fucked up.

1122
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:24,680
And I didn't really have a bearing on the one at Universal City.

1123
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:26,720
I don't think it was still family was out visiting.

1124
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:29,120
They're like, oh, we could go to this barbecue place.

1125
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:31,800
Like we were up there and then we ended up somewhere else anyway.

1126
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:35,880
But I feel like it was a while before I realized like other than the name chop house in the

1127
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:38,580
title that it's like, oh, they have food.

1128
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:41,120
You can eat there because I don't think I had ever.

1129
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:43,480
And then I remember the last few years of Saddle Ranch.

1130
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:49,240
They had a lot of signs about like weekend brunch, come at brunch at Saddle Ranch.

1131
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:50,240
Yeah.

1132
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:55,400
The one on sunset, I think a lot of people, like I had, there was people that moved out

1133
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:59,240
here that I think have not maybe moved back since that I knew.

1134
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:02,600
And they would be at like Saddle Ranch on sunset every week.

1135
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:03,600
Wow.

1136
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:04,600
Once a week or something.

1137
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:08,440
So that was the place, which I think I guess I've been there once on sunset.

1138
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:14,240
The one at Universal, I've only went to once and it was after Avengers Age of Ultron.

1139
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:18,400
And the writing was on the wall for Saddle Ranch because there was no one there.

1140
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:22,320
The mechanical bull was not working or it was not on.

1141
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:24,320
They didn't plug it in maybe.

1142
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:26,600
And it was like, that was actually the first time I had been in that one.

1143
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:31,120
And you were like, there are over 30 empty rooms in this establishment.

1144
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:32,880
So many, so many rooms.

1145
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:36,120
They were not filling that space like old Whomp Hopper.

1146
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:39,520
They didn't have many a wagon to wheel and deal.

1147
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:44,360
And Saddle Ranch, the biggest problem is that there was no character to represent it.

1148
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:47,000
There was no J.H. Saddle.

1149
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Grandpa.

1150
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Mr. J.H. Saddle.

1151
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Oh, that was a...

1152
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
No, Grandpa.

1153
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Oh, Whomp Hopper.

1154
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Somebody like him.

1155
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Yeah, yeah.

1156
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:58,680
But if they had had a whimsical bearded character that that guy, what's his name?

1157
00:51:58,680 --> 00:51:59,680
Ron could play.

1158
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:00,680
Yeah.

1159
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:04,800
Deserted, deserted where I sleep.

1160
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:08,040
I sleep quiet.

1161
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:09,040
Deserted.

1162
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:14,560
Oh, so in the in the time when it was doing bad, that was OK for you because there was

1163
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:17,320
a free room that you could use.

1164
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:18,520
Nice and quiet.

1165
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:22,080
You tried doing that at the John Lovitz comedy club, but there was just so much laughter.

1166
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:23,080
It was too loud.

1167
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:24,080
Too loud.

1168
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:25,080
Too loud.

1169
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:26,080
Sides hurt.

1170
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:32,760
I mean, is that what we have to say about the Saddle Ranch?

1171
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:33,760
I think.

1172
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:37,840
Did you have a wild night there with your Universal employee?

1173
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:38,840
No, it was no.

1174
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:39,840
I've got disheartened.

1175
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:43,400
But when the that when my drink choice was complained about.

1176
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:44,720
Did that change you?

1177
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:47,840
Were you then self-conscious going forward in the next couple of years of ordering a

1178
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:51,360
mojito or a mojito or not beer or not whiskey or something?

1179
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:54,800
I'm not sure I've ever had a mojito since then.

1180
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:57,560
Oh, it's one of my favorites.

1181
00:52:57,560 --> 00:52:58,560
Delicious.

1182
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:02,080
Yeah, I know I was really liking the drink.

1183
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:06,440
And now that guy is like over my head like a specter going tisktisks.

1184
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:12,440
This answers a big audience question, which is why doesn't Scott drink mojitos?

1185
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:14,120
We had a breakthrough here today.

1186
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:18,400
So now what we know we have to do is we have to go to Disneyland.

1187
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:22,080
We have to get you nice and loaded on mojitos.

1188
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:26,600
And then we go on every launch, every quarter and Splash Mountain.

1189
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:27,600
Yep.

1190
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:30,880
And conquer it all in one on one day.

1191
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:32,400
I think I think they'll help.

1192
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:37,680
I think the mojitos will give me strength just as completion of sectors does the sector

1193
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:42,680
and hopefully like a one to one equivalent.

1194
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:47,280
Hopefully like no like Captain Hook comes up and sees you with the mojito and he points

1195
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:49,080
and you have like a flashback or something.

1196
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:55,480
Well, if it was my most feared character, the big bad wolf with the big dangly tongue,

1197
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:58,680
then I would never get on a ride or drink a mojito again.

1198
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:00,960
He's not in California Adventure at least right now.

1199
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:04,320
So you're only going to probably run into like the Incredibles, which they don't care

1200
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:05,320
if you have a mojito.

1201
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:06,320
Yeah, they're chill.

1202
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:09,320
Dash just comes up a few million times.

1203
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:14,960
And the mode could maybe sort of like give you like a tisktisk or something.

1204
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,160
Yeah, she'll put you on blast.

1205
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:21,880
So the lamp will shake its lamp head and the light will just go across your face.

1206
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:23,560
I don't want the walk around looks.

1207
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:25,840
It's kind of ambiguous, but Scott takes it very personally.

1208
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:26,840
No, no, it's at me.

1209
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:27,840
No, the light.

1210
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:28,840
The light is at me.

1211
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:29,840
I think it was stationary.

1212
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:32,840
I don't think it moved at all.

1213
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:33,840
No, no.

1214
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:36,040
I can't go on this quick launch.

1215
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:39,280
Just don't bring it into the pre-shofer Guardians of the Galaxy.

1216
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:42,280
What's that drink you're drinking there?

1217
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:44,280
Is that a mojito?

1218
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:47,440
You better not bring that on the gantry lift.

1219
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:51,880
I may be a raccoon, but even I know that ain't a man drink.

1220
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:53,880
Yeah, we drink it.

1221
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:58,520
Scott foiled from having a nice summer by toxic masculinity.

1222
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:00,560
It's in every corner.

1223
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:02,800
All right, well, let's talk about the...

1224
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:03,800
Oh, do you have something to...

1225
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,920
Well, what I want to hit before we get...

1226
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:06,920
Yes.

1227
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:07,920
He's sick, I think.

1228
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:08,920
Go ahead.

1229
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:11,360
I think we're all moving it along.

1230
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:12,360
We're all trying to.

1231
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:17,160
Really, because I know we have a lot to say about the final topic, but I want to say really

1232
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:25,440
fast first that the area, the restaurant venue that this thing moved into was initially built

1233
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:27,360
to be something called Victoria Station.

1234
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:28,360
Yes.

1235
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:32,720
I want to make sure we hit Victoria Station.

1236
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:38,840
It gave me some more perspective on the creation of Steady Walk.

1237
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:44,760
It's Victoria Station, which was like a trolley station themed restaurant that you can take

1238
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:46,960
a little trolley to from the parking lot.

1239
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:47,960
Oh, the parking lot.

1240
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:48,960
It took you up the hill.

1241
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:49,960
It took you up the hill.

1242
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:50,960
A little train.

1243
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:51,960
Oh.

1244
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:52,960
So that was there.

1245
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:56,240
And then there was also that Chinese restaurant.

1246
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:59,040
Oh, we haven't met, which I forget the name of.

1247
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:00,480
I forget the name of.

1248
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:04,640
Which I asked my dad today if he had any City Walk memories I should share, which is where

1249
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:06,880
I remembered them going to Toto or whatever.

1250
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:09,800
And he said, oh, yeah, well, I did go to that Chinese restaurant, which is real nice.

1251
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:13,800
But I remember we were leaving there one time and my mom fell.

1252
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:19,080
You have all these traumatic family stories attached to restaurant locations.

1253
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:25,280
My dad's dad had a heart attack in what became a Bubba Gump and my dad's mom tripped and

1254
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:29,040
fell outside of the Chinese restaurant.

1255
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:33,000
My dad is cursed when it comes to chains.

1256
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,360
That's why he sticks with Applebee's and Applebee's only.

1257
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:41,440
So Victoria Station, the Chinese restaurant, Whompomper's, a movie theater.

1258
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:42,440
So there's also.

1259
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:44,640
I'm never going to say it right.

1260
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:47,720
I don't know why I got in my head reading about it that there was an M in there and

1261
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:49,360
had it wrong in my notes.

1262
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:54,400
It's like flop flop global from the E.T. character flop global from the E.T. ride.

1263
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:56,200
I'm probably thinking of the flop global.

1264
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:59,080
You're confusing Whompomper's and flop global.

1265
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:04,280
So there's all these disparate businesses scattered around.

1266
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:05,320
Not that close to each other.

1267
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:06,800
Not that close to each other.

1268
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:12,640
And it took them years to think like, maybe we should put up a pathway and some signs

1269
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:13,640
and a couple of others.

1270
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:19,320
Maybe we shouldn't just be climbing unpaved hills to get to these different restaurants.

1271
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:25,200
But I do think I think City Walk Circa or what pre City Walk Circa 82 or whatever would

1272
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:30,320
have been my jam because Whompomper's seems great to me.

1273
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:31,800
The Chinese restaurant looks beautiful.

1274
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:36,160
It was sitting there like unoccupied for decades and now they're building a hotel there.

1275
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:39,240
But it was like it was beautiful from the outside.

1276
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:44,720
And then and then Victoria Station, which I didn't go to, but my wife went to and I texted

1277
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:50,000
her if she had any memories and she said it was the epitome of elegance in my six year

1278
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,320
old eyes.

1279
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:55,240
She loved Victoria Station.

1280
00:57:55,240 --> 00:58:01,040
And apparently Victoria Station, an extremely popular chain all over the country and in

1281
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:07,920
Canada and specifically the Universal location, their most popular location and at one point

1282
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:10,880
one of the highest grossing restaurants in the country.

1283
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:15,120
It was a train themed restaurant in general, as he says, you could eat in a train car.

1284
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:23,480
Aaron swears that it was superior to fellow L.A. chain or chain train train chain.

1285
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:26,480
Carnes which is also a train restaurant.

1286
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:28,400
So the king of the train chains.

1287
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:32,840
Other than that, I don't know much about it other than I watched an ad and the prime rib

1288
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:34,360
looks amazing.

1289
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:37,800
The shrimp Victoria looks divine.

1290
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:44,600
I bet they had excellent mojitos and Johnny Cash sang in their ads and get ready to gasp

1291
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:51,040
guys at no matter what you ordered at the end of the meal, a free mini rainbow sherbet

1292
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:53,000
ice cream on a mini cone.

1293
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,520
What else would you want?

1294
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:58,800
Could you have Toby Keith kebabs?

1295
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:00,240
All right.

1296
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:02,440
There was one.

1297
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:06,960
Every restaurant has something to bring to the table.

1298
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:10,400
So at one point there were two train themed restaurants.

1299
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:12,480
Was Carnes that same time?

1300
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:13,480
Yeah.

1301
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:14,480
And there were multiple.

1302
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:15,480
There was another.

1303
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:16,480
There was a Carnes on Sunset too.

1304
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:19,680
And then you probably grew up near the other Carnes, right?

1305
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:20,680
Were you fond of that?

1306
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:21,680
Uh, it was fine.

1307
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:23,680
As a kid I was like, this is fine.

1308
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:29,400
Don't forget the two dining cars, the Pacific dining car restaurants in LA.

1309
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:30,400
Oh yeah.

1310
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:31,960
Why don't maybe I didn't go to those.

1311
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:32,960
Oh, yeah.

1312
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:35,040
It's like a 24 hour steakhouse.

1313
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:38,120
There's one downtown and I think there's one in Santa Monica.

1314
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:40,920
And of course, coal mongers, my favorite.

1315
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:45,640
Order that black lung hot foot sundae.

1316
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:49,640
They make it with chocolate ice cream and chocolate whipped cream.

1317
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:50,640
Everything's dark.

1318
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:55,560
The thing about Victoria station that for some, why, why was this of interest to me?

1319
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:58,680
But it still is the idea that there could be a restaurant that you could enter from

1320
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:01,920
the park or from outside the park.

1321
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:06,240
Why can you give me any reason why that's why I find that interesting?

1322
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:08,480
But I do anything like that.

1323
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:11,880
I remember thinking, oh, so you'd be able to like the rainforest cafe outside animal

1324
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:12,880
kingdom.

1325
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:13,880
Oh, you can go inside or outside.

1326
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:14,880
That's not interesting.

1327
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:15,880
Why do I think that's interesting?

1328
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:20,160
Because the, I think as a kid, the walls of a theme park are the truly feel like you're

1329
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:21,640
going into another dimension.

1330
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:30,000
So the idea that there was some transparency that you can see through the facade.

1331
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,600
So you know, like, oh, we get a ticket and then I go through the turnstile.

1332
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:37,080
But the idea that like you would be, it would be like almost like being in two states at

1333
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:38,080
once.

1334
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:39,080
Oh yeah.

1335
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:40,080
Being in four corners.

1336
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:44,720
Sort of, you're like, oh, I'm in the park, but I'm not in the park.

1337
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:45,720
Thank you.

1338
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:47,800
That was a succinct way to put that.

1339
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:48,800
Yeah, I agree.

1340
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:49,800
It is interesting.

1341
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:50,800
It's like a terminal space.

1342
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:51,800
Yeah.

1343
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:52,800
Yeah.

1344
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:55,320
The zombies are neither dead nor alive.

1345
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:58,440
And also much like my life.

1346
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:05,480
You're trapped in a Marvel, the victory station S situation, which is also a little bit like

1347
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:07,480
Tom Hanks in the terminal.

1348
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:11,800
My selected movie for the city walk movie meal deal.

1349
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:12,800
The terminal.

1350
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:14,560
Oh, you'll, you'll get there.

1351
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:18,960
I know right now you are terminal, but soon you will.

1352
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:23,880
You got terminal, you got Larry crown.

1353
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:30,520
So many great Hanks's and of course, forest gump, which inspired the, the, the, the restaurant

1354
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:31,520
in your home.

1355
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:32,520
We have a lot to talk about.

1356
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:33,520
Yes.

1357
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:34,520
Yeah.

1358
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:35,520
Beautiful life once you're free.

1359
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:37,320
But the only way to get you free is to keep blowing it.

1360
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:38,320
So let's get into it.

1361
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:39,320
Let's go.

1362
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:42,560
A fellow astral plane splitting restaurants.

1363
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:44,520
Feel free gentlemen.

1364
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:47,720
What replaced Victoria's station?

1365
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:52,840
Actually the, maybe the main, one of the main theme park things I am sad I didn't get to

1366
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:57,200
go to the Marvel mania restaurant.

1367
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:59,600
You're here for a very specific reason.

1368
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:03,880
You told me this offhand at an event.

1369
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:07,760
I think we had like scribbled down like, oh yeah, we should mention more many on that

1370
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:10,080
sector stuff that's not there anymore.

1371
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:17,500
And you, you, when I said we were doing city walk, you told us that you had direct experience

1372
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:19,680
with 12th birthday party.

1373
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:23,080
My twin brother and I had a 12th birthday party at Marvel mania, which was open for

1374
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:24,400
like a year.

1375
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:29,800
So we were maybe, maybe there may be like 15 kids on earth who are saying this.

1376
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:30,800
Whoa.

1377
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:31,800
Yeah.

1378
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:33,320
We, we, we, we went, we gathered a group of friends.

1379
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:34,960
Uh, we went, we went to Marvel mania.

1380
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:35,960
It was incredible.

1381
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:38,000
I had, I had a fucking blast.

1382
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,000
That's amazing.

1383
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Now my, oh, sorry.

1384
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:45,080
I was going to say my, uh, my wife was on and she talked about her, I forget, maybe

1385
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:48,120
11th birthday at wizards at the magic club.

1386
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:55,560
Uh, uh, and which sounded like an ideal, uh, you know, middle school age birthday, but

1387
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:58,440
I would like, I'd like to hear more details about yours.

1388
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:01,880
I'd like you to one up my wife as much as possible.

1389
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:02,880
Let me ask you this.

1390
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:04,880
Did storm serve your wife?

1391
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:12,680
I mean, a, a, a wizard came out of the table, a weather wizard, uh, storm served us.

1392
01:03:12,680 --> 01:03:15,280
We were fucking stoked.

1393
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:18,640
Um, uh, um, they're, uh, one of the things I remember that were just like a tongue for

1394
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:21,680
some reason, they really thought that comic books meant like cryo chambers.

1395
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:25,600
So there were just like a ton of these like cryogenic, like everywhere.

1396
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:27,720
There was just a ton of them.

1397
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:29,680
They housed fake memorabilia.

1398
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:33,240
I think again, like kind of like hard rock cafe inspired, but unfortunately Marvel is

1399
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:34,580
in a fictional universe.

1400
01:03:34,580 --> 01:03:36,440
And so they literally Thor's hammer.

1401
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:37,440
No it's not.

1402
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:41,880
This is, this is, that's not, but it was, it was with the same reverence as if it was

1403
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:47,600
that like, like the, the Avengers, like, like the Avengers signed their, um, uh, their agreement

1404
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:52,480
to become the Avengers that was like displayed as if it was, they all signed a contract.

1405
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:58,840
There was like the five points that they agreed to Hulk signed his signature looks like shit.

1406
01:03:58,840 --> 01:04:03,120
What are each other's positions and how many points on the back end?

1407
01:04:03,120 --> 01:04:04,120
But that was displayed.

1408
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:08,120
Um, uh, and here's the thing, you know, one of the things that I think when, when people

1409
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:11,120
think about Marvel now, they probably think about the cinematic universe and it was, and

1410
01:04:11,120 --> 01:04:14,920
how hugely successful when I think of Marvel, I think of, I just instantly think of a trillion

1411
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:15,920
dollars.

1412
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:18,840
I think of what the pile would look like, but this was at the time where it was like

1413
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:20,400
this, where Marvel was not.

1414
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:21,400
This is bankruptcy Marvel.

1415
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:22,400
Yes.

1416
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:25,080
This is two years before X-Men, which is their first big like movie.

1417
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:26,080
Yeah.

1418
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:27,080
And that's, yeah.

1419
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:31,620
And this is, yeah, they thought this was, they started a restaurant division.

1420
01:04:31,620 --> 01:04:34,640
They thought this was going to be a big hit.

1421
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:39,680
We talked a little about this, I think on, on the twister episode, but when islands of

1422
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:44,960
adventure was sending out preview stuff about like islands of adventure is opening city

1423
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:47,960
walk is opening in Orlando, three hotels.

1424
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:51,960
One of the restaurants named was Marvel media and it never happened.

1425
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:52,960
It never got built there.

1426
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:54,840
This was the only one ever built.

1427
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:58,200
It was open for like a year and a half.

1428
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:04,480
Like it kind of limped across the over the year line and it is, yeah, it's bankruptcy

1429
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:08,800
era Marvel and, and Mike and I, I, this was for me.

1430
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:11,400
Well, were you, Nick, were you a big Marvel comics fan?

1431
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:12,400
We were reading.

1432
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:13,400
I love them.

1433
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:15,600
This is like a deep cut, but Maverick was my favorite.

1434
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:16,600
Oh yeah.

1435
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:21,040
He was like a kind of in the Wolverine kind of weapon X universe.

1436
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:24,160
But yeah, we were, we were definitely reading a ton of them.

1437
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:29,760
I remember one of my first memories, I remember I wanted to buy stock in Marvel at that time.

1438
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:30,760
I was a kid.

1439
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:33,040
I was like, you know, I was like a kid, but had some money else in my, my grandparents

1440
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:34,040
had like invested in.

1441
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:38,280
So I had mentioned that to my grandpa and my grandpa had said, did a bunch of research

1442
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:41,560
and was in rope and sent me a letter that said, you cannot do this.

1443
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:42,560
It was marvelous.

1444
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:47,200
I mean, if you had held onto it for 20 years, it would have been insane.

1445
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:48,200
Yeah.

1446
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:54,640
This is also around the time when like Stan Lee was talking to Michael Jackson about possibly

1447
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:55,640
buying Marvel together.

1448
01:05:55,640 --> 01:05:56,640
There was a whole thing.

1449
01:05:56,640 --> 01:05:57,640
Yeah.

1450
01:05:57,640 --> 01:05:58,840
Where they were, cause Stanley never owned Marvel.

1451
01:05:58,840 --> 01:06:02,440
He was always worked for hire, but there was like, they were going to dig together and

1452
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:08,040
I'm sure with like mysterious sheiks like pool together all their money and buy Marvel.

1453
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:10,240
Like there's Marvel is such a bizarre.

1454
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:11,240
Yeah.

1455
01:06:11,240 --> 01:06:12,240
Yeah.

1456
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:13,920
And like all of a sudden it became this.

1457
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:14,920
Yeah.

1458
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:17,840
But it was never like, cause Warner Brothers owned DC for so long, but Marvel was floating

1459
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:22,720
around and then was owned by toy biz for a while to rescued it from toy.

1460
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:30,160
It was like who Marvel hired to make their toys and then toy biz outpaced them and the

1461
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:31,960
lamprey still hanging on.

1462
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:35,160
It's like Perlmutter who owns Marvel.

1463
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:40,600
He's a great friend of Donald Trump, CEO's who loves being with Trump and the only, there's

1464
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:41,960
only two photos of mr.

1465
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:43,880
I Perlmutter that exists.

1466
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:49,280
One from either like the late, the early eighties, late seventies and one with Trump at Mar-a-Lago

1467
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:50,280
from a year ago.

1468
01:06:50,280 --> 01:06:51,280
Whoa.

1469
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:53,000
They only like two photos you can find.

1470
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:57,880
So when that surfaced, then you're like, Oh my God, there's a, he exists and he's there.

1471
01:06:57,880 --> 01:06:58,880
Yes.

1472
01:06:58,880 --> 01:06:59,880
Yeah.

1473
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:00,880
He loves Trump.

1474
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:01,880
They get along very well.

1475
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:06,680
He's a great piece of shit famous for saying like, we're not making girl superhero action

1476
01:07:06,680 --> 01:07:07,680
figures.

1477
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:08,680
Girls don't like superhero.

1478
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:10,440
Like girls don't buy this.

1479
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:15,600
Like that's by the way, it just says a little segue there that that philosophy comes through

1480
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:16,600
on the menu.

1481
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:19,080
And when we, you know, when we dig into the menu, cause there's so many, like, you know,

1482
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:22,680
obviously I wanted to appeal to everyone, but you know, you've got like, uh, you know,

1483
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:23,920
ghost riders ribs.

1484
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:27,480
That's a good, I think that's a good theme connection, but then you can see you have

1485
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:28,840
storms, hurricane shrimp.

1486
01:07:28,840 --> 01:07:29,840
Okay.

1487
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:33,280
And then you can see they've run out instantly run out of like women superheroes.

1488
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:36,640
So then it goes to Mary Jane's or roasted herb chicken.

1489
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:40,320
And then, and then like, like, you know, aunt May's Blake, like they they're just done.

1490
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:42,040
Like, you know, like you could just see that.

1491
01:07:42,040 --> 01:07:43,040
Yeah.

1492
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:44,040
Yeah.

1493
01:07:44,040 --> 01:07:45,040
May has, where was it?

1494
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:46,040
A soup, I think.

1495
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:47,040
Yeah.

1496
01:07:47,040 --> 01:07:48,040
Oh God.

1497
01:07:48,040 --> 01:07:49,040
May has, I look, there's, I have nine windows.

1498
01:07:49,040 --> 01:07:52,800
I should have consolidated this nine windows open with different parts of the menu.

1499
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:53,800
Yes.

1500
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:54,800
Yes.

1501
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:55,800
So much different types of menus.

1502
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:59,320
It looks like they cycled out of like what the menu was for like they had one that looked

1503
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:01,920
more like a comic and then they had one that looked more like.

1504
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:03,800
I think there was a take home one.

1505
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:05,840
So I have the adult menu, the kids menu.

1506
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:08,920
And then I think there was a second generation of the menu where they tried to make it a

1507
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:10,920
little nicer looking.

1508
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:14,040
But yeah, this is such an odd time.

1509
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:18,000
This is also wet after the bubble burst on the comic boom in the nineties.

1510
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:24,160
And like after Stan, Jim Lee had left the company, after all the image founders went

1511
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:25,520
and started their own companies.

1512
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:27,840
So Marvel lost like a lot of A-list artists.

1513
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:28,840
Jim Lee.

1514
01:08:28,840 --> 01:08:33,600
I mean, I think there's some great like there is it's very funny because this is kind of

1515
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:36,440
like there's some standard Marvel house style in this.

1516
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:42,180
But then the pages of the menu with the X-Men are clearly like the Carlos Pacheco drawings

1517
01:08:42,180 --> 01:08:43,180
of the time.

1518
01:08:43,180 --> 01:08:44,960
And there are some like Chris Bocalo.

1519
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:45,960
So there's like some.

1520
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:48,160
Are you sure that's not Mike Waringo art?

1521
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:49,160
Of the X-Men?

1522
01:08:49,160 --> 01:08:50,160
Of the X-Men?

1523
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:51,160
I don't.

1524
01:08:51,160 --> 01:08:53,160
Did Waringo draw the X-Men?

1525
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:54,160
I don't know.

1526
01:08:54,160 --> 01:08:56,360
But that looks a lot like a Waringo style to me more than a Pacheco.

1527
01:08:56,360 --> 01:08:57,360
I'm looking at a different page.

1528
01:08:57,360 --> 01:09:00,240
Can I see if I think it's Pacheco?

1529
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:02,440
This is yeah, just the way you draw it.

1530
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:03,440
That does look like Pacheco.

1531
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:04,440
You're right.

1532
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:05,440
I, Jason, I apologize.

1533
01:09:05,440 --> 01:09:10,760
I finally know what it would be like for a regular person to listen to any episode of

1534
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:11,760
this podcast.

1535
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:15,080
Classic boys, classic, classic boys.

1536
01:09:15,080 --> 01:09:17,560
But then there's some very weird choices.

1537
01:09:17,560 --> 01:09:22,320
So it's like very like late 90s Marvel art style and coloring.

1538
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:27,840
But the drink page looks like the letter columns of the 1980s.

1539
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:31,560
Like this was like what they would where they would print letters and print like check out

1540
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:35,320
this other book featuring the characters you like.

1541
01:09:35,320 --> 01:09:38,880
Like it's kind of a you could get Dom Perignon.

1542
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:41,880
You could get a bottle of Dom at MarlVeon.

1543
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:45,880
He's probably my favorite detail.

1544
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:46,880
What's it cost in you?

1545
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:52,720
The bottle of Dom is one hundred and forty dollars.

1546
01:09:52,720 --> 01:09:56,280
Well, that's not a bad price on the Dom scale.

1547
01:09:56,280 --> 01:09:57,280
Ninety seven ninety eight.

1548
01:09:57,280 --> 01:09:58,280
Who are you trying to impress?

1549
01:09:58,280 --> 01:10:00,520
Who the fuck are you pressing at that table at Marvel Mania?

1550
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:02,520
You're trying to impress the Wimplink Storm.

1551
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:03,520
Garcon, Garcon.

1552
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:07,480
Do you have to another thing about the drink menu?

1553
01:10:07,480 --> 01:10:11,640
All the like section headers have an exclamation point at the end.

1554
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:14,040
So it says like domestic bottle beer.

1555
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:15,040
Yeah, yeah.

1556
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:17,040
That's right.

1557
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:21,040
Whoever designed it thought that comic books just meant they loved fucking word bubbles.

1558
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:24,560
Yes, it was plastered in the fucking things.

1559
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:27,640
The gift shop, by the way, the word bubbles just said Marvel stuff.

1560
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:28,640
Yeah.

1561
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:30,680
And then exclamation points.

1562
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:32,560
Yeah, it was those two things.

1563
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:36,760
And they brag about like giant screens to watch Marvel TV and movies on.

1564
01:10:36,760 --> 01:10:39,480
But at the time that meant the cartoon.

1565
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:40,480
Cartoon X-Men.

1566
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:41,480
Yes.

1567
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:43,200
Cartoon X-Men.

1568
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:48,680
So instead of sporting events, there's many TVs devoted to just looping Marvel.

1569
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:49,920
I fucking loved it.

1570
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:53,360
Do you have the shot list and the martini list over here?

1571
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:54,360
Yeah.

1572
01:10:54,360 --> 01:10:55,360
OK.

1573
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:56,360
I did.

1574
01:10:56,360 --> 01:10:57,360
Negative zone.

1575
01:10:57,360 --> 01:10:58,360
Trade off.

1576
01:10:58,360 --> 01:10:59,360
Have fun with it.

1577
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:01,400
They were called web shooters, first of all, when you would get a small shot.

1578
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:02,400
Cool.

1579
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:03,400
Pretty good.

1580
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:06,760
Which now I think they would not do that because they don't want like kid friendly characters

1581
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:07,960
associated with liquor.

1582
01:11:07,960 --> 01:11:13,040
They want the kids ordering ice slides, which are their smoothies, alcohol free smoothies.

1583
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:16,640
But the web shooters, you could get a gamma slammer.

1584
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:18,620
You could get a clobber in time.

1585
01:11:18,620 --> 01:11:20,400
You could get an adrenaline shot.

1586
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:24,200
You could get a nuclear waste or you could get a dimension distorter.

1587
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:25,200
Whoa.

1588
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:28,000
And they were all in a take home glass.

1589
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:31,840
And this is I mean, this truly is I'm reading it is just my favorite restaurant.

1590
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:32,840
I am amazed.

1591
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:33,840
I've never been.

1592
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:38,440
Unless I missed it, there should have been like one of those bowl fish bowl drinks that

1593
01:11:38,440 --> 01:11:41,360
you get like four straws in called the ultimate nullifier.

1594
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:46,240
Which is like the cosmic cube, like something to get you best.

1595
01:11:46,240 --> 01:11:50,560
Like what are the day you sex Machina's from Marvel Comics where it's like they also.

1596
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:51,560
Yeah.

1597
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:54,920
I love the idea of a tram driver just like kind of just like just a fucked up day.

1598
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:56,880
And he goes, you know, like it's the it's the closest place.

1599
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:58,880
Just like, yeah, gamma slammer.

1600
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:01,880
It's like a real sad.

1601
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:04,840
Tommy, are you sure you know what happened last time?

1602
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:05,840
Yeah.

1603
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:06,840
All right.

1604
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:07,840
You're fucking hero.

1605
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:08,840
Gamma slammer.

1606
01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:11,760
I think that place should have been to the watcher.

1607
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:13,240
But he can't interfere.

1608
01:12:13,240 --> 01:12:15,240
He's somebody who cannot interfere.

1609
01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:17,320
That's why you go do it.

1610
01:12:17,320 --> 01:12:19,760
But he's just sort of like the pit boss of the whole thing.

1611
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:20,760
Yeah.

1612
01:12:20,760 --> 01:12:21,760
I'll bring it to you know what to watch.

1613
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:23,960
He's going to fucking say he's going to say just let him do it.

1614
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:25,960
And then like somebody has to audition for a watch.

1615
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:28,120
And it's like you got to shave your head, though.

1616
01:12:28,120 --> 01:12:29,120
I like it.

1617
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:30,720
They're not going to let you wear a bald cap.

1618
01:12:30,720 --> 01:12:31,720
I don't know.

1619
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:33,400
It's worth it for the visibility.

1620
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:34,400
Yeah.

1621
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:40,000
A very 90s detail to me of like the milkshake flavors and ice cream and desserts.

1622
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
There's a lot of Butterfinger crap.

1623
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,000
Yeah.

1624
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:46,200
Butterfinger crunch is kind of everywhere on this menu.

1625
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:48,640
Blastar's ballistic Butterfinger bread pudding.

1626
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:54,200
That's also when you're getting to Blastar, when you get into the Fantastic Four villain

1627
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:57,280
Blastar, you're scraping the bottom of the barrel.

1628
01:12:57,280 --> 01:12:59,000
There's some obscure ones.

1629
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
It's Swordsman, I think, is in here.

1630
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,800
Oh, there's also the two gun kit.

1631
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:06,840
Cheeseburger to me is going to be I'm we're thinking it's going to be like Wolverine or

1632
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:08,280
like it's going to be a heavy hitter.

1633
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:11,280
It's like two gun kid.

1634
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:15,240
Well that's because they needed to distinguish between Caps Battle Burger, which is on the

1635
01:13:15,240 --> 01:13:16,240
kids menu.

1636
01:13:16,240 --> 01:13:17,240
There it is.

1637
01:13:17,240 --> 01:13:18,240
There it is.

1638
01:13:18,240 --> 01:13:19,240
Yeah.

1639
01:13:19,240 --> 01:13:20,240
And they also have Vince Gill's cheeseburger.

1640
01:13:20,240 --> 01:13:21,240
Yeah.

1641
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:22,240
Yeah.

1642
01:13:22,240 --> 01:13:23,240
Seemed very creative.

1643
01:13:23,240 --> 01:13:24,240
This is my favorite.

1644
01:13:24,240 --> 01:13:25,240
This is my favorite of the menu.

1645
01:13:25,240 --> 01:13:26,800
This is on the dessert menu.

1646
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:29,560
It just sounds like absolute shit.

1647
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:32,160
The thin thing from fruit fajitas.

1648
01:13:32,160 --> 01:13:33,160
Yeah.

1649
01:13:33,160 --> 01:13:39,720
Oh, fresh fruit sizzling in a vanilla rum sauce served with chocolate tortillas, vanilla ice

1650
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:41,920
cream and lots of yummy condiments.

1651
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:42,920
Yeah.

1652
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:44,480
Those delicious dessert condiments.

1653
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:47,960
They don't even specify what the condiments are.

1654
01:13:47,960 --> 01:13:50,960
Last meal.

1655
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:52,560
Last meal.

1656
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:58,000
I mean, it's it's very much a tour de force to have like 90s food.

1657
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:01,160
I mean, Blastar's ballistic butter finger bread pudding.

1658
01:14:01,160 --> 01:14:04,400
We were recently up at City Walk.

1659
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:07,600
I had a delicious banana bread pudding at Margaritaville.

1660
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:10,760
But the idea of taking bread pudding and just cramming a bunch of butter.

1661
01:14:10,760 --> 01:14:11,760
Yes.

1662
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:12,760
Yeah.

1663
01:14:12,760 --> 01:14:13,760
Butterfinger was huge.

1664
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:14,760
I mean, like Simpsons crossover.

1665
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:15,760
Yeah.

1666
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:17,680
Like it was like, like, like, like Butterfinger BBs.

1667
01:14:17,680 --> 01:14:18,680
No one better.

1668
01:14:18,680 --> 01:14:19,680
On my Butterfinger.

1669
01:14:19,680 --> 01:14:25,960
What I was talking about earlier, the Michael Ringo drawn menu I'm looking at.

1670
01:14:25,960 --> 01:14:30,440
It says here it's like, so it looks like a comic book and it says at the top, absolutely

1671
01:14:30,440 --> 01:14:34,080
no broccoli, spinach or squash on this menu.

1672
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:35,080
Yeah.

1673
01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:36,080
Yeah.

1674
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:37,080
Yeah.

1675
01:14:37,080 --> 01:14:38,080
Kids.

1676
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:39,080
Kids love that.

1677
01:14:39,080 --> 01:14:40,080
Kids love it.

1678
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:45,000
And so like, oh, Mighty Mutant Macaroni and Cheese and the X-Men, specifically the gold

1679
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,040
team, X-Men gold team members.

1680
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:48,080
That makes sense to me.

1681
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:50,120
The Champions cheese pizza.

1682
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:56,240
The Champions was like a obscure like team with Ghost Rider and Iceman, a Black Widow

1683
01:14:56,240 --> 01:14:57,240
and Hercules.

1684
01:14:57,240 --> 01:14:59,480
What was the gold team on?

1685
01:14:59,480 --> 01:15:01,120
The gold team is on the Mac and Cheese.

1686
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:04,880
Oh, because the blue X-Men on Kenny X-Men blue team is on Kenny X Pasta.

1687
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:05,880
Yes.

1688
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:09,360
And that's clearly Gambit, Rogue, B, Cyclops, the classic blue team from the 90s.

1689
01:15:09,360 --> 01:15:10,360
Nick, you know what I'm talking about.

1690
01:15:10,360 --> 01:15:11,360
Without a doubt.

1691
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:12,360
Yeah.

1692
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:15,760
And then you have the Defenders tenders, which is Dr. Strange.

1693
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:16,760
Yeah.

1694
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:18,720
Silver Surfer, Hulk, Namor.

1695
01:15:18,720 --> 01:15:22,160
These are also like B-list teams from the.

1696
01:15:22,160 --> 01:15:23,160
Even especially.

1697
01:15:23,160 --> 01:15:27,200
Although the Champions holds the distinction, I think, of being the first Los Angeles Marvel

1698
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:28,200
superhero team.

1699
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:31,480
The Champions were based out of L.A., so I kind of get that.

1700
01:15:31,480 --> 01:15:34,160
They have the dare dog.

1701
01:15:34,160 --> 01:15:35,160
That sucks.

1702
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:38,240
I mean, that just sucks.

1703
01:15:38,240 --> 01:15:40,920
This menu is the I haven't had it in front of me till now.

1704
01:15:40,920 --> 01:15:43,280
It's the busiest thing I've ever seen.

1705
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:44,920
There's 10 different menus.

1706
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:45,920
There's multiple menus.

1707
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:49,480
This was open for a year, so they must have just turned them over so fast.

1708
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:53,760
I think they were letting you take home some of them because I found a lot of people like.

1709
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:56,760
Because it looked like a comic book.

1710
01:15:56,760 --> 01:15:59,360
We need someone to copy.

1711
01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:03,080
Stan Lee is on the cover of the kids menu in a top hat.

1712
01:16:03,080 --> 01:16:07,880
This was a thing in the little corner box on Marvel Comics for a while.

1713
01:16:07,880 --> 01:16:08,880
There would be Stan Lee.

1714
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:10,760
It's like a ringmaster figure.

1715
01:16:10,760 --> 01:16:13,800
That was also not to see a Wompopper, though, with a top hat.

1716
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:14,800
He does.

1717
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:15,800
He does look like Wompopper.

1718
01:16:15,800 --> 01:16:16,800
Yes.

1719
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:19,800
No, no, this is Stan the man.

1720
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:26,040
Some of these are so busily drawn, like some of them have like three items on an entire

1721
01:16:26,040 --> 01:16:28,160
page just because there's so much happening.

1722
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:34,760
Yeah, but then I pulled up another one where there's I think there's like 900 words on

1723
01:16:34,760 --> 01:16:35,760
this menu.

1724
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:40,520
It's like, yeah, boy, yeah, this is this is headache induced.

1725
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:47,240
Coffee shop, supersonic shakes, love a drink called love tales.

1726
01:16:47,240 --> 01:16:49,800
I don't even know what would that be a reference to?

1727
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:56,320
I think that is a Marvel romance title from the 50s maybe.

1728
01:16:56,320 --> 01:17:00,040
They also should be pointing out the mighty Marvel spice ometer.

1729
01:17:00,040 --> 01:17:05,480
And that is how you know how spicy hot spicy stuff is.

1730
01:17:05,480 --> 01:17:10,400
And it's the human torch and he's got a there's one spark of heat is a little bit of fire.

1731
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:15,740
Potent is a little more and supernova is full of human fire, human torch.

1732
01:17:15,740 --> 01:17:21,120
But I had to keep going back to that meter because like it's so hard to distinguish between

1733
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:24,480
like mild and medium.

1734
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:30,640
In an unreadable font under that, a helpful guide to our taste bud tortures.

1735
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:32,560
It's like so hard.

1736
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:34,000
You can't read it small.

1737
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,080
It's really straining my phone.

1738
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:38,520
And it only applies to like four menu items.

1739
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:40,520
It doesn't even come up that much.

1740
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:43,540
How do you know that it's a oh, OK.

1741
01:17:43,540 --> 01:17:48,080
On elsewhere on the appetizer page, I see a little blue guy, but it's too small to see

1742
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:49,320
who he is.

1743
01:17:49,320 --> 01:17:53,240
But he's next to the dish Gambit's sugar cane shrimp.

1744
01:17:53,240 --> 01:17:54,240
Oh, my God.

1745
01:17:54,240 --> 01:17:55,240
I don't see that.

1746
01:17:55,240 --> 01:17:59,240
It's a shrimp served on a sugar cane skewer.

1747
01:17:59,240 --> 01:18:01,240
Oh, I'm missing that one.

1748
01:18:01,240 --> 01:18:03,240
It's underneath the Rainbow Bridge nachos.

1749
01:18:03,240 --> 01:18:06,240
That's different than the space bridge.

1750
01:18:06,240 --> 01:18:08,320
Different than what was it called again?

1751
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:10,320
The Pope, the papal space bridge.

1752
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:11,320
Space bridge.

1753
01:18:11,320 --> 01:18:13,520
It's a Yankee space.

1754
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:14,520
Daddy Yankee's papal space.

1755
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:16,920
But it makes sense because he's from the Bayou.

1756
01:18:16,920 --> 01:18:17,920
Yes.

1757
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:19,400
Rainbow Bridge to me seems like a sherbert thing.

1758
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:22,760
It's crazy that on on fucking nachos is insane.

1759
01:18:22,760 --> 01:18:25,160
The Fantastic Four also have two menu items.

1760
01:18:25,160 --> 01:18:26,160
Yeah.

1761
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:28,880
Which they have the fantastic fries and they have the fantastic.

1762
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:29,880
Where was it?

1763
01:18:29,880 --> 01:18:30,880
Was it pasta?

1764
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:31,880
Mm hmm.

1765
01:18:31,880 --> 01:18:32,880
It's like why would they?

1766
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:33,880
There's more characters.

1767
01:18:33,880 --> 01:18:35,320
They're the first family of Marvel Comics.

1768
01:18:35,320 --> 01:18:38,600
I think they've earned two slots.

1769
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:41,400
Did you guys read mutant chicken wings already?

1770
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:44,600
I feel like we've been doing this for 19 hours.

1771
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:49,840
It's also very funny that it's mutant chicken wings and the human torches next to it.

1772
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:50,840
Ridiculous.

1773
01:18:50,840 --> 01:18:52,440
I feel like we missed 20 percent of the menu so far.

1774
01:18:52,440 --> 01:18:53,440
We're not even close.

1775
01:18:53,440 --> 01:18:57,040
One of my favorites is Submariner's Deep Sea Suggestions.

1776
01:18:57,040 --> 01:19:02,480
Ask your server for the market price, man.

1777
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:05,320
Oh my god, deep sea suggestions.

1778
01:19:05,320 --> 01:19:06,320
Fucking incredible.

1779
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:07,800
And of course, Doc Ock's Walk.

1780
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:17,680
Doc Ock's Walk because they used Shang-Chi Chinese tacos in Sunfire Spring Rolls to actual

1781
01:19:17,680 --> 01:19:19,560
Asian Marvel Comics characters.

1782
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:25,000
So when they got to the walk, I was like, oh, that rhymes with Doc Ock.

1783
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:28,840
I'm glad they didn't go with Iron Fist, who's famously a white guy.

1784
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:29,840
Oh, yeah.

1785
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:35,320
Do you guys, but we haven't we were missing the main thing, which is what the sandwiches

1786
01:19:35,320 --> 01:19:36,320
are called.

1787
01:19:36,320 --> 01:19:37,960
Do you know what the sandwich is?

1788
01:19:37,960 --> 01:19:38,960
Let me find the thing.

1789
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:39,960
The Stanwiches.

1790
01:19:39,960 --> 01:19:40,960
They are called Stanwiches.

1791
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:41,960
Oh, Nuff said.

1792
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:42,960
Nuff said.

1793
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:45,960
And then the word is Nuff said.

1794
01:19:45,960 --> 01:19:46,960
Excelsior.

1795
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:47,960
Excelsior.

1796
01:19:47,960 --> 01:19:52,320
All Stanwiches are served with our marvelous baked potato salad.

1797
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:55,320
In this business closed?

1798
01:19:55,320 --> 01:20:00,400
No, I'm confused too, Sectorkeeper.

1799
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:08,720
Well, I went there for I must have got one of the Stanwiches for my birthday or whatever.

1800
01:20:08,720 --> 01:20:12,800
There's a little bit of drama that happened because I when they when they would come,

1801
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:15,480
I think maybe because it was our birthday, but they came and they had they would also

1802
01:20:15,480 --> 01:20:20,360
like the there'd be like a a little like gift basket thing at the end.

1803
01:20:20,360 --> 01:20:22,640
It was like a bucket full of comic books.

1804
01:20:22,640 --> 01:20:23,640
You would get that.

1805
01:20:23,640 --> 01:20:26,960
I mentioned I loved Maverick, but this was the 90s.

1806
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:30,560
And one of the things was if you missed an issue of something, it wasn't super clear

1807
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:31,840
you would ever read it.

1808
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:35,440
At least for me, it was like it like I had three comic book stores I could go to.

1809
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:36,880
If it wasn't there, I was fucked.

1810
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:39,040
And that was the case for Maverick number four.

1811
01:20:39,040 --> 01:20:41,440
What happened was we got these these buckets.

1812
01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:45,400
I don't know what the fuck happened, but one of my friends, Wesley, got Maverick number

1813
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:46,400
four in his bucket.

1814
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:47,400
Oh my gosh.

1815
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:48,400
Wow.

1816
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:49,400
And I was like, I could pull rank.

1817
01:20:49,400 --> 01:20:52,920
I had this option that I could pull rank, but I was also because of my Christian upbringing,

1818
01:20:52,920 --> 01:20:54,400
I would never ask anyone for anything.

1819
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:55,760
I would never do it.

1820
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:59,240
So I was just staring at this fucking bucket while he just like absentmindedly flipped

1821
01:20:59,240 --> 01:21:00,380
through it.

1822
01:21:00,380 --> 01:21:01,380
Didn't say anything.

1823
01:21:01,380 --> 01:21:02,380
The whole ride home, he was sitting next to me.

1824
01:21:02,380 --> 01:21:03,760
I could see it in his fucking bucket.

1825
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:04,760
Didn't say shit.

1826
01:21:04,760 --> 01:21:05,760
I got home and I just cried.

1827
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:10,760
I just could not ask for this.

1828
01:21:10,760 --> 01:21:12,760
Maverick number four or whatever the fuck.

1829
01:21:12,760 --> 01:21:16,840
And you were in an area like L.A. has always had a lot of comic shops.

1830
01:21:16,840 --> 01:21:17,840
Yeah.

1831
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:18,840
Like that's crazy.

1832
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:19,840
Maverick, the thing was, I think it was small enough.

1833
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:20,840
Yeah, that didn't run.

1834
01:21:20,840 --> 01:21:23,840
I remember that book didn't run for a long time.

1835
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:24,840
It was very small.

1836
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:27,240
It just wasn't one that they were going to keep a huge back.

1837
01:21:27,240 --> 01:21:30,080
And you know, you might go to the there were back catalogs you could go through, but it

1838
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:31,960
might be like one, six, eight.

1839
01:21:31,960 --> 01:21:35,280
For some reason, I just could not fucking find this.

1840
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:39,560
Your Christian upbringing didn't prevent you from lying to Ariel about the soda.

1841
01:21:39,560 --> 01:21:43,360
Even in that, I feel like that even can be traced back to just like my complete discomfort

1842
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:46,320
with any being around any like, you know, romantic situation.

1843
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:49,720
That one's tricky because you did end up lying, which is against Christianity, but it was

1844
01:21:49,720 --> 01:21:53,600
a situation where you liked a girl, which is forbidden.

1845
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:57,760
But I do hear myself in terms of getting a smooch or something like that.

1846
01:21:57,760 --> 01:21:58,760
Yeah.

1847
01:21:58,760 --> 01:22:01,440
I did myself in my chastity.

1848
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:05,920
I'm just realizing there's a dessert called chocolate carnage, which is the Spider-Man

1849
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:09,400
villain who is a psychopath serial killer.

1850
01:22:09,400 --> 01:22:10,400
Mass murderer.

1851
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:11,400
Mass murderer.

1852
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:12,400
Yeah.

1853
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:16,680
Even before he became a supervillain, he was a killer in jail and then a venom symbiote

1854
01:22:16,680 --> 01:22:17,680
a little bit.

1855
01:22:17,680 --> 01:22:21,400
The symbiote got him and gave him on the menu anywhere.

1856
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:24,080
Or is it chocolate just because they had a C at the start?

1857
01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:27,680
I guess it was a C. Yeah, that is surprising because venom wasn't the 90s thing.

1858
01:22:27,680 --> 01:22:30,160
It's not even a C-H. It's not even like a...

1859
01:22:30,160 --> 01:22:31,160
Right.

1860
01:22:31,160 --> 01:22:32,160
It doesn't make sense.

1861
01:22:32,160 --> 01:22:34,160
I'm looking through the video of what you were talking about, Nick.

1862
01:22:34,160 --> 01:22:35,800
You're talking about the different artifacts.

1863
01:22:35,800 --> 01:22:38,960
And I'm going to, what I'm going to do is I won't say what this artifact is.

1864
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:43,400
I'm going to show it to Jason and Jason's going to announce one of the things you could

1865
01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:46,880
view on display at Marvel Mania.

1866
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:53,320
Ah, Namor's famous conch shell.

1867
01:22:53,320 --> 01:22:55,720
What?

1868
01:22:55,720 --> 01:22:57,480
Namor's conch shell.

1869
01:22:57,480 --> 01:22:58,480
Oh my God.

1870
01:22:58,480 --> 01:22:59,480
It's a trumpet horn.

1871
01:22:59,480 --> 01:23:00,480
It's a trumpet horn.

1872
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:01,960
They just didn't know what was popping.

1873
01:23:01,960 --> 01:23:06,960
You could just see like two gun kid was held to the same standard as like Spider-Man.

1874
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:07,960
They just didn't know.

1875
01:23:07,960 --> 01:23:08,960
They got a list.

1876
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:12,640
They didn't know which was more important.

1877
01:23:12,640 --> 01:23:14,120
It was just alphabetized.

1878
01:23:14,120 --> 01:23:17,720
I mean, Spider-Man, Captain America, and then they probably could have just filled it with

1879
01:23:17,720 --> 01:23:21,520
the X-Men because they had the most exposure in the 90s.

1880
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:22,520
Absolutely.

1881
01:23:22,520 --> 01:23:26,920
Which is very sad to think about now that they have taken such a backseat because of

1882
01:23:26,920 --> 01:23:31,920
like corporate dealings and feel like Disney owns the movie rights outright.

1883
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:34,360
Then we'll probably see a renaissance of X-Men stuff.

1884
01:23:34,360 --> 01:23:38,440
It's all coming back now because they're good for the Fox deal though.

1885
01:23:38,440 --> 01:23:46,680
If this restaurant opened today, if it was a pop-up on Hollywood Boulevard, the line

1886
01:23:46,680 --> 01:23:49,680
would be 27 hours long.

1887
01:23:49,680 --> 01:23:52,640
This would be the most popular thing that has ever occurred.

1888
01:23:52,640 --> 01:23:54,360
You could have a job or eat there.

1889
01:23:54,360 --> 01:23:55,360
Yeah.

1890
01:23:55,360 --> 01:23:56,360
It would be like, you know, yeah.

1891
01:23:56,360 --> 01:23:57,360
Yeah.

1892
01:23:57,360 --> 01:24:01,080
If you trade, if you did shifts, if you traded out with friends, can you imagine this would

1893
01:24:01,080 --> 01:24:06,600
be like all that was Instagrammed about for the first month and a half of opening.

1894
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:07,600
Yeah.

1895
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:12,840
But more than any of all the things where we talk about plus it up or whatever, or an

1896
01:24:12,840 --> 01:24:19,080
old thing that needs to come back, if this were brought back, it generates as much money

1897
01:24:19,080 --> 01:24:22,760
as all of the Marvel movies do individually.

1898
01:24:22,760 --> 01:24:25,360
This is such a killer.

1899
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:27,200
This needs to occur.

1900
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:31,360
They probably would update the aesthetic and make it reflect more of the current state

1901
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:33,800
of Marvel, but obviously I would love if-

1902
01:24:33,800 --> 01:24:34,800
Yeah.

1903
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:41,920
Well, the thing is, and I hate to say this even, but I don't know that Disney would open

1904
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:45,080
a tacky restaurant version of this anymore.

1905
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:46,080
Maybe not.

1906
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:48,760
Because the only way I think it's going to open is it opens in Disneyland or California

1907
01:24:48,760 --> 01:24:49,760
Adventure specifically.

1908
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:52,680
It can't open in Florida because of the deals.

1909
01:24:52,680 --> 01:24:54,160
So Disney controls it.

1910
01:24:54,160 --> 01:24:57,240
So we may get a much more theme.

1911
01:24:57,240 --> 01:25:00,680
We might dine with Dr. Strange in the Sanctum Sanctorum.

1912
01:25:00,680 --> 01:25:04,960
There's rumors of a microbrewery coming to California Adventure on the Avengers-

1913
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:05,960
Oh, is that right?

1914
01:25:05,960 --> 01:25:11,160
Well, I saw a rumor that like, because they're opening Marvel stuff in California Adventure,

1915
01:25:11,160 --> 01:25:16,680
that it will be an Avengers West Coast campus, which includes a microbrewery restaurant.

1916
01:25:16,680 --> 01:25:17,680
Whoa.

1917
01:25:17,680 --> 01:25:18,680
Really?

1918
01:25:18,680 --> 01:25:19,680
It's there on site.

1919
01:25:19,680 --> 01:25:23,360
Can you whisper to me, South Mike, where you got this rumor?

1920
01:25:23,360 --> 01:25:24,360
Disney Tourism?

1921
01:25:24,360 --> 01:25:26,280
Oh, I don't read that.

1922
01:25:26,280 --> 01:25:28,040
That's a little trustworthy though, isn't it?

1923
01:25:28,040 --> 01:25:29,040
A lot more than bumper car boys.

1924
01:25:29,040 --> 01:25:30,040
Pretty reliable.

1925
01:25:30,040 --> 01:25:31,040
If this were a bumper car boys, you'd get the fuck out of here.

1926
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:32,040
Good instincts.

1927
01:25:32,040 --> 01:25:33,040
Good instincts.

1928
01:25:33,040 --> 01:25:34,040
Yeah, yeah.

1929
01:25:34,040 --> 01:25:35,040
I'll send you the link.

1930
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:38,040
I swear we had talked about that.

1931
01:25:38,040 --> 01:25:40,040
Fucking liars at bumper car boys.

1932
01:25:40,040 --> 01:25:41,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1933
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:42,760
Thank God it's not them.

1934
01:25:42,760 --> 01:25:48,600
So I mean, look, it wasn't the time, and I am grossed out by the aesthetic and many of

1935
01:25:48,600 --> 01:25:53,760
the things that they have, but you do a Marvel restaurant with puns and stuff today.

1936
01:25:53,760 --> 01:25:54,760
Forget it.

1937
01:25:54,760 --> 01:25:55,760
Forget it.

1938
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:56,760
You don't even, it doesn't even know.

1939
01:25:56,760 --> 01:26:01,920
I'm saying that the full classy Disney version, absolutely, like in the parks, but if they

1940
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:06,920
did this in that, say, by the bell, the bad version of this would be...

1941
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:09,240
Yeah, it would be amazing and people would love it.

1942
01:26:09,240 --> 01:26:12,200
I'm just saying I don't know that Disney would let it go now.

1943
01:26:12,200 --> 01:26:13,200
That's my problem.

1944
01:26:13,200 --> 01:26:16,920
I'm just saying that they might not even allow that to happen because of the prestige of

1945
01:26:16,920 --> 01:26:17,920
the brand.

1946
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:22,800
Well, they're letting go of $1 billion and they're making a big mistake.

1947
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:24,160
That's kind of the tragedy of this place.

1948
01:26:24,160 --> 01:26:27,000
Because it opened kind of like just maybe a year too soon.

1949
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,560
I really do think that those X-Men movies were huge.

1950
01:26:29,560 --> 01:26:30,560
Oh yeah.

1951
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:34,400
It really does seem like it was just like kind of like this poorly timed thing.

1952
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:39,560
And the aesthetic of it is obviously still alive in Orlando and in the Marvel superhero

1953
01:26:39,560 --> 01:26:41,200
island at Islands of Adventure.

1954
01:26:41,200 --> 01:26:42,200
And it never changes.

1955
01:26:42,200 --> 01:26:44,200
I know Jason wants it to not change from...

1956
01:26:44,200 --> 01:26:45,200
I want it to never evolve.

1957
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:47,240
...being a monument to 1996.

1958
01:26:47,240 --> 01:26:50,560
It might not legally be allowed to.

1959
01:26:50,560 --> 01:26:55,920
Well there's going to be wheelings and dealings if the Fox deal goes through with maybe trading

1960
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:56,920
things.

1961
01:26:56,920 --> 01:26:57,920
So who knows?

1962
01:26:57,920 --> 01:27:00,400
Well hopefully somewhere in the shuffle.

1963
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:03,160
Because I think they did a bad job.

1964
01:27:03,160 --> 01:27:06,120
I wasn't a comic book kid if I haven't conveyed that.

1965
01:27:06,120 --> 01:27:10,760
And I remember seeing Marvel Mania in the parks and I just didn't know...

1966
01:27:10,760 --> 01:27:16,020
Nowhere had ever done a good job of letting me know why I should care about any of this.

1967
01:27:16,020 --> 01:27:19,520
And I just saw like horrible gaudy colors.

1968
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:22,400
And there was nothing luring me in.

1969
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:27,600
And yeah probably not till X-Men did they figure out how to reach out to the non-comic

1970
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:28,600
reader.

1971
01:27:28,600 --> 01:27:32,400
My favorite thing of some of the walk around characters other than like the face characters

1972
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:34,760
look like you'd expect them to look.

1973
01:27:34,760 --> 01:27:40,440
But like the Iron Man suit in like a display case or if he was walking around was real

1974
01:27:40,440 --> 01:27:41,440
puffy.

1975
01:27:41,440 --> 01:27:44,240
Like it was always so puffy.

1976
01:27:44,240 --> 01:27:48,080
Like so like yeah they're muscle guys and they're puffy.

1977
01:27:48,080 --> 01:27:56,240
That toxic masculinity even Captain America like he's just disgustingly buffed out.

1978
01:27:56,240 --> 01:27:57,240
It's nuts.

1979
01:27:57,240 --> 01:28:01,360
It was like this whole like Roy like the steroid obsession of these like superheroes.

1980
01:28:01,360 --> 01:28:05,600
The pecs that were like past their shoulder you know it was just awful.

1981
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:10,720
Yeah and basically what they did was like oh okay some guys draw them like this so let's

1982
01:28:10,720 --> 01:28:11,920
make the costumes like this.

1983
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:15,600
But even on the menu you can see the different art styles where like some of them clearly

1984
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:21,920
draw them a lot leaner like runners and then some of them it's just so such caricature

1985
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:23,680
exaggerated caricatures.

1986
01:28:23,680 --> 01:28:28,880
I want to talk to the sector keeper real quick because on display in Marvel Mania and maybe

1987
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:32,880
he has more information and maybe how this relates to a set of stones.

1988
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:34,560
This was the Infinity Gauntlet.

1989
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:35,560
Yes.

1990
01:28:35,560 --> 01:28:38,560
Which also had contained six different stones.

1991
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:40,520
Oh yes.

1992
01:28:40,520 --> 01:28:41,720
Inspired me.

1993
01:28:41,720 --> 01:28:46,720
My final birthday was at Marvel Mania.

1994
01:28:46,720 --> 01:28:48,840
You were in the same run as Nick.

1995
01:28:48,840 --> 01:28:50,560
Yes I remember seeing you.

1996
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:51,560
You saw me.

1997
01:28:51,560 --> 01:28:52,560
Yes happy birthday.

1998
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:53,560
Oh thanks.

1999
01:28:53,560 --> 01:28:55,560
You guys share the same birthday.

2000
01:28:55,560 --> 01:28:56,560
Thanks dude.

2001
01:28:56,560 --> 01:28:58,080
Oh my god.

2002
01:28:58,080 --> 01:28:59,080
Yes.

2003
01:28:59,080 --> 01:29:00,080
Wow.

2004
01:29:00,080 --> 01:29:03,680
My last clear memory is of Namor's shell.

2005
01:29:03,680 --> 01:29:06,520
It's Kong's shell.

2006
01:29:06,520 --> 01:29:09,440
And that's that's the stone.

2007
01:29:09,440 --> 01:29:11,600
The stone for the sector has appeared.

2008
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:13,320
It's Namor's conch shell.

2009
01:29:13,320 --> 01:29:14,320
It was conch.

2010
01:29:14,320 --> 01:29:16,680
Boys and look closely.

2011
01:29:16,680 --> 01:29:19,360
It's sitting on a little mechanical bowl.

2012
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:20,360
Oh wow.

2013
01:29:20,360 --> 01:29:21,360
I see it now.

2014
01:29:21,360 --> 01:29:24,280
It's holding a little guitar.

2015
01:29:24,280 --> 01:29:25,280
Oh neat.

2016
01:29:25,280 --> 01:29:26,280
Wow.

2017
01:29:26,280 --> 01:29:29,840
And it's all and it's signed by Chicago trumpet player Lee Lockney.

2018
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:30,840
Yes.

2019
01:29:30,840 --> 01:29:32,880
Yes and he said something to you Nick.

2020
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:33,880
Yes.

2021
01:29:33,880 --> 01:29:34,880
He said you made the right choice.

2022
01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:35,880
I made the right choice.

2023
01:29:35,880 --> 01:29:36,880
I think I did.

2024
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:40,120
Ariel would have left you no matter what.

2025
01:29:40,120 --> 01:29:42,640
Boys you give me great strength.

2026
01:29:42,640 --> 01:29:46,680
You have completed sector sector 17 Gibson Amplitheater.

2027
01:29:46,680 --> 01:29:50,600
And you put the L in it again.

2028
01:29:50,600 --> 01:29:51,600
It's OK.

2029
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:52,600
It's like Womp Hopper.

2030
01:29:52,600 --> 01:29:53,600
You're becoming more human.

2031
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:57,080
He's probably I think he has to birth the stones from his throat.

2032
01:29:57,080 --> 01:29:58,680
Right that makes a lot of sense.

2033
01:29:58,680 --> 01:29:59,680
He has two left.

2034
01:29:59,680 --> 01:30:00,680
Right.

2035
01:30:00,680 --> 01:30:03,080
And they're probably rumbling around right in there.

2036
01:30:03,080 --> 01:30:05,880
Marvel Mania and Saddle Ranch.

2037
01:30:05,880 --> 01:30:06,880
Yeah.

2038
01:30:06,880 --> 01:30:07,880
Yeah we did it.

2039
01:30:07,880 --> 01:30:09,880
And Victoria Station and Womp Hoppers.

2040
01:30:09,880 --> 01:30:10,880
Yeah.

2041
01:30:10,880 --> 01:30:13,560
And Tony Romer Star and Tony Romas.

2042
01:30:13,560 --> 01:30:14,560
Yeah.

2043
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:16,480
There was a lot there.

2044
01:30:16,480 --> 01:30:18,920
Yeah we're not getting out of this thing.

2045
01:30:18,920 --> 01:30:19,920
No.

2046
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:22,480
These have been jam packed sectors.

2047
01:30:22,480 --> 01:30:25,440
We didn't even talk Nick you've been working up around here.

2048
01:30:25,440 --> 01:30:26,440
That's right.

2049
01:30:26,440 --> 01:30:28,560
So what are like what are now your experiences before we go.

2050
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:29,560
Oh sure.

2051
01:30:29,560 --> 01:30:33,440
Of like we're living and working and playing as Jimmy Buffa would say.

2052
01:30:33,440 --> 01:30:40,480
And we we write write our office looks looks down on the tram tour.

2053
01:30:40,480 --> 01:30:41,480
Who's are who do you mean.

2054
01:30:41,480 --> 01:30:42,480
Oh what's that.

2055
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:43,480
Yeah.

2056
01:30:43,480 --> 01:30:44,480
Who do you mean.

2057
01:30:44,480 --> 01:30:45,480
You mean we.

2058
01:30:45,480 --> 01:30:47,480
Myself and writing partner Anthony Geo.

2059
01:30:47,480 --> 01:30:48,480
I think you're friends with him.

2060
01:30:48,480 --> 01:30:49,480
Oh Pascale said the show.

2061
01:30:49,480 --> 01:30:50,480
We haven't seen him in a while.

2062
01:30:50,480 --> 01:30:51,480
Yeah.

2063
01:30:51,480 --> 01:30:52,480
I wish.

2064
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:53,480
Yeah.

2065
01:30:53,480 --> 01:30:54,480
We should get him back.

2066
01:30:54,480 --> 01:30:56,880
But there was just a funny instance because you know the tram stops and it's where like

2067
01:30:56,880 --> 01:31:02,760
they play like the like Jimmy Fallon makes a joke about how he wishes Jurassic Park was

2068
01:31:02,760 --> 01:31:05,480
or I don't know whatever it's like this like there's this like video section but there's

2069
01:31:05,480 --> 01:31:10,520
that stop is right outside and what happened is a tram stopped and they were shooting right

2070
01:31:10,520 --> 01:31:15,920
beside it and so the cast of SWAT came out and shakes everyone's hand on the on the tram

2071
01:31:15,920 --> 01:31:18,200
right there fucking stoked out of their minds.

2072
01:31:18,200 --> 01:31:19,880
They can't believe everyone has their cameras out.

2073
01:31:19,880 --> 01:31:20,880
They're shaking hands.

2074
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:23,480
They're like really being really good about it.

2075
01:31:23,480 --> 01:31:27,240
But what happens is that tram takes off and there's the tram right behind it that I think

2076
01:31:27,240 --> 01:31:28,880
they think the same thing is going to happen.

2077
01:31:28,880 --> 01:31:30,360
They come up and SWAT.

2078
01:31:30,360 --> 01:31:33,040
It's like no of course this was just like one time.

2079
01:31:33,040 --> 01:31:38,360
The second tram who has seen everything comes up stops and it's just like the saddest.

2080
01:31:38,360 --> 01:31:39,360
So disappointed.

2081
01:31:39,360 --> 01:31:40,360
It's SWAT.

2082
01:31:40,360 --> 01:31:41,360
It's She-Mart Moore.

2083
01:31:41,360 --> 01:31:48,360
And Kenny Johnson.

2084
01:31:48,360 --> 01:31:54,520
Sector keeper when you're free and when these when this 19 part series is a giant award

2085
01:31:54,520 --> 01:32:00,680
winning smash you need to go make like the cast of SWAT and go say hi to a tram.

2086
01:32:00,680 --> 01:32:02,040
They'll flip out.

2087
01:32:02,040 --> 01:32:06,200
I don't think you're going to arrive when you are alive again you'll arrive to a world

2088
01:32:06,200 --> 01:32:12,040
where this was received unbelievably and where you're a household name and household face.

2089
01:32:12,040 --> 01:32:16,800
Oh I would be so happy as long as God allows it.

2090
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:18,000
He will.

2091
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:23,560
He needs you to share your joy just as as John Paul the second shared his joy across

2092
01:32:23,560 --> 01:32:25,480
the Papal space bridge.

2093
01:32:25,480 --> 01:32:28,760
You're going to bring I think you know we've been you haven't experienced this but the

2094
01:32:28,760 --> 01:32:32,840
last couple of years in this country have just been a mess and I think you sector keeper

2095
01:32:32,840 --> 01:32:35,120
might be the key to solving all of it.

2096
01:32:35,120 --> 01:32:37,120
Oh I would love that.

2097
01:32:37,120 --> 01:32:42,720
Either way you could be our savior or you could be the Antichrist and you could bring

2098
01:32:42,720 --> 01:32:43,720
about the Antichrist.

2099
01:32:43,720 --> 01:32:45,720
Either way the problem gets solved.

2100
01:32:45,720 --> 01:32:50,960
Well if we all have a belly full of Daddy Yankee's ribs everything's going to be okay.

2101
01:32:50,960 --> 01:32:55,640
All right give us a little hint about which direction it's going to go.

2102
01:32:55,640 --> 01:33:02,240
Grace yeah yeah maybe and you know if we live each day like it like it's the last and if

2103
01:33:02,240 --> 01:33:09,800
we're you know you know striving for desserts of the quality of Blastar's ballistic Butterfinger

2104
01:33:09,800 --> 01:33:15,840
bread pudding then I think it's I think it's all going to be all right.

2105
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:17,160
Nick where can people find you?

2106
01:33:17,160 --> 01:33:20,760
You can find me on Twitter at Mandar Nick.

2107
01:33:20,760 --> 01:33:24,120

2109
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:26,560
Have you ever seen them?

2110
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:28,560
Oh you can't oh I'm so I'm so sorry.

2111
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:30,360
No you can't see improv anymore.

2112
01:33:30,360 --> 01:33:32,560
He's missed the improv boom in general.

2113
01:33:32,560 --> 01:33:33,560
Wait yes.

2114
01:33:33,560 --> 01:33:36,760
It might be over though by the time this is over.

2115
01:33:36,760 --> 01:33:43,640
Yes UCB Gangnam style it's all coming back to me.

2116
01:33:43,640 --> 01:33:48,000
You're probably seeing the the UCB TV show but and maybe one of the theaters but they

2117
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:49,000
have several now.

2118
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:50,000
Oh.

2119
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,720
Yes so you'll get to experience all of those.

2120
01:33:52,720 --> 01:33:58,280
The target probably won't quite be done over on Western by the time he's you're alive but

2121
01:33:58,280 --> 01:34:01,840
a lot to look forward to no matter what.

2122
01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:04,520
Well we did it we're on the way out.

2123

Best of luck to you on those final two stems.

2127
01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:11,160

2128
01:34:11,160 --> 01:34:12,160

01:34:33,120 --> 01:34:34,120
last two issues.

2141
01:34:34,120 --> 01:34:38,720
Odysseus has almost returned to Ithaca to claim his rightful place.

2142
01:34:38,720 --> 01:34:41,440
I forgot to mention another one of these desserts real quick.

2143
