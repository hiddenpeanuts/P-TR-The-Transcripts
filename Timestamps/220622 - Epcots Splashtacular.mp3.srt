1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,240
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, The Second Gate,

3
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,080
a show where we are proud to present a celebration

4
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:30,440
of the power and grandeur of some of the more

5
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,680
off the beaten path theme park attractions.

6
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:35,120
I'm Jason Sherrod and Scott Gerner here.

7
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,200
That was so serious.

8
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,040
So soft.

9
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:37,880
It scared me.

10
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,200
Thought you were about to announce something really sad.

11
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,520
Mike Carlson also here.

12
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,360
Hello.

13
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,760
Must announce the demise of Michael Eisner.

14
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,960
Trying, I was trying to summon the narrator,

15
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,840
the narrator that you only hear for 10 seconds.

16
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:52,680
Oh yeah.

17
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:53,500
On Tiffany's topic.

18
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:54,520
Ah sure, yeah, yeah.

19
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,760
And it is about power and grandeur.

20
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,560
Power and grandeur and the,

21
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,880
I guess the power of splitting the difference

22
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:05,520
on the topics you're talking about.

23
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,480
Checking a lot of boxes.

24
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,920
Water and color.

25
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,040
We're talking splash-tacular, Epcot splash-tacular.

26
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:15,600
Yeah, and here's one where there'll be listeners who know

27
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,040
and there'll be listeners who do not know at all.

28
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:21,240
And this is one where I gotta say get educated

29
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,640
and we'll help you get educated.

30
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,680
This is bonkers.

31
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,720
This is a show that ran at Epcot Center in 1993

32
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:33,160
and therefore spent most of its runtime

33
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:36,800
in not Epcot Center but rather Epcot 94.

34
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:40,080
Something we've spent too short of time

35
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,920
talking about, the brief window where the idea was

36
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,840
Epcot's gonna be a new, they'll change it every year

37
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,280
to Epcot 94, 95 and that was it I think.

38
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,280
It stopped there.

39
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,800
There was no Epcot 96.

40
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,360
Well the millennium was coming

41
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,000
and they had to melt that for a while.

42
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,600
We all turned our eyes to that.

43
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:00,920
But this is peak Epcot 94 I think, this attraction.

44
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,640
It is but that very same narrator

45
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,920
does refer to Epcot Center.

46
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,760
Oh, so they weren't even.

47
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,240
He doesn't say Epcot 94.

48
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,560
Little messy still.

49
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,320
Little messy, yeah.

50
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,360
I mean that's kind of part of the charms of this.

51
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,720
The show rocks.

52
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,560
It is very messy.

53
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,480
Yeah, I really like it.

54
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,040
For once I feel like I got an explanation.

55
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,280
I figured it out.

56
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,200
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

57
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,920
And it is.

58
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,160
The backstory helps you piece together.

59
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,000
The backstory.

60
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,080
Why is there this, there's a real paper trail

61
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,080
for how we landed here.

62
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,320
Let me just, it's not often that we have really good

63
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,720
just summaries done for us.

64
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:43,240
But in this case there's a great ad

65
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:47,040
that was posted by Retro WDW and this,

66
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,960
all right, so this tells you the story.

67
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,040
Will it help you understand it?

68
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,280
Maybe not exactly.

69
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,560
Did you guys see this ad?

70
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,400
I did, yeah.

71
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,480
I'll spin it to Mike if you, okay.

72
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,320
I think I did.

73
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,160
Here we go.

74
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:02,480
The aliens imaginable have arrived.

75
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,960
There's something we have that they want.

76
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,920
Something you can find only at Epcot.

77
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,600
Introducing Splashtacular,

78
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,280
a brilliant new world of leaping fountains

79
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,000
and Disney magic.

80
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,080
Splashtacular, it's magical, it's wonderful.

81
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,760
But how long will it be ours?

82
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,640
Find out for yourself at Epcot.

83
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,760
Yeah, wow, that's exciting.

84
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,320
That's a real trailer.

85
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:36,360
They have something, or wait, we have something they want.

86
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,480
Yeah.

87
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,960
Now the narration doesn't really tell you

88
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,680
what we're dealing with specifically,

89
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,360
which we can keep to, it's basically,

90
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,920
there's an intergalactic battle that happens to play out

91
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,200
and interrupts what is supposed to be

92
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,480
just a fun celebration with Mickey and his friends

93
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,480
of the beautiful Epcot fountain and the idea of color

94
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,080
and who could ever want to destroy such a sacred,

95
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,640
easygoing event as that.

96
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,720
Well, these villains who will still,

97
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:08,000
we can unfurl them as we go because boy.

98
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,600
But that's basically what we're dealing with.

99
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,440
Yeah.

100
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,800
A battle between good and evil.

101
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,280
And if you don't know what that looks like,

102
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,040
I don't blame you, I guess.

103
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

104
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,720
Can I just say it except I want to roll,

105
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,200
I want to give all of these characters.

106
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,360
Yeah, yeah, you want to walk through a little bit.

107
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,520
The big red carpet welcome.

108
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:30,440
Yeah, there's one picture, a notable picture.

109
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,200
Yeah, that's a promo picture of it.

110
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:37,200
Yeah, of dancers and chrome Tom of Finland guys

111
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:41,520
and a couple of villains and the space bar

112
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,960
in the background, the fountain's going off.

113
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,360
If you search Epcot splash tag,

114
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,320
this picture will come up immediately.

115
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,560
I will say, yeah, if you're not,

116
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,720
say if you're somebody who just listens

117
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,120
and doesn't look at these photos,

118
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,840
I got immediate Captain EO vibes from some of this,

119
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,800
some of the costumes.

120
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,720
Extremely, like a live Captain EO

121
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,920
a little bit after the fact.

122
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,760
Yeah. Yeah.

123
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,480
From the, yeah, the villainess and the,

124
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:11,520
you know, we got a lot of like silver dancers

125
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,120
slash guard warrior types.

126
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,480
Mickey's honor guard.

127
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,320
Yeah.

128
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,880
Mickey storm troopers.

129
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,520
I mean, that's the.

130
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,480
Mickey's chrome storm troopers.

131
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:27,480
Mickey has people in chrome Mickey faced shaped

132
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,680
like bulletproof chrome vests and knee pads.

133
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,520
Yeah.

134
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,640
Every bit of that, they turn around

135
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,960
and you could see that their boots

136
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,080
are studded with Mickey heads.

137
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,040
They're on stilts.

138
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,720
So they have long legs, which is a rich,

139
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,800
has room enough to put, to stack like three

140
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,000
chrome Mickey heads.

141
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,120
That's just on the back of the legs.

142
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,120
How many Mickey heads per soldier?

143
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,640
I mean, at least 20.

144
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,480
Yeah.

145
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,000
This is a peek into the future in like 10 years

146
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,600
when Bob Chapek like somehow buys the US government

147
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,440
and we're all under the rule of Disney

148
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,840
and the Disney police are policing the streets

149
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,600
in these chrome Mickey outfits.

150
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,440
And that's the.

151
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,400
These will be the uniforms of who goes and invades,

152
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,480
you know, Abu Dhabi, Dubai, like the places

153
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,280
where they have non Disney theme parks.

154
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,200
Disney will mount invasions, will slowly take them over

155
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,600
and there will be no more Flintstones boat ride.

156
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,440
Right.

157
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,280
Like that.

158
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,100
That's ours.

159
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:26,940
Those are Mickey heads now.

160
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:27,780
Right.

161
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:28,600
Yeah.

162
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,440
So yeah, these are, I will say these are cool outfits.

163
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,280
Yeah.

164
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,440
I really like these outfits.

165
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,960
I like a lot of this.

166
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,040
Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure.

167
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:36,880
I agree.

168
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,720
It's great.

169
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,680
It's weird.

170
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,000
I, there's a Disney fandom page for this

171
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,560
that actually does a pretty good job of summing it up too.

172
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,560
And I think one of the things I was kind of thinking about

173
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:53,720
again, that I got an answer for is a guy complains on it.

174
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:57,400
It's like, some of this looks like ripoff Power Rangers.

175
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,960
And there's kind of a reason for that.

176
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,720
Oh, I don't think I know the kind of reason.

177
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,560
Interesting.

178
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,560
It is around the time of Power Rangers starting,

179
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,680
but it also goes back to like, well, a lot of this is from

180
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,240
the Tokyo Disney 10th anniversary show, It's Magical.

181
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,080
Yeah.

182
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,360
A lot of it kind of poured it over, possibly flown over

183
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:24,720
and then tweaked a bit, tweaked a little.

184
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,560
Yeah.

185
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,680
It was a 10th anniversary Tokyo show

186
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,720
that they took a lot of the elements from.

187
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:34,160
Yes. And like so much else, you can find a better quality

188
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,480
of the Tokyo version.

189
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:39,560
The video of It's Magical is very good quality.

190
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,560
Yeah. There's this channel.

191
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,280
We got to dive into this channel that's all pro shot

192
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,440
and somehow has professionally,

193
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,640
clearly from Disney footage,

194
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,080
pristine, perfect footage of these.

195
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:54,880
It's all stage shows at Tokyo Disneyland,

196
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,920
but then also Disney Sea who they,

197
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:00,960
every year they mount a new massive thing on the lagoon

198
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,240
with so many boats that have to be coordinated

199
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:09,200
and planes flying kites past.

200
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,520
Those things are so mega scales.

201
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,040
We got to watch a lot, I think on this channel.

202
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,440
Yeah. I think the best,

203
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,880
I watched a couple of Splash-tacular videos

204
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,560
and there's a lot where people set up a camera

205
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,520
on a tripod seemingly, but far away

206
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,760
and it's hard to figure out what's going on,

207
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:29,160
but there's the user Sean Locke uploaded a video called

208
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:34,160
1994 Disney Spectacular Fountain Show at, it cuts off,

209
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,680
but it's got like 6,200 views.

210
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:40,240
That's a pretty good like cut.

211
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,160
I think they videotaped the last day,

212
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,840
a couple of the last day shows of Splash-tacular

213
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,400
and then cut it together.

214
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,400
Okay, okay. Yeah. Yeah.

215
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,320
There are pretty good, that isn't just one long take

216
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,680
that they've, well, but I knew this from,

217
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,360
because they did a filmed cut down version

218
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,320
on a very Merry Christmas parade in 1993.

219
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,840
That's why I knew about the Splash-tacular show.

220
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,400
So it's one of those Regis parades

221
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:13,880
and they throw over to Epcot 94, it's almost 1994

222
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:17,160
and they go to Bill Nye, the science guy.

223
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:21,120
Bill Nye is in like a yellow rain slicker

224
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,320
and he's in the other, he's in a different Epcot fountain

225
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,440
and he's getting wet and he's trying to tell you about

226
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,960
Epcot Splash-tacular and Epcot 94

227
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,440
and you're like, boy, does Disney just have this guy

228
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,200
in a vice at this point?

229
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,640
Whatever they want, he will say

230
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,480
that solar energy isn't ready.

231
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,400
He doesn't give a shit.

232
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,600
He'll talk about this weird Splash show.

233
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,520
Cash the check bill.

234
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:46,120
Yeah, yeah, whatever they ask.

235
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,720
So, and then they do a really great cut down

236
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,160
and when you, look, it's fun to watch

237
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,360
the 20 minute version of this,

238
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,080
but when it all unfurls over the course

239
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,800
of a minute and a half, it's so bonkers.

240
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,440
It's like, wait a minute, where are we?

241
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,920
Okay, it's fountain and then it's,

242
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:02,000
they're singing about colors, red, yellow and blue

243
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:05,640
and then how quickly do you turn a corner to guards

244
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:09,360
and stomp, stomp, stomp, scary girl Mickey guards.

245
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,920
Oh my God, it is such a whiplash

246
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,240
because there's like, you've seen tropes

247
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,160
from all of these shows in different media.

248
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,920
Obviously it starts out with, like you imagine

249
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,840
like a cheesy Disney singing dance show

250
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:26,280
and then there's a hard left until the guards.

251
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,120
Yeah.

252
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,880
Oh, guards, there's an alien here

253
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,760
and then it turns into Power Rangers.

254
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,080
It's such a wild, drastic shift.

255
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,840
Yeah, yeah.

256
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,680
Which is good.

257
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,840
Watching this, watching it on the special,

258
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,720
it left an, I believe I had a vacation,

259
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,880
maybe I didn't know yet.

260
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,240
No, no, no, I think I went to Disney World the next year,

261
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,960
but Splashtacular remained fused in my brain the whole time

262
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,120
and spoiler, it didn't make it.

263
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,720
It made it seven months.

264
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,240
So this thing was not available to see by the next Christmas,

265
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,520
but I didn't know that.

266
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:04,640
So I got to Epcot and my first thought was,

267
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,680
where do I see that crazy show with the chrome Mickey guards

268
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,000
and the big, and the creature,

269
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,120
I won't reveal the creature yet.

270
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,960
But I was so, and I was like, I didn't quite remember the name.

271
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,440
So I'm just like looking at every map.

272
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,480
Is there some show?

273
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,360
I may have even made my parents ask,

274
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,240
can you ask if there's still the show with the guards?

275
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,360
Tell them I want to see the guard show.

276
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,360
And they don't think, I don't think Disney employees

277
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,560
knew what I was talking about.

278
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,080
They were told, don't ever bring it up again.

279
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,560
Do not answer questions about Splashtacular.

280
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,520
But it was a distinct disappointment to me

281
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,120
on my second ever trip to Disney World

282
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,560
that I didn't get to see this live.

283
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:41,200
That's crazy, cause this was not on my radar at all.

284
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,960
Was it before we brought it up?

285
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,080
No, I don't think so.

286
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:44,920
I think Jason's totally-

287
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:45,760
I think Jason's totally,

288
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,000
cause you were excited, I would say.

289
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,840
Yeah, I caught a little of it,

290
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,840
I think like six months ago or so.

291
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,680
Okay, okay.

292
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,520
I saw the picture first and then I saw clips of it.

293
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,960
But you didn't know when you were a kid.

294
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,680
No, I didn't know it as a kid.

295
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,320
Again, I was just thrilled at free Sega games

296
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,720
to try out the inventions.

297
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,800
That was one of the things,

298
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,920
cause this went like end of the year 1993

299
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,120
to start of summer 1994.

300
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:13,760
Not typically a time theme parks close attractions,

301
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,920
the start of the summer season.

302
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,000
Oh sure, yeah, yeah.

303
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,600
Cause anything that eats people you want to,

304
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,720
but it wasn't working.

305
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,560
I don't know what happened.

306
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,840
When no one was watching it, I guess.

307
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,680
I decided to get rid of it.

308
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,640
I would have then.

309
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,760
From the fandom, this I thought was interesting.

310
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,160
Though intended as an exciting new offering

311
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,560
to rejuvenate Epcot's attendance,

312
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,240
it would be quickly scrapped when management decided

313
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,400
it clashed with the modern cutting edge image

314
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,800
of the newly opened Innoventions.

315
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,020
Couple things there.

316
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,960
Innoventions, a famously aesthetically consistent area.

317
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,240
Not a big weird mess.

318
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,040
Also fountain shows,

319
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:59,440
not exactly a huge driver of attendance.

320
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,280
Yeah, if that was their plan.

321
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,400
Pavilion maybe, like new InnoVent,

322
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,440
we were all like, oh cool, what's this?

323
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,200
You know, kind of.

324
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,900
Sometimes it's very simple.

325
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:10,160
New rides drive attendance.

326
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,000
That's it.

327
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,800
Like do that.

328
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

329
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:18,940
So yeah, not getting all these costumes from Tokyo.

330
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,640
So, well maybe to explain that transition a little more

331
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,160
and this is brought up,

332
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,640
user RobPlays did a YouTube video about this.

333
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,560
That's pretty good.

334
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,500
So sort of what, the Tokyo version

335
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,240
was kind of a post-Fantasmic

336
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,560
where Mickey has a celebration he's trying to do,

337
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,440
but in this case, literally, Maleficent,

338
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,560
as in Fantasmic, shows up.

339
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,840
There's a lot of magic involved.

340
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,820
It was called it's magical and there were magic tricks,

341
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:48,640
like Mickey's elevated in a big cage that's empty

342
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,480
and then a flash and then Mickey's in it.

343
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,800
Or Maleficent appears up in the castle,

344
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,760
but then puff up smoke and then she's down at the bottom.

345
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,080
So they had a second one waiting down there.

346
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:02,160
And then the drag, she turns into a dragon

347
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,840
and that's your big show stopper, just like Fantasmic,

348
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,560
appears up out of the stage.

349
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,760
Then a big Mickey balloon unfurls at the end.

350
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,600
It's pretty good.

351
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,600
The band version's great.

352
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,760
And it still has the guards.

353
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:16,320
So the guards were an innovate and it makes it make sense.

354
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,320
Like the weirdness of it, when you think of it

355
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,880
is through the prism of Japanese weirdness.

356
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,000
Like, okay, totally.

357
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,840
You're right.

358
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:25,960
And it may be, and how that can not translate the best

359
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,880
to Florida. Right.

360
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:31,000
The genre name is Tokusatsu.

361
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,120
And that refers to like, not the genre name of the show,

362
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:38,720
but like Power Rangers, Common Rider, Common Rider,

363
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,720
other Godzilla movies, you know,

364
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,720
Sci-Fi special effects shows could be like,

365
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:50,400
superhero shows or monster shows or magic girl show,

366
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,360
you know, those sorts of things.

367
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:55,880
And it very much has that vibe.

368
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,640
Totally. The costumes and stuff.

369
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,480
Yeah, seriously.

370
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:03,480
Maybe even more so in Splashtacular than It's Magical.

371
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,160
Yeah, because what it,

372
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,360
basically what happens in the translation,

373
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,120
and as Rob breaks down,

374
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,680
this is a show done in front of the castle

375
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,920
and it's with characters from Sleeping Beauty

376
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,480
with fairy tale characters.

377
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,760
But now we've decided to port this over to Future World

378
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,240
in Epcot, where you can't do Maleficent

379
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:28,000
and these characters, where you have like a shorthand

380
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,000
of this is a witch that I know from the fantasy movies.

381
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,640
And I know the dragon, I've seen this before.

382
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:38,840
They have to keep going into the Sci-Fi direction,

383
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,800
away from the fantasy direction,

384
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,640
which requires them to invent a lot more.

385
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:47,320
And the inventions are probably what made it bad for them

386
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:50,440
at the time, but it makes it great for us now.

387
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,240
Perfect. Right in our wheelhouse.

388
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,360
Oh, so exciting.

389
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,360
Who you get to meet some real, this is boy,

390
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:00,120
custom IP for this one seven month show.

391
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:03,200
Has it, well, I was gonna say has it in spades,

392
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,760
but then also it's not the most fleshed out.

393
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,600
No.

394
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,080
In one case, literally not.

395
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,840
Yeah, it's not, I mean, I do think like Leonardo Columbus,

396
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,800
who we've discovered in our past episode

397
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,120
might be a little more fleshed out than a lot of this stuff.

398
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:18,960
But.

399
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,720
But very much a piece.

400
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,560
But yeah.

401
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,360
It's very Leonardo Columbus-y.

402
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,200
Yeah.

403
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,640
But also, yeah, and also as far as like talking about

404
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:30,400
why it went away, it does still feel a little old.

405
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:34,240
It feels like, I looked it up, Starlight Express also.

406
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,720
It feels like Starlight Express.

407
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,560
Oh boy.

408
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,040
Why have we not fully, we gotta do Starlight Express.

409
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,680
I really don't know a lot about that.

410
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,520
I don't either.

411
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,360
I know.

412
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,200
I know a little, but I don't know a ton.

413
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,880
I know about trains, I know trains are involved,

414
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,360
I know roller skates are involved.

415
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,200
I can't imagine that was.

416
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,040
That's about all I got.

417
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,960
You as a kid, as a train enthusiast,

418
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:52,800
you wouldn't have been like,

419
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,760
I wanna see the musical about the human trains.

420
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:58,760
I'll tell you when I kinda, like two ships passing

421
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,640
in the night just missing each other, you know,

422
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:05,360
why Starlight Express story is that a teacher,

423
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:08,640
when I was in high school, it's my freshman English teacher

424
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:11,440
for a number of years before, for a few years in a row,

425
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:16,440
had taken students on like a week long excursion to London.

426
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,120
And I thought this idea sounded so cool.

427
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:22,240
And she's like, I think I'm gonna do it again next year.

428
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,760
And I was so excited by the idea.

429
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,960
Like she showed the itinerary, like, you know,

430
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,400
what it would be like, about how much it would cost,

431
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,560
every sample, itineraries, one of which was

432
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:36,080
a showing of Starlight Express.

433
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:36,920
Oh, yes.

434
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:40,280
Oh, a musical in the West End, like great.

435
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,120
Wow.

436
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,240
And then did not have enough interest.

437
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,040
So I had to real scramble real quick

438
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:50,040
and sign up for the like trip to DC that every schmuck took.

439
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,040
Yeah, boring.

440
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,840
Really boring if you live two hours from DC

441
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,280
and I've been there three or four times as an adolescent.

442
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:03,040
Now I just get to do it with worse accommodations

443
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,420
with kids I don't like.

444
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:06,260
That's okay.

445
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:08,100
Well, we're gonna learn about Starlight Express

446
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:11,700
and the young but obsolete steam engine Rusty

447
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:16,380
who wants to impress the first class observation car Pearl.

448
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:17,220
Oh my God.

449
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,700
Yeah, why have we not gone deeper?

450
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:22,100
Andrew Lloyd Webber was just so powerful at that time.

451
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,100
I feel like, right?

452
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:23,940
It was him?

453
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:24,780
Yeah.

454
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:25,620
Okay.

455
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:26,440
Yeah.

456
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,280
Oh, so crazy.

457
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,260
Okay, but we got our own awesome Chrome IP here,

458
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:33,900
which is the, so one thing to know

459
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,620
right off the top is that a lot of the show

460
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:41,620
involves Mickey navigating a sparkly cherry picker.

461
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:43,580
He's in a-

462
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:46,220
As if he was going to fix some power lines.

463
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,060
Yeah.

464
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,540
He is in a cherry picker.

465
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:50,420
I'm sitting alone watching it.

466
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:54,300
I said out loud to myself, is that a cherry picker?

467
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:57,280
This is unique to the American production.

468
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,120
Yes.

469
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:58,960
Not in Japan.

470
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,300
No, that had a magic trick.

471
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,580
This one has a crane that he's riding around

472
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:05,060
with pushing a joystick around.

473
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:08,220
Even Copperfield magic trick on cherry picker in its place.

474
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:11,460
Some crows were gnawing on these power lines again.

475
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,380
I'm gonna get up there and fix it.

476
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:18,180
So yeah, with these though,

477
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:20,580
he doesn't end up doing any electrical work.

478
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:25,180
He does go up there to turn on the fountain.

479
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:26,020
Conduct the fountain.

480
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:28,220
I mean, does he, I guess he turns it on and conducts it.

481
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:30,660
Again, it's sort of, I mean, what excited me about it

482
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:33,900
because I love Fantasmic so much as a kid.

483
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:36,700
So I was like, oh, they have one in Epcot now

484
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:39,100
that's custom and it's futuristic.

485
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:39,940
That sounds great.

486
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:42,180
So just buying it on face value and that's what it is.

487
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,460
Oh my God, I got to see it.

488
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:44,860
So, and it's Mickey conducting.

489
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:47,140
He's experimenting with something goes awry.

490
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:51,540
And it's kind of that, but yeah, he waves his arms.

491
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:55,700
If you want to see Mickey conduct, you get to see that.

492
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:56,620
He does do that.

493
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:59,940
The fountain built for this, right?

494
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:00,780
Was it?

495
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:01,600
Was it?

496
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,940
Or at least upgraded?

497
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,460
You know it, you've all seen it.

498
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:06,860
It's the fountain of nations is what they call it now.

499
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:08,740
Yeah, from Boy Meets World.

500
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:09,580
Yeah.

501
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:10,420
Boy Meets World episode.

502
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:13,900
And the lights and the splash,

503
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:17,500
like the shooting, dancing waters were,

504
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:20,020
I believe put in for this show.

505
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,780
That stuck around.

506
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:25,420
I think they had it in 82.

507
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:28,420
It looks like, again, I'm pulling up this research now.

508
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:29,660
I thought the body of water,

509
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:32,900
I don't know the capabilities of the body of water before.

510
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:35,060
I thought that the water was there before,

511
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:35,880
but I could be wrong.

512
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:40,020
I think what I saw was that if it was there before,

513
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:43,420
everything, the upgrades done to the fountain

514
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:45,860
stuck around for the show.

515
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:46,700
They weren't might be it.

516
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:49,780
Doing shows with it till 93 is what this,

517
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:50,620
which might be this.

518
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:51,440
So it could be that.

519
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,780
It might be, yeah, there was a fountain,

520
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:53,940
but it didn't do all this stuff.

521
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:56,100
So they probably enhanced it.

522
00:20:56,100 --> 00:21:01,100
So Nicky's showing us what the fountain can do.

523
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,940
There's a song about how it gets.

524
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,060
Shoot water up in the air.

525
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,340
Yeah, which is one thing that the fountain

526
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,900
could do is shoot water around.

527
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,460
And that is the one thing.

528
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:09,420
Yeah.

529
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:10,460
Join in.

530
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:12,340
It's, there's a song called,

531
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:13,880
they say join in a lot.

532
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,840
And there's a lines like, it's Disney magic.

533
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,740
Everything's going great.

534
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:21,380
That's nice.

535
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:23,300
That's what Bob J. Beck listens to every morning.

536
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,940
Debatable, yeah.

537
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:26,420
Well at the time, you know,

538
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:28,260
hey, this is pretty Frank Wells dying.

539
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:29,700
I think everything was going great.

540
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:30,580
Yeah.

541
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:34,300
They do like sing like the fountain shoots in sync

542
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,700
with like red, yellow, blue.

543
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,640
The show is done in broad daylight.

544
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,140
So you cannot see if there's colored lighting.

545
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:42,180
You can't see it.

546
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,020
Yeah. Yeah.

547
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:45,180
That's a curious choice about it.

548
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,220
Yeah. Then we get into the color separate.

549
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:50,420
Okay. So fountain, but let's celebrate color.

550
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:52,100
And then all the characters come out

551
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:55,500
and much brighter kind of your neon Crayola there.

552
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,740
It's, you know, it's super bright green

553
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:01,700
and Minnie's in an extra pink, pink.

554
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:05,140
And Donald's got a bigger blue hat than normal.

555
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:06,580
It's like bigger and flatter.

556
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:07,420
Yeah.

557
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:10,620
And then, so in the Tokyo one,

558
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,940
all they had to do was have them in the bright clothes

559
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:13,860
and that's the change,

560
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:15,780
but here they had to space-ify them too.

561
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:18,680
So Minnie is in kind of like a hoop dress,

562
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:22,080
like a Jane Jetson sort of thing.

563
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:26,120
And so on top, and then Chip and Dale

564
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:30,600
wear these weird hats that to me look like unfurled condoms.

565
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,760
Okay.

566
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,120
Just kind of these odd, these domes

567
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,800
make them look real dopey.

568
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:39,840
They sing a really aggressive verse about green.

569
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,440
They all kind of represent a color.

570
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,600
They're all really, everybody picks a color.

571
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,200
And like, as if like a mock trial or debate,

572
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,240
they like make a case why this color is the best.

573
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:52,080
And in Japan, Donald and Goofy really go at it

574
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,800
of like orange versus yellow, I feel like.

575
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:59,480
But so in Epcot, again, what I alluded to

576
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,600
with splitting the difference,

577
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:04,160
the Japan show just about color, the magic of color.

578
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:07,920
The Epcot show is about, again, to quote the narrator,

579
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,680
the power and grandeur of water,

580
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,680
the most phenomenal element in our world.

581
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:15,600
You know, water abounds with life

582
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:18,520
and in its movement and reflective qualities

583
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:21,520
are found all the colors of the rainbow.

584
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,000
So kind of splitting the difference,

585
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,160
it's about water and also colors

586
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,640
and water isn't really mentioned again.

587
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,480
No.

588
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,320
It's jumping.

589
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,960
Water gives us color, colors in water.

590
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:38,440
Well, sometimes, especially if there's like oil in it

591
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,720
and it's got that glisten.

592
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,560
That's true.

593
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:43,800
Or if yeah, you dye the lake green on St. Patrick's Day.

594
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:44,640
Sure.

595
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:49,440
This water in this show does not have color.

596
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,040
People have colors in front of the water.

597
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:55,600
Describing its movement and reflective qualities

598
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,400
is like, all right, you've done too many drafts.

599
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,040
You've written too many drafts.

600
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,720
Go back to the second one,

601
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,720
because that does not sound human.

602
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,800
Well, this is all kind of underscoring Mickey

603
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,440
just sort of calmly walking into position

604
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:11,960
like a conductor starting an orchestra show.

605
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,760
Yeah, and he hooks himself to the cherry picker.

606
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,880
Yeah, gotta get that hook around.

607
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,000
Ricky can't fall.

608
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,400
That'd be, the show's canceled immediately.

609
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,960
The cherry picker does look a little shaky though.

610
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:23,800
He's conducting.

611
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,720
I'm like, it is, I mean,

612
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,040
I know it's supposed to bob a little bit,

613
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,640
but it is moving.

614
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,320
I was a little, that would stress me out.

615
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,640
And the bad guy goes up in it later, I think?

616
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,480
Yes, she does.

617
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah, there's a switch.

618
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:39,040
So they're talking about colors.

619
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,000
There's these dance,

620
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,520
the dancers are also chrome.

621
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,360
I call them the drop heads.

622
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,600
The women have kind of a,

623
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:53,600
it's sort of like a full plush thing on their head

624
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,160
that gives them the shape of a drop.

625
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,960
But it also looks like a kind of a bat,

626
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,240
like if you bought a Halloween store, cone heads.

627
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,320
Yes, it looks like cone heads.

628
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,440
That's what I, yes.

629
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,480
That was my feeling.

630
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,440
They're silver cone heads.

631
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,280
Silver cone heads.

632
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,560
So that's strange.

633
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:10,680
They, also everybody talks as if they're getting

634
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:13,520
on a spaceship, like Minnie says,

635
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,720
greeting space travelers.

636
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,560
Yeah, oh yeah, that's so weird.

637
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,200
They're talking about space immediately

638
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,560
as if they're going somewhere to space.

639
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,920
Real quick about the look.

640
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,320
I realize now that all the dancers

641
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,720
look like LaLondra from X-Men.

642
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,840
Oh yeah.

643
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:28,680
Who's a professor at X-Men.

644
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,480
The Empress of the Shi'ar Empire.

645
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,840
The Empress of the Shi'ar Empire,

646
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:36,360
who is Charles Xavier's girlfriend at a certain point.

647
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:39,200
But she has a kind of a silver helmet

648
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,960
with like colors on the side of it.

649
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:41,800
Okay.

650
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,640
I'll look up a picture.

651
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,760
Could have been inspired.

652
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,320
So things are going great.

653
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,320
They're on a unmoving spaceship,

654
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,600
talking about water and color.

655
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:55,600
But then, there's like a boom over in the planter.

656
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:59,160
Just given the physical space of how they had to do this,

657
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:03,120
because it has to just be regular manicured Epcot grounds

658
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,160
during the day.

659
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:07,440
So off in the planter, like standing in the mulch,

660
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,800
there's an explosion and then it reveals,

661
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,800
how do you, pull up that photo if you have it.

662
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,640
How would you describe it?

663
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,520
How do you even begin to describe,

664
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:19,320
he's a lot like, there's stuff like this

665
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,240
in the Mario Brothers movie.

666
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,080
Right?

667
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,640
Where it's a big old head, body,

668
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,800
and then a tiny head.

669
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,880
Yeah, yeah.

670
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:30,640
It is like some of the more abstract illustrators,

671
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,320
or comic book artists draw Bane.

672
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:36,480
It is like Rob Liefeld, or like,

673
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,640
type, he's an artist from, he's still around.

674
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,480
He created Deadpool.

675
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,760
Like the most horrific table drawing you can find.

676
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:45,320
Just the biggest muscles and like the tiny heads,

677
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:48,920
and like this very 90s looking thing.

678
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:51,520
Yeah, and that, yeah, specifically that shot even looks

679
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:55,840
like it was, like I had X-Men cards that looked like that.

680
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:56,680
Yeah.

681
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:59,800
And so, and Matt, so yeah, he pops out of a planter

682
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,840
and like 20 feet away inside.

683
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,960
People are like on, huh?

684
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,320
I just wanted to underline a planter.

685
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,160
A planter.

686
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,360
A bunch of like plants.

687
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,200
Landscaping.

688
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,040
Yeah.

689
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,840
Yeah, I just, yeah, sorry to cut you off,

690
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,440
but I just wanted to underscore that there's,

691
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,920
it doesn't look like something should be coming

692
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:17,920
out of this area.

693
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,640
This just looks like a nondescript.

694
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,560
No, aliens landed in a planter.

695
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,520
Yeah.

696
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:26,520
Asymmetrically off to the side in Future World.

697
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,440
Yeah, like when everyone was doing drive-through

698
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:33,720
Halloween haunts, and like a Frankenstein would just burst

699
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:36,320
out of like a bunch of plants in a field

700
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,240
that they kind of set some cones up for you to drive through.

701
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,560
Like that's kind of what it looks like.

702
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:44,280
And then imagine inside the brand new interventions,

703
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:47,360
the redone communicor, people are on like the biggest

704
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,400
desktop computer you've ever seen.

705
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,360
And they're like, it's called the World Wide Web

706
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,400
and it's gonna revolutionize daily life.

707
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,240
What a time.

708
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,080
What a time.

709
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,440
I love Epcot 94.

710
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,280
Yeah.

711
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,120
Perfect place.

712
00:27:59,120 --> 00:27:59,960
Perfect place.

713
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,200
So this tiny, and he kind of shows up

714
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,840
and then just like shimmies.

715
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,800
That's all he does, right?

716
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,640
He just jigs around.

717
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,480
Yes.

718
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,320
Raba, baba, baba.

719
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:10,960
And then, but so the motion, he literally doesn't,

720
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,320
he's just their driver.

721
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:15,680
30 seconds of screen time, of stage time, basically.

722
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,280
Very cool design.

723
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,680
Get him out of here.

724
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:22,280
So the chauffeur, this intergalactic chauffeur

725
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:26,400
comes around, drops off a character.

726
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,960
What's the character?

727
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,880
There's, I believe that the, well, okay,

728
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,560
let's describe her first.

729
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,400
Yeah.

730
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,720
I wrote down the phrase condor woman.

731
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,760
If you remember the bombed dark era

732
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,160
Disney live action film Condorman.

733
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,440
It's kind of color wise and feather wise,

734
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:48,600
kind of like a condor woman, but also a space witch,

735
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,800
an evil sorceress.

736
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:53,440
Cosmic sorceress is the phrase that I saw.

737
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,280
Sorceress.

738
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,280
So you are already in the red.

739
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:59,120
I feel like you are already like, okay, it's,

740
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:03,520
it's a sorcerer and they come from space.

741
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,960
It could not be Maleficent.

742
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,960
Maleficent just couldn't show up at Epcot.

743
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:07,800
Yeah, just can't.

744
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:08,640
You can't.

745
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,240
These boundaries are drawn.

746
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,200
This will ruin everything.

747
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:16,600
Things can't be, Disney things can't be one thing over.

748
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:19,240
Peter Quill, not Epcot.

749
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:22,720
Mandalorian, not galaxy's edge.

750
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,040
Oh man, do you remember when the space empress

751
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,720
came to Epcot center?

752
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,320
Oh man, that was so awesome.

753
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:32,720
And do you remember also the color?

754
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,960
The characters were all talking about their favorite colors

755
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,920
like red and blue and man, that was so sweet.

756
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:41,080
Oh, I can't wait to go see the splash tackler.

757
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,120
He rules.

758
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,520
Oh, Mickey and a cherry picker?

759
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,340
Get out of here.

760
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:46,480
That was amazing.

761
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,720
I've heard there's a new place called Reflections Cafe.

762
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,080
I can't wait to eat what is surely one of the best

763
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,720
sandwiches I've ever had.

764
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,960
Oh man, the electric umbrella.

765
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,280
God, I can't wait to use that thing.

766
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:02,880
Well, Donald had a flatter, bigger hat.

767
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,760
I was so psyched about it.

768
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:07,800
I ate so many hand witches, I freaking puked.

769
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,920
If you don't know what we're, this is, we're kind of,

770
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:15,000
we have not been on the new Guardians ride yet.

771
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,240
But this is for the pre-show where they've

772
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,840
assuaged everyone's fears by saying,

773
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:21,200
there's gonna look, Epcot, the Guardians guys,

774
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,720
you've been to Epcot, okay?

775
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,960
So don't get mad that we're building it here.

776
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,520
Peter Quill grew up, loved it.

777
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,720
And then the evidence of that is this strange

778
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:32,200
teleprompter sequence with Chris Brett,

779
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,280
which I have to say is one of the only times,

780
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:37,080
we just kind of snarked about it on Twitter.

781
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,840
It's one of the only times in Podcasts that Ride's

782
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:41,640
social media history that I've seen reply guys

783
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,160
who do not follow us.

784
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,360
Oh man, the guy.

785
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,080
Get him in the mentions.

786
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,440
We are, I have heard as you approach 10,000 followers,

787
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,680
the app gets less usable.

788
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:55,440
And we are coming up on it.

789
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,040
But yeah, there's been a couple people recently

790
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:01,680
who have just missed the joke by a country mile.

791
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,280
The more, well, that's what happens on Twitter.

792
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:06,080
You start with a core of people, we're having fun, right?

793
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,160
You understand jokes and that things are said

794
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,480
in jest and ironically and that the purpose

795
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:14,000
of this platform is not to lay out a bunch of facts

796
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,840
and proof and evidence and that is all that you do here.

797
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:22,360
Yeah, it's like, sorry, yeah, sorry he doesn't know

798
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:24,880
about Epcot, like a bunch of 30 year old guys

799
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:25,760
who are really into it.

800
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,240
It's like, man, I don't know if that's what we were

801
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,680
concerned about so much as the delivery.

802
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:33,720
So much as the like, the naturalism of like,

803
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:36,360
read your script a couple times, man.

804
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:39,440
Yeah, look, Peter Quill had to go into the memory.

805
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,560
He's not like us, us dorks.

806
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,920
He doesn't remember what Splashtacular is.

807
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:47,800
He had to go into his mind and look at a really specific

808
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:52,480
spot five feet away from camera every time that he

809
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:57,040
remembered all of a sudden what the Epcot specific was.

810
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:02,040
And an iPad Pro gaffer taped to a C-stand.

811
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,440
And honestly, like I like, honestly, if I could choose

812
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:07,840
it being like this version or like the nice smooth version,

813
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:08,680
this one's better.

814
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,520
Yeah.

815
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,520
It is more, look, yeah, we love the show

816
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,920
with the strange mythology and the mistakes

817
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:18,720
and a tiny head dinosaur man writhing in a planter.

818
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,360
I think this actually, now that you mentioned it,

819
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:24,000
is keeping Epcot weird and we're not necessarily hating it.

820
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,560
No, no, it's just funny.

821
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,200
It's funny that obviously he doesn't know

822
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,160
what he's talking about.

823
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,000
That's all it is.

824
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,240
And it's, what could be more in theme park,

825
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:35,360
pre-ride video spirit than a mistake that people,

826
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,960
that thousands of people watch every year?

827
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:38,800
Yeah, that's great.

828
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,920
Odd little moments that just, all right,

829
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,320
that's the Bible now.

830
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,640
Yeah, and there was no animatronics,

831
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:47,280
they, some of the art had like animatronics in the queue.

832
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,280
Apparently that's out.

833
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:50,280
There's no animatronic in the queue.

834
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,160
And the blue sky version, I think I was like,

835
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,760
oh yeah, they'll put like the different,

836
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,080
like they could put like old characters in the queue

837
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,800
or they could put all pieces of memorabilia.

838
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,080
No, none of that.

839
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,440
So we're hanging our hat just on

840
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,320
the barely memorized script.

841
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,160
Yeah.

842
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,200
About old Epcot.

843
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:09,160
Oh man, I love riding the space shuttle Earth.

844
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:16,280
Look, Peter Close busy fighting the space monsters, K?

845
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,560
He doesn't know all this shit like you.

846
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,640
He's not real.

847
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,480
Calm down.

848
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,600
Also, why are you doing this?

849
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,240
You don't follow us.

850
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,800
You came here to do this.

851
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,760
Just quote tweeting or just searching for you.

852
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,320
I'm sorry, I felt the same.

853
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:31,360
Yeah, just like searching tweets to like,

854
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:34,680
today I'm gonna defend that take.

855
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:38,320
That's what I like, like to a person,

856
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:41,400
the people who decided to not be happy

857
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:44,400
that I made a joke about Ricky Gervais

858
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:48,160
and his wonderfully progressive views on the trans community

859
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,880
that like all of a sudden I have like,

860
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,680
because every time I clicked on, what's this guy?

861
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,520
What?

862
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,360
Like none of them follow me.

863
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,760
None of them follow anyone.

864
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:57,040
So their purpose today was like,

865
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,200
I'm gonna get in there.

866
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:02,120
I'm gonna be in the army of my hero,

867
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:05,000
British billionaire Ricky Gervais.

868
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,320
I'm gonna be a proud American

869
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:10,720
and defend a guy who hasn't done anything funny since 2008.

870
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,600
That's my patriotic duty today.

871
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:15,360
Recent events have shown that you need to do the math

872
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:18,720
of like, is this a human or is this a wing

873
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:22,520
of the daily water astroturfing organization?

874
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,560
Yeah, that's true.

875
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,120
There are humans doing it.

876
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:29,360
And I think it's a branch of a thing

877
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:32,480
that I have been concerned about lately where like,

878
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,800
I think it probably started with that,

879
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,880
let people enjoy things.

880
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:38,160
Comic strip got very out of hand.

881
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,840
And now if you make a joke about any big budget movie,

882
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:43,160
someone's like, come on, let people enjoy it.

883
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,880
It's like, what is a joke?

884
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:48,520
Hey man, you don't need to defend Morbius.

885
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,760
What are you talking about?

886
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:50,680
What's going on?

887
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:53,840
This isn't violence, not necessarily violence

888
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:56,120
to tease Jurassic world dominion,

889
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:59,680
but I think it may have started with comedians

890
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,800
or the heroes or truth tellers.

891
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,960
It just might be the logical conclusion of like,

892
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,800
well, no teasing stranger things.

893
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,320
You're hurting people's feelings.

894
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,280
It's like, what?

895
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,080
Let them enjoy it.

896
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,120
Am I not?

897
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,520
Do what thou will, cause no harm.

898
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,960
I'm like, yeah, I don't.

899
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:22,040
I'm letting everyone do whatever they want.

900
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:25,640
I'm not some evil space sorcerer.

901
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:28,160
This is the problem, is this person.

902
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,360
Now, why haven't we named this character?

903
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:35,160
Well, because the dialogue that occurs is Mickey,

904
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,560
who are you?

905
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,560
None of your business.

906
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:42,360
Oh, great trick.

907
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,200
Very funny.

908
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,040
Not even a name.

909
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,200
Character unnamed.

910
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,120
Not even a name.

911
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:51,320
No, we owe it to, they gotta start rehearsing it tomorrow.

912
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:54,080
Curry, get it on the printer.

913
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:56,600
So, don't know who it is.

914
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,400
She quickly explained some backstory,

915
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,920
some of what was alluded to in that commercial that I played.

916
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:03,640
Intergalactic Wars have robbed my planet

917
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,240
of all color and life.

918
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:08,400
So we are here to take yours.

919
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,040
I don't know that I would come to a fountain show to take color.

920
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:15,640
I might go to like a paint factory or a museum.

921
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:16,440
Sure.

922
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:16,960
Yeah.

923
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:17,920
That's where you would, yeah.

924
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,440
Or, yeah, rainbow.

925
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,880
The painted desert.

926
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,400
That's good, yeah.

927
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,720
Again, I hate to keep going back to this well.

928
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:26,360
Skittles factory.

929
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:30,080
When it's, that's great.

930
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:33,640
In It's Magical, the Tokyo Disney show, Maleficent shows up

931
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:36,120
and just pretty much goes like, I'll take your color,

932
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,120
or like, I'll show you color.

933
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,440
And, you know, it's Maleficent.

934
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,400
You know, it's just evil.

935
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,680
It's just a shitty thing.

936
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:45,160
Like, the space witch with wars on cosmic planets.

937
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:48,240
It's like, I think you've written yourself into a corner.

938
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

939
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:49,680
Yeah.

940
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:50,880
Though, I mean, quickly.

941
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:55,960
But even that, that's a key couple seconds to explain all that.

942
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,040
And then also the fountain.

943
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,480
We don't know why she wants the fountain.

944
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,680
That's just like extra.

945
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:02,480
And I might as well throw that in the cart too.

946
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,320
Yeah.

947
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:06,520
And that one really, Minnie is so hurt by this.

948
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:07,520
No.

949
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,160
No.

950
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:09,960
Very fraught.

951
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:10,680
Yeah, she's very.

952
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:13,640
I mean, the craziest line comes in a little while.

953
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:16,560
There's probably the, maybe one of the craziest things Mickey

954
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,040
has ever said, but.

955
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,280
Is it about magic?

956
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,680
Well, no, it's, we'll get to it.

957
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:22,200
Yeah.

958
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,000
Because there's a fight.

959
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:23,880
There's some fighting.

960
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:26,480
Earlier in the show, he goes, Minnie, you look great.

961
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,160
This is nice.

962
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,600
They're complementing each other.

963
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,320
There's a little something on it, though,

964
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:37,040
that I felt like was too, too bawdy.

965
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,120
Come on.

966
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:41,520
Can't say what you look nice.

967
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:45,120
Well, at the end of the show, she says, what a mouse.

968
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:48,520
But like the recording of the line

969
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:52,040
makes it sounds like she said, what a mouth.

970
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,760
And I was like, what the fuck?

971
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,040
Mickey Mouse.

972
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:59,400
Oh, I've been meaning to say that here's a little drop this

973
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:02,240
that Rucy Taylor, I believe, passed away.

974
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,200
The one time voice of me.

975
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:08,920
I was talking to my friend's dad,

976
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:13,520
who did a lot of animation work in the late 70s, early 80s,

977
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,640
who not for Disney, but other things,

978
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:17,160
Rucy Taylor was around a lot.

979
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,760
He was very fond of her.

980
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,600
Like, oh, she's the coolest ever to work with.

981
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,840
But apparently, extremely profane.

982
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:23,360
Wow.

983
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,920
Just constantly just like, and I

984
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,800
would have to apologize in front of my friend who

985
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,760
was a child at the time.

986
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,440
Just like, oh, god damn, motherfucker.

987
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,200
OK, shit.

988
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,680
Oh, sorry to do that in front of you.

989
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:33,920
OK, try that again.

990
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:37,760
So the voice of Minnie would drop a lot of bombs.

991
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,400
That's great.

992
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,120
That's a great piece of insider info.

993
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:45,160
Yeah, Walt, again, Walt's spinning in the grave

994
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,000
when you tell that.

995
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,560
But he should have, while he wasn't around,

996
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,000
if somebody had vetted her.

997
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:50,520
Right.

998
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:55,960
We've hired a profanator to voice our beloved mouse.

999
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,440
That's right.

1000
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,960
So anyways, well, what I was going to say,

1001
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:05,440
all right, so the scary sorceress is struck.

1002
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:10,480
And then Mickey says, I've got a little magic of my own.

1003
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,560
Guards!

1004
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:17,960
And then so by magic, he means private security.

1005
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:18,960
Hired guns.

1006
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,720
Hired guns with spears.

1007
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,160
Hells angels?

1008
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:26,000
Like giant stamps.

1009
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,440
Giant stamps with silver Mickey heads on the top.

1010
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:34,080
And a massive change from the original Tokyo production.

1011
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:37,720
They are coordinated stilt walkers.

1012
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:38,320
Oh, you're right.

1013
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,880
The stilts were not in the, yeah.

1014
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,080
The stilts were not in.

1015
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,440
And yeah.

1016
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,200
Make your weapons in my image.

1017
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:51,360
I want people to get stabbed with my face.

1018
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,400
This is my rifle.

1019
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,360
This is my gun.

1020
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,440
This is for fighting.

1021
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,480
This is for fun.

1022
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:59,120
Yeah, but Mickey, wouldn't it be more if you literally have,

1023
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:03,720
you have a blunt shape of a head, but wouldn't you rather have points

1024
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:07,640
than your, because a point could impale somebody that's better than,

1025
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:11,840
I mean, I'm just asking, do you want us to make it a spear more

1026
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,440
so than your round head?

1027
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:17,720
I want them bludgeoned, not impaled.

1028
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:19,120
Listen to me.

1029
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:21,880
It's like a hammer, not a knife.

1030
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,520
OK, just don't bludgeon me.

1031
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:26,600
OK, I'll get right on it.

1032
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:29,080
Yeah, weapons made in his image.

1033
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:29,960
They stomp out.

1034
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:36,280
But then the unnamed sorceress has the ultimate ace up her sleeve

1035
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:41,840
and up through the opposing planter behind plants.

1036
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,320
The planter.

1037
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,440
And it doesn't look imagineered or anything like, oh,

1038
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,320
something's coming out of that.

1039
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,320
It is just some bushes.

1040
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:51,200
Like it would be in an office park.

1041
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,280
Warner Center in Woodland Hills is what it looks like.

1042
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:57,760
What were the kids who like this was their thing?

1043
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:02,840
This was a thing they had to do or they had a VHS tape of I think I saw someone

1044
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:06,600
say this was broadcast on Disney Channel at some point.

1045
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,000
What was this like?

1046
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,440
Were they scarred by like, I can't go by that planter,

1047
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:14,400
like just in their neighborhood, like I can't go by his plans.

1048
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,480
There might be a thing.

1049
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:22,800
So up rises from the planter a giant robotic dinosaur.

1050
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:26,920
It's so crazy.

1051
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:29,320
There's a lot of details to talk about here.

1052
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:34,160
One, the so it is robotic, but a lot of the head is flesh.

1053
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:38,920
Right. But the lower the bottom jaw is metallic.

1054
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:43,600
So he's kind of it's sort of a bionic dinosaur.

1055
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:46,680
There is an angle that the very, very Merry Christmas Parade has

1056
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:48,520
that is up behind his head.

1057
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:54,120
And that gives you an especially good look that he has an exposed brain.

1058
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:57,840
There is just pure open brain.

1059
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:03,440
And from that angle, you can also see that it's kind of this plugs kind of shoved in there.

1060
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,960
So this dinosaur is jacked in like the matrix.

1061
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:09,520
Right. This is a it's a very disturbing.

1062
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,840
Do we think that they've grown the brain?

1063
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:15,000
Because I think dinosaur and this could be wrong, but isn't dinosaurs like would have

1064
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,160
like a T-Rex would have a smaller, smallish brain for its skull.

1065
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,360
That could actually be wrong.

1066
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:22,320
But I've heard it somewhere when I was probably a kid.

1067
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:26,160
Do we think this is the T-Rex's brain that has grown or the implanted?

1068
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:30,480
I think they've implanted like a big brain into it.

1069
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,440
I could be wrong.

1070
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,960
Hmm. But I don't know.

1071
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,120
And I don't think the narrative explains.

1072
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:37,680
So I see. I see. Because dinosaurs are small.

1073
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:42,800
Yeah. So they grew an extra big brain or some sort of a giant alien.

1074
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,240
Yeah. And they've implanted.

1075
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:50,040
They might give him greater powers, although because he moves really slow and does not speak.

1076
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:55,880
So he's smarter from the design flaws with whatever this experiment, which is what it is.

1077
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:56,840
Yeah. Yeah.

1078
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,600
I he looks awesome.

1079
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,840
Yeah. Let's be clear.

1080
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:02,120
His head looks awesome.

1081
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:04,600
Yeah. The body, they kind of give up a little bit.

1082
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:11,160
They give it up. So it looks like a head, a spine, a rib cage that it's opened out and nothing else.

1083
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:12,920
Yeah. Is that your theme?

1084
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:18,280
Because I was at that question is the metal on his body, is it a bunch of little arms

1085
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:21,400
with no hands or is that a flailed out rib cage?

1086
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:28,680
I think it's that. My question was, is this the design on paper or did they start building it?

1087
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:31,880
Go, you know what? Looks good enough.

1088
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:34,520
Yeah. Let's scrap it. Let's leave it there and let's just leave it as is.

1089
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:38,280
Yeah. Yeah. Maybe there were more parts, but they were a little bit again, clock sticking.

1090
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:38,920
We got to get this thing.

1091
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:43,720
Now storyline rise. The rest of them could have just been blown off in the many wars,

1092
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:45,560
cosmic wars that have been going on.

1093
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:50,520
Yes. Clearly battle damaged. Did we say the name of this dinosaur officially?

1094
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:53,000
Well, I know what it is. I don't know how to say it.

1095
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,400
Yes. This is an impossible mystery.

1096
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:57,640
Well, yeah, I have it written down.

1097
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:58,680
Let's all just try.

1098
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:00,200
Okay. Hold on.

1099
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:03,000
You got it? Yeah. Tell me when.

1100
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:05,640
One, two, three.

1101
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:10,040
Terra Sox. Terra Sox.

1102
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:10,840
Terra So.

1103
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:13,720
We landed around the same thing. Terra So.

1104
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:15,320
Yeah. Terra So.

1105
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:17,720
It's probably not so because the X is uppercased.

1106
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:20,680
I think it's an X in the place of Russ.

1107
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:23,800
Yes. The X is uppercase. I think they want you to say X.

1108
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:24,280
There's no R.

1109
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:24,760
Okay.

1110
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:29,080
But if it was a lowercase X, it would be like Terra So.

1111
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:30,040
Terra So.

1112
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:31,480
But that's not what it is. I think it's like Terra So.

1113
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:34,040
Terra Soar, but with an X at the end is what we're.

1114
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:34,920
Terra So.

1115
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:36,840
There should be an R in there. That's the problem.

1116
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:37,080
Yeah.

1117
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:39,560
It would be easy. There should be an R and then a dash.

1118
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:41,320
Terra Soar X.

1119
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:42,680
That's better.

1120
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:43,480
That would be better. Yeah.

1121
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:45,160
Terra So X.

1122
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:45,960
Terra So X.

1123
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:46,840
Terra So X.

1124
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:48,920
I got used to it.

1125
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:52,280
Yeah. All right. We got it. We knew we had to muscle through it.

1126
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:52,840
Terra So.

1127
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:56,360
We're all dreading this coming in the notes. Terra So X.

1128
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:05,640
Yeah. So terrifying in his appearance and spelling. Terra So X shows up and oh my God.

1129
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:09,080
To be, I mean, I think a kid would have been very scared of this.

1130
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:09,880
It's big. Yeah.

1131
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:11,880
And it's three stories tall.

1132
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:13,720
I think it looks like that.

1133
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:17,720
Well, it means business and it looks good when they film it

1134
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:20,520
cinematically in that commercial that I played earlier.

1135
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:23,160
I mean, you think this is going to be the best show you've ever seen.

1136
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:23,640
Oh, yeah.

1137
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:27,480
You're zooming a camera in and out, but just the way that it is kind of in nature

1138
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:31,640
is sort of it's just distant. It's in a planter.

1139
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:34,200
And that hurts it. These aliens should have found.

1140
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:37,160
I mean, I guess they needed a place to hide, but maybe they should have just

1141
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:40,760
like crashed into the center of the stage. But instead, I don't know.

1142
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:49,640
It is what it is. And Terra So X, you know, Mickey thinks he hasn't handled with the Chrome

1143
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:54,760
Army, but Terra So X shows up. And I think now I bet I know what you're going to say.

1144
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:59,000
Well, the stormtroopers take their staffs and shoot sparks at him.

1145
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,120
That does nothing.

1146
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:06,120
They all they all do. Yeah. Much like our modern police, they all attempt to do section.

1147
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:10,040
No, not sorry. Further than our modern police, they attempt to do something.

1148
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:11,640
Sure. Sure. They actually do something.

1149
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:17,560
One by one, they fail. And then but then Mickey's got to.

1150
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:24,840
Yeah. So Mickey has a solution. He he says, quick, mini, give me the exterminator.

1151
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:32,120
Is that one of the weirdest Mickey lines I've ever given the exterminate? And she hands him like.

1152
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:37,480
You know, like they're doing a gender reveal party and they shoot the like blue

1153
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:43,000
like dust out of like a hand-held like cannon. That's sort of what this is, I feel.

1154
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:50,520
In its magical, he uses a whirligig, uses a pinwheel that shoots sparks. He comes back

1155
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:57,000
later and uses a sword, little cleaner. And this it's an exterminate, which is just a crazy

1156
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:04,920
staff looking thing that also seems to shoot, shoot spark or sparks appear somewhere.

1157
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:11,480
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So Mickey's got the exterminate. This is cannon Mickey has something he knows

1158
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:16,280
about. They've talked about it. Yes. It's like the fantastic four has a thing called the ultimate

1159
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:22,840
nullifier, which is just a little handheld box that supposedly is the only thing that can kill

1160
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:28,920
the mighty Galactus. And it's just a McGuffin. It's like the Maltese Falcon or whatever they're

1161
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:35,880
chasing in North by Northwest. It's just like an all powerful thing, but you never quite see it do

1162
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:42,120
anything, you know? Yeah. Well, not this. You see, you see the Mickey exterminator and what the

1163
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:50,440
exterminator does is like shoot a flare into the pterosoics is just, it's just like shooting him

1164
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:57,160
in the gut. This is, I heard where the exterminator Mickey gifted it to Bob J. Peck and he's got it

1165
00:47:57,160 --> 00:48:04,040
now in the office. So if that executive he just fired tries to get in, do try to come back.

1166
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:07,960
Mickey, give me the exterminator.

1167
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:15,240
Glad somebody finally appreciates the power of this thing. They only let me use it once in Epcot.

1168
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:22,280
Cam the show cause they said it was scary and weird. I don't think so. I used to ask for it.

1169
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:28,920
I took it down to Church Street station, got free drinks all night, baby. It's like a firework show

1170
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:35,400
basically. Yeah, it's deadly, but it also looks cool. It's just to shoot this thing at Chippendale

1171
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:43,080
if they messed up their lines. Shoot at those varmints. You want an exterminator around to shoot

1172
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:48,520
at the varmints. Space varmints. You don't want to ban this. Where is your space varmints then?

1173
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:53,160
In Florida there's snakes that can swim. Do you know how fucked up that is?

1174
00:48:53,720 --> 00:49:00,600
Just thinking about it makes me sick. The exterminator. Really? How did that make it?

1175
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:09,640
Even in that year? Then our all-American hero asks his live-in girlfriend to hand him a big

1176
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:14,440
staff called the exterminator. Hey, Nanny, you look smoking hot today. Give me the exterminator.

1177
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:20,440
Look, the costumes are done. The costumes are done. The Thanksgiving holiday weekend's coming

1178
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:27,720
up. Let's just get the show on. Babe, babe, babe, give me the exterminator. We're in a wrestling

1179
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:33,800
submit in the bushes. I think it's an alien again. No, it could just be, it might just be a mouse.

1180
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:39,080
You're a mouse. You don't want to shoot a mouse. Yeah, I do. That fucking mouse, he's dead to me.

1181
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:45,640
He's exterminated. The show must go on. They skip the addition by subtraction past of the script.

1182
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:51,880
The past where you remove things to enhance the show, not add more things.

1183
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,520
Where's that Mortimer? Where's that Mortimer that's been courting you?

1184
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:03,640
Give me the exterminator. Mickey, no. Mickey, please. Please. He's nice. He's harmless.

1185
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:08,600
You can't fire that thing that close. Think about it. What put it into pterosaurics?

1186
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:13,640
Go make him go soak his head. Pluto, get over there and put this apple on your head.

1187
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:24,920
I'm fine. I really wish to drink. My name's Craneer. Watch. I didn't shoot the dog, okay?

1188
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:30,200
Making you drink from the fountain. Don't be mad. You've been drinking from the fountain again.

1189
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:36,520
You've gone crazy with the fountain water. The colors are perfectly natural. It's

1190
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:41,080
portable. It's portable wire. Mickey is the lizard queen.

1191
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:50,680
This is our Mickey. Drunken 3 a.m. This is a window into the Mickey that we want. That's the Mickey

1192
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:58,440
of Epcot 94. Mickey shoots a space dinosaur in the chest who slowly crumbles back into the planner

1193
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:04,360
he came from. That's insane. I don't remember what becomes of the sorceress, the unnamed sorceress,

1194
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:09,960
after that. Well, doesn't she zap Mickey and he drops in a trap door? Oh yeah, Mickey does disappear.

1195
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:15,800
And that's when she takes the cherry picker. She takes it. I am taking this thing for a ride.

1196
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:23,320
And she is this thing that is much lower tech than what I, a veteran of intergalactic space wars,

1197
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:28,120
want the cherry picker. There's one thing I want more on this earth than colors. I want to see the

1198
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:35,240
tops of the central air conditioning units. I want to see with all the bird splats. I want to

1199
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:41,720
replace a billboard. One ad with another. The only way I can do it is with this cherry picker.

1200
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:47,480
I need to be high. I have plastering work I want to do. She's fun by the way. I really want to say she's got a

1201
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:53,160
lot of energy, really gesturing wildly. She's talking like this and I'm so evil. Very reader

1202
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:59,960
repulsa. Yes. Extremely reader. Not as shrewd. Very reader repulsa. The maleficent, there's like

1203
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:06,760
two maleficents clearly in the It's Magical show. And the one who appears on the balcony twice in

1204
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:12,200
the show, that must have been an easy gig. Because you appear at the beginning, you step backstage,

1205
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:17,000
and then you come out at the end and go like, ah! And that's- Did that do a big break in there?

1206
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:22,120
If somebody were to draw a Nancy cartoon of you watching that, it would be like you're watching it

1207
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:26,360
and you go hmm. And you think about it and like you're now maleficent. Like you walk out,

1208
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:30,360
you walk back, and then you just go and collect your check. You're like, I have a glass of lemonade

1209
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:38,840
backstage. While the other maleficent walks in, sweat on the brow. Ah! I was hoofing at that

1210
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:43,720
whole time. God. I'm calling for fan art in the style of the Nancy comic strip. Why has there

1211
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:49,400
never been Jason in the style of Nancy? Yeah, really. Boy. Jason is sluggo. Often I'm, yeah,

1212
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:54,440
characterized as sluggo. But I'd be happy to be Nancy in this case. Jason fantasizing about

1213
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:58,840
the maleficent job where you just have to sit, stand on a balcony. We make the same money

1214
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:02,920
to the other maleficent. We make the same amount.

1215
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:11,560
The shitty break room with two maleficents. Maybe they switched off each performance.

1216
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:16,200
Oh, my back's a little achy today. Can I do balcony?

1217
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:20,600
Are you okay? I'll wait for you next time. Don't worry about it. Throat's a little scratch. I

1218
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:25,720
don't really want to sing. Can I just do balcony tonight? Would that be a big problem?

1219
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:31,640
So then I truly don't know what happens to the wit. I assume she falls into that trap door.

1220
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:36,760
But quickly, this is all over and it's resolved. And then there's a song. It's like Mickey makes

1221
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:44,840
your dreams come true with the exterminator. Yeah. Well, Mickey comes back out with an unmentioned,

1222
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:53,160
I guess, broad magic wand, shoots sparks at her and that gets her. Okay. Again, pinwheel to sword,

1223
00:53:53,160 --> 00:54:01,400
little cleaner than exterminator to unnamed item. So what happened to this witch was she's fought

1224
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:07,560
in many, many wars. The wars have eroded the color from her planet. And she, there's probably a lot

1225
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:13,560
of like, you have to do something, do something. You who shall not be named. I will. You don't

1226
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:18,200
think I have a plan. I'm going to Orlando. I looked it up on Google maps. There's a bunch of

1227
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:23,800
color in there. I saw the overhead. It's going to work great. What if you encounter a, what if

1228
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:31,160
you encounter a mouse with a, with an extermination wand? Don't, don't shut up in Orlando. Hardly.

1229
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:36,840
I'm more scared if he has a second unnamed one. That's the bigger problem.

1230
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:43,400
He's going to, if the, if this supposed, if this hypothetical mouse has an exterminator,

1231
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:48,920
he's going to blow all the extermination juice on pterosaurics here. That's pretty good. I mean,

1232
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:54,840
a couple of the dancers all come back with brightly colored butterfly wings. I don't know why they

1233
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:59,560
didn't do shit during this big fight scene. They're not war. They're not guards. They're not warriors.

1234
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:04,440
I guess those wings aren't practical, but then at the end, Mickey stands in center stage and there's

1235
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:10,440
a bunch of fog or mist and stuff and he disappears in a puff of smoke. He goes through the trap door,

1236
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:15,160
which looks pretty cool. And it closed. Yeah. What's the implication or the implication there

1237
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:20,280
though? That he's like magic. He's magic. Yeah. He turned into what he was water. He turned into

1238
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:27,960
vapor. I'm vapor now. Yeah. It shows water and color. What do you care? What is business is yours?

1239
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:32,600
You don't have the exterminator. You're not holding the exterminator in this conversation.

1240
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:39,720
Don't make me turn into vapor again. Hey Minnie, you're turning into mist. Let's get

1241
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:50,920
mist. Let's come. Let's merge our mist. Let's do it misty style. What a mouse. What a mouse.

1242
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:58,200
Okay. We have to, we get, well, let's wind this down, but I, did you guys find the other,

1243
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:02,520
the epilogue, if you can imagine that the insanity is not over. I think I know what you're talking

1244
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:06,280
about. I think I banged the epilogue for later. The Tomorrowland show. That's what you're talking

1245
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:10,520
about, right? Yeah. Yeah. But we gotta bring it up. Yeah. We can bring it up, but I was like,

1246
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:16,120
oh, this is 25 minutes. No, it is a full episode. Sadly, it's a full episode. All right. Okay. But

1247
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:21,720
here's what happened. This show closed after seven months. And then what I didn't know is that over

1248
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:27,720
in Tomorrowland, a couple months later, that all the same costumes started appearing in an outdoor

1249
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:34,680
show there in the magic kingdom called galaxy search. This was a star search, but for inter

1250
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:44,360
galactic acts. It is a, it lends itself to lines like ladies and gentlemen, many on the robots.

1251
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:51,480
And then she does, she performs Aritha Franklin's respect with a bunch of robots with weird

1252
00:56:51,560 --> 00:57:00,920
featureless dark heads. And what this builds to is that goofy brings on his singing partner,

1253
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:08,760
which is a big robotic dinosaur, a familiar looking, big robotic dinosaur. But in this case,

1254
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:17,560
it is further modified with Elvis glasses, glasses with Elvis's glasses. Elvis's famous glasses,

1255
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:24,120
triple glasses and an Elvis wig referred to as the king. And they do a duet of,

1256
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:30,120
I just want to be your teddy bear. Oh yeah. I just want to be your teddy bear. Yeah.

1257
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:36,440
Did goofy mostly sing because everybody's scared of the dinosaur, but then goofy mostly sing.

1258
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:43,800
This is so insane now. Goofy mostly sings it, but sometimes the robot, the dinosaur robot Elvis

1259
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:51,800
will just go like, I just want to be your teddy bear. Yeah, that's right. That's what I'm saying.

1260
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:58,840
And that's something that happened at Disneyland or Disney world. I will say this, that feels like

1261
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:05,320
a 90s show to me, not splash tecular. That feels 80s to me. It feels like they have repurposed all

1262
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:12,040
of this stuff for a dumb sounding 90s show, which I do. I did not watch all of it, but I saw the

1263
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:17,400
highlights. But yeah, I didn't know that existed. I had no idea. No idea. Yeah. And we don't like,

1264
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:23,960
so you got sunny eclipse and then a few feet over a big robot dinosaur with an exposed brain is also

1265
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:32,520
Elvis in a, in an intergalactic star search. What a time it is. I think maybe I need to declare with

1266
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:38,440
all this, that Disney world peaked in 94. It never got better. And these shows, people actually sat

1267
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:43,880
and watched sunny eclipse and not just the weirdos among us who remember this is all the

1268
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:49,080
insane stuff ever. This was great. I love it. Yeah. And I'm always happy they do live entertainment.

1269
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:54,600
Again, I don't know if it's the biggest, like we need to get more people here driver, but I think

1270
00:58:54,600 --> 00:59:00,040
people are really happy. Like as the parks reopened, like, Oh, good live entertainment's coming back.

1271
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:04,600
It does add something to the park. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. Did you guys see that then

1272
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:11,400
Terris Sox is just rotting in the botanicals. This is with dramatic lighting, like with like in

1273
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:17,320
the sunset. Oh my God. This was just, I think if you worked at Disney world until like 2006

1274
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:24,200
and you parked in the employee parking, you would pass by this, this non-moving dinosaur robot. And

1275
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:29,240
most people didn't know what it was because nobody remembered splash tackler just sat there rusting

1276
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:35,880
away for a long time. And I get the magic that even when it's gone, even that at one point,

1277
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:41,640
yeah, I work at a place where I parked my car and then there's a rusty dinosaur dying in the Florida

1278
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:47,880
humidity. I did not have any idea about that. Don't ever let your union strike cause Disney's

1279
00:59:47,960 --> 01:00:00,680
negotiator is Tara. So X watch out equity. Watch out AFL CIO teamsters.

1280
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:08,920
I'm going to say this. This is how I feel after at the end of this year. This is my favorite thing.

1281
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:16,600
We've talked about it in months. I love this. I found it funny and I've liked on spooling this.

1282
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:22,520
I don't know how the audience feels. I love the show. You know what I love? The only thing

1283
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:26,600
that I was lacking and I guess we didn't even really talk about it as much as the music isn't

1284
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:32,520
as good as I would want it to be. It's pretty generic. It's pretty generic Disney. If the music

1285
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:38,200
were like a little bit better, I think I would completely agree with you. I only have like 75%

1286
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:45,160
agree with you because yes, aesthetically, yeah. Aesthetically. Yeah. Like if yeah, aesthetically

1287
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:48,200
it's right up my alley. As I said on the power Rangers episode, like

1288
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:54,840
is my favorite genre of any entertainment. So we've got that. We've got very cool looking

1289
01:00:54,840 --> 01:01:00,040
Mickey's guards. It feels like some crazy nonsense. Even like sometimes when you see some,

1290
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:05,000
and I have not really played the kingdom hearts games, but I do like the idea of like the

1291
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:11,320
recontextualization of the Disney characters in this bizarre like other narrative. I like that.

1292
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:17,080
So I like a similar way. We're like Mickey has guards for no reason. Like I like the idea of

1293
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:23,720
this bizarre reality. And yeah, it's all it's it's great. It's great. I love that. There's people

1294
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:28,680
that are like, oh, not really Disney people, but who, when I was 13, I know everything about kingdom

1295
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:33,800
hearts. Yeah, I know people mentioned kingdom hearts and I got close to playing it. It's hard

1296
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:39,400
with video game. I have, I have switched and I have a PS five, but it's like, it takes me a lot

1297
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:44,920
to get really invested. If it's news, big Zelda, I'll do it. If it's a new big Mario, like the main

1298
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:50,200
Mario three D games, I will do all of it. I was never an RPG guy, but like whoever was like,

1299
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:57,080
we should mash up final fantasy with Disney stuff. Like whoever probably deserves a lot of money,

1300
01:01:57,080 --> 01:02:01,800
like just the right time where all that could happen. And there's multiple games. I mean,

1301
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:05,400
there's certainly stuff for us to investigate there because I bet we would find some weirdness

1302
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:10,360
like this. Moments that yeah, yeah. What Mickey does what? Yeah. Well, let us know any alert us

1303
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:15,320
to anything, especially crazy and just play in the marbles, but does it top the exterminator is,

1304
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:20,520
is the exterminator one of the craziest things? It's crazy. Yeah. He's done like right along,

1305
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:27,240
along with yelling, okay, you asked for it. Yeah, we're discovered. We just keep peeling back

1306
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:33,320
layers of men. And I hope that this is our best defense against being accused of being Disney

1307
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:39,400
adults that it's not like, I just love him and I want to hug him and I want him to be at my

1308
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:47,720
foodless, barless wedding. I can't even, if you're, if you're a regular per or like,

1309
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:52,120
like you're a little internet savvy and just like every, you know, you like to read about movies

1310
01:02:52,120 --> 01:02:55,560
and TV and stuff. And then every now and then you just come across something like I spent all my

1311
01:02:55,560 --> 01:03:00,360
money on Mickey and Minnie for my wedding. There's no food. Like, yeah, you're going to be a little

1312
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:06,440
weirded out. That's kind of weird. And religious studies professor who's like, let's not pathologize

1313
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:12,280
this. I was like, you are being very weird professor. Like you are weird. Strangest defense.

1314
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:19,320
Now hang on. Let me defend the people who didn't get food at a wedding or a bar at a wedding,

1315
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:26,680
but instead get, got Mickey and Minnie to take pictures with them for half an hour. And then

1316
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:33,000
when pressed on this, their defense was wait, there were vending machines. Oh man. I missed

1317
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:38,760
that was in their posts. They're like the grounds of the hotel had plenty of vending machines.

1318
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:45,000
The guests could have helped themselves to three months old son chips, which is, should be anyone's

1319
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:53,240
expectation at a wedding. Is that bait? It was that, it was that fake. I, you know, maybe the

1320
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:57,880
religious professor who's like, I have studied this and it's sort of like a religion. I'm like,

1321
01:03:57,880 --> 01:04:03,240
no, no. I like tapped out of the thread, like three tweets in. I was like, professor, no,

1322
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:08,920
what are you doing? I realized this might not be the best argument that I'm making, but I just don't

1323
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:14,440
cause I don't like being tossed into that Disney adult box. And I hope that it helps that my Mickey

1324
01:04:14,440 --> 01:04:21,240
is murderous and holds an extermination rod. I think that, look, I, I, I hear what you're saying

1325
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:25,800
and I agree with what you're saying, but when you come before the judge and the judge looks at the

1326
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:32,680
number of episodes you've done on Disney related content, I think, unfortunately, allow me to make

1327
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:37,880
this argument. There are so many episodes that have nothing to do with theme parks. I'm aware

1328
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:42,600
that we get away from the stated topic for hours at a time. The judge is going to have to be a

1329
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:49,080
listener in order for him to understand the nuances of this or he or her, they, if we are judged in

1330
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:54,360
the kingdom of heaven, yeah, I thought you were talking about St. Peter. St. Peter is going to

1331
01:04:54,360 --> 01:05:00,520
listen to every episode of podcast, the ride and from that determine. Yeah. Yeah. So anything's

1332
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:06,440
possible. And then he's, then he speed listens. Hmm. I see. And then speaks. Okay. You ask for it

1333
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:14,120
and cast us to hell. Well, you survived podcast, the ride. Thanks for subscribing to the second
