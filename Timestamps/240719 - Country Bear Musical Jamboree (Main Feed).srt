about little outfits

00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Crystal palaces

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and realistic moose eyes

00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000

Podcast The Podcast Ride

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm swinging Scotty Gardner

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
joined by Big Car Alson

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Yeehaw, hello

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm doing that because I have a canker sore today

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
and it's hard to close my mouth

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
So if I'm trying like this today it's cause I have a bad canker sore

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Yeehaw is just a good sound to make

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
to try to like swish your mouth around

28
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
and like that's just what came out

29
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
when you naturally lapped your tongue

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
That's right, yeehaw

31
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I see, well I'm glad it happened in such a folksy way

32
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Hey, and sit over there

33
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
there's an old familiar face, it's Jughead

34
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Jason Bonnet Sheridan

35
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Hi

36
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Hi, yeah, I have a slightly less impactful

37
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
canker sore, so

38
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Two of the hosts

39
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Two of the hosts today have canker sores

40
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
What about it?

41
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The gradual march of this show

42
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
into medical ailment complaints

43
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
continues

44
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I often have one, it's just that today

45
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
it's so impactful and it hurts

46
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
and it's right on the top

47
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It's right on your instrument

48
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It's like if you went to a country music show

49
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
and there was a canker sore

50
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
on the fiddle

51
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Yeah, I know, my mouth fiddle is

52
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
injured today

53
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
This is impacting our odds of pulling off a jamboree

54
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Bear with me today

55
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Bear with, oh I like that

56
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
That's great

57
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I dusted off those names

58
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I went and looked up what our names were

59
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
in Country Bear Jamboree Week

60
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
and if we pulled off what we vaguely talked about

61
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
then you have heard

62
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
the Country Bear Jamboree Week

63
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
theme music

64
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
and general overlay

65
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
from I think towards the end of 2022

66
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
and as well as

67
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
the art, courtesy of

68
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Tony Grasso, one of the great pieces of art

69
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
of us we've been lucky enough to receive

70
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
because we're

71
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
kind of nodding back

72
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
we're back to Country Bear Jamboree

73
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
as we celebrate the new show

74
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
at Disney World

75
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
the Country Bear Musical Jamboree

76
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Yes, we're here

77
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
So why not dust off the old

78
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
let's refurbish

79
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
and gold plate our old

80
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
materials, treating this

81
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
now refurbished attraction

82
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
That's one of my, that's maybe my favorite

83
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
of the alternate themes

84
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I went back and re-listened

85
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I hadn't heard it in a while, it's very good

86
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Well that requires some musical dexterity

87
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
on your part, unless that was all plugins

88
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Well

89
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
there's one thing I was playing on the keyboard

90
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
that's like a fiddle or something

91
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
or I forget what it was, a banjo or something

92
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
but I was playing it, but then you can go back

93
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
and you can fix it too with MIDI

94
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I see

95
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
No, there's like guitar and stuff, it's not like it's all robot

96
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
or anything

97
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
But, unlike the show

98
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
This is more robotic than

99
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Played live, no no, great job

100
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I did like that a lot, I refreshed my memory

101
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
and I think maybe

102
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
just right before we dive into

103
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Country Bear Musical Jamboree

104
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
going back

105
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
to this old

106
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
theme and overlay just made me think

107
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
are there

108
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
this is a sound off in the comments

109
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
kind of situation, are there

110
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
series that we've done before

111
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
that you want to return in some form

112
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
are there

113
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
attractions that you think merit

114
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
a little event beyond

115
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
just doing one big long

116
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
episode about it, because I remember

117
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
being very happy with

118
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Jamboree Week

119
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
that's something I'd be curious about

120
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
you know, mini

121
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
events, which we're always on the lookout for

122
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
and events involving

123
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
mini as well, certainly

124
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
front of the line for those

125
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
and I even

126
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
because I had a thought way back when

127
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
and I wasn't sure about the title

128
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
but I'm going to pitch it now

129
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
to you guys, let's just workshop

130
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
it here now, because this seems like

131
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
it could work as like a little more meat on the bone

132
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
kind of little event

133
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
and that is this, Enchanted

134
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Tiki Wiki

135
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
could be

136
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
yeah, could be, yeah, yeah

137
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
sure, sure

138
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I'm trying to agree

139
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I'm trying to agree with you

140
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
and as soon as I

141
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
it was like half way through, I was like

142
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
it's going to sound shitty

143
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
it's going to sound critical

144
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
it's not bad, it's okay

145
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
we'll think it over

146
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
off mic

147
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I think it was Cankersaur's effect

148
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I think the Cankersaur's somehow puffed

149
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
and created an attitude

150
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
people grumpy, they make me grumpy, I was just cursing

151
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
through the house this morning like

152
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
shucks

153
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
screw my seat

154
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I did not yell screw my seat

155
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
this morning, I swear

156
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
but I was thinking it

157
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
your daughter just walking around copying screw my seat

158
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
no

159
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
her first words

160
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
oh no, it's not even normal

161
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
profanity shit

162
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I'd rather she just say fuck

163
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I think she said oh shit yesterday

164
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
when she dropped something and she goes, oh shit

165
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I go, did she just say oh shit

166
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
it wasn't directly after I said it or anything

167
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I was just wondering if she heard me drop something

168
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
once and exclaim

169
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I've had some lord's name

170
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
in vain make its way

171
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
in there, which is a difficult

172
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
situation, I'm just like don't do it when I'm

173
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
not around with my

174
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
pretty religious parents

175
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
and family

176
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I try to curtail that one

177
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
anyway

178
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
so this

179
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
this show, Country Bear

180
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
musical jamboree

181
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
the somewhat

182
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
confusingly titled

183
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
or actually lack of confusingly

184
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
just a weird title

185
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I can't hide from that

186
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I think the title is weird

187
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
it is weird

188
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I did look up the dictionary definition

189
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
of jamboree and it seems to be

190
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
a raucous large gathering

191
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
it doesn't have to be musical

192
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
it doesn't have to be music

193
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
but I thought it did

194
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I was like I always assumed jamboree

195
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
probably because I learned it

196
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
from a young age

197
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
from the Country Bear jamboree

198
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
oh if this is your association then you assume

199
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
a jamboree is a big hootin hollerin

200
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
musical celebration

201
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
this was a conversation that we had

202
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
the other night pre-episode

203
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
and we were talking about the feeling that the title

204
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
is redundant

205
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
and that putting musical

206
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
this must have been what was in your head Jason

207
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
isn't it redundant to put musical

208
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
or jamboree

209
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
and I guess now we've determined music

210
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
doesn't have to be part of a jamboree

211
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
though you'd have to think it would help

212
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
any jamboree is going to be better with music

213
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I agree completely

214
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I kind of agreed with you

215
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
when you first said it

216
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
and then I thought

217
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
there might be several generations

218
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
deep that have never encountered

219
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
the word jamboree

220
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
this might be kind of a

221
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
as with you Jason

222
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
if the word jamboree

223
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
was not in this attraction

224
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
would we be using jamboree

225
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
yeah

226
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
when have you encountered, when do you see jamboree

227
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
out in the world

228
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
the one time I encountered it was in the Boy Scouts

229
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
and it was like a big meet up

230
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
of different troops

231
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
yes that's a big one, Boy Scout jamboree

232
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
which is also why there's a jamboree

233
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
road in Newport Beach

234
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
because it's where the biggest jamboree

235
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
occur really

236
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
yes yeah apparently

237
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
but if you're not around there

238
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
if you're not passing by jamboree road all the time

239
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
then why is it in your head

240
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
there was a Naughty by Nature song called jamboree

241
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
but that was like 25 years ago

242
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I don't think there's been a pop jamboree

243
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
since

244
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
there should be

245
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
it's a fun word

246
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I really like the word

247
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
the victory is that the word is still in the title of this new show

248
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
that is true yeah

249
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
well that's going to be a common theme today

250
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
there's victories here

251
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I think there's a lot of victories here

252
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
that's the theme today

253
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
but even that implies

254
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
that we are kind of like

255
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
looking for bright sides

256
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
or at least on the lookout for

257
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
dark sides

258
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
which has kind of been the hesitation

259
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
since this show was announced

260
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
there's a double edged sword here

261
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
the country bears are returning

262
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
they aren't getting kicked out

263
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
that's the main thing

264
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
they aren't getting fluttered

265
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
they aren't getting thrown to the trash heap

266
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
or getting changed into different

267
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I don't know presidents or something

268
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
like they're not being changed to other robots

269
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
they're not being put in Tiana

270
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
and reskinned or something

271
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
they're there, they're still there

272
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
yeah

273
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
as much as I feel like there are some presidents

274
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
who could just be

275
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
like these bodies could work

276
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
some of them

277
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
some of these 1800's guys

278
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
or if certain presidents

279
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
return and the policy is

280
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
that we need a second one

281
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
instead of just bringing the old one

282
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
back up to the front

283
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
but that's not the

284
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
there aren't two Grover Clevelands

285
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
again another one who probably could be

286
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
a country bear body could work

287
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
but for now

288
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
they all get to be themselves

289
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
so the existence of this thing

290
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I think is great

291
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I think that they even

292
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
have to do kind of a

293
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
what would you call this

294
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
a C ticket D ticket type

295
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
refresher

296
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
that's not

297
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
going to be a headline

298
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
grabber

299
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
it's not something that like

300
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
moves the needle in a massive

301
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
way for non theme park fans

302
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
right?

303
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
but it's like a nice thing

304
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
it's the sort of thing we want them to do

305
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
all the time, plus ups and

306
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
downs

307
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
so it's cool that they did this

308
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
it's kind of like the tree house out here

309
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
which they did half for practical

310
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
reasons they moved the entrance of the tree house

311
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
over in adventure land

312
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
they moved it back so people could walk

313
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
but while it was happening

314
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
unfortunately I hate to say

315
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Tony Baxter's street cloggers

316
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I mean

317
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Astro Orbit is still there but we got rid of the rocks

318
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
he loves to clog the streets

319
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
it's all interesting

320
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I like when Tarzan's tree house

321
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
opened it was this odd little outpost

322
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
that gives you extra

323
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
an extra walk to do

324
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
it was interesting but it just

325
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
sort of becomes impractical after a while

326
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
but they took that opportunity to

327
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
now re-theme that tree house

328
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
it's a nice little walk, they added like animatronics

329
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
we should do a little episode on it

330
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
eventually

331
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
but that's the thing where you're like

332
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
they could have just ripped this out, there's no reason they couldn't

333
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
have just taken this out, there's no reason

334
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
they had to put money into it but yes

335
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
it's a de-ticket little walk through

336
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
it's a little refreshed

337
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
these little historical society

338
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
type

339
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
that you want

340
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
the little museum that shows you what life was like

341
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
a hundred years ago in the town

342
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
you want them to have the money

343
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
to put new wigs on the mannequins

344
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
who

345
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
show you how old

346
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
phones used to

347
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
operate

348
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
and by old stoves

349
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
we want these things to work

350
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
we want those little museums to have the hundred

351
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
dollars they need to replenish the

352
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
wigs that spiders have

353
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
laid eggs in

354
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I'm picturing a very specific type of museum here

355
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
so the Disney version

356
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
of that

357
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
that's not like

358
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
building an entire new

359
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
big trackless ride vehicle

360
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
which we also want them to do

361
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
do everything

362
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
but yes, there's generally

363
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
a push and pull, there's a trade off

364
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
there's a reason stuff happens

365
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
too, so it's like

366
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I understand that from

367
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
a practical way

368
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I understand that there's a trade off

369
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
you put money in here

370
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
you scratch our back, we scratch yours

371
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
a little bit, that's what's happening between

372
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Imagineering and the executive side

373
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
the bear area

374
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
make it so people can walk

375
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
in Adventureland and Disneyland

376
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
and we'll give you a little money to like

377
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
make a little narrative about

378
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
a family that's not the Swiss Family

379
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Robinson, but they're inspired by them

380
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
that's what it is?

381
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
kind of

382
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
it's not them, but it says it's inspired by them

383
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I'm not sure

384
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
so modern though?

385
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
or in the same era as

386
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
the Swiss Family?

387
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
it's kind of splitting the difference

388
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I walked through it twice and now I can't remember

389
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I think it's modern?

390
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
family that read the books

391
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
or saw the movie

392
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I believe so

393
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
that's baffling

394
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
are you not baffled if you're there?

395
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
if you're there you're just charmed

396
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
if you're there you'll read the thing and you go huh

397
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
and then you walk up and you go oh that's where

398
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
sister looks at the sky in her little

399
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
like astronomy

400
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
machine or whatever

401
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
this could be called a telescope, but I called it an astronomy machine

402
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
you got there in your own way

403
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I respect that

404
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
they're lucky with that one

405
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I think

406
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I think everybody would like the tree house

407
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
to be there in general

408
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
but I don't think a lot of people are like

409
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
you took out the Swiss Family?

410
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
who?

411
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Robinson presumably?

412
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
do you think there were people

413
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
going like you took out Tarzan?

414
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
yeah I don't think so either

415
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I don't think there's a lot

416
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I think you had to be

417
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
if you were like

418
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
12 to 15

419
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
when Tarzan came out

420
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
and you like the

421
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
early CGI they used

422
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
to make him skate down the vines

423
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
and I do

424
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
that was one we didn't see

425
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
in theaters

426
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
but I remember renting it

427
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I remember all the Phil Collins songs

428
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I was like I like this

429
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
it's just not

430
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
were you upset when they removed him

431
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
from the tree house?

432
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
doesn't seem like you were

433
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
fine with it

434
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I don't think anybody

435
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I think they're very lucky they're dealing with

436
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
two properties that nobody could be too mad

437
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
about

438
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
here it's a little more delicate

439
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I feel like

440
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
there was another type of

441
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Disney company

442
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
we've been pretty Disney critical

443
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
recently, but it feels like there was an even

444
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
colder version

445
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
that might have ripped this out

446
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I'm picturing like late 90s early 2000s

447
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
in the era where it left

448
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
in Anaheim

449
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I feel like there's another version

450
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
of the company where it is just like we're going to move more

451
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
we're going to make better numbers

452
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
if this is something else

453
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
and I think it just

454
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
wrote it maybe they just didn't have the money

455
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
to rip it out in the colder time

456
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
and in that time

457
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
that's like one more generation

458
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
that has grown up with this thing

459
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
theme park nerdom is a little bit

460
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
more common and accepted

461
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
and I think people

462
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
they had enough here like we liked in general

463
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
the show we liked the characters

464
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
and there was enough that they had to kind of like pay

465
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
homage to and be respectful

466
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
of to where like this

467
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I think this could have been so much grosser

468
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
imagine if like

469
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
back when they owned American Idol

470
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
or whatever I mean they own American Idol now

471
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
but you know like what if they hadn't

472
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
thought of the American Idol experience

473
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
in studios

474
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
and this became well we need a music show

475
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
let's have robots of Sanjaya

476
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
or whatever

477
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
let's make Henry a little more Simon Cowell

478
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
let's make him a little meaner

479
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
well yeah it's like

480
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
or they keep the characters but they put

481
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
bear judges in the front

482
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
and somebody and it's like

483
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I like I wasn't feeling a dog

484
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
and then it's a literal dog

485
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I feel like

486
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
it's like luck that that didn't happen

487
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I feel like I've read

488
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
something like that before

489
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
that they wanted to do something like that even though

490
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
like it just feels right is what I'm saying

491
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
that they would have done that in a certain era

492
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
you're describing sort of like an under new management

493
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
tiki room situation

494
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
where like depending on

495
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
what the era was which I don't know if it's

496
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
what year does that come out

497
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
that's early 2000s

498
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
that's sort of what I'm picturing

499
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I think we're really lucky they didn't touch country fairs

500
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
where they would have done something like that

501
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
where the taste was bad

502
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
as much as current Disney is

503
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
very bland then Disney

504
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
was more likely to be shitty

505
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
yeah and like even like the

506
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
the Ellen energy overlay

507
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
we were like ah this feels

508
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
like there's such a specific

509
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
90s feeling to some of like the humor of

510
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
that and then it goes into

511
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
like the year like the superstar limo

512
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
era of comedy

513
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
the Stitches great escape chili dog burps

514
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I think that's the era

515
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I think the fairs are really lucky

516
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
they skated out of the 2000s

517
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
this is too

518
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
my memory

519
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
is not like

520
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
cause I Disney

521
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
is getting like

522
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
weirder or shittier

523
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
in like not great ways

524
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
and I'm like entering

525
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
high school and going through puberty

526
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
so I'm like

527
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
it's less at the forefront of my mind

528
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
yeah no the regrettable time

529
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
we all had where we thought about Disney

530
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
a little less thank god it's rectified

531
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
now that we are adults

532
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
some of whom with children

533
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
but I did think about the parks a good amount

534
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
and I think that's a thing that

535
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
comes up like one of the criticisms

536
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
of this is like oh I'm a little

537
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
bummed cause when we were talking

538
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
about it the other night I'm like oh

539
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
they're taking away

540
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
the country bears making like kind

541
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
of dated references

542
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
kind of dated comedy

543
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
and they're taking out these weird

544
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
old country songs

545
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
they're like sanding off the weirdness

546
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
yeah right right yeah

547
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
well this is the debate I'm

548
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
sort of curious to have and as we dig in

549
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
and kind of focus on

550
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
what did we lose here

551
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
did we lose things that make it

552
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
what it is or were there things

553
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
that just had to go and that is

554
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
the only way that this could have

555
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
gone we should say we did not go

556
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
in case it wasn't clear oh yeah

557
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
this is a Zapruder film

558
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
we're watching videos

559
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
since it's a we made the call

560
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
that since it's not like you physically have to

561
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
experience it it would have been nice to be there

562
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
cause I think the speakers are upgraded and whatever

563
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
but you can kind of tell

564
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
the show without being there

565
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
so just to be clear I think you're

566
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
right that the big I definitely

567
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
realized that the big thing that we're

568
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
that we're missing and

569
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
that we should mention and properly honor

570
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
them for is the refurbishment

571
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
of the theater I think it's new seats

572
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
it's new carpet it sounds great

573
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
apparently the

574
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
that it was sort of muffled before

575
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
was largely because

576
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
the speakers were behind

577
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
a very thick old 70s

578
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
curtain and they like

579
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
lifted everything and rearranged

580
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
everything so that I think

581
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
there are still so just the way

582
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
you know Disney doesn't want visible

583
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
speakers really in a show like this you

584
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
still got to hide them but just they were able

585
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
to like pick a new curtain

586
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
figure it out to where like some

587
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
of them are like some of them are way up

588
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
here and then the ones that still have to go through a curtain

589
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
it's just a better situation

590
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
more sound is making it through

591
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I got some of this information

592
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I don't know if you guys watched any of this basically

593
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
like this so this show as we

594
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
as you're hearing this the show

595
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
is open to the public two days

596
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
ago I think

597
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
but they did a preview for

598
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
D23 members

599
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
and there are videos

600
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
of this and I thank all

601
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
of the people who took the videos and posted them

602
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
and made this episode possible without

603
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
going there being in D23

604
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
but as part of that

605
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
there was a little Q&A

606
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
before the show began

607
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
and I'm glad I watched this because

608
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
it kind of gave me a bigger appreciation

609
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
for what they did

610
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
and then also there's like backstory of the

611
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
show that I didn't know in general

612
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
that was covered here and just

613
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
general oddities and then stuff

614
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
like that for sure that like okay here's how

615
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
they redid the

616
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
and that there's gold

617
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
plating on the proscenium

618
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
there's gold plating outside on the

619
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
marquee the sign is gold

620
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I think this all probably looks great

621
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
in person and adds to the

622
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
feeling of like this is a very refreshed

623
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
show

624
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
there's little things like

625
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
so what I watched was an interview with

626
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
it's an archivist talking to

627
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I think Ken Ricci

628
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
who was the main producer of the show

629
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
and he

630
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
was clearly really excited about everything

631
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
they did and

632
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
just these little things that you'd never know that

633
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Max Buff and Melvin

634
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
the heads on the wall

635
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
he said their eyeballs

636
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
were stickers before

637
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
they were just little stick on

638
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
pupils and just little things like that

639
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
that like alright now they've rendered that

640
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
that's actually a sculpted eye

641
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
that looks better

642
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
and this guy Ken is clearly

643
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
a fan that's what you get

644
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
from it because he's considering

645
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
every possibility

646
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
of what would you miss that we might

647
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
take out and he

648
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
here's the degree of fan that he is

649
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
is that he said you're gonna notice

650
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
a lack of clacking

651
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
and we even talked about

652
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
how do we retain the clacking

653
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I think people like the clacking

654
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
and this is incredible to hear

655
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Disney Imagineers say because

656
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
clacking comes into play in anything

657
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
like this that we talk about

658
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
going back to see the ones in

659
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
the Make Believe band in Northridge

660
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
the Chuck E. Cheese band you're like

661
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
maybe I want to hear the clacking

662
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
the clacking is part of it or I'm creeped out by the clacking

663
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
or my kid doesn't like the clacking

664
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
clacking is part of the old animatronic experience

665
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I feel and apparently

666
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
especially with them with the heads

667
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
they were like maybe we can keep the clacking

668
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
maybe there's a charm to it

669
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
and they didn't because

670
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
and I didn't get this

671
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
from the videos either that apparently

672
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
the heads talk as soon as you

673
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
start coming in

674
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I think they didn't do it

675
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
in the videos that have been posted at this

676
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
juncture but instead of

677
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
they're just there creepily and maybe

678
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
clacking a little bit

679
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
they're making comments

680
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
and telling you to like sit your beer butt

681
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
down or whatever

682
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
from the second you get in there

683
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
and I think I don't know there's something about

684
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
like the clacking was going to compete

685
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
with the music but they actually

686
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
like maybe we keep the clack we might want to keep

687
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
the clack I mean I love that that's a

688
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
conversation I love that they probably burned

689
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
hours on keeping

690
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
the thing that shouldn't be

691
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
that feels like a mistake

692
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
but some mistakes become part of it

693
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
because we all love animatronics

694
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
and we all have an affection for the clacking

695
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
like if you hear clacking

696
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
in this episode from both of my co's

697
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
canker sores

698
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
that's where we keep that in there

699
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
because it's part of the charm

700
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
it's part of it

701
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
we could edit it out but

702
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I can't

703
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
hear it from here but if the listeners are hearing

704
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Mike's microphone

705
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
if somehow it was really

706
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
ASMR

707
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
in my mind it is but I hope it's not

708
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
in your brain

709
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
that's how you're hearing it

710
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
anyway but they did put

711
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
electric motors in the eyes

712
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
and the mouths it's the old

713
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
casing and bodies but

714
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
electric instead of

715
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
what hydraulic is what it would have been before

716
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
also part of this

717
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Q&A some history

718
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
that I didn't know I don't think I knew that

719
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
we definitely talked about that

720
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
thing that this was supposed to be part of the mineral

721
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
king resort that this is going to be a show

722
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
for this Walt Disney

723
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Run ski resort I don't think

724
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I didn't feel familiar to me that

725
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
the original plans was for it to be called

726
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
bear band restaurant

727
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
and that it was going to be outdoors

728
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
which sounds pretty hellish

729
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
at this point I was going to say that sounds like a bad idea

730
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
I think so

731
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
I've heard bear band restaurant but I didn't know it was outdoors

732
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
that's what they said yeah that initial

733
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
plan because wait I'm forgetting now

734
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
was this opening day Magic Kingdom

735
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
or was it a little later

736
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
I think it was opening day wasn't it I think so

737
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I think so it came to

738
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Disneyland later yes

739
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
when it was well received

740
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
so that's why they built the double theatre

741
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
which was sort of an undoing

742
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
there is a reference to

743
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
mineral king in the show

744
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
yeah it's a fun little nod

745
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
that's where one of the guys used to

746
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
play there's

747
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
one for the heads

748
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
but yeah bear band restaurant

749
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
outdoors was one plan and then

750
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
they enclosed it

751
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
and here's really from the Q&A

752
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
what I wanted to

753
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
address which is that

754
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
the show is based on

755
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Mark Davis

756
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
caricatures who was

757
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
the most well known for

758
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
putting so much

759
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
character and

760
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
humor in his concept art

761
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
which was retained all the way through

762
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
the animatronic but if you're looking at it like an

763
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
inherently funny silly looking

764
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
animatronic especially in the old days

765
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
it might be from Mark Davis

766
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
so these bears

767
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
who are trying their best but they're

768
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
they look a little silly they have silly proportions

769
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
and they're playing their instruments funny

770
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
I think the initial concept

771
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
art from Mark Davis was very successful

772
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
and Walt Disney was brought in

773
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
to look at this

774
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
you know in November

775
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
1966

776
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
and it killed it he laughed

777
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
and laughed boy did he love

778
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
it didn't kill him though

779
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
that's a good point

780
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
if you recognize the date that I said

781
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
he laughed himself into the grave

782
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
people think cancer

783
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
what it was was he laughed at the country bears

784
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
it weakened his lungs to the point where

785
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
he couldn't handle a big laughing fit

786
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
and sure enough

787
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
yes and his body was slumped

788
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
over the art of the bears

789
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
no just like

790
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
great and he's like thumbs up you're heading in the right

791
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
direction I love it

792
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
and then in the Q&A the guy's like

793
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
you know after not too long

794
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
he had passed so we refer to that

795
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
as Walt's last laugh

796
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
what?

797
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
isn't that freaky?

798
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
yes this is part of the mythology

799
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
now we're learning so much it's Walt's

800
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
lamp and he loves Palm Springs

801
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
and Cotino and now we know about

802
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
the country bears caused his last

803
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
laugh oh my god

804
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Walt's last laugh if you google

805
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Walt's last laugh does it come up is that like a

806
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
I haven't tried I don't know

807
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
um that's a good

808
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
well it looks like people are

809
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
well what you get is a lot of breaking bad

810
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
oh yeah

811
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
because he because Walter

812
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
White kind of dies

813
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
manic laughter yeah I see that

814
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
oh wait there is a little bit okay yes

815
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
we call it actually this is from 2012

816
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
we call it Walt's last laugh because of

817
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
the nice chuckle Walt got after seeing some

818
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
of Mark Davis's drawings

819
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
that said

820
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
pretty weird mythology isn't it

821
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
and how do we know that he

822
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
didn't laugh at something at his house

823
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
before he died

824
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
what if one of the doctors treating

825
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
him slipped and fell

826
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
or some loose medicine

827
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
yeah what about the woman who

828
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
would treat his polo injury

829
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
every afternoon she had to give a couple laughs

830
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
I would imagine in between rubbing

831
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
the injury yeah that's part

832
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
of it isn't it I would think it would be

833
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
right bald jokes

834
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
yeah I don't think we can say

835
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
this definitively I you know

836
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
I hope Walt got a lot more laughs

837
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
in but it's interesting mythology

838
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
to know about I also

839
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
like to think about him laughing like

840
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Walter White

841
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
in the crawl space laugh yeah

842
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
that it starts as like

843
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
oh good Walt likes it and then it continues

844
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
for a sustained minute and a half

845
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
vaguely psychotic

846
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
should we

847
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
leave maybe we leave Walt here

848
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
okay

849
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
so Walt's last laugh

850
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
the saddest phrase

851
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
here's the other stuff that because

852
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
if you watch videos of it you know that something's

853
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
up with the animatronics

854
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
you know that it is improved but they also

855
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
look so much the same

856
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
which is a great victory right that

857
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
and again that we didn't end up in some

858
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
area like actually I just thought of

859
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
a new one

860
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Country Bear musical

861
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
and it's high school musical style

862
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
and all of the high school musical songs

863
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
and one and one of the Bears has Corbin

864
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Blues hair this is also

865
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
something you could see them doing in

866
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
2011 maybe a little

867
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
bit they would have done it a little late like a little

868
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
post like they just missed the

869
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
popularity of their own thing

870
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
but thank God they didn't do anything

871
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
of this nature you know

872
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
but they you know

873
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
you could tell that they're refurbished

874
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
but I wasn't really sure how and now

875
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
I've figured out what happened

876
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
it's the same bodies

877
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
it's the same if you ever see if you've seen a stripped

878
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
animatronic if you've been so lucky

879
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
it feels like you know

880
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
there's like there's like big

881
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
glass or plastic pieces that make

882
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
the you know like a big rotund tummy

883
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
or whatever it is I think that

884
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
stuff like the molding is the same

885
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
but it's new fur it's

886
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
new skin it's a modern

887
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
control system

888
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
so it's basically

889
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
it's a weird these all the robots are a weird fusion

890
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
right where like the you know

891
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
the outsides are new

892
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
and the base is the same but

893
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
it's like it's a hybrid

894
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
of like some hydraulic

895
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
but some of the newer technology

896
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
right

897
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
and I hadn't heard any of this

898
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
phraseology before

899
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
tell me if we've ever talked about this but I

900
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
don't feel like we have that the original

901
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
original animatronics

902
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
were considered A1

903
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
audio animatronics

904
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
this is what all of the old school ones

905
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
would have been classified as

906
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
A1 and now these are

907
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
A1 A100

908
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
hybrids

909
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
and A100 is

910
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
defined maybe by

911
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Wicked Witch in Great

912
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Movie Ride remember how great that

913
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
animatronic was I think all the others

914
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
in that ride are A1s

915
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
they're a little more simple they turn their head a

916
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
little bit but that one gesticulates

917
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
to this kind of shocking degree

918
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
where it you know feels very

919
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
photorealistic

920
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
newer presidents I think

921
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
at least Obama and everything

922
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
after have been

923
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
A100s and then

924
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
A1000 starts with

925
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Hondo Onaka

926
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
and maybe

927
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Lieutenant Beck and

928
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Kyla Ren in Rise of the

929
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Resistance I think like it's not all new

930
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
animatronics but a lot of them

931
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
are A1000s

932
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
now I like this numerical system

933
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
I like that it is

934
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
done with Terminator

935
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
logic I was going to say it's

936
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Terminator numbers yeah

937
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
to where yeah eventually

938
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
all out of the 3D

939
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
movie we end up with A1

940
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
million and

941
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
A1 million tries to haunt us

942
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
down in Killitz it's a

943
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
partial liquid it starts out

944
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
reaches out and

945
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
caresses your cheek

946
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
like

947
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Mike imagine

948
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Mike getting you know I'm proud

949
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
of you from Optimus

950
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
and it like he wipes

951
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
away a tear

952
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
yeah that'll be the day well Michael

953
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
will be in great support of

954
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Michael will love the

955
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
A1 millions I will love the A1 millions

956
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
we certainly I don't think

957
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
had time to talk about this distinction

958
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
on the Great Movie Ride episode I

959
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
will say that I don't think there was enough

960
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
room it was in my notes and

961
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
this guy came in and messed everything up

962
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
and before you know it we're all sucking on jewels

963
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
it's one of the things that's torn me up for years

964
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
that we didn't get to talk about A100

965
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
and A1 million maybe we just have to do

966
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
another Great Movie Ride episode

967
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
and then just like lock the doors

968
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
yeah yeah and there will be

969
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
no shenanigans that episode is called

970
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Great Movie Ride 2 this

971
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
time boring yes

972
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
and there will be no shenanigans and we

973
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
we are very clear there will

974
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
be no other people than the three

975
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
of us getting into that one

976
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
yeah and certainly there's not some way that

977
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
he could come in through the vents

978
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
no as far we'll do our best

979
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
burrow a tunnel through the ground

980
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
like a Bugs Bunny

981
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
situation

982
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
I started in China

983
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
and went all the way through

984
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
at first I busted out of

985
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Xing Xing anyway

986
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
so that's what we're dealing with here is that now

987
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
they are they have like half

988
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
leveled up they're almost

989
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
wicked which but not completely

990
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
but they can sure do a lot more

991
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
than they used to be able to do there's also

992
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
there's a thing that came into play with A100

993
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
that I'd never heard of before

994
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
which is a new control system

995
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
control system called compliance

996
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
and here again we are

997
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
in kind of scary sci-fi movie

998
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
compliance is just like a way that

999
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
they could like basically

1000
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
like an old

1001
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Abraham Lincoln original Lincoln

1002
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
robot could not suddenly

1003
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
do a karate chop right

1004
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
because then the entire body would shake around

1005
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
in this weird way but compliance

1006
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
is this level of control or actually gives

1007
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
actually it gives a little bit of freedom to the

1008
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
robot where it can like stop

1009
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
a little bit past where we say that

1010
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
you can stop that's what's happening with these

1011
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
robots is that like what we'd like

1012
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
you to stop here but that's just like where you need

1013
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
to start slowing down so they

1014
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
so it's like

1015
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
what's the like

1016
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
it's like a car

1017
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
being able to like

1018
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
slow to a halt as opposed

1019
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
to basically

1020
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
like newer robots aren't

1021
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
faster they're just they

1022
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
have more they have more control

1023
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
and they can slow they're more precise and they could

1024
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
slow down kind of

1025
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
of their own volition apparently

1026
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
yeah yeah so it's not

1027
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
even though some of these robots feel very

1028
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
like a big sweeping motion of the

1029
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
shaman of song

1030
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
like well

1031
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
the rumor is one of the rumors for

1032
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
D23 is that there's going to be

1033
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
a Walt animatronic coming

1034
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
to Disneyland this is still really

1035
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
I've heard a couple that's what people are saying

1036
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
at the very least they did like some presentation

1037
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
where there was like a hologram Walt

1038
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
which kind of looked like deep fake Walt

1039
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
which I am not as interested in as

1040
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
an actual robot because like they

1041
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
there's apparently been like some sort of patent

1042
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
filed or work permit

1043
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
for like

1044
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
putting in another spot on the Lincoln

1045
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
stage so when it flips over there will be a

1046
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
spot for a robot or something

1047
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
there and people are speculating

1048
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
for the 70th anniversary

1049
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
you're going to get like a little Walt presentation

1050
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
and then it'll spin around and do the Lincoln

1051
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
so he'll explain this was his idea

1052
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
very country bear that there's a little like side

1053
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
stage yes Walt does

1054
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
a little side show so I like the idea

1055
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
that there like this is a Walt is going to be

1056
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
an A1000

1057
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Walt if that's if the rumor comes

1058
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
to pass or or

1059
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
hopefully a million hopefully it's hopefully

1060
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
it's a Walt that can liquefy

1061
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
and then also something I'm worried

1062
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
about Bugsy doing yeah like

1063
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
yeah Walt can split

1064
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
into 10,000 pieces

1065
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
and then reform yeah and climb

1066
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
into your water bottle go home with you

1067
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
and then give you a scare oh man if the

1068
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
at the Honda Center you reveal liquid

1069
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Walt to like

1070
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
10,000 15,000 fans

1071
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
he goes they send liquid Walt

1072
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
through the sprinkler system

1073
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
and then he reforms on stage

1074
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
and starts picking up audience

1075
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
members throwing some devouring

1076
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
others no I was okay that we were probably

1077
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
not going to D23 until now until

1078
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
we hear that yeah shit so

1079
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
liquid Walt well they're

1080
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
look they need bodies they need bodies

1081
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
to begin the battle against

1082
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
the Walt one million well I want to do

1083
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
it somebody get us in now to

1084
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
somebody get us on the press list to D23

1085
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
because I want to get that's why

1086
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
they

1087
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
are doing the Honda Center

1088
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
like the different kind

1089
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
of compliance of like

1090
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
no bags unless they're clear

1091
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
plastic and this size and this

1092
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
size because they want to make sure the

1093
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
liquid Walt perfectly fits

1094
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
oh yeah yeah oh yeah

1095
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
smart yeah yeah

1096
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
he can perfectly divvy up little

1097
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
pieces of himself to every audience

1098
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
member that would be a real show stopper after

1099
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
they explain when the portos is opening in

1100
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
downtown Disney and then they finally go right

1101
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
when we have one more thing and then

1102
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
liquid Walt for Disneyland

1103
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
that's the main yeah yeah

1104
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
that's the I know we once again we're building up

1105
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
D23 to be a lot and yeah it could be

1106
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
like the Lego store is getting a new

1107
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
sign

1108
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
well we will see

1109
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
now didn't we

1110
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
address when we did an episode

1111
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
about the partner statue yeah

1112
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
but the statue of Walt holding hands with Nicky

1113
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
in several of the parks

1114
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
did we didn't we discuss

1115
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
that one of his wishes was to

1116
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
not be yeah yeah portrayed

1117
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
in a physical form in the parks or

1118
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
in anything and now they're gonna make a robot of him

1119
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
mm-hmm okay yeah well

1120
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
well he did the statue and that broke the dam on

1121
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
it I think yeah yeah it was like well

1122
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
fuck him whatever

1123
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
here's the statue of

1124
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
him dreaming and

1125
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
it's like taking a crap

1126
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
you can touch it it's

1127
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
scalding hot metal in Florida

1128
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
sunlight hot there's hot Walt

1129
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
in Epcot there's a liquid

1130
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Walt in Disneyland

1131
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
there's all the different varieties

1132
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
and cold Walt's

1133
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
head yeah yeah

1134
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
freezer somewhere so yeah no they

1135
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
he's he's really

1136
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
rolling in his grave mm-hmm and

1137
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
also something that they will portray soon

1138
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
that he's rolling yeah goes yeah

1139
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
our new technology that our

1140
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
our new electric motors

1141
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
allow Walt to spin in his grave

1142
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
in the haunted mansion

1143
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
oh yeah

1144
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
much faster than any robot could have fifty

1145
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
years ago that's cool

1146
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
so anyways

1147
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
that's a lot of the stuff they did

1148
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
I found that a little interesting

1149
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
that it's like because you could tell

1150
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
something's up they these are improved

1151
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
and again a big victory something that I don't

1152
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
think would have happened in the 2000s I think

1153
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
they would have just like slapped wigs

1154
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
on him done something disgusting

1155
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
and but here we get like

1156
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
kind of I think thoughtfully

1157
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
revamped animatronics

1158
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
and that's cool and if people

1159
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
want to do you have a

1160
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
account for a good quality

1161
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
version of this Q&A

1162
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
I think laughing place

1163
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
posted one oh cool

1164
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
there is a there's a cell phone that goes off

1165
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
for a full pass and maybe

1166
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
one more during the Q&A so just be

1167
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
warned about that but that's not the fault of

1168
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
laughing place or them engineers or anyone

1169
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
no they're usually pretty reliable I single you out

1170
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
whoever in the audience let that go

1171
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
for the whole time rude

1172
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
oh also it's literally

1173
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
programmed by the these

1174
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
animatronics were programmed by

1175
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
the guy who programmed the first

1176
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
A100 the wicked witch his name's

1177
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Doug Griffith who was like the

1178
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
master in the 90s he's the guy

1179
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
who did all the programming of all the most fluid

1180
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
robots that moved it all

1181
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
forward you know when we were

1182
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
kids and soaking it all up

1183
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
journey into imagination was him

1184
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
American adventure was him kitchen cabaret

1185
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
horizons

1186
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
the sword fighting

1187
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
pirates that are just in the Pirates of the

1188
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Caribbean in Disneyland Paris

1189
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
which were kind of a big next step

1190
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
step forward in

1191
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
animatronic fluidity this guy's a legend

1192
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
he is a legend and this is his final

1193
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
work in the parks he is retiring

1194
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
after this that's cool we are seeing

1195
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
like a master who really knows who

1196
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
redid the country bears already in 92

1197
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
so he knows the characters and he's given

1198
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
him one more go

1199
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
that's really cool he was already like

1200
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
settled in on his houseboat

1201
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
in Florida and they're like we need you to come

1202
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
back for one more job

1203
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
it's like I don't do that

1204
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
anymore

1205
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
what if we told you

1206
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
they were going to sing you've got a friend in me

1207
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
god damn it on him

1208
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
sounds good can I just say them calling

1209
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
the D23 parks presentation

1210
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
horizons is really

1211
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
setting up the expectations

1212
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
like crazy you saw that right

1213
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
they're calling it horizons

1214
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
that building they

1215
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
bulldozed and it might

1216
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
have a permanent sinkhole

1217
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
around there

1218
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
but I just had to say that because I'm like

1219
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
you can't do that you cannot

1220
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
set us up like this

1221
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
the expectation wise I know they're not bringing

1222
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
back horizons but still

1223
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
that would be a shocker wouldn't it

1224
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
I would fall on the floor yes

1225
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
the longest ride with the most animatronics

1226
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
just brought back there's no way

1227
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
we're going to rebuild the future of the 80s

1228
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
but I guess maybe they'll replace the other

1229
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
build like maybe that's the announcement but still

1230
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
like calling you can't call it that don't do

1231
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
that to us that is mean

1232
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
what is on the horizons new

1233
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
experiences new

1234
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
dumplings perhaps

1235
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
it could be anything

1236
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
new strategic partnerships with big box stores

1237
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
ladies and gentlemen the CEO

1238
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
of Kohl's

1239
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
we've got many

1240
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Sephora stores in

1241
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
our stores we've got many

1242
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
champion stores now

1243
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
we've got many Disney

1244
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
stores horizons

1245
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
and they're playing like the horizons music or something

1246
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
could be

1247
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
you can't do that we have to my

1248
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
expectations are now

1249
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
in the toilet

1250
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
D23 tied with

1251
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Biden's electoral chances

1252
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
and if either goes better and I'll

1253
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
just be pleasantly surprised I want

1254
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
to be I want to be front row at D23 now

1255
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
the Honda Center to boo if they do

1256
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
like horizon bait and switch

1257
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
so now if somebody can get us in

1258
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
D23 all I want to do

1259
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
is front row so you have to do that for

1260
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
us so we can boo when

1261
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
they like say something about her

1262
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
horizons you go oh yeah and they're like we're

1263
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
putting a Kohl's where horizons used to

1264
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
be in Epcot well

1265
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
I hope you're ready for the Walt

1266
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
one million to

1267
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
form its liquid arm into

1268
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
a giant ice pick

1269
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
and just like nab you in the forehead

1270
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
really fast in less than a second

1271
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
and that's the end of that threat

1272
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
I'm nervous about the panel because I've got

1273
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
a parlay bet on what color

1274
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Josh tomorrow's bomber jacket will

1275
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
be so if

1276
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
I'm brewing if it's not

1277
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
black it's okay okay

1278
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
we talked about Brown's see you

1279
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
can't count out Brown because Brown's a little

1280
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
homey that's like launch pad

1281
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
that is cool yeah

1282
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
we talked about betting right for the 23

1283
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
yeah yeah we'll have to figure that out

1284
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
yeah yeah I don't think we've we haven't

1285
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
gotten the nitty gritty on that

1286
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
so that's that's

1287
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
some backstory to the new show

1288
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
and I did appreciate that that Q&A and everything

1289
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
and

1290
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
I don't know where we go from here do we start

1291
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
talking about this about the show

1292
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
I mean there's personnel also

1293
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
but that could kind of come as we go

1294
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
I mean I think it bears mentioning

1295
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
that

1296
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
one of the big reasons

1297
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
for hope and excitement within

1298
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
this group of three especially with

1299
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
one of this group of three was

1300
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
the involvement of a name

1301
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
that feels so coincidental and so

1302
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
up Mike's alley

1303
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
that it feels

1304
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
like a simulation buzz buzz

1305
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
that one of your favorite

1306
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
people human beings

1307
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
yeah yeah as part of this

1308
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
of this refresh is this a good time to talk

1309
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
about that of yeah Mac McAnally

1310
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Mac McAnally Jimmy

1311
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Buffett's right hand man and you didn't

1312
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
need to say that because again most listeners know

1313
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
that well yeah that context

1314
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
is not needed but but yeah

1315
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
a long time coral reefer band

1316
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
member Mac McAnally

1317
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
who's really

1318
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
having seen Jimmy with you once

1319
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
is the real musical muscle

1320
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
of the show

1321
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
one of my complaints about

1322
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
the show that I saw on some

1323
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
of Jimmy's songs in general is the feeling

1324
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
that it's not the most

1325
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
musically ambitious it's a little

1326
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
it's laid back which is what his vibe

1327
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
is so I shouldn't be surprised

1328
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
but it's you know alright it's

1329
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
alright and C to A

1330
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
to D

1331
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
if you get any musical bang out of

1332
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
those shows it is Mac McAnally

1333
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
a stellar musician who

1334
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
gets like a moment to shine

1335
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
has his own robust body of work

1336
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
in time country music

1337
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
CMA musician

1338
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
of the year

1339
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
how is that I don't

1340
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
confused by that isn't there more

1341
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
pop are there more popular

1342
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
country musicians than Mac McAnally

1343
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
to give this award to

1344
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
I think he's written a lot of

1345
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
he's written like back where I come

1346
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
from

1347
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
I just got this email

1348
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
that says that this morning

1349
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
I guess I don't care but who did back where I come from

1350
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
again we say these things

1351
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
I don't know what that is really

1352
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
I know that song and I'm

1353
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
blanking on who did it

1354
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
well there you go y'all he did back where I come from

1355
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
who's the artist of that song

1356
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
silence for one straight minute

1357
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Kenny Chesney

1358
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
I could kind of hum it though

1359
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
that's something

1360
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Mac does it too when he plays

1361
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
he did it when we saw

1362
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Jimmy

1363
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
did he do it with Jimmy or was that when Jimmy

1364
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Jimmy leaves the stage for a second or two

1365
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
or a second or two like ten minutes

1366
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
to chill out

1367
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
yeah and Mac plays his own shows

1368
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
he's playing solo he's doing a tour

1369
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
now

1370
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
now how do you know that Mike

1371
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
so I

1372
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
forget because I follow him on all the social medias

1373
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
I assume this is where we're going with this

1374
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
yeah and

1375
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
I've been waiting for him to do a California date

1376
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
for years and he hasn't done one

1377
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
I think since I was aware of him

1378
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
he hasn't done one and I saw that he was playing

1379
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
California he's doing I think the troubadour in Los Angeles

1380
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
but he's also playing Buck Owens

1381
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Crystal Palace

1382
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
which is in Bakersfield

1383
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
and man this is a place I would like to go

1384
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
it is kind of a drive

1385
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
dude let's get an episode out of it

1386
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
let's get an episode

1387
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
I think there's enough bullshit in Bakersfield

1388
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
I was talking to Scott about this

1389
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
and I said this is interesting

1390
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
because these dates are in August and I said

1391
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
let me take a look at the dates

1392
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
I wonder if Mac's going to be

1393
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
at D23 because

1394
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
that's what the second weekend in August

1395
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
and sure enough his

1396
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
D23 weekend is free

1397
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
the troubadour is on like maybe the Thursday

1398
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
or Friday before and then the Crystal

1399
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Palace is let's say Tuesday after

1400
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
D23 and the D23 dates

1401
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
are opened up

1402
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
so Scott thought I was stalking Mac by

1403
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
tracking his tour

1404
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
I thought it was funny that you said

1405
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
I think Mac's going to be at D23

1406
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
he's free

1407
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
and I was like well he's free

1408
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
unless his grandkids having a birthday

1409
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
how do we know

1410
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
you don't know everything about what Mac

1411
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
is doing

1412
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
the chances of him being he's in Los Angeles

1413
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
already those dates are open

1414
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
I'm saying it's highly likely

1415
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
I didn't go through like some records

1416
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
I didn't hack his phone or something

1417
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
I'm just saying it would make sense

1418
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
that he would be at D23 with this ride opening

1419
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
that he produced and is a voice on

1420
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
I think it was the phrasing he's free

1421
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
what if he's got a medical appointment

1422
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
I mean I don't know what he's doing in the morning

1423
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
but in the afternoon or night

1424
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
he's probably at D23

1425
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
he's got a lot of breakfast

1426
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
I think it's an instinct maybe

1427
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
from

1428
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
to a lesser extent

1429
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
whether someone will show up at a comic con

1430
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
but wrestling when

1431
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
someone's a free agent or about to

1432
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
be a free agent and you look at their

1433
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
tour dates and it's like oh

1434
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
well they're doing this show but

1435
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
such and such promotion

1436
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
is in town the next day

1437
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
so they could show up there

1438
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
well yes thank you for justifying

1439
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
mild

1440
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
stalkerish behavior

1441
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
mild

1442
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
my joke

1443
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
was like

1444
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
that you weren't

1445
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
that you actually don't have the full picture

1446
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
of Mac Mcmally

1447
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
I don't know for sure what he could be

1448
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
doing that weekend perhaps Los

1449
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Angeles he has other business it's just

1450
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
very coincidental that he's there

1451
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
during that

1452
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
unless he's added dates

1453
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
well it's like you know we're going to be at

1454
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
comic con doing the street sharks

1455
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
panel and coincidentally

1456
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
also nearby

1457
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
is hall H and maybe we're getting announced

1458
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
as

1459
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
three of the fantastic

1460
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
four in the

1461
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
the next phase of the fantastic

1462
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
once they reset this one

1463
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
then we're three of the four

1464
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
sometimes there have been three

1465
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
the new fantastic

1466
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
four

1467
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
what is it hulk wolverine

1468
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
spider-man and there's

1469
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
another occasionally

1470
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
versions I can't remember

1471
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
we'll be in hall H yes

1472
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
we'll just take care of that one

1473
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
we won't be mysterious like Mac

1474
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
maybe Mac will be in hall H too though

1475
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
maybe he's doing music for fantastic four

1476
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
ding-a-ding-a-ding-a-ding-a-ding-a-ding

1477
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
so his involvement

1478
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
that's again it's crazy you're like

1479
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
yeah again what podcast

1480
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
theme park podcast talks about Mack Mcenally at

1481
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
length yeah and then for him

1482
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
to be like a main figure on

1483
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
this is pretty wild and the

1484
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
potentially scary news of this ride

1485
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
this attraction getting redone but it's

1486
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
by somebody who you trust

1487
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
yes I assume

1488
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
I think so

1489
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
I guess with that

1490
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:06,160
We probably have to figure out, did they pull it off or not?

1491
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:14,440
And I mean, here's the big, maybe the big thing to say is that it is mostly songs from

1492
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:17,840
the Disney library and catalog, right?

1493
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:18,840
Yes.

1494
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:26,840
Songs from movies, done country-fied, done in very country bear style.

1495
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:31,400
I definitely saw people just looking at the set list, having not watched the show and

1496
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:34,960
saying that it feels boring to them.

1497
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:35,960
Yeah.

1498
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:38,040
So that's a sentiment that is out there.

1499
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:39,040
Yes.

1500
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:40,120
Did we feel this way?

1501
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:42,240
How did you both feel?

1502
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:45,720
I feel conflicted.

1503
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:47,320
The bears look great.

1504
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:48,320
You talked about this.

1505
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:50,360
The fur is bright and vibrant.

1506
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:51,360
Yes.

1507
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:52,360
Looks nice.

1508
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:54,200
The new outfits are great.

1509
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:55,800
Their little outfits.

1510
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:58,520
Everyone's little outfit is really good.

1511
00:50:58,520 --> 00:50:59,920
The show sounds cool.

1512
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:05,040
It's great to see the bears, just feeling the love that was put into the bear robots

1513
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:06,920
is nice to see on video.

1514
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:10,720
I can appreciate all that.

1515
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:13,160
It's a fun show.

1516
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:14,880
I think kids will go in there.

1517
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:16,080
They'll see funny bears.

1518
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:17,920
They'll hear songs they like.

1519
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:19,440
They will laugh.

1520
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:20,440
They will applaud.

1521
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:22,440
I'm scared by this tone.

1522
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:24,600
They'll like it.

1523
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:27,620
Their smiles will be formed on faces.

1524
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:30,660
Now that said, there is a turn.

1525
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:33,300
You interrupted whatever turn I was going to take.

1526
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:34,300
But that's okay.

1527
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:40,060
Maybe you blunted any sort of anger that was going to ... No, I'm not angry.

1528
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:44,300
It feels a little bit like an ad for Disney.

1529
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:51,460
It just feels a little bit like, yeah, they're doing the songs in a different style.

1530
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:55,100
I would say my biggest complaint, and maybe this is wrong.

1531
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:56,100
Maybe people will disagree.

1532
00:51:56,140 --> 00:51:59,940
It feels like the characters of the bears aren't there.

1533
00:51:59,940 --> 00:52:05,180
It almost feels like the main joke is just, can you believe this bear is singing that

1534
00:52:05,180 --> 00:52:13,140
song you know versus a bunch of hillbilly bears singing about being sad and horny, which

1535
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:18,740
is what the old show was, which I agree maybe you don't need in a park in 2024.

1536
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:22,220
So I understand why you would want to redo the show.

1537
00:52:22,220 --> 00:52:28,180
But now the main joke of the show is like, oh, they're doing the song from Aladdin.

1538
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:30,660
Oh, okay.

1539
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:36,620
Versus I can't believe that this bear is singing about ... Tears in a wine.

1540
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:42,500
Tears, yes, which is like a sad song or going out and having women be upset with him because

1541
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:46,900
he can't cheat on his wife or something.

1542
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:49,540
It's a much simpler game, whatever you would call it.

1543
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:55,660
It's a much simpler concept now, which again, I think people will like, and I like too,

1544
00:52:55,660 --> 00:52:58,260
it's just like, it feels kind of like an ad.

1545
00:52:58,260 --> 00:53:01,860
It feels a little bit like an ad for the other songs in the Disney catalog.

1546
00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:09,540
Well, it creates an insular world where only Disney songs and properties exist.

1547
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:10,540
Yeah.

1548
00:53:10,540 --> 00:53:11,540
Doesn't it?

1549
00:53:11,540 --> 00:53:13,540
It's like a little bit of closing off of the bubble.

1550
00:53:13,540 --> 00:53:17,940
We found a place where there was a leak in the bubble and we patched it up.

1551
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:19,780
Right, yes, yes.

1552
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:25,340
There is ... Adam Resnick is the one who wrote Cabin Boy.

1553
00:53:25,340 --> 00:53:26,540
Yeah, yeah.

1554
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:33,780
He has a book of essays and there's a pretty funny one where he talks about him and his

1555
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:40,380
family going to Disney World with his sister-in-law's family and they are like die-hards and him

1556
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:44,500
and his family don't really give a shit and they have a terrible time.

1557
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:45,500
The weather is bad.

1558
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:46,500
The parks are crowded.

1559
00:53:46,740 --> 00:53:51,140
They're staying at the wilderness lodge and his daughter is not enjoying any of that and

1560
00:53:51,140 --> 00:53:56,460
they walk back in the wilderness lodge and I think the big goofy bear from the wilderness

1561
00:53:56,460 --> 00:54:02,540
lodge from those old cartoons is there and she says something along the lines of like,

1562
00:54:02,540 --> 00:54:11,020
oh, God, they're here too and I think that's kind of, you know, was along the lines of

1563
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:15,820
what Mike is saying like, oh, God, the songs are here too.

1564
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:16,820
I see.

1565
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:22,660
I know it's the middle of a Disney theme park but I think the thing that always appealed

1566
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:29,580
to me since I was a little kid is like you can't get country bears, you can't see the

1567
00:54:29,580 --> 00:54:35,100
show anywhere else, you can't get Alien Encounter anywhere else, you can't get the people and

1568
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:38,300
that's kind of what I locked in on.

1569
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:39,660
Sure.

1570
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:42,500
I think a big thing that's always appealed to me.

1571
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:47,300
So by doing songs that exist in other forms, it feels a little less specific.

1572
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:53,060
My other big thing is like it is fair, like it's not a bad thing because, you know, kids

1573
00:54:53,060 --> 00:55:00,140
only have so much patience but this show is fair, like they are doing snippets of these

1574
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:03,140
songs and it's on to the next one.

1575
00:55:03,140 --> 00:55:07,180
Well that feels, the show feels shorter, definitely.

1576
00:55:07,180 --> 00:55:09,740
I feel like it was always snippets.

1577
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:11,820
There were always some really short, you know.

1578
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:14,020
Yeah, 30 second, 45 second little song.

1579
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:15,020
Yes.

1580
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:16,020
Yeah.

1581
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:18,460
So that's not necessarily, but it definitely feels like they whip through it.

1582
00:55:18,460 --> 00:55:21,540
It feels like, I think like less characters, right?

1583
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:23,380
I think some are out entirely.

1584
00:55:23,380 --> 00:55:29,460
A big gripe I have is they combine Trixie and the Sunbonnets into one musical number.

1585
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:31,740
They don't get their own numbers now.

1586
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:34,540
And Trixie does not come back at the end.

1587
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:36,180
Oh, do they not?

1588
00:55:36,820 --> 00:55:41,300
Henry and the raccoon are in that spot.

1589
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:46,240
So yes, that's like right away where you're like, well, they're all, they had to combine

1590
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:47,780
the characters.

1591
00:55:47,780 --> 00:55:48,780
That bums me out.

1592
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:52,900
They became backup singers instead of leaders of their own songs.

1593
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:57,260
I mean the Sunbonnet Trio, that's the best song in the old show.

1594
00:55:57,260 --> 00:55:59,540
The guy to turn me on, turn me down.

1595
00:55:59,540 --> 00:56:01,780
If you haven't seen it before, watch it.

1596
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:02,780
It's crazy.

1597
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:05,100
They want you 24 to watch, but it's fun.

1598
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:06,100
It's really funny.

1599
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:07,100
And weird.

1600
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:09,340
Now that is one of those, wait, okay.

1601
00:56:09,340 --> 00:56:16,740
Is that one, do we put that in the, in the category of cancel because they look little?

1602
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:22,660
I mean, it's really strange to say turn me on in an old song.

1603
00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:25,180
So I think that used to be a little bit different.

1604
00:56:25,180 --> 00:56:29,740
I mean, it doesn't mean the same thing, but I think turning on didn't mean like, oh my

1605
00:56:29,780 --> 00:56:34,300
God, I've been turned on versus just like, oh, like I'm really, I like this guy.

1606
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:35,780
You would use it meaning to like more.

1607
00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:39,100
I like this person and they don't like, yeah.

1608
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:41,340
So I like that turn on tone also.

1609
00:56:41,340 --> 00:56:42,340
Oh my God.

1610
00:56:42,340 --> 00:56:44,340
Hey, that's what I do.

1611
00:56:44,340 --> 00:56:45,340
Oh my God.

1612
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:46,340
It's happening.

1613
00:56:46,340 --> 00:56:47,340
Baby, look at this.

1614
00:56:47,340 --> 00:56:48,340
Too much insight here.

1615
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:49,340
It's in motion.

1616
00:56:49,340 --> 00:56:50,340
But that's what I go.

1617
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:51,340
My voice gets gravelly.

1618
00:56:51,340 --> 00:56:53,500
I sound like Wolfman Jack.

1619
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:54,500
Can you believe it?

1620
00:56:55,500 --> 00:57:01,020
You probably couldn't tell, but the blood is going haywire in my veins.

1621
00:57:01,020 --> 00:57:03,260
Look where it went.

1622
00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:10,460
My slightly below average testosterone level is getting slightly more average.

1623
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:17,820
My heart is going wild and it's not just because of any sort of defects in there.

1624
00:57:17,820 --> 00:57:22,940
Well I will also, as I said before, I'm not against the idea that you can update all this

1625
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:23,940
stuff.

1626
00:57:24,020 --> 00:57:26,940
I'm not saying that this needed to be still in the show.

1627
00:57:26,940 --> 00:57:32,220
I'm just saying that was such a funny, weird thing to have in a bear show with those three

1628
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:36,940
characters and now they're sort of just backup singers and they don't get to do anything.

1629
00:57:36,940 --> 00:57:41,380
Okay, if they've lost any character's personalities, maybe it's them.

1630
00:57:41,380 --> 00:57:46,180
Three romantically aggressive bears is fine.

1631
00:57:46,180 --> 00:57:47,620
That has definitely gone away.

1632
00:57:47,620 --> 00:57:48,620
Yeah.

1633
00:57:48,620 --> 00:57:52,500
There's a way to do that like in sort of a soft.

1634
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:55,540
And I also think, and I don't have a good example of what to do, I also think there

1635
00:57:55,540 --> 00:58:04,140
was a way to do some of it with Disney songs in clever ways and the one that they did,

1636
00:58:04,140 --> 00:58:10,180
the very least that they put a gag in is the supercalifragilisticexpialidocious number with

1637
00:58:10,180 --> 00:58:15,940
just the fiddler who his fiddle starts smoking because he's playing so fast.

1638
00:58:15,940 --> 00:58:18,140
At least you got a little joke in there.

1639
00:58:18,140 --> 00:58:20,140
That was a good gag, yeah.

1640
00:58:20,140 --> 00:58:22,300
In the lobby, there's new stuff in the lobby.

1641
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:25,180
Well the lobby looks great too, we didn't even talk about that, but the lobby they put

1642
00:58:25,180 --> 00:58:26,540
a bunch of new stuff.

1643
00:58:26,540 --> 00:58:31,820
They put the classic little teddy bear from the original in a glass case.

1644
00:58:31,820 --> 00:58:34,740
There's like a lot of fun details that they put in there.

1645
00:58:34,740 --> 00:58:40,180
Reviews of the show outside from Grizzly Gazette and Hibernation magazine.

1646
00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:48,020
There is a picture that I think raises more questions than answers, but there is a picture

1647
00:58:48,020 --> 00:58:49,860
of Henry and the ladder.

1648
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:55,820
He finds a ladder and goes up to swinging Teddy Barra and it appears they're eating

1649
00:58:55,820 --> 00:58:57,580
lunch.

1650
00:58:57,580 --> 00:59:00,900
Because the thing was like I'll be up there if I can find a ladder.

1651
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:01,900
Yes, in the original show.

1652
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:03,940
And now they've closed that loop.

1653
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:07,140
As soon as I find a ladder I'll be right up.

1654
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:11,540
Right, so all of that stuff makes me feel like okay people really cared is what you're

1655
00:59:11,540 --> 00:59:16,100
talking about, which confirms that they really wanted to put a bunch of references and stuff

1656
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:17,100
too.

1657
00:59:17,180 --> 00:59:22,900
Okay, so here's something else I got out of this Q&A was the feeling, the guy's pretty

1658
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:29,420
bald about the orders from above were the show is going to go away unless the music

1659
00:59:29,420 --> 00:59:32,060
can appeal to a broader audience.

1660
00:59:32,060 --> 00:59:33,580
Sure, that is what was said.

1661
00:59:33,580 --> 00:59:42,860
That's kind of the code for put songs people know and not like 1930s country songs.

1662
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:49,060
And that's why I wanted to like give the props and credit to that Imagineer and everybody

1663
00:59:49,060 --> 00:59:50,060
who worked on this.

1664
00:59:50,060 --> 00:59:55,980
And I think this is the epitome of something we see a lot where there's like kind of a

1665
00:59:55,980 --> 00:59:59,820
maybe you call it an odd idea or a flawed idea or something that we don't necessarily

1666
00:59:59,820 --> 01:00:05,860
agree with but that is like being executed as lovingly and carefully as possible.

1667
01:00:05,860 --> 01:00:12,540
I think that we find this a lot that the Imagineers care about what the order like let's do that

1668
01:00:12,540 --> 01:00:16,900
order the best way we can do it, even if the order is a little weird.

1669
01:00:16,900 --> 01:00:20,580
Yes, and I do feel that because like, yeah, a Tiki Room Under New Manitoum or something

1670
01:00:20,580 --> 01:00:25,980
where you feel like, I don't know that the people who made that had disdain for the parks

1671
01:00:25,980 --> 01:00:29,660
or something, but sometimes you feel that in those old rides you're talking about or

1672
01:00:29,660 --> 01:00:33,940
the old overlays where you're like, they're like, they're like, ah, this old thing sucks,

1673
01:00:33,940 --> 01:00:34,940
huh?

1674
01:00:34,940 --> 01:00:35,940
Don't you hate it?

1675
01:00:35,940 --> 01:00:36,940
Yeah.

1676
01:00:36,940 --> 01:00:37,940
Yeah.

1677
01:00:37,940 --> 01:00:38,940
And you're like attitude.

1678
01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:39,940
And that's where it feels like it's coming from.

1679
01:00:39,940 --> 01:00:42,300
And there's no attitude in the right exactly.

1680
01:00:42,540 --> 01:00:45,140
So yes, of course, of course I can appreciate that.

1681
01:00:45,140 --> 01:00:48,340
I'm being a little bit like, I don't know what to call it.

1682
01:00:48,340 --> 01:00:53,340
Well, how do we feel about, you know, there's an introductory song, which is fine, called

1683
01:00:53,340 --> 01:00:55,180
Country Bear Musical Jamboree.

1684
01:00:55,180 --> 01:00:56,180
Yes.

1685
01:00:56,180 --> 01:00:57,180
That's original.

1686
01:00:57,180 --> 01:00:58,180
That's not from Other IP.

1687
01:00:58,180 --> 01:00:59,180
Right.

1688
01:00:59,180 --> 01:01:02,460
And that's you're like, all right, the stage slides out and the five bear rugs come out

1689
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:05,020
and the hootenanny begins.

1690
01:01:05,020 --> 01:01:06,020
And it's like fine.

1691
01:01:06,020 --> 01:01:07,300
It's just like, I think it's fine.

1692
01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:11,620
I don't know why they couldn't have done the original one there.

1693
01:01:11,660 --> 01:01:15,220
I guess there's more like introducing the bears in that original one, which they maybe

1694
01:01:15,220 --> 01:01:16,220
didn't want to do.

1695
01:01:16,220 --> 01:01:17,740
They feel like we don't need to do that.

1696
01:01:17,740 --> 01:01:18,740
Yeah.

1697
01:01:18,740 --> 01:01:19,740
Don't worry about them.

1698
01:01:19,740 --> 01:01:23,180
And this one, this one definitely in the same way that Musical Jamboree underlines what

1699
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:30,300
it is, says the title to like let people know this is what's happening more, I guess.

1700
01:01:30,300 --> 01:01:31,300
Yeah.

1701
01:01:31,300 --> 01:01:33,980
Even though you see a bunch of bears with instruments, I guess you should kind of know.

1702
01:01:33,980 --> 01:01:35,580
But maybe they felt like.

1703
01:01:35,580 --> 01:01:37,500
Now some bears are coming out and they have instruments.

1704
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:38,900
Do you know that this is music?

1705
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:39,900
This is musical.

1706
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:43,340
Perhaps the premise was lost in the old way where people like, I don't know what this

1707
01:01:43,340 --> 01:01:44,340
is yet.

1708
01:01:44,340 --> 01:01:49,260
And you're like, well, let's call it Musical Jamboree in this, in the new song.

1709
01:01:49,260 --> 01:01:50,260
The song's fine.

1710
01:01:50,260 --> 01:01:51,260
I think it's fine.

1711
01:01:51,260 --> 01:01:52,260
It's fine.

1712
01:01:52,260 --> 01:01:53,260
Yeah.

1713
01:01:53,260 --> 01:01:55,700
Then we get into his first song up, Try Everything.

1714
01:01:55,700 --> 01:01:56,700
Yes, Try Everything.

1715
01:01:56,700 --> 01:02:00,460
And that sets the tone for what I think the whole show in me, because I've watched this

1716
01:02:00,460 --> 01:02:02,980
like six times, I think by now.

1717
01:02:02,980 --> 01:02:03,980
Wow.

1718
01:02:03,980 --> 01:02:04,980
And I do like it.

1719
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:06,940
I do like it more and more.

1720
01:02:06,940 --> 01:02:09,820
At first I was like, oh, it grew on me.

1721
01:02:10,740 --> 01:02:11,740
Yeah, me too.

1722
01:02:11,740 --> 01:02:15,740
I put it on when I was kind of falling asleep one night and just listened to it.

1723
01:02:15,740 --> 01:02:17,060
I wasn't really watching.

1724
01:02:17,060 --> 01:02:23,700
I was like, and so then when I watched it and I could see all their jaunty little outfits,

1725
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:24,700
I'm like.

1726
01:02:24,700 --> 01:02:25,700
The outfits are great.

1727
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:27,460
The Sunbonnets new little outfits are great.

1728
01:02:27,460 --> 01:02:29,020
I'm a big fan of them.

1729
01:02:29,020 --> 01:02:30,020
And Trixies.

1730
01:02:30,020 --> 01:02:31,020
Let's be clear.

1731
01:02:31,020 --> 01:02:32,740
We like the bears little outfits.

1732
01:02:32,740 --> 01:02:36,580
But that set the tone for me seeing it, I think, is to seeing all the Sunbonnets and

1733
01:02:36,580 --> 01:02:37,980
Trixies are together.

1734
01:02:37,980 --> 01:02:38,980
And what is this?

1735
01:02:39,140 --> 01:02:42,180
Oh, there's pictures on the back wall, but they're not that funny.

1736
01:02:42,180 --> 01:02:43,980
Oh, the characters are lost.

1737
01:02:43,980 --> 01:02:45,540
What are we doing here?

1738
01:02:45,540 --> 01:02:47,740
That sort of set the first watch for me.

1739
01:02:47,740 --> 01:02:48,980
They ruined my childhood.

1740
01:02:48,980 --> 01:02:49,980
Yes.

1741
01:02:49,980 --> 01:02:55,540
It's complicated because they did preserve the slideshow, which I feel like was just a

1742
01:02:55,540 --> 01:02:58,580
technological thing of its time.

1743
01:02:58,580 --> 01:03:00,940
And I'm like, oh, I kind of like that.

1744
01:03:00,940 --> 01:03:02,020
That did come back.

1745
01:03:02,020 --> 01:03:03,260
I can't tell what's in it.

1746
01:03:03,260 --> 01:03:05,180
The videos I've watched are too far away.

1747
01:03:05,180 --> 01:03:06,180
Yeah.

1748
01:03:06,180 --> 01:03:10,700
I think that there's, I assume, I don't know what's happening, but OK, there's some pictures.

1749
01:03:10,700 --> 01:03:15,060
Trixie is like skiing and then she's trying, I think, pottery.

1750
01:03:15,060 --> 01:03:16,060
And then.

1751
01:03:16,060 --> 01:03:17,060
OK.

1752
01:03:17,060 --> 01:03:22,260
But yeah, they're like she's sailing here and they're Mark Davis concept art territory.

1753
01:03:22,260 --> 01:03:23,860
Bears looking silly.

1754
01:03:23,860 --> 01:03:24,860
It's not.

1755
01:03:24,860 --> 01:03:25,860
Trying things.

1756
01:03:25,860 --> 01:03:31,380
There's also, I think there's the effort made to make Trixie who was sad in previous iterations

1757
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:38,860
to give her a happy arc as she stretches outside her comfort zone and tries everything.

1758
01:03:38,860 --> 01:03:39,860
Try everything.

1759
01:03:39,860 --> 01:03:44,300
The song that kind of opens Zootopia, the big like train ride that takes you through

1760
01:03:44,300 --> 01:03:48,620
all the different burrows and parts of Zootopia.

1761
01:03:48,620 --> 01:03:57,340
A song that I've I've ended up with a decently soft spot for due to my son liking the movie.

1762
01:03:57,780 --> 01:04:05,580
You know, I'm just in a place of I'm just glad he's not watching like evil YouTube garbage

1763
01:04:05,580 --> 01:04:10,980
made by A.I., like if we can get Zootopia on something like rendered nicely and with

1764
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:14,060
a song made by a musician, I'm happy.

1765
01:04:14,060 --> 01:04:17,460
Daddy, it's a well thought out world.

1766
01:04:17,460 --> 01:04:24,660
If you think about the metaphor too hard, it starts to fall apart.

1767
01:04:24,660 --> 01:04:29,220
The depth that it prides itself on doesn't actually function.

1768
01:04:29,220 --> 01:04:35,060
Yeah, I think that the I don't I don't mind the song and I think that the shifting it

1769
01:04:35,060 --> 01:04:38,700
to country is kind of clever.

1770
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:40,380
It's something you wouldn't think would work.

1771
01:04:40,380 --> 01:04:43,700
And I think it does lend itself decently.

1772
01:04:43,700 --> 01:04:48,100
It's not, you know, how about this to your point, Jason, about like it's songs that you

1773
01:04:48,100 --> 01:04:50,100
hear elsewhere in the park circuit here.

1774
01:04:50,340 --> 01:04:54,300
Yeah, try everything doesn't really exist in an American park anywhere.

1775
01:04:54,300 --> 01:04:55,100
You know what I mean?

1776
01:04:55,100 --> 01:04:57,180
Like, yeah, I don't think this is this.

1777
01:04:57,180 --> 01:04:58,340
I'm glad that it's not.

1778
01:04:58,340 --> 01:04:59,940
I mean, you get you've got a friend of me.

1779
01:04:59,940 --> 01:05:01,500
You get a whole new world.

1780
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:05,980
But this is like a little bit less of an exploited song done in a revamped way, as I don't mind

1781
01:05:05,980 --> 01:05:14,180
it. Yeah, it's a little more it's it's crazy to say Shakira song is that's who sings it,

1782
01:05:14,180 --> 01:05:17,380
right? Yeah, that that's more of the beaten path.

1783
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:23,740
But if I'm complimenting it, it does like start like high energy, like the top of the

1784
01:05:23,740 --> 01:05:25,700
show. So I think that works.

1785
01:05:25,740 --> 01:05:26,580
Yeah. Yeah.

1786
01:05:27,900 --> 01:05:30,580
I don't mind. I will say I don't mind this.

1787
01:05:30,580 --> 01:05:32,740
I don't mind the version in like a vacuum.

1788
01:05:32,740 --> 01:05:38,180
But it also I think because it's very like uptempo, modern country sounding right away.

1789
01:05:38,180 --> 01:05:42,620
I was like, wait, wait, no, wait, what this because I want everything to sound recorded

1790
01:05:42,620 --> 01:05:46,860
in a little tin can still on some level, which some of the other arrangements are a

1791
01:05:46,860 --> 01:05:52,540
little more like that and some like because like I want everyone's voice to sound

1792
01:05:52,540 --> 01:05:57,660
like this. And I want like I want everything to sound a little bit more like you're on

1793
01:05:57,660 --> 01:06:02,900
the porch. You can see the calculation in these bears are a good vehicle for modern

1794
01:06:02,900 --> 01:06:06,820
country music. But that's not anything we're interested in, I don't think.

1795
01:06:06,820 --> 01:06:09,500
Yeah. And I like modern country music to some degree.

1796
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:15,060
But it's like for that to be the first song out with with I'm just saying it set a bad

1797
01:06:15,060 --> 01:06:18,980
tone, even though I actually in a vacuum like this arrangement, I try everything.

1798
01:06:18,980 --> 01:06:20,860
Yeah. So I was like, oh, wait, what?

1799
01:06:20,860 --> 01:06:23,780
Oh, it's going to be because that was my fear.

1800
01:06:23,780 --> 01:06:26,860
It was like it was just going to sound like modern stuff.

1801
01:06:26,860 --> 01:06:30,180
Well, if it got more so from there, that would be the concern.

1802
01:06:30,180 --> 01:06:33,300
Yeah, it did it. It did more tin can music.

1803
01:06:33,300 --> 01:06:38,460
Yes. Yeah. They immediately were like hitting you with we don't talk about Bruno.

1804
01:06:38,460 --> 01:06:40,940
That would have been like, oh, here we go. Sure.

1805
01:06:40,980 --> 01:06:46,980
And later in the show, you get not let it go from Frozen.

1806
01:06:46,980 --> 01:06:49,660
But that's true. Frozen song, Fixer Upper.

1807
01:06:49,660 --> 01:06:51,980
I forgot that that was a Frozen song.

1808
01:06:51,980 --> 01:06:58,740
Frozen is one that hasn't made it to my child's viewing habits.

1809
01:06:58,740 --> 01:07:03,340
Yeah. And I've never seen the whole movie and I don't know this song, Fixer Upper.

1810
01:07:03,340 --> 01:07:08,380
I've seen the movie and I know most of the songs, but I was like, what is Fixer Upper?

1811
01:07:08,380 --> 01:07:10,300
The little trolls singing.

1812
01:07:10,300 --> 01:07:12,780
Is that right? Oh. The little ghoulies.

1813
01:07:12,780 --> 01:07:15,340
OK. They're a little scared.

1814
01:07:15,340 --> 01:07:18,540
The Frozen ghoulies. Yes, of course.

1815
01:07:18,540 --> 01:07:19,940
Yeah, I don't know. It's a fine song.

1816
01:07:19,940 --> 01:07:22,580
But I like that it's not let it go.

1817
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:23,940
I like that we are. I agree.

1818
01:07:23,940 --> 01:07:27,340
You know, we got some obvious, but some, you know.

1819
01:07:27,340 --> 01:07:30,060
And Max sings on Fixer Upper because he is Shaker.

1820
01:07:30,060 --> 01:07:32,020
He's Shaker. Max plays Shaker.

1821
01:07:32,020 --> 01:07:34,060
Shaker, who is also who is Terrence.

1822
01:07:34,060 --> 01:07:37,220
Terrence is Shaker. Yes. Terrence is Shaker.

1823
01:07:37,220 --> 01:07:41,740
I think it's just like the that's his real name and Shaker is a nickname.

1824
01:07:41,740 --> 01:07:47,180
Well, right. Guitar strap that says Shaker is in the lobby display cases.

1825
01:07:47,180 --> 01:07:51,740
OK. And he's someone else to who is Mac. Mac.

1826
01:07:51,740 --> 01:07:53,820
Oh, yeah. I don't know. Is he one of the Bear Rugs?

1827
01:07:53,820 --> 01:07:56,100
He might be one of the Bear Rugs. Yeah, I think so.

1828
01:07:56,100 --> 01:07:57,900
Yeah. And he arranged it all.

1829
01:07:57,900 --> 01:07:59,620
Maybe we didn't say that in terms of his involvement.

1830
01:07:59,620 --> 01:08:02,620
He doesn't just say, but he arranged all of it, a lot of it.

1831
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:04,900
It seems like a lot of it or all of it.

1832
01:08:04,900 --> 01:08:10,500
It does sound all like copacetic. Yeah, like it all makes sense,

1833
01:08:11,020 --> 01:08:15,220
which is a plus and a minus, because like

1834
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:21,540
part of the weirdness was the variety of tones of the songs in the old one.

1835
01:08:21,540 --> 01:08:25,620
Yeah. And didn't the original Big Al saw that was just that was a recording of

1836
01:08:25,820 --> 01:08:27,820
that wasn't even something they made. Right.

1837
01:08:27,820 --> 01:08:31,340
Blood on the Tex Ritter, Tex Ritter. Yeah. Yeah.

1838
01:08:31,860 --> 01:08:35,580
The country bear, the vacation show and stuff like those,

1839
01:08:36,300 --> 01:08:39,860
those are more modern sounding recordings and they were more varied

1840
01:08:39,860 --> 01:08:43,300
in its like genre. But yeah, the original version. Yeah. Yeah.

1841
01:08:44,380 --> 01:08:46,500
And we don't have to go in order necessarily,

1842
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:49,260
but just like strong feelings about any.

1843
01:08:49,420 --> 01:08:54,180
Well, as I said, the supercalifragilisticexpialidocious part, I like a lot.

1844
01:08:54,220 --> 01:08:55,540
Yeah. There's no singing on it.

1845
01:08:55,540 --> 01:08:57,980
It's just a fiddle. It's just earnest playing the fiddle.

1846
01:08:57,980 --> 01:09:00,460
You feel like they would have done that before.

1847
01:09:00,460 --> 01:09:04,020
And by the way, the original show had the Davy Crockett song.

1848
01:09:04,020 --> 01:09:06,660
It's not like they there wasn't stuff like this.

1849
01:09:08,300 --> 01:09:10,980
You know, I think the guy that that imaginary

1850
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:13,740
even even pointed out the original plans were to have like

1851
01:09:14,060 --> 01:09:17,380
hi-ho and other Disney songs.

1852
01:09:17,380 --> 01:09:19,820
Yeah. And that happened like Tiki Room when you're leaving.

1853
01:09:19,820 --> 01:09:22,780
They're playing like a hi-ho. No. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1854
01:09:23,420 --> 01:09:26,300
The fiddle is also teased in the lobby.

1855
01:09:26,300 --> 01:09:30,060
There's a burned out fiddle in the display case. Oh, OK.

1856
01:09:30,300 --> 01:09:32,740
This is something he does all the time. I like that.

1857
01:09:33,180 --> 01:09:34,900
I like the whole new world.

1858
01:09:34,900 --> 01:09:41,020
And that is singer, songwriter and mandolin player Chris Thiele. Yes.

1859
01:09:41,020 --> 01:09:45,020
The man who replaced Garrison Keillor on a Prairie Own Companion.

1860
01:09:45,020 --> 01:09:49,180
And that's why Jason knows who it is, which was cancer.

1861
01:09:49,180 --> 01:09:51,820
Because he got the only job in show business Jason wants.

1862
01:09:51,860 --> 01:09:58,420
I yes, I applied two or three times to write on that show.

1863
01:09:58,660 --> 01:09:59,860
Prairie Own Companion.

1864
01:09:59,860 --> 01:10:02,820
And then they changed the name at some point.

1865
01:10:02,860 --> 01:10:05,940
And then it was canceled. OK. OK. Soon after that.

1866
01:10:05,940 --> 01:10:10,580
But like Mark Wahlberg talking about Blaine's on that fateful day.

1867
01:10:10,580 --> 01:10:11,780
Oh, you could have saved it.

1868
01:10:11,780 --> 01:10:14,380
It wouldn't have gone down that way if I had been there.

1869
01:10:14,780 --> 01:10:15,700
This is fascinating.

1870
01:10:15,700 --> 01:10:19,140
Have we said this on the show that you replied to write for Prairie Own Companion?

1871
01:10:19,140 --> 01:10:21,460
I wrote sketches.

1872
01:10:21,460 --> 01:10:26,260
They were just looking for like sample like radio sketch samples.

1873
01:10:26,300 --> 01:10:30,020
Yes. OK. So we need five long winded stories.

1874
01:10:31,020 --> 01:10:33,900
We need like three folksy anecdotes. Right.

1875
01:10:34,340 --> 01:10:38,940
If you have anything about pond deals or Sandy's, that'd be helpful.

1876
01:10:38,940 --> 01:10:40,660
We've been looking for Sandy's material.

1877
01:10:40,660 --> 01:10:42,900
I oh man, did I?

1878
01:10:43,420 --> 01:10:46,500
I might have put pond deals in on this.

1879
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:47,420
You got to find that packet.

1880
01:10:47,420 --> 01:10:49,660
I wrote a lot of fake commercials.

1881
01:10:49,660 --> 01:10:51,460
I got to go through an old job box.

1882
01:10:51,460 --> 01:10:53,740
I also think you should just do like do your own Prairie Own Companion

1883
01:10:53,740 --> 01:10:55,500
and call it Prairie Own Companion.

1884
01:10:55,500 --> 01:10:57,780
Just like blatantly podcast.

1885
01:10:57,780 --> 01:10:58,820
Own Companion.

1886
01:10:58,820 --> 01:11:00,060
Yeah. Steal the whole premise.

1887
01:11:00,060 --> 01:11:01,900
Sure. Yeah, yeah.

1888
01:11:01,900 --> 01:11:04,740
But you could just update, you know, you could just take a format.

1889
01:11:04,740 --> 01:11:06,820
No updating. No update.

1890
01:11:06,820 --> 01:11:09,060
No, but I'm saying just do it.

1891
01:11:09,060 --> 01:11:14,060
But as a podcast now and then it'll be unrecognizable in our little

1892
01:11:14,060 --> 01:11:17,900
right scene of podcasts because nobody listens to that.

1893
01:11:18,260 --> 01:11:19,860
I think what you're saying makes a lot of sense.

1894
01:11:19,860 --> 01:11:22,340
And I think what I was pitching at the time, at least, was

1895
01:11:23,300 --> 01:11:27,420
inviting a lawsuit by doing the exact same show that Garrison

1896
01:11:27,420 --> 01:11:30,420
Keillor had been doing. Only Jason was hosting it.

1897
01:11:32,300 --> 01:11:33,940
So, yeah, what you're saying is correct.

1898
01:11:33,940 --> 01:11:35,980
But what's what's he going to do?

1899
01:11:35,980 --> 01:11:38,460
Yeah, he's on the ropes. Yeah.

1900
01:11:39,100 --> 01:11:42,260
He didn't die, did he? No, he's still alive.

1901
01:11:42,260 --> 01:11:43,340
But I did like this.

1902
01:11:43,340 --> 01:11:47,460
No, he kind of sings like in a very particular way that seems.

1903
01:11:47,460 --> 01:11:49,700
Yeah, he still sings it like a character.

1904
01:11:49,700 --> 01:11:51,420
You know what? That's what I like.

1905
01:11:51,420 --> 01:11:55,980
And they recorded his mandolin play is very talented instrumentally.

1906
01:11:55,980 --> 01:11:56,940
Yeah, this is him.

1907
01:11:56,940 --> 01:11:59,140
This is like musician and voice.

1908
01:11:59,140 --> 01:12:02,300
And he didn't even though he is somebody who does more like modern

1909
01:12:02,700 --> 01:12:04,060
country music a little bit.

1910
01:12:04,060 --> 01:12:07,220
He still did it in like a garsh kind of voice.

1911
01:12:07,620 --> 01:12:09,020
I've seen him in the Largo a bunch of times.

1912
01:12:09,020 --> 01:12:10,660
He'd pop into those John Bryant sets.

1913
01:12:10,660 --> 01:12:13,740
He's fantastic on the Nickle Creek.

1914
01:12:13,740 --> 01:12:15,460
He was in Punch Brothers.

1915
01:12:15,460 --> 01:12:18,340
And, you know, I'm no expert in a lot of that.

1916
01:12:18,340 --> 01:12:20,100
But, yeah, look up.

1917
01:12:20,100 --> 01:12:22,700
So there's a song I was happy with you.

1918
01:12:22,700 --> 01:12:24,380
The John Bryant song.

1919
01:12:24,380 --> 01:12:27,540
You know, we Mike and I both seen John Bryant a lot.

1920
01:12:27,900 --> 01:12:31,380
The film composer at Largo is an incredible songwriter.

1921
01:12:31,380 --> 01:12:34,700
Also, and he did all of these songs and all of these shows

1922
01:12:34,700 --> 01:12:36,980
that never came out in any form.

1923
01:12:36,980 --> 01:12:40,060
And some of them, I think, are like some of the best songs I've ever heard.

1924
01:12:40,380 --> 01:12:44,260
And there's one of him and Chris Thiele doing I was happy with you.

1925
01:12:44,260 --> 01:12:45,180
And it's great.

1926
01:12:45,180 --> 01:12:48,180
So if you want more of this, which character does he do?

1927
01:12:48,180 --> 01:12:49,500
He's Wendell.

1928
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:52,060
If you want to see Wendell in real life,

1929
01:12:52,860 --> 01:12:55,180
doing a non Disney song, that's very good.

1930
01:12:55,580 --> 01:12:58,100
Yeah. And this is kind of a showstopper

1931
01:12:59,340 --> 01:13:00,940
set wise. Great.

1932
01:13:00,940 --> 01:13:05,660
And I think a fun use of the swing of Swing and Teddy

1933
01:13:05,660 --> 01:13:11,580
Barra's swing and the contextualizing it with flying.

1934
01:13:11,580 --> 01:13:15,100
And, you know, when you get a little like smoke machine situation,

1935
01:13:15,100 --> 01:13:16,540
I think this is a good for it.

1936
01:13:16,540 --> 01:13:21,180
For it being here's the country bears doing a song that's extremely overexposed.

1937
01:13:21,220 --> 01:13:24,340
Yeah. I think it's a pretty successful little number.

1938
01:13:24,660 --> 01:13:27,180
Yeah. Yes. I I.

1939
01:13:29,100 --> 01:13:33,140
I don't think the lines after like the come up.

1940
01:13:33,460 --> 01:13:35,820
She does say come up and see me sometime.

1941
01:13:36,380 --> 01:13:40,820
But then the jokes aren't as good as like when I find a ladder, I'll be right up.

1942
01:13:40,820 --> 01:13:42,020
I think it's great joke.

1943
01:13:42,020 --> 01:13:44,580
But the head say one of the head says,

1944
01:13:45,340 --> 01:13:48,580
I'm scared of heights, and there says, I'm scared of swings.

1945
01:13:49,020 --> 01:13:52,580
I'm like, there are a couple lines that I'm not so like.

1946
01:13:52,580 --> 01:13:56,500
Yeah. And by the way, we're watching videos of D23 preview.

1947
01:13:56,500 --> 01:13:59,420
Yeah. Where it's killing, where some of it's killing.

1948
01:13:59,420 --> 01:14:03,780
So, you know, if the jokes aren't landing there, we're in rough shape.

1949
01:14:03,820 --> 01:14:05,700
Yeah. Yeah.

1950
01:14:05,700 --> 01:14:09,140
But also, Jason, I feel like you're analyzing a come up and see me sometime

1951
01:14:09,140 --> 01:14:12,700
also. Well, that's one of the great references of all time.

1952
01:14:12,700 --> 01:14:18,540
Yes. Well, similarly, I think the joke of being a couple of the big

1953
01:14:18,540 --> 01:14:22,220
out moments don't quite work for me.

1954
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:24,300
I think I think I am a fan.

1955
01:14:24,300 --> 01:14:27,260
I'm surprised how much I'm realizing that I that I like it.

1956
01:14:27,460 --> 01:14:33,260
I think, OK, it kills with this audience who is probably a lot of anticipation.

1957
01:14:33,260 --> 01:14:36,660
And it's not going to work like this everywhere where people are not in every

1958
01:14:37,180 --> 01:14:41,140
showing, where people are not like coming in as big fans of Big Al.

1959
01:14:41,380 --> 01:14:43,500
However, shows and going for a little bit.

1960
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:47,260
Who's the who's the main character we're excited for who we haven't seen?

1961
01:14:47,500 --> 01:14:51,060
And then you hear pretty reminiscent of the old version.

1962
01:14:51,060 --> 01:14:55,620
Yeah. Out of key, Duong, and huge response to that.

1963
01:14:55,620 --> 01:15:00,100
Like he's here. It's like the Jaws music, like preceding the character.

1964
01:15:00,260 --> 01:15:04,660
All right. And then and then a lot of anticipation of what the song going to be.

1965
01:15:04,940 --> 01:15:09,980
And then it's Remember Me, one of the saddest songs in the Disney or Pixar

1966
01:15:09,980 --> 01:15:13,940
canon, and it is funny.

1967
01:15:13,980 --> 01:15:18,740
Maybe it requires like you're saying, Mike, maybe it requires the context of,

1968
01:15:19,660 --> 01:15:23,860
oh, I know this is a very sad character and that he's singing the very sad song.

1969
01:15:23,860 --> 01:15:26,420
It might be getting a laugh that's like

1970
01:15:26,420 --> 01:15:30,220
the weird laugh, you know, that requires context.

1971
01:15:30,460 --> 01:15:32,660
But I have the context that I liked it.

1972
01:15:33,380 --> 01:15:34,940
I think that works.

1973
01:15:34,940 --> 01:15:37,380
I think Al is more of a professional.

1974
01:15:37,380 --> 01:15:38,780
Like, I don't think it.

1975
01:15:38,780 --> 01:15:41,460
I don't think you should be breaking down crying.

1976
01:15:41,460 --> 01:15:43,460
Like, I get it's a sad song.

1977
01:15:43,460 --> 01:15:44,900
I think that it's Remember Me.

1978
01:15:44,900 --> 01:15:48,300
The part that doesn't work for me when is when he comes back

1979
01:15:48,580 --> 01:15:49,940
and he starts doing it again.

1980
01:15:49,940 --> 01:15:52,700
They try to do that bit from the old show.

1981
01:15:53,140 --> 01:15:56,420
He does it after the number is done.

1982
01:15:56,820 --> 01:15:59,060
He does it when the curtain of some bonnet

1983
01:15:59,060 --> 01:16:01,340
tree is lowering, the curtains closing.

1984
01:16:01,660 --> 01:16:03,620
And it's really not that big of an issue.

1985
01:16:03,620 --> 01:16:05,260
Like Henry comments on it.

1986
01:16:05,260 --> 01:16:08,500
But it's like, oh, he should have done that in the middle of this.

1987
01:16:08,940 --> 01:16:09,940
Well, but that's not the bit.

1988
01:16:09,940 --> 01:16:13,500
So the bit of the old show, one of the bits of the old show was

1989
01:16:13,820 --> 01:16:16,940
that the show was like going off the rails a little bit.

1990
01:16:17,420 --> 01:16:21,420
Or that Henry would be embarrassed because this is like the mama

1991
01:16:21,420 --> 01:16:23,620
don't whoop little Buford.

1992
01:16:23,620 --> 01:16:25,180
So he's like, well, we only have high class stuff.

1993
01:16:25,180 --> 01:16:26,500
And he's like nervous or whatever.

1994
01:16:26,500 --> 01:16:29,140
And then Big Al comes out with this song that's like blood,

1995
01:16:29,140 --> 01:16:31,420
like a really like violent song.

1996
01:16:31,420 --> 01:16:33,260
And they're like, they want that off stage.

1997
01:16:33,260 --> 01:16:36,540
So now and then he comes back later to try to interrupt the show.

1998
01:16:36,540 --> 01:16:38,220
But now it's just that Big Al is sad.

1999
01:16:38,220 --> 01:16:41,500
And the show has actually gone pretty well up until that point.

2000
01:16:41,980 --> 01:16:47,300
So it is a little different being a bummer, just bumming us out with the song.

2001
01:16:47,500 --> 01:16:49,700
Right. So he and he's too sad to even sing it.

2002
01:16:49,700 --> 01:16:53,260
So before Big Al was more like kind of this like goofy big bear

2003
01:16:53,260 --> 01:16:55,220
who's a little clueless to what he's singing.

2004
01:16:55,420 --> 01:16:57,100
And now it's that Big Al is depressed.

2005
01:16:57,100 --> 01:17:00,420
So they've actually given Big Al a different sort of character game

2006
01:17:00,740 --> 01:17:01,940
in this version.

2007
01:17:01,940 --> 01:17:03,100
That's a good point.

2008
01:17:03,100 --> 01:17:05,420
Big Al, though, is funny.

2009
01:17:05,420 --> 01:17:07,500
We were watching this last night.

2010
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:09,740
My daughter didn't seem to care about some of it.

2011
01:17:09,780 --> 01:17:10,740
Again, this is video.

2012
01:17:10,740 --> 01:17:13,100
So she's, you know, playing with toys.

2013
01:17:13,300 --> 01:17:15,340
She saw Big Al. She goes, Big Bear.

2014
01:17:15,900 --> 01:17:17,020
OK. Big.

2015
01:17:17,020 --> 01:17:21,420
She kept saying Big Bear, Big Bear, like pointing at him, running up to the TV.

2016
01:17:21,420 --> 01:17:24,780
Big Bear. I go, well, that's that's the

2017
01:17:25,220 --> 01:17:27,460
design of Big Al is so funny.

2018
01:17:27,460 --> 01:17:28,780
They retained that.

2019
01:17:28,780 --> 01:17:30,340
Yes. You got that.

2020
01:17:30,340 --> 01:17:31,380
When does that matter?

2021
01:17:31,380 --> 01:17:36,340
Like, you know, does it matter that he's no longer doing blood in the saddle?

2022
01:17:36,380 --> 01:17:41,100
Well, once you hear that any gripe that I have, ultimately,

2023
01:17:41,340 --> 01:17:46,020
if kids love it and people like this version and maybe it's more filled up,

2024
01:17:46,020 --> 01:17:46,980
then I'm wrong.

2025
01:17:46,980 --> 01:17:49,980
Like I can I'm I might be wrong.

2026
01:17:50,340 --> 01:17:53,860
I'm more of like I will I will say that

2027
01:17:54,820 --> 01:17:58,820
my tastes are not the tastes of the average theme park goer.

2028
01:17:58,940 --> 01:18:03,580
Yeah. So I'm not happy to be wrong, but I'm accepting of being wrong.

2029
01:18:03,580 --> 01:18:08,540
If kids like this version better, which they probably do, they probably

2030
01:18:08,780 --> 01:18:12,020
I don't think the old version I think kids would like the old version

2031
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:14,340
because they would see the funny robots in the songs.

2032
01:18:14,340 --> 01:18:15,580
You can clap along.

2033
01:18:15,580 --> 01:18:19,100
But now that they know the songs, is it going to be more fun for them?

2034
01:18:19,100 --> 01:18:22,300
Probably. And I'll say there's there's thought.

2035
01:18:22,300 --> 01:18:28,100
But it like I like Henry and the Raccoon, whose name I'm just blanking on.

2036
01:18:28,100 --> 01:18:30,260
I had to flip it up. Sammy. Sammy.

2037
01:18:30,420 --> 01:18:32,580
I like that they do. You've got a friend of me.

2038
01:18:32,580 --> 01:18:36,660
That's cute. And I like that the big closing number is bare necessity.

2039
01:18:36,660 --> 01:18:38,620
It's like, oh, that's the obvious.

2040
01:18:38,620 --> 01:18:43,300
I feel like Bear Bear, you know, that's the maybe the obvious song,

2041
01:18:43,300 --> 01:18:45,060
but they save it to the end. Yeah.

2042
01:18:45,060 --> 01:18:46,740
It's fun to see everyone sing it.

2043
01:18:46,740 --> 01:18:50,940
And then they do come again, which is which is the original,

2044
01:18:50,940 --> 01:18:54,540
original and from other versions of the show. Right.

2045
01:18:54,540 --> 01:18:57,580
And I like that. I like that they have a song when you're going out.

2046
01:18:58,260 --> 01:19:01,020
I feel like as we sit with it, because I think like, yeah,

2047
01:19:01,020 --> 01:19:02,620
we kind of hadn't gotten into it.

2048
01:19:02,620 --> 01:19:06,380
And the other night we were all like, we all had kind of a bug up our butt about it.

2049
01:19:06,660 --> 01:19:10,500
When you actually sit with it and watch it, you're like, what did we lose here?

2050
01:19:10,740 --> 01:19:15,020
And are we and I didn't want to be in the I was also starting to go like, OK,

2051
01:19:15,020 --> 01:19:16,860
what are these old things that we liked?

2052
01:19:16,860 --> 01:19:19,980
I did like all the guys that turned me on turned me down.

2053
01:19:20,140 --> 01:19:22,060
And they got big laughs out of that.

2054
01:19:22,060 --> 01:19:23,940
And those laughs are gone now.

2055
01:19:23,940 --> 01:19:27,140
I mean, people are laughing just that it's weird that it's there.

2056
01:19:27,340 --> 01:19:28,820
But then I'm like, what else went away?

2057
01:19:28,820 --> 01:19:32,300
And like, oh, yeah, mama, don't whip little Beaufort.

2058
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:37,500
Like, I think we'd be on the wrong side of history to be saying they took away.

2059
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:40,460
Well, right. I don't want to be those cranks going.

2060
01:19:40,900 --> 01:19:43,500
They took the song of that whooping away.

2061
01:19:44,260 --> 01:19:49,060
Well, as I said, even taking away the the guy that turned me on,

2062
01:19:49,060 --> 01:19:51,660
so I'm not saying that's wrong to take away.

2063
01:19:51,820 --> 01:19:54,100
It should have been a place by something equal.

2064
01:19:54,220 --> 01:19:57,660
If it needs to be softer in its weirdness, I understand that.

2065
01:19:57,740 --> 01:20:02,340
Yes, I think they OK, if we're good, if we had to note anything here,

2066
01:20:02,340 --> 01:20:06,900
I think it's that the Sunbonnet trio needs to sing a weird song still.

2067
01:20:07,260 --> 01:20:11,660
There's got to be something that would can raise the stock in my mind a lot.

2068
01:20:11,660 --> 01:20:18,020
Yes. But I think, yeah, like just stuff like the smoking fiddle

2069
01:20:18,020 --> 01:20:21,540
and things where I was like, I'm looking for a few more little joke things

2070
01:20:21,540 --> 01:20:24,740
in the actual show or it doesn't have to be weird.

2071
01:20:24,740 --> 01:20:28,180
It just has to be like little joke things versus sort of just going.

2072
01:20:28,180 --> 01:20:32,140
Isn't funny is I think as you say that, I think that's something that's missing.

2073
01:20:32,180 --> 01:20:34,940
Yeah, I think it's a little the show goes a little too cleanly.

2074
01:20:35,100 --> 01:20:36,500
Yes. This is like the Muppet show.

2075
01:20:36,500 --> 01:20:39,300
It's supposed to have a little disasters in it.

2076
01:20:39,660 --> 01:20:43,540
Also, I wonder, was rewriting lyrics on the table

2077
01:20:44,300 --> 01:20:47,500
because I think you could have gotten a lot in there that would have been fun

2078
01:20:47,740 --> 01:20:49,660
if you could have played with the lyrics a little bit.

2079
01:20:49,660 --> 01:20:53,140
Sure. And that like that that seems more interesting.

2080
01:20:53,140 --> 01:20:56,860
If I was writing the show, be like, could I like rewrite Gaston

2081
01:20:56,860 --> 01:20:59,700
or something with one of the characters?

2082
01:20:59,700 --> 01:21:02,340
Oh, yeah. And the same melody and some of the same lyrics.

2083
01:21:02,340 --> 01:21:05,180
But it's about Romeo McGraw or whatever.

2084
01:21:06,180 --> 01:21:09,940
There are other stuff in like the vacation show.

2085
01:21:10,860 --> 01:21:12,900
What's the number with the octopus in it?

2086
01:21:12,900 --> 01:21:16,180
There's stuff like that, even that I feel like could have been to.

2087
01:21:16,180 --> 01:21:20,060
Yes. Which is like one of the bears is singing a love song to an octopus.

2088
01:21:20,620 --> 01:21:23,940
And it's like, yeah, that that was such a little funny, simple thing

2089
01:21:23,940 --> 01:21:28,180
you could have done with like one of the Disney songs playing.

2090
01:21:28,180 --> 01:21:31,100
And now you've given it a context of like he's having this

2091
01:21:31,100 --> 01:21:34,100
like love affair with an octopus or something silly.

2092
01:21:34,220 --> 01:21:36,580
I just you know, I needed to conjure some.

2093
01:21:37,380 --> 01:21:41,060
I didn't have these ideas at the ready, and I just googled the phrase

2094
01:21:41,060 --> 01:21:43,500
the horniest Disney songs. Yeah.

2095
01:21:43,500 --> 01:21:47,260
And, you know, I think we got a great option here at number two.

2096
01:21:47,260 --> 01:21:49,980
Well, number one, just if you're curious, they put Gaston.

2097
01:21:50,620 --> 01:21:52,860
Oh, sure. You were right there.

2098
01:21:52,860 --> 01:21:56,060
Number two, Hellfire from Hunchback of Notre Dame.

2099
01:21:56,100 --> 01:21:59,260
That is the song of longing for Esmeralda.

2100
01:21:59,300 --> 01:22:01,220
Yeah, yeah. Hunchback.

2101
01:22:01,220 --> 01:22:03,940
I mean, we had Jane on and talked about that live show.

2102
01:22:03,940 --> 01:22:07,540
But rewatching that movie, I was like, I didn't remember this at all.

2103
01:22:07,580 --> 01:22:13,500
Like, it is a great movie, and it is so dark and strange.

2104
01:22:14,100 --> 01:22:18,340
And like to have the goofy gargoyles in the same movie.

2105
01:22:18,500 --> 01:22:20,260
Hey, don't get them, pal.

2106
01:22:20,260 --> 01:22:24,100
The the priest. I will burn her.

2107
01:22:25,460 --> 01:22:27,060
That was hilarious. He's going to burn.

2108
01:22:27,060 --> 01:22:30,620
But yeah, you know, there's got to be there's got to be a version of Hellfire

2109
01:22:30,620 --> 01:22:32,540
with some bonnet trio, right?

2110
01:22:32,540 --> 01:22:37,420
There is a bear who is so off limits to them that is so or different.

2111
01:22:37,420 --> 01:22:41,580
Maybe it's a member of a different species or it's a hunky skunk.

2112
01:22:42,260 --> 01:22:47,020
Henry, who has control over, you know, the the the back story

2113
01:22:47,020 --> 01:22:49,980
is that Henry like yay or nays who everybody dates.

2114
01:22:50,300 --> 01:22:52,620
He is kind of controlling and not a good way.

2115
01:22:52,780 --> 01:22:55,340
Maybe he's kind of the garrison keeler of the

2116
01:22:56,220 --> 01:22:58,180
he runs kind of a toxic ship.

2117
01:22:58,180 --> 01:22:58,860
Sure. Yeah.

2118
01:22:58,860 --> 01:23:02,020
Maybe like Teddy Bar has moved on from Henry, though,

2119
01:23:02,620 --> 01:23:07,260
although she's singing a duet and then the heads on the wall are commenting.

2120
01:23:07,580 --> 01:23:09,540
Yeah, it's not the connection there, really.

2121
01:23:09,540 --> 01:23:13,860
I guess, you know, it's just doesn't want to settle down, you know,

2122
01:23:13,860 --> 01:23:15,500
and that's that's not for people.

2123
01:23:15,500 --> 01:23:17,700
Some people want to play the field.

2124
01:23:17,700 --> 01:23:20,900
What? Maybe she's doing a Fleetwood Mac kind of thing.

2125
01:23:20,900 --> 01:23:23,140
You know, it's all crazy.

2126
01:23:23,140 --> 01:23:25,460
And it just feeds into the music.

2127
01:23:25,460 --> 01:23:27,940
Oh, well, that's then I want to then I want darker songs.

2128
01:23:27,940 --> 01:23:32,260
We need heavier songs to do as as Henry and Trixie stare at each other

2129
01:23:32,540 --> 01:23:35,060
or trig waiter or to Teddy Barra, I guess.

2130
01:23:35,220 --> 01:23:36,540
Oh, right. Yeah.

2131
01:23:36,540 --> 01:23:40,260
Like all of that tension, a la Stevie and Lindsay has to be clear.

2132
01:23:40,700 --> 01:23:44,140
Yeah. Here's one that they've used.

2133
01:23:44,180 --> 01:23:45,900
They used it in harmonious.

2134
01:23:45,900 --> 01:23:47,900
And then we will just be yelled.

2135
01:23:47,900 --> 01:23:49,220
This is so specific.

2136
01:23:49,220 --> 01:23:53,580
The Bastille Day fireworks, Disneyland, Paris.

2137
01:23:53,860 --> 01:23:55,380
So they go all out for that.

2138
01:23:55,380 --> 01:23:57,780
They're shooting off so many fire.

2139
01:23:57,780 --> 01:24:02,020
It is like even more than Fourth of July here in America.

2140
01:24:02,180 --> 01:24:04,740
But they use a bunch of hunchback stuff.

2141
01:24:04,740 --> 01:24:09,340
And I feel like they use out there pretty well in both those shows.

2142
01:24:09,580 --> 01:24:12,540
OK, so I that could be one.

2143
01:24:12,540 --> 01:24:16,860
I feel like that'd be fun to have, you know, someone saying

2144
01:24:16,860 --> 01:24:22,020
Teddy Barra on the swing or the Sunbonnet Trio, like pining for something out there.

2145
01:24:22,020 --> 01:24:27,660
Well, I I think that the I think that if Henry is specific, has outlawed

2146
01:24:27,860 --> 01:24:32,540
that the my bears are not allowed to date big, hunky skunks.

2147
01:24:32,700 --> 01:24:34,340
Yeah. And that is what.

2148
01:24:34,340 --> 01:24:37,340
And it is it is the Sunbonnets pining for.

2149
01:24:37,500 --> 01:24:43,900
Yeah. The sexiest skunk who is already sort of like priest habit in color.

2150
01:24:43,900 --> 01:24:46,140
You just you flip it. He's the man of faith.

2151
01:24:46,420 --> 01:24:48,380
We do take it the other way.

2152
01:24:48,380 --> 01:24:51,420
But then they're all singing about how they're going to burn

2153
01:24:52,900 --> 01:24:55,220
and then a skunk's face in flame.

2154
01:24:56,580 --> 01:24:57,500
It's a great question.

2155
01:24:57,500 --> 01:25:00,420
Who do we think of the bears as the most religious?

2156
01:25:01,420 --> 01:25:02,340
Hmm.

2157
01:25:02,340 --> 01:25:03,860
A very good question.

2158
01:25:03,860 --> 01:25:05,620
Do we think it's Wendell?

2159
01:25:05,620 --> 01:25:07,740
We're the fiddle player.

2160
01:25:07,740 --> 01:25:11,100
He channels God's power to smoke that fiddle.

2161
01:25:11,460 --> 01:25:14,420
Big Al kind of carries the most weight with him.

2162
01:25:14,420 --> 01:25:17,700
I know. I feel like I met a lot of like sad Catholics

2163
01:25:17,700 --> 01:25:20,500
and much who carry the guilt and carry the weight of the world.

2164
01:25:20,500 --> 01:25:22,980
And maybe that's the context of Big Al.

2165
01:25:22,980 --> 01:25:27,260
He doesn't allow himself joy due to all of the self-imposed rules.

2166
01:25:27,500 --> 01:25:28,740
Mm hmm.

2167
01:25:28,740 --> 01:25:30,980
That might be my guess, but I don't know.

2168
01:25:30,980 --> 01:25:33,380
It's up. That's another sound off in the comments.

2169
01:25:33,860 --> 01:25:35,340
Say hello to the comments.

2170
01:25:35,340 --> 01:25:38,620
Who do you think is the most faithful of all these bears?

2171
01:25:38,620 --> 01:25:40,580
And who do you think is an atheist?

2172
01:25:40,580 --> 01:25:44,180
I like to be prepared as number seven on this horny list of Disney songs.

2173
01:25:44,820 --> 01:25:47,900
Yeah, be prepared. Why? I don't know.

2174
01:25:47,900 --> 01:25:49,060
He's horny for power.

2175
01:25:49,060 --> 01:25:50,180
I think they were just running.

2176
01:25:50,180 --> 01:25:51,020
They couldn't do 10.

2177
01:25:51,020 --> 01:25:53,500
They couldn't find 10 that you could really classify as horny.

2178
01:25:53,500 --> 01:25:55,060
Yeah, yeah. You found the same article.

2179
01:25:55,060 --> 01:25:57,180
Can you feel the love tonight's also there?

2180
01:25:58,260 --> 01:26:00,220
Oh, that would have been great.

2181
01:26:00,220 --> 01:26:02,580
That's pretty clean. Yeah, that would have been. Yeah.

2182
01:26:02,940 --> 01:26:06,220
That is how they just they it's you know, it also doesn't have to be.

2183
01:26:06,220 --> 01:26:07,300
So we don't have to get it.

2184
01:26:07,300 --> 01:26:09,100
We don't have to say weird phrases.

2185
01:26:09,100 --> 01:26:12,140
We don't even have to like imply anything too odd.

2186
01:26:12,140 --> 01:26:15,860
You just I like the idea of all of them being like Miss Piggies

2187
01:26:16,100 --> 01:26:21,460
sort of like shoving a more diminutive character into their grip.

2188
01:26:21,660 --> 01:26:23,620
Yeah, a la Kermit. Sure.

2189
01:26:23,620 --> 01:26:26,300
Just like if the slideshow shows you

2190
01:26:26,740 --> 01:26:31,820
that each son bonnet has a different kind of like nervous boyfriend.

2191
01:26:31,860 --> 01:26:34,180
Yeah. And they are much more aggressive.

2192
01:26:34,180 --> 01:26:36,980
That's funny. I think that I think we're having fun with that. Uh huh.

2193
01:26:37,060 --> 01:26:41,140
How about sooner or later, you're going to be mine from Dick Tracy.

2194
01:26:41,380 --> 01:26:45,060
Oh, great. This song that Madonna sing.

2195
01:26:45,060 --> 01:26:47,580
I mean, if they did this, we'd be giving it a bad name.

2196
01:26:48,460 --> 01:26:50,300
The rest of the show could be worse and be like, well,

2197
01:26:50,300 --> 01:26:53,260
at least the fucking Dick Tracy songs in here, that's wild.

2198
01:26:53,900 --> 01:26:56,380
Yeah. Like I like Disney.

2199
01:26:56,380 --> 01:27:00,180
Just didn't he just buy Queens cattle like fully by Queens?

2200
01:27:00,180 --> 01:27:01,260
I thought it was the other way.

2201
01:27:01,260 --> 01:27:03,820
I thought it was that they I was thinking about this.

2202
01:27:03,820 --> 01:27:06,220
I think they maybe let Sony.

2203
01:27:06,220 --> 01:27:07,940
Oh, Sony got it. I think maybe.

2204
01:27:07,940 --> 01:27:09,900
Oh, they gave it away to Sony. OK.

2205
01:27:09,900 --> 01:27:11,500
This is a major deal.

2206
01:27:11,500 --> 01:27:14,860
Yeah, this is a that's what it was billion dollar deal more. Wow.

2207
01:27:15,620 --> 01:27:19,380
But yeah, any any songs like pop, regular rock or pop songs

2208
01:27:19,380 --> 01:27:21,140
that they could have thrown in here, too?

2209
01:27:21,140 --> 01:27:22,780
What's the horniest Queen song?

2210
01:27:22,780 --> 01:27:24,980
Oh, my goodness. Fat bottom bears.

2211
01:27:27,900 --> 01:27:29,860
Yeah, probably.

2212
01:27:29,860 --> 01:27:32,020
I'm like, they're out here putting that in the park.

2213
01:27:32,020 --> 01:27:33,780
Yeah, I don't think that's.

2214
01:27:33,780 --> 01:27:37,500
Oh, well, I'd love to see the sun, but I think don't stop me now.

2215
01:27:37,740 --> 01:27:39,420
Oh, my God.

2216
01:27:39,420 --> 01:27:42,820
That that and maybe in some ways, I'm really just like looking

2217
01:27:42,820 --> 01:27:44,780
for some more little surprises.

2218
01:27:44,780 --> 01:27:46,900
That's really what I want.

2219
01:27:46,900 --> 01:27:49,900
Like it doesn't have to be that everyone is sad and horny.

2220
01:27:49,900 --> 01:27:52,780
But like being surprised by don't stop me now.

2221
01:27:52,780 --> 01:27:55,340
A country version of Queen.

2222
01:27:55,340 --> 01:27:57,660
I've been like, well, that's unexpected.

2223
01:27:57,660 --> 01:27:58,820
That's weird.

2224
01:27:58,820 --> 01:28:02,260
Like just finding different oddities, different ways

2225
01:28:02,260 --> 01:28:04,260
to make things interesting or odd or funny.

2226
01:28:04,260 --> 01:28:08,380
Well, this is what we were talking about it in this argument of the feeling

2227
01:28:08,380 --> 01:28:12,100
that Disney stuff is kind of inherently like sanded off at the edges.

2228
01:28:12,100 --> 01:28:14,620
And I feel like as I thought about it more and as we talked about it more,

2229
01:28:14,820 --> 01:28:17,860
it doesn't feel so like the losses don't feel huge to me.

2230
01:28:18,020 --> 01:28:19,620
But it feels like like on Club 3,

2231
01:28:19,620 --> 01:28:23,820
I was complaining about the Beach Boys, Frank Marshall documentary

2232
01:28:23,980 --> 01:28:27,860
and how it's almost like a thing that's like and then and they like very Disney.

2233
01:28:27,860 --> 01:28:29,940
They lived happily ever after.

2234
01:28:29,940 --> 01:28:31,140
Oh, by the way, two of them died.

2235
01:28:31,140 --> 01:28:31,860
And don't worry about that.

2236
01:28:31,860 --> 01:28:35,460
And Brian and mental struggles enough that there was a full movie made about it.

2237
01:28:35,460 --> 01:28:37,420
And but don't and the struggles continue to this day.

2238
01:28:37,420 --> 01:28:39,100
OK, don't worry about it.

2239
01:28:39,100 --> 01:28:43,420
And that is that is a kind of a I think I think Disney,

2240
01:28:43,980 --> 01:28:47,020
Disney's modern stuff is definitely

2241
01:28:47,420 --> 01:28:52,700
I not to say it was ever edgier, but boy, is it not now.

2242
01:28:52,900 --> 01:28:58,300
And I don't need them to sing songs about whooping and being turned on.

2243
01:28:58,540 --> 01:29:02,780
But I but like a five percent more weird.

2244
01:29:02,940 --> 01:29:06,420
It's not about dirty, inappropriate.

2245
01:29:06,420 --> 01:29:08,340
And I think it's about weird.

2246
01:29:08,340 --> 01:29:10,500
I think so. That's where I think I align with you.

2247
01:29:11,260 --> 01:29:13,500
It doesn't take much. I think this is pretty successful.

2248
01:29:13,500 --> 01:29:16,420
But in this list, he's a tramp.

2249
01:29:17,380 --> 01:29:18,260
Oh, yeah, yeah.

2250
01:29:18,260 --> 01:29:20,100
A girl worth fighting for.

2251
01:29:20,100 --> 01:29:24,300
I mean, these are probably good to you for the great mouth.

2252
01:29:24,300 --> 01:29:28,020
The decisions of songs were based on what people know.

2253
01:29:28,020 --> 01:29:32,020
Yes. And the famous ones that are 25, 30 years old.

2254
01:29:32,020 --> 01:29:35,220
And then the newer things they could pick from new stuff

2255
01:29:35,220 --> 01:29:37,380
that will probably have sequels.

2256
01:29:37,380 --> 01:29:40,700
Yeah, I will say this all could have gone a lot.

2257
01:29:41,020 --> 01:29:46,100
Like the yes, 100 percent more unfortunate, like in this land choice

2258
01:29:46,100 --> 01:29:50,660
of like we're closing the shooting gallery to build a vacation club lounge.

2259
01:29:50,740 --> 01:29:51,980
Yeah, that sucks.

2260
01:29:51,980 --> 01:29:53,140
Like, that's weird.

2261
01:29:53,140 --> 01:29:56,540
And the room there was rumor for years that they were going to put

2262
01:29:56,540 --> 01:30:02,140
like a Toy Story Marionette show in here, which at least would have been a trick.

2263
01:30:02,660 --> 01:30:07,540
That might have been a planted rumor to find leakers.

2264
01:30:07,540 --> 01:30:09,380
Yeah. Or to see if people like it.

2265
01:30:09,380 --> 01:30:12,140
Some people have claimed, though, that there were at least plans for it.

2266
01:30:12,180 --> 01:30:14,660
Well, there's that one rumor that leaked also that it was going to be

2267
01:30:14,660 --> 01:30:19,380
kind of more remodeled on that very successful book that was made into a film

2268
01:30:19,380 --> 01:30:21,820
and that it was going to be turned into bear billy elegy.

2269
01:30:22,660 --> 01:30:24,780
And I think that's really smart that they didn't go.

2270
01:30:24,780 --> 01:30:28,420
I think now that would be that was a really divisive show.

2271
01:30:28,820 --> 01:30:32,380
If we could have gotten Glenn Close's Mimaw Bear in there.

2272
01:30:34,220 --> 01:30:35,540
Mimaw Bear would have been good.

2273
01:30:35,540 --> 01:30:38,700
That might have transcended the she's doing attractions.

2274
01:30:38,860 --> 01:30:40,380
She might have done Mimaw Bear.

2275
01:30:40,380 --> 01:30:41,780
The nice thing.

2276
01:30:41,780 --> 01:30:45,420
The nice thing is, is that the bears are refreshed.

2277
01:30:45,460 --> 01:30:46,940
They look good.

2278
01:30:46,940 --> 01:30:49,500
This is not going away anytime soon.

2279
01:30:49,500 --> 01:30:52,900
And there is a possibility for new shows.

2280
01:30:53,140 --> 01:30:55,460
I have not seen anyone say it.

2281
01:30:55,460 --> 01:30:57,020
Uh huh. But it could happen.

2282
01:30:57,020 --> 01:30:58,340
But it's possible.

2283
01:30:58,340 --> 01:31:00,260
And more set up for it to happen now.

2284
01:31:00,260 --> 01:31:04,340
Yes, because everything is refreshed and it's going to at least last for 10, 15 years.

2285
01:31:04,500 --> 01:31:09,860
Yeah. If they try to change the bears a little, there is not a chance

2286
01:31:10,300 --> 01:31:15,740
of workers getting blasted with hydraulic fluid by taking a jacket off.

2287
01:31:15,740 --> 01:31:19,980
Like taking that tag off of the clothes that a Coles that hits you with the ink.

2288
01:31:19,980 --> 01:31:23,620
If you try to steal a shirt, an expensive shirt.

2289
01:31:23,620 --> 01:31:27,780
Workers will not be blinded by out of date old fluid.

2290
01:31:27,820 --> 01:31:32,500
Right. So that's possible that they could do new stuff.

2291
01:31:32,500 --> 01:31:35,140
And I think the potential is there.

2292
01:31:35,140 --> 01:31:38,540
But yeah, yeah, I think chances are

2293
01:31:39,300 --> 01:31:42,180
there will the weirdness will never come back.

2294
01:31:42,660 --> 01:31:44,620
The weirdness can never come back.

2295
01:31:46,140 --> 01:31:49,860
In any part of the Disney company, I guess, in a way here.

2296
01:31:49,860 --> 01:31:53,340
Yeah, because like that's if there's any, you know,

2297
01:31:54,060 --> 01:31:57,780
Jason, I like a lot of Marvel stuff, Marvel movies, but that does feel like it's in a box.

2298
01:31:57,780 --> 01:31:59,500
There's a certain box you got to play in.

2299
01:31:59,500 --> 01:32:02,580
Obviously, no, Deadpool is going to blow this box wide open with this.

2300
01:32:02,580 --> 01:32:05,340
Our rating, I am looking forward to it.

2301
01:32:05,340 --> 01:32:06,140
I will say that.

2302
01:32:06,140 --> 01:32:10,500
But it feels very much like you got to stay in your lane and rides feel that way.

2303
01:32:10,500 --> 01:32:13,460
And movies and TV and stuff feel that way.

2304
01:32:13,820 --> 01:32:18,180
And I just I lament the lack of weirdness more than anything.

2305
01:32:18,180 --> 01:32:20,460
But it's good that they're it's good.

2306
01:32:20,460 --> 01:32:24,540
They're around the big bears still big bear like big bears still there.

2307
01:32:25,100 --> 01:32:26,740
And the big bear is funny.

2308
01:32:26,740 --> 01:32:30,940
Yeah. Yes. But yeah, I mean, if shouldn't we be taking

2309
01:32:31,380 --> 01:32:35,780
cues from Deadpool and if that's part of the company now and that's pointing

2310
01:32:36,180 --> 01:32:41,060
then should not some characters in this new country bear show do a song about pegging?

2311
01:32:41,260 --> 01:32:45,780
Yeah, I that's an important is apparently a big character trait.

2312
01:32:45,780 --> 01:32:49,060
Now I need to get caught up on Deadpool because I'm more behind on that.

2313
01:32:49,060 --> 01:32:50,300
The Breaking Bad.

2314
01:32:50,300 --> 01:32:53,340
So I got to watch those two movies fast so I can see the third.

2315
01:32:53,340 --> 01:32:57,300
Jason has a legal pad at home and it says get caught up on one

2316
01:32:57,300 --> 01:33:01,180
Deadpool to pegging to get prepared for this new movie.

2317
01:33:02,180 --> 01:33:06,100
Well, he just wants to read up to make sure he's caught up.

2318
01:33:07,580 --> 01:33:09,700
Either you put Deadpool on the ride.

2319
01:33:09,700 --> 01:33:13,020
But wouldn't it be funny if they made if the ride open, it was like way worse

2320
01:33:13,140 --> 01:33:14,860
and more aggressive and dirty.

2321
01:33:14,860 --> 01:33:16,220
And you're like, what?

2322
01:33:16,220 --> 01:33:17,380
How did they get away with this?

2323
01:33:17,380 --> 01:33:19,820
And then Deadpool showed up and you go, oh, I get it.

2324
01:33:19,820 --> 01:33:21,340
Oh, yeah. Deadpool's here.

2325
01:33:21,340 --> 01:33:23,420
Yeah. Chibi Changa's got it.

2326
01:33:23,420 --> 01:33:27,500
Henry pulls his mask off and you realize who it's been the whole time.

2327
01:33:27,500 --> 01:33:29,580
How is Deadpool going to be?

2328
01:33:29,620 --> 01:33:31,900
He's going to be in the parks.

2329
01:33:31,900 --> 01:33:35,460
There's no way Deadpool and I'm this is all speculation,

2330
01:33:35,460 --> 01:33:38,060
but Deadpool is going to be in another 10 movies.

2331
01:33:38,540 --> 01:33:41,140
Then when all is said and done, he's going to walk around

2332
01:33:41,140 --> 01:33:43,060
Avengers campus and roast it.

2333
01:33:43,060 --> 01:33:45,580
I'm sure Deadpool will be a walk around character soon.

2334
01:33:46,260 --> 01:33:47,820
Maybe next week or two weeks from now.

2335
01:33:47,820 --> 01:33:54,140
But there's like Deadpool ride, I bet, is like going to shoot up to the priority list.

2336
01:33:54,820 --> 01:33:57,580
And I wonder how that will look in a Disney park.

2337
01:33:58,300 --> 01:34:00,700
How long did you wait, idiots?

2338
01:34:00,700 --> 01:34:02,940
What? That's what he says.

2339
01:34:02,940 --> 01:34:04,140
Oh, in the line, I see.

2340
01:34:04,140 --> 01:34:06,100
Oh, how long did you wait, an hour or two?

2341
01:34:06,100 --> 01:34:07,540
I like that Deadpool impression.

2342
01:34:07,540 --> 01:34:08,860
How long did you wait, idiot?

2343
01:34:08,860 --> 01:34:11,420
I don't know what he sounds like.

2344
01:34:11,420 --> 01:34:13,140
I haven't watched the.

2345
01:34:13,140 --> 01:34:16,300
He sounds like everybody who's been in any commercial in the last 20 years.

2346
01:34:16,300 --> 01:34:18,300
Just kind of like a fast talking attitude guy.

2347
01:34:18,300 --> 01:34:20,940
So he sounds like the two of us.

2348
01:34:21,420 --> 01:34:24,580
Well, yeah, no, no, not those commercial actors.

2349
01:34:25,060 --> 01:34:27,100
He's talking about a different type.

2350
01:34:27,100 --> 01:34:29,940
Yeah, guys, you guys who kind of like shake their head around more.

2351
01:34:30,180 --> 01:34:32,620
Yeah, he's yeah.

2352
01:34:32,620 --> 01:34:35,140
But what does maybe this is a future up.

2353
01:34:35,140 --> 01:34:40,300
So we imagine what the Deadpool ride will be, you know, because we're thinking

2354
01:34:40,300 --> 01:34:43,460
we're going to we're going to fix Tomorrowland soon.

2355
01:34:43,500 --> 01:34:45,700
We're all going to do have different assignments.

2356
01:34:45,700 --> 01:34:47,420
Jason, of course, has budget tomorrow.

2357
01:34:47,420 --> 01:34:49,820
And I have reasonable, moderate sized budget.

2358
01:34:50,140 --> 01:34:52,460
Twenty twenty four Disney Tomorrowland.

2359
01:34:52,500 --> 01:34:58,300
Scott has blue sky, sky, unlimited sort of budget and imagination Tomorrowland.

2360
01:34:58,540 --> 01:35:00,740
But maybe in the future, we do this with Deadpool.

2361
01:35:00,740 --> 01:35:03,860
We each get different assignments and figure out what kind of a ride

2362
01:35:03,860 --> 01:35:05,340
Deadpool will have in the future.

2363
01:35:05,340 --> 01:35:08,580
I really don't know enough about Deadpool to begin to do it now again.

2364
01:35:08,580 --> 01:35:10,620
I'll have to catch up much as Jason does.

2365
01:35:10,860 --> 01:35:14,980
All I know is I from from what we've just been talking about about him.

2366
01:35:15,140 --> 01:35:18,780
I think I have a good idea of how the Deadpool ride could secure you in place.

2367
01:35:19,020 --> 01:35:22,700
Very true. All right.

2368
01:35:22,700 --> 01:35:27,420
I'm calling it. You survived the ride on that note.

2369
01:35:29,900 --> 01:35:32,660
Do do let us know like other series you want,

2370
01:35:33,940 --> 01:35:36,900
you know, the other things we can return to all our country.

2371
01:35:36,900 --> 01:35:39,180
We're jammer week for three bonus episodes every month.

2372
01:35:39,180 --> 01:35:42,420
Check out podcast, the ride, the second gate or get one more bonus

2373
01:35:42,420 --> 01:35:45,180
episode on our VIP tier club three.

2374
01:35:45,180 --> 01:35:48,980
We'll find all of that at Patreon dot com slash podcast, the ride.

2375
01:35:50,380 --> 01:35:53,260
And there's nothing we don't have to say.

2376
01:35:53,260 --> 01:35:55,620
Chimichangas are what Deadpool would say.

2377
01:35:55,620 --> 01:35:57,820
I guess that's because it's kind of a non sequitur.

2378
01:35:57,820 --> 01:35:58,780
This is all I know.

2379
01:35:58,780 --> 01:36:02,140
When he's come up on the show, the word chimichanga is then immediately been said.

2380
01:36:02,140 --> 01:36:04,020
And now that I know, pegging is part of it.

2381
01:36:04,020 --> 01:36:07,620
And that's that's my Deadpool word.

2382
01:36:08,340 --> 01:36:11,540
We could we could add context to that and say that there was an article

2383
01:36:11,540 --> 01:36:14,620
that came out that Kevin Feige had to explain because Deadpool references

2384
01:36:14,620 --> 01:36:16,180
pegging, the sexual act.

2385
01:36:16,180 --> 01:36:19,100
And Kevin Feige, if you're wondering why in the world

2386
01:36:19,100 --> 01:36:23,420
the last 10 minutes of this pegging, Kevin Feige had to explain to coworkers,

2387
01:36:23,420 --> 01:36:24,580
which really sounds like an H.R.

2388
01:36:24,580 --> 01:36:26,300
nightmare. Yeah.

2389
01:36:26,300 --> 01:36:28,580
Boss, explain a sexual thing to you.

2390
01:36:29,380 --> 01:36:31,380
But anyway, so

2391
01:36:31,700 --> 01:36:34,180
Deadpool week coming soon.

2392
01:36:34,180 --> 01:36:37,020
You know, it sounds you know, it sounds like a much bigger nightmare

2393
01:36:37,020 --> 01:36:41,620
is our three dorky hosts of a podcast explaining who are relative

2394
01:36:41,620 --> 01:36:45,340
at low levels of sexual comfort, explaining what pegging is to you.

2395
01:36:45,660 --> 01:36:47,860
God, that sounds like the biggest nightmare of all.

2396
01:36:48,220 --> 01:36:49,060
No, thanks.

2397
01:36:49,060 --> 01:36:52,260
We can we get a hold of Deadpool co-creators,

2398
01:36:52,260 --> 01:36:55,700
Phoebe and Nisi and the Rob Liefeld and Joe Kelly.

2399
01:36:55,700 --> 01:36:57,380
You added the funny stuff.

2400
01:36:57,380 --> 01:37:02,580
Which of them, what do they think about all the pegging discourse around Deadpool?

2401
01:37:02,900 --> 01:37:06,500
Is it just in the movies or was it in the comics at some point?

2402
01:37:06,660 --> 01:37:10,260
Jason, I don't know the answer to that question.

2403
01:37:10,260 --> 01:37:11,820
I don't know when this entered.

2404
01:37:11,820 --> 01:37:14,060
How to boot up the Marvel Unlimited app.

2405
01:37:14,060 --> 01:37:15,060
And I'll try to get to the.

2406
01:37:15,060 --> 01:37:16,180
That's your assignment.

2407
01:37:16,180 --> 01:37:20,900
Put that on the number three as you find out the history of Deadpool and pegging.

2408
01:37:21,260 --> 01:37:22,260
OK.
