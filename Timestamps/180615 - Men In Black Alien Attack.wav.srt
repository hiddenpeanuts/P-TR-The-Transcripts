00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,920
Welcome to Podcast the Ride, a show hosted by three men who are still mad at each other

6
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:50,440
due to a week's old conversation about hypothetical Japanese travel itineraries.

7
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm Jason Sheridan, joined this week by Mike Carlson.

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,600
Yeah, I'm here and I'm mad.

9
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,160
Yeah, I'm upset.

10
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,160
And Scott Gerrider.

11
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,360
Well, I'm really the source of it.

12
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:06,120
So you know, I feel like I got all of my energy about it out of the way.

13
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,320
While bad, that was weeks ago.

14
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,320
We're talking already.

15
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:13,800
Yeah, so I've calmed down because I was the most agitated and I realized what a what a

16
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,320
monster I was.

17
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,920
I feel like I think I think my feeling if I didn't convey it before, we're talking about

18
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,400
how many days you spend at Tokyo Disney.

19
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,880
And I think, you know, look, it's expensive to travel a year if you're going to go to

20
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,560
Japan, you want to, you know, you want to spend a lot of days, but you'd you know, you

21
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:40,160
don't have infinite time and and the parks are expensive and, you know, to devote four

22
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,200
days to.

23
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:46,200
But that's what the Twitter overwhelmingly when we had Twitter, people were like, Jason's

24
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,640
right, four days.

25
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,160
Well, but you know, they're all correct.

26
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:53,400
Yeah, think about who is following our podcast.

27
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,840
Yes, they're all mega fans, as are we.

28
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:02,760
Look, I just think I know how I am and I know how we are best to build in some buffer.

29
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,760
Look, like I feel the tension starting to boil over here.

30
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,400
We should probably curb this before.

31
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:13,200
I guess I'm ripping Mike's comic book omnibuses that I'm sitting next to.

32
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,960
I'm ripping them in half like a phone book.

33
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,600
Take your anger out on Mike's comic books.

34
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:24,040
Yeah, I guess the compromise could be two at Disney, see one at Tokyo Disney, which

35
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,360
makes Mike right.

36
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,240
I just recently made this a fair person.

37
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,160
You're you're the compromise number.

38
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:39,200
So yeah, but I also just recently read like a list of like the top hotels around Tokyo

39
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:45,240
Disney and was amazed at how affordable, like very nice looking hotels are.

40
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,800
Numbers of.

41
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,800
Yeah.

42
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,800
Well, this is very fascinating.

43
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,600
It's also it is cheaper.

44
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,160
I believe admission is cheaper.

45
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,160
It is cheaper.

46
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,160
Yeah.

47
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,160
Oh yeah.

48
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,160
Lots.

49
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,160
I think it's like sixty dollars a day.

50
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,160
Right.

51
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,160
Sixty five.

52
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,200
I think much cheaper than our parks.

53
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,760
Our friend, Andrew Grissom, who I feel like I keep mentioning on the podcast for various

54
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,760
reasons.

55
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,760
He just he just went.

56
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:10,000
None of us have been and he just went and he was like, oh, two is fine.

57
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,360
Two for sure.

58
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,360
Very firm.

59
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,400
But he only went he went to Tokyo Disney once and then I was peppering him with questions.

60
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,400
Did you go here?

61
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,400
Did you do this?

62
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,560
Did you drink in the Teddy Roosevelt lounge?

63
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,560
No, he didn't.

64
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,560
No, he didn't.

65
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,200
He was missing all these things.

66
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,680
And it's like he but he's a case more casual with it.

67
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,080
So of course he had all the rides and he liked the rides.

68
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,200
Maybe he went on, I think, one of the rides twice.

69
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,200
I forget.

70
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,440
But like he's missing.

71
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,840
That's what I'm saying.

72
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,360
We like to go to the hotels.

73
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,720
We like to go to the different lounges.

74
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,520
We have to cocktail in different places.

75
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,520
Sure.

76
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,520
That takes time and exploration.

77
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,520
Yeah.

78
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,920
He missed all of that stuff.

79
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,920
So look, one.

80
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,920
I'm mad.

81
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,920
I'm so mad.

82
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:51,160
I may also just be playing fast because like if I go, I would be going like as a single

83
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,320
man like an I can do whatever I want.

84
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,320
Oh, yeah.

85
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,320
I have not tied down.

86
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,000
You can wander around these children's parks.

87
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,120
So lobby to hotel lobby for an unlimited upsetting amount of time.

88
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,960
You know, I'm going to some hotel lobbies.

89
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,160
I absolutely am.

90
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:13,800
I think my opinion is also it is in there, certainly informed by as I've gone over my

91
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:18,920
unpleasant Disneyland Paris experience and the feeling that we had of like, oh, my God,

92
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,920
we're here.

93
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,920
We're trapped here.

94
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:26,520
We are in this place where food is bad and where, you know, aesthetics are abrasive.

95
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,800
Now, this, I think, would be less the case.

96
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,320
Well, Disney, again, doesn't park in the world.

97
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,320
Yeah.

98
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

99
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,320
That does soften it.

100
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,560
But you're also I don't think you guys know this, that when when Aaron and I went to Disney

101
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,560
World the first time together, we are think our I think our trip was I think was seven

102
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,640
days, six nights, and we had some dread on the first night.

103
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,040
We were like, we're oh, we're here.

104
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,160
We're in weird suburban Orlando.

105
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,160
We're staying off.

106
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,920
So we actually thought that was a little too much.

107
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:58,360
So then that's I know you guys do you do a 10 day.

108
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,360
We have different brains.

109
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,360
Yeah, 10 day.

110
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,680
I know what you're saying.

111
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,480
I think the first time I went to the first time I had been back to Orlando, which was

112
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:11,040
like 2012, I think I hadn't been in 10 years and we were there and I never felt like that

113
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,040
feeling.

114
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:16,000
But I remember feeling like, oh, you know, maybe it's time to go.

115
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,680
Maybe this is different than Disneyland.

116
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,280
Disneyland is for sure better than I went last September, which is what, three or something

117
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,760
years later, more than three.

118
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,880
And then you start to get a little more familiar with it.

119
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,200
And then, of course, I'm a maniac and I went in March and I'll be honest, I've been craving

120
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,580
going back to Orlando more and more each time.

121
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:36,800
How many what were the lengths of your stays?

122
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,960
Let's get some facts and figures on the original.

123
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:45,940
The original I think we did like six nights, seven days.

124
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:50,600
And I think then maybe we did like a day longer last fall.

125
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:58,360
And then I was there for a short time comparably, comparably five days or so in March.

126
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:03,960
And I do think you you're taught you like a shorter punchier situation in general, I

127
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:04,960
think.

128
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,520
I think leave me wanting more instead of feeling bored.

129
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,360
Yeah, but there's so much.

130
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,520
Look, we've got to get to other topics here.

131
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,720
But like, look, we discovered reopened.

132
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,200
I didn't mean to read.

133
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,640
You said it, Jason.

134
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,640
You said it at the start.

135
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:23,320
I was so pleased with myself for writing that joke down because sometimes I struggle.

136
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,320
It's not even a joke.

137
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,560
It was just like a rehab.

138
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,560
Let's talk about this.

139
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,560
All right.

140
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,560
A statement.

141
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,160
I was so pleased with myself.

142
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,800
I know you're always pleased with yourself.

143
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,800
Well, that is true.

144
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,680
But I mean, I'm just saying I went to Orlando and this last time I went to Orlando is when

145
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:43,600
because I had been recently, I got to do what I think is some of the best stuff.

146
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:49,960
Sit at the Abracadabra bar over in the hotel in the bar in the magic themed bar and have

147
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,500
a couple of Manhattans.

148
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:55,360
That was one of my favorite things I did all trip and much reminiscent of what we get to

149
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,320
do at Disneyland because we live so close and have the annual pass.

150
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,720
Be chill at these places.

151
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,720
Yes.

152
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,480
So when I'm talking about Tokyo Disney Sea, I see this Teddy Roosevelt lounge and I get

153
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:10,080
the big I get the big wolf eyes because I go, we're going to spend two nice hours in

154
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:15,080
the middle of the day having a couple of cocktails in this themed boat.

155
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:20,640
And that's an honor that's honoring one of our one of our best president, one of our

156
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,640
best lunatic friends.

157
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:26,240
He was a madman, but he was he's perfectly right.

158
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,040
I like the current breed of madman.

159
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,040
Yeah, no, no, no.

160
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,960
I like more folksy lovable.

161
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,560
The here's I think what it drives that to me is I think there's a bigger issue here,

162
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:40,040
which is like I like this stuff enough to do this whole podcast about it.

163
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,440
Did you ever hit a limit?

164
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,440
Are you ever like, I can't talk about this more today.

165
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:49,160
I can't be at this place because I love it more than most human beings.

166
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:52,480
But like, you know, my my that I'll go to Disneyland for just a couple of hours.

167
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:56,520
I will hit a wall of just like I have to have a real item of food.

168
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:59,880
I can't look at these signs and be around these crowd.

169
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,800
Like I just I do have a level.

170
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,000
I think that's a reason.

171
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,280
I think it's reasonable overload on any.

172
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:11,080
I mean, certainly comedy or comic book, any of my areas of interest

173
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:17,080
or passion going past like you can just soft serve ice cream, soft serve ice cream.

174
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,840
Go like, God damn it, I want some hard packed for once.

175
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:27,480
Yeah, I I'm trying to think like I get that way more about Vegas.

176
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:33,960
Vegas, I spent there was one trip like four days in Vegas and four days is far too much.

177
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,280
Yeah, I like three might be perfect for me.

178
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,000
I could not find a vegetable.

179
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,520
Like we kept going to restaurants and there was just no salad on the menu.

180
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,440
Yeah, it was like just a hamburger after.

181
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,000
And you're like, I got to eat a salad.

182
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,920
I got to sit down. I got to relax.

183
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,760
I got very overwhelmed there after a couple of days.

184
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:54,280
I assume there is a limit for my thing.

185
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,040
I assume there it exists.

186
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,880
Do I know what it is? I don't know.

187
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,520
You've never encountered it.

188
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,800
Well, I've encountered it.

189
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,000
There was a Disney day.

190
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,200
There was a they had a 24 hour Disney event a few years ago.

191
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,320
It's before we knew each other.

192
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,520
Jason, I don't think you were I think it was just Lindsay.

193
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,360
And there was one.

194
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,960
Oh, I went down for at two or three in the morning.

195
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,200
Yeah. So we had been there for a while.

196
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:15,800
A couple hours.

197
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,760
And it was a real nightmare in regards to crowds.

198
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,640
And we couldn't even get in Disneyland.

199
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,280
We were in California Adventure mostly.

200
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,640
But then there was all this word that we were going to be allowed

201
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:28,480
because the Hatbox Ghost was debuting and we really wanted to see that.

202
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,200
God damn Hatbox Ghost.

203
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,920
God, can you imagine like that was only a few years ago

204
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,240
that they're like the park's open for 24 hours straight.

205
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,480
Also, we put in a new thing.

206
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,480
Also, all parishes are clear.

207
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,560
And I remember just insane to me.

208
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,640
I remember. Yeah.

209
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,040
Different time pre Star Wars time.

210
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,960
Yeah. So we were waiting in California Adventure and like one or two or three.

211
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,880
I mean, that's you know, you get tired, of course.

212
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:57,320
And then there was word they're going to let people back into Disneyland.

213
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:01,040
The fire chief, the fire marshal is going to let people in Disneyland.

214
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:05,040
So then we started congregating and it was turned into this bizarre

215
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,760
mob scene of people waiting California Adventures exit to get to Disneyland.

216
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,680
And people started getting a little unruly.

217
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,920
There was a weird bad vibe in the crowd.

218
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,680
And I remember going like, we should leave.

219
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,160
This is too much.

220
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,200
So like too many crowds.

221
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,640
Stock 99. Yeah.

222
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,680
I was like, we're going to get crushed to death

223
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,960
because people want to see the Hatbox Ghost.

224
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:30,360
Oh, I had a weird like crowd back up a couple of years ago on Main Street,

225
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,160
like right after Christmas stuff had gone out.

226
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,920
It was like a Thursday at noon.

227
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:39,240
And like somehow the there was a parade starting in like 40 minutes.

228
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:46,800
The street was already packed and they just weren't doing a bad job of like this.

229
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,440
This goes this way and this goes this way.

230
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,960
And people started to get like, just grow.

231
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,200
I want to move.

232
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,280
And it's just like, oh, God, I'm going to get crushed.

233
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,280
So, yeah, that was a similar vibe to that.

234
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,320
I'm going to.

235
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,200
So we're feeling like, OK, that's it.

236
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,400
We got to go. OK.

237
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,840
So Lindsay and I, we walk, we're leaving.

238
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,880
We get out the exit and we see on Twitter

239
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:13,240
Disneyland entrance now people are now being let in as soon as we exit.

240
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,720
And we're like, oh, so we go back up to the exit

241
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,920
and we explain what it just happened.

242
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,880
And we're like, can we just because there was a huge line to even get in still

243
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,560
at three in the morning, the security line was not moving.

244
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,280
It was backed up.

245
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,280
We explained like, we just got out of here, blah, blah, blah, blah.

246
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,600
And a guy was nice enough.

247
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,280
He goes, if anybody he goes, if anyone yells at you, tell him I let you do this.

248
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:31,960
And he was very nice.

249
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:35,440
We should have gotten his name and put a thing in because he certainly underpaid.

250
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:41,280
And then we went to then we went into Disneyland and it all the dread

251
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,640
I had been feeling floated away.

252
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,760
I was back in Disneyland.

253
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,440
It was three thirty a.m.

254
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,520
I was going down Main Street.

255
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,440
It was a spooky atmosphere.

256
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,240
You're like, man, I think I don't get to hang out here doing this at this time.

257
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,480
And then I started appreciating it from a different angle.

258
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,200
We went on the haunted mansion and it was like the spookiest haunted mansion

259
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,400
because it was legit in the middle of the night.

260
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,320
There was a new ghost.

261
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,080
I remember like Lindsay was like because she was like loopy

262
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,720
because it was so goddamn late.

263
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,920
She was like we were seeing all the extra photos of Hatbox Ghost on the wall.

264
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,480
She's like, oh, they're like she was extra scared.

265
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,880
We got to see him.

266
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,400
We left the park and we were so happy that we did.

267
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,560
So like I can I'm saying like there'll be moments,

268
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,480
but I can come back from them.

269
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,560
They are not like stop all.

270
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:30,680
They're not at your ab the absolute dark at one dark night of the soul

271
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:34,680
at three thirty in the morning under the worst conditions in Disneyland history.

272
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,080
Yes. You this is like I turned it around.

273
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:42,280
If I asked my dad, like, have you ever questioned your faith or Catholicism

274
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:45,800
or believing in God like, well, one time I was like about to die.

275
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,840
The plane was dovetailing for 20 seconds.

276
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:53,240
And then and I know then back on track and I'm all but like you're

277
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,880
you know, I don't want the I like these answers.

278
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:01,520
This is how I saw I want it to be like we all do at our our speed.

279
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:04,400
I like that this is as different as any of us are.

280
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,160
This is not a podcast where it's like one of them likes Disneyland

281
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,800
and the other one doesn't like that.

282
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:13,040
We this is this is as different as any of us get.

283
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,800
Like I prefer only do 10 hours instead of 19

284
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:23,640
to get. I'm getting really probably very dark, but I get I really

285
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:27,760
I start to think about my own mortality in relation to everything I do.

286
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,760
I think like concerts or like going to Disney or going to Orlando.

287
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,440
I start going, well, if I live to this, like I can go to Orlando.

288
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,400
If I go like every couple of years, I'm only going to really get there

289
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,760
like 20 more times.

290
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,240
Like you go like that and all of it to Orlando.

291
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,080
Well, I'm just your life's anything.

292
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,160
How many times you can fit in Orlando?

293
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,120
I get that you have a long, dark night of the soul.

294
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,720
Yeah, yeah. I don't do it every time every night.

295
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,520
But I think about stuff like that.

296
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:58,560
I think about, oh, man, yeah, this is going to be a fun thing to do.

297
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,920
And I'll remember it.

298
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:04,360
And if you if you could like open a magic envelope from heaven

299
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:07,320
and it told you how many more times you were going to get to be in Orlando

300
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,360
before you die, would you do it?

301
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,640
Oh, I would.

302
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,000
I probably or movie.

303
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,160
Can you change? Can you change it then?

304
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,800
That's the difference.

305
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,440
Mm hmm. That's the question in any film of this nature.

306
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,840
Yeah. How does it what's the nature of fate?

307
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,840
Can you change fate? You change fate.

308
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:26,840
These are the questions that this envelope film will ask.

309
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,160
I mean, what is this, the box?

310
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,840
I think it's like the box.

311
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,840
It's a Disney park centric version of the box.

312
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:40,360
I like I like doing this podcast because I do think that one way or another,

313
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:43,600
it will lead to us having to just go to Orlando for casual trips.

314
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,840
I don't know if that's because we'll be doing live shows

315
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,680
because we'll be full time imagineers.

316
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,040
Month. Yeah. The once a month live show.

317
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,840
We just have community service.

318
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,520
We have to do that.

319
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,160
I won't be bad either.

320
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,240
But I love the idea.

321
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,680
Into the Florida project slums.

322
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,640
The Patreon did not go well.

323
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,080
Hey, fine. That's fine with me.

324
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,920
We lost the Patreon took money away from us.

325
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:10,560
How do we get more negative money than we already are?

326
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:12,960
But it's cursed.

327
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,080
So we end up in Orlando anyway.

328
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:19,680
I mean, I love the idea of just going to Orlando for a three day weekend, too.

329
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,960
I love the idea of punching in and punch out in Orlando.

330
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,880
I've always been curious what that's like. Yeah.

331
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,160
And like, yeah, doing a couple parks.

332
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,000
And then you go, well, we'll be back in six months.

333
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,640
It's no problem. We'll do the other thing.

334
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,640
This is not what you're already doing.

335
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,760
Well, I'm trying.

336
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,840
My commercial stopped airing.

337
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:39,000
You are thinking about your own mortality.

338
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,040
I am. Yeah, I think about it all the time.

339
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,240
You know what? We can't be grim like this.

340
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,680
We have to think about a brighter future.

341
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:50,200
And I know the man who's going to lead us there, the eventual mayor of Disneyland,

342
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,200
Jason Sheridan.

343
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,720
A better land is possible.

344
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,960
A better world is possible.

345
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:59,040
I just to take us into this that we haven't talked about

346
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,760
hashtag Jason for DLR in a little bit.

347
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:05,120
I think you're going to bring some hope to this place and to Mike's life.

348
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:10,000
Hopefully to recap, though, yeah, if you just started listening to this episode,

349
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:14,880
we were talking about there are mayors for the respective theme parks,

350
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,520
Disneyland and Disney World.

351
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,520
There are mayors of Main Street.

352
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:22,120
And it was a position we found Lindsay and I discovered when we were there

353
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,560
on one of the anniversary days.

354
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,360
And they were like, ladies and gentlemen, the mayor of Disneyland.

355
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,440
And he came out and we're like, what the hell?

356
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,280
There's a man at the top at that's called the mayor. Yeah.

357
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:36,200
And we want our own Jason Sheridan many years from now. Or honestly,

358
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,840
I mean, today, fine, too.

359
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:41,160
But I mean, many years from now to run and successfully win

360
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,840
and become the mayor of Disneyland.

361
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,880
We recently have come across some new information.

362
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,200
And I thank people on Twitter for alerting us to this.

363
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:53,520
But there was a there's a podcast called Obsessed with Joseph Scrimshaw.

364
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:57,360
And he did an episode devoted to the Disney parks.

365
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:02,040
And his guest was Mark Gagliardi, who is a podcaster as well

366
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:05,040
and a participant in the Thrilling Adventure Hour.

367
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,720
And he this this person

368
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:13,160
served as the mayor of Disneyland or the mayor of Main Street. Right.

369
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:16,640
I think one issue with this position is that if we don't know what it is,

370
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,200
it's a bit unclear specifically, you're the mayor of

371
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,240
that that's where you're going to clean that up, Jason.

372
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,080
You'll know your own jurisdiction. Yeah.

373
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:29,440
Well, I likely expand the scope of power.

374
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:33,080
Like a president who issues a lot of executive orders.

375
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,040
Well, you're and you would have to.

376
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:38,760
I feel like they they probably didn't count California Adventure as part of it.

377
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,920
But you certainly not.

378
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,800
They wouldn't have had plans for that in 55.

379
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,800
You know, they were never thinking that far ahead.

380
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:49,800
Yeah. Whenever the town the town statutes were put on the parchment.

381
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:53,200
Yeah. And whenever Walt's there was an Articles of Confederation

382
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:58,320
for a few years before there was finally a constitution on Main Street,

383
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,440
much like America.

384
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,080
I'm suddenly worried about a civil war situation

385
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,720
where California Adventure is like the Confederacy.

386
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,960
And what if what if some I shouldn't.

387
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,480
We're trying to be positive here.

388
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,680
I'm putting a dark spin on this.

389
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:14,200
But some rival, the rival mayor of California Adventure

390
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,640
tried to usurp half of your power.

391
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,440
I mean, I think we thankfully dodged that.

392
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,560
I think that was coming.

393
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,640
It would have come in 2012 when they actually see

394
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:28,600
when California Adventure newly empowered, newly revitalized.

395
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:31,800
And that's when they were the most emboldened.

396
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:37,200
Right. It's been six years and already stuff is starting to be rolled back.

397
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,360
And that's what you're going to.

398
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:43,360
You have to keep the there has to be one one ruler to lead them all.

399
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,560
And that's going to be you.

400
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:47,560
But here. But this podcast was interesting because it shed some light

401
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:53,440
on some specifics about about the actual role, mainly that it is fake.

402
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:57,040
It was a this man is an actor and a performer.

403
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:00,840
And he shared this duty with three other actors.

404
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,880
Mark Gugler already seems like a fascinating guy.

405
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,720
We'd love to talk to him.

406
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,920
But he he not only was the the mayor, one of four mayors of Main Street

407
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:12,920
during the 50th anniversary in 2005, he was also many different

408
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,480
performer roles in the parks, including the genie in the.

409
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,600
Wow. And show in California.

410
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,920
My favorite. Yes.

411
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,920
I know that passion of Mike's.

412
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:27,880
But also so but it was interesting to hear what actually the mayor did.

413
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,280
And it seems like there are a couple of main duties.

414
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,360
And you can listen to this podcast yourself to hear all of it.

415
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:35,480
But but one of them is that during the 50th anniversary,

416
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:39,400
he would give a little speech up atop the train station

417
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,320
before they let everybody in at 10 in the morning or what have you.

418
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:45,560
And he'd make a speech surrounded by the big five.

419
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:49,000
Oh, yeah. Mickey Donald's goofy Pluto.

420
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,360
Many. Yeah.

421
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,600
Stitch home on the range cow.

422
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,320
Now it is New Lando.

423
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,000
Now, you know, Donald Orlando is in the big five.

424
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,080
But this was in 2005 was different.

425
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:04,320
And so he would give a speech kind of

426
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,680
a little bit in the spirit of Walt's original address opening Disneyland.

427
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,360
And then he would get to release doves.

428
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,360
Doves would fly at his command.

429
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:17,000
I want to just rehash their podcast, but they're homing doves

430
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,040
and they would go back to the dove guy's house, which I thought was weird.

431
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,680
They fly into the air.

432
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,480
And wherever the dove guy is in the Orange County area,

433
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,640
he goes back to their balcony or whatever.

434
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:31,840
I guess that's going to change immediately because I want fresh doves every day.

435
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,880
What happens to the slaughter?

436
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,000
They're not going to come back.

437
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,440
What happens there?

438
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,920
Off, they are off to live their lives.

439
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,800
You want to know? You're free.

440
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,920
You want to release untrained doves into the air.

441
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,280
So they just go somewhere.

442
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,240
I mean, they would be trained to fly.

443
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,840
And that's all birds need to do.

444
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,080
If you're releasing a bunch of doves each day, though,

445
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:56,640
there's going to be a weird like dove population that shows up in Anaheim.

446
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,960
And they're like going to start menacing people.

447
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,000
I'm sure it'll be fine.

448
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,800
It's like the exotic parrots of Brooklyn.

449
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,320
Do you know about those? I don't.

450
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:07,520
A crate of exotic birds was like broken open in

451
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:12,680
the middle 20th century, I think, in Brooklyn or around Brooklyn.

452
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:16,360
And a bunch of parrots have now like roosted.

453
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:21,560
And you just occasionally see like a weird multicolored parrot in Brooklyn.

454
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,160
Weird. Still the case.

455
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,760
Still the case. Yeah.

456
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:28,920
Multiply. There's also some kawaii a couple years ago.

457
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,800
And there's a lot of roosters running around roosters of just,

458
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:35,960
you know, like just taking their run of the place and they're

459
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,480
what do you call a rooster crow?

460
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,080
It's not a crow. They aren't crows.

461
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:44,320
What's a cockadoodledoo?

462
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,200
Is it just that? It's a cockadoodledoo.

463
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,200
They're cockadoodledoodling all day. Oh, yeah.

464
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:54,160
So maybe it's you're saying it's an Orange County.

465
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:57,920
If you live in Fullerton or Garden Grove, you just doves are around.

466
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,400
And that's how it is now. And deal with it.

467
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:03,240
I think it would be a bonus beautification for our friendly neighbors.

468
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:07,160
I like that you're using your mayor voice now, too. Sure.

469
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,280
Hello there. Yeah, you're getting a little more.

470
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:15,680
I mean, this guy, Mark, did did kind of he summarized his speech.

471
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:20,600
And ladies and gentlemen, I think he talks about how he says, thank you, Mickey.

472
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,000
So you got a real like husky, accurate voice.

473
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,200
And you make sure you're in you're in line with that.

474
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,280
Keep working the throat.

475
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,880
But he also then he grand marshaled the parade.

476
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,160
Which seems like I see you doing that.

477
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:37,040
No, I can visualize that happily.

478
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,520
Yeah. Great voice.

479
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,920
Great physical stamina.

480
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,360
You're going to be great.

481
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,840
Anybody who any naysayers out there think Jason can't do this.

482
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:49,200
No, fuck. Why? Yeah.

483
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,320
I don't think anyone's offered a reason to not.

484
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,520
But I yeah, I don't know.

485
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,280
I think what the shed a light on for me is that these duties were largely

486
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:04,120
ceremonial. And I think and now I don't know what's going on with the

487
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:08,680
when you experienced this mayor announcement at a different anniversary,

488
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:11,280
maybe the mayor has more power.

489
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,680
But I think obviously we would want with Jason installed.

490
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,320
We don't want you to just be a figurehead.

491
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,680
We want to get some stuff done.

492
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,680
No, I've got planks in a platform.

493
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:23,200
Yeah, I think I think look, the man makes the position.

494
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,880
I mean, we can and we just got to get you in.

495
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:29,240
And then I think at that point, then, you know, you can start calling the shots.

496
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:32,720
Then we can start passing stuff and mending things.

497
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,240
And yeah, at that point, yeah, then it will be there's not going to be

498
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,720
a ceremonial position, and you're not going to share that with other people.

499
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,440
Like you're talking about this guy shares like the role of mayor with other actors.

500
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,880
No, no, no, no, no. That's one thing in 2005.

501
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,280
But yeah, and then you're going to be there seven days a week.

502
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,280
Yeah.

503
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,800
Waltz apartment is mine.

504
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

505
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,840
That is my office slash.

506
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:00,080
Yeah, your first order first act as mayor is to take away Waltz apartment

507
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,280
and turn it into Jason's apartment.

508
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:05,160
So then when you've passed on, people will see there.

509
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,400
There'll be like a light in there and they'll be like, you know,

510
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,480
that's Jason's office. Absolutely.

511
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,120
Yeah. Jason used to sleep down here.

512
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:14,480
Jason reactivated the panini machine, the hot plate.

513
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,680
Do you you use the old penny?

514
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:19,640
You're not bringing a new you're not bringing a George Foreman grill in there.

515
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,560
No, those can get far too messy.

516
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:26,520
Now, I will use the new one until I eventually start a small electrical fire.

517
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,080
I'm sure the night this 1990 or 1955 building will be.

518
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,280
Yeah. Yeah.

519
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,520
It's 1960.

520
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:41,000
I don't know. What do we what do we want to get done here?

521
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,520
I like it because it's our ticket to as part of our team.

522
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:48,200
I think, though, my feeling about it, I had come across this a little while ago,

523
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,760
is that before you even talk about what we're going to do,

524
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,840
it is like, how is how are we going to win? OK.

525
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:59,400
So Disneyland, there is there is a history of campaigns at Disneyland.

526
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:02,000
And I don't know if you guys are aware of this.

527
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,480
But in 1976, a famous character ran for president.

528
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,520
And you're both looking at me.

529
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,960
I think I might know, you know, what I'm talking about.

530
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,440
Yes, I know. You do.

531
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,800
Yeah. Was it can I guess? Yes.

532
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,360
Go. Was it Dumbo?

533
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,480
It was not Dumbo. Why is that in my head?

534
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,920
Pooh Bear. Jason is correct.

535
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,320
It is Winnie the Pooh.

536
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:28,200
All right. And it was Winnie the Pooh for president. Fresh off of Watergate.

537
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,120
It was 72 and 76.

538
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,880
So during the during the American needed hope.

539
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:36,120
And it was a we are Winnie the Pooh for president.

540
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:39,040
And it was a whole thing that they did at Disneyland.

541
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,200
It was a campaign.

542
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,240
Let me show you some pictures, Scott here.

543
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,520
Winnie the Pooh for president.

544
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:47,840
Oh, and it's that old Winnie the Pooh with big instead of a honey pot.

545
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,480
He's got a wit.

546
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,200
Is that right? Is it a honey pot or is an Uncle Sam?

547
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,320
It's an Uncle Sam hat. All right. Good for him.

548
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,120
So, yeah, there were free showings of Pooh cartoons,

549
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,880
Main Street, Tigger Tape Parade,

550
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,280
Pooh Liddle, Kohl Fundraising Rally.

551
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,560
All children are invited to meet in front of it's a small world

552
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:08,680
to join in a special parade so children could come and participate

553
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,160
in the political process.

554
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:13,680
Who actually got more electoral college votes than George McGovern?

555
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:17,280
That's true. Pooh vastly more popular than George.

556
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:22,840
After after McGovern's first VP was found out to be getting a lecture

557
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,480
shock treatment. Sure.

558
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,400
Pooh picked up some more support.

559
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,880
Here's Winnie the Pooh for president, a honey of a candidate, it says.

560
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:33,400
Wow. There's a whole there's all this propaganda.

561
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,560
He has a little book here. Oh, boy.

562
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:40,240
I don't know. I couldn't find why they decided that this was the character

563
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,360
that should run for president.

564
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,880
There's other characters I feel like might make a little more sense.

565
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,920
He's a populist. He's simple.

566
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,400
He doesn't overthink. Yes.

567
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,080
All these big highfalutin government ideas.

568
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:54,360
So I was thinking like, look, this is like, let's let's, you know,

569
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:57,000
Jason likes naps. Jason likes treats.

570
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,680
This is what Pooh likes. Yeah.

571
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:02,600
So we have a you're saying we have a model of the kind of campaign.

572
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,800
We have a template for what works at Disneyland.

573
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:10,680
Now, I also found I don't know if you've seen this, Jason, I found the song.

574
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,920
Oh, whose president presidency song.

575
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,800
Very good. This is exciting research.

576
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,080
This is called Pooh for president.

577
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:22,280
And we'll see how much I play on this.

578
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:27,280
It's by Bob Dylan. It's by a man named Larry Gross.

579
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,960
And I'll play the whole thing.

580
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:52,960
I'll play the whole thing. Let's see what we do.

581
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:12,120
Thank you. Thank you.

582
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:16,040
If I'm elected, I make a promise to all you girls and boys.

583
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:20,440
I'll do away with taxis on bicycles and toys.

584
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,560
A bit of honey in every pot will be my golden rule.

585
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:29,560
And each of you will have a snack when you come home from school.

586
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:32,960
Pooh for president. Pooh for president.

587
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:33,960
I really have to change.

588
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,960
Pooh for president.

589
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,960
Who is right for you?

590
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:41,960
The people's choice to bear for you all the way with WT.

591
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:45,960
Pooh for president. Pooh for president.

592
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:50,960
Christopher Robin is the head advisor on my team.

593
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,960
My running mate is Piglet, a big, great distinct.

594
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,960
My cabinet is composed of Howell, Dior, and Tigger, too.

595
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:03,960
My chief of staff is Canglin and her assistant, Rue.

596
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:04,960
Thank you, Pooh.

597
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,960
Now let me say you folks must make the choice

598
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:11,960
of who is in the country's heart, who has the people's voice.

599
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:15,960
And while the words of elephants and donkeys fill the air,

600
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:20,960
perhaps you'll find that now's the time to vote for Pooh the Bear.

601
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,960
Pooh for president. Pooh for president.

602
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,960
Oh, man. I was scared.

603
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,960
I was like, I bet one verse in chorus will do it.

604
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,960
I didn't know some weird wrong Pooh was going to come in.

605
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:37,960
Well, I guess it was Sterling Holloway Dead at this point.

606
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,960
And it wasn't yet Jim Cummings doing the Pooh.

607
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:40,960
We could look that up.

608
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:47,960
It's a shame Canglin and Rue went to jail for so long for money laundering on that campaign.

609
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:52,960
But I mean, they did find the rest of the campaign did not realize it was going on.

610
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,960
Tigger knew nothing.

611
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,960
Yeah, that's at least how a judge ruled.

612
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:01,960
I think it's interesting that we forget he is the honorable Winnie the Pooh,

613
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:07,960
which is an honorific, meaning he has served in some sort of diplomatic role

614
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:11,960
or judgeship or elected official in the Hundred Acre Woods probably.

615
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:14,960
Oh, yeah. He was the comptroller.

616
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,960
They can make up whatever laws they want there.

617
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,960
Here, I'm going to put this on the Twitter.

618
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,960
But these are all the newsreel footage of Pooh and the Pooh for president.

619
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,960
Wow. Pooh in 72. Win with Winnie, it says.

620
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:29,960
Yeah. He's in the fire truck in a parade.

621
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,960
The little boy was excited.

622
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,960
Again, America was really re-booted.

623
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:37,960
Oh, I'm OK. Not OK.

624
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,960
Oh, yeah. And look at this piglet.

625
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:47,960
You we all gasped because there was a shot of Kanga and then Rue popped out of her like an alien.

626
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:51,960
Oh, a little hole opened up. That was very frightening.

627
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:58,960
I think this was good for morale after Vietnam and Watergate.

628
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,960
Like this was this is during 72. It's in progress.

629
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,960
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Right.

630
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:09,960
So there's a whole there's Eeyore and Tigger on one of those like what do you call that rail?

631
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,960
One of those rail things where one person pushes.

632
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:16,960
Yeah. So we're in a dark time in American politics and Disney turned it around.

633
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:24,960
Obviously, Disneyland has only things to gain from bringing the political process in the parks today.

634
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,960
Yeah, I'm sure that will be very smooth.

635
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:32,960
That song reminded me a lot of the It Don't Worry Me song from the movie Nashville.

636
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,960
Sure. Yeah, there's a vibe to that.

637
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:40,960
Yeah. So I think that like we just take some of that like Poo was saying, like he'll make sure everyone has a snack.

638
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,960
Snack after school. Yeah, absolutely.

639
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,960
You have to tie yourself over for dinner.

640
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:50,960
I think a lot of the things are good for your metabolism to like eat smaller portions throughout the day.

641
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:55,960
That's a good point. So, yeah, I think that's going to be a big part of your mayoral candidacy.

642
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:59,960
Should we get into the food planks of my platform?

643
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,960
Because I have. Oh, sure. Yeah. Numerous.

644
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:04,960
Winnie's led the way. So, absolutely.

645
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:09,960
Well, Mike, you and I were down recently checking on the parks.

646
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,960
We were checking in on the parks. That's what we call it.

647
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:13,960
Shaking hands, kissing babies.

648
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:16,960
Doing a diplomatic tour. Yeah.

649
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,960
We did meet a very nice listener on Main Street. That was very nice.

650
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:21,960
A constituent.

651
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:30,960
Yeah. And I have to say the thing that really tickled me when we were down that day was a limited time offering at the corn dog castle.

652
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:46,960
It is a triple kind of creation with a Cajun dog, like a Cajun link and then a block of melted pepper jack cheese and then a mini hot link on top of that.

653
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,960
And this was just dynamite.

654
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:53,960
I think first thing we got to make that a permanent venue item at the corn.

655
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,960
What is it called?

656
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:58,960
Oh, man. Look it up. Look it up.

657
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,960
It's part of the call to Jason dog.

658
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,960
Jason special. The mayor dog.

659
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:07,960
Very interesting. Like ghost pepper, blackberry sauce.

660
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,960
That I was less hot on. I like this.

661
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:10,960
You're number one.

662
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:15,960
This is your number one thing in your campaign is to make this special corn dog available.

663
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:21,960
But you need to start. That's all well and good. But, you know, that felt to me like a casual request.

664
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:28,960
And I think you have to start presenting these things like this will this corn dog must be served all year round.

665
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,960
Yeah, you're right. Special is good enough to promote.

666
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:35,960
And this is why you guys are my campaign advisors.

667
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:39,960
This little nudges. The message is there. It's just the getting the delivery.

668
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,960
Sure. You have to shape a can.

669
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:45,960
It's called you'll find it just as incredible spicy corn dog.

670
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,960
Yes, it was very good.

671
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:55,960
Secondly, we need to redo that recently opened a Bobbable Snowman ice cream window.

672
00:33:55,960 --> 00:34:02,960
Oh, lemon soft serve just will not do far too tart for me.

673
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,960
You started eating it and you were an unpleasant fate.

674
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,960
Your face was very you did not care for how tart it was.

675
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:15,960
I did not care for I also did not care that it was promised a white chocolate on top.

676
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:19,960
I was expecting a full hard dip and it was merely a drizzle.

677
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,960
It was a drizzle of white chocolate on this tart.

678
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:26,960
Yeah. And you were expecting like like a shell like the magic Hershey's magic show.

679
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,960
Like a magic show or the dip cones in a car's land.

680
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:34,960
I think this ice cream window should just be a selection of dips.

681
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:38,960
I think we should just stick to a basic ice creams.

682
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:43,960
We should have a bevy of dips. Mike, I know you talked fondly of the cherry dip.

683
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:46,960
That's only available as far as I know in Schaumburg.

684
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,960
I mean, it's probably available other places, but it's not available at nearby Dairy Queens.

685
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:54,960
Regional Dairy Queens. It's only grandfathered into old Dairy Queens.

686
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:59,960
We need to find local innovations throughout this country and bring them into the parks.

687
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:03,960
Bring the best of what this country has to offer, because that's what happens in the park.

688
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,960
It's a melting pot of people from all across the world.

689
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,960
And it should be a melting pot of ideas. I agree.

690
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:13,960
Yeah. Let's pivot now to transportation. Oh, go ahead.

691
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:16,960
Infrastructure one. And I think this is a given.

692
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:21,960
We need to start running the Mark Twain Riverboat at night.

693
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:26,960
We need to get those fantastic performers off and then get that boat back to the docks.

694
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:32,960
So guests may enjoy it in the darkened evening.

695
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:36,960
Mayor Jason's Midnight Ride. It could be a good place to...

696
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:40,960
It's where your fireside chats will take place.

697
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:45,960
It's your Teddy Roosevelt's lounge.

698
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:53,960
A place to meet and greet and hear people's tales, complaints, or just share stories and a good laugh and a good cigar smoke.

699
00:35:53,960 --> 00:36:00,960
Absolutely. Similarly for my constituents in California Adventure, we need to re-route the Paint the Night Parade.

700
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:04,960
So that trolley is never interrupted service.

701
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:11,960
How? How do we allow 20 to 30 minute increments of trolley downtime?

702
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:15,960
Unbelievable. More trolley. More trolley.

703
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:21,960
Similarly, let's let the main street vehicles always run.

704
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:25,960
We need to do something. Why do they stop running? During parades? During?

705
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,960
Sure. That doesn't...

706
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:30,960
During the fireworks shows. During the fireworks shows.

707
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,960
You might be mad with power.

708
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,960
Well, we can open to suggestions.

709
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:40,960
Well, perhaps we could get rid of whatever parade, the Pixar Play Parade that's happening now,

710
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:44,960
and it's just a parade of main street vehicles every 20 minutes.

711
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,960
I mean, that could be something. Just the cars driving down the street.

712
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,960
Maybe. Everyone waves.

713
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:52,960
Maybe you're onto something. Maybe it's a mirror.

714
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:57,960
Maybe the main street vehicles, they run in the morning as the park is opening.

715
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:04,960
Maybe the last hour of the day, as crowds have thinned a bit, they run again for one last ride at night.

716
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:09,960
Alright. Well, Mr. Mayor, if that's what you feel about it, I trust your judgment on this.

717
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:16,960
I for one think it's brave that all of your issues are minor and transportation based,

718
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:21,960
and are not ideas for exciting new rides or experiences for children.

719
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:25,960
I think it's brave for a candidate to run on nitpick and nitpick alone.

720
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,960
I've got more.

721
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:28,960
Go ahead.

722
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:37,960
Well, we enjoyed using the MaxPass app on our phones.

723
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:40,960
That was the first time I had tried it. I enjoyed it.

724
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:44,960
But I have to say, I found it a little confusing initially,

725
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:49,960
and when we walked into some ride entrances, I could hear others having some difficulty

726
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,960
navigating the app.

727
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,960
How do we fix that?

728
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:57,960
I think a basic infographic slideshow within the app of saying,

729
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:04,960
here is what this is, here is how it works, here are some examples, would go a long way.

730
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:10,960
What about a MaxPass information center in somewhere like the Main Street Cinema,

731
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:15,960
which nobody goes into, where they just play the old Mickey cartoons all day.

732
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:19,960
Why have that going when you could educate people?

733
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:23,960
Maybe if you get the MaxPass, you have to do a quick stop and watch a big,

734
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,960
it could be a fun video, we could all make the video.

735
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:28,960
It'll be a great place to get your face out there.

736
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:29,960
I'm open to that.

737
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:32,960
Look, I still want those old cartoons playing,

738
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,960
but I'm sure we could sacrifice one of the screens.

739
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:35,960
Well, they're silent anyway.

740
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:42,960
Yes, just one screen becomes an informational video about how to get the MaxFun out of your MaxPass.

741
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,960
I disagree.

742
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,960
Well, we're not always going to see eye to eye.

743
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,960
It's going to be a good video though.

744
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:56,960
When we're writing the fun jokes explaining the ins and outs of ride booking systems,

745
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,960
it'll be as funny as this podcast.

746
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:03,960
I love the ins and outs of ride booking system, so that will be fun.

747
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:04,960
Sure.

748
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,960
Mr. Mayor, do you have more?

749
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:11,960
Also, I wish there was a limited time fried bologna sandwich at one of the restaurants.

750
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:12,960
Wait, what?

751
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,960
I should have put that at more restaurants because that sounds like an interesting novelty.

752
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,960
Has that ever been at one of those parks?

753
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:18,960
It's right now.

754
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:23,960
It's the Up themed Carl's sandwich is at the Cardassian Cafe.

755
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,960
Wow, there's a fried bologna sandwich.

756
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:29,960
I'll be honest, Mr. Mayor, in all candor, that seems disgusting.

757
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,960
Fried bologna to me seems gross.

758
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:35,960
I think that's a fine little nugget of Americana.

759
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:40,960
Is this a menu item that the old cranky man in Up would want to eat?

760
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,960
I believe that's themed to it.

761
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:48,960
If we get more on that list, is it just adding menu items that the cranky old man from Up would enjoy?

762
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:53,960
In fact, now that I think about it, all of these things, the cranky old man from Up would want.

763
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:54,960
He wants more cars running.

764
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,960
He wants a boat working at night.

765
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:03,960
He sounds like a very wise old man, and I think maybe we should look into bringing him onto the campaign.

766
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,960
He doesn't want any brat kids around.

767
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:06,960
Yeah.

768
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:07,960
No.

769
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:14,960
Anyway, just some current working things going on in the policy office.

770
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:20,960
Is there a good roller coaster you'd want to put in or just bologna is the primary?

771
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,960
Oh, I mean, we've got to do something about that Matterhorn.

772
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:26,960
We've got to pull some engineers or something.

773
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,960
We've got to smooth that track.

774
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:35,960
Just because it's a mountain doesn't mean I want to feel like I fell down the mountain when I ride it.

775
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:39,960
Like you had a back crippling injury and you fell off the mountain every time.

776
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:40,960
Yeah.

777
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,960
Yeah.

778
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:47,960
Back pain concerns, also something that Carl from Up would be.

779
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:50,960
There's a lot of parallels here.

780
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,960
I'll say this.

781
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:57,960
I'll take back the Poo presidency and the Poo campaign.

782
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:01,960
I think it's a little bit too young skewing and too hip.

783
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,960
We really maybe need to retool.

784
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:07,960
We need to focus like what Carl would have done, how Carl would have run a campaign.

785
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:11,960
The Poo thing, I think, is too youthful, I think.

786
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:12,960
Yeah. All right.

787
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,960
Well, then where that means we're in line with Jason's desires.

788
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:18,960
Is there going to be a minimum voting age?

789
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:22,960
Children don't get to vote for the mayor of Disneyland?

790
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,960
I feel like children should have their say.

791
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:33,960
If you want this agenda and if you end up with some kid pandering candidate like Poo against you.

792
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,960
Well, this may already have been decided.

793
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:38,960
This may be long, long decided.

794
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,960
Unless we start changing the laws now.

795
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:41,960
We have to change the laws now.

796
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:45,960
Setting the laws for the first time because everything we're talking about is made up.

797
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:46,960
And I don't...

798
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:50,960
This is assuming that Disney itself has any participation in this.

799
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:53,960
Do they run the election?

800
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,960
Do we set the rule?

801
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:57,960
Because if we're the electoral committee, then we can...

802
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,960
We have free reign over this thing.

803
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:00,960
Sure. Good point.

804
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:04,960
Well, I find gerrymandering disgusting in American politics.

805
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,960
I'm open to doing it in this campaign.

806
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:07,960
Yeah.

807
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,960
For the sake of an imaginary place.

808
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,960
We need to get you in here at all costs.

809
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,960
Once you're in it, it's going to be a positive change.

810
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,960
But look, I'm willing to play dirty.

811
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:16,960
Sure.

812
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:17,960
So yeah, kids...

813
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:18,960
We know what people need.

814
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,960
We'll have kids vote a couple of times.

815
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:21,960
Let's be honest.

816
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,960
We don't care.

817
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:24,960
This is going to happen.

818
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,960
They call it rat fucking in American politics.

819
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:30,960
We're going to call it mouse fucking.

820
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:31,960
Mouse helping.

821
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,960
Mouse helping.

822
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:37,960
And remember, hashtag Jason4DLR.

823
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:43,960
If you want to help get out the vote, help raise awareness for this man.

824
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:47,960
Undoubtedly are more on board now than ever before.

825
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:52,960
Once you hear some of the other ideas, I think most people out there are going to be very excited about the different...

826
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:53,960
Super.

827
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:57,960
The trolleys and the little cars and the baloney.

828
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:02,960
A lot of big possibilities, but that's not today's topic astoundingly.

829
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:03,960
Yeah.

830
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:09,960
Today's topic is one that cannot be easily segued into from any of what we were just saying.

831
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,960
It's men in black alien attack.

832
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:12,960
Yeah.

833
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,960
Is it a different park?

834
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:23,960
It's not about mayors and there's no old grouches in it because Tommy Lee Jones is not in the ride.

835
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:26,960
There's like an old weirdo, but he might not be as much of a grouch.

836
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,960
Ripped horn, I assume you mean.

837
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:29,960
I do, I mean.

838
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:31,960
And no, yeah, you wouldn't call it maybe in real life he's an old grouch.

839
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:32,960
I don't know.

840
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,960
But yeah, old weirdo is a better descriptor.

841
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:40,960
But of course, Will Smith, who is the star of the men in black films, is in the ride.

842
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:41,960
Yes.

843
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:44,960
Which is a pretty exciting fact about it.

844
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,960
I think that I was pretty impressed at that time.

845
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:51,960
I guess in the year 2000, is there any bigger film star than Will Smith?

846
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:53,960
No, that's the top of the rock.

847
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:57,960
Music star, the childish Gambino of 2000.

848
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:01,960
But in 2000, it was Big Willie style.

849
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:03,960
Also had a lot of different names.

850
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:05,960
The Willenium was upon us.

851
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:08,960
The Willenium had just occurred.

852
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:09,960
There you go.

853
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:10,960
That's how it ties in.

854
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,960
On April 14th, 2000.

855
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,960
The Willenium began.

856
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,960
Yeah, the Willenium began.

857
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,960
Men in Black Alien Attack.

858
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:25,960
The basics of this ride, if you've not been down there and been on it, it is an arcade style shooting game.

859
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:31,960
That came after Buzz Lightyear's Astro Blasters, but before Toy Story Midway Mania.

860
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:39,960
It is different from those rides in that the targets are not explicitly labeled and spelled out.

861
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:43,960
But obviously the targets are aliens who have run amok in New York City.

862
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:47,960
I listened to the Season Pass podcast.

863
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:49,960
Shout out Doug Barnes.

864
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:55,960
He interviewed, now I don't know the name, but I think a couple of people involved in the creation of this ride.

865
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:59,960
I think they were proud of the fact that it's not like a bunch of Xs.

866
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:03,960
It doesn't hold your hand through it like Buzz Lightyear does.

867
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:06,960
Here it's like literal targets.

868
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:11,960
Yeah, and it was kind of a specific decision on their part because they didn't want to...

869
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:19,960
They felt like they did a test ride of Buzz Lightyear and they thought, well you're just staring at Xs and you're not taking in any of the rest of what's going on.

870
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:26,960
Instead it's these incredibly well made alien figures who all have a lot of personality.

871
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:30,960
Usually aiming at their eyes or something glowing on them.

872
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:34,960
Yeah, I think the targets are mainly in the eyes or just in the face.

873
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:36,960
Shoot them in the face.

874
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,960
Yeah, I am a fan.

875
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:41,960
I really always enjoyed this ride.

876
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:51,960
And I got to say, especially compared to the Florida Buzz Lightyear, I think this is a much better execution of that sort of arcade ride.

877
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:54,960
And I think it's more fun.

878
00:45:54,960 --> 00:46:01,960
This is also a 2001 Thea Award winner for achievement in theme design.

879
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:02,960
Well deserved.

880
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:11,960
So we were talking about MaxPass and my memories of this ride involved...

881
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:16,960
So Universal Express is the equivalent at Universal to FastPass.

882
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:24,960
And I can't remember when exactly that launched, but I first would have used it in 2002, 2003.

883
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:32,960
And it was striking how much more ad hoc it was than FastPass ever was.

884
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:39,960
Because a lot of those older rides were not really retrofitted for Universal Express.

885
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:45,960
They just stuck up a handful of Universal Express logos and sent you in the exit.

886
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:51,960
Which from my memory led to occasional dirty looks from people.

887
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:56,960
Because they thought you were just coming in the exit and cutting the line.

888
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:01,960
So the other thing was they weren't super good about telling people what it was.

889
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:06,960
I feel like there's a learning curve with how to use FastPass, but they're pretty clear about this is a thing.

890
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:08,960
Now they've kind of smoothed this over.

891
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:18,960
When I first went down with my family and we stayed at the hotel, we figured it out pretty quickly, but we were a little confused.

892
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:21,960
So you just show your room key at the gate and that was literally it.

893
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:25,960
You would just walk up to the ride, show your room key, and pretty much walk on the ride.

894
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:30,960
You're staying at the hotels, you get the Universal Express name.

895
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:33,960
You get it for free at some of the hotels.

896
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:40,960
At the time it was all the hotels and now they've built lower cost hotels where you don't get it included.

897
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:49,960
But we blew through rides. It really changed that kind of park.

898
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:54,960
Also, when it was busy, they would scan your ticket.

899
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:56,960
Now they just scan it all the time.

900
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:03,960
When you go into the express line, they scan it and you can't use it for a little while at that ride again.

901
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:06,960
You can go onto another ride and use it again immediately.

902
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:10,960
But at the time they were just like, yeah, whatever, come on in.

903
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:11,960
They didn't care.

904
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:21,960
So the first time going down there and riding this black ride, there was one day where my brother and I would just walk off the ride and walk right back on.

905
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:27,960
And just did it, played it five or six times because we got into like, all right, best three out of five.

906
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:30,960
Acting like you were the mayor of Universal Studios.

907
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:31,960
Pretty much.

908
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:32,960
You're run of the place.

909
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:36,960
So you have an affection for this because you had a real fun like six in a row.

910
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:38,960
Yes. Yeah.

911
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:46,960
And then eventually when I went back a few years later, they sent us at the front desk, they're like, oh, you don't show your room key anymore.

912
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:53,960
And you had to get a separate card with like a crappy version of your picture on it.

913
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:54,960
And that was your express pass.

914
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:58,960
And then I went back last year and they're like, oh, yeah, you just show your room key.

915
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:04,960
And I'm like, I guess they decided that was dumb to make people carry so many tiny pieces of paper on them.

916
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:06,960
You've learned their own mistake.

917
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:12,960
You've made a mistake, a full oral history of the Universal Express Pass in this podcast.

918
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:13,960
Yeah.

919
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:18,960
But I think like especially if you're even if you're just going to Universal for a day, you're going at a high crowd time.

920
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:22,960
You can buy a la carte like you can buy a day Universal Express Pass.

921
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:29,960
And it's a little bit of money, but like you can it definitely makes for much more leisurely day.

922
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:33,960
Well, this has ruined the eventual all Universal Express episode.

923
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:36,960
Now I know we're going too much into the details.

924
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:42,960
OK, so but the reason I bring this up is I thought it was good to just to say that you went on and over and over.

925
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:44,960
There's another reason you're talking about Universal Express.

926
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:45,960
Yes.

927
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:46,960
OK.

928
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:59,960
But talking about like older rides not taking it into account, this one is confusing to me because this was built around the time or shortly before they introduced Universal Express.

929
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:07,960
And the express line of this ride skips a significant portion of the queue.

930
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:08,960
Oh, well, yeah.

931
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:12,960
That's happened to some people want to happen, though.

932
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:16,960
But that happens to a lot of rides now, too, don't you think like the Avatar ride?

933
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:17,960
That's the case.

934
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:20,960
And it's also the case sort of with the Guardians ride with the fast passes.

935
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,960
You kind of skip the cool lines.

936
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:23,960
The trade off.

937
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:24,960
This is a trade off.

938
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:26,960
You know, it's got to cut through somewhere.

939
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:28,960
You got to take it out somewhere.

940
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:31,960
So it's got to bypass some of the cool stuff.

941
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:35,960
I think honestly, as you're saying this, I was watching the ride video.

942
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:38,960
I think we for sure cut the ride last time I was on it.

943
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:40,960
I don't think I've ever been in that cool part of the line.

944
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:42,960
I missed all the cool stuff.

945
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:43,960
You haven't seen the universe in you.

946
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:44,960
Right.

947
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:45,960
I missed the cool stuff.

948
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:51,960
I mean, the story of this ride is that you were going to like a preserved thing from the World's Fair.

949
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:54,960
They call it the World Expo because I'm sure World's Fair is copyrighted.

950
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:57,960
And it's about like the universe and you.

951
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:04,960
And then the presentation gets interrupted and Rip Torn starts yelling at you like, we got to get you guys out of here.

952
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:06,960
And he's really fun.

953
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:13,960
And then you get in an elevator and you go down deep under the earth to the M.I.B. headquarters and you have been recruited.

954
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:14,960
Right. To the men in black.

955
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:15,960
Yeah, it's cool.

956
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:17,960
I mean, it's I was looking and I was like, I don't remember this.

957
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:19,960
And it's like, oh, I must have gone on the express.

958
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:21,960
I mean, because we we were staying on site.

959
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:23,960
So we were at the Hard Rock Hotel.

960
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:27,960
Sure. I knew that because I was like, well, if we pay this, we're going to get the upgrade, as you were saying.

961
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:29,960
So we got the front of the line.

962
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:31,960
Yeah, we must have skipped it because I was like, oh, this is cool.

963
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:33,960
And I we should have not.

964
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:42,960
I think the yeah, the the story that unfolds makes this thing pretty interesting in that there's a there's a couple of twists that happen.

965
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:50,960
You know, that the first one being you're in this fake World's Fair exhibit and then then you get taken into the men in black headquarters and it was all front.

966
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:55,960
And then the very similar thing that you feel like you think that you're going on a training mission.

967
00:51:55,960 --> 00:52:00,960
Yeah, you're going to fire it kind of flimsy wooden targets like a firing range.

968
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:05,960
It's in the men in black film and then you round a corner and now you're on the street and it's real aliens.

969
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:09,960
Yes, you were immediately put in a live fire war zone.

970
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:14,960
Yes, and it's a training to a live fire battle in the center of New York.

971
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:16,960
Yes, it's very cool. But yeah, you're right.

972
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:22,960
Now, the line is like it is one of the better lines of Universal, if not the best line.

973
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:24,960
Yeah, that's a good. I think so. Yeah.

974
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:30,960
I mean, the building, it looks great. The building is fun looking and they have the old World's Fair like towery things in front.

975
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:37,960
And to look at what that was called, it's the Astro towers and their actual those are still up right in Flushing Meadows.

976
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:41,960
Those are still stand remnants from the sixty four World's Fair.

977
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:44,960
It's like ET is a pretty good fun line because it's sort of just the forest.

978
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:47,960
There's not like too many twists.

979
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:51,960
Simpsons is fine. There's some fun stuff in there. But yeah, this is probably like the best universal.

980
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:55,960
Yeah, this is the worms like that's the other thing you bypass the break room with the worms.

981
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:58,960
I know you got the worms drinking the coffee. That's really fun.

982
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:03,960
You got the control room, which is of course from that is it the scene of Men in Black 2 when Michael Jackson does his cameo.

983
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:05,960
Man. Oh, man.

984
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:07,960
Did I spoil something you were going to talk about later?

985
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:10,960
No, I had no I was just I just wanted it to come up. Of course.

986
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:13,960
It's just one of the oddest and you missed Men in Black 2.

987
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:20,960
What a bizarre scene. My memory of that or maybe I read a story about it was that Michael asked if he was going to be on the

988
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:28,960
poster. He knew his 45 second cameo or less in the film that he wanted to know.

989
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:30,960
Oh, that's so good.

990
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:33,960
Hurray. Michael would have ruined the cameo.

991
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:40,960
Right. Sure. Of course. But I don't think he was even thinking in regards to it being a small now he is on.

992
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:48,960
OK, so to contextualize the first Men in Black sets up the premise that aliens are among us and disguised as human beings and some of our

993
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:52,960
otter celebrities or more prominent celebrities are aliens in disguise.

994
00:53:52,960 --> 00:54:01,960
Right. And they heightened this in the sequel by actually including the real Michael Jackson, who has done some mission and then stays on the

995
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:04,960
line with ripped torn and asked to be part of Men in Black.

996
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:10,960
Right. And with the indelible amazing delivery, I could be Agent M.

997
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:18,960
It's a boy. It just sits there. It's in his eye line is weird. And it's like a look that he didn't have terribly often.

998
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:25,960
It was not like an era of Michael that I recce is kind of this like short Peter Pan Pinocchio hair.

999
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:30,960
It's right around the comeback album. Yeah, it must have been right after. Yeah, because movies in 2002.

1000
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:41,960
But then there's this weird other thing that I forgot about. So you reminded me that he is on the poster of a movie called Miss Castaway.

1001
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:50,960
That is a straight video weird scam movie that's a combo parody of Miss Congeniality and Castaway.

1002
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:55,960
Oh, my God. Here it is. Yeah. Look at this, Jason. Oh, man.

1003
00:54:55,960 --> 00:55:04,960
The worst poster you've ever seen. And they included it. And he's in this film, Miss Castaway, for as long as he's in Men in Black 2.

1004
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:11,960
And you know what else? You know who he plays in it? I don't. Agent M. Whoa. He does the same thing.

1005
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:19,960
And you can look up on YouTube the weird. OK, when you watch the movie, he's green screened in somewhere.

1006
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:25,960
He's like in front of a glowing ethereal light. And then you watch the behind the scenes and they filmed him in his fucking library.

1007
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:34,960
Of course. In front of a bunch of books. And if anybody listening has ever dealt with green screen or like comping, like cutting people out and rotoscoping,

1008
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:41,960
at least do like a blank white wall like what's behind you, Mike. Don't. Yeah, there you go. That's a shot.

1009
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:51,960
He's like a pattern. If you're going to put somebody in a different environment, like a complicated bookshelf is the worst thing they could be in front of.

1010
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:59,960
Most busy pattern humanly possible. What I'm saying is I have doubts about the filmmaking prowess of the people who made Miss Castaway.

1011
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:07,960
And you know why I know about this movie? Because when the series of books for such and such for dummies was out.

1012
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:13,960
Yeah. The book filmmaking for dummies is by the director of this. And you like.

1013
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:20,960
I think I was probably starting to make videos at the time. I'm curious. And I started to feel like this book is bullshit. What has this guy done?

1014
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:28,960
Miss Castaway, who's in it? Michael Jackson. What the shit? And then it became you did like it because Michael was in it.

1015
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:35,960
Now I'm on board with the writer and Miss Castaway. I found a picture of Michael and Barry Sonnenfeld where he was shooting.

1016
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:41,960
So he was not in his library. What's this hair when I when you like had that angled and you hadn't spun it towards us yet?

1017
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:45,960
I thought that was like a picture of young Paul McCartney in a black suit.

1018
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:50,960
Because he's in the black. Is he in the men in black suit in the cameo? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1019
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:57,960
But he's not officially a man in black. Right. Oh, what an unflattering angle. And his eye line is weird. Yeah.

1020
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:08,960
The hair is very said. He looks like the agent and with the hurry up and fix it. Hooter, the line delivery is he did not get better since Captain.

1021
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:17,960
Also by J.K. would would he have been immediately the next agent after Laura Flynn Boyle was recruiting the first movie?

1022
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:21,960
That's a good question. Yeah, because they would go down to just using. No, I'm sorry.

1023
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:27,960
Laura Flynn Boyle was the villain Serlina in number two. Oh, yeah. I'm sorry. Linda Fiorentino.

1024
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:33,960
Oh, yeah. Was age. Was she named Agent L? Was her character also not quite sure.

1025
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:37,960
But she was. Yeah. What happened to Linda Fiorentino? Not even referenced.

1026
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:42,960
I don't think in the I think in the second one, there's reference to it for her or something.

1027
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:49,960
Yeah. And he was in and Will Smith's in a run of like de-neuralizing his partners.

1028
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:54,960
And in the beginning, he's paired with Patrick Warburton, Disney Parks, all star Patrick Warburton.

1029
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:59,960
He de-neuralized and eventually they've got to get they have to bring back after restore Tommy Lee Jones memory.

1030
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:05,960
And that's the plot of Men in Black 2. Another thing I like about Men in Black 2 is the song Nod Your Head.

1031
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:10,960
Oh, my God. I thought this was going to be a hot take. I love Nod Your Head.

1032
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:17,960
I wrote down I like Nod Your Head's better. More. Nod Your Head. It's singular. Nod Your Head. Black Seat's coming.

1033
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:23,960
Say it right. Say Nod Your Head. Nod Your Head. Parenthetical. Black Suit's coming.

1034
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:29,960
I like that more than Men in Black. Why? That's crazy. No. That is a hot take.

1035
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:35,960
Oh, I thought you were on board for this. OK. I mean, I like. I'm curious why.

1036
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:40,960
Black Suit's coming parentheses Nod Your Head is the full title. Oh, excuse me. It's the other way.

1037
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:47,960
It's the full title featuring Trey Knox. Of course, I appreciate that.

1038
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:51,960
I appreciate that song as well. But Men in Black is a better song. Men in Black is fun.

1039
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:57,960
But Nod Your Head is really fun. The music video involves him zooming around on a crazy flying platform.

1040
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:03,960
And I'm assuming that CGI is not held up. None of Men in Black 2's CGI is. Yeah.

1041
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:12,960
Although neither has the to be fair and equal, neither has the alien who ends up vamping with Will in the original Men in Black.

1042
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:18,960
Oh, oh, oh, oh. Because he doesn't dance. Let me see you just slide with me.

1043
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:23,960
I think Men in Black was like that's a you know, that's that was a many a middle school dance.

1044
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:30,960
Yeah, sure. What I think is weird, I like that you like it, though, because like I just don't I feel like when it came out,

1045
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:34,960
it was like this one's not going to take nobody is going to Men in Black.

1046
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:38,960
Oddly, didn't with the little dance, it didn't feel as much just like a blatant ad for the movie.

1047
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:47,960
Like a spiritual heir to Ghostbusters, the song. But Nod Your Head, Black Suits Coming was just and in the wake of Wild Wild West,

1048
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:51,960
like now the pattern has been established of these blatant ad songs.

1049
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:56,960
And Wild Wild West, I think is better than Black Nod Your Head, Black Suits Coming. I would agree.

1050
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:00,960
Or Black Suits Coming, parentheses, Nod Your Head.

1051
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:02,960
That what I might agree with that.

1052
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:05,960
So you like Wild Wild West, the ball of them. I like all of these.

1053
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:08,960
You're on board with all of these. Do you like Wild Wild West the best?

1054
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:16,960
Do you like, well, then what of his singles then? What do you think is the best? Miami or Jiggy? Jiggy with It or what was the other?

1055
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:23,960
Oh, I you know, in middle school, I liked Will Smith so much that my AOL screen name was G Jiggy One.

1056
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:25,960
Oh, wow, really?

1057
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:31,960
G apparently standing for getting it was short. Oh, getting jiggy.

1058
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:35,960
I was the number one at it. Man, I recall what I was like in middle school.

1059
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:39,960
And I can tell you, I was not to the least bit jiggy. If you can believe it.

1060
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:45,960
I think that's interesting because you always seem like you were a much like hip or kid in regards to music you liked and some other stuff.

1061
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:52,960
Like I may have like turned your nose up at me and my like my Matchbox 20 or my oh, maybe.

1062
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:56,960
Well, I felt snobby, but I had this weird in middle school only.

1063
01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:05,960
I felt a lot of pressure to like contemporary music and the contemporary music I chose was the hip hop at the time, some of which I would stand by.

1064
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:08,960
I'm still very fond of Busta Rhymes. Sure.

1065
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:11,960
But the Will Smith music is largely not so good.

1066
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:20,960
And I was also really down with the bad boy camp with the puff daddy and actually thinking about the song men in black again.

1067
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:25,960
And maybe this is points against it and for black suits come and nod your head.

1068
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:33,960
It is just such a lazy nod your head. My opinion's been backed up.

1069
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:38,960
The real lazy with those samples, he really did.

1070
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:47,960
I made a video a long time ago about how you just like like it's your it's your favorite disco songs, almost unaffected with him rapping about a movie over it.

1071
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:53,960
And it ran now. I sense have gotten pretty into Patrice Russian, the maker of the original song.

1072
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:58,960
Forget me nots. And it's pretty bullshit. It's the same melody. It's the same groove.

1073
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:01,960
He did almost nothing to it except rap about a movie he was in over it.

1074
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:05,960
I remember my parents being like, like, this is the song.

1075
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:08,960
This is another song. And I remember them like they don't get it. Yeah, me too.

1076
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:12,960
And then I was like, I'm older. I'm like, yeah, it is. It's like the same song. Really?

1077
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:16,960
I mean, it's more like a like he's covering it, but he changed the lyrics.

1078
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:25,960
I'm all for the idea of the old man sampling view, obviously, is insanity because something like Paul's boutique is this rich tapestry of samples.

1079
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:29,960
But then like I am absolutely in my dad's camp now.

1080
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:33,960
If like this is the I'll be missing you. It's just every breath you take.

1081
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:39,960
Yeah. Well, I'm I ultimately don't care because all those people made a lot of money on these songs.

1082
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:42,960
If it put money in Patrice Russian's pocket, that's why.

1083
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:46,960
Yeah. And like I like it. So like I'm not like I'm not upset by it.

1084
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:50,960
But as I as I'm older and I've heard now the original songs, I'm like, this is just the song.

1085
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:52,960
This is what happened to me in middle school is I end.

1086
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:56,960
I liked all this rap that I sense have realized, oh, my God, every single one of them.

1087
01:02:56,960 --> 01:03:02,960
I just liked the sample. What I really was liking was 70s, 80s funk and R&B. Oh, that's interesting.

1088
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:06,960
Yeah. I gave all the credit. Something I don't even remember what crappy rap song sampled.

1089
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:08,960
Never too much by Luther Vandross.

1090
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:12,960
But I was like, this is a dope song. And then like, no, they didn't do anything.

1091
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:19,960
They just laid that. What's I think Mo Money Mo Problems is a kind of builds on the original.

1092
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:22,960
I forget what the original sound that it's I'm coming out.

1093
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:26,960
But again, a lot of the hookiness of it is a yes.

1094
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:28,960
A lot of it's taken from that. Yeah.

1095
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:32,960
There's a little Smith. I'm sorry. The Wild Wild West is real bullshit.

1096
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:38,960
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. But again, Stevie got paid. So sure.

1097
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:42,960
Oh, and he performed at the MTV Awards. Of course.

1098
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:46,960
But he changed the words he sang. We go. It's great.

1099
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:53,960
Yeah. The one that made my dad the most mad of all of these was Come With Me.

1100
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:56,960
Yeah. From the God. I like that song too.

1101
01:03:56,960 --> 01:04:03,960
I did at the time. I loved it. And I actually toured studio. I toured NBC and toured Studio 8H.

1102
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:06,960
Whereas SNL is done right right after that happened.

1103
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:09,960
I was there literally the summer after the episode where he performed that.

1104
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:15,960
And in my head, even though I was an SNL nerd and a comedy nerd, I was partially like, wow, that's where Chevy Chase performed or whatever.

1105
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:21,960
And even more so. Wow. That's where Puff Daddy and Jimmy Page come with me.

1106
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:24,960
No song is held up worse. Yeah.

1107
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:30,960
My dad was so mad about that. I remember he was just like, this is bullshit because like there's nothing.

1108
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:34,960
And then he's like and then he was mad because Jimmy Page was doing it with him. Yeah.

1109
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:38,960
But money, paycheck. But it's gross as well.

1110
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:42,960
They don't just lend themselves out to any fly by night product.

1111
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:47,960
Only superior products like the Godzilla song and Led Zeppelin the Ride at Hard Rock Park.

1112
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:58,960
Look, I got a summer. I just realized where all the timing of this worked out. So Men in Black 2 came out summer 2002.

1113
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:01,960
Songs of the Summer for me that summer. Got to go.

1114
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:11,960
Dodger heads, black suits, white blood cells or found love with a girl by the white stripes and hard to explain by the strokes.

1115
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:14,960
All of these also together. This all three of these songs.

1116
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:22,960
They also had really fun music videos, which that was a summer that I was like this summer I'm going to lose a bunch of weight.

1117
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:25,960
So I wake up every day and do this elliptical.

1118
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:34,960
And I realized VH1 for the first few hours of the morning just showed music videos without interruption.

1119
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:41,960
And I was very excited when one of those came on because the white stripes one had the was the Lego music video.

1120
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:50,960
And then the strokes one was just a cool like montage of different like found footage and like a jet plane and stuff.

1121
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:56,960
And most innovative Will Smith rode around a flying platform.

1122
01:05:56,960 --> 01:06:00,960
I'm just picturing young Jason on an elliptical.

1123
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:02,960
Jason, it's the greatest. If you had any footage of you.

1124
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:05,960
I gave up soda too. I lost a bunch of weight.

1125
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:12,960
If only you thank God there's not footage of this because if there was footage of you, you'd be a Star Wars kid today.

1126
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:16,960
Like if there was a video elliptical, you on an elliptical to Wilson.

1127
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:22,960
No, no. I had to then get off that elliptical and go be a counselor at a theater camp.

1128
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:28,960
Like this is 2002. 2002 was white stripes. Yeah, that's correct.

1129
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:31,960
Really? Wow. Yeah.

1130
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:39,960
Yeah, I think so. That may have come out right at the end of 2001, but I may that may have been like the sink.

1131
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:41,960
The second or third single.

1132
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:43,960
This is what I was talking about earlier.

1133
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:49,960
The passage of time is so much so that I get freaked out when I hear something like that because that feels like it's only like 10 years old.

1134
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:55,960
But that's like 15. How many times have Will Smith and the white stripes been to Orlando since 2002?

1135
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:58,960
Here's why. Here's why I reacted with nod your head.

1136
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:02,960
I think Men in Black is the best of all of his Will Smith songs.

1137
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:07,960
I think it's by far the best one. I think it's the cool. I think it's the coolest one.

1138
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:14,960
I like the different parts in it and it's being well, I only have that opinion because I don't really care for the other ones.

1139
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:17,960
Well, fair enough. I'm not here sitting here listening to the greatest hits.

1140
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:23,960
I'm just saying Men in Black was always I think the best. Remember Willanium, which was another Will any.

1141
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:28,960
I like that one too. I get that confused with Robbie Williams's Millennium.

1142
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:32,960
Oh, yeah. Because he had a song called Millennium around that same time.

1143
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:34,960
That's a good song. Which is a good song. Yeah.

1144
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:40,960
I had a feeling this was going to be like this ride is great. We just kind of like the ride and there's not a ton to say about it.

1145
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:46,960
I have a feeling we're going to mostly talk about nod your head.

1146
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:54,960
2002 also Like I Love You, Justin Timberlake. Wow. Which is all happening at the same time. That still feels like a new song to me.

1147
01:07:54,960 --> 01:08:00,960
Hot in here by Nelly. Another great song. This is the rise of Pharrell around this time.

1148
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:05,960
Yes. My mom's favorite rap song Hot in Here. That's a good choice.

1149
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:14,960
At first she was like, what is this song? And then it was a year we went to Florida and it was on the radio along with whatever, like By the Way by the Red Hot Chili Peppers.

1150
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:18,960
And oh, yeah, just everywhere. She was like, this hot in here is good.

1151
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:23,960
And she was like, this is funny. My parents have never done about any rap song.

1152
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:29,960
I remember when the summer that Live in La Vida Loca came out and I was like at.

1153
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:34,960
And Jason would never be the same. You couldn't go to City Walk or Downtown Disney anywhere where they're playing current music.

1154
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:41,960
Just just nonstop live in La Vida Loca and smooth. I don't think that was the same summer.

1155
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:44,960
But no, there was a nonstop around that era. I'm sure.

1156
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:49,960
Well, smooth, the smooth left a crater for a decade or so.

1157
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:52,960
I've never quite recovered.

1158
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:57,960
Can I say something else in the periphery of men in black culture?

1159
01:08:57,960 --> 01:09:09,960
Something I discovered last night that's really something that will only hurt the mortality issue you're having, Mike, in the Men in Black cartoon show.

1160
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:13,960
It was an animated series that followed the film between one and two.

1161
01:09:13,960 --> 01:09:22,960
There is a very strange clip that you can find where the equivalent animated equivalent of Will is fighting an alien for control of a blimp.

1162
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:29,960
He gains control and has the wheel, but then looks ahead of him and the blimp is heading straight for the twin towers.

1163
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:39,960
Will Smith and agent Jay, I think, says those towers are going to be too tall anymore.

1164
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:51,960
And then he narrowly, he like barely pulls the wheel up and the blimp barely goes vertical and avoid like right alongside the twin towers and avoid.

1165
01:09:51,960 --> 01:10:00,960
And the 9-11 curse would affect Men in Black 2 as well because the finale was set originally at the twin towers and they had to change it to the Statue of Liberty.

1166
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:03,960
So now I've brought up 9-11. Wow.

1167
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:08,960
And after talking about the 9-11 songs, not yet.

1168
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:23,960
That's horrible. I mean, the most famous one of that is this the very first Spider-Man movie teaser involves him like stopping a helicopter full of criminals in a giant web between the two towers.

1169
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:31,960
Right. Yeah. Oh, how unfortunate like and right. Was that like did it even get to be released or was it so timing?

1170
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:38,960
It was released. I saw it. I remember downloading it on my computer, my gateway computer and it took forever.

1171
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:42,960
And I was so goddamn excited about Spider-Man coming finally.

1172
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:47,960
OK, so you did get to see without the horrible thing. I'm sure it's available somewhere. Right.

1173
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:49,960
All right. Well, I guess we'll go back to Men in Black.

1174
01:10:49,960 --> 01:11:03,960
Now we got to turn this thing like a blimp and go in a different direction. Hey, at least. OK, so I have a couple of hot tips. I have a couple of dark things I realized about this.

1175
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:15,960
Well, one I think is more novel. I realize if you follow the story of this ride to its conclusion, because you go in the fake universe and you then you're recruited in Men in Black.

1176
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:23,960
You do the whole thing. You blow up the giant alien bug and either you are either way you're neuralized.

1177
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:31,960
But at the end and it's I really like the I like going through the full queue so you can see the pre show.

1178
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:37,960
And then because at the very end of the ride, you pull up at another world's fair looking room and they're like, are we alone in the universe?

1179
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:43,960
Of course we are. I think that's a nice tie around. And then you walk by a door with the silhouettes of the worms.

1180
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:53,960
But I realized another thing about this ride. A bunch of this ride follows the story beats of the first Matrix.

1181
01:11:53,960 --> 01:12:00,960
You are essentially a red pill. You take the red pill and that's when you join Men in Black. Right.

1182
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:16,960
Just as Morpheus recruits Neo, then you are like pulled into his fight, you're pulled into his crew, just like you are put in a car and handed a gun, just like Neo.

1183
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:24,960
Then you have a very minimal amount of training before you are immediately forced into a live fire exercise.

1184
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:37,960
And then you destroy a big bad guy. But then the twist, the turn is that like at the end of this ride, you are essentially back above the rabbit hole.

1185
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:45,960
You essentially take the blue pill and you go back to your normal life. So this is a great this would have made a great grad school. Yeah.

1186
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:53,960
Right. Yeah. There's also a darker version. If you use the definition of red pilling about like you find out what society is really about.

1187
01:12:53,960 --> 01:13:00,960
It's like the maniacs on the internet. This would be a good 25 minute YouTube video where you're like you break it down like your personal. Yeah.

1188
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:07,960
Here's what I realized. She's a full Jordan. It's all like in the background you're like nod your head.

1189
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:10,960
And final realization, the great song of all time. Black 2 is coming.

1190
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:15,960
What you don't realize is that once you are in the Men in Black you can't unsee it.

1191
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:24,960
This is the Jordan Peterson Kermit voice. Oh God. I'm Phil. Lucky I don't know what Jordan. Yeah. I was going to say I don't know what the hell that is. Better you don't.

1192
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:28,960
You know too much about that stuff I think. That's a great theory.

1193
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:35,960
Can I can I say do you guys know about other alternate pitches for what these like wraparounds were?

1194
01:13:35,960 --> 01:13:42,960
Because the idea was always it's the the building is a front. You don't know where they're hiding that it's the Men in Black facility.

1195
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:52,960
And at the end you come out and you're somewhere else. And there was another it was originally going to be the Brooklyn Battery Building which is this big gray nondescript building where their headquarters are in the movie.

1196
01:13:52,960 --> 01:14:00,960
But it's a theme park and that's not very lively to look at. It's a big concrete wall. So then they still got to do all the placemaking and cool architecture.

1197
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:14,960
So there were weird other other things pitched were that you were at an orange you're a fat an orange factory tour. And then at the end they denuralize you and you're just you're surrounded by you know crates of oranges.

1198
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:22,960
And then another one was that you you end up back at the Orlando Airport. This thing was almost the Orlando Airport. That's very yeah.

1199
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:30,960
You were going to get on a people mover essentially. Oh really. Oh interesting. That's what I which could have been a separate ride which is kind of the fun idea.

1200
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:38,960
But I think then the thinking was is that confusing. And do you not understand this premise if you don't deeply know the movie.

1201
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:47,960
And also who knows what the Orlando Airport looks like. It's still got to be this has to be like a striking building that gets you down to the other end of the park. Right.

1202
01:14:47,960 --> 01:14:57,960
So they ended up at this this world's fair thing. But I like all those that that line of thinking is pretty fun. Yeah. I mean I like the the the look of this across the water.

1203
01:14:57,960 --> 01:15:09,960
Like I remember when this first opened I was like wow that looks really cool. Like that looks great because there wasn't like a big now I feel like there's more I mean there was a lot of fake city facades.

1204
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:21,960
That's what a lot of Universal Studios what. So this definitely added some character. Yeah. And it's that part they have the big men in black sign. But if you just look at the building you don't necessarily it doesn't say men in black on the building.

1205
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:32,960
Yeah. That's a big circular sign out front. But if you were to see it from the water I like the idea of like what is that as opposed to like it says men in black on a billboard.

1206
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:45,960
It's so true. And it's not like you know what I think is a terrible facade is the is the Transformers ride in Hollywood because it just is a big yes. It says Transformers. Yeah there's no amount of intrigue.

1207
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:59,960
Because they had the Indiana Jones ride has nothing it doesn't say Indiana Jones on the front of the temple. We don't want that. You want to maintain the realism of this. You know it's funny that when I went to Harry Potter in Hollywood for the first time we literally got on the wrong line.

1208
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:11,960
We got confused. That is confusing. Yes. Yeah. Have you experienced that too. We ended up we're in the line for the wand shop we realized. Yes. So that's weird. You have to be I love the idea of like you round a corner and you don't know where you are. But there is like a level of functionality.

1209
01:16:11,960 --> 01:16:26,960
You got to have it is a weird balance between like truly immersing the guest and like thinking like oh you're actually in the weird temple but also like we can't they can't wander. We can't just have people wandering. They have to actually there have to be markers and people and like it is a weird balance.

1210
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:39,960
I'm sure like that's a nightmare of Star Wars land right now when they're trying to figure all that logistics stuff out. Yeah. Of like what's a fully working city but also like we got to get people in and out. They have to be able to know where exits are where the actual ride is. Yeah.

1211
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:54,960
And we the our level of fan I think would love the more immersive it is and I bet the Imagineers would too. But at the end of the day there's not only you know just like regular foot but there's people don't say English and you like you do have to make these things very explicitly clear.

1212
01:16:54,960 --> 01:17:10,960
Yeah. Mom and dad don't have like a feeling they just want to be like where do I go. OK. They don't want to like find it. They don't want to be like right. Explore and find. Yeah. Didn't you propose when we had when we had Weigert here talking about the Mickey and Friends parking garage you propose that it's fun.

1213
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:26,960
The parking parking lots are confusing at City Walk. Well I said I said what I thought was fun about city walk is because I agreed with Weigert that it's confusing because there are multiple parking garages there. But I always am surprised where I come out.

1214
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:39,960
I never know. I never know. I know. We'll talk about this at a later time. So I was saying it was a fun confusion at Disney. I was at Disney. I was saying that they should just have like like Mater parked in a parking spot in the parking lot.

1215
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:44,960
In a parking spot in the parking garage and that you would want randomly like fine Mater.

1216
01:17:44,960 --> 01:18:08,960
If you didn't know where it was going to be if it was a different spot every time. Oh hey it's Mater. That's pretty fun. OK. Well other stuff about this ride. Did you guys figure out that it is the same ride vehicle as the cat in the hat ride. I read that. I thought that was interesting because they were trying to decide between the ride system of cat in the hat and Spider-Man both which had opened the previous year and they said it was too impossible.

1217
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:28,960
To like shoot straight with like the range of movement you would get with the Spider-Man kind of vehicle. Oh interesting. But the cat in the hat like that then they even I think we said they toned down the movement at that ride. So but it was I think was performing very well over at Islands of Adventure and they carted it over.

1218
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:57,960
But they also added an element that is you know in a bunch of nonsense called the fusion exhaust ports which is a fancy term for the big red point that you shoot at in during the one very cool part where you were shooting directly at another car because that's a unique feature of this ride that you are side by side a very rare thing in a dark ride and you're competing against another vehicle and there's this very fun sequence where you're you go side by side and there's a scanner and it reveals that the.

1219
01:18:57,960 --> 01:19:26,960
Other car all aliens and then you shoot at the fusion exhaust port and make it spin out. Yeah might be my favorite part of the ride. That's a fun little zone. I like that. I'm very fond. Like I said my brother and I get very competitive with this ride. I love and I'm very good at being the one who hits the red button at the end. You got to do it fat that you have to be the first in the car to get the point. Yeah you have to do it and I like am waiting for it. I'm not like hammering on it. I wait for tear rip to get the point.

1220
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:53,960
Or tear ripped towards say push the red button. So that you wouldn't right before that wouldn't do you anything but you got to be pretty on the right when he says it and if first in the car it's like 100,000 points. Yeah it's 100,000 points and it activates whatever nonsense what nonsense term. I remember typing this out because it's so long. It activates the essentially just a big explosion like yeah that side the final big alien.

1221
01:19:53,960 --> 01:20:10,960
I like there's a very fun little just a little detail but it's like you go into Central Park and there's a bunch of glowing eyes like it's bushes and then you come around the corner and in the part is this giant like it is a huge animatronic like it doesn't have a ton of range of movement.

1222
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:25,960
It's like very large. It's very I'll say this on a previous podcast Scott was talking about how he was very scared of large things. And I believe the first time I saw this I did have like the animal part of my brain went oh like too big didn't like that.

1223
01:20:25,960 --> 01:20:41,960
That's like a scary spider. That didn't bother me. It's like enough of a now look who's cool. I was an old person too but I mean I'm just saying I'm I my initial feeling like it's kind of like smoky and is it like smell a little bit.

1224
01:20:41,960 --> 01:20:55,960
It's something like a thing to go into and I was like I don't want to look like a big spider the subatomic thermal disruptor is what blows that for and then that makes your car spin a bunch. Yeah.

1225
01:20:55,960 --> 01:21:18,960
This is not a neg. Well I guess it's a negative. I think that the queue and everything and all the all the aliens are so cool. I feel like this being a shooting ride detracts from the ride. I think that like for the length they went to like theme the whole thing and make it a fake out and make it the cool like intro to it a fake out like

1226
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:31,960
you're too you get too worried about shooting and points that like it's a level of detail and immersion that you would probably appreciate more if you could let that part of your brain go where you're so focused on shooting things.

1227
01:21:31,960 --> 01:21:40,960
Sure like I feel like there's probably like if any like Indiana Jones was a shooting ride. I think it would make the ride worse.

1228
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:53,960
But like I think like like it's not it's bad. This is not I'm not saying it's bad because it's very it's very cool and it's good. But I think the shooting element as cool as it seems it's actually kind of better on Buzz Lightyear because it's a Buzz Lightyear like a smaller ride.

1229
01:21:53,960 --> 01:22:05,960
It's a kiddie ride and even on Toy Story made way mania it's like a game and it's like it's much more tailored for that. But this way like you're kind of going very slow because you have to go pretty slow to be able to shoot it stuff.

1230
01:22:05,960 --> 01:22:24,960
So like it you don't have the room for like the truly like cool thrills and like indie indie can switch up speeds you can go in and out. And I'm saying I think maybe in with even with a lot of the stuff that's already in this ride you could have like a more of an indie level ride with with all of the detail they put into this thing.

1231
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:36,960
And they drove those cars. Are they like town cars in the movie or the cat a lot of those black cars that they like have like turns into a crazy the new hotness. He says in the sequel.

1232
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:47,960
Yeah. That's right. Yeah. So like that's a tailor made for a ride vehicle. Right. It's almost like I just think like we're never unless there's a new resurgence of men in black.

1233
01:22:47,960 --> 01:23:00,960
I'm like there's even like a better men in black ride somewhere in this. And I feel like the shooting takes a little away from it. Again I like it. It's very good in the details very cool. But I think it holds you back a little bit.

1234
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:13,960
You maybe ignore how well done some of the creatures are saying and you're not you're not appreciating that it's this tentacle monster bursting out of a right out of a second story window.

1235
01:23:13,960 --> 01:23:23,960
Yeah that's true. I don't know. I think it's just a it's it's different. It's different. It's different. I have to give it credit. Mostly practical stuff mostly animatronics.

1236
01:23:23,960 --> 01:23:30,960
That's why I'm saying that that's what I'm saying. Screens come on universal learn from this. I know. Minimal screens. I think they're getting there.

1237
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:43,960
I mean there's the people that are working in whatever they're imagining is called. No. And a lot of the problem is is that that's just budget stuff. The screens are fun like the alien scanning that makes sense.

1238
01:23:43,960 --> 01:23:54,960
And even just a partial like screen because you can still kind of see the other part. I can't remember what it is. This is an unsourced thing. But there was a message board and we haven't done calling yet in Orlando.

1239
01:23:54,960 --> 01:24:05,960
But Kong in Orlando is very similar to just the tram tour version of Kong. It's just a lot of screens and then a practical Kong had it then which is cool. It's a big giant head but it's just like his head.

1240
01:24:05,960 --> 01:24:17,960
And it's like well OK. And now the ride's over. But there was a message board post of somebody who worked in creative at Universal who was just so upset because they had a version of Kong where it was a robot chasing you.

1241
01:24:17,960 --> 01:24:30,960
What. I don't know how they did it but they had this crazy elaborate way that it was not going to just be screens for this Kong ride. And like there's like they're probably just as frustrated as we are about having to like put so many screen rides.

1242
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:47,960
Yeah those giant ride and it seems like the same thing happened with the Fast and the Furious Supercharge where it's like they built these giant ride vehicles and yes it does get a lot of people through in an hour you know per person capacity.

1243
01:24:47,960 --> 01:24:52,960
But it's like oh those don't they can't they don't really have a range of movement you know.

1244
01:24:52,960 --> 01:25:09,960
Yeah and of course and it's just and it's with the Kong ride to it feels short. I mean that's a different no different problem but like yeah it's it's a it's like using screen using screens if it's a very specific reason like Toy Story Midway Mania which uses screen or if it's used to augment like Spider Man.

1245
01:25:09,960 --> 01:25:16,960
I mean Spider Man is mostly screens with the screen ride effects and the range of movement in the car. Really it all works together.

1246
01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:33,960
But you need one screen ride in the park or two and then the screen to augment other experiences like on the the Navi River journey at Avatar you use a screen in the background to make it look like there's a Navi running and but there's practical you know plant life and stuff like that.

1247
01:25:33,960 --> 01:25:48,960
I think more than ever that tech tile tech coal robots animatronics. Yeah because these are you know so many I guess watch movies just in your house and you can in video games are in your house. These places the only places with the big crazy robots.

1248
01:25:48,960 --> 01:26:04,960
Yeah and I want I guess that's where my point is coming from is like if this was like a more dynamic ride vehicle or experience you would really like whoa this ride is on the level of Indiana Jones whereas I think you get it just takes a little I'm so sorry you guys who made it.

1249
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:17,960
It's great. I just have my feeling if you had any. Yeah. Well next time just don't don't shoot. Just don't shoot. Just keep just look at stuff. Hey you know there are screens in this ride but these screens have Will Smith himself.

1250
01:26:17,960 --> 01:26:46,960
On them. Yeah and I am a glorious standard definition. That's what I to come. Well one's not really a complaint one complaint one observation the complaint is that this is one of the big offenders of like some Florida cues like they have not upgraded for it like because they got this giant cool oval screen in what is my second point the immigration and control room which is the giant room with the two alien robots.

1251
01:26:46,960 --> 01:27:06,960
The giant room with the two alien twins that you can see all the debt and I be desks immigration control sure it was very funny at the time to call like but now I that kind of has an H12. Oh no are the men in black ice for the alien like oh let's not think about that.

1252
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:22,960
The answer is yes. Yeah. That is what they're coming here illegally and men in black are designed to. Well they register them to supposedly. I guess that's true. They seem benevolent. They seem like a benevolent government organization. But I mean there's been some funny business in those movies. There's room for sure.

1253
01:27:22,960 --> 01:27:37,960
And depending on who's running the men in black I mean maybe they're very hostile toward our alien friends who come to this. So it depends who's in charge. Oh that's a good point. Is that happening. The third I've never seen the third one. I also have not seen the third one either. I almost

1254
01:27:37,960 --> 01:28:03,960
watched it. Movie night boys. Oh boy. Josh Brolin right he's young Tommy. Brolin is young Tommy Lee. Yeah yeah. You know there was some click bait headline that was like the actor who plays Thanos is actually very handsome in real life. And like I think Jenny Nicholson maybe posted that. It's like the actor. Yeah he's very famous. He's like a storied career very good career.

1255
01:28:03,960 --> 01:28:19,960
Famous enough to be on movie posters with his name all the time. Yeah. Fun fact his name is. He has a name. It's Josh Brolin. He's the son of another famous actor. They're a family of actors.

1256
01:28:19,960 --> 01:28:40,960
I what a crabby headline. But the what we say. Yeah well that'd be the way to do if they did a you know a real if they want to make a real relevance currents you know Newman in black but with the tone and shooting style of homeland or that would be a thing I would avoid at all costs.

1257
01:28:40,960 --> 01:29:00,960
It seems like you'd see articles about how it was very thoughtful and cool of them to comment on the Trump bearer. Netflix like Ghost Troopers or whatever right. Like the good. That was one of those movies. It was it seemed like it's like Ghostbusters but deadly serious. Oh and it was like special ops guys with ghost guns.

1258
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:15,960
You aren't talking about our IPD. No no no. And you're also not talking about was the ghost show on Hulu. I made fun of all the time. Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah. I know what you're talking about. Ghosts. Can't help himself.

1259
01:29:15,960 --> 01:29:30,960
What was it called another show. I think it'd be called Ghosted but then there is the show Ghosted as well. There's a lot of these. Do you guys like the men in black films or the first film the first one I loved. I thought that was so much fun.

1260
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:45,960
And then I also like back when you were like you could be really like moved by a quote like I remember like Tommy Lee Jones is like you know yesterday you didn't know. I should really look this up like yesterday you do blah blah blah. And now you know that there's alien blah blah blah.

1261
01:29:45,960 --> 01:29:56,960
Imagine what you'll know tomorrow. Wow he's right. Five thousand years ago people thought the Earth. Thank you. You actually know the full. I just saw this morning. Oh yeah. And I still can't actually produce it.

1262
01:29:56,960 --> 01:30:10,960
It's true. It's about. That'll be the sign off message for the episode. I did like the I really liked the world building around it. I think like there's some decent jokes.

1263
01:30:10,960 --> 01:30:24,960
I feel like the plots are kind of all over the place. I think the first one's a lot but the second one with the galaxy on the cat's collar is a little confusing. Although Rosario Dawson always liked her.

1264
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:40,960
She's going to go that second one. And I mean oh god. The one thing I love from this movie is that it's not present in this ride. Maybe some footage but Vincent D'Onofrio always great. He's so fun.

1265
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:58,960
Sugar sugar water like it's he's so great. It seems to have some like new. There's like a wave of people who are like like we're keeping that alive. I feel like how crazy and funny that performance is. Yeah. Yeah. I mean I didn't even.

1266
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:18,960
It was like years later until I put it together that that was him. Yeah. Me too. Another story career. Like there's a thing I like about the Men in Black franchise in general is that for this big movie with these like these very commercial rap songs and whatever that there's odd idiosyncratic performances from weirdo character actors.

1267
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:34,960
Yes. Vincent D'Onofrio and RipTorne and Johnny Knoxville's fun and that one the one. David Cross is a small role. David Cross is really funny. The first one and the second one. Jermaine Clements. Josh Brawn is always good and stuff. I didn't see it.

1268
01:31:34,960 --> 01:31:48,960
Sure. But they like this franchise is a I don't think it has to be. Well Barry Sonnenfeld who also did the Addams Family which contains some of the most strange performances in mainstream blockbusters from Raoul Julia to the kids are so good.

1269
01:31:48,960 --> 01:32:03,960
Christina Ricci and what's his name? The Pugsley? No the other the boyfriend. Oh yeah yeah yeah that kid. Krummholz. Thank you. Is really good. So yeah Sonnenfeld pretty excellent run.

1270
01:32:03,960 --> 01:32:17,960
I feel like he made a lot of blockbusters better than they kind of had a right to be. Did he wag the dog? Was that him? Maybe. Don't hold this against us we're not a film podcast. Yeah. I'm sorry. He had some more like awards kind of fair there too.

1271
01:32:17,960 --> 01:32:32,960
Yeah it was also just it was in the right time when I was of I what was I 12 or 13? Yeah. And it was like Independence Day had come out the year prior. I loved Independence Day so it was very much a Will Smith was the coolest guy and it was like every movie he makes is going to be awesome.

1272
01:32:32,960 --> 01:32:46,960
The marketing for these were fun the trailers were fun. Yeah I do I do like these. The vibe of them kind of reminds me a lot. Oh this is kind of like what I liked as a kid with Ghostbusters. Barry Levinson is wag the dog Jason. Oh that is confusing.

1273
01:32:46,960 --> 01:33:15,960
And this is Barry Sonnenfeld. Okay. But sort of that like there's a there's a world here there's rules to this world but there's like it's funny too. Like this and Ghostbusters kind of have that in common. And these like systems. Very similar Ghostbusters in that way that you have the proton packs and you got to like learn how these things work. The guns are so cool. Oh yeah the noisy cricket. Right. The denuralizer. Denuralizer amazing invention. What a cool design. The idea you can set those. Oh.

1274
01:33:15,960 --> 01:33:44,960
Dials. And who wouldn't love to be denuralized right about now. That would be wonderful. Well I think we have to get through some bullshit in the world because if you came out if you were denuralized and then entered this world right now that would be weird. But when when the administration is done if we could just kind of go back to the beginning of 2016 and denuralize all of it. Yeah. You're just like all right so here's the world now and here's the Marvel movies you missed and that's it. That's all that happened. An agent just shoves it in.

1275
01:33:44,960 --> 01:34:14,960
An agent just shoves it. An agent just shoves it. Wow 70 movies. I'll be busy. Lot's to catch up on. I really liked Men in Black when it came out and I have a little thing to share which is that I when I was walking out of the theater to the strains of the Men in Black song and I always saw it with my dad and I could tell that he did not like the film and he looked back and asked me what do you think kind of with some judgment and I wanted to show that I really liked it and I said I shall

1276
01:34:14,960 --> 01:34:44,960
pray for a sequel. Whoa. You were saying you had the premise that I was like a hip kid or something. That's how I talked in 1997. I was a little lights camera Jackson. That's wild. Yeah I have a such a strong memory of saying it and I remember even more strongly my dad like grimacing. He didn't like that. Yeah he was like what who's this wiener kid I'm raising. I can dab on my knees and humble myself before a vengeful god that he brings back to me.

1277
01:34:44,960 --> 01:35:14,960
Another of these fine films. I prostrate myself before whatever higher power there is. Whatever Hollywood lords and ladies make the decisions. And then I got my wish and I didn't see it. I think I only saw the Michael Jackson part on YouTube and then my prayers came true and I didn't. What an awful kid. Wow. If you think I'm annoying now then if you met me when I was 12. Yeah horrible. Man. Once again these are the

1278
01:35:14,960 --> 01:35:37,280
now I've that one is really damning and that forbidden Broadway stuff that came up in the American Adventure episode. I who boy I skated away. They slid away from an awful way of being. And I'm very and I say prayers to say thank you. Hey why couldn't you just be a normal kid like me. Do you think nod your heads to motivate you.

1279
01:35:37,280 --> 01:35:59,280
The elliptical man. Man me knowing all the words to push in 3 a.m. by Matchbox 20. I look like the coolest guy out of all three of us now is when we were 14. You were you were ahead of it. I was I was a snob and I didn't like Matchbox 20. Then I made a video with Rob Thomas the singer.

1280
01:35:59,280 --> 01:36:28,400
I made a video with him at Funny or Die. He was great. He was a cool dude. Let me get the word out here that Rob Thomas is was awesome. So much fun. So I got no beef with Matchbox 20 today. You I think maybe you were the coolest. You were. I was. Wow. I didn't think that was the case. Thumbs up Rob. Cool dude. Hey we're all cool. Hey you know we're all. Now we have a podcast where I complain that's got to get rid of that standard deaf. Come on guys. Put it a high def screen on that cool oval.

1281
01:36:29,600 --> 01:36:49,360
So Baloney related ideas. Things really worked out for the three of us. Baloney the intricacies of fast pass at Universal. There's a lot of exciting going on. Yes we are. I highly recommend. I also recommend this ride. What do we think. Any final thoughts.

1282
01:36:49,360 --> 01:37:11,440
Well if you had to. What if we ranked the ride as do we call it. We rank it as a galaxy defender as cosmically average or as bug bait. Oh I mean if that's. This is the ranking system at the end of the ride. It's got to be a galaxy defender. Yeah. That's an unfro. We know the answer.

1283
01:37:11,440 --> 01:37:39,440
Really. Even if you have some. It's a it's galaxy defender. I mean my big improvement. I think I talked about liking like little little plus ups in rides when they like bring a ride back from refurbishment and you're like oh look there's a little. There's a couple extra things in here. I would just love. I would love a little bit of a very cranky Tommy Lee Jones begrudgingly just a little bit of footage is him like.

1284
01:37:39,440 --> 01:38:08,440
All right when you get in your ride vehicle Jonah. I would also love a. But Vincent D'Affrio bug animatronic I would love a sugar animatronic. I agree more. Yeah I think you do. Yeah. Yeah. That would if they like the hat box goes. That's that's sort of what I'm saying. A little bit more from the movie a little bit more of that character you remember because you can focus on.

1285
01:38:09,440 --> 01:38:27,440
Because of the because you're not shooting at it. How about a bug man Vincent D'Affrio walk around. How about like a like a beetle juice. God. Jim Carrey Grinch characters they have used. I think the I think we found that the bug needs to be more a part of pop culture at large.

1286
01:38:27,440 --> 01:38:56,440
Well fun if a bug was walking around and bothering you and like slobbering and he held out his hand and his hand was gross and I wouldn't care for that. Nothing to make you actually sick. He's just got like Nickelodeon Gack on his palm. That's funny you mentioned that because like I found footage I'd sent it to you guys of like the opening day of this attraction and they had like men in black scaling down from the towers and there was a Lincoln town car and they had plasters and a big explosion in the front. I'm realizing I don't remember any aliens.

1287
01:38:56,440 --> 01:39:25,440
In that footage but like yeah that would have been like the first year you have some aliens wander around you have black in the suits wandering around if you to kind of get the word out about the park if they're what if they did like typical universal characters like Marilyn Monroe or Groucho Marx and they de-masked themselves revealed themselves or like opened a little pod in their chest and there's a little alien controlling them so like that the men in black equivalent of like the hard rock park commercials.

1288
01:39:25,440 --> 01:39:36,440
When it's a regular person and then they get rock and roll and they're going to the hard rock sounds like they went to hard rock part must have been through the immigration facilities and then my be headquarters there.

1289
01:39:36,440 --> 01:39:45,440
There I would think though that like if I'm talking to Lucille ball outside of the I love Lucy experience and she turns out to be a bug person.

1290
01:39:45,440 --> 01:39:56,440
I'm going to be very upset that's cool as hell I love that you know I I'll veto that idea because I just I want to talk to Lucy I want to have a conversation with her and that's all.

1291
01:39:56,440 --> 01:40:16,440
Okay that's fine and if they hired a really short actor so that the entire head area could be filled with some like full but full alien like doing a little like like a little elliptical machine.

1292
01:40:16,440 --> 01:40:21,440
Oh yeah I always like the tiny aliens in the human yes that's that was very fun.

1293
01:40:21,440 --> 01:40:35,440
Yeah yeah it does feel like they should them to I haven't seen the third they should have been big like the universe is so cool and then they like one is the only one that anyone has any affection for movie one yeah.

1294
01:40:35,440 --> 01:40:45,440
There should have been better there should have I mean there were some funny action scenes there should have been some like cool John Woo kind of like yeah.

1295
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:55,440
Shoot out scenes but yeah like the ride is we're saying yeah adding the character I also we could add the bug man to be able to use his graveyard review is that still going I don't know I don't think so I don't think so.

1296
01:40:55,440 --> 01:40:59,440
I want it to be the bug man.

1297
01:40:59,440 --> 01:41:14,440
I want the bug man and beetle juice and Frankenstein to do Gangnam Style and that's all I want literally your music is got your favorite song for a decade was nod your head and now it's Gangnam Style for another decade it's a big Gangnam Style.

1298
01:41:14,440 --> 01:41:30,440
Hey just some real quick tips if you are going on this ride anytime soon try to sit on either outside don't sit in the middle seat it's three across the middle seat it's always harder to score points at the end listen for ripped warned to tell you to hit the red button.

1299
01:41:30,440 --> 01:41:42,440
And well yes aim for farther away targets that's the same on Buzz Lightyear you want to aim for farther away targets because it's like a cone infrared it's like a cone so it's wider when it comes out that's true on Buzz Lightyear.

1300
01:41:42,440 --> 01:41:45,440
Yeah, yeah, it's tougher to aim it's been written for me.

1301
01:41:45,440 --> 01:41:47,440
Well, no, I thought that it's tougher you more points is what you're saying right.

1302
01:41:47,440 --> 01:41:51,440
No, I think it just gets more accurate the further it goes.

1303
01:41:51,440 --> 01:41:53,440
Oh, I didn't know that.

1304
01:41:53,440 --> 01:41:57,440
But also often on Buzz Lightyear the farther away target is the blue target or the target.

1305
01:41:57,440 --> 01:41:58,440
Yeah, so it's more points.

1306
01:41:58,440 --> 01:41:59,440
Oh, I see.

1307
01:41:59,440 --> 01:42:03,440
I will say don't in real life though if ripped horn tells you to do something.

1308
01:42:03,440 --> 01:42:04,440
Take a moment.

1309
01:42:04,440 --> 01:42:06,440
Yeah, think about it and think about it.

1310
01:42:06,440 --> 01:42:07,440
What is he saying to you?

1311
01:42:07,440 --> 01:42:09,440
What is his state of mind?

1312
01:42:09,440 --> 01:42:15,440
If he hands you a weapon and proudly calls it jumbo Judy.

1313
01:42:15,440 --> 01:42:18,440
You're Larry Sanders now kid.

1314
01:42:18,440 --> 01:42:25,440
Take a breath and he has you drink something it just don't don't be handed an object by ripped horn.

1315
01:42:25,440 --> 01:42:30,440
If he thinks a bank is his house.

1316
01:42:30,440 --> 01:42:31,440
Which is what happened.

1317
01:42:31,440 --> 01:42:32,440
Fine actor though.

1318
01:42:32,440 --> 01:42:33,440
Amazing.

1319
01:42:33,440 --> 01:42:35,440
Oh, I love it when he shows up in movies.

1320
01:42:35,440 --> 01:42:36,440
So glad he's in the ride.

1321
01:42:36,440 --> 01:42:37,440
So glad Will's in the ride.

1322
01:42:37,440 --> 01:42:39,440
Glad Will's in the ride.

1323
01:42:39,440 --> 01:42:40,440
Yeah, ups the level.

1324
01:42:40,440 --> 01:42:43,440
Those ending videos when he gives you the neuralyzer.

1325
01:42:43,440 --> 01:42:45,440
Come on, let's make him high def guys.

1326
01:42:45,440 --> 01:42:46,440
Yeah.

1327
01:42:46,440 --> 01:42:47,440
All right.

1328
01:42:47,440 --> 01:42:48,440
Update the definition.

1329
01:42:48,440 --> 01:42:51,440
Add an expensive bug character and then.

1330
01:42:51,440 --> 01:42:54,440
And take out all the guns and the shooting part.

1331
01:42:54,440 --> 01:42:56,440
And we're good to go.

1332
01:42:56,440 --> 01:42:57,440
And we're set.

1333
01:42:57,440 --> 01:43:01,440
And you survived podcast the ride of Men in Black Alien Attack.

1334
01:43:01,440 --> 01:43:05,440
This is the last podcast you ever listened to.

1335
01:43:05,440 --> 01:43:07,440
Or this is the last suit you'll write.

1336
01:43:07,440 --> 01:43:08,440
That's what he said.

1337
01:43:08,440 --> 01:43:14,440
Yeah, we're the first, last and only podcast defense in the universe.

1338
01:43:14,440 --> 01:43:15,440
That's not accurate.

1339
01:43:15,440 --> 01:43:19,440
So follow us at podcast the ride on Twitter.

1340
01:43:19,440 --> 01:43:22,440
Then email us podcast the ride to Gmail.

1341
01:43:22,440 --> 01:43:24,440
And we have a Facebook group.

1342
01:43:24,440 --> 01:43:25,440
Facebook group.

1343
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:26,440
Fun posts going on in there.

1344
01:43:26,440 --> 01:43:29,440
We have an unofficial fan page we just discovered too.

1345
01:43:29,440 --> 01:43:30,440
So go there.

1346
01:43:30,440 --> 01:43:31,440
Oh, yeah.

1347
01:43:31,440 --> 01:43:32,440
Discussion.

1348
01:43:32,440 --> 01:43:37,440
I like reading rules and saying keep the discussion about among other things, the hosts.

1349
01:43:37,440 --> 01:43:38,440
Yeah.

1350
01:43:38,440 --> 01:43:39,440
Please talk about us.

1351
01:43:39,440 --> 01:43:45,440
Please only talk about us and about how cool we are and how we're so much cooler than we

1352
01:43:45,440 --> 01:43:46,440
were 12.

1353
01:43:46,440 --> 01:43:47,440
We've come a long way.

1354
01:43:47,440 --> 01:43:48,440
Yes.

1355
01:43:48,440 --> 01:43:49,440
And then I do have any.

1356
01:43:49,440 --> 01:43:53,440
I have one more quote to read in closing unless you guys are more.

1357
01:43:53,440 --> 01:43:54,440
Let's hear it.

1358
01:43:54,440 --> 01:43:57,440
500 years ago, everybody knew the earth was flat.

1359
01:43:57,440 --> 01:44:02,440
And 15 minutes ago, you knew that humans were alone on this planet.

1360
01:44:02,440 --> 01:44:05,440
Imagine what you'll know tomorrow.

1361
01:44:05,440 --> 01:44:07,440
Not your head.

1362
01:44:07,440 --> 01:44:08,440
Black suits.

1363
01:44:08,440 --> 01:44:09,440
Not your head.

1364
01:44:09,440 --> 01:44:13,584
Black suits.
