1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Warning, the following podcast may contain doll-faced genie clones, forced dancing in

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:18,480
the hand of Tom Bergeron, and the zombie-like resurrection of 2014 references from Sharknado

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,480
to Adele Dazeem.

6
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:24,600
Can special guest Paul Rust escape the cave of topical jokes?

7
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:30,600
Find out as we cover Aladdin, a musical spectacular on Podcast the Ride.

8
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:55,520
Welcome to Podcast the Ride, the podcast hosted by a crazier cast of characters than the Jersey

9
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,520
Shore.

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:05,720
My name is Mike Carlson, cold for applause, that would have killed in the Hyperion theater.

11
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:12,920
There's many Jersey Shore jokes in the Aladdin, a musical spectacular show.

12
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,720
Joining me as always is Jason Sheridan.

13
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,920
Scott, you had a joke too, did you want to do it?

14
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:23,480
Oh, I was just going to say that we all, the three of us love theme parks so much, without

15
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:26,880
them our lives would be empty, like Kim Kardashian's head.

16
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:32,880
Which is a real verbatim joke.

17
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,880
And I just want to say that I'm glad we're finally doing this attraction so we can answer

18
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:41,880
the question of if the dress is black and blue or white and yellow.

19
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,880
Yet another real joke from the show.

20
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:50,680
I'm in such a good mood already.

21
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:55,080
Let's introduce our guest, he wants to get in on this topical fun.

22
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,080
You know him from Netflix's Love.

23
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,080
Ladies and gentlemen, Paul Rust.

24
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,080
Thanks guys for having me.

25
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,080
Yeah, let's chomp it at the bit there.

26
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:08,080
Oh my gosh, once you start spouting genie lines, everybody wants to join the party.

27
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,080
I have a potential intro for you, which is, our guest today, he's a great guy, he's not

28
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,080
an exotic mammal like Snooki.

29
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:19,080
That is also a verbatim joke that I found.

30
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:26,480
The first time I was made aware that you were very into this show too, is when Jason and

31
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,480
I were on Herald Night, like seven, six years ago, and Neal Campbell was giving us notes

32
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:35,480
and I had told a story in the monologue about seeing this show and he was like, oh, Paul

33
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:39,480
loves the Aladdin show at Disney's California Adventure.

34
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:44,480
Well that's awesome because then that means that was like my ticket to get on your guys'

35
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,480
podcast.

36
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,880
Yeah, he said that.

37
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,880
Planting the seeds before it even existed.

38
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:54,880
And it was watered over the last years and then the stem came out and now it's in full

39
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,880
bloom, it's awesome.

40
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,880
Yeah, full plant today.

41
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:01,880
Do you remember what your story was that you told about the Aladdin stage show?

42
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:06,880
I think I was just telling a general story about how I was obsessed with it and how a

43
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,880
lot of the jokes would sort of not even really relate to Aladdin.

44
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:14,880
I think the thing I said specifically, which I had just seen was, there was a line from

45
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,280
Aladdin and then Genie just turned to the audience and said, Snooki.

46
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,280
And that was it.

47
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,280
And I loved it.

48
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:26,280
Everyone who's ever been with me there didn't love it.

49
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,280
Yeah.

50
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,280
Because I would drag everyone.

51
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,280
You would drag it every time.

52
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,280
You would say, well, we could go buy that.

53
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,280
We could go see Aladdin.

54
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,280
Which is what you do with all the weird bullshit there.

55
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,280
The man tea party?

56
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,280
He bangs on a big drum, we gotta go.

57
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,680
I do.

58
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,680
Well, he Mickey drumming is one of the best things you can see in the park when he's a

59
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,680
guy in the suit with the drum.

60
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,680
He's really drumming.

61
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,680
It's great.

62
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,680
It's Miles Teller in there.

63
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:54,680
That's how he got trade for whiplash.

64
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,680
He was the Mickey drummer.

65
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,680
How do you get the drumming out without the paparazzi pounding him?

66
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,680
Yeah, you can do it in a Mickey suit.

67
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,680
Then you can do it in front of J.K.

68
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,680
Simmons.

69
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:06,680
But no, I think you are hitting on what is the delight of the Aladdin.

70
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:16,080
If you're a comedy fan and a particular fan of a particular type of comedy, you get it

71
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,080
in spades at the Aladdin stage show.

72
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:21,080
That is my favorite part as well.

73
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:25,080
The ones that don't even link that well at all.

74
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,080
No.

75
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:35,080
I feel like they have a parallel or antecedent in the spoof movies of who are the spoofers

76
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,480
of the movie.

77
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,480
Friedberg and Setzer.

78
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:46,480
I love those and I would go and see them on opening weekend.

79
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,480
I love them so much.

80
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,480
Really?

81
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,480
Wow.

82
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,480
You went to the theater.

83
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,480
Wow.

84
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:55,480
I'd pay actual money.

85
00:04:55,480 --> 00:05:02,480
We're talking like epic movie, date movie, disaster movie.

86
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,880
Meet the Spartans.

87
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,880
Other things started using the movie title premise.

88
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,880
They ducked and weaved and got out of it with things like Meet the Spartans so they weren't

89
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,880
associated with that trend anymore.

90
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,880
They started hiding what they were doing.

91
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:21,880
Yeah, because they were writers on Scary Movie.

92
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,880
Two of the seven writers.

93
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,880
It's actually a funny joke of all the things they ever did.

94
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:38,280
With all those movies, I would always be like, I love them.

95
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,280
People would be like, well, ironically, right?

96
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,280
I'm like, I don't think so.

97
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:48,280
I'm laughing in the same way that I laugh at other stuff so I'm not going to judge it.

98
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,280
I'm not going to try to analyze it.

99
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:54,280
If you're getting joy from it and laughing, then you can't intellectualize that too much.

100
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,280
I would lose my mind at the genies jokes.

101
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:01,680
The one I most remember, I felt like I wanted to spew it out as soon as you guys were all

102
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,680
sitting there.

103
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,680
Maybe I should save it because the only one I totally remember without having rewatched

104
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,680
videos.

105
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,680
Oh, just have it.

106
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:18,080
The genie comes out and he was able to stick his belly out, push it out tight and do a

107
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,080
big ball.

108
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,080
He was like, I'm feeling like Bretany.

109
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,080
He looked down and went, oops, I did it again.

110
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:30,080
I'm not going to lie.

111
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,080
I'm laughing at that.

112
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,080
I don't quite understand it.

113
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,080
It's like what Mike said.

114
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,080
They're just grasping.

115
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,080
They're just grasping.

116
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,080
It's just a reference that the audience recognizes.

117
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:44,080
He says it in a funny way because they are good performers.

118
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,080
I will argue they are pretty good performers.

119
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,080
Oh, yeah.

120
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,080
Then that has evolved towards the end of the run.

121
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:58,880
As Bretany says in her Vegas show, he moves his mouth but no words come out.

122
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,880
She's lip syncing.

123
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:05,880
Bretany has been a real source of humor for that Aladdin series and the Kardashians.

124
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:14,480
The Kardashians, Dr. Phil, Snoopy, Dr. Phil, Justin Bieber, who all also factor into the

125
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,480
epic movie and turn into those films.

126
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,880
Those movies are the same sort of thing.

127
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,880
There's not always a joke there.

128
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:25,880
It'll just be like Borat is over there in a swimsuit.

129
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,880
Remember that?

130
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,880
We all laughed at that the first time.

131
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:35,880
I think what it is is when you're a kid and at school you have a talent show and then

132
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,880
people do Wayne and Garth.

133
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,880
You'll be like, Wayne's world.

134
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,880
You're like, well, I guess this is comedy.

135
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,880
We've seen this before, so we all agree.

136
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:51,280
We touched on this a little bit when we talked about the Bill and Ted show at Universal Studios

137
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,280
Halloween Horror Nights in a similar vein.

138
00:07:54,280 --> 00:08:00,280
First of all, my whole, I've been mad ever since about when I was in middle school and

139
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:04,780
somebody, I worked really hard on a sketch that I wrote that was original and then the

140
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:08,280
most popular kid in school just got up and said, I'm Austin Powers.

141
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,280
Yeah, baby.

142
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,280
Everybody went ape shit.

143
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,680
I probably should have learned some lesson from that.

144
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,680
Instead, I went the other way and got really furious and stayed furious.

145
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,680
I'm less mad at this one because the guys were fun, nice guys, and they did it well.

146
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:27,680
This probably places my exact high school year that there were people killed at the

147
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:32,680
talent show when you're singing the Trogdor song from Homestar Runner.

148
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,680
Wow.

149
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,680
Is anybody else a Homestar Runner?

150
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,680
No.

151
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,080
I think I blew up my high school in particular.

152
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,080
But less mad at that one.

153
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,080
Austin Powers, come on.

154
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:50,080
Yeah, because with Homestar, you're like, okay, you were at least inside enough to pick

155
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,080
it.

156
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,080
Yeah, you're showing that you know the slightly deep ring.

157
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,080
If you breathe air, you're pleased.

158
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,080
Austin Powers.

159
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,080
Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah.

160
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,080
And he didn't even do the voice good.

161
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,080
He barely committed.

162
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,080
He did not study the British Isles.

163
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:09,480
Austin Powers' voice also heavily featured in the run of the Genie for sure.

164
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:14,480
It's like a living caricature stand at a theme park.

165
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:19,480
When you walk by and you see they always have an Austin Powers, they always have a Tom Cruise.

166
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,480
Oh, yeah, yeah.

167
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,480
And they look really gross.

168
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:28,480
Yeah, when I'd walk by a caricature stand, I'd say, I'm repeating a joke I say to my

169
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,480
friends, guys.

170
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,480
It's pretty cool of me.

171
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:35,880
I'd go, guys, it's so nice to Tom Cruise to stop by every caricature stand in America

172
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,880
to let the...

173
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,880
Mike Myers comes in costume as Austin Powers is really nice too.

174
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:50,880
But yeah, there is a particular, I guess this is its own genre of theme park is the live

175
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,880
performance.

176
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,880
I know you guys have done Terminator.

177
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,880
Yes.

178
00:09:56,280 --> 00:10:01,280
And that one is more the voices are recorded and they just have to mime.

179
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,280
Yes.

180
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,280
Aladdin is the actual, they are speaking.

181
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,280
So you get that energy.

182
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,280
Yeah, and singing.

183
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,280
Yes, and singing.

184
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,280
Improvising.

185
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,280
And flying.

186
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:14,280
And showing you that they thought of stuff that day, which is like, you know, you can

187
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:19,280
roll your eyes at some of these jokes that they are like including things that just happened.

188
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,280
It's probably fairly unprecedented.

189
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,680
Do you think they have a group of writers off stage who like if something just pops

190
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,680
up in the last hour, we got to...

191
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:29,680
I have information on this in the process.

192
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,680
Well, real quick, let's like go back in case no one else knows what we are talking about.

193
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:39,680
Aladdin, a musical spectacular, ran from January 2003 to January 2016 at Disney's California

194
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,680
Adventure.

195
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,680
13 years.

196
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,680
An impressive run.

197
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,680
Thanks, Trump.

198
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:47,680
10 months later, he would be elected.

199
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,680
2016 ruined everything.

200
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:53,080
Bulma replaced in 2010 by a Toy Story musical.

201
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,080
Oh yeah.

202
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:58,080
Which was shelved and then now replaced by Frozen.

203
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,080
Yeah.

204
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,080
That's where the toys go.

205
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:04,080
Woody and Buzz put back on the shelf.

206
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,080
Which is the rumor of what's going to happen.

207
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:12,080
We are still deep in the rumor of potentially Country Bears goes away in favor of a, which

208
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:15,080
is always been the way in Disneyland for a long time, but in Disney World it might get

209
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,080
replaced with a Toy Story thing.

210
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,080
So we seem glum today.

211
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:24,080
When I walked in, I noticed all the lights were off and there was candles lit.

212
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,080
We had not been speaking to each other.

213
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,080
We were wearing shrouds.

214
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,080
It was kind of awake.

215
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,080
Kind of awake, kind of sitting shiva.

216
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:34,080
You don't usually sit shiva before the death, but we were getting ahead of it.

217
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:37,080
So I'm looking liver lips McGraw.

218
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,080
You had some time.

219
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,080
But yeah.

220
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:45,080
Speaking of seeing movies in theaters, I saw the Country Bears movie in the theater because

221
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:52,480
I was like, this is the last time there's going to be a full on people in suit movie

222
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,480
for the rest of my time.

223
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:59,480
Anytime now that there's going to be creatures, they'll be either CG or half CG.

224
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,480
I guess we had Unkar.

225
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,480
Unkar Plut.

226
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,480
Yeah.

227
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,480
He was on the suit.

228
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,480
He was on the menu.

229
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:10,480
Country Bears, I feel like were the last time we really could get.

230
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,480
Entirely.

231
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,480
Full suit.

232
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,880
Last time we went full suit.

233
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:19,680
And then you know that there was like a warehouse that was really unpleasant and like costumes

234
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,680
dripping with sweat.

235
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,680
Really?

236
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,680
Well, I don't know.

237
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,680
Can you imagine the process?

238
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:30,680
Yeah, the physical like putting those things together.

239
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:37,080
There was a guy who worked at Conan who built all the suits for Ninja Turtles 3 and he had

240
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:40,680
a picture of like, I don't want to say sweatshop.

241
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,880
It's not a sweatshop in that there's bad types of labor being employed.

242
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,880
Just like, yes, yeah, yeah.

243
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:46,880
So much sweat.

244
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,880
Yeah, yeah.

245
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:48,880
Just like costume after costume.

246
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,880
Like there's racks of 70 of them.

247
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,880
It seemed so intense.

248
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,880
Wow.

249
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,880
Just reeking of a BO.

250
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:56,880
Yeah, sure.

251
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,380
I think they in the suits had to like go out of commission for a couple days once they

252
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,880
were worn for a couple hours.

253
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,880
Some just shredded.

254
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,880
Some gotten rid of and turned.

255
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,880
Who shredded them?

256
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:06,880
Who's around?

257
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:12,080
I think I might know one guy.

258
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,080
I had to pick.

259
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:19,080
The the chewy suit when you hug Chewy at Disneyland, there's a musky.

260
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:22,080
There's some sort of a not necessarily.

261
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:25,080
It's the suit that smells not the human, I think.

262
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,080
It's but it's like a grandma's basement.

263
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:30,080
Yeah, something's going on there.

264
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:35,080
He's hugged a lot of people and he's a tall college student that's like six, eight.

265
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:38,280
What do you think is the process of cleaning for those?

266
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,280
It's a good question.

267
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:42,280
I know Disneyland has to have its own dry cleaning thing.

268
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:45,280
They're like go off campus.

269
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,280
Send it home with the guy.

270
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,280
They wait until they get back from college break.

271
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,280
Because it was like a laundry basket.

272
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,280
Thanks, mom.

273
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,280
I'm happy to do it.

274
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,280
It's just nice having you here.

275
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,280
I'm happy to clean any Minnie Mouse outfits.

276
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:02,280
You want me to throw it in?

277
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,280
Throw it in with my stuff.

278
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,480
Your dad's stuff is in there too.

279
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,480
I thought it made sense to group it in with the towels.

280
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,480
Oh, you can toss anything in with the towels.

281
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,480
That's fine.

282
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,480
Wait, what do you think of Country Bears?

283
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:21,480
There's been this debate on the show and our friend Doug Jones really stands by it.

284
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,480
And I think we've spoken ill of it.

285
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:26,480
What do you think of Country Bears?

286
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,480
I remember taking my niece to it.

287
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,680
So I had probably adjusted some expectation levels.

288
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:35,680
I was in college and taking my niece.

289
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,680
So I was probably already like this might suck and that's okay.

290
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:41,680
And actually I think I remember being pleasantly surprised.

291
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,680
There might have been a little bit too much irony.

292
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:49,680
I think if I remember it correctly there was a little bit of trying to beat the Shrek coolness.

293
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,680
You know what I mean?

294
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:55,680
We're bringing this into the...

295
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,880
The thing I always hate about when people go like,

296
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:03,880
It's a kids movie that there's jokes that the parents can write too.

297
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,880
Most of those jokes are dumb.

298
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:11,880
The jokes for the parents are like a reference to American Idol and Shrek.

299
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,880
And it's like, that's for the parents?

300
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:17,880
And also kids like those jokes and parents like the kids jokes.

301
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,880
Parents laugh just as much as donkey farting as the kids do.

302
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

303
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,880
Why do we have to figure out who laughs the most?

304
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,080
We have to figure out who likes what movies.

305
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,080
Everybody likes...

306
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,080
Yeah, probably.

307
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:35,080
If you look at what family movies end up on a critics best of list.

308
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:41,080
They don't have crap like, they don't have a reference to something that happened a year ago.

309
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:44,080
Like Spider-Man or Coco or whatever.

310
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:47,080
Adults jokes is strange.

311
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:50,080
If you go back and re-watch those Shreks,

312
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:53,080
there's some jokes in there that you're like, oh my god this is...

313
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:57,280
Those spoof movies, I think it's Disaster Movie.

314
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:00,280
They actually have a newspaper in it.

315
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:04,280
And on the newspaper it's the date that the movie came out.

316
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:09,280
And it was almost like their joke of like, this is how long this movie will last.

317
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:13,280
It won't even pass the expiration of the release date of the movie.

318
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,280
Wow.

319
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,280
Really?

320
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,280
Yeah.

321
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,280
Those guys are pretty cool.

322
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,280
That is cool.

323
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,280
Yeah, that is.

324
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,280
We're impressed by them.

325
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,480
I've never been done in a movie.

326
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,480
I know, right?

327
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,480
You haven't ever seen the actual date of the movie.

328
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:31,480
My birthday once was on a Thursday when Cheers came out.

329
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:35,480
And I remember they said, my birthday is April 12th.

330
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:39,480
And for whatever reason they needed the date in the episode of Cheers.

331
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:43,480
And on my birthday, April 12th, they said, April 12th in the episode.

332
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,480
Wow.

333
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:49,480
So that was another time that art invaded the date.

334
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,480
A wonderful phenomenon.

335
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:01,480
But you compare this to like the second golden age of Disney animation or something.

336
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,480
And Little Mermaid, Aladdin, Lion King.

337
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,480
The jokes in that are pretty tight.

338
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,480
I mean, Aladdin has some good Robin Williams kind of jokes.

339
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,480
But those movies would take so long to make.

340
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,480
They wouldn't cram topical stuff in there.

341
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,480
Oh, yeah, right.

342
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,480
The jokes are a little more evergreen in those ones.

343
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,680
Right.

344
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,680
Like if they did an Iran Contra joke or something,

345
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,680
then Little Mermaid would probably stick out.

346
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,680
And even the genie impressions.

347
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,680
Those are more like Jack Nichols.

348
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,680
That's that less.

349
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,680
Pretty perennial.

350
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:37,680
Rich Littles impressions that could play in the same spot for 40 years.

351
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:40,680
He does impersonate, I think, George F. Will in that movie.

352
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,680
And I don't know how many kids were like,

353
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:46,680
yes, conservative commentator George F. Will.

354
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,680
Is that something about quid pro quo?

355
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,880
Quid pro quo.

356
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,880
Quid pro quo.

357
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,880
I had no idea what that was until now.

358
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,880
That is George F. Will.

359
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,880
Wow.

360
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,880
Still around.

361
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,880
Still commentating.

362
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,880
Still complaining about how the game of baseball is played.

363
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,880
Oh wait.

364
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,880
Maybe not George F. Will.

365
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,880
Sorry, it's the guy who gets in the...

366
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,880
He would get in the fight with...

367
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,880
They'd go into a cabin and these two writers would have a fight.

368
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,880
William F. Buckley.

369
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,880
Buckley.

370
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,880
Buckley was in his house.

371
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,880
Yes, I got the George F. Will, William F. Buckley.

372
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,880
He was an initial guy.

373
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,080
Yes, the F.

374
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,080
Good thing I didn't say Paul F. Tompkins.

375
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,080
We know that's not correct.

376
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,080
We know that.

377
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:28,080
Yeah, when Paul F. Tompkins debated Gore Vidal on Cabot.

378
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,080
That was a whole different...

379
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,080
Do you think if in November 92 when we went and saw Aladdin

380
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:36,080
if the Genie had done an impression of Paul F. Tompkins

381
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,080
we would have been able to appreciate it?

382
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,080
I don't think so.

383
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,080
I don't think so.

384
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,080
It would have been a tad confusing.

385
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,080
The Philadelphia comedian?

386
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,080
Yes, a local...

387
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:47,280
Never appeared on television.

388
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,280
I didn't hear of him.

389
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,280
I did have one of those things though where...

390
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:55,280
Do you ever have the thing where you watched a stand-up

391
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:59,280
when you were younger and then you remember a joke

392
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,280
and then the person starts saying on stage, like,

393
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,280
oh, I saw this.

394
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,280
It happened to me with Paul F. Tompkins.

395
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,280
When I was a freshman in high school maybe

396
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:12,280
I saw a stand-up on Conan make a joke about

397
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,480
how this relates to Disney.

398
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,480
He turned on the TV and at like 2 a.m.

399
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,480
the Apple Dumpling Gang was on.

400
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,480
Sure.

401
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:24,480
With Tim Conway and he was like

402
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,480
what family is watching the Apple Dumpling Gang

403
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,480
at 2 a.m.?

404
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:33,480
And he was like, oh, it's for alcoholic fathers

405
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,480
who wake up their kids and are like

406
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:38,480
the Apple Dumpling Gang is on.

407
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,480
And the kids are like forced to watch it.

408
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,680
We're gonna be a family.

409
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:47,680
Well, because he went backwards and his first album

410
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,680
was like older material that he was refining.

411
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,680
Is that in there?

412
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,680
Yes, I think that's why.

413
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,680
I think he was going back to the first

414
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,680
which also included Crushed Pennies

415
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,680
another theme park.

416
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,680
So he was really...

417
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,680
We gotta ask him about all this stuff.

418
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,680
He's fully...

419
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:05,680
Were you guys saying it was the sort of

420
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,680
the Disney Renaissance?

421
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,680
Did you guys see Aladdin in the theaters?

422
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,680
Do you remember?

423
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,680
Sure, yeah.

424
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,880
I saw it at the El Capitan.

425
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,880
My parents took me to a special El Capitan

426
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,880
which I think was the first time I ever went there

427
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,880
and that's an incredible theater

428
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,880
when you're eight or whatever.

429
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,880
Yeah, I remember that showing very strongly.

430
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,880
And they do the shows beforehand.

431
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,880
Have you ever done El Capitan lately?

432
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,880
No, I've heard it's fun.

433
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,880
I don't think I've done it ever.

434
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,880
I did a Toy Story one and two there.

435
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:36,880
Oh, that's good.

436
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,880
Six, seven years ago.

437
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,880
Was it as old?

438
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,080
I moved here in 04.

439
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,080
Was it always dazzling and lit up

440
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,080
or was that part of a Hollywood Boulevard

441
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,080
renovation thing?

442
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,080
Was El Capitan always...

443
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,080
I saw it there.

444
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,080
I saw them there not first run.

445
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,080
I saw them there six or seven years ago.

446
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,080
It was like a double feature.

447
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,080
I see, I see.

448
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:59,080
Yeah, I saw one of those

449
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,080
Disney nature documentaries there

450
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,080
a few years ago and that was cool

451
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,080
because before the show they brought

452
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,080
some live animals out.

453
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,080
Oh, really?

454
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,280
To get to see some live animals.

455
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,280
In a really enclosed setting.

456
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,280
What did you see?

457
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,280
What did they bring out?

458
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,280
Oh, I saw a goat.

459
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,280
I remember thinking,

460
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,280
these aren't animals that we're going to

461
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,280
get to see in the jungle.

462
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,280
These are just like petting zoos.

463
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,280
This is what you could get.

464
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,280
This is what you could get every day

465
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,280
for a month.

466
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,280
And I think I saw...

467
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,280
I don't even remember seeing Ratatouille

468
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,280
there.

469
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,280
But before the show...

470
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,280
Unleashed rats?

471
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,280
What's that?

472
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,280
Do they unleash rats?

473
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,280
Have them cook for you?

474
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,280
They had a Ratatouille suit come out

475
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,480
but...

476
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,480
What's your...

477
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,480
Were you fond of Aladdin

478
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,480
previous to all this?

479
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,480
Yeah, I think in that initial

480
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,480
you know, if it's sort of

481
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,480
what the...

482
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,480
Leaving out rescuers down under

483
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,480
but that four

484
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,480
the sort of run from

485
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,480
Little Mermaid, Aladdin

486
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,480
or Beauty and the Beast Aladdin

487
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,480
Lion King, right?

488
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,480
Felt like kind of a piece

489
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,680
and then I felt like after

490
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,680
Lion King when it was like

491
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,680
Pocahontas starting there is when I

492
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,680
Pocahontas...

493
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,680
I was 14 when I came out.

494
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,680
Even Lion King

495
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,680
I remember sitting in the theater at age 13

496
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,680
and being like, I might...

497
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,680
I'm going to see this because it's a

498
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,680
zeitgeist-y thing right now.

499
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,680
I'm not necessarily going because I'm

500
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,680
dying to see

501
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,680
you know, because I was like really cool

502
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,680
with bad complexion and

503
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,680
terrible stroke up.

504
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,680
You're going to start growing up.

505
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,680
People can't know you like kids still.

506
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,880
No, I gotta grow up

507
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,880
to be more hideous.

508
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,880
No, but I loved Aladdin so much

509
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,880
and I remember

510
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,880
yeah, losing it.

511
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,880
I laughed so hard through the whole

512
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,880
movie and then I remember

513
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,880
a month later is when Toys came out

514
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,880
that Robin...

515
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,880
That other Robin Williams movie

516
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,880
and it was such a bait and switch

517
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,880
to go from

518
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,880
within three weeks to Aladdin

519
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,080
and it's like a laugh vest to like

520
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:07,080
I don't know if you've seen Toys but it's like

521
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,080
it's an allegory for

522
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:11,080
military

523
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,080
weapons like

524
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,080
the industrial military

525
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,080
complex and they're using

526
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:19,080
a toy company to build weapons

527
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,080
and it's like Barry Lemonson's

528
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,080
hippie like, hey man

529
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,080
think about the toys you're making for your

530
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,080
kids.

531
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:29,080
That's right.

532
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,080
I got the lesson of small soldiers too.

533
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,280
That's a very odd movie.

534
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,280
Yes, I saw small soldiers for the first time

535
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,280
ten days ago.

536
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,280
Yes, I went on a big

537
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,280
Joe Dante made it.

538
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,280
Oh yeah.

539
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,280
I watched 11 Joe Dante movies in nine days.

540
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,280
I had a really

541
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,280
I went on a Dante fest guys.

542
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,280
That's a fun ride.

543
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,280
There's a lot of fun movies in there.

544
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,280
Oh boy.

545
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,280
I was just listening to a podcast of his.

546
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,480
He was talking about

547
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,480
going to Disneyland.

548
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,480
Oh, he was

549
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,480
remarking about how he couldn't believe

550
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,480
he couldn't remember the ride

551
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,480
but he was saying

552
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,480
they were talking about Song of the South.

553
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,480
It really demonstrates how

554
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,480
people weren't plugged into

555
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,480
sensitivity that that ride

556
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,480
could have came out in 1989.

557
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:25,480
It was based on Uncle Reema's stories.

558
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,480
It's crazy. It was one of those which

559
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,680
I'm sure your listeners have, other people do.

560
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,680
Where he was like, what's the name of that ride?

561
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,680
Oh my gosh, it's based on Song of the South.

562
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,680
Then I'm like, Joe!

563
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,680
Love your movies too!

564
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,680
Get with it!

565
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,680
I loved it and I remember laughing

566
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,680
so much and then when it came out on video

567
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,680
watching it repeatedly.

568
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,680
It really did

569
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,680
kick off.

570
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,680
The fact that this show ended up being

571
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,680
full of topical references

572
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,880
and then

573
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,880
Trek before that.

574
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,880
I don't think any of that happens without Robin Williams

575
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,880
cracking open

576
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,880
the kind of comedy you could do

577
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,880
in an animated movie.

578
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,880
I'd go even so far to say he also

579
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,880
was the person who

580
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,880
there was, I know

581
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,880
other celebrities would have done it previously

582
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,880
but that there was marquee

583
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,880
value in knowing

584
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,880
this celebrity is

585
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,880
the voice of this person you're watching

586
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,080
which a lot of times

587
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,080
you don't give a shit.

588
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,080
You're sort of like...

589
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,080
Jaja Gabor

590
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,080
doing Bianca.

591
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,080
Isn't that

592
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,080
Bianca or is that Aristocats?

593
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,080
Was it Ava Gabor

594
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,080
or was it Ava on Green Acres?

595
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,080
Jaja is hers.

596
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,080
Which would have put a five year old

597
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,080
Mike into the seat.

598
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,080
That's true. So for me, that one would have gotten me there.

599
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,080
But now when it's like

600
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,280
James Gandolfini

601
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,280
and Megamind 2

602
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,280
and it's like...

603
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,280
actually that being James Gandolfini

604
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,280
is also good.

605
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,280
He's very excited about the Gandolfini family.

606
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,280
But there's a lot of weird even like...

607
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:08,280
But I think Robin Williams after that was like...

608
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,280
Yeah, which I think he was trying to avoid.

609
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,280
He didn't want that to get cracked open

610
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,280
and he also apparently didn't want

611
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,280
to step on the box office

612
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,280
of toys.

613
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,280
He thought he would fuck over toys

614
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,480
Disney.

615
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,480
Yeah, and it sort of disappears.

616
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,480
His whole thing was like don't tell people

617
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,480
that it's me.

618
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,480
And then you don't have to pay me as much because

619
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,480
you're not using my name to sell the movie.

620
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,480
And then I think in the commercials

621
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,480
they started showing

622
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,480
him in the recording studio.

623
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,480
Oh, they pushed that footage

624
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,480
that just seemed like

625
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,480
we're going to film it to have it to show behind the scenes.

626
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,480
And then they started using that more aggressively.

627
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,480
Okay, okay.

628
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,680
When they have the behind the scenes stuff

629
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,680
of somebody in the animation studio

630
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,680
doing voices and stuff.

631
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,680
It reminded me of...

632
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,680
Nick Weiger wrote a sketch once that was

633
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,680
it was Phil Collins

634
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,680
is in a recording studio

635
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,680
and he can't concentrate on singing

636
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,680
the Tarzan song because he keeps

637
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,680
blowing takes because he wants to share

638
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,680
all these new facts he's learned about dinosaurs.

639
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,680
So it'll be like

640
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,680
I'll be in your heart.

641
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,680
He's like hold on fellas.

642
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,880
I don't know, a brontosaurus.

643
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,880
But when I saw that sketch I said to Weiger

644
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,880
I was like, you know, the way he did it

645
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,880
was the thing where when somebody's wearing headphones

646
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,880
and they have the one headphone on one ear

647
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,880
and then off on the other.

648
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,880
And I said to him, you know it's really funny that you

649
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,880
wrote that sketch about Phil Collins

650
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,880
because whenever I imagined

651
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,880
somebody in a studio

652
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,880
with one headphone off and one headphone off

653
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,880
like he did

654
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,880
I was like I think of Phil Collins because

655
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,080
I saw this video once of him doing it

656
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,080
and Nick was like that's why I wrote the sketch

657
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,080
I have an image of Phil Collins

658
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:53,080
with a headphone piece.

659
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:55,080
What? I think I have that in my head too.

660
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,080
I've seen that.

661
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:59,080
I think that was for publicity for Tarzan.

662
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,080
They were playing that flip a lot.

663
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:03,080
I've seen that. For sure I've seen that.

664
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,080
He famously, he more than anybody

665
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:07,080
is associated with the one headphone on

666
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:09,080
method is what you're saying.

667
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:11,080
Does he also maybe do that

668
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:13,080
and then in like do they know it's Christmas

669
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:15,280
or something else where we would have seen him in a studio?

670
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,280
A lot of them do I think that.

671
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,280
They're having the one headphone on.

672
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,280
That's pretentious.

673
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,280
It's an affect.

674
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,280
My favorite is when sometimes now

675
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,280
they clearly like stage those

676
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,280
filming date like it's not like

677
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,280
they just brought a camera in

678
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,280
there's the cardboard cut out next to them.

679
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,280
Yeah the Toy Story

680
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,280
like all those Toy Story things they're showing now

681
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,280
for Toy Story 4. It's such like

682
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,280
well lit and there's just like Toy Story

683
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,480
pictures up and they're like doing lines from the movie.

684
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,480
You know Tim Allen came in there

685
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,480
hungover looking puffy

686
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,480
and reddish shit.

687
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,480
Came in

688
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,480
in like sweat pants

689
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,480
like one leg up and another leg

690
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,480
down and then like Tim

691
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,480
we were recording today we're gonna shoot some

692
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,480
video. Anyway

693
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,480
wah wah wah.

694
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,480
Okay sorry sorry sorry sir.

695
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,480
Then a flurry of construction

696
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,480
equipment flew by and made him look

697
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,680
nice.

698
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,680
Also those are very

699
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,680
anytime I've had to do voice

700
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,680
stuff everybody's always been very

701
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,680
supportive but

702
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,680
it can make you feel very vulnerable

703
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,680
because you're just like by yourself

704
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,680
and you're watching other people watch you

705
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,680
and you don't have anything really to connect

706
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,680
with. So I would think

707
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,680
bringing a video camera in there

708
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,680
probably something people wouldn't love.

709
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,680
They're gonna catch you playing with the music stand that has

710
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,680
the carpet on it so it doesn't

711
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,880
the music stand so it doesn't rattle.

712
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,880
Yeah so it doesn't rattle.

713
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,880
That is interesting to play with.

714
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,880
Any situation I've been in

715
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,880
I totally, Phil Collins method

716
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,880
the one headphone on Jason Sheridan's method

717
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,880
play with the flavor. Play with the carpet music

718
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,880
stand. So your voice

719
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,880
doesn't bounce off the metal. I think it's good

720
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,880
to play with the carpet stand because it

721
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,880
sort of shows you're just relaxed.

722
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,880
Hey man we're just having

723
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,880
fun playing with this carpet.

724
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,880
That's a good way to trick people

725
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,080
into thinking I'm confident.

726
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,080
Thank you Jason.

727
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,080
You're owning the environment.

728
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,080
You're marking your territory.

729
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,080
Okay so Ronald

730
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,080
Williams cracks open this whole area

731
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,080
now we can reference celebrities

732
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,080
and stuff in animated

733
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,080
films.

734
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,080
Do you think that's been, I know voice

735
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,080
actors get angry

736
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,080
about it. I would if I was like

737
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,080
man they're coming in on our territory

738
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,080
and you know. Yeah like people like

739
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,280
I don't know if they've complained specifically

740
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,280
but you're Billy Wests of the world

741
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,280
who are really professional and do tons

742
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,280
of voices are like

743
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:44,280
well this is a celebrity comes in and does a regular voice

744
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,280
I spend all this time and come up

745
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,280
with a voice that's perfect and then

746
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,280
it's just like I don't know here comes

747
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,280
not that I'm upset at him but Seth

748
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,280
Rogan he's just doing his voice.

749
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,280
What's the point?

750
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,280
To me the word like Robin Williams

751
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:00,280
makes sense because he's in

752
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:02,280
some other world he could have been purely

753
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,480
a super over guy if he hadn't done all the other things.

754
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,480
But like one of those

755
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,480
boring DreamWorks movies

756
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,480
like Roe Del Dorado or something

757
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,480
as Brad Pitt. Brad Pitt who I think

758
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,480
we all like in many things

759
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,480
but I'm not like his voice

760
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,480
of course.

761
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,480
It's great dynamic voice

762
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,480
only removed from his

763
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,480
physicality. It's like don't take away those eyes

764
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,480
please. Yeah come on.

765
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,480
That is also

766
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,480
that is the name I was going to

767
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,680
I just started saying that

768
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,680
because I think Megamind was the peak of that

769
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,680
because it's like okay Will Ferrell is the kooky

770
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,680
villain that makes sense but it's just like

771
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,680
then the superhero is Brad

772
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,680
Pitt. He's in that too.

773
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,680
I think that's him but his voice

774
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,680
like you're saying yeah he just sounds like a

775
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,680
guy if you're not looking at Brad

776
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,680
Pitt it just sounds like man. A big part

777
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,680
of the Pitt package is the looks.

778
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,680
It's the looks.

779
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,680
So yeah on

780
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,680
some ways I think it's good because it

781
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,880
opened a door for like

782
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,880
I referenced the donkey

783
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,880
earlier and I

784
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,880
love Eddie Murphy. I think

785
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,880
as the donkey did I ever tell you the story?

786
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,880
I took the same niece I took to

787
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,880
Country Bears. I took to Shrek 2.

788
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,880
It was like the last 20 minutes and you know

789
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,880
in the last 20 minutes of a movie when things

790
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,880
are wrapping up you're actually kind of a lot of

791
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,880
times relieved. You're just like okay.

792
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,880
The movie is wrapping up. I gotta go home.

793
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,880
I remember I was like oh it's wrapping up.

794
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,880
Donkey was making me laugh so hard

795
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:29,080
I was like I'm gonna have to wait

796
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,080
another three years

797
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,080
until Donkey comes back.

798
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:35,080
I was so sad

799
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:37,080
so there's times

800
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,080
that I do like it guys but then

801
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:41,080
there's times where it's just not

802
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:43,080
as necessary and you wish a Billy West

803
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:45,080
could have. Sure. It must have been a tough decade

804
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:47,080
for you. We haven't had Donkey in a while.

805
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:49,080
It's in the worst years

806
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:51,080
of your life. I'm all referencing

807
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:53,080
things that happened like a year

808
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:55,080
year and a half after 9-11.

809
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,280
We needed the most

810
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:59,280
cheering up.

811
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,280
Shrek. The first

812
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,280
Shrek was summer 2001.

813
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:05,280
Is that the end of the 20th century?

814
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,280
Is that where we are?

815
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:09,280
It's like Woodstock

816
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,280
before Altamont.

817
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,280
We had Woodstock August 16th.

818
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,280
We had Shrek and Moulin Rouge.

819
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,280
Combining

820
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,280
all of pop culture.

821
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,280
Old songs. Putting them in new settings.

822
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:23,280
It flattened it all. Yeah yeah.

823
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,480
It's like a bookend.

824
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,480
And then Glitter.

825
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,480
Was Glitter right after 9-11?

826
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,480
I believe so. Wow.

827
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,480
Or was it right before? It's somewhere around there.

828
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,480
Oh Glitter was around the

829
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,480
yes because it was celebrating the time in New York

830
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,480
that was pre-9-11.

831
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,480
Yeah. Those were the tough

832
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,480
ones where

833
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,480
the New York

834
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,480
movies that were on the

835
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,480
shelf for the next like 6-7 months

836
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,480
and you'd see Twin Towers

837
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,680
you'd have to have them.

838
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,680
I had a friend

839
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,680
who, you know it's weird you're

840
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,680
with a group of people in a living room

841
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,680
and you're watching like

842
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,680
what's the

843
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,680
movie

844
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,680
Greg Metola did where they're all

845
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,680
in one car together.

846
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,680
It's not called the Car Poolers but

847
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,680
that's the idea. They're all in one car.

848
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:15,680
And they're trapped in a car.

849
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,680
But they're driving into New York and they see two Twin Towers

850
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,680
and my friend went

851
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,880
you know that's just

852
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,880
like a warm up.

853
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,880
It's a way to be like okay we all are thinking this.

854
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,880
You have to acknowledge it in a way.

855
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,880
Yeah. Just some like

856
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,880
mmm mmm mmm.

857
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,880
And you're almost like

858
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,880
you maybe have an initial reaction of being

859
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,880
mad at the movie like how

860
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,880
could they. Come on. It's an old movie.

861
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,880
You can't be mad.

862
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,880
Greg Metola you didn't know in 1995.

863
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,880
Should have known. They had

864
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,880
targets on them. Day trippers?

865
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,080
Is it Day Trippers?

866
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,080
Day Trippers. Yes.

867
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,080
I looked it up. I didn't know.

868
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,080
Wow. Crazy.

869
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:58,080
That's smart.

870
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:00,080
You guys just watch it.

871
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:02,080
We'll turn away for one shot.

872
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:04,080
Day Trippers is

873
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,080
on the compass. It's Day Trippers

874
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,080
is at the top and then the inverse of it at the south

875
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:10,080
is the 25th hour.

876
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,080
Which is only 9-11.

877
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:14,080
Which is the 25th hours so

878
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:16,080
much is about.

879
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,280
That's the yin and yang of New York representation.

880
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,280
Well you know

881
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,280
on September 11th 2001

882
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,280
the Hyperion Theater

883
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,280
was still in its infancy

884
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,280
still in its first year

885
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,280
that's where the show is at California

886
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,280
Adventure and why in 2001

887
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,280
they were showing something called

888
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:36,280
Steps in Time. Did you guys look into

889
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:38,280
Steps in Time at all?

890
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,280
I just noticed it and honestly I didn't.

891
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,280
I didn't because I know we'll have to do

892
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,280
a separate episode.

893
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,480
And then a messy cook.

894
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,480
Who knocked over the spice rack.

895
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,480
Steps in Time

896
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,480
followed by Blast, right?

897
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,480
The Power of Blast.

898
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,480
Which was like a condensed

899
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,480
Broadway like Stomp Ripple.

900
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,480
So proud

901
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,480
legacy.

902
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,480
So proud that things can blast your ass.

903
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:13,480
What was the Power of Blast?

904
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,680
It was sort of like Stomp

905
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,680
but a little different.

906
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,680
A little cooler I bet.

907
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,680
There was a part where there was a big

908
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,680
row of drum kits and

909
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,680
there was like 16 people all playing drums

910
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,680
at the same time.

911
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,680
Stuff like that.

912
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,680
I would imagine

913
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,680
if they could work out the rights

914
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,680
a Blue Man group would go over

915
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,680
very well franchising with a Disney

916
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,680
Universal Studios.

917
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,880
Universal?

918
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,880
And they replaced, they evicted

919
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,880
Nickelodeon Studios

920
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,880
where all of our favorite shows were filmed

921
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,880
as a kid.

922
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,880
Wait, down in Orlando?

923
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,880
So you know where all that and

924
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,880
Clarissa were filmed and such.

925
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,880
Yeah that's now home of the Blue Men.

926
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,880
There's an infamous home

927
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,880
video within the Rust family

928
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,880
of

929
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,880
we went to Orlando

930
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,880
in 1990

931
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,080
and so

932
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:12,080
MGM had just

933
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:14,080
opened up and Universal

934
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,080
had just opened up. I forget which one

935
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:18,080
but we went to Universal and all

936
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:20,080
it was the first few days so all

937
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:22,080
the rides were breaking down.

938
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:24,080
It was really a bummer.

939
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,080
We can't go on Confortation?

940
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,080
They didn't even have the Back to the Future ride yet

941
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,080
it was like

942
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,080
a little bit of a disappointment.

943
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,080
But we went to the Nickelodeon Studios and they had a

944
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,080
big sign up that said

945
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:38,280
Double Dare Auditions. I'm like

946
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,280
holy moly.

947
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,280
This would be a fun game to play.

948
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,280
And I get to be on TV

949
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,280
like I always dreamed

950
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,280
and they said auditions

951
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:50,280
were that day

952
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,280
but they said

953
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,280
we're not shooting until next week

954
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,280
so if you're not here next week

955
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,280
don't audition today because there's no way

956
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:00,280
you could ever be, it's a waste of our time right?

957
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,280
Yeah.

958
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,280
And I knew that

959
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,480
in my nine year old brain, I'm like

960
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,480
I know we won't be here but I still

961
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,480
was just angry at the injustice of it

962
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,480
and there's a perfectly

963
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,480
composed like

964
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,480
moment in our home video where

965
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,480
it's zoomed up on the Nickelodeon

966
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,480
Studio Splat sign

967
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,480
and it zooms out

968
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,480
and as it's zooming out it's panning down

969
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,480
and my dad's

970
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,480
my mom's narrating it

971
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,480
and she goes, my mom's holding it

972
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,480
but my dad's narrating and he goes

973
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,680
poor little Pauly

974
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,680
didn't get to be on Nickelodeon

975
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:38,680
right?

976
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,680
And I'm like marching up to the camera like

977
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,680
angry like so fussy and marching

978
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,680
and I'm like pissed off and it's like one of those

979
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,680
Sean Penn getting mad at the paparazzi

980
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,680
like don't look at me right?

981
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:50,680
You know like shove it okay?

982
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,680
So as there's

983
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,680
I put up my hand

984
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,680
and I swat the thing and

985
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,680
guys I was a good little boy too

986
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,680
I just wanted my parents

987
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,880
to like me and know that I was a good boy

988
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,880
so me doing this was crazy

989
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,880
and if you watch the video

990
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,880
I hit it and then

991
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,880
you hear my mom go ow!

992
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,880
and then you go well you hurt your mom I hope you're happy

993
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,880
and I'm like this is the worst now

994
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,880
wow!

995
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,880
I'm a monster!

996
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,880
and then the camera pans over to me at the

997
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,880
and this is the very end

998
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,880
and I met with a choice which is

999
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,880
like the camera's on me now

1000
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,880
I'm so hot with anger I'm mad that I hit the

1001
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,880
camera I can either

1002
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,880
say I'm sorry

1003
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,880
and cry and be embarrassed of that

1004
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,880
or stand my ground and let them know no I'm

1005
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,880
mad so when the camera went on

1006
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,880
me I like stuck my tongue out

1007
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,880
but if you like freeze framed it and

1008
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,880
did like scene by

1009
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,880
shot by shot progression

1010
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,880
as soon as like the tip of my tongue

1011
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,880
starts coming out of my mouth I've already

1012
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,880
like started crying cause

1013
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,880
I'm regretting having stuck my tongue out

1014
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,880
so it's like this perfect like

1015
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,880
ahhhh!

1016
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,880
wow

1017
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,880
a lot of emotions get stirred up

1018
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,880
when you're at theme parks guys

1019
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,880
absolutely yes as you're telling

1020
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,880
this I am having memories

1021
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,880
of like a moment of friction

1022
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,880
or a moment of frustration at theme parks

1023
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,880
where everything is so loud and heightened

1024
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,880
as a kid it just gets heightened

1025
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,880
a million times I think so because it's also

1026
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,880
you're just dealing with

1027
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,880
the things that's so frustrating

1028
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,880
when you're a child which is like

1029
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,880
wait wait wait wait

1030
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,880
wait wait wait wait wait wait

1031
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,880
and you're just like how am I gonna just find a way

1032
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,880
to kill off boredom here

1033
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,880
and so you're you know

1034
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,880
you wait and then you get the ride it's awesome

1035
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,880
but then I

1036
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,880
think it's that and then also just like

1037
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,880
it's like it still happens when

1038
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,880
I go to Disneyland or go to a theme park which is

1039
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,880
like in your mind you're like the whole reason I'm

1040
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,880
here is for fun and so

1041
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,880
it's a little like I don't know if you guys ever read

1042
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,880
that Jonathan Franzen book Freedom

1043
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,880
but he describes freedom

1044
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,880
as he's like freedom

1045
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,880
is this idea that's

1046
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,880
great but as soon as you don't get

1047
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,880
everything that was promised by it

1048
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,880
it's the first thing that instantly sours I'm paraphrasing

1049
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,880
but it's like the same thing with Disneyland

1050
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,880
it's the happiest place on earth

1051
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,880
if I experience 10%

1052
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,880
unhappiness this whole thing's

1053
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,880
fucked you know so I think

1054
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,880
that was a little bit of the yes you're supposed to be

1055
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,880
having a perfect day and

1056
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,880
I can only imagine for parents too like

1057
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,880
if your kid picks

1058
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,880
this day to freak out

1059
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,880
what a sin that you threw the

1060
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,880
money down I didn't even think about

1061
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,880
the right the parent side

1062
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,880
which is just like

1063
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,880
I'm exhausted

1064
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,880
and you're making this difficult

1065
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,880
for me

1066
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,880
let us have fun that you're throwing a tantrum that you can't

1067
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,880
be a double dairy dork

1068
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,880
I had two older sisters

1069
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,880
I'm sure for my two older sisters

1070
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,880
and my parents it was like the funniest thing in the world

1071
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,880
dorks getting so upset

1072
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,880
about not getting messy on

1073
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,880
TV

1074
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,880
what a miserable life you can only be

1075
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,880
in Universal Studios once and then not

1076
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,880
also in turn be a TV

1077
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,880
star instantly

1078
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,880
you must be as a parent you must

1079
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,880
be like constantly fighting the urge

1080
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,880
to laugh and laugh at

1081
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,880
your deeply upset child

1082
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,880
it must be so funny

1083
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,880
at all this

1084
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,880
little ball of emotions

1085
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,880
punching and putting tongues out

1086
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,880
yeah it's also yeah

1087
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,880
when you can

1088
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,880
their

1089
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,880
frustrations match yours then it's

1090
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,880
like you're like oh I'm not too far from

1091
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,880
being a baby all the time

1092
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,880
still a baby in me

1093
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,880
two degrees away from being that at all points

1094
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,880
so what's at the Nickelodeon where do they

1095
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,880
they have a Blue Man Group theater

1096
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,880
separate ticketed

1097
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,880
kind of like yeah

1098
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,880
so you could never be

1099
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,880
on Double Dare

1100
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,880
that dream is over

1101
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,880
I don't think it was Universal's call I feel like Viacom

1102
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,880
was like oh the lease has

1103
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,880
ended they move the time

1104
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,880
wait they move the time capsule remember the time

1105
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,880
capsule yes they moved it a couple times

1106
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,880
now yeah but isn't it in the hotel

1107
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,880
no no now it's in Burbank

1108
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,880
not far from here at Nickelodeon

1109
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,880
yeah now they have an actual place

1110
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:16,880
where people work and not like a theme park attraction

1111
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,880
is it right over is it the one over by the

1112
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,880
car dealership yeah

1113
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,880
it was put down in 1990

1114
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,880
right so when is the

1115
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,880
so yeah was it 50 years or was

1116
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,880
92 because I remember

1117
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,880
watching it and thinking like boy I'd like

1118
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:32,880
to see that thing open it's a shame I won't

1119
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,880
live that long

1120
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,880
I did the math and I thought there was no

1121
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,880
way I would be alive at

1122
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,880
57

1123
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,880
well that was foolish

1124
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,880
at the time but now that we're getting

1125
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,880
closer it might not be that

1126
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,880
wrong oh yeah

1127
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,880
we'll be underwater

1128
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,880
and then Nickelodeon's two tied capsules

1129
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,880
will float by and we're like oh yeah

1130
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,880
it might be it's

1131
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,880
the last remnants of humanity

1132
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,880
that game boy in there

1133
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,880
that old game boy

1134
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,880
the moon boots I think

1135
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,880
I think I thought of it

1136
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,880
because there were so many different promotions where you would

1137
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,880
get like a free thing or you go on like that

1138
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,880
KB Toys shopping spree

1139
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,880
in my mind like whoever opened it

1140
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,880
was gonna just get all that free stuff and I was just

1141
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:18,880
jealous of whoever opened it

1142
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,880
well they're gonna get that game boy and

1143
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,880
probably Mark Summers kid who's gonna get it

1144
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,880
anyway

1145
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:26,880
jealous

1146
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,880
somebody steals it that is what will happen

1147
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,880
we should steal it yeah

1148
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:32,880
but I was there for that opening that summer of

1149
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,880
MGM and I remember going to see

1150
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,880
Muppets live

1151
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,880
there was people in costumes

1152
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,880
oh that's right oh the not the puppet show

1153
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,880
but the costume character

1154
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,880
Muppet size they were man sized

1155
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,880
it was beaded

1156
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:48,880
yeah

1157
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,880
I remember Miss Piggy came out

1158
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,880
with a pink feather boa and saying

1159
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:54,880
personality you know

1160
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:56,880
I've got personality

1161
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,880
personality and a pink feather

1162
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:00,880
like blew off

1163
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,880
her feather boa and landed

1164
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:04,880
at my feet and I picked it

1165
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:06,880
up and I held it in my palm and I was like

1166
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,880
I will never lose this

1167
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:10,880
and I did

1168
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,880
I thought like

1169
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,880
this is gonna be very important

1170
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,880
I have a more upsetting version

1171
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,880
of like free show piece

1172
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,880
that I got at a theme park

1173
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,880
Six Flags Great Adventure

1174
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,880
had a lethal weapon boat

1175
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:26,880
like stunt show

1176
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:28,880
and at the end of the show they were

1177
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,880
giving out the spit of bullet

1178
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:32,880
casings to kids

1179
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,880
so

1180
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:36,880
the prop department of the crow

1181
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:38,880
good you need these

1182
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:40,880
those are in a locker

1183
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:42,880
those are in an evidence locker somewhere

1184
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:44,880
yeah just blanks bullet casings from blank

1185
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,880
cause like the casing is the same

1186
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,880
whether it's a blank or a bullet

1187
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:50,880
it's probably somewhere in my mom's house

1188
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,880
in a box somewhere yeah

1189
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,880
gotta find that bullet casing

1190
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,880
at the end of the world you'll be like

1191
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:58,880
trying to find that bullet casing to

1192
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:00,880
put some ammunition in it to save

1193
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:02,880
oh yeah

1194
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:04,880
I know it was here somewhere

1195
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:06,880
to protect your time

1196
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,880
capsule

1197
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:10,880
and then I think

1198
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:12,880
at that Universalist I saw the Ghostbusters

1199
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:14,880
live show just to bring it back to the

1200
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,880
live shows and I think that was a

1201
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:18,880
mouthy lip-synchy

1202
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:20,880
one yeah I think so

1203
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,880
it was kind of 50-50 yeah live actors and some

1204
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,880
projection we haven't talked about that

1205
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:26,880
one yet that's a good

1206
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,880
it was pretty cool I remember the set being real

1207
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:30,880
fun and

1208
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,880
you said something to this extent

1209
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,880
but like I think

1210
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,880
when you're a kid and you

1211
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,880
love movies and TV

1212
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,880
shows and entertainment so much

1213
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,880
the exciting thing is just the

1214
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,880
whatever it says it's just like

1215
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:46,880
the immersive thing of just like oh I'm in

1216
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,880
a movie right now and so

1217
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,880
I remember Ghostbusters

1218
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:52,880
really

1219
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:54,880
that show I'm not even the biggest

1220
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:56,880
Ghostbusters fan but it was just like I remember

1221
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,880
thinking like oh man I'm seeing actual

1222
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:00,880
Ghostbusters costumes and I'm seeing

1223
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:02,880
actual you know slimmers

1224
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,880
sure

1225
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:06,880
but the

1226
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:08,880
Aladdin show might I think

1227
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:10,880
of all the live and I did see the Bill

1228
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:12,880
and Ted ones and those are great

1229
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:14,880
I'm seeing the hats

1230
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,880
and the air guitars

1231
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:18,880
the real air guitars the vests

1232
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:20,880
the vests, the dancing Mitt Romney

1233
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,880
I remember

1234
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:24,880
I went to a

1235
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:26,880
I think

1236
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,880
Paul Abdul came out and they sang

1237
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,880
that bitch is crazy

1238
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,880
oh my god

1239
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,880
that bitch is crazy

1240
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:36,880
people were not super forgiving

1241
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:38,880
of there was Brittany

1242
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:40,880
in that there was a lot of like it's bald

1243
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:42,880
Brittany she's gone

1244
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,880
going psycho watch out

1245
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:46,880
she had a chainsaw

1246
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:48,880
I think that's something that happened in that

1247
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:50,880
the treatment of Britney Spears in the media over the last

1248
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:52,880
25 years

1249
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:54,880
that stuff was only like

1250
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,880
wasn't that all within the deck

1251
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:58,880
maybe like 2006 or so

1252
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,880
yeah I guess

1253
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,880
she's fat and looks like shit and she's crazy

1254
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,880
people are so off

1255
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,880
I remember that driving me crazy cause

1256
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:08,880
it was a little like

1257
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:10,880
somebody starting

1258
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:12,880
a fire in a field and then driving

1259
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:14,880
five miles away and being like

1260
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:16,880
can you believe this fire

1261
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:18,880
we all were responsible

1262
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:20,880
for Brittany's meltdown

1263
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:22,880
and I would be like

1264
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:24,880
we don't get it two ways we don't get to destroy her

1265
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:26,880
and then have fun about her

1266
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:28,880
there was like a two week period where she

1267
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:30,880
in the late 90s early 2000s

1268
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:32,880
where she was like cool look at this new pop star

1269
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,880
she's not the villain

1270
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:36,880
and then two weeks later

1271
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:38,880
it just became

1272
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:40,880
the media just made her a villain

1273
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:42,880
for over a decade

1274
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:44,880
for one reason or another

1275
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,880
and then that timberlake still gets to walk around

1276
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:48,880
cock of the walk

1277
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,880
not being funny

1278
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:52,880
doing celebrity voices

1279
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,880
in animated movies

1280
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:56,880
making everyone at the super bowl mad

1281
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,880
twice, twice

1282
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:00,880
oh you're right

1283
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:02,880
and he got off

1284
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:04,880
mad and then indifferent

1285
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:06,880
indifferent last year

1286
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:08,880
those are the funniest video where like

1287
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:10,880
I think that thing was well produced for

1288
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:12,880
TV and if you're watching with all the camera

1289
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:14,880
moves it was kind of exciting but then when somebody

1290
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:16,880
posted on Twitter here's what it was like

1291
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:18,880
in the stadium

1292
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:20,880
very far away and it's just really

1293
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:22,880
they aren't playing

1294
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:24,880
to the audience

1295
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:26,880
it's there at all

1296
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,880
you see all these grips just move chunks of equipment around

1297
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:30,880
go go move it move it

1298
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:32,880
my favorite is when they have those people

1299
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:34,880
like they pay the people to be

1300
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:36,880
excited because they send all those people

1301
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:38,880
out on the field every year

1302
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:40,880
every year it's the same thing and if you were like just watching it

1303
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:42,880
casually you probably wouldn't notice

1304
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:44,880
be like oh yeah there's an audience there but it's like people like

1305
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:46,880
unnaturally

1306
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:48,880
moving their arms in a way that like no one

1307
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:50,880
in a concert even like Beatlemania

1308
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,880
that would look strange in the front row

1309
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:54,880
of people at a Beatles concert

1310
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:56,880
like the America's Funniest Home videos

1311
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:58,880
I remember that audience

1312
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:00,880
seemed like gassed or something

1313
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:02,880
because they were just like out of their

1314
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:04,880
minds just laughing

1315
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:06,880
when I first moved to LA I went to a taping of

1316
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:08,880
America's Funniest Home videos and they were

1317
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,880
playing Hey Ya during the like warm up

1318
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:12,880
period oh yeah and I was like dancing

1319
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:14,880
in my seat to Hey Ya and I looked over

1320
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,880
and I saw Tom Bergeron like

1321
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:18,880
walk over to our producer like point at me

1322
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:20,880
I was like oh boy what's going on

1323
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:22,880
and then the producer

1324
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:24,880
came up and was like Tom wants you to come down and dance

1325
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:28,880
I was like okay

1326
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:30,880
it was like the audience warm up

1327
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:32,880
thing he was like come here we're gonna play

1328
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:34,880
that song I saw you cutting some moon why don't you dance

1329
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:36,880
out here and like a monkey

1330
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:38,880
boy I'm like yeah sure and I started dancing

1331
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:40,880
and then he was like let's make this like a

1332
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:42,880
commercial spot

1333
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:44,880
so then they were like watch America's

1334
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:46,880
Funniest Home videos tonight you might see

1335
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:48,880
something like this and that pan around like dancing

1336
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:50,880
crazy they never

1337
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:52,880
aired it but I do

1338
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:54,880
have on videotape the episode that our friends

1339
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:56,880
are in and we're all like going out

1340
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:58,880
of our minds with over gesturing

1341
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:00,880
and like laughing too hard and Tom

1342
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:02,880
Bergeron will say so we'll turn to each other like

1343
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:04,880
shake our heads like oh can you believe this guy you know

1344
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:06,880
but

1345
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:08,880
the saddest part of this story

1346
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:10,880
is after it was done

1347
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:12,880
I was with my friends

1348
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:14,880
I'm still friends with you know Campbell and Mike

1349
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:16,880
Cassidy and we were walking out and I was like

1350
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:18,880
this was like three weeks

1351
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:20,880
I'd been living in LA I was like

1352
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:22,880
if I walk out here I'm blowing an opportunity

1353
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,880
I could get a

1354
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:26,880
writing job out of this

1355
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:28,880
so I like

1356
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:30,880
we were out of

1357
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:32,880
the studio I turned back

1358
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:34,880
around and I walked up to like

1359
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:36,880
a crew guy and I was like

1360
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:38,880
I was the guy who danced

1361
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:40,880
I've actually thought

1362
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:42,880
before I could write some of the

1363
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:44,880
jokes for America's funniest

1364
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:46,880
videos do you know

1365
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:48,880
who I could talk to about that

1366
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:50,880
and he was like I don't know anything about

1367
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:52,880
that man I was like okay

1368
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:54,880
I walked out

1369
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:58,880
Wow you can't

1370
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:00,880
knock the hustle though

1371
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:02,880
some of the NSDTK

1372
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:04,880
guys wrote on America's funniest

1373
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:06,880
videos and so I didn't know that

1374
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:08,880
yeah

1375
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:10,880
what was their process

1376
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:12,880
so they walked up to some guy

1377
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:16,880
they walked up to a better guy

1378
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:18,880
or the same guy he just didn't

1379
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:20,880

00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,880

1388
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:40,880
anything about that pal

1389
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:42,880
what was your name again

1390
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:46,880
I had some Randy

1391
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:48,880
ideas

1392
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:50,880
yes I don't know I don't know

1393
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:52,880
anything about that

1394
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:54,880
it's done man

1395
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,880
what do you think I'm gonna do with this

1396
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:58,880
sure sure

1397
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:00,880
oh my god wow that's incredible

1398
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:02,880
the Hyperion Theater

1399
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,880
the Hyperion Theater I was saying

1400
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:06,880
we're going through a lot of pop culture history

1401
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:08,880
and I realized since we haven't talked about

1402
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:10,880
the Hyperion Theater for any reason yet

1403
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:12,880
we have to talk about

1404
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:14,880
a major piece of history

1405
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:16,880
with major talent that happened on that stage

1406
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:18,880
and that is Kelsey Grammer's

1407
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:20,880
fall

1408
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:22,880
that's where it took place

1409
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:24,880
where it happened yes

1410
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:26,880
a lot of people don't remember that

1411
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:28,880
wow

1412
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:30,880
the reason that you know

1413
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:32,880
that it was at Disneyland somewhere

1414
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:34,880
is that the joke that he is telling

1415
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:36,880
before he falls is something

1416
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,880
you just catch a little snippet of it but like

1417
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:40,880
it's a small world pretending to be

1418
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:42,880
a UN interpreter oh dear lord

1419
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:48,880
he's 98%

1420
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:50,880
done with the joke he said oh dear

1421
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:52,880
lord that is so profane I hope he

1422
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:54,880
apologized for the profanity

1423
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:56,880
that he said in front of those people

1424
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:58,880
that's the sweetest thing he's like

1425
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:00,880
forgive me for my

1426
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:02,880
vulgarity

1427
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:04,880
you said oh lord

1428
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:06,880
although the sound cuts out in the video

1429
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:08,880
that you can see of it and he apparently did

1430
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:10,880
say oh shit

1431
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:12,880
but that was cut out of what we

1432
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:14,880
all have seen from it

1433
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:16,880
yeah yeah

1434
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:18,880
if you analyze the tape

1435
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:20,880
so that little section that he

1436
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:22,880
falls down in we see

1437
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:24,880
that little section all the time when we watch

1438
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:26,880
Aladdin we do and what happened

1439
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:28,880
was if you look at a picture of

1440
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:30,880
the stage from any performance

1441
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:32,880
of Aladdin it's all weird and

1442
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:34,880
carved up because it's like starbursts

1443
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:36,880
and the reason he fell

1444
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:38,880
it was not a flat stage

1445
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:40,880
he knows what stages are like

1446
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:42,880
oh he's killed so many

1447
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:44,880
that was the problem he's so accustomed

1448
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:46,880
yes but he's never performed

1449
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:48,880
on a starburst stage before

1450
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:50,880
he didn't fall into the pit where the genie comes out

1451
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:52,880
of did he?

1452
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:54,880
no he's like between

1453
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:56,880
star shapes

1454
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:58,880
Robin Williams did

1455
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:00,880
he fell into the pit the genie came out of

1456
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:06,880
what happened?

1457
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:08,880
genie you're free

1458
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:10,880
I don't think that's what happened

1459
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:12,880
I don't think that's a apt way to describe that

1460
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:14,880
there's the

1461
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:16,880
thing when he shoots out at the top

1462
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:18,880
and then when Jafar comes out later that wasn't where

1463
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:20,880
he fell

1464
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:22,880
he would fall onto the Jafar puppet

1465
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:24,880
that was just waiting down there

1466
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:26,880
he landed on the snake

1467
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:28,880
puppet what if he landed on the snake and then the snake

1468
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:30,880
shot up shooting Kelsey Grammer

1469
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:32,880
into the ceiling of the Hyperion

1470
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:34,880
oh dear lord

1471
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:36,880
oh dear lord

1472
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:40,880
now he fell

1473
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:42,880
front of the stage and here's what's

1474
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:44,880
I'd never heard him speak about

1475
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:46,880
this video but on YouTube you can

1476
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:48,880
look up him talking on a Jim

1477
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:50,880
Norton radio program of some kind

1478
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:52,880
and he tells the rest of the

1479
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:54,880
story and they're like hey that video is

1480
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:56,880
real funny man and he's like yes yes

1481
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:58,880
I know and people enjoy it

1482
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:00,880
you don't realize is that I

1483
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:02,880
the side of the stage split

1484
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:04,880
my entire leg open and

1485
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:06,880
I performed the rest

1486
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:08,880
I did the rest of my presentation but I did it

1487
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:10,880
with I was bleeding

1488
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:12,880
through my pants

1489
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:14,880
because it is a

1490
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:16,880
hard angle it's like a 10 degree angle

1491
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:18,880
and he so it

1492
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:20,880
did tear his leg

1493
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:22,880
open when he went to the hospital

1494
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,880
he did the before he did like the rest of his

1495
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:26,880
half hour or whatever and then straight to the hospital

1496
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:28,880
where they said this is like

1497
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:30,880
worse than motorcycle accidents we've seen

1498
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:32,880
oh my god and he also

1499
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:34,880
and they're like so you know like what were you thinking

1500
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:36,880
when that happened they're trying to make it funny and he's

1501
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:38,880
like well I thought about my grandmother who

1502
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:40,880
when she broke her hip

1503
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:42,880
it was the beginning of the end

1504
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:44,880
I thought that I had broken my hip

1505
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:46,880
yeah it was like a terrible

1506
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:48,880
thing for it was a very

1507
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:50,880
grim fall

1508
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:52,880
the story I had to heard about it was like I think

1509
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:54,880
on the office they

1510
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:56,880
wanted to use the clip they needed a clip

1511
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:58,880
of a funny internet thing

1512
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:00,880
and they were like well

1513
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:02,880
they went to the people to

1514
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:04,880
Kelsey Grammers people and they're like

1515
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:06,880
we'll let you use it you just

1516
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:08,880
have to pay us and they're like okay how much

1517
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:10,880
do you want and they're like

1518
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:12,880
half a million dollars

1519
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:14,880
it was like a number that

1520
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:16,880
you would never pay because

1521
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:18,880
Kelsey Grammer must have been like yeah I don't

1522
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:20,880
we don't need that out there anymore

1523
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:22,880
Niles will have a field day with

1524
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:24,880
this he said

1525
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:28,880
do you think that was off limits to

1526
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:30,880
joke about like

1527
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:32,880
when the genie con like the next time

1528
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:34,880
they did Aladdin

1529
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:36,880
oh yeah probably

1530
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:38,880
it's like when William Shatner got roasted

1531
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:40,880
they were like no dead

1532
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:42,880
wife jokes no wife drowning jokes

1533
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:44,880
that was like on the back wall in the

1534
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:46,880
Hyperion theater was like no

1535
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,880
Grammer jokes and they're like what

1536
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:50,880
we can't do wordplay

1537
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:52,880
now I feel like

1538
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:54,880
G-R-A-M-M-E-R

1539
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:56,880
not M-M-A-R

1540
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:58,880
the genie got fired for doing a Kelsey Grammer joke

1541
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:00,880
once I do feel

1542
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:02,880
I feel like a real genie because I'm in shackles

1543
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:04,880
yeah

1544
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:06,880
I remember you know the

1545
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:08,880
genie shackles come off at the end of Aladdin

1546
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:10,880
I remember

1547
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:12,880
seeing the movie and then seeing a

1548
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:14,880
TV spot for the movie

1549
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:16,880
and they show a last scene where he's like

1550
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:18,880
we're going to Disney or something like that

1551
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:20,880
and he doesn't have the shackles

1552
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:22,880
on in that briefest

1553
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:24,880
moment I was like they've spoiled the movie

1554
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:26,880
they've ruined it

1555
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:28,880
people now know that he's not insane

1556
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,880
if it was a Marvel

1557
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:32,880
movie now they would have put the things

1558
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:34,880
on him because they do that they

1559
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:36,880
digitally put stuff on like

1560
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:38,880
in the trailers to fool you

1561
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:40,880
so that is absolutely

1562
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:42,880
something they would have done to not spoil it

1563
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:44,880
like they put in like

1564
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:46,880
Thor was missing an eye at the end of

1565
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:48,880
the Ragnarok and they put his eye back in in the

1566
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:50,880
trailer so you wouldn't know that he lost an eye

1567
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:52,880
in the movie I feel like that's partly

1568
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:54,880
because the people

1569
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:56,880
who are in charge of making decisions like now

1570
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:58,880
are people like us who when they were kids

1571
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:00,880
they saw Aladdin was ruined for them

1572
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:02,880
when Roger Rabbit was nominated

1573
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:04,880
for the Oscars I remember they did this cute

1574
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:06,880
thing where like when we come back it's

1575
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:08,880
the best animated short and they

1576
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:10,880
cut to a shot of

1577
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:12,880
the audience and it was like normal

1578
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:14,880
person two empty seats

1579
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:16,880
that they Roger Rabbit like Mickey

1580
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:18,880
and Minnie Mouse sitting there like waiting for the

1581
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:20,880
Oscars get announced

1582
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:22,880
and then two seat fillers

1583
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:24,880
came and sat down where

1584
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:26,880
the animated characters were sitting there was this

1585
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:28,880
like weird combination

1586
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:30,880
of human

1587
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:32,880
like my lip on it

1588
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:34,880
it's like

1589
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:36,880
what the fuck

1590
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:38,880
like they were

1591
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:40,880
like this woman sat

1592
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:42,880
on a Minnie drawing it was so

1593
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:44,880
weird like they got in a

1594
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:46,880
flying machine

1595
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:48,880
kill me kill us

1596
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:50,880
kill us put us out of our misery

1597
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:54,880
that's smart but that would have never happened

1598
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:56,880
if somebody what I'm saying our

1599
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:58,880
age would have been

1600
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:00,880
running things they're like come on man

1601
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:02,880
I don't want to promote nightmares

1602
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:04,880
for people did you see the Aladdin

1603
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:06,880
remake yes we did

1604
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:08,880
we did an episode on our Patreon

1605
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:10,880
oh I guess that one

1606
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:12,880
yeah just tying up

1607
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:14,880
some loose ends from that

1608
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:16,880
so

1609
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:18,880
well a couple of things the ending

1610
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:20,880
of the actual of the original Aladdin

1611
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:22,880
means the genie is free

1612
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:24,880
but he still has all his

1613
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:26,880
powers so they have just unleashed

1614
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:28,880
a mad god on the world

1615
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:30,880
that they cannot

1616
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:32,880
control anymore so it's good he's benevolent

1617
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:34,880
the movie kind of

1618
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:36,880
the live action one it's a little cleaner

1619
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:38,880
so the lyric change

1620
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:40,880
this was a thing that we

1621
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:42,880
touched on briefly but we didn't have I didn't have

1622
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:44,880
it in front of me in the

1623
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:46,880
original animated Aladdin release

1624
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:48,880
there were the lyrics

1625
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:50,880
in Arabian Nights

1626
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:52,880
where they cut off your ear

1627
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:54,880
they don't like your face

1628
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:56,880
it's barbaric but hey it's home

1629
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:58,880
where the heat is in

1630
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:00,880
where the sand is immense

1631
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:02,880
and the heat is intense

1632
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:04,880
so what's the it's where it's

1633
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:06,880
so then for the VHS they change it to

1634
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:08,880
where it's flat and immense and the heat is intense

1635
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:10,880
it's barbaric but hey

1636
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:12,880
it's home and I've got a news article

1637
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:14,880
at the time people are like thank you for

1638
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:16,880
changing the cutting the ear off thing

1639
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:18,880
you still have the word

1640
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:20,880
barbaric in there we would like

1641
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:22,880
you to change that and Disney representatives

1642
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:24,880
says that line will not be changed

1643
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:28,880
so they missed that

1644
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:30,880
and of course live action Aladdin

1645
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:32,880
introduced a new character we did

1646
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:34,880
neglected to talk about that is not in the stage

1647
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:36,880
musical or the animated one Euro Trash

1648
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:38,880
Prince

1649
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:40,880
Euro Trash Prince

1650
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:42,880
another prince in

1651
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:44,880
the movie before Prince

1652
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:46,880
Ali shows up

1653
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:48,880
Raja behind the back of his pants

1654
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:50,880
yes so in the

1655
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:52,880
new movie he's like a German like

1656
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:54,880
this kind of potty boy

1657
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:56,880
like sort of thing

1658
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:58,880
that was weird that was

1659
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:00,880
a weird addition

1660
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:02,880
that's a little odd

1661
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:04,880
Raja bite his pants

1662
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:06,880
I don't think so

1663
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:08,880
you don't get the heart boxers

1664
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:10,880
isn't that the heart boxers

1665
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:12,880
I love heart boxers

1666
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:14,880
I call those TV underwear

1667
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:16,880
I thought boxers

1668
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:18,880
hearts are not

1669
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:20,880
I thought that was TV underwear

1670
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:22,880
because I always saw me in briefs and my dad in briefs

1671
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:24,880
I didn't think boxers

1672
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:26,880
I thought that was like a comic

1673
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:28,880
conceit

1674
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:30,880
or to get around the fact that like they can't show

1675
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:32,880
guys walking around in briefs

1676
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:34,880
that's probably partly it too

1677
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:36,880
that it disguises

1678
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:38,880
things a little bit more

1679
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:40,880
it was like illegal it was an FCC mandate

1680
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:42,880
to put our son

1681
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:44,880
I think in the Will Ferrell era

1682
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:46,880
comedy

1683
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:48,880
it went from boxers to briefs

1684
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:50,880
what's funnier to see on screen

1685
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:52,880
uh huh uh huh

1686
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:54,880
we used to be love the hearts on

1687
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:56,880
boxers guys but now

1688
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:58,880
we like briefs that's how hard and

1689
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:00,880
do you think

1690
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:02,880
you've been naked

1691
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:04,880
in things to some extent haven't you

1692
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:06,880
I have a I'm in my

1693
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:08,880
briefs in I Love You

1694
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:10,880
Beth Cooper I'm wearing

1695
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:12,880
Spider-Man underwear

1696
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:14,880
and they had to go through

1697
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:16,880
Marvel to clear that

1698
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:18,880
the only way it was cleared was because

1699
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:20,880
Chris Columbus was making

1700
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:22,880
producing a fantastic four movie at the time

1701
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:24,880
so we had enough of a connection

1702
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:26,880
that they allowed it to happen

1703
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:28,880
like the second the Jessica Alba ones

1704
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:30,880
those yeah yeah that weird

1705
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:32,880
you could not have worn Spider-Man underwear

1706
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:34,880
yeah because they had the logo

1707
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:36,880
and I still have those

1708
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:38,880
if you guys would have spelled them

1709
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:40,880
please

1710
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:42,880
that's why we brought you here

1711
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:44,880
you have to ask

1712
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:46,880
wow wow

1713
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:48,880
that's a real throwback then to not be in

1714
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:50,880
like to be in comical

1715
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:52,880
underwear as opposed to

1716
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:54,880
on Love That Was a conversation I chose to wear

1717
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:56,880
boxers in a scene and we talked about how

1718
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:58,880
isn't it funnier to see

1719
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:00,880
somebody in briefs and then the

1720
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:02,880
conversation of but are we

1721
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:04,880
past that have we seen briefs too much

1722
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:06,880
should we do

1723
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:08,880
what's the new comedy underwear

1724
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:10,880
post briefs

1725
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:12,880
briefs world

1726
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:16,880
what do you think we live more in post 9-eleven

1727
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:18,880
or post briefs

1728
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:20,880
briefs I think

1729
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:22,880
for sure I think it's briefs

1730
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:24,880
the one we live with more every day now

1731
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:26,880
I have not seen the remake so I don't know about

1732
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:28,880
Euro Trash Prince but

1733
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:30,880
sounds like a character I

1734
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:32,880
I have still been describing Aladdin

1735
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:34,880
as strangely okay

1736
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:36,880
like strangely okay strangely

1737
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:38,880
as some parts I'd like it exists

1738
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:40,880
that'd be my poll

1739
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:42,880
quote on the poster

1740
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:44,880
they hold up a

1741
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:46,880
parchment at some point that has the date of the

1742
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:48,880
movie on it

1743
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:54,880
we won't go down a hole guys

1744
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:56,880
but when

1745
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:58,880
I remember sitting in the theater with

1746
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:00,880
The Last Jedi I was like

1747
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:02,880
ancient Jedi text

1748
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:04,880
alright

1749
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:06,880
I'm not even a big Star Wars fan like

1750
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:08,880
others you know but I was just like

1751
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:10,880
oh so these based on books

1752
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:12,880
what this world

1753
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:14,880
has paper

1754
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:18,880
yeah like I haven't even seen paper

1755
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:20,880
in this world let alone that they have tomes

1756
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:22,880
that they refer to

1757
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:24,880
had nobody read a book in a Star Wars movie

1758
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:26,880
ever I'm trying to think there's no parchment

1759
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:28,880
ever I don't think there's any parchment

1760
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:30,880
that gets passed around

1761
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:32,880
if you go to Oga's Cantina

1762
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:34,880
and Star Wars Galaxy's Edge which I've

1763
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:36,880
done three times now it is like weird

1764
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:38,880
it's not quite paper on the menus

1765
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:40,880
it's definitely it feels a little more

1766
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:42,880
leathery or something

1767
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:44,880
so they're

1768
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:46,880
a bantha hide or something

1769
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:48,880
you know

1770
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:50,880
paper

1771
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:52,880
not some bantha hide they're huge

1772
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:00,880
that would be perfect for the Aladdin musical

1773
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:02,880
it might be too

1774
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:04,880
too specific

1775
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:06,880
the conglomerations

1776
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:08,880
would be too much

1777
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:10,880
Star Wars land that would be perfect

1778
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:12,880
they would reference things in park as well

1779
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:14,880
that would get a big laugh

1780
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:16,880
so what's in the Hyperion theater now

1781
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:18,880
let's replace the Frozen

1782
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:20,880
is it the Hyperion

1783
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:22,880
does Olaf do topical

1784
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:24,880
no he does not

1785
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:26,880
he does not it's a longer show than

1786
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:28,880
Aladdin it's pretty good

1787
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:30,880
is it a full hour

1788
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:32,880
15 or so it's like an hour

1789
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:34,880
because Aladdin is 40 was 45 minutes

1790
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:36,880
that's already pretty long

1791
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:38,880
but it's an hour it's like an hour

1792
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:40,880
so instead of annoying

1793
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:42,880
pop culture jokes it's the annoying joke

1794
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:44,880
of somebody going oh

1795
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:46,880
so that just happened

1796
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:48,880
is there one of those

1797
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:50,880
in Frozen

1798
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:52,880
I love Frozen but

1799
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:54,880
it's wall to wall

1800
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:56,880
so that was a little random

1801
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:58,880
one of those

1802
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:00,880
whatever the flavor of

1803
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:02,880
what the flavor of punch up

1804
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:04,880
people is at the time

1805
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:06,880
I guess that's the things

1806
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:08,880
you don't like in Shrek and the things you like

1807
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:10,880
in Frozen

1808
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:12,880
I have a theory of

1809
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:14,880
if you really like this joke in

1810
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:16,880
alt comedy wait 10 years

1811
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:18,880
and you'll get to see it in all the commercials

1812
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:20,880
you want to see

1813
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:22,880
if you really like it

1814
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:24,880
just wait 10 years

1815
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:26,880
but

1816
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:28,880
yeah I guess I haven't seen

1817
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:30,880
the Frozen show but it wasn't

1818
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,880
the thing I did like about the Aladdin show

1819
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:34,880
was the 45 minute thing that

1820
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:36,880
for people who aren't necessarily

1821
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:38,880
right it's like a nice way

1822
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:40,880
to kind of be like

1823
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:42,880
and also the sort of line thing is

1824
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:44,880
kind of figured out you just go and it's like

1825
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:46,880
you get there you know your

1826
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:48,880
promise to see everybody goes in

1827
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:50,880
it's fairly

1828
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:52,880
it feels fairly

1829
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:54,880
it's easy it's easy

1830
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:56,880
I think it's a people of

1831
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:58,880
1984 seats

1832
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:00,880
it's a giant theater

1833
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:02,880
George Orwell would love that

1834
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:04,880
it's a giant

1835
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:06,880
there's three levels

1836
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:08,880
I've sat in all the levels multiple times

1837
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:10,880
you gotta get every

1838
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:12,880
perspective you gotta get everything

1839
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:14,880
I've sat in the very back I've sat very close

1840
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:16,880
I sat there on the

1841
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:18,880
the like invite

1842
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:20,880
only or AP

1843
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:22,880
like last show

1844
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:24,880
press conference they had

1845
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:26,880
we gotta get to that

1846
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:28,880
well there's not so much there

1847
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:30,880
but we saw the show

1848
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:32,880
and then everyone came out and talked about it

1849
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:34,880
all the actors came out and talked about it

1850
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:36,880
and like the Jasmine had been there for 10 years

1851
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:38,880
she had been

1852
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:40,880
no she had been there the whole time

1853
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:42,880
there's that thing said the Jazzman

1854
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:44,880
Billy Crystal

1855
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:46,880
Billy Crystal's Jazzman

1856
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:48,880
character they have somebody play

1857
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:50,880
he fell off he didn't break character

1858
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:52,880
it's like a man

1859
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:56,880
it is funny hearing that

1860
01:08:56,880 --> 01:08:58,880
I didn't realize it was like a cut up stage

1861
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:00,880
cause they would use it for presentations

1862
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:02,880
and stuff sometimes they would use like

1863
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:04,880
executives managed to not fall off the Kelsey Grammar

1864
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:06,880
were you up close enough to see

1865
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:08,880
the hair and blood encrusted

1866
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:10,880
parts of the Kelsey Grammar

1867
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:12,880
no, it was

1868
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:14,880
bones

1869
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:16,880
reeks of Frasier's bones

1870
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:18,880
they haven't washed it out

1871
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:20,880
did you

1872
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:22,880
now people can't see Aladdin

1873
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:24,880
but out of all the vantage points you got

1874
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:26,880
was there a prime one?

1875
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:28,880
I like sitting very close for things

1876
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:30,880
so I feel like dead center

1877
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:32,880
that's good

1878
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:34,880
maybe fifth row

1879
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:36,880
you still get a little bit of a stage picture

1880
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:38,880
were you afraid he was gonna roast ya?

1881
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:40,880
I was hoping he was gonna roast ya

1882
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:42,880
like go to Rickles you'd hope for it

1883
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:46,880
there was a Chinese man

1884
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:48,880
in the front row

1885
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:50,880
there was an older couple next to him

1886
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:52,880
they staged it, they put them there

1887
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:54,880
so Jeannie could have at them

1888
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:56,880
I've thought before

1889
01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:58,880
after how many Don Rickles shows

1890
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:00,880
how many like frail male

1891
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:02,880
egos have had to be boosted on the ride home

1892
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:04,880
by their wives

1893
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:06,880
I mean I know he makes jokes but

1894
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:08,880
you're right

1895
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:10,880
he's mean, he's mean, he shouldn't make those jokes

1896
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:12,880
just doesn't line

1897
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:14,880
you know

1898
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:16,880
some things are just too

1899
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:18,880
it wasn't just me, some of the other guys

1900
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:20,880
I don't feel bad for me

1901
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:22,880
I feel bad for the Polish people

1902
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:24,880
across America

1903
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:26,880
I just feel

1904
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:28,880
unfair to all of them

1905
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:30,880
the thing I remember being really dazzled by

1906
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:32,880
with the Aladdin show was the magic carpet

1907
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:34,880
it goes up

1908
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:36,880
and I felt some fear

1909
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:38,880
for the performers

1910
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:40,880
when they're on

1911
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:42,880
over the audience and around

1912
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:44,880
the show is actually good

1913
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:46,880
it is good

1914
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:48,880
there's sets

1915
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:50,880
when Jeannie comes down the stairs

1916
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:52,880
there's a ton of Jeannies

1917
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:54,880
friend like me

1918
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:56,880
that's awesome

1919
01:10:56,880 --> 01:10:58,880
I was afraid of those Jeannies though

1920
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:00,880
they're like doll faced men

1921
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:02,880
they're doll faced men

1922
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:04,880
and in fact

1923
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:06,880
here's all of them

1924
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:08,880
if you zoom into one of their heads

1925
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:10,880
that's pretty terrifying

1926
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:12,880
there you go

1927
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:14,880
just with the crooked eyebrows

1928
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:16,880
I have it from

1929
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:18,880
so this is the cruise ship

1930
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:20,880
version, so this is still running

1931
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:22,880
on the Disney fantasy

1932
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:24,880
sort of like a touring musical version

1933
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:26,880
scaled down a little bit

1934
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:28,880
all the numbers are still in there

1935
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:30,880
but the masks look extra terrifying

1936
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:32,880
those might be worse

1937
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:34,880
it reminds me of one of my favorite mystery science theater movies

1938
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:36,880
which is called Devil Doll

1939
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:38,880
here's a picture of Devil Doll

1940
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:40,880
I bring it up almost every time

1941
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:42,880
I open a bottle of wine

1942
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:44,880
which is a lot

1943
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:46,880
because the dummy wants to drink wine

1944
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:48,880
and there's this odd exchange

1945
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:50,880
I want some wine

1946
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:52,880
I know what wine is

1947
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:54,880
give me some

1948
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:56,880
but you're just a dummy Hugo

1949
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:58,880
almost every bottle when I open the phrase

1950
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:00,880
I know what wine is

1951
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:02,880
hold on

1952
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:04,880
wait a second

1953
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:06,880
which came first?

1954
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:08,880
Ben are you being driven to drink the wine

1955
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:10,880
because of Devil Doll

1956
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:12,880
it's all Hugo's

1957
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:14,880
Hugo hypnotized me

1958
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:16,880
those matching

1959
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:18,880
like when the

1960
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:20,880
old 60's Planet of the Apes movies

1961
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:22,880
you can see that they can't

1962
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:24,880
have the budget to fashion the best

1963
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:26,880
masks for everybody

1964
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:28,880
so if you look closely in the background

1965
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:30,880
reminds me of the end of

1966
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:32,880
Three Amigos

1967
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:34,880
remember when they come back and they all dress up as the Amigos

1968
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:36,880
so when you're first seeing it

1969
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:38,880
you think like wait how are all

1970
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:40,880
three Amigos in different spots in this village

1971
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:42,880
and shooting everywhere and then they all step out

1972
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:44,880
and they're all wearing costumes but then they reveal

1973
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:46,880
that they're kind of like shotily made

1974
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:48,880
I was like I wasn't looking at

1975
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:50,880
the shotily made ones when I was getting tricked

1976
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:56,880
I think the Hyperion though

1977
01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:58,880
you're so far away from the genies you don't

1978
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:00,880
realize oh their mouths aren't moving

1979
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:02,880
those are masks because that's the chorus

1980
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:04,880
it's a spectacle

1981
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:06,880
but at the cruise ship it's a full chorus

1982
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:08,880
and just dolls

1983
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:10,880
singing at you

1984
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:12,880
Disney corporate is finding out they're getting like 50 people

1985
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:14,880
jumping overboard each

1986
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:16,880
why is that? and then they look and they're like oh it always

1987
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:18,880
correlates with the masks

1988
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:20,880
and the fun like me number

1989
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:22,880
I think that's heightened so much by the

1990
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:24,880
movie

1991
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:26,880
and I would put this guy

1992
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:28,880
on the short list of

1993
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:30,880
the five geniuses

1994
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:32,880
who could still be alive today

1995
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:34,880
but aren't and I wish they were

1996
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:36,880
Mr. Howard Ashman guys

1997
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:38,880
who wrote all the

1998
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:40,880
I think the reason that

1999
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:42,880
we probably stayed in California

2000
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:44,880
Adventure so long is because the songs are so

2001
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:46,880
good, the songs weren't good

2002
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:48,880
but Howard Ashman

2003
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:50,880
you know he wrote Little Shop of Horrors and then obviously

2004
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:52,880
all the Little Mermaid and

2005
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:54,880
Beauty and the Beast and stuff but he

2006
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:56,880
passed away from AIDS and

2007
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:58,880
Fran Liebowitz has this line about

2008
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:00,880
AIDS took

2009
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:02,880
great artists but also took the people

2010
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:04,880
who could be the people who

2011
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:06,880
loved art and gave money

2012
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:08,880
to it they also died so that's why

2013
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:10,880
this sort of

2014
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:12,880
last 30 years has kind of been a

2015
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:14,880
turn to anti intellectualism

2016
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:16,880
or anti art because there's not enough

2017
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:18,880
people around who

2018
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:20,880
would love it and hold it up

2019
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:22,880
anyway whenever I think about that line

2020
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:24,880
I think about Howard Ashman I'm like oh man

2021
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:26,880
I wish Howard Ashman was still alive

2022
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:28,880
write music for us

2023
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:30,880
I mean like not that there's good

2024
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:32,880
there's a lot of good Disney songs past him but he

2025
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:34,880
certainly was yeah he wrote a lot of

2026
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:36,880
the good ones yeah I wonder like some of his films

2027
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:38,880
Menken still alive Menken wrote

2028
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:40,880
a new song for this

2029
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:42,880
yeah does he write with Tim Rice now

2030
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:44,880
or who does cause

2031
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:46,880
is he alone? There was some Son Heim

2032
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:48,880
no wait not Son Heim who am I

2033
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:50,880
thinking of?

2034
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:52,880
did he ever do a Disney who did

2035
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:54,880
no it's a similar name it's like Steven

2036
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:56,880
Schwartz or something oh yeah

2037
01:14:56,880 --> 01:14:58,880
yeah yeah yeah yeah

2038
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:00,880
that was a wrong stab on my part

2039
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:02,880
he did a musical I was thinking called Children of Eden

2040
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:04,880
Children of Eden? Oh my

2041
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:06,880
we are all Children of Eden

2042
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:08,880
guys so that's what that musical is

2043
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:10,880
this is where the episode turns and

2044
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:12,880
Paul has some uh a guy he wants

2045
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:14,880
to tell us a lot about

2046
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:16,880
Paul's gonna need a pamphlet now? Verses?

2047
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:18,880
I knew another guy with magical powers not a lot to say

2048
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:20,880
you guys like Mickey Mouse

2049
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:22,880
I know a pretty cool guy too

2050
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:24,880
did he write

2051
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:26,880
there's like a new Jasmine song

2052
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:28,880
as there is in the film but a different new

2053
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:30,880
Jasmine song? Menken wrote

2054
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:32,880
the to be free song that's in this one

2055
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:34,880
okay yeah which is

2056
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:36,880
interesting cause I heard that

2057
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:38,880
that she has that song because Howard Ashman's

2058
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:40,880
thing always was he writes

2059
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:42,880
really good songs about

2060
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:44,880
I'm stuck here and I wish I could be out there

2061
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:46,880
and I'm stuck here and I wish I could be out there

2062
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:48,880
I'm stuck here and I wish I could be out there

2063
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:50,880
and I think he wrote

2064
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:52,880
for the original Latin song a Jasmine song

2065
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:54,880
that was that and they

2066
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:56,880
ran out of time or they had to cut it

2067
01:15:56,880 --> 01:15:58,880
but he's so good at writing that you know

2068
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:00,880
Ariel's a

2069
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:02,880
part of your world

2070
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:04,880
and Little Shop of Horrors Somewhere that's green

2071
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:06,880
is basically note for note

2072
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:08,880
the same song

2073
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:10,880
and then Belle obviously

2074
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:12,880
it's all full of that stuff but

2075
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:14,880
yeah and like

2076
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:16,880
Lion King I remember when the music came out

2077
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:18,880
the sacrilege but I don't like

2078
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:20,880
the music for that it was like two

2079
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:22,880
like

2080
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:24,880
yuppie baby boomer

2081
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:26,880
Paul Simon-y

2082
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:28,880
Earth

2083
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:30,880
we're all on this Earth

2084
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:32,880
which they stuck there with Phil Collins

2085
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:34,880
and Sting and stuff

2086
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:36,880
that's Broadway you're getting further away from Broadway

2087
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:38,880
yeah and more into kind of like new agey kind of

2088
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:40,880
stuff and the thing that I liked about

2089
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:42,880
Howard Ashman is there is a little bit of

2090
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:44,880
a little like cervic

2091
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:46,880
can be kind of

2092
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:48,880
snotty and stuff so it added a little bit

2093
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:50,880
of a little edge

2094
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:52,880
yeah yeah yeah one of those documentaries where

2095
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:54,880
I'm trying to remember the moment I think it's is it him

2096
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:56,880
described like in Belle when

2097
01:16:56,880 --> 01:16:58,880
he's like she sings the word

2098
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:00,880
alarming okay it's in Wakey Sleepy Beauty

2099
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:02,880
when he directs Belle to sing the word alarming

2100
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:04,880
and he just says Barbara

2101
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:06,880
it's Barbara and then you hear her

2102
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:08,880
do it that way and like she didn't even need

2103
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:10,880
to audition what that would

2104
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:12,880
sound like or whatever page or arrow

2105
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:14,880
I was like oh I know exactly what that means

2106
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:16,880
it's a cool little moment yeah and that same

2107
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:18,880
moment in the documentary he comes into the booth

2108
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:20,880
and he's like trying to explain to her like

2109
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:22,880
this is how you feel in this moment and then she

2110
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:24,880
starts singing it's like oh she took the note

2111
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:26,880
and I've actually watched that and thought like

2112
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:28,880
oh that's good direction you know what he did

2113
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:30,880
he found a way to get her to sing exactly

2114
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:32,880
how she was supposed to do it wow wow

2115
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:34,880
that's really magic any like behind the scenes stuff

2116
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:36,880
where you can see the note given and then

2117
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:38,880
watch it

2118
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:40,880
so much behind the scenes stuff is a little like fluffy

2119
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:42,880
but like Jurassic Park

2120
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:44,880
is a good like him like

2121
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:46,880
talking to Joseph Mazzello and then you go

2122
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:48,880
oh yeah wait he just explained like

2123
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:50,880
exactly what makes that seem great that's funny

2124
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:52,880
because I was watching an interview with Tarantino

2125
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:54,880
and he was saying before

2126
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:56,880
he started directing he'd watched as many

2127
01:17:56,880 --> 01:17:58,880
behind the scenes stuff to see and he was like

2128
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:00,880
the person he most gelled with directorally

2129
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:02,880
was Spielberg he was like

2130
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:04,880
oh the way he talked to actors he

2131
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:06,880
was like that's how I think I should talk to actors

2132
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:08,880
wow

2133
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:10,880
yeah the

2134
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:14,880
the

2135
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:16,880
what was the Spielberg movie

2136
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:18,880
you saw that he it was

2137
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:20,880
Jurassic Park

2138
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:22,880
a little film

2139
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:24,880
have you heard of it

2140
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:26,880
I think you've heard of it

2141
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:28,880
I was trying to think that Tarantino could have seen that one but

2142
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:30,880
before you

2143
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:32,880
he was like boning up right before

2144
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:34,880
Reservoir Dogs

2145
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:36,880
he was directing something lately

2146
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:38,880
crap

2147
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:40,880
I used to work at a company pretty

2148
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:42,880
close by here that was

2149
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:44,880
I logged footage for behind the scenes

2150
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:46,880
features on DVDs

2151
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:48,880
so I would just like watch all the raw

2152
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:50,880
footage that they shot

2153
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:52,880
and I can't talk about some of the stories

2154
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:54,880
on my guys but afterwards

2155
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:56,880
I'm in there so

2156
01:18:56,880 --> 01:18:58,880
crazy things that

2157
01:18:58,880 --> 01:19:00,880
it was me and like three other guys

2158
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:02,880
and we worked the night shift

2159
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:04,880
and somebody would come in and walk in

2160
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:06,880
and be like

2161
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:08,880
you want to see Al Pacino choose somebody out

2162
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:10,880
it's like okay

2163
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:12,880
we were DMing about that one oh yeah yeah

2164
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:14,880
we were talking about Jack and Jo yeah yeah

2165
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:16,880
I already told you that one

2166
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:18,880
wait I was maybe that's an off mic I don't remember

2167
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:22,880
that's so cool

2168
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:24,880
but yeah it was a

2169
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:26,880
fun job

2170
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:28,880
yeah

2171
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:30,880
well we're I mean you know at a certain

2172
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:32,880
point we just have to start listing jokes

2173
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:34,880
yeah I'm sorry

2174
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:36,880
okay here's

2175
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:38,880
thing that always bothered me about this

2176
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:40,880
Abu cut yeah Abu cut

2177
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:42,880
not in this yeah

2178
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:44,880
but Iago pretty good puppet like he

2179
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:46,880
gets to do some fun stuff yeah

2180
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:48,880
I think they were just figuring like Abu doesn't get to talk

2181
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:50,880
so who cares because carpet

2182
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:52,880
is a person as well carpet is fun

2183
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:54,880
carpet is a hit

2184
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:56,880
we love aerial acrobatic

2185
01:19:56,880 --> 01:19:58,880
carpet like it's very

2186
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:00,880
impressive it's like I

2187
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:02,880
got the novelization on tape

2188
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:04,880
of rookie of the year

2189
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:06,880
they cut out

2190
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:08,880
entirely the Daniel Stern character

2191
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:10,880
what he's fun

2192
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:12,880
yeah he's funny but it's like cutting

2193
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:14,880
out Abu yeah

2194
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:16,880
oh they can do it I guess

2195
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:18,880
nothing really is affected by it

2196
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:20,880
you can scrape off the

2197
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:22,880
chocolate off the top of my cake

2198
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:24,880
it doesn't mean I want to eat it

2199
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:26,880
why are they so pressed

2200
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:28,880
for space on the tape

2201
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:32,880
as read by Dan Hedea

2202
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:34,880
you know Dan Hedea

2203
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:36,880
and I remember

2204
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:38,880
there's a line that my friend and I

2205
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:40,880
we got on a car trip we were at a gas station

2206
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:42,880
we saw the rookie of the year novelization on tape

2207
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:44,880
we're like let's listen to it we listened to it

2208
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:46,880
and it was Dan Hedea there was one line we listened over and over

2209
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:48,880
where he was like Henry saw his mom

2210
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:50,880
kiss a new boyfriend made him want to bloth

2211
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:52,880
laughter

2212
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:54,880
laughter

2213
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:56,880
oh my god

2214
01:20:56,880 --> 01:20:58,880
do you have that still is that available

2215
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:00,880
I don't I don't I would like to find that

2216
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:02,880
there are a lot of celebrity read novelizations

2217
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:04,880
I don't know

2218
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:06,880
it's so funny to be like a novelization

2219
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:08,880
of a movie which is already like

2220
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:10,880
if you're reading a novelization of a

2221
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:12,880
kids movie you're already pretty

2222
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:14,880
not that they did

2223
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:16,880
and listening to it

2224
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:18,880
we're a lot of steps

2225
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:20,880
removed from the source material

2226
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:22,880
the blues brother show at universal studios like

2227
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:24,880
the understudy

2228
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:26,880
for the blues brother show

2229
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:28,880
at universal

2230
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:30,880
is like

2231
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:32,880
eight steps removed from actual

2232
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:34,880
blues music

2233
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:36,880
blues music

2234
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:38,880
Dan Ackroyd and John Belushi's

2235
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:40,880
appropriation of that

2236
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:42,880
Universal Studios Hollywood

2237
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:44,880
appropriation of that

2238
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:46,880
and then the understudy for that

2239
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:48,880
laughter

2240
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:50,880
who gets to do it if the fake Belushi

2241
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:52,880
laughter

2242
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:54,880
laughter

2243
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:56,880
laughter

2244
01:21:56,880 --> 01:21:58,880
but what was that sorry

2245
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:00,880
I don't know

2246
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:02,880
I watched an interview with

2247
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:04,880
I watched an interview with

2248
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:06,880
Dylan White

2249
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:08,880
10 year veteran of the show

2250
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:10,880
he was on the Tiara talk show

2251
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:12,880
which was the talk show we listened to

2252
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:14,880
and we heard about Cal David

2253
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:16,880
aka Sonny Eclipse

2254
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:18,880
the robot from Florida's Cosmic Race

2255
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:20,880
who does lounge music in a restaurant

2256
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:22,880
in Florida

2257
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:24,880
in the disney world

2258
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:26,880
he's an alien who does lounge music

2259
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:28,880
so the way

2260
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:30,880
check him out

2261
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:32,880
he does great sets all the time

2262
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:34,880
so there would be two genies working

2263
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:36,880
on one day

2264
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:38,880
and one of them would have the early shift and one of them would have the late shift

2265
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:40,880
and they'd come in

2266
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:42,880
and talk to each other about what

2267
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:44,880
their ideas were

2268
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:46,880
and they'd collaborate

2269
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:48,880
and they'd talk about what was going on during the day

2270
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:50,880
and they'd throw ideas at each other

2271
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:52,880
and then they would

2272
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:54,880
so they had a rule if one of the genies came up with a joke

2273
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:56,880
another genie couldn't tell that joke

2274
01:22:56,880 --> 01:22:58,880
until the other genie had done it

2275
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:00,880
successfully so you couldn't like steal someone else's idea

2276
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:02,880
you could help it

2277
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:04,880
help them with it but then once they've done it

2278
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:06,880
you could do your own version

2279
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:08,880
so he describes what would happen is

2280
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:10,880
they may have a joke

2281
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:12,880
and then different genies would put it different places in the show

2282
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:14,880
so you get your snooki different spots

2283
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:16,880
and a different read on the snooki joke

2284
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:18,880
so he was like

2285
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:20,880
it was so fun

2286
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:22,880
constant just collaboration

2287
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:24,880
just talking over

2288
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:26,880
the new show every night

2289
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:28,880
they loved it

2290
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:30,880
oh my god

2291
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:32,880
so it was what I honestly thought

2292
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:34,880
because I was always dreaming of them on the radio

2293
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:36,880
I could use this for Genie today

2294
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:38,880
oh this sounds good

2295
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:40,880
these are interesting headlines

2296
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:42,880
I could use this

2297
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:44,880
yeah like the comic

2298
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:46,880
he wakes up at 11

2299
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:48,880
or like your friend

2300
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:50,880
grabs the newspaper and that's when his job starts

2301
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:52,880
looking at the headlines coming up with jokes

2302
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:54,880
I would imagine too like he's at like a family reunion

2303
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:56,880
and his uncle's like pitching him Genie stuff

2304
01:23:56,880 --> 01:23:58,880
you're like oh

2305
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:00,880
my uncle won't stop pitching me Genie stuff

2306
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:02,880
he doesn't get it

2307
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:04,880
he doesn't get the voice of the character

2308
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:10,880
I tried to write down every reference for the one show I watched

2309
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:12,880
I wrote down so many of them

2310
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:14,880
I watched the very last show

2311
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:16,880
so they were milking it

2312
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:18,880
it was like 50 minutes longer and they were milking it

2313
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:20,880
and the Genie did a bit where he said the name

2314
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:24,880
of every actor who played Genie Jafar and Aladdin

2315
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:28,880
so he says like a few dozen names at some point

2316
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:32,880
but just writing down topical references

2317
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:34,880
I think it was about 30

2318
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:36,880
there was a point when he first showed something

2319
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:38,880
one show where I was like

2320
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:40,880
I keep rewinding because I'm like you gotta be kidding me

2321
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:42,880
Jason the stenographer

2322
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:44,880
how did he do that

2323
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:46,880
it's hard yeah I was trying to keep up too

2324
01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:48,880
deal or no deal in 2016

2325
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:50,880
it's wild

2326
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:52,880
yeah a 45 minute show with 30 jokes

2327
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:56,880
that's like a pop culture reference every minute

2328
01:24:56,880 --> 01:24:58,880
I was exhausted

2329
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:00,880
I just kinda wanna read them as fast as I can

2330
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:02,880
that's what I was thinking

2331
01:25:02,880 --> 01:25:04,880
it's just a melee

2332
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:06,880
it'll be torturous for us

2333
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:08,880
we'll try to catch our breath

2334
01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:10,880
good luck I'm so sorry

2335
01:25:10,880 --> 01:25:12,880
we'll edit out your stifling of laughter if it's too distracting

2336
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:14,880
it's like those pop-up dirty games

2337
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:16,880
of like you're not gonna last 5 minutes

2338
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:18,880
this is gonna be excruciating

2339
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:20,880
try to last but these Genie jokes

2340
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:22,880
okay Genie jokes about patriots football

2341
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:24,880
Genie jokes about Abercrombie and Fitch not wanting

2342
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:26,880
people that look like him to wear the clothes

2343
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:28,880
Genie says that he can't fulfill your wish to be part of One Direction

2344
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:30,880
and he's like

2345
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:32,880
I'm gonna go with the Genie

2346
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:34,880
I'm gonna go with the Genie

2347
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:36,880
you can't fulfill your wish to be part of One Direction

2348
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:38,880
even though there's a spot open

2349
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:40,880
and he says Zayn is going in the wrong direction

2350
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:46,880
no wishing for more wishing

2351
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:50,880
except you can wish for Justin Bieber to get deported

2352
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:52,880
this is it from a different show

2353
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:54,880
can't make people fall in love

2354
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:58,880
but cause unions fall apart all the time

2355
01:25:58,880 --> 01:26:00,880
like the union in One Direction

2356
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:02,880
I made it clunkier but it was a jack-of-all-trades

2357
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:04,880
I made it clunkier but it was a jack-of-all-trades

2358
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:06,880
I thought they were gonna have an anti-union thing

2359
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:08,880
what screen are they?

2360
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:10,880
can I do a related Bieber

2361
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:12,880
we just throw them out

2362
01:26:12,880 --> 01:26:14,880
cause there's a number of spots

2363
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:16,880
making anybody come back from the dead is always a spot

2364
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:18,880
I can't make anybody come back from the dead

2365
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:20,880
if I can't do it for Justin Bieber's career

2366
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:22,880
I can't do it for you

2367
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:24,880
audience goes ooo

2368
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:26,880
that's the only one of those I ever found

2369
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:28,880
Genie all of a sudden just goes

2370
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:30,880
SUPERSTAR

2371
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:32,880
like Mary-Kathryn Gallagher

2372
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:34,880
I can't bring anyone back from the dead

2373
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:36,880
I used that already on Betty White

2374
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:38,880
that is a cool-ish one for the cruise ship

2375
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:40,880
cruise ship

2376
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:42,880
it's usually pretty sticky

2377
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:44,880
it's a lot more like crazy cause it's random

2378
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:46,880
not a lot of topical stuff in that

2379
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:48,880
the dirty show at 11

2380
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:50,880
like Teatro Martini

2381
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:52,880
down at the Pirates dinner

2382
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:54,880
that's another episode

2383
01:26:54,880 --> 01:26:56,880
I also think the Betty White reference

2384
01:26:56,880 --> 01:26:58,880
what was the name of the guy who

2385
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:00,880
played the Genie?

2386
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:02,880
Terrence White or something?

2387
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:04,880
oh oh oh oh it was Dylan White

2388
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:06,880
sounds like a little bit of nepotism

2389
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:08,880
going on

2390
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:10,880
shouldn't his name be Dylan Blue?

2391
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:12,880
what with the character

2392
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:14,880
he plays

2393
01:27:14,880 --> 01:27:16,880
and some of these jokes too

2394
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:18,880
I think he would have liked if you had like

2395
01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:20,880
went up to him and done that he'd be like

2396
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:22,880
I gotta use that for Genie

2397
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:24,880
I can't make people fall in love thing I thought it was gonna be

2398
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:26,880
they wouldn't say it I can't make people fall in love

2399
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:28,880
I can't keep Kelsey from falling off this stage

2400
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:32,880
can't make you fall in love like Bella and Edward

2401
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:34,880
from Twilight

2402
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:36,880
that's in there

2403
01:27:36,880 --> 01:27:38,880
oh thanks for the from Twilight Genie

2404
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:42,880
did you ever leave the show

2405
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:44,880
Paul and then go back and think to yourself

2406
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:46,880
I'm blowing an opportunity

2407
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:50,880
I go up to one of the ushers

2408
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:52,880
and I'm like I think I could run Disney World

2409
01:27:52,880 --> 01:27:54,880
I could live in the castle maybe

2410
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:00,880
this is my favorite

2411
01:28:00,880 --> 01:28:02,880
he goes stay out of the light Carol Anne

2412
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:04,880
which is a poltergeist reference

2413
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:06,880
very impressed with that one

2414
01:28:06,880 --> 01:28:08,880
who's he saying that to what's the circumstances

2415
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:10,880
that somebody's

2416
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:12,880
towards the light

2417
01:28:12,880 --> 01:28:14,880
I watch so many of these I can't remember

2418
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:16,880
there's like a run where he does

2419
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:18,880
stay out of the light Carol Anne use the force luke

2420
01:28:18,880 --> 01:28:20,880
groovy baby

2421
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:22,880
he gets

2422
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:24,880
an applause break

2423
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:26,880
he's saying be yourself

2424
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:28,880
Aladdin and saying a lot of similar

2425
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:30,880
the message of the movie

2426
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:32,880
essentially

2427
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:34,880
there's one where he does the full

2428
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:36,880
like Luke I'm your father no that

2429
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:38,880
can't be Paul he does like the full scene

2430
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:40,880
himself

2431
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:42,880
he does it with that Luke whiney

2432
01:28:42,880 --> 01:28:44,880
no I can't be Chad

2433
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:46,880
I thought he was funny

2434
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:48,880
impossible

2435
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:50,880
he tells Aladdin that he's a smurf

2436
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:52,880
that's working on his dad bod

2437
01:28:52,880 --> 01:28:54,880
whoa

2438
01:28:54,880 --> 01:28:56,880
similar to

2439
01:28:56,880 --> 01:28:58,880
is that in his reveal cause a lot of the reveals

2440
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:00,880
yes yes who are you I'm Magic Mike

2441
01:29:00,880 --> 01:29:02,880
the later years

2442
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:06,880
that's not dissimilar from

2443
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:08,880
he's like I eat someone used their wish to make

2444
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:10,880
that new Terminator movie get to the

2445
01:29:10,880 --> 01:29:12,880
walker get to the

2446
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:14,880
is a reference to get to the chopper

2447
01:29:14,880 --> 01:29:16,880
which is a different Schwarzenegger

2448
01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:18,880
movie

2449
01:29:18,880 --> 01:29:20,880
he says he tells Jafar that he's so

2450
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:22,880
mean when he's on my space Tom

2451
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:24,880
won't even be his friend

2452
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:28,880
that's from 2019 actually

2453
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:30,880
they brought back the Aladdin

2454
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:32,880
show

2455
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:34,880
oh he's

2456
01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:36,880
back before when he says like just like

2457
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:38,880
Dr. Phil I can't make somebody fall in

2458
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:40,880
love with you call that the John

2459
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:42,880
and Kate rule

2460
01:29:42,880 --> 01:29:44,880
I believe it's John and Kate plus eight

2461
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:46,880
wait and he's saying

2462
01:29:46,880 --> 01:29:48,880
they've

2463
01:29:48,880 --> 01:29:50,880
unclear it's unclear exactly

2464
01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:52,880
what he's going to do they love each other

2465
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:54,880
well they got divorced

2466
01:29:54,880 --> 01:29:56,880
it was love was real once I guess

2467
01:29:56,880 --> 01:29:58,880
Dr. Phil okay he always

2468
01:29:58,880 --> 01:30:00,880
uses all the time that Dr. Phil

2469
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:02,880
he always says Dr. Phil like Dr. Phil

2470
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:04,880
I can't make anyone fall in love with you

2471
01:30:04,880 --> 01:30:06,880
what is that based on

2472
01:30:06,880 --> 01:30:08,880
I have no idea what that's based on

2473
01:30:08,880 --> 01:30:10,880
it's not a romantic

2474
01:30:10,880 --> 01:30:12,880
show it's not something he's like fixing couples

2475
01:30:12,880 --> 01:30:14,880
all the time it's like no general

2476
01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:16,880
it's a Venn diagram crossover

2477
01:30:16,880 --> 01:30:18,880
of like a celebrity

2478
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:20,880
that all four quadrants

2479
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:22,880
understand yes and then

2480
01:30:22,880 --> 01:30:24,880
it's a voice that's easy to do

2481
01:30:24,880 --> 01:30:26,880
yeah yeah yeah yeah

2482
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:28,880
Gangnam Style he definitely did Gangnam Style

2483
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:30,880
for sure I remember

2484
01:30:30,880 --> 01:30:32,880
seeing him do it this is

2485
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:34,880
the actual time capsule yeah

2486
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:36,880
all these Aladdin shows we should just

2487
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:38,880
put all of them on one

2488
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:40,880
compact disc and

2489
01:30:40,880 --> 01:30:42,880
bury it and then that's all we need

2490
01:30:42,880 --> 01:30:44,880
and when we go back and read it we're like oh yeah

2491
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:46,880
yeah that's what it was like to be

2492
01:30:46,880 --> 01:30:48,880
alive this is

2493
01:30:48,880 --> 01:30:50,880
an ultimate collection of pop culture

2494
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:52,880
all right so I went do you I

2495
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:54,880
have two from the

2496
01:30:54,880 --> 01:30:56,880
2003 version

2497
01:30:56,880 --> 01:30:58,880
I have a question which is the did the

2498
01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:00,880
topicality ramp up as the years

2499
01:31:00,880 --> 01:31:02,880
went on the answer doesn't seem like they did

2500
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:04,880
but was not absent

2501
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:06,880
from 2003

2502
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:08,880
and I think I there's a

2503
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:10,880
joke for me and there's a joke for Scott because those

2504
01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:12,880
are the only two ones in the and so the

2505
01:31:12,880 --> 01:31:14,880
first one he comes out of the lamp and he

2506
01:31:14,880 --> 01:31:16,880
explains how long he's been in there and he tells Aladdin

2507
01:31:16,880 --> 01:31:18,880
that he's missed every episode of I

2508
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:20,880
Love Lucy

2509
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:22,880
and it gets very little reaction

2510
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:24,880
even in 2003 really confusing

2511
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:26,880
and then this other one gets no reaction

2512
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:28,880
too and he says that he

2513
01:31:28,880 --> 01:31:30,880
can't make someone fall in love with you he tried

2514
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:32,880
it once and Liza Minnelli will

2515
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:34,880
never forgive me

2516
01:31:34,880 --> 01:31:36,880
wow a David

2517
01:31:36,880 --> 01:31:38,880
Guest joke

2518
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:40,880
2003 I didn't

2519
01:31:40,880 --> 01:31:42,880
I didn't get it right away

2520
01:31:42,880 --> 01:31:44,880
pretty good pretty good

2521
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:46,880
oh man not a bad joke

2522
01:31:46,880 --> 01:31:48,880
how do we tilt this podcast

2523
01:31:48,880 --> 01:31:50,880
there's no justification for us

2524
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:52,880
to do a David Guest episode is there

2525
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:54,880
we can find

2526
01:31:54,880 --> 01:31:56,880
we can find something

2527
01:31:56,880 --> 01:31:58,880
we're doing the El Capitan Theater because there's a

2528
01:31:58,880 --> 01:32:00,880
Ghirardelli ice cream shop next to it so

2529
01:32:00,880 --> 01:32:02,880
I need an excuse somebody can

2530
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:04,880

01:32:30,880 --> 01:32:32,880
he does get a little political

2545
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:34,880
in the dreaded year of 2016

2546
01:32:34,880 --> 01:32:36,880
towards the end he says

2547
01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:38,880
the carpet flies away

2548
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:40,880
and he says I haven't seen a rug fly away

2549
01:32:40,880 --> 01:32:42,880
like that since Donald Trump's hair on a windy day

2550
01:32:46,880 --> 01:32:48,880
you probably killed it

2551
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:50,880
probably killed it

2552
01:32:50,880 --> 01:32:52,880
actually the longer pause

2553
01:32:52,880 --> 01:32:54,880
after a punch line the more

2554
01:32:54,880 --> 01:32:56,880
I love it

2555
01:32:56,880 --> 01:32:58,880
that's so bad I'm just gonna like rest

2556
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:00,880
in the

2557
01:33:00,880 --> 01:33:02,880
minute let it age

2558
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:04,880
there was that second

2559
01:33:04,880 --> 01:33:06,880
to the last Aladdin performance

2560
01:33:06,880 --> 01:33:08,880
where the Jeannie didn't do any topical material

2561
01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:10,880
he just sat down at the piano and sang

2562
01:33:10,880 --> 01:33:12,880
Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah

2563
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:16,880
I'm not giving up on neither should you

2564
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:22,880
let's see

2565
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:24,880
something about three wishes

2566
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:26,880
because three is

2567
01:33:26,880 --> 01:33:28,880
all you need

2568
01:33:28,880 --> 01:33:30,880
he says things come in threes

2569
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:32,880
wishes blind mice shark nato movies

2570
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:38,880
one of the big joke zones

2571
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:40,880
also is he's messing with Jafar

2572
01:33:40,880 --> 01:33:42,880
who has to stay straight they don't let these people

2573
01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:44,880
respond to the Jeannie in any way

2574
01:33:44,880 --> 01:33:46,880
as though it's like a hey can I make you a crack

2575
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:48,880
kind of situation especially with Jafar

2576
01:33:50,880 --> 01:33:52,880
so a lot of disses of Jafar

2577
01:33:52,880 --> 01:33:54,880
he wants to be an all powerful sultan

2578
01:33:54,880 --> 01:33:56,880
alright fine here you go you're the sultan

2579
01:33:56,880 --> 01:33:58,880
I want to be president too Kanye

2580
01:34:00,880 --> 01:34:02,880
2015 I think

2581
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:04,880
because that's when he started talking about that

2582
01:34:04,880 --> 01:34:06,880
he says

2583
01:34:06,880 --> 01:34:08,880
to Jafar are you mad because

2584
01:34:08,880 --> 01:34:10,880
John Travolta mispronounced your name

2585
01:34:10,880 --> 01:34:12,880
too

2586
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:14,880
I was there for that

2587
01:34:14,880 --> 01:34:16,880
I remember that

2588
01:34:16,880 --> 01:34:18,880
the future Frozen show that will be

2589
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:20,880
replacing them

2590
01:34:20,880 --> 01:34:22,880
yes, Adina Mendel

2591
01:34:22,880 --> 01:34:24,880
let's well receive the Frozen one

2592
01:34:24,880 --> 01:34:26,880
partly because there's less generation

2593
01:34:26,880 --> 01:34:28,880
Aladdin was around for 20 plus years

2594
01:34:28,880 --> 01:34:30,880
when this

2595
01:34:30,880 --> 01:34:32,880
closed

2596
01:34:32,880 --> 01:34:34,880
so the parents and the grandparents and the kids

2597
01:34:34,880 --> 01:34:36,880
all liked it, Frozen opened

2598
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:38,880
less than six years after the movie

2599
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:40,880
one generation

2600
01:34:40,880 --> 01:34:42,880
I personally remember

2601
01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:44,880
a lot of honey boo boo references

2602
01:34:44,880 --> 01:34:46,880
when I went

2603
01:34:46,880 --> 01:34:48,880
I remember right after the Oscars he made an Angelina Jolie's leg joke

2604
01:34:48,880 --> 01:34:50,880
the leg

2605
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:52,880
she stood in that kind of

2606
01:34:52,880 --> 01:34:54,880
stress way

2607
01:34:54,880 --> 01:34:56,880
do you think this show

2608
01:34:56,880 --> 01:34:58,880
partly ended because you couldn't do

2609
01:34:58,880 --> 01:35:00,880
topicality

2610
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:02,880
in a post Trump world anymore

2611
01:35:02,880 --> 01:35:04,880
you know the writers were just like

2612
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:06,880
all we can do now is just make

2613
01:35:06,880 --> 01:35:08,880
Trump jokes

2614
01:35:08,880 --> 01:35:10,880
like Jon Stewart you just kind of wasn't up to it

2615
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:12,880
I've been at this shit for

2616
01:35:12,880 --> 01:35:14,880
a similar run of time as Jon Stewart

2617
01:35:14,880 --> 01:35:16,880
I think you could map them perfectly

2618
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:18,880
and that's why the Genie

2619
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:20,880
is testifying before Congress

2620
01:35:20,880 --> 01:35:22,880
you could say we've been missing

2621
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:24,880
Genie's comedic voice these last couple of years

2622
01:35:24,880 --> 01:35:26,880
and we've sort of needed it in the dialogue

2623
01:35:26,880 --> 01:35:28,880
the Genie might have been able to fix all of this

2624
01:35:28,880 --> 01:35:30,880
when I watch those old Genie clips

2625
01:35:30,880 --> 01:35:32,880
I'm like I wish he was still here to talk about

2626
01:35:32,880 --> 01:35:34,880
what's happening now

2627
01:35:34,880 --> 01:35:36,880
Genie gave that a passion plea to Congress

2628
01:35:36,880 --> 01:35:38,880
last week though

2629
01:35:40,880 --> 01:35:42,880
yeah it was for the first responders

2630
01:35:42,880 --> 01:35:44,880
of the first prince's pants being

2631
01:35:44,880 --> 01:35:46,880
bit

2632
01:35:46,880 --> 01:35:48,880
what?

2633
01:35:48,880 --> 01:35:50,880
the first prince who got his pants

2634
01:35:50,880 --> 01:35:52,880
that was a disaster

2635
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:54,880
year after year

2636
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:56,880
no reparations to repair

2637
01:35:56,880 --> 01:35:58,880
the pants

2638
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:02,880
we're not playing for the threads

2639
01:36:02,880 --> 01:36:04,880
Raja I forbid

2640
01:36:04,880 --> 01:36:06,880
you from having any daughters

2641
01:36:06,880 --> 01:36:08,880
Raja?

2642
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:10,880
it's like the Raja

2643
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:12,880
understands English and is also like

2644
01:36:12,880 --> 01:36:14,880
you're not going to let me fuck?

2645
01:36:20,880 --> 01:36:22,880
I'm going to fuck that carpet

2646
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:28,880
here's a really

2647
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:30,880
specific one

2648
01:36:30,880 --> 01:36:32,880
right before the stairs

2649
01:36:32,880 --> 01:36:34,880
march

2650
01:36:34,880 --> 01:36:36,880
this is a come downstairs Madonna

2651
01:36:36,880 --> 01:36:38,880
what?

2652
01:36:38,880 --> 01:36:40,880
did she fall?

2653
01:36:40,880 --> 01:36:42,880
yeah

2654
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:44,880
other people falling

2655
01:36:44,880 --> 01:36:46,880
was fine

2656
01:36:46,880 --> 01:36:48,880
it's not the one that happened in our house

2657
01:36:48,880 --> 01:36:50,880
yeah

2658
01:36:50,880 --> 01:36:52,880
hello Baymax

2659
01:36:52,880 --> 01:36:54,880
or hello I'm Baymax

2660
01:36:54,880 --> 01:36:56,880
they were doing that

2661
01:36:56,880 --> 01:36:58,880
two years after

2662
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:00,880
the Euro 6 came out

2663
01:37:00,880 --> 01:37:02,880
not to be the comedy police here

2664
01:37:02,880 --> 01:37:04,880
or whatever but

2665
01:37:04,880 --> 01:37:06,880
there's a lot of punching down going on

2666
01:37:06,880 --> 01:37:08,880
with this Aladdin show right?

2667
01:37:08,880 --> 01:37:10,880
a lot of ladies

2668
01:37:10,880 --> 01:37:12,880
a lot of non white people

2669
01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:14,880
I don't hear a lot of

2670
01:37:14,880 --> 01:37:16,880
powerful

2671
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:18,880
straight white guys getting called

2672
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:20,880
to the mat too much here

2673
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:22,880
this little hegemonic family

2674
01:37:22,880 --> 01:37:24,880
is all coming in being like please

2675
01:37:24,880 --> 01:37:26,880
reestablish the status quo for us

2676
01:37:26,880 --> 01:37:28,880
weee

2677
01:37:28,880 --> 01:37:30,880
do you consider Baymax

2678
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:32,880
a white guy?

2679
01:37:34,880 --> 01:37:36,880
at least it's all

2680
01:37:36,880 --> 01:37:38,880
better than the Bill and Ted show

2681
01:37:38,880 --> 01:37:40,880
when we analyzed it a little while ago

2682
01:37:40,880 --> 01:37:42,880
it was 90%

2683
01:37:42,880 --> 01:37:44,880
very mean gay jokes

2684
01:37:44,880 --> 01:37:46,880
yeah

2685
01:37:46,880 --> 01:37:48,880
actually I was going to bring this up

2686
01:37:48,880 --> 01:37:50,880
the thing I really like

2687
01:37:50,880 --> 01:37:52,880
about Disney's

2688
01:37:54,880 --> 01:37:56,880
well I'll say it more in the negative

2689
01:37:56,880 --> 01:37:58,880
the Universal Studios

2690
01:37:58,880 --> 01:38:00,880
I don't like their

2691
01:38:00,880 --> 01:38:02,880
tone

2692
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:04,880
their sensibility

2693
01:38:04,880 --> 01:38:06,880
their sense of humor is sort of like

2694
01:38:06,880 --> 01:38:08,880
we pranked ya

2695
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:10,880
we embarrassed ya

2696
01:38:10,880 --> 01:38:12,880
in front of everybody

2697
01:38:12,880 --> 01:38:14,880
they'll get a volunteer

2698
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:16,880
somebody who's offered to help them

2699
01:38:16,880 --> 01:38:18,880
and then they're like

2700
01:38:18,880 --> 01:38:20,880
you're a piece of shit

2701
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:22,880
and everyone's laughing

2702
01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:24,880
what I love about

2703
01:38:24,880 --> 01:38:26,880
and I know that's what

2704
01:38:26,880 --> 01:38:28,880
Universal has to do

2705
01:38:28,880 --> 01:38:30,880
when you're the punk kid

2706
01:38:30,880 --> 01:38:32,880
not everybody likes you

2707
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:34,880
and what I like about Disneyland

2708
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:36,880
is like

2709
01:38:36,880 --> 01:38:38,880
it's not just wholesome

2710
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:40,880
it's pretty friendly

2711
01:38:40,880 --> 01:38:42,880
the genie can get a little blue

2712
01:38:48,880 --> 01:38:50,880
I want to get moved to your twitter

2713
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:52,880
but I have one more thing to say

2714
01:38:52,880 --> 01:38:54,880
somebody walks out of a room

2715
01:38:54,880 --> 01:38:56,880
and he says bye Felicia

2716
01:38:56,880 --> 01:38:58,880
yeah he pulls the bye Felicia

2717
01:38:58,880 --> 01:39:00,880
and here's my thing about

2718
01:39:00,880 --> 01:39:02,880
bye Felicia I still

2719
01:39:02,880 --> 01:39:04,880
I never figured out what it was

2720
01:39:04,880 --> 01:39:06,880
I don't know the source of it

2721
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:08,880
it's from Friday

2722
01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:10,880
it's a character in Friday everyone hates

2723
01:39:10,880 --> 01:39:12,880
so why did it get popular like two years ago?

2724
01:39:12,880 --> 01:39:14,880
it became popular

2725
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:16,880
on twitter

2726
01:39:16,880 --> 01:39:18,880
as like a fuck you

2727
01:39:18,880 --> 01:39:20,880
I think it

2728
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:22,880
came up on black twitter

2729
01:39:22,880 --> 01:39:24,880
was then taken by marketers

2730
01:39:24,880 --> 01:39:26,880
by like Nancy Pelosi

2731
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:28,880
yeah by like Nancy Pelosi

2732
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:30,880
so we say to Trump

2733
01:39:30,880 --> 01:39:32,880
it was a long time short hand

2734
01:39:32,880 --> 01:39:34,880
for like you see you can go fuck yourself

2735
01:39:34,880 --> 01:39:36,880
basically

2736
01:39:36,880 --> 01:39:38,880
but has had a resurgence

2737
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:40,880
alright well I've outed myself

2738
01:39:40,880 --> 01:39:42,880
as having not seen Friday

2739
01:39:42,880 --> 01:39:44,880
do you think

2740
01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:46,880
is Felicia Day

2741
01:39:46,880 --> 01:39:48,880
in Guardians of the Galaxy?

2742
01:39:48,880 --> 01:39:50,880
no

2743
01:39:54,880 --> 01:39:56,880
I know what you're thinking of

2744
01:39:56,880 --> 01:39:58,880
it's the other actor

2745
01:39:58,880 --> 01:40:00,880
because I was hoping that the Guardians of the Galaxy

2746
01:40:00,880 --> 01:40:02,880
ride next door

2747
01:40:02,880 --> 01:40:04,880
would overhear

2748
01:40:04,880 --> 01:40:06,880
it's Karen Gallum

2749
01:40:06,880 --> 01:40:08,880
yeah sorry

2750
01:40:08,880 --> 01:40:10,880
they're similar looking

2751
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:12,880
he also says I like

2752
01:40:12,880 --> 01:40:14,880
your weave carpet

2753
01:40:14,880 --> 01:40:16,880
yeah he says that a lot

2754
01:40:16,880 --> 01:40:18,880
I like your weave

2755
01:40:18,880 --> 01:40:20,880
also he

2756
01:40:20,880 --> 01:40:22,880
pronounces Jafar the Sultan

2757
01:40:22,880 --> 01:40:24,880
and then sorry

2758
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:26,880
Miss Philippines is the Sultan

2759
01:40:26,880 --> 01:40:28,880
a reference to Steve Harvey

2760
01:40:28,880 --> 01:40:30,880
Miss Universe

2761
01:40:30,880 --> 01:40:32,880
Miss Universe

2762
01:40:32,880 --> 01:40:34,880
yeah

2763
01:40:34,880 --> 01:40:36,880
another not white guy

2764
01:40:36,880 --> 01:40:38,880
and you know what

2765
01:40:38,880 --> 01:40:40,880
oh but he

2766
01:40:40,880 --> 01:40:42,880
you said one of these

2767
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:44,880
he took down Prince Charles

2768
01:40:44,880 --> 01:40:46,880
but he

2769
01:40:46,880 --> 01:40:48,880
he did some white guys

2770
01:40:48,880 --> 01:40:50,880
he said his chest

2771
01:40:50,880 --> 01:40:52,880
was like the Patriots football

2772
01:40:52,880 --> 01:40:54,880
he had press on it

2773
01:40:54,880 --> 01:40:56,880
he said here you play Tom Brady

2774
01:40:56,880 --> 01:40:58,880
which if you're

2775
01:40:58,880 --> 01:41:00,880
listening Mitch I'm sorry

2776
01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:02,880
he's gonna be mad

2777
01:41:02,880 --> 01:41:04,880
he's like

2778
01:41:04,880 --> 01:41:06,880
worst fucking play ever

2779
01:41:06,880 --> 01:41:08,880
refuses to go to the Disneyland ever again

2780
01:41:08,880 --> 01:41:10,880
I always have

2781
01:41:10,880 --> 01:41:12,880
I always have

2782
01:41:12,880 --> 01:41:14,880
so

2783
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:16,880
I feel like to wrap up

2784
01:41:16,880 --> 01:41:18,880
what we should do is

2785
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:20,880
this is the first thing Scott asked me

2786
01:41:20,880 --> 01:41:22,880
when we met

2787
01:41:22,880 --> 01:41:24,880
he said did I heard you have a Twitter account

2788
01:41:24,880 --> 01:41:26,880
for the genie from California Adventure

2789
01:41:26,880 --> 01:41:28,880
and I have

2790
01:41:28,880 --> 01:41:30,880

2791
01:41:30,880 --> 01:41:32,880
Mike I remember this but I didn't know that was you

2792
01:41:32,880 --> 01:41:34,880
that was me yes

2793
01:41:34,880 --> 01:41:36,880
what is the handle for people to follow

2794
01:41:36,880 --> 01:41:38,880
I think it's time I haven't tweeted on it

2795
01:41:38,880 --> 01:41:40,880
in literally 8 years

2796
01:41:40,880 --> 01:41:42,880
whoa

2797
01:41:42,880 --> 01:41:44,880
it's time for him to come back

2798
01:41:44,880 --> 01:41:46,880
let him out of the lamp

2799
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:48,880
at topical genie

2800
01:41:48,880 --> 01:41:50,880
topical genie

2801
01:41:50,880 --> 01:41:52,880
I remember the picture getting to the

2802
01:41:52,880 --> 01:41:54,880
yes

2803
01:41:54,880 --> 01:41:56,880
wow

2804
01:41:56,880 --> 01:41:58,880
these are reading my own jokes but a couple of them for you

2805
01:41:58,880 --> 01:42:00,880
there's no one more evil and agrobot

2806
01:42:00,880 --> 01:42:02,880
than Jafar except the lawyers in the Casey Anthony

2807
01:42:02,880 --> 01:42:04,880
trial

2808
01:42:04,880 --> 01:42:06,880
I almost spat

2809
01:42:06,880 --> 01:42:08,880
food out of my mouth

2810
01:42:08,880 --> 01:42:10,880
these are better they age

2811
01:42:10,880 --> 01:42:12,880
they sat in the lamp and they're even funnier

2812
01:42:12,880 --> 01:42:14,880
yes I'm a genie why all the questions

2813
01:42:14,880 --> 01:42:16,880
what is this Jay Leno's 10 at 10

2814
01:42:16,880 --> 01:42:18,880
wow

2815
01:42:20,880 --> 01:42:22,880
if you reference the green car challenge

2816
01:42:22,880 --> 01:42:24,880
I'll be really impressed

2817
01:42:24,880 --> 01:42:26,880
I think I did here

2818
01:42:26,880 --> 01:42:28,880
riding on an elephant is the only way to travel

2819
01:42:28,880 --> 01:42:30,880
well that or participating in Jay Leno's green car challenge

2820
01:42:30,880 --> 01:42:32,880
yes

2821
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:34,880
I'm gonna just shake your hand

2822
01:42:34,880 --> 01:42:36,880
now you guys know why you do it

2823
01:42:36,880 --> 01:42:38,880
so that's the

2824
01:42:38,880 --> 01:42:40,880
shared sensibilities

2825
01:42:40,880 --> 01:42:42,880
you can read all the rest of them here

2826
01:42:42,880 --> 01:42:44,880
but let's tweet one out

2827
01:42:44,880 --> 01:42:46,880
right now

2828
01:42:46,880 --> 01:42:48,880
what do we think what's topical

2829
01:42:48,880 --> 01:42:50,880
sorry I put everyone on the spot here

2830
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:52,880
the news now

2831
01:42:52,880 --> 01:42:54,880
is all about concentration camps

2832
01:42:54,880 --> 01:42:56,880
so there's something a little lighter

2833
01:42:56,880 --> 01:42:58,880
let's try to get away from that if we can

2834
01:42:58,880 --> 01:43:00,880
I'm told the kids

2835
01:43:00,880 --> 01:43:02,880
like something called Fortnite

2836
01:43:02,880 --> 01:43:04,880
Fortnite's good

2837
01:43:04,880 --> 01:43:06,880
got it

2838
01:43:06,880 --> 01:43:08,880
oh wait that's what I was thinking on the way over

2839
01:43:08,880 --> 01:43:10,880
are there lives in

2840
01:43:10,880 --> 01:43:12,880
Fortnite like do you have infinite lives

2841
01:43:12,880 --> 01:43:14,880
okay so then it's like

2842
01:43:14,880 --> 01:43:16,880
I can't make somebody come back from the dead

2843
01:43:20,880 --> 01:43:22,880
make somebody come back from the dead

2844
01:43:24,880 --> 01:43:26,880
back from the dead

2845
01:43:26,880 --> 01:43:28,880
but I can start a new

2846
01:43:28,880 --> 01:43:30,880
game of I forget what the term is

2847
01:43:30,880 --> 01:43:32,880
the waiting area or the lobby

2848
01:43:32,880 --> 01:43:34,880
I can only send them back to the lobby in

2849
01:43:34,880 --> 01:43:36,880
Fortnite is it called the lobby

2850
01:43:36,880 --> 01:43:38,880
I think you're thinking too hard

2851
01:43:38,880 --> 01:43:40,880
this isn't Fortnite

2852
01:43:40,880 --> 01:43:42,880
I would all caps it

2853
01:43:42,880 --> 01:43:44,880
this isn't Fortnite

2854
01:43:46,880 --> 01:43:48,880
spelled F-O-R-T-N-I-T-E

2855
01:43:48,880 --> 01:43:50,880
what was the last tweet before this

2856
01:43:50,880 --> 01:43:52,880
hold on let me tweet this

2857
01:43:52,880 --> 01:43:54,880
and then I'll go back

2858
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:56,880
this isn't Fortnite

2859
01:43:56,880 --> 01:43:58,880
okay got it

2860
01:43:58,880 --> 01:44:00,880
last one

2861
01:44:00,880 --> 01:44:02,880
10-7-2011

2862
01:44:02,880 --> 01:44:04,880
and I can't raise the dead

2863
01:44:04,880 --> 01:44:06,880
sorry recently deceased character actor

2864
01:44:06,880 --> 01:44:08,880
Charles Napier

2865
01:44:08,880 --> 01:44:10,880
and then I just wrote

2866
01:44:10,880 --> 01:44:12,880
Furby in all caps

2867
01:44:14,880 --> 01:44:16,880
wow the Twitter is bad

2868
01:44:16,880 --> 01:44:18,880
because I was asking

2869
01:44:18,880 --> 01:44:20,880
I love that somebody who follows that account

2870
01:44:20,880 --> 01:44:22,880
and the last 8 years

2871
01:44:22,880 --> 01:44:24,880
forgot

2872
01:44:24,880 --> 01:44:26,880
well also

2873
01:44:26,880 --> 01:44:28,880
I

2874
01:44:28,880 --> 01:44:30,880
I had a less successful

2875
01:44:30,880 --> 01:44:32,880
endeavor

2876
01:44:32,880 --> 01:44:34,880
that we would tweet back and forth

2877
01:44:34,880 --> 01:44:36,880
through each other I was at Topical Green Goblin

2878
01:44:36,880 --> 01:44:38,880
a topical account

2879
01:44:38,880 --> 01:44:40,880
based on the green goblin

2880
01:44:40,880 --> 01:44:42,880
spider-man turn out the dark

2881
01:44:42,880 --> 01:44:44,880
specifically the letterman appearance

2882
01:44:44,880 --> 01:44:46,880
around the same time

2883
01:44:46,880 --> 01:44:48,880
so we look at the replies

2884
01:44:48,880 --> 01:44:50,880
that will come back too

2885
01:44:50,880 --> 01:44:52,880
that was beautiful

2886
01:44:52,880 --> 01:44:54,880
that's the start of a new

2887
01:44:54,880 --> 01:44:56,880
let's try to keep this alive

2888
01:44:56,880 --> 01:44:58,880
this episode

2889
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:00,880

2890
01:45:00,880 --> 01:45:02,880
topical genius

2891
01:45:02,880 --> 01:45:04,880
topical green goblin

2892
01:45:04,880 --> 01:45:06,880

01:45:28,880 --> 01:45:30,880
at the waffle

2905
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:32,880

01:46:00,880 --> 01:46:02,880
yeah if he can

2920
01:46:02,880 --> 01:46:04,880
process money just as friend

2921
01:46:04,880 --> 01:46:06,880
give up

2922
01:46:06,880 --> 01:46:08,880
I think a good Twitter actually also

2923
01:46:08,880 --> 01:46:10,880
is just ET goodbyes

2924
01:46:10,880 --> 01:46:12,880
and then you just tweet

2925
01:46:12,880 --> 01:46:14,880
and ask to be a goodbye

2926
01:46:14,880 --> 01:46:16,880
I'm just that

2927
01:46:16,880 --> 01:46:18,880
well Neil Campbell I remember

2928
01:46:18,880 --> 01:46:20,880
kind of giving me up because he said ET didn't know

2929
01:46:20,880 --> 01:46:22,880
Neil's name and he was like

2930
01:46:22,880 --> 01:46:24,880
the one human who's left

2931
01:46:24,880 --> 01:46:26,880
this earth and stepped on other planets

2932
01:46:26,880 --> 01:46:28,880
you should love Neil Armstrong

2933
01:46:28,880 --> 01:46:30,880
yeah

2934
01:46:30,880 --> 01:46:32,880
maybe he's mad at him

2935
01:46:32,880 --> 01:46:34,880
in fading space

2936
01:46:34,880 --> 01:46:36,880
you should have a lot of respect for the one human

2937
01:46:36,880 --> 01:46:38,880
