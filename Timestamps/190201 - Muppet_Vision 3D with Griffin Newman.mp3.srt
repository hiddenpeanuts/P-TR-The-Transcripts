00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,740
Hello, ForeverDog listeners. Before we get to today's episode, we have to tell you about a new

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:09,820
must-listen podcast from ForeverDog called the American Arts and Culture Review. Since they were

3
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:15,060
little kids, host Whitmer Thomas and Clay Tatum have shared one dream in common, to host an NPR

4
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:21,020
style podcast reviewing the best in film, television, art, fashion, and jazz music. And now,

5
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:25,260
at long last, with the help of a Casio keyboard and a one-man studio audience,

6
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:30,460
Whit and Clay have finally achieved their goal. Sort of. The American Arts and Culture Review is

7
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:34,960
like NPR for the end of the world, a twisted and surreal journey through the week's most important

8
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:40,680
works of art. If you're a fan of Hollywood Handbook, the podcast for laundry, or a woman's smile,

9
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:46,000
you'll love the American Arts and Culture Review. Find it wherever you listen to podcasts. New

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,380
episodes every Thursday. ForeverDog.

11
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:59,900
Warning. The following podcast may contain a robot with a musket, harrowing info about Scott's

12
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:06,480
childhood optometrist's office, and hopefully not an interruption from that devious star of many

13
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:13,160
GIFs, Constantine. Griffin Newman discusses foolishness we would like to see as we talk

14
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,980
Muppet Vision 3D on Podcast the Ride.

15
00:01:37,144 --> 00:01:45,404
Hey, welcome to Podcast The Ride, the podcast about theme parks hosted by three guys who refer to getting laid as capturing the all spark.

16
00:01:46,604 --> 00:01:49,944
I'm Scott, you're joined by Jason Sheridan and Mike Carlson.

17
00:01:50,264 --> 00:01:53,664
I mean, we're always talking about getting laid for one thing.

18
00:01:53,884 --> 00:01:54,904
That's for sure.

19
00:01:55,764 --> 00:01:59,104
I mean, obviously we'd love to use that phrase in and of itself, but then.

20
00:01:59,104 --> 00:02:02,984
Yeah, well, I refer to myself during intercourse as Evac.

21
00:02:04,264 --> 00:02:06,564
So yeah, of course I'm going to want the all spark.

22
00:02:06,564 --> 00:02:09,384
I want to get the all spark if you know what I mean.

23
00:02:09,384 --> 00:02:10,144
It makes all sense.

24
00:02:10,404 --> 00:02:11,204
Yeah, Mike Carlson here.

25
00:02:11,344 --> 00:02:12,984
Life's all about getting that all spark.

26
00:02:14,404 --> 00:02:21,064
Anyway, and today we are really happy to have, I think, a pretty stellar guest and topic combo.

27
00:02:21,504 --> 00:02:26,064
Let's introduce the guest part of that equation, you know, from the tick and from his podcast,

28
00:02:26,324 --> 00:02:27,584
Blank Check, it's Griffin Newman.

29
00:02:27,684 --> 00:02:28,324
Hello everybody.

30
00:02:28,564 --> 00:02:28,784
Hey.

31
00:02:29,784 --> 00:02:31,684
Thanks so much for being a requested guest.

32
00:02:31,744 --> 00:02:32,424
Yeah, truly.

33
00:02:32,504 --> 00:02:37,324
When we've thrown out, who would you like to hear and who's somebody in podcast world

34
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:38,624
you think might be into this stuff?

35
00:02:38,644 --> 00:02:40,604
Your name has come up with a lot of likes.

36
00:02:40,884 --> 00:02:44,124
I dropped the line to you like many months ago.

37
00:02:44,204 --> 00:02:44,664
Yeah.

38
00:02:44,684 --> 00:02:48,544
Just being like, I would love to do this whenever I'm in town next.

39
00:02:49,064 --> 00:02:52,964
But I felt like I was getting a lot of requests from people to go on this.

40
00:02:52,984 --> 00:02:53,464
Oh, no kidding.

41
00:02:53,484 --> 00:02:56,024
And I was like, I don't know what the interest is on their end,

42
00:02:56,244 --> 00:02:58,164
but I certainly am going to try.

43
00:02:58,304 --> 00:03:03,544
Well, thanks for making a point because you're out here for a little bit from the East Coast.

44
00:03:03,864 --> 00:03:06,064
Yeah, thanks for making a point.

45
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:07,924
Which was coupled into a Disneyland trip.

46
00:03:07,984 --> 00:03:13,824
So I'm like fresh off of a trip in the parks, off the takes, hot piping, hot takes.

47
00:03:14,124 --> 00:03:14,424
What a change.

48
00:03:14,424 --> 00:03:18,964
How many people are forced to take a trip without having like an after show

49
00:03:18,964 --> 00:03:21,024
to go over their opinions on the trip?

50
00:03:21,044 --> 00:03:23,744
And I don't like doing anything without an after show.

51
00:03:24,124 --> 00:03:26,144
I think if Chris Hardwick has taught me anything,

52
00:03:26,144 --> 00:03:28,624
I model most things in life off of Chris Hardwick.

53
00:03:28,624 --> 00:03:29,364
Yes, we all should.

54
00:03:29,864 --> 00:03:31,284
Especially when it comes to personal life.

55
00:03:31,484 --> 00:03:33,904
We're all soldiers in the Hardwick's army.

56
00:03:34,144 --> 00:03:37,664
When it comes to capturing the AllSpark, you need advice from Chris Hardwick.

57
00:03:38,784 --> 00:03:39,604
Yeah, yeah.

58
00:03:39,624 --> 00:03:43,764
It feels like it's a good outlet because I was just like loading up on things.

59
00:03:44,004 --> 00:03:46,884
And even like I got a walk off.

60
00:03:47,684 --> 00:03:48,204
Oh, that's right.

61
00:03:48,444 --> 00:03:52,124
I was so excited where I was like, I have a place where I can say this and it will mean something.

62
00:03:52,324 --> 00:03:55,424
Yeah, we can get an oh, yes, explain your walk off.

63
00:03:55,424 --> 00:03:57,864
Got a walk off on Astro Blasters.

64
00:03:57,984 --> 00:03:59,084
Wow, that's interesting.

65
00:03:59,084 --> 00:03:59,404
It was a trip for two days.

66
00:03:59,464 --> 00:04:00,924
It was raining a lot.

67
00:04:01,064 --> 00:04:01,304
OK.

68
00:04:01,344 --> 00:04:04,504
So there was a lot of erratic behavior on a lot of the rides.

69
00:04:04,604 --> 00:04:08,384
And especially like the rides that are more outdoor kept on shutting down

70
00:04:08,384 --> 00:04:11,444
because I was constantly checking the app, trying to see the lines on things.

71
00:04:11,464 --> 00:04:13,464
So many things were temporarily closed.

72
00:04:13,664 --> 00:04:17,324
Dean gets to do Radiator Springs Racers.

73
00:04:17,364 --> 00:04:17,964
Oh, no.

74
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:20,964
Because it would be like closed during the rain and would start up again.

75
00:04:21,044 --> 00:04:22,544
And there'd be like a three hour wait.

76
00:04:22,544 --> 00:04:22,924
Right.

77
00:04:22,924 --> 00:04:25,984
I'm going to wait for it to die down and then it would start raining again.

78
00:04:26,444 --> 00:04:26,864
And it never.

79
00:04:27,044 --> 00:04:27,224
OK.

80
00:04:27,364 --> 00:04:29,964
And a lot of like little because I ended up there.

81
00:04:30,064 --> 00:04:31,284
Were you there yesterday, too?

82
00:04:31,324 --> 00:04:32,304
I was there.

83
00:04:32,304 --> 00:04:33,444
No, two days ago.

84
00:04:33,444 --> 00:04:33,704
OK.

85
00:04:33,804 --> 00:04:34,604
I was there Tuesday, Wednesday.

86
00:04:35,004 --> 00:04:40,084
I did a little like rain trip with so crowds would be low, which was great.

87
00:04:40,164 --> 00:04:41,004
I had not done that.

88
00:04:41,024 --> 00:04:41,664
That's a boy.

89
00:04:41,784 --> 00:04:42,384
That's a tip.

90
00:04:42,524 --> 00:04:46,184
If you can endure rain because it's it wasn't that bad.

91
00:04:46,184 --> 00:04:48,264
It's like it's not super windy or super cold.

92
00:04:48,324 --> 00:04:48,964
So it ended up being great.

93
00:04:48,964 --> 00:04:54,184
I noticed a lot of the anything that's outdoor and that whips you around like Gadgets

94
00:04:54,184 --> 00:04:58,164
Go coaster or the goofy Sky School.

95
00:04:58,344 --> 00:05:00,144
So you missed you missed that kind of stuff.

96
00:05:00,804 --> 00:05:02,384
But those are those are acceptable.

97
00:05:02,384 --> 00:05:04,844
All of those I thought were skippable.

98
00:05:05,844 --> 00:05:08,324
Radiator Springs I had not done before.

99
00:05:08,544 --> 00:05:08,984
Right.

100
00:05:09,104 --> 00:05:12,584
So I was kind of looking forward to and I was sort of trying to couch it with my girlfriend

101
00:05:12,584 --> 00:05:16,864
because I was like I complained enough about the Cars franchise to her.

102
00:05:17,004 --> 00:05:23,364
She's had to speak and listen to me speak too often about how much I don't think cars is great.

103
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:27,204
Not even that I hate it, but I'm like it's just so marginal.

104
00:05:28,764 --> 00:05:29,824
Divisive opinion.

105
00:05:29,884 --> 00:05:30,324
Exactly.

106
00:05:30,404 --> 00:05:34,444
That I just think it was like I couldn't be like and we really have to go on the Cars ride.

107
00:05:34,444 --> 00:05:36,564
But I kept on being like, you know, people say it's pretty good.

108
00:05:36,704 --> 00:05:39,424
So I guess we should go on it just for the sake of like thrownness.

109
00:05:39,744 --> 00:05:44,304
Oh, you had to like easy you were like prepared for a hypocrisy argument or something.

110
00:05:44,484 --> 00:05:46,044
If you were too enthusiastic.

111
00:05:46,184 --> 00:05:46,624
Right.

112
00:05:46,504 --> 00:05:47,064
Exactly.

113
00:05:47,184 --> 00:05:50,944
So I was just like waiting for the wait to be short enough and that that never happened.

114
00:05:51,064 --> 00:05:54,204
But Astro Blaster seemed like one that wouldn't be affected by the weather.

115
00:05:54,424 --> 00:05:55,124
We go on it.

116
00:05:55,124 --> 00:05:59,804
We're halfway through and then it just stops abruptly.

117
00:06:00,044 --> 00:06:00,664
Wow.

118
00:06:00,764 --> 00:06:05,804
And then they announced like please wait for employees to come for cast members to come

119
00:06:05,804 --> 00:06:09,884
aid you and the lights went up and we were there for probably 12 or 15 minutes.

120
00:06:10,004 --> 00:06:12,004
Did you rack up points while you were waiting?

121
00:06:12,244 --> 00:06:15,104
No, they wouldn't let you because that was my first thing.

122
00:06:15,344 --> 00:06:15,404
Really?

123
00:06:15,704 --> 00:06:18,864
I could be hitting the charts right now.

124
00:06:18,864 --> 00:06:21,264
Yeah, because then you get the photo or at the end at least.

125
00:06:21,424 --> 00:06:21,544
Right.

126
00:06:21,544 --> 00:06:25,084
At least I want to go off, you know, 9999 or whatever.

127
00:06:25,504 --> 00:06:28,044
But no, it was like 15 minutes where all the lights were on.

128
00:06:28,424 --> 00:06:34,104
It was crazy when all the lights were on how much it just looks like like a local carnival

129
00:06:34,104 --> 00:06:34,924
spook house or something.

130
00:06:35,044 --> 00:06:40,404
There's so much like, you know, that's not like a super complex ride in terms of the

131
00:06:40,404 --> 00:06:42,424
actual structures itself.

132
00:06:42,584 --> 00:06:45,824
Feels like most of the effort was put into like the game system.

133
00:06:46,104 --> 00:06:49,584
So then when the lights go up here like this is just like a bunch of plywood cutouts

134
00:06:49,584 --> 00:06:53,764
and we stopped right in the room right after Zerg.

135
00:06:54,504 --> 00:06:56,064
So I was like we stopped in the Zerg room.

136
00:06:56,084 --> 00:06:59,024
I'd be like really studying Zerg and I'd have something to look at.

137
00:06:59,384 --> 00:07:03,784
Probably one of the more impressive components of it in a sort of a chintzy ride.

138
00:07:03,964 --> 00:07:08,684
Otherwise, it's just a bunch of like non-moving cutouts and then they had to like it felt

139
00:07:09,084 --> 00:07:16,824
like a like a school sort of fire drill where they waited and they let everyone out one by one.

140
00:07:16,884 --> 00:07:21,124
They made us all line up against the wall and they had to march us out single file line.

141
00:07:21,124 --> 00:07:23,184
And they were like everyone stay please.

142
00:07:23,344 --> 00:07:29,764
And one guy and his significant other was trying to get a photo with all the robots.

143
00:07:29,784 --> 00:07:34,064
So he kept on moving around in the line back and forth to be like, excuse me, I just need

144
00:07:34,064 --> 00:07:38,664
I'm all about these robots and was taking photos of him with the cutouts.

145
00:07:38,664 --> 00:07:40,244
Which aren't great photos.

146
00:07:40,864 --> 00:07:41,004
Right.

147
00:07:41,344 --> 00:07:42,604
The lighting must be terrible.

148
00:07:43,104 --> 00:07:44,004
And the lighting is terrible.

149
00:07:44,024 --> 00:07:45,764
And you're just like, oh weird, those are like vents.

150
00:07:45,844 --> 00:07:47,364
Those are like lighting grids.

151
00:07:47,564 --> 00:07:50,064
Like all the things that are hidden by the black lighting.

152
00:07:50,384 --> 00:07:53,144
It's just kind of a nondescript warehouse now.

153
00:07:53,164 --> 00:07:53,524
Right.

154
00:07:53,604 --> 00:07:58,604
And also if you never like we're all so we're all busy when we're going on that ride.

155
00:07:58,844 --> 00:08:01,704
If you like stop if you weren't shooting and you just stopped.

156
00:08:01,884 --> 00:08:03,324
I'm just going to watch this time.

157
00:08:03,324 --> 00:08:06,124
You'd be like this is the lamest ride ever made.

158
00:08:06,144 --> 00:08:09,844
Because if you go like between the game ones it's like I think Men in Black is probably

159
00:08:09,844 --> 00:08:12,724
more interesting as a ride as a space.

160
00:08:13,604 --> 00:08:15,844
Certainly Toy Story Mania is doing a different thing.

161
00:08:17,044 --> 00:08:19,084
But is more visually engaging.

162
00:08:19,664 --> 00:08:24,204
Astro Blaster's really like got the advantage of being the first like shoot them up kind of one.

163
00:08:25,104 --> 00:08:25,404
Yeah.

164
00:08:25,404 --> 00:08:25,864
Yeah.

165
00:08:25,864 --> 00:08:26,144
Yeah.

166
00:08:26,144 --> 00:08:27,484
So it didn't have to try as hard.

167
00:08:27,584 --> 00:08:28,004
Exactly.

168
00:08:28,184 --> 00:08:28,284
Right.

169
00:08:28,444 --> 00:08:29,664
I think the novelty was pushing them.

170
00:08:29,684 --> 00:08:29,824
Sure.

171
00:08:30,144 --> 00:08:30,524
Yeah.

172
00:08:30,544 --> 00:08:34,864
Well it sounds like this walk off is not like a this is not a thrilling one.

173
00:08:34,924 --> 00:08:35,644
It was a boring one.

174
00:08:35,644 --> 00:08:36,304
Sort of functional.

175
00:08:36,424 --> 00:08:38,784
Because I was like they might let us through like a weird back area.

176
00:08:38,984 --> 00:08:39,284
All right.

177
00:08:39,304 --> 00:08:40,504
An employee break room.

178
00:08:41,004 --> 00:08:44,344
And instead they just marched us through the ride back through the main entrance.

179
00:08:44,504 --> 00:08:45,424
It's something.

180
00:08:45,544 --> 00:08:49,304
But when you said walk off my mind raced with all the possibilities.

181
00:08:49,304 --> 00:08:52,344
I started like really like shaking with excitement.

182
00:08:52,444 --> 00:08:52,764
Yeah.

183
00:08:52,764 --> 00:08:54,804
We got one free fast pass.

184
00:08:55,064 --> 00:08:55,384
Okay.

185
00:08:55,884 --> 00:08:58,624
They like gave us a fast pass that we could use on anything else.

186
00:08:58,744 --> 00:09:00,244
But not on Radiator Springs.

187
00:09:00,984 --> 00:09:02,424
No because that's what we tried to do.

188
00:09:02,444 --> 00:09:05,624
We were like tomorrow we'll go to California Adventure and we'll use it on either radiator

189
00:09:05,624 --> 00:09:07,024
springs or guardians of the galaxy.

190
00:09:07,624 --> 00:09:09,364
And they were like limited to the park.

191
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:09,704
Yeah.

192
00:09:09,724 --> 00:09:10,644
To go back to Disneyland.

193
00:09:10,924 --> 00:09:11,744
Oh bummer.

194
00:09:12,084 --> 00:09:17,524
And Disneyland with rain was pretty fine and nothing had a crazy long wait.

195
00:09:18,064 --> 00:09:22,864
California Adventure has so few big ticket things that especially when one or two of

196
00:09:22,864 --> 00:09:26,724
them are shut down because of the rain if a credit coaster and like radiator springs

197
00:09:26,724 --> 00:09:29,324
are down then everything else goes so up.

198
00:09:29,844 --> 00:09:30,424
On the wait time.

199
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:34,664
Yeah we did not have as much luck nearly as much as is in main Disneyland.

200
00:09:34,664 --> 00:09:38,124
Yeah Disneyland really like the rain felt like a life hack.

201
00:09:38,164 --> 00:09:41,504
Like we had really figured something out and I was like I can't even imagine how

202
00:09:41,504 --> 00:09:44,144
much it's going to help us at California Adventure and it didn't.

203
00:09:44,144 --> 00:09:44,384
Yeah.

204
00:09:44,384 --> 00:09:45,024
Yeah.

205
00:09:45,024 --> 00:09:45,544
Yeah.

206
00:09:45,544 --> 00:09:52,384
And we ended up there's a big stretch of just like I split a corndog with my friend

207
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:54,524
in terrible terrible storm.

208
00:09:54,864 --> 00:09:55,964
Just like that was the moment.

209
00:09:56,464 --> 00:09:56,844
Hold on.

210
00:09:56,864 --> 00:09:58,204
I'm sorry I'm describing it as a bad start.

211
00:09:58,524 --> 00:10:00,144
How does that work?

212
00:10:00,404 --> 00:10:02,424
Are you just passing it back and forth and bites?

213
00:10:02,524 --> 00:10:04,364
Are you dissecting it down the middle?

214
00:10:05,244 --> 00:10:05,764
Hmm.

215
00:10:05,784 --> 00:10:06,864
That'd be one way of doing it.

216
00:10:06,864 --> 00:10:07,724
By length or by width?

217
00:10:08,044 --> 00:10:08,904
Where were you splitting those?

218
00:10:09,184 --> 00:10:13,104
Wait now I'm confused which is just down.

219
00:10:13,424 --> 00:10:15,524
No no no like kind of at the at the stick.

220
00:10:16,224 --> 00:10:21,364
So one one of us took the sticked half and the other the other one took the non sticked half.

221
00:10:21,904 --> 00:10:21,924
Okay.

222
00:10:21,924 --> 00:10:26,364
Oh so you weren't sharing it like lovers just handing it back and forth.

223
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:27,804
No no no.

224
00:10:27,864 --> 00:10:32,064
Or lady in the champ style if you took it off the stick and each started on one end.

225
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:32,504
Yes.

226
00:10:32,504 --> 00:10:35,484
Without the stick that's but with the stick somebody is choking.

227
00:10:35,684 --> 00:10:36,144
Sure sure.

228
00:10:36,144 --> 00:10:37,184
Somebody's smaller than stick.

229
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:43,324
No yeah we both agreed we only each wanted half of a corndog.

230
00:10:43,364 --> 00:10:47,764
We made it work but it was a weird sad like going to a restaurant that was barely open

231
00:10:47,764 --> 00:10:52,584
and getting hard silverware and then just leaving it out on a rainy trash can.

232
00:10:53,264 --> 00:10:55,484
Did you mobile order to get it or did you wait?

233
00:10:56,464 --> 00:10:58,624
We waited in a lack of weight.

234
00:10:59,064 --> 00:10:59,544
Okay.

235
00:10:59,684 --> 00:11:00,084
Yes.

236
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:00,764
Got it.

237
00:11:02,904 --> 00:11:08,784
Yeah so it wouldn't have impacted us either way I suppose but I'll I'll you'll get me on this

238
00:11:08,784 --> 00:11:09,864
mobile ordering train.

239
00:11:09,864 --> 00:11:11,624
I will you mobile order at Starbucks.

240
00:11:11,624 --> 00:11:12,924
I've seen you do it.

241
00:11:12,944 --> 00:11:17,604
I did it and then I heard you murmuring to Jason behind oh well now.

242
00:11:18,004 --> 00:11:18,804
Yeah.

243
00:11:18,804 --> 00:11:20,344
I'm like see he likes mobile ordering.

244
00:11:20,404 --> 00:11:22,724
Once again I'm not against doing it.

245
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:29,304
I was against doing it in the one scenario where we were 10 feet away from the actual place.

246
00:11:29,464 --> 00:11:32,084
I was just didn't want to like figure I was walking.

247
00:11:32,084 --> 00:11:33,244
I didn't want to.

248
00:11:33,404 --> 00:11:38,104
No I know I just like I like the early adopt I like to be an early adopter as you know.

249
00:11:38,504 --> 00:11:38,644
Yeah.

250
00:11:38,644 --> 00:11:39,984
I like to it's fun for me.

251
00:11:40,044 --> 00:11:42,864
Do you do you like mobile stuff did you do any of that at Disney?

252
00:11:43,444 --> 00:11:47,084
I just did it to check the the lines and everything.

253
00:11:47,184 --> 00:11:48,044
You didn't do MaxPass?

254
00:11:48,604 --> 00:11:53,784
We didn't which I feel like maybe might have held California Adventure it felt like it really

255
00:11:53,784 --> 00:11:54,724
would have been worth it.

256
00:11:54,764 --> 00:11:56,524
There may be but not main Disneyland.

257
00:11:56,944 --> 00:11:59,704
But Disneyland we had a pretty good run of it.

258
00:11:59,704 --> 00:12:02,144
The mobile ordering thing I was a little scared to do.

259
00:12:02,224 --> 00:12:04,044
I mean it also is that thing sorry.

260
00:12:04,204 --> 00:12:04,584
That's okay.

261
00:12:05,244 --> 00:12:12,444
Where it's like it never felt like ordering by mobile would have saved me time.

262
00:12:13,064 --> 00:12:18,744
This was my argument in the one case that I've been scolded for many times over.

263
00:12:19,104 --> 00:12:21,344
We're 10 feet away from the restaurant.

264
00:12:21,344 --> 00:12:21,944
Yeah.

265
00:12:22,684 --> 00:12:25,344
We ended up tied we tied we literally tied.

266
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:29,464
We tied with food but then I said of course in the most smug way possible

267
00:12:29,464 --> 00:12:31,224
I didn't have to wait in line though.

268
00:12:31,624 --> 00:12:35,104
Here's where I saw oh this is how this could be an advantage.

269
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:38,344
Let's say the Dole Whip Stand line is really long.

270
00:12:38,404 --> 00:12:38,724
Sure.

271
00:12:38,864 --> 00:12:43,364
And you go okay cool I'm going to place a mobile order while I'm in Enchanted Tiki room.

272
00:12:43,484 --> 00:12:43,764
Yes.

273
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:46,164
And when I come out it's just there waiting for me.

274
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:46,544
Certainly.

275
00:12:46,904 --> 00:12:52,044
I save time but otherwise it was just like there's one person or no people there.

276
00:12:52,184 --> 00:12:52,944
Sure yeah.

277
00:12:52,984 --> 00:12:56,844
I don't know if I'm going to time out correctly getting to the place maybe it'll be cold by the

278
00:12:56,844 --> 00:12:57,884
time I get there.

279
00:12:57,884 --> 00:12:58,364
True.

280
00:12:58,384 --> 00:13:03,004
If I'm standing six feet away then it's just like me wrestling with the wi-fi.

281
00:13:03,884 --> 00:13:06,624
You hear that argument for sanity.

282
00:13:06,724 --> 00:13:10,764
He's saying one person in line which I would say yes I would probably wait in the line if

283
00:13:10,764 --> 00:13:11,944
there was one person in line.

284
00:13:11,964 --> 00:13:13,144
You say there's a hot ticket item.

285
00:13:13,604 --> 00:13:14,324
I'm just saying.

286
00:13:14,344 --> 00:13:14,684
Sure.

287
00:13:14,984 --> 00:13:17,364
And I'm just saying it's fun I'm just saying I like it and it's fun.

288
00:13:17,724 --> 00:13:22,824
Sometimes too you want to see the sample item like if you don't know what it's like oh what

289
00:13:23,244 --> 00:13:25,144
what does that look like.

290
00:13:25,884 --> 00:13:27,124
Yes that's true.

291
00:13:27,544 --> 00:13:32,024
They have like those weird they're like rubber versions of the food sometimes.

292
00:13:32,204 --> 00:13:35,344
Or sometimes they just prepare one and leave it out for eight hours.

293
00:13:35,844 --> 00:13:41,024
Well I'll tell you my biggest complaint I had with the food thing is I get the app.

294
00:13:41,244 --> 00:13:45,784
I'm seeing oh online you can order in advance to the place of reservation whatever.

295
00:13:46,484 --> 00:13:51,084
My girlfriend the whole trip was Jones in for cheese fries and I was like there has

296
00:13:51,084 --> 00:13:55,824
to be a place here where you can get cheese fries but they don't let you search by item.

297
00:13:56,144 --> 00:13:56,564
Oh yeah I know.

298
00:13:56,564 --> 00:14:02,604
Which I think would be very valuable if you could search because so many of the little stands are

299
00:14:02,604 --> 00:14:04,524
like specialized to one or two things.

300
00:14:04,684 --> 00:14:05,044
Yeah that's a good idea.

301
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:08,684
And you're like I want a hot dog but like golden horseshoe might not have it.

302
00:14:08,924 --> 00:14:09,564
Let me search for that.

303
00:14:09,684 --> 00:14:14,244
Then I would have a hundred percent did it and I was just there going like restaurant by restaurant

304
00:14:14,244 --> 00:14:15,864
clicking on the menu.

305
00:14:15,864 --> 00:14:16,524
Yeah.

306
00:14:16,844 --> 00:14:21,064
Would this and they seem to have chili cheese fries and I guess I could probably ask for that.

307
00:14:21,164 --> 00:14:27,524
But it's unclear if you see that it's a burger place or a chicken finger place that still doesn't

308
00:14:27,524 --> 00:14:28,484
clue you in.

309
00:14:28,664 --> 00:14:28,844
Yes.

310
00:14:28,844 --> 00:14:31,904
That still doesn't tell you is this the kind of place that would have cheese fries.

311
00:14:32,024 --> 00:14:32,384
Right.

312
00:14:32,524 --> 00:14:33,644
Did you find cheese fries?

313
00:14:33,924 --> 00:14:38,344
We didn't and that's why I come to you guys and ask you can you think off the top of your head

314
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:41,144
is there a place with cheese fries on the menu?

315
00:14:41,424 --> 00:14:45,524
As soon as you said cheese fries my mind started racing and I said huh I don't think.

316
00:14:45,544 --> 00:14:50,564
It seems so obvious and I was like there are enough like burger spots and hot dog spots and

317
00:14:50,564 --> 00:14:54,124
I looked at some and it was like she was like look I don't know if this exists.

318
00:14:54,124 --> 00:14:55,044
Ideal.

319
00:14:55,264 --> 00:15:01,164
I would love cheese waffle fries and the one in California venture the bear.

320
00:15:01,444 --> 00:15:05,584
What's the bear restaurant there or it's the other one that's like the aviation themed

321
00:15:05,584 --> 00:15:06,144
restaurant.

322
00:15:06,464 --> 00:15:07,664
Oh smoke jumpers.

323
00:15:07,704 --> 00:15:07,964
Right.

324
00:15:08,104 --> 00:15:12,324
So like they have waffle fries and then they had chili cheese fries but they were regular

325
00:15:12,324 --> 00:15:13,004
fries.

326
00:15:13,544 --> 00:15:15,104
I think you could have asked.

327
00:15:15,224 --> 00:15:16,544
It would have had to be an ask.

328
00:15:17,044 --> 00:15:17,084
Yeah.

329
00:15:17,304 --> 00:15:24,344
And that always feels like a little like you know I don't know if like what do you think it is an

330
00:15:24,344 --> 00:15:29,724
okay thing to like go up to the stand at Disneyland and be like hey like off the menu is this like.

331
00:15:29,724 --> 00:15:35,264
Yeah they do like they have gone into a little like secret menu items every now and then and

332
00:15:35,264 --> 00:15:40,024
they are willing to customize especially because there's so many allergen worries nowadays.

333
00:15:40,424 --> 00:15:42,064
So we're vegetarian or vegans.

334
00:15:42,264 --> 00:15:43,504
There are secret menu.

335
00:15:43,864 --> 00:15:51,204
There are mozzarella sticks secretly at stage door cafe right next to the golden horseshoe.

336
00:15:51,404 --> 00:15:52,204
But that's not on the menu.

337
00:15:52,304 --> 00:15:57,844
So there are a list of a few secret menu items not cheese fries I don't think at least I've

338
00:15:57,844 --> 00:15:58,064
seen.

339
00:15:58,324 --> 00:16:00,844
So I do think it's possible you could have gotten it at a different.

340
00:16:00,864 --> 00:16:04,284
I think you could have ordered the chili cheese fries and asked for it without the chili.

341
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:05,324
Yes.

342
00:16:06,284 --> 00:16:12,984
The question was could we do like the double ninja move of being like I see you have regular

343
00:16:12,984 --> 00:16:15,824
chili cheese fries and plain waffle fries.

344
00:16:16,164 --> 00:16:18,124
Can we get your cheese on waffle fries.

345
00:16:18,524 --> 00:16:22,424
But the game that we took was at that point we pretty much done everything in California

346
00:16:22,424 --> 00:16:22,944
adventure.

347
00:16:23,464 --> 00:16:27,704
We wanted to try to do another thing or two at Disneyland proper.

348
00:16:28,204 --> 00:16:29,604
It was our last night.

349
00:16:30,024 --> 00:16:32,264
We were going to drive back to L.A.

350
00:16:32,484 --> 00:16:35,644
That night and she was like let's abandon ship.

351
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:36,744
Let's go to Disneyland.

352
00:16:36,924 --> 00:16:38,104
I don't want to be around her anymore.

353
00:16:38,324 --> 00:16:39,784
Radio Springs is like too long.

354
00:16:39,784 --> 00:16:44,964
And I was like I believe I can find us cheese fries at Disneyland and went to stage door

355
00:16:44,964 --> 00:16:47,264
and it was like the same thing where it was like not there.

356
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:51,684
And I kept on going to places where I thought like this might have it looking for similar

357
00:16:51,684 --> 00:16:52,404
menu items.

358
00:16:52,764 --> 00:16:58,764
I think the menus are more flexible than we realize because if you look like a lot of things are

359
00:16:58,764 --> 00:17:03,164
tricked like kind of tricks like they're tricking you into a value meal but you can get everything

360
00:17:03,164 --> 00:17:03,664
on a card.

361
00:17:03,684 --> 00:17:05,244
It just doesn't say that on the menu.

362
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:05,644
Sure.

363
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:07,184
We do a lot of hack.

364
00:17:07,404 --> 00:17:11,064
You might have taught that I didn't have to have apple slices.

365
00:17:11,064 --> 00:17:12,104
There was a lot of that.

366
00:17:12,484 --> 00:17:16,824
There was a lot of like oh this place has burger and fries but it doesn't have fries

367
00:17:16,824 --> 00:17:17,544
as a side.

368
00:17:18,264 --> 00:17:18,384
Right.

369
00:17:18,384 --> 00:17:20,264
But I bet the side is a la carte.

370
00:17:20,324 --> 00:17:21,284
It's not on the menu.

371
00:17:21,324 --> 00:17:21,524
Yeah.

372
00:17:21,524 --> 00:17:25,284
I think there's a lot of tricks to make you try to spend three or four dollars more.

373
00:17:25,304 --> 00:17:25,604
Yeah.

374
00:17:25,664 --> 00:17:29,904
And if you just ask I think I will try next time.

375
00:17:30,044 --> 00:17:30,284
I will.

376
00:17:30,384 --> 00:17:34,384
A la carte fries they would probably charge you a buck or two to add cheese to that.

377
00:17:34,584 --> 00:17:35,424
But I'm sure you could do it.

378
00:17:35,424 --> 00:17:36,024
Let's try.

379
00:17:36,164 --> 00:17:36,844
Let's figure it out.

380
00:17:37,164 --> 00:17:41,404
You guys having the hometown advantage you're more confident in doing things like that.

381
00:17:41,404 --> 00:17:42,944
And I was like this is not my place.

382
00:17:42,944 --> 00:17:44,064
I don't want to overstep.

383
00:17:44,144 --> 00:17:44,784
I'm a visitor.

384
00:17:44,784 --> 00:17:49,904
You were especially I mean you were you were not just a guest of the parks you were

385
00:17:49,904 --> 00:17:51,044
staying on site.

386
00:17:51,124 --> 00:17:54,424
So they want to keep you happy for your vacation experience.

387
00:17:54,544 --> 00:17:58,044
I don't want to order the incorrect thing and then when I walk away they immediately

388
00:17:58,044 --> 00:18:01,004
call up Disneyland Hotel and go like this guy's a problem.

389
00:18:01,584 --> 00:18:02,184
Red alert.

390
00:18:02,204 --> 00:18:03,144
Evict this man.

391
00:18:03,164 --> 00:18:04,044
On watch.

392
00:18:04,544 --> 00:18:06,264
I think you'd have to do a lot.

393
00:18:06,264 --> 00:18:10,904
I do overreach you in operating on John Gotti rules.

394
00:18:10,904 --> 00:18:16,704
This was a great sign of respect that you tweeted at me and asked what is the best ice

395
00:18:16,704 --> 00:18:18,404
cream option at California Adventure.

396
00:18:19,024 --> 00:18:20,684
We kind of marginally fucked it up.

397
00:18:21,124 --> 00:18:22,604
No I think you did all right.

398
00:18:22,944 --> 00:18:26,804
Like you ordered because I said ice cream Gotti over here.

399
00:18:27,024 --> 00:18:29,844
Oh I don't want that Nick.

400
00:18:30,044 --> 00:18:30,464
Yeah I don't know.

401
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:33,844
Claire Bell let me do some Claire Bell's greatest ice cream in the world.

402
00:18:33,864 --> 00:18:35,944
All of the ice cream locations.

403
00:18:36,344 --> 00:18:39,324
Claire Bell's, Gierdelli's, Gibson Girl.

404
00:18:40,064 --> 00:18:45,264
I said either a sundae from Gierdelli or the ice cream bars that you can customize.

405
00:18:46,384 --> 00:18:49,224
And you guys got a Sunday Sunday.

406
00:18:49,364 --> 00:18:50,384
I'm sure that's good.

407
00:18:50,384 --> 00:18:53,684
Because they use the frozen banana chocolate bananas as ears.

408
00:18:53,984 --> 00:18:58,944
You get that weird little sculptural sink that also looks like the pants of either Mickey

409
00:18:58,944 --> 00:18:59,604
or me.

410
00:18:59,884 --> 00:19:05,424
Mashed up the concept of the kitchen like everything in the kitchen sink with Mickey's

411
00:19:05,424 --> 00:19:05,784
pants.

412
00:19:05,864 --> 00:19:07,164
Yeah or Minnie's skirt.

413
00:19:07,404 --> 00:19:07,484
Yeah.

414
00:19:07,484 --> 00:19:08,924
You took the pants home right?

415
00:19:10,264 --> 00:19:10,404
Oh.

416
00:19:10,404 --> 00:19:11,164
Oh Chris.

417
00:19:11,204 --> 00:19:13,824
So you could have at least brought them here.

418
00:19:14,064 --> 00:19:14,944
I know.

419
00:19:15,104 --> 00:19:17,444
Jason would love to eat his ice cream out of pants every night.

420
00:19:17,884 --> 00:19:20,544
We were like looking we were like this is such a fun thing.

421
00:19:20,584 --> 00:19:21,804
I could put this in my bathroom.

422
00:19:21,864 --> 00:19:23,184
A little soap dish.

423
00:19:23,664 --> 00:19:27,044
What if this was your like jewelry like all the applications.

424
00:19:27,284 --> 00:19:29,504
So then I went and I was like would you mind washing this out so we could

425
00:19:29,504 --> 00:19:30,104
take it home.

426
00:19:30,304 --> 00:19:34,964
And the woman said we are not allowed to wash them but you can bring it to the bathroom

427
00:19:34,964 --> 00:19:36,084
and wash it yourself.

428
00:19:36,444 --> 00:19:38,424
And the closest bathroom was a little bit of a walk.

429
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:43,844
So I was like walking with this thing that was covered with like chocolate syrup and

430
00:19:43,844 --> 00:19:46,884
residue like holding it out like this.

431
00:19:46,884 --> 00:19:47,064
Uh huh.

432
00:19:47,064 --> 00:19:47,624
Well that's weird.

433
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:52,684
Sometimes they will there will be a disposable like bowl or container within that.

434
00:19:52,704 --> 00:19:54,484
So you just throw that out and you are left.

435
00:19:54,504 --> 00:19:55,384
They were not doing that.

436
00:19:55,544 --> 00:19:59,484
And I also feel like a lot of restaurants because I'm a big guy where like if

437
00:19:59,484 --> 00:20:03,284
for five extra dollars I can get the collectible glass I will get the collectible glass.

438
00:20:03,364 --> 00:20:07,344
And I feel like a lot of these places like Rainforest Cafe or whatever they will say

439
00:20:07,344 --> 00:20:10,364
I'm going to when you're ready to go home give you a new one.

440
00:20:10,384 --> 00:20:11,364
I'll give you a clean one.

441
00:20:11,704 --> 00:20:11,984
Yes.

442
00:20:11,984 --> 00:20:15,504
You paid for the glass I'm not going to make you take home this one that's got sprite lining

443
00:20:15,504 --> 00:20:16,284
on the inside.

444
00:20:16,604 --> 00:20:21,424
Although Mike brought home a bubble gum shrimp glass that was covered in sprite lining and

445
00:20:21,424 --> 00:20:22,184
crystal sugar.

446
00:20:22,564 --> 00:20:24,424
And you still haven't washed it to this day.

447
00:20:24,804 --> 00:20:26,024
I think it's been washed.

448
00:20:26,564 --> 00:20:31,604
That's when you were in the car because I drove you back here and you were licking the glass

449
00:20:31,604 --> 00:20:34,744
in the car before we realized it was non-alcoholic.

450
00:20:34,744 --> 00:20:36,444
And that's the one way you washed it.

451
00:20:36,484 --> 00:20:40,284
Well I sort of realized it but I didn't want to say until we were on the show.

452
00:20:40,284 --> 00:20:43,724
I sort of realized it when I then double checked when we were here.

453
00:20:43,864 --> 00:20:45,664
We were like fairly early in our day.

454
00:20:45,664 --> 00:20:49,564
I went through the trouble of carrying it through foot traffic to get to the bathroom

455
00:20:49,564 --> 00:20:51,944
to wash it out which probably took a full five minutes.

456
00:20:52,024 --> 00:20:53,984
Like I was taking paper towels.

457
00:20:54,124 --> 00:20:58,344
The one at the entrance or the one over by the what's the

458
00:20:58,344 --> 00:21:00,764
further down the street I guess.

459
00:21:00,764 --> 00:21:01,984
Got in Hollywood area.

460
00:21:02,404 --> 00:21:02,424
Yes.

461
00:21:02,524 --> 00:21:06,824
Oh it's by the what's the not mural but it was near the fake movie posters.

462
00:21:07,204 --> 00:21:07,364
Right.

463
00:21:07,364 --> 00:21:13,344
It was near what we call the baby rave which that Disney Junior party there the bathrooms near

464
00:21:13,344 --> 00:21:13,684
there.

465
00:21:13,684 --> 00:21:14,304
Love that name.

466
00:21:14,344 --> 00:21:19,184
So I was like standing there like wiping like I looked like a dad who was like trying to

467
00:21:19,184 --> 00:21:21,684
deal with a dirty diaper and I had like.

468
00:21:21,824 --> 00:21:23,704
You thought there was an imaginary baby in the pants.

469
00:21:23,704 --> 00:21:25,484
I looked really like irritated.

470
00:21:25,484 --> 00:21:29,504
I was trying to get like the syrup out of the cracks and I came out and I was like I

471
00:21:29,504 --> 00:21:33,184
did it and then we walked for another minute and I was like I don't want to carry this

472
00:21:33,184 --> 00:21:33,544
around.

473
00:21:33,844 --> 00:21:35,764
We have another six hours.

474
00:21:35,804 --> 00:21:37,264
I don't want to carry this around.

475
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:41,444
Becoming abundantly clear why people suggest that you come on this podcast.

476
00:21:41,444 --> 00:21:44,704
We're on the same level.

477
00:21:44,724 --> 00:21:49,904
I was saying to them before you got here that I had recently listened to your speed racer

478
00:21:49,904 --> 00:21:52,284
episode as a movie I'm very fond of.

479
00:21:52,284 --> 00:21:53,144
Masterpiece.

480
00:21:53,164 --> 00:22:01,084
Yeah and I was I looked this up today because so the episode length on your show is an hour

481
00:22:01,084 --> 00:22:01,904
and 58 minutes.

482
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:07,344
The movie itself is two fifteen so just seventeen minutes shy of the runtime of the movie.

483
00:22:07,364 --> 00:22:11,404
We now unfortunately have gotten to the point where most episodes are longer than the movie.

484
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:13,604
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

485
00:22:13,604 --> 00:22:15,044
Yeah we're we're well past that.

486
00:22:15,344 --> 00:22:19,504
Yeah which is will be no problem with this thing because the movie is very short.

487
00:22:19,944 --> 00:22:20,444
Yeah of course.

488
00:22:21,304 --> 00:22:25,264
We've already surpassed it but this is a very brisk podcast.

489
00:22:25,264 --> 00:22:26,764
It's extremely yeah.

490
00:22:26,944 --> 00:22:27,684
Very lots running.

491
00:22:27,964 --> 00:22:31,244
I asked if we could push this up and you were like well you know if it's a concern we could

492
00:22:31,244 --> 00:22:34,824
always keep it tight and it's like I'm not going on podcast the ride to do a sixty two

493
00:22:34,824 --> 00:22:35,584
minute episode.

494
00:22:36,064 --> 00:22:37,744
If I'm coming here I'm coming here to play.

495
00:22:37,884 --> 00:22:39,124
Like we're doing full fledged.

496
00:22:39,164 --> 00:22:40,564
I don't want to be in any sort of rush.

497
00:22:41,084 --> 00:22:45,384
Yeah you know the day also tell I know you got to get out of your tongue but you steer

498
00:22:45,384 --> 00:22:48,964
the ship if you need to leave but because obviously we and it's a good topic too.

499
00:22:49,184 --> 00:22:53,824
I brought my luggage here and I'm leaving for the airport from this apartment tomorrow

500
00:22:53,824 --> 00:22:54,244
morning.

501
00:22:54,364 --> 00:22:55,244
I'm here to record.

502
00:22:55,644 --> 00:22:55,924
Oh okay.

503
00:22:56,184 --> 00:22:56,944
All right.

504
00:22:58,924 --> 00:23:02,464
What was the thing I was going to say about carrying around the thing?

505
00:23:03,524 --> 00:23:08,184
Oh well you I mean just you saying it's clear why why people wanted you to be on this podcast.

506
00:23:08,704 --> 00:23:13,544
My my two friends Ben and David who I do the podcast with I invoke like theme park stuff

507
00:23:13,544 --> 00:23:16,624
a lot and they just don't fucking get it.

508
00:23:16,624 --> 00:23:17,024
Yeah.

509
00:23:17,084 --> 00:23:21,444
And I was trying to convince them because we've covered avatar and we're similarly kind

510
00:23:21,444 --> 00:23:26,104
of like some order you might like into like the weird world building of avatar that no

511
00:23:26,104 --> 00:23:27,064
one actually loves.

512
00:23:27,264 --> 00:23:27,424
Right.

513
00:23:27,604 --> 00:23:32,304
Unless you get the sort of Stockholm syndrome that folks like you and I are are susceptible

514
00:23:32,304 --> 00:23:39,044
to like your ironic investigation into the marginalia makes you just love it.

515
00:23:39,064 --> 00:23:39,364
Yeah.

516
00:23:39,364 --> 00:23:43,024
Which is I've answered this question before a friend of ours was like I've listened to

517
00:23:43,024 --> 00:23:43,564
a lot of this podcast.

518
00:23:43,684 --> 00:23:45,284
Do they like avatar or not?

519
00:23:45,284 --> 00:23:47,124
And I was like I don't know.

520
00:23:47,284 --> 00:23:48,484
I don't think we're clear anymore.

521
00:23:48,504 --> 00:23:50,364
Well wait have I gone on the record about this?

522
00:23:50,404 --> 00:23:53,704
I have never seen avatar from start to finish.

523
00:23:54,264 --> 00:23:56,224
I don't know if you've ever seen it.

524
00:23:56,224 --> 00:23:58,324
That's not very mighty of you.

525
00:23:58,664 --> 00:23:59,864
No it's not.

526
00:24:01,064 --> 00:24:05,104
You must Sivako rise to the challenge.

527
00:24:05,784 --> 00:24:09,844
I think that's what that means or it means I see you I can't remember.

528
00:24:10,084 --> 00:24:12,104
It's on demand a lot.

529
00:24:12,304 --> 00:24:15,984
It's on I see it as an option on planes sometimes.

530
00:24:16,144 --> 00:24:19,984
Like if I'm watching movies on my iPad on like American Airlines and I'm like this would

531
00:24:19,984 --> 00:24:23,044
be very funny to see avatar for the first time.

532
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:23,384
Yeah.

533
00:24:23,384 --> 00:24:27,524
On my like seven year old iPad screen.

534
00:24:27,764 --> 00:24:33,444
It does feel like every airline was like whatever they're asking for it's worth the

535
00:24:33,444 --> 00:24:36,884
money to get a 10 year licensing deal for avatar on every flight.

536
00:24:37,084 --> 00:24:37,344
Yes.

537
00:24:37,484 --> 00:24:42,024
People are not going to stop rewatching this thing because it is no matter what airline

538
00:24:42,464 --> 00:24:45,624
technology they have avatar is always an option.

539
00:24:45,964 --> 00:24:50,964
Avatar and when I flew for Christmas all the mission impossibles and I'm like well I'm

540
00:24:50,964 --> 00:24:53,904
not opening the book I brought to read on the plane.

541
00:24:55,304 --> 00:24:59,684
Yeah but I well what do you where do you land?

542
00:25:00,004 --> 00:25:02,304
If you had to chart the avatar appreciation.

543
00:25:02,624 --> 00:25:07,684
I mean I like I think I love it but I also don't know that I would stand here and argue

544
00:25:07,684 --> 00:25:11,144
that it's great but I also fight people who say that it's bad.

545
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:16,264
Like I feel like sometimes now people are like you know world's biggest avatar fan like

546
00:25:16,264 --> 00:25:20,824
pointing over to me and I'm like because I think it's like a pretty respectable like seven.

547
00:25:21,244 --> 00:25:21,624
You know.

548
00:25:21,704 --> 00:25:24,004
That makes you a go to the mat die hard.

549
00:25:24,004 --> 00:25:24,344
Right.

550
00:25:24,384 --> 00:25:25,684
Just because nobody is that.

551
00:25:26,084 --> 00:25:29,944
Right I'll admit like I don't know like the Navi phrases like you do.

552
00:25:30,264 --> 00:25:37,504
There are other things I've gone deeper into but I do feel this deep appreciation for I think

553
00:25:37,504 --> 00:25:39,604
just the functionality of the thing.

554
00:25:40,164 --> 00:25:44,724
I think it's a very functional movie which sounds like a backhanded compliment but it's

555
00:25:44,724 --> 00:25:47,104
like that's just like Karen showing you what he can do.

556
00:25:47,604 --> 00:25:51,564
I never watched the movie and go like man I really want to learn about this world

557
00:25:51,564 --> 00:25:57,144
but then when I went to the theme park I was like I get this like this kind of works better as

558
00:25:57,144 --> 00:26:00,744
a sub land in a theme park than it does as a movie franchise.

559
00:26:01,024 --> 00:26:04,204
I mean I think cars of that as that way too.

560
00:26:04,224 --> 00:26:04,424
Yeah.

561
00:26:04,424 --> 00:26:09,924
It's fun to walk around Radar Springs more than it is to maybe sit down and watch a cars movie.

562
00:26:10,004 --> 00:26:14,564
Right and my girlfriend has not seen any of the cars movies because of my searing hot

563
00:26:14,564 --> 00:26:19,484
they're okay takes but we are walking around Radar Springs and she was like this is incredible

564
00:26:19,484 --> 00:26:24,484
and I was like yeah what you don't even understand is they're basing it off a very specific like

565
00:26:24,484 --> 00:26:30,124
the spatial relations between the buildings is exactly what it is in the movie and she was like

566
00:26:30,124 --> 00:26:32,364
I don't care about any of that this just looks nice.

567
00:26:32,384 --> 00:26:32,824
Yeah.

568
00:26:32,824 --> 00:26:36,304
And she just interpreted all as like this is like fun theming.

569
00:26:36,324 --> 00:26:38,764
This is just a cool Disneyland idea.

570
00:26:38,764 --> 00:26:45,324
Gotcha yeah yeah yeah so it's almost like we're in this weird world where the movie is just part of

571
00:26:45,324 --> 00:26:49,564
the bits one building block of a general universe that's been created.

572
00:26:49,564 --> 00:26:49,964
Right.

573
00:26:49,964 --> 00:26:54,824
Maybe that's where Avatar has landed where like yeah do you like Avatar yeah I like the theme park

574
00:26:54,824 --> 00:26:59,024
I kind of like the movie Avatar it's like not even the primary.

575
00:26:59,384 --> 00:27:04,104
The theme park is good and then the promise of the next five movies are what I really like.

576
00:27:04,324 --> 00:27:10,644
Yeah I mean I'm I'm in love with that I just I love how it feels like someone made this joke on

577
00:27:10,644 --> 00:27:16,384
Twitter but like Cameron with the Avatar sequels was just like the principal in Breakfast Club

578
00:27:16,384 --> 00:27:20,344
where he's challenging Bender to how much detention he wants

579
00:27:20,344 --> 00:27:24,964
and like he announces I'm making two and three and everyone's like I don't know if we really

580
00:27:24,964 --> 00:27:30,504
want to see him he's like okay four like he just kept on doubling down the more people were like

581
00:27:30,504 --> 00:27:34,984
no one cares about this franchise anymore he just increased the threat.

582
00:27:35,084 --> 00:27:40,204
And they're going to be giant hits and I like I you can't bet against this maniac.

583
00:27:40,204 --> 00:27:44,004
You can't and everyone's going to like them when they come out five years later everyone's

584
00:27:44,004 --> 00:27:48,064
going to go that sucked and 10 years after everyone's going to go it kind of rules right.

585
00:27:48,424 --> 00:27:52,944
I mean like I feel like we're back in the period where everyone agrees that Titanic's the best

586
00:27:53,084 --> 00:27:57,964
and I feel like there was that arc of just like well it's Titanic and then everyone's like

587
00:27:57,964 --> 00:28:02,504
Titanic's stupid like why did we all fall for that and now everyone's like come back around to like

588
00:28:02,504 --> 00:28:06,964
I guess it's like a modern classic. What a bizarre he makes these things that are these living

589
00:28:06,964 --> 00:28:12,024
organisms that their their appreciation changes throughout time and their perception.

590
00:28:12,864 --> 00:28:18,924
They have their own ecosystems. Yeah right right. Yeah he I don't know what it is what magic that man has.

591
00:28:19,424 --> 00:28:24,584
Sounds from all the stories I've ever heard a maniac a crazy person. Yeah but like he always

592
00:28:24,584 --> 00:28:29,324
wins. He always wins. He always. Mike's going to be coming in we're going to come in one day

593
00:28:29,324 --> 00:28:35,584
in a couple years and Mike's going to be wearing like the seed bearer t-shirt right.

594
00:28:37,164 --> 00:28:43,164
One of them is called the seed bearer. I mean I'd rather wear a Navi Shaman of Song shirt from the

595
00:28:43,164 --> 00:28:47,684
Orlando ride because it's right specific but if the seed bearer ends up being on the ride somehow

596
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:53,264
yes I will have a lot of seed bearer merch. Some of the avatar merch from World of Pandora in

597
00:28:53,264 --> 00:29:02,984
Orlando looks very much like the wildlife t-shirts that kids would sell as fundraisers in school.

598
00:29:03,264 --> 00:29:07,544
Did anyone else ever encounter this? Yeah I know you talk a lot. You mean just like a shirt with like a like a

599
00:29:07,544 --> 00:29:15,704
creepy panther on it or? Yeah. With like a panda or like dolphins or you'd see them at aquariums. Like a sort of dramatic oil painting of like nature.

600
00:29:16,444 --> 00:29:21,484
You would bring like a thing home and show it to your parents and then they go I guess you can get

601
00:29:21,484 --> 00:29:27,664
one of these and then like you'd mark down what you want and bring in like a check for $25 and it's

602
00:29:27,664 --> 00:29:33,364
just some scam. It was a scholastic book club where it was like oh but they have like Rugrats bookmarks this month.

603
00:29:33,584 --> 00:29:37,784
Yeah and it's just to fleece your parents out of more money. There's nothing other than that.

604
00:29:38,144 --> 00:29:45,444
Or the um did you guys sell pizza kits? Pizza? What? Nope. These kits you would get up like you would

605
00:29:46,264 --> 00:29:52,824
okay it was like a box you would place an order and then a month later you would have to come

606
00:29:52,824 --> 00:29:57,344
and pick up or the kid you bought it from their family would have to bring this to you it was like

607
00:29:57,344 --> 00:30:03,264
a box and you open it up and it had like the crust and the sauce and the cheese and the pepperoni

608
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:10,904
so you could make pizzas or garlic bread at home so but you were paying an insane yeah we would

609
00:30:11,264 --> 00:30:15,344
They were big hits like yeah people would sell them. Would you just sell them to like family?

610
00:30:15,344 --> 00:30:21,504
Your town's local economy ran solely on pizza kits. I don't even remember what we were fundraising for

611
00:30:21,504 --> 00:30:24,984
now that I'm saying this. Did you sell them to your family or would you like be on the street corner?

612
00:30:25,204 --> 00:30:33,844
My dad would take the orders to work. We'd take them to like church. We'd sell them to other people

613
00:30:33,844 --> 00:30:41,144
like other families like neighbors and stuff. Was it like a branded like was like Prago making these

614
00:30:41,144 --> 00:30:47,164
pizza kits or was this like a company that just sold those? This is just the pizza company their

615
00:30:47,164 --> 00:30:52,324
one product is all the ingredients for pizza in one box. Because eventually because people would

616
00:30:52,324 --> 00:30:58,604
in Salisbury, Pennsylvania a lot of fundraising is selling Hershey bars is selling like boxes like

617
00:30:58,604 --> 00:31:05,864
the candy out here there's that candy company. Toblerone or I don't know. I feel like that was

618
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:11,144
the thing where it's like you're gonna buy a bulk box of candy bars and you sell them to raise money

619
00:31:11,144 --> 00:31:16,704
for the school or whatever. Every so often someone would be like I'm sick of doing the candy fundraisers.

620
00:31:16,804 --> 00:31:23,104
Let's up the ante with the pizza kits. How big and heavy were these boxes? Incredibly big.

621
00:31:23,724 --> 00:31:29,124
Because each one would make three pizzas work. Right because it feels like the whole idea is like

622
00:31:29,124 --> 00:31:35,964
well like one kid can very easily carry 50 Hershey bars. Yes. Right. But like you could carry what two

623
00:31:35,964 --> 00:31:43,644
pizza kits at a time? Yeah they were the size of like those candy bar suitcase. Each one was the size

624
00:31:43,644 --> 00:31:48,584
of one entire suitcase. You wouldn't you wouldn't go around selling those you would just have an order

625
00:31:50,844 --> 00:31:57,224
and then they would come up and pick pick up your boxes of pizza kits to then deliver to your

626
00:31:57,224 --> 00:32:03,584
customers. If you had to take them around from place to place? Yeah but you know when you're

627
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:08,704
like 11 or 12 you don't have a car so your parents are just delivering pizza kits.

628
00:32:09,004 --> 00:32:17,164
It would be both easier and less cumbersome to deliver actual pizzas. Yeah. Oh yeah.

629
00:32:18,684 --> 00:32:24,984
Tastier. Yeah. You need more money off of it. Better margins. Yeah just go to a local ranch because that's another option.

630
00:32:25,524 --> 00:32:30,944
You go to like Little Caesars or Domino's or Pizza Hut. You get a bunch of hot and red. You load them up in the car.

631
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:36,464
But like you can arrange that like they can write that off on their tax and like the business and

632
00:32:36,464 --> 00:32:43,464
it's like okay did everyone go go order pizza Friday night at this Domino's and we get like

633
00:32:43,464 --> 00:32:48,684
5% of that night's orders or something. I just want to circle back around to the fact that we got into

634
00:32:48,684 --> 00:32:55,564
this topic with you saying or you know those pizza kits you sell as a kid. Well the t-shirts. I've never heard that.

635
00:32:55,704 --> 00:33:00,764
I know 10 years worth of weird childhood stories from you and I've never heard that. So here's the thing

636
00:33:00,764 --> 00:33:07,224
I was testing the water the the wildlife t-shirts that people got that. Yeah. People understood that.

637
00:33:07,404 --> 00:33:13,144
I was like well maybe I'll push my luck with the pizza kit. Yeah well you're just more familiar

638
00:33:13,144 --> 00:33:20,624
because you have three pizza kit pizzas every week. Sure yeah. And that's good breakfast. When you go into the office in the morning

639
00:33:20,624 --> 00:33:29,204
you carry all your papers in a pizza kit and not an adashake case. Yeah. Is it how big was it compared to like a White Castle Crave case?

640
00:33:30,084 --> 00:33:36,684
Because a White Castle Crave case is kind of like this size. Much better margins. Much better margins.

641
00:33:37,344 --> 00:33:41,624
Rankings snack briefcases. What do you think the size was?

642
00:33:43,184 --> 00:33:50,164
Okay like you know when you buy a poker kit like you buy the suitcase with the chips and cards and the chip

643
00:33:50,164 --> 00:33:58,504
holder. Yeah. That sort of. I'd say about that size. And like the fold out like felt lined playing service.

644
00:33:59,324 --> 00:34:05,364
Sort of yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Sort of. Well I this is a side. I don't have children. We don't have children.

645
00:34:05,364 --> 00:34:11,004
But when I think about having children I do think I'm gonna get so annoyed when it's like the kid brings

646
00:34:11,004 --> 00:34:17,804
home a form and it's like we have to sell 20 pizza kits. I'm like what the fuck. Like I don't want it. What?

647
00:34:18,044 --> 00:34:23,484
Yeah because you're an adult and you know they do not. It's a made up need. It's not. It's fake.

648
00:34:23,804 --> 00:34:28,964
At a certain point my family did go like all right dad's gonna sell half of these at work and then

649
00:34:28,964 --> 00:34:34,824
we're gonna buy the rest. Like we're gonna. Well you stockpiled pizza kits? Yes stockpiled pizza kits.

650
00:34:35,184 --> 00:34:40,184
And then we don't have to. That's Friday night pizza night for a couple months. Wow.

651
00:34:41,144 --> 00:34:45,884
We gotta get a picture of the. I gotta find what this looks like. I'm sure it's still in business.

652
00:34:46,244 --> 00:34:52,724
Here. This grift that people were running on your Philadelphia area schools. And then popcorn. We never thankfully sold

653
00:34:52,724 --> 00:34:57,624
popcorn tins. Well that makes more sense to me than the pizza kit. That was a big with the boys scouts

654
00:34:57,624 --> 00:35:03,844
would sell popcorn tins but we always just defaulted to the candy bars. Yeah. But in the wake of following

655
00:35:03,844 --> 00:35:12,424
the success of avatars 2, 3, 4, and 5 people will go around selling kits of Navi food. Do you know a name off hand?

656
00:35:12,604 --> 00:35:20,624
I can't remember. No I don't because the sole canteen. I'm trying to think of they don't really have fun avatar names.

657
00:35:20,624 --> 00:35:26,004
What's the name of that drink they have that's like the slushy boba tea drink with the little fruit burst bubbles.

658
00:35:26,004 --> 00:35:32,664
I'm so sorry. Because when I went to World of Pandora I was like this is the best thing I've ever tasted.

659
00:35:32,704 --> 00:35:39,184
I went back for a second immediately. The next day we went again to World of Pandora. Wow. Got two of them.

660
00:35:39,204 --> 00:35:46,344
So I had like four within the span of 24 hours and after the fourth one I felt so bad that I went and took a nap

661
00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:53,744
in my friend's car in the parking lot. Oh man. Jason. In like a tired dad. 80 degree weather. But I like had the sweats.

662
00:35:53,744 --> 00:35:58,624
I thought I was gonna vomit. Yeah like I flew too close to the sun.

663
00:35:58,624 --> 00:36:06,224
All right it's called Joe Corby's. Since 1981 Joe Corby's pizza kit fundraising and the main results

664
00:36:06,224 --> 00:36:10,884
are Little Caesar's pizza kit fundraising. So Little Caesar's has gotten in on this racket.

665
00:36:11,384 --> 00:36:19,704
Wow. So a character who's eluded us up until now, Joe Corby will appear on the Patreon as a character episode I think.

666
00:36:19,704 --> 00:36:24,704
We will look into this Joe Corby character. People love this like oh well I'm gonna order some of the

667
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:29,524
the cheese bread like the garlic cheese bread which my mom hates garlic but we were like

668
00:36:29,524 --> 00:36:34,284
we really like that cheese bread but then the whole house smelled like garlic for days because

669
00:36:34,284 --> 00:36:42,344
it's just so potent and greasy. Yeah and you're just storing the raw ingredients. Yeah. Can we start a

670
00:36:42,344 --> 00:36:49,584
fundraiser on the podcast using Joe Corby's pizza kits? I don't know why we raise money.

671
00:36:52,604 --> 00:36:55,904
It's the fans getting pizzas to Jason.

672
00:36:56,044 --> 00:37:05,044
I'm gonna run this by UCB to help with the financially. It sounds like a better business

673
00:37:05,044 --> 00:37:19,564
strategy than whatever they've been doing for the last year. Having your students sell pizzas to the

674
00:37:19,964 --> 00:37:28,404
Pessar and Joe Corby. Joe Corby doing Ask Cat. You're less of a UCB person. Yeah not so much.

675
00:37:28,744 --> 00:37:34,304
Jason I find that you're in that position now where like friends and family members who like

676
00:37:34,304 --> 00:37:39,944
know you do it but don't understand the structure are like hitting you up to be like can you please

677
00:37:39,944 --> 00:37:44,484
explain to me how this place is losing money. Like I think I keep getting that question that's like

678
00:37:44,484 --> 00:37:49,564
I don't understand this. Isn't that the place where you pay to perform?

679
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:57,884
I think my mother is so unclear to what was happening. Yeah. She saw Harold once and she's

680
00:37:57,884 --> 00:38:03,204
oh yeah very nice. Like I don't think she I don't think it was like registered what we were doing

681
00:38:03,204 --> 00:38:06,664
or because she was like oh so you like kind of talked about that stuff before and then

682
00:38:06,664 --> 00:38:11,724
I was like no it's all improvised and she was like okay like skeptical still. Yeah. Still doesn't

683
00:38:11,724 --> 00:38:19,864
know about paying versus not paying. Sure. I do like one thing at UCB a year maybe maybe two and

684
00:38:19,864 --> 00:38:25,004
I and I'll end up talking to my parents and then say oh yeah it was good you know I did this bit

685
00:38:25,004 --> 00:38:29,864
at the at the UCB theater and it's as if for those couple words I started speaking Swedish

686
00:38:29,864 --> 00:38:37,084
or something. They cannot in like how long 12 13 years they cannot retain the words UCB theater.

687
00:38:37,084 --> 00:38:41,944
They will not stick in my parents brains. Which isn't a complaint. That's fine. I don't need them

688
00:38:41,944 --> 00:38:47,644
to know those words. I guess like in New York there was nothing like it before it happened. Like you

689
00:38:47,644 --> 00:38:54,904
didn't have sort of other comparable like you know IO or groundlings or any of that. So like UCB is

690
00:38:54,904 --> 00:39:02,484
like is like what band-aids are to adhesive strips. Oh you're like doing comedy you know. Oh okay.

691
00:39:02,484 --> 00:39:06,784
Oh it's that much like fundamentally. So now I feel like everyone's asking me like how is that

692
00:39:06,784 --> 00:39:13,964
possible? Don't they own comedy? Well I think New York is a much more theater centric town. Right.

693
00:39:14,504 --> 00:39:20,704
Maybe. I mean out out here and out here it's just everyone's just talking industry

694
00:39:20,704 --> 00:39:27,824
bullshit all the time. So like I don't even know how much because there's glasses seem to be doing

695
00:39:27,844 --> 00:39:35,384
just fine. But I think I mentioned it to my dad because like something came up in like a flipboard

696
00:39:35,384 --> 00:39:41,184
or whatever news aggregator he was reading. It came up or I was like or I did it preventatively.

697
00:39:41,344 --> 00:39:48,884
I was like by the way if you. Because every because he every now and then you know a news

698
00:39:48,884 --> 00:39:53,584
story will come up. Yeah. And he's like oh I saw you guys you know or I'll send an article where

699
00:39:53,584 --> 00:40:00,864
we got written up or he saw like oh I saw wild horses got a write-up or something and he I think

700
00:40:00,864 --> 00:40:07,584
I was like by the way if you see any articles about UCB. If you see anything written about that

701
00:40:07,584 --> 00:40:13,704
place where I've invested a decade of my life. Yes. Like assuring you was a good strategy.

702
00:40:13,944 --> 00:40:20,464
Right this is going to pay out in some way. Yeah the actual doing shows like really doesn't affect

703
00:40:20,544 --> 00:40:25,344
any of this nonsense. Like I had a past guest at the show Brad Evans and I were talking about like

704
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:31,684
yeah this is we have shows to do this week like doesn't really have any crossover with like poor

705
00:40:31,684 --> 00:40:37,084
questionable financial. No it's fair. The doors might not be open when we get there but

706
00:40:37,084 --> 00:40:42,304
that's it as long as they're open we'll do a show. I'll say this not trying to like take the steering

707
00:40:42,304 --> 00:40:45,924
wheel but I was saying to a friend like I was trying to explain to friends outside of comedy

708
00:40:45,924 --> 00:40:49,904
but it's like seen a bunch of my shows over the years and it knows when I was going through classes

709
00:40:50,204 --> 00:40:54,004
and everything but how crazy it is what's going on with UCB and she said you know what needs to

710
00:40:54,004 --> 00:40:59,964
happen Muppets need to put on a fundraiser. She was like that's the clear answer is like that's the model.

711
00:41:00,764 --> 00:41:05,324
Oh yeah yeah. The Muppets have to save the theater. Right yeah yeah yeah I was that's what I was

712
00:41:05,324 --> 00:41:10,704
thinking yeah on the topic of theaters that have a lot of trouble. Yes. It's a little less exciting

713
00:41:10,704 --> 00:41:19,604
of trouble than canons and explosions but yeah you want to get into it Muppet Muppet Vision 3D.

714
00:41:19,604 --> 00:41:28,584
Probably one of my 10 favorite movies. I don't doubt that that's true. I have that with theme park

715
00:41:28,584 --> 00:41:34,424
movies. It's a great film. It's a truly top to bottom great film. Well it's a great director.

716
00:41:34,684 --> 00:41:39,784
It is personally directed by Jim Henson and it's one of his final products on this earth.

717
00:41:40,404 --> 00:41:46,044
Right I mean it's this and the Disney World Special I feel like are the last two things he oversaw.

718
00:41:46,044 --> 00:41:53,024
He died 10 days after the Muppets go to Walt Disney World air. Wow yeah yeah oh my god.

719
00:41:53,924 --> 00:41:59,544
Yeah so yeah to that end this thing it truly and we will get into all of it but it does it does feel

720
00:41:59,544 --> 00:42:06,144
to me like it's very important in Muppet history because it's maybe like the the kind of the last

721
00:42:06,144 --> 00:42:11,224
hurrah like the last great thing made by the original group. There's been good Muppet things

722
00:42:11,224 --> 00:42:16,444
since but like the actual Henson's alive and everybody all the original guys are around.

723
00:42:16,444 --> 00:42:21,624
It's very special for that reason. You know he dies and Kermit's voice immediately changes along

724
00:42:21,624 --> 00:42:27,484
with other characters but it comes such a clear demarcation point. Yeah I like Steve Whitmire's

725
00:42:27,484 --> 00:42:35,044
Kermit. I grew up with you know like that being the the voice that was making new shows and movies

726
00:42:35,044 --> 00:42:40,404
constantly so it wasn't as alien to me even though I was also obsessed with the Muppet show. I was

727
00:42:40,404 --> 00:42:46,104
watching all of it together but I feel like people are like oh it's the point where like he dies

728
00:42:46,104 --> 00:42:51,004
Kermit starts sounding weird and then the other thing is it becomes of an emphasis on I think

729
00:42:51,004 --> 00:42:55,544
because now it's like his kids taking over and they're like I don't know what do we do like put

730
00:42:55,544 --> 00:43:01,744
him in other people's stories. Yeah well I am a big fan every Christmas Eve I watch Muppet Christmas

731
00:43:01,744 --> 00:43:07,304
Carol. It's a great movie. But Kermit is supporting cast at that. Yeah like Bob Cratchit is supporting

732
00:43:07,404 --> 00:43:11,604
like cast. And the model changes and it's like you have that in Treasure Island and then even a lot

733
00:43:11,604 --> 00:43:16,004
of the stuff like they did there was a VHS I used to watch it was like a straight to video Disney

734
00:43:16,004 --> 00:43:21,284
movie called like Muppet Fairytale Theater or something that was them doing like Three Little

735
00:43:21,284 --> 00:43:26,384
Pigs and all that sort of stuff and then you have like Muppets Tonight which is like I don't know

736
00:43:26,384 --> 00:43:35,484
what what if like Arsenio hosted the Muppet show. Way later that would have been hip in 92. Right and they do it in like 97.

737
00:43:35,824 --> 00:43:43,644
Yeah but there is a Prince episode on that one. Which is really good. That's good. And in saying that it exists there's such little Prince

738
00:43:43,644 --> 00:43:53,084
dude he never like hosted SNL or was in a sketch on SNL but he's in sketches with the Muppets. And that episode is so much about the symbol and the whole

739
00:43:53,084 --> 00:43:58,784
artists probably know him as Prince Bruja which I didn't know who Prince was before watching that when it

740
00:43:58,784 --> 00:44:03,644
aired and when my father explained to me Prince I was like oh and this is like the funny Muppet bit is that

741
00:44:03,644 --> 00:44:11,044
he can't use his own name right. Because it sounded like a crazy Jim Henson concept that a man's name becomes a symbol.

742
00:44:11,944 --> 00:44:17,684
Sure yeah. You thought he was like in the world. It's like the intricacies of like IP lawsuits.

743
00:44:18,724 --> 00:44:24,044
Yeah and it was all to yes you see son he's avoiding a Warner Brothers contract that he didn't want to sign.

744
00:44:24,124 --> 00:44:29,824
I watched Muppets Tonight every week when it was on. I watched it and I was so happy there was a

745
00:44:29,824 --> 00:44:35,964
regular Muppets thing. I think at that point Nickelodeon and Nick at night it was one of those weird crossovers

746
00:44:35,964 --> 00:44:41,804
where they would show the Muppet show in syndication on both. Because I would watch it every night on that.

747
00:44:41,924 --> 00:44:48,264
So I'm so excited that like oh and now there's there's new Muppet stuff and the host of Muppets Tonight is it

748
00:44:48,264 --> 00:44:54,724
Clifford? It's Clifford. Clifford yeah. Right. And he apparently in story as I was reading about this I didn't realize the joke is that

749
00:44:54,724 --> 00:44:59,844
he is the host because no one else wanted to host and Kermit's title on Muppets Tonight is producer.

750
00:44:59,924 --> 00:45:07,284
So Kermit takes the Lorne role on Muppets Tonight. It's a shot not situation where in the first episode of

751
00:45:07,284 --> 00:45:11,904
Muppets Tonight I forget who the guest is on the first one but they realize oh the show's about to

752
00:45:11,904 --> 00:45:17,564
start and we don't have a host and everyone starts leaving so that they don't get stuck with the job

753
00:45:17,564 --> 00:45:22,804
and Clifford's on the cell phone with his girlfriend. He's like putting in the time with his

754
00:45:22,804 --> 00:45:27,144
girlfriend to be like no baby I still love you and then he like looks around everyone's gone he's like

755
00:45:27,144 --> 00:45:32,944
well I guess I'm hosting. Yeah. And Clifford's whole kind of premise is that he's just sort of cool.

756
00:45:33,684 --> 00:45:39,664
Like he's sort of like a Ryan Seacrest where it's like this guy's appeal is that he doesn't really

757
00:45:39,664 --> 00:45:46,324
have a personality. That he's just kind of genial and slick. And came out was not an original

758
00:45:46,324 --> 00:45:52,484
character for that came out of the Jim Henson hour. Right. Which is also where Waldo was introduced.

759
00:45:53,104 --> 00:45:59,164
I always thought Waldo was an original character from Muppet Vision 3D. He was not. He was around.

760
00:45:59,504 --> 00:46:05,624
Right. And Bean Bunny comes out of they did a special that was like a bunny themed thing.

761
00:46:06,144 --> 00:46:10,724
It was like an Easter special or something but then they used him and Jim Henson hour as well.

762
00:46:10,964 --> 00:46:15,184
I mean that's the other weird thing about Muppet Vision is it's like it's the last pure Muppet

763
00:46:15,184 --> 00:46:21,524
thing but it also features all these sort of like what Jim Henson was trying to make happen if he

764
00:46:21,524 --> 00:46:26,924
stayed alive another 15 years. Sure. And maybe he could have more thoroughly. You felt like he was

765
00:46:26,924 --> 00:46:35,384
trying to push Bean Bunny up to like top tier. Yeah. Because Bean Bunny is a big like emotional

766
00:46:35,384 --> 00:46:42,604
core of a Muppet Christmas Carol too. Like he is a street urchin. He is the what day is today boy.

767
00:46:42,664 --> 00:46:47,544
Right. And he's got he's the protagonist of Muppet Vision which is like a bold move.

768
00:46:48,304 --> 00:46:53,584
And apparently I found some interview with a behind the scenes person who said the initial

769
00:46:53,584 --> 00:47:00,064
Jim Henson pitch was almost entirely Bean Bunny. He was clearly going all in on Bean Bunny.

770
00:47:00,544 --> 00:47:07,764
Do you sense you don't like Bean maybe? Well you know I always loved Bean. OK. And I feel like I'm

771
00:47:07,764 --> 00:47:15,204
a small person. Yes. I was always the smallest kid in my class. Jason I don't know if you can relate to this.

772
00:47:15,804 --> 00:47:22,364
So I always was into the sort of scrappiness of Bean Bunny. You know more so than Robin where it

773
00:47:22,364 --> 00:47:27,764
felt like the thing was like he's a kid. It was like Bean Bunny is trying to fight to sit at the

774
00:47:27,764 --> 00:47:32,344
adults table. Yeah. And like A they don't view him as an adult and B he can't reach the table.

775
00:47:32,484 --> 00:47:38,964
Like it was both a maturity and a size thing. Bean Bunny too reminds me a lot of we just had the

776
00:47:38,964 --> 00:47:46,504
Trainium Command episode with Buzzy the protagonist of that. And Bean Bunny and Buzzy both just trying

777
00:47:46,504 --> 00:47:53,384
their best. Right. Trying to. Which I always like. I always like the sort of underdog thing. Now I

778
00:47:53,384 --> 00:47:58,424
feel like now reading stuff and even what I was like getting at the time when I was very young

779
00:47:58,424 --> 00:48:02,984
people were like Bean Bunny is like maybe the first tip off sign of what's going to happen when

780
00:48:02,984 --> 00:48:08,484
Disney has the Muppets. Like Bean Bunny feels a little more Disney than Henson even though he was

781
00:48:08,484 --> 00:48:13,124
a Henson character. And it's because the the special account I forget what it's called but it's

782
00:48:13,124 --> 00:48:19,904
called like the bunny picnic or something is like very earnest and it's just like these adorable

783
00:48:19,904 --> 00:48:24,044
bunnies and everyone's like okay this is like you know it's like an Emmett Otter it's its own lane

784
00:48:24,044 --> 00:48:30,204
it's not Muppets canon. Then they transfer Bean Bunny over and the bit with Bean Bunny aside from

785
00:48:30,204 --> 00:48:34,924
the fact that he's like the underdog and trying to be taken seriously is that he's kind of like

786
00:48:35,344 --> 00:48:41,244
annoyingly cute. Yeah. That's a component that doesn't really register with me at the end when

787
00:48:41,244 --> 00:48:48,244
he says what a cute ending. Yeah. Like okay I guess if I was around other Muppets media at the time

788
00:48:48,244 --> 00:48:53,024
where I guess his thing was that he called things cute but that when you watch today many years

789
00:48:53,024 --> 00:48:58,064
later and like I'm a little hazy on why this is happening or what the point of Bean Bunny was.

790
00:48:58,164 --> 00:49:03,684
Well Bean Bunny feels both like a sort of Ewok-y like let's make the cutest character we can that

791
00:49:03,684 --> 00:49:10,564
appeals to small children in the mainline Muppets continuity but also Henson trying to comment on

792
00:49:10,564 --> 00:49:17,564
those types of shoe horned in like Cousin Oliver, Scrappy Doo. Oh and like Cousin Oliver he like

793
00:49:17,564 --> 00:49:22,664
causes problems and get out of here and right right which all of those characters I always loved

794
00:49:22,664 --> 00:49:30,504
like I was excited when a Cousin Oliver episode came on. I didn't get why people shit on Scrappy

795
00:49:30,864 --> 00:49:37,864
characters. I see now why people don't like Bean Bunny and probably were more anti Bean Bunny because

796
00:49:37,864 --> 00:49:44,084
they were like this is starting to look like they're priming him to be the guy. You know?

797
00:49:44,464 --> 00:49:49,724
Huh. People were upset I feel like when Elmo joined Sesame Street. Right. Which I was always an Elmo guy.

798
00:49:49,844 --> 00:49:54,464
Was a phenomenon. Yes. As opposed to Bean which I feel like Bean did sputter. Was Bean in any of

799
00:49:54,464 --> 00:50:00,224
these new Muppet movies? I don't remember. No but I think Bean is more endearing than

800
00:50:00,784 --> 00:50:08,684
Walter. Well Jason of course. That's my opinion. Let's have the Walter conversation. We're gonna get to Walter but I guess we'll do it now.

801
00:50:08,844 --> 00:50:14,844
Is there any yeah is there any fondness for Walter in this room? I like Walter but I also think it's tough

802
00:50:14,844 --> 00:50:22,144
because Walter's appeal is that he's a cipher. Yeah and doesn't know yeah what am I what's the point of me?

803
00:50:22,144 --> 00:50:27,244
Yeah like I think whistling is the point we found out. Right. It was whistling. Right and even I was like

804
00:50:27,264 --> 00:50:31,684
you know I like Walter's arc but like how am I gonna fit him into Muppets most wanted? I was like

805
00:50:31,684 --> 00:50:35,564
I still think he's like an enjoyable presence. I think he's a nice guy. I like his enthusiasm.

806
00:50:35,584 --> 00:50:39,844
I don't think they really did fit him into Muppets most wanted. He's in it and they don't totally have

807
00:50:39,844 --> 00:50:44,044
like a plot function for him and there's a little bit of a weird status thing where you're like well

808
00:50:44,044 --> 00:50:49,524
he's like a fan like even if they let him into the group he's not an equal stature with Fozzy. Like

809
00:50:49,524 --> 00:50:55,604
he's not gonna feel comfortable. When they there's this shot in in Muppet Vision 3D where they're

810
00:50:55,604 --> 00:51:02,304
standing in the black and it's it's Fozzy Kermit and Gonzo and that may as well to me be like

811
00:51:02,304 --> 00:51:07,444
Captain America Iron Man Thor. Like these are the these are the core guys. These are the guys.

812
00:51:08,004 --> 00:51:12,064
Right and that's a thing that keeps not to jump around too much but that that is my

813
00:51:12,064 --> 00:51:19,124
thought revisiting Muppet Vision 3D is how odd it is that yeah through the 70s and 80s it is

814
00:51:19,124 --> 00:51:23,804
it's the main well I don't know it's if it's you'd say three or four I guess four with this biggie.

815
00:51:23,844 --> 00:51:30,104
I would argue it's like the the Disney thing with like here are the big five here like the main five

816
00:51:30,104 --> 00:51:36,284
and Roger Rabbit comes and goes but the primaries stay. The four who are locked are like Kermit,

817
00:51:36,344 --> 00:51:43,864
Fozzy, Gonzo, Piggy and then I feel like usually the fifth default is Animal. Sure. Even though he's

818
00:51:43,864 --> 00:51:52,944
from the band he's technically part of that group he exists more outside of the band than the other

819
00:51:52,984 --> 00:51:58,904
unit and he's a small doses character. But he's a Muppet baby too. Right. Animal over Rolf?

820
00:51:59,444 --> 00:52:04,684
Well so Rolf obviously starts out. Oh okay. Yeah I think Rolf starts out as like clearly because he

821
00:52:04,684 --> 00:52:11,844
was the original Muppet and it was like you know Kermit, Fozzy. I would I would argue it was like

822
00:52:11,844 --> 00:52:18,484
Kermit, Fozzy, Piggy, Rolf, Scooter and then like Gonzo starts to develop into being more of a guy.

823
00:52:18,524 --> 00:52:25,224
Gonzo knocks out Scooter. Scooter comes a little more functional you know than like a big five kind

824
00:52:25,224 --> 00:52:30,284
of guy and then I think Rolf sort of falls by the wayside. I think especially after Hanson dies no

825
00:52:30,284 --> 00:52:36,884
one really knows what to do with Rolf. No. It's similar to the relegated role of Grover in The Rise of

826
00:52:36,884 --> 00:52:41,764
Thelmo. Right. A little bit of it. He's still around. He's not not around but less prominent.

827
00:52:42,124 --> 00:52:48,184
Rolf is a real casualty I feel like. I think so too. Rolf is such a good character and kind of almost like

828
00:52:48,504 --> 00:52:54,764
confidant whereas like Fozzy sort of his confidant later. You get the sense that Rolf's kind of like

829
00:52:54,764 --> 00:52:59,584
the fact that Rolf started out as like Jimmy Dean commercials that was the character he brought on

830
00:52:59,584 --> 00:53:04,184
late night shows. Like once he establishes the whole Muppet family Rolf still feels like the

831
00:53:04,184 --> 00:53:08,704
old timer. Like he feels a guy who's one generation ahead of them. Yeah. Yeah. And he's like investing

832
00:53:08,704 --> 00:53:12,624
less in it while everyone else is freaking out backstage about the show. Rolf just kind of does

833
00:53:12,624 --> 00:53:17,604
his thing because he's been around you win some you lose some and like you know his role in the

834
00:53:17,604 --> 00:53:21,724
Muppet movie as him explained to Kermit like you know relationships they're son of a bitch you know

835
00:53:21,724 --> 00:53:28,784
you're gonna go around the block a couple times. He's the music guy. He's the GE Smith. Right. You know

836
00:53:28,784 --> 00:53:34,124
there's different stress with the cast members but he's just got a guitar to play. Right. My job is

837
00:53:34,124 --> 00:53:39,184
the same week after. Hey I got a gig baby. The show doesn't go on because it's Ray. The show goes on

838
00:53:39,184 --> 00:53:45,744
because it's 11. That's right. You know he's just part of the band and he just goes. I'll always happily accept any reference to that line.

839
00:53:45,744 --> 00:53:50,624
But that's the thing he's so much of a vibe character that I think he's it's so tied to the

840
00:53:50,624 --> 00:53:58,684
Henson performance that when he's gone like no one else playing Rolf pops. I think there's one really

841
00:53:58,684 --> 00:54:04,624
great Rolf gag in the first Siegel bobin movie where he's like why don't you say how including the

842
00:54:04,624 --> 00:54:09,324
montage how you you met up with me and it's him taking a nap in a hammock. Oh that's right. That's

843
00:54:09,324 --> 00:54:14,224
so funny. Rolf Rolf you want to come with us? He's like uh yeah sure. And like I was like that's a good they

844
00:54:14,984 --> 00:54:22,544
identify what Rolf's vibe is. Right. Don't worry. Not that it's that he'll never raise a stink. He's mellow. But I think Grover's a similar thing

845
00:54:22,544 --> 00:54:28,764
where it's like it's so tied to to Frank Oz that when Frank Oz stops doing Sesame Street

846
00:54:28,764 --> 00:54:35,624
fake Grover doesn't click as much. Yeah yeah yeah. Well that I was saying there's a bigger thing where

847
00:54:35,624 --> 00:54:42,824
in this like you said the odd stress of of Bean and of Waldo Seagraphic the spirit of 3D

848
00:54:42,984 --> 00:54:49,044
and then Rizzo who was around a lot in the 80s but is less so now. I think Rizzo was was dancing

849
00:54:49,044 --> 00:54:53,764
around that five spot for a while. I think for a while really especially when he and Gonzo were

850
00:54:53,764 --> 00:55:01,704
like a comedy duo. I love that. Rizzo's in the five. I found Bean Bunny endearing but I very early on

851
00:55:01,704 --> 00:55:06,944
in childhood I was like Gonzo's my guy because he's weird and I'm a little weird but he's funny.

852
00:55:07,744 --> 00:55:15,984
I now as an adult I have no idea what Gonzo's game is. I think it's just that he's weird and he

853
00:55:15,984 --> 00:55:20,584
fucks the chick. Like it wasn't until I was older. That is the joke. I mean that is the joke.

854
00:55:21,044 --> 00:55:27,404
Yeah he's got several games and they're all very complicated. Yeah. But he's a character and I have

855
00:55:27,404 --> 00:55:32,964
to say in this one I forgot like he really he really pulls off that sweater vest. Like he looks

856
00:55:32,964 --> 00:55:38,044
good in that sweater vest shirt combo and that's a hard look to pull off. There's a Mickey toy

857
00:55:38,044 --> 00:55:43,464
behind you that Mike has here. It's like suburban Mickey and it's similar to that. A guy we know a

858
00:55:43,464 --> 00:55:49,224
little more casual or like or just seeing a guy in his work clothes. I kind of like. Yeah he looks

859
00:55:49,224 --> 00:55:54,564
sharp. I have a plush of that also. Oh really? From when I was 18 and went to M. James Dewey

860
00:55:54,564 --> 00:55:58,964
or Hollywood Studios. Yeah with the sweater vest. So I got mixed feelings about sweater vest Gonzo.

861
00:55:59,224 --> 00:56:04,264
Because it's part of phenomenon that was them trying to sort of like gentrify Gonzo a little

862
00:56:04,264 --> 00:56:09,304
bit. You know I think they tried to make him a little more like quirky than like thoroughly

863
00:56:09,304 --> 00:56:13,964
weird. And so that was like part of the like we're gonna put him in like a checkered suit or we're

864
00:56:13,964 --> 00:56:18,564
gonna put him in a sweater vest and now he's kind of just like your wacky uncle. Right. And he

865
00:56:18,564 --> 00:56:23,224
becomes a little more professional because the thing I always liked about classic Gonzo was like

866
00:56:23,224 --> 00:56:27,804
he's on a totally different wavelength than everyone else and everyone's like God be with

867
00:56:27,804 --> 00:56:32,924
you. Go out there fuck that chicken eat that tire. Like whatever it is. And even like his formal

868
00:56:32,924 --> 00:56:39,284
wear when he isn't in his like daredevil sort of performing jumpsuit it's like this really shitty

869
00:56:39,284 --> 00:56:44,984
sad sack crumpled purple suit. You know like he's a guy who like doesn't even know how to function

870
00:56:44,984 --> 00:56:49,824
in polite society. They like domesticated Gonzo. They did. Domesticated is the word. That's true.

871
00:56:49,844 --> 00:56:54,284
That's better than gentrified. I mean yeah I knew what you meant. Yeah. He was like kind of craggier

872
00:56:54,284 --> 00:57:00,304
and more like crumpled up too. Yes. He does it does feel like an like an awkward like

873
00:57:00,304 --> 00:57:04,864
adolescent like prepubescent Gonzo and then he like grew up and got a little handsome.

874
00:57:05,064 --> 00:57:09,744
One of his early games too was that he was very sad. Like early Gonzo on the Muppet Show

875
00:57:09,744 --> 00:57:15,224
is like he's a sad sack. It's the saddest Muppet song that he sings in the Muppet movie. Yes. I'm

876
00:57:15,224 --> 00:57:24,264
going to go back there someday. It's just insanely sad. And Paul Williams is like that's maybe the

877
00:57:24,364 --> 00:57:28,564
version I think of Paul Williams singing it with Gonzo. Yeah it rules. And it's awesome. Yeah.

878
00:57:28,804 --> 00:57:35,084
But he's high status in this. Very. Like all of Gonzo's stuff hits. I mean a thing that I

879
00:57:35,084 --> 00:57:41,804
recognize now but I really liked as a kid there's a lot of funny lines in Muppet Vision 3D and I

880
00:57:41,804 --> 00:57:48,484
think that's a thing that when when Henson died they look like they're so in the pre-show when

881
00:57:48,484 --> 00:57:53,704
Sam Sam Eagle yells like would you stop this foolishness God that says what foolishness would

882
00:57:53,704 --> 00:57:58,884
you like to say? And I just nails that line. That's sort of Borschbelt vaudeville thing. The Muppets

883
00:57:58,884 --> 00:58:05,584
were always very tied to that. They were very like old school entertainers. I feel like slips away a

884
00:58:05,584 --> 00:58:11,884
little bit post Henson death and I think especially like you know they sort of pull out of the Disney

885
00:58:11,884 --> 00:58:17,664
deal but they keep doing Disney adjacent stuff without fully selling and I think everyone was

886
00:58:17,664 --> 00:58:24,004
trying to like domesticate the Muppets in general. Like just play up the sort of like cuddliness and

887
00:58:24,004 --> 00:58:29,944
the sort of like they're they got great spirits over the sort of scene. You know. Whereas they

888
00:58:29,944 --> 00:58:35,844
grow out of like you know they were they were weird and there was that other group that was on

889
00:58:35,844 --> 00:58:41,624
the first season of SNL. Right. And that was super weird like nobody really connects to that but then

890
00:58:41,624 --> 00:58:48,764
the Muppets show is a very strange comedy show. It's not like I love Kermit and you hug him.

891
00:58:49,084 --> 00:58:55,064
They're like it's just immersive hippies that are doing like a traditional show and movie but like

892
00:58:55,064 --> 00:59:00,824
you can feel the like weirdness. You can feel their like counterculture stuff. And they're like broken

893
00:59:00,824 --> 00:59:07,724
outcasts. Like they're all sort of represent different kind of types archetypes and entertainment

894
00:59:07,724 --> 00:59:14,044
and showbiz history and they all don't fully succeed at what they're trying to be. And so

895
00:59:14,044 --> 00:59:19,164
all they got is each other and the stage and like that's it. And then it becomes like you're going

896
00:59:19,164 --> 00:59:24,744
to see them play the roles like you know it's it's they're doing Treasure Island or Muppets Tonight

897
00:59:24,744 --> 00:59:31,304
is like kind of a slicker show. You know. Which I don't like as much. It's a pretty good show within

898
00:59:31,304 --> 00:59:37,204
the world of the show. It's just like cool music video here. Let's all rap with Coolio. Right. And

899
00:59:37,704 --> 00:59:42,264
nothing goes wrong which is what you want out of the Muppets. It's such a difficult thing to do

900
00:59:42,264 --> 00:59:48,524
because Frank Oz has like recently trashed all the new Muppets stuff again. Yeah. And like he's

901
00:59:48,524 --> 00:59:53,504
always like the writers don't understand the heart. And I was like I don't know. They probably don't

902
00:59:53,504 --> 01:00:00,024
understand like what you would do. But like what are you supposed to do also? Like how? He's got a term he uses

903
01:00:00,024 --> 01:00:04,624
that I think is really good. And I don't agree with all of his trashings. I think he's right on about

904
01:00:04,624 --> 01:00:09,964
some things. I think other things he doesn't give enough credit. And you know he when Disney finally bought the

905
01:00:09,964 --> 01:00:16,064
Muppets they went to Frank Oz and said we want to bring you back and get the old school vibe back.

906
01:00:16,064 --> 01:00:20,764
And he was starting to develop a movie that I don't think was like fast track but they were working on it

907
01:00:20,764 --> 01:00:25,584
when Siegel came in for a general meeting and was like I want the Muppets and they pushed Frank Oz out.

908
01:00:25,724 --> 01:00:34,004
Whoa. He was going to do the last like unmade Henson movie idea which was the cheapest Muppet movie ever.

909
01:00:34,004 --> 01:00:41,644
Right right. And the premise is that they let Gonzo take control of a movie. Oh my god. And the first 10 minutes are the most expensive

910
01:00:41,644 --> 01:00:47,384
movie ever made and the movie stops and they tell Gonzo they've run out of funding. And it's the

911
01:00:47,384 --> 01:00:53,944
Muppets having to improvise a movie for the rest of the runtime. That's so neat. And they like recycle sets.

912
01:00:55,124 --> 01:00:59,504
Like characters playing multiple parts. Like trying to just get to the end of the script.

913
01:00:59,644 --> 01:01:03,984
God that's it. That's the kind of movie that if it came out when I was nine.

914
01:01:03,984 --> 01:01:07,024
Would have blown your mind. Yeah I would be talking about it every day.

915
01:01:07,204 --> 01:01:12,724
Right. Wow. Wow. Yeah it's great because like they tried with that Muppets show and it's like

916
01:01:12,724 --> 01:01:16,624
basically like the office. That show's a nightmare. Okay. Few things make me angry.

917
01:01:16,704 --> 01:01:23,364
We've got to talk about that because I never realized this. Muppet Vision is written by Bill Prady.

918
01:01:23,864 --> 01:01:31,024
Who would go on to be the co-creator of that like bad Muppet show and Big Bang Theory.

919
01:01:31,324 --> 01:01:35,784
Right. That's the thing. So when they announced that he was doing the ABC Muppet show everyone's

920
01:01:35,784 --> 01:01:39,604
like oh they got some Big Bang Theory guy. And he came out and started like pounding his chest and

921
01:01:39,604 --> 01:01:46,604
he was like I got the bonafides. I worked with Jim. I was a big Muppet guy. Like trust me I get it.

922
01:01:46,604 --> 01:01:51,884
And then you watch that show and I don't know whether it was his intentions got modeled. If

923
01:01:51,884 --> 01:01:56,704
a network came in with things. If he was trying to update it in the way he thought. But it was so

924
01:01:56,704 --> 01:02:02,944
maddening because they had just done two movies that fully reintroduced the iconography and the

925
01:02:02,944 --> 01:02:08,484
format of the Muppet show. Yes. And it was like it's on a plate for you. Just they got the theater

926
01:02:08,484 --> 01:02:13,684
back. It's in the narrative. Dual weekly show. That's a variety show and it's the exact same

927
01:02:13,684 --> 01:02:18,524
thing with the exact same theater. Instead it's Kermit is corny for a different pig.

928
01:02:19,004 --> 01:02:25,624
Like that was a story like. It's Baz Larry Sanders is what it is. Yeah. And the joke is that they're

929
01:02:25,624 --> 01:02:31,864
all kind of depressed in the office and Fozzie is like the mono joke writer. Yeah. Or he's the

930
01:02:31,864 --> 01:02:38,404
sidekick. Gonzo is writing mono jokes. And Kermit's just sort of like the ripped torn character and

931
01:02:38,404 --> 01:02:43,404
he's broken up with Piggy. And you're like this show is just like their hearts not in it anymore.

932
01:02:43,404 --> 01:02:49,224
It's a show about the Muppets not enjoying putting on a show. And there's a lot of like

933
01:02:49,224 --> 01:02:55,964
too sad. Like the stuff in the Muppet movie is sad but it's sort of like deep heart sadness that

934
01:02:55,964 --> 01:03:00,824
we all experience. Whereas like the sadness in the Seagull Muppet movie. Yeah. And then this show

935
01:03:00,824 --> 01:03:08,264
is all just like depressed and just vague depression sadness for like it's not enjoyable

936
01:03:08,264 --> 01:03:13,384
and it doesn't like say anything and it doesn't speak to you. It just makes you. They maybe try

937
01:03:13,384 --> 01:03:19,384
a little too hard to hit the like the Pixar right in the feels buttons. Yeah. But I do think the

938
01:03:19,384 --> 01:03:23,784
area in which they're exploring the sadness is the same sort of like existential loneliness of

939
01:03:23,784 --> 01:03:27,484
these Muppets and the idea of like they got nowhere else to go if they don't got a show.

940
01:03:27,684 --> 01:03:34,044
Whereas like the ABC show is just like now they've sort of just become cynical and jaded.

941
01:03:34,044 --> 01:03:39,804
They're in showbiz and they're just sort of forced harder than they are. I remember watching the

942
01:03:39,804 --> 01:03:46,104
episode and there's a scene where it's like mockumentary Fozzie turning to the camera and

943
01:03:46,104 --> 01:03:53,264
complaining about the traffic in L.A. And I was like no one wants to see this. This is for nobody.

944
01:03:53,424 --> 01:04:02,484
This is for podcasters. Yeah. Weird. You know I can I talk a little bit about about Steve Whitmire

945
01:04:02,484 --> 01:04:09,004
because I uncovered a big treasure trove of stuff with him or not. Not a treasure trove. It's a

946
01:04:09,084 --> 01:04:15,044
trove of mud. It's very upsetting and sad. Can you fill into like what he did what his Muppet.

947
01:04:15,044 --> 01:04:21,324
Yes. So Steve Whitmire is really an all star of Muppet Vision 3D because there's such big

948
01:04:21,324 --> 01:04:26,304
performances such major performances from Rizzo especially in the pre-show. Bean Bunny is really

949
01:04:26,304 --> 01:04:31,184
the heart of it as we said and he's the 3D character while the sea graphic. A really good

950
01:04:31,184 --> 01:04:38,984
in Muppet Vision 3D. Jim Henson dies after making Muppet Vision 3D. He takes over his Kermit. He's

951
01:04:38,984 --> 01:04:45,024
a couple years ago. I didn't know it changed but he got fired a few years ago and it is just a

952
01:04:45,024 --> 01:04:50,924
terrible situation between him and the Hensons and they see some of what you're talking about

953
01:04:50,924 --> 01:04:57,064
about how that show is so weird and depressive. They seem to put some of that on him. First of

954
01:04:57,064 --> 01:05:02,684
all they say Steve Whitmire. That he pushed Kermit to more of a sad sack vibe. Yes. Yeah. The quote

955
01:05:02,684 --> 01:05:08,164
Hui is Steve's performance of Kermit has strayed far away from my father is one of the H 난sons

956
01:05:08,424 --> 01:05:14,004
from my father's good hearted compassionate leader of the Muppets. Steve performed Kermit as a bitter

957
01:05:14,004 --> 01:05:19,684
angry depressed victim. Worst of all in the last few years he had not been funny or fun.

958
01:05:20,084 --> 01:05:26,364
Recasting Kermit is long overdue. Really harsh but then he keeps going and he's talking about

959
01:05:26,364 --> 01:05:38,144
what his dad did and how what he had there was a wry intelligence and a little bit of a

960
01:05:39,184 --> 01:05:44,884
character element. I don't think so but then also it seems like Whitmire did not like the ABC show

961
01:05:44,884 --> 01:05:49,724
as we do not like it and he was in there going Kermit wouldn't do this. I've been playing Kermit

962
01:05:49,724 --> 01:05:54,984
like he was there's something where he lied to Robin about who he was seeing or something

963
01:05:54,984 --> 01:06:00,404
and that this fight was apparently enough to be the catalyst for getting Whitmire out of there

964
01:06:00,404 --> 01:06:05,444
altogether. Well that's one of Frank's whole big things is that they don't listen to the performers.

965
01:06:05,444 --> 01:06:09,924
That was one of his big complaints is that the performers know better than a lot of the writers

966
01:06:09,924 --> 01:06:13,304
and they don't listen to them. That's what he says. But it's also tough because you have like the

967
01:06:13,304 --> 01:06:18,664
performers are still inheriting other people's characters and those characters become so rich

968
01:06:18,664 --> 01:06:23,824
because it's like they're doing them over years in different projects and they built up the sense of

969
01:06:23,824 --> 01:06:27,404
it. Now I think most of those performers have really like grown up with these things studied

970
01:06:27,404 --> 01:06:32,844
these things lived these things. I like most of Whitmire's Kermit stuff. I will say not setting

971
01:06:32,844 --> 01:06:37,584
my sources here but I've heard from from close people in proximity to this situation.

972
01:06:38,404 --> 01:06:44,964
Whitmire's wife was his manager and apparently at some point post Disney still started saying like

973
01:06:44,964 --> 01:06:51,384
you're the Mickey Mouse. Like anything you ask for they have to give you and so anytime there was

974
01:06:51,384 --> 01:06:59,904
any Kermit thing he would demand two first class seats. One for him and one for the puppet. Then

975
01:06:59,904 --> 01:07:05,504
he would go to the airport downgrade to business and pocket the cash.

976
01:07:06,164 --> 01:07:10,764
No! That's a great hack though by the way. That is really good. That's like you hear about the

977
01:07:10,764 --> 01:07:16,724
the band Sue asked for like really nice red wine or something and then Axl Rose has like a full

978
01:07:16,724 --> 01:07:22,324
wine cellar. So they would give him a seat for the puppet? Correct. This is a Costanza move.

979
01:07:23,164 --> 01:07:29,324
His wife was kind of like a Lady Macbeth figure and that she was like you cannot ask for enough.

980
01:07:29,904 --> 01:07:35,784
And then eventually they said. This ties into another quote that I found. So then I like

981
01:07:35,784 --> 01:07:41,684
now the site is offline but there was kind of like a sub blog spot like you know Whitmire's

982
01:07:41,684 --> 01:07:47,984
truth report essentially and he says some stuff that does sound I don't know like this is

983
01:07:47,984 --> 01:07:52,244
interesting hearing all this because you see reading both sides of it I felt more on Whitmire's side

984
01:07:52,244 --> 01:07:57,344
especially with stuff like this. Creatively I'm pretty down with Whitmire's side of the story.

985
01:07:57,344 --> 01:08:02,044
And then when I start hearing about the the business demands of things. Yeah yeah yeah which

986
01:08:02,044 --> 01:08:06,904
is what they said they accused him of unacceptable business conduct. What you just said does seem to

987
01:08:06,904 --> 01:08:12,104
line up with that. But so here's what he said about Jim which is so there was apparently I mean it

988
01:08:12,104 --> 01:08:18,224
seems like to get Muppet Vision 3D going with Disney and the deal in general that it was like

989
01:08:18,224 --> 01:08:24,284
a very strenuous difficult deal that was weighing on Jim and the family and not really fully sewn

990
01:08:24,284 --> 01:08:30,364
up by the time they started filming the thing. A lot of people kind of theorized that the deal

991
01:08:30,364 --> 01:08:37,144
killed him. Yeah yeah. That's why I read that. Oh god. The obvious thing is you know Jim Hansen was

992
01:08:37,144 --> 01:08:41,724
a Christian scientist when he got sick he refused to see anybody by the time he saw a doctor it was

993
01:08:41,724 --> 01:08:46,644
too late like he kind of made his own grave in that sense but people say that the year or two

994
01:08:46,644 --> 01:08:50,664
that he was doing all the Disney negotiations that he was thinking about selling that he was

995
01:08:50,664 --> 01:08:55,704
working on Muppet Vision all of that he like physically changed that he got so worn down

996
01:08:55,704 --> 01:09:01,064
by the thing and I think he kind of psychosomatically started dying. Well and think about what he was

997
01:09:01,064 --> 01:09:06,944
doing before that all these oddball like labyrinth Jim Henson storyteller the Jim Henson hour like

998
01:09:06,944 --> 01:09:18,984
all these weird experimental. He's following his own muse. Exactly. And he owned the thing you know I mean it was kind of incredible that it was like he was able to carry these properties this this

999
01:09:18,984 --> 01:09:28,704
group of characters over different mediums and different bosses but he always had control. He pointedly Muppet St. Manhattan was supposed to be the last thing he ever did with the Muppets.

1000
01:09:28,784 --> 01:09:33,344
Really? He was like I've said what I need to say that's why it ends with them getting married.

1001
01:09:33,664 --> 01:09:41,284
Oh. And that's when he starts doing like labyrinth dark crystals start building up the workshop I want to do stuff for other movies you know.

1002
01:09:41,744 --> 01:09:52,644
Ninja Turtles. Right yes so then like Jim Henson hour is him kind of conceding and being like I guess I gotta give him a little bit of Kermit to do what I want.

1003
01:09:52,704 --> 01:09:57,304
Oh. We'll do a storyteller segment but it's also going to be hosted by Kermit and Fozzie and Gonzo.

1004
01:09:57,424 --> 01:10:07,284
That's what I was not really familiar with the Jim Henson hour too much and I was reminding myself because Waldo's in it and stuff and he is pretty clear about like so half of the show will be in Kermit world.

1005
01:10:07,304 --> 01:10:09,804
Correct. And the other half will be this totally original thing.

1006
01:10:09,804 --> 01:10:10,964
So he's still trying to ride that line.

1007
01:10:12,324 --> 01:10:16,684
It's a platform it's a space for me to experiment with whatever I want.

1008
01:10:16,784 --> 01:10:17,084
Gotcha.

1009
01:10:17,164 --> 01:10:22,804
And even the Muppet half of it's very like cold like it's like them running like a UHF station.

1010
01:10:23,344 --> 01:10:29,484
In this one limited digital environment that's not nearly as expansive or creative as the storyteller world.

1011
01:10:29,504 --> 01:10:32,864
And the band is called Cold Foam is that right?

1012
01:10:32,884 --> 01:10:33,544
I think that's correct.

1013
01:10:33,544 --> 01:10:38,104
It's got a different it's not the electric man it's got Clifford in it and it's got.

1014
01:10:38,104 --> 01:10:39,164
That's where he came from.

1015
01:10:40,044 --> 01:10:41,464
As a band member.

1016
01:10:41,564 --> 01:10:41,864
Yeah.

1017
01:10:41,864 --> 01:10:47,984
Oh so I think he's sort of in this zone where he's like I guess the people want Muppets like I can't be selfish.

1018
01:10:48,064 --> 01:10:49,224
I got to keep them going.

1019
01:10:49,644 --> 01:10:50,644
Let's sell them to Disney.

1020
01:10:50,704 --> 01:10:52,044
They know how to maintain characters.

1021
01:10:52,124 --> 01:10:53,944
I'll remain involved creatively.

1022
01:10:54,124 --> 01:10:57,104
This is like Jay and Silent Bob strike back.

1023
01:10:57,104 --> 01:10:57,704
It is.

1024
01:10:57,704 --> 01:11:02,484
It's very much like he thought he had walked away but the public is like please we love them.

1025
01:11:02,764 --> 01:11:04,484
The viewers universe is not closed.

1026
01:11:05,404 --> 01:11:07,124
It's closed when we say it's closed.

1027
01:11:08,064 --> 01:11:14,244
But anyway like they're from from this blog spot or whatever I was like from Whitmire.

1028
01:11:14,244 --> 01:11:22,244
He says that like he and another one of the primary Muppet performers were having a lot of difficulty closing their contracts.

1029
01:11:22,364 --> 01:11:24,144
And Jim was very much on their side.

1030
01:11:24,344 --> 01:11:24,884
For Muppet Vision.

1031
01:11:24,984 --> 01:11:25,504
For Muppet Vision.

1032
01:11:26,584 --> 01:11:29,484
And he was really talking.

1033
01:11:29,964 --> 01:11:33,084
Jim is defending them and saying you know like these are my guys.

1034
01:11:33,164 --> 01:11:34,264
I picked them for a reason.

1035
01:11:34,604 --> 01:11:37,444
And Disney said that's not somebody to his face.

1036
01:11:37,664 --> 01:11:38,984
Whitmire says he saw this.

1037
01:11:39,224 --> 01:11:41,184
Somebody says that's not how we do business.

1038
01:11:41,464 --> 01:11:45,224
If Mickey 1 won't do it for what we offer then we move on to Mickey 2.

1039
01:11:45,364 --> 01:11:48,564
And we keep going down the line until somebody will do it for our price.

1040
01:11:49,664 --> 01:11:52,204
So day one of shooting Muppet Vision.

1041
01:11:53,424 --> 01:11:54,784
It's Whitmire and one of the other guys.

1042
01:11:55,004 --> 01:11:56,064
Deals have not closed.

1043
01:11:56,484 --> 01:11:57,524
Several lawyers.

1044
01:11:57,644 --> 01:11:59,364
Three studio attorneys.

1045
01:11:59,704 --> 01:12:04,744
March onto the soundstage interrupt production and demand that those two sign their contracts immediately.

1046
01:12:04,964 --> 01:12:09,184
And then Whitmire goes on to compare this to how the Henson family is treating him now.

1047
01:12:09,224 --> 01:12:11,204
He says did they tell me my business.

1048
01:12:11,344 --> 01:12:14,344
Did Jim say your business conduct is unacceptable.

1049
01:12:14,684 --> 01:12:16,804
Did he accuse him of brinksmanship.

1050
01:12:16,804 --> 01:12:17,784
Wow.

1051
01:12:18,064 --> 01:12:19,564
A word that the Henson's used on him.

1052
01:12:19,664 --> 01:12:29,864
No Jim said with everybody in view looked at the attorneys square in the eye and slowly quietly said get off my set and never come back.

1053
01:12:29,864 --> 01:12:32,124
Then he turned back to Steve.

1054
01:12:32,724 --> 01:12:36,324
And Steve said I'm really sorry to have caused a problem especially on this big day for you.

1055
01:12:36,384 --> 01:12:37,264
The first day of Disney.

1056
01:12:37,584 --> 01:12:41,424
And he said Jim said I would never want you to sign a deal that you're not comfortable with.

1057
01:12:41,424 --> 01:12:42,104
And then he died.

1058
01:12:42,504 --> 01:12:43,304
And then he died.

1059
01:12:44,064 --> 01:12:49,084
It does feel like that was like he was living in this sort of business world.

1060
01:12:49,404 --> 01:12:53,884
You know a very structured sort of franchise driven business world that he had avoided.

1061
01:12:54,764 --> 01:12:57,264
Muppet Show famously no network would pick it up.

1062
01:12:57,264 --> 01:13:03,304
And he went to like Lord Lou Grade who put up all the money and it was sold in syndication.

1063
01:13:03,484 --> 01:13:06,404
Has anyone ever seen footage of Lord Lou Grade.

1064
01:13:06,464 --> 01:13:07,404
He looks incredible.

1065
01:13:07,644 --> 01:13:11,064
Oh my god yeah he's like a crazy like prosthetic character.

1066
01:13:11,344 --> 01:13:15,084
He's like if you like hey can you do like a Orson Welles impression.

1067
01:13:15,424 --> 01:13:15,924
Well because Orson Welles.

1068
01:13:15,924 --> 01:13:17,624
What took it too far.

1069
01:13:17,704 --> 01:13:21,424
Orson Welles in the Muppet movie I believe his character's name is Lou Lord.

1070
01:13:21,584 --> 01:13:24,124
And he's the studio exec who gives them.

1071
01:13:24,124 --> 01:13:24,904
Oh my god.

1072
01:13:25,064 --> 01:13:26,704
The rich and famous contract.

1073
01:13:27,484 --> 01:13:30,084
That's and that's why it's a similar character.

1074
01:13:30,084 --> 01:13:32,624
Right because he's like this is the Orson Welles of my life.

1075
01:13:32,624 --> 01:13:34,644
Like this man has that sort of weight.

1076
01:13:34,884 --> 01:13:39,964
And he's just very British.

1077
01:13:40,124 --> 01:13:41,964
Really he's like Hitchcock is what he is.

1078
01:13:43,524 --> 01:13:47,924
But he yeah I think you know Henson had always found these very

1079
01:13:47,924 --> 01:13:51,464
generous sort of benefactors who believed in him.

1080
01:13:51,644 --> 01:13:55,144
And then from that point on he could sort of write his own checks

1081
01:13:55,344 --> 01:13:57,744
or just go to a place and go here are the terms.

1082
01:13:57,984 --> 01:13:59,124
You know I want to do a movie.

1083
01:13:59,224 --> 01:14:01,584
You just give me the money and you get a Muppet movie.

1084
01:14:01,704 --> 01:14:08,844
And I think having to deal with to use the lingo like a place like Disney where they

1085
01:14:08,844 --> 01:14:11,304
he views the Muppets as face characters.

1086
01:14:11,824 --> 01:14:13,944
They are very tied to these performers.

1087
01:14:14,164 --> 01:14:14,904
Right yeah.

1088
01:14:14,904 --> 01:14:17,004
And to them they're like doesn't matter who's doing the hand.

1089
01:14:17,064 --> 01:14:18,164
Doesn't matter who's doing the voice.

1090
01:14:18,244 --> 01:14:19,444
Can't we dub it in later.

1091
01:14:19,564 --> 01:14:20,784
You know that sort of thing.

1092
01:14:20,784 --> 01:14:25,464
I said it before it is like what George Lucas is going through right now.

1093
01:14:25,504 --> 01:14:29,304
George Lucas going nuts because he thought he was selling to Disney.

1094
01:14:29,584 --> 01:14:32,464
And they're going to kind of do his ideas and he'll be around and help out a little bit.

1095
01:14:32,584 --> 01:14:34,824
And it's like they were like get the fuck out of here George.

1096
01:14:34,924 --> 01:14:36,764
We don't give a shit about what you think.

1097
01:14:37,084 --> 01:14:40,604
And he's like obviously cranky about it and he's had to be scolded by them.

1098
01:14:40,604 --> 01:14:45,504
You kind of have to imagine I mean if he had closed the Disney deal they would have done

1099
01:14:45,504 --> 01:14:48,584
a similar thing to Henson and it probably would have been tragic.

1100
01:14:48,904 --> 01:14:49,204
You know.

1101
01:14:49,204 --> 01:14:54,044
Yeah he would have had the same he would have what did Lucas called Disney white slave.

1102
01:14:54,044 --> 01:14:54,644
He called them white slaves.

1103
01:14:54,764 --> 01:14:55,424
Charlie Rose.

1104
01:14:55,924 --> 01:14:58,004
Which is inappropriate of course.

1105
01:14:58,324 --> 01:14:59,944
Yes and Charlie Rose laughed.

1106
01:15:00,744 --> 01:15:01,804
That's what happened.

1107
01:15:02,104 --> 01:15:02,464
Oh my god.

1108
01:15:02,504 --> 01:15:02,864
So clever.

1109
01:15:03,684 --> 01:15:09,584
Is anyone else like oddly sad upset forlorn.

1110
01:15:09,904 --> 01:15:13,924
Ever since you dropped the news that you think it's the deal that killed him.

1111
01:15:13,924 --> 01:15:14,144
Yeah.

1112
01:15:14,144 --> 01:15:17,144
I feel like this is like the most like vulnerable I've felt on the show.

1113
01:15:17,324 --> 01:15:18,304
This is so upsetting.

1114
01:15:18,684 --> 01:15:21,284
Realizing that is what's happening with Lucas.

1115
01:15:21,624 --> 01:15:22,184
Forlorn?

1116
01:15:22,284 --> 01:15:22,944
Forlorn.

1117
01:15:23,184 --> 01:15:27,804
Yeah the great man.

1118
01:15:28,204 --> 01:15:31,364
Let's make sure this is good forlorn in case Lauren listens to this podcast.

1119
01:15:31,364 --> 01:15:33,604
I say my prayers at night before bedtime.

1120
01:15:34,384 --> 01:15:37,444
I it's like please let us please just give Lauren strength.

1121
01:15:37,964 --> 01:15:42,524
Well and when I go up to the plate with my bat ready to hit a homer I point to the

1122
01:15:42,524 --> 01:15:44,304
the bleachers and I say this is forlorn.

1123
01:15:45,124 --> 01:15:47,164
You know whatever 30 rock is.

1124
01:15:50,264 --> 01:15:50,164
It's forlorn.

1125
01:15:51,464 --> 01:15:55,204
Yeah no I've heard that before so my sadness about it is already.

1126
01:15:55,204 --> 01:15:59,744
No it's really striking me and just realizing and not only not just to say it's like

1127
01:15:59,744 --> 01:16:04,044
it's the Star Wars syndrome but this is the syndrome in a lot of things and it's the sad

1128
01:16:04,044 --> 01:16:11,224
side of IP and things and everybody going no Harrison Ford is not what's important about

1129
01:16:11,224 --> 01:16:12,204
Indiana Jones.

1130
01:16:12,204 --> 01:16:12,524
Right.

1131
01:16:12,804 --> 01:16:14,944
And I'm like no I don't think that's right.

1132
01:16:15,144 --> 01:16:16,024
I disagree.

1133
01:16:16,644 --> 01:16:22,544
And it's like no you're just a nerd complainer malcontent but I don't think I am.

1134
01:16:22,684 --> 01:16:24,924
I think I just like the stuff I like the way it is.

1135
01:16:25,224 --> 01:16:29,444
Yeah it all depends though because this is so tough because there's versions of characters

1136
01:16:29,444 --> 01:16:33,344
that like new versions like Adam's family movies new versions of those characters

1137
01:16:33,344 --> 01:16:34,244
totally different actors.

1138
01:16:34,724 --> 01:16:36,024
Pretty good movies.

1139
01:16:36,124 --> 01:16:36,344
True.

1140
01:16:36,744 --> 01:16:40,464
And that people like and there's other like the new whether some people like Star Trek

1141
01:16:40,464 --> 01:16:41,104
JJ whatever.

1142
01:16:41,524 --> 01:16:45,484
But you also go I mean there's the weird thing of like with the Adam's family it was

1143
01:16:45,484 --> 01:16:50,944
a comic first like it was the strip so everyone is just doing their take on the drawings.

1144
01:16:51,364 --> 01:16:56,784
It's like the Muppets though especially because they're they I take on it they look exactly

1145
01:16:56,784 --> 01:16:57,704
the same.

1146
01:16:57,824 --> 01:16:58,124
Yes.

1147
01:16:58,124 --> 01:17:03,784
So it's like if any like as if Leonard Neamey it looked like Leonard Neamey but the voice

1148
01:17:03,784 --> 01:17:05,584
was different and he acted a little different.

1149
01:17:05,744 --> 01:17:11,144
It's like hard to do that like you can't reinvent that as easy.

1150
01:17:11,284 --> 01:17:15,364
I also think the other thing with the Muppets is it's like when you see people playing the

1151
01:17:15,904 --> 01:17:18,884
Stooges you know or like the Marx brothers or something.

1152
01:17:18,884 --> 01:17:22,444
It's like yes these were characters you can dress people up like them they can do the

1153
01:17:22,444 --> 01:17:28,124
voices they weren't playing themselves but also it's like a thing that was developed

1154
01:17:28,124 --> 01:17:32,724
in multiple mediums for years and years and years where it was just in the bones for these

1155
01:17:32,724 --> 01:17:33,164
guys.

1156
01:17:33,284 --> 01:17:33,524
Sure.

1157
01:17:33,524 --> 01:17:39,184
And you go like Kermit was on like local TV before he became like a commercial star to

1158
01:17:39,744 --> 01:17:42,864
being like a guest on like Ed Sullivan.

1159
01:17:43,204 --> 01:17:43,384
Yeah.

1160
01:17:43,384 --> 01:17:48,284
There was so much evolution with like Henson working that out and the way that all these

1161
01:17:48,284 --> 01:17:51,564
guys did like the vaudeville circuit before they got movies.

1162
01:17:51,624 --> 01:17:56,584
Or even just Letterman and Carson's career trajectory where they're like going on to

1163
01:17:56,584 --> 01:17:58,324
bigger and bigger hosting gigs.

1164
01:17:58,384 --> 01:18:03,684
Yeah right but it's like you spend a lifetime just honing this sort of thing what the energy

1165
01:18:03,684 --> 01:18:05,664
is and what the rhythm is and all of that.

1166
01:18:05,724 --> 01:18:05,924
Yeah.

1167
01:18:05,924 --> 01:18:11,524
It is like somebody like taking over Johnny Carson's skin versus taking over Mr. Spock.

1168
01:18:11,544 --> 01:18:13,684
It's like if Leno did Carson.

1169
01:18:13,824 --> 01:18:14,384
Yeah.

1170
01:18:14,404 --> 01:18:17,944
Like if he took up The Tonight Show and was like and of course I will wear the Carson

1171
01:18:17,944 --> 01:18:18,284
wig.

1172
01:18:18,584 --> 01:18:19,404
Right.

1173
01:18:19,464 --> 01:18:21,644
And say weird and wild stuff.

1174
01:18:22,464 --> 01:18:26,944
Yeah it's different but they're both fictional characters but it's different.

1175
01:18:27,144 --> 01:18:27,764
Right yeah.

1176
01:18:28,004 --> 01:18:32,724
Spock is an easier just put the ears on somebody and he can do his own take on it.

1177
01:18:32,744 --> 01:18:33,084
Yeah.

1178
01:18:33,084 --> 01:18:37,464
For whatever reason Kermit is so developed as a human as a character as a person.

1179
01:18:37,604 --> 01:18:42,644
And also the fact that it is like it's like if George Lucas also played Luke Skywalker.

1180
01:18:43,104 --> 01:18:43,824
Yeah right right.

1181
01:18:43,904 --> 01:18:45,404
That's an extra thing too.

1182
01:18:45,424 --> 01:18:49,104
I know that Walt voiced Mickey Mouse but I never felt like he was very territorial about

1183
01:18:49,104 --> 01:18:49,224
that.

1184
01:18:49,304 --> 01:18:51,624
He probably did it because he didn't want to pay another person $10.

1185
01:18:51,824 --> 01:18:52,564
Yeah you're right.

1186
01:18:52,624 --> 01:18:55,304
And he very quickly let other people voice Mickey Mouse.

1187
01:18:56,144 --> 01:19:03,644
And I think Kermit really became Henson and I think it's just like you lose the voice

1188
01:19:03,644 --> 01:19:08,504
and the guy who's writing everything and the heart of the thing and the technician like.

1189
01:19:08,504 --> 01:19:09,004
Yo yeah.

1190
01:19:09,004 --> 01:19:14,724
You can't do okay I don't mean to be like there can't be a new and like I said I've

1191
01:19:14,724 --> 01:19:15,404
liked Steve Whitmire.

1192
01:19:15,404 --> 01:19:16,744
I like a lot of Whitmire stuff.

1193
01:19:17,024 --> 01:19:23,044
Yeah there's been good Mumpet stuff in the last couple decades but you can't say no not

1194
01:19:23,044 --> 01:19:28,584
the cast and we don't want their ideas and we don't and Frank Oz get out of here and

1195
01:19:28,584 --> 01:19:33,504
even a new person who has the recognizes what the spirit of the old ones was.

1196
01:19:33,704 --> 01:19:35,044
No we don't want that either.

1197
01:19:35,264 --> 01:19:37,804
And like you can't say no to all of it.

1198
01:19:38,284 --> 01:19:43,224
And I think it's I'm starting to realize like why is the why have the Muppets been so messy

1199
01:19:43,224 --> 01:19:47,144
ever since Muppet Vision 3D and it's it's everything we're everything we're talking

1200
01:19:47,144 --> 01:19:47,284
about.

1201
01:19:47,284 --> 01:19:51,384
I don't know what is the source but clearly Disney is a problem.

1202
01:19:51,664 --> 01:19:57,164
Ironic because Disney because Muppet Vision 3D which we have alluded as alluded as mostly

1203
01:19:57,164 --> 01:19:59,584
so far is really good.

1204
01:19:59,584 --> 01:20:00,284
It's so good.

1205
01:20:00,284 --> 01:20:00,704
It's very good.

1206
01:20:01,244 --> 01:20:07,324
And I think there there's a moment in this that I think like epitomizes what I like about

1207
01:20:07,324 --> 01:20:09,924
the Muppets and it's that moment when they're standing in all black.

1208
01:20:10,864 --> 01:20:15,944
Also side note the band and Jim Henson our was called Solid Foam not Cold Foam Solid

1209
01:20:15,944 --> 01:20:19,684
Foam which I think is a joke but yeah we'll come back to that.

1210
01:20:20,284 --> 01:20:21,204
It's a conundrum.

1211
01:20:21,544 --> 01:20:27,384
So it's it's Fozzie and Kermit and Gonzo standing in the black and Kermit yells hey Sam

1212
01:20:27,384 --> 01:20:32,604
and Sam Eagle like sticks his head or he opens a door in the black.

1213
01:20:32,604 --> 01:20:34,104
This is the black void door.

1214
01:20:34,224 --> 01:20:38,444
A black void door and he said he asked him like is the finale ready and he goes like

1215
01:20:38,444 --> 01:20:42,224
yes it's a glorious three hour finale and Kermit goes you got a minute and a half and

1216
01:20:42,224 --> 01:20:44,704
Sam like goes and like slams the door.

1217
01:20:44,744 --> 01:20:46,384
His gasp is so funny.

1218
01:20:46,764 --> 01:20:48,564
His gasp is so funny the minute and a half is so funny.

1219
01:20:48,564 --> 01:20:55,504
The other thing is and I watched this a few times this one sequence like I think the

1220
01:20:55,504 --> 01:20:58,604
puppeteer didn't quite get the door open with Sam.

1221
01:20:58,624 --> 01:21:04,044
I think he gets it open halfway and then gets it all the way but they use that take.

1222
01:21:04,344 --> 01:21:04,424
Yeah.

1223
01:21:04,544 --> 01:21:05,064
Oh interesting.

1224
01:21:05,264 --> 01:21:05,364
I don't know.

1225
01:21:05,364 --> 01:21:06,124
So it's a little messy.

1226
01:21:06,404 --> 01:21:09,124
Yeah so it looks a little messy and it could have been a conscious choice.

1227
01:21:09,284 --> 01:21:13,284
It could have just been like well no one's going to notice that in the long run.

1228
01:21:13,564 --> 01:21:17,144
I think here's all those guys where it was like about the feeling above all else.

1229
01:21:17,324 --> 01:21:17,504
Yeah.

1230
01:21:17,504 --> 01:21:21,144
Performance is good you want to keep that like as much as he tried to advance stuff

1231
01:21:21,144 --> 01:21:24,084
technically that wasn't the end game.

1232
01:21:24,084 --> 01:21:26,624
Like he never went up his own Lucas butt you know.

1233
01:21:26,744 --> 01:21:27,124
Yeah right.

1234
01:21:27,324 --> 01:21:32,944
Yeah but you talk about the messiness post-Hensen and it is a thing where like they never had

1235
01:21:32,944 --> 01:21:37,244
someone who was so clearly steering the ship after he died.

1236
01:21:37,524 --> 01:21:38,884
Like there's no Kevin Feige.

1237
01:21:39,004 --> 01:21:40,664
There's no Kathleen Kennedy.

1238
01:21:41,024 --> 01:21:45,144
Like Brian Henson's sword takes over his default but it wasn't like he was the head writer.

1239
01:21:45,384 --> 01:21:45,844
Yeah.

1240
01:21:46,104 --> 01:21:50,184
I want to keep up my dad's legacy then they sell this weird German company

1241
01:21:50,184 --> 01:21:53,564
and then even at Disney it's not like there's someone protecting the Muppet brand.

1242
01:21:53,704 --> 01:21:56,144
They sort of go like anyone got anything they want to do with the Muppets?

1243
01:21:56,644 --> 01:21:58,104
And they handed over to whoever.

1244
01:21:58,464 --> 01:22:00,384
That's the case to like any idiot in a meeting.

1245
01:22:01,204 --> 01:22:03,504
Like that you could just like and we do have the Muppets remember.

1246
01:22:04,524 --> 01:22:05,684
Like weird why?

1247
01:22:05,864 --> 01:22:09,664
Why is it so just like whatever no one has any ideas.

1248
01:22:09,824 --> 01:22:15,824
Well all of the franchises are running into this of like well who's like Kevin Feige is

1249
01:22:15,824 --> 01:22:16,904
a one in a million.

1250
01:22:17,184 --> 01:22:20,544
He's like kind of got a clear thing but like the DC.

1251
01:22:21,004 --> 01:22:24,124
Like there literally hasn't been a guy like him in a hundred years.

1252
01:22:24,384 --> 01:22:27,724
But like Star Wars seems a little on rocky ground right now.

1253
01:22:27,804 --> 01:22:31,124
Certainly the universal dark universe like was dead.

1254
01:22:31,124 --> 01:22:31,664
Well it's over.

1255
01:22:31,984 --> 01:22:32,364
I don't know really.

1256
01:22:32,464 --> 01:22:33,684
I think that thing's going pretty well.

1257
01:22:34,324 --> 01:22:35,544
One movie and it's over?

1258
01:22:35,664 --> 01:22:36,644
And that thing's still on the track.

1259
01:22:36,864 --> 01:22:38,304
So maybe it's going to come back.

1260
01:22:38,464 --> 01:22:39,784
And then like you just read.

1261
01:22:39,904 --> 01:22:41,024
I'm sorry to side tangent.

1262
01:22:41,164 --> 01:22:46,324
Did you guys read that piece on how like the universal had given up on the dark universe

1263
01:22:46,324 --> 01:22:53,324
and how which one Kurtzman is had like asked universal to build like all these offices that

1264
01:22:53,324 --> 01:22:59,164
were like decorated with giant sculptures of the monsters and artwork and murals and now they're

1265
01:22:59,164 --> 01:23:05,704
just empty and they have like a whole floor of offices that are all monster themed with like the

1266
01:23:05,704 --> 01:23:10,564
memorabilia and creative artwork and all this stuff and they're just like no one's in there.

1267
01:23:10,564 --> 01:23:11,944
It's just an empty floor.

1268
01:23:12,004 --> 01:23:17,344
Well that's a friend of the show and rabble rouser Jack Allison has pointed out like so

1269
01:23:17,344 --> 01:23:22,484
many companies that are having financial funny or die or you see me.

1270
01:23:23,804 --> 01:23:27,744
They just keep buying bigger buildings or running big offices.

1271
01:23:27,804 --> 01:23:30,024
It's like just don't do don't do that.

1272
01:23:30,464 --> 01:23:33,484
Regular office or like a fucking we work is fine.

1273
01:23:33,724 --> 01:23:35,704
Well it's also the universal monster thing drives me crazy.

1274
01:23:35,744 --> 01:23:38,984
I'm just going to say this very quickly because I say it any chance I get.

1275
01:23:38,984 --> 01:23:45,944
It is such a slam dunk that universal who pretty much has Jason Blum in house just goes

1276
01:23:45,944 --> 01:23:49,724
Jason Blum here's 40 million dollars make five monster movies.

1277
01:23:49,724 --> 01:23:55,684
Yeah make them at the same budget level you get interesting talent make them actually scary.

1278
01:23:55,684 --> 01:24:02,324
Instead they opened with like an Annie Lebowitz shoot like a photo shoot of like here's the stars.

1279
01:24:02,924 --> 01:24:03,584
Here's all the.

1280
01:24:03,584 --> 01:24:05,364
It's so much before the horse.

1281
01:24:06,264 --> 01:24:10,324
Because everyone is just pan everyone's just panicking like the Marvel there's 20

1282
01:24:10,324 --> 01:24:11,644
Marvel movies and they're all make money.

1283
01:24:11,644 --> 01:24:13,744
Okay we got 20 movies here we go.

1284
01:24:14,244 --> 01:24:18,924
Johnny Depp what is Javier Bardem right Angelina Jolie.

1285
01:24:18,924 --> 01:24:19,744
Oh Angelina Jolie.

1286
01:24:19,764 --> 01:24:22,084
These are the movies and then the first one eats shit.

1287
01:24:22,084 --> 01:24:22,964
It's so funny.

1288
01:24:22,984 --> 01:24:24,664
It was also Tom Cruise one.

1289
01:24:24,744 --> 01:24:26,544
It's the one it's the guy we all like.

1290
01:24:27,004 --> 01:24:31,064
But like he kept on doing these interviews where he was like you know the tricky thing

1291
01:24:31,064 --> 01:24:34,464
is they're horror movies but if you're going to make temples they can't be horror films so we have

1292
01:24:34,464 --> 01:24:36,844
to figure out how to adapt them to adventure films.

1293
01:24:37,024 --> 01:24:37,324
That's not true.

1294
01:24:37,324 --> 01:24:43,124
It's not fucking true because like fucking get out out grossed the mummy you know so like make

1295
01:24:43,124 --> 01:24:44,884
them actually scary.

1296
01:24:45,644 --> 01:24:50,404
And let them be like I like your thought about them being a little like lower budget because

1297
01:24:50,404 --> 01:24:56,424
all those original movies that still like you could still you could show a kid now the old

1298
01:24:56,424 --> 01:25:00,584
Frankenstein or Dracula and it would affect them and they're like weird and slow.

1299
01:25:01,064 --> 01:25:07,764
Has to be the monster like a good atmospheric director you know get good actors to play the

1300
01:25:07,764 --> 01:25:08,344
humans.

1301
01:25:08,584 --> 01:25:12,664
Sure like the thing is just give me like a good monster design you know and an interesting

1302
01:25:12,664 --> 01:25:13,744
vibe and all of that.

1303
01:25:13,744 --> 01:25:20,204
I'll say this too I mean I this just me bring back Frasier bring back Brenda Frasier.

1304
01:25:20,204 --> 01:25:22,984
Let's get let's reboot that mummy.

1305
01:25:23,144 --> 01:25:28,644
I thought you were suggesting that you bring Frasier Crane into the dark universe.

1306
01:25:28,784 --> 01:25:34,264
But like I watched I watched like the first 20 30 minutes of the Tom Cruise Mummy movie.

1307
01:25:34,284 --> 01:25:39,344
And I was a little stoned and normally I like everything when I'm stoned and I was just like

1308
01:25:39,344 --> 01:25:43,804
what the fuck like they found a bunch of sarcophagus is under London.

1309
01:25:43,804 --> 01:25:45,444
It's like it's the mummy.

1310
01:25:45,444 --> 01:25:46,984
Yes start in Egypt.

1311
01:25:47,024 --> 01:25:48,404
Are you insane?

1312
01:25:48,644 --> 01:25:50,064
What's wrong with you?

1313
01:25:50,084 --> 01:25:52,704
He become I haven't seen it does he become a mummy.

1314
01:25:52,804 --> 01:25:53,844
That's the ending.

1315
01:25:54,024 --> 01:25:55,244
He's the mummy right.

1316
01:25:55,384 --> 01:25:55,744
He's the mummy.

1317
01:25:55,784 --> 01:25:57,024
It takes a movie to get there.

1318
01:25:57,664 --> 01:26:04,444
He dies he falls out of a plane dies wakes up in a body bag and everyone's like yes

1319
01:26:04,444 --> 01:26:06,464
spoilers for this two year old.

1320
01:26:06,464 --> 01:26:11,124
Is he a bandaged mummy at the end of it.

1321
01:26:11,124 --> 01:26:13,404
His eyes turn a weird color.

1322
01:26:13,524 --> 01:26:15,624
He's handsome 57 year old mummy.

1323
01:26:15,964 --> 01:26:17,704
He's not a you want a fucking guy.

1324
01:26:17,924 --> 01:26:18,904
Bandages.

1325
01:26:18,904 --> 01:26:19,824
Yeah you want the bandages.

1326
01:26:20,284 --> 01:26:21,924
In a skeleton face if it was revealed.

1327
01:26:22,664 --> 01:26:22,724
Yeah.

1328
01:26:23,804 --> 01:26:28,204
Anything have the thing that's in the title be in the first 10 minutes of the movie.

1329
01:26:28,204 --> 01:26:33,264
Look how much people love Spider-Man Spider-Verse right and that's the thing I liked about it.

1330
01:26:33,264 --> 01:26:35,524
The most here we go Spider-Man Spider-Man.

1331
01:26:35,524 --> 01:26:39,124
I get it you don't need to which was sort of my thing.

1332
01:26:39,124 --> 01:26:44,644
I don't I'm not a big hater of the of the Seagull Muppets.

1333
01:26:44,644 --> 01:26:46,404
I like both of them a lot.

1334
01:26:46,604 --> 01:26:49,244
I actually don't like I like that film a lot.

1335
01:26:49,284 --> 01:26:50,084
I think it gets better.

1336
01:26:50,144 --> 01:26:50,404
Okay.

1337
01:26:51,684 --> 01:26:55,864
My feeling was like all right the pieces are back together.

1338
01:26:55,984 --> 01:27:02,124
Now can we be off to the races and have fun which I guess they did and it's up to the viewer is was

1339
01:27:02,124 --> 01:27:05,024
that fun or not for me it was not terribly fun.

1340
01:27:05,204 --> 01:27:08,404
I found it murky and I still didn't really want to be in this Russian prison.

1341
01:27:09,024 --> 01:27:15,164
The tee up was do a new Muppet show like that's a perfect for the time we live in a kind of thing

1342
01:27:15,164 --> 01:27:20,384
like because the most success weirdly Disney has had with any Muppet stuff since buying them is

1343
01:27:20,384 --> 01:27:23,884
when they do like oh it's like the Muppets singing Bohemian Rhapsody.

1344
01:27:24,244 --> 01:27:24,364
Yeah.

1345
01:27:24,364 --> 01:27:27,524
And it's like put that in the context of a variety show.

1346
01:27:28,024 --> 01:27:28,244
Sure.

1347
01:27:28,244 --> 01:27:33,024
Where you have musical sections and sketches and things like that you can have excerpt.

1348
01:27:33,344 --> 01:27:34,944
This is a sorry quick little side issue.

1349
01:27:35,084 --> 01:27:40,404
This is a thing I've I think this overlaps with my opinion about Will Ferrell at this point.

1350
01:27:40,884 --> 01:27:44,364
Do these things have to live as movies?

1351
01:27:44,404 --> 01:27:44,724
Sure.

1352
01:27:44,724 --> 01:27:48,904
Because clearly people love Will Ferrell when he's on a talk show.

1353
01:27:48,904 --> 01:27:49,144
Yeah.

1354
01:27:49,244 --> 01:27:50,224
Or hosts SNL.

1355
01:27:50,224 --> 01:27:53,964
Doing some short form or some oddity like the stuff he does with Funny or Die.

1356
01:27:55,184 --> 01:27:59,284
The Muppets people if they show up on SNL or a talk show.

1357
01:27:59,304 --> 01:27:59,544
Yeah people lose it.

1358
01:27:59,544 --> 01:28:01,304
In some small or those viral videos.

1359
01:28:01,324 --> 01:28:01,624
Yeah.

1360
01:28:01,624 --> 01:28:03,884
Those are all still extremely successful.

1361
01:28:04,724 --> 01:28:09,724
Do all of do the things that we let do we have to force these giant tent pole situations.

1362
01:28:09,724 --> 01:28:13,564
I don't need the Muppets to be like crown jewels in the Disney Kingdom.

1363
01:28:13,664 --> 01:28:17,364
But I think what you need is one clear creative head.

1364
01:28:17,544 --> 01:28:17,884
Yeah.

1365
01:28:18,004 --> 01:28:22,364
Who's like whether it's something in the theme park whether it's having them on a talk show

1366
01:28:22,364 --> 01:28:28,064
whether we're doing a short form this or that you want like one person who's like a comedy writer.

1367
01:28:28,064 --> 01:28:28,884
Yeah.

1368
01:28:29,004 --> 01:28:35,524
Who's like keyed into their voices and is like I'm overseeing that all this stuff isn't dumb.

1369
01:28:35,524 --> 01:28:38,344
Are you pitching yourself for this job?

1370
01:28:38,424 --> 01:28:39,584
This is like my dream job.

1371
01:28:39,584 --> 01:28:44,324
But I also think like I was gonna say when I sit down and I go like pine this guy if you

1372
01:28:44,324 --> 01:28:47,664
could do anything in your career what would it be and I'd be like oh I'd love to create like

1373
01:28:47,664 --> 01:28:51,364
the new Muppets like I'd love to just like create a world and cast characters like that.

1374
01:28:51,364 --> 01:28:52,524
Happy time murders got it.

1375
01:28:52,984 --> 01:28:53,284
Right.

1376
01:28:53,584 --> 01:28:57,864
You know unfortunately I was replaced two days into filming.

1377
01:28:58,324 --> 01:29:00,364
They took the film in a very different direction.

1378
01:29:01,124 --> 01:29:02,944
Replaced by Brian Henson.

1379
01:29:04,164 --> 01:29:08,724
No but I do think it's one of those things where you kind of couldn't

1380
01:29:08,724 --> 01:29:14,384
do it today in the same way because it would be front loaded it would be like the goal is

1381
01:29:14,384 --> 01:29:19,304
to make characters that could last for 50 years and bring in this much in merchandising you know

1382
01:29:19,304 --> 01:29:24,544
per year and the fact that it was like so homegrown and evolved slowly over time.

1383
01:29:24,844 --> 01:29:25,664
Organic I'd say.

1384
01:29:26,024 --> 01:29:26,324
Yeah.

1385
01:29:27,304 --> 01:29:32,504
The best the real quick the best this is another theme park thing we'll eventually talk about this

1386
01:29:32,504 --> 01:29:39,244
actual film I think but the best thing in the Muppets in the last 10 to 15 years for me is the

1387
01:29:39,244 --> 01:29:42,284
show in Orlando that they do the great moments in history.

1388
01:29:42,284 --> 01:29:42,884
That's what I've heard.

1389
01:29:43,684 --> 01:29:49,104
And it's so great it's like 10 minutes long it's putt they come out it's funny it's all the same

1390
01:29:49,104 --> 01:29:54,424
it's great it's like that's the pure that's the most pure they've felt to me in years.

1391
01:29:54,424 --> 01:29:56,544
Do we know who's responsible for that?

1392
01:29:57,044 --> 01:29:57,384
We do.

1393
01:29:57,664 --> 01:29:58,544
We met one of the gentlemen.

1394
01:29:59,504 --> 01:30:00,404
One of the Knots guys.

1395
01:30:00,764 --> 01:30:01,764
That guy we met at Knots.

1396
01:30:01,884 --> 01:30:02,664
Oh I met him.

1397
01:30:02,784 --> 01:30:03,224
You met him.

1398
01:30:03,224 --> 01:30:03,544
Yeah.

1399
01:30:03,544 --> 01:30:04,044
Oh cool.

1400
01:30:04,244 --> 01:30:07,644
It's like a theme park guy wrote that and not like a comedy person.

1401
01:30:07,704 --> 01:30:12,864
I mean I'm not sure how many people work he was just one of the main imagineers on it so I don't

1402
01:30:12,864 --> 01:30:15,764
know who if he actually wrote I forget did he write the scripts?

1403
01:30:16,184 --> 01:30:17,864
Well we have to go find him and interview him.

1404
01:30:17,864 --> 01:30:18,384
We'll have to ask.

1405
01:30:18,584 --> 01:30:21,464
But there's five different shows they do too so it's like.

1406
01:30:21,464 --> 01:30:22,404
Oh that changes from there?

1407
01:30:22,404 --> 01:30:26,644
Yeah the show's changing like they show up different places in Liberty Square.

1408
01:30:27,324 --> 01:30:31,024
Sometimes they're in different windows and sometimes it's a whole different narrative

1409
01:30:31,024 --> 01:30:32,584
it's it's so great.

1410
01:30:32,704 --> 01:30:37,344
Isn't there like a rumor going around they might do something like that at the sort of

1411
01:30:37,344 --> 01:30:41,444
threshold point of Galaxy's Edge to slow down for traffic?

1412
01:30:41,984 --> 01:30:42,604
From a Muppets thing?

1413
01:30:42,864 --> 01:30:47,764
Yeah to do a Muppet like elevated window show like that because you because it's right by

1414
01:30:47,764 --> 01:30:50,324
right where Muppet Vision used to be in California.

1415
01:30:50,704 --> 01:30:56,544
That weird abandoned now here's we're constantly screening trailers for the Nutcracker.

1416
01:30:56,804 --> 01:30:58,884
You were saying a show in California Adventure as well?

1417
01:30:59,364 --> 01:31:00,124
I've heard both.

1418
01:31:00,504 --> 01:31:05,284
I was thinking you were talking about because there is a I've heard from Jim and Len Jim Hill.

1419
01:31:05,724 --> 01:31:06,864
You're familiar.

1420
01:31:06,924 --> 01:31:07,684
Oh are you?

1421
01:31:08,124 --> 01:31:10,124
Yeah I used to read Jim Hill Media a lot in high school.

1422
01:31:10,144 --> 01:31:10,684
Of course.

1423
01:31:10,684 --> 01:31:15,804
I can't believe I ever hear that phrase from anyone that I'm talking to today.

1424
01:31:16,404 --> 01:31:21,404
Like so there were there were other high schoolers staying inside and checking Jim Hill Media.

1425
01:31:21,524 --> 01:31:27,504
Wonderful because the rumor I've heard is that they're going to do it to kind of

1426
01:31:27,504 --> 01:31:30,424
entertain people online for Galaxy's Edge in Hollywood Studios.

1427
01:31:30,604 --> 01:31:33,984
The people who are waiting there to try to get through the gates.

1428
01:31:34,144 --> 01:31:36,424
Right and they're waiting there for six seven eight hours.

1429
01:31:36,444 --> 01:31:37,324
At least they'll be entertained.

1430
01:31:37,704 --> 01:31:39,964
Not Disneyland that's not on the cards for Disneyland.

1431
01:31:40,824 --> 01:31:44,384
You're saying also there was a rumor over in California Adventure they were going to do it.

1432
01:31:45,104 --> 01:31:49,844
I did hear something about like a new Muppet thing floated but I feel like that's I haven't

1433
01:31:49,844 --> 01:31:51,784
heard it in so long I don't think it's going to happen.

1434
01:31:52,264 --> 01:31:57,124
Yeah Muppet Adventure 3D kind of died a slow painful death in California Adventure.

1435
01:31:57,124 --> 01:32:00,124
It took so long to get it over there in the first place.

1436
01:32:00,384 --> 01:32:02,344
It's so stupid that it kind of like.

1437
01:32:02,344 --> 01:32:09,084
So like 2014 it became like the Frozen sing-along show and then after that it was just like either

1438
01:32:09,564 --> 01:32:11,904
Pixar shorts or like movie pre.

1439
01:32:11,984 --> 01:32:17,404
I think it's literally now like Nutcracker and the Four Realms like it's a trailer showcase.

1440
01:32:17,404 --> 01:32:19,064
Permanently Nutcracker and the Four Realms.

1441
01:32:20,624 --> 01:32:23,844
I mean we all love the Nutcracker and all his realms.

1442
01:32:24,024 --> 01:32:28,044
How would you guys rank the realms if you had to rank the realms?

1443
01:32:28,364 --> 01:32:30,164
It's like choosing a favorite child.

1444
01:32:30,304 --> 01:32:31,204
Yeah good point.

1445
01:32:31,664 --> 01:32:33,744
I like the gumdrop realm the best.

1446
01:32:33,844 --> 01:32:34,684
Yeah definitely.

1447
01:32:34,704 --> 01:32:36,004
I assume that's all candy paste.

1448
01:32:36,344 --> 01:32:36,604
Definitely yeah.

1449
01:32:36,824 --> 01:32:37,964
Spread sounds like a realm yes.

1450
01:32:38,384 --> 01:32:41,684
But it didn't open in California Adventure until like 2001?

1451
01:32:42,024 --> 01:32:43,764
Well it was an opening day attraction.

1452
01:32:43,944 --> 01:32:44,404
Okay yeah.

1453
01:32:44,784 --> 01:32:51,084
But the rumor was always that it was a big hit out of the gate at Disney MGM Studios.

1454
01:32:51,084 --> 01:32:55,404
We got to get it to Disneyland and the rumor was always that it would replace Great Moments

1455
01:32:55,404 --> 01:32:56,324
with Mr. Lincoln.

1456
01:32:56,984 --> 01:32:58,504
Right a touchy subject I understand.

1457
01:32:58,944 --> 01:33:01,784
I completely think it should have been done.

1458
01:33:02,084 --> 01:33:03,884
Like it would be gone by now.

1459
01:33:03,884 --> 01:33:07,944
That would be like a weird hole and maybe you could have brought back Lincoln by now.

1460
01:33:07,964 --> 01:33:10,264
But for sure in that time.

1461
01:33:10,624 --> 01:33:17,404
Because then it just you know you wait 10 years put it in the other park with by the way into

1462
01:33:17,404 --> 01:33:19,504
by the way a shittier looking building.

1463
01:33:19,644 --> 01:33:24,444
I think that brick building where you see it in Disney MGM Studios.

1464
01:33:24,464 --> 01:33:25,904
It's one of the best things you got going for it.

1465
01:33:25,924 --> 01:33:29,144
It's such a wonderful place and quick little detail.

1466
01:33:30,144 --> 01:33:36,724
When I was growing up there in Thousand Oaks California there was the optometrist's office

1467
01:33:36,724 --> 01:33:41,744
where I had to go as a kid and get my like eye drops and vision checked and stuff.

1468
01:33:42,004 --> 01:33:48,284
And the optometrist's office was this big brick building that to me looked like the Muppet Vision 3D building.

1469
01:33:48,344 --> 01:33:53,104
And it made me want to go get eye drops and go to the eye doctor.

1470
01:33:53,764 --> 01:33:56,284
It was like an otherwise very unpleasant experience.

1471
01:33:56,424 --> 01:33:59,064
I was like oh I get to go to that building that reminds me of Muppet.

1472
01:33:59,064 --> 01:34:00,384
There was nothing fun inside.

1473
01:34:00,744 --> 01:34:01,404
No no no.

1474
01:34:01,704 --> 01:34:02,404
Just the outside.

1475
01:34:02,424 --> 01:34:03,604
Of course you have to get your eyes dilated.

1476
01:34:03,704 --> 01:34:04,224
It's one of the worst.

1477
01:34:04,344 --> 01:34:05,664
I hate that still to this day.

1478
01:34:05,924 --> 01:34:08,984
I find it very satisfying.

1479
01:34:09,644 --> 01:34:11,124
I'm like a hip and a bandaid on.

1480
01:34:11,224 --> 01:34:12,164
It's something nice about it.

1481
01:34:12,244 --> 01:34:16,484
And then you get the glasses which are kind of like 3D glasses.

1482
01:34:16,504 --> 01:34:16,744
Sure.

1483
01:34:16,744 --> 01:34:17,864
The eye doctor glasses.

1484
01:34:17,884 --> 01:34:23,364
That's how you worked your way into enjoying the eye test.

1485
01:34:23,444 --> 01:34:23,784
Yeah.

1486
01:34:23,844 --> 01:34:24,424
Yeah yeah yeah.

1487
01:34:24,424 --> 01:34:26,444
This feels Muppet Vision adjacent.

1488
01:34:26,704 --> 01:34:29,464
That's how passionate I am about that.

1489
01:34:29,504 --> 01:34:31,844
I think that Muppet Vision building is so nice.

1490
01:34:32,044 --> 01:34:34,664
And then anyway my point was it gets out here.

1491
01:34:34,684 --> 01:34:38,444
Does it go into the grand beautiful Main Street Opera House?

1492
01:34:38,564 --> 01:34:41,864
No it goes into some junky square building.

1493
01:34:42,304 --> 01:34:42,484
It's so generic.

1494
01:34:42,484 --> 01:34:43,744
The sign is worse.

1495
01:34:43,944 --> 01:34:46,584
It's just kind of slapdash paint everywhere.

1496
01:34:47,304 --> 01:34:50,704
Probably the justification being you know it's Muppet.

1497
01:34:50,784 --> 01:34:51,844
So they just threw it together.

1498
01:34:52,244 --> 01:34:52,844
It's a sound stage.

1499
01:34:53,184 --> 01:34:53,924
It's just a sound stage.

1500
01:34:54,364 --> 01:34:56,244
But it looks like a bad 90s sound stage.

1501
01:34:56,324 --> 01:34:59,864
Like it doesn't even have a classical old timey Hollywood architecture.

1502
01:34:59,864 --> 01:35:03,844
That whole corner of the park like especially in the early versions of

1503
01:35:04,724 --> 01:35:10,764
California Adventure was like a very watered down MGM Studios.

1504
01:35:11,384 --> 01:35:15,204
And even had a lot of the same sort of font and signage and stuff.

1505
01:35:15,344 --> 01:35:19,704
And then it's just kind of like morphed and mutated over the years.

1506
01:35:19,844 --> 01:35:24,344
Like they've had big plans that have been scrapped or like oh the budget didn't show

1507
01:35:24,344 --> 01:35:25,384
up and that sort of thing.

1508
01:35:25,544 --> 01:35:30,144
But like yeah now that theater is just kind of yeah like you said Nutcracker in the Four Realms.

1509
01:35:30,144 --> 01:35:31,124
It's so depressing.

1510
01:35:31,124 --> 01:35:35,024
And it really is just like you can tell it's designed for something.

1511
01:35:35,084 --> 01:35:39,644
Yes and that little store that little stand next to it used to be all Muppet stuff.

1512
01:35:39,684 --> 01:35:41,224
Like fun Muppet merch.

1513
01:35:41,464 --> 01:35:48,804
Which even I went to MGM Studios last fall and I was so excited to buy some Muppet merch.

1514
01:35:48,864 --> 01:35:49,324
It's low.

1515
01:35:49,344 --> 01:35:53,144
That store has maybe one wall of like four plushes.

1516
01:35:53,484 --> 01:35:53,604
It sucks.

1517
01:35:53,924 --> 01:35:55,504
I was there like 10 years ago.

1518
01:35:55,524 --> 01:35:57,244
It's mostly Jack Skellington that store.

1519
01:35:57,264 --> 01:35:57,864
Yeah it sucks.

1520
01:35:58,064 --> 01:36:00,244
10-11 years ago filled with Muppet stuff.

1521
01:36:00,244 --> 01:36:02,884
Like I got a shirt with just Beaker's head on it.

1522
01:36:02,884 --> 01:36:05,244
And I always check compliments on it.

1523
01:36:05,584 --> 01:36:06,164
That was all I wanted.

1524
01:36:06,384 --> 01:36:12,764
The problem of course I like I'd love to blame Disney's easy but the problem is I'm sure that

1525
01:36:12,764 --> 01:36:16,864
most tourists go in there and are more likely to buy a Jack Skellington doll.

1526
01:36:16,924 --> 01:36:18,324
I know the numbers back it up.

1527
01:36:18,504 --> 01:36:22,204
Like on Questway there's a reason why they do that but it still feels disrespectful.

1528
01:36:22,204 --> 01:36:23,024
I agree.

1529
01:36:23,524 --> 01:36:26,184
Because the thing's still called like Muppet stuff or whatever.

1530
01:36:26,704 --> 01:36:29,344
Yeah and the fountain I was like the fountain outside.

1531
01:36:29,344 --> 01:36:32,324
That whole area used to be called the Muppet's Courtyard.

1532
01:36:32,524 --> 01:36:34,584
It is now called Grand Avenue.

1533
01:36:34,844 --> 01:36:40,164
And they're sort of like a topsy microbrewery sort of thing which is one of the ways they'll

1534
01:36:40,164 --> 01:36:43,464
placate the masses while they wait in six hour lines.

1535
01:36:43,484 --> 01:36:45,084
And Pizzeria is a fucking disaster.

1536
01:36:45,324 --> 01:36:46,464
That place is an upfront.

1537
01:36:46,864 --> 01:36:48,164
Hold on.

1538
01:36:48,844 --> 01:36:50,284
This isn't necessarily us.

1539
01:36:50,724 --> 01:36:56,924
This has come up on the show before and in fact I don't know with the timing but if you're

1540
01:36:56,924 --> 01:37:00,984
interested in the further dissection of Pizzeria, subscribe to our Patreon.

1541
01:37:01,604 --> 01:37:03,384
Have you recorded a Pizzeria episode?

1542
01:37:03,504 --> 01:37:04,024
No.

1543
01:37:04,744 --> 01:37:05,224
We will.

1544
01:37:05,464 --> 01:37:08,804
But it's a subjective debate because it was trashed on this show.

1545
01:37:09,224 --> 01:37:09,884
I trashed it.

1546
01:37:10,044 --> 01:37:18,124
Our friend Doug Jones sat and stewed at home listening and recently came on the show and

1547
01:37:18,124 --> 01:37:26,904
he was mad at me because he was there in Florida and he texted me a picture of him in front of

1548
01:37:26,904 --> 01:37:29,684
me which kind of gave a response or something, a couple lines or whatever.

1549
01:37:29,904 --> 01:37:35,324
And I think I disrespected him by doing that and then he came on the show and you'll hear it.

1550
01:37:35,604 --> 01:37:37,384
Yeah, that's pizza Gotti is not.

1551
01:37:37,484 --> 01:37:39,104
Pizza Rizzo Gotti is not.

1552
01:37:39,104 --> 01:37:44,404
So he came on to take me to task about Pizza Rizzo and he's very passionate about it.

1553
01:37:44,464 --> 01:37:48,984
So I guess if Doug Jones come at me, the pizza is garbage and the theming is an upfront.

1554
01:37:49,844 --> 01:37:58,024
How do you not do like a pizza down the line, the pizza rev or all these places down the line,

1555
01:37:58,064 --> 01:37:59,644
pick what you want, make your own pizza.

1556
01:37:59,724 --> 01:38:01,804
It's the worst hockey puck pizza.

1557
01:38:02,944 --> 01:38:07,624
Although they put that in now in downtown Disney out here, like the Vianapoli where you could just

1558
01:38:07,624 --> 01:38:08,464
get slices to go.

1559
01:38:08,484 --> 01:38:12,224
Now it's like that sort of Chipotle, like make your own miniature pizza.

1560
01:38:12,764 --> 01:38:15,224
I got to try that because I'm a little skeptical.

1561
01:38:15,224 --> 01:38:20,524
I feel like it's like cafeteria, like heat lamp, like it's just their box and they pull it.

1562
01:38:20,584 --> 01:38:21,744
I didn't eat it to be fair.

1563
01:38:21,944 --> 01:38:26,144
So I don't even want to after what Doug and I got into, I don't even want to say anything if I'm not

1564
01:38:26,144 --> 01:38:31,284
informed because he pointed out there's a room and you'll hear this if you go to the Patreon episode.

1565
01:38:31,624 --> 01:38:35,684
There's a room upstairs with a disco ball and I did miss that room.

1566
01:38:35,744 --> 01:38:39,364
I think we didn't go upstairs when I went there, but I thoroughly explored the downstairs and saw

1567
01:38:39,364 --> 01:38:41,164
nothing that made me feel good.

1568
01:38:41,164 --> 01:38:47,784
I agree with you, but I'm saying I have to now go back to Pizza Rizzo and when I go, I will do

1569
01:38:47,784 --> 01:38:51,424
probably an official review with Doug of Pizza Rizzo.

1570
01:38:51,744 --> 01:38:59,204
I'd also like to tease that if you go check out this episode, we also get a ruling on Pizza Rizzo

1571
01:38:59,204 --> 01:39:05,064
from someone who works in the Jim Henson creature shop and I don't want to say either way which way

1572
01:39:05,064 --> 01:39:08,904
they go about it, but let this be an enticement to go.

1573
01:39:08,904 --> 01:39:10,764
I'm not sure if it'll be out yet or not, but go check it out.

1574
01:39:11,204 --> 01:39:14,324
Pizza looks like the 1996 theme park pizza.

1575
01:39:14,404 --> 01:39:15,184
It's so bad.

1576
01:39:16,524 --> 01:39:22,184
That pizza planet was always so disappointing that I was like, I have no problem with them

1577
01:39:22,184 --> 01:39:25,964
replacing that in the hopes that maybe they build a proper pizza plant somewhere else.

1578
01:39:26,224 --> 01:39:28,404
It's nice that there'll be a Muppet restaurant there.

1579
01:39:28,524 --> 01:39:31,644
At least it seems like they're affirming their commitment to the Muppets.

1580
01:39:32,544 --> 01:39:34,724
Rizzo's gotten a short stick in recent memory.

1581
01:39:34,824 --> 01:39:36,904
He's barely represented in the Seagull movies.

1582
01:39:37,224 --> 01:39:38,144
I love pizza.

1583
01:39:38,184 --> 01:39:39,184
Give it to me.

1584
01:39:39,184 --> 01:39:43,524
I talked my whole group into, we must eat lunch at Pizza Rizzo.

1585
01:39:43,684 --> 01:39:47,504
Which is funny because Mama Melrose around the corner is good.

1586
01:39:47,924 --> 01:39:49,484
My family loves it.

1587
01:39:49,624 --> 01:39:50,564
We always have a good view.

1588
01:39:50,584 --> 01:39:54,164
We have to support the Muppets, especially after this poor showing at the gift shop.

1589
01:39:54,484 --> 01:39:57,284
We need to show them that there's interest in Muppet theme.

1590
01:39:57,644 --> 01:40:03,224
Does everybody know that there was a world where in a bigger Muppet area,

1591
01:40:03,904 --> 01:40:07,884
that space was going to be something called, there's concept art that I'm looking at right now,

1592
01:40:08,324 --> 01:40:12,744
that very building is labeled the Swedish Chef's Video Cooking School.

1593
01:40:12,784 --> 01:40:17,584
There's a giant balloon of his big head on the top.

1594
01:40:17,664 --> 01:40:18,764
It was going to be a whole land, right?

1595
01:40:19,024 --> 01:40:21,824
That's the part of the land where there's going to be a whole big ride.

1596
01:40:22,444 --> 01:40:24,904
I feel like we can't even get into it in this one.

1597
01:40:24,904 --> 01:40:25,184
I know.

1598
01:40:25,224 --> 01:40:30,404
But if the listeners don't know, Muppet Studios, this is the most disappointing thing of all.

1599
01:40:30,484 --> 01:40:37,024
The Muppet Vision 3D was to be but one part of the greater area where also this restaurant

1600
01:40:37,084 --> 01:40:44,404
and the Muppet movie ride, a parody of the great movie ride with Muppets front to back,

1601
01:40:44,764 --> 01:40:49,284
a Frankenstein scene going haywire and all the Muppets are in Peter Pan,

1602
01:40:49,684 --> 01:40:55,424
it's Miss Piggy or something and she's too big and the rope is breaking and that kind of shit.

1603
01:40:55,724 --> 01:40:59,344
So making fun of what they would go on to actually do,

1604
01:41:00,024 --> 01:41:04,244
like parading, like we'll put the Muppets in classic stories,

1605
01:41:04,324 --> 01:41:09,804
the ride parading that idea which then became what they actually went on to do.

1606
01:41:09,884 --> 01:41:10,364
What they do earnestly.

1607
01:41:10,644 --> 01:41:17,024
And there is a video somewhere, shout out to Rob Plays on YouTube, we made a little video about

1608
01:41:17,024 --> 01:41:22,584
this, but in that there's a clip of Jim Henson even talking about that ride and his framing of

1609
01:41:22,584 --> 01:41:26,984
it is so wonderfully simple where he just says, you know, it's a ride about showing the process

1610
01:41:26,984 --> 01:41:30,844
of making movies, only all of the information is wrong.

1611
01:41:31,804 --> 01:41:33,304
That's so funny.

1612
01:41:33,304 --> 01:41:40,484
And you also go like how in this many decades has there still not been like a ride that's a

1613
01:41:40,484 --> 01:41:44,804
parody of rides and the Muppets are the perfect vehicle to do that.

1614
01:41:44,804 --> 01:41:46,644
The Simpsons is the closest.

1615
01:41:46,744 --> 01:41:48,944
Oh you're right, you're right, that is the closest.

1616
01:41:49,544 --> 01:41:56,684
That gets there, but that also feels a little more cynical maybe I want to say.

1617
01:41:56,744 --> 01:41:57,464
Sure, sure, sure.

1618
01:41:57,584 --> 01:42:00,724
Which is maybe the beauty of the Muppets that it's,

1619
01:42:00,724 --> 01:42:01,764
I like the Simpsons ride.

1620
01:42:02,024 --> 01:42:09,364
They were sort of like, you know, the Muppets are sort of like commentary and meta and subverting

1621
01:42:09,364 --> 01:42:14,244
before the 90s where commentary and subverting becomes much more cynical.

1622
01:42:14,244 --> 01:42:16,564
It had to be a negative slant on the thing.

1623
01:42:17,084 --> 01:42:23,224
Like this, people, it always hit when Rizzo comes out as Mickey or when Waldo turns into Mickey at

1624
01:42:23,224 --> 01:42:25,524
the end, people ate that shit up.

1625
01:42:26,884 --> 01:42:31,584
I specifically remember both of my parents dying at it who don't have the same sense of humor

1626
01:42:31,584 --> 01:42:36,064
whatsoever and the whole family is literally laughing out loud together.

1627
01:42:36,344 --> 01:42:39,044
Such joy from that and a lot of other parts of this.

1628
01:42:39,164 --> 01:42:43,584
The Muppets always felt more dangerous than like the Disney characters, just a little bit.

1629
01:42:43,584 --> 01:42:46,004
They felt just a little bit edgy.

1630
01:42:46,164 --> 01:42:46,944
But not dirty.

1631
01:42:47,044 --> 01:42:52,104
Not dirty, so like when like Rizzo's making fun of Mickey it feels like a little dangerous.

1632
01:42:52,304 --> 01:42:54,384
Like you get like a little edge, you know?

1633
01:42:54,384 --> 01:42:58,344
And when Waldo turns into Mickey at the end.

1634
01:42:58,444 --> 01:42:59,584
Yeah, well, I want to say this.

1635
01:42:59,664 --> 01:43:02,404
I think Waldo is the Pizzeria of Muppets.

1636
01:43:02,684 --> 01:43:06,444
Waldo is the one thing that really doesn't age for me.

1637
01:43:06,544 --> 01:43:09,964
I was going to ask worst Muppet of all time is Waldo.

1638
01:43:10,064 --> 01:43:10,524
It's Waldo.

1639
01:43:10,644 --> 01:43:11,644
It's Waldo with a poet.

1640
01:43:11,804 --> 01:43:12,284
I'm not sure.

1641
01:43:12,704 --> 01:43:14,644
I totally I don't hate Sesame Street.

1642
01:43:14,764 --> 01:43:16,344
I don't hate Waldo that much.

1643
01:43:16,604 --> 01:43:17,284
I don't either.

1644
01:43:17,824 --> 01:43:19,244
I kind of don't like.

1645
01:43:19,384 --> 01:43:21,984
Well, I like him, but I hate to put him at the bottom of the list.

1646
01:43:22,044 --> 01:43:23,004
I don't hate him, though.

1647
01:43:23,004 --> 01:43:25,484
I do have an answer for this and I don't you know what?

1648
01:43:25,744 --> 01:43:30,324
Anyone feel free to send me something that negates this and I don't even have a hatred

1649
01:43:30,324 --> 01:43:35,644
of this character, but I will say that I felt very on the outside when they started using

1650
01:43:35,644 --> 01:43:37,444
that shrimp all the time.

1651
01:43:37,484 --> 01:43:37,844
Pepe.

1652
01:43:38,224 --> 01:43:41,904
I don't I never saw what was the source of Pepe that was funny.

1653
01:43:42,204 --> 01:43:44,904
Suddenly he's just around aggressively too much.

1654
01:43:44,964 --> 01:43:48,344
They made a big play for him to be one of the big five in the early 2000s.

1655
01:43:48,364 --> 01:43:51,544
This is when they had sold to a German company and no one knew what they were doing.

1656
01:43:51,704 --> 01:43:56,304
And I think Rizzo seemed a little too 90s and they were like the 2000s new millennium.

1657
01:43:56,424 --> 01:43:57,284
It's all about Pepe.

1658
01:43:57,584 --> 01:43:59,644
I think a little Pepe goes a long way.

1659
01:43:59,644 --> 01:43:59,884
I agree.

1660
01:43:59,984 --> 01:44:01,064
I'll say this.

1661
01:44:01,864 --> 01:44:08,244
I don't I don't care for Dr. Bunsen Honeydew's negligence because Bunsen Beaker.

1662
01:44:08,344 --> 01:44:10,644
Sorry, Beaker always ends up paying the price.

1663
01:44:11,464 --> 01:44:12,644
And I think that's.

1664
01:44:12,684 --> 01:44:13,024
Wait a minute.

1665
01:44:13,024 --> 01:44:13,804
This is funny, though.

1666
01:44:14,144 --> 01:44:15,244
Yeah, I mean, it's funny.

1667
01:44:15,244 --> 01:44:15,744
It's funny.

1668
01:44:16,324 --> 01:44:17,724
Wait, but you don't hate him the most.

1669
01:44:17,724 --> 01:44:18,864
No, I don't hate him.

1670
01:44:18,864 --> 01:44:22,524
I just don't care for his last attitude towards lab.

1671
01:44:22,524 --> 01:44:26,464
So you find his behavior kind of cruel, kind of cruel, kind of cruise.

1672
01:44:26,464 --> 01:44:28,504
Is he your least favorite Muppet, though?

1673
01:44:29,504 --> 01:44:31,204
See, I think he's a great straight man.

1674
01:44:31,204 --> 01:44:33,604
Yeah, I always loved on it.

1675
01:44:33,604 --> 01:44:35,244
You're being funny now.

1676
01:44:35,244 --> 01:44:42,864
Do you hate that he doesn't have features that he's just like a he has like no hair?

1677
01:44:43,164 --> 01:44:45,464
No, because that I actually think makes him special.

1678
01:44:46,404 --> 01:44:47,584
Yeah, I don't know.

1679
01:44:47,624 --> 01:44:50,364
I don't know if I have like a least favorite Muppet.

1680
01:44:50,384 --> 01:44:54,384
I'm not sure that I totally hate a Muppet, but I just don't really get.

1681
01:44:54,584 --> 01:44:56,484
This is my Pepe theory.

1682
01:44:56,724 --> 01:44:58,024
Pepe is in Muppets tonight.

1683
01:44:58,384 --> 01:45:02,104
He's part of a two person act Seymour and Pepe.

1684
01:45:02,584 --> 01:45:09,464
And they're like the doorman to the studio where they film and Seymour is like a big fat elephant type.

1685
01:45:09,464 --> 01:45:14,504
Who's kind of dim and Pepe is sort of more the like wheeler dealer type.

1686
01:45:14,504 --> 01:45:18,204
And it would always be that they would stop the celebrity guest who was trying to come in.

1687
01:45:18,264 --> 01:45:22,764
It was sort of their version of scooter knocking on the door and going five minutes of show time.

1688
01:45:22,764 --> 01:45:26,584
It was like Pepe being like, I need to see ID or whatever his thing was.

1689
01:45:26,824 --> 01:45:29,604
And they'd always get into like a fight with the with the guest.

1690
01:45:30,064 --> 01:45:33,404
And so I think Pepe was like kind of worked as part of the duo.

1691
01:45:33,884 --> 01:45:39,644
And the Muppets from space, the weakest of the Muppet films, they bump Pepe way up.

1692
01:45:39,964 --> 01:45:41,024
Seymour is gone.

1693
01:45:41,444 --> 01:45:43,744
Pepe just kind of becomes a little stinker.

1694
01:45:43,744 --> 01:45:47,424
But in a bad movie, Pepe kind of pops.

1695
01:45:47,464 --> 01:45:54,464
And I think it's because it's like here is a character being played by the person who developed him.

1696
01:45:54,904 --> 01:45:57,144
Like the one like the original one that we love.

1697
01:45:57,184 --> 01:46:01,444
Right. Because that's like the movie where Frank Oz isn't puppeteering anymore.

1698
01:46:01,464 --> 01:46:03,144
He's dubbing in the voices later.

1699
01:46:03,664 --> 01:46:09,424
OK. Dave Gould is still doing gonzo, but they've kind of, as you said, domesticated him a little bit.

1700
01:46:09,604 --> 01:46:11,504
Pepe feels a little more pure.

1701
01:46:11,504 --> 01:46:15,824
So I think when a German company is buying Muppets at a point where they're that dinged,

1702
01:46:15,944 --> 01:46:17,404
they go, Pepe's got a little heat.

1703
01:46:17,544 --> 01:46:19,004
Like there's a little torque on Pepe.

1704
01:46:19,044 --> 01:46:20,324
We might be able to run with this.

1705
01:46:20,624 --> 01:46:23,384
And they start leading with him in merchandise and stuff.

1706
01:46:23,504 --> 01:46:25,784
But maybe they pushed it a little too.

1707
01:46:25,884 --> 01:46:26,524
Way too hard.

1708
01:46:27,264 --> 01:46:29,904
He did like Long John Silver's commercials.

1709
01:46:30,204 --> 01:46:31,044
Oh, I remember those.

1710
01:46:31,504 --> 01:46:31,524
Yeah.

1711
01:46:31,524 --> 01:46:36,124
Well, let's talk about the original Muppet duo, Statler and Waldorf.

1712
01:46:36,644 --> 01:46:37,624
Yeah, two of the greats.

1713
01:46:37,624 --> 01:46:38,424
Two of the greats.

1714
01:46:38,524 --> 01:46:40,144
Here, they're animatronics.

1715
01:46:41,344 --> 01:46:42,584
I think that's great.

1716
01:46:42,704 --> 01:46:48,964
I think some of the elements that make Muppet Vision 3D stand out and make it repeatable,

1717
01:46:49,064 --> 01:46:52,224
as opposed to like Honey, I Shrunk the Audience, which we talked about recently,

1718
01:46:52,644 --> 01:46:55,164
you get a full size Sweetums walking around.

1719
01:46:55,324 --> 01:46:56,804
You get a Bean Bunny animatronic.

1720
01:46:56,924 --> 01:46:58,044
You get Statler and Waldorf.

1721
01:46:58,084 --> 01:46:59,284
The Penguin Orchestra.

1722
01:46:59,304 --> 01:47:00,304
The Penguin Orchestra.

1723
01:47:00,704 --> 01:47:01,544
Chef with a gun.

1724
01:47:01,864 --> 01:47:03,004
And then Chef with a cannon.

1725
01:47:03,004 --> 01:47:05,924
Specifically, Musket, which is the funniest gun.

1726
01:47:05,924 --> 01:47:06,744
The funniest gun.

1727
01:47:06,984 --> 01:47:08,744
Musket is such a funny gun.

1728
01:47:08,844 --> 01:47:09,524
He's nonsense language.

1729
01:47:09,724 --> 01:47:12,924
I thought his nonsense speak was just hilarious as a kid.

1730
01:47:13,224 --> 01:47:15,324
Do you know the effect of the damage to the theaters?

1731
01:47:15,684 --> 01:47:17,024
Damage to the theater is really good.

1732
01:47:17,844 --> 01:47:20,804
Statler and Waldorf, by the way, when I got older, I realized,

1733
01:47:20,844 --> 01:47:22,324
oh, they're both named after hotels.

1734
01:47:22,504 --> 01:47:23,304
That's a joke.

1735
01:47:23,384 --> 01:47:26,724
But I found out another thing.

1736
01:47:27,644 --> 01:47:33,264
The Statler line of hotels was the first mid-range line for tourists and business travelers.

1737
01:47:35,644 --> 01:47:38,884
And Waldorf and Historia has always been like a super fancy hotel.

1738
01:47:39,084 --> 01:47:42,384
So Statler and Waldorf, I think there is an extra joke in there too.

1739
01:47:42,724 --> 01:47:43,744
In the contrast.

1740
01:47:43,984 --> 01:47:44,864
They're mismatched.

1741
01:47:45,244 --> 01:47:46,064
They're mismatched.

1742
01:47:46,404 --> 01:47:48,464
Yeah, they're not Waldorf and Historia.

1743
01:47:48,564 --> 01:47:50,044
They're Statler and Waldorf.

1744
01:47:50,204 --> 01:47:54,764
I'll throw out a couple more quick takes on why I think this has better repeat value

1745
01:47:54,764 --> 01:47:57,004
than something like Honey, I Shrunk the Audience.

1746
01:47:57,164 --> 01:48:01,884
A, I think it's one of the few, if only, theme park movies,

1747
01:48:01,884 --> 01:48:03,844
won't include live shows, right?

1748
01:48:04,104 --> 01:48:06,804
Theme park movies that has an emotional arc.

1749
01:48:07,804 --> 01:48:10,964
I'm not saying it's more in peace, but the Bean Bunny thing,

1750
01:48:11,144 --> 01:48:14,124
you actually kind of get the stakes of what this guy is trying to prove.

1751
01:48:14,584 --> 01:48:20,084
They set up the sort of pressure of mounting the show, the big finale, the tribute to America.

1752
01:48:20,984 --> 01:48:21,984
And you know what?

1753
01:48:22,844 --> 01:48:25,684
All reshoots, all post-Jim.

1754
01:48:25,944 --> 01:48:26,724
Interesting.

1755
01:48:26,924 --> 01:48:29,484
And Frank Oz took over as director.

1756
01:48:29,484 --> 01:48:29,844
Wow.

1757
01:48:29,844 --> 01:48:34,704
Yeah, that was all like, so everything in the black void is reshoots.

1758
01:48:34,804 --> 01:48:35,224
Really?

1759
01:48:35,244 --> 01:48:36,744
And that stuff's all super fucking good.

1760
01:48:37,944 --> 01:48:38,204
Really good.

1761
01:48:38,604 --> 01:48:43,204
Another thing is, I think it's some of the best application of 3D technology I've ever seen.

1762
01:48:43,344 --> 01:48:48,124
I think it's still, that first gag where the logo comes out of the door is one of those,

1763
01:48:48,364 --> 01:48:50,904
oh, it actually feels like it's invading my space.

1764
01:48:51,024 --> 01:48:51,344
Yeah.

1765
01:48:51,684 --> 01:48:56,084
And the joke of it being a cheap gag and that you're supposed to buy it,

1766
01:48:56,084 --> 01:48:58,764
you're supposed to be like, oh, I'm seeing an impressive 3D movie,

1767
01:48:58,764 --> 01:49:02,144
and then it's just a guy with a stick, but the guy with a stick looks really good too.

1768
01:49:02,144 --> 01:49:02,584
Really good.

1769
01:49:02,584 --> 01:49:04,324
It's really impressive when it turns.

1770
01:49:04,444 --> 01:49:06,524
The flying pie still looks good.

1771
01:49:06,544 --> 01:49:06,904
Oh yeah, yeah.

1772
01:49:06,924 --> 01:49:08,824
Even on like a YouTube rip, that still looks good.

1773
01:49:08,884 --> 01:49:13,544
And again, a great one-two punch where the pie hits Fozzie in the face and Kermit says,

1774
01:49:13,624 --> 01:49:14,704
Fozzie, that's terrible.

1775
01:49:14,844 --> 01:49:17,044
And Fozzie goes, you're right, it needs more sugar.

1776
01:49:17,664 --> 01:49:20,284
Funny and for everybody.

1777
01:49:20,284 --> 01:49:25,364
I also don't know how they do the pie exactly because it seems like it's CGI,

1778
01:49:25,364 --> 01:49:29,604
and then at some point in an invisible cut becomes a physical pie

1779
01:49:29,604 --> 01:49:32,204
so that frosting can be on Fozzie's face.

1780
01:49:32,344 --> 01:49:36,764
And I don't, there's some weird little pops, something happens that you sense there's a cut,

1781
01:49:36,964 --> 01:49:39,544
but I don't really know how they bridge that gap from computer to real.

1782
01:49:39,544 --> 01:49:40,924
I was trying to figure that out too.

1783
01:49:40,924 --> 01:49:42,444
Yeah, you can't really tell.

1784
01:49:42,464 --> 01:49:43,644
It still looks great.

1785
01:49:44,104 --> 01:49:44,984
It's pretty seamless.

1786
01:49:45,084 --> 01:49:49,184
And I also feel like when I was, I used to watch, what was it called?

1787
01:49:49,264 --> 01:49:52,044
Inside Disney, the show that was on the Disney Channel.

1788
01:49:52,064 --> 01:49:53,384
Disney World Inside Out.

1789
01:49:54,064 --> 01:49:55,044
Yes, was that what it was called?

1790
01:49:56,384 --> 01:49:57,824
Probably both titles were shows.

1791
01:49:57,964 --> 01:50:01,004
Right, it was that show that George Foreman was like a correspondent on.

1792
01:50:01,004 --> 01:50:02,464
That's Walt Disney World Inside Out.

1793
01:50:02,464 --> 01:50:04,724
Right, okay, so I used to watch that obsessively,

1794
01:50:04,744 --> 01:50:06,564
begging my parents to bring me to the park.

1795
01:50:06,744 --> 01:50:12,184
So I was like, I kind of had every ride spoiled for me by that show before going on it.

1796
01:50:12,224 --> 01:50:16,444
So by the time I finally got to go to Disney World, it felt like sort of like

1797
01:50:16,444 --> 01:50:19,724
seeing my favorite band in concert and demanding they play the hits.

1798
01:50:20,444 --> 01:50:24,024
But I remember Muppet Vision was one of the few things where I was like,

1799
01:50:24,024 --> 01:50:26,324
I don't feel like I've seen all of this.

1800
01:50:26,644 --> 01:50:30,444
Yeah, they did not exhaust, you maybe knew about the pie,

1801
01:50:30,784 --> 01:50:33,424
or you maybe saw, we surrender, we surrender.

1802
01:50:33,744 --> 01:50:37,004
It's got a pretty healthy length to it too.

1803
01:50:37,244 --> 01:50:38,964
I think it's a get a real show there.

1804
01:50:39,164 --> 01:50:47,264
I had no sense going, I know that never was spoiled for me, the salute to America.

1805
01:50:47,444 --> 01:50:49,924
Or what's the name of it to say the real thing?

1806
01:50:50,984 --> 01:50:53,024
A salute to all nations, but mostly America.

1807
01:50:53,024 --> 01:50:54,104
Which is a good joke.

1808
01:50:54,424 --> 01:50:59,064
I have a whole section of my notes just labeled Sam the Eagle.

1809
01:50:59,224 --> 01:51:01,284
Sam the Eagle I think is the MVP of this.

1810
01:51:01,284 --> 01:51:02,444
He's a killer in this.

1811
01:51:02,664 --> 01:51:07,964
All those, and it's all, that's all that 70s Muppet subversion where it's kind of

1812
01:51:07,964 --> 01:51:09,784
Goofing on Superlism.

1813
01:51:10,404 --> 01:51:11,284
Exactly, exactly.

1814
01:51:11,284 --> 01:51:14,744
If they had a show on the air right now with a good writers,

1815
01:51:14,844 --> 01:51:17,384
I'm could imagine the stuff they'd be doing with Sam the Eagle.

1816
01:51:18,164 --> 01:51:20,584
Yeah, maybe a good conduit actually.

1817
01:51:20,604 --> 01:51:21,064
You need Sam the Eagle.

1818
01:51:21,584 --> 01:51:24,404
That's picking up merch, there he is up there on Mike.

1819
01:51:24,424 --> 01:51:33,004
It's not, it's from this really good line of toys, Muppet toys made by a company called Palisades.

1820
01:51:33,124 --> 01:51:34,764
Can I throw out something super nerdy?

1821
01:51:35,224 --> 01:51:37,924
I was so active on the Palisades message board.

1822
01:51:37,924 --> 01:51:38,884
Oh wow, really?

1823
01:51:38,904 --> 01:51:41,904
I am listed as a special thing, so I'm one of the packages.

1824
01:51:42,344 --> 01:51:43,044
Which one?

1825
01:51:43,704 --> 01:51:47,144
Wow, I believe it's the Pigs in Space play sets.

1826
01:51:47,744 --> 01:51:48,564
Oh really?

1827
01:51:48,764 --> 01:51:49,044
Yeah.

1828
01:51:49,084 --> 01:51:50,924
Do you own them or do you just, you were just

1829
01:51:51,084 --> 01:51:52,964
You got all the Puppets, Palisades?

1830
01:51:53,304 --> 01:51:53,504
Oh yeah.

1831
01:51:53,504 --> 01:51:54,684
They're incredible toys.

1832
01:51:54,864 --> 01:51:55,804
Incredible, unbelievable.

1833
01:51:56,164 --> 01:51:59,844
It's taken all my willpower to not, because that's the only one I have,

1834
01:52:00,384 --> 01:52:04,564
but I have a lot of other things upstairs from, but like it's, they're so good.

1835
01:52:04,624 --> 01:52:06,184
They're incredibly good, yeah.

1836
01:52:06,204 --> 01:52:10,864
And that company, they had like a very active message board and they would like solicit fan

1837
01:52:10,864 --> 01:52:13,744
sort of feedback on things and try to gauge which things.

1838
01:52:13,744 --> 01:52:20,904
Wow, that's wild. You really have thrown it down in the ring here of your credibility when you

1839
01:52:20,984 --> 01:52:22,124
message board poster.

1840
01:52:22,324 --> 01:52:24,764
That comes up on your Ang Lee Hulk episode.

1841
01:52:24,884 --> 01:52:28,664
Your co-host is giving you grief because you mentioned like, well on the

1842
01:52:28,664 --> 01:52:31,184
action figure message boards I frequent.

1843
01:52:31,224 --> 01:52:32,724
Yes, yes, right.

1844
01:52:32,844 --> 01:52:35,424
Which he thought is like the nerdiest pull I could have.

1845
01:52:35,504 --> 01:52:39,224
Not that I'm thanked on the package of an action figure when I'm 14,

1846
01:52:39,524 --> 01:52:42,504
because I want to spend more time in that message room than parties.

1847
01:52:42,564 --> 01:52:45,764
But I was listening to that episode, it's like get to the Pearl Mother stuff,

1848
01:52:45,864 --> 01:52:50,344
get to the Pearl Mother, like the Toy Biz Pearl Mother Marvel, like so much of this stuff.

1849
01:52:50,344 --> 01:52:56,524
Well we got into it also with, weirdly with, we did a Batman, an 89 Batman episode recently,

1850
01:52:57,064 --> 01:53:01,804
which Toy Biz had their rights to the original Batman and that sort of gives them the cachet

1851
01:53:01,804 --> 01:53:03,844
to make the play for the Marvel deal.

1852
01:53:04,284 --> 01:53:10,224
So it's like Batman not succeeding would have led to Marvel going under weirdly.

1853
01:53:10,624 --> 01:53:12,304
Oh my god, poor Michael Jackson bike.

1854
01:53:12,744 --> 01:53:14,864
Yeah, wow.

1855
01:53:15,144 --> 01:53:15,704
Wow.

1856
01:53:16,044 --> 01:53:18,604
Where was it?

1857
01:53:19,664 --> 01:53:24,824
Salute to all nations, we were talking about surprises in the movie and I really love that

1858
01:53:24,824 --> 01:53:32,264
that's just its own odd thing that the characters play into, but that isn't really, you know,

1859
01:53:32,384 --> 01:53:37,584
it's not like we have to make the finale some like recognized, they all sing Rainbow

1860
01:53:37,584 --> 01:53:39,324
Connection or something we've seen before.

1861
01:53:39,344 --> 01:53:39,644
Yeah.

1862
01:53:39,904 --> 01:53:44,044
It's really its own thing and I love those vacant dumb dolls.

1863
01:53:44,884 --> 01:53:46,184
A small world comedy.

1864
01:53:46,384 --> 01:53:50,104
It feels like a small world parody, which is another little snarky thing that's fun.

1865
01:53:50,464 --> 01:53:56,224
And I also like that, you know, if Sam the Eagle is a commentary on nationalism,

1866
01:53:56,964 --> 01:54:02,124
that it feels, and he's the only one taking this seriously, I need to make a really important

1867
01:54:02,124 --> 01:54:08,324
little number at the end of the show and he roped in these clearly dumber muppets to help him.

1868
01:54:08,344 --> 01:54:13,324
Like where did he find all these dummies to march around and dress as colonial people?

1869
01:54:13,324 --> 01:54:13,724
Right.

1870
01:54:14,044 --> 01:54:19,704
He got the most brainless idiots to follow him, which also feels like a fun little subversive

1871
01:54:19,704 --> 01:54:20,244
message or something.

1872
01:54:20,244 --> 01:54:24,244
But that's a good point that it's not a greatest hits compilation, you know?

1873
01:54:24,824 --> 01:54:29,144
Something like Honey I Shrunk the Audience, which is like so first and foremost kind of

1874
01:54:29,144 --> 01:54:32,364
like a skill show of all the effects they can use.

1875
01:54:33,144 --> 01:54:37,164
They feel pretty well integrated into this because they're the muppets, they can call

1876
01:54:37,164 --> 01:54:44,024
out the fact that it's like a theme park attraction, that it's gimmicky, but it's also like they're

1877
01:54:44,024 --> 01:54:45,184
like a commentary content.

1878
01:54:45,424 --> 01:54:50,684
It's not just Rainbow Connection in 3D, it's not the same routines, you get a little muppet

1879
01:54:50,684 --> 01:54:54,164
labs, like they're hitting all the basics but giving you new spins on them.

1880
01:54:54,164 --> 01:54:56,704
Right, and you can't get it anywhere else.

1881
01:54:56,704 --> 01:55:02,584
No, and in fact, you always see like Kermit on the firetruck at the end, you are looking

1882
01:55:02,584 --> 01:55:05,224
at 1990 MGM Studios.

1883
01:55:05,424 --> 01:55:09,004
And another really good 3D effect when he comes towards you with the ladder, feels like

1884
01:55:09,004 --> 01:55:09,784
he's there with you.

1885
01:55:09,784 --> 01:55:15,104
That must be a robot or something, that has to be like a mechanized version of Kermit.

1886
01:55:15,984 --> 01:55:24,644
Another thing I want to say, I love the sets in this thing, that main, that like Victorian

1887
01:55:24,644 --> 01:55:29,744
atrium where this takes place, why is it, why does it look like that?

1888
01:55:29,824 --> 01:55:35,464
I love that it does, I love that they're not in, in keeping with how much I love the building

1889
01:55:35,464 --> 01:55:39,864
itself where the thing takes place, I like that they're not in some like, you know, some

1890
01:55:39,864 --> 01:55:41,264
goofy kind of digital world.

1891
01:55:41,264 --> 01:55:46,064
They're in that long, long hallway which gives you the depth and that's another thing about

1892
01:55:46,064 --> 01:55:46,204
it.

1893
01:55:46,204 --> 01:55:54,364
I think there's good 3D movies that are full of, you know, CGI and maybe shot digitally,

1894
01:55:54,484 --> 01:55:59,464
I don't mean to count out that that stuff can be good but this is, I looked it up, 65

1895
01:55:59,464 --> 01:56:06,804
millimeter and it's, it is like a beautiful analog film on beautiful real sets with

1896
01:56:06,804 --> 01:56:09,204
amazingly crafted real puppets.

1897
01:56:09,264 --> 01:56:11,384
It's very real and cool.

1898
01:56:11,644 --> 01:56:18,884
I'll say another real nerdy deep cut with regards to the sets, the Palisades Muppet

1899
01:56:18,884 --> 01:56:24,744
Labs playset is based off the Muppet Vision Muppet Labs because the Muppet Labs on the

1900
01:56:24,744 --> 01:56:29,064
show is very generic looking and they were like, everyone has this memory of Muppet Labs

1901
01:56:29,064 --> 01:56:32,304
because those segments were so good but the only one that was kind of visually compelling

1902
01:56:32,304 --> 01:56:37,344
on its own, it's that weird sort of like, it looks kind of like H.G. Welles-y.

1903
01:56:37,884 --> 01:56:44,444
Yeah, and Beaker really takes a beating on that, like weird river, water wheel sort of

1904
01:56:44,444 --> 01:56:44,784
mechanic.

1905
01:56:44,844 --> 01:56:45,384
Huge labs.

1906
01:56:46,024 --> 01:56:46,504
Huge labs.

1907
01:56:46,544 --> 01:56:47,484
It goes over so well.

1908
01:56:47,484 --> 01:56:48,004
So funny.

1909
01:56:48,164 --> 01:56:49,064
Do you have that playset?

1910
01:56:49,184 --> 01:56:50,104
I do, most definitely.

1911
01:56:50,104 --> 01:56:51,484
Do you have all of the toys?

1912
01:56:51,824 --> 01:56:53,684
I don't have all of them, I'd say I have a majority.

1913
01:56:54,264 --> 01:56:55,004
80%?

1914
01:56:56,004 --> 01:56:57,584
This is what's depressing.

1915
01:56:57,664 --> 01:57:02,264
I would say I had 80% at one point and now I probably have closer to 60%.

1916
01:57:02,264 --> 01:57:04,164
And there are a few things I gave up that I really regret.

1917
01:57:04,184 --> 01:57:09,244
That's harder to have like toys in New York with much smaller, you know, apartments and all.

1918
01:57:09,264 --> 01:57:09,964
Very true.

1919
01:57:10,244 --> 01:57:13,664
Do you have the Jim Henson Palisades toy?

1920
01:57:13,664 --> 01:57:15,464
I don't and that's a big regret.

1921
01:57:15,464 --> 01:57:16,924
It's very expensive now.

1922
01:57:17,204 --> 01:57:17,544
Of him?

1923
01:57:17,684 --> 01:57:21,244
There's a Jim Henson toy that Palisades made who I don't know how you got it, I don't know

1924
01:57:21,244 --> 01:57:22,384
if it was commercially sold.

1925
01:57:22,464 --> 01:57:23,564
I believe it was the Collector's Club.

1926
01:57:23,724 --> 01:57:24,804
I believe it was one that they all belong on.

1927
01:57:24,804 --> 01:57:29,264
You had to join and then yeah, there's a kind of cartoonish Jim Henson.

1928
01:57:29,264 --> 01:57:31,004
It's really cool looking.

1929
01:57:31,004 --> 01:57:34,624
This is a precedent for the Michael Eisner merch that we're talking about.

1930
01:57:34,644 --> 01:57:35,724
We were talking about it.

1931
01:57:35,844 --> 01:57:38,744
A couple weeks ago, how they should start making Michael Eisner merch.

1932
01:57:39,084 --> 01:57:42,144
Here's a question for you guys because I feel like you bring up a lot

1933
01:57:42,144 --> 01:57:47,164
how creepy Eisner was in this time period when he would do on camera stuff.

1934
01:57:47,244 --> 01:57:52,484
Would you insist on being like the Uncle Walt introductions hosting the specials and all of that?

1935
01:57:52,544 --> 01:57:57,024
I wouldn't say creepy as much as just yeah, like kind of so yeah.

1936
01:57:57,804 --> 01:58:02,044
When you were younger, did you feel like Eisner was working for you?

1937
01:58:02,084 --> 01:58:06,584
Because I remember I would watch Eisner present like Wonderful World of Disney and be like

1938
01:58:06,584 --> 01:58:07,724
it's Michael Eisner.

1939
01:58:08,084 --> 01:58:11,424
He's the magician himself, the man with the keys to Disney.

1940
01:58:11,684 --> 01:58:13,564
And my dad would come into the room and go,

1941
01:58:13,844 --> 01:58:17,684
God, can you believe Michael Eisner keeps on wedging himself in front of the camera?

1942
01:58:17,984 --> 01:58:18,824
And I'd be like, what are you talking about?

1943
01:58:18,904 --> 01:58:20,524
He's Michael Eisner.

1944
01:58:20,524 --> 01:58:22,984
I am completely on your side of things.

1945
01:58:22,984 --> 01:58:24,324
That's absolutely how I felt.

1946
01:58:24,384 --> 01:58:25,084
He's magical.

1947
01:58:25,224 --> 01:58:30,224
And have I really declared on the show before that I literally there was a time where if you

1948
01:58:30,224 --> 01:58:33,704
asked me in like a school report or if somebody asked what do you want to be when you grew up

1949
01:58:33,704 --> 01:58:35,744
and when I was probably this is probably like eight, nine years old.

1950
01:58:35,764 --> 01:58:38,824
My answer was I want to be the CEO of the Walt Disney Company.

1951
01:58:38,844 --> 01:58:39,004
Really?

1952
01:58:39,164 --> 01:58:39,404
Great answer.

1953
01:58:39,804 --> 01:58:40,024
Great answer.

1954
01:58:40,024 --> 01:58:44,524
I'm sure I could show you some report I filled out where I'm like, I'm going to be the next Eisner.

1955
01:58:44,584 --> 01:58:47,624
I said like, I'm going to be an animator for Disney.

1956
01:58:47,664 --> 01:58:49,104
That was like the Disney answer.

1957
01:58:49,104 --> 01:58:52,924
I might have been my answer at one point, but there was some window where it was.

1958
01:58:52,924 --> 01:58:53,204
It was.

1959
01:58:53,404 --> 01:58:56,864
I wanted to work in the team Disney building with the dwarves.

1960
01:58:57,284 --> 01:59:02,244
I don't think I don't think at the time I could have articulated that I had affection for him.

1961
01:59:02,244 --> 01:59:05,304
I don't think that that was ever.

1962
01:59:05,764 --> 01:59:10,004
About articulating affection now for anyone.

1963
01:59:10,024 --> 01:59:10,724
That's fair.

1964
01:59:10,884 --> 01:59:16,684
But I'm just saying at least I can maybe recognize it, but I do have it and I know now.

1965
01:59:16,744 --> 01:59:17,124
Yeah.

1966
01:59:17,124 --> 01:59:20,404
But I couldn't I wouldn't have said ever like, oh, I love that Michael.

1967
01:59:20,444 --> 01:59:21,644
Oh, Michael Eisner is cool.

1968
01:59:21,724 --> 01:59:23,124
I would have never said that.

1969
01:59:23,124 --> 01:59:26,264
Because we've all heard stories about Walt being prickly.

1970
01:59:26,264 --> 01:59:29,864
But when you watch him host and stuff appearing on camera, you're like, yeah,

1971
01:59:29,864 --> 01:59:31,724
you did project a good formative warmth.

1972
01:59:31,924 --> 01:59:32,144
Yes.

1973
01:59:32,364 --> 01:59:37,044
My parents like we I think we all agreed like, oh, Sunday night, got to watch the wonderful world

1974
01:59:37,044 --> 01:59:37,484
at Disney.

1975
01:59:37,484 --> 01:59:42,984
And there's of course, Michael's here and they could say this week's movie is very special to me.

1976
01:59:42,984 --> 01:59:46,824
And I just kind of moving rigidly with his ruddy face.

1977
01:59:47,464 --> 01:59:51,204
Anything where he's reacting to something unusual happening.

1978
01:59:51,204 --> 01:59:52,924
Goofy, what are you doing?

1979
01:59:53,604 --> 01:59:55,924
He seems genuinely upset.

1980
01:59:55,944 --> 01:59:56,684
Hollywood.

1981
01:59:57,024 --> 01:59:57,924
I'm messing my office.

1982
01:59:57,924 --> 02:00:00,564
It was a gem of the 1930s.

1983
02:00:00,884 --> 02:00:03,404
I walked past him on the street once.

1984
02:00:03,404 --> 02:00:05,704
I'd say maybe about seven or eight years ago.

1985
02:00:06,124 --> 02:00:11,384
I was walking with my mom near Central Park and she said, Griffin, do you see who that is?

1986
02:00:11,404 --> 02:00:14,224
Because she knew how much I idolized him when I was a child.

1987
02:00:14,224 --> 02:00:17,944
And I went, no, who is that angry, monstrous looking man?

1988
02:00:18,544 --> 02:00:20,164
And she said, that's Michael Eisner.

1989
02:00:20,184 --> 02:00:21,484
And I couldn't believe it.

1990
02:00:21,504 --> 02:00:23,624
And he was a show tall.

1991
02:00:23,784 --> 02:00:24,244
Yes.

1992
02:00:24,264 --> 02:00:24,444
Yeah.

1993
02:00:24,444 --> 02:00:24,704
Yes.

1994
02:00:24,704 --> 02:00:26,284
Really, really tall.

1995
02:00:26,284 --> 02:00:34,024
And B just looked kind of like he was like muttering to himself wearing like a clean suit.

1996
02:00:34,164 --> 02:00:36,444
But he looked kind of like red faced and angry.

1997
02:00:36,704 --> 02:00:38,624
I don't think it's out of the question that way.

1998
02:00:38,624 --> 02:00:40,484
He's on the podcast by the end of 2019.

1999
02:00:40,644 --> 02:00:42,464
I mean, we would we would like that.

2000
02:00:42,484 --> 02:00:42,924
Let's try.

2001
02:00:43,144 --> 02:00:43,744
We got to try.

2002
02:00:44,104 --> 02:00:45,944
I don't think it's out of the realm of possibilities.

2003
02:00:45,964 --> 02:00:47,104
It'll be so nice.

2004
02:00:47,244 --> 02:00:51,024
It'll be the easy, the most like just gushing thing he's ever been a part of.

2005
02:00:51,024 --> 02:00:52,284
And any little dirt.

2006
02:00:52,444 --> 02:00:55,704
I mean, if he gives a speck of dirt, we'll just lose our minds.

2007
02:00:56,024 --> 02:01:00,384
Don't you think at this point he would be so appreciative of people who had nostalgia

2008
02:01:00,384 --> 02:01:03,324
for when he was introducing TV movies?

2009
02:01:03,324 --> 02:01:03,804
I would think so.

2010
02:01:03,804 --> 02:01:04,844
I think so.

2011
02:01:05,004 --> 02:01:08,864
Because I mean, I think about like I was saying, like my parents probably,

2012
02:01:08,864 --> 02:01:11,904
I believe also liked him because they were old enough.

2013
02:01:12,084 --> 02:01:12,384
Right.

2014
02:01:12,384 --> 02:01:16,704
That they grew up with the wonderful world at Disney when Walt was introducing stuff.

2015
02:01:16,764 --> 02:01:19,544
So it's like, oh, now Michael's the head of the company and he does that.

2016
02:01:20,084 --> 02:01:25,064
We'll do a whole PowerPoint presentation for him on different merch that he would approve

2017
02:01:25,064 --> 02:01:30,024
of himself, maybe like we would just be like, how do you think about this doll of you?

2018
02:01:30,024 --> 02:01:33,264
I mean, he should have a vinyl nation at least.

2019
02:01:34,744 --> 02:01:35,784
At the very least.

2020
02:01:35,824 --> 02:01:41,104
But I think I said it should be like a hundred dollar figure, a hundred dollar like.

2021
02:01:41,624 --> 02:01:42,784
Oswald over there.

2022
02:01:42,964 --> 02:01:49,204
If we put you on a T-shirt and we can bulk order from T-public, would you come back and sign

2023
02:01:49,204 --> 02:01:50,064
like the show?

2024
02:01:50,344 --> 02:01:51,764
Well, we're going to sell as merch.

2025
02:01:52,184 --> 02:01:57,264
That you on the podcast, the ride T-public page will become the exclusive.

2026
02:01:57,264 --> 02:01:57,644
Yeah.

2027
02:01:58,084 --> 02:01:58,944
License source.

2028
02:01:59,344 --> 02:02:00,004
I mean, the licensing.

2029
02:02:00,344 --> 02:02:06,204
You should sign a deal with him and say, we want to be, we want to have the exclusive rights to

2030
02:02:06,204 --> 02:02:06,704
Eisner.

2031
02:02:07,004 --> 02:02:09,004
Eisner and Marvel McFay.

2032
02:02:09,324 --> 02:02:09,804
Forgottable.

2033
02:02:09,804 --> 02:02:10,204
Six.

2034
02:02:10,504 --> 02:02:11,764
They're sitting around.

2035
02:02:11,784 --> 02:02:12,404
Give it to us.

2036
02:02:12,524 --> 02:02:16,204
By the end of 2019, I think we should also declare that we will retain the right.

2037
02:02:16,224 --> 02:02:22,164
We will find a way to buy the rights to Astroworld's Marvel McFay and his animal.

2038
02:02:22,584 --> 02:02:24,884
Yeah, that feels like there's some meat on that bone.

2039
02:02:25,024 --> 02:02:27,844
I mean, I think you could really flip that and make a profit on that.

2040
02:02:28,124 --> 02:02:32,444
I also think that with the battle, there would just be tracking down who has the rights.

2041
02:02:32,784 --> 02:02:33,344
I keep.

2042
02:02:33,584 --> 02:02:34,304
It's persistence.

2043
02:02:34,524 --> 02:02:36,264
I have so many notes to myself of stuff to do.

2044
02:02:36,364 --> 02:02:38,224
It's like, find who owns Marvel McFay.

2045
02:02:38,504 --> 02:02:39,184
Can I ask?

2046
02:02:39,184 --> 02:02:40,464
Which has to be Six Flags.

2047
02:02:40,604 --> 02:02:42,164
It has to be Warner Brothers, honestly.

2048
02:02:42,344 --> 02:02:45,324
But it's probably so buried in like a deep file.

2049
02:02:45,564 --> 02:02:53,204
I mean, there's this thing not to bring it back around to a self-serving thing, but Ben

2050
02:02:53,204 --> 02:02:57,544
Edlin, who created The Tick, which was like an independent comic book published by his

2051
02:02:57,544 --> 02:03:02,464
local comic book store, he retained the key rights to the characters, but then did the cartoon show

2052
02:03:02,464 --> 02:03:08,844
Fox Kids and they retained anything that was created first in the cartoon show.

2053
02:03:08,864 --> 02:03:15,044
So a lot of supporting cast, not taking Arthur, but a lot of supporting villains and heroes

2054
02:03:15,044 --> 02:03:18,104
Fox Kids owned, which then Disney bought.

2055
02:03:18,864 --> 02:03:22,444
So Disney has all these supporting characters.

2056
02:03:22,444 --> 02:03:27,564
When we do like conventions and stuff and people are like, hey, any chance of this?

2057
02:03:27,644 --> 02:03:33,364
And the answer is like it's somewhere in a file at Disney and they can't be bothered to get on the

2058
02:03:33,364 --> 02:03:35,284
phone to agree to a deal.

2059
02:03:35,744 --> 02:03:35,804
Right.

2060
02:03:35,804 --> 02:03:36,924
It's not worth it to them.

2061
02:03:37,204 --> 02:03:38,144
Chairface Chippendale.

2062
02:03:38,484 --> 02:03:40,984
Chairface is still, is in the comic first.

2063
02:03:41,124 --> 02:03:41,324
Okay.

2064
02:03:41,364 --> 02:03:41,944
That's what I thought.

2065
02:03:42,084 --> 02:03:42,364
Yeah.

2066
02:03:42,384 --> 02:03:43,424
Chairface is in the comic first.

2067
02:03:43,424 --> 02:03:48,084
This is the case with a lot of stuff, like maybe not a lot, but like Ninja Turtles, for instance,

2068
02:03:48,144 --> 02:03:53,884
there was an Archie comic series that I loved and they made up some of those characters are

2069
02:03:53,964 --> 02:03:58,784
kind of just floating in owned by Archie maybe still because they've now been in an

2070
02:03:58,784 --> 02:04:00,684
into like it's these weird limos.

2071
02:04:00,684 --> 02:04:01,644
They're never going to use them.

2072
02:04:01,664 --> 02:04:06,404
Disney is not going to do anything with like American Maid or Dinosaur Neil.

2073
02:04:06,864 --> 02:04:10,344
There's no interest there.

2074
02:04:10,464 --> 02:04:10,644
I don't know.

2075
02:04:10,664 --> 02:04:12,964
We should roll into Disney Plus and see if we can get a spin off.

2076
02:04:12,964 --> 02:04:14,164
Dinosaur Neil show.

2077
02:04:14,184 --> 02:04:18,484
I have wondered like, yeah, why haven't any of the live actions had American Maid?

2078
02:04:18,604 --> 02:04:19,584
You had such a cool costume.

2079
02:04:20,444 --> 02:04:21,024
Right.

2080
02:04:21,604 --> 02:04:29,324
Because Captain Liberty and Batman Well were both workarounds for Fox Kids having the rights.

2081
02:04:30,384 --> 02:04:31,744
Oh, it sucks.

2082
02:04:31,904 --> 02:04:33,144
And then Disney by proxy.

2083
02:04:34,144 --> 02:04:36,864
Everyone needs to wake up and realize what they have.

2084
02:04:37,404 --> 02:04:37,464
Marvel.

2085
02:04:37,464 --> 02:04:43,284
Marvel McFay might be like owned by someone who died and their like niece never went into their.

2086
02:04:43,604 --> 02:04:45,424
It's just in a safe deposit box.

2087
02:04:45,644 --> 02:04:47,024
They might be lost to the ages.

2088
02:04:48,504 --> 02:04:49,544
I'm all right.

2089
02:04:49,564 --> 02:04:52,124
So that means Disney must own Eek the Cat, right?

2090
02:04:52,284 --> 02:04:53,444
Can I get the cat?

2091
02:04:53,584 --> 02:04:55,044
I think Disney has Eek the Cat.

2092
02:04:55,364 --> 02:04:56,584
Oh yeah, Eek the Cat.

2093
02:04:56,804 --> 02:04:59,864
Who owns Louie Anderson as a child?

2094
02:05:00,844 --> 02:05:00,864
Disney.

2095
02:05:01,204 --> 02:05:02,104
I think it's Disney.

2096
02:05:02,564 --> 02:05:03,584
It's not Louie himself.

2097
02:05:03,904 --> 02:05:04,664
It's not the actual child.

2098
02:05:04,724 --> 02:05:08,304
Louie does not own the image of his father.

2099
02:05:08,464 --> 02:05:11,604
Louie Anderson does not own the image of his father as a cartoon.

2100
02:05:11,724 --> 02:05:15,264
Disney owns the first nine years of Louie Anderson's life.

2101
02:05:15,324 --> 02:05:16,924
They own his memories.

2102
02:05:16,924 --> 02:05:20,184
He can't reference them on a podcast without flipping them a check.

2103
02:05:20,364 --> 02:05:23,584
If he goes through an old photo album, yeah, technically he has to.

2104
02:05:23,584 --> 02:05:24,844
They get residuals.

2105
02:05:25,024 --> 02:05:30,344
We're over the two hour mark.

2106
02:05:30,344 --> 02:05:32,604
Let me get to a couple of things.

2107
02:05:32,924 --> 02:05:38,044
One really thing that really depressed me when I read it and I didn't realize it.

2108
02:05:38,224 --> 02:05:45,564
2004 Disney takes Jim Henson's name off of the show because they bought the Muppets.

2109
02:05:45,564 --> 02:05:45,984
Wow.

2110
02:05:46,504 --> 02:05:49,084
They don't have to do the license.

2111
02:05:50,264 --> 02:05:51,584
Let's say all this.

2112
02:05:54,124 --> 02:05:58,004
Muppet Vision 3D was made in a period where Disney was trying to buy the Muppets.

2113
02:05:58,304 --> 02:05:59,064
Jim Henson died.

2114
02:05:59,144 --> 02:06:00,084
The deal went bust.

2115
02:06:00,144 --> 02:06:01,924
They did it as a license thing.

2116
02:06:02,264 --> 02:06:07,364
Even then, there was a strong possibility that the movie would not even be put into the parks.

2117
02:06:07,424 --> 02:06:10,124
The family was so sour on Disney by that point.

2118
02:06:10,844 --> 02:06:12,524
Frank Oz was a person among other people.

2119
02:06:13,604 --> 02:06:16,444
The public deserves to see the last thing Jim made.

2120
02:06:16,944 --> 02:06:19,644
That was the emotional trump card that got it into the parks.

2121
02:06:19,964 --> 02:06:21,324
Yeah, they had to pay a license thing.

2122
02:06:21,444 --> 02:06:24,484
By the time they bought it, then screw this.

2123
02:06:24,824 --> 02:06:29,484
It's like if Pixar doesn't need to be up here anymore if the deal, the license deal went away.

2124
02:06:29,644 --> 02:06:35,664
The main reason I was reading Jim Hill in high school was I was so interested in he

2125
02:06:35,664 --> 02:06:40,864
was the only guy writing about the business dealings of the Muppets and Pixar.

2126
02:06:40,864 --> 02:06:42,944
It was that more than the theme park stuff.

2127
02:06:43,104 --> 02:06:47,284
Before that, I had never been a like imagineering rumor guy.

2128
02:06:47,384 --> 02:06:48,604
I liked the parks.

2129
02:06:49,144 --> 02:06:52,324
And then through trying to track what is Disney doing with the Muppets,

2130
02:06:52,364 --> 02:06:55,184
I started getting keyed into all of that stuff.

2131
02:06:56,044 --> 02:07:03,504
But it was like the last thing Eisner did when he was already on the way out of the company.

2132
02:07:04,004 --> 02:07:07,664
They had negotiated his payout and his exit.

2133
02:07:08,004 --> 02:07:10,144
He bought the Muppets.

2134
02:07:10,204 --> 02:07:16,584
And it kind of felt like it was a vindictive thing to be like that was my waterloo.

2135
02:07:16,644 --> 02:07:19,724
That was the one I could never, the Moby Dick I couldn't catch.

2136
02:07:20,004 --> 02:07:24,864
And then he saddled Disney with the Muppets and Disney was like we wouldn't have money.

2137
02:07:25,144 --> 02:07:26,864
We don't know what to do with them.

2138
02:07:26,904 --> 02:07:31,544
Now we're stuck with this expensive purchase because Eisner wanted to stick it to somebody.

2139
02:07:32,184 --> 02:07:33,124
To dead Jim Henson.

2140
02:07:33,264 --> 02:07:35,324
They'll be back on Disney Plus.

2141
02:07:35,664 --> 02:07:37,164
Like it's all hands on deck.

2142
02:07:37,164 --> 02:07:38,804
That's everything they've said sort of.

2143
02:07:38,824 --> 02:07:44,684
But that's that weird sort of that period when, well what?

2144
02:07:44,824 --> 02:07:52,084
I mean I guess do they buy the Muppets after the California Adventure Outpost opens?

2145
02:07:52,724 --> 02:07:52,784
Yes.

2146
02:07:53,164 --> 02:07:54,104
Because it's 2004.

2147
02:07:55,104 --> 02:07:56,784
Yeah so 2001 is the opening.

2148
02:07:56,944 --> 02:08:01,044
Right but then there was a long period where they just weren't doing anything with them.

2149
02:08:01,524 --> 02:08:02,404
No one had an idea.

2150
02:08:02,404 --> 02:08:04,024
It wasn't like get them so we can do this.

2151
02:08:04,204 --> 02:08:07,844
No they did Muppet Wizard of Oz for Wonderful World of Disney.

2152
02:08:07,844 --> 02:08:09,704
And they did like one Christmas special.

2153
02:08:09,704 --> 02:08:11,544
That thing with Quentin Tarantino.

2154
02:08:11,804 --> 02:08:14,164
Oh yeah.

2155
02:08:14,764 --> 02:08:15,944
He has an actor in it.

2156
02:08:16,364 --> 02:08:18,124
There's a good talk show appearance.

2157
02:08:18,144 --> 02:08:19,344
You won't believe who he plays.

2158
02:08:19,664 --> 02:08:20,324
Oh boy.

2159
02:08:20,344 --> 02:08:21,384
Take one guess.

2160
02:08:21,884 --> 02:08:23,864
I don't know the world of it.

2161
02:08:24,424 --> 02:08:27,624
As he says somebody's dad, he's Gonzo's dad.

2162
02:08:27,684 --> 02:08:29,264
Quentin Tarantino.

2163
02:08:29,744 --> 02:08:32,324
He pulls out a sword, pulls out a cantana.

2164
02:08:32,324 --> 02:08:33,784
He threatens Kermit.

2165
02:08:33,844 --> 02:08:34,244
Yeah.

2166
02:08:34,584 --> 02:08:37,324
Right he wants to make a kill bill with Kermit.

2167
02:08:37,624 --> 02:08:41,504
And the movie grinds to a halt to cut to him in a conference room

2168
02:08:41,504 --> 02:08:43,604
pitching Kermit on a martial arts epic.

2169
02:08:43,804 --> 02:08:46,084
A dynamic location if ever there was one.

2170
02:08:46,364 --> 02:08:47,044
A conference room.

2171
02:08:47,064 --> 02:08:50,204
There's an endearing and weird interview with him on Conan talking about it.

2172
02:08:50,284 --> 02:08:53,404
Where he gets to take a picture with a couple of his favorite muppets

2173
02:08:53,404 --> 02:08:55,344
which are Janis and Rolf I believe.

2174
02:08:56,804 --> 02:09:00,684
Then he talks about having a crush on Janis.

2175
02:09:00,964 --> 02:09:02,144
Excuse me.

2176
02:09:02,264 --> 02:09:03,964
He probably took a picture with Janis's feet.

2177
02:09:04,564 --> 02:09:05,384
Well that's weird.

2178
02:09:05,504 --> 02:09:06,104
Oh no.

2179
02:09:06,204 --> 02:09:08,664
Can I say something sad about Janis?

2180
02:09:08,744 --> 02:09:10,564
Do you guys know the fact?

2181
02:09:10,864 --> 02:09:11,544
Oh I don't know.

2182
02:09:11,544 --> 02:09:11,964
I don't know.

2183
02:09:12,124 --> 02:09:13,084
I don't think so.

2184
02:09:14,304 --> 02:09:19,564
Okay in addition to that miserably this is the final work of Jim Henson.

2185
02:09:19,944 --> 02:09:20,864
This is the last Richard Hunt.

2186
02:09:20,924 --> 02:09:22,324
The last Richard Hunt.

2187
02:09:22,524 --> 02:09:24,164
Richard Hunt died.

2188
02:09:24,864 --> 02:09:26,884
Richard Hunt was very sick while this was being made.

2189
02:09:26,924 --> 02:09:28,884
Richard Hunt is the puppeteer behind Scooter.

2190
02:09:29,044 --> 02:09:32,424
In this production of Scooter, Statler, Beaker and Sweetums.

2191
02:09:35,564 --> 02:09:39,584
But he died of complications from HIV AIDS.

2192
02:09:40,104 --> 02:09:42,404
And he was sick by the time they were shooting this.

2193
02:09:42,724 --> 02:09:45,684
He dubbed the voices but he was not on set puppeteering.

2194
02:09:45,984 --> 02:09:48,804
He was actually one of Henson's sons as Sweetums.

2195
02:09:49,084 --> 02:09:50,884
He was only 40 years old.

2196
02:09:50,984 --> 02:09:51,604
Super young.

2197
02:09:51,984 --> 02:09:59,104
So both, Statler and Waldorf passed away almost immediately.

2198
02:09:59,504 --> 02:09:59,704
That's wild.

2199
02:09:59,704 --> 02:10:03,904
And there's one pickup line in there somewhere that is not Henson.

2200
02:10:04,064 --> 02:10:05,064
That somebody else doing the voice.

2201
02:10:05,584 --> 02:10:08,044
But other than that it's the last time the two of them.

2202
02:10:08,364 --> 02:10:12,064
But so he was sick and they knew it wasn't looking good by the time they were shooting this.

2203
02:10:12,404 --> 02:10:19,424
So on the way into Miss Piggy's musical number two characters go from the atrium world into her music.

2204
02:10:19,484 --> 02:10:24,684
They like ride a bike into her musical number and that's Janis and Scooter.

2205
02:10:24,764 --> 02:10:26,244
And that is a tribute to Richard Hunt.

2206
02:10:26,264 --> 02:10:29,564
I always noticed that in the background of the shot.

2207
02:10:29,564 --> 02:10:30,384
But I didn't realize.

2208
02:10:31,244 --> 02:10:32,404
That's why it's them.

2209
02:10:33,084 --> 02:10:35,944
You always hear about there's a whole generation.

2210
02:10:36,084 --> 02:10:40,964
And her team might look totally different today if a whole generation was not just devastated by AIDS.

2211
02:10:42,164 --> 02:10:46,144
Scooter is another one like Rolf where there wasn't as clear of a game.

2212
02:10:46,204 --> 02:10:49,064
And when the performer died there was no character.

2213
02:10:49,624 --> 02:10:51,024
And all of these really.

2214
02:10:52,464 --> 02:10:53,884
I guess you see Sweetums.

2215
02:10:55,024 --> 02:10:57,704
Yeah and Sweetums was more visually distinctive.

2216
02:10:57,704 --> 02:11:00,604
But like in the same way that Rolf was kind of like an old timer.

2217
02:11:00,684 --> 02:11:02,444
Scooter was just kind of like a nice kid.

2218
02:11:03,064 --> 02:11:03,084
Yeah.

2219
02:11:03,164 --> 02:11:03,424
Yeah.

2220
02:11:03,424 --> 02:11:07,804
So much of it was like that was apparently the character that was like closest to Richard Hunt.

2221
02:11:08,184 --> 02:11:10,044
His sort of vibe and his energy.

2222
02:11:10,144 --> 02:11:13,084
And then when people just do a Scooter impression now.

2223
02:11:13,184 --> 02:11:16,024
I mean they worked them a little bit into the modern movies.

2224
02:11:16,204 --> 02:11:20,184
It just kind of feels like well it's like nice that they're acknowledging he used to be important.

2225
02:11:20,504 --> 02:11:22,124
But Scooter's like the original Walter.

2226
02:11:23,504 --> 02:11:25,144
They are kind of the same just a guy.

2227
02:11:25,404 --> 02:11:25,644
Scooter also.

2228
02:11:25,824 --> 02:11:26,824
Dependable guy.

2229
02:11:26,844 --> 02:11:27,164
He's a big fan.

2230
02:11:27,164 --> 02:11:28,724
Also trying his best.

2231
02:11:29,124 --> 02:11:31,044
He is like the practical producer.

2232
02:11:31,264 --> 02:11:32,064
He's the.

2233
02:11:32,444 --> 02:11:32,564
The.

2234
02:11:32,704 --> 02:11:33,444
Scott Adset.

2235
02:11:34,164 --> 02:11:34,624
30 Rock.

2236
02:11:34,804 --> 02:11:35,084
Yeah.

2237
02:11:35,244 --> 02:11:38,464
He's the what's the title that associate producer.

2238
02:11:38,564 --> 02:11:43,404
That's the one that's either given out as a vanity credit or they did everything to make a movie happen.

2239
02:11:43,404 --> 02:11:45,104
There's no common ground.

2240
02:11:45,864 --> 02:11:53,524
The idea with Scooter too is that there is a Muppet named JP Gross who is like their Muppet tribute to

2241
02:11:53,524 --> 02:11:54,844
Lord Lugrade.

2242
02:11:55,204 --> 02:11:59,584
Who owns the theater and demands that they hire his nephew to work.

2243
02:11:59,584 --> 02:12:02,084
And everyone's like Jesus Christ nepotism.

2244
02:12:02,724 --> 02:12:07,984
And Scooter shows up and so Scooter's kind of got like a chip on his shoulder to prove to them

2245
02:12:07,984 --> 02:12:12,424
that he can like he can fuck with the Muppets you know that he can like carry his weight.

2246
02:12:12,764 --> 02:12:16,084
And so like you know Muppet show is not very serialized.

2247
02:12:16,364 --> 02:12:21,064
But in later seasons they start to let Scooter every once in a while have a musical performance.

2248
02:12:21,604 --> 02:12:24,024
And Kermit always has this like would you believe it.

2249
02:12:24,024 --> 02:12:29,804
One of our own our little gopher wants to do a little song and I thought it was always very endearing

2250
02:12:29,804 --> 02:12:35,024
this like quiet narrative of like Scooter earns their respect and occasionally they let him sing a

2251
02:12:35,024 --> 02:12:35,704
little song.

2252
02:12:35,764 --> 02:12:36,524
Wow.

2253
02:12:36,524 --> 02:12:36,904
That's great.

2254
02:12:37,004 --> 02:12:37,764
He's a good guy.

2255
02:12:37,764 --> 02:12:38,644
This guy's a good guy.

2256
02:12:38,884 --> 02:12:39,964
There's a lot of heartwarming aspects.

2257
02:12:40,044 --> 02:12:45,484
It's a shame in that newer ABC show Scooter's whole thing was that he was just addicted to nicotine gum.

2258
02:12:45,484 --> 02:12:48,624
Like like Marin.

2259
02:12:50,044 --> 02:12:51,684
Scooter was the Marin of the show.

2260
02:12:51,684 --> 02:12:54,324
He was beaten down by too many failed pilots.

2261
02:12:54,904 --> 02:12:56,624
That's what that show feels like.

2262
02:12:57,164 --> 02:12:58,964
Fuck pilot season coming up again.

2263
02:12:59,984 --> 02:13:03,444
Don't put your industry bitterness into the Muppets for God's sake.

2264
02:13:03,724 --> 02:13:06,244
If they can't have hope then who can?

2265
02:13:06,944 --> 02:13:07,284
Wow.

2266
02:13:08,804 --> 02:13:10,644
What else have we what have we missed?

2267
02:13:11,344 --> 02:13:12,024
Oh Constantine.

2268
02:13:12,264 --> 02:13:15,244
Okay so from Muppets most wanted.

2269
02:13:15,664 --> 02:13:20,604
And this lasted like two years from like 2014 to 2016 or something.

2270
02:13:20,764 --> 02:13:22,764
Or no I think the years might be wrong.

2271
02:13:22,764 --> 02:13:23,984
It lasted a while.

2272
02:13:23,984 --> 02:13:28,224
They stuck in a Constantine segment into the pre-show.

2273
02:13:28,504 --> 02:13:29,124
Which is interesting.

2274
02:13:29,224 --> 02:13:35,004
The pre-show was already great but it was Constantine of course the Kermit with the mole.

2275
02:13:35,064 --> 02:13:36,884
Evil Kermit who's now become just a meme.

2276
02:13:37,404 --> 02:13:39,124
Yeah who's now just a meme.

2277
02:13:40,204 --> 02:13:44,464
He's just like oh wow the show.

2278
02:13:44,884 --> 02:13:45,464
Like he said something.

2279
02:13:45,464 --> 02:13:46,944
He takes over and does nothing.

2280
02:13:47,024 --> 02:13:52,404
And then they just cut back to a few minutes later in the pre-show.

2281
02:13:52,404 --> 02:13:53,224
I have to interrupt.

2282
02:13:53,464 --> 02:13:58,264
It's the very which the trope I usually like like who are taking over the fee.

2283
02:13:58,464 --> 02:14:01,104
But then he doesn't he just talks there's no point to it.

2284
02:14:01,104 --> 02:14:05,704
And it really shows the lack of cultural impact of Constantine or any of the new movies.

2285
02:14:05,924 --> 02:14:10,204
That was in the parks for two years and I only just heard about it yesterday.

2286
02:14:10,684 --> 02:14:11,344
Yeah I had no idea.

2287
02:14:11,564 --> 02:14:16,784
It's also it's weird that now the actor the performer behind Constantine's

2288
02:14:16,784 --> 02:14:18,364
is the one who took over Kermit.

2289
02:14:18,564 --> 02:14:22,484
And the whole bit to Constantine is this is a very bad Kermit impression.

2290
02:14:22,764 --> 02:14:24,604
Which I like Constantine.

2291
02:14:25,064 --> 02:14:30,164
But it still was an odd choice to be like the guy who did the purposefully bad Kermit

2292
02:14:30,164 --> 02:14:32,484
is now doing real Kermit.

2293
02:14:32,864 --> 02:14:36,804
Has there been a big thing with his voice as Kermit already?

2294
02:14:36,924 --> 02:14:40,744
They've done like a couple of these like YouTube like Muppet Musings.

2295
02:14:40,764 --> 02:14:41,284
Uh huh.

2296
02:14:41,344 --> 02:14:44,644
Where it's like a fucking eight minute not eight minute.

2297
02:14:45,264 --> 02:14:48,824
Second video where it's like if you don't look out for life it might hit you in the

2298
02:14:48,824 --> 02:14:51,264
back of like whatever dumb sort of like.

2299
02:14:51,264 --> 02:14:53,044
Hi ho what up fam.

02:14:53,344 --> 02:14:57,644
Make sure to click here here and here to like and subscribe.

2301
02:14:57,884 --> 02:14:58,484
I like that.

2302
02:14:58,544 --> 02:14:59,084
I like that.

2303
02:14:59,684 --> 02:14:59,804
I like that.

2304
02:14:59,804 --> 02:15:00,104
I like that.

2305
02:15:00,204 --> 02:15:00,624
I like that.

2306
02:15:00,944 --> 02:15:05,824
That's like they you know made a big deal like it was such a news story about like

2307
02:15:05,824 --> 02:15:10,244
firing Kermit you know which everyone turned into like an emotional thing not really knowing

2308
02:15:10,244 --> 02:15:12,064
the intricacies of the Whitmire thing.

2309
02:15:12,204 --> 02:15:14,044
And then they were like here it is.

2310
02:15:14,044 --> 02:15:18,584
Finally the first debut of the new Kermit and it was like a video where he's like oh

2311
02:15:18,584 --> 02:15:21,584
hi didn't see you there and then like walks away or something.

2312
02:15:21,584 --> 02:15:24,404
I don't think they've done anything with him since.

2313
02:15:24,524 --> 02:15:24,604
Yeah.

2314
02:15:24,604 --> 02:15:25,984
What a rough property.

2315
02:15:26,324 --> 02:15:28,624
Kermit drinking the tea.

2316
02:15:28,644 --> 02:15:29,004
Yeah.

2317
02:15:29,264 --> 02:15:31,424
Has had more of a cultural impact.

2318
02:15:31,604 --> 02:15:31,684
Truly.

2319
02:15:32,264 --> 02:15:33,864
Than a lot of the newer Muppet stuff.

2320
02:15:33,884 --> 02:15:38,904
It's that and the Kermit facing Constantine with the hood which is like a parallel to

2321
02:15:38,904 --> 02:15:40,884
the like Spider-Man pointing at himself.

2322
02:15:40,984 --> 02:15:41,444
Yes.

2323
02:15:41,464 --> 02:15:44,284
It's any sort of shadow version of yourself.

2324
02:15:44,284 --> 02:15:49,644
Those are the most impactful Muppet things and they're things that the audience has taken

2325
02:15:49,644 --> 02:15:52,644
back like that the audience has remixed and used.

2326
02:15:52,844 --> 02:15:54,184
Yeah it's very odd.

2327
02:15:54,504 --> 02:15:56,064
I like the Constantine song.

2328
02:15:56,884 --> 02:15:59,124
I think that's my favorite thing in either the two new movies.

2329
02:15:59,164 --> 02:16:02,464
Yeah yeah that's the main thing keeping me afloat on the new movies of the songs.

2330
02:16:02,624 --> 02:16:03,584
I think songs are fantastic.

2331
02:16:03,664 --> 02:16:05,424
Songs are good yeah life's a happy song.

2332
02:16:06,664 --> 02:16:07,384
Yeah I like that song.

2333
02:16:07,924 --> 02:16:11,424
I'm just down the only reason I'm down on the first single one is because like I was just

2334
02:16:11,644 --> 02:16:15,664
so depressed at like Kermit in his mansion alone.

2335
02:16:15,804 --> 02:16:16,124
Yeah.

2336
02:16:16,464 --> 02:16:17,624
Being a sad sack.

2337
02:16:17,624 --> 02:16:19,764
It like bummed me out so much and I was like this is it.

2338
02:16:19,764 --> 02:16:20,444
It's a bummer.

2339
02:16:20,444 --> 02:16:21,884
I don't like this.

2340
02:16:21,904 --> 02:16:25,924
All your favorite Luke Skywalker, Kermit, all of these guys are.

2341
02:16:26,204 --> 02:16:30,224
Look we have never talked about Last Jedi and today will be no exception.

2342
02:16:30,884 --> 02:16:30,904
No.

2343
02:16:30,944 --> 02:16:31,304
I will not talk about it.

2344
02:16:31,304 --> 02:16:31,704
It's way later.

2345
02:16:31,844 --> 02:16:34,244
There's nothing bad that happens when you talk about Last Jedi.

2346
02:16:34,344 --> 02:16:36,244
I will not talk about it at all.

2347
02:16:36,524 --> 02:16:37,264
I might love it.

2348
02:16:38,064 --> 02:16:39,604
I got a good feeling about this.

2349
02:16:39,604 --> 02:16:41,744
The listener might know I love it.

2350
02:16:42,224 --> 02:16:42,764
We don't know.

2351
02:16:42,864 --> 02:16:51,784
I was talking to someone who's like an editor like a big sort of entertainment but like a higher end

2352
02:16:51,784 --> 02:16:56,464
website and he was saying he still keeps on getting pitches where people are like I just want you to

2353
02:16:56,464 --> 02:16:57,444
know I got a hot pitch.

2354
02:16:57,504 --> 02:17:03,504
I figured out conclusively why the Last Jedi is bad and from like respectable culture writers

2355
02:17:03,504 --> 02:17:06,184
and he's like I don't want to litigate this.

2356
02:17:06,484 --> 02:17:07,284
It doesn't matter.

2357
02:17:07,884 --> 02:17:12,124
It's a while later and there's another one coming.

2358
02:17:12,644 --> 02:17:13,584
Maybe save your energy.

2359
02:17:13,584 --> 02:17:17,064
People are coming at it with the energy of but I'm finally going to win the argument.

2360
02:17:17,124 --> 02:17:18,544
It's an arm wrestling match.

2361
02:17:19,004 --> 02:17:19,684
It's a year later.

2362
02:17:19,964 --> 02:17:23,604
All the arguments from the original trilogy and the prequels have been settled.

2363
02:17:24,364 --> 02:17:24,604
It's so creamy.

2364
02:17:26,564 --> 02:17:28,204
I'm sure it'll go away soon.

2365
02:17:28,224 --> 02:17:32,664
We all know who shot first and it's always interesting when it gets brought up again.

2366
02:17:33,024 --> 02:17:36,044
Let's keep going over this please.

2367
02:17:36,524 --> 02:17:37,604
What have we missed?

2368
02:17:37,944 --> 02:17:44,804
We sort of breezed past the pre-show other than quoting some lines in this Constantine thing.

2369
02:17:45,124 --> 02:17:46,564
The three monitors.

2370
02:17:47,324 --> 02:17:48,644
That is such a clever.

2371
02:17:49,184 --> 02:17:53,324
If you never got a chance to go on this and please let me shout out Martin's Vids we have

2372
02:17:53,324 --> 02:17:55,344
before this great archivist of these videos.

2373
02:17:55,644 --> 02:18:00,104
God bless this man who took the three monitors that are in the pre-show room

2374
02:18:00,104 --> 02:18:02,044
and stitched them together.

2375
02:18:02,884 --> 02:18:06,264
It's sort of a reconstructed version of how these things work.

2376
02:18:07,604 --> 02:18:11,284
There's so much fun with the three monitors where

2377
02:18:11,284 --> 02:18:15,884
sometimes it's the same image on all of them and it's gonzo dancing and you think it's three of

2378
02:18:15,884 --> 02:18:20,964
the same but then one drops something and the pattern deviates or you watch the characters

2379
02:18:20,964 --> 02:18:25,504
cross from one to the far left one all the way to the far right one.

2380
02:18:26,504 --> 02:18:28,744
I think that stuff's super faulty action between the three monitors.

2381
02:18:28,844 --> 02:18:30,204
I honestly don't know how they did it.

2382
02:18:30,204 --> 02:18:32,064
Did they line up three cameras?

2383
02:18:32,144 --> 02:18:34,584
Was it that simple or are those three different takes?

2384
02:18:34,824 --> 02:18:37,104
What a weird thing to have to direct.

2385
02:18:37,104 --> 02:18:38,684
That's a good pre-show.

2386
02:18:39,324 --> 02:18:42,884
All the props, all the ACME corporation.

2387
02:18:42,904 --> 02:18:44,144
There's a waiting area.

2388
02:18:44,484 --> 02:18:45,324
It's so fun.

2389
02:18:45,984 --> 02:18:50,244
When I'm watching the video it's just packed full of stuff.

2390
02:18:50,804 --> 02:18:54,144
That's the rewatchability or whatever you would call it.

2391
02:18:54,144 --> 02:18:59,084
Not rideability but that's why there's so much stuff and so many little things.

2392
02:18:59,424 --> 02:19:02,984
You don't get tired of as much as other comedy theme park stuff.

2393
02:19:02,984 --> 02:19:06,584
I was going to say you guys talk a lot about and it's really made me think about how hard it is

2394
02:19:06,584 --> 02:19:11,944
to write theme park comedy because you need things that can play to everyone and that can play for a

2395
02:19:11,944 --> 02:19:12,984
long time.

2396
02:19:13,684 --> 02:19:19,664
I feel like Muppet Vision 3D is the most purely successful comedic attraction.

2397
02:19:20,184 --> 02:19:20,804
Maybe it is.

2398
02:19:20,804 --> 02:19:23,964
Yeah, I think that's great.

2399
02:19:24,064 --> 02:19:30,564
With the right IP to do it because the puppets have always had their funny kids into parents.

2400
02:19:30,924 --> 02:19:32,664
Those jokes still play.

2401
02:19:32,884 --> 02:19:36,164
You go see it at MGM studios and the audience still laughs a ton.

2402
02:19:36,884 --> 02:19:42,684
And they have a little bit of an out in that some of the jokes are growners on purpose.

2403
02:19:42,684 --> 02:19:47,804
And then you get Statler and Waldorf as a commentary on Wasn't That Bad.

2404
02:19:48,024 --> 02:19:51,484
They're the greatest comedic conceit of all time.

2405
02:19:51,804 --> 02:19:58,024
Being able to have a Statler and Waldorf baked into your show where you can win back any bad joke

2406
02:19:58,024 --> 02:20:01,104
by commenting on it and acknowledging it.

2407
02:20:01,184 --> 02:20:08,344
And how fun that if you're seeing Muppet Vision for the ninth time that your eyes can wander and

2408
02:20:08,344 --> 02:20:12,364
like I'm just going to stare at those Statler and Waldorf puppets doing nothing for a while.

2409
02:20:12,364 --> 02:20:16,504
Let me just pick one animatronic penguin to watch for a while.

2410
02:20:16,584 --> 02:20:18,164
I like this is just a fun thing.

2411
02:20:18,364 --> 02:20:20,544
I didn't it's just a thing like it makes sense when you hear it.

2412
02:20:20,544 --> 02:20:23,524
But it's like they have three arms when they wave the white flags at the end.

2413
02:20:23,524 --> 02:20:24,544
It's obviously a separate arm.

2414
02:20:24,624 --> 02:20:25,704
It's not their puppet arms.

2415
02:20:25,724 --> 02:20:28,664
So there's just separate arms that come up with the white flags.

2416
02:20:28,664 --> 02:20:29,664
Oh, interesting.

2417
02:20:29,804 --> 02:20:30,404
And there's three.

2418
02:20:30,604 --> 02:20:31,384
You know, yeah, yeah.

2419
02:20:31,444 --> 02:20:32,504
Well, no, I'm just saying they have three arms.

2420
02:20:32,544 --> 02:20:35,224
So they have their two normal arms and then they duck.

2421
02:20:35,224 --> 02:20:38,524
They can't get an animatronic to reach and grab a little pop and hold it in their chest.

2422
02:20:38,524 --> 02:20:38,784
Sure.

2423
02:20:39,004 --> 02:20:40,304
So I read it and went, of course.

2424
02:20:40,424 --> 02:20:41,124
Oh, that's cool.

2425
02:20:41,744 --> 02:20:44,004
And a similar thing to that.

2426
02:20:44,164 --> 02:20:45,804
It's multiple Swedish chefs.

2427
02:20:45,804 --> 02:20:48,084
And they're all on a big turntable.

2428
02:20:48,344 --> 02:20:52,224
So when one is done with their specific task, it all rotates.

2429
02:20:52,444 --> 02:20:54,164
And number two is up and number three is.

2430
02:20:54,164 --> 02:20:54,724
That's great.

2431
02:20:55,024 --> 02:20:59,044
I'll say this because we talked about like, oh, yeah, there's Muppets coming to Disney Plus.

2432
02:20:59,264 --> 02:21:04,164
I think we like have all agreed like go back to the Muppets.

2433
02:21:04,484 --> 02:21:05,884
The core they're putting on a show.

2434
02:21:06,264 --> 02:21:07,024
Lot of hearts.

2435
02:21:07,364 --> 02:21:12,704
And I think the thing to look at of like, well, how do they can the Muppets comment on like the

2436
02:21:13,144 --> 02:21:19,124
like the current showbiz, all the nonsense streaming sites and like there's a new Netflix

2437
02:21:19,124 --> 02:21:20,324
thing every day.

2438
02:21:20,324 --> 02:21:26,064
The example I would point out is the new run of Nancy comic strips where it's like the

2439
02:21:26,064 --> 02:21:27,064
the core of the characters.

2440
02:21:27,064 --> 02:21:32,644
But there's all of this like Nancy adding movies to her queue and never watching them.

2441
02:21:32,644 --> 02:21:38,644
And it doesn't it feels modern and it hits on like modern anxieties and stuff.

2442
02:21:38,724 --> 02:21:39,504
And it's like.

2443
02:21:39,804 --> 02:21:40,904
I think that's a great example.

2444
02:21:40,904 --> 02:21:45,624
The other one I've been thinking of this whole episode is at the Disneyland Hotel, they had a

2445
02:21:45,624 --> 02:21:49,464
channel that was just playing those new Mickey Mouse shorts over and over again.

2446
02:21:49,464 --> 02:21:53,884
And I have been dismissive of them just because I was like, this looks like some unnecessary

2447
02:21:53,884 --> 02:21:55,584
redesign of all the characters.

2448
02:21:55,904 --> 02:21:57,724
But those things are actually funny.

2449
02:21:57,724 --> 02:21:58,184
Yeah.

2450
02:21:58,184 --> 02:22:01,344
And they actually give the characters like a personality again.

2451
02:22:01,344 --> 02:22:06,224
After like decades of being like Mickey can't be too much of any one thing because he has to work

2452
02:22:06,224 --> 02:22:08,084
as a thing that can sell bath towels.

2453
02:22:08,244 --> 02:22:10,144
You walk like he gets angry.

2454
02:22:10,144 --> 02:22:11,284
He can be petty.

2455
02:22:11,404 --> 02:22:11,704
Yeah.

2456
02:22:11,744 --> 02:22:13,264
Like they're funny gags in them.

2457
02:22:13,284 --> 02:22:14,284
And those have a guy.

2458
02:22:14,364 --> 02:22:16,024
Those have a guy overseeing them all.

2459
02:22:16,024 --> 02:22:17,204
And he's like an animation life.

2460
02:22:17,264 --> 02:22:19,524
I think it's a Rocko's modern life guy.

2461
02:22:19,524 --> 02:22:25,444
Oh, you feel the fact that they have like a clear voice and a take and a comedic sensibility.

2462
02:22:25,704 --> 02:22:30,824
And you need to have someone come in who like gets the history of the thing, but also isn't

2463
02:22:30,824 --> 02:22:32,804
just trying to recreate it.

2464
02:22:32,884 --> 02:22:33,844
Yeah, right, right, right.

2465
02:22:34,184 --> 02:22:34,624
It's tough.

2466
02:22:34,764 --> 02:22:37,884
It's very tough with the Muppets of all the things I would like to work on.

2467
02:22:37,884 --> 02:22:40,944
Muppets sounds cool, but it feels like the most daunting to me.

2468
02:22:40,944 --> 02:22:42,244
I would be terrified.

2469
02:22:42,484 --> 02:22:44,184
But it's like, yeah, it's like Batman.

2470
02:22:44,364 --> 02:22:46,404
There's been a million great versions of Batman.

2471
02:22:46,404 --> 02:22:46,524
Right.

2472
02:22:46,764 --> 02:22:49,924
Like all different things, but it's like Muppets.

2473
02:22:50,024 --> 02:22:50,844
I'm like, I don't know what the hell.

2474
02:22:51,024 --> 02:22:52,944
I don't know what the secret is.

2475
02:22:52,964 --> 02:22:54,224
I don't really have the answer.

2476
02:22:54,244 --> 02:22:56,964
I feel like I don't like, but I don't know what.

2477
02:22:57,324 --> 02:23:00,244
I think the other scary thing is they need to develop a lot of new characters.

2478
02:23:00,244 --> 02:23:04,744
Like I think you keep the main core, but I think you need to get some performers creating

2479
02:23:04,744 --> 02:23:06,724
their own characters that they own fully.

2480
02:23:06,904 --> 02:23:10,164
And so often the new characters are plot functions.

2481
02:23:10,284 --> 02:23:11,684
I mean, like Walter's a plot function.

2482
02:23:11,764 --> 02:23:13,124
Constantine's a plot function.

2483
02:23:13,124 --> 02:23:13,504
Right, right, right.

2484
02:23:13,664 --> 02:23:17,384
Let someone workshop something until they come up with a fun voice, a fun character

2485
02:23:17,384 --> 02:23:19,944
design and mix them in with the classics.

2486
02:23:20,024 --> 02:23:21,024
I got a big one.

2487
02:23:21,524 --> 02:23:25,624
The next Muppet thing cannot be a cameo fest.

2488
02:23:25,684 --> 02:23:29,544
Every single Muppet thing ever since Jim Dot.

2489
02:23:29,844 --> 02:23:31,424
There's one person.

2490
02:23:31,424 --> 02:23:32,264
How about that?

2491
02:23:32,544 --> 02:23:35,664
Like I think everybody likes the host of the Muppet show.

2492
02:23:35,664 --> 02:23:37,864
Or like we like Prince on Muppets tonight.

2493
02:23:38,204 --> 02:23:43,604
But all of these movies are just like and then Elizabeth Banks is herself and Jack Black

2494
02:23:43,604 --> 02:23:45,144
is himself twice.

2495
02:23:45,404 --> 02:23:50,944
He shows up once and then they build to a giant cameo at the end that ends up being

2496
02:23:50,944 --> 02:23:52,084
Jack Black again.

2497
02:23:52,464 --> 02:23:52,564
Right.

2498
02:23:52,564 --> 02:23:56,744
It's one of those infuriating things that like stops me from liking that movie more.

2499
02:23:57,224 --> 02:24:01,264
But I think it really does damage the IP.

2500
02:24:02,004 --> 02:24:04,304
What is this new Muppets about?

2501
02:24:04,304 --> 02:24:09,544
Well, it really it puts a lot of holes in it if it's dependent on Ty Burrell coming

2502
02:24:09,544 --> 02:24:12,504
in, then you have it's not an IP anymore.

2503
02:24:12,684 --> 02:24:17,584
And the cameos are good in the original movies because the gag isn't look who it is

2504
02:24:17,584 --> 02:24:18,604
doing this.

2505
02:24:18,604 --> 02:24:22,624
And I feel like there are a lot of them in the new movies where it's like why is Sarah

2506
02:24:22,624 --> 02:24:28,044
Silverman playing the waitress who sits Amy Adams at a table in a scene with no Muppets

2507
02:24:28,044 --> 02:24:28,984
in it?

2508
02:24:29,924 --> 02:24:36,444
Why is James McAvoy randomly like the delivery man for UPS with no lines?

2509
02:24:37,224 --> 02:24:41,184
You know, and they're like a weird level of like is the joke supposed to be?

2510
02:24:41,244 --> 02:24:45,264
I can't believe they did this because then you have like there's the scene in Muppets

2511
02:24:45,264 --> 02:24:49,764
at Manhattan where Kermit and Piggy are fighting in Central Park and like Gregory Hines comes

2512
02:24:49,764 --> 02:24:51,424
in and tries to mediate the fight.

2513
02:24:51,904 --> 02:24:54,084
And as a kid, I had no idea who Gregory Hines was.

2514
02:24:54,164 --> 02:24:57,764
But I was like, this is a funny scene or this guy's giving a funny performance.

2515
02:24:57,764 --> 02:25:01,264
Just the poster of Muppets most wanted.

2516
02:25:01,824 --> 02:25:05,464
One day I went down to Disneyland right before that movie came out and they were giving out

2517
02:25:05,464 --> 02:25:08,124
puzzles that were that poster.

2518
02:25:08,844 --> 02:25:14,084
And nothing glues it more to that year that it's like, look, it's the Muppets and Ty Burrell

2519
02:25:14,084 --> 02:25:15,804
and Tina Fey and Ricky Gervais.

2520
02:25:15,924 --> 02:25:18,484
That's just like stuck in like the 2010s.

2521
02:25:18,484 --> 02:25:23,224
Gervais is especially giant because that's the last moment where we had tolerance for him.

2522
02:25:23,624 --> 02:25:25,644
But Jason, were you offended by him?

2523
02:25:25,704 --> 02:25:27,504
Were you offended by his presence?

2524
02:25:27,624 --> 02:25:28,824
That must be the problem.

2525
02:25:28,924 --> 02:25:31,964
I mean, you guys, this was very enlightening on Blank Shack.

2526
02:25:31,984 --> 02:25:34,024
I found out he's an atheist.

2527
02:25:35,724 --> 02:25:37,604
Well, let's not say that too loudly.

2528
02:25:37,644 --> 02:25:42,904
It's kind of like The Last Jedi where it's a little too hot for people when you discuss it.

2529
02:25:43,144 --> 02:25:44,984
He doesn't want it getting out there.

2530
02:25:45,504 --> 02:25:46,984
Yeah, you guys are a little chill about it.

2531
02:25:47,004 --> 02:25:48,144
Sorry if I'm blowing up your spot.

2532
02:25:48,804 --> 02:25:49,924
Yeah, he's going to be upset.

2533
02:25:50,004 --> 02:25:52,084
Well, let me say this in all that.

2534
02:25:52,224 --> 02:25:59,084
What's one thing that the pretty successful timeless Muppet Vision 3D does not have cameos?

2535
02:25:59,664 --> 02:26:01,804
There's not one cameo in the thing.

2536
02:26:02,844 --> 02:26:04,264
Yeah, I don't know.

2537
02:26:04,424 --> 02:26:05,304
I think that helps it.

2538
02:26:05,384 --> 02:26:06,664
It's a flea Muppet experience.

2539
02:26:07,004 --> 02:26:07,604
Yeah, I agree with what you said.

2540
02:26:07,644 --> 02:26:11,524
Give some Henson people license to create new characters.

2541
02:26:11,964 --> 02:26:15,284
Bring on some young, excited comedy writers who loved it growing up.

2542
02:26:15,604 --> 02:26:18,744
I'll say that around people I've met around UCB and the comedy community.

2543
02:26:19,504 --> 02:26:21,324
Big, big love of the Muppets.

2544
02:26:21,324 --> 02:26:22,104
That's my thing.

2545
02:26:22,204 --> 02:26:23,084
I just go like-

2546
02:26:23,084 --> 02:26:25,064
Muppets, musical theater, professional wrestling.

2547
02:26:25,264 --> 02:26:30,224
It all makes sense that then people grew up liking this stuff and now I want to be theatrical.

2548
02:26:30,284 --> 02:26:35,284
I also feel like the best model for the modern Muppet show is Comedy Bang Bang.

2549
02:26:35,784 --> 02:26:39,984
That's the vibe of that thing of just the chaos of people storming in.

2550
02:26:40,124 --> 02:26:44,304
And Aukerman kind of is like a Kermit figure where he's just trying to hold it all together.

2551
02:26:44,384 --> 02:26:45,664
Not a sad sack.

2552
02:26:46,284 --> 02:26:48,084
Little put upon, little stressed out.

2553
02:26:48,864 --> 02:26:53,544
There's people in it as themselves, but there's also somebody doing a character.

2554
02:26:53,784 --> 02:26:56,124
They're doing their thing that they're good at.

2555
02:26:56,304 --> 02:26:57,644
It's not purely-

2556
02:26:57,644 --> 02:26:59,064
There's this great clip.

2557
02:26:59,404 --> 02:27:04,824
I saw, I think, the Museum of Moving Image in New York City opened this whole Muppet wing

2558
02:27:04,824 --> 02:27:10,304
and they acquired a lot of the Henson archives and they have this incredible permanent exhibit now.

2559
02:27:10,384 --> 02:27:15,144
And when they acquired all that stuff, Frank Oz did this event where he spoke about his

2560
02:27:15,144 --> 02:27:17,644
history with the Muppets and they played a bunch of rare clips.

2561
02:27:17,924 --> 02:27:23,824
And they had this one clip that was outtakes from them doing a bit for Sesame Street,

2562
02:27:24,164 --> 02:27:26,604
a show that's ostensibly supposed to be educational.

2563
02:27:26,964 --> 02:27:30,444
And they can't get through the bit because they keep on cracking up.

2564
02:27:30,864 --> 02:27:34,704
And there's another one like that where it's for Emmett Otter's Christmas,

2565
02:27:35,324 --> 02:27:40,464
where it's outtakes with them riffing but in the puppets about things going wrong on set.

2566
02:27:40,624 --> 02:27:44,184
And you get the sense that these guys were making each other laugh.

2567
02:27:44,584 --> 02:27:50,744
They were having fun doing the thing in the same way that good comedy podcasts and bit shows do

2568
02:27:50,744 --> 02:27:54,144
where it's like they're trying to break each other as much as-

2569
02:27:54,144 --> 02:27:54,544
Yeah.

2570
02:27:54,544 --> 02:27:55,184
It was an organic-

2571
02:27:55,184 --> 02:27:56,744
You want that vibe to Muppet stuff.

2572
02:27:56,784 --> 02:27:57,164
Yeah.

2573
02:27:57,164 --> 02:28:00,964
And if it can't be the old people, the people who did it before,

2574
02:28:01,564 --> 02:28:07,524
like the way SNL regenerates, it should be people who have a camaraderie and a shared sensibility.

2575
02:28:07,544 --> 02:28:10,504
But that's why I think you need to go half new, half old.

2576
02:28:10,744 --> 02:28:11,524
Sure, yeah, that makes sense.

2577
02:28:11,684 --> 02:28:15,084
Bring in a bunch of new people so people can have the fun of exploring the characters,

2578
02:28:15,164 --> 02:28:17,964
making the new discoveries, adding new depths onto them.

2579
02:28:18,244 --> 02:28:25,864
I was a PA at a comedy festival like 12, 13 years ago now, and Puppet Up was one of the main shows

2580
02:28:25,864 --> 02:28:31,284
and that was their adult sort of improvised puppet. And no matter how you feel about that

2581
02:28:31,284 --> 02:28:36,684
sort of thing, they were gifted improvisers and they were like Henson Light, because I started

2582
02:28:36,684 --> 02:28:40,704
talking to them about working with Henson stuff because I was like, I mean, 2007,

2583
02:28:40,924 --> 02:28:45,784
not great for Henson stuff, but I was like, hey, a lot of shows out, TV shows on DVD,

2584
02:28:45,964 --> 02:28:50,124
are we going to get Muppet Babies DVDs? One guy was like, we're working on it.

2585
02:28:50,704 --> 02:28:55,964
I just feel like there's such a rich library there. And I feel like if Henson had lived,

2586
02:28:56,624 --> 02:29:00,164
the Henson studios could have kept growing and growing.

2587
02:29:00,184 --> 02:29:05,984
And I know some people who work on Sesame and Henson and these sort of adjacent things,

2588
02:29:06,464 --> 02:29:10,404
who I forced to become friends with me so I can shake stories out of them and stuff.

2589
02:29:10,824 --> 02:29:14,384
And so many of them are just like, yeah, the landscape isn't great right now.

2590
02:29:14,824 --> 02:29:18,804
We all got into doing this because we love this stuff and now we're kind of doing stuff

2591
02:29:18,804 --> 02:29:21,484
that doesn't feel totally on point. You know?

2592
02:29:21,664 --> 02:29:22,024
Hummer.

2593
02:29:22,864 --> 02:29:27,724
Heidi, shaking up an entire culture is very tough. And you know, like,

2594
02:29:29,044 --> 02:29:34,324
Disney was in such a rough run post-Walt because there was so much what would Walt do and not

2595
02:29:34,324 --> 02:29:36,424
let's do something for God's sake.

2596
02:29:36,424 --> 02:29:40,864
And I feel like the Roy years kind of mirror the Brian Henson years.

2597
02:29:40,944 --> 02:29:47,264
The relative who understood the person a lot and didn't necessarily have the same vision

2598
02:29:47,264 --> 02:29:49,064
for the creative aspects.

2599
02:29:50,504 --> 02:29:52,024
You need an Eisner.

2600
02:29:53,944 --> 02:30:00,524
You talk about puppeteers breaking each other up and bloopers and stuff.

2601
02:30:01,124 --> 02:30:03,844
You ever seen the bloopers from the Muppets at Walt Disney World?

2602
02:30:04,324 --> 02:30:05,424
No, I don't think I have.

2603
02:30:05,444 --> 02:30:06,084
Oh, man.

2604
02:30:06,384 --> 02:30:13,824
It's all very good. But the first cup, the first minute of it or so is Fawzi and Fawzi's mom

2605
02:30:13,824 --> 02:30:19,904
doing a scene with Eisner and he keeps fucking up.

2606
02:30:20,904 --> 02:30:24,384
And they're like, razzin' him. And you're going, oh my God, this is like,

2607
02:30:24,404 --> 02:30:28,724
he's trying to do like a hostile takeover of this entity.

2608
02:30:29,084 --> 02:30:33,664
And the actual characters are down on their knees at the Grand Floridian

2609
02:30:33,664 --> 02:30:34,584
giving him shit.

2610
02:30:34,744 --> 02:30:39,464
I mean, it's like an actual Muppet villain trying to like kick them out of the theater.

2611
02:30:40,144 --> 02:30:41,584
Yeah, yeah, very much so.

2612
02:30:41,904 --> 02:30:46,664
And then you put then in the actual finished product is this crazy thing where they all like,

2613
02:30:46,664 --> 02:30:51,944
he gets like a little bit of he gets a stain on his shirt from Fawzi and then all the Muppets

2614
02:30:51,944 --> 02:30:56,564
run in and then they've torn up his clothes instead of fixing it.

2615
02:30:56,564 --> 02:31:01,164
And then they run out and he turns to the camera and goes, they're here.

2616
02:31:02,944 --> 02:31:08,704
The actual villain in that show is my boy Charles Groten, right?

2617
02:31:08,704 --> 02:31:14,704
One of the best human Muppet performers. He always knew exactly how to kind of move the

2618
02:31:14,704 --> 02:31:15,284
Muppet wavelength.

2619
02:31:15,804 --> 02:31:19,844
Yeah, the great Muppet caper. That was before Muppet Take Man?

2620
02:31:20,084 --> 02:31:20,324
Okay.

2621
02:31:20,484 --> 02:31:22,024
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's the second one.

2622
02:31:22,084 --> 02:31:26,644
The answer is, so no cameos except for Charles Groten.

2623
02:31:26,884 --> 02:31:27,044
Except for Groten.

2624
02:31:27,504 --> 02:31:28,344
And Michael Eisner.

2625
02:31:29,144 --> 02:31:32,484
Siegel wrote him into the Muppets and he turned it down.

2626
02:31:34,004 --> 02:31:38,044
He wanted him to play the same character from Great Muppet Caper and he was like,

2627
02:31:38,484 --> 02:31:39,564
it's not the same without Jim.

2628
02:31:40,084 --> 02:31:43,444
I don't want to do victory lap stuff.

2629
02:31:44,124 --> 02:31:47,084
Groten also, I think, you know, famous for being a little cantankerous.

2630
02:31:47,284 --> 02:31:47,624
Oh, sure.

2631
02:31:48,544 --> 02:31:55,444
But it is true that it's not the same without Jim and there is this, I do have this bittersweet

2632
02:31:55,444 --> 02:32:02,144
feeling talking about this thing that like, it is, I don't know, it's this like, it's like this last

2633
02:32:02,144 --> 02:32:04,664
stop of what train you thought was going to keep going and going.

2634
02:32:04,964 --> 02:32:05,324
It's a bummer.

2635
02:32:05,324 --> 02:32:07,144
And I think it's really special for that reason.

2636
02:32:07,784 --> 02:32:14,844
Yeah, I really worry about the threat of them getting rid of it at Disney World because it

2637
02:32:14,844 --> 02:32:20,084
feels like it's such an important cultural moment in the history of these characters.

2638
02:32:20,084 --> 02:32:20,544
Yeah.

2639
02:32:20,584 --> 02:32:24,924
Especially because it is the swan song for a lot of these people in the eras and the techniques

2640
02:32:24,924 --> 02:32:26,204
and all of that sort of stuff.

2641
02:32:27,164 --> 02:32:29,284
I know we've already been going for seven and a half hours,

2642
02:32:29,564 --> 02:32:35,704
but have any of you seen the Defunctland video about what the plans were to do after

2643
02:32:35,704 --> 02:32:38,304
the Muppet takeover of the park?

2644
02:32:38,444 --> 02:32:38,784
Yeah.

2645
02:32:38,784 --> 02:32:39,624
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

2646
02:32:39,624 --> 02:32:41,344
Where they were going to re-theme everything.

2647
02:32:41,364 --> 02:32:43,264
It was the year after Mickey's birthday.

2648
02:32:43,744 --> 02:32:46,164
And they were going to take the year off.

2649
02:32:46,304 --> 02:32:46,604
Right.

2650
02:32:46,684 --> 02:32:49,164
The characters are going away for a while because they're exhausted.

2651
02:32:49,384 --> 02:32:50,044
It wasn't Mickey's birthday.

2652
02:32:50,164 --> 02:32:51,784
It was the anniversary.

2653
02:32:52,404 --> 02:32:53,724
The 35th.

2654
02:32:54,704 --> 02:32:54,724
Right.

2655
02:32:54,724 --> 02:32:56,424
The big five are going on vacation.

2656
02:32:56,484 --> 02:32:57,744
The Muppets are taking over.

2657
02:32:58,164 --> 02:32:58,284
Right.

2658
02:32:58,284 --> 02:32:59,964
And they were going to paint the castle green.

2659
02:33:00,224 --> 02:33:01,924
Wasn't it Kermit the Matterhorn or something?

2660
02:33:02,144 --> 02:33:02,664
Yes, that's what it was.

2661
02:33:02,764 --> 02:33:05,544
The Matterhorn was going to have Kermit eyes be painted green.

2662
02:33:05,564 --> 02:33:06,024
Yeah.

2663
02:33:06,104 --> 02:33:10,204
And they were just going to work them in all over the park as if they were poorly running the place.

2664
02:33:10,404 --> 02:33:13,724
Like animal chasing people around in Pirates.

2665
02:33:14,004 --> 02:33:14,904
I like this idea.

2666
02:33:14,924 --> 02:33:15,724
It sounds so much fun.

2667
02:33:15,924 --> 02:33:16,964
That is so much fun.

2668
02:33:16,964 --> 02:33:18,204
And of course, it would never happen.

2669
02:33:18,204 --> 02:33:19,324
It certainly won't happen now.

2670
02:33:19,324 --> 02:33:19,644
No.

2671
02:33:19,684 --> 02:33:23,504
Like when everything is so watched and gone over with a fine tooth comb.

2672
02:33:23,604 --> 02:33:23,884
Yeah.

2673
02:33:24,184 --> 02:33:29,504
I mean, just to reiterate this one last time, that's what startled me about watching these

2674
02:33:29,504 --> 02:33:34,704
Mickey shorts in the hotel was it felt like they weren't as closely guarded as all the Mickey stuff.

2675
02:33:34,704 --> 02:33:35,044
Yes.

2676
02:33:35,204 --> 02:33:36,244
Of the last 30 years.

2677
02:33:36,264 --> 02:33:41,964
And I wish they would similarly kind of let go and be like, we're accepting pitches from anybody

2678
02:33:41,964 --> 02:33:42,964
on Muppets stuff.

2679
02:33:43,124 --> 02:33:44,604
Someone come in with a take.

2680
02:33:44,624 --> 02:33:46,404
I think they're kind of doing that with those Looney.

2681
02:33:46,404 --> 02:33:48,904
There's like 200 Looney Tunes shorts or something.

2682
02:33:48,904 --> 02:33:53,164
And they've all been farmed out to different animators and comedy writers and stuff.

2683
02:33:54,164 --> 02:33:56,564
Cautiously optimistic that some good stuff will come out of that.

2684
02:33:57,404 --> 02:34:01,984
So that and Disneyland app, say where your cheese fries are.

2685
02:34:02,224 --> 02:34:03,864
Let me search by item.

2686
02:34:04,804 --> 02:34:05,624
That's really smart.

2687
02:34:05,824 --> 02:34:08,124
We'll find the best cheese fries location.

2688
02:34:08,404 --> 02:34:09,424
I will vow to you.

2689
02:34:09,524 --> 02:34:13,164
We'll find the best place in Disneyland resort to get cheese fries.

2690
02:34:13,184 --> 02:34:15,964
I want to be able to crack open the app, search cheese fries.

2691
02:34:16,104 --> 02:34:17,044
It goes, here's where they are.

2692
02:34:17,104 --> 02:34:18,024
I mobile order.

2693
02:34:18,204 --> 02:34:22,604
And the time it takes me to walk to that stand, then the item's ready.

2694
02:34:22,604 --> 02:34:27,264
There should be a way to reveal secret menu items on the app because I don't think those

2695
02:34:27,264 --> 02:34:29,904
mozzarella sticks are available to mobile order.

2696
02:34:29,904 --> 02:34:30,984
I don't know that they are.

2697
02:34:31,384 --> 02:34:33,744
There has to be some secret you touch on the app.

2698
02:34:34,104 --> 02:34:38,544
The interface is not very helpful unless you know exactly what you want and from where.

2699
02:34:38,704 --> 02:34:39,864
Yeah, they need to do some upgrades.

2700
02:34:40,484 --> 02:34:43,544
Which at the Anaheim Park, a lot of people do go regularly.

2701
02:34:43,924 --> 02:34:45,524
So kind of get that.

2702
02:34:45,644 --> 02:34:49,144
But for people who haven't been there much or been there before at all,

2703
02:34:49,424 --> 02:34:54,244
if you have a kid and the kid's breaking down, it's like, I want cheese fries or I want a burger.

2704
02:34:54,444 --> 02:34:57,604
Put that search, universal search in there.

2705
02:34:58,024 --> 02:35:02,884
Or if you have a grown adult son who you're hanging out with at Disneyland who's breaking

2706
02:35:02,884 --> 02:35:04,404
down, I want cheese fries.

2707
02:35:05,064 --> 02:35:06,004
It's also a problem.

2708
02:35:06,284 --> 02:35:06,584
Sure.

2709
02:35:06,844 --> 02:35:11,744
I think also they should add a Jason's picks filter because I'm here waiting for you to

2710
02:35:11,744 --> 02:35:13,664
tweet back about the ice cream tips.

2711
02:35:13,744 --> 02:35:17,704
And I was driving back and forth from a bizarre commercial audition.

2712
02:35:17,704 --> 02:35:19,884
I don't blame you and I hope the audition went well.

2713
02:35:19,904 --> 02:35:22,744
I was replying to you in the drive through of a Taco Bell.

2714
02:35:23,544 --> 02:35:27,604
I just feel like I know like you have takes on all of this and I want them to go to you

2715
02:35:27,604 --> 02:35:32,904
and put a little Jason banner, you know, on the items that you would order from each place.

2716
02:35:33,264 --> 02:35:36,424
It's like a video store giving their person that works there, give their picks.

2717
02:35:37,544 --> 02:35:37,584
Yeah.

2718
02:35:37,604 --> 02:35:40,444
The Treat Master General has decided his decree.

2719
02:35:40,724 --> 02:35:41,864
Reporting for duty.

2720
02:35:44,924 --> 02:35:46,164
Wait, wait, wait.

2721
02:35:47,564 --> 02:35:48,364
See every scoop.

2722
02:35:48,864 --> 02:35:49,644
That's good.

2723
02:35:49,644 --> 02:35:50,464
That's pretty good.

2724
02:35:50,604 --> 02:35:50,624
Right?

2725
02:35:54,384 --> 02:35:54,944
Wonderful.

2726
02:35:55,364 --> 02:35:55,684
You know what?

2727
02:35:55,684 --> 02:36:01,424
If I had put based on what I knew about you and your nerdy leanings and your work,

2728
02:36:01,464 --> 02:36:05,304
I would have put money on the fact that this episode would have been a two and a half hour.

2729
02:36:05,304 --> 02:36:05,664
Yeah.

2730
02:36:05,664 --> 02:36:06,704
And I'm glad it was.

2731
02:36:06,704 --> 02:36:07,684
I had a great time.

2732
02:36:07,944 --> 02:36:10,064
Griffin Newman, you survived the ride.

2733
02:36:10,224 --> 02:36:11,324
What an honor.

2734
02:36:11,964 --> 02:36:12,444
Come back.

2735
02:36:12,624 --> 02:36:13,524
Come back anytime.

2736
02:36:13,844 --> 02:36:15,824
And I don't even like cutting it off.

2737
02:36:15,824 --> 02:36:18,104
I feel like it's just like it's a card issue at this point.

2738
02:36:18,304 --> 02:36:23,264
It's a it's at some point that it's going to it's going to just burst into smoke.

2739
02:36:23,264 --> 02:36:24,124
It's like a muppet item.

2740
02:36:24,304 --> 02:36:24,984
Just for safety.

2741
02:36:25,404 --> 02:36:25,584
Yeah.

2742
02:36:25,584 --> 02:36:27,804
But thanks so much for being here.

2743
02:36:27,884 --> 02:36:29,284
Let's exit through the gift shop.

2744
02:36:29,284 --> 02:36:30,824
Is there anything you'd like to plug?

2745
02:36:31,144 --> 02:36:35,104
I would tick season one's available now on Amazon.

2746
02:36:35,304 --> 02:36:37,364
Season two will be coming out semi shortly.

2747
02:36:37,744 --> 02:36:37,784
OK.

2748
02:36:38,244 --> 02:36:38,764
Next couple of months.

2749
02:36:38,764 --> 02:36:40,464
I don't know if I want to officially say when.

2750
02:36:40,624 --> 02:36:40,804
Sure.

2751
02:36:40,824 --> 02:36:41,044
Sure.

2752
02:36:41,604 --> 02:36:43,704
But I'm not waiting to promote season two.

2753
02:36:43,724 --> 02:36:45,024
I'm plugging season one.

2754
02:36:45,024 --> 02:36:46,344
Get people thinking about it.

2755
02:36:46,344 --> 02:36:48,924
I want people thinking and me and Giffin.

2756
02:36:48,924 --> 02:36:50,764
We want to get American made in there.

2757
02:36:50,784 --> 02:36:51,224
I know.

2758
02:36:51,444 --> 02:36:52,264
Turn off Jack.

2759
02:36:52,444 --> 02:36:54,804
Take a break from rewatching Jack Ryan.

2760
02:36:54,984 --> 02:36:55,324
I know.

2761
02:36:55,324 --> 02:36:57,284
America has Jack Fever.

2762
02:36:57,864 --> 02:37:00,424
I want them to move over and get Lyme disease.

2763
02:37:01,324 --> 02:37:03,944
This is Maisel isn't the only marvelous person.

2764
02:37:04,184 --> 02:37:05,084
And Arthur.

2765
02:37:05,204 --> 02:37:08,264
Isn't the only neurotic Jew on Amazon Prime.

2766
02:37:08,544 --> 02:37:11,244
Let's get a little Arthur representation going on.

2767
02:37:11,484 --> 02:37:15,004
That's what I'm waiting for is the big like Arthur meets Maisel.

2768
02:37:15,024 --> 02:37:15,884
Oh yeah.

2769
02:37:15,884 --> 02:37:17,604
Full stones meet the Jetsons.

2770
02:37:17,944 --> 02:37:18,664
You got to do that.

2771
02:37:19,704 --> 02:37:21,404
You got to learn how to talk faster though.

2772
02:37:21,644 --> 02:37:23,184
I can talk pretty fast.

2773
02:37:23,204 --> 02:37:23,824
Speed it up.

2774
02:37:24,584 --> 02:37:27,864
But watch that please and Blink Check with Giffin David.

2775
02:37:28,084 --> 02:37:29,404

So happy to have you.

2778
02:37:32,104 --> 02:37:33,604
What else on our end?

2779
02:37:34,444 --> 02:37:37,364
Like we said for hot pizza riso.

2780
02:37:37,564 --> 02:37:40,564
Hotter than the pizza itself which may be lukewarm.

2781
02:37:40,864 --> 02:37:42,264
That's what it sounds like.

2782
02:37:42,384 --> 02:37:45,324
Go to Patreon.com slash podcast the ride.

2783
02:37:45,324 --> 02:37:47,184
We can have it out by the time this comes out.

2784
02:37:47,204 --> 02:37:47,864
Yeah probably.

2785
02:37:47,924 --> 02:37:49,444
