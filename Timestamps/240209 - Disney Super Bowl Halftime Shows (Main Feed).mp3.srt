1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,500
Forever.

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:03,540
Dog.

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:12,580
Podcast The Ride in association with Coca-Cola, Oscar Mayer, and AOL Top Speed presents a salute

4
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:15,900
to Disney's Super Bowl halftime shows.

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:23,460
With special appearances by Tony Bennett, Mickey Rooney, an army of Shirley Temples, Fake Mickey,

6
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:31,160
Fake Goofy, and Jason Sheridan as Mae West, the Podcast The Ride show about Disney's Super

7
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:34,560
Bowl halftime shows starts right now!

8
00:00:54,740 --> 00:01:00,640
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, a podcast about theme parks which, listeners can attest, has

9
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,960
caused more brain damage than professional football ever could.

10
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm Scott Gertner, there's Mike Carlson.

11
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,940
Oh man, you saying that though means the class action lawsuit is coming.

12
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:11,260
Oh yes, oh god.

13
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,640
You've admitted to that.

14
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:14,560
Well, shoot, we got, I'll edit it, I'll remember.

15
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,100
There's no way to prove it, I mean, because like, if you're, look, we're causing brain

16
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:22,800
damage, you know, blank check, Doughboys are causing brain damage, I mean, like, all of

17
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,800
there's no way to pinpoint it to us.

18
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,640
Oh, I see what you're saying.

19
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:31,260
There's so many people poisoning the brains of listeners that there's no way to say what

20
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:32,600
damage caused what.

21
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:37,720
But I definitely want to, you know, if doctors do a scan on the brain and like, now that

22
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:46,800
deposit there, that is your knowledge of Nick's owner, James Dolan, having done a song about

23
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,440
how Harvey Weinstein, he should have known Harvey Weinstein did the stuff that he did.

24
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,220
That's right, so we see that on the X-ray.

25
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,400
Where do you think that could have come from?

26
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,820
What could have put you at risk for that?

27
00:01:55,980 --> 00:02:01,980
So until imaging technology catches up, we won't be put into some sort of massive trial.

28
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,800
We wouldn't be, we have to like go to jail.

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,040
It's easier now for like AI to scan the transcript of a podcast, so we're against the ropes on

30
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:16,200
that, but then really if we can eventually scan a brain to see what awful fact we specifically

31
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,720
have poisoned the listeners with, then we're in a lot of trouble.

32
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,780
This is Jason Sheridan, huh?

33
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:23,740
I feel like it's a very concentrated dose today.

34
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:27,700
You know, no placebo, no saline solution.

35
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:32,540
This is like, this drink in the cold brew concentrate without watering it down.

36
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,860
That's a pretty good point.

37
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:39,620
Yes, absolutely, because this is a true brigade of nonsense today.

38
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:41,780
Yeah, garbage factory.

39
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:48,040
This is definitely, yeah, yeah, this will be nothing but garbage and we'll explain why.

40
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:53,540
I mean, it's, you know, it's because it's Super Bowl weekend and this is our big Super

41
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:59,880
Bowl episode and you know, we know what you come to us for in a Super Bowl episode, so

42
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,320
I'll just kick it off.

43
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:04,860
Conventional wisdom holds of the Chiefs are a lock with Patrick Mahomes having completed

44
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,960
70% of his passes with the yards per attempt average of 7.

45
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,200
0 in his previous six postseason

46
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,460
games, but one mustn't ignore the stacked 49ers offense with Brandon Iuke leading the

47
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:17,740
league's receivers in catch score and Deebo Samuel leading all receivers in YAC score.

48
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:21,960
So, is it possible that the presumed to win Chiefs will be haunted by sloppy offensive

49
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:25,400
play like McColl-Hardman's goal line fumble against the Bills in the divisional round?

50
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,420
Michael, let's start with you.

51
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:31,920
Well Scott, I really would like to gather my thoughts.

52
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:35,200
Yeah, no, no, no, I didn't mean to, of course, take your time.

53
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:38,160
Well, we'll go to Jason Sheridan's thoughts then in the meantime.

54
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:44,120
Well sure, as long as the main player on the field today is good sportsmanship, then everyone

55
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:44,560
wins.

56
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,860
Dang, that actually is a good thought.

57
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,340
You said a real thing.

58
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:49,820
I couldn't have come up with that.

59
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:53,400
I had to write all that down, all that stuff I just said that I'll admit.

60
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:54,300
I don't know what it means.

61
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,400
I was going to say, you shouldn't have admitted that.

62
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,500
Yeah, yeah, jeez.

63
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:04,480
And I'm waiting for the Chiefs to win, Taylor Swift to run on field and say the magic words,

64
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:08,800
I support Joe Biden, let the new world of wooder begin.

65
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,860
I just learned of this for the first time.

66
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:17,340
Because I've certainly seen a lot about can Taylor make it from Tokyo, but I didn't realize

67
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:23,440
that was the concern and that what are like MAGA wine moms trying to like form some kind

68
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:30,660
of blockade between here and Tokyo so that she can't come tip her sheep listeners into

69
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:36,860
voting for, who otherwise assuredly would be Trump supporters one and all, but they're

70
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:39,860
also said, you know, they're such dummies.

71
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:42,040
They might all flip just because Taylor said so.

72
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,660
Yeah, I didn't realize this until recently that the rumor is that she's a CIA, what she's

73
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:48,080
a CIA?

74
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,320
She's an op, yeah, sure.

75
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,280
Yeah, that's the rumor.

76
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:54,300
And that's being like pushed by like some pretty big conservative accounts.

77
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,060
Just insane conservative.

78
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:56,840
You can't tell.

79
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,360
And then I saw other conservatives posting like, please stop doing this.

80
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:01,820
Please stop saying this.

81
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,780
You sound stupid.

82
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,060
We look stupid now.

83
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:04,420
Please.

84
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:08,140
That's the best hope we have is all of them tearing each other apart, you know.

85
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,940
But yeah, I know it's a Psyop.

86
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:14,460
It's a Psyop that's been going since 2009-ish.

87
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:21,900
It seems as though for 15 years or more, we've heard a lot about this Taylor Swift.

88
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,600
There must be something to it, right?

89
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:30,980
She was a Psyop planted in 2009 to stop the eventual presidential, not first run because

90
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:35,520
he did win the first, but the reelection of Donald Trump after a loss, which was planned

91
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,560
as part of the Psyop.

92
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:37,160
Yeah.

93
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:41,080
No, I, it's really, it's really something.

94
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,440
Let's just put it that way.

95
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:43,020
Yeah.

96
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,560
It's really something to see that take hold.

97
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,320
There might be something to it.

98
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:48,400
That's for our listeners to decide.

99
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,740
Or just asking questions.

100
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,600
As usual, that's all we're doing.

101
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:55,020
We wouldn't say anything is fact.

102
00:05:55,580 --> 00:06:01,020
No, one thing Taylor Swift is not doing this year is the Super Bowl halftime show.

103
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:01,360
Right.

104
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:04,900
Well, oh, well, I guess so.

105
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,780
This is more of the like kind of pop culture.

106
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:15,320
It's like there are, she, like her and Usher have done like, like, co-labs.

107
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:17,320
Like she was performing Atlanta.

108
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:21,060
He came out and they did, yeah, she sang Ludacris' verse.

109
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:22,640
I've never seen that clip.

110
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,140
Yeah, it's on, it's on YouTube.

111
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:29,920
So people are like, okay, if she gets there and then she has time to watch some of the

112
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,440
game and then change and then get down for the hit.

113
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:33,920
It sounds miserable.

114
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:38,840
I don't think she's going to like, but she doesn't want to take the focus off of Travis

115
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,640
Kelsey.

116
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,160
She doesn't know.

117
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:42,780
Like that's going to be his day.

118
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:43,500
It's his day.

119
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,220
She's a supportive person.

120
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:48,220
I think she wouldn't be like, well, I'm going to outshine him.

121
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:49,100
I think.

122
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:54,720
Not to mention that I think that appearing on the Super Bowl would be like a downgrade

123
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,940
100% would be.

124
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:56,220
For her.

125
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:01,700
I'm not sure.

126
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:05,140
Okay, I was going to say one, but I don't know what she's on at this point.

127
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:08,560
I was going to say one post would be more, but does she post?

128
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:09,200
I don't know.

129
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:10,720
You're the Swiftie.

130
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,380
This is who you.

131
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,620
I'm social media.

132
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:13,040
I don't know.

133
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:13,920
I'm not following her.

134
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,680
I don't know that she has such a presence.

135
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,420
Maybe I don't follow her Instagram.

136
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,660
Maybe I should do it right now.

137
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:23,800
I have the Instagram account Camporama just loaded up for this episode.

138
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,040
Camporama?

139
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:25,860
Yeah, yeah.

140
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,280
But I'll get onto Taylor Swift's Instagram.

141
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:29,500
What's on Camporama?

142
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,580
Well, it's all different camp clips.

143
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,880
Because what we're going to be talking about today is camp.

144
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,420
This is all pretty campy.

145
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,380
It's all very campy.

146
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:36,680
Well, is it?

147
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:39,280
Yeah, but it's, I'd say unintentional camp.

148
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:44,820
Well, that's a discussion to have about what is the intention of this camp, I think.

149
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,460
It's very much closer.

150
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:51,540
It's not that Super Bowl halftime shows we know now where it's like.

151
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,340
I'm at Taylor Swift's Instagram.

152
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,920
All right, yeah, we heard applause.

153
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:56,100
I didn't mean to do that.

154
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,780
You interrupted Jason's flow.

155
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,500
Sorry, Jason.

156
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:07,000
These Super Bowl halftime shows are much closer to like icecapades or a pageant.

157
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:08,200
They're little skits.

158
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,740
There's a lot of little skits.

159
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,060
Very much so.

160
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:14,880
You know, there literally was, we won't be talking about this one today, but there was

161
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:18,060
an icecapade at the halftime.

162
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:25,560
Before the one, before Michael Jackson tipped it forever into what it is now, which is like

163
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,620
big elevated concerts, basically.

164
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:34,160
There was one that I think was a bridge too far, which was ice skating on the, they brought

165
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:41,400
out little tiny ice rinks, you know, because the skaters surely won't need, you know, like

166
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,740
many feet of run up.

167
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,220
Yeah, you could just do a jump.

168
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,900
You got four feet here.

169
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,300
That rink's as wide as you are.

170
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:49,520
Yeah.

171
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:51,140
Or wide as you are long.

172
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:58,220
But yeah, they did do icecapades live in the halftime show at one point, which I think

173
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:00,600
was kind of a bridge too far.

174
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:05,600
That's where they decided maybe we need to make this entertainment less stupid.

175
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:11,000
But let's paint the full picture here as we focus on Super Bowl halftime shows.

176
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:17,040
The very first one ever to take place was in 1967.

177
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:21,800
And that was not one, but two marching bands.

178
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:26,200
And when you got two marching bands, you can make at least two shapes.

179
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,360
I think that's what they did.

180
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:31,760
I think the marching bands played, they made two shapes and that was the end of that.

181
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,560
They called that a day.

182
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:39,560
Today of course, it is usher for kind of our entire lives at this point.

183
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:47,340
It has been like a concert by a major pop act, a big one, an elevated one with probably

184
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:51,280
some production design and sometimes some fairly theme parky nonsense.

185
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:57,900
And it's almost usually, I believe, the instruments are recorded, pre-recorded, and the vocals

186
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:58,460
are live.

187
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:04,680
Yeah, maybe it's kind of like a, it's a relatively impossible thing to, because they have to,

188
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:09,700
the scramble to put these things together, to assemble the stage in a matter of five

189
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:16,220
minutes then connect everything well enough for live music to be played.

190
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,640
It's possible Prince's guitar was live for the Prince halftime show?

191
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,340
I'm not sure actually.

192
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,020
You don't think the rest of the band was?

193
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:24,380
I don't know.

194
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:29,460
Because that's what I've heard is like the band is never, there's just no way to soundcheck

195
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:30,140
it that quickly.

196
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:33,540
You can't set everything up in two seconds and soundcheck everything.

197
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:34,900
Well, I mean.

198
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:35,820
I'm not sure though.

199
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:40,140
Rehearsals, I think, have long been an issue with these things.

200
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,300
One of the, we'll get to today, I believe, was maybe none of them.

201
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:48,260
A lot of them, at least for many years, were never rehearsed in full before being performed

202
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:51,260
in front of the biggest audience possible on television.

203
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:54,540
That's…

204
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:55,200
No, no, no.

205
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:58,620
We have a narrow focus here, which I'll explain.

206
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:03,020
Basically, you know, if you think about the whole history of it, the nearly 60 year history

207
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:11,660
of it, from two marching bands to big concerts, it's kind of this gradient, really, that gets

208
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:12,660
you from one to the other.

209
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,820
And I think they step it up every year.

210
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,700
They increase the entertainment value.

211
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:22,280
But there's a point in that gradient, the middle of that gradient, especially in the

212
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:27,460
70s and 80s, where the Super Bowl halftime show was comprised of a lot of what I will

213
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:29,520
call razzle dazzle crap.

214
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:44,540
Just like ill-conceived, huge in scope, but limited in its concept or like, I'd say embarrassment

215
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:46,160
is involved in a lot of cases.

216
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:51,900
Yeah, the phrase I have in my head from watching this stuff now is like dorky camp.

217
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,300
Like lame camp.

218
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:59,420
In the sense that, obviously, the pinnacle I think of camp is like Batman, the 60s Batman.

219
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:02,380
It's funny, but it's colorful and it's silly and whatever.

220
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:07,380
But then there's this stuff which is like very cringe when you see a lot of it.

221
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:11,900
But it is also similarly silly and colorful and a bunch of nonsense.

222
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:12,980
Well, that's my question.

223
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:19,060
If you bring camp into it, I think some amount of purpose has to be involved.

224
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:23,380
Awareness has to be involved in almost any of this, is there?

225
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:26,800
I don't agree that there has to be purpose to have camp, though.

226
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:31,100
I think that something can have camp value and it's like you're watching it.

227
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,300
I don't exactly know.

228
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,980
I don't know the entomology of the term.

229
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,200
I don't know either, I guess.

230
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:40,060
But to me, when something itself is campy, like they knew.

231
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:46,660
But it's campy to watch something that's old and embarrassing or whatever.

232
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:47,580
I don't know.

233
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:49,320
That's my broad theory.

234
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:49,700
But I could be wrong.

235
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:50,140
You might be right.

236
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,680
I mean, I see what you're saying.

237
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:56,580
So there's a very popular Instagram account called Camporama.

238
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,640
There's like 150,000 followers on it.

239
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,400
I am one of them.

240
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:05,320
And it goes anywhere from Liberace stuff to like Elaine Stritch doing her one woman show.

241
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,720
And it looks like it's a pretty wide ranging amount of stuff on here.

242
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,140
Some purposeful, some not.

243
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,440
Now, I don't know that this account is the authority on it.

244
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,980
But it seems right.

245
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,700
That's a weird if they're cataloging it.

246
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,420
There's some confidence in the opinion.

247
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:20,660
Right.

248
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,480
There's some Eartha Kitt performances.

249
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:26,140
There's, you know, what's her name?

250
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,680
The woman who played the Wicked Witch of the West doing a Maxwell House commercial.

251
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:33,340
Like there wasn't probably that wasn't purposeful camp.

252
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,320
But you know.

253
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:36,100
So yeah.

254
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:41,880
So are we getting full podcast, the right episodes about every single post on Camporama?

255
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,980
Well, I see Agnes Moorhead from Bewitched.

256
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,520
So the answer is yes.

257
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:45,780
Great.

258
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:46,200
OK.

259
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,300
Put it in the queue.

260
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:49,500
I love this account.

261
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:55,940
Or if nothing else, put them in the Club 3 poll to get about three or four percent in

262
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:56,820
the final running.

263
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:57,900
Negative three.

264
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,400
How do they do that?

265
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:00,820
How do the audience vote?

266
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,460
I didn't know there were demerits in the Patreon voting.

267
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:08,900
Patreon is truly iterating and updating the usability.

268
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:09,960
They don't want to hear.

269
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:15,420
They don't want to see this clip from the Love Boat of Ruth Gordon with Bernie Kapell.

270
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,020
They don't want to hear 30 minutes on this.

271
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:18,980
What are they singing?

272
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:20,240
Just go to random part.

273
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:20,760
What is it?

274
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,340
What's happening?

275
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,240
Let me see.

276
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:23,480
Mrs.

277
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:27,380
Warner, I forgot I've got a performance emergency app in deck to me.

278
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:29,620
No, on myself.

279
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,400
She's hitting on Bernie?

280
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,560
I think so.

281
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:34,280
It's a love boat.

282
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,900
But I'm not dressed.

283
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:38,520
It's a long clip.

284
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,160
It's a long clip.

285
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,680
Yeah, no, I put you on the spot.

286
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,560
You haven't vetted that.

287
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,460
You haven't watched that.

288
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,460
It was worth getting into.

289
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:47,860
I was just like, you know, there better be hardcore Bernie Kapell, Ruth Gordon making out

290
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:48,180
in this next five minutes.

291
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:48,960
That might be what would come out.

292
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,600
Yeah, yeah, you never know.

293
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,560
Well, update us later or just leave it playing in a loop while we do the rest of this.

294
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:59,760
But anyway, Razzle Dazzle Crap is at least what's in my head.

295
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,120
You don't have to use that term, but I will.

296
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:09,260
And over in the years that were kind of the pre-pop culture awareness, the Razzle Dazzle

297
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:14,360
Crap years, a lot of these events were perpetrated by the Walt Disney Company.

298
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:19,300
And that is what we're going to be focusing on today, because I've been wanting to do

299
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:22,200
a halftime show episode for some time.

300
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,800
This has been in my mental queue.

301
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,380
But I want to credit a user.

302
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:29,880
Did I write down their names?

303
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:36,980
Yes, Mark Gannon and Casey Lucas on Club 3, our VIP Patron tier, both of them suggested

304
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:39,820
that we on Club 3, but we're doing it here on main feed.

305
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:44,760
The suggestion was to focus on the halftime shows produced by the Walt Disney Company.

306
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,040
And I thought that's a great idea.

307
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,920
That's a good way to like, all right, we'll take care of these.

308
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:56,460
And if people are into this, then in success, we can, because there's a lot of other, there's

309
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:58,580
so many insane halftime shows.

310
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,240
Oh my God.

311
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:00,860
Yeah, yeah.

312
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:01,560
So much.

313
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:07,020
And I honestly, you know, I'm maybe aware of like the ones while I've been alive more

314
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,680
than the ones before I was alive.

315
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:13,320
I don't, I'm not sure I've ever watched any from the 70s and early 80s until this.

316
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:18,660
Clearly there's a lot to get into because on the way to Disney doing it, before Disney

317
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:23,820
did it, I believe the fourth one, as I was saying, I think it's this ramp up where, all

318
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:26,160
right, it's going to be some marching bands and that'll be nice, right?

319
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:31,080
But then this thing gets more popular, more pop culturally relevant.

320
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,080
It's big on television.

321
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:36,460
So maybe we got to do a little more to pull in the viewers at home.

322
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:41,120
And maybe a good idea would be to have celebrities, famous people as part of this.

323
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,380
And yeah, that sounds good.

324
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:43,720
Sure.

325
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:44,400
Who do they get?

326
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,860
Carol Channing.

327
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,900
Carol Channing was the first one.

328
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,860
She's on Camperana all the time on the Instagram account.

329
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:50,880
I would have to imagine.

330
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,560
She's there all the time.

331
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,980
A Camperama mainstay.

332
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:55,480
That's right.

333
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:57,980
Now, I have not seen footage of this one.

334
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:02,160
I don't know if anyone saved footage of this one, but apparently that's Super Bowl Four.

335
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:07,560
And apparently that one involves not only Carol Channing, but also a restaging of the

336
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:12,240
Battle of New Orleans, complete with terrified horses and falling soldiers.

337
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,040
Oh my God.

338
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,880
Not prepared on that one.

339
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,540
Maybe to come in Super Bowl halftime.

340
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:21,780
Well, they got the accuracy of the Battle of New Orleans.

341
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:25,940
There were definitely some falling soldiers and terrified horses.

342
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:26,560
Oh, yeah.

343
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:31,620
Maybe they got it exactly right, because probably, you know, there's recreations of battles.

344
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:32,740
This happens in the world.

345
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,860
But I bet that if you just watched battles from really far away for the most part, it's

346
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,880
just a bunch of, it's a big confusing mess.

347
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:39,460
Oh, yeah.

348
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:40,720
It's not some ballet.

349
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:45,140
No, it's not even as cool as Lord of the Rings armies meet.

350
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,040
Like it's, yeah.

351
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,620
I can't, I cannot imagine.

352
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:47,940
Yes.

353
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:51,660
The Civil War was as cool to watch as Lord of the Rings.

354
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:52,580
No, no, no, no.

355
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,500
But anyway, yeah, these are the early years.

356
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:02,020
I mean, it's one of those things where, boy, is The Simpsons parody so accurate.

357
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,560
That one where, are they watching the literal Super Bowl?

358
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:09,780
Is it the Lisa the Greek episode where she's betting on football and there's a snippet

359
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:15,700
of a halftime show and it's an alien in a suit and they sing one, two, three o'clock,

360
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,080
four o'clock, you're on a rock around the world tonight.

361
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:24,220
And I think I saw that and thought, you know, when I was a kid, I'm like, yeah, Super Bowl

362
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:25,620
halftime shows are kind of cheesy.

363
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:29,140
And then not until I've seen some real ones, am I like, that is exact.

364
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:33,020
Like that could have that literally could have been something that they did, at least

365
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:33,760
in the early ones.

366
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:41,280
See, I jumped to the other Simpsons reference of the variety show, Hooray for Everything.

367
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:47,860
And it's like kids dressed in sock hop attire, but they're singing Walk on the Wild Side.

368
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:48,760
Oh, right.

369
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:49,120
Right.

370
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:49,320
Right.

371
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:50,260
That's another thing they did.

372
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:50,900
Oh, that's right.

373
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:51,300
Yeah.

374
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,520
Hey, kids.

375
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,440
Yeah, that's extremely accurate, too.

376
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:00,920
There's I just want to say the the 1976 halftime show, which we're not going to talk about

377
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:05,160
today, but it was called 200 Years and Just a Baby, a Tribute to America's Bicentennial

378
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:10,780
and Up With People, Up With People did that one, which is what they were like

379
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:12,140
parroting on the Simpsons as well.

380
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,460
Hooray for Everything is a parody of Up With People.

381
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:17,360
And I'm not prepared to talk about Up With People.

382
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,980
I don't quite understand what it is.

383
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,620
I didn't know if it was a group.

384
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:26,020
But what I'm finding is that maybe it was it's more akin to like an organization.

385
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:28,500
Yeah, it's like a big volunteer organization.

386
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,200
It's a nonprofit.

387
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,860
It's a non-profit.

388
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:31,600
Yeah.

389
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:36,480
I can't imagine Up With People didn't ultimately turn a profit somehow

390
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,300
with their jazzy rhythms and cool harmonies.

391
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:43,260
Oh, Jason, could you put on a one man show called 200 Years and Just a Baby,

392
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,080
a tribute to America's Bicentennial?

393
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:50,800
Well, it'll be like baby New Year, except I will enter in the diaper

394
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:54,220
in the sash and I will also come out at the end in the like.

395
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,780
So I don't age at all.

396
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,400
Oh, yeah.

397
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,260
So it's a lot.

398
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,880
It's plenty, baby.

399
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,520
Maybe you do whatever we find.

400
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:01,580
I think it will.

401
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,140
It'll be plenty, baby, for me.

402
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:03,780
That's for sure.

403
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:04,900
I don't even need you in a diaper.

404
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:08,080
I just wanted you doing whatever the old time songs they perform in here.

405
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,780
Well, you have your methods to prepare and I've mine.

406
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,400
Hey, I'm not going to fight you being in a diaper.

407
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,540
Jason, Jason insists on the diaper.

408
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,080
Fight me on this.

409
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,560
Fight me until I end up in a diaper.

410
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,140
He's taking his clothes off right now.

411
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:20,860
What?

412
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:21,740
No.

413
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:23,100
All right.

414
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,820
Well, here's one of my daughter's diapers.

415
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:25,960
Put it on.

416
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,300
You're going to have to stretch it a bit.

417
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,540
Put four of them together.

418
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,620
Anyway, it seems like Up With People was one of the main providers

419
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:37,620
of this entertainment, of the extremely white bread entertainment

420
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:40,080
for the first 15 years or so.

421
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:43,380
And the other, the Walt Disney Company, because the NFL can't put

422
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:44,460
these things on themselves.

423
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,820
They are busy with the game and the other games.

424
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:51,000
They need to reach out to entertainment entities to do these things.

425
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:56,000
And Disney enters the picture for Super Bowl 11, which is in 1977.

426
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,760
And I think they especially,

427
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:02,200
at least initially, would do the halftime shows when it's in

428
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,820
when the Super Bowl is in California or Florida.

429
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:08,240
Makes sense to be near their parks, near their facilities.

430
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,820
And they have access to tons of dancers and costumes and musicians and all that.

431
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:15,720
So absolutely makes sense.

432
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,400
Disney would would be part of these.

433
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:22,280
So I have more about these as they go on.

434
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:26,280
But I'll try to step through what I learned about the initial,

435
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:29,160
the early Disney Super Bowl halftime shows.

436
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,260
So Super Bowl 11, 1977.

437
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,740
This was at the Rose Bowl.

438
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:35,060
Raiders versus Vikings.

439
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,700
The I don't have much here.

440
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,100
I picked a pretty arbitrary clip,

441
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:47,440
but this, I think, will give you an idea of just the tenor of the entertainment.

442
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:52,380
And it's not exactly a far cry from up with people, from what I can tell.

443
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:57,540
So here's here's just a random little bit of what Disney provided in 77.

444
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,080
And it is love that you give

445
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,560
and will that you'll keep this time.

446
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:22,540
Yes, it's lanky, very pale people kind of doing

447
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:24,080
they aren't even moving.

448
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:26,540
No, they're not like dynamic dancers or anything.

449
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,660
Kind of it's just like synchronized,

450
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:33,320
the half speed arm pumps basically in Mickey Mouse

451
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,920
sweater vests and bright red pants.

452
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:40,980
This is I mean, I know there was a lot like this in the 70s.

453
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:43,780
We've delved into our 70s variety shows.

454
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:48,380
But I do always flash to like punk was happening, you know?

455
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,040
Oh, yeah.

456
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:49,680
Yeah.

457
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,500
The talking heads were going on.

458
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:52,320
Oh, yeah.

459
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,360
Early hip hop.

460
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:53,880
Yes.

461
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:54,440
Yeah.

462
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,360
We're almost at hip.

463
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:57,740
No, I literally Googles synthesizer.

464
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,520
I was watching again.

465
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:02,040
I started getting on down rabbit holes of non Disney produced.

466
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,580
And I was watching 92, which has some great stuff in it.

467
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:09,400
And then I was like, wait, I'm like Guns N' Roses was popular.

468
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,860
Like the biggest record.

469
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:14,840
We're almost we're almost at the grunge turn.

470
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:15,420
Of course.

471
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:16,080
Yeah, yeah.

472
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,060
I was just like, when it's OK.

473
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:18,920
All right.

474
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,820
It's like I'm sure that current like who they currently book

475
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:26,940
is not like exactly up to speed, typically with the year.

476
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,720
And like what's what's cool.

477
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:31,400
That's not what you look for in the Super Bowl necessarily.

478
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:34,820
But it's at least like we're we're like in the same.

479
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,380
We're in the realm of the same like two decades typically.

480
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:41,400
You know, we aren't in another planet in terms of relevance.

481
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,480
Like you're on another planet.

482
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:42,900
Yeah.

483
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:47,660
It feels like now it's it's not necessarily the biggest act

484
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,280
of that year or two.

485
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:51,980
You know, it's not Taylor Swift or Beyonce.

486
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:58,580
It is someone well into their like, you know, well established

487
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:03,300
and recognizable across the country and internationally.

488
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:04,280
Yes.

489
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,980
But not like just like, all right.

490
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:11,160
I'm just going to wind it down a little, go a little slower,

491
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,960
do a Vegas residence and not that point.

492
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,980
Like, you know, sure, sure.

493
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,460
Recent hits, probably.

494
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,100
Probably unless they mash a bunch of people up together,

495
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:21,520
which they do sometimes as well.

496
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,500
Maybe somebody's not on their own.

497
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,200
What they feel is a big enough draw.

498
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,560
But if you put a bunch of people in there, maybe it works.

499
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:31,680
Yeah, it can be like a big who they have a few years.

500
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:36,160
Was it like Eminem and 50 Cent and Snoop and Dre?

501
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:40,700
But that was kind of a consistent theme of like all of the Dre accolades.

502
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,680
Yeah, that was sort of his history.

503
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:46,540
Well, I think you see less of the mashup of a ton of people

504
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:50,100
since the infamous MTV Janet.

505
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:53,620
I think they blamed the format for what happened.

506
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:54,500
You see.

507
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:58,540
Well, of course, I mean, the Brittany Aerosmith in sync.

508
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,420
That might need to get a little time in the if we do another one of these.

509
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,900
So non Disney, one of these.

510
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:04,320
Oh, yeah.

511
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,820
I have vivid memories of that.

512
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:08,780
So TV did a like behind the scenes of how they did it

513
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:11,000
to see and Sink and Aerosmith together.

514
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:12,680
It fit hand in glove.

515
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:13,440
I know.

516
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:17,520
It always it feels to me like that Super Bowl was always trying to be like, well,

517
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:22,040
the halftime show was for a different crowd to entice people to want to watch it.

518
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,840
Like people who wouldn't usually be watching.

519
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:25,140
Right.

520
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:27,560
And that still seems that's still kind of what they're doing.

521
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:33,000
It's just that their approach back then to me seems a little bit misguided.

522
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:33,440
I don't know.

523
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:35,160
We were people really excited about these.

524
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:35,940
That's a good question.

525
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:39,840
I think the approach back then seemed to be like, let's see if we can get grandma

526
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,360
in from the next room.

527
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:41,700
Sure.

528
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:42,500
So it is.

529
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:45,360
I guess it's the same thing because if they were to have like

530
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:50,160
Aerosmith now or the Rolling Stones, I'm grandpa.

531
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:51,760
I'm like, get grandpa in here.

532
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,300
And I'm like, oh, I would like to look at the Rolling Stones.

533
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,660
The Rolling Stones with us.

534
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:55,860
Sure.

535
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,600
Now I'm listening.

536
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,340
I'm excited.

537
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,460
But when I Springsteen played like 10 years ago, I was like,

538
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,860
I'm going to see this Super Bowl.

539
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,280
I really want to watch it.

540
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,280
And yeah, so I guess it's always been the same

541
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:09,280
same goal and different approaches.

542
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:09,660
Sure.

543
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:12,420
But we've aged and we've at least like we're.

544
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,700
Yeah, that's where we're at.

545
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:16,420
We're at entertainment that has been relevant in the last century.

546
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,000
Weekend.

547
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,640
The weekend does it, which grandpa doesn't know necessarily

548
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,760
who the weekend is.

549
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:22,540
Now they spelled this word wrong.

550
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,920
What's the why they drop that?

551
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:25,880
Where are the where's up with people?

552
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:28,860
Why are they up with people on here anymore?

553
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:29,940
Up with people.

554
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:32,880
I'm having a going concern for 20 years.

555
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:33,400
All right.

556
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,880
Well, I'm going back in my room and my den.

557
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:40,800
The other notable facts about this one,

558
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:43,160
they didn't know how to film these yet.

559
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,320
So there's a lot of you see that.

560
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,760
Yeah, you see the shadow of the helicopter a lot.

561
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:51,500
There's a we get the first ever introduction of the new Mousketeers,

562
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:55,820
the 70s ones who did that Disney World special, which was OK.

563
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,360
That's on Disney Plus.

564
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:01,880
And just general about the 77 Super Bowl,

565
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:06,020
two of the Raiders played high on weed that they brought from

566
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:08,540
that they bought from Anthony Kiedis's father,

567
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:11,640
whose name of course is Blackie Dammit.

568
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:13,040
Yeah, I did know that actually.

569
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:14,900
You knew his name was Blackie Dammit.

570
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:15,900
I've heard that.

571
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:19,800
And what Kiedis's stage name was another he was a different dammit.

572
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:20,740
Right.

573
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,700
Yeah, because he was a kid actor.

574
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:27,640
This comes knowledge comes new to me just a few days after

575
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:33,560
Michael Buble apparently played the NHL All-Star game on mushrooms.

576
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:34,760
What?

577
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:35,260
What?

578
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,640
Michael Buble, really?

579
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:41,200
Yeah, I think he thought he was being given a micro dose.

580
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:43,280
Yeah, it's very small dose.

581
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,020
Yeah, I know.

582
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,660
I've missed this story.

583
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:47,760
Given a very large dose.

584
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,920
That seems hard to do to play on mushrooms.

585
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,480
Yeah, I don't know.

586
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:53,760
I don't know how his play was.

587
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,440
Oh, you know, maybe you wait.

588
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,640
So he played like this wasn't him doing a concert in a show.

589
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,480
This was he played hockey.

590
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,000
Yeah.

591
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:02,440
Geez.

592
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:03,620
Oh, OK.

593
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:04,580
Oh, that's neat.

594
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:09,020
One of the one of the hockey seems even too dangerous to do.

595
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:12,780
One of the there's a book on the shelf.

596
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,500
My mom got me, which is Anthony Kiedis's autobiography

597
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,960
a few years ago.

598
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:19,420
Your daughter's bedtime story.

599
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:20,920
And no, that's where I'm at.

600
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:21,620
Maybe I said this already.

601
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:25,420
That's the book she walks over and picks up off the shelf all the time.

602
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,320
Wow.

603
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,260
There's so many photos of her taking Anthony Kiedis's book off.

604
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:31,200
But is there nudity on the cover?

605
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,020
Well, he's he's got his ripped body on the cover.

606
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,260
So I know when you don't want to teach her to be uncomfortable

607
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:37,820
with situation on the cover.

608
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:41,500
And she doesn't like watching Bluey or Peppa Pig.

609
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:46,400
She likes watching like Daisy Jones in the Electric Six and like

610
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:51,060
Dennis Leary's Sex and Drugs and Rock and Roll.

611
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,940
Yeah, she likes fake bands on TV.

612
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:56,460
She likes Sunset Strip stuff, right?

613
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,460
She loves Sunset Strip stuff.

614
00:28:58,880 --> 00:28:58,880
Yes.

615
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:00,600
So she yeah, she's already into Rock and Roll.

616
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:01,780
Sunset Strip stuff.

617
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:04,420
You heard the Rock and Roll over here.

618
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,960
Where Rock goes, you know.

619
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:08,320
Where Rock was born.

620
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,680
Where Rock goes.

621
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:10,760
Where Rock goes.

622
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,100
Grandpa, go back in your day.

623
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:12,980
Wait a minute.

624
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,180
Is Rock goes a phrase in the world?

625
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:17,080
Where Rock and Roll go.

626
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,940
Where folks go for Rock.

627
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:23,800
Oh, I thought you were saying that we collectively are Rockos.

628
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,600
Oh, I like that term.

629
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,840
And then Rock and Roll fans are Rockos.

630
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,460
Well, yeah, of course, Rock and Roll fans are Rockos or Rollers.

631
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,580
I think we should.

632
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,980
I think you've coined a new term that I'm going to use on this show,

633
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:34,940
that I'm a Rocko.

634
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:35,760
You are a Rocko.

635
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,640
I'm a Rocko.

636
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,800
I'm a real Rocko.

637
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,740
I'm a real Rocko.

638
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,120
What can I tell you?

639
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,200
Wow.

640
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,220
But they weren't, you know, in 77,

641
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:46,220
they aren't appealing to the Rockos yet, other than.

642
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:46,580
Yeah.

643
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:49,500
Other than these two Raiders, who, by the way, the Raiders won.

644
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,860
So thank you.

645
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:51,680
Secret weapon.

646
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:52,720
Blacky, damn it.

647
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,240
That's right.

648
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:57,140
You know, so we're stepping

649
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:02,820
hopefully further into where pop culture is actually at,

650
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:07,380
as Disney produces the half time show at Super Bowl 18 in 1984.

651
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,940
Although not really, because

652
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:12,780
national anthem is Barry Manilow.

653
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:18,000
And Manilow, I would say, is kind of the tone of the rest of what happens here.

654
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:23,140
This one, by the way, in Tampa, Raiders versus recently renamed Washington team.

655
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:24,880
That I will not say on Mike.

656
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,180
84 is the year of the the famous 1984 commercial.

657
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:31,020
The Big Apple.

658
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:31,440
Yeah.

659
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:31,960
Oh, yeah.

660
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:34,940
Scott Add, which is very cutting edge.

661
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:38,260
Very like, you know, now there is like a pop culture defining moment

662
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:42,320
at the Super Bowl, a little more so than what Disney produced that year,

663
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:47,200
which was called a sparkling salute to superstars of the silver screen.

664
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:50,860
That will be another one man show Jason does in a doper.

665
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,940
But a sparkly diaper.

666
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:58,420
Oh, I like the big skin.

667
00:30:58,780 --> 00:30:59,860
That Jimmy Stewart.

668
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:00,840
Yes, Jimmy Stewart.

669
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:06,540
Jason Sheridan plays 200 stars of Hollywood Dior.

670
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,100
Oh, my God.

671
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,240
I'll write that for you.

672
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:09,080
You'll do it.

673
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:13,580
Every time he spins around, he becomes a new guy.

674
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:14,540
Cary Grant, go.

675
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:17,080
Well, let's.

676
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:17,580
Hello.

677
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,220
Yeah, great.

678
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:20,820
I was trying to do Cary.

679
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:23,220
I was thinking in my head for a couple of minutes, like,

680
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:24,840
what does Cary Grant sound like?

681
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,020
Mae West, go.

682
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,480
Come up and see me sometime, big boy.

683
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:30,180
Yes.

684
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:30,600
Wow.

685
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:31,180
All right.

686
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:31,560
Excellent.

687
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,900
That was that was pretty good on the fly.

688
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:36,000
Barry Manilow, I believe also on Camporama often.

689
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:36,640
No, sure.

690
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:37,540
That makes sense.

691
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:37,900
Yeah, yeah.

692
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:38,380
We are adding.

693
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:40,220
There's adding evidence to my theory.

694
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:40,700
Sure.

695
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:40,960
Sure.

696
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:42,860
Also a big microdozer, famously.

697
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:43,400
Yeah, of course.

698
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:47,580
So, you know, this one, I also I don't have clips of this one,

699
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:51,100
but, you know, there's but people have big letters that spell out

700
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:54,820
a ray for Hollywood and they sing a ray for Hollywood.

701
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:58,960
And they, you know, they sing about that screwy,

702
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,540
ballyhooey Hollywood.

703
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:04,460
This song is less and less relatable to me as the years go by.

704
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:09,500
And as Hollywood is more and more terrible to watch the products of

705
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:13,880
and work in, as I get really kind of tired of both the screwy

706
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:16,720
and ballyhooey nature of the business.

707
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,640
It's hard to imagine the optimism in a song like that.

708
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,020
Yeah.

709
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:23,960
But I do think, OK, just as I list what happens in this one,

710
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:27,640
there's like, you know, the thing where like two guys share a big sparkly piano.

711
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,100
Yeah.

712
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:32,740
And there's like big Southern bell dresses like Gone With the Wind style.

713
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:37,120
And they sing You Oughta Be in Pictures and Stepping Out With My Babe.

714
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:41,580
And then there's like the field is covered in people with with white tuxes.

715
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:45,560
And I was watching this and thinking like, Jason, are you the are you going to end up

716
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:49,000
the last person alive who likes this kind of thing?

717
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,780
You'll be the last human on Earth.

718
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:57,140
I you know, I think I like it in proper context.

719
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:59,800
It's weird to see in a Super Bowl halftime show.

720
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:03,980
And you are talking about right now that 1984 show.

721
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:04,420
That's right.

722
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:04,600
Yeah.

723
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:06,000
I don't want to jump too far ahead.

724
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:10,400
But 1987 is also a tribute to Hollywood.

725
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:13,100
Why, in fact, yes, you might.

726
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:17,080
If eagle eyed viewers might notice that there is not a world of difference

727
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:21,380
between a sparkling salute to superstars of the silver screen

728
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:25,780
and three years later, Hollywood, the land of make believe.

729
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:29,960
The Hollywood, the land of make believe they at least kind of tenuously

730
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,100
there are like it's 100 years of Hollywood.

731
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:38,060
And I'm like, oh, yeah, those 1887 bangers.

732
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:43,080
So it's like a person walks from right side of the screen to left side.

733
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:45,720
Child observes sunflower.

734
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:46,400
Yeah.

735
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,720
I yeah, you're right.

736
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,400
And look, I'm more than happy to generally rush through this.

737
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,580
The only thing I want to show is not not a clip, but just a shot,

738
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:00,460
because things do kind of heat up, I would say, when Minnie Mouse joins

739
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:05,100
the festivities and she comes out, she's she's on a big throne

740
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:08,300
that's carried by a bunch of the Jungle Book monkeys.

741
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:11,540
And she's in like Carmen Miranda garb.

742
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:13,980
And we all collectively will be the final people on earth

743
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:16,900
who know what the reference Carmen Miranda is.

744
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:19,780
I've never seen a Carmen Miranda film, no, I will.

745
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:23,360
I but I do know when there's a bunch of fruit on your head, that's what it is.

746
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:27,380
But anyway, this shot really, this still, I think, kind of tells you

747
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:30,960
all you need to know, which is that Minnie is brought up on this pedestal

748
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,400
and then she's surrounded by a bunch of like strong guys.

749
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:35,540
Yeah, hunks.

750
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:36,100
Yeah.

751
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,340
Like, yeah, yeah, these guys are beefcakes.

752
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:41,460
These guys are even like bigger than your average body,

753
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:44,860
I feel like the time maybe like they're like not maybe to Arnold.

754
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:48,180
So closer to that, though, closer to the Arnold side of things.

755
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:49,260
So, yeah, they are.

756
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:53,100
I'm just I'm just trying to say how punky they are and how muscly they are.

757
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,620
I'm just trying to paint a picture for the listener.

758
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:55,680
Yeah, yeah.

759
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:57,280
They got suspenders on.

760
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:00,080
Are you upset to see them in the frame with oh, with many?

761
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:00,380
Yeah.

762
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:01,980
Well, I mean, it makes me feel less of a man.

763
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:02,340
Yeah.

764
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:03,260
If that's what you're saying.

765
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,960
And if you were if this was your POV and you were trying to get to her

766
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:10,140
for for a quick hug, if she sees that, if you make eye contact

767
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:11,760
and she acknowledges that she wants it,

768
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,500
I'd get beat up by these hunky firefighter guys.

769
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:15,960
Yeah, I wouldn't want that to happen.

770
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:16,340
Yeah.

771
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:16,880
Excuse me.

772
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,440
Miss Mouse, seeing other guys today.

773
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:20,960
Hey, did you tell her I'm here?

774
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:22,380
Tell her Michael is here.

775
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:24,500
I'm trying to get through here.

776
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:25,880
She met me in Florida.

777
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:27,400
She had a fireman.

778
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:27,720
Mr.

779
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,640
Fireman, get out of my way.

780
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:33,260
I have half a mind to suck you right in the nose.

781
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:36,940
And then, yeah, then I just get knocked out with those suspenders.

782
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:40,640
Pull one back and fire it right at your nip.

783
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,340
Hey, don't dance at me.

784
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,740
Get away from me.

785
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:45,160
It's not thrusting.

786
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,480
So some very strange cameos in this one.

787
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,280
Oh, wait, what are you talking about?

788
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:53,780
87.

789
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:54,640
Yeah, 87.

790
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,780
Let's officially move to 87.

791
00:35:57,340 --> 00:36:00,380
Maybe one of the strangest opening bits I've ever seen.

792
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:00,800
Yes.

793
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,340
These as we said, these are kind of the same,

794
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:07,100
but technically we do move to Super Bowl 21.

795
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,240
This is 1987.

796
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,140
We're back at the Rose Bowl.

797
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,820
Neil Diamond does the national anthem.

798
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:13,580
That's a treat.

799
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:17,660
That's I can't imagine a better national anthem singer than Neil Diamond.

800
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:19,140
Broncos V.

801
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:19,360
Giants.

802
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:23,460
And this one is the debut of the I'm going to Disney World commercials.

803
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:26,180
To be covered separately as its own episode.

804
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:30,380
I would imagine that being a thing that Eisner slash his wife thought of.

805
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:31,740
Anyway, yes.

806
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:35,480
Hollywood, the land of make believe big big gets in this way.

807
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:38,600
You know, there is again, we're not in the age of star power yet.

808
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:41,900
In the halftime show, we're still with up and up with people.

809
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:44,920
No real stars to speak of in 84, but 87.

810
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:45,960
Hold the ball game.

811
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:46,660
Yeah.

812
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:47,500
Yeah.

813
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:51,860
It opens with a shot of the Hollywood sign.

814
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:57,800
And I believe also the Mickey Mouse balloon known as Air Force One.

815
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:58,240
Yes.

816
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,520
Separate episode that we already have covered.

817
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:01,840
Yeah, we have covered your forest.

818
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:02,520
We don't worry.

819
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:04,500
We've talked about the big Mickey balloon.

820
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:04,840
Right.

821
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:10,360
And then the camera zooms out or tilts down a little and you see the seven dwarfs.

822
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:15,080
And then you see Snow White being escorted by someone.

823
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:18,960
And I could not make out who it looked like someone who was melting.

824
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:21,800
And then it snapped in my in my attic clicked.

825
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:23,740
And I was like, oh, it's George Burns.

826
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:24,660
Yes.

827
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:26,600
And that is a perfect segue.

828
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:29,460
You've painted the scene perfectly for this clip to be played.

829
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:33,840
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr.

830
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:34,780
George Burns.

831
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:36,160
Thank you, Snow White.

832
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:37,740
Pretty girl.

833
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,420
A little too old for me.

834
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,600
Well, Hollywood is now 100 years old.

835
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,020
It's only nine years older than I am.

836
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:48,540
Maybe when I'm 100, they'll put my name up there.

837
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:50,960
If they don't, I'm moving to Burbank.

838
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:54,260
OK, now on with the show.

839
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,360
So I feel about that Burbank slander.

840
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,500
But yeah, besides that, OK.

841
00:37:59,720 --> 00:37:59,960
All right.

842
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,540
If you had to go blue, George.

843
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:02,200
Yeah, George.

844
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:07,580
Very strange joke about Snow White being too old for him,

845
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:11,680
followed by a joke about him being younger than Hollywood.

846
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:12,520
Oh, yeah.

847
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,080
Slightly from 19.

848
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:14,480
What?

849
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,640
What are the movie release?

850
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,340
Yeah, I guess they mean that's probably mean that I don't mean what she is in the movie,

851
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,080
which is what I don't actually know.

852
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:21,760
But 15.

853
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:23,560
Yeah, but my guess is 15.

854
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:24,480
They were all 15.

855
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:24,940
Yeah.

856
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:30,140
Every princess was probably until Disney started making up the stories themselves.

857
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:30,940
They were all.

858
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,160
Yeah, I think that's probably right.

859
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:37,360
So, yeah, a little weird George Burns cameo at this point.

860
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:41,960
I believe George Burns, the biggest star ever on the halftime show.

861
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:42,600
Oh, wow.

862
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:43,420
Maybe that's right.

863
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:44,720
Defeating Carol Channing.

864
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:45,860
Wait, there's one more.

865
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:47,620
Who is on it in the early days?

866
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:48,060
Oh, yeah.

867
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:49,440
Oh, it's let me build up here.

868
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,220
Oh, Andy Williams, Andy Williams.

869
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:52,720
Mm hmm.

870
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:54,420
George Burns is a bigger star.

871
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:55,540
Yeah, yeah.

872
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,480
Jazz legend Pete Fountain.

873
00:38:58,020 --> 00:38:59,320
Oh, all right.

874
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:00,540
So I do think George.

875
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:04,740
So with that cameo, George Burns' biggest star in the history of the show.

876
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:06,980
But well, Fitzgerald in 72.

877
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:08,040
Really?

878
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:08,520
Yeah.

879
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:09,280
Oh, OK.

880
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:09,960
That's good.

881
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:10,720
That's a real.

882
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:11,180
All right.

883
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:11,920
OK, that's real.

884
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:12,800
Oh, I didn't realize.

885
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:13,180
All right.

886
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:16,320
So there would be actual popular musicians sometimes.

887
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:20,100
But George Burns didn't show up in person.

888
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:23,600
So you can't technically say George Burns' biggest star ever on the field.

889
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:27,860
For that, you have to wait one more minute for the show to begin

890
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:32,920
in earnest where a bevy of marching band players

891
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,480
are playing and marching.

892
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:38,920
And they are led by another one where you got to squint at first.

893
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,080
Who am I looking at here?

894
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:44,420
Oh, but that spirit, that invigorating spirit and his

895
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:46,500
the steps of his tiny legs.

896
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:49,820
Why, that can only be the great Mickey Rooney.

897
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:53,660
He is kind of going for it.

898
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:56,940
Like he is really jumping around.

899
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,740
Flailing, flailing arms akimbo.

900
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:06,300
And if I did the math correctly, he would have been 67 years old

901
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:07,320
or thereabouts.

902
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:09,780
He was born in I looked at 1920.

903
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,440
And now we're at 87.

904
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:13,200
So, yeah, 67.

905
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:17,280
Even though you might watch him and guess he is 103.

906
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:22,720
George Burns is in 87.

907
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,300
He died in 96.

908
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,520
So he is in his early 90s.

909
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:27,560
Wow.

910
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,260
Did he make it to 100?

911
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:30,540
He did make it to 100.

912
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,200
He passed it and even under it.

913
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,040
Oh, OK.

914
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:33,940
Yeah.

915
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,360
So, yeah, the Mickey Rooney.

916
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,380
And I don't have a clip because he doesn't do it.

917
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:41,740
Nothing would work for audio.

918
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:45,820
But you see, you just got to imagine the most most excited

919
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:47,160
Elvin man.

920
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:51,200
He is just I mean, the more stories you hear about in the legend of him

921
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,100
and how insane he was grows and grows.

922
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:58,200
And then was it what podcast was it on this network of somebody

923
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:02,240
was playing clips from Mickey Rooney's like not made reality show?

924
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,300
Oh, double threat.

925
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:03,880
Oh, it's double.

926
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:04,800
OK, I miss this.

927
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:10,520
Yeah, there are crazy clips of you having like fits with his wife.

928
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:13,980
And I guess they shot a pilot or something or you can find on YouTube.

929
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:16,420
But it looks insane.

930
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:17,060
Wow.

931
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,500
Like I'm there's of course, when you see this, you go,

932
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,400
no one should put this on TV.

933
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,340
It should not be on TV.

934
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:26,100
This kind of the grab of like the post Osborne's like this.

935
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:26,380
Yes.

936
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:26,640
Yeah.

937
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:27,460
I'll do it now.

938
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:28,640
I do it.

939
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:28,960
Yeah.

940
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:33,420
And then that with all the stories for like Dana Carvey and Nathan Lane.

941
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:33,720
Right.

942
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:34,980
We're on a sitcom with him.

943
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:35,480
Yes.

944
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:38,660
Strangely produced out of the 30 Rock building.

945
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:39,200
Right.

946
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:39,720
Yes.

947
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:40,980
Typically being talk shows.

948
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:44,640
And for some reason, they're doing this Mickey Rooney sitcom there.

949
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,940
One of the boys are doing one of the boys.

950
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:50,600
He was like carrying a gun all the time or something.

951
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,560
Just like it seems like out of his mind.

952
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:58,100
And got to watch out for pickpockets within your own crew.

953
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:58,860
Yeah.

954
00:41:59,060 --> 00:41:59,380
Yeah.

955
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:03,300
So the Mickey Rooney like any I've never heard

956
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:05,720
or I've never seen a bad clip of Mickey Rooney.

957
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:08,380
I've never heard a non entertaining story of Mickey Rooney.

958
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:08,920
Yeah.

959
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,140
Let me put it that way.

960
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:11,320
And he was on Eagle Heart.

961
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:16,060
Our pals, Weinberg worked with I don't think I've heard any tape.

962
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:18,360
But that's one of his final credits, I believe.

963
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:18,660
Right.

964
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:20,040
Because he died in 2014.

965
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:20,700
Wow.

966
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:21,100
Geez.

967
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,400
They got him right towards that.

968
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:26,040
I don't wish we'll have to ask if it's if we can share it publicly.

969
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:26,480
We will.

970
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:28,540
If not, we'll just laugh on our own time.

971
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:29,160
Uh huh.

972
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:33,460
But yes, you got some real and you know what you get in this moment

973
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:36,600
is Mickey Rooney and Mickey Mouse arm and arm.

974
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:37,640
It's delightful.

975
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:39,000
Hollywood's two great.

976
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:39,400
Yeah.

977
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:44,040
Yeah, that's this is this is maybe my favorite moment in any halftime show

978
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:47,540
other than the Prince guitar solo during Purple Rain.

979
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:48,160
Tied.

980
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:48,540
Yeah.

981
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:50,640
Prince solo and

982
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:51,260
Mickey Rooney.

983
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:51,740
Arm in arm.

984
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:53,040
Two Mickey and two mix.

985
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:53,400
Yeah.

986
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:53,980
Same thing.

987
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:56,040
Same same level of excitement for me.

988
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:59,400
You were all at the Prince one started and you're like, all right,

989
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:01,040
let's let's see what you got.

990
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,360
Can you top it?

991
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:05,720
Was it could a Mickey Rooney have been there for that?

992
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:06,360
Is he alive?

993
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:07,920
And when is Prince halftime?

994
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:08,700
2007.

995
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:09,680
Oh, yeah.

996
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,780
Then of course, easily you could have had Mickey Rooney

997
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:14,700
hand in hand with Prince during that halftime show.

998
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:18,640
So when they do like the big sheet and his like guitar looks like his dick,

999
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:19,540
looks like his dick.

1000
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:22,960
And then the sheet comes down and Mickey Rooney is just there.

1001
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:28,640
Prince disappears and Mickey Rooney is in his place in a little purple suit.

1002
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,420
Give it up for my inspiration.

1003
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:33,060
The could have been me with that.

1004
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:35,880
If you're blue and you don't know where to go to.

1005
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,260
It's going to be in the show.

1006
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:38,400
That's what I put on the Ritz.

1007
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:38,960
Yeah.

1008
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,920
Put on the Ritz is in this one, right?

1009
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:41,880
I think so.

1010
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:43,720
I or it was in the last one.

1011
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:45,100
It's a lot of them.

1012
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:46,120
It's been in all of them.

1013
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:49,740
Every halftime show, actually, if you look at it, every halftime show until

1014
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:53,440
2005, the 80s, the Janet Jackson.

1015
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:54,420
That's what you don't remember.

1016
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:55,800
That's what Timberlake came out to do.

1017
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:56,260
That's right.

1018
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:56,500
Yeah.

1019
00:43:56,620 --> 00:43:57,140
Putting on the Ritz.

1020
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:58,440
Mickey Rooney was there, too.

1021
00:43:59,640 --> 00:43:59,640
Yeah.

1022
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:01,920
What is this filth?

1023
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:02,520
Cover up.

1024
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:03,060
Yeah.

1025
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:04,220
He threw a towel over.

1026
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:05,840
I reached my little hands up.

1027
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:07,980
Get that Mickey Rooney was there to throw a towel on.

1028
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,800
That was my supposed to be my areola jewelry.

1029
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:11,640
Hey.

1030
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:13,860
Yeah, he threw a fuck.

1031
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,100
What did I get these for?

1032
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:18,080
If not to be not to show them off on TV.

1033
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:20,080
Yeah, they had to remove them from the building.

1034
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:21,060
You're so upset.

1035
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:25,900
Um, there is a medley of like Western songs.

1036
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:29,160
You know, they do like Magnificent Magnificent

1037
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:31,320
set Magnificent Seven.

1038
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,880
The Ghost Riders in the Sky.

1039
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:35,400
Ghost Riders in the Sky.

1040
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:38,360
There's kind of an odd goofy singing.

1041
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:40,080
Kind of odd.

1042
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:42,480
I don't know how to even fully.

1043
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:45,120
Like it sounds doesn't sound like something's wrong with goofy.

1044
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,160
It's a pretty off goofy.

1045
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:49,640
We've talked a lot about wrong Mickey.

1046
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:50,620
Right.

1047
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:51,700
OK, you asked.

1048
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:55,300
But this is definitely a wrong goofy here.

1049
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:58,440
Not to, you know, let's not clear out

1050
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:01,300
the Western segment if we're not done with it.

1051
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:02,920
But while we're talking about weird goofy,

1052
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:06,540
I think you get some weird goofy in this during which.

1053
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:07,260
Oh, that's right.

1054
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:07,600
OK.

1055
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:10,380
So as Jason said, Western stuff.

1056
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:14,680
So there's a bunch of horses around,

1057
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:18,660
which I recognize from park specials, like the type of horse that they would have

1058
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:22,540
kind of weird upright with tiny T-Rex arms.

1059
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:23,120
Yeah.

1060
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:25,980
But then they move on

1061
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:31,720
from Western stuff to like Indiana Jones and then like Flashdance.

1062
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:33,980
But the horses are still there.

1063
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:38,400
So it's a bunch of like dudes in yellow,

1064
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:43,180
like glittery sleeveless shirts and then a bunch of horses.

1065
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:45,720
And they are all dancing to this.

1066
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:03,220
I'm turning it loose.

1067
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:07,340
That sounds like Yosemite Sam.

1068
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:08,300
Yeah.

1069
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:11,400
Turning up loose or turning it loose.

1070
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:11,940
Yeah.

1071
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:13,780
I said turning up loose.

1072
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:15,740
Yeah.

1073
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:17,940
Weird, goofy, weird, goofy.

1074
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:21,980
There's all like this also speed runs the history of Hollywood,

1075
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:25,760
where it's like a lot of hooray for Hollywood Westerns.

1076
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:27,800
And then immediately like

1077
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:31,140
Indiana Jones and Flashdance.

1078
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:33,280
And that's our current thing.

1079
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:34,000
That's a lot.

1080
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:35,560
That's kind of what a lot of stuff was like.

1081
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:37,700
And like, yeah, as if they didn't feel

1082
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:41,540
probably what it is, is they were mad at like that whole 60s, like

1083
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:45,020
rebellious, graduate, easy, right?

1084
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:45,620
That kind of stuff.

1085
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:47,100
And like, yeah, but what about come on?

1086
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:49,300
What about the spectacle, the razzle dazzle?

1087
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:53,980
Well, it's sort of my memory in the early 2000s when they would do

1088
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:56,880
montages, they would begrudgingly squeeze in

1089
00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:01,700
a shot from Lord of the Rings and the shot of Renee Zellweger.

1090
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:05,100
And Catherine Zeta-Jones from the end of Chicago

1091
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:07,220
doing the big musical number.

1092
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:10,300
And that was like, and this is modern Hollywood.

1093
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:12,800
And now let's wrap it up.

1094
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:14,900
You know, and that's in the end.

1095
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:18,560
And that when they're doing that, Chicago was 13 years prior.

1096
00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:20,580
We're still celebrating Chicago.

1097
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:24,380
And that's as current like 2002, 2003.

1098
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:28,600
That's as current as like history of Hollywood gets.

1099
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:32,200
Like you can see when little snippets and then later on, it's like

1100
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:34,280
there's one shot from Avatar.

1101
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:36,160
Ten years are moved from that.

1102
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:38,740
Babylon, that's what we really got.

1103
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:40,700
Babylon ends the same.

1104
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:45,020
If you've never seen it, Babylon ends the same way as the great movie, right?

1105
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:48,680
You just suddenly get this montage of great movie moments.

1106
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:50,680
And I've only seen that part.

1107
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:52,700
I don't know what the rest of Babylon is.

1108
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:55,500
I jumped right to the end because people made me aware

1109
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:57,820
that Avatar is in Babylon.

1110
00:47:57,820 --> 00:47:58,520
Wow.

1111
00:47:59,320 --> 00:47:59,760
Really strange.

1112
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:03,200
And then something else is it like Tron?

1113
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:05,820
I think it's I think it's original Tron, maybe.

1114
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:07,700
Oh, it's like a highlight reel.

1115
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:09,060
Yeah, it's like a guy.

1116
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:15,020
A lot of those montages Tron in Star Wars for like special effects.

1117
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:15,500
Yeah.

1118
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:17,040
And look what we can do now.

1119
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:20,100
I think it's like somebody who is watching a movie

1120
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:23,700
and whenever you're Babylon is set and it's like he can't even

1121
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:25,740
imagine what's coming for him.

1122
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:29,060
Tron, Avatar, that's pretty much it.

1123
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:29,680
Oh, OK.

1124
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:30,240
It's weird.

1125
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:31,380
I don't I don't understand.

1126
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:34,600
But anyway, if you like the great movie ride and you miss it, see Babylon.

1127
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:40,020
I have heard that there is Toby McGuire plays an absolute maniac in Babylon.

1128
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:42,300
And it's like, well, that's worth it to see.

1129
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:42,880
Sure.

1130
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:43,340
Yeah.

1131
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:46,360
Big disappointment, though, is that they didn't like the great movie ride,

1132
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:48,980
include good morning, Vietnam.

1133
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:54,400
I think that for years riding that ride, I'm like, well,

1134
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,500
that's one of the most important movies.

1135
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:57,420
Yeah.

1136
00:48:57,420 --> 00:48:57,560
Yeah.

1137
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:59,660
If you're going off of that, if you're if you're trusting

1138
00:48:59,660 --> 00:49:03,460
that you are in a history of film seminar when you're on that ride,

1139
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:06,460
then like, OK, well, one of the primaries must be.

1140
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:10,200
Do you think anyone has pitched a great movie ride movie

1141
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:12,020
in the last few years?

1142
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:14,180
Oh, kind of as multiverses?

1143
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:14,920
Yeah.

1144
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:15,600
Well, just because.

1145
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:18,720
Because, yeah, Disney has so many different like I'm sure.

1146
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:23,500
I think probably there's 50 projects all based on rides that they're having.

1147
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:26,640
They're paying people to do something with, but they'll never make.

1148
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:29,940
But especially post haunted mansion, it ruined it for everyone.

1149
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:30,400
Yes.

1150
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:33,640
But you think I wonder if there's any great movie ride

1151
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:38,480
movies in the pipeline, if the Favreau Magic Kingdom

1152
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:41,200
movie got made and was a huge hit.

1153
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:44,060
Oh, well, and they're just like, then there would have been every.

1154
00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:45,320
Got to do every park.

1155
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,220
Yeah, we got to do every ride, every park.

1156
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:47,540
Yeah.

1157
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:49,440
Is it so what is it?

1158
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:52,440
It's people watching movies and then a gangster comes in.

1159
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:54,120
No, I think it would.

1160
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:54,440
Yeah.

1161
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:56,520
If you're basing it on the ride or it's you know what?

1162
00:49:56,660 --> 00:50:00,440
It's the story of like what some of those Billy Crystal openings were,

1163
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:02,780
where he like falls into the projector.

1164
00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:08,140
You just now you're in here in a madcap chase through all of Hollywood history.

1165
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:12,060
And you know, some up and comer is going to be like in a tuxedo and go,

1166
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:13,840
you ain't seen nothing yet.

1167
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:16,080
You know, that's really probably everybody.

1168
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:17,860
Everybody's gunning for the Jolson Park.

1169
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:18,480
Yeah.

1170
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:19,960
That's got to be a Jolson town.

1171
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:26,100
Not half the Jolson, one half, not the necessarily the makeup of the Jolson

1172
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:29,220
Park, but the that the iconic line.

1173
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:33,580
Sebastian Stan is really gunning to be Jolson in great movie.

1174
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:34,540
Ride the movie.

1175
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:39,740
This I feel like you get a bunch of executives excited to be like,

1176
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:42,980
and then you like you're in the Wizard of Oz, but then you're an alien.

1177
00:50:43,060 --> 00:50:46,200
And they'd be like, OK, I like what this sound.

1178
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:47,560
I like the sound of this.

1179
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:48,360
Yeah, yeah.

1180
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:48,820
Yeah.

1181
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:51,320
So maybe we'll maybe we'll pitch it.

1182
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:53,660
But then what's the worst thing that could happen to you?

1183
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:54,200
I don't know.

1184
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:58,100
Say some ne'er do well coming along who likes to suck on jewels.

1185
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:01,240
Well, that's obviously that the antagonist of the film.

1186
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:04,140
And also following you through the movies.

1187
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:04,860
Yeah.

1188
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:07,060
Is this character in movie form?

1189
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:12,260
You might have to go like it's the Western hijacker and the gangster hijacker.

1190
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:15,400
Yeah, you might need to pick up a couple, pick up a couple of them

1191
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:18,700
in the different movies that also goes with them.

1192
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:24,700
And then the and then the finale of it is just the full ending of Wizard of Oz,

1193
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:27,180
except our new characters are in it.

1194
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:27,840
Yes.

1195
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:30,760
Well, the real ending is you just watch clips from old movies.

1196
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:31,140
Yeah.

1197
00:51:31,340 --> 00:51:36,380
But before that, it'll be like the climax of the right.

1198
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:38,420
The plot tension is just Wizard of Oz.

1199
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:39,740
It's just Wizard of Oz.

1200
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:41,720
And now you've got Margaret Hamilton in there.

1201
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:42,840
Now we got Margaret.

1202
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:43,480
Yes.

1203
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:46,400
We're staying in our fake Margaret Hamilton,

1204
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:49,120
because the whole movie is going to be very deep, fake, heavy,

1205
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:50,880
because you're going to need the old stars there.

1206
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:52,620
But of course, most of them are dead.

1207
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:56,400
So you'll have to deep fake it and they'll look a little creepy.

1208
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:58,200
But that's part of it.

1209
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:58,440
Yeah.

1210
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:00,340
Part of the atmosphere of this movie.

1211
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:01,420
That's what we love.

1212
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:05,540
Filmgoers in the 20 20s love to see animated courses.

1213
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:09,660
I will be happy to put the dots on my face and motion capture

1214
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:13,760
Margaret Hamilton's character so they can use my performance

1215
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:16,620
as a template for the Wicked Witch.

1216
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:19,040
I'm not saying I'm going to be perfect, but I will study hard.

1217
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:19,680
Geez.

1218
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:20,340
Be careful.

1219
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:21,320
Remember, you got to melt.

1220
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:24,180
I know I have to melt and I will melt.

1221
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:25,980
I understand that's going to be tough for them to track.

1222
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:29,660
I'm willing to take an acting class to learn to melt the way Margaret did.

1223
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:32,960
Because I want to get this right.

1224
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:34,500
This is a good pitch, maybe.

1225
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:35,880
It's probably a good pitch.

1226
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:36,480
Yeah.

1227
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:39,380
And it's of course a good pitch because Disney would be like,

1228
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:40,740
oh, we own this already.

1229
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:42,640
You know, it's just whatever.

1230
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:44,040
Well, we own the idea.

1231
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:46,440
What's the problem with most movies?

1232
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:48,840
They aren't all movies.

1233
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:49,520
That's right.

1234
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:51,240
Well, not our movie.

1235
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:56,220
We take you now to we could just send this clip to Disney right

1236
00:52:56,220 --> 00:52:58,740
right now and maybe they will take a meeting,

1237
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:02,560
especially because we want to hear this guy's take on Margaret Hamilton's

1238
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:03,060
performance.

1239
00:53:03,060 --> 00:53:04,480
We want to see it.

1240
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:06,820
He'll act it out for you in the room and the guy in a diaper.

1241
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:09,980
Yeah, he's really I like that guy.

1242
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:12,040
Now the diaper guy will be part of it.

1243
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:14,280
OK, because we're not interested if not.

1244
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:17,920
There's so many Shirley temples on the field.

1245
00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:18,620
Oh, yeah.

1246
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:19,560
Yeah.

1247
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:22,100
And then they're all wearing cowboy hats.

1248
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:25,340
And at one point, you could see a crew guy rush by to give one of them

1249
00:53:25,340 --> 00:53:28,380
the cowboy hat again, your stuff it back on the on the curly wig.

1250
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:31,220
There's a bunch of whips

1251
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:34,340
dancing cheek to cheek.

1252
00:53:35,180 --> 00:53:35,740
Happens.

1253
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:38,360
Then it all culminates in When You Wish Upon a Star,

1254
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:41,040
which I think maybe the other one also did.

1255
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:46,560
I think both of these have When You Wish Upon a Star and

1256
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:47,840
Hooray for Hollywood.

1257
00:53:48,580 --> 00:53:53,420
And literally the two shows, the eight Disney's 87 and 84.

1258
00:53:53,420 --> 00:53:55,240
Yeah, they both end with When You Wish Upon a Star.

1259
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:55,840
Wow.

1260
00:53:56,620 --> 00:53:59,500
You imagine just if today they just did the

1261
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:02,880
the 2021 halftime show again.

1262
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:03,580
Yeah.

1263
00:54:03,580 --> 00:54:06,160
Yeah, it's possible, I guess.

1264
00:54:06,740 --> 00:54:09,140
Another weird thing that kind of I notice.

1265
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:11,840
So you got George Burns, you got Mickey Rooney.

1266
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:15,680
But there were no like actresses from the Golden Age of Hollywood.

1267
00:54:15,980 --> 00:54:19,700
But then you do get the woman from Flashdance.

1268
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:21,300
Do you do?

1269
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:24,980
You get the real you mean the singer, the dancer.

1270
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:26,140
Oh, I don't know.

1271
00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:29,480
Actually, there's a flash dance sequence.

1272
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:31,800
I feel like it's the real I don't I wouldn't.

1273
00:54:32,660 --> 00:54:33,680
She gets a credit.

1274
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:35,760
She get her name comes up on screen.

1275
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:36,640
Oh, well, maybe.

1276
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:37,200
OK.

1277
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:37,920
I didn't get that.

1278
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:39,460
The real flash dancer.

1279
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:41,240
So are you you're saying, well, that's good.

1280
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:43,980
Or are you saying I want one of the classic stars from?

1281
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:49,320
Well, it was just kind of like, again, jumped decades forward.

1282
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:49,540
Right.

1283
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:53,260
So like, wait, 87 Flashdance would have come out.

1284
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:56,040
If you could around then if you could plus this one up,

1285
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:57,460
who would you like to have seen?

1286
00:54:57,780 --> 00:55:00,220
Well, I is Mae West still alive in 87?

1287
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:01,380
Oh, good question.

1288
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:03,680
I think long ago or but I'm not sure.

1289
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:07,980
Or if Shirley Temple Black came out leading that army of Shirley Temple.

1290
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:08,560
OK.

1291
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:09,660
Mae West died in 1980.

1292
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:11,080
Oh, not that long.

1293
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:12,020
OK.

1294
00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:13,100
So Shirley Temple.

1295
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:13,540
OK.

1296
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:15,300
Shirley Temple, perhaps.

1297
00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:19,540
Leading the real Shirley Temple and army of temples.

1298
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:22,320
That's going into Great Movie Ride, the movie.

1299
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:27,180
It throws you off guard because at first you're like, huh?

1300
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:28,760
But they're so adorable.

1301
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:29,500
Yeah, right.

1302
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:29,820
Yeah.

1303
00:55:29,820 --> 00:55:34,040
And then they start then they take those lollipops they got and quickly

1304
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:35,920
sharpen them, stab them into your eyes.

1305
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:37,740
They're actually have xenomorph.

1306
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:41,040
That's part of the great movie ride, the ride or the movie.

1307
00:55:41,140 --> 00:55:42,140
That's a cool backstory.

1308
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:46,820
So the xenomorph that you see in the ride you don't realize is Shirley Temple.

1309
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:47,460
Exactly.

1310
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:47,980
Yes.

1311
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:48,360
Wow.

1312
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:49,860
There was at some point a shape shifting.

1313
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:53,320
Shirley Temple took a xenomorph as a husband

1314
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:56,980
and they have alien babies.

1315
00:55:56,980 --> 00:56:00,300
And they made the opening of that's real.

1316
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:02,260
They met at the opening of Disney and James Doody.

1317
00:56:02,380 --> 00:56:02,900
Yep, that's right.

1318
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:04,000
They were happily married.

1319
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:04,720
That's in the movie.

1320
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:06,460
Yeah, we showed the wedding in the movie.

1321
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:10,620
The very ending of this thing.

1322
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:12,080
All right.

1323
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:14,580
And here's how do you go out other than.

1324
00:56:27,940 --> 00:56:28,520
All right.

1325
00:56:28,860 --> 00:56:29,540
All right.

1326
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:32,120
84, exact same thing.

1327
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:33,780
It's also fake Mickey.

1328
00:56:34,420 --> 00:56:38,400
They just they just got Disney is getting lazy at this point.

1329
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:41,820
If there's a general sense that we are not excited about the Super Bowl

1330
00:56:41,820 --> 00:56:46,540
halftime show, maybe it's because Disney showed up and cranked out the same thing twice.

1331
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:47,420
Yeah, sure.

1332
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:50,720
They brought Mickey Rooney one time, but Mickey can't make up

1333
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:53,480
for the creative deficiencies.

1334
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:54,240
Yeah, I know.

1335
00:56:54,260 --> 00:56:54,720
I agree.

1336
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:56,200
It's very lazy.

1337
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:00,960
I guess, yeah, we're not we're not into the golden age of 90s Disney yet.

1338
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:01,900
Late 80s Disney.

1339
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:04,400
So I'll blame it on some of that, maybe.

1340
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:05,460
Yeah, yeah.

1341
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:09,760
I think they let the entire 1980s pass

1342
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:14,660
without ever having a performer who was popular in the 1980s.

1343
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:15,800
There's no Madonna.

1344
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:17,780
There wasn't Michael Jackson yet.

1345
00:57:18,220 --> 00:57:20,580
There is not Springsteen for many years.

1346
00:57:20,860 --> 00:57:22,460
Certainly, there's no prince.

1347
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:23,600
Chubby Checker 88.

1348
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:26,040
I mean, he probably did.

1349
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:26,320
He must.

1350
00:57:26,420 --> 00:57:28,880
He probably did like return of the twist in 86.

1351
00:57:29,020 --> 00:57:30,060
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1352
00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:33,080
And of course, 89 Elvis Presto.

1353
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:35,780
Elvis Presto Elvis Magician Elvis Presto.

1354
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:39,180
The Elvis Magician is the biggest thing to file away for Super Bowl halftime.

1355
00:57:39,180 --> 00:57:41,240
We can't do it now, but I want to do.

1356
00:57:41,380 --> 00:57:44,500
Oh, no, it's why I'm glad we got this guidance from the listeners.

1357
00:57:44,540 --> 00:57:46,000
Just tackle the Disney one.

1358
00:57:46,020 --> 00:57:46,320
Yes.

1359
00:57:46,340 --> 00:57:49,260
And so that we can let Elvis Presto breathe.

1360
00:57:49,540 --> 00:57:51,100
OK, I just want to say the name of it, though.

1361
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:54,380
1950s rock and roll Bebop bamboozled in 3D.

1362
00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:56,280
That's the name of the show.

1363
00:57:58,220 --> 00:58:00,140
1989 bamboozled Bebop bamboozled.

1364
00:58:00,220 --> 00:58:03,280
And this is because this is the one where you went to get 3D glasses.

1365
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:05,300
Yes, you can watch 3D halftime show.

1366
00:58:05,460 --> 00:58:08,840
What could that have meant on your like fuzzy television?

1367
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:11,400
Your fuzzy four by three TV in 1989.

1368
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:15,780
But all I know is that it's one of the first songs is Rock This Town by the Stray Cats.

1369
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:17,600
So we will do it.

1370
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:18,620
Oh, well, I was wrong.

1371
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:21,280
One song from the 80s.

1372
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:21,740
That's true.

1373
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:22,360
All right.

1374
00:58:22,420 --> 00:58:23,140
The songs are played.

1375
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:24,060
Footloose is played.

1376
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:24,660
Yeah, yeah.

1377
00:58:24,780 --> 00:58:25,400
Oh, boy.

1378
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:27,320
I didn't realize I walked into Stray Cats.

1379
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:27,980
That's right.

1380
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:28,420
Bebop.

1381
00:58:28,460 --> 00:58:29,620
You were Bebop bamboozled.

1382
00:58:29,780 --> 00:58:32,480
I just got Bebop bamboozled in 3D.

1383
00:58:32,580 --> 00:58:34,240
That's another show Jason is going to do in a day.

1384
00:58:35,060 --> 00:58:35,940
Bebop bamboozled.

1385
00:58:37,820 --> 00:58:40,900
And then 3D in that one means three diapers.

1386
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:48,520
The performer credited on screen during the flash,

1387
00:58:48,780 --> 00:58:55,220
it's Marine Jahan, who was Jennifer Beals body double for the dancing sequences.

1388
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:56,640
OK, that's something.

1389
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:57,260
That's something.

1390
00:58:57,260 --> 00:58:58,340
Some legitimacy.

1391
00:58:58,800 --> 00:58:58,800
Yeah.

1392
00:58:59,080 --> 00:58:59,580
Wow.

1393
00:59:00,140 --> 00:59:04,000
I'd rather have seen Tallulah Bankhead do a performance like that in that show.

1394
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:04,780
There we go.

1395
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:05,920
Now we're talking.

1396
00:59:06,060 --> 00:59:09,060
She died in like the 60s, so she was not around for that.

1397
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:11,320
She's also on Campo around my Instagram.

1398
00:59:12,380 --> 00:59:16,260
I don't think I even I know exactly what Tallulah Bankhead is.

1399
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:20,540
She was on I Love Lucy a few times, at least once.

1400
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:22,000
Don't get mad at me.

1401
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:23,360
She was a villain.

1402
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:25,580
She was the black widow on the 60s Batman.

1403
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:27,540
OK, I thought she was a Batman person.

1404
00:59:27,620 --> 00:59:31,520
And she just was one of those with a smoke and I drink and I'm all over.

1405
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:34,100
Like she had the deep voice and she was funny.

1406
00:59:34,820 --> 00:59:36,680
You've seen her probably.

1407
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:37,980
You've seen Miss Bankhead.

1408
00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:38,620
You've seen her.

1409
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:39,420
You love her.

1410
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:42,440
You know, I get to know her really well whenever we get to the Tallulah

1411
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:43,980
Bankhead deep dive.

1412
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:46,320
I'm sure it's not too far away.

1413
00:59:46,340 --> 00:59:47,520
Right around the corner.

1414
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:50,440
Birthday is coming up in honor.

1415
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:53,360
She would have been 160 years old.

1416
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:57,760
OK, so we take you now to I'd say them, you know,

1417
00:59:58,420 --> 01:00:01,640
interior, at least in terms of amount of clips, I pulled the main attraction

1418
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:03,200
of this episode.

1419
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:07,320
And I think one of the one of the things fueling the desire for us to tackle

1420
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:11,060
Disney's halftime shows, that being what they perpetrated

1421
01:00:11,060 --> 01:00:15,100
at Super Bowl 25 in 1991.

1422
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:16,840
Bizarre.

1423
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:17,160
Yeah.

1424
01:00:17,340 --> 01:00:17,780
This one.

1425
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:18,180
Oh, yeah.

1426
01:00:18,460 --> 01:00:18,940
Perverse.

1427
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:20,080
Very strange.

1428
01:00:20,380 --> 01:00:20,540
Extremely.

1429
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:24,060
They're back in Tampa near Disney World.

1430
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:25,460
Giants versus Bills.

1431
01:00:25,460 --> 01:00:29,820
This one, 1991, is the famous Whitney Houston

1432
01:00:29,820 --> 01:00:33,720
Star Spangled Banner, probably still one of the biggest moments

1433
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:36,180
of music in Super Bowl history.

1434
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:42,980
And the important context that that provides, you know, there was the

1435
01:00:42,980 --> 01:00:47,280
they had the onus basically to do this extremely heartfelt, elevated,

1436
01:00:47,580 --> 01:00:51,820
like the greatest ever Star Spangled Banner, because we were in the thick

1437
01:00:51,820 --> 01:00:54,200
of the Gulf War at this time.

1438
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:59,340
And that colors now while this now, while Whitney Houston is this,

1439
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:04,100
you know, well remembered, one of the greatest moments of her career,

1440
01:01:04,740 --> 01:01:08,560
that it kind of does encapsulate that time in a meaningful way.

1441
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:16,320
What Disney did, perhaps less so, but we will give it its due.

1442
01:01:17,460 --> 01:01:21,220
You know, this will never get portrayed in a movie like the Whitney Houston

1443
01:01:21,220 --> 01:01:22,600
one was recently.

1444
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:26,440
But we'll we'll give it a full tribute now.

1445
01:01:27,740 --> 01:01:29,260
So, I mean, in this.

1446
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:29,560
All right.

1447
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:33,600
I think the the first person on screen

1448
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:37,940
probably explains this, you know, even better than we can.

1449
01:01:38,420 --> 01:01:41,220
Ladies and gentlemen, boy, do we have a show for you.

1450
01:01:41,460 --> 01:01:46,460
And it's an all kids cast on behalf of the 2000 children performing tonight.

1451
01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:50,860
We'd like to dedicate this halftime show to all the servicemen and women

1452
01:01:50,860 --> 01:01:53,040
who are protecting us in the Persian Gulf.

1453
01:01:54,100 --> 01:01:58,400
And now live from Tampa Stadium, it's the first ever

1454
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:01,640
all kids Super Bowl halftime show.

1455
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:06,240
All kids, all kids.

1456
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:10,980
OK, I got a got a bit of a qualm right at the top of this.

1457
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:15,000
Protecting us in from in the Persian Gulf.

1458
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:17,220
What exactly go ahead.

1459
01:02:17,420 --> 01:02:19,440
What were we being protected from?

1460
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:23,640
Because ostensibly, it was the people of Kuwait being protected

1461
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:25,960
from Saddam Hussein.

1462
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:30,760
But I don't think I realized that they tried the protecting our freedom

1463
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:33,440
bullshit during the first call for.

1464
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:35,580
We're you know, we're next.

1465
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:38,400
Kuwait's one and America's two.

1466
01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:39,600
We're going to send a jump away.

1467
01:02:39,940 --> 01:02:42,900
Yeah, so, yeah, we know

1468
01:02:43,820 --> 01:02:46,880
they're going to start sending those scuds and Jason.

1469
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:50,140
What's important is that you just shut up and watch all these kids.

1470
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:51,460
That's what's important.

1471
01:02:51,820 --> 01:02:53,920
OK, I hate to be rude, but that's what this little kid.

1472
01:02:54,540 --> 01:02:55,380
That is.

1473
01:02:55,640 --> 01:02:55,860
Yeah.

1474
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:59,860
And you know, and we'll get we'll get some stock footage

1475
01:02:59,860 --> 01:03:02,740
of the of the troops in their desert fatigue.

1476
01:03:03,060 --> 01:03:03,400
They're there.

1477
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:05,220
Why, they're the star at some point.

1478
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:08,880
But first, we kick off with this kid, this kid in the giant

1479
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:13,360
like Wide World of Sports headset in the ABC.

1480
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:16,700
You forget that they used to wear blazers with the ABC logo.

1481
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:17,520
Yeah, yeah.

1482
01:03:17,540 --> 01:03:20,540
We're like, you know, like like it.

1483
01:03:20,540 --> 01:03:22,840
You looked like you worked at the ABC Steakhouse.

1484
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:27,540
Now people don't people just go on TV with no blazers.

1485
01:03:27,540 --> 01:03:28,640
You don't even know who they were.

1486
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:30,080
I know these are the days.

1487
01:03:30,380 --> 01:03:34,180
Imagine being this kid, this, you know, he does it.

1488
01:03:34,180 --> 01:03:35,080
There's a varying degree.

1489
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:36,920
I don't want to like knock these children.

1490
01:03:37,220 --> 01:03:40,400
And I won't knock this first one, especially because imagine like, OK,

1491
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:43,840
you are now introducing the Super Bowl halftime show.

1492
01:03:44,260 --> 01:03:44,680
All right.

1493
01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:45,400
Get ready.

1494
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:48,600
100 million people are watching you kid.

1495
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:52,380
You've got a block of dialogue that you have to do in one shot.

1496
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:52,960
He is.

1497
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:54,380
He gets gets it all in.

1498
01:03:54,420 --> 01:03:54,980
He's good.

1499
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:57,840
Will I get closer to knocking other kids?

1500
01:03:57,940 --> 01:03:58,460
Perhaps.

1501
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:04,380
So this one, you know, you kind of build to it.

1502
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:07,060
But I guess I have less notes on this and more clips.

1503
01:04:07,060 --> 01:04:12,260
Basically, this is all there's a big small world overlay here,

1504
01:04:12,260 --> 01:04:16,000
which makes it one of the first Disney halftime shows to like

1505
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,260
not in a big way to one of their theme park attractions.

1506
01:04:19,620 --> 01:04:19,780
Right.

1507
01:04:20,680 --> 01:04:22,420
They also performed.

1508
01:04:22,620 --> 01:04:24,820
It's a small world in the 77 one.

1509
01:04:24,820 --> 01:04:27,680
So we're repeating ourselves once again.

1510
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:33,420
But what they didn't have was a big set that resembles small worlds.

1511
01:04:34,140 --> 01:04:39,240
And so you get your, you know, your Mary Blair, your Raleigh Crump, whatever.

1512
01:04:39,420 --> 01:04:41,040
I forget everybody worked on that.

1513
01:04:41,180 --> 01:04:47,320
But you at least get some small world aesthetics a little bit, if kind of like

1514
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:50,840
haphazard, temporary, cheap, half falling apart.

1515
01:04:52,020 --> 01:04:54,660
But anyway, that's that's what you should picture

1516
01:04:55,340 --> 01:04:59,980
is that there are in most of these shots small world vibes in general.

1517
01:05:00,820 --> 01:05:05,560
But they quickly make good on the promise of all kids

1518
01:05:06,260 --> 01:05:07,680
as we follow.

1519
01:05:08,540 --> 01:05:12,400
Basically, I think as it starts, it's all boy football players

1520
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:16,700
and all girl cheerleaders, OK, hundreds and hundreds.

1521
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:20,080
And we go to this.

1522
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:37,880
the fact that you are in Georgia.

1523
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,900
You want to get a cutie to pet.

1524
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:40,840
Yeah.

1525
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:41,360
Yeah.

1526
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:41,360
What?

1527
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:42,180
Yeah.

1528
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:44,000
So all kids have time show.

1529
01:05:44,060 --> 01:05:44,320
All right.

1530
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:48,940
Well, I assume that they won't be singing mildly sexual lyrics.

1531
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:51,040
Maybe the conservatives are right.

1532
01:05:51,420 --> 01:05:52,640
They were right then.

1533
01:05:52,660 --> 01:05:53,340
They just missed it.

1534
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:54,600
They were they were way late.

1535
01:05:54,980 --> 01:05:58,540
Isn't this worse than the than the half time than the seven tenths

1536
01:05:58,540 --> 01:05:59,480
of a second of a nipple?

1537
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:00,460
Absolutely.

1538
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:01,180
Yeah.

1539
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:02,320
Cutie to pet.

1540
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:06,740
These are children and so many of them, a thousand children.

1541
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:09,660
Also, this song stinks.

1542
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:12,820
I kind of believe with apologies to Jason,

1543
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:16,840
I kind of believe that no good song was written in the first half

1544
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:17,940
of the 20th century.

1545
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:21,560
I think this is but this is a piece of shit.

1546
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:22,980
You can't use this song.

1547
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:26,560
I know, but I'm just saying like that there's still they're still playing

1548
01:06:26,560 --> 01:06:27,340
a grandma here.

1549
01:06:27,340 --> 01:06:29,760
You know what grandma like is that football hero song?

1550
01:06:29,980 --> 01:06:30,620
Because I looked it up.

1551
01:06:30,740 --> 01:06:32,540
But did Disney make this up and they didn't.

1552
01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:34,380
That's a that's always been around for a long time.

1553
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:37,300
And it was the subject even of a Popeye cartoon.

1554
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:38,160
They did a cartoon.

1555
01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:41,420
They did a cartoon with this title and using the song.

1556
01:06:41,540 --> 01:06:43,580
I bet that's a better cartoon than this halftime show.

1557
01:06:44,740 --> 01:06:46,280
There's nowhere to go but up.

1558
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:49,920
This song is from 1933.

1559
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:52,460
It is now 1991.

1560
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:56,740
And it is in the Super Bowl halftime show.

1561
01:06:56,740 --> 01:07:00,140
How does this map is this how far back that 60 years?

1562
01:07:00,340 --> 01:07:01,780
What's 60 years from now?

1563
01:07:02,140 --> 01:07:05,840
I mean, I wouldn't put it past him that there's songs from the 1960s

1564
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:07,220
in a current halftime show.

1565
01:07:07,380 --> 01:07:08,540
Although they did level up.

1566
01:07:08,820 --> 01:07:11,720
We haven't had McCartney and Rolling Stones for for a while.

1567
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:12,240
Right.

1568
01:07:12,300 --> 01:07:14,960
I believe Usher will be primarily playing songs.

1569
01:07:15,160 --> 01:07:15,740
That's true.

1570
01:07:15,780 --> 01:07:17,280
Recorded since 1995.

1571
01:07:17,940 --> 01:07:18,860
Yes, he has.

1572
01:07:19,100 --> 01:07:19,360
Yes.

1573
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:20,100
I don't know.

1574
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:23,260
He might do a little, you know, one of Fred Waring

1575
01:07:23,260 --> 01:07:26,820
and his Pennsylvanian's classic hits.

1576
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:32,180
Did you know growing up, did you know anybody who was actually in the Pennsylvania?

1577
01:07:32,300 --> 01:07:35,980
I just came across this phrase for the first time right now,

1578
01:07:35,980 --> 01:07:40,100
and I'm trying to stay present and focus on what we're doing here.

1579
01:07:40,300 --> 01:07:45,020
But I'm like, well, I guess I'm spending the rest of the day learning about Fred Waring.

1580
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:47,240
Oh, dear.

1581
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:47,880
Come in.

1582
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,460
I discovered a new musical artist you should be hip to.

1583
01:07:50,580 --> 01:07:51,480
He's the cat's meow.

1584
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:53,400
And so are his Pennsylvanians.

1585
01:07:53,620 --> 01:07:58,620
He died in 84 at 84 in State College, Pennsylvania, where Penn State is.

1586
01:07:58,860 --> 01:08:03,180
So a rare, a roaring intro of a

1587
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:05,740
dead old man's song.

1588
01:08:07,380 --> 01:08:08,760
This is awful.

1589
01:08:09,340 --> 01:08:13,620
And then who joins this same number?

1590
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:16,420
But once again, Minnie Mouse.

1591
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:36,480
Happens here.

1592
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:40,740
First of all, OK, so I believe that who is on stage with her is

1593
01:08:41,220 --> 01:08:43,200
football great Warren Moon,

1594
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:47,340
thus immediately betraying the notion of an all kids halftime show.

1595
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:47,700
Yes, right.

1596
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:48,080
Yeah.

1597
01:08:48,260 --> 01:08:48,260
True.

1598
01:08:48,480 --> 01:08:50,480
And presumably it's not a kid in the mini custom.

1599
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:54,240
Really goes out the window towards the end of the performance.

1600
01:08:54,500 --> 01:08:55,660
The old kids premise.

1601
01:08:55,920 --> 01:09:00,600
But like with a cute little wink that you could tell someone was very pleased with themselves.

1602
01:09:00,680 --> 01:09:01,240
They're kids.

1603
01:09:01,540 --> 01:09:02,660
They're typically kids.

1604
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:07,500
But then he like he bends down when she says cutie to pet and like, what's happening?

1605
01:09:07,540 --> 01:09:08,280
Where are you going?

1606
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:11,400
And then but then luckily, it's just it's just that he like

1607
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:14,940
gets a bunch of children around him.

1608
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:15,720
What is this?

1609
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:16,440
What's happening?

1610
01:09:16,580 --> 01:09:17,800
Why did Disney do this?

1611
01:09:17,940 --> 01:09:18,720
I don't know.

1612
01:09:19,180 --> 01:09:19,480
Really?

1613
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:20,360
We're putting this out there.

1614
01:09:20,360 --> 01:09:22,760
We're going to get the DeSantis of the world.

1615
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:23,700
A lot of red meat.

1616
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:25,360
We know Ron listens.

1617
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:31,200
Well, now that he must be so excited to like go back to being a big fish in a small pond.

1618
01:09:31,220 --> 01:09:31,360
Back to basics.

1619
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:31,720
Yeah.

1620
01:09:31,780 --> 01:09:32,100
Yeah.

1621
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:37,140
Now he can like I found what I think is a penis shape in the tree of life.

1622
01:09:38,580 --> 01:09:40,160
He can just poke and prod them.

1623
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:42,880
He's just walking around Animal Kingdom with binoculars,

1624
01:09:43,060 --> 01:09:47,160
trying to find phallic shapes and all of all of the carvings.

1625
01:09:47,160 --> 01:09:50,400
Do you know that all across Disney's theme parks,

1626
01:09:50,840 --> 01:09:56,080
there are special rooms in which people are allowed to whip out their genitalia.

1627
01:09:56,500 --> 01:09:58,220
Those are called bathrooms.

1628
01:09:58,520 --> 01:10:00,400
I yes, I know they are.

1629
01:10:00,660 --> 01:10:06,180
And isn't that I say everybody should hold it until they're off property and out of our state.

1630
01:10:06,360 --> 01:10:10,880
Or there'll be a priest or a nun supervising you when you go into these rooms.

1631
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:14,340
These toilets don't even contain holy water.

1632
01:10:15,180 --> 01:10:19,820
Anyway, check out the giant convention of child pageants

1633
01:10:19,820 --> 01:10:23,340
that is currently going on at a Marriott down the road.

1634
01:10:23,680 --> 01:10:25,720
Good old fashioned fun.

1635
01:10:27,240 --> 01:10:29,080
Has he ever judged a child pageant?

1636
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:29,780
Do you think Ron?

1637
01:10:29,780 --> 01:10:30,720
He's on the way.

1638
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:31,260
He should.

1639
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:31,780
Yeah.

1640
01:10:31,860 --> 01:10:35,540
He had a tendency to party with the high schoolers he used to teach.

1641
01:10:35,540 --> 01:10:36,220
Oh, that's right.

1642
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:37,520
He was one of those guys.

1643
01:10:37,540 --> 01:10:38,060
Yeah.

1644
01:10:38,060 --> 01:10:38,300
Yeah.

1645
01:10:38,420 --> 01:10:38,860
One of those.

1646
01:10:39,020 --> 01:10:40,580
I'm going to say one of those cool guys.

1647
01:10:40,940 --> 01:10:41,840
One of those cool guys.

1648
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:44,480
That number, though, in my high school, too.

1649
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:46,140
Did you ever party with a teacher?

1650
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:49,160
No, and they didn't really come back after.

1651
01:10:49,780 --> 01:10:52,900
Did I say we had a student teacher after we graduated?

1652
01:10:53,160 --> 01:10:54,320
Come watch wrestling with us.

1653
01:10:55,220 --> 01:10:56,260
It was nothing weird.

1654
01:10:56,760 --> 01:11:00,320
Did we did we like fight with wrestle him in the front yard afterward?

1655
01:11:00,580 --> 01:11:01,380
Yeah, a little bit.

1656
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:03,240
I think you really jumped the gun with that.

1657
01:11:03,340 --> 01:11:04,520
There was nothing weird.

1658
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:09,220
If I say this, whatever else I say, in the middle of it, I realized it was a little weird.

1659
01:11:09,420 --> 01:11:10,460
I mean, he was 22 years old.

1660
01:11:10,460 --> 01:11:13,480
We were 18 and we were like doing our fake our backyard wrestling.

1661
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:15,380
It wasn't so bad.

1662
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:19,500
Did you make a point of not inviting any 17 year olds knowing there was this possibility?

1663
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:22,960
No, maybe one or two of us were 17 when we graduated.

1664
01:11:23,380 --> 01:11:24,720
Yeah, I think there was one or two.

1665
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:28,520
Wait, so were you 17 and you were 22 year old?

1666
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:30,180
No, I was 18 when I graduated.

1667
01:11:30,340 --> 01:11:30,940
Very good.

1668
01:11:31,100 --> 01:11:31,500
OK.

1669
01:11:31,660 --> 01:11:31,900
Yeah.

1670
01:11:31,940 --> 01:11:32,680
In 2002.

1671
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:33,320
All right.

1672
01:11:33,380 --> 01:11:36,380
Well, I hope I sincerely hope this student teacher checked IDs.

1673
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:40,320
I was 17 for the first couple of months of college.

1674
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:42,700
And I definitely say the little scratch.

1675
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:45,980
I'll love buying that child ticket on the bus system.

1676
01:11:46,260 --> 01:11:46,940
What child?

1677
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:48,140
Is it a child?

1678
01:11:48,380 --> 01:11:49,400
No, I didn't know.

1679
01:11:49,420 --> 01:11:49,900
No, no.

1680
01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:54,560
The the the child bus ticket under 18.

1681
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:56,100
Oh, they call that a child ticket.

1682
01:11:56,420 --> 01:11:57,980
Or they like under eight.

1683
01:11:57,980 --> 01:11:59,300
I mean, you know what he pictured.

1684
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:02,020
You're wearing like a little Lord Fauntleroy outfit.

1685
01:12:02,700 --> 01:12:02,700
Yes.

1686
01:12:03,160 --> 01:12:03,580
Yes.

1687
01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:04,320
Yes.

1688
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:06,800
This is my mother is on the bike of the bus, I believe.

1689
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:08,400
Can I have one child ticket, please?

1690
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:09,740
Take me down to the common.

1691
01:12:09,780 --> 01:12:13,200
They need the new adventure of the daredevil and Batman.

1692
01:12:13,540 --> 01:12:15,840
I am but a nine year old boy.

1693
01:12:16,140 --> 01:12:16,300
Hmm.

1694
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:17,920
Well, he is lisping.

1695
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:21,720
Some of my classmates are drinking beer and I'm afraid.

1696
01:12:22,780 --> 01:12:23,760
That's more of an Edwin.

1697
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:26,680
Well, he'll be in the Hollywood salute to Hollywood.

1698
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:28,520
And he's on CampoRum on Instagram.

1699
01:12:28,780 --> 01:12:29,480
Oh, I imagine.

1700
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:30,360
Yeah.

1701
01:12:30,720 --> 01:12:31,280
Oh, my God.

1702
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:33,360
I'm sorry, Disney would have done this in 1991.

1703
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:34,260
Why isn't Edwin?

1704
01:12:34,740 --> 01:12:35,320
Oh, yeah.

1705
01:12:35,580 --> 01:12:37,960
I just say let's let's get a deep fake Edwin

1706
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:40,140
on one of these future Super Bowls

1707
01:12:40,980 --> 01:12:42,340
for like doing something.

1708
01:12:42,380 --> 01:12:43,200
I don't know what it is.

1709
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:43,560
Sure.

1710
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:45,540
Well, you got to go viral with these ads.

1711
01:12:45,540 --> 01:12:50,080
It's so like, oh, my God, the Super Bowl actually brought back Edwin

1712
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:53,060
to a leap with Edwin for some reason.

1713
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:53,420
Wow.

1714
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:56,980
Do a leap recreated the iconic.

1715
01:12:57,460 --> 01:12:57,900
What?

1716
01:12:58,500 --> 01:12:59,520
I love to laugh.

1717
01:12:59,580 --> 01:13:00,140
There you go.

1718
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:00,580
Yeah.

1719
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:01,820
I love to laugh.

1720
01:13:02,180 --> 01:13:02,600
Yeah.

1721
01:13:03,100 --> 01:13:03,540
Yeah.

1722
01:13:03,860 --> 01:13:04,260
Sexy.

1723
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:05,080
I love to laugh.

1724
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:08,040
Finally, like a real sexy version of it.

1725
01:13:08,340 --> 01:13:11,100
But you still see the simmering sex potential.

1726
01:13:11,140 --> 01:13:12,020
We all knew it was there.

1727
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:12,620
Yes.

1728
01:13:12,620 --> 01:13:14,500
You're still sampling Ed's voice.

1729
01:13:14,700 --> 01:13:17,520
Let me make sure there's not more of this mini routine.

1730
01:13:17,700 --> 01:13:19,240
I don't remember where it goes.

1731
01:13:31,580 --> 01:13:32,040
Hmm.

1732
01:13:32,340 --> 01:13:32,580
Wow.

1733
01:13:32,700 --> 01:13:33,820
Good thing I played that.

1734
01:13:33,820 --> 01:13:35,380
Yeah, no, they need to hear that.

1735
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:37,140
Like that love boat clip earlier.

1736
01:13:38,100 --> 01:13:39,200
The audience needed to hear that.

1737
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:40,560
I'm not sure exactly what's OK.

1738
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:43,760
Well, this one I know I need to hear because we

1739
01:13:44,440 --> 01:13:46,460
that's kind of the girls routine.

1740
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:49,120
But then we get to the boys, the boy players.

1741
01:13:49,740 --> 01:13:53,780
No, not just boy players, boy referees

1742
01:13:53,780 --> 01:13:56,020
joined by Chip and Dale.

1743
01:13:56,160 --> 01:13:56,540
Uh huh.

1744
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:13,760
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1745
01:14:13,940 --> 01:14:18,520
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1746
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:20,300
It's kind of every team.

1747
01:14:20,300 --> 01:14:25,800
Yeah, kind of does can't touch us and then just starts listing like all the teams.

1748
01:14:25,960 --> 01:14:26,320
Yeah.

1749
01:14:26,460 --> 01:14:28,240
Every to make sure they're all represented.

1750
01:14:28,940 --> 01:14:30,720
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1751
01:14:30,720 --> 01:14:36,660
I also that is Chip and Dale in referee uniforms

1752
01:14:37,320 --> 01:14:40,200
all and then they're all doing the running man.

1753
01:14:41,140 --> 01:14:42,440
Yeah, it's really something.

1754
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:44,860
The only plus up to that is that I don't know if we mentioned

1755
01:14:44,860 --> 01:14:47,160
Chip and Dale are in that one with fake goofy

1756
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:50,840
and they're wearing like chaps, which is really funny.

1757
01:14:51,420 --> 01:14:53,300
It's like they're naked except for chaps.

1758
01:14:54,420 --> 01:14:55,900
And I'm sorry, I missed that.

1759
01:14:55,900 --> 01:14:56,620
Yeah, yeah.

1760
01:14:56,900 --> 01:15:00,740
If they had those outfits doing this, it would be the ultimate, I think,

1761
01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:03,180
because they're just wearing referee shirts.

1762
01:15:03,340 --> 01:15:07,660
What do you think this this stuff did in general to like the perception of Disney?

1763
01:15:08,780 --> 01:15:13,240
And like, I mean, like for our parents,

1764
01:15:13,460 --> 01:15:16,940
because like now it's I feel like it's so much more acceptable that like

1765
01:15:16,940 --> 01:15:20,360
you've got like a regular life and then you like going to theme parks.

1766
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:25,140
Also, this I think is one of these this is like one of these wedges where like

1767
01:15:25,140 --> 01:15:29,440
I like I think you might watch this and think I am never going to Disney World

1768
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:30,640
for as long as I live.

1769
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:34,160
I think this did some damage and then our podcast helped heal.

1770
01:15:34,340 --> 01:15:35,760
Yes, that's what we're doing.

1771
01:15:36,280 --> 01:15:37,480
Weak at a time.

1772
01:15:38,180 --> 01:15:42,640
I think that these things were such clusterfucks

1773
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:47,640
that ninety nine point nine percent of everyone who watched them doesn't remember them.

1774
01:15:47,820 --> 01:15:49,900
There's no memory of these whatsoever.

1775
01:15:50,440 --> 01:15:53,400
Once in a while, somebody finds them on YouTube, but there's almost no person

1776
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:58,280
like, oh, you know, it was great that that all child halftime show

1777
01:15:58,280 --> 01:16:02,340
where Chip and Dale did the MC Hammer song like nobody remembers that.

1778
01:16:02,520 --> 01:16:07,000
I don't think any halftime show was ever complemented until Michael Jackson.

1779
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:07,680
Yes, right.

1780
01:16:07,680 --> 01:16:10,600
I don't think there was anyone ever had a kind word to say.

1781
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:11,400
You think that's correct?

1782
01:16:11,560 --> 01:16:15,700
Other than maybe like, I don't know, Andy Williams wife.

1783
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:17,360
Good job, dear.

1784
01:16:17,820 --> 01:16:18,400
Yeah, yeah.

1785
01:16:18,540 --> 01:16:21,500
Maybe certain performers got a compliment, but yeah, I don't know.

1786
01:16:21,500 --> 01:16:24,200
I think you're almost giving these specials too much credit.

1787
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:24,640
Yeah.

1788
01:16:24,780 --> 01:16:26,520
You say that made people not want to go to the park.

1789
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:28,480
What year is Michael Jackson one?

1790
01:16:28,680 --> 01:16:30,040
Lately, ninety three.

1791
01:16:30,540 --> 01:16:32,320
So we're we are close to it.

1792
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:35,280
I think we are watching one of the causes of it.

1793
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:40,660
I think I think we must be like the least like it's within the two.

1794
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:42,940
That's like, OK, we need a change.

1795
01:16:43,020 --> 01:16:49,600
So at this point, we head into what I will call the hero medley.

1796
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:50,160
Yeah.

1797
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:54,260
And I don't know how much to tip

1798
01:16:54,260 --> 01:16:57,980
who we're who we're going to see midway through.

1799
01:16:58,020 --> 01:16:59,200
You know, I'll just all right.

1800
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:00,160
I'll I'll just play it.

1801
01:17:00,160 --> 01:17:01,220
I'll let him introduce himself.

1802
01:17:01,220 --> 01:17:01,720
Mm hmm.

1803
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:12,020
Here he comes.

1804
01:17:12,620 --> 01:17:13,460
Get ready.

1805
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:39,720
And however, when you loud,

1806
01:17:41,940 --> 01:17:44,080
now we get to the truth.

1807
01:17:44,520 --> 01:17:44,520
True.

1808
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:47,220
Yeah, that's the real legos.

1809
01:17:47,220 --> 01:17:49,580
But now the real heroes are Bad gusts.

1810
01:17:49,580 --> 01:17:52,440
We are in the Middle East, protection for all of us.

1811
01:17:53,760 --> 01:18:00,100
So, hey, basically what happened there visually is the field was swarming

1812
01:18:00,100 --> 01:18:06,340
with children and then they all clear out of the way as if Moses has entered.

1813
01:18:06,680 --> 01:18:09,880
They all part and like bow deferentially.

1814
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:13,000
They all take a knee, ironically.

1815
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:18,420
And then there's this big sweeping shot that pushes into just one child.

1816
01:18:18,420 --> 01:18:25,240
Now there's only one child on the stage and the most like blonde bang,

1817
01:18:25,620 --> 01:18:28,540
bowl cut children of the corn hair.

1818
01:18:29,820 --> 01:18:29,860
Yes.

1819
01:18:30,200 --> 01:18:31,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1820
01:18:31,060 --> 01:18:31,900
Yes, it's the kind of way.

1821
01:18:31,900 --> 01:18:34,660
Yeah, this would this it would make sense if you saw like a hundred kids

1822
01:18:34,660 --> 01:18:35,760
all with the same haircut.

1823
01:18:36,820 --> 01:18:38,360
It's our town now.

1824
01:18:39,480 --> 01:18:42,820
Just wait, let me let me play his little dialogue again.

1825
01:18:42,820 --> 01:18:44,060
Or actually the end of the song.

1826
01:18:53,100 --> 01:18:56,180
I was watching this with Aaron and Aaron said,

1827
01:18:56,860 --> 01:18:58,180
you know what this kid is?

1828
01:18:58,300 --> 01:19:00,920
This is real life butters.

1829
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:05,940
This is an actual alive human butters,

1830
01:19:05,940 --> 01:19:09,880
which because if you like, you know, butters sing sometimes,

1831
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:12,900
if you leave me now, you take away the big.

1832
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:14,700
And then and then is what like this?

1833
01:19:14,720 --> 01:19:17,400
We are celebrating all our tubes.

1834
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:23,380
It's like the sweetest, most sincere, too sincere for his own good.

1835
01:19:23,860 --> 01:19:25,300
Poor real butters.

1836
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:25,780
Wow.

1837
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:26,460
Real butters.

1838
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:27,380
Yeah, yeah.

1839
01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:28,120
That's cute.

1840
01:19:29,140 --> 01:19:31,260
Anyway, great job, little butters.

1841
01:19:31,580 --> 01:19:33,480
It's again, this thing is just so full of surprises.

1842
01:19:33,580 --> 01:19:35,360
And the way it zooms in, you're like, who is it?

1843
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:36,200
A big star?

1844
01:19:36,320 --> 01:19:37,860
No, just some kid.

1845
01:19:38,060 --> 01:19:43,560
Some kid singing Win Beneath Fire than an eagle.

1846
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:45,620
It's something.

1847
01:19:45,620 --> 01:19:50,120
And then but if you thought that the star power had peaked

1848
01:19:50,120 --> 01:19:54,760
with real butters, just wait till you see what they got next.

1849
01:19:57,420 --> 01:20:01,860
Ladies and gentlemen, the president of the United States.

1850
01:20:02,940 --> 01:20:05,480
Good evening from the White House to everyone in the sunshine.

1851
01:20:06,040 --> 01:20:09,600
And around the world enjoying this wonderful game.

1852
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:13,340
I can fly higher than an eagle.

1853
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:14,580
Not going to do it.

1854
01:20:14,580 --> 01:20:21,080
And then and it zooms out and Barbara's sitting next to him.

1855
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:25,360
And then that shot, I don't think she knew it had cut to her.

1856
01:20:25,900 --> 01:20:29,760
But her eyes just seemed like very wide, like she seems.

1857
01:20:30,020 --> 01:20:30,540
Oh, yeah.

1858
01:20:30,640 --> 01:20:31,940
Oh, she gives a real you're right.

1859
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,860
She gives a real side eye like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1860
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:37,340
Everything I become be nice.

1861
01:20:37,380 --> 01:20:39,100
You're America's mother, you're America's mother.

1862
01:20:39,240 --> 01:20:40,980
Be calm, be sweet, be America's mother.

1863
01:20:41,820 --> 01:20:42,960
Hide your true self.

1864
01:20:43,480 --> 01:20:45,180
From the public before game.

1865
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:49,880
What a pleasure it is to say hello to all the young people on the field tonight.

1866
01:20:50,660 --> 01:20:55,400
Looking at you, it's easy to see why America can count on a bright and hopeful future.

1867
01:20:55,680 --> 01:20:56,440
Well, that's right.

1868
01:20:57,580 --> 01:20:58,420
Well, that's right.

1869
01:20:58,780 --> 01:21:03,380
I know we're proud of our boys and all the ways they'll make America better.

1870
01:21:03,380 --> 01:21:05,740
Oh, God, I really wish he.

1871
01:21:05,860 --> 01:21:06,120
Yeah.

1872
01:21:06,180 --> 01:21:10,660
Hey, kid performers, I hope you better learn the geography of the Middle East,

1873
01:21:10,660 --> 01:21:16,140
because in 10, 10 to 15 years, some of you might be visiting.

1874
01:21:16,360 --> 01:21:17,380
You get to go.

1875
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:18,520
You get to go.

1876
01:21:19,140 --> 01:21:23,000
What little butters was he was George H.

1877
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:23,240
W.

1878
01:21:23,260 --> 01:21:24,260
He was a pilot.

1879
01:21:24,700 --> 01:21:25,240
Am I wrong?

1880
01:21:25,900 --> 01:21:27,140
Maybe something like that.

1881
01:21:27,140 --> 01:21:30,080
I just was hoping he would like actually parachute onto the field or something.

1882
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:32,280
That's really where I'm getting out of that pilot.

1883
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:36,460
MIA on November 22nd, 1963, all sorts of different.

1884
01:21:36,460 --> 01:21:36,600
I know.

1885
01:21:41,740 --> 01:21:42,580
Yeah, yeah.

1886
01:21:42,740 --> 01:21:44,720
So I just yeah, it's too bad they phone that in.

1887
01:21:44,740 --> 01:21:45,480
There was a video.

1888
01:21:45,620 --> 01:21:46,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1889
01:21:46,100 --> 01:21:47,020
That is a video.

1890
01:21:47,160 --> 01:21:50,520
The one the shot from the very much like the beginning of Cartoon All Stars

1891
01:21:50,520 --> 01:21:52,480
to the rescue, which we covered on Club Three.

1892
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:53,080
Right.

1893
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:54,160
Yeah.

1894
01:21:54,340 --> 01:21:57,520
You know, who did show up, though, is a child from every state

1895
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:01,360
whose parent is abroad in the Middle East.

1896
01:22:01,460 --> 01:22:01,800
Oh, really?

1897
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:02,520
And they're.

1898
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:02,860
Yeah.

1899
01:22:03,220 --> 01:22:04,640
That that a lot of clarifiers.

1900
01:22:04,860 --> 01:22:05,000
Yeah.

1901
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:06,100
Mm hmm.

1902
01:22:06,540 --> 01:22:07,520
Yeah, I believe he was.

1903
01:22:07,700 --> 01:22:10,740
Yes, he was a gunman or a grunman grum.

1904
01:22:10,820 --> 01:22:13,560
Oh, anyway, is grunman a type of plane?

1905
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:14,380
I think so.

1906
01:22:14,460 --> 01:22:14,900
OK.

1907
01:22:15,100 --> 01:22:15,300
Yeah.

1908
01:22:15,300 --> 01:22:16,560
You can't be a grunman.

1909
01:22:16,760 --> 01:22:18,120
No, you can't be a plane.

1910
01:22:18,420 --> 01:22:19,620
This isn't Disney's planes.

1911
01:22:21,480 --> 01:22:23,660
You think this is Disney's planes?

1912
01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:25,720
Yeah, he flew a torpedo bomber.

1913
01:22:25,960 --> 01:22:26,400
Wow.

1914
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:30,580
So, yeah, he could have like jumped out of a plane and gone to the Super Bowl.

1915
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:31,360
That's what I was saying.

1916
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:32,140
That's what I'm getting at.

1917
01:22:32,140 --> 01:22:32,720
Yeah.

1918
01:22:32,760 --> 01:22:35,160
Well, that's why that's one way that his son outdid him

1919
01:22:35,160 --> 01:22:36,940
with that cool landing on the.

1920
01:22:36,980 --> 01:22:37,560
Yeah, it's right.

1921
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:38,660
The suit.

1922
01:22:38,780 --> 01:22:39,260
Yeah.

1923
01:22:39,580 --> 01:22:40,580
A great ceremony.

1924
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:41,280
Yeah.

1925
01:22:41,500 --> 01:22:45,560
I just labeled this one Songs of Unity.

1926
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:47,280
I don't know exactly what it is.

1927
01:22:47,340 --> 01:22:48,320
Is this where characters?

1928
01:22:48,500 --> 01:22:48,720
Oh, yeah.

1929
01:22:48,760 --> 01:22:50,180
Now we got characters in the picture.

1930
01:22:50,680 --> 01:22:53,140
We're getting basically we're getting Epcotty.

1931
01:22:53,160 --> 01:22:56,420
Like they clearly went and got all the Epcot costumes because at some point

1932
01:22:56,420 --> 01:23:00,700
you see Winnie the Pooh in Canadian garb.

1933
01:23:00,700 --> 01:23:05,060
Don't forget that that in Epcot rules, Winnie the Pooh is Canadian.

1934
01:23:05,200 --> 01:23:06,160
And like a Mountie outfit.

1935
01:23:06,500 --> 01:23:06,720
Yeah.

1936
01:23:06,720 --> 01:23:06,980
Yeah.

1937
01:23:07,020 --> 01:23:08,000
Which I love.

1938
01:23:08,620 --> 01:23:09,600
That's what is there not to like about it.

1939
01:23:09,620 --> 01:23:10,860
It always makes me smile.

1940
01:23:10,920 --> 01:23:11,300
Yes.

1941
01:23:11,340 --> 01:23:11,620
Yes.

1942
01:23:11,620 --> 01:23:12,000
What is there?

1943
01:23:12,040 --> 01:23:14,340
I mean, I guess any outfit Pooh has on is good.

1944
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:14,680
Yeah.

1945
01:23:14,700 --> 01:23:17,400
But that a Mountie one, because he also has to know pants.

1946
01:23:17,640 --> 01:23:17,880
Yeah.

1947
01:23:17,900 --> 01:23:21,360
He's just wearing the Mountie jacket with the hat, I believe.

1948
01:23:21,620 --> 01:23:22,340
I think that's right.

1949
01:23:22,460 --> 01:23:22,640
Yeah.

1950
01:23:22,740 --> 01:23:22,740
Yeah.

1951
01:23:22,860 --> 01:23:23,040
Oh, yeah.

1952
01:23:23,100 --> 01:23:23,520
Just a jacket.

1953
01:23:23,620 --> 01:23:24,020
No pants.

1954
01:23:24,180 --> 01:23:25,080
I think he is.

1955
01:23:25,460 --> 01:23:25,460
Yeah.

1956
01:23:25,660 --> 01:23:26,220
That's great.

1957
01:23:26,300 --> 01:23:28,280
Which is not how the Mounties do it.

1958
01:23:28,280 --> 01:23:32,160
As far as I know, yes, that nudity was received more quietly

1959
01:23:32,160 --> 01:23:33,900
at the halftime show than others.

1960
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:35,610
Dudley Do-Right has pants on.

1961
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:40,780
Oh, yes.

1962
01:23:42,480 --> 01:23:43,200
Mickey's out.

1963
01:23:43,280 --> 01:23:44,560
Mickey's America, of course.

1964
01:23:48,520 --> 01:23:49,900
He's waving back and forth.

1965
01:23:50,180 --> 01:23:51,340
Bicentennial Mickey.

1966
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:54,180
Take that out of store.

1967
01:24:00,980 --> 01:24:01,460
And.

1968
01:24:06,740 --> 01:24:07,220
And.

1969
01:24:07,560 --> 01:24:12,680
Now, that is not By the World of Coke, but it's a song that was used, right?

1970
01:24:13,300 --> 01:24:13,340
Yeah.

1971
01:24:13,560 --> 01:24:15,660
The lyrics were changed for By the World of Coke,

1972
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:18,160
and this special is produced by Coca-Cola.

1973
01:24:18,380 --> 01:24:19,240
Oh, OK.

1974
01:24:19,540 --> 01:24:19,840
Yeah.

1975
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:20,700
Yes, right.

1976
01:24:21,060 --> 01:24:21,360
Oh, right.

1977
01:24:21,500 --> 01:24:21,720
Yes.

1978
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:21,900
Later.

1979
01:24:22,040 --> 01:24:24,040
Yes, somebody is presented by Coca-Cola.

1980
01:24:24,180 --> 01:24:24,300
Right.

1981
01:24:24,620 --> 01:24:24,620
Right.

1982
01:24:24,980 --> 01:24:27,900
So we get now the full small world set is out.

1983
01:24:27,900 --> 01:24:31,060
And now all the kids is no more football kids and cheerleader kids.

1984
01:24:31,100 --> 01:24:32,200
They're all representing.

1985
01:24:32,680 --> 01:24:35,600
We got our like, you know, the like little Swiss girl outfits.

1986
01:24:35,660 --> 01:24:37,980
Everybody is a small world doll now.

1987
01:24:38,680 --> 01:24:39,460
Basically, yes.

1988
01:24:39,580 --> 01:24:41,200
Living dolls, you see.

1989
01:24:42,420 --> 01:24:45,140
None of this is like actively awful.

1990
01:24:45,180 --> 01:24:47,480
It's just kind of inane.

1991
01:24:47,620 --> 01:24:51,180
I mean, it's good to see the outside a small world on a football field.

1992
01:24:51,180 --> 01:24:51,860
Yeah, floats.

1993
01:24:52,260 --> 01:24:55,480
It's not the best representation of it I've ever seen.

1994
01:24:55,480 --> 01:24:58,820
But just for the novelty of it, they've constructed.

1995
01:24:58,840 --> 01:25:01,840
It's a small world on a football field at halftime.

1996
01:25:01,960 --> 01:25:02,180
Yes.

1997
01:25:02,200 --> 01:25:03,740
I can't be mad at that.

1998
01:25:03,820 --> 01:25:08,840
It is funny that two years before this, they opened a Hollywood themed theme park.

1999
01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:11,920
And it's like, oh, I already did too many Hollywood halftime shows.

2000
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:13,520
What do we get?

2001
01:25:13,640 --> 01:25:14,160
Small world.

2002
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:14,680
Yeah.

2003
01:25:15,060 --> 01:25:15,880
There's international conflict.

2004
01:25:15,880 --> 01:25:16,920
We ever done that before?

2005
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:17,700
I don't think so.

2006
01:25:17,700 --> 01:25:18,300
I don't know.

2007
01:25:18,440 --> 01:25:18,800
That always works.

2008
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:19,620
Should we check a tape?

2009
01:25:19,680 --> 01:25:20,080
Nah.

2010
01:25:21,540 --> 01:25:24,060
Well, and it's what you got to like about this end of the next one,

2011
01:25:24,060 --> 01:25:28,720
which is like recreations of theme park rides on the Super Bowl field.

2012
01:25:29,880 --> 01:25:32,080
But before we get to that,

2013
01:25:33,320 --> 01:25:35,900
here's where we're like starting to get the right idea.

2014
01:25:35,940 --> 01:25:41,480
This is what I'm saying about the gradient from marching band up to pop stars is like we are.

2015
01:25:42,120 --> 01:25:46,200
This what is about to happen is by far the most relevant thing

2016
01:25:46,200 --> 01:25:48,780
that has happened at a Super Bowl halftime show ever.

2017
01:25:48,920 --> 01:25:49,160
Right.

2018
01:25:49,740 --> 01:25:51,600
And yet it is they have to wait.

2019
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:53,080
They're pretty sidelined.

2020
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:56,160
And it's about as embarrassing for them as it could be.

2021
01:25:56,280 --> 01:25:57,540
And here it is.

2022
01:25:59,380 --> 01:26:03,140
And now to honor our armed forces, children,

2023
01:26:03,680 --> 01:26:08,640
Coca-Cola proudly presents the new Kids on the Block.

2024
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:23,180
Yeah, I armed forces kids.

2025
01:26:23,180 --> 01:26:26,880
I know that you're upset that your father is in Iraq.

2026
01:26:27,020 --> 01:26:30,560
Yeah, there's no way to explain what's happening there and why he's there.

2027
01:26:30,620 --> 01:26:34,660
But Coca-Cola has arranged the new kids on the block for you.

2028
01:26:34,700 --> 01:26:38,560
Yeah, that's like I guess it's like Bob Hope entertaining the troops

2029
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:39,500
in some way.

2030
01:26:39,740 --> 01:26:41,760
New Kids on the Block entertaining the troops kids.

2031
01:26:41,900 --> 01:26:43,020
Yeah, makes sense.

2032
01:26:43,720 --> 01:26:45,800
Kids, you do need to get to Tampa.

2033
01:26:48,100 --> 01:26:50,200
So figuring out travel arrangements.

2034
01:26:50,940 --> 01:26:55,800
But then like the who they have to because like, all right, it's in 1891.

2035
01:26:56,040 --> 01:26:57,020
They are very popular.

2036
01:26:57,200 --> 01:26:59,480
The halftime show could have just been ladies and gentlemen,

2037
01:26:59,560 --> 01:27:01,460
New Kids on the Block, and then they do 12 minutes.

2038
01:27:01,460 --> 01:27:02,800
But they hadn't figured that out yet.

2039
01:27:03,660 --> 01:27:07,380
So they like, no, you can't just cut to the new kids on the block and that's it.

2040
01:27:07,380 --> 01:27:09,160
There's got to be a bunch of razzle dazzle crap.

2041
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:14,780
They have to be performing in front of a bunch of child clowns with big round

2042
01:27:14,780 --> 01:27:16,240
rouge on their cheeks.

2043
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:23,620
And then like, you know, at some point, they're who's the Disney like hen character?

2044
01:27:24,520 --> 01:27:26,720
Oh, is it Clara?

2045
01:27:27,680 --> 01:27:28,760
Is Clara the hen?

2046
01:27:29,300 --> 01:27:30,300
Is Claire Belle cow?

2047
01:27:30,580 --> 01:27:30,960
Yeah.

2048
01:27:31,160 --> 01:27:32,300
And horse, horse collar.

2049
01:27:32,380 --> 01:27:34,380
But I know you're taught the hen with the bonnet.

2050
01:27:34,520 --> 01:27:35,920
Is it Clara cluck?

2051
01:27:37,200 --> 01:27:38,120
Clara cluck.

2052
01:27:38,620 --> 01:27:39,080
Yes.

2053
01:27:39,240 --> 01:27:39,560
All right.

2054
01:27:39,560 --> 01:27:40,040
Clara cluck.

2055
01:27:40,360 --> 01:27:42,780
Well, at some point, well, they're all busting moves.

2056
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:44,040
Clara cluck.

2057
01:27:44,320 --> 01:27:48,280
A hen and a bonnet comes out and kind of like dances a lot.

2058
01:27:48,320 --> 01:27:49,000
Oh, yeah.

2059
01:27:49,140 --> 01:27:49,840
Go, Jordan.

2060
01:27:50,540 --> 01:27:51,000
Why?

2061
01:27:51,140 --> 01:27:52,520
Why do you do this to them?

2062
01:27:54,640 --> 01:27:55,120
We can't.

2063
01:27:55,280 --> 01:27:57,580
We don't have Clara cluck at the ready.

2064
01:27:57,960 --> 01:27:59,900
And yeah, Clara cluck performed at the Super Bowl.

2065
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:03,720
But like Katy Perry, it's the shark that has the shark, of course, the iconic.

2066
01:28:03,780 --> 01:28:04,700
Well, that was good.

2067
01:28:05,220 --> 01:28:06,300
Left shark was good.

2068
01:28:06,420 --> 01:28:10,080
Left shark was, you know, leaned on a little too hard for a while.

2069
01:28:10,140 --> 01:28:11,200
I don't disagree with that.

2070
01:28:11,500 --> 01:28:15,760
But I'm just saying this could have been a moment where it was like the new kids

2071
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:17,040
version of the left shark.

2072
01:28:17,400 --> 01:28:17,560
Yes.

2073
01:28:17,720 --> 01:28:19,960
She also had the big lion she was right.

2074
01:28:20,040 --> 01:28:21,560
I always thought that was very cool.

2075
01:28:21,880 --> 01:28:22,680
I don't remember that.

2076
01:28:22,700 --> 01:28:25,960
I don't remember much of her halftime show, despite seeing her in concerts

2077
01:28:25,960 --> 01:28:29,360
several years later where I think she was still it was an awkward amount of time

2078
01:28:29,360 --> 01:28:32,160
enough that I liked that left shark was part of the show.

2079
01:28:35,780 --> 01:28:37,660
Ladies and gentlemen, left shark.

2080
01:28:37,660 --> 01:28:42,960
If I was at her Vegas residency and left shark came out, I would lose my mind.

2081
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:43,480
Oh, yeah.

2082
01:28:43,740 --> 01:28:44,600
I know we never saw.

2083
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:48,200
And of course, the big shit.

2084
01:28:48,720 --> 01:28:49,660
I know I was excited.

2085
01:28:49,820 --> 01:28:50,660
I want to see it.

2086
01:28:50,940 --> 01:28:52,480
Like left shark pops out of the big.

2087
01:28:53,320 --> 01:28:57,820
She should have gifted you to that big toilet for the sphere residency.

2088
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:58,740
That's true.

2089
01:28:59,000 --> 01:28:59,100
Yeah.

2090
01:28:59,100 --> 01:29:00,940
You should have had some sort of toilet song.

2091
01:29:00,940 --> 01:29:02,680
That stage was so minimal.

2092
01:29:02,900 --> 01:29:03,740
There's like nothing on it.

2093
01:29:03,980 --> 01:29:05,640
I think you could have used a big toilet.

2094
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:06,140
Yeah.

2095
01:29:06,140 --> 01:29:07,240
You could just lowered it.

2096
01:29:07,240 --> 01:29:08,360
It could have just been the seat.

2097
01:29:09,020 --> 01:29:11,680
The stage could have just been the toilet seat at the sphere.

2098
01:29:11,720 --> 01:29:14,000
We went from Brian Eno, whatever.

2099
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:18,920
They could have projected that like the walls of the sphere were the walls of the bowl

2100
01:29:18,920 --> 01:29:20,300
and they flush at some point.

2101
01:29:20,500 --> 01:29:23,040
You see water coming down the sides.

2102
01:29:23,180 --> 01:29:25,040
They haven't turned sphere into a toilet yet.

2103
01:29:25,820 --> 01:29:27,160
Oh, who's the artist to do that?

2104
01:29:27,340 --> 01:29:30,660
You think that'd be like if the if there was a sphere residency

2105
01:29:30,660 --> 01:29:31,820
by the Jerky Boys.

2106
01:29:32,220 --> 01:29:34,480
Yeah, that might be coming up.

2107
01:29:37,060 --> 01:29:38,080
That's that's where they're heading.

2108
01:29:38,140 --> 01:29:42,100
There are not seemingly that many bands signing up for this thing.

2109
01:29:42,300 --> 01:29:44,960
It's weird, even though every even though every week

2110
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:49,740
there's a new article by the New York Post saying so and so is considering doing.

2111
01:29:49,800 --> 01:29:50,200
That's right.

2112
01:29:51,420 --> 01:29:55,000
OK, the Jerky Boys are considering a residency.

2113
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:56,580
We're hovering around Jerky Boys.

2114
01:29:56,720 --> 01:29:57,280
We're excited.

2115
01:29:57,340 --> 01:29:59,080
And I didn't do anything wrong also.

2116
01:29:59,880 --> 01:30:01,700
OK, then we get

2117
01:30:02,820 --> 01:30:06,440
don't worry, the big popular band is not allowed to perform

2118
01:30:06,440 --> 01:30:11,060
without a bunch of embarrassing stuff for long because a bunch of kids run out on the field.

2119
01:30:20,640 --> 01:30:25,400
And I do love the directing here, where as it kind of pans to the left,

2120
01:30:25,760 --> 01:30:28,040
big character balloons inflate.

2121
01:30:28,040 --> 01:30:31,280
What do you get excited to see the inflatable?

2122
01:30:32,080 --> 01:30:32,720
Yeah.

2123
01:30:40,600 --> 01:30:42,040
Oh, that's right.

2124
01:30:42,300 --> 01:30:46,980
There's this zoom that we're just going to have to post because like, all right,

2125
01:30:47,320 --> 01:30:50,400
like a live butters is back.

2126
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:54,680
And then there's this zoom in unexplained to just this one child.

2127
01:30:54,680 --> 01:30:55,840
It was so awkward.

2128
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:57,060
Like Elfelfa.

2129
01:30:57,060 --> 01:30:58,640
Yeah, yes, absolutely.

2130
01:30:58,860 --> 01:31:02,640
I don't know with a very tall Alice from Alice in Wonderland.

2131
01:31:02,640 --> 01:31:05,760
I don't know if she's very tall necessarily compared to the child.

2132
01:31:06,320 --> 01:31:06,720
Yes.

2133
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:08,140
Towers above this child.

2134
01:31:08,540 --> 01:31:08,960
Yeah, I don't.

2135
01:31:09,100 --> 01:31:09,660
He's got so many.

2136
01:31:09,680 --> 01:31:11,940
He's got like lots of flowers on his.

2137
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:13,760
I don't know what he is.

2138
01:31:13,960 --> 01:31:14,460
I need to.

2139
01:31:14,600 --> 01:31:15,460
He looks really.

2140
01:31:15,920 --> 01:31:18,220
He looks as scared as any of us would have been to be.

2141
01:31:18,420 --> 01:31:20,260
Have a shot of us at the Super Bowl.

2142
01:31:20,420 --> 01:31:20,620
Yeah.

2143
01:31:20,700 --> 01:31:22,240
Jason, did you have that outfit as a child?

2144
01:31:22,360 --> 01:31:22,760
Yeah.

2145
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:29,460
Our neighbors were distant Habsburg relatives and they gave us hand me down jackets.

2146
01:31:29,680 --> 01:31:32,820
Or that's the outfit you wore to fool the bus driver into giving you the child.

2147
01:31:34,740 --> 01:31:36,320
I need I need this.

2148
01:31:36,440 --> 01:31:41,160
I need the extra dollar in my pocket for this three minute bus ride from the hill

2149
01:31:41,160 --> 01:31:43,560
down the hill to the center of town.

2150
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:44,820
It was a dollar.

2151
01:31:44,820 --> 01:31:46,280
It was a dollar or two.

2152
01:31:46,580 --> 01:31:47,220
I forget.

2153
01:31:48,620 --> 01:31:51,560
All I need to do is create a false identity.

2154
01:31:52,280 --> 01:31:54,060
Look, I'm wearing a bow tie.

2155
01:31:54,380 --> 01:31:57,240
Only children and very old men wear bow ties.

2156
01:31:57,700 --> 01:31:58,000
Have you heard?

2157
01:31:58,500 --> 01:31:59,880
Have you heard of our gang?

2158
01:32:01,960 --> 01:32:03,670
Well, I mean it,

2159
01:32:04,220 --> 01:32:05,380
but I'm young.

2160
01:32:05,680 --> 01:32:09,140
If you just if you just quickly taken made a cowlick just like

2161
01:32:09,720 --> 01:32:12,190
squirted some Gatorade in your hair and then.

2162
01:32:12,880 --> 01:32:13,720
All right.

2163
01:32:13,800 --> 01:32:17,660
And then I think you get a little by now.

2164
01:32:17,880 --> 01:32:19,940
Real Mickey is doing.

2165
01:32:19,940 --> 01:32:24,300
They are not going to weird screeching and correct Mickey.

2166
01:32:25,200 --> 01:32:28,030
And a nice message from Mickey Mouse to close it out.

2167
01:32:31,500 --> 01:32:34,560
And thanks to our armed forces everywhere.

2168
01:32:35,960 --> 01:32:37,800
Real Mickey, they got him everywhere.

2169
01:32:38,340 --> 01:32:39,440
So hooray for Hollywood.

2170
01:32:39,680 --> 01:32:42,980
And then a few years later, thanks to our armed forces everywhere.

2171
01:32:43,820 --> 01:32:47,640
This feels impossible that they would allow today

2172
01:32:47,640 --> 01:32:51,760
that they would allow Mickey to come anywhere near a military industrial.

2173
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:52,820
Yes.

2174
01:32:54,960 --> 01:32:57,580
Let's keep those prophets coming, boys.

2175
01:32:59,440 --> 01:33:00,840
The war machine must roll.

2176
01:33:02,500 --> 01:33:04,960
Well, also, if they had a clip of

2177
01:33:06,180 --> 01:33:07,660
Joe Biden, Dr.

2178
01:33:07,900 --> 01:33:11,660
Joe Biden saying like, well, we want to thank one and welcome everyone.

2179
01:33:11,900 --> 01:33:15,040
This is half the stadium would be like, ah,

2180
01:33:15,040 --> 01:33:18,240
yeah, yes, yes.

2181
01:33:18,440 --> 01:33:19,640
Their eyes would turn white.

2182
01:33:19,960 --> 01:33:21,780
There's like they're foaming at the mouth.

2183
01:33:23,120 --> 01:33:23,600
Yes.

2184
01:33:23,700 --> 01:33:24,880
Different time, different type.

2185
01:33:24,920 --> 01:33:27,640
We were all we were we were united back then

2186
01:33:28,540 --> 01:33:33,180
or just didn't have the information we needed to not be united or something.

2187
01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:36,240
We were united in apathy toward these halftime.

2188
01:33:36,380 --> 01:33:37,360
Yeah, mainly that.

2189
01:33:37,620 --> 01:33:37,800
Yeah.

2190
01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:41,540
And I'm going to go take a piss, you know, make some more dip for those ruffles.

2191
01:33:42,720 --> 01:33:43,720
That's that's that.

2192
01:33:43,720 --> 01:33:48,000
So that's that's kind of like in you could say one of the craziest,

2193
01:33:48,360 --> 01:33:51,500
maybe the craziest one Disney produced, one of the weirdest ones.

2194
01:33:51,800 --> 01:33:56,080
And let me add to the strangeness of this by saying what I just found out,

2195
01:33:56,120 --> 01:33:58,860
which is that this did not air.

2196
01:33:59,540 --> 01:34:00,060
Why?

2197
01:34:00,220 --> 01:34:02,580
Golf, at least not as it was occurring,

2198
01:34:02,900 --> 01:34:06,100
because we were in the full swing of the Gulf War.

2199
01:34:06,200 --> 01:34:09,680
There was so much concern over Gulf War updates instead,

2200
01:34:10,100 --> 01:34:11,820
at least in the majority of the country.

2201
01:34:11,820 --> 01:34:15,400
They cut to Peter Jennings providing a Gulf War update.

2202
01:34:15,800 --> 01:34:20,540
And this was aired maybe after the Super Bowl.

2203
01:34:20,740 --> 01:34:23,080
Hey, stick around to see the halftime show,

2204
01:34:23,120 --> 01:34:25,980
which we've been sitting on for an hour and a half.

2205
01:34:25,980 --> 01:34:27,080
Well, they buried it.

2206
01:34:27,260 --> 01:34:30,120
They buried this and maybe rightfully so.

2207
01:34:30,140 --> 01:34:33,240
And even then it wasn't aired everywhere because a lot of the affiliates

2208
01:34:33,240 --> 01:34:37,940
had an obligation to play a new sitcom, which I think was called Davis's Rules.

2209
01:34:38,320 --> 01:34:38,660
Oh, yeah.

2210
01:34:38,740 --> 01:34:40,440
I just saw what is who's on Davis?

2211
01:34:40,440 --> 01:34:41,300
I don't know.

2212
01:34:41,360 --> 01:34:41,920
What was the day?

2213
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:42,160
I should have.

2214
01:34:42,160 --> 01:34:43,320
Why don't I have this information?

2215
01:34:44,920 --> 01:34:46,420
It's Randy Quaid.

2216
01:34:46,620 --> 01:34:47,400
Oh, Randy Quaid.

2217
01:34:47,660 --> 01:34:48,220
OK, I did see that.

2218
01:34:48,220 --> 01:34:49,300
And Jonathan Winters?

2219
01:34:49,480 --> 01:34:55,300
Yes, I sent Andrew Grissom a picture of Davis Rules three days ago.

2220
01:34:55,660 --> 01:34:56,560
That's what it's from.

2221
01:34:56,820 --> 01:35:00,240
I sent Andrew Grissom so much crap, I can't even remember.

2222
01:35:00,540 --> 01:35:04,220
Keep keeping straight something I sent him days ago.

2223
01:35:05,060 --> 01:35:08,580
In this show, Jonathan Winters plays Gunny Davis.

2224
01:35:08,580 --> 01:35:12,260
Gunny Davis is not Anthony Kiedis's father.

2225
01:35:12,440 --> 01:35:13,640
Blackie, damn it.

2226
01:35:13,940 --> 01:35:16,140
Blackie, damn it is not Gunny Davis.

2227
01:35:16,360 --> 01:35:16,680
Gunny.

2228
01:35:16,960 --> 01:35:19,300
Yeah, Blackie, damn it is not Gunny Davis.

2229
01:35:19,900 --> 01:35:20,240
OK.

2230
01:35:20,720 --> 01:35:21,440
How many days ago?

2231
01:35:21,540 --> 01:35:23,800
Five days ago, I sent Andrew Grissom

2232
01:35:23,800 --> 01:35:27,500
a picture and a description on Facebook of Davis Rules.

2233
01:35:28,240 --> 01:35:29,860
No, not Davis's Rules, Davis Rules.

2234
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:30,680
Davis Rules.

2235
01:35:30,960 --> 01:35:35,280
And then he said that he's on a Jonathan Winters deep dive lately.

2236
01:35:35,300 --> 01:35:37,280
So that's a good timing that I sent that.

2237
01:35:38,640 --> 01:35:41,620
Well, it's a good sign that Andrew should turn around,

2238
01:35:41,620 --> 01:35:44,300
stop going too deep or you'll end up at Davis Rules.

2239
01:35:44,340 --> 01:35:46,060
And I said, did you stumble on Davis Rules?

2240
01:35:46,060 --> 01:35:47,340
He said, I did not.

2241
01:35:47,900 --> 01:35:49,360
I was mainly watching talk show bits.

2242
01:35:49,640 --> 01:35:52,120
How many episodes were made of Davis Rules?

2243
01:35:52,600 --> 01:35:53,120
29.

2244
01:35:53,780 --> 01:35:54,700
Two seasons.

2245
01:35:54,960 --> 01:35:56,600
This is a two season show.

2246
01:35:57,340 --> 01:35:58,440
Patricia Clarkson is on it.

2247
01:35:58,580 --> 01:35:59,720
Bonnie Hunt is on it.

2248
01:35:59,740 --> 01:36:00,200
Yeah.

2249
01:36:00,480 --> 01:36:01,200
Sitcom royalty.

2250
01:36:01,260 --> 01:36:02,800
Everybody probably made a million dollars.

2251
01:36:02,900 --> 01:36:04,600
A young Giovanni Ribisi.

2252
01:36:04,740 --> 01:36:05,100
Yeah.

2253
01:36:05,240 --> 01:36:06,700
Parker Selfridge himself

2254
01:36:06,700 --> 01:36:08,880
cut his teeth on Davis Rules.

2255
01:36:09,060 --> 01:36:10,960
Debra Jo Rupp as well.

2256
01:36:11,380 --> 01:36:12,020
Who's Debra Jo Rupp?

2257
01:36:12,380 --> 01:36:13,500
From That 70's Show.

2258
01:36:13,700 --> 01:36:14,500
Oh, wow.

2259
01:36:14,880 --> 01:36:15,360
Yeah.

2260
01:36:16,500 --> 01:36:18,400
Well, he's just called Vanni Ribisi.

2261
01:36:18,680 --> 01:36:20,960
That's a name I can't make heads or tails of.

2262
01:36:21,220 --> 01:36:22,420
Vanni, Vanni.

2263
01:36:23,180 --> 01:36:24,760
There's a Cranston in here, I think, too.

2264
01:36:24,980 --> 01:36:25,100
Yep.

2265
01:36:25,300 --> 01:36:27,380
Davis Rules, Cranston and Davis Rules.

2266
01:36:27,460 --> 01:36:28,380
Oh, my God.

2267
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:28,700
Wow.

2268
01:36:28,780 --> 01:36:30,160
He looks like Alan Thicke there.

2269
01:36:30,160 --> 01:36:30,500
Yeah.

2270
01:36:30,660 --> 01:36:32,900
Kind of like 90s dad here.

2271
01:36:32,940 --> 01:36:36,420
He could do a great like Thicke, Alan Thicke type character, too.

2272
01:36:36,420 --> 01:36:37,180
Oh, sure.

2273
01:36:37,440 --> 01:36:38,780
Well, there was another show to finish.

2274
01:36:44,520 --> 01:36:46,180
OK, so that is that.

2275
01:36:46,300 --> 01:36:48,840
And we are heading towards the finish line.

2276
01:36:48,900 --> 01:36:50,760
Something that I should have said at the beginning.

2277
01:36:50,840 --> 01:36:52,500
This is an executive decision I made.

2278
01:36:52,660 --> 01:36:57,560
Put this blame on me if you wanted to hear about the Millennium

2279
01:36:57,560 --> 01:37:00,980
halftime show, which is the what?

2280
01:37:01,400 --> 01:37:03,620
This is the last Disney Super Bowl halftime show.

2281
01:37:03,620 --> 01:37:07,220
Super Bowl 34 in 2000 called Tapestry of Nations,

2282
01:37:07,640 --> 01:37:13,360
much like the actual show that disturbed Epcot guests for around the Millennium

2283
01:37:13,360 --> 01:37:13,680
times.

2284
01:37:14,520 --> 01:37:19,000
We covered this kind of thoroughly in our second gate episode.

2285
01:37:19,180 --> 01:37:21,540
Walt Disney World Millennium Celebration.

2286
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:23,060
Go look that up.

2287
01:37:23,260 --> 01:37:26,640
Also the episode where we met and fell in love with Leonardo Columbus.

2288
01:37:27,580 --> 01:37:28,800
A lot of fun in that one.

2289
01:37:29,500 --> 01:37:33,140
So if you were excited to hear a lot more about khaki,

2290
01:37:33,320 --> 01:37:36,420
clad Phil Collins singing Two Worlds from Tarzan,

2291
01:37:36,440 --> 01:37:39,620
I think we also talked about it with Kevin Purger in Tarzan Rocks.

2292
01:37:40,040 --> 01:37:42,740
If you're not happy about this, if there's some major component

2293
01:37:42,740 --> 01:37:47,640
of Tapestry of Nations that you know we didn't talk about on the show,

2294
01:37:48,360 --> 01:37:53,240
please harass us at our homes and we will make sure that we come to our house.

2295
01:37:53,300 --> 01:37:55,500
We'll get we'll give our addresses at the very end.

2296
01:37:55,500 --> 01:37:59,020
And we'll make sure that we cover this properly.

2297
01:37:59,100 --> 01:38:01,600
But that was why I felt like maybe kind of like covered territory,

2298
01:38:01,980 --> 01:38:04,160
as technically is the last thing that we're talking about.

2299
01:38:04,400 --> 01:38:06,160
And to segue into that.

2300
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:11,980
So this happens in 1991, technically doesn't air in the allotted time.

2301
01:38:12,240 --> 01:38:13,720
Kind of weird and embarrassing.

2302
01:38:14,160 --> 01:38:17,900
They're aging it down with new kids, but humiliating them in the process.

2303
01:38:18,260 --> 01:38:22,300
The next year, winter magic ice skating from Brian Boitano

2304
01:38:22,300 --> 01:38:25,100
and Dorothy Hamill on the tiniest rinks you've ever seen.

2305
01:38:26,120 --> 01:38:30,460
Gloria Estefan does admittedly elevate that that performance.

2306
01:38:31,100 --> 01:38:32,700
But here's what happens.

2307
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:37,960
Winter magic is definitely the last of the of the razzle dazzle crap era.

2308
01:38:38,340 --> 01:38:42,820
And with the reputation of Super Bowl halftime shows at this point,

2309
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:47,600
having become, you know, a bunch of nonsense for Grandma Fox,

2310
01:38:47,640 --> 01:38:51,740
which is not airing the Super Bowl that year, strikes back and airs a

2311
01:38:52,280 --> 01:38:54,580
I don't know if they were shooting it live,

2312
01:38:54,580 --> 01:38:57,520
but at least like exactly when the halftime show started,

2313
01:38:58,040 --> 01:39:01,680
Fox aired an original in living color anti halftime show,

2314
01:39:02,300 --> 01:39:06,440
which trounced them in the ratings, like as so many people went over

2315
01:39:06,440 --> 01:39:10,540
to in living color, huge success finally showed the NFL.

2316
01:39:11,060 --> 01:39:16,700
We can't do, you know, now a salute to the general idea of children.

2317
01:39:17,880 --> 01:39:21,120
So that is why the next year they just got right.

2318
01:39:21,160 --> 01:39:23,620
Who is the biggest celebrity on the planet?

2319
01:39:23,620 --> 01:39:25,700
Michael Jackson, Michael Jackson will do this.

2320
01:39:26,520 --> 01:39:30,560
That adds fuel to the fire of that halftime show.

2321
01:39:30,680 --> 01:39:33,360
The Michael Jackson, at least that year of the Super Bowl remains,

2322
01:39:33,820 --> 01:39:36,500
I believe, or did for a long time in the top 10

2323
01:39:37,620 --> 01:39:39,860
programs ever aired on television ratings.

2324
01:39:40,200 --> 01:39:40,220
Wow.

2325
01:39:40,240 --> 01:39:42,020
It was so mass.

2326
01:39:42,100 --> 01:39:44,560
I mean, all the Super Bowls are huge and were huge.

2327
01:39:44,560 --> 01:39:47,080
But I think that one especially sticks around.

2328
01:39:47,500 --> 01:39:49,900
Let them know this is what we need to do from now on.

2329
01:39:49,900 --> 01:39:51,640
That having been said,

2330
01:39:52,480 --> 01:39:57,360
it's not as if they immediately were able to book a big stable of artists,

2331
01:39:57,420 --> 01:40:00,120
because the next year was like kind of a mix of country people.

2332
01:40:00,160 --> 01:40:00,400
Yeah.

2333
01:40:01,780 --> 01:40:04,220
And basically, they think the NFL,

2334
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:09,980
they wanted Michael Jackson ratings and Michael Jackson style fame.

2335
01:40:10,080 --> 01:40:12,560
But maybe they didn't like dealing with Michael Jackson.

2336
01:40:12,560 --> 01:40:12,980
Sure.

2337
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:16,000
And they were concerned about some of the stuff and the crutch grabbing

2338
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,920
and the fact and that when the show started, he came out and just didn't

2339
01:40:18,920 --> 01:40:21,200
just stood still for over a minute.

2340
01:40:21,960 --> 01:40:23,820
And everyone was like, is this a problem?

2341
01:40:23,920 --> 01:40:24,520
Is he dying?

2342
01:40:24,580 --> 01:40:25,080
What is it?

2343
01:40:25,160 --> 01:40:26,220
And it was just building tension.

2344
01:40:26,260 --> 01:40:28,360
But if you watch it now, it is weird.

2345
01:40:28,380 --> 01:40:31,140
How much of his 12 minutes are silence.

2346
01:40:32,060 --> 01:40:34,520
So anyways, what they set out to do, they're like,

2347
01:40:34,520 --> 01:40:36,740
what if we can kind of split the difference?

2348
01:40:37,080 --> 01:40:38,660
We get some stars,

2349
01:40:38,740 --> 01:40:43,940
but really if what we go for is MTV style, you know, it's like,

2350
01:40:44,280 --> 01:40:47,880
where, you know, it's, it's like a concert and it's kind of edgy and hip,

2351
01:40:47,880 --> 01:40:51,640
but we don't have to get like the ego of a Michael Jackson site.

2352
01:40:51,640 --> 01:40:54,920
And maybe Disney would still want to help us out with this.

2353
01:40:54,940 --> 01:41:00,200
And that's what leads us to the immortal 1995 Indiana Jones

2354
01:41:00,200 --> 01:41:02,620
and the Temple of the Forbidden Eye.

2355
01:41:02,620 --> 01:41:03,020
Oh, yeah.

2356
01:41:03,180 --> 01:41:03,980
Half time show.

2357
01:41:04,960 --> 01:41:09,260
If the small world one teased it, this one is just fully the entire half time

2358
01:41:09,260 --> 01:41:11,720
show is the promotion of a new ride.

2359
01:41:11,980 --> 01:41:12,220
Yes.

2360
01:41:12,260 --> 01:41:12,460
Yeah.

2361
01:41:12,460 --> 01:41:13,160
It's wild.

2362
01:41:13,400 --> 01:41:13,720
Yeah.

2363
01:41:14,020 --> 01:41:16,440
Which I have watched this a number of times,

2364
01:41:16,440 --> 01:41:22,280
but I always forget the one big moment and who the two stars are.

2365
01:41:22,760 --> 01:41:22,860
Yeah.

2366
01:41:22,980 --> 01:41:25,680
Because there's just so much spectacle happening.

2367
01:41:25,860 --> 01:41:27,080
There was it really confused.

2368
01:41:27,160 --> 01:41:28,820
I definitely watched this as it aired.

2369
01:41:28,940 --> 01:41:31,900
I was so thrilled that they were being so excited for that ride.

2370
01:41:32,160 --> 01:41:32,380
Yeah.

2371
01:41:32,380 --> 01:41:33,800
Just a big ride promo.

2372
01:41:33,880 --> 01:41:35,060
And that's the half time show.

2373
01:41:35,300 --> 01:41:37,840
I don't think I knew who the performers were at the time.

2374
01:41:37,900 --> 01:41:38,660
And truly it is like,

2375
01:41:38,660 --> 01:41:42,780
I mean, a lot of it is literally Indiana Jones and Marion are lost.

2376
01:41:42,880 --> 01:41:43,360
Yeah.

2377
01:41:43,440 --> 01:41:45,220
A bunch of crap happening around them.

2378
01:41:47,800 --> 01:41:52,620
Now, definitely we talked about some bits of this in one of our first episodes,

2379
01:41:52,680 --> 01:41:56,200
literally one of our first, which was the Indiana Jones adventure.

2380
01:41:57,040 --> 01:42:00,220
If we've kind of talked about something before, I like to go back and check.

2381
01:42:00,700 --> 01:42:01,880
What did we say about it?

2382
01:42:01,980 --> 01:42:02,540
It's not double up.

2383
01:42:02,640 --> 01:42:03,820
But boy, was that a long time ago.

2384
01:42:04,080 --> 01:42:07,660
And one thing I'm not willing to do is listen to the first episodes.

2385
01:42:08,360 --> 01:42:12,760
I've got older ones now, but the first ones I am petrified of.

2386
01:42:12,860 --> 01:42:14,000
We just have not something.

2387
01:42:14,240 --> 01:42:14,280
Right.

2388
01:42:14,280 --> 01:42:18,120
That's just like, I'm not so insecure that I can't listen to

2389
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:20,660
older episodes or myself talk or something.

2390
01:42:20,700 --> 01:42:22,280
But the first ones, no desire.

2391
01:42:22,680 --> 01:42:23,320
Yeah, I don't want to.

2392
01:42:23,340 --> 01:42:24,980
Well, that's why we have to redo them.

2393
01:42:25,840 --> 01:42:27,400
I guess so.

2394
01:42:29,100 --> 01:42:29,580
Yeah.

2395
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:30,400
Yeah.

2396
01:42:30,560 --> 01:42:32,540
Keep pounding that drum boys.

2397
01:42:32,580 --> 01:42:34,200
I'm just saying, you know, I don't want to listen to them either.

2398
01:42:34,320 --> 01:42:35,980
There's some drum pounding in this.

2399
01:42:36,200 --> 01:42:36,840
What a coincidence.

2400
01:42:37,860 --> 01:42:38,820
There is.

2401
01:42:39,160 --> 01:42:42,700
I say drum pounding, but I can't tell if they're actually playing

2402
01:42:42,700 --> 01:42:44,780
the big ceremonial drums.

2403
01:42:44,800 --> 01:42:45,500
That's a question.

2404
01:42:45,600 --> 01:42:49,600
I think we do still have some live music here, attempts at live music,

2405
01:42:49,700 --> 01:42:51,900
because there are some errors with the music.

2406
01:42:52,160 --> 01:42:52,240
Yeah.

2407
01:42:52,360 --> 01:42:54,140
That's my that's my clue there.

2408
01:42:54,980 --> 01:42:57,880
So this is at the end of January, 1995.

2409
01:42:58,280 --> 01:43:03,240
This one is happening in Miami, Joe Robbie Stadium, Chargers versus 49ers.

2410
01:43:03,800 --> 01:43:07,420
After everybody calms down from the Kathie Lee Gifford national anthem,

2411
01:43:08,520 --> 01:43:10,860
then this this show occurs.

2412
01:43:11,540 --> 01:43:16,760
End of January, Temple of Forbidden Eyes opening at Disneyland, March 4th, 1995.

2413
01:43:17,320 --> 01:43:21,940
So this is America's introduction to the Forbidden Eye,

2414
01:43:22,240 --> 01:43:25,420
to Mara, to not looking well into Mara's eye.

2415
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:27,340
I'm sure everyone clocked all of that.

2416
01:43:27,340 --> 01:43:27,800
Oh, yeah.

2417
01:43:27,820 --> 01:43:29,580
Held it for their next vacation.

2418
01:43:31,060 --> 01:43:34,740
Let's just start at how they started it.

2419
01:43:35,420 --> 01:43:39,160
And it kind of after some like Indiana Jones pre-roll,

2420
01:43:39,160 --> 01:43:44,580
they cut to like a temple guard guy, bald guy.

2421
01:43:44,780 --> 01:43:46,020
And this happens.

2422
01:43:47,500 --> 01:43:50,980
Bring to me the trophy.

2423
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:05,940
This is still guy.

2424
01:44:06,180 --> 01:44:09,360
Yeah, the temple is rising up behind them.

2425
01:44:09,380 --> 01:44:13,040
It's a really it's a great cut to from this guy like bring the line.

2426
01:44:13,040 --> 01:44:16,180
He's got like skulls on big sticks.

2427
01:44:16,220 --> 01:44:19,260
And then he and then he just looks so bored.

2428
01:44:19,360 --> 01:44:19,720
Yeah.

2429
01:44:19,860 --> 01:44:20,520
Immediately.

2430
01:44:20,680 --> 01:44:23,920
I like it's like he forgot that he would still be on.

2431
01:44:24,580 --> 01:44:27,570
And, you know, in lieu of the, you know,

2432
01:44:28,920 --> 01:44:34,540
readers of Lost Ark Idol, the trophy he's discussing is the Super Bowl trophy.

2433
01:44:34,820 --> 01:44:38,600
This is the literal is the Vince Lombardi trophy.

2434
01:44:38,740 --> 01:44:39,100
Yeah.

2435
01:44:40,180 --> 01:44:42,420
Which I was refreshing my memory.

2436
01:44:42,480 --> 01:44:43,700
What's up with Vince Lombardi?

2437
01:44:43,740 --> 01:44:47,760
And he did wear a hat that was kind of like Indiana Jones's hat.

2438
01:44:47,760 --> 01:44:48,440
Yeah, yeah.

2439
01:44:48,440 --> 01:44:48,780
Yeah.

2440
01:44:48,980 --> 01:44:49,500
That's cool.

2441
01:44:49,580 --> 01:44:49,900
There you go.

2442
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:50,160
Yeah.

2443
01:44:50,360 --> 01:44:53,280
So it really it's actually very clean if you think about it.

2444
01:44:53,680 --> 01:44:56,540
And yeah, that's sort of the story here.

2445
01:44:56,920 --> 01:44:59,980
Indiana Jones is in the Temple of Mara,

2446
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:03,240
which is sprouted up in the middle of Joe Robbie Stadium.

2447
01:45:03,280 --> 01:45:03,740
Perfect.

2448
01:45:03,880 --> 01:45:08,320
And he is trying to get back the real Super Bowl trophy.

2449
01:45:08,320 --> 01:45:08,840
Yeah.

2450
01:45:09,680 --> 01:45:11,900
It's the pinnacle of it, really.

2451
01:45:12,280 --> 01:45:12,580
Yeah.

2452
01:45:12,600 --> 01:45:13,040
In my mind.

2453
01:45:13,200 --> 01:45:16,640
And as far as you're saying, what your definition is of like,

2454
01:45:16,640 --> 01:45:17,580
what did you call it?

2455
01:45:17,700 --> 01:45:17,700
Crab?

2456
01:45:17,800 --> 01:45:18,240
Razzle Dazzle Crab.

2457
01:45:18,320 --> 01:45:18,980
Razzle Dazzle Crab.

2458
01:45:19,080 --> 01:45:20,720
It's like one last hurrah.

2459
01:45:20,720 --> 01:45:21,020
Exactly.

2460
01:45:21,520 --> 01:45:23,280
That's one last big score.

2461
01:45:23,680 --> 01:45:26,180
The next year might really be.

2462
01:45:26,260 --> 01:45:26,760
Wait a minute.

2463
01:45:26,880 --> 01:45:27,340
What year are we talking?

2464
01:45:27,480 --> 01:45:27,960
95?

2465
01:45:28,580 --> 01:45:28,980
I forget.

2466
01:45:29,100 --> 01:45:29,860
Maybe it's Diana Ross.

2467
01:45:30,160 --> 01:45:32,340
Well, we'll get Diana Ross after that.

2468
01:45:32,500 --> 01:45:32,500
Yeah.

2469
01:45:32,540 --> 01:45:34,120
Oh, well, yes, you're right.

2470
01:45:34,220 --> 01:45:34,860
OK, that's true.

2471
01:45:34,900 --> 01:45:35,340
You're right.

2472
01:45:35,460 --> 01:45:35,880
I guess.

2473
01:45:36,940 --> 01:45:39,020
It's a different kind, but it's yeah.

2474
01:45:39,040 --> 01:45:39,480
Yeah, you're right.

2475
01:45:39,480 --> 01:45:39,940
You're right.

2476
01:45:40,260 --> 01:45:41,380
Yeah, I'll talk about it.

2477
01:45:41,380 --> 01:45:41,880
I'll tease it.

2478
01:45:41,920 --> 01:45:42,240
A very.

2479
01:45:42,840 --> 01:45:42,900
Yeah.

2480
01:45:42,960 --> 01:45:45,860
But yeah, you got immediately cut to a drummer

2481
01:45:45,860 --> 01:45:48,060
who looks like the snake from the ride.

2482
01:45:48,320 --> 01:45:52,420
I mean, it's great if you want extra stuff of specifically the Indiana

2483
01:45:52,420 --> 01:45:53,500
Jones adventure.

2484
01:45:53,740 --> 01:45:54,220
Yes.

2485
01:45:54,360 --> 01:45:55,700
Still, guys.

2486
01:45:57,160 --> 01:46:01,600
And then pretty quickly, ladies and gentlemen,

2487
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:04,960
the godmother of soul or whatever.

2488
01:46:05,540 --> 01:46:06,640
Miss Patti LaBelle.

2489
01:46:07,260 --> 01:46:10,820
I don't really know why she's in it yet.

2490
01:46:11,180 --> 01:46:11,320
Yeah.

2491
01:46:11,420 --> 01:46:13,520
Plot wise, I don't know.

2492
01:46:13,720 --> 01:46:14,200
I'm a little lost.

2493
01:46:14,280 --> 01:46:14,980
Patti LaBelle's there.

2494
01:46:15,200 --> 01:46:16,460
She's been trapped in the temple.

2495
01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:16,960
Yes.

2496
01:46:17,160 --> 01:46:17,440
Yeah.

2497
01:46:17,480 --> 01:46:17,780
Yeah.

2498
01:46:17,920 --> 01:46:19,220
Big name, big star.

2499
01:46:19,480 --> 01:46:20,000
Sure.

2500
01:46:20,060 --> 01:46:20,900
For a long time.

2501
01:46:21,040 --> 01:46:22,020
Kind of makes sense.

2502
01:46:22,340 --> 01:46:22,680
Yes.

2503
01:46:22,980 --> 01:46:23,580
Makes sense.

2504
01:46:23,840 --> 01:46:26,520
Songs that are definitely not recent.

2505
01:46:27,160 --> 01:46:27,480
But I guess.

2506
01:46:27,500 --> 01:46:28,400
Not super recent.

2507
01:46:28,580 --> 01:46:29,020
Yeah.

2508
01:46:29,020 --> 01:46:34,480
But closer to like Stones, the Stones or Prince or someone a little older.

2509
01:46:34,480 --> 01:46:35,320
Well, OK, 80s.

2510
01:46:35,600 --> 01:46:39,400
She had a new attitude is from 1984 is one of the songs she does.

2511
01:46:39,540 --> 01:46:39,820
Yeah.

2512
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,260
So just an 11 year old.

2513
01:46:42,580 --> 01:46:42,740
Yeah.

2514
01:46:43,200 --> 01:46:43,200
Yeah.

2515
01:46:43,820 --> 01:46:45,420
Anyway, but she's fine.

2516
01:46:45,560 --> 01:46:46,100
It's good.

2517
01:46:46,420 --> 01:46:48,740
The behind the scenes info on this.

2518
01:46:49,280 --> 01:46:53,920
The stage was full of like big holes that were exactly the size of her heel.

2519
01:46:54,020 --> 01:46:54,540
Oh, wow.

2520
01:46:54,720 --> 01:46:58,300
So they had to put a the solution was to like

2521
01:46:58,300 --> 01:47:01,760
put a little fiberglass, like give her like some extra heel.

2522
01:47:01,860 --> 01:47:02,640
It has to be the heels.

2523
01:47:02,740 --> 01:47:03,960
Certainly, we can't change the shoes.

2524
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:07,800
So they gave her like a little clear ski, basically,

2525
01:47:07,960 --> 01:47:11,860
so that she wouldn't like fall into each peg hole.

2526
01:47:12,160 --> 01:47:14,040
That's like what I do for my toys.

2527
01:47:14,900 --> 01:47:16,700
I have to put a little like plastic under that.

2528
01:47:16,800 --> 01:47:20,220
They have a hole in the foot in the shoe or whatever boot or whatever.

2529
01:47:20,560 --> 01:47:22,360
The stand you use the peg.

2530
01:47:22,940 --> 01:47:23,780
It depends.

2531
01:47:24,100 --> 01:47:26,540
Sometimes the figure is a little bit harder to stand on its own.

2532
01:47:26,540 --> 01:47:30,340
I tried to have the figure stand on its own, but if not, you got to put it on one of those little circles.

2533
01:47:30,680 --> 01:47:30,980
Because G.

2534
01:47:30,980 --> 01:47:31,100
I.

2535
01:47:31,140 --> 01:47:33,480
Joe's always came with the black rectangle.

2536
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:34,840
So I never liked that.

2537
01:47:35,600 --> 01:47:39,320
Well, they the the the neck of cells like a clear circular one.

2538
01:47:39,320 --> 01:47:41,980
OK, it fits a lot of figures that are six or seven inch.

2539
01:47:41,980 --> 01:47:42,580
Semi-link.

2540
01:47:42,700 --> 01:47:45,700
But then you also but then you also have like flying ones, too,

2541
01:47:45,700 --> 01:47:47,780
where you can display them, people like characters that fly.

2542
01:47:47,820 --> 01:47:48,120
Fly.

2543
01:47:48,220 --> 01:47:48,440
OK.

2544
01:47:48,540 --> 01:47:50,560
It's a little stick and then it's clear as well.

2545
01:47:50,760 --> 01:47:50,780
Right.

2546
01:47:50,780 --> 01:47:52,100
You can have your own.

2547
01:47:52,460 --> 01:47:54,440
So you can do a little pose go.

2548
01:47:54,440 --> 01:47:57,580
Well, they should make neck as of everything in this halftime show.

2549
01:47:57,580 --> 01:48:00,580
I mean, I know there's Indiana Jones figures out there, but I want Patti LaBelle.

2550
01:48:00,580 --> 01:48:02,040
I want all the characters.

2551
01:48:03,780 --> 01:48:04,880
But she performs a song.

2552
01:48:04,920 --> 01:48:09,700
You realize that it's about securing the actual trophy and then into the stadium

2553
01:48:11,440 --> 01:48:14,260
skydives Indiana Jones and Marion.

2554
01:48:14,360 --> 01:48:14,800
Crazy.

2555
01:48:14,880 --> 01:48:16,060
Very exciting.

2556
01:48:16,580 --> 01:48:19,940
They sky are they like on fire or they're like flares on them?

2557
01:48:19,940 --> 01:48:20,900
Yeah, they have flares.

2558
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:21,840
Flares, I think.

2559
01:48:22,260 --> 01:48:22,400
Yeah.

2560
01:48:22,480 --> 01:48:22,800
Nuts.

2561
01:48:22,800 --> 01:48:23,500
It's crazy.

2562
01:48:23,500 --> 01:48:23,720
Yeah.

2563
01:48:23,720 --> 01:48:25,680
Is he just ever skydiving the movies?

2564
01:48:25,780 --> 01:48:29,020
Well, he jumps out of a plane in Temple of Doom.

2565
01:48:29,260 --> 01:48:29,480
OK.

2566
01:48:29,800 --> 01:48:30,620
But they don't sky.

2567
01:48:30,700 --> 01:48:34,180
He's got he uses the big inflatable raft and they go from the plane.

2568
01:48:34,900 --> 01:48:35,360
Oh, right.

2569
01:48:35,640 --> 01:48:36,580
And slide down.

2570
01:48:36,760 --> 01:48:36,960
Oh, yeah.

2571
01:48:37,260 --> 01:48:37,420
Yeah.

2572
01:48:37,720 --> 01:48:39,260
So close, I guess.

2573
01:48:39,420 --> 01:48:41,840
He doesn't do like a base jump like Ethan Hunt or something.

2574
01:48:41,960 --> 01:48:46,060
So you have to skydive and then you had to do basically a theme park

2575
01:48:46,060 --> 01:48:47,460
stunt show at the super.

2576
01:48:47,460 --> 01:48:47,860
Pretty wild.

2577
01:48:48,080 --> 01:48:48,220
Yeah.

2578
01:48:48,400 --> 01:48:48,640
Yeah.

2579
01:48:48,660 --> 01:48:51,700
Well, it was separate people.

2580
01:48:51,700 --> 01:48:55,440
Two people did the skydive and then they got like swarmed by the extras

2581
01:48:55,440 --> 01:48:59,300
and then the waiting like main stunt people popped out.

2582
01:48:59,460 --> 01:48:59,680
Smarter.

2583
01:48:59,860 --> 01:48:59,960
Smarter.

2584
01:48:59,960 --> 01:49:04,640
Who are the Brian Friday is Indiana.

2585
01:49:04,700 --> 01:49:06,880
Brian Friday is Indiana Jones.

2586
01:49:06,980 --> 01:49:08,260
That's who did this.

2587
01:49:08,660 --> 01:49:12,180
He is he and Marion are both from the Florida stunt show.

2588
01:49:12,200 --> 01:49:13,860
They're from Disney MGM Studios.

2589
01:49:14,220 --> 01:49:14,220
Nice.

2590
01:49:14,340 --> 01:49:17,140
And that's and I probably brought their own wardrobe, too.

2591
01:49:18,180 --> 01:49:19,620
It's really strange.

2592
01:49:19,940 --> 01:49:21,200
And Ethan Hunt's the perfect example.

2593
01:49:21,200 --> 01:49:24,960
I was trying to think like if that if they break from music.

2594
01:49:25,280 --> 01:49:28,020
This year's usher next year is Mission Impossible Live.

2595
01:49:28,220 --> 01:49:28,580
Oh, my God.

2596
01:49:28,580 --> 01:49:31,160
And then it's not Tom Cruise and he's not even in it.

2597
01:49:31,160 --> 01:49:32,380
He doesn't even do a voice.

2598
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:36,620
Just a guy is Ethan Hunt doing stunts.

2599
01:49:36,620 --> 01:49:37,960
And that's the Super Bowl.

2600
01:49:38,320 --> 01:49:38,760
Yeah.

2601
01:49:38,880 --> 01:49:39,860
I sounds good to me.

2602
01:49:39,880 --> 01:49:41,300
They do it better now.

2603
01:49:41,300 --> 01:49:42,140
That's what you.

2604
01:49:42,160 --> 01:49:44,480
Well, I also think there's a chance you just get time to do it.

2605
01:49:45,040 --> 01:49:49,760
I mean, oh, if he's if something's getting wonky with the French,

2606
01:49:49,760 --> 01:49:50,920
I don't know what happened.

2607
01:49:51,520 --> 01:49:54,280
I, you know, well, they they release a movie.

2608
01:49:54,280 --> 01:49:54,920
We get fine.

2609
01:49:55,220 --> 01:49:56,040
I really like it.

2610
01:49:56,040 --> 01:49:58,820
But yeah, they I think it was a bit not the right time to release it.

2611
01:49:58,960 --> 01:50:02,720
Maybe that but it kind of it's confusing because you think it'd be

2612
01:50:02,720 --> 01:50:05,040
it's Tom Cruise mania with Maverick, right?

2613
01:50:05,900 --> 01:50:08,900
At the alternate ideas that Maverick meets

2614
01:50:09,480 --> 01:50:10,360
Ethan Hunt.

2615
01:50:10,580 --> 01:50:12,940
Oh, they sure that well, that's a great movie, right?

2616
01:50:13,200 --> 01:50:13,480
Movie.

2617
01:50:13,480 --> 01:50:14,520
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

2618
01:50:15,080 --> 01:50:17,300
But they could build the dead reckoning ramp

2619
01:50:17,860 --> 01:50:19,920
in the parking lot of the Super Bowl.

2620
01:50:20,400 --> 01:50:23,580
And he does that jump and goes over the top of whatever.

2621
01:50:23,660 --> 01:50:27,620
So my stadium and then I know what now I would have gone against

2622
01:50:27,620 --> 01:50:30,340
what I just said and have like he's not with us anymore,

2623
01:50:30,360 --> 01:50:34,220
but a Robbie Knievel type to do the jump live.

2624
01:50:34,220 --> 01:50:36,780
And then Tom pops up and does another stunt or something.

2625
01:50:36,920 --> 01:50:37,480
I don't know.

2626
01:50:37,540 --> 01:50:38,680
I think it's got to be.

2627
01:50:38,700 --> 01:50:40,640
No, if you set this up, it'll all be Tom.

2628
01:50:40,780 --> 01:50:41,360
Yeah, probably.

2629
01:50:41,420 --> 01:50:42,620
That's why this just has to happen.

2630
01:50:42,760 --> 01:50:45,160
If anyway, if something weird is happening with the franchise

2631
01:50:45,160 --> 01:50:48,380
and we need to give it some new life, I think halftime show is the way to go.

2632
01:50:48,600 --> 01:50:48,700
Yeah.

2633
01:50:48,880 --> 01:50:52,420
And then the order of it is like I think I'm

2634
01:50:52,420 --> 01:50:56,000
oh, what Rihanna was it's Rihanna Usher, Tom Cruise.

2635
01:50:56,200 --> 01:50:57,880
And those are the halftime shows.

2636
01:50:57,940 --> 01:50:58,120
Perfect.

2637
01:50:58,420 --> 01:50:58,500
Yeah.

2638
01:50:58,500 --> 01:50:58,900
Yeah.

2639
01:50:59,100 --> 01:51:02,780
I mean, I think what happened with the franchise is it got blindsided

2640
01:51:02,780 --> 01:51:07,220
by the one to punch of a movie about Barbie and then a movie about

2641
01:51:07,220 --> 01:51:08,500
Robert Oppenheimer.

2642
01:51:09,180 --> 01:51:10,300
That did not help it.

2643
01:51:10,300 --> 01:51:10,560
Yeah.

2644
01:51:10,840 --> 01:51:12,560
No, same with Haunted Mansion.

2645
01:51:12,800 --> 01:51:12,940
Haunted.

2646
01:51:13,080 --> 01:51:13,900
Mark my words.

2647
01:51:13,900 --> 01:51:14,300
Well,

2648
01:51:14,300 --> 01:51:19,560
we would have all it would have been Leto Hatbox Ghost Mania out there.

2649
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:20,000
Yeah.

2650
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:23,300
It would have been the summer of Hatbox Ghost if it wasn't for those.

2651
01:51:23,740 --> 01:51:25,260
If that wasn't for that damn Barbie.

2652
01:51:25,480 --> 01:51:29,240
I think Mesh Raspals still did well, but it is wild to say like,

2653
01:51:29,480 --> 01:51:33,000
actually, the underperforming movies this year were Indiana Jones

2654
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:34,660
and the Haunted Mansion.

2655
01:51:34,680 --> 01:51:35,760
It's like, what?

2656
01:51:36,060 --> 01:51:37,060
What was over performing?

2657
01:51:37,240 --> 01:51:39,100
Oh, Barbie and Oppenheimer.

2658
01:51:39,320 --> 01:51:40,360
And I was like, what?

2659
01:51:40,900 --> 01:51:42,500
I haven't watched the entire film.

2660
01:51:42,500 --> 01:51:45,860
From what I've seen, I like this halftime show more than Dial of Destiny.

2661
01:51:48,420 --> 01:51:49,880
It's look, it's short.

2662
01:51:50,200 --> 01:51:51,340
You got to give it that at least.

2663
01:51:51,800 --> 01:51:52,020
All right.

2664
01:51:52,080 --> 01:51:54,180
Now, minus points for not having Harrison Ford,

2665
01:51:54,260 --> 01:51:59,380
but plus points for not having 20 minutes of deep fake de-aged Harrison Ford.

2666
01:52:00,120 --> 01:52:02,720
I didn't see because I like Mangold.

2667
01:52:03,160 --> 01:52:04,220
I'm usually a Mangold man.

2668
01:52:04,260 --> 01:52:05,420
James Mangold, the director.

2669
01:52:05,420 --> 01:52:06,220
James Mangold.

2670
01:52:06,480 --> 01:52:06,720
Yeah.

2671
01:52:07,180 --> 01:52:08,180
What are your Mangold?

2672
01:52:08,220 --> 01:52:09,140
But I noticed.

2673
01:52:09,900 --> 01:52:11,560
Did nobody see it in the theater?

2674
01:52:12,120 --> 01:52:13,360
No, no.

2675
01:52:13,880 --> 01:52:15,400
Mangold, but Night and Day.

2676
01:52:15,780 --> 01:52:17,240
And you've all you're a night and day guy.

2677
01:52:17,260 --> 01:52:18,640
That's your answer is Night and Day.

2678
01:52:18,820 --> 01:52:19,600
Night and Day.

2679
01:52:20,180 --> 01:52:22,080
It's a big, kooky action movie.

2680
01:52:22,660 --> 01:52:25,380
The biggest smile you've had on your face all record is Night and Day.

2681
01:52:25,840 --> 01:52:29,320
I watched Night and Day a while ago and I was like, I like Night and Day.

2682
01:52:29,440 --> 01:52:33,800
Coca-Cola presents Super Bowl halftime show, Night and Day Live.

2683
01:52:37,140 --> 01:52:42,000
So anyways, so it is it's not Harrison and no presence from Harrison.

2684
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,340
There's lines, but it is not recorded by Harrison.

2685
01:52:44,900 --> 01:52:46,340
But it is nuts.

2686
01:52:46,700 --> 01:52:49,120
They skydive in and then it is pure action.

2687
01:52:49,400 --> 01:52:51,520
Bunch of like, let's know.

2688
01:52:51,620 --> 01:52:52,640
Stay by Marion.

2689
01:52:52,880 --> 01:52:54,260
Stay behind me.

2690
01:52:54,380 --> 01:52:56,300
Marion's in Marion's not in the ride.

2691
01:52:56,400 --> 01:52:57,920
This is now we're getting a whole other thing.

2692
01:52:58,040 --> 01:53:00,640
No, it's mostly like the stunt show.

2693
01:53:00,640 --> 01:53:02,200
Yeah, it's very stunt show.

2694
01:53:02,200 --> 01:53:04,660
You promote a ride on the other coast.

2695
01:53:05,140 --> 01:53:09,100
A guy gets lit on fire and she has to do it.

2696
01:53:09,580 --> 01:53:10,780
Very slowly.

2697
01:53:11,460 --> 01:53:11,500
Yeah.

2698
01:53:11,640 --> 01:53:12,320
Very carefully.

2699
01:53:12,340 --> 01:53:14,840
But it's crazy to sit live on the Super Bowl.

2700
01:53:15,040 --> 01:53:18,720
It's not just like somebody back there kind of quietly does it.

2701
01:53:18,840 --> 01:53:24,400
Like one actress has to light another guy on fire who tumbles into a pit.

2702
01:53:25,520 --> 01:53:26,600
I mean, I don't know.

2703
01:53:26,820 --> 01:53:30,620
I'm suddenly I've this one comes up in the lists of worst Super Bowl

2704
01:53:30,620 --> 01:53:31,960
halftime shows, but not.

2705
01:53:32,220 --> 01:53:34,400
Yeah, let's let's let's get that word out of here.

2706
01:53:34,500 --> 01:53:37,960
I think come on, if this happened today, there is a big stunt show.

2707
01:53:38,160 --> 01:53:38,480
Love it.

2708
01:53:38,560 --> 01:53:38,860
Yes.

2709
01:53:39,100 --> 01:53:39,400
Yes.

2710
01:53:39,620 --> 01:53:39,940
Absolutely.

2711
01:53:40,180 --> 01:53:41,340
Absolutely epic.

2712
01:53:42,280 --> 01:53:44,780
That do you like the snake handlers?

2713
01:53:44,860 --> 01:53:45,880
Do you catch that shot?

2714
01:53:46,200 --> 01:53:47,140
Other snake handlers.

2715
01:53:47,140 --> 01:53:48,140
So much going on.

2716
01:53:48,320 --> 01:53:50,660
Guys, two guys have big snakes.

2717
01:53:50,920 --> 01:53:52,400
Real snakes, real snakes.

2718
01:53:52,400 --> 01:53:56,080
And they kind of slowly rotate around the Indiana Jones.

2719
01:53:56,620 --> 01:53:57,780
They sort of walk.

2720
01:53:57,780 --> 01:54:01,680
And then at the very end, they're standing behind him perfectly,

2721
01:54:01,680 --> 01:54:05,020
still holding the snakes because you're all so you could tell.

2722
01:54:05,180 --> 01:54:08,360
It's like we have to be very careful with these snakes

2723
01:54:08,360 --> 01:54:10,500
in the middle of the football field.

2724
01:54:10,940 --> 01:54:13,740
There's yes, there's snakes at the 50 yard line.

2725
01:54:13,740 --> 01:54:16,220
And then the game will continue in 10 minutes.

2726
01:54:16,220 --> 01:54:17,580
Yeah, that's so awesome.

2727
01:54:17,620 --> 01:54:19,160
So they're moving very slowly.

2728
01:54:19,160 --> 01:54:21,440
And you can tell they're standing very care.

2729
01:54:21,520 --> 01:54:23,960
I mean, they they don't seem like aggressive snakes.

2730
01:54:24,660 --> 01:54:27,520
They're not the biggest, but it's still two guys holding

2731
01:54:27,520 --> 01:54:32,020
like each holding like a two to three feet long snakes.

2732
01:54:32,420 --> 01:54:33,180
They got mellowed out.

2733
01:54:33,200 --> 01:54:35,740
They were given weed by Anthony Kiedis' father.

2734
01:54:36,380 --> 01:54:36,380
Yeah.

2735
01:54:36,800 --> 01:54:38,740
This is always outside of the Super Bowl.

2736
01:54:39,020 --> 01:54:41,820
I mean, we got all right.

2737
01:54:41,900 --> 01:54:43,080
We filled out the drummers.

2738
01:54:43,220 --> 01:54:46,520
We filled out that the people are going to surround the skydivers

2739
01:54:46,520 --> 01:54:47,540
to do the switch.

2740
01:54:48,060 --> 01:54:49,620
Get Blackie Damond on the phone.

2741
01:54:49,860 --> 01:54:52,940
We need we need a little we got to mellow out a little.

2742
01:54:53,920 --> 01:54:54,840
Tensions are high.

2743
01:54:54,840 --> 01:54:58,720
I mean, they must have been because to pepper in behind the scenes stuff,

2744
01:55:00,300 --> 01:55:03,500
this they this was never we said this, that a lot of these things

2745
01:55:03,500 --> 01:55:04,940
are kind of like never rehearsed barely.

2746
01:55:04,940 --> 01:55:07,980
Whereas this was never run through fully on the field.

2747
01:55:08,080 --> 01:55:10,380
There's a live stunt show where somebody's lit on fire

2748
01:55:10,380 --> 01:55:12,780
and there are live snakes that was never truly done.

2749
01:55:13,060 --> 01:55:14,600
They did it in the parking lot.

2750
01:55:14,680 --> 01:55:17,600
They ran in the parking lot once, but it had never happened

2751
01:55:17,600 --> 01:55:19,420
actually in the center of the field.

2752
01:55:19,520 --> 01:55:20,300
Yeah, crazy.

2753
01:55:20,640 --> 01:55:21,260
So insane.

2754
01:55:23,180 --> 01:55:25,780
So and also that they never did it with like

2755
01:55:25,780 --> 01:55:28,440
getting into the state of putting all this stuff up,

2756
01:55:28,440 --> 01:55:30,280
breaking it down, tearing it all away.

2757
01:55:30,460 --> 01:55:33,100
And some but somehow I think everybody just had a fucking attitude.

2758
01:55:34,240 --> 01:55:35,380
Let's let's try it.

2759
01:55:35,500 --> 01:55:36,120
And it worked.

2760
01:55:36,840 --> 01:55:38,940
One note that I found in looking up behind the scenes,

2761
01:55:38,940 --> 01:55:42,760
things about all Super Bowl halftime shows, a the artists don't get paid.

2762
01:55:42,780 --> 01:55:43,040
Right.

2763
01:55:43,060 --> 01:55:44,780
And you think, well, that's just that's an exposure thing.

2764
01:55:44,840 --> 01:55:45,000
Sure.

2765
01:55:45,080 --> 01:55:48,340
But B, neither does anyone else on the field.

2766
01:55:48,600 --> 01:55:48,820
No.

2767
01:55:49,180 --> 01:55:50,980
This was at least for a long time.

2768
01:55:50,980 --> 01:55:52,100
If not still true today.

2769
01:55:52,420 --> 01:55:56,240
So many times I saw an all volunteer cast, a bunch of like

2770
01:55:56,240 --> 01:55:59,320
like a lot of the fighters in this are like from their volunteers

2771
01:55:59,320 --> 01:56:01,700
from karate academies around Miami.

2772
01:56:02,120 --> 01:56:02,180
Wild.

2773
01:56:02,380 --> 01:56:02,900
Why?

2774
01:56:03,200 --> 01:56:04,240
It's the Super Bowl.

2775
01:56:04,320 --> 01:56:05,980
There's so much money flying around.

2776
01:56:06,440 --> 01:56:09,520
What need could there be for this to be volunteer?

2777
01:56:09,680 --> 01:56:10,680
There's no need.

2778
01:56:11,740 --> 01:56:11,740
Yeah.

2779
01:56:12,020 --> 01:56:12,020
OK.

2780
01:56:12,260 --> 01:56:12,380
Yes.

2781
01:56:12,380 --> 01:56:13,340
Need is the wrong word.

2782
01:56:13,420 --> 01:56:16,640
And that still holds for like professional dancers.

2783
01:56:16,640 --> 01:56:17,580
I don't know.

2784
01:56:17,580 --> 01:56:22,460
Like Rihanna had a lot of dancers doing very complicated

2785
01:56:22,460 --> 01:56:24,060
moves last year.

2786
01:56:24,400 --> 01:56:25,200
I don't know.

2787
01:56:25,420 --> 01:56:26,800
Do you have to pay your own dancers then?

2788
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:28,540
I think maybe they cover.

2789
01:56:28,660 --> 01:56:33,380
I mean, they do cover like all of the setup and accommodations and all that.

2790
01:56:33,600 --> 01:56:35,500
So like they don't give nothing.

2791
01:56:35,800 --> 01:56:38,780
But it's, you know, much like a funny or die video.

2792
01:56:38,900 --> 01:56:43,500
They don't pay the star at the center of the video or anyone else in the video.

2793
01:56:43,900 --> 01:56:44,920
Which makes sense, right?

2794
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:46,080
So therefore you wouldn't have to pay.

2795
01:56:46,080 --> 01:56:49,020
If you don't pay this person with a million dollars, you don't pay this person with zero dollars.

2796
01:56:50,980 --> 01:56:53,040
So this thing keeps going.

2797
01:56:53,480 --> 01:56:55,820
Indiana Jones and Marion get lost.

2798
01:56:56,320 --> 01:56:59,860
They're like, and now we're like in the marketplace and like, truly, you're like,

2799
01:56:59,860 --> 01:57:02,580
I wonder if everybody doing it was like, I don't know where this is going.

2800
01:57:02,600 --> 01:57:03,120
I don't know.

2801
01:57:03,360 --> 01:57:03,600
I don't.

2802
01:57:04,080 --> 01:57:06,480
We the choreography was no choreography.

2803
01:57:08,060 --> 01:57:11,720
And then they end up at like a nightclub

2804
01:57:11,720 --> 01:57:15,940
and they sit at a table and watch Tony Bennett perform.

2805
01:57:16,080 --> 01:57:19,380
Yeah, Tony Bennett is here and the nightclub scene is set up.

2806
01:57:19,380 --> 01:57:21,220
And I'm like, I have forgotten.

2807
01:57:21,300 --> 01:57:27,440
And I'm like, oh, my God, are they about to do the Temple of Doom nightclub sequence?

2808
01:57:28,060 --> 01:57:28,060
Yeah.

2809
01:57:29,080 --> 01:57:32,260
But no, it's a sixty nine year old Tony Bennett.

2810
01:57:32,580 --> 01:57:33,340
He's sixty nine.

2811
01:57:33,340 --> 01:57:35,000
He's sixty nine at the time.

2812
01:57:35,040 --> 01:57:38,760
He seems very tired and he's still going today.

2813
01:57:39,680 --> 01:57:40,840
No, he's passed away.

2814
01:57:40,860 --> 01:57:41,160
He's dead.

2815
01:57:41,320 --> 01:57:41,560
Yes.

2816
01:57:41,660 --> 01:57:42,260
Oh, did he?

2817
01:57:42,340 --> 01:57:42,640
He did.

2818
01:57:42,920 --> 01:57:43,380
Oh, yeah.

2819
01:57:43,440 --> 01:57:44,580
Oh, well, I missed it.

2820
01:57:44,580 --> 01:57:47,200
But it sounds like I'd like that to be true.

2821
01:57:47,220 --> 01:57:51,320
But he did do a couple of those duet albums with Lady Gaga.

2822
01:57:51,340 --> 01:57:51,960
Well, sure.

2823
01:57:52,120 --> 01:57:54,040
So he was performing at the end of his life.

2824
01:57:54,300 --> 01:57:56,840
But before he was dead, he was alive.

2825
01:57:57,360 --> 01:57:57,820
Yeah.

2826
01:57:58,820 --> 01:58:00,760
I just want to cover your song.

2827
01:58:00,760 --> 01:58:01,800
I was wrong.

2828
01:58:04,500 --> 01:58:06,520
But when did he pass?

2829
01:58:06,960 --> 01:58:06,980
He wasn't alive.

2830
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:08,300
In the last year or two?

2831
01:58:08,800 --> 01:58:10,060
Yeah, anyway.

2832
01:58:12,260 --> 01:58:13,760
Here's the tomorrow live times.

2833
01:58:15,400 --> 01:58:21,940
Ladies and gentlemen, the club proudly presents the incomparable Mr.

2834
01:58:22,240 --> 01:58:23,560
Tony Bennett.

2835
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:34,640
If you listen close, he insisted on performing live.

2836
01:58:35,100 --> 01:58:35,100
Yeah.

2837
01:58:35,240 --> 01:58:36,100
And Patti LaBelle did not.

2838
01:58:36,120 --> 01:58:37,060
That was all pre-recorded.

2839
01:58:37,340 --> 01:58:37,340
Right.

2840
01:58:37,580 --> 01:58:40,420
But being singing live mean that he was like not.

2841
01:58:40,580 --> 01:58:41,100
Yeah.

2842
01:58:41,100 --> 01:58:41,260
Yeah.

2843
01:58:41,260 --> 01:58:42,640
I don't think he can hear the music.

2844
01:58:42,640 --> 01:58:44,020
And I don't think that's even his fault.

2845
01:58:44,020 --> 01:58:45,760
There's a bunch of so much fucking shit.

2846
01:58:45,780 --> 01:58:46,660
He seems distracted.

2847
01:58:46,880 --> 01:58:47,140
Yeah.

2848
01:58:47,140 --> 01:58:47,380
Yeah.

2849
01:58:47,400 --> 01:58:49,840
Well, he's distracted because immediately behind him,

2850
01:58:49,900 --> 01:58:53,200
two feet behind him are a bunch of people dressed as waiters.

2851
01:58:53,200 --> 01:58:57,860
So you won't notice them tearing and pawing at the set because they are the people

2852
01:58:57,860 --> 01:58:58,680
putting it up.

2853
01:58:58,860 --> 01:59:01,520
And then look, they're going to go in and then lights turn on.

2854
01:59:02,540 --> 01:59:06,280
Like and I in this Bleacher Report article about it, they do say like the guy

2855
01:59:06,280 --> 01:59:08,140
producing it was just on the floor.

2856
01:59:08,280 --> 01:59:08,440
All right.

2857
01:59:08,440 --> 01:59:10,760
Now I'm a waiter and now I can put this up so that while we're before

2858
01:59:10,760 --> 01:59:15,080
like it seems like one man was like running around and plugging everything in himself.

2859
01:59:15,080 --> 01:59:17,860
That's how like tossed together this was insane.

2860
01:59:17,980 --> 01:59:21,660
He is standing pretty still like Michael Jackson before him.

2861
01:59:22,240 --> 01:59:22,900
That's true.

2862
01:59:23,040 --> 01:59:23,240
Yeah.

2863
01:59:23,380 --> 01:59:25,700
But there's also a lot of movement around him.

2864
01:59:25,940 --> 01:59:26,680
So, yeah, yes.

2865
01:59:27,200 --> 01:59:27,420
Yeah.

2866
01:59:27,500 --> 01:59:31,080
No, like the dancers, big headdresses and all that.

2867
01:59:31,300 --> 01:59:35,920
You might notice in that clip that they say, and now the club presents.

2868
01:59:36,740 --> 01:59:38,620
And like, why is it the club club?

2869
01:59:38,620 --> 01:59:41,040
They didn't come up with kind of an Indiana Jonesy.

2870
01:59:41,040 --> 01:59:45,480
And then I found a like news piece

2871
01:59:45,480 --> 01:59:49,180
about this thing being prepared in the parking lot.

2872
01:59:49,440 --> 01:59:53,980
And in that you can see a set of this club.

2873
01:59:54,300 --> 01:59:56,500
And I don't think it's true in the actual show.

2874
01:59:57,760 --> 02:00:01,320
In the in rehearsal, the club set said

2875
02:00:01,320 --> 02:00:02,700
Club Disneyland.

2876
02:00:04,380 --> 02:00:05,540
But they did.

2877
02:00:06,040 --> 02:00:07,060
Yeah, yeah.

2878
02:00:07,060 --> 02:00:09,460
They decided like because now we're where are we?

2879
02:00:09,480 --> 02:00:13,140
Tony Bennett's there and it's Club Disneyland, but it's on the Super Bowl floor.

2880
02:00:13,140 --> 02:00:14,720
But it's in the 30s.

2881
02:00:14,740 --> 02:00:15,520
What's happening?

2882
02:00:16,320 --> 02:00:16,780
Yeah.

2883
02:00:17,520 --> 02:00:20,380
Our at some point, Arturo Sandoval.

2884
02:00:21,320 --> 02:00:23,120
He's in it.

2885
02:00:23,220 --> 02:00:23,880
Trumpet player.

2886
02:00:23,900 --> 02:00:24,800
Trumpet player.

2887
02:00:24,940 --> 02:00:25,240
Yeah.

2888
02:00:26,540 --> 02:00:30,220
The Emilio Estefan was the music director of this.

2889
02:00:30,300 --> 02:00:31,460
I learned from that.

2890
02:00:31,460 --> 02:00:31,860
Oh, wow.

2891
02:00:32,420 --> 02:00:32,420
Yes.

2892
02:00:32,820 --> 02:00:33,540
Gloria's husband.

2893
02:00:34,260 --> 02:00:38,620
And the band behind them is Miami Sound Machine,

2894
02:00:39,080 --> 02:00:42,760
which is notable towards the end.

2895
02:00:42,960 --> 02:00:44,000
And we're in the finale.

2896
02:00:44,340 --> 02:00:47,060
A guy in a tuxedo comes up playing a keytar.

2897
02:00:47,600 --> 02:00:49,480
And that, I think, is one of the sound machine.

2898
02:00:51,040 --> 02:00:54,520
So there's this performance of the song Caravan,

2899
02:00:54,640 --> 02:00:57,040
which I only previously knew as a Red Man sample.

2900
02:00:57,080 --> 02:00:57,560
Oh, yeah.

2901
02:00:57,640 --> 02:00:58,480
I played Caravan.

2902
02:00:58,840 --> 02:01:00,440
I played it in high school band.

2903
02:01:01,200 --> 02:01:01,740
Oh, OK.

2904
02:01:01,860 --> 02:01:02,960
Yeah, it's a fun one.

2905
02:01:03,560 --> 02:01:06,860
And then you kind of lose track of Indiana Jones and Marion.

2906
02:01:06,900 --> 02:01:09,440
And then you realize they're just sitting and watching this at a table.

2907
02:01:09,800 --> 02:01:11,860
And the trophy is on the table.

2908
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:15,720
And then a big second fight happens and the trophy is stolen.

2909
02:01:15,780 --> 02:01:19,860
And the trophy goes flying around at some point.

2910
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:23,640
Here's this is a Kathy Marshall, who played Marion and is also from the stunt

2911
02:01:23,640 --> 02:01:24,980
show in Florida.

2912
02:01:25,360 --> 02:01:28,880
The night we filmed the extra got really excited and threw the trophy really hard.

2913
02:01:28,940 --> 02:01:30,360
It hit me right in my nose.

2914
02:01:30,360 --> 02:01:30,940
Oh, no.

2915
02:01:30,960 --> 02:01:34,540
I had two black guys and a lot of makeup on for the Super Bowl.

2916
02:01:34,740 --> 02:01:35,200
Geez.

2917
02:01:35,760 --> 02:01:36,340
That sucks.

2918
02:01:37,480 --> 02:01:37,940
Yeah.

2919
02:01:38,180 --> 02:01:39,980
And then it's all chaos.

2920
02:01:40,240 --> 02:01:42,420
Because there's like at some point, somebody's wig comes off

2921
02:01:42,420 --> 02:01:44,420
with this weird, like silent movie hijinks.

2922
02:01:44,660 --> 02:01:46,620
A guy flies into a piano.

2923
02:01:46,900 --> 02:01:49,260
And the one guy I was talking about, who seemed to be running around

2924
02:01:49,260 --> 02:01:51,920
doing everything himself at some point.

2925
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:54,020
OK, the piano gags about to happen.

2926
02:01:54,040 --> 02:01:57,960
And he says, I had to make sure that the pin on the collapsible leg was pulled.

2927
02:01:57,960 --> 02:02:00,280
For some reason, it didn't get pulled properly.

2928
02:02:00,360 --> 02:02:02,000
So I'm hollering to the stuntman.

2929
02:02:02,160 --> 02:02:03,760
The piano will not collapse.

2930
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:05,740
The piano will not collapse.

2931
02:02:06,740 --> 02:02:11,420
One guy is just like aware of every gag and every pin and every thing

2932
02:02:11,420 --> 02:02:12,620
that has to be on the wall.

2933
02:02:12,900 --> 02:02:14,060
God bless you, sir.

2934
02:02:14,440 --> 02:02:14,700
Mr.

2935
02:02:14,940 --> 02:02:16,140
Assad, I'm not sure.

2936
02:02:16,280 --> 02:02:17,800
Didn't track the first name.

2937
02:02:18,740 --> 02:02:22,380
The sword guy's fire, either spikes pop up and then Indiana Jones

2938
02:02:22,380 --> 02:02:24,060
gets the trophy back again.

2939
02:02:24,880 --> 02:02:27,200
So it happens once and it happens again.

2940
02:02:27,200 --> 02:02:32,360
And then all of the oh, that's something Mara talks about,

2941
02:02:32,400 --> 02:02:34,260
like you'll be doomed for all eternity.

2942
02:02:34,800 --> 02:02:40,160
And then this great little scene happens with

2943
02:02:41,260 --> 02:02:46,380
all the stars at last, the meeting of Indiana Jones and Patti LaBelle.

2944
02:02:47,020 --> 02:02:47,040
Mm hmm.

2945
02:02:47,160 --> 02:02:50,560
Well, Indiana Jones, you got your trophy back.

2946
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:53,200
So now tell me, what's next?

2947
02:02:53,460 --> 02:02:56,260
I'm giving it to the winner of Super Bowl 29.

2948
02:02:56,260 --> 02:02:58,500
Well, that's a great attitude, baby.

2949
02:03:04,020 --> 02:03:05,340
That's a great attitude.

2950
02:03:05,360 --> 02:03:06,080
That's great.

2951
02:03:06,280 --> 02:03:06,900
It's perfect.

2952
02:03:07,220 --> 02:03:08,500
I'm giving it to the winner.

2953
02:03:08,540 --> 02:03:09,960
Almost sounds like John Wayne at the start.

2954
02:03:10,080 --> 02:03:13,680
I'm giving it to the like, yeah, I'm Howard Cosa.

2955
02:03:13,880 --> 02:03:14,300
Whatever.

2956
02:03:14,860 --> 02:03:16,520
Someone of those guys with the old voice.

2957
02:03:16,680 --> 02:03:17,780
Yeah, I love it.

2958
02:03:17,780 --> 02:03:18,600
I love what this is.

2959
02:03:18,640 --> 02:03:23,240
I kind of like this era where in the ride and this show, they just end the stunt show.

2960
02:03:23,240 --> 02:03:26,900
Everybody decided Indiana Jones is whoever wants to be Indiana Jones.

2961
02:03:26,900 --> 02:03:27,620
Sure, yeah.

2962
02:03:27,940 --> 02:03:29,480
It was truly open.

2963
02:03:29,520 --> 02:03:31,380
We didn't have to get Harrison and D.

2964
02:03:31,380 --> 02:03:31,580
H.

2965
02:03:31,700 --> 02:03:32,060
Harrison.

2966
02:03:32,440 --> 02:03:33,300
And I like this.

2967
02:03:33,300 --> 02:03:34,440
I like this performance.

2968
02:03:34,580 --> 02:03:34,920
You know what?

2969
02:03:35,040 --> 02:03:36,740
This is my Indiana Jones.

2970
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:38,320
Super Bowl 29.

2971
02:03:38,580 --> 02:03:39,560
Well, that's the right attitude.

2972
02:03:39,960 --> 02:03:41,200
That's the right attitude.

2973
02:03:42,240 --> 02:03:43,500
Oh, it is great.

2974
02:03:43,520 --> 02:03:44,780
I mean, that is yes.

2975
02:03:44,980 --> 02:03:47,580
You can't not like it, especially coming from the part,

2976
02:03:47,880 --> 02:03:51,260
the fact that it is canon now in the Indiana Jones ride universe.

2977
02:03:51,260 --> 02:03:55,860
Well, this brings me to a point that I discovered that has been discussed.

2978
02:03:55,860 --> 02:03:56,240
Yeah.

2979
02:03:56,240 --> 02:03:59,100
Is this halftime show canon?

2980
02:03:59,540 --> 02:04:03,100
This has been dealt with by the Indiana Jones fan community.

2981
02:04:03,100 --> 02:04:03,760
OK, good.

2982
02:04:04,020 --> 02:04:05,640
They've gone over this because it involves

2983
02:04:05,640 --> 02:04:07,640
all right, because the ride is canon, right?

2984
02:04:08,140 --> 02:04:12,120
Mara's canon, the idea that Indiana Jones had to be at

2985
02:04:12,600 --> 02:04:14,200
the Temple of the Forbidden Eye.

2986
02:04:14,400 --> 02:04:14,740
And that's right.

2987
02:04:14,800 --> 02:04:17,320
So this this was gone over.

2988
02:04:17,320 --> 02:04:21,420
And in fact, they asked

2989
02:04:22,380 --> 02:04:24,260
Leland Chee about this.

2990
02:04:24,640 --> 02:04:28,340
Leland Chee is called Keeper of the Holocron.

2991
02:04:28,740 --> 02:04:33,480
He is the person who in Lucasfilm tracks all of the

2992
02:04:33,960 --> 02:04:36,060
tracks all of the canon and the consistency.

2993
02:04:36,240 --> 02:04:38,040
He's a big Lucasfilm story person.

2994
02:04:38,080 --> 02:04:39,740
And he was asked about this.

2995
02:04:39,980 --> 02:04:41,760
Is the halftime show canon?

2996
02:04:42,280 --> 02:04:46,220
And he says, no, according to my notes, the Temple of the Forbidden

2997
02:04:46,220 --> 02:04:50,160
Eye attraction is set in 1935, which would make it impossible

2998
02:04:50,160 --> 02:04:52,980
for Indy to be with Marion at this time.

2999
02:04:53,440 --> 02:04:56,020
OK, so I didn't I don't think I realize this.

3000
02:04:56,140 --> 02:05:00,280
The ride and therefore the halftime show are set in 1935.

3001
02:05:00,640 --> 02:05:00,840
Interesting.

3002
02:05:01,020 --> 02:05:03,420
That is one year before Raiders of the Lost Ark,

3003
02:05:03,480 --> 02:05:07,460
which is 1936, which is some kind of reunion with Marion.

3004
02:05:07,520 --> 02:05:07,760
Right.

3005
02:05:07,840 --> 02:05:08,140
Yes.

3006
02:05:08,580 --> 02:05:10,380
So yeah.

3007
02:05:10,420 --> 02:05:12,100
So they're out of each other's orbit.

3008
02:05:12,800 --> 02:05:14,340
And I like that.

3009
02:05:14,560 --> 02:05:16,520
That's why it's not canon.

3010
02:05:16,820 --> 02:05:21,840
It's it's not canon because of 1935, not because Patty Labelle is in it.

3011
02:05:21,840 --> 02:05:23,200
Time traveling Tony Bennett.

3012
02:05:24,620 --> 02:05:28,780
A Tony Bennett from our time, not a what?

3013
02:05:29,600 --> 02:05:31,120
A five year old Tony Bennett.

3014
02:05:32,720 --> 02:05:37,500
But yet the Indiana Jones fandom dot com has to reckon with this.

3015
02:05:37,560 --> 02:05:40,760
And they put every they give everything this like specific classification

3016
02:05:40,760 --> 02:05:44,240
where, like, you know, you know, whatever the first time Sala showed up,

3017
02:05:44,260 --> 02:05:45,960
they'll put in the notes first appearance.

3018
02:05:46,340 --> 02:05:49,260
So they have to do it with this where they go Mara first appearance.

3019
02:05:49,480 --> 02:05:51,100
Patty Labelle first appearance.

3020
02:05:51,720 --> 02:05:54,760
Arturo Sandoval first appearance locations.

3021
02:05:54,940 --> 02:05:56,860
Club Disneyland first appearance.

3022
02:05:57,040 --> 02:05:57,480
Oh, yeah.

3023
02:05:57,960 --> 02:05:58,440
Artifacts.

3024
02:05:58,560 --> 02:06:01,100
Vince Lombardi Trophy first appearance.

3025
02:06:01,560 --> 02:06:01,940
Wow.

3026
02:06:02,160 --> 02:06:02,300
Right.

3027
02:06:02,380 --> 02:06:04,820
There was the Ark and then there was the Vince Lombardi Trophy.

3028
02:06:04,840 --> 02:06:06,580
So they're still dealing with it.

3029
02:06:06,580 --> 02:06:08,840
They're giving it the respect it deserves.

3030
02:06:09,580 --> 02:06:13,200
And I hope so are we because I this one I love.

3031
02:06:13,460 --> 02:06:14,640
I know we just had an all.

3032
02:06:14,760 --> 02:06:17,840
But the other stuff didn't have sword swallowing spikes and stunts.

3033
02:06:17,840 --> 02:06:18,540
This is cool.

3034
02:06:18,540 --> 02:06:20,820
This is the most theme park theme park.

3035
02:06:21,200 --> 02:06:22,100
Goofy one.

3036
02:06:22,100 --> 02:06:22,360
Yeah.

3037
02:06:22,360 --> 02:06:22,420
Stream.

3038
02:06:22,520 --> 02:06:24,680
We got 12 minute when we were kids.

3039
02:06:24,740 --> 02:06:27,040
We got 12 minutes of theme park nonsense.

3040
02:06:27,040 --> 02:06:27,600
Yeah, I know.

3041
02:06:27,600 --> 02:06:28,820
In the Super Bowl.

3042
02:06:28,940 --> 02:06:31,580
And that's maybe more than we can ask for today.

3043
02:06:31,640 --> 02:06:34,140
So let's let's fire one of these things up.

3044
02:06:34,140 --> 02:06:35,240
Let's do Ethan Hunt.

3045
02:06:35,300 --> 02:06:36,760
Let's do John Wick live.

3046
02:06:36,760 --> 02:06:38,120
And it's just some guy.

3047
02:06:38,120 --> 02:06:38,940
Sure.

3048
02:06:39,160 --> 02:06:39,940
Yeah, not.

3049
02:06:40,340 --> 02:06:43,740
They I think we're past this franchise, but there should have been

3050
02:06:43,740 --> 02:06:47,520
a taken halftime show for all three takings.

3051
02:06:47,720 --> 02:06:48,740
Every single year.

3052
02:06:48,840 --> 02:06:49,060
Yeah.

3053
02:06:49,260 --> 02:06:50,160
My daughter.

3054
02:06:50,920 --> 02:06:52,600
And she also has a Super Bowl trophy.

3055
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:54,420
She's been taken with the trophy.

3056
02:06:55,080 --> 02:06:56,020
And then he's got to go.

3057
02:06:56,160 --> 02:06:56,420
Yeah.

3058
02:06:56,660 --> 02:06:58,360
My daughter was tasked with

3059
02:06:59,720 --> 02:07:01,120
delivering the trophy.

3060
02:07:01,120 --> 02:07:01,600
Right.

3061
02:07:01,820 --> 02:07:02,500
It was kidnapped.

3062
02:07:04,220 --> 02:07:06,120
Anyway, it's it's great.

3063
02:07:06,120 --> 02:07:07,880
The fun to go through all these.

3064
02:07:08,080 --> 02:07:12,000
And now what this opens up is Super Bowl halftime shows, too.

3065
02:07:12,240 --> 02:07:15,780
In which time we will certainly meet Elvis Presto.

3066
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:20,960
He of the Bop Bamboozled and the Bop Bamboozled

3067
02:07:20,960 --> 02:07:23,720
in the disco, which I will fully remove

3068
02:07:23,720 --> 02:07:26,480
this Indiana Jones one from the discussion of worst.

3069
02:07:26,520 --> 02:07:27,060
Of course.

3070
02:07:27,240 --> 02:07:28,880
But I will put one in

3071
02:07:28,880 --> 02:07:33,640
and I without going into it any further, we'll just this will be a tease

3072
02:07:33,640 --> 02:07:34,440
for next time.

3073
02:07:34,580 --> 02:07:36,540
Three words that might

3074
02:07:37,460 --> 02:07:38,960
terrify you to your core.

3075
02:07:39,380 --> 02:07:42,600
The words are Blues Brothers Bash.

3076
02:07:44,780 --> 02:07:47,540
That you survived this year of podcast.

3077
02:07:47,960 --> 02:07:48,580
Killing.

3078
02:07:48,900 --> 02:07:49,320
Yeah, I know.

3079
02:07:49,400 --> 02:07:51,500
Just start imagining what it is.

3080
02:07:51,500 --> 02:07:54,960
Get familiar with it because, you know, I can only imagine

3081
02:07:54,960 --> 02:07:57,440
there'll be 90 minutes about only that.

3082
02:07:57,800 --> 02:08:00,880
Then doing a little bit of football.

3083
02:08:01,040 --> 02:08:02,240
I need a football hero.

3084
02:08:03,140 --> 02:08:05,900
And the mouth harp, you know, we're doing that song.

3085
02:08:06,020 --> 02:08:06,920
We're good.

3086
02:08:07,080 --> 02:08:09,780
Or Michael, you know, we already gave it up for Chicago,

3087
02:08:09,860 --> 02:08:12,120
but now it's time to give it up for Hollywood.

3088
02:08:13,060 --> 02:08:15,280
That's a Ballyhooey Hollywood.

3089
02:08:16,820 --> 02:08:17,040
All right.

3090
02:08:17,120 --> 02:08:18,600
Well, that's coming next year.

3091
02:08:18,600 --> 02:08:20,560
You can find us on the socials at podcast.

3097
02:08:32,480 --> 02:08:36,140
The ride related to this things coming to the second gate.

3098
02:08:36,960 --> 02:08:39,320
I still want to get to the opening of the sky dome.

3099
02:08:39,320 --> 02:08:41,480
It's kind of in the same zone as this.

3100
02:08:42,140 --> 02:08:46,240
And without saying what it is, I think my birthday shot in July

3101
02:08:46,240 --> 02:08:48,500
might be in this neck of the woods.

3102
02:08:48,760 --> 02:08:49,240
Great.

3103
02:08:49,680 --> 02:08:51,300
So start start imagining.

3104
02:08:51,980 --> 02:08:55,300
I would I would never claim Blues Brothers Bash for myself.

3105
02:08:55,300 --> 02:08:56,840
That would be far too selfish.

3106
02:08:56,880 --> 02:08:57,940
Thank you for doing that.

3107
02:08:57,940 --> 02:08:58,280
Never.

3108
02:08:58,460 --> 02:08:58,700
Never.

3109
02:08:58,700 --> 02:08:59,620
That belongs to all of us.

3110
02:08:59,640 --> 02:09:00,220
I wouldn't do it.

3111
02:09:00,300 --> 02:09:01,640
It belongs to everyone in America.

3112
02:09:02,160 --> 02:09:04,460
