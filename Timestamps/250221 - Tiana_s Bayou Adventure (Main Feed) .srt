1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
FOREVER!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
DOG!

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Warning, the following podcasts may contain moments of Father Serenity,

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Poncho Gifting,

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Frog Love,

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Cold Place History of Coolness,

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and we finally take a ride on Tiana's Bayou Adventure.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Hey, we gotta get to the party!

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
It's podcast, The Ride!

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Welcome to Podcast, The Ride, where we will do an episode about this ride,

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
even though we started so many Change.org petitions to stop it.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm Scott Gardner, joined by Mike Carlson.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Hi, yes, mask off.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
We've been fighting so hard to change this ride back.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
We just finally feel comfortable to tell you.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Is it like, do you try to get more signatures into one,

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
or do you try to get 50 separate petitions all with a good amount of signatures,

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
which is what we ended up electing to do?

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I mean, we were using every email address to start as many different Change.org accounts as we could,

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
and they still built this thing.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Yeah, it's weird.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I mean, I drew a lot of pictures of me smiling going on the original ride,

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
and I sent them to everyone's homes, the Imagineers' homes, the executives' homes,

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
and that didn't work either.

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You want to take this away from me?

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
You want to wipe this smile from Young Me's memory face?

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
This is what it is.

28
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Now it is frown.

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Now you have turned smile into frown, which is upside down.

30
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
That's right.

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I wrote, now you have turned smile into frown on every photo.

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
In blood.

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Yeah.

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Welcome.

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Hey, returning triumphantly to the main feed.

36
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
It's Jason Sheridan.

37
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Hi, I'm back.

38
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Hey, welcome back, my friend.

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Thank you.

40
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Good to have you here.

41
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Welcome back.

42
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Although people may have heard you on Club 3,

43
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
where we talked about the sweat box in the recent past fun episode.

44
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Check it out at www.patreon.com slash podcast the ride.

45
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
But glad to have you back, buddy.

46
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Thank you so much.

47
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
And look at that hat.

48
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You got that hot stuff hat.

49
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I got this hot stuff.

50
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
He's got a hot stuff hat, yeah.

51
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Scott got me.

52
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Up at CityWalk, up at the construction site that is modern CityWalk.

53
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Oh, yeah.

54
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Oh, yeah, right.

55
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Something's going to have to happen with that soon.

56
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Otherwise, it's going to leak into every other episode.

57
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I know, because that's all we want to talk about, really.

58
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Again, it's all changing so quickly.

59
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
At the time that I went up there, it was much less the case

60
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
to where recently other people have gone and said,

61
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
anybody been lately?

62
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And we're like, yeah.

63
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
And they said, it's grim up here.

64
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
It's not looking good up here.

65
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
People don't like it up here.

66
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
So every week, it's worse and worse.

67
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
But it must be all in service of getting it better and better.

68
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You would think.

69
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
But look, Slice House Pizza is going where the Sparkies went.

70
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Oh, by Tony Geminini?

71
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Is that his name, Geminini?

72
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
No, I'm not saying that right.

73
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I call him Tony G from where I'm from.

74
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
And this is something last night when I was discussing with my family,

75
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
and my sister said, oh, yeah, Tony G?

76
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
You mean Tony G from Slice House?

77
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
And I go, yeah, of course, Tony G.

78
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
So you're on a nov of shorthand with Tony G.

79
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Yes.

80
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
But is this also, with apologies, Jason, and happy or beg,

81
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
but is this a Jason-esque Beppo Pepo ploy where you're faking familiarity

82
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
so that you don't have to attempt to pronounce the name?

83
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Oh, I actually don't know the name.

84
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm not pretending to not know.

85
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You'll just admit that you don't know the name.

86
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I don't know the name, yes.

87
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I'm going to take Jason's word for it.

88
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You took the biggest stab of it than any of us have.

89
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm not tracking the Slice House enough to know.

90
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I can just picture the logo and promotional photo in my head,

91
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
like I saw it yesterday.

92
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
But I...

93
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Geminini or Geminani, which I don't think is right.

94
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
So Geminani seems right.

95
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I think Doughboys have covered Slice House.

96
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I believe with maybe Susser or somebody, yeah.

97
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Did they cover it? And apologies, I didn't hear the episode.

98
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Did they cover it because it took over the space

99
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
that was not Shake...

100
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
What the hell is the one?

101
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Steak and Shake.

102
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Steak and Shake.

103
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Yes.

104
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Which also had a buy.

105
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
That is taken by Big Laurie.

106
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Right.

107
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
And now it's Slice House by Jim Mignani.

108
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Right.

109
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Which is going...

110
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Which despite having a location in the Burbank area,

111
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
is now getting a separate city walk.

112
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Exactly, yeah.

113
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Okay.

114
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
And you spoke highly of this place.

115
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
This seems to resemble a restaurant that people like,

116
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
which is a rarity for the city walk area.

117
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Right.

118
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Are you against it then for that reason?

119
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Well, it's a good question.

120
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
If it was up at City Food and they declared

121
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
they would make it 25% worse,

122
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
it would make me more comfortable.

123
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I mean, they're not going to declare it,

124
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
but it will be 25% worse.

125
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Well, let's see.

126
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
But Sparky's is prime real estate.

127
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Terrible spot for wines.

128
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
That's, I feel like, so cramped down there.

129
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Well, that's a good point.

130
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I don't know what the setup will be

131
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
because there's a lot of room in that store.

132
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
So you could potentially have part of a line

133
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
snaking around there unless they...

134
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I think we're in line territory?

135
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I feel like I've never seen a line.

136
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Well, because you can buy slices.

137
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
So if there is a high traffic point or a time of day,

138
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
then perhaps there would be a line for slices.

139
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
But I don't know.

140
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
We'll see.

141
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
We don't know yet.

142
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
But aren't people, you go all the way up there,

143
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
don't you want to get some of the delicious slice pizza

144
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
available in the park?

145
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Yeah.

146
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I can't even, as I say that, I can't even conjure.

147
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I mean, I know it's there.

148
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Yeah.

149
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I know there's some bad Italian place

150
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
kind of in the streets of the world area.

151
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Right.

152
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
There's probably,

153
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
nobody's ever had slices of pizza at Universal Studios.

154
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Do they have a chain in there even?

155
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I don't think so.

156
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Is there like a...

157
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Well, there's a Simpsons pizza.

158
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Isn't there?

159
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I think.

160
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Like in Luigi kind of?

161
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Yeah, I think so.

162
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I've never had it, but there's Simpsons pizza.

163
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Do they have like a little mini pizza hut

164
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
or something in there anywhere?

165
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
What you're thinking of,

166
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
it used to be Pizza Hut down on the lower lot.

167
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Yes, that is what I'm thinking of.

168
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Yeah.

169
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Pizza Hut and Panda Express combo,

170
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
and then I think it's in Jurassic Cafe.

171
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
And that's cool too,

172
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
because like Pizza Hut and Panda Express,

173
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
25% worse at City Walk,

174
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
then you move it all the way down to lower lot

175
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
where it gathers another 25, 35.

176
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
How many more percentages do we lose?

177
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
There is a math equation to do how bad a chain will get

178
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
depending on its location at Universal Studios.

179
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I don't know the numbers.

180
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
We'd have to talk to somebody that's a real expert in it.

181
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
And how you calibrate that.

182
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
This seems like touring plans as Len Testa,

183
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
who's like a computer scientist,

184
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
would have an equation to work out exactly.

185
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Okay, so you take say McDonald's.

186
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
You move McDonald's to the lower lot.

187
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It's going to get 17% worse,

188
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
which means that the burger will be 31% colder,

189
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
and the cheese will be the same,

190
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
which will still give a good taste,

191
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
but the goo will be 12% less salty,

192
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
which makes its taste.

193
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Like, he'll know all of that.

194
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
He could probably figure it out.

195
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Len Testa at a X-ray machine,

196
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
just staring at the rumble of a tummy.

197
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Just watching somebody who has eaten

198
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
theme park Panda Express,

199
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
how it passes through them, how it liquefies,

200
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
how it turns into just like black bile in their stomach,

201
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
and then writing down, very good, okay, I see.

202
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Like, Jason and I in the Star Wars

203
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Bacta Tank looking thing where we're in liquid,

204
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
and Len is just looking at our bodies

205
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
as we digest the McDonald's food

206
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
at the Universal Studios or the Pizza Hut,

207
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
and then he's looking at the levels

208
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
and how much we're enjoying it.

209
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
And then he takes all the equipment off,

210
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
like, all right, you're free to go.

211
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
You guys look at each other.

212
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Well, want to go back to pizza?

213
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Yeah, sounds good.

214
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Sounds good.

215
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
See, with fast food in a theme park, though,

216
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I thought you were going to go with the more upsetting

217
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
visual image of the precogs

218
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
and the goo in Minority Report.

219
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Oh, that works, too.

220
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Because some of that food has definitely

221
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
caused me to fucking freak out.

222
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Well, that's me.

223
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I'm a precog.

224
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Right.

225
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I shake around.

226
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
You're the one that they get out.

227
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I get a vision.

228
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Jason and Mike will have upset tummies,

229
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
and then I pass back out again,

230
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
and you guys again look at each other and say,

231
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
well, pizza?

232
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Yeah, that reminds me, pizza.

233
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Step over your body to get a chalupa.

234
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Do you sometimes, when you're navigating different apps

235
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
and checking and stuff, do you imagine that you're doing it

236
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
like Tom Cruise in Minority Report?

237
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Oh, with the ball?

238
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
In the air, yeah.

239
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
The carving ball?

240
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I mean, like, up at the future screen

241
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
where you're sliding everything around.

242
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Like, you see through the matrix,

243
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
and you move 20 things around in two seconds.

244
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I think it certainly looks that cool.

245
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I think it definitely makes me look cool.

246
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Like it does Tom Cruise in Minority Report.

247
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
So, Scott, you're Colin Farrell at the wooden ball

248
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
going like, how is my tummy going to hurt today?

249
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
It's like, okay, constipated, but painful.

250
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Probably one of the worst options you can get.

251
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Constipated, but painful.

252
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
That's a horrifying phrase.

253
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
You can't do it.

254
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
You're trying, but you can't do anything.

255
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
You'd think being stuck would stop the pain.

256
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
It would think, yeah.

257
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Well, this is for, yeah, we do have to figure out

258
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
how to address City Walk and stuff,

259
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
which is always more of a priority for us

260
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
than new theme park attractions,

261
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
which miraculously is something

262
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
that we are talking about today.

263
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
And I know you're trying to move on,

264
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
but I will have to say I do have

265
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
an Insomnia Cookies story from college.

266
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Oh, Insomnia Cookies is moving into City Walk 2,

267
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
City Walk Hollywood as well.

268
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Oh, I see.

269
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I sent you a picture.

270
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Sorry to cut you off, Scott, but it was necessary.

271
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I was almost to the end.

272
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I had said T on, and then I was stopped

273
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
to talk about cookies.

274
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I sent Jason a picture.

275
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I ate an Insomnia Cookie in San Diego

276
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
like a month and a half ago or a month ago.

277
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I'm not up on things enough to know

278
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
that Insomnia Cookies is something that's coming.

279
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Yes, that is coming, and it's coming

280
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
in where Mini Monster was.

281
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
And Mini Monster is no more.

282
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Mini Monster is gone.

283
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Mini Monster is gone, yeah.

284
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Geez, boy, it's all changing so quickly.

285
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Do you want to tell your Insomnia Cookies story?

286
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
No, no.

287
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
That's to say.

288
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
That's to say.

289
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
That's the sense of tease.

290
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
All right, get everybody.

291
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Everyone's mouths are watering now

292
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
thinking about your cookie story, right?

293
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
My rival, like, every time I look at it.

294
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Oh, it's a negative story.

295
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
It's bad.

296
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Well, it's bad because I did it to my side.

297
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
It seems like a fine establishment.

298
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Oh.

299
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
This is, again, we're right back in City Walk

300
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Saga territory where you're blaming yourselves

301
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
instead of the establishment.

302
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
It is time for you to stop blaming the mirror

303
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
and look at the world and see what the world

304
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
is doing to your body.

305
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
It's the Radiohead song Just, right?

306
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Do it to yourself, you do.

307
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
That's what you do to no one else.

308
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I did it to myself, I did.

309
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
That's Jason's anthem for.

310
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
And not, not, to some in chocolate and pouring.

311
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I'll be back real soon.

312
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
All right, let me finish the title.

313
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Right.

314
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Uz by U Adventure.

315
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
That is the attraction that we are talking about.

316
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
In my head, a new attraction as I stare at my notes

317
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
that tell me that it has been running since June

318
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
in the Magic Kingdom.

319
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Yeah, it is an old attraction at this point.

320
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
It is.

321
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Only November 2024 in Disneyland.

322
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
As has been discussed, a cursed time

323
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
and a difficult time to get there.

324
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
We still all haven't been, but close enough,

325
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
close enough to actually talk about a fairly

326
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
recent ride.

327
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Yes.

328
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
And maybe not a full, you know, it's, look,

329
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
it's not a fully new attraction, as you know.

330
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
It is a bit of a reskin, a bit of a re-theme.

331
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
But, you know, a lot going on there.

332
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
And, yeah, here we are.

333
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Specifically, you've been, Mike.

334
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I have, yes.

335
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I've been.

336
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Jason, you've not.

337
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I have not been.

338
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Sure.

339
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Well, I hope you don't mind us,

340
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I hope you don't mind listening

341
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
or chip in based on if you watch

342
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
ride throughs, do you know?

343
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Oh, I've watched a lot of ride throughs.

344
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Do you know the names of some of the furry friends?

345
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I did at one, I don't know, I always forget them.

346
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
But I like the furry friends.

347
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I do too, but what would be the way that you would

348
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
even retain the names of the furry friends

349
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
besides looking them up?

350
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
You'd have to look them up?

351
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Yeah, because is there ever, like,

352
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
is there spot these friends in the queue?

353
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Is there any, because, like, the names aren't really.

354
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Oh, I see what you're saying.

355
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
They don't have name placards once you're in the thing.

356
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
No, no, and there's, yeah, because there's, like,

357
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
original ride characters, but they don't seem to,

358
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
yeah, explain their names very well.

359
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Maybe, I don't know, maybe there's, I have actually,

360
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
now that I think about it, I don't know if there's

361
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
gift shops that have the characters,

362
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
maybe there's some of that going on.

363
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
There is a little, like, they did raise berets,

364
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
and there is a little theme in there, but yes,

365
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I don't know that the characters are so publicized,

366
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
what it would explain.

367
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
They're kind of, it's like it was leaked in a post,

368
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
not leaked, but, like, given to us, the nerds,

369
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
to, like, here, and just so you know,

370
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
this is the name of the possum.

371
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Yes, Bo.

372
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Yeah.

373
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Bo.

374
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Bo the opossum.

375
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
You know, see, this is good.

376
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I'm gonna have to stare at notes.

377
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Bo is kind of a sleeper.

378
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
He doesn't move a lot, and he's in a couple,

379
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I think he's in a couple spots.

380
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Well, a lot of these characters have moments

381
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
of not moving a lot.

382
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Well, yes, if you're talking about limited motion, yes,

383
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
and also if they're broken half a day, yes.

384
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Yes, yeah, yeah, which does seem to be the situation.

385
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Which is often happening, yes.

386
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I think we, I'm not sure in what order to attack this exactly.

387
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
We could talk about a little bit of the history.

388
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I will really quickly say that after some of the travails,

389
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
which I've told the audience about,

390
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I was finally able to make it down there

391
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
and go on this ride, which was a nice thing.

392
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Magic Key finally got it up and running.

393
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I didn't realize until I was about to do it

394
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
that my trip to do this ride was my first time

395
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
in Disneyland Park in two years.

396
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Wow, is it that long?

397
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I don't know.

398
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Yes, I had done one California adventure

399
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
because that has become Aaron and I's priority,

400
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
even though we did that with our oldest.

401
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
So, you know, we'd been there, and I've done, oh, my God,

402
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:32,000
a couple of paradise just me and my son Trader Sam's

403
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
drinking a ZIPA.

404
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Just me and my boy at 12 o'clock.

405
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Oh, those goods are so much easier to drink.

406
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
You must be loving those.

407
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Yeah, well, it's like medicine has to be fruit flavored

408
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
for him to understand.

409
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
You get maybe a little bit of a citrus,

410
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
so it helps it go down.

411
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Yeah, a little fruit in there.

412
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Yeah, and you throw it in a sippy cup,

413
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
and he's none the wiser.

414
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Just falls asleep in the car, that's all.

415
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Anyway, all this to say, here's a recommendation.

416
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Go to Disneyland Park.

417
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
It was nice.

418
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I forgot.

419
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I forgot that I like Disneyland.

420
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
It was a nice thing to do.

421
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I will say that I went solo because I have a new baby at home,

422
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
and I was a lot of guilt on my part

423
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
because there's been a lot going on,

424
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
and Aaron was like man in the hatches, both kids.

425
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I felt kind of ridiculous saying I'm going to Disneyland for work,

426
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
but this was also part of your genius plan

427
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
in starting this podcast, thinking many steps ahead

428
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
and that we would have to go to theme parks for work,

429
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
so I thank you for that plan.

430
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Now it really paid off.

431
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
That said, two kids, very difficult.

432
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I felt really bad about it.

433
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I still made it back for bedtime

434
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
because that's a process with two.

435
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
That's what I've learned,

436
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
and I don't want to tuck them in and everything,

437
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
but mainly though it was very nice to do,

438
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
and I was like I'm here.

439
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I'm going to do all the stuff,

440
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
but the calculation I did was I haven't been to Disneyland

441
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
as opposed to DCA in a while.

442
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I'm going to do Disneyland specifically

443
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
and focus on that partially because I haven't in a while

444
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
and partially because if I go down here

445
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
and mostly hang out in DCA,

446
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I will feel like I am cheating on Aaron.

447
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I think it will feel like I am out with another woman.

448
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Yeah, because that's a lot of the fondness.

449
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
You put fondnesses on these places

450
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
based on memories and who you did it with,

451
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
and California Adventure is absolutely 20s, 30s,

452
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
dating, falling deeper in love.

453
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I was just like I can't cut loose and just be here

454
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
while she's sweating it out with the kids,

455
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
so I did make that choice.

456
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I will spend the vast majority of the day.

457
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Sitting and drinking a Carthay Manhattan solo,

458
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
worse than making out with another lady, I think.

459
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
So I didn't do that.

460
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Aaron, I have something to tell you.

461
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Yeah.

462
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Really bad.

463
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Oh my God, what is it?

464
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I don't want to have mince words.

465
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
It's really bad.

466
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I had an $18 cocktail.

467
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,000
In the longitude and latitude of the place we go.

468
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I didn't talk to anybody.

469
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I just ordered it.

470
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I didn't talk to the bartender.

471
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I found it miserable.

472
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I tried to spit up in my mouth so that it was mixed

473
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
with saliva and I didn't enjoy the taste

474
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
while it was going down.

475
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Because I love you.

476
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I do even though I've done what I've done.

477
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
You do have to, I don't know,

478
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
there's I'm sure like the 100 hacky stand up bits

479
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
about this.

480
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Sometimes if you do do a solo trip

481
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
because you have to go for work,

482
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I do kind of downplay how much.

483
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I was fine, you know.

484
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I just kind of was in and out.

485
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
That's a smart.

486
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
You know?

487
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Yeah.

488
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I'm just, I'm not lying, but I'm not being like,

489
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
it was great.

490
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I was alone.

491
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I was drinking a beer now.

492
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Watching the Mark Twain go around,

493
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
like you dump.

494
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
The way all moments have some Simpsons analog,

495
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
it's Lisa Comes Back for Mitchie.

496
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Yes, there you go.

497
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
That's it.

498
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Which Bart can't see.

499
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
How was it?

500
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
It was all right.

501
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Beyond this.

502
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
It was the greatest movie I've ever seen.

503
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
And that's definitely true.

504
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Well, I know you want to try all those sauces

505
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
at the country bear barbecue.

506
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Yes.

507
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Well, actually that would have been,

508
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
that's something where I could have pointed to

509
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
and said, Aaron, it was not so great.

510
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I had to sit and track a bunch of sauces.

511
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Oh, yeah.

512
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
That would have actually,

513
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
that would have felt the best.

514
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
But you're right.

515
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
That is probably a way to play it.

516
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
And Aaron, if you're listening,

517
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
there is something that I played down.

518
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I don't think I really talked about this

519
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
when I came home,

520
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
because it's a long day.

521
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
You don't want to rub it in.

522
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
But here, I will say this.

523
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Round three, I do migrate over to California Adventure.

524
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I, just backstory, I've been in a state

525
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
called eye-bleedingly busy

526
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
since the birth of my son in September.

527
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
It's been, I've been at a pitch.

528
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
It's been fucking nuts.

529
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
So to, in that state,

530
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
sit and have an IPA

531
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
and a Ghirardelli Sunday

532
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
in the Sonoma, which I went and got,

533
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
and then brought over to the Sonoma Terrace area

534
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
so that I could listen to a wonderful soundtrack

535
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
of what I refer to as crap jazz,

536
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
early 2000s acoustic guitar jazz

537
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
that even I can't defend,

538
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
but that I love with every fiber of my being,

539
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
because it relaxes me so much.

540
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
This, the beer plus the Sunday,

541
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
after the way it's been lately,

542
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
this was a borderline psychedelic experience.

543
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I was texting people that I honestly feel

544
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
like I'm tripping right now.

545
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I feel like I am floating off the ground.

546
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Wow.

547
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
It was so crazy and great.

548
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I'm sorry, Aaron, we'll get to,

549
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
we will do it as soon as we can.

550
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I wish I didn't know what you were talking about,

551
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
but I do know what you're talking about.

552
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
You've been there?

553
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Yeah, yeah.

554
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Well, I was texting you guys.

555
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Did you have an equivalent?

556
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Yeah, yeah.

557
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I was texting you guys

558
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
because I didn't realize you could just have a beer

559
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
at one of the, not the quick service restaurants,

560
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
but one of the sit-down restaurants

561
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
around the Rivers of America and Disneyland.

562
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Not the new, not Tiana's Palace.

563
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Is it a palace or a place?

564
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I forget every time what restaurant I was eating at.

565
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I don't know if it is.

566
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I feel like it might be Palace.

567
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I don't know.

568
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
We should know that too.

569
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
So I was just sitting there.

570
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I think it's Palace.

571
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Oh, it is Palace.

572
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I mean, that makes sense.

573
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Confusing because place sounds more like a restaurant,

574
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
but it's Palace.

575
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
They do refer to it as Princess Tiana.

576
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Google, why is it Tiana's Palace and not Tiana's Place?

577
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
It's because it's, wait, what?

578
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
In the restaurant it is?

579
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Well, no, wait, okay.

580
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
You got to do that minus AI search.

581
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
No, I don't know if this is AI.

582
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Look, point is it's Palace.

583
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I'm sorry.

584
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
You were saying, though, it's not there.

585
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
It's another one of those New Orleans Square restaurants

586
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
where you didn't know until you got there

587
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
that alcohol is available.

588
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Yeah, I forgot because you can get one now on Main Street

589
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
and it's all the places that you can't just pick one up and go.

590
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
It's the Main Street spot?

591
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
It's Carnation, right?

592
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
And Carnation's not the, that's...

593
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Carnation, like halfway down Main Street.

594
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Left or right if you're looking at the castle.

595
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
On the left side if you're looking at the castle.

596
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Yeah, Carnation Cafe.

597
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Which one is the chicken?

598
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Oh, is that to the, that's the one to the right.

599
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
It's an inn.

600
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
It's not Jolly Holiday, it's the Plaza Inn, yes.

601
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
There you go, okay.

602
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
That's the Plaza Inn.

603
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
And then, yeah, so I just didn't realize that.

604
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
So I had been texting you guys, I remember.

605
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I'm like, I had this big, giant vegetable salad

606
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
and some drink and I'm sitting alone and just the calm.

607
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Yeah.

608
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I experienced that, I experienced that

609
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
because, you know, having a, we're not,

610
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I'm not nearly as busy as you are,

611
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
but just, you know, having a child day to day

612
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
and trying to do other stuff.

613
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
The bass is still very, yes, of course.

614
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
There's a lot of stuff going on.

615
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
So when you have sort of these times to yourself,

616
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
sometimes it can feel like otherworldly.

617
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Like, I've seen LCD sound system before,

618
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
but I saw them whenever in October

619
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
and I just had like a drink.

620
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I was alone in the back of the floor

621
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
and I felt like I was floating.

622
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Like the beat, the groove was just like taking me over

623
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
and I'm sure it was embarrassing to watch if you saw like,

624
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
oh, that dad is really feeling himself.

625
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
But I know what you're talking about.

626
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
What's to say people weren't saying

627
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
that very youthful man over there

628
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
is feeling himself to an appropriate youthful degree.

629
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Thank you for saying it

630
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
because that's what I wanted to say,

631
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
but I was trying to be humble about it.

632
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
But yeah, some people are like, what's that young man,

633
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
what's that young man doing at this show?

634
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
This is sort of a band from 20 years ago.

635
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Is he even allowed to drink in here?

636
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Yeah, let me card him.

637
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Police, police, right this way.

638
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
You do a lot of like hushed, like if I,

639
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
you go to a bouncer or something with a dollar,

640
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
you go to a bouncer or something with a dollar,

641
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
with like, with a 20 or more.

642
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
And it's like, you know, there's admission.

643
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
You don't have to bribe me to get it.

644
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
No, no, no, it's not that.

645
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Will you just card me in front of a lot of people?

646
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
You just like.

647
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Card me.

648
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Just say I'm a college junior.

649
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I actually did not have my driver's license on me.

650
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
And I went to a different show.

651
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I was at a different rock and roll show this week.

652
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
And for a second, I was like really thinking to myself,

653
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
oh my God, they're gonna card me when I get a drink.

654
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
And then there was no question on the bartender's face.

655
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
And I'm like, yeah, what are you thinking, man?

656
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Yeah.

657
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
You wish.

658
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Yeah, how's the rock and roll show?

659
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Oh, it was great.

660
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
It was the guy I kept talking about, M.J. Lenderman.

661
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
M.J. Lenderman.

662
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Yeah.

663
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Oh, I listened to it, but you know what?

664
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
On the Patreon, we both put up playlists.

665
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
And I can't make heads or tails of your hillbilly nonsense.

666
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
But your half, if you don't know,

667
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
on the second gate, we made playlists.

668
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
So I put up a yacht rock thing and Mike put up something

669
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
that's half hillbilly nonsense,

670
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
half music by people under 35 to prove that you're with it.

671
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
And that said music, I listened to a number of those.

672
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
There's a lot of good stuff.

673
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Oh, thank you.

674
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Yeah, I have not listened to yours.

675
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Or I listened to something a while ago that you made.

676
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I don't forget if it's the same list.

677
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Look, if you've been confused

678
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
any time I've talked about yacht rock and you're like,

679
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
what, so the Pina Colada song?

680
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
No, no, no.

681
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
No, no, no.

682
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
It's none of that shit.

683
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Oh, the yacht that's out there.

684
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Oh, it's a heavenly world.

685
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Hey.

686
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Come with me.

687
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Take a journey with me.

688
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Let me ask, because people are speaking so favorably of it.

689
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Molly Lambert, I think, was talking head on.

690
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Did you like that yacht rock documentary

691
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
that came out a few months ago?

692
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Oh, I did indeed.

693
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Yes, HBO Yacht Rock.

694
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Yes, which Molly Lambert is in.

695
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
The people who do that yacht rock podcast are in,

696
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,000
who coined the term Hollywood Steve and JD Riznar.

697
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,000
And it is an assessment of the yacht rock world

698
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,000
and story that I sign off on, I agree, with great music,

699
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
great artists shout it out.

700
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,000
And the spoiler alert at the end when it's a genius moment

701
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
when they call Donald Fagan from Steely Dan and say,

702
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
do you want to be part of the yacht rock documentary?

703
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
And he says, go fuck yourself.

704
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Right.

705
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Or he leads them on.

706
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
And what style of music is that?

707
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
What are we talking about?

708
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Oh, yacht rock.

709
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Go fuck yourself.

710
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Hang up.

711
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
That's why I love them.

712
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
That's why I love them, baby.

713
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
That's great.

714
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Anyways, let's veer out of that.

715
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,000
So I just had to share that lame dad tripping situation.

716
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Oh, yeah.

717
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
But it was nice.

718
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Great excuse to go.

719
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Thank you, audience, for providing an excuse for us

720
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
to go to these places.

721
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
In terms of what we're dealing with here, fun fact,

722
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,000
did you know this was not always Tiana's Bayou Adventure?

723
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
This was once an attraction called Splash Mountain,

724
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
an attraction that opened in 1989.

725
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
I was aware of it, but I'm not sure.

726
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
You might be interested in Twitter trending topic

727
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
I got last night.

728
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
That said Splash Mountain told me as much.

729
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
So did you.

730
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Why was that?

731
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
I mean, some of it, once I saw it,

732
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
was just rides where if you could wave a magic wand,

733
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
you'd bring it back.

734
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
So I'd see Horizons is one and Splash Mountain is one.

735
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Yes.

736
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
I would bring back Horizons over Splash Mountain.

737
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
No offense to the Splash people, I guess.

738
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Yes, because you essentially have Splash Mountain.

739
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Anyway, go ahead.

740
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
I always bring back one that literally no fighter of it exists.

741
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
There's nothing there of it.

742
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
And I would bring back Create Movie Ride over Horizons,

743
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
going to the other one.

744
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Really?

745
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
I think so.

746
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Oh, that's a great answer.

747
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
I think I would go Horizons.

748
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Someone had like four different things located.

749
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
But people were unironically doing like,

750
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
let's petition, let's get it back.

751
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
These are great questions.

752
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:07,000
And that is a little incoherent.

753
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
I don't know if that's going to happen.

754
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,000
I know what's crazy is I still think, my heart tells me,

755
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
unless, well, no.

756
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
I mean, I'd love to get E.T. Adventure back in Hollywood.

757
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
But it's weirder to say that because you can go to Florida

758
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
and experience it.

759
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
My knee-jerk is still Maelstrom, even though I don't have

760
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
any hate in my heart for Frozen.

761
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
I still just, I want to see that mural.

762
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
I want to see those unpleasant...

763
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
I want to see everybody who yells at you

764
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,000
and tells you not to go to Norway after you've been told

765
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
that Norway is pleasant and wonderful.

766
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
No, stop!

767
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Get out of Norway!

768
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
It's definitely Maelstrom.

769
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,000
The oil rigs in the North Sea.

770
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
The proud people of Norway.

771
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Back!

772
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Oh, and the movie.

773
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Look, I'm somebody who rushed through the movie before.

774
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
I'd sit in the theater and watch that movie five times,

775
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
if I could.

776
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
The boring movie with the boring chopping of wood.

777
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
It was on my list for like,

778
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
hey, let's do this at the beginning of the year.

779
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
And then it quickly became like,

780
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
hey, need to wait on this one.

781
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Figured out.

782
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Maelstrom's a priority.

783
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
I'm physically touching my heart when I talk about it.

784
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
It's in all our hearts, just like the spirit

785
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
of the people of Norway.

786
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Full of adventure.

787
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Danger, sure, but also pleasant for tourism, you see.

788
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
I love it.

789
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Fuck.

790
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
But Splash Man.

791
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Splash Man, Disney's first log flume attraction,

792
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
a Tony Baxter creation,

793
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,000
imbued with Tony Baxter creativity and magic,

794
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
opened in Disneyland Park in 1989,

795
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
opened in Disney World and Tokyo Disney

796
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
not too long after that.

797
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Initially, the beneficiary of the biggest promotional blitz

798
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
in Disneyland history.

799
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
We have gone through many different specials

800
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
with musical numbers and skits

801
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
and things that acknowledge it and earnest

802
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
and like different styles of McDonald's tie-ins.

803
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
I mean, this might have been the most famous ride on Earth

804
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
when it opened.

805
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Yeah, you couldn't avoid it.

806
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Yeah.

807
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,000
It, I would say, proved the marketing might

808
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
of the Eisner machine at its peak,

809
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:21,000
but also the poor impulses of that same machine

810
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,000
to open a ride based on Song of the South in the 80s.

811
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Uh-huh.

812
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,000
You know, 40 years after the film was released

813
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
and was controversial then.

814
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Yeah, so it wasn't a retroactive...

815
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Strange.

816
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Oh, you know that scene

817
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
in that movie now that we're looking back upon it.

818
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
We have reevaluated Song of the South.

819
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
No, it was evaluated.

820
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
It had been evaluated.

821
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:50,000
A movie that was protested by the NAACP in 1946.

822
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
And yet, as we've been through,

823
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
the strangest fact ever to me,

824
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
that they did a re-release in the 80s still,

825
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
there's like a trial balloon for this.

826
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Yeah, yeah.

827
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Do we get away with this?

828
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Now, I remain no expert in this

829
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
and with no desire to keep talking about it, frankly.

830
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
No.

831
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Just interesting context for sure.

832
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
I have never seen this film,

833
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
and I could be wrong and, you know,

834
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
be gentle with me for suggesting this,

835
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
but my theory has always been that it's less than anything

836
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
in the ride was problematic

837
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
and more that it causes anyone to have to go,

838
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
what's this based on now?

839
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Well, that's what I said.

840
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
And that's an uncomfortable question

841
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,000
that has been only mounting and mounting for Disney since 1989.

842
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
There's a couple of things on Splash Mountain

843
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
where, like, they've changed,

844
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
I guess whitewash is the word,

845
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
like, changed things around where, like,

846
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
that's a scene that would be problematic in the movie,

847
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
but they've changed things about it,

848
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
or they changed Uncle Remus' character

849
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
to the Brayer Frog character,

850
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
which was created for the ride.

851
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
So there's, like, stuff in there where you're like,

852
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
just, like, they've changed it to hide.

853
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
And you're not saying change while the ride was open.

854
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
But in making it a ride,

855
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
they've lost this element, that element.

856
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
So this is, you know, and, you know,

857
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
God knows, I don't want to say this

858
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
and then find that people were, like,

859
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
were offended by aspects of Splash Mountain.

860
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
I think it's just, it's the association more than anything.

861
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Well, right, this is my big argument.

862
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
You go home and you're like, hey, that's cool, what movie is that?

863
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
And you Google it and you're like, song of the,

864
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
like, oh, that's, I don't know, that sucks.

865
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
To me, it feels like it sucks.

866
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Well, and you know there's a problem because, like,

867
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
at some point, the literature became,

868
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
like, join us on a great log flume adventure,

869
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
as opposed to when it opened, like,

870
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
based on Disney's beloved classic,

871
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Song of the South.

872
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Like, that's completely how it was positioned then.

873
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
And you know something's up if they have to start going,

874
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
hey, hey, ask that part of the copy.

875
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Yeah.

876
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
And, like, I look, I know we've watched,

877
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
I've watched plenty of Tony Baxter interviews

878
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
where, like, it seemed like they put an effort forth

879
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
to not make it a fence,

880
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
like, to try to take the bad stuff out of it.

881
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Yeah, yeah.

882
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
But at the end of the day, it's a 20,

883
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
whatever, it's 2020,

884
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
at the end of the day, you're like, do we really need

885
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
a Song of the South ride in our park?

886
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
And I would say, like, ah, we should get around

887
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
to changing that.

888
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Also, the more that theme parks become representations

889
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
of the biggest IPs on Earth.

890
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Of course, theme parks have Star Wars

891
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
and Harry Potter and Indiana Jones

892
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
and Song of the South, of course.

893
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Must get some real estate.

894
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
It's very strange.

895
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Yes, and I'm sure I'm repeating myself,

896
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
like, yeah, okay, like, there's plenty of stuff

897
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
in the movies where, like, oh, this scene now

898
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
in hindsight is bad, or, and then, you know,

899
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
the Peter Pan depiction of Native Americans,

900
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
yeah, like, just change it on the ride.

901
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Now, Disney is now changing the warning

902
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
in front of these movies,

903
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
which is a whole other weird thing

904
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
that's going on in the recent,

905
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
related to the recent administration.

906
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
We are sorry, but one of the characters

907
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
in this film

908
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
once thought about smoking a cigarette.

909
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
We want to get ahead of it,

910
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
and please go to Disney.com slash let's talk about it

911
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
to assuage everyone's fears.

912
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Right.

913
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Well, now, Trump mandated

914
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
that Disney just writes, we stand by

915
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
everything we've ever done, and it's perfect

916
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
before you watch something in Disney Plus.

917
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
He's going to make Iger go in front of it,

918
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
say, I'm Robert Iger, and I approve

919
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
everything in this, which he'll

920
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
happily do, by the way.

921
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Seemingly, yeah. These CEOs are just

922
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
licking their lips.

923
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
We either, whatever, we condemn

924
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
this man. How much money do you want?

925
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
We hope that he is locked up as soon as we won.

926
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Well, we love you. How much money, Mr.

927
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Trump, do you want? We're staying out of politics.

928
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
We're staying out of politics.

929
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
We were

930
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
thinking about going

931
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
woke, and then we thought, no, we're going to

932
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
go broke.

933
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
There was an Axios article

934
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
about all this stuff.

935
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
You know, and they mention

936
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
they took away

937
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
those, you know,

938
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
helpful warnings of

939
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
those contextual

940
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
warnings that lasted

941
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
maybe 20 seconds in front

942
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
of a movie, and it's like,

943
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
you are disparaging the We Are

944
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Siamese song. Take that

945
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
out.

946
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Oh, my God, right.

947
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Yikes. That was what I

948
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
got to post these.

949
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
If you look on YouTube,

950
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
that is on

951
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
some of the Rockin' Disney

952
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
compilations from the 2000s.

953
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Oh, yeah, well, and everything, all of

954
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
this, of course, Zippity Doodahs in the

955
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
sing-a-long song. These are the

956
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
most. It's all out there.

957
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
But did you hear Hilary Duff

958
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
sing We Are Siamese, if

959
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
you please? Was it?

960
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
I think it was her. Did she have a sister?

961
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
No. Hayley Duff, of course.

962
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Is there a Duff version?

963
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
I think that's

964
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
her sister is Hayley. I know that. I know Hayley

965
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Duff. I look, sue me. But there's

966
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
another one.

967
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
What's the problem?

968
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
I was concerned about the age.

969
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
We acknowledge the American classic

970
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Material Girls. There were a few cover versions

971
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
of it. It's very weird. There's

972
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
an Axios article where they explain

973
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
they were taking out those contextualized

974
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
things. Jesus, you're right,

975
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Jason. What the fuck? Yeah, it's

976
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
the Duffs, and then there's like another

977
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Disney-made rock band. Oh, my God.

978
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Why would they do that?

979
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
What year are we talking?

980
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Why would that happen? Also, what shade

981
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
to credit it to Hillary Duff

982
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
featuring Hayley Duff?

983
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
What a spin. That's rough.

984
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Look, who do I

985
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
acknowledge more in terms of cultural

986
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
impact? Why, of course, Hillary.

987
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
I'm with Hillary.

988
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Let's not.

989
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
They're both on the song. I'm with Hayley.

990
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
And Mike is with Hayley.

991
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Oh,

992
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
God. Yeah, so

993
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
there's another

994
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
band that does it, like fakey Disney

995
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
band, I think. Anyway, what I was

996
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
getting at, there's this Axios article

997
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
and the part I screengrab,

998
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Disney is changing its diversity,

999
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
equity, and inclusion programs

1000
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
to focus more closely on

1001
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
business outcomes.

1002
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Notes sent to employees to stay

1003
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
and obtained by Axios.

1004
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
What outcome do they want?

1005
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Up, better business, or lower business?

1006
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
I wonder what outcome they want. I don't know.

1007
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
I'm confused, too. Yeah, I screengrab

1008
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
it because I thought it would be a dunk on a weird

1009
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
company and then I'm like, wait, this is

1010
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Jipper. What are they saying?

1011
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
What are they talking about? Like

1012
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
all of this stuff, it's nonsense.

1013
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Yeah, I don't know. This current

1014
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
this is all we can do with

1015
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
everything all of us are dealing with. It's just like

1016
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
it's everything we can do to

1017
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
and Trump, let's move that

1018
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
to the back of our brains as best as

1019
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
we can just to not

1020
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
fall apart during the day. But I

1021
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
believe in the span of just a few weeks,

1022
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Disney

1023
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
is doing

1024
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
all that. They sent out that weird

1025
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
survey to vacation club members

1026
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
going like, hey, any of you fuckers

1027
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
dying soon and you're getting an inheritance?

1028
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Oh, yeah, because that's how people have to pay.

1029
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Yeah, because that's how people have to afford

1030
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
their vacations as they

1031
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
get an inheritance.

1032
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Disney vacations now must be inherited.

1033
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Seemingly.

1034
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Must be passed down. Well, the vacation club

1035
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
is because it's a timeshare. The idea

1036
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
is you pass it down.

1037
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
You keep it going.

1038
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
But then also, so all

1039
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
of this weird stuff and then

1040
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
they're like the Captain America

1041
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
movie. Everyone says it's a mess.

1042
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
And then like

1043
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
also, we're putting in the

1044
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
final verse for

1045
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Small World. Oh, yeah.

1046
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Richard Sherman's verse

1047
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
about understanding each other and

1048
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
living together. So

1049
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Oh, yes. No, several

1050
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
different philosophies going on

1051
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
at the company right there.

1052
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
I'm sure the verse is very

1053
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
nice. I'm sure whoever

1054
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
wanted to put the verse in

1055
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
is nice and doing it for nice reasons.

1056
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
You just wish that the rest of the company

1057
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
would match the

1058
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
feelings.

1059
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Well, we'll have to go check out that verse.

1060
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
The episode of the verse

1061
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
coming soon. We will do the verse, yeah.

1062
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
The verse, the Walt

1063
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Robot. The verse and the Walt Robot are the big

1064
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
50s. Well, dude, of course, Walt

1065
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Robot. Walt Robot is going to be

1066
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
three hours. That's a big deal

1067
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
for it. Yeah.

1068
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Anyways, what ends

1069
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
up with all of this backstory

1070
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
and contentiousness, if you don't recall

1071
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
the history, how it ends up playing

1072
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
out is that there's a long ambience

1073
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
I'm sure we talked about in the show, just like

1074
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
when is this going to get addressed? Then

1075
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
a lot is going on in June

1076
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
2020. It is post George

1077
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Floyd protests are raging.

1078
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
If you can imagine a time when companies

1079
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
were doubling down on

1080
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
diversity and inclusion.

1081
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Was this 90

1082
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
years ago? What was this?

1083
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
But in this climate,

1084
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
it was very obvious that something had to happen.

1085
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
There were internet discussions

1086
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
of, well, you know what you

1087
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
could do, maybe based on

1088
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
or there were rumors of, you know, I hear internally

1089
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
they're thinking about doing this.

1090
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
There were like

1091
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
pitches of here's how it

1092
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
could go and this would be a good property for it

1093
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
potentially. And then all of a sudden one day

1094
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Disney is like, yes, we

1095
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
were actually going to do that. That's actually why we

1096
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
were thinking exactly what we were thinking and now we are.

1097
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
We're waiting for a chance to tell

1098
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
you, but it's totally

1099
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
and we date stamped it all.

1100
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
We wrote

1101
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
down Princess and the Frog Ride, mailed it

1102
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
to ourselves and that was in

1103
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
2018 actually. So

1104
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
we're way ahead of you. We're just going

1105
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
to tell you all right now when

1106
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
regardless of political strut, you

1107
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
are all feeling the most insane.

1108
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Yes,

1109
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
we're waiting for

1110
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
the craziest

1111
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
time possibly in human history.

1112
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
And we'll drop it then.

1113
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
So

1114
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
yeah,

1115
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
a weird surprise,

1116
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
but a good surprise. I think we all felt like,

1117
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
okay, pretty good. And then as the like,

1118
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
but what this has also done is created

1119
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
this long because what that is

1120
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
is five years ago, Jesus Christ.

1121
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
So nearly

1122
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
so, you know, for them

1123
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
to announce something that early

1124
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
and we know the speed at which they build things.

1125
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
It is not the speed at which Universal builds things.

1126
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
So it's been on them to like,

1127
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
let's release droplets

1128
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
of information every nine months

1129
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
because it's they create

1130
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
an awkward situation for themselves like we're

1131
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
doing it. Oh, they are. And then for

1132
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
years you're going to Disneyland and still

1133
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
you're like, so

1134
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
and the company's having financial problems

1135
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
during this time.

1136
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Oh, that's true. So like, there's a lot of speculation.

1137
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Well, I mean, the sense that like,

1138
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
they're not like flushed with quote unquote

1139
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
cash like Tom Cast is.

1140
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
We run theme parks and theme parks

1141
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
are closed for a year.

1142
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Okay, I understand that.

1143
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Let's not also forget the the

1144
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
shortage of building material.

1145
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Every time someone go like,

1146
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
well, it's taking a lot of awfully

1147
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
long time to open this new ride or this

1148
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
new Moana walk through and stuff.

1149
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
People go like, there's a rebar

1150
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
shortage. Don't you know that?

1151
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
And it's like, I do not know that. I am

1152
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
sorry.

1153
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
It's the great American screw

1154
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
loss. Listen,

1155
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
capital is telling us they don't

1156
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
have enough money and we need to be respectful

1157
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
of that. We take them

1158
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
at their word. I take capital at their word

1159
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
every day and I thank them for it.

1160
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Another funny thing that happened

1161
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
in all this was like

1162
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
they're like, you know, announcing

1163
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
like the minds who will bring us

1164
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
this and that the original cast of Princess

1165
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
the Frog will be back because that's somehow the first

1166
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
I've said Princess and the Frog in this story.

1167
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
This is based on

1168
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
the Princess and the Frog was

1169
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
am I correct? The like revival of

1170
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
hand drawn animation after

1171
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
a long after it was kind of like, hey, we're back

1172
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
a little bit. Yeah, yeah.

1173
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
And very charming for those reasons.

1174
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
So, you know, it's all right.

1175
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Original voice cast is back and then and of course

1176
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Tony Baxter will be advising

1177
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
and making sure that we do

1178
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
that. And then that one went away.

1179
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
That one's there.

1180
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
That one's there. He's still

1181
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
in her contracts. You got to get a little bit of like

1182
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
he's involved. Don't worry. He's going to walk

1183
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
down the hall. Don't look at some

1184
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
interviews that have had 500 views

1185
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
where he's like seemingly

1186
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
salty about it.

1187
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Well, let's

1188
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
also say like

1189
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
if people have memory hold this,

1190
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
at least it is a land

1191
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
for a lot of years Splash

1192
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
was kind of in rough shape.

1193
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Stuff not working.

1194
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Maybe I perhaps

1195
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
have myself memory hold it. What do you

1196
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
again? I also don't know the ride as well

1197
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
because I was not going on the ride for some

1198
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
time until Mr. Baxter himself

1199
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
helped me figure out how to go on it.

1200
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
So what were issues

1201
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
with the ride? It was just I feel

1202
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
like it was down a lot. Stuff

1203
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
animatronics were not working.

1204
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Show elements were not working. Stuff would be

1205
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
dark and you're like is that supposed to be

1206
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
darker? Can I just not see it?

1207
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
It would give it a weird. It was

1208
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
always a trippy ride.

1209
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
But then some stuff would be broken and I'm like is that

1210
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
on purpose to make me

1211
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
messed? I don't know.

1212
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
It's an incredibly hard ride

1213
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
to maintain.

1214
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
I'll say it seems like of all

1215
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
these rides to ever have to re-theme

1216
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
might be the hardest. Maybe the biggest

1217
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
most daunting task in the world

1218
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
because of just like I felt like

1219
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
it was harder to fix it with Splash

1220
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Mountain and it's so long

1221
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
as well. Well I think

1222
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
the thing. Yeah it's very long.

1223
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
I was trying to figure out like oh pirates

1224
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
I feel like they

1225
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
don't have as much trouble and I'm like oh

1226
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
pirates isn't fighting the

1227
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
elements.

1228
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
The animatronics have a lot of

1229
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
space. There's not the intimacy

1230
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
you wouldn't say.

1231
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
There are sort of here's show scenes

1232
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
and sure it's all next to water but it's

1233
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
all in kind of a big like sound

1234
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
stage isn't the word but it's more of like

1235
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
here's the facility.

1236
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Which I guess is I mean you go into

1237
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
a show building at some point during

1238
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Splash Mountain but the part I was

1239
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
really thinking about in comparing the two

1240
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
is that like just when you're kind

1241
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
of in the deepest part when you're between

1242
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
like drops two and three

1243
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
it's so claustrophobic

1244
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
like it's like it's really tight

1245
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
spaces and I think like

1246
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
redoing all the you know

1247
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
another thing like there's no real like ceiling per se

1248
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
to something like Pirates as opposed to

1249
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Splash Mountain the ceiling is right there

1250
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
you're seeing everything around you

1251
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
there in one of the great most

1252
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
charming aspects of the whole thing

1253
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
is the you know the tightness

1254
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
and everything being right there but like I imagine

1255
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
it makes it daunting that like you know

1256
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
there's nowhere to hide stuff

1257
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
in the show scenes.

1258
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Yes absolutely like

1259
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
I mean I guess we could there's so much to talk

1260
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
about but like just even talking about the

1261
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
idea of re-themes like to me

1262
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Guardians of the Galaxy is the

1263
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Mission Breakout is the gold standard

1264
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
for a complete

1265
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
re-theme where you take the whole like the property

1266
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
is different.

1267
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
But that's to me easier

1268
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
that seems a lot easier to do

1269
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
versus this

1270
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
which is just less ground to cover

1271
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
and I'm trying to think what are the other examples.

1272
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
They did it so fast which makes you think

1273
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
it must have been easier.

1274
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Well right there's not as much

1275
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
acreage to cover as well

1276
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
and that means money can go farther

1277
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
probably in addition to that.

1278
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
I'm just in a basic

1279
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
dumb person sense like

1280
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
water makes it hard I bet.

1281
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
I bet it does.

1282
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
It's got to be musty in there.

1283
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Robots do not need water as far as I know.

1284
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Robots and water

1285
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
are mixed. That's what I learned when I was a kid.

1286
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
That's bad.

1287
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Unless there's certain

1288
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
robot water

1289
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
water robots excuse me.

1290
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
I mean there are

1291
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
mechanical specialists

1292
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
who are also like scuba certified

1293
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
and obviously pirates

1294
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
there's a lot more waterway

1295
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
and deeper water.

1296
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
But like even in this you either have to drain

1297
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
all the water to work on stuff

1298
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
or someone has to like go down with

1299
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
a tank of oxygen and a blow torch

1300
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
or a soldering iron.

1301
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
And then also

1302
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
did they end up redoing logs

1303
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
or refurbishing them?

1304
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
They refurbished them but they're pretty much the same

1305
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
logs I'm pretty sure.

1306
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Because it's not

1307
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
it's not like they went to the double seating

1308
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
which is in Florida.

1309
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
That would be so expensive I think

1310
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
to widen the track like it is in Florida.

1311
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Oh they're able to do that because it's wider?

1312
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
To do double seating?

1313
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Yes.

1314
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
I mean I think that it wouldn't be able to fit that way.

1315
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Is Florida longer of a ride too?

1316
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
Yes.

1317
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Florida's long because like the word is

1318
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
and again we don't have any good this is one of those rides

1319
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
that's new and we only can hear like rumors

1320
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
so we don't have that like good behind the scenes

1321
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
of what's going on necessarily.

1322
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
The rumor is that they designed it for Disneyland

1323
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
so it fits in a nicer way

1324
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
because we haven't been on the Disney World version.

1325
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
But people say oh the Disney World version

1326
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
feels like emptier it feels

1327
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
I've been catching that.

1328
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
That's what people have been saying and they feel like

1329
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
they designed it for Disneyland and then they just stretched out

1330
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
the show elements on Disney World

1331
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
because it's like a longer track.

1332
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Well they also had further to go right?

1333
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
I got curious about because

1334
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
you know not to jump around too much

1335
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
but I think a big concern was like

1336
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
okay this is a ride that is teeming

1337
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
with animatronics and are they going to be able to recreate

1338
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
that vibe and I tried to not watch

1339
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
a ride through just to experience it

1340
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
and I'm like it's something I was worried about

1341
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
because it's going to be so screen oriented

1342
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
or mist oriented or whatever

1343
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
that it doesn't because you need that feel

1344
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
you know it at least has to feel

1345
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
like a part of a Knott's one.

1346
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
That's a lot of the thrill is like

1347
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
I'm moving so fast and every second there's so many animatronics.

1348
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
They landed at 48.

1349
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
There's 48.

1350
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Disney World

1351
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
and I was like what did it have before?

1352
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Disney World actually you know

1353
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
this is the opposite of what I was saying.

1354
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Disney World had 68 Splash Mountain.

1355
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Disneyland had 103.

1356
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Yeah because those were the America Sings

1357
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
robots specifically.

1358
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
They had all the real original ones.

1359
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Which is funny they had to then in the 90s

1360
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
recreate 70s robots.

1361
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
So actually forget what I was saying

1362
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
it's almost like they had further to go

1363
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
in Disneyland.

1364
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Well as far as yeah just repopulating

1365
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
or making it feel full like it did.

1366
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
But there was less space?

1367
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Yes because I would just double check

1368
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
duration of Splash in Disneyland

1369
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
is 9 minutes 18 seconds

1370
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
and Magic Kingdom is 11 minutes

1371
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
45 seconds.

1372
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
That's significant ride time.

1373
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
We've done full two hour

1374
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
episodes about rides that are like a minute and a half.

1375
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
So a minute and a half in

1376
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
within two versions of a ride is huge.

1377
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Yeah correct me if I'm wrong I think it's a little

1378
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
slower in Disney World too.

1379
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
But I could be wrong. I know it's for sure

1380
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
longer but I can't remember if it actually for some reason

1381
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
runs a little slower.

1382
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
But yeah that's a long

1383
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
that's a long two minutes probably.

1384
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Some rides are two minutes.

1385
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Besides the stuff with the ride

1386
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
itself.

1387
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
There were a lot of steps to this.

1388
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
You understand why it took a long time because

1389
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
there's the interior

1390
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
there is the exterior

1391
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
there is the land itself.

1392
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
The land changed from critter country

1393
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
to bayou country.

1394
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Part of this is that Tiana's palace

1395
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
not place apparently

1396
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
and the internet doesn't know why

1397
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
either. Is that what it is in the movie?

1398
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Is that what it is? I guess.

1399
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
I think it's right at the end when she

1400
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
does she finally open up

1401
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
a spot. Yeah.

1402
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
I like this movie too.

1403
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
I like this movie. I did see some

1404
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
complaints of this.

1405
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
I appreciate it's a new story

1406
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
after the movie.

1407
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
But I saw people saying like

1408
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
a lot of the characters from the movie are not

1409
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
in this or like

1410
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
they're just in it at the end waving

1411
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
you know or smiling

1412
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
and not really moving.

1413
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Is it by the way sorry really quick is it Tiana's

1414
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
it's she does she like has her

1415
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
dream art of Tiana's place in the movie

1416
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
but does it end up being palace because

1417
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
she is a princess?

1418
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
That is probably the logic.

1419
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Maybe that's the logic.

1420
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Who are we?

1421
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Ron Clements, John Musker and

1422
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Randy Newman the

1423
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
creative minds behind this movie.

1424
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Who are we?

1425
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
We are not them no.

1426
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
We are sweat boxing.

1427
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
We are sweat boxing this 2009

1428
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
film.

1429
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
Two of the great yeah it's a Musker

1430
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Clements and it shows they're two of the greatest

1431
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
who ever did it and you get look

1432
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
you can't complain about more Randy Newman

1433
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
in the parks. This is a good thing. Sure.

1434
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
We love Randy Newman. Randy Newman if you when you add it up

1435
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
especially with this and between

1436
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
like so much of the Pixar music

1437
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
being in the parks in terms of

1438
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
like you don't have to do the count but

1439
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
has their

1440
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
fingerprints on theme parks the most.

1441
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
It's probably John Williams

1442
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
between both Disney and Universal

1443
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
but then there's Sherman Brothers

1444
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
obviously but Randy Newman may be a third.

1445
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
There's a lot. Maybe that is for

1446
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
solid third. Which is great because it's

1447
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Americana and it's catchy and

1448
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
there's heart to it and like what a great

1449
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
person to be the soundtrack of theme parks.

1450
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
And that always blows my mind because there's such

1451
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
he has such a different writing style

1452
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
for his solo work.

1453
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
It's not like the Sherman Brothers are writing these

1454
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
bizarre or

1455
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
angry or

1456
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
very

1457
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
political songs. Sherman Brothers

1458
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
were all happy days unless they have like a bunch

1459
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
of secret stuff and like maybe there's a

1460
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Sherman Brothers vault like the Prince Vault

1461
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
where they were really like giving

1462
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
it to the current administration. Just 12

1463
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
minute free flowing

1464
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
nine minute

1465
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
trumpet solos

1466
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
and a lot of

1467
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
like moaning like really

1468
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
they got their girlfriends to come and

1469
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
get freaky on the

1470
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
trail.

1471
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Here a similar connection

1472
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
to that. Jennifer Lewis

1473
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
long tenured performer

1474
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
and singer. Voice of Mama

1475
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Odie in this ride. I forgot

1476
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
she is also the voice of

1477
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
flow in cars.

1478
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
So that means Jennifer Lewis

1479
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
characters technically have a ride

1480
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
and a diner

1481
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
in these two parks.

1482
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
I did not realize that

1483
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
either. Flow is good.

1484
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
That movie's on all the time in my house. I like flow.

1485
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Then they do the last song on the

1486
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
ride also is written by not by Randy

1487
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Newman. The original

1488
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
like it's the instrumentals of a

1489
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
lot of the down in New Orleans and

1490
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Diggle Deeper and stuff.

1491
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Special Spice is the name.

1492
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Which takes the place I'd say

1493
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
of Zippity Doo Da as the finale

1494
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
song. Because I'm assuming they were like

1495
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
well there's a lot of white people that made this movie

1496
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
about a black princess so we should probably

1497
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
have a black person write the song.

1498
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Well now that we do have in common with Ron

1499
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Clements, John Musker and Randy Newman.

1500
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Well that's true. We are that.

1501
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
What guys talking about it?

1502
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
So I assume that's why that's

1503
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
the big show stopping finale.

1504
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
And you know who that is? What do you mean?

1505
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Who wrote the song? P.J. Morton.

1506
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Do you know who P.J. Morton is

1507
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
in terms of other musical output?

1508
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Oh I didn't realize this.

1509
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Maroon 5's keyboardist.

1510
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Is that right? I didn't know that.

1511
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Wow okay.

1512
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Was that a spark of

1513
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
surprise or excitement over the

1514
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
spectacular

1515
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
I am excited to learn that.

1516
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
I can't explain it to you why I was

1517
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
so excited to learn that. I mean I was excited enough to say it.

1518
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
I just don't know where you land on Maroon 5.

1519
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
How long do we have to talk

1520
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
about Maroon 5?

1521
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Do you not think it's going to take a while to sort it out?

1522
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
You know what I like? I like that

1523
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
song Sugar by Maroon 5 I think.

1524
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
I think that one's pretty good.

1525
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
I will say I could

1526
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
enjoy Moves Like Jagger if it was

1527
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
playing somewhere but it's not a song I like.

1528
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
But I don't go very hard.

1529
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
I have the first Maroon 5 album

1530
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
that came out where everyone was like

1531
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
you know there's that time when those albums come out and you're

1532
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
not sure where a band will land.

1533
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
And they were like maybe halfway between.

1534
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
They weren't like lame

1535
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
out of the gate. Exactly.

1536
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
They were in this other

1537
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
it was previously something

1538
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
called Kara's Flowers. Yes.

1539
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Slightly reconfigured and that was more of a power

1540
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
pop band which is a genre I like

1541
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
a lot. So I remember finding them as like

1542
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
oh yeah that's kind of in that zone

1543
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
so kind of

1544
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
horrifying that they became like kids bop

1545
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
music. Yeah it's weird because like Harder

1546
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
to Breathe came out which I didn't like and then the other

1547
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
songs I did like

1548
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
and then they eventually

1549
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
like completely switched genres and went

1550
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
like really chased like

1551
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
whatever current pop music sound is

1552
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
to some degree of success

1553
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
with me personally.

1554
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
But it's also like Coldplay were cool

1555
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
for two albums. Coldplay were

1556
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
cool. They were pitch four cool though.

1557
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
They were like Rush of Blood did that

1558
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
whether you think they were cool or not. Yeah I like Rush of Blood.

1559
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
Well you can say you like it.

1560
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
It was this cool.

1561
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
But I'm saying they were like ten

1562
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
like nine point five pitch four

1563
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
rated which in that way I'm saying

1564
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
they were cool. Yeah. And then

1565
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
all of a sudden or whatever over the

1566
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
next few albums it was like your mom

1567
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
likes Coldplay. Never mind.

1568
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Oh yeah. God I mean suddenly a band starts

1569
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
turning with puppets and people start saying they're lame.

1570
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Well yeah that's when it had this turn really happen.

1571
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
What did Pitchfork give

1572
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
the weirdos?

1573
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Is it a different scale when it's puppets?

1574
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Yeah I don't know. Two questions.

1575
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Mike has a big city walk sometimes.

1576
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
He saves a while to see if the

1577
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
weirdos are going to show up on that big TV

1578
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
on that big screen.

1579
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
I was reading the reissue of Wilco's A Ghost

1580
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Is Born on like a Pitchfork review of it like

1581
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
last week and the reviewer was like

1582
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
when I was in high school and I heard

1583
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
this album I'm like God what

1584
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
is this shit? High school? You shouldn't be

1585
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
writing for Pitchfork. Wait wait well when

1586
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
is the album from? 2003?

1587
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
No no 2005.

1588
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
But isn't that close to our age?

1589
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
It's pretty close. What are you? Why are you trying to

1590
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
talk this guy out of a job? I think he shouldn't

1591
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
have a job. Anyone of any age has any right

1592
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
to have any job they want to have. I'll read his name

1593
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
here and I want him fired. Mike's

1594
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
starting older millennial younger

1595
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
millennial wars. I'm switching to

1596
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
savesplashmountainchange.org

1597
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
position to fire this young

1598
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
man from reviewing Wilco music.

1599
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
That's what I believe.

1600
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Our children when

1601
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
they were born their years of

1602
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
birth will barely overlap with the output

1603
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
of Wilco. Are you to say they are not

1604
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
to be gainfully employed? They need to

1605
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
have been born in 1984 later

1606
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
or else they cannot

1607
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
understand. The only good ages.

1608
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
That's right. Anyway

1609
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
that's who did the song.

1610
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
I was heading to this other area which is

1611
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
because you know there's a little bit

1612
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
of like a change of the of the landscape

1613
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
and whether I don't know if

1614
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
we could address the exterior

1615
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
here or also just like the park in general

1616
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
but like what do we think of the flow

1617
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
what do we think of what it did to

1618
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
the areas of Disneyland Park that

1619
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
were affected like like like

1620
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
you know Bayou country the flow

1621
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
in the poo hungry bear

1622
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
you know now we got like now we got Tiana's

1623
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
palace with New Orleans stuff

1624
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
how are we feeling about this this

1625
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
neck of the woods? In some ways

1626
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
I almost feel that the new

1627
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
exterior is almost

1628
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
more seamless in some ways.

1629
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Now I'm not saying I

1630
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
necessarily prefer the exterior

1631
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
but in some ways it really blends

1632
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
well from New Orleans Square

1633
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
to whatever

1634
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
I guess it's Bayou country but I which

1635
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
doesn't make sense because poo's over there but whatever

1636
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
in some ways I almost feel like. It's

1637
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
got critters why is it not just keep

1638
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
a critter. I don't think critters.

1639
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
Yes I agree I don't know that seems like over

1640
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
think to me but. However it's still

1641
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
a nice sign and I think

1642
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
the sign is nice. The entrance

1643
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
as far as it like coexisting

1644
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
with poo and exit

1645
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
and gift shop and everything I think it's wonderful.

1646
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
I think it looks great over there. I agree.

1647
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
I think the drooping

1648
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
you know a lot of it fake

1649
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
foliage

1650
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
but mansion

1651
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
the Haunted Mansion area

1652
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
has a lot of kind of drooping

1653
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
plants. So

1654
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
in terms of transition

1655
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
droopy plants. What are those drooping

1656
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
trees? Different varieties

1657
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
but I saw a short

1658
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
video of like imagineering

1659
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
members ride Tiana's

1660
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
and one of the factoids

1661
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
was a lot of the stuff

1662
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
in the water out here as you're

1663
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
starting the ride is

1664
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
metal developed for outdoor

1665
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
for water rides.

1666
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
So it won't age. Oh

1667
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
and it wasn't before? I

1668
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
it might

1669
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
have been but or they were specifically

1670
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
saying maybe it was a newer iteration

1671
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
or. Interesting. Maybe something.

1672
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
I haven't seen the open Haunted

1673
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Mansion gift shop yet to know exactly how

1674
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
this transition out because there's I've heard a lot

1675
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
of discourse about this gift shop. Was it

1676
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
open when you were there? It was probably right.

1677
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
You might say I didn't

1678
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
make it a priority to go to the gift shop.

1679
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
What? Sorry to say

1680
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
this. That's going to be the whole episode this year

1681
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
about the Haunted Mansion gift shop.

1682
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
And how it floods. How they have to

1683
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
put sandbags out in front of the entrance when

1684
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
it rains because they didn't figure that

1685
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
out I guess. Because it floods

1686
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
the store unless they do that.

1687
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
When store doors flood.

1688
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Uh huh.

1689
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
I didn't do that down on Melrose.

1690
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Oh I don't.

1691
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
I hear you.

1692
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
It keeps flooding down by La Brea.

1693
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
So actually I do think

1694
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
it looks pretty good. Now the question of

1695
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
is it as striking? Is it as

1696
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
specific and unique as

1697
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
the old exterior of Splash Mountain?

1698
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
That is a different question. But I do kind

1699
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
of like the way it looks

1700
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
and blends now. Yeah as far as

1701
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
the campus. I think it's

1702
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
never looked better in that

1703
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
in Disneyland's little

1704
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
corner. In Disneyland's little dead end.

1705
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
I think it's great. I didn't

1706
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
really get to see it at night. I would

1707
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
be curious there.

1708
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Yeah god I don't know if I have

1709
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
a real take on

1710
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
better or worse exterior.

1711
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
I like the

1712
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
like whatever

1713
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
the plants and the moss

1714
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
or whatever you want. Like the green

1715
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
that now kind of overtakes

1716
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
the

1717
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
hit. Well let's

1718
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
get into it. It's a

1719
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
ride is now. It's not a hill anymore.

1720
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
It is a salt dome.

1721
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
It's a salt dome.

1722
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
We know this. We know that New Orleans

1723
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
has salt domes.

1724
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Of course. Of course we pay

1725
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
tribute to their cloud. Their wonderful

1726
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
salt domes. And she set

1727
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
up her like a place

1728
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
where a bunch of people work in a

1729
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
salt dome. It makes it weird when

1730
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
you're you're past the kind of

1731
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
the first lift. And then there's like a sign

1732
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
that points you different directions. And one is like break

1733
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
room. There's a break

1734
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
room in the salt dome. It's

1735
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
kind of strange. I mean I get look

1736
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
hey if I could work at it. Look I'd like to work out of a

1737
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
tree house more than I'd like to work out of some

1738
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
WeWork. That's true. It is a good. It probably

1739
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
is a really nice place to work. Tiana's

1740
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
Food's probably a good deal. Yeah.

1741
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
I saw the fake

1742
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
the sign at the meeting in the queue.

1743
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
Beignet Wednesdays. Tiana's Street.

1744
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
Does it say that?

1745
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
Yeah it does. Wow.

1746
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
You're into it. Yeah I'm in.

1747
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
Look this is part

1748
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
of the plot of it also

1749
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
is that she has the restaurant so you can go

1750
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
the goal in the movie is achieved. She

1751
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
has a restaurant. But how is she going to source

1752
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
all the food for the restaurant. She has Tiana's foods.

1753
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
This is its own operation. It's kind of like a farm

1754
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
but kind of like a farm built into a

1755
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
salt dome. I believe it's co-op.

1756
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
It is a co-op. It's a co-op.

1757
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
Good job if you can get it. If you end up

1758
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
you can yeah. Work our own. You're part of

1759
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
yeah yeah yeah. You own it

1760
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
and you're getting free beignets

1761
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
every Wednesday. Good deal. I think

1762
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
Tabasco

1763
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
is maybe the main

1764
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
production headquarter where they grow

1765
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
the peppers by a salt dome.

1766
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
Is that it? In Louisiana. I saw that

1767
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
somewhere when I was reading a little about

1768
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
salt domes.

1769
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
This was one of the

1770
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
craziest

1771
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
crazy person reactions I saw

1772
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
about this ride. It's like salt

1773
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
domes. That's some sleaziest

1774
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
work there. So this ride is actually

1775
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
more racist.

1776
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
That was a safe splash person making

1777
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
that argument. Yeah yeah.

1778
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
Some kook.

1779
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
It wasn't one of us.

1780
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
That's what we're saying. It wasn't one of us.

1781
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
The idea of like

1782
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
that it's going to open instead

1783
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
of and I'm just going to like I'm going to

1784
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
search high and low for every reason

1785
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
why this one's worse.

1786
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
I'm going to prove it in court

1787
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
that they made a more problematic ride.

1788
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
What a good way to spend

1789
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
your life and time

1790
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
that you don't get paid for. There are accounts

1791
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
still tweeting about it and it's really

1792
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
interesting. I mean also like I guess there's a lot

1793
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
of accounts that tweet about

1794
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
like there's still people that are really

1795
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
rooting for the Superman movie to

1796
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
fail this James Gunn Superman movie because

1797
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
of Snyder stuff. I literally don't know why

1798
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
it's because oh because because it all

1799
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
got taken away. That plan got

1800
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
aborted. Yeah I think it's because

1801
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
and if you look into it generally the people that are so

1802
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
aggressively posting are like still upset

1803
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
about Snyder stuff. So like

1804
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
people are very relentless.

1805
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Hasn't Zack Snyder moved on to a

1806
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
different movie studio and made like three

1807
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
or four movies? I don't know if he's made

1808
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
that many but he's made his

1809
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
Netflix thing that I can't think of the name

1810
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
of. He may have moved on but his posters

1811
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
have not. So I'm saying

1812
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
that people have. And they never have. Keep posting

1813
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
Snyder people. People have stamina

1814
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
is what I'm saying when it comes to

1815
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
posting to try to get something overturned

1816
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
or changed or root for some

1817
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
failure. I guess I should be

1818
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
I'm saying like I was surprised for a second and then I realized

1819
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
I see this all the time. Yeah well I've

1820
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
noticed in the clip three polls. Well

1821
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
sure. There's a

1822
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
stamp. People have stamina. People

1823
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
can last. Post your way

1824
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
to victory. You know what I think

1825
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
with the exterior and I don't even like

1826
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
I've already I think I kind of just said I like

1827
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
this right also. I said it on the just you don't

1828
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
have to. Scott you can just keep your reveal.

1829
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
I'll keep too myself. Let us know.

1830
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
I think I said I liked it. Yeah

1831
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
dub your brow with that American flag

1832
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
bandana you're wearing.

1833
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
So don't misunderstand me but

1834
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
I think what happened with that exterior

1835
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
is that I saw that promo art

1836
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
that art they released quickly in 2020.

1837
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
Yes. And I had been hanging

1838
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
on to that for a long time.

1839
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
And it has a big

1840
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
tree where that like stump used to

1841
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
be on Splash Mountain and it has a boat

1842
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
in there and the

1843
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
art looked awesome.

1844
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
And it doesn't the way

1845
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
that it has come out they don't have that tree

1846
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
they don't have a boat up there.

1847
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
It does not. Is there a big boat?

1848
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
Quite look as cool and

1849
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
maybe the whole concept. Oh my god

1850
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
I forgot this there was a boat. There was a boat

1851
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
stuck in the lagoon in the tree

1852
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
and I don't know

1853
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
if this was a completely different concept

1854
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
to me that looks expensive to put

1855
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
that up there and the way they did it

1856
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
looks less expensive. It was a wow

1857
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
well this isn't a salt dome is it?

1858
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
This is a big tree at the top

1859
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
worthy of avatar

1860
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
or of animal kingdom tree of life.

1861
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
Yes. That you

1862
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
this is the problem is that

1863
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
this is kind of now every

1864
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
time I look at the new Tiana exterior

1865
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
I think of ah but the tree

1866
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
like that to me equals

1867
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
the iconic

1868
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
ness of Splash Mountain's exterior.

1869
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
And as opposed to because

1870
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
the dome just does yes

1871
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
I of course like that Splash Mountain has this

1872
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
peak. It was really notable

1873
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
and so scary to me in a way that's haunted me

1874
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
forever and this yeah

1875
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
the fact that it's just kind of. This is what

1876
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
alright here you go it's a little. Right and again

1877
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
I almost think it sort of blends like the old Splash

1878
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
Mountain kind of was like oh and now we're in this

1879
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
kind of different landscape and

1880
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
now we're into Pooh Bear now we're into Bear Country

1881
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
or whatever but like I'm like oh

1882
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
this looks amazing and that's

1883
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
why I keep thinking money wise

1884
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
is that I think

1885
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
they did the best

1886
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
possible job they could do with this and there's

1887
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
really some good to great stuff

1888
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
but there's like things from like I'm like

1889
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
I bet that was another 30

1890
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
million dollars or something.

1891
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
50 million dollars. That could just be

1892
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
brain drain like clearly

1893
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
they had people who knew how to put a

1894
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
boat on top of a mountain. We've all been to

1895
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
Typhoon Lagoon. They might all

1896
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
retired. It's like how they say no one can do

1897
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
Technicolor chemical processing anymore.

1898
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
You think like nobody can put boats.

1899
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
Everyone's retired. All the boat guys

1900
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
retired. All the boat and tree guys had

1901
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
retired. Yeah.

1902
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
Wow. Yeah. Yes.

1903
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
People who put boats in high places they

1904
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
can't do it anymore. It looks great

1905
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
at night like it's like purpley at night.

1906
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Well here's the question because I would love to see

1907
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
it. Sorry to interrupt but I like in this

1908
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
concept art I'm seeing it's also like

1909
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
and they embellish stuff in concept art

1910
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
but like there is this very like

1911
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
it's like fireflies flickering

1912
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
this thing. Does any

1913
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
of what's going on at night have

1914
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
any of this magic that kind of sparkles?

1915
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
It has magic but it doesn't quite look like this

1916
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
but I do think there's like the

1917
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
lights are really cool. There's a

1918
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
little more like color variation

1919
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
in parts I think too.

1920
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
It gets a little purpley it looks like. It gets purple. Yes

1921
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
and I love I'm a big purple. My favorite

1922
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
light I've said this before my favorite

1923
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
like light setup is California Adventure

1924
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
Halloween Time.

1925
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
That purple light on

1926
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
in like the Hollywood area and like

1927
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
the in the old time

1928
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
whatever Carthay area

1929
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
that is my favorite mood

1930
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
you know maybe any theme park

1931
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
I've ever been to is that purple

1932
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
Halloween light. You know what I'm talking about. I know what you're talking about.

1933
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
This guy knows what I'm talking about. This guy knows a

1934
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
lot of shadows and stuff. Yeah

1935
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
but so yeah so there's

1936
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
like purple light on this and it looks really

1937
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
nice so yeah don't get me wrong

1938
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
that I think this looks bad or anything.

1939
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
Well and all the plant like look it's

1940
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
it's great plant work. It's great rock work.

1941
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
Yeah that's the thing like

1942
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
you like one issue is

1943
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
Splash Mountain versus

1944
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
Tiana but then like on

1945
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
top of that there is Disney versus

1946
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
itself you know what I mean. Yeah yeah.

1947
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
Like well-meaning Imagineers whose budget

1948
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
clearly gets cut and then they can't do this cool thing

1949
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
and that cool thing. Yeah and it's over the year and over

1950
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
the years too it will be interesting to see how

1951
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
you feel about the ride because

1952
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
like initially

1953
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
all you're going to be doing is going okay

1954
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
does this feel like Splash Mountain like

1955
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
and that's I think with the success

1956
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
of Guardians to me is that I

1957
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
don't think about Tower

1958
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
of Terror almost ever and I feel

1959
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
like quickly it went out of my head. I'm not

1960
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
thinking about it when I'm on that ride.

1961
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
And also though there is the benefit to

1962
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
the superior

1963
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
version always was elsewhere and it still

1964
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
is. Yes of course that's definitely part

1965
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
of it but I'm just like so so it's

1966
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
interesting because yeah I'm doing your

1967
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
there's a couple different calculations you're doing

1968
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
these first few

1969
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
rides on the ride. Yeah yeah

1970
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
but it's very loaded for a theme park fan

1971
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
in a way that it won't be for just

1972
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
you know a kid going on this

1973
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
ride. Yeah of course because the kid walks by it and goes

1974
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
oh that's cool it's a big what they won't know

1975
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
Salt Dome probably unless daddy explains it

1976
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
which he will don't worry daddy will explain

1977
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
it. But yeah yeah they go

1978
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
it's cool big big thing falling

1979
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
out of it. I do think also

1980
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
that you don't

1981
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
feel like it's quite as tall

1982
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
without a big thing sticking out

1983
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
of the top. Yeah. And that's

1984
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
maybe a bigger bummer to

1985
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
me. It's like an optical illusion. It's an optical

1986
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
it was an old optical illusion. It's like if you cut the tops

1987
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
off a main street you'd realize oh these

1988
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
buildings aren't you know that that's what

1989
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
three quarter not three quarter

1990
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
is it three quarter? I forget the scale.

1991
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
But yeah that's yeah

1992
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
yeah that was an extra optical illusion.

1993
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
So I'm sure that's why in the concept

1994
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
art they were like well let's put something to

1995
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
match sort of that whatever

1996
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
stump on top of Splash Mountain just to

1997
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
give it that illusion.

1998
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
So some of some of my

1999
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
complaints about it was that they've gotten

2000
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
rid of some of the stuff that scared

2001
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
you as a kid or as a teen

2002
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
or as an early 20s. Well I would say a lot of I mean

2003
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
the vibe of it is so so different

2004
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
for sure. And

2005
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
you know I would actually

2006
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
just to like do

2007
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
the cliff notes

2008
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
of the story

2009
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
there's just less peril

2010
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
in the entire

2011
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
notion of it. I think Splash Mountain

2012
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
always had you're going to get thrown

2013
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
down in the Briar Patch and that's all that's the arc

2014
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
of it but then things ended happy.

2015
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
In this it is all about a

2016
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
big celebration that Tiana is going to

2017
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
have. They are missing a band

2018
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
and you need to help gather

2019
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
critters

2020
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
critter musicians. This is great.

2021
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
To do yes along with

2022
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
Louie the alligator

2023
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
so that a big

2024
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
you know Tiana's

2025
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
food celebration can't occur.

2026
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
Great. Simple.

2027
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
We're putting the band together.

2028
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
It's really cute now are these

2029
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
musician animals

2030
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
in the musician's union.

2031
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
Well they'll have to deal with that.

2032
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
The other thing is like there

2033
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
were no human music. I know it says it was

2034
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
carnival season you know.

2035
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
And I'm sure they're busy but surely

2036
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
you get some young hungry

2037
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
up and coming musicians. Oh you're saying the humans are

2038
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
in the band. The human musicians I guess

2039
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
are all booked but there would be some old

2040
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
veterans who would just play the show hopped up

2041
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
on like

2042
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
beignets and chicory coffee.

2043
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
Hopped up on beignets.

2044
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
When was the last time you were

2045
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
hopped up on a beignet.

2046
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
Well it brings you back to life.

2047
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
You get a beignet at the what

2048
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
do they call it now the coastal jazz.

2049
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
Ralph Brennan's on the way out.

2050
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
They call it looks like shit.

2051
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
Downtown Disney's

2052
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
destroyed

2053
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
desecrated Ralph Brennan's. We do gotta get Jason

2054
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
hopped up on beignets.

2055
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
Get you sniffing a line of that sugar. That's a lot of sugar

2056
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
but I don't how do you

2057
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
even if you try you're gonna

2058
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
get some on your shirt. Yeah.

2059
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
That's true. It's part of the fun.

2060
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
I think

2061
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
I had a filled beignet

2062
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
at Tiana's

2063
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
palace.

2064
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
Filled with what? Like a

2065
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
custard or like a lemon

2066
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
filling. Are there options? There are different

2067
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
types of filling there? I think there was. I was there

2068
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
right after it opened. And they're usually

2069
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
not filled. It's like it is

2070
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
the sugar. It's usually just fried and powdered sugar.

2071
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
It's usually plain.

2072
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
But yeah.

2073
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
Just animals. Just cute animals.

2074
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
Just cute animals. Well until the

2075
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
there's like a kid drummer

2076
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
at the end. Yeah who's that kid? Who's that

2077
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
fucking kid? I don't know. Is that supposed

2078
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
to be Tiana Naveen's like child?

2079
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
Oh that's a good question. I don't know.

2080
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
I'm not sure. Is that a character in the movie?

2081
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
I don't know. I think

2082
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
they just went happily ever after

2083
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
in the movie. I don't know.

2084
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
And it's not answered by the

2085
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
it feels like an eventual

2086
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
episode or club three or something that we

2087
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
gotta do. Oh I think I put it in the

2088
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
poll I believe.

2089
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
At Eisner's pitch for Fantasia 2000

2090
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
that you meet. There's a

2091
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
procession to pomp and circumstance of all

2092
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
the princesses and princes

2093
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
and they present their

2094
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
children. Oh yeah.

2095
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
Oh yeah. Here's Cinderella.

2096
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Here's little

2097
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
here's Dylan Charming.

2098
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
Oh I would love that.

2099
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
Here's

2100
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
Breck Bellbeast. I don't

2101
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
know their last name. They hyphenated.

2102
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
God there's enough much children

2103
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
at this point they'd be able to do a procession

2104
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
and just them.

2105
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
The greatest kids in the world.

2106
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
Anyways but yeah so you were on

2107
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
the hunt for musicians.

2108
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
What a great way to then go

2109
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
you know just get a bunch of critters

2110
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
playing music. I mean they're like

2111
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
I have to move elsewhere for my

2112
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
ride notes but

2113
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
is this a good chance to talk about some of these

2114
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
animatronics and these do

2115
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
they stand

2116
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
out and do they

2117
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
which one

2118
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
of these these musician critters

2119
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
do we like? Well I like all

2120
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
of them. I've seen some

2121
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
complaints yeah

2122
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
they're limited some of them are limited

2123
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
in movement but I think all of

2124
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
them really pop and

2125
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
some of I've seen

2126
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
some people complain like some parts of the ride

2127
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
are much darker than Splash

2128
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
Mountain but I do think that

2129
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
highlights the show scenes where you do

2130
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
see some of the robots with the animals.

2131
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
So I don't know I'm a

2132
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
big do you want to start shouting out? I got my

2133
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
list of names here. Yeah sure yeah

2134
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
yeah well I don't

2135
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
you know I like kind of the there's a

2136
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
lot of good like woodland ones

2137
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
but my favorite animatronics I think in general

2138
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
are the big frogs

2139
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
or to spoiler and to jump

2140
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
around that you are

2141
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
you get shrunk

2142
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
in this and the ones that really

2143
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
pop to me are the frogs

2144
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
that are presumably your size. That's

2145
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
the idea there that you are getting turned

2146
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
frog-sized. Yes.

2147
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
To resemble what happens

2148
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
in Princess and the Frog. In the like laughing

2149
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
place part of Splash Mountain they've

2150
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
changed it now to where you get shrunk

2151
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
down and you see a big

2152
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
like you see Tiana like on

2153
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
a screen like her head is big like she's

2154
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
regular size appearing in

2155
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
but you're in this same and

2156
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
that's the closest to like yeah like kind of

2157
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
an ode to the psychedelic nature of the

2158
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
original ride too in some ways

2159
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
because there's a little more color in that

2160
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
section as well. Yeah it matches that

2161
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
and it feels like if

2162
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
they're following the format of Splash Mountain

2163
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
that there needs to

2164
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
be like a big tonal shift

2165
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
post that second drop. I think

2166
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
that is achieved very well.

2167
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
Yes. Yes. I think that's a

2168
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
very successful part

2169
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
and those frogs are really fun.

2170
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
Yeah. They stand out the most as

2171
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
like personality.

2172
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
Yes. To me. Like as a kid like

2173
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
just like your kid brain goes oh yeah I would be

2174
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
like oh we're in the frog part and

2175
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
there's like kind of like glow there's like

2176
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
a big bottle that you see pretty quickly

2177
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
I think that's kind of glowing.

2178
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
It felt very Alice in Wonderland.

2179
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Peering into

2180
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
and seeing the fireflies through the bottles and stuff.

2181
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
Yeah. That's all a lot of fun. And there's some griping

2182
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
about the CGI Tiana because she doesn't

2183
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
look quite like the robot Tiana

2184
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
or the hand drum but like I don't know.

2185
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
Yeah that's

2186
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
just watching videos. That was the thing

2187
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
that stuck out to me were those

2188
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:50,800
where they're like, it's just kind of basic CG animation

2189
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:53,960
to make it match the animatronics.

2190
01:14:53,960 --> 01:14:58,040
And I think the Mama Odie animatronic is really good.

2191
01:14:58,040 --> 01:14:58,880
Yeah, I think so.

2192
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:00,020
There's a few of them.

2193
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:04,800
But that said, in terms of match,

2194
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:06,840
the original movie I thought was unique

2195
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:11,840
in that it was 2D animation with like CG elements.

2196
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:14,360
And it gave it a very interesting look.

2197
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:16,240
It gave it a very unique look.

2198
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:18,760
And I wish they could have gotten that

2199
01:15:21,080 --> 01:15:23,120
in those little screen moments.

2200
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:24,640
That's true, and especially given

2201
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:27,760
that it's an important film in that respect,

2202
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:30,440
that it was a return to the hand-drawn form.

2203
01:15:30,440 --> 01:15:34,160
Right, but that actually might be a brain drain.

2204
01:15:34,160 --> 01:15:38,920
Or like, oh, we can't, this was kind of experiment-y,

2205
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:42,120
and these computers have been replaced three times.

2206
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:45,520
Like, we can't do this as easily.

2207
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:46,720
Yeah, maybe.

2208
01:15:46,720 --> 01:15:48,800
Yeah, I think also there is,

2209
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:51,040
sometimes it's like logic-wise.

2210
01:15:51,040 --> 01:15:53,000
They're like, well, if it's hand-drawn,

2211
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:54,960
it's not gonna match the robots.

2212
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:58,200
Some of that is a little too, I don't know.

2213
01:15:58,200 --> 01:16:00,640
It's in the same way that the timeline

2214
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:02,540
in Galaxy's Edge stuff where you're like,

2215
01:16:02,540 --> 01:16:06,240
what's cooler or more fun versus what has to completely

2216
01:16:06,240 --> 01:16:08,320
follow iron-clad logic?

2217
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:09,420
Maybe it's that, maybe it's not,

2218
01:16:09,420 --> 01:16:11,280
maybe it's just cheaper to do CGI.

2219
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:13,720
This especially, it's like, well, that's true,

2220
01:16:13,720 --> 01:16:17,280
but also, magic is involved.

2221
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:18,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2222
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:19,320
So this is kind of a disappointment, for sure.

2223
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:21,520
So they looked a little stranger to you,

2224
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:23,600
that would kind of explain that a way.

2225
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:26,520
Right, and I also, maybe somebody would say,

2226
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:30,120
well, the reason there's no tree and waterfall

2227
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:34,160
is because Louisiana's flat, and they do have salt mines,

2228
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:36,440
and they don't really have waterfalls,

2229
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:38,600
but I would say to that, who cares?

2230
01:16:38,600 --> 01:16:39,440
Yes, yeah.

2231
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:40,800
I would say, that's fun, though.

2232
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:41,880
1000%, yeah.

2233
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:45,040
Let me say that I think they pulled in

2234
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:49,280
the correct New Orleans elements.

2235
01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:50,440
Yeah, oh, absolutely.

2236
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:52,680
If there's that thing of let's actually

2237
01:16:52,680 --> 01:16:54,840
tribute the city and the culture,

2238
01:16:54,840 --> 01:16:57,640
the murals and the hand-drawn nature and stuff,

2239
01:16:57,640 --> 01:16:59,160
so true, yeah, yeah.

2240
01:16:59,160 --> 01:17:01,800
And the way in Florida, too, the Disney,

2241
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:02,640
they're slightly different.

2242
01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:05,000
Yeah, there's this big wall in the Florida one

2243
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:08,160
early on in a lift hill that's super charming.

2244
01:17:08,160 --> 01:17:09,400
And I was like, what was that before?

2245
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:10,800
And it was just like a blank wall.

2246
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:14,640
So any notion, I think people are being the,

2247
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:16,480
if you can imagine certain YouTubers

2248
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:19,400
being particularly angry about certain things,

2249
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:22,600
there's something about, you see a lot of,

2250
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:24,240
it's just empty, it feels empty,

2251
01:17:24,240 --> 01:17:25,520
and then you look at side by sides,

2252
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:27,880
and you're like, this has color, and it didn't before.

2253
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:30,360
Literally, there was no animatronic in this hill,

2254
01:17:30,360 --> 01:17:31,800
and now there's a Tiana.

2255
01:17:33,320 --> 01:17:35,560
Maybe other parts don't satisfy you on that level,

2256
01:17:35,560 --> 01:17:39,560
but the side by side is pretty,

2257
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:42,000
I don't know, it's an endorsement, I think,

2258
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:42,840
for the new one.

2259
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:44,440
Yeah, I agree.

2260
01:17:44,440 --> 01:17:48,240
Oh, God, I wish I remembered the exact specifics.

2261
01:17:48,240 --> 01:17:51,680
I swear one of the complaints I saw was

2262
01:17:51,680 --> 01:17:56,680
someone said, huh, a 1930s promotional painted mural

2263
01:17:57,320 --> 01:18:01,640
in a ride that takes place in the 1940s,

2264
01:18:01,640 --> 01:18:03,760
or it was something that small,

2265
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:07,000
or it's like a 1910s mural in a ride

2266
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:10,400
that takes place in the 30s,

2267
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:12,840
where it's just like, why, no one will,

2268
01:18:12,840 --> 01:18:15,520
they will just go, it is the past.

2269
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:20,520
Hello, mural police, I have a major crime to report.

2270
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:22,160
You'll wanna be sitting.

2271
01:18:22,160 --> 01:18:23,920
But no, I agree with you, Scott,

2272
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:26,600
I appreciate how much they did research,

2273
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:31,040
and got the vibe right, and the cuisine right,

2274
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:32,040
and the chefs.

2275
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:35,800
I think that stuff probably paid off better

2276
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:40,160
than it often does, and I know there's a lot

2277
01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:43,120
of research trips involved, we just found that

2278
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:46,040
on Sweatbox, and that always happens,

2279
01:18:46,040 --> 01:18:47,920
and I think it really shows here.

2280
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:52,760
There's a different and authentic feel, absolutely,

2281
01:18:52,760 --> 01:18:56,360
to the new, and it's a different slice of New Orleans

2282
01:18:56,360 --> 01:18:59,040
than New Orleans Square, which has been in the park

2283
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:02,080
since the 60s, so it's nice that there's a whole new

2284
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:04,400
area of it that's being acknowledged.

2285
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:08,120
I would say, I guess I can't keep comparing,

2286
01:19:08,120 --> 01:19:10,720
but I would say this first part of the queue,

2287
01:19:10,720 --> 01:19:13,280
the exterior part of that queue with the murals,

2288
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:16,520
and with her office, I think is better than Splash Mountain.

2289
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:18,240
I think it's a lot more fun.

2290
01:19:18,240 --> 01:19:19,680
Office is very nice, yeah.

2291
01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:22,440
Let me admit, I did not wait in the line.

2292
01:19:22,440 --> 01:19:24,440
I did not feel the need to like.

2293
01:19:24,440 --> 01:19:27,320
How did you do, I guess it was open by the time you went?

2294
01:19:27,320 --> 01:19:31,960
Oh yeah, yes, no, for me it was past any virtual queue

2295
01:19:31,960 --> 01:19:33,320
and all that nonsense.

2296
01:19:33,320 --> 01:19:35,760
It was pretty, if I'd gotten in,

2297
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:37,560
this is the only part where I told Aaron,

2298
01:19:37,560 --> 01:19:39,600
sucks, you should be glad you didn't go,

2299
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:41,920
was just that security took.

2300
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:44,840
It's like fucking, by the time you're in the car line,

2301
01:19:44,840 --> 01:19:47,960
then in the tram line, it took an hour and a half

2302
01:19:47,960 --> 01:19:50,280
to even be in the park, and in that time,

2303
01:19:50,280 --> 01:19:53,200
the Tiana wait went from 10 minutes to 35,

2304
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:54,720
and I'm like, brr, brr, brr,

2305
01:19:54,720 --> 01:19:56,040
and then the rest of it, that was awesome,

2306
01:19:56,040 --> 01:20:01,040
but what I ended up doing, Single Rider,

2307
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:05,400
the app doesn't say, they're actually kind of bad about,

2308
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:08,920
I've walked up to rides that say that they have Single Rider

2309
01:20:08,920 --> 01:20:11,840
and they go, no, and then this has one

2310
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:14,720
and it's not listed on the website as having one,

2311
01:20:14,720 --> 01:20:16,360
and it's a very efficient one

2312
01:20:16,360 --> 01:20:18,320
for the Single Riders out there.

2313
01:20:18,320 --> 01:20:20,120
Don't miss it, jump in, do it.

2314
01:20:20,120 --> 01:20:22,720
You might wait with three other people

2315
01:20:22,720 --> 01:20:25,320
outside the facility entirely,

2316
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:29,480
and then just be led 10 feet away from the logs.

2317
01:20:29,480 --> 01:20:30,960
It's really great.

2318
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:33,600
When they were doing Virtual Queue,

2319
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:36,200
I struck out like two or three times

2320
01:20:36,200 --> 01:20:38,720
when I would wake up at 7 a.m. in the morning

2321
01:20:38,720 --> 01:20:40,880
to get the Virtual Queue reservation.

2322
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:43,720
The problem was is that it would be screwing you

2323
01:20:43,720 --> 01:20:45,560
because you had to have a reservation for the park

2324
01:20:45,560 --> 01:20:48,360
that you couldn't cancel once.

2325
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:50,240
Oh, so you end up with your three strikes.

2326
01:20:50,240 --> 01:20:54,200
So the first time, I just went down anyway,

2327
01:20:54,200 --> 01:20:56,040
hoping that I would get it at noon.

2328
01:20:56,040 --> 01:20:59,080
I did not get it at noon and did not get to ride it.

2329
01:20:59,080 --> 01:21:01,040
The second time, I ate the strike.

2330
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:02,840
I have a penalty now on my account.

2331
01:21:02,840 --> 01:21:03,840
You have a, ah!

2332
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:06,280
I have one strike on my Magic Key Pass

2333
01:21:06,280 --> 01:21:08,000
Disneyland account. You have a scarlet pea?

2334
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:09,640
That's right.

2335
01:21:09,640 --> 01:21:10,640
And then the third time,

2336
01:21:10,640 --> 01:21:12,360
which I feel like it was two weeks later

2337
01:21:12,360 --> 01:21:13,880
after they had started doing it,

2338
01:21:13,880 --> 01:21:17,560
I finally got it in the morning, went down solo,

2339
01:21:17,560 --> 01:21:19,400
and then just had a decent day

2340
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:23,960
and walked basically right on when the Virtual Queue started.

2341
01:21:23,960 --> 01:21:28,640
And I was walking in to the queue and was handed a punch.

2342
01:21:28,640 --> 01:21:29,480
We'll get to this later,

2343
01:21:29,480 --> 01:21:32,280
but it was handed a poncho by some nice strangers.

2344
01:21:32,280 --> 01:21:33,120
Really?

2345
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:33,960
Like, do you want this?

2346
01:21:33,960 --> 01:21:36,080
Yes, grabbed it, took it, wiped,

2347
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:38,640
or just shook it to get the water off,

2348
01:21:38,640 --> 01:21:39,760
and then took that on,

2349
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:42,040
and then paid that forward as I got off

2350
01:21:42,040 --> 01:21:43,360
and gave another stranger.

2351
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:44,800
Is this a little thing that's forming

2352
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:46,120
in the Disneyland community?

2353
01:21:46,120 --> 01:21:47,320
Is passing off the ponchos?

2354
01:21:47,320 --> 01:21:48,160
I don't know,

2355
01:21:48,160 --> 01:21:49,200
but I don't know if it's been happening recently,

2356
01:21:49,200 --> 01:21:50,360
but it was happening that day.

2357
01:21:50,360 --> 01:21:51,640
It's a good thing because that's waste.

2358
01:21:51,640 --> 01:21:54,440
That's like, you buy an expensive,

2359
01:21:54,440 --> 01:21:57,480
and also bad poncho to be immediately thrown away.

2360
01:21:57,480 --> 01:22:00,680
Well, the other, the thing I had learned

2361
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:04,400
is if you really want a poncho for water rides,

2362
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:07,520
go into Amazon and buy a pack.

2363
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:08,800
They're like $2.

2364
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:09,640
Yeah, yeah.

2365
01:22:09,640 --> 01:22:11,360
They're like $1 for five or 10.

2366
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:12,720
They'll get you in an airport way.

2367
01:22:12,720 --> 01:22:14,640
They'll be able to pay like 20 bucks for one.

2368
01:22:14,640 --> 01:22:19,080
So certainly pay it forward if you have a pack, you know?

2369
01:22:19,080 --> 01:22:20,120
Get a pack.

2370
01:22:20,120 --> 01:22:20,960
Get a pack.

2371
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:22,280
I think we bought one at Disney World

2372
01:22:22,280 --> 01:22:24,160
when it was raining at Animal Kingdom,

2373
01:22:24,240 --> 01:22:27,600
and the plastic smell was so brutal.

2374
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:30,840
It felt, it really felt like it was giving me a headache.

2375
01:22:30,840 --> 01:22:32,960
Like we were, I had just like freshly put it on,

2376
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:34,920
and this one actually smelled similarly.

2377
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:37,240
So I wonder if they had bought it at Disney that day,

2378
01:22:37,240 --> 01:22:40,520
and Disney just has thick, smelly plastic

2379
01:22:40,520 --> 01:22:41,600
that gets in your brain.

2380
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:44,080
The microplastic's invading my brain.

2381
01:22:44,080 --> 01:22:46,400
That does feel, yeah, you're not crazy there.

2382
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:48,320
It feels, and it feels like it's getting hot.

2383
01:22:48,320 --> 01:22:50,640
It feels like it's like fusing into you,

2384
01:22:50,640 --> 01:22:52,120
as if you're getting like a,

2385
01:22:52,120 --> 01:22:56,080
you're getting some kind of like skin graft or something.

2386
01:22:56,080 --> 01:22:56,920
It's weird.

2387
01:22:56,920 --> 01:22:58,560
Is it supposed to be this hot?

2388
01:22:58,560 --> 01:22:59,880
Yes, that means it's working.

2389
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:02,280
They never, they changed it,

2390
01:23:02,280 --> 01:23:06,960
because for many years it was those iconic yellow ponchos,

2391
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:09,800
and then they changed it because it's like,

2392
01:23:09,800 --> 01:23:11,840
oh, you know what these are also great for?

2393
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:13,280
Shoplifting.

2394
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:14,120
Ah!

2395
01:23:14,120 --> 01:23:16,280
So they changed it to a more opaque.

2396
01:23:16,280 --> 01:23:17,320
That's why clear?

2397
01:23:17,320 --> 01:23:19,000
Yeah, that's why clear.

2398
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:23,880
But I love that they keep the smelly, hot plastic part.

2399
01:23:23,880 --> 01:23:25,440
They didn't adjust that.

2400
01:23:25,440 --> 01:23:27,880
It feels like the thickness of a clear,

2401
01:23:27,880 --> 01:23:30,160
the piece of plastic you put on your office floor

2402
01:23:30,160 --> 01:23:32,360
so you can wheel your office chair on it.

2403
01:23:32,360 --> 01:23:37,080
It feels like that thick of plastic and that opaque.

2404
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:39,600
That's the kind of plastic that breaks within three weeks.

2405
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:40,680
Yeah, and that's what it feels like

2406
01:23:40,680 --> 01:23:42,680
you're wearing with these ponchos.

2407
01:23:42,680 --> 01:23:43,640
And that is the kind of poncho I had.

2408
01:23:43,640 --> 01:23:44,880
Spiky floor plastic.

2409
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:47,520
Smelly, spiky floor plastic that you're wearing

2410
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:50,160
to protect you from the rain or from a water ride.

2411
01:23:50,160 --> 01:23:51,000
Yeah.

2412
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:51,840
So I wore it.

2413
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:54,240
So I put that on, but it was fun.

2414
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:55,400
It was a fun exchange.

2415
01:23:55,400 --> 01:23:56,680
It was fun to be like, you want it?

2416
01:23:56,680 --> 01:23:57,520
Yes, I want it.

2417
01:23:57,520 --> 01:24:00,360
And then I did the same thing leaving.

2418
01:24:00,360 --> 01:24:03,280
So that's a good tip if you want to pay it forward.

2419
01:24:03,280 --> 01:24:05,200
If we're sort of going in order, though,

2420
01:24:05,200 --> 01:24:07,240
anything else you want to shout out about the queue?

2421
01:24:07,240 --> 01:24:11,440
Because it does seem, there's good food representations,

2422
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:13,800
and then we're kind of going,

2423
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:15,200
let's just go back and order the ride.

2424
01:24:15,200 --> 01:24:16,040
That's what I'm thinking.

2425
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:17,480
No, I mean, just to look,

2426
01:24:17,480 --> 01:24:18,760
there's a ton to look at in the queue.

2427
01:24:18,760 --> 01:24:23,760
I felt like I hung back and let people go ahead of me,

2428
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:26,480
but there's just a lot of fun little things and details

2429
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:28,760
just like any other Everest

2430
01:24:28,760 --> 01:24:30,960
or when you see people's desks and rides.

2431
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:32,600
I guess that is a common thing.

2432
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:33,920
I like ride offices.

2433
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:35,800
Ride offices. I really like that.

2434
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:38,920
Yeah, I mean, from Spider-Man and Islands of Adventure,

2435
01:24:38,920 --> 01:24:40,920
there's an office, like fake offices.

2436
01:24:40,920 --> 01:24:42,480
Fake office, Final Four?

2437
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:44,320
Oh.

2438
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:45,520
We don't have one.

2439
01:24:45,720 --> 01:24:46,760
There it is, listeners.

2440
01:24:46,760 --> 01:24:47,600
You think it's maybe?

2441
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:48,440
There it is.

2442
01:24:48,440 --> 01:24:49,480
It has a nice fit.

2443
01:24:49,480 --> 01:24:51,320
Men in Black Alien Attack.

2444
01:24:51,320 --> 01:24:52,160
That's it.

2445
01:24:52,160 --> 01:24:53,000
There's good office.

2446
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:54,640
Oh, and there's a lot to assess there.

2447
01:24:54,640 --> 01:24:56,960
Do you want to work there,

2448
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:59,680
but it could be a good representation of an office

2449
01:24:59,680 --> 01:25:00,880
that would be bad to work in.

2450
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:01,720
Right?

2451
01:25:01,720 --> 01:25:02,560
Yeah.

2452
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:03,380
That's it.

2453
01:25:03,380 --> 01:25:04,220
Okay. You did it.

2454
01:25:04,220 --> 01:25:07,040
Well, just tell us if you hate that, but I like.

2455
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:07,880
No, I really like that.

2456
01:25:07,880 --> 01:25:09,480
That sounds pretty immediate from the three of us.

2457
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:10,320
I think that's it.

2458
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:11,480
Okay, wow.

2459
01:25:11,480 --> 01:25:12,320
You did it, yeah.

2460
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:13,160
Oh, Discovery.

2461
01:25:13,160 --> 01:25:15,000
We took one off last year.

2462
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:16,360
Jason's back.

2463
01:25:16,360 --> 01:25:19,320
We're figuring out our strategy for the next two.

2464
01:25:19,320 --> 01:25:20,160
This is good stuff.

2465
01:25:20,160 --> 01:25:21,000
Thank God you said that,

2466
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:22,960
because I remember I had pitched

2467
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:25,600
Ventriloquist's dummy Final Four, too.

2468
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:26,440
So you just saved us.

2469
01:25:26,440 --> 01:25:27,440
Oh, but he was on to think.

2470
01:25:27,440 --> 01:25:28,800
You know, there's the kind of like,

2471
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:30,600
don't say no to a pitch

2472
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:32,040
unless you can think of a better one.

2473
01:25:32,040 --> 01:25:36,040
Well, Scott, we just learned about little Jeff, though.

2474
01:25:36,920 --> 01:25:37,760
You mean Jeff Dunham?

2475
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:38,600
Oh, right.

2476
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:40,920
Yeah, Jeff Dunham's, you can learn.

2477
01:25:40,920 --> 01:25:42,320
This was in a text thread, not on the show, right?

2478
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:43,840
Yeah, this was on a group text.

2479
01:25:43,880 --> 01:25:46,600
We learned about little Jeff, the practice dummy,

2480
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:50,440
but also Peanut's dummy of Jeff Dunham,

2481
01:25:50,440 --> 01:25:51,880
I believe, is the full stack.

2482
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:54,040
Jeff Dunham's dummy Peanut

2483
01:25:54,040 --> 01:25:55,920
has a little dummy of Jeff Dunham.

2484
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:56,760
Little Jeff.

2485
01:25:56,760 --> 01:25:57,600
Oh, that's what it is.

2486
01:25:57,600 --> 01:25:58,680
The dummy operates a dummy.

2487
01:25:58,680 --> 01:25:59,520
I believe that.

2488
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:00,360
Well, that's what he was saying.

2489
01:26:00,360 --> 01:26:03,280
Well, yes, and then I believe you can buy little Jeff

2490
01:26:03,280 --> 01:26:04,560
and Instructional DD.

2491
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:05,640
You can buy little Jeff, yes.

2492
01:26:05,640 --> 01:26:07,440
So you can learn how to Ventriloquist.

2493
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:08,680
So you've avoided it.

2494
01:26:08,680 --> 01:26:09,520
You picked or you found a good one.

2495
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:10,360
No, I was gonna say,

2496
01:26:10,360 --> 01:26:11,440
I believe you can buy little Jeff,

2497
01:26:11,440 --> 01:26:15,200
and I believe that I can turn my car on in the garage

2498
01:26:15,200 --> 01:26:18,600
and for long enough that I can go to sleep

2499
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:20,520
and not do this episode.

2500
01:26:20,520 --> 01:26:23,840
You can smother yourself with a thick plastic poncho.

2501
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:26,080
You know that they can't.

2502
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:27,520
They like hand out implements

2503
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:29,600
that you could kill yourself with.

2504
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:31,040
You could, yes.

2505
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:31,880
Sorry, Scott.

2506
01:26:31,880 --> 01:26:32,920
Just spin that baby around,

2507
01:26:32,920 --> 01:26:34,920
like hole up in a bathroom stall

2508
01:26:34,920 --> 01:26:36,280
where it gets hot and musty

2509
01:26:36,280 --> 01:26:37,320
and you'll be out in half an hour.

2510
01:26:37,320 --> 01:26:38,920
Yeah, but if you do either one of those,

2511
01:26:38,920 --> 01:26:40,440
you know who's gonna appear in front of you?

2512
01:26:40,480 --> 01:26:41,320
Little Jeff.

2513
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:43,800
Is that who you see

2514
01:26:43,800 --> 01:26:46,000
before you enter whatever afterlife is meant for you?

2515
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:47,560
The pearly gates, yeah, I know.

2516
01:26:47,560 --> 01:26:48,400
Hey there.

2517
01:26:48,400 --> 01:26:49,240
I'm little Jeff.

2518
01:26:50,240 --> 01:26:51,360
You can go to heaven,

2519
01:26:51,360 --> 01:26:54,720
but it's nothing but Ventriloquist dummies up here.

2520
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:55,560
All the ones in the-

2521
01:26:55,560 --> 01:26:57,880
Send me to hell, send me to hell.

2522
01:26:57,880 --> 01:26:59,480
All the ones in the museum.

2523
01:27:01,720 --> 01:27:03,760
Okay, well, wow, fake office Final Four.

2524
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:05,080
That is good, yeah.

2525
01:27:05,080 --> 01:27:09,600
And then, you know, the actual like,

2526
01:27:09,640 --> 01:27:10,560
back me up if I missed anything,

2527
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:14,640
but the actual boarding zone is really similar, I'd say.

2528
01:27:14,640 --> 01:27:15,480
Very similar, yeah.

2529
01:27:15,480 --> 01:27:16,920
So like, if there's any like,

2530
01:27:16,920 --> 01:27:18,360
plusing up of like the actual,

2531
01:27:18,360 --> 01:27:20,720
the non-office part of it, I'm like,

2532
01:27:20,720 --> 01:27:22,880
could they have done anything to this zone?

2533
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:25,760
Because basically, it's supposed to be a salt mine now.

2534
01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:27,120
So they kind of just like,

2535
01:27:27,120 --> 01:27:29,600
to me it looks like the walls are a little dirty or something.

2536
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:31,280
Like it just kind of like splashes of like,

2537
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:33,000
maybe more like white color

2538
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,600
and I don't know even how to describe it really.

2539
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:36,960
But I'm like, ah, it's kind of just,

2540
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:39,600
this is more, this is sort of just the Splash Mountain Q,

2541
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:40,760
which is fine.

2542
01:27:40,760 --> 01:27:44,120
This is, these are minor gripes at the end of the day.

2543
01:27:44,120 --> 01:27:45,400
Really, look, just to tell you,

2544
01:27:45,400 --> 01:27:46,920
I wrote down fake office Final Four,

2545
01:27:46,920 --> 01:27:48,160
not that we'll forget, but even in,

2546
01:27:48,160 --> 01:27:49,000
then I was like, oh man.

2547
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:49,820
You were zoning out while I was just talking.

2548
01:27:49,820 --> 01:27:50,660
Indie's office.

2549
01:27:50,660 --> 01:27:51,960
I think I'm just dreaming of it.

2550
01:27:51,960 --> 01:27:52,800
It's just a good.

2551
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:53,640
It's a really good one, yeah.

2552
01:27:53,640 --> 01:27:55,200
Because I'm so fond of all those.

2553
01:27:55,200 --> 01:27:57,520
I like, yeah, Tiana's little office is one of the best

2554
01:27:57,520 --> 01:27:58,360
things and then.

2555
01:27:58,360 --> 01:27:59,200
Yeah, the office is one of the best.

2556
01:27:59,200 --> 01:28:00,960
The big question is going to be,

2557
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:03,160
is it little offices or big offices?

2558
01:28:03,160 --> 01:28:04,000
Oh, the collector's office is great too.

2559
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
Or is one size, yeah, absolutely.

2560
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,480
And do you even do a face-off,

2561
01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:11,960
are the haves big office and little office?

2562
01:28:13,280 --> 01:28:14,120
Good question.

2563
01:28:14,120 --> 01:28:15,600
Or you thrust them next to each other.

2564
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:16,440
Different categories.

2565
01:28:16,440 --> 01:28:17,280
Is it conferences?

2566
01:28:17,280 --> 01:28:20,360
If you, if we can find enough in both categories.

2567
01:28:20,360 --> 01:28:21,680
Yeah, oh, we have to talk about this.

2568
01:28:21,680 --> 01:28:24,520
I guess we have to like make the list to be able to tell.

2569
01:28:24,520 --> 01:28:25,680
Yes, I think that's right.

2570
01:28:25,680 --> 01:28:26,520
This is, but there's a lot, yeah.

2571
01:28:26,520 --> 01:28:28,360
Good work ahead of us.

2572
01:28:28,360 --> 01:28:29,200
There's going to be a lot too,

2573
01:28:29,200 --> 01:28:30,600
because we're going to have to,

2574
01:28:30,600 --> 01:28:33,720
we're going to have to really find good 4K video

2575
01:28:33,720 --> 01:28:35,280
so we can tell the details on the desks.

2576
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:37,760
I know, because some of them are offices we can't go to.

2577
01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:39,600
Some of these offices might be in Japan.

2578
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:42,280
We can't exactly go and hang out in the queue

2579
01:28:42,280 --> 01:28:43,120
and let people move past us.

2580
01:28:43,120 --> 01:28:44,840
Harrison and Hightower's office.

2581
01:28:44,840 --> 01:28:45,680
Oh man.

2582
01:28:45,680 --> 01:28:46,520
Yeah.

2583
01:28:46,520 --> 01:28:49,160
We also, though, have to like create a firm divide

2584
01:28:49,160 --> 01:28:50,800
between like dens.

2585
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:52,120
We have to discuss our dens offices.

2586
01:28:52,120 --> 01:28:53,400
Oh, okay, yeah.

2587
01:28:53,400 --> 01:28:56,600
But you can do office type things in a den.

2588
01:28:56,600 --> 01:28:57,440
Yeah.

2589
01:28:57,440 --> 01:28:58,280
So it depends.

2590
01:28:58,280 --> 01:28:59,560
Mickey, I mean, Mickey's den.

2591
01:28:59,560 --> 01:29:02,120
Oh, is the den, is the den an office?

2592
01:29:02,120 --> 01:29:04,800
Oh, that's where he makes his calls.

2593
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:05,640
There's a lot to talk about.

2594
01:29:05,640 --> 01:29:09,520
I think you have to see if 16 spots are filled up

2595
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:11,480
by proper offices.

2596
01:29:11,480 --> 01:29:12,320
Okay.

2597
01:29:12,320 --> 01:29:13,960
Before you can, and if they aren't,

2598
01:29:13,960 --> 01:29:15,480
then dens are in the picture.

2599
01:29:15,480 --> 01:29:16,640
Yeah.

2600
01:29:16,640 --> 01:29:18,960
Maybe we can, I don't know, we can discuss the rules.

2601
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:20,280
We'll have to discuss the rules, yeah.

2602
01:29:20,280 --> 01:29:21,720
Really on the air, too.

2603
01:29:21,720 --> 01:29:24,240
Maybe that's a preview, that's a Patreon episode

2604
01:29:24,240 --> 01:29:26,840
where we discuss the rules of the office and den.

2605
01:29:26,840 --> 01:29:28,320
Simulations of all his things, yeah.

2606
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:30,640
And we argue, basically, of what should be.

2607
01:29:30,640 --> 01:29:31,800
And figuring it out.

2608
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:34,280
I might argue, well, I don't even want to, yeah.

2609
01:29:34,280 --> 01:29:37,640
So maybe it's an episode where we argue the rules.

2610
01:29:37,640 --> 01:29:38,480
Sure.

2611
01:29:38,480 --> 01:29:39,480
Are you getting us all the way back?

2612
01:29:39,480 --> 01:29:41,520
Did you say 16?

2613
01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:42,360
He said 16.

2614
01:29:42,360 --> 01:29:43,280
Oh, okay.

2615
01:29:43,280 --> 01:29:46,440
16, because that's how many we've had competing.

2616
01:29:46,440 --> 01:29:47,560
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

2617
01:29:47,560 --> 01:29:49,320
I might argue for 32.

2618
01:29:49,320 --> 01:29:50,160
Okay.

2619
01:29:50,160 --> 01:29:51,440
32?

2620
01:29:51,440 --> 01:29:52,360
Have we done a 32?

2621
01:29:52,360 --> 01:29:53,600
Was the vehicle one 32?

2622
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:54,600
I don't know, was it?

2623
01:29:54,600 --> 01:29:55,440
I don't remember.

2624
01:29:55,440 --> 01:29:56,280
I don't remember anything.

2625
01:29:56,280 --> 01:29:59,200
Well, we'll have to, well, then maybe it's entire divisions

2626
01:29:59,200 --> 01:30:02,880
and it's little offices and it's dens and it's,

2627
01:30:02,920 --> 01:30:05,400
in 32, dens are in the picture for sure.

2628
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:09,120
But now we're in a four-hour episode territory.

2629
01:30:09,120 --> 01:30:10,760
Yeah, that's true.

2630
01:30:10,760 --> 01:30:12,600
So that's gonna have to be,

2631
01:30:12,600 --> 01:30:15,920
but if we add plus the rules as its own episode,

2632
01:30:15,920 --> 01:30:20,160
on patreon.com slash podcast at the right, the rules.

2633
01:30:20,160 --> 01:30:23,520
If we just did that every year and don't say what it means,

2634
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:25,960
there's an episode just comes out called The Rules.

2635
01:30:25,960 --> 01:30:27,200
Yeah.

2636
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:29,240
All right, lots to discuss.

2637
01:30:29,240 --> 01:30:34,040
Anyway, yeah, Boarding Area, Charming Zephyr,

2638
01:30:36,200 --> 01:30:37,320
are we on the ride now?

2639
01:30:37,320 --> 01:30:39,160
Thanks, yeah, we can go on the ride.

2640
01:30:40,120 --> 01:30:42,040
You know what I like, obviously, all right,

2641
01:30:42,040 --> 01:30:46,160
so there's like a, Tiana's food sign's nicely done,

2642
01:30:46,160 --> 01:30:48,520
Tiana animatronic, you get an animatronic earlier.

2643
01:30:48,520 --> 01:30:52,160
I think Disney World removed like a frog or something

2644
01:30:52,160 --> 01:30:54,720
and people don't like, I think you got an animatronic

2645
01:30:54,720 --> 01:30:57,360
much earlier in Magic Kingdom and that's gone

2646
01:30:57,360 --> 01:30:58,920
and it's just an empty space.

2647
01:30:59,440 --> 01:31:02,520
And that's not a good, you can't replace an animatronic

2648
01:31:02,520 --> 01:31:05,560
with nothing, but we don't have that effect in Disneyland.

2649
01:31:05,560 --> 01:31:09,400
So to me, I'm like, wow, animatronic in this little barn

2650
01:31:09,400 --> 01:31:11,040
kind of thing, that's good.

2651
01:31:14,480 --> 01:31:17,680
My opinions on living with the land have been gone over

2652
01:31:17,680 --> 01:31:19,520
and gone over and gone over.

2653
01:31:19,520 --> 01:31:23,120
Let me say this, I loved being a slow moving log

2654
01:31:23,120 --> 01:31:26,320
passing by little signs for fake food.

2655
01:31:26,320 --> 01:31:27,880
Oh, interesting.

2656
01:31:27,880 --> 01:31:30,760
I don't know what it is, this was great to me.

2657
01:31:30,760 --> 01:31:34,880
I like seeing little okra and gator peppers.

2658
01:31:34,880 --> 01:31:37,760
It's the queue, you were delighted by the queue.

2659
01:31:37,760 --> 01:31:40,320
This is my big hypothesis for you in living with the land,

2660
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:45,320
is that unpleasant interior in queue area.

2661
01:31:45,440 --> 01:31:49,640
That's also maybe an area, what are the most unpleasant

2662
01:31:49,640 --> 01:31:51,000
parts of Disney parks?

2663
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:52,440
That's very funny.

2664
01:31:52,440 --> 01:31:55,680
Can we find the worst room in any theme park?

2665
01:31:55,680 --> 01:31:59,440
Because I really do think, yeah, I think I'm always

2666
01:31:59,440 --> 01:32:02,680
carrying a lot of that annoyance into that ride with me.

2667
01:32:02,680 --> 01:32:06,280
I will say, I walk into the land and when you're looking

2668
01:32:06,280 --> 01:32:08,760
down at everything, looking at everything, I'm like,

2669
01:32:08,760 --> 01:32:13,280
oh, so nice, and the balloons, whatever's still there.

2670
01:32:13,280 --> 01:32:16,560
Yes, that's what I'm saying, in 1982 it was glorious

2671
01:32:16,560 --> 01:32:19,480
in there, that was one of the best rooms in Disney parks.

2672
01:32:19,480 --> 01:32:23,880
And when you could just walk on to living with the land,

2673
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:26,200
ah, what nice paintings.

2674
01:32:26,200 --> 01:32:28,440
Now I'll hop right on the ride.

2675
01:32:28,440 --> 01:32:29,280
Yeah, yeah.

2676
01:32:29,280 --> 01:32:31,680
Let's sew with switchbacks.

2677
01:32:31,680 --> 01:32:32,520
Yeah, right.

2678
01:32:32,520 --> 01:32:36,560
But I do like those fake scenes, those fake different

2679
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:38,400
climates at the beginning of living with the land.

2680
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:40,320
I like those too, that's some of my problem,

2681
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:42,240
is that there's not more stuff like that.

2682
01:32:42,240 --> 01:32:43,080
Okay, fair.

2683
01:32:43,080 --> 01:32:46,160
But I don't know what, I guess in the same way that we,

2684
01:32:46,160 --> 01:32:48,480
we are more interested in fake nature than we are

2685
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:49,880
interested in real nature.

2686
01:32:49,880 --> 01:32:50,720
Yeah.

2687
01:32:50,720 --> 01:32:53,600
And it's just similar, I just like seeing okra squash.

2688
01:32:54,280 --> 01:32:57,880
Purple pod beans, and then there's a big gator,

2689
01:32:57,880 --> 01:33:02,880
like Lewis made out of squash, and that's,

2690
01:33:03,520 --> 01:33:04,920
yeah, that's clever.

2691
01:33:04,920 --> 01:33:06,360
I don't know, give me these fake plants.

2692
01:33:06,360 --> 01:33:10,560
I think I like it more in that pre-indoor section

2693
01:33:10,560 --> 01:33:13,160
than I used, I think Instrumentals great out there,

2694
01:33:13,160 --> 01:33:15,040
I think they did a really nice job in everything

2695
01:33:15,040 --> 01:33:16,400
before you're indoors.

2696
01:33:16,400 --> 01:33:18,200
Yes, I agree, and I think all that, like,

2697
01:33:18,200 --> 01:33:22,000
I'm delighted by all the additions leading up

2698
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:25,720
to the first drop indoors, like as far as just the vibe

2699
01:33:25,720 --> 01:33:28,800
of like the fake green, greenage, whatever,

2700
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:29,640
in the vegetables.

2701
01:33:29,640 --> 01:33:32,000
Yeah, Lewis's little bottom.

2702
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:35,280
Yes, that's right, really early on, yeah.

2703
01:33:35,280 --> 01:33:40,280
No, yeah, okay, you know, exterior pre-first drop,

2704
01:33:40,760 --> 01:33:42,320
cause that's right, that's the first drop, right?

2705
01:33:42,320 --> 01:33:43,360
It's the small one, but the-

2706
01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:44,200
Yeah.

2707
01:33:44,200 --> 01:33:45,020
Although-

2708
01:33:45,020 --> 01:33:45,860
Did you drop into the ride?

2709
01:33:45,860 --> 01:33:47,640
Real soaker, real pants super.

2710
01:33:47,640 --> 01:33:49,400
That's a whole thing with this ride.

2711
01:33:49,400 --> 01:33:50,680
Did it get worse somehow?

2712
01:33:50,680 --> 01:33:53,040
Yes, I don't know if it's right now is worse,

2713
01:33:53,040 --> 01:33:56,680
but I've never gotten, that's why people I think

2714
01:33:56,680 --> 01:33:58,920
were really worried about having a poncho

2715
01:33:58,920 --> 01:34:00,960
is because for whatever reason,

2716
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:03,440
it feels like this thing is drenching you.

2717
01:34:03,440 --> 01:34:06,400
I always got nailed on those first, those little ones.

2718
01:34:06,400 --> 01:34:08,440
Well, the first, the little ones were always worse

2719
01:34:08,440 --> 01:34:09,440
than the big ones.

2720
01:34:09,440 --> 01:34:10,280
Yeah.

2721
01:34:10,280 --> 01:34:12,280
In general, but it definitely felt like all of them

2722
01:34:12,280 --> 01:34:14,880
were just nailing us left and right.

2723
01:34:14,880 --> 01:34:15,920
Yeah.

2724
01:34:15,920 --> 01:34:18,240
And yeah, that would like, either the first one

2725
01:34:18,240 --> 01:34:21,760
or the second one would like, the boats would,

2726
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:23,760
or the logs would overflow with water.

2727
01:34:23,760 --> 01:34:26,160
Yeah, you were getting suit pants for sure.

2728
01:34:26,160 --> 01:34:27,640
Right, you would, the log would just go,

2729
01:34:27,640 --> 01:34:31,120
submerge into the water and just throw water on you

2730
01:34:31,120 --> 01:34:32,640
versus just getting splashed.

2731
01:34:32,640 --> 01:34:33,480
Like-

2732
01:34:33,480 --> 01:34:37,760
And even I will admit that being soaked in pitch black

2733
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:40,320
is an unnerving sensation.

2734
01:34:40,320 --> 01:34:41,160
Yes.

2735
01:34:41,160 --> 01:34:42,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2736
01:34:42,920 --> 01:34:45,120
This reminded me, I forgot, I was just searching

2737
01:34:45,120 --> 01:34:47,960
for my notes that I took while doing it,

2738
01:34:48,800 --> 01:34:53,120
because I ended up doing this ride twice,

2739
01:34:53,120 --> 01:34:55,960
which is maybe an indicator of my enjoyment of it

2740
01:34:55,960 --> 01:34:58,720
and maybe an indicator of the ease of getting on it

2741
01:34:58,720 --> 01:35:01,880
at this point, at least on a random day during the week.

2742
01:35:04,240 --> 01:35:06,600
The first, I was just thinking about the like,

2743
01:35:06,600 --> 01:35:07,760
how soaked did I get?

2744
01:35:07,760 --> 01:35:09,920
And I didn't do a poncho, but I just wore a jacket

2745
01:35:09,920 --> 01:35:12,480
over the clothes I actually wanted to be wearing

2746
01:35:12,480 --> 01:35:13,800
and that took the brunt of it.

2747
01:35:13,800 --> 01:35:14,640
Yeah.

2748
01:35:14,640 --> 01:35:16,480
Definitely got more soaked the second time.

2749
01:35:16,520 --> 01:35:19,560
I think I was all the way in the back the first time

2750
01:35:19,560 --> 01:35:20,680
and something about that helped.

2751
01:35:20,680 --> 01:35:21,520
Like I could just kind of-

2752
01:35:21,520 --> 01:35:22,360
The back is always-

2753
01:35:22,360 --> 01:35:23,280
You have room to like manipulate.

2754
01:35:23,280 --> 01:35:25,240
You can kind of like lift yourself up

2755
01:35:25,240 --> 01:35:27,880
and fully get your legs off the ground.

2756
01:35:29,160 --> 01:35:31,120
In the second one, I was up further

2757
01:35:31,120 --> 01:35:32,240
and I definitely got it worse.

2758
01:35:32,240 --> 01:35:34,440
And behind me were a mother and kid.

2759
01:35:34,440 --> 01:35:37,120
And I forgot like, oh, you can just fit two,

2760
01:35:37,120 --> 01:35:40,960
you can fit a parents and a child in the same-

2761
01:35:40,960 --> 01:35:41,800
Just a little section, yeah.

2762
01:35:41,800 --> 01:35:43,040
It's kind of weird.

2763
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:47,880
And we got real soaked on that first drop,

2764
01:35:47,880 --> 01:35:49,360
which seems like nothing.

2765
01:35:49,360 --> 01:35:54,360
And the kid was so, so upset at that one.

2766
01:35:54,680 --> 01:35:56,920
And I'm like, where is the rest of this?

2767
01:35:56,920 --> 01:35:59,120
This is going to be really unpleasant.

2768
01:35:59,120 --> 01:36:02,760
And sure enough, by the end, just like, you know,

2769
01:36:02,760 --> 01:36:05,800
I mean, it's exactly what my son would do.

2770
01:36:05,800 --> 01:36:10,000
It's exactly what I did when I was 13, honestly.

2771
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,560
Like I was, obviously I was like a baby about this, right?

2772
01:36:12,720 --> 01:36:15,640
Anyway, they calculated it wrong,

2773
01:36:15,640 --> 01:36:17,320
but I also bring all that up to say,

2774
01:36:17,320 --> 01:36:22,080
I wrote down the quote that she really miscalculated.

2775
01:36:22,080 --> 01:36:23,600
This is not a kid who wants to be on this ride.

2776
01:36:23,600 --> 01:36:25,560
If the first one was that bad for him.

2777
01:36:25,560 --> 01:36:28,880
And then also he's in like a bad mood,

2778
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:30,760
but they're trying to get selfies

2779
01:36:30,760 --> 01:36:32,400
and he's shifting around.

2780
01:36:32,400 --> 01:36:33,640
And then I hear her say,

2781
01:36:33,640 --> 01:36:36,480
hey, smile for grandpa or no Sprite.

2782
01:36:39,680 --> 01:36:41,000
Had to pass that one along.

2783
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:45,200
As much as things change, some things stay the same.

2784
01:36:45,200 --> 01:36:48,120
Threat of withholding soda.

2785
01:36:48,120 --> 01:36:49,800
That's the only way to keep a ship right.

2786
01:36:49,800 --> 01:36:53,720
Is both a reliable punishment and also like,

2787
01:36:53,720 --> 01:36:55,520
when you get older, you're going to be glad

2788
01:36:55,520 --> 01:36:56,760
you don't have that soda.

2789
01:36:58,280 --> 01:37:00,720
I'll have to keep that phrase in mind

2790
01:37:00,720 --> 01:37:02,400
as a disciplinary tactic myself.

2791
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:03,720
I got two of these guys now.

2792
01:37:03,720 --> 01:37:05,280
That's so funny.

2793
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:06,120
Anyways.

2794
01:37:06,120 --> 01:37:08,640
Mike jolted in his chair when you said,

2795
01:37:08,640 --> 01:37:10,560
just the threat, no Sprite.

2796
01:37:10,560 --> 01:37:11,400
I didn't like that.

2797
01:37:11,400 --> 01:37:14,440
It's if I need to keep you in line.

2798
01:37:16,440 --> 01:37:17,760
I'll be defiant though.

2799
01:37:17,760 --> 01:37:20,440
I'll go buy my own Sprite.

2800
01:37:20,440 --> 01:37:22,360
I'll go buy my own Sprite.

2801
01:37:22,360 --> 01:37:23,480
We share a Patreon.

2802
01:37:23,480 --> 01:37:25,080
I have access.

2803
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:29,320
You don't control how many Sprites I get.

2804
01:37:29,320 --> 01:37:31,360
So, but yeah, you know what?

2805
01:37:31,360 --> 01:37:32,720
That outdoor great.

2806
01:37:32,720 --> 01:37:34,240
First drop, great as ever.

2807
01:37:34,240 --> 01:37:35,840
Although apparently wetter or something.

2808
01:37:35,840 --> 01:37:38,280
Then you're cruising into that first room

2809
01:37:38,280 --> 01:37:39,600
and you're in there and you're like,

2810
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:42,400
well, this just is as good, if not better.

2811
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:45,080
I think at that point, there's no question.

2812
01:37:45,080 --> 01:37:47,280
You're immediately like, wow, critters,

2813
01:37:47,280 --> 01:37:50,000
Lewis, Tiana, every, so many.

2814
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:54,360
It's, there are screens, but they aren't crazy.

2815
01:37:54,360 --> 01:37:57,040
I don't think that there's anything particularly effective

2816
01:37:57,040 --> 01:37:59,960
or memorable about the kind of the little magic dust

2817
01:37:59,960 --> 01:38:01,600
that's flying everywhere.

2818
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:02,440
I don't know that that's.

2819
01:38:02,440 --> 01:38:03,760
I don't know if it works.

2820
01:38:03,760 --> 01:38:04,600
They want it to.

2821
01:38:04,600 --> 01:38:06,480
No, that makes me feel like it's,

2822
01:38:07,160 --> 01:38:09,080
that makes me glad they haven't done

2823
01:38:09,080 --> 01:38:13,000
the Spaceship Earth redo because I feel like it'd be.

2824
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:13,840
They might do that.

2825
01:38:13,840 --> 01:38:14,840
It'd be like, wow, and then when you see

2826
01:38:14,840 --> 01:38:16,960
that spirit flying around and then they do it,

2827
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:17,800
it's like.

2828
01:38:17,800 --> 01:38:18,640
It didn't, yeah.

2829
01:38:18,640 --> 01:38:20,040
Oh, the spirit of storytelling?

2830
01:38:20,040 --> 01:38:21,880
Yeah, yeah, the old spirit of storytelling

2831
01:38:21,880 --> 01:38:23,160
I never got to do.

2832
01:38:23,160 --> 01:38:24,400
I think it would just be like,

2833
01:38:24,400 --> 01:38:26,440
I just feel like I'm watching a DVD menu.

2834
01:38:26,440 --> 01:38:27,280
This isn't anything.

2835
01:38:27,280 --> 01:38:28,560
Yeah, yeah.

2836
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:31,480
But besides that, I don't mind screens in this.

2837
01:38:31,480 --> 01:38:34,640
I love where both Disney and Universal are landing

2838
01:38:34,640 --> 01:38:38,080
in terms of screens kind of augment and support

2839
01:38:38,080 --> 01:38:42,400
and don't, aren't meant to be the main attraction.

2840
01:38:42,400 --> 01:38:44,800
So everything up until second drop, hell yeah.

2841
01:38:44,800 --> 01:38:47,160
I'm like, it's still critters playing music.

2842
01:38:47,160 --> 01:38:49,000
The music's really charming.

2843
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:51,480
I think you'd really be grasping for straws

2844
01:38:51,480 --> 01:38:55,280
if you were like, this is not remotely what.

2845
01:38:56,200 --> 01:38:58,240
Right, it's animals playing music

2846
01:38:58,240 --> 01:38:59,080
and you get to see them

2847
01:38:59,080 --> 01:39:01,440
and they're big and fun and colorful.

2848
01:39:01,440 --> 01:39:02,280
Yeah.

2849
01:39:02,280 --> 01:39:03,640
And you're at a speed that's kind of like,

2850
01:39:03,680 --> 01:39:05,000
I don't even have time to take it all in.

2851
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:06,480
I gotta go on this again.

2852
01:39:06,480 --> 01:39:07,880
Yeah. It's everything.

2853
01:39:07,880 --> 01:39:09,640
It has so much of the,

2854
01:39:09,640 --> 01:39:12,320
it retains a lot of what worked about Splash Mountain,

2855
01:39:12,320 --> 01:39:13,280
I think. Yes, I agree.

2856
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:17,520
I think that the only thought I would have is that

2857
01:39:17,520 --> 01:39:20,040
I almost in a way felt like the ride was quicker

2858
01:39:20,040 --> 01:39:22,320
and maybe it's just because it's such so much new stuff,

2859
01:39:22,320 --> 01:39:25,200
but I was like, oh, is it because of just like

2860
01:39:25,200 --> 01:39:26,840
kind of highlighting little show scenes

2861
01:39:26,840 --> 01:39:29,120
versus feeling like, I don't know,

2862
01:39:29,120 --> 01:39:31,080
like it's sort of what we talk about where it's like pirates,

2863
01:39:31,080 --> 01:39:33,400
there's just a ton going on and it feels like you're,

2864
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:35,760
you're not being directed where to look.

2865
01:39:35,760 --> 01:39:38,240
I'm not sure if that's kind of why it felt shorter.

2866
01:39:38,240 --> 01:39:39,440
Everything felt like shorter.

2867
01:39:39,440 --> 01:39:42,160
Obviously it doesn't go faster or anything,

2868
01:39:42,160 --> 01:39:45,400
but you are just being directed to little certain show scenes

2869
01:39:45,400 --> 01:39:48,440
from one to the next versus like,

2870
01:39:48,440 --> 01:39:50,360
there's so much stuff around you.

2871
01:39:50,360 --> 01:39:53,400
Now, is there really so much more stuff around you in Splash?

2872
01:39:53,400 --> 01:39:54,640
I don't think so.

2873
01:39:54,640 --> 01:39:57,560
It's just that because that was such an open room,

2874
01:39:57,560 --> 01:39:59,360
you're looking all around going, where are we?

2875
01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:00,360
Where are we going?

2876
01:40:00,360 --> 01:40:03,360
And I think maybe that led to some of my feeling of like,

2877
01:40:04,320 --> 01:40:07,600
like I got off of this version of the ride

2878
01:40:07,600 --> 01:40:10,240
and I was like, oh, that all feels a little,

2879
01:40:10,240 --> 01:40:13,200
like it felt shorter and it felt like smaller.

2880
01:40:13,200 --> 01:40:14,760
In my brain going on Splash Mountain,

2881
01:40:14,760 --> 01:40:17,400
sometimes I'm like, I'm confused where I am,

2882
01:40:17,400 --> 01:40:18,840
where we came in.

2883
01:40:18,840 --> 01:40:21,120
And now it's a much clearer picture of like,

2884
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:23,080
I'm looking here and I'm looking here.

2885
01:40:23,080 --> 01:40:23,920
Oh, sure.

2886
01:40:23,920 --> 01:40:24,760
We're onto another ride.

2887
01:40:24,760 --> 01:40:25,760
And I don't know if that's a bad thing.

2888
01:40:25,760 --> 01:40:29,840
It was just a difference in the way I process this track,

2889
01:40:29,840 --> 01:40:32,400
this flume ride, I don't know.

2890
01:40:32,400 --> 01:40:33,240
It's interesting.

2891
01:40:33,240 --> 01:40:34,360
I guess it is a little more,

2892
01:40:34,360 --> 01:40:36,400
being that there is like kind of more,

2893
01:40:36,400 --> 01:40:38,280
here's dialogue to pay attention to

2894
01:40:38,280 --> 01:40:39,560
that explains what's going on.

2895
01:40:39,560 --> 01:40:40,920
It's a little more, I guess,

2896
01:40:40,920 --> 01:40:42,520
show scene and less atmosphere.

2897
01:40:42,520 --> 01:40:44,920
It felt like more, my brain made it,

2898
01:40:44,920 --> 01:40:49,040
it felt more linear versus chaotic.

2899
01:40:49,040 --> 01:40:50,480
Which again, is not a bad thing

2900
01:40:50,480 --> 01:40:54,440
because it was all really cute or good animatronics

2901
01:40:54,440 --> 01:40:55,400
and good music.

2902
01:40:55,400 --> 01:40:57,280
Then you get into, yeah,

2903
01:40:57,280 --> 01:41:00,320
what used to be Bear Bear's Butt is now a screen

2904
01:41:00,320 --> 01:41:05,320
for Mama Odie who shrinks you.

2905
01:41:05,320 --> 01:41:07,720
And then that gives way to this new sequence

2906
01:41:07,720 --> 01:41:09,560
where there are lots of giant things

2907
01:41:09,560 --> 01:41:12,840
rather than tons of small critters.

2908
01:41:12,840 --> 01:41:14,080
Yeah.

2909
01:41:14,080 --> 01:41:16,520
I think this is all pretty delightful

2910
01:41:16,520 --> 01:41:18,560
and a fun surprise if you don't know it's coming.

2911
01:41:18,560 --> 01:41:19,400
Like, oh, that's a step.

2912
01:41:19,400 --> 01:41:20,600
And it's a way to like, you know,

2913
01:41:20,600 --> 01:41:22,760
create a whole, give it a dull new act

2914
01:41:22,760 --> 01:41:24,160
with new moves and stuff.

2915
01:41:24,160 --> 01:41:27,600
And it's the way to do the thing from the movie.

2916
01:41:27,600 --> 01:41:28,800
Yeah, yes.

2917
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:31,120
What not have Tiana have to be a frog?

2918
01:41:31,120 --> 01:41:33,120
Yes, not like arbitrarily.

2919
01:41:33,120 --> 01:41:34,760
A lot of the fur in the movie.

2920
01:41:34,760 --> 01:41:35,960
Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2921
01:41:35,960 --> 01:41:36,800
Criticism of it.

2922
01:41:36,800 --> 01:41:41,800
So to not, you know, make it where it's just,

2923
01:41:41,920 --> 01:41:43,480
oh, the thing that happened in the first movie

2924
01:41:43,480 --> 01:41:45,200
is happening again, but you're here.

2925
01:41:45,200 --> 01:41:46,680
It's a little bit different.

2926
01:41:46,680 --> 01:41:49,360
My only question is, why?

2927
01:41:49,360 --> 01:41:51,360
Why do you get shrunk?

2928
01:41:51,360 --> 01:41:53,800
Oh, you mean like a narrative reason, you're saying?

2929
01:41:53,800 --> 01:41:54,720
Yeah.

2930
01:41:54,720 --> 01:41:56,280
Hmm, it's a good question.

2931
01:41:56,280 --> 01:41:57,600
I've been thinking about this a lot.

2932
01:41:57,600 --> 01:41:59,360
It's like, time to get small.

2933
01:41:59,360 --> 01:42:00,200
Why?

2934
01:42:00,200 --> 01:42:01,480
That bottle is there.

2935
01:42:01,480 --> 01:42:04,760
I don't know if that suggests we drank from that bottle.

2936
01:42:04,760 --> 01:42:05,800
Is that, how did, do you remember?

2937
01:42:05,800 --> 01:42:06,640
I know that I'm thinking about it.

2938
01:42:06,640 --> 01:42:08,840
Does she drink from something and turn into a frog?

2939
01:42:08,840 --> 01:42:09,680
Or is it just a spell?

2940
01:42:09,680 --> 01:42:10,520
Oh, I forget.

2941
01:42:10,520 --> 01:42:11,340
I forget too.

2942
01:42:11,340 --> 01:42:16,340
No, she in the, it's, I watched the trailer,

2943
01:42:16,440 --> 01:42:19,120
the original trailer, and she kisses him,

2944
01:42:19,120 --> 01:42:20,960
like the classic Prince and the Frog.

2945
01:42:20,960 --> 01:42:23,240
If you kiss me, I'll turn into a handsome prince,

2946
01:42:23,240 --> 01:42:25,280
and that turns her into a frog.

2947
01:42:25,320 --> 01:42:27,600
So we should have gotten a big smooch

2948
01:42:27,600 --> 01:42:30,240
from some character.

2949
01:42:30,240 --> 01:42:31,840
That would be the note.

2950
01:42:31,840 --> 01:42:33,240
That we get a big smooch. Giant lips.

2951
01:42:33,240 --> 01:42:34,080
Yeah.

2952
01:42:34,080 --> 01:42:36,360
Giant, like the Rolling Stones logo.

2953
01:42:37,840 --> 01:42:38,680
The scariest mouth.

2954
01:42:38,680 --> 01:42:39,640
Yeah, you go through it.

2955
01:42:39,640 --> 01:42:42,480
You go through giant lips, and once you pass through,

2956
01:42:42,480 --> 01:42:43,320
I guess that would take me to the body.

2957
01:42:43,320 --> 01:42:45,800
I mean, that would also, that would be very unnerving,

2958
01:42:45,800 --> 01:42:47,840
and scary, and gross.

2959
01:42:47,840 --> 01:42:51,000
I did see one of the things mentioned about this ride

2960
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,280
is, in terms of characters not in it,

2961
01:42:53,320 --> 01:42:56,320
Dr. Facilier, the villain in the movie is not in it.

2962
01:42:56,320 --> 01:42:59,000
Well, this is all speculation too,

2963
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:03,520
because of like, Dr. Facilier is in other things in Parks.

2964
01:43:03,520 --> 01:43:05,000
Well, that's what I was gonna say.

2965
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:07,240
I thought, oh, did they think that was too much

2966
01:43:07,240 --> 01:43:10,880
of a MacGuffin, like voodoo is used like.

2967
01:43:10,880 --> 01:43:12,240
Well, that's what people have said online,

2968
01:43:12,240 --> 01:43:13,080
where like, that sort of.

2969
01:43:13,080 --> 01:43:16,200
Fortunetelling and Romani is used for magic.

2970
01:43:16,200 --> 01:43:17,040
Right.

2971
01:43:17,040 --> 01:43:19,640
But, Dr. Facilier has been in like,

2972
01:43:19,640 --> 01:43:22,880
two Oogie Boogie Passes in the 2020s.

2973
01:43:23,840 --> 01:43:27,040
Disney is not completely clear on exactly why.

2974
01:43:27,040 --> 01:43:28,920
In the narrative of Princess and the Frog,

2975
01:43:28,920 --> 01:43:30,560
he's like, dead, but.

2976
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:32,640
Oh, that's right, I was just wondering.

2977
01:43:32,640 --> 01:43:33,840
But friends on the other side,

2978
01:43:33,840 --> 01:43:36,080
like you could bring him back too.

2979
01:43:36,080 --> 01:43:38,400
This might be, and we've been going for a little bit,

2980
01:43:38,400 --> 01:43:40,960
so it might be a good time to get into this discussion,

2981
01:43:40,960 --> 01:43:42,760
because I think this is the discussion,

2982
01:43:42,760 --> 01:43:46,040
is the drop, and the feeling of the drop.

2983
01:43:46,040 --> 01:43:50,440
Because I, if that was the calculation,

2984
01:43:50,440 --> 01:43:52,600
if it's that we wanna get away from voodoo,

2985
01:43:53,280 --> 01:43:55,480
or we can't do Facilier.

2986
01:43:55,480 --> 01:43:58,360
Therefore, if you haven't been on it,

2987
01:43:58,360 --> 01:44:02,120
the vibe of the lift hill and then the drop is kind of a,

2988
01:44:02,120 --> 01:44:06,080
it's kind of now not scary, but celebratory.

2989
01:44:06,080 --> 01:44:07,640
And there's a party waiting for you,

2990
01:44:07,640 --> 01:44:09,000
and we'll get you there in a minute.

2991
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:10,480
And maybe it's also kind of like,

2992
01:44:10,480 --> 01:44:13,560
that's the passage to make you not small anymore.

2993
01:44:13,560 --> 01:44:14,400
Right.

2994
01:44:14,400 --> 01:44:16,360
Like the drop is supposed to be the transformation.

2995
01:44:16,360 --> 01:44:17,200
Right.

2996
01:44:17,200 --> 01:44:18,600
And I get all that.

2997
01:44:18,600 --> 01:44:21,920
I'm just not sure that it works for me,

2998
01:44:21,960 --> 01:44:25,640
that there's no build of tension and fear.

2999
01:44:25,640 --> 01:44:28,680
It's the one thing I would want changed.

3000
01:44:28,680 --> 01:44:29,520
Yeah.

3001
01:44:29,520 --> 01:44:32,240
Even as much as little things I have here and there

3002
01:44:32,240 --> 01:44:33,880
about it, that's the one thing.

3003
01:44:33,880 --> 01:44:35,600
I just, I don't think it works.

3004
01:44:35,600 --> 01:44:37,000
It doesn't do it.

3005
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:37,840
Yeah.

3006
01:44:37,840 --> 01:44:40,600
The fear, especially when I was a kid,

3007
01:44:40,600 --> 01:44:43,520
that you would feel going up that lift hill,

3008
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:47,920
was so strong and made the drop so much cooler.

3009
01:44:47,920 --> 01:44:48,760
Yeah.

3010
01:44:48,760 --> 01:44:50,600
And now it's sort of just a very tone.

3011
01:44:50,640 --> 01:44:52,520
The shadows are will like,

3012
01:44:52,520 --> 01:44:54,120
are seared into me forever.

3013
01:44:54,120 --> 01:44:54,960
Yeah.

3014
01:44:54,960 --> 01:44:55,800
Not the silhouettes I'm saying.

3015
01:44:55,800 --> 01:44:56,640
Yeah.

3016
01:44:56,640 --> 01:44:57,480
Like seared into me.

3017
01:44:57,480 --> 01:44:59,320
Vultures, oh my God.

3018
01:44:59,320 --> 01:45:00,480
Thunder, lightning.

3019
01:45:02,560 --> 01:45:06,120
And I think it all also really fits with it ultimately,

3020
01:45:06,120 --> 01:45:09,920
that all lift hills before big plume drops

3021
01:45:09,920 --> 01:45:14,680
feel like industrial, scary, clanky.

3022
01:45:14,680 --> 01:45:15,520
Yeah, yeah.

3023
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:16,680
You're going up a big belt.

3024
01:45:16,680 --> 01:45:19,080
It's like the end of Toy Story 3.

3025
01:45:19,120 --> 01:45:22,280
It's like I'm heading, there's light up there,

3026
01:45:22,280 --> 01:45:23,800
but I don't think that's good light.

3027
01:45:23,800 --> 01:45:25,960
I think I'm going to hell right now.

3028
01:45:25,960 --> 01:45:29,440
And it is what the ride mechanism feels like.

3029
01:45:29,440 --> 01:45:31,720
It makes what is ultimately not that bad

3030
01:45:31,720 --> 01:45:32,800
so much scarier to me.

3031
01:45:32,800 --> 01:45:35,760
You all know about my journey with this.

3032
01:45:35,760 --> 01:45:39,200
So much of it was psychological from the way it was treated.

3033
01:45:39,200 --> 01:45:42,360
So I don't know if it really works to have it be like,

3034
01:45:42,360 --> 01:45:47,360
hey, you'll be at a party in 20 seconds, get ready.

3035
01:45:48,080 --> 01:45:53,080
I saw some Imagineers say kind of contradictory things

3036
01:45:53,120 --> 01:45:56,440
of we want to scale back on the peril,

3037
01:45:56,440 --> 01:45:59,440
but, and then it was also,

3038
01:45:59,440 --> 01:46:03,800
we recognize that conquering the big drop on this ride

3039
01:46:03,800 --> 01:46:07,640
is a rite of passage for a lot of kids.

3040
01:46:07,640 --> 01:46:12,640
So it's like, well, those sound like contradictory goals.

3041
01:46:12,920 --> 01:46:17,160
I mean, I think we've been on the record

3042
01:46:17,160 --> 01:46:21,560
as being like, yeah, it's good when children's entertainment

3043
01:46:21,560 --> 01:46:23,160
has scary stuff.

3044
01:46:23,160 --> 01:46:25,480
It's good to have some scares.

3045
01:46:25,480 --> 01:46:28,640
Toy Story 3, a great example.

3046
01:46:28,640 --> 01:46:30,440
But yeah, I don't know.

3047
01:46:30,440 --> 01:46:32,680
I think they were trying to have it both ways.

3048
01:46:32,680 --> 01:46:35,000
Keep the drop, keep the rite of passage,

3049
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:38,640
but scale back on the sinister nature of it.

3050
01:46:38,640 --> 01:46:40,720
This is a whole nother conversation probably,

3051
01:46:40,720 --> 01:46:45,120
but I do sense overthink, I would say,

3052
01:46:45,200 --> 01:46:47,280
in some aspects of Disney.

3053
01:46:47,280 --> 01:46:50,720
Like the new bride I have not seen on Haunted Mansion,

3054
01:46:50,720 --> 01:46:53,080
we've all read the Kim Irvine article,

3055
01:46:53,080 --> 01:46:55,160
and Kim is the daughter of Leota Toombs.

3056
01:46:55,160 --> 01:46:57,040
She's done a lot of great stuff at Disney.

3057
01:46:57,040 --> 01:46:58,360
She said they took the old bride out

3058
01:46:58,360 --> 01:47:01,000
because they didn't want to celebrate ax murdering,

3059
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,560
and look, it's a haunted house ride full of-

3060
01:47:03,560 --> 01:47:05,000
Celebrate?

3061
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:08,200
Having it isn't necessarily celebration.

3062
01:47:08,200 --> 01:47:10,320
There feels to be some sort of overthink happening.

3063
01:47:10,320 --> 01:47:12,080
And also, by the way, if you listen to,

3064
01:47:12,080 --> 01:47:14,520
if you go through year by year on a Haunted Mansion,

3065
01:47:14,520 --> 01:47:17,120
I cited that as the thing I,

3066
01:47:17,120 --> 01:47:19,360
one of my strongest dislikes in Haunted Mansion.

3067
01:47:19,360 --> 01:47:21,200
And the new version looks better.

3068
01:47:21,200 --> 01:47:22,040
Is it better?

3069
01:47:22,040 --> 01:47:24,360
And the version on video I've seen looks better.

3070
01:47:24,360 --> 01:47:25,200
That's good, that's good.

3071
01:47:25,200 --> 01:47:26,320
But it's just like, I'm just like,

3072
01:47:26,320 --> 01:47:28,400
I feel like that's kind of an overthinky.

3073
01:47:28,400 --> 01:47:30,760
There's ghosts shooting each other

3074
01:47:30,760 --> 01:47:32,160
with muskets on this ride.

3075
01:47:32,160 --> 01:47:34,080
Portraying something isn't celebrating.

3076
01:47:34,080 --> 01:47:36,840
So right, I'm just saying that feels like a very overthink,

3077
01:47:36,840 --> 01:47:38,760
and I think a lot of it's coming from a good place.

3078
01:47:38,760 --> 01:47:40,680
I'm just saying there seems to be some overthink

3079
01:47:40,680 --> 01:47:41,680
in that regard.

3080
01:47:41,680 --> 01:47:42,720
So I don't know if they're like,

3081
01:47:42,720 --> 01:47:44,560
we don't want to scare kids,

3082
01:47:44,560 --> 01:47:46,400
but I'm like, kids like to be scared.

3083
01:47:46,400 --> 01:47:48,200
Again, we don't have a concrete reason

3084
01:47:48,200 --> 01:47:52,200
why this lift hill has nothing to be scary in it,

3085
01:47:52,200 --> 01:47:53,560
but we're speculating.

3086
01:47:53,560 --> 01:47:55,480
Yeah, no, I think over,

3087
01:47:55,480 --> 01:47:56,800
modern Disney overthink is right.

3088
01:47:56,800 --> 01:47:58,680
And then it's like, well, why,

3089
01:47:58,680 --> 01:48:01,280
shouldn't this be the same logic of,

3090
01:48:01,280 --> 01:48:04,000
couldn't we take a drop tower ride

3091
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:05,920
and make it fun and silly and celebratory

3092
01:48:05,920 --> 01:48:08,120
instead of just scary?

3093
01:48:08,120 --> 01:48:11,880
And that is so successful in that whole demonstration

3094
01:48:11,880 --> 01:48:16,280
of it's like throwing a baby up and down a little bit.

3095
01:48:16,280 --> 01:48:20,600
Like, so you'd think, well, that could work,

3096
01:48:20,600 --> 01:48:22,480
but I think clearly Guardians works

3097
01:48:22,480 --> 01:48:23,680
and this does not really work.

3098
01:48:23,680 --> 01:48:25,600
It's a different thing though, too.

3099
01:48:25,600 --> 01:48:27,160
Yeah. It's a different,

3100
01:48:27,160 --> 01:48:29,160
because like that, the Tower of Terror,

3101
01:48:29,160 --> 01:48:31,160
that was always the end, that was the climax,

3102
01:48:31,160 --> 01:48:34,480
and now they're taking the Tower of Terror ride system,

3103
01:48:34,480 --> 01:48:36,760
and that's going to be the whole ride basically

3104
01:48:36,760 --> 01:48:39,280
versus before where the lead up is a big part

3105
01:48:39,280 --> 01:48:41,640
of almost half the ride.

3106
01:48:41,640 --> 01:48:42,480
Oh, you're right.

3107
01:48:42,480 --> 01:48:44,200
That is a significant aspect of the change.

3108
01:48:44,200 --> 01:48:46,480
They're completely taking just the climax of the ride

3109
01:48:46,480 --> 01:48:48,720
and using that ride system to make a whole nother ride.

3110
01:48:48,720 --> 01:48:49,960
And then they're seeing like, okay,

3111
01:48:49,960 --> 01:48:52,440
can we just make a different vibe?

3112
01:48:52,440 --> 01:48:53,920
And it's very successful.

3113
01:48:53,920 --> 01:48:55,960
And then they change the music, which doesn't,

3114
01:48:55,960 --> 01:48:58,240
I mean, the different songs change the vibe a little bit,

3115
01:48:58,240 --> 01:49:01,200
and especially Monsters After Dark changes the vibe.

3116
01:49:01,200 --> 01:49:03,120
So you do a variation just in ride.

3117
01:49:03,120 --> 01:49:05,920
But when you're talking about a ride that's this long,

3118
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:07,200
and I've talked about this before,

3119
01:49:07,200 --> 01:49:10,240
a good ride often does need, I think, tone shifts,

3120
01:49:10,240 --> 01:49:11,480
little tone shifts.

3121
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:13,160
Which is why I like the shrinking,

3122
01:49:13,160 --> 01:49:14,000
why I like everything's big now.

3123
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:15,760
Right, tone shifts, Star Tours is the moment

3124
01:49:15,760 --> 01:49:17,160
where he said we've just joined the Rebel Alliance

3125
01:49:17,160 --> 01:49:19,600
or whatever like that, little stuff like that.

3126
01:49:19,600 --> 01:49:22,640
So this is very similar tonally for nine minutes.

3127
01:49:22,640 --> 01:49:23,480
That's the problem.

3128
01:49:23,480 --> 01:49:24,960
It needs a new app.

3129
01:49:24,960 --> 01:49:26,840
We just need a little change up,

3130
01:49:26,840 --> 01:49:29,680
and it doesn't even, if somebody can argue

3131
01:49:29,680 --> 01:49:32,840
why it could have a different emotion on the lift hill,

3132
01:49:32,840 --> 01:49:34,680
maybe, I don't know what it is.

3133
01:49:34,680 --> 01:49:36,000
But Scary sure seems to follow, doesn't it?

3134
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,400
But Scary sure seems to make the most sense.

3135
01:49:38,920 --> 01:49:43,680
Well, the stuff we mentioned earlier about,

3136
01:49:43,680 --> 01:49:46,160
they went to New Orleans, they did all this research,

3137
01:49:46,160 --> 01:49:47,440
they met with all these people,

3138
01:49:47,440 --> 01:49:49,760
they studied all this architecture and the landscapes,

3139
01:49:49,760 --> 01:49:51,200
blah, blah, blah.

3140
01:49:51,200 --> 01:49:54,240
I think they got most of it.

3141
01:49:54,240 --> 01:49:56,280
Missing a big puzzle piece here,

3142
01:49:56,280 --> 01:49:58,480
which is New Orleans is one of the most

3143
01:49:58,480 --> 01:50:01,760
haunted places in America, I feel like.

3144
01:50:01,760 --> 01:50:05,760
It is so, so much, so much history.

3145
01:50:05,920 --> 01:50:08,480
What if there were ghost projections in there?

3146
01:50:08,480 --> 01:50:09,760
Again, I don't know exactly what it is,

3147
01:50:09,760 --> 01:50:11,720
and I don't know the world of the film enough

3148
01:50:11,720 --> 01:50:12,720
to know what to pull from.

3149
01:50:12,720 --> 01:50:15,600
But if there's that calculation of no voodoo

3150
01:50:15,600 --> 01:50:17,400
or we don't wanna do Facilier,

3151
01:50:17,400 --> 01:50:21,920
why couldn't it be that Mama Odie's magic

3152
01:50:21,920 --> 01:50:23,440
is going haywire?

3153
01:50:23,440 --> 01:50:24,280
Sure.

3154
01:50:26,480 --> 01:50:30,240
You don't need a villain for that to happen.

3155
01:50:30,240 --> 01:50:32,200
I think there's plenty of theme park situations

3156
01:50:32,200 --> 01:50:35,000
of the well-meaning scientist or whatever.

3157
01:50:35,040 --> 01:50:36,840
Uh-oh, I lost control.

3158
01:50:36,840 --> 01:50:40,520
Isn't there a way that it can be chaos in there,

3159
01:50:40,520 --> 01:50:42,160
but it's still her who means well?

3160
01:50:42,160 --> 01:50:45,560
Some lightly sinister song with a big, heavy,

3161
01:50:45,560 --> 01:50:47,600
upright bass part in it,

3162
01:50:47,600 --> 01:50:51,720
just really building up some cool visuals.

3163
01:50:51,720 --> 01:50:54,120
Couldn't it still be Friends on the Other Side

3164
01:50:54,120 --> 01:50:57,840
without a rearranged version that's not, yeah.

3165
01:50:57,840 --> 01:50:58,920
They're halfway there.

3166
01:50:58,920 --> 01:51:00,720
We need to find some musicians.

3167
01:51:00,720 --> 01:51:03,120
Where's the easiest place to find music?

3168
01:51:03,120 --> 01:51:06,800
Oh, you sell your soul to the devil at the crossroads?

3169
01:51:06,800 --> 01:51:07,640
Well, sure.

3170
01:51:07,640 --> 01:51:08,480
Oh, dude.

3171
01:51:08,480 --> 01:51:09,320
Well, that's pretty.

3172
01:51:09,320 --> 01:51:10,960
Well, I would argue for that, but.

3173
01:51:10,960 --> 01:51:12,800
That's probably too.

3174
01:51:12,800 --> 01:51:15,000
Man, Jason, that's a good pitch.

3175
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:16,640
But it's so not current, isn't it?

3176
01:51:16,640 --> 01:51:17,480
It's so like.

3177
01:51:17,480 --> 01:51:18,320
It's not.

3178
01:51:18,320 --> 01:51:19,160
But they would've done it back,

3179
01:51:19,160 --> 01:51:20,640
they would've done it in the 80s, for sure.

3180
01:51:20,640 --> 01:51:23,480
Even in 2009, in that original trailer,

3181
01:51:23,480 --> 01:51:26,440
they show the scene where there's a gag

3182
01:51:26,440 --> 01:51:28,760
where Lewis just wants to play trumpet

3183
01:51:28,760 --> 01:51:30,200
with the real musician,

3184
01:51:30,240 --> 01:51:33,440
and he hops on a riverboat and does a trumpet solo,

3185
01:51:33,440 --> 01:51:35,800
and everyone is horrified looking to him,

3186
01:51:35,800 --> 01:51:38,480
and then it's kind of a classic visual gag,

3187
01:51:38,480 --> 01:51:41,720
cuts to a wide shot of the riverboat,

3188
01:51:41,720 --> 01:51:43,400
he jumps out of the boat,

3189
01:51:43,400 --> 01:51:47,040
and then there's just a barrage of gunfire after him.

3190
01:51:47,040 --> 01:51:47,880
Oh, wow.

3191
01:51:47,880 --> 01:51:51,240
So that's a go-to cartoon gag,

3192
01:51:51,240 --> 01:51:53,480
but it's like, yeah, you're not gonna do that gag

3193
01:51:53,480 --> 01:51:56,120
at 2025, maybe, but.

3194
01:51:56,120 --> 01:51:58,520
Yeah, but there's options.

3195
01:51:58,520 --> 01:51:59,760
Besides, there's options.

3196
01:51:59,800 --> 01:52:01,360
You can't overthink yourself

3197
01:52:01,360 --> 01:52:04,160
out of just the basic way things need to go,

3198
01:52:04,160 --> 01:52:06,120
and it's basically, because I just don't even know,

3199
01:52:06,120 --> 01:52:09,120
in my head, there's no even musical shift there.

3200
01:52:09,120 --> 01:52:09,960
To me, it's just like.

3201
01:52:09,960 --> 01:52:10,780
No, there's not.

3202
01:52:10,780 --> 01:52:13,040
Dun, dun, dun, dun, it's just more of what you,

3203
01:52:13,040 --> 01:52:16,920
and it's a point where you need build and escalation

3204
01:52:16,920 --> 01:52:21,360
for what was a particularly great build and escalation,

3205
01:52:21,360 --> 01:52:24,240
and it's also just the way these things go.

3206
01:52:24,240 --> 01:52:28,720
It's like the, you know, the knots one gets scary.

3207
01:52:28,720 --> 01:52:29,560
Yeah.

3208
01:52:30,240 --> 01:52:34,440
Like, it's just, I, yeah, ah, it's a bar.

3209
01:52:34,440 --> 01:52:36,320
If it feel, if you were listening the whole episode,

3210
01:52:36,320 --> 01:52:37,920
and you're like, ah, it seems like, I don't know,

3211
01:52:37,920 --> 01:52:39,960
is there a full, this is the big issue

3212
01:52:39,960 --> 01:52:41,340
I think we have with it.

3213
01:52:41,340 --> 01:52:42,680
This is it, really.

3214
01:52:42,680 --> 01:52:44,080
Obviously, yeah, little stuff,

3215
01:52:44,080 --> 01:52:46,680
but it feels like this is the thing,

3216
01:52:46,680 --> 01:52:49,320
as a kid, you remember so vividly,

3217
01:52:49,320 --> 01:52:51,480
and again, even just as an adult, you're going up,

3218
01:52:51,480 --> 01:52:53,320
and that's like, this is the whole thing

3219
01:52:53,320 --> 01:52:54,680
you were gonna conquer this,

3220
01:52:54,680 --> 01:52:57,920
and now it just, it doesn't feel totally different,

3221
01:52:57,920 --> 01:52:59,000
and you're not as scared,

3222
01:52:59,040 --> 01:53:00,800
and I guess, if you've seen the exterior now,

3223
01:53:00,800 --> 01:53:02,360
it doesn't look like the mountain is as tall.

3224
01:53:02,360 --> 01:53:04,200
It doesn't look like the drop is as bad.

3225
01:53:04,200 --> 01:53:07,360
So now you're not psychologically going, I'm in this.

3226
01:53:07,360 --> 01:53:10,080
I'm gonna be thrown out of this.

3227
01:53:10,080 --> 01:53:12,720
But it does feel like modern Disney now wanting to scare,

3228
01:53:12,720 --> 01:53:15,400
like it does, Snow White still has some scary stuff,

3229
01:53:15,400 --> 01:53:18,120
but getting rid of Snow White's scary adventure,

3230
01:53:18,120 --> 01:53:19,560
which, again, I think is better.

3231
01:53:19,560 --> 01:53:21,880
I do think that's a plus up from the old ride.

3232
01:53:21,880 --> 01:53:26,880
Yes, and there's a lot of this that I think is a plus up,

3233
01:53:26,940 --> 01:53:28,740
and don't let this confuse.

3234
01:53:29,020 --> 01:53:31,660
That my final review pretty much is,

3235
01:53:31,660 --> 01:53:33,020
I like Tionis by Adventure.

3236
01:53:33,020 --> 01:53:33,860
Yeah, it's good.

3237
01:53:33,860 --> 01:53:34,700
Yeah, it's really good.

3238
01:53:34,700 --> 01:53:35,540
It's really good, yeah.

3239
01:53:35,540 --> 01:53:37,100
But this one air element.

3240
01:53:37,100 --> 01:53:38,860
But it could be like.

3241
01:53:38,860 --> 01:53:39,700
Amazing.

3242
01:53:39,700 --> 01:53:42,820
Yeah, it could be literally unquestionably better

3243
01:53:42,820 --> 01:53:43,660
than Splash Mountain.

3244
01:53:43,660 --> 01:53:44,500
I think if you put so much.

3245
01:53:44,500 --> 01:53:45,620
With this, I just don't know.

3246
01:53:45,620 --> 01:53:48,900
If you put so much work into this,

3247
01:53:48,900 --> 01:53:51,180
not so much work, just like some elements,

3248
01:53:51,180 --> 01:53:52,900
I feel like you'd be like, holy shit.

3249
01:53:52,900 --> 01:53:55,500
If anything had to get topped,

3250
01:53:55,500 --> 01:53:58,700
I think they thought a lot about changing

3251
01:53:59,660 --> 01:54:01,100
out properties, and they thought about a lot of things

3252
01:54:01,100 --> 01:54:03,100
that needed to be thought about,

3253
01:54:03,100 --> 01:54:05,900
and they needed to think about carefully,

3254
01:54:05,900 --> 01:54:07,900
and a lot of it is really victorious.

3255
01:54:07,900 --> 01:54:10,220
But I think they lost sight of,

3256
01:54:10,220 --> 01:54:13,660
also, this is our chance to do Splash Mountain 2.0,

3257
01:54:13,660 --> 01:54:15,580
and to make it way better.

3258
01:54:15,580 --> 01:54:19,660
Or they had ideas, and I bet it's also

3259
01:54:19,660 --> 01:54:21,300
that Imagineers meant well, and then it was like,

3260
01:54:21,300 --> 01:54:22,820
what if there's just some lights and stuff?

3261
01:54:22,820 --> 01:54:23,660
Maybe.

3262
01:54:23,660 --> 01:54:24,820
Because that's all they could afford.

3263
01:54:24,820 --> 01:54:27,660
I am sorry if I came up with an alternate ride

3264
01:54:27,660 --> 01:54:32,060
where Princess Diana needs a band for her party.

3265
01:54:33,020 --> 01:54:36,260
Naveen, who is kind of a cad in the beginning of the movie,

3266
01:54:36,260 --> 01:54:39,460
kind of a scoundrel, sells his soul

3267
01:54:39,460 --> 01:54:41,420
to learn how to play an instrument,

3268
01:54:41,420 --> 01:54:43,900
and then you have to get his soul back.

3269
01:54:43,900 --> 01:54:45,500
That's a little more scary.

3270
01:54:45,500 --> 01:54:47,380
That's a little more intense.

3271
01:54:47,380 --> 01:54:48,220
Pretty good.

3272
01:54:48,220 --> 01:54:49,060
And when it involves him,

3273
01:54:49,060 --> 01:54:52,060
who otherwise is not particularly in the ride.

3274
01:54:52,060 --> 01:54:55,140
I think they put, they were really concerned

3275
01:54:55,140 --> 01:54:58,300
with making the final show scene after the drop

3276
01:54:58,300 --> 01:55:01,180
as big and spectacular as the riverboat

3277
01:55:01,180 --> 01:55:02,460
with all the dancing animals.

3278
01:55:02,460 --> 01:55:04,340
And I think Mission accomplished on that.

3279
01:55:04,340 --> 01:55:05,180
Me too.

3280
01:55:05,180 --> 01:55:06,580
The final scene on this. Great job.

3281
01:55:06,580 --> 01:55:07,660
So much stuff to look at.

3282
01:55:07,660 --> 01:55:09,300
I wish there was a restaurant we could sit

3283
01:55:09,300 --> 01:55:11,500
and watch all that stuff, because it goes by too fast.

3284
01:55:11,500 --> 01:55:12,340
Yeah, really.

3285
01:55:12,340 --> 01:55:13,260
Well, you'll get the train back.

3286
01:55:13,260 --> 01:55:14,100
You'll be able to see it from there.

3287
01:55:14,100 --> 01:55:14,940
That's true.

3288
01:55:14,940 --> 01:55:15,780
You'll get the train back.

3289
01:55:15,780 --> 01:55:16,620
I think there's, isn't there more stuff?

3290
01:55:16,620 --> 01:55:19,100
There's a nice little kind of glowy city at the end.

3291
01:55:19,100 --> 01:55:19,940
Yes, there's stuff.

3292
01:55:19,940 --> 01:55:22,620
Mama Odie, I think it's, yeah, I think it's an improved.

3293
01:55:22,620 --> 01:55:24,660
I think it's, I will say, I think it's better.

3294
01:55:25,220 --> 01:55:28,340
I love the riverboat with America Sings characters,

3295
01:55:28,340 --> 01:55:30,020
but I don't know, it's kind of better.

3296
01:55:30,020 --> 01:55:33,380
Moodier, more depth, well-used screens.

3297
01:55:33,380 --> 01:55:38,380
Easter eggs of Ray and Evangeline are twinkling stars

3298
01:55:38,660 --> 01:55:40,700
at the one night time.

3299
01:55:40,700 --> 01:55:44,140
Ray's the Jim Cummings Firefly who dies in the movie.

3300
01:55:44,140 --> 01:55:46,460
He's always talking about loving Evangeline,

3301
01:55:46,460 --> 01:55:49,100
who's a twinkling star, and then the end of the movie,

3302
01:55:49,100 --> 01:55:50,900
the two stars are next to each other.

3303
01:55:50,900 --> 01:55:51,740
He's not right, that's great.

3304
01:55:51,740 --> 01:55:54,340
And you can see that in a moment towards now.

3305
01:55:54,420 --> 01:55:56,660
I think they put all of the,

3306
01:55:56,660 --> 01:55:58,140
oh, no, they put a lot of effort in all of it,

3307
01:55:58,140 --> 01:56:00,500
but that was the thing, like, we gotta nail that.

3308
01:56:00,500 --> 01:56:02,180
It has to be this big spectacular thing.

3309
01:56:02,180 --> 01:56:04,580
I think everybody was scared that that would somehow get,

3310
01:56:04,580 --> 01:56:06,860
because you're like, modern Disney's not doing

3311
01:56:06,860 --> 01:56:09,620
a ton of animatronics as a finale, but they did it.

3312
01:56:09,620 --> 01:56:10,740
They nailed that.

3313
01:56:10,740 --> 01:56:13,340
With good humans, besides, you know, good humans.

3314
01:56:13,340 --> 01:56:15,940
Good human animatronics, they're new animatronics,

3315
01:56:15,940 --> 01:56:18,060
not the frozen ones from 10 years ago.

3316
01:56:19,020 --> 01:56:19,860
No glowy faces.

3317
01:56:19,860 --> 01:56:23,340
But I do think they didn't think hard enough about the,

3318
01:56:23,340 --> 01:56:24,500
I think they put, they're like, okay, good,

3319
01:56:24,500 --> 01:56:25,580
we gotta nail this.

3320
01:56:25,580 --> 01:56:28,220
This is okay, but the drop is really the fun.

3321
01:56:28,220 --> 01:56:30,340
It's like, not the drop, it's the anticipation of the drop.

3322
01:56:30,340 --> 01:56:32,100
The drop is scarier if you,

3323
01:56:32,100 --> 01:56:35,460
the way that a pre-show affects the ride itself,

3324
01:56:35,460 --> 01:56:38,140
for the build-up to the drop affects the drop.

3325
01:56:38,140 --> 01:56:39,500
Man, I know.

3326
01:56:39,500 --> 01:56:42,260
But it's like a step below because of the fear factor.

3327
01:56:42,260 --> 01:56:44,380
I mean, I think a lot of people agree on this.

3328
01:56:44,380 --> 01:56:45,780
Yes, I don't think that's a controversial opinion.

3329
01:56:45,780 --> 01:56:46,620
It's a swing, but I think...

3330
01:56:46,620 --> 01:56:48,660
We're six months late to this opinion.

3331
01:56:48,660 --> 01:56:50,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah, right, yes.

3332
01:56:50,100 --> 01:56:52,700
And it's also not an opinion that makes me say,

3333
01:56:54,020 --> 01:56:55,420
don't go on the ride.

3334
01:56:55,420 --> 01:56:56,260
No, go on, it's fun.

3335
01:56:56,260 --> 01:56:57,100
Why do they do this?

3336
01:56:57,100 --> 01:57:00,620
They must bring back Mr. Trump, I demand that you.

3337
01:57:00,620 --> 01:57:02,900
I mean, that will happen by the,

3338
01:57:02,900 --> 01:57:05,020
Elon will petition and they will go back to Splash Mountain.

3339
01:57:05,020 --> 01:57:07,580
But I'm not in support of that.

3340
01:57:07,580 --> 01:57:09,900
I like what they did here.

3341
01:57:09,900 --> 01:57:13,700
It's just, you just wish that you could come out raving.

3342
01:57:13,700 --> 01:57:18,700
And it's not a rave, I mean, I went,

3343
01:57:18,940 --> 01:57:22,180
I was like really itching to go on it again.

3344
01:57:22,220 --> 01:57:25,220
And I've kept watching ride throughs, it stuck with me.

3345
01:57:25,220 --> 01:57:27,940
I think about being in the small zone.

3346
01:57:28,860 --> 01:57:33,780
It was like, yeah, the overall tone that you're left with,

3347
01:57:33,780 --> 01:57:36,100
I think is victorious.

3348
01:57:36,100 --> 01:57:38,220
I just, and then thank God the ending

3349
01:57:38,220 --> 01:57:40,260
because that's like the final taste in your mouth.

3350
01:57:40,260 --> 01:57:42,300
Because if it was, if it ended with that drop,

3351
01:57:42,300 --> 01:57:44,940
it'd be like, what did we do?

3352
01:57:44,940 --> 01:57:46,220
And I am looking for, I mean,

3353
01:57:46,220 --> 01:57:47,620
the only reason I've gotten down there

3354
01:57:47,620 --> 01:57:51,100
is because cooler weather makes me so stiff

3355
01:57:51,100 --> 01:57:54,380
and also going to Dizzy Lake with a scooter or a wheelchair

3356
01:57:54,380 --> 01:57:57,740
as I'm sure people know is a lot more work

3357
01:57:57,740 --> 01:58:00,220
and a lot more planning and it just.

3358
01:58:00,220 --> 01:58:04,420
And other stuff coming on too, so.

3359
01:58:04,420 --> 01:58:06,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3360
01:58:06,220 --> 01:58:08,340
And hey, you should get down there.

3361
01:58:08,340 --> 01:58:09,820
We recommend it to you.

3362
01:58:09,820 --> 01:58:11,260
I think you'll be, it is overall.

3363
01:58:11,260 --> 01:58:12,100
I'm sure I'll love it.

3364
01:58:12,100 --> 01:58:14,980
It's just, yeah, boy, you wish, it's a weird,

3365
01:58:14,980 --> 01:58:17,660
but isn't it also the thing that you could have seen,

3366
01:58:18,060 --> 01:58:21,860
if, is there any version where this works?

3367
01:58:21,860 --> 01:58:22,700
What do you mean?

3368
01:58:22,700 --> 01:58:25,820
Where it is not a scary drop, it's a celebratory drop.

3369
01:58:25,820 --> 01:58:29,220
I think that light show has to be like way, way better.

3370
01:58:29,220 --> 01:58:30,980
I think you gotta be, you have to be,

3371
01:58:30,980 --> 01:58:33,780
it has to be psychedelic in that whole.

3372
01:58:33,780 --> 01:58:36,220
If you like, yeah, change the lighting package

3373
01:58:36,220 --> 01:58:37,900
or whatever you call it, like change the lighting,

3374
01:58:37,900 --> 01:58:40,780
change the music, make it louder.

3375
01:58:40,780 --> 01:58:42,580
I think maybe you could change it

3376
01:58:42,580 --> 01:58:46,700
to have the frog scenes like spookier.

3377
01:58:47,740 --> 01:58:50,540
It wouldn't be, it wouldn't be as successful

3378
01:58:50,540 --> 01:58:51,700
as making that lift so scary.

3379
01:58:51,700 --> 01:58:52,540
I feel like it needs to be scary, but.

3380
01:58:52,540 --> 01:58:53,820
Wait, something should try to get you.

3381
01:58:53,820 --> 01:58:55,940
Something, like now you're, that's, yes.

3382
01:58:55,940 --> 01:58:58,540
All you do, you get small and then you have fun

3383
01:58:58,540 --> 01:59:01,180
with frogs playing leaf drums,

3384
01:59:01,180 --> 01:59:03,380
but there's never anything where a big animal

3385
01:59:03,380 --> 01:59:04,780
now can eat you.

3386
01:59:04,780 --> 01:59:05,700
That would be cool. Right.

3387
01:59:05,700 --> 01:59:06,940
Cause at the very least you could change,

3388
01:59:06,940 --> 01:59:08,940
that could be a tonal change there and then.

3389
01:59:08,940 --> 01:59:11,020
Yes, and then it becomes like, I gotta save you.

3390
01:59:11,020 --> 01:59:13,180
There's this urgency to Mama Odie.

3391
01:59:13,180 --> 01:59:15,580
Yeah, but even like.

3392
01:59:15,580 --> 01:59:17,540
Even if it's just like, oh, he's old,

3393
01:59:18,380 --> 01:59:20,260
he's blind, he's a bat, sorry about that.

3394
01:59:21,380 --> 01:59:23,620
Like the big animal tries to get you

3395
01:59:23,620 --> 01:59:25,020
and then someone goes like. Oh, sure.

3396
01:59:25,020 --> 01:59:25,860
Oh, he's a sweetheart. Oh, you're saying

3397
01:59:25,860 --> 01:59:26,700
getting rid of the danger.

3398
01:59:26,700 --> 01:59:31,020
He just spooked him, like he didn't know what you were.

3399
01:59:31,020 --> 01:59:31,860
That's interesting.

3400
01:59:31,860 --> 01:59:33,220
Even like just like a fun,

3401
01:59:33,220 --> 01:59:35,300
like maybe it's like completely pitch black

3402
01:59:35,300 --> 01:59:37,860
and like they do something like screens opening up

3403
01:59:37,860 --> 01:59:41,100
and like just a little bit of like dark,

3404
01:59:41,100 --> 01:59:44,020
some element that's still like, oh my gosh, fun,

3405
01:59:44,020 --> 01:59:45,860
I'm so excited to do it, but.

3406
01:59:45,860 --> 01:59:49,180
If you compare it to, think about this comparison.

3407
01:59:49,180 --> 01:59:51,180
Splash Mountain to Tiana, the drop,

3408
01:59:51,180 --> 01:59:55,020
versus Jurassic Park to Jurassic World, the drop,

3409
01:59:55,020 --> 01:59:58,780
where they added dinosaurs, there's more dinosaurs,

3410
01:59:58,780 --> 02:00:02,580
it's scarier now and now this is like,

3411
02:00:02,580 --> 02:00:07,580
get ready, get your party streamers out.

3412
02:00:07,660 --> 02:00:10,460
Well, that's a thing where you,

3413
02:00:10,460 --> 02:00:12,780
like with Jurassic World's drop,

3414
02:00:12,780 --> 02:00:14,900
you can make the argument that that whole section

3415
02:00:14,900 --> 02:00:17,220
is a little less scary because it's not

3416
02:00:17,220 --> 02:00:20,300
in the dark anymore, but there's a ton of new robots.

3417
02:00:20,300 --> 02:00:22,580
There's two giant dinosaurs.

3418
02:00:22,580 --> 02:00:24,260
T-Rex still comes out of the wall.

3419
02:00:24,260 --> 02:00:26,540
And Raptor heads, Raptor ain't nothing.

3420
02:00:26,540 --> 02:00:27,460
And Raptor, right, yes.

3421
02:00:27,460 --> 02:00:29,620
So you could at least argue like, well,

3422
02:00:29,620 --> 02:00:31,940
maybe you don't get that complete crazy jump scare

3423
02:00:31,940 --> 02:00:34,060
of T-Rex at the end of the ride,

3424
02:00:34,060 --> 02:00:36,740
but there's so much cool stuff to see on Jurassic World

3425
02:00:36,740 --> 02:00:39,900
that at least it's different and better in a different way.

3426
02:00:39,900 --> 02:00:42,060
Did something surprise you or something?

3427
02:00:42,060 --> 02:00:42,900
I hear it.

3428
02:00:42,980 --> 02:00:45,100
Here's something that we haven't mentioned.

3429
02:00:45,100 --> 02:00:48,980
On the lift hill, the fireflies, the projection,

3430
02:00:48,980 --> 02:00:50,980
the footage of the fireflies going by

3431
02:00:50,980 --> 02:00:52,980
and they get kind of warped in the glass bottle.

3432
02:00:52,980 --> 02:00:53,820
Oh yeah.

3433
02:00:53,820 --> 02:00:56,220
Cover the tunnel in fireflies.

3434
02:00:56,220 --> 02:00:58,060
Sure, that's really fun.

3435
02:00:58,060 --> 02:01:03,060
Or make it like it's like this really magical lift hill.

3436
02:01:03,780 --> 02:01:04,620
Yeah.

3437
02:01:04,620 --> 02:01:06,140
Like there's just like this weird sereneness

3438
02:01:06,140 --> 02:01:09,100
or like nice magic quality to it.

3439
02:01:09,100 --> 02:01:13,260
Like the lift hill on the Maelstrom,

3440
02:01:13,260 --> 02:01:16,300
where you're hypnotized by that light

3441
02:01:16,300 --> 02:01:18,100
and that scary face and stuff.

3442
02:01:18,100 --> 02:01:18,940
Yeah.

3443
02:01:18,940 --> 02:01:19,780
That's like, I mean, it's scary,

3444
02:01:19,780 --> 02:01:22,140
but there's an odd serenity, like you're just kind of like,

3445
02:01:22,140 --> 02:01:23,420
yeah, yeah, it's hypnotic.

3446
02:01:23,420 --> 02:01:24,620
Right, if you could do that tone.

3447
02:01:24,620 --> 02:01:26,020
That's what I thought from the concept art

3448
02:01:26,020 --> 02:01:27,100
that that light was gonna be,

3449
02:01:27,100 --> 02:01:28,500
that it would just kind of like,

3450
02:01:28,500 --> 02:01:30,060
you know, there'd be like a mini,

3451
02:01:31,100 --> 02:01:33,180
like the avalanche thing in Universal,

3452
02:01:33,180 --> 02:01:34,020
you know what I mean?

3453
02:01:34,020 --> 02:01:34,860
Oh yeah, maybe.

3454
02:01:34,860 --> 02:01:35,700
Like you're just caught in this tunnel

3455
02:01:35,700 --> 02:01:37,700
and they're just blasting me with stuff.

3456
02:01:37,700 --> 02:01:39,620
What if there was mist at the end or something?

3457
02:01:39,620 --> 02:01:42,140
So then maybe you don't know until you go through that.

3458
02:01:42,140 --> 02:01:44,180
Oh my God, now I'm peering down to,

3459
02:01:44,180 --> 02:01:47,340
I'm looking at the edge of a gosh darn salt mine.

3460
02:01:47,340 --> 02:01:48,380
Sure, yeah.

3461
02:01:48,380 --> 02:01:53,300
Well, the other thing is operationally,

3462
02:01:53,300 --> 02:01:55,580
the way Disney sometimes operates,

3463
02:01:55,580 --> 02:01:57,260
water rides nowadays,

3464
02:01:57,260 --> 02:02:00,580
those logs are going up nearly back to back.

3465
02:02:00,580 --> 02:02:03,180
They're spaced out enough to be safe,

3466
02:02:03,180 --> 02:02:06,660
but you see all of them, which is fine,

3467
02:02:06,660 --> 02:02:08,580
but you're starting and you're stopping,

3468
02:02:08,580 --> 02:02:10,060
you're heart breaking.

3469
02:02:10,060 --> 02:02:13,820
This is worse on Pirates of the Caribbean, awful at this.

3470
02:02:13,820 --> 02:02:14,740
Yeah.

3471
02:02:14,740 --> 02:02:17,260
But it's like, well that takes away a little

3472
02:02:17,260 --> 02:02:20,620
of whatever story they're trying to tell it that little too.

3473
02:02:20,620 --> 02:02:23,700
Yeah, yeah, it decreases like tension and stuff.

3474
02:02:23,700 --> 02:02:25,300
Why don't they use the salt?

3475
02:02:25,300 --> 02:02:29,140
There's, oh, there's a darn salt avalanche.

3476
02:02:29,140 --> 02:02:32,140
The salt's shaking everywhere.

3477
02:02:32,140 --> 02:02:32,980
We gotta get you out of here.

3478
02:02:32,980 --> 02:02:36,220
Keep your tongue in your mouth unless you love salt.

3479
02:02:36,860 --> 02:02:37,700
Yeah.

3480
02:02:37,700 --> 02:02:40,420
Let's use, I don't think they even say salt mine.

3481
02:02:40,420 --> 02:02:41,260
I don't think so, yeah.

3482
02:02:41,260 --> 02:02:43,820
Why, the answer is salt avalanche.

3483
02:02:43,820 --> 02:02:44,660
Yeah, I think so.

3484
02:02:44,660 --> 02:02:47,620
I thought it was just background information.

3485
02:02:47,620 --> 02:02:49,780
I didn't realize that's what the top of this

3486
02:02:49,780 --> 02:02:51,660
was supposed to be, the salt dome.

3487
02:02:51,660 --> 02:02:54,780
I guess so, yeah, you're at the peak of the salt dome.

3488
02:02:54,780 --> 02:02:56,180
Imagine what could go,

3489
02:02:56,180 --> 02:02:58,460
if you were a miner in a salt dome,

3490
02:02:58,460 --> 02:03:00,260
you're trying to carve out that tunnel,

3491
02:03:00,260 --> 02:03:03,300
the likelihood of salt avalanche is extremely strong.

3492
02:03:03,300 --> 02:03:04,660
Extremely strong.

3493
02:03:04,780 --> 02:03:07,980
And then you get in your eyes, you can't see it.

3494
02:03:07,980 --> 02:03:10,580
There should be a thin mist that Mama Odie tells you

3495
02:03:10,580 --> 02:03:14,180
is actually micro salt, so watch your eyes.

3496
02:03:14,180 --> 02:03:15,060
Yeah, be careful.

3497
02:03:15,060 --> 02:03:19,620
What do you guys think the abbreviation of this

3498
02:03:19,620 --> 02:03:21,380
will be by guest?

3499
02:03:21,380 --> 02:03:22,740
Because Splash Mountain, it's like,

3500
02:03:22,740 --> 02:03:23,820
you wanna go in Splash?

3501
02:03:23,820 --> 02:03:25,020
Do you wanna go in Splash Mountain?

3502
02:03:25,020 --> 02:03:25,860
Tiana?

3503
02:03:25,860 --> 02:03:29,260
Will people just, yeah, I feel like it's called Tiana's.

3504
02:03:29,260 --> 02:03:31,780
Or it'll be called Splash Mountain.

3505
02:03:31,780 --> 02:03:33,500
Or that, yeah, that's what I was getting at.

3506
02:03:33,540 --> 02:03:35,300
Are people just gonna say Tiana's

3507
02:03:35,300 --> 02:03:37,460
or just keep saying Splash Mountain?

3508
02:03:37,460 --> 02:03:40,700
I don't think I'm gonna overhear a lot of families go like,

3509
02:03:40,700 --> 02:03:43,620
do you wanna go down and ride Tiana's Bayou adventure?

3510
02:03:43,620 --> 02:03:46,260
It's just one of those long, modern names.

3511
02:03:46,260 --> 02:03:49,140
But I had a family out here visiting once

3512
02:03:49,140 --> 02:03:53,980
and I said, oh, we're at Tiana's palace.

3513
02:03:53,980 --> 02:03:57,940
And they're like, listen, everywhere I look,

3514
02:03:57,940 --> 02:04:00,300
there are signs that say Tiana's.

3515
02:04:00,300 --> 02:04:02,300
I need you to be more specific.

3516
02:04:03,140 --> 02:04:05,660
Because at the time, it was still under construction

3517
02:04:05,660 --> 02:04:07,900
and they were coming from Galaxy's Edge.

3518
02:04:08,860 --> 02:04:10,660
And so there were signs for it everywhere.

3519
02:04:10,660 --> 02:04:13,860
And I'm like, oh, I did not think about this.

3520
02:04:13,860 --> 02:04:18,660
Well, I mean, people, if they had nailed the ending

3521
02:04:18,660 --> 02:04:20,540
and done the right ending, everybody would say,

3522
02:04:20,540 --> 02:04:22,260
so what do you, let's see, let's do Haunted Mansion

3523
02:04:22,260 --> 02:04:24,260
and then you wanna hit Salt Avalanche?

3524
02:04:24,260 --> 02:04:27,780
Yeah.

3525
02:04:27,780 --> 02:04:29,620
They just couldn't get the Tabasco.

3526
02:04:29,620 --> 02:04:31,980
They tried to get the Tabasco license

3527
02:04:32,620 --> 02:04:33,460
and they just couldn't.

3528
02:04:33,460 --> 02:04:35,300
Tabasco folks don't play ball.

3529
02:04:35,300 --> 02:04:36,140
They didn't play ball.

3530
02:04:36,140 --> 02:04:36,980
Yeah.

3531
02:04:36,980 --> 02:04:37,820
Yeah.

3532
02:04:37,820 --> 02:04:39,420
You guys ever thought about that Nabisco

3533
02:04:39,420 --> 02:04:42,460
is a shortening of, that that's like a,

3534
02:04:42,460 --> 02:04:44,140
I think, am I right about that?

3535
02:04:44,140 --> 02:04:44,980
I don't know, I don't know that.

3536
02:04:44,980 --> 02:04:46,420
I say it just because it's a similar word.

3537
02:04:46,420 --> 02:04:51,260
Nabisco is, means National Biscuit Company.

3538
02:04:51,260 --> 02:04:52,100
Biscuit Company, yeah.

3539
02:04:52,100 --> 02:04:52,940
I didn't realize.

3540
02:04:52,940 --> 02:04:54,940
I've thought about Nabisco my whole life.

3541
02:04:54,940 --> 02:04:58,260
I've never, my buddy Andy Maxwell I'm working with

3542
02:04:58,260 --> 02:04:59,380
put a light on that.

3543
02:04:59,380 --> 02:05:01,420
I was like, I've never thought about,

3544
02:05:01,780 --> 02:05:02,860
Nabisco is just a word to me.

3545
02:05:02,860 --> 02:05:04,100
So when you've been saying Tabasco,

3546
02:05:04,100 --> 02:05:06,220
I keep, I've been tripping out like,

3547
02:05:06,220 --> 02:05:08,380
oh yeah, what's Tabasco short for again?

3548
02:05:08,380 --> 02:05:10,220
Nothing, it's not that, it's Nabisco.

3549
02:05:10,220 --> 02:05:11,060
Wow.

3550
02:05:11,060 --> 02:05:11,900
Yeah.

3551
02:05:11,900 --> 02:05:12,740
File that away.

3552
02:05:12,740 --> 02:05:15,740
I think that shows up in one of my favorite TV shows,

3553
02:05:15,740 --> 02:05:18,140
The Food That Built America,

3554
02:05:18,140 --> 02:05:21,780
with my favorite non-union actor performances

3555
02:05:21,780 --> 02:05:23,660
of like Marjorie Post going,

3556
02:05:23,660 --> 02:05:26,260
I will crush the Kellogg's brothers.

3557
02:05:26,260 --> 02:05:27,660
Do they do, are there little scenes in that show?

3558
02:05:27,660 --> 02:05:30,780
Oh, there's little scenes of like Colonel Sanders

3559
02:05:30,780 --> 02:05:35,100
getting his shotgun to go like shoot a rival.

3560
02:05:36,540 --> 02:05:38,300
A rival chicken operator.

3561
02:05:38,300 --> 02:05:39,860
And they're done like real cheap?

3562
02:05:39,860 --> 02:05:42,060
I, they're very heightened.

3563
02:05:42,060 --> 02:05:44,140
At some point they start to get,

3564
02:05:44,140 --> 02:05:46,780
at some point like in the later seasons,

3565
02:05:46,780 --> 02:05:49,700
I saw an episode where Campbell Scott is credited.

3566
02:05:49,700 --> 02:05:52,260
I'm like, oh, I guess they started ponying up.

3567
02:05:52,260 --> 02:05:53,300
Oh, wow.

3568
02:05:53,300 --> 02:05:54,140
Buddy.

3569
02:05:54,140 --> 02:05:56,980
So it was like, it's a non-comedic drunk history.

3570
02:05:56,980 --> 02:06:00,340
It's, yeah, that is exactly what's going on.

3571
02:06:00,820 --> 02:06:01,660
Wow, interesting.

3572
02:06:01,660 --> 02:06:05,260
It's very like, it's very melodramatic,

3573
02:06:05,260 --> 02:06:10,260
but it's like Campbell's canned soup is never gonna work.

3574
02:06:10,380 --> 02:06:11,660
Wow, that sounds good.

3575
02:06:11,660 --> 02:06:12,500
It is good.

3576
02:06:12,500 --> 02:06:13,340
It's great.

3577
02:06:13,340 --> 02:06:14,500
It's great hotel TV.

3578
02:06:14,500 --> 02:06:16,460
It's perfect hotel TV.

3579
02:06:16,460 --> 02:06:18,780
Mr. Hines, that fool.

3580
02:06:18,780 --> 02:06:21,260
You think he could make a ketchup, a cat soup?

3581
02:06:21,260 --> 02:06:22,100
Is that?

3582
02:06:22,100 --> 02:06:23,580
That would take over the,

3583
02:06:23,580 --> 02:06:25,780
that would capture the imagination of the nation?

3584
02:06:25,780 --> 02:06:28,900
The Hines and Hershey episodes are really intense.

3585
02:06:28,900 --> 02:06:30,660
Is that your birthday shot this year?

3586
02:06:30,660 --> 02:06:33,060
Oh, I didn't even think about that.

3587
02:06:33,060 --> 02:06:34,180
That's an idea.

3588
02:06:34,180 --> 02:06:35,020
You got time to think about it.

3589
02:06:35,020 --> 02:06:36,020
Could be.

3590
02:06:36,020 --> 02:06:37,500
Well, this has been a useful episode.

3591
02:06:37,500 --> 02:06:38,420
We've learned a lot of things.

3592
02:06:38,420 --> 02:06:39,260
Oh, yeah.

3593
02:06:39,260 --> 02:06:40,940
We came up with a good episode idea.

3594
02:06:40,940 --> 02:06:44,100
Any like parting, oh, look, we can't go out,

3595
02:06:44,100 --> 02:06:47,980
I don't think without bringing up the,

3596
02:06:47,980 --> 02:06:50,180
this is, you do have to take points away

3597
02:06:50,180 --> 02:06:54,020
from the spate of broken animatronic,

3598
02:06:54,020 --> 02:06:56,780
that how often this thing seemingly shuts down

3599
02:06:56,780 --> 02:06:58,220
and how often the animatronic,

3600
02:06:58,220 --> 02:07:00,500
I think maybe both times I went on it

3601
02:07:00,500 --> 02:07:01,900
on the day that I went,

3602
02:07:01,900 --> 02:07:06,340
Tiana was frozen as if seeing a ghost.

3603
02:07:06,340 --> 02:07:09,660
She heard the centerpiece of a big ruckus celebration

3604
02:07:09,660 --> 02:07:10,540
at the end.

3605
02:07:10,540 --> 02:07:13,940
Tiana was in a mode that I'm gonna call hostage Tiana.

3606
02:07:13,940 --> 02:07:16,460
It's so creepy the way she is perfectly still

3607
02:07:16,460 --> 02:07:21,260
and just eyes moving to where you wanna ask, are you okay?

3608
02:07:21,260 --> 02:07:25,460
Is there a pistol trained on you that we can't see?

3609
02:07:25,460 --> 02:07:27,260
There's no red dot on your forehead,

3610
02:07:27,260 --> 02:07:29,260
but I'm worried about you, Tiana.

3611
02:07:29,260 --> 02:07:30,780
No, she just laid down roots

3612
02:07:30,780 --> 02:07:32,580
in the most haunted city in America.

3613
02:07:32,580 --> 02:07:33,900
Of course she's so ghost.

3614
02:07:33,900 --> 02:07:35,220
She's scared, yeah.

3615
02:07:35,220 --> 02:07:37,740
She's trying to put on a brave face and perform,

3616
02:07:37,740 --> 02:07:41,060
but she's looking at a Madison Square Garden

3617
02:07:41,060 --> 02:07:43,060
size audience of ghosts.

3618
02:07:43,060 --> 02:07:45,660
She's like stealing herself where she's like,

3619
02:07:45,660 --> 02:07:47,820
I'm gonna have to take out Marjorie Post,

3620
02:07:47,820 --> 02:07:51,580
I'm gonna have to take out Hines, Campbell, Hershey,

3621
02:07:51,580 --> 02:07:52,980
all these fuckers.

3622
02:07:52,980 --> 02:07:54,020
Yeah, that's right.

3623
02:07:54,020 --> 02:07:54,980
Is that where Tiana,

3624
02:07:55,660 --> 02:07:58,220
in the real Tiana timeline,

3625
02:07:58,220 --> 02:08:01,100
does she go from employee-owned co-op fun

3626
02:08:01,100 --> 02:08:05,540
to disgusting international corporation

3627
02:08:05,540 --> 02:08:07,820
that crushes the competition?

3628
02:08:07,820 --> 02:08:10,460
The food hasn't tasted good for years.

3629
02:08:10,460 --> 02:08:11,820
Tiana's sold out hard.

3630
02:08:11,820 --> 02:08:16,820
Oh no, she sold, Tiana's food is owned by BlackRock now.

3631
02:08:16,940 --> 02:08:18,580
It's owned by private equity.

3632
02:08:18,580 --> 02:08:21,020
Oh no, like Jersey Mike's.

3633
02:08:21,020 --> 02:08:23,620
Or it's not her, it's like terrible,

3634
02:08:23,620 --> 02:08:25,500
it's that fucking drummer kid.

3635
02:08:25,500 --> 02:08:27,660
The drummer kid stops fucking around on the drums

3636
02:08:27,660 --> 02:08:30,020
and decides to make some goddamn money,

3637
02:08:30,020 --> 02:08:32,100
and he destroys the spirit

3638
02:08:32,100 --> 02:08:34,700
that made Tiana's food what it was.

3639
02:08:34,700 --> 02:08:38,140
Here's one I learned from the show.

3640
02:08:38,140 --> 02:08:40,340
One of the Post estates,

3641
02:08:40,340 --> 02:08:43,180
a little property called Mar-a-Lago.

3642
02:08:43,180 --> 02:08:44,020
Really?

3643
02:08:44,020 --> 02:08:44,860
Yeah.

3644
02:08:44,860 --> 02:08:46,260
Wait, what do you mean Post estate?

3645
02:08:46,260 --> 02:08:47,260
The Post family owned it?

3646
02:08:47,260 --> 02:08:49,060
The Post family owned it, I believe.

3647
02:08:49,060 --> 02:08:49,900
Before Trump.

3648
02:08:49,900 --> 02:08:52,100
Initially, yeah, maybe built it.

3649
02:08:52,100 --> 02:08:52,980
Interesting.

3650
02:08:53,060 --> 02:08:53,900
Wow, wow.

3651
02:08:53,900 --> 02:08:54,900
Well, that'll be your birthday show.

3652
02:08:54,900 --> 02:08:57,140
So the Post owned it, yeah, Mar-a-Lago,

3653
02:08:57,140 --> 02:08:58,900
just as a place, yeah.

3654
02:08:58,900 --> 02:09:01,420
Oh, some of that bad food.

3655
02:09:01,420 --> 02:09:03,980
Now he's throwing bad food parties.

3656
02:09:03,980 --> 02:09:05,420
It's not creating Carter anymore.

3657
02:09:05,420 --> 02:09:08,420
You see pictures of the food at Mar-a-Lago, it's nasty.

3658
02:09:08,420 --> 02:09:10,260
I haven't seen pictures of the food at Mar-a-Lago.

3659
02:09:10,260 --> 02:09:11,100
Oh, it's bad.

3660
02:09:11,100 --> 02:09:11,940
That's it.

3661
02:09:11,940 --> 02:09:12,780
Well, I'll have to look into it.

3662
02:09:12,780 --> 02:09:15,380
Yeah, yeah, no, it's the fartiest building in America.

3663
02:09:15,380 --> 02:09:18,380
Well, that's true, that's no doubt about that.

3664
02:09:18,380 --> 02:09:20,220
Bowen will be really apologetic.

3665
02:09:20,220 --> 02:09:22,220
No, we're not taking sides.

3666
02:09:22,220 --> 02:09:24,500
We are not saying we endorse the president

3667
02:09:24,500 --> 02:09:25,340
and what he's doing.

3668
02:09:25,340 --> 02:09:27,700
We are talking about it as a place, okay?

3669
02:09:27,700 --> 02:09:29,300
It is a building, is it not?

3670
02:09:29,300 --> 02:09:31,420
Buildings aren't politicized, are they?

3671
02:09:31,420 --> 02:09:34,100
We're talking about the railings, okay?

3672
02:09:34,100 --> 02:09:36,860
Well, today was the start of our move to the right,

3673
02:09:36,860 --> 02:09:38,340
our soft move to the right,

3674
02:09:38,340 --> 02:09:41,020
so because of the lift-till criticism.

3675
02:09:41,020 --> 02:09:43,060
But no, yeah, we'll eventually get to the

3676
02:09:43,060 --> 02:09:43,900
defending our Mar-a-Lago episode.

3677
02:09:43,900 --> 02:09:46,500
I guess the ride eviscerates.

3678
02:09:46,500 --> 02:09:47,940
You know what I was gonna say about the animatronics though?

3679
02:09:47,940 --> 02:09:50,740
I'm heartened by the,

3680
02:09:51,220 --> 02:09:52,580
obviously this is still a new ride,

3681
02:09:52,580 --> 02:09:55,900
so there's a lot of problems usually with big new rides.

3682
02:09:55,900 --> 02:09:59,380
But the cannon's working on Rise of the Resistance,

3683
02:09:59,380 --> 02:10:02,940
and then did you see that today or something

3684
02:10:02,940 --> 02:10:05,500
that was posted that there's a water leak effect

3685
02:10:05,500 --> 02:10:07,780
that's been restored on the Tower of Terror

3686
02:10:07,780 --> 02:10:10,860
in Hollywood Studios after 25 years.

3687
02:10:10,860 --> 02:10:12,900
There's a water dripping effect.

3688
02:10:12,900 --> 02:10:14,260
I don't even know about this,

3689
02:10:14,260 --> 02:10:15,940
I don't know if you can see that from here,

3690
02:10:15,940 --> 02:10:17,620
but there's this water dripping effect

3691
02:10:17,620 --> 02:10:18,540
that happens in the queue

3692
02:10:18,540 --> 02:10:20,780
that's been restored after 25 years.

3693
02:10:20,780 --> 02:10:21,620
Wow.

3694
02:10:21,620 --> 02:10:23,740
So I'm like, what's going on?

3695
02:10:23,740 --> 02:10:24,820
What is this?

3696
02:10:24,820 --> 02:10:26,220
Who's giving budgets and stuff?

3697
02:10:26,220 --> 02:10:28,860
So I'm like, I wonder if things are gonna get fixed,

3698
02:10:28,860 --> 02:10:31,140
and maybe there's a renewed interest

3699
02:10:31,140 --> 02:10:33,660
in just keeping everything working,

3700
02:10:33,660 --> 02:10:34,900
and we'll see, I don't know.

3701
02:10:34,900 --> 02:10:35,740
Interesting.

3702
02:10:35,740 --> 02:10:37,020
I did see someone saying,

3703
02:10:37,020 --> 02:10:39,060
because Epcot, the new Epcot,

3704
02:10:39,060 --> 02:10:42,500
a lot of the lighting's been plagued with issues,

3705
02:10:42,500 --> 02:10:43,980
and someone's like, oh yeah,

3706
02:10:43,980 --> 02:10:46,220
any time something like that gets fixed,

3707
02:10:46,220 --> 02:10:48,060
it's like one guy.

3708
02:10:48,620 --> 02:10:51,740
Yes, there's probably what you would think.

3709
02:10:51,740 --> 02:10:53,980
They probably keep firing the guy.

3710
02:10:53,980 --> 02:10:54,820
You know what?

3711
02:10:54,820 --> 02:10:56,860
There's also, I think, I forget who to put this,

3712
02:10:56,860 --> 02:10:59,380
there's the people that look through the patents

3713
02:10:59,380 --> 02:11:01,780
or permits and stuff.

3714
02:11:01,780 --> 02:11:03,300
I think there's some rumor

3715
02:11:03,300 --> 02:11:06,740
that they're gonna fix the moving rooms in Indiana Jones

3716
02:11:06,740 --> 02:11:08,140
because of some sort of permit.

3717
02:11:08,140 --> 02:11:09,340
Whoa.

3718
02:11:09,340 --> 02:11:11,260
Like those things will move again.

3719
02:11:11,260 --> 02:11:14,740
So stuff like that, maybe there's a big push

3720
02:11:14,740 --> 02:11:16,660
to get everything working, I hope.

3721
02:11:16,660 --> 02:11:19,380
There's so little, but there's so big.

3722
02:11:19,380 --> 02:11:22,380
They really, these things really do add up,

3723
02:11:22,380 --> 02:11:24,020
and when you have parks that are,

3724
02:11:26,180 --> 02:11:28,260
there's a long list of things like this.

3725
02:11:28,260 --> 02:11:29,100
Yeah.

3726
02:11:29,100 --> 02:11:31,540
I will say they should put at the top of the list

3727
02:11:31,540 --> 02:11:35,340
forever fixing the animatronic of the star

3728
02:11:35,340 --> 02:11:36,180
of their new ride.

3729
02:11:36,180 --> 02:11:38,060
I would agree that should be a priority.

3730
02:11:38,060 --> 02:11:41,180
I mean, I love my drips, but God,

3731
02:11:41,180 --> 02:11:42,940
if there's any drips in Disneyland

3732
02:11:42,940 --> 02:11:44,140
that we've been missing out on,

3733
02:11:44,140 --> 02:11:44,980
let's fix those drips.

3734
02:11:44,980 --> 02:11:45,820
Fake drip final forms.

3735
02:11:45,820 --> 02:11:46,660
Fake drips.

3736
02:11:46,660 --> 02:11:47,500
Fake drips.

3737
02:11:47,500 --> 02:11:49,340
I don't know, I don't know if this was.

3738
02:11:49,340 --> 02:11:50,180
You're lucky if you get the four,

3739
02:11:50,180 --> 02:11:51,420
I feel like, with that one.

3740
02:11:51,420 --> 02:11:52,580
I don't know if this was a rumor

3741
02:11:52,580 --> 02:11:54,140
or I don't remember my source here,

3742
02:11:54,140 --> 02:11:57,420
but I'll just say it, that some of the motions,

3743
02:11:57,420 --> 02:12:00,260
like it's hard because the logs themselves

3744
02:12:00,260 --> 02:12:02,700
trigger some of the motions on the robots,

3745
02:12:02,700 --> 02:12:05,380
so that's different than just having everything

3746
02:12:05,380 --> 02:12:09,100
kind of moving, and that has been a problem, maybe,

3747
02:12:09,100 --> 02:12:09,940
as far as running these.

3748
02:12:09,940 --> 02:12:12,980
So it's fixing the sensors more than it's fixing.

3749
02:12:12,980 --> 02:12:15,140
Certain sensors, now maybe she's just frozen

3750
02:12:15,740 --> 02:12:17,100
but it's not a sensor issue, I don't know.

3751
02:12:17,100 --> 02:12:19,500
But I'm just saying that maybe it's set up differently

3752
02:12:19,500 --> 02:12:22,540
because everything's like lit the same on,

3753
02:12:22,540 --> 02:12:24,180
or was lit the same on Splash Mountain,

3754
02:12:24,180 --> 02:12:26,300
so it just can be running indefinitely

3755
02:12:26,300 --> 02:12:29,940
versus this has set show scenes

3756
02:12:29,940 --> 02:12:32,540
that have to be triggered when a log goes by.

3757
02:12:32,540 --> 02:12:34,580
I don't know if that's true or not, but again.

3758
02:12:34,580 --> 02:12:36,100
So we gotta fix these sensors,

3759
02:12:36,100 --> 02:12:38,540
and if it is, in fact, ghosts,

3760
02:12:38,540 --> 02:12:40,300
we gotta get a priest in there.

3761
02:12:40,300 --> 02:12:42,460
You might have to have a priest in there, yeah.

3762
02:12:42,540 --> 02:12:46,140
Get Lana Del Rey's new husband, the fanboat captain.

3763
02:12:46,140 --> 02:12:48,780
Well Jason, you and I have not discussed this off the air,

3764
02:12:48,780 --> 02:12:50,700
but we both know about the fanboat captain

3765
02:12:50,700 --> 02:12:52,140
that's now married to Lana Del Rey.

3766
02:12:52,140 --> 02:12:54,820
We both know about Lana Del Rey's new

3767
02:12:54,820 --> 02:12:55,660
fanboat captain.

3768
02:12:55,660 --> 02:12:58,260
I did not choose marrying this gentleman at first,

3769
02:12:58,260 --> 02:12:59,980
but then they did get married.

3770
02:12:59,980 --> 02:13:01,260
Yes, so.

3771
02:13:01,260 --> 02:13:02,860
Fanboat captain where?

3772
02:13:02,860 --> 02:13:04,540
Can we take his fanboat?

3773
02:13:04,540 --> 02:13:06,220
Oh, well hopefully she upgrades,

3774
02:13:06,220 --> 02:13:08,660
I mean maybe he likes doing it so he's kept the job,

3775
02:13:08,660 --> 02:13:11,420
but I feel like Lana would be able to upgrade his lifestyle.

3776
02:13:11,420 --> 02:13:12,820
Louisiana.

3777
02:13:12,820 --> 02:13:14,100
Well how about it?

3778
02:13:14,100 --> 02:13:15,220
What?

3779
02:13:15,220 --> 02:13:16,060
Jeff, forget his name.

3780
02:13:16,060 --> 02:13:17,980
Jeffrey Dufresne.

3781
02:13:17,980 --> 02:13:21,380
By Jeffrey Dufresne runs the fanboats around here.

3782
02:13:21,380 --> 02:13:22,420
Yeah.

3783
02:13:22,420 --> 02:13:24,820
Jeffrey Del Rey now, I think he would take her name.

3784
02:13:24,820 --> 02:13:27,260
You're talking about Mr. Del Rey?

3785
02:13:27,260 --> 02:13:29,980
Well to me, he'll always be Jeffrey Dufresne.

3786
02:13:29,980 --> 02:13:32,100
To appeal to the Trump White House,

3787
02:13:32,100 --> 02:13:36,340
Disney has added a Jeffrey Dufresne animatronic.

3788
02:13:36,340 --> 02:13:37,460
Deanna's value adventure.

3789
02:13:37,460 --> 02:13:38,700
Yeah, this value adventure.

3790
02:13:38,700 --> 02:13:40,740
This is relate, we're kind of on topic

3791
02:13:40,820 --> 02:13:43,340
because it's Louisiana and he is a singer

3792
02:13:43,340 --> 02:13:47,620
and alligator tour guide first met back in 2019.

3793
02:13:47,620 --> 02:13:50,740
You know, for all of the weird husbands and shit

3794
02:13:50,740 --> 02:13:52,700
that you guys get obsessed with.

3795
02:13:52,700 --> 02:13:53,540
We love husbands.

3796
02:13:53,540 --> 02:13:56,180
That I can't follow you on, I do like fanboats.

3797
02:13:56,180 --> 02:13:59,500
I do like, I guess airboat is what I,

3798
02:13:59,500 --> 02:14:01,380
fanboat, is a fanboat an airboat?

3799
02:14:01,380 --> 02:14:05,140
Mainly, you know, if I was shaky here,

3800
02:14:05,140 --> 02:14:07,620
you had me at alligator tour.

3801
02:14:07,980 --> 02:14:10,900
Yeah, yeah, he's particularly fascinating.

3802
02:14:10,900 --> 02:14:12,780
I just want to, if he's still doing it,

3803
02:14:12,780 --> 02:14:15,740
we gotta go do his, that's a ride.

3804
02:14:15,740 --> 02:14:17,100
We can review that, yeah.

3805
02:14:17,100 --> 02:14:19,100
Yeah, wow.

3806
02:14:19,100 --> 02:14:21,700
Well see you soon Mr. Dufresne,

3807
02:14:21,700 --> 02:14:24,620
get your boat aired up for us.

3808
02:14:24,620 --> 02:14:26,980
Jason and I have fast food in common,

3809
02:14:26,980 --> 02:14:28,020
the Marvel Universe in common,

3810
02:14:28,020 --> 02:14:30,340
and Jeffrey Dufresne in common,

3811
02:14:30,340 --> 02:14:31,260
and we didn't even know it.

3812
02:14:31,260 --> 02:14:34,700
Do you like Lana Del Rey or just Jeffrey Dufresne?

3813
02:14:34,700 --> 02:14:37,180
Oh, I'm more of a Jeffrey Dufresne fan.

3814
02:14:38,020 --> 02:14:39,100
And you shouldn't choose,

3815
02:14:39,100 --> 02:14:41,500
because they're a marriage, and both have equal merit.

3816
02:14:41,500 --> 02:14:43,500
But no, I'm more Dufresne.

3817
02:14:43,500 --> 02:14:44,900
I'm more of a Dufresne guy.

3818
02:14:44,900 --> 02:14:46,420
I like that first album,

3819
02:14:46,420 --> 02:14:48,340
I like the song from The Great Gatsby,

3820
02:14:48,340 --> 02:14:50,980
but I really like fanboats.

3821
02:14:50,980 --> 02:14:53,580
I would like, you know, her music, you know,

3822
02:14:53,580 --> 02:14:57,100
for what it is, is like stark and heavy and powerful,

3823
02:14:57,100 --> 02:15:00,260
if now she just is so in love with Jeffrey Dufresne

3824
02:15:00,260 --> 02:15:01,380
that it becomes like,

3825
02:15:01,380 --> 02:15:02,940
don't want to see the gator,

3826
02:15:02,940 --> 02:15:04,700
they're gonna have a real fun time,

3827
02:15:04,700 --> 02:15:06,500
climbing onto his airboat.

3828
02:15:06,540 --> 02:15:08,380
Yeah, that's all that is, man.

3829
02:15:08,380 --> 02:15:10,220
She can do some hillbilly nonsense type music,

3830
02:15:10,220 --> 02:15:11,060
that would be good.

3831
02:15:11,060 --> 02:15:12,460
Yeah.

3832
02:15:12,460 --> 02:15:14,740
She looks at clips of her old performances like,

3833
02:15:14,740 --> 02:15:15,580
what was I, ugh.

3834
02:15:15,580 --> 02:15:16,900
This is too moody, yeah.

3835
02:15:16,900 --> 02:15:19,660
Ugh, take a chill pill, old Lana.

3836
02:15:19,660 --> 02:15:21,140
You could put one of her old songs

3837
02:15:21,140 --> 02:15:23,380
on the lift hill on Tiana's.

3838
02:15:23,380 --> 02:15:24,700
That's kind of a spooky vibe.

3839
02:15:24,700 --> 02:15:25,900
It needs something to like,

3840
02:15:25,900 --> 02:15:27,740
yeah, just like phase you out.

3841
02:15:27,740 --> 02:15:28,580
Yeah.

3842
02:15:28,580 --> 02:15:29,400
Make you depressed.

3843
02:15:29,400 --> 02:15:30,860
Like, this is what you want for all rides lately,

3844
02:15:30,860 --> 02:15:31,700
is for them to-

3845
02:15:31,700 --> 02:15:32,540
I do want to feel depressed on a ride, yeah.

3846
02:15:32,540 --> 02:15:34,100
Music that bums you out.

3847
02:15:34,100 --> 02:15:37,420
Spooky, haunted, dig a little deeper, Lana Del Rey cover.

3848
02:15:37,420 --> 02:15:38,260
Sure.

3849
02:15:38,260 --> 02:15:39,980
That sounds good to me.

3850
02:15:39,980 --> 02:15:41,980
All right, well, a lot accomplished here.

3851
02:15:41,980 --> 02:15:43,300
Fake Office Final Four.

3852
02:15:43,300 --> 02:15:46,420
Jeff, Jeffrey, Jeremy Dufresne.

3853
02:15:46,420 --> 02:15:47,740
Jeremy? Jeremy.

3854
02:15:47,740 --> 02:15:48,780
I get, wait.

3855
02:15:48,780 --> 02:15:50,060
You've been saying Jeffrey.

3856
02:15:50,060 --> 02:15:50,900
I had been?

3857
02:15:50,900 --> 02:15:51,740
Yeah.

3858
02:15:51,740 --> 02:15:53,780
I think I was misreading it the whole time.

3859
02:15:53,780 --> 02:15:54,620
Well, we obviously didn't know his real name.

3860
02:15:54,620 --> 02:15:56,140
Did I always say Jeffrey?

3861
02:15:56,140 --> 02:15:56,980
I think you did.

3862
02:15:56,980 --> 02:15:58,940
It is Jeremy, and I was staring at it,

3863
02:15:58,940 --> 02:16:00,380
and still saying Jeffrey.

3864
02:16:00,380 --> 02:16:02,580
Well, I was saying Jeffrey once you said it, so.

3865
02:16:02,620 --> 02:16:04,740
Well, look, we're learning together.

3866
02:16:04,740 --> 02:16:08,460
We have learned that Jeffrey Dufresne is Jeremy Dufresne.

3867
02:16:10,140 --> 02:16:12,460
I learned by reading more carefully.

3868
02:16:12,460 --> 02:16:15,020
I'm afraid, I'm a fan of Jeremy Dufresne,

3869
02:16:15,020 --> 02:16:15,860
not Jeffrey Dufresne.

3870
02:16:15,860 --> 02:16:18,060
That's in case there's some real shitty

3871
02:16:18,060 --> 02:16:19,580
Jeffrey Dufresne out there.

3872
02:16:19,580 --> 02:16:23,020
Jeffrey Dufresne commits multiple child murder.

3873
02:16:23,020 --> 02:16:26,980
No, we love Jeremy, we love Jeremy Dufresne,

3874
02:16:26,980 --> 02:16:30,300
and you survived Podcast The Ride.

3875
02:16:30,300 --> 02:16:33,660
If you want to dig a little deeper.

3876
02:16:33,660 --> 02:16:35,180
No, there's a bad guy with that name.

3877
02:16:35,180 --> 02:16:36,020
What's that?

3878
02:16:36,020 --> 02:16:36,860
There's a bad guy with that name.

3879
02:16:36,860 --> 02:16:37,700
Oh no, what did he do?

3880
02:16:37,700 --> 02:16:38,540
Jeffrey Dufresne.

3881
02:16:38,540 --> 02:16:39,380
I don't wanna talk about him.

3882
02:16:39,380 --> 02:16:40,860
I don't wanna talk about him.

3883
02:16:40,860 --> 02:16:43,620
Everybody's gonna pull quote us as that we're right winged

3884
02:16:43,620 --> 02:16:45,140
because we didn't like one part of the ride,

3885
02:16:45,140 --> 02:16:47,380
and then they're gonna take the,

3886
02:16:47,380 --> 02:16:49,500
the host who went on to say,

3887
02:16:49,500 --> 02:16:53,060
to speak of their adoring fandom of Jeffrey Dufresne.

3888
02:16:53,060 --> 02:16:53,900
Stop saying it.

3889
02:16:53,900 --> 02:16:57,100
Can you not say, is it so bad you can't say it?

3890
02:16:57,100 --> 02:16:58,180
I don't know, it's confusing.

3891
02:16:58,180 --> 02:16:59,980
I don't wanna read the article, it seems depressing.

3892
02:17:00,780 --> 02:17:04,500
Jeffrey Dufresne Epstein, the New York financier.

3893
02:17:06,380 --> 02:17:09,060
Jeffrey Dufresne, you have no place on this podcast.

3894
02:17:09,060 --> 02:17:11,140

02:17:11,140 --> 02:17:13,220
