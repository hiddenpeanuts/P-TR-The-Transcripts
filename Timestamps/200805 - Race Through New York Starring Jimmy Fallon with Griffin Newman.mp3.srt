1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,520
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, The Second Gate,

3
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:27,320
an episode firmly planted behind The Second Gate.

4
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,400
It is, we gotta keep it safe here.

5
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,400
I'm Scott Gardner, joined by Jason Sheridan.

6
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,600
Hi, yeah, this one sucks, that's our show.

7
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,400
Thank you so much for listening.

8
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,920
Oh boy, oh no, if anyone was just diving in,

9
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,240
just to do a quick check.

10
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,560
You revealed it all right there, all the cards.

11
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,920
I've been sitting on that joke for three weeks.

12
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,160
Very well, is there-

13
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,960
I almost forgot as I quickly hit record,

14
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,560
because I was always not prepared.

15
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,000
Well, is there any more subtlety

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,760
to the opinions of Mike Carlson?

17
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,680
Of course there are, I wouldn't reveal now.

18
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:06,160
I'm a magician doesn't give away the trick right away.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
So I'm gonna have to slowly eke out my opinions.

20
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,880
You're gonna wonder, am I trolling, am I not trolling?

21
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,640
This is my nature, this is the fun of the podcast.

22
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,200
So we'll get into it.

23
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,960
I'll just say this, I like the building.

24
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,120
I enjoy the building.

25
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,240
Which doesn't preclude you

26
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,240
from saying you like other things later.

27
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,720
You're just saying one thing that you like, okay.

28
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,560
Now, I just may have done the first part of a magic trick,

29
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,320
the first third of a magic trick.

30
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,400
Mine might be a distraction.

31
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,320
Oh, interesting.

32
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,760
For the actual reveal.

33
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,440
Mystique for this episode.

34
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:47,320
A lot of mind games afoot as we discuss

35
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,760
race through New York, and we are doing it

36
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,920
via a Zoom to New York.

37
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,920
To the guest brave enough to volunteer to cover this topic,

38
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,120
please welcome PTR legend, Griffin Newman.

39
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:06,440
Every time, every time that hair is on the back of my neck,

40
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,280
stand up.

41
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,120
The feels good.

42
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,600
It's like being called, it's like being a knight.

43
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,160
It's like being a sir.

44
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,000
Absolutely.

45
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I need to start demanding that everyone call me

46
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,360
a PTR legend in introductions,

47
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,440
regardless of what podcast I'm on.

48
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,480
Any other show, any other project.

49
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,600
And also just the fact that I know I made it in,

50
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,000
but for the grace of God.

51
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,040
I made it in on a technicality

52
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,360
because Mike accidentally hit a slide

53
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,880
with a video that I had made prematurely.

54
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,880
Yep, that's right.

55
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:38,080
The world summoning you to the universe

56
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,480
demanded that you be one,

57
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,360
corrected our error not making you one already.

58
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,160
Right, just because to relitigate,

59
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,920
you said something like the next person

60
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,120
that we're about to show you is a PTR legend.

61
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,520
And then you accidentally showed a picture of me.

62
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,240
So then just, all right, sure.

63
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,080
Yeah, why not?

64
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:56,920
He's in.

65
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,760
Yeah, yeah, okay.

66
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,600
We all decided on the stage by going,

67
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,840
oh yeah, I guess.

68
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,000
Look, I'll say this.

69
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:08,560
We were always planning on doing this episode in person.

70
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,360
I was vaguely scheduling another trip to LA

71
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,400
the beginning of March.

72
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,560
Ready to go.

73
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,080
Yeah.

74
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,960
It was in the immediate purview.

75
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,880
I don't like doing podcasts over Zoom,

76
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:26,640
but I will say it does feel now that we're here

77
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,640
a little nice to be able to have me report

78
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,520
on Race Through New York while in New York.

79
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:38,200
Yeah, I think that was meant to be.

80
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,120
Yeah, I think it would feel pretty inauthentic

81
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,480
if there was no part,

82
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,600
if there wasn't a quarter of this podcast

83
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,840
recorded in New York City.

84
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,840
Because I feel like for so long,

85
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:54,680
this ride has been dining out on its authenticity, right?

86
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,760
When people talk about this ride,

87
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,720
they talk about versimilitude, you know?

88
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,760
And I feel like it's time to really start

89
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,560
to call that shit into question.

90
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,720
I'm ready to do a full expose.

91
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,560
What Race Through New York gets wrong about New York?

92
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,600
Oh, it does?

93
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,080
Something, what do you mean?

94
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,400
A couple of things in this ride are not accurate.

95
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,240
Now during that-

96
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,520
Where's the pizza?

97
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,560
Where's the halal guys?

98
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,280
You know, where's the real New York?

99
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,480
Construction workers, hey, what are you doing here

100
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,120
with the Knight Rider?

101
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,440
You were making that-

102
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,840
You were making that impassioned monologue

103
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,320
and then changed your background conspicuously

104
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,920
in a sort of distracting move for us

105
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:40,240
to what seems like a accurate image to me.

106
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,120
It's the New York skyline with the Statue of Liberty.

107
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,800
That's one of the things I know about New York

108
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,320
is that the statue is there.

109
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,320
And then Jimmy is gliding over the city

110
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,000
in his iconic vehicle, the Tonight Rider.

111
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,840
Huh.

112
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:58,840
I don't know where to,

113
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,600
I don't know whether to pick off the Tonight Rider already

114
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:07,240
or do we need to go in an orderly fashion here?

115
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,640
I mean, why, oh boy.

116
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,920
Should we talk about our,

117
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:17,640
one of our many ordeals was attempting to see this

118
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,960
when we were in Orlando.

119
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,080
Do you guys remember the details of this?

120
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,720
Oh, of course, yes, I remember the details.

121
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:28,720
I have been in this building twice, that's what I'll say.

122
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:29,960
Okay.

123
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,920
The first time was when Lindsay and I went

124
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:35,280
right after it opened and we saw the show

125
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,480
and we'll get to what we thought about it eventually.

126
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,200
But the second, you're talking about the second time

127
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,760
when we were on our trip last October.

128
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,520
Yeah, cause I was in your boat, Mike.

129
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,200
I saw it in 2017.

130
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,840
I did do the whole experience.

131
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,680
Right.

132
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,760
We did not do the whole experience in October.

133
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,680
Well, that's a spoiled story.

134
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,640
Here's how it played out.

135
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,120
The, so we're,

136
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,320
the park is closing pretty early.

137
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,320
It was a jam packed day in Universal Orlando.

138
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,360
It was October.

139
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,640
So that's Halloween Horror Nights.

140
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:11,240
So it was an oddly early closing time at 6 p.m.

141
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,520
So we're jamming a lot in and there was a time for me to see

142
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,480
cause I haven't been there in a really long time.

143
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,560
Just to be clear for Halloween Horror Nights now,

144
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,080
there's a Jimmy haunted maze

145
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,640
where you're just rustling hair of different dictators,

146
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,480
right?

147
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,000
Every room is just him fluffing Mussolini.

148
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,560
Oh yeah, Mussolini, Bolsonaro, like all the hits.

149
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,440
Taking that haunted house trope of the,

150
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,600
with the spaghetti being witches hair,

151
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,040
it's taking it to the next next logical step.

152
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,880
So we're jamming through the universal day,

153
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,880
but it's closing very soon.

154
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,760
And there's a lot of other stuff that we want to do.

155
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,960
And you guys were wanting to get to the Hulk.

156
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,600
At some point we lost Lindsay.

157
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,360
I don't remember why we lost Lindsay.

158
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,280
I think she wanted a coffee.

159
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,120
Oh sure.

160
00:06:59,120 --> 00:06:59,960
Yes.

161
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,280
And one we've done.

162
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,480
She's like, I've done the Jimmy Fallon ride.

163
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:08,360
And hopefully her wanting coffee is not as controversial

164
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,840
as when she wanted cereal

165
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,360
and I wanted to watch her eat cereal

166
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,440
and not go on living with the lamb.

167
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,200
Hopefully this doesn't open up all other

168
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,560
food based problem for us.

169
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,120
I think if Jimmy Fallon was a 30 year old ride

170
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,040
and you stated that opinion now,

171
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,800
you would be in major trouble.

172
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,640
Sure, sure, sure.

173
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:28,960
Just because it's a time, I think the nostalgia factor

174
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,440
that people would like want your ass

175
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,680
for dissing Jimmy Fallon ride.

176
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,760
People might be nostalgic for this though,

177
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,480
or if you were 12 when it came out.

178
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,040
I don't want to get off side note here.

179
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,440
I watched the video to get ready for the episode

180
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,840
and I was like, you know what?

181
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,840
I've been inside a long time.

182
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,640
This would be pretty great right now

183
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,960
to go on the Jimmy Fallon ride.

184
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,080
Certainly.

185
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:52,040
But this feels like one of those attractions

186
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:57,040
that purists in particular dislike, right?

187
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,800
And I think mainly pure,

188
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,400
I'm not sure that the typical universal guest

189
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,840
dislikes this attraction.

190
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,920
I think it might be mainly a nerd audience

191
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,720
that is not so fond of it.

192
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:11,800
Right, but I think anyone listening to a theme park podcast

193
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:16,320
is unlikely to be a defender of Race Through New York

194
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,720
with Jimmy Fallon.

195
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,720
Are we starting, are we wading into the water?

196
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,000
I mean, Jason just cannonballed in already.

197
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,240
So I think we're fine.

198
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,320
I think we're okay here.

199
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,160
We're doing it on the second gate

200
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,640
because I think we don't really like the ride.

201
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,680
There's a reason this is behind a paywall.

202
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,960
Where it's safe, where nobody could ever use any of this

203
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,880
to career disadvantage for any of us.

204
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:36,760
It's fine.

205
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,560
But I think, I mean, this is probably,

206
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:44,200
is this the ride that stinks the most of corporate synergy?

207
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,040
Yes.

208
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,880
Just to begin, I think it's incredibly short sighted.

209
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,120
There's a reason a lot of shows,

210
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,240
rides aren't based on TV shows.

211
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,600
This comes up a lot

212
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,000
because they kind of like leave the public consciousness

213
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,960
pretty quickly.

214
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,640
Like movies stick around a lot longer.

215
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,400
This is the main thing I want to talk about with this ride.

216
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,360
I find that angle of it

217
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:13,040
significantly more interesting than the ride itself.

218
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,040
The sort of decision-making behind the ride

219
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,880
is stunning to me.

220
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:21,920
We're in like a Comcast branded building essentially.

221
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,600
Yeah.

222
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,040
It's literally very corporate.

223
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,200
Here, let me, before we keep diving,

224
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,720
let me continue the story of what happened to us.

225
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:37,040
So we lost Lindsay, we lost Erin, my wife,

226
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,360
because she at the time was pregnant.

227
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,640
And she had sat around while we went on the Mummy

228
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,400
and on Hagrid's and on Gringotts

229
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,400
and was not enthusiastic about the idea of this.

230
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,200
So she was like, I need to go on a fucking ride.

231
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,720
I'm going on E.T. to see all peace out.

232
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,720
And I like, well, that's a little short-sighted.

233
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,520
She's going to want to at least see the pre-show

234
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,360
and everything.

235
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,800
I guess.

236
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,240
Well, do what you got to do.

237
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,600
So we go in the building.

238
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,760
We do endure it.

239
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,000
We'll talk about all the things,

240
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,240
the lobby, the history of the Tonight Show,

241
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,640
and then the show that you watch.

242
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,760
But the main thing that I knew

243
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,760
and that made me confident that we could get on it

244
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,720
and I'd be back out,

245
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,560
maybe even had time to do something else,

246
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,720
was that they made a big deal out of the virtual queue

247
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,640
in this attraction.

248
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:24,320
And we've done Millennium Falcon Smugglers Run.

249
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,240
We know about virtual queues.

250
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,880
You don't have to stand in this line.

251
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:31,360
You get a color card and they call your color at some point.

252
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,200
And in the meantime,

253
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,040
you're hanging out in a cool NBC lounge.

254
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,800
Like you're waiting for a taping of the show.

255
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,280
You're in very good background.

256
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,120
Right?

257
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:43,200
This is like a Conan staring contest.

258
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,040
You're throwing things behind you.

259
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,480
I got a lot of them prepped.

260
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,480
There's a little bit of a Trump ruffle happening behind you.

261
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,880
So it's a virtual queue.

262
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,720
So this will be fine.

263
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,800
We're just, they're gonna just run through

264
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,880
a couple of colors.

265
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,000
And in the meantime,

266
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,080
we can enjoy some performances from the Ragtime Gals,

267
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:03,600
the barbershop quartet that are characters from the show

268
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,680
who do a little pre-show for you.

269
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:10,280
So we go in, we're watching the Ragtime Gals.

270
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:13,120
I think we're waiting for blue probably.

271
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:18,160
And then they perform Ice Ice Baby and Baby Got Back

272
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:22,480
and in a barbershop quartet fashion.

273
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,320
And we're like, okay.

274
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:27,800
And then your color is red.

275
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,440
Okay, probably the next one.

276
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,520
10 more minutes pass.

277
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:33,160
Your color is purple.

278
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,040
Still not.

279
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,800
And you feel like just the way it's set up,

280
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,440
you feel trapped essentially

281
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,840
because you overshot the entrance to the ride.

282
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,680
It was packed.

283
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,400
Like it was packed in there.

284
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,680
And I think the other thing was Mike and I had done it

285
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:50,120
before and the virtual queue had worked fine for us.

286
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,440
Like on separate trips, we're like, oh yeah,

287
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,320
there's probably one color they call before you.

288
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,800
And then you just wait.

289
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:01,320
I think also I insisted we get up front at the stage.

290
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,400
You did insist.

291
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,840
We were uncomfortably close to the Ragtime Gals,

292
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,480
which again is a group of singers.

293
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,240
It is a confusing setup because it's supposed to be

294
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:16,120
like barbershop quartet, but there is five of them

295
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,280
and a couple do play instruments while they sing.

296
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,400
I'm biting my tongue.

297
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,520
There's so much I wanna say about all these elements,

298
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,360
but I understand this is just table setting.

299
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,560
And like almost theme park performance,

300
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,640
like overwork underpaid of course, but doing their best.

301
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,080
I'm happy that they thought of a construct

302
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,720
to employ some singers and stuff.

303
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,560
I think that's good.

304
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:38,360
Just to fast forward, it's red.

305
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,080
It's purple, it's green.

306
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,400
We are nowhere close to blue.

307
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,920
The clock is ticking away.

308
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:46,200
I know that now my pregnant wife wasn't gonna go on a ride

309
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:50,040
in hours is in line for my favorite ride in the universe,

310
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,400
which I maybe will never get to go on again.

311
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,280
I say, fuck it, I can't do it anymore.

312
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,760
You guys are dying to get to the Hulk.

313
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,160
We run out of the place, we leave.

314
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,520
We do not go on this ride.

315
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,320
I have never been on this ride.

316
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,400
And in the meantime, there's a half hour left.

317
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,920
I text Erin, I can't do it anymore.

318
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,760
Where are you?

319
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,440
I'm in front of Botanicus.

320
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:09,560
She's literally waiting in the line in front of a robot,

321
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,520
a robot who helps bring us together.

322
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,760
When I took her, before we dated,

323
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,640
I took her to see the rotting corpse of LA Botanicus.

324
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:19,400
And she's there, we're carrying our child.

325
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,480
What am I doing wasting time with Jimmy Fallon?

326
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:25,800
I sprint across the park and then get in barely in time,

327
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:29,040
give her a big hug, pay homage to our pal Botanicus,

328
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,800
get a front row seat on the ride where E.T. at the very end,

329
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,360
because we're in the front row says goodbye, Erin, Scott.

330
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:40,800
And then Erin says, our name's clearly right after goodbye.

331
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,120
You know, they don't talk a lot about magic in Universal.

332
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,960
You know, Disney's where the magic is.

333
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,400
This was a magical Universal moment.

334
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,240
And I got to have it because I did not finish going on

335
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,440
race through New York.

336
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,880
You left out the part where E.T. goes,

337
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,280
Erin, you are with child?

338
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,400
What?

339
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,240
His name.

340
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:05,680
I think we all in that afternoon had our own E.T.

341
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:10,600
under the sliding like temple door to get the hat moments.

342
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,720
Because you did that, Mike, I believe you had to get

343
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:17,480
in a taxi to get to an NXT taping.

344
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,320
Right.

345
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,120
Yes, I went to see wrestling and I hopped in a Lyft

346
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,160
and like made it to full sail, which is about 45 minutes

347
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,680
away from Universal Orlando.

348
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,920
And I could take my time a little longer,

349
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,840
because yeah, I just wanted to get back and ride the whole

350
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,160
like in the, like as it was dark.

351
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,920
Well, the clock was ticking for me because I wanted to

352
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:40,640
ride the whole and then go to

353
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,760
the speed where they had like a death eater.

354
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,400
They had like wandering, like there was creepy lights

355
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,080
and there was like ghoulies like everywhere.

356
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:56,840
And so and as since I waited a little longer,

357
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:59,720
I saw even more barricade, like they're putting out

358
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:03,400
barricades like the purges about to break out because also

359
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:07,040
the purges about to break out for horror nights.

360
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:11,720
And that was when I had the high point probably

361
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:15,080
of this experience, there was one last parade

362
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,680
and everyone was standing around waiting for the parade

363
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,400
and going through the crowd, bothering people

364
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,280
was hashtag the panda.

365
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:26,760
And I was the one person happy to see,

366
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,320
I was like, hashtag, hashtag.

367
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,080
I'm like flagging them down.

368
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,440
I got a selfie, which we'll post.

369
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:36,400
And yeah, I was the one person in a crowd of people

370
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,720
like psych to see hashtag.

371
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,200
It is, you should mention your background on zoom right now.

372
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,040
Yeah, it is.

373
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,320
As generally a pretty good natured happy man,

374
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,920
but this is the happiest I've ever seen you look.

375
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,880
You look just serene.

376
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,440
You've never seen a happy person

377
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,600
until you've seen Jason Sheridan sucking the light,

378
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:03,600
like the life from Orlando and just radiating pure joy.

379
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,600
Well, we said that day,

380
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,600
the most, the happiest I've ever seen you for sure.

381
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,480
Cause I was more relaxed, I think than everyone else

382
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:17,240
because I had just checked into Cabana Bay.

383
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,400
So it didn't matter.

384
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,440
Like I could just walk anytime I was like done.

385
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,880
If I was too tired, I wanted to keep going.

386
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,880
Like I could just walk back to my hotel,

387
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,240
that Florida energy though.

388
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,280
Florida moisture gets in Jason's lungs

389
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,960
and it just gives him life.

390
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,200
For the first time in your life, you were level.

391
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:40,120
And then you saw a hashtag and hashtag brought you to Valhalla.

392
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,800
Oh, absolutely.

393
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,080
Maybe if you felt like hashtag picked you up

394
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,000
and threw you to the moon.

395
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,840
Yeah.

396
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,160
Well, and not to get ahead of ourselves,

397
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,160
but this is the thing I want to bring up.

398
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,080
I mean, who wouldn't have that reaction?

399
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:58,800
We all know and love the character, hashtag the Panda.

400
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,640
Yeah, of course.

401
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,800
Those are two facts.

402
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,560
Everyone knows him and everyone loves him.

403
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:07,000
Like Karnak was to Johnny Carson,

404
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,560
hashtag the Panda is to Jimmy Fallon.

405
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:13,280
We all, a staple of the show,

406
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,320
essentially the second host in a lot of ways.

407
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:17,160
Yes.

408
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,680
Yeah, I agree.

409
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:21,760
Can we start to dig into how fucked this ride is?

410
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,520
Yes, yes, yes, please.

411
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,640
Just to get us all on the same page,

412
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,800
have you been on this ride, Griff?

413
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,640
I have.

414
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,960
So the last time I went to Orlando was,

415
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,560
it was either October, November, 2017.

416
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:38,520
So this might've been the most recent ride to have opened

417
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41,840
at either of the parks I went to.

418
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,960
I'm trying to think if there's anything I went on at Disney

419
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,400
that would have been newer than this.

420
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,360
Cause this, at this point was only six months old.

421
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,200
Right.

422
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,400
Things like the virtual queue,

423
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,760
I remember being pretty impressed by,

424
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:59,360
even though I definitely waited in that area

425
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,240
for longer than I should have.

426
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,360
I was like, this feels forward thinking.

427
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,560
The fact that I'm not standing in a line,

428
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,680
there are couches, we can sit,

429
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:12,320
we can play really, really mediocre cell phone games,

430
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,840
blown up to large tablet size.

431
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,880
Oh, is that what's on there?

432
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,080
I don't think I know what's on there.

433
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,760
Yeah, they're like, it's like, you know,

434
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:21,600
Frogger, but you're Jimmy trying to cross the street

435
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,720
or whatever the fuck.

436
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,360
It's like, yes, it's like mobile games

437
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:30,360
on like a sort of like pizzeria table arcade version

438
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:34,120
of Pac-Man, where it's like the screen is the table.

439
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,520
If you haven't been on this ride, you're in like the,

440
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:39,360
you enter a lobby that's a recreation

441
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,680
of 30 Rockefeller Center.

442
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,560
Knock this out quickly.

443
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,360
Cause I have so much to say about the lobby.

444
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,720
I don't want to breeze past the lobby.

445
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,680
I want to be positive and say,

446
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,720
I do really like the lobby.

447
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:57,160
Cause I am a sucker for like the history of television

448
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,000
and stuff.

449
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,080
I think when I initially heard this ride was happening,

450
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,360
that this was replacing Twister, I was like,

451
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,040
oh, I bet there'll be some tonight show stuff in there.

452
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:11,240
Maybe it'll get it a little closer to the old universal

453
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,720
about like, here's how TVs and movies are made.

454
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:18,720
And that is kind of true in the slimmest sense

455
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:24,480
because they also like, with the way it worked out for us,

456
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,680
I think we spent about a minute in that lobby.

457
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:30,000
And the lobby I think is the best part of this building.

458
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,680
I spent a fair amount of time there.

459
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,320
I went with my buddy, Scott Kraterman,

460
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,160
who is a PTR listener.

461
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,640
Hello, Scott.

462
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,480
Hello, Scott.

463
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:42,920
And he is a hardcore Parks guy.

464
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,200
He goes several times a year.

465
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,080
His family has Disney timeshare.

466
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,080
He's currently on the edge of his seat,

467
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:52,000
waiting to see how quickly it's going to reopen

468
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,880
and how early he can be in the first batch of attendees,

469
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,920
both parks.

470
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,040
Well, no, but he's not a big universal fan.

471
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:02,600
And so I've gone to Orlando with Scott

472
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:07,080
and other friends, Sophie Fader, Lisa Malagari twice now.

473
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:10,560
And he always goes like, universal is just a day.

474
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,640
We're just going to do it really quickly.

475
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,200
It's not as good.

476
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,040
And most of the time we're there.

477
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:17,040
I hope he doesn't mind me saying this.

478
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,760
He just goes like, it's not the same.

479
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,200
It doesn't have the magic.

480
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,920
There's not the same level of detail.

481
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,600
There's not the same level of craft.

482
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,040
And I feel like Scott and I share a lot of opinions

483
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,480
on Jimmy Fallon in general.

484
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,520
We were talking a lot about how insane this ride was

485
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,080
before it opened.

486
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,640
And then we go there right after it opens.

487
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,640
I think this was the second time Scott had been

488
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,880
in Universal Orlando in the six months since it had opened.

489
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,240
And he was like, Griffin, we're not doing it.

490
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,240
And I was like, we have to.

491
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,640
So I kind of bent our one universal day

492
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,400
around forcing everyone to go on this ride

493
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,120
because I was so perversely obsessed with it.

494
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,760
But I did go on it.

495
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,620
I had a lot of time in the waiting area.

496
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:00,180
I rode the shit out of it.

497
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:03,320
I had to sit with a lot of people who were very mad at me

498
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,600
for having them go through it.

499
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,440
So that's my-

500
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:09,480
The worst Deep Park feeling, like when you've corralled,

501
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:12,120
feeling Mike knows maybe better than anybody.

502
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:12,960
Right.

503
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,160
And I had to sort of say to them,

504
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:18,120
do you not understand that's the point?

505
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,560
Do you not understand that's why I wanted us all

506
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,400
to go on this?

507
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,800
And they said, I don't care. It's hot.

508
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,880
My feet are tired.

509
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:25,920
Yes. Yeah.

510
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:30,240
That does make ironic encounters are tougher

511
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,320
when the weather sucks and you're exhausted.

512
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:36,080
Yes. That was, we had a couple of things in my,

513
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:41,080
well, one, this was probably the hottest day or the cold.

514
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:44,480
I think this was the coldest day of the week we were there

515
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,160
or the five days we were there.

516
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:50,360
So that was like, I just remember it being like very chilly

517
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,200
when I came out of this.

518
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,580
And then the other thing was I think Griffin,

519
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,360
we had already said like, well,

520
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:59,320
we'll have to have you on for Jimmy Fallon

521
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,540
behind the paywall.

522
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:03,420
So we're like, well, we should go do it together.

523
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:08,420
And yet it didn't happen.

524
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:10,140
Well, too much barbershop.

525
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:13,740
I thought if there had only been 10 minutes of barbershop,

526
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:14,820
I would have done it.

527
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,900
I will say, and correct me if I'm wrong.

528
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:19,060
We tried, that's actually the story you told us,

529
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:21,140
the second attempt.

530
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:22,380
We tried it earlier.

531
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:24,140
Oh, I forgot.

532
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:26,300
We tried it earlier in the day and they were just like,

533
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:30,380
we're not taking any more people right now.

534
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:33,220
Oh yeah. We just got denied at the door.

535
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,420
Like it was a taping that sold out.

536
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:36,700
Yeah. And it wasn't even, they were like,

537
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:37,540
we were shut down.

538
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:40,260
They were just like, we're not taking people.

539
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:41,660
It was like unclear.

540
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:44,460
And we're like, well, are you gonna be taking people soon?

541
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:46,740
And they're like, we were not sure.

542
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,220
And we're like, okay.

543
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:49,540
How is this more efficient?

544
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:51,140
How is this possibly more efficient

545
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:52,380
than just standing in a line?

546
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:53,600
Well, this is the thing.

547
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:57,140
For me, it felt like, oh, even though I'm waiting,

548
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:59,220
perhaps the same amount of time,

549
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:02,620
this feels futuristic because I'm not on a line.

550
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:04,300
There's some sort of organization.

551
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,280
There are things to do.

552
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:09,100
There's a performance happening, the ragtime gals.

553
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:11,380
Like this is what Q should be like.

554
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:15,500
But then, since then, things like Galaxy's Edge have opened,

555
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:18,780
which by all accounts are more organized.

556
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:21,060
I have not gotten to go on them.

557
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:24,340
This is still the most futuristic ride

558
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:27,740
I have probably gotten to go on as of this moment.

559
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:30,380
The Millennium Falcon Q is,

560
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:32,260
I would even argue, maybe too fast.

561
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:34,660
I feel like I never have quite enough time

562
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:36,460
to walk around the little lobby

563
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:38,620
or whatever you'd call it on the Millennium Falcon.

564
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:39,460
But they are very much-

565
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,740
Yeah, I could go for one more group every time.

566
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:43,260
Yeah, and that's what tricked me.

567
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:46,400
I think I just thought that lobby with the show

568
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,060
is going to be Millennium Falcon.

569
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,580
And it was not that.

570
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:50,900
And that's not their fault.

571
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,740
Because maybe there should be a balance.

572
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:57,740
It does feel like, I think if we wanna say something nice,

573
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:01,740
the pre-ride elements of this ride

574
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:04,460
are better than the ride itself.

575
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:05,300
Yeah.

576
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:07,820
In reality, if you were waiting 10 to 15 minutes

577
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:11,900
in that area, you would go, this is pretty effective.

578
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:12,740
Yes. Sure, yeah.

579
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:14,940
And it's a very nice room.

580
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:15,840
All of it is.

581
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,300
The lobby, as we said, the outside is nice.

582
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,900
I think everybody likes that it makes sense

583
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:23,380
in the New York area as opposed to Twister,

584
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:25,780
which never related to anything.

585
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:27,440
And if you were like- Another faint compliment.

586
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:28,920
You have to give this ride.

587
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:32,360
That it makes sense geographically within the park.

588
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:35,480
It is about New York and it's in a New York part.

589
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:38,200
If you were like a nerdy kid, like I think like all of us,

590
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:41,640
and like kind of fetishized 30 Rock,

591
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,680
because you watch Saturday Night Live,

592
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,640
and then you kind of get to go in the building

593
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,320
that sort of looks like it.

594
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:50,080
I do think it's pushing some buttons in your brain of like,

595
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,700
oh, this looks, this is right.

596
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:52,760
This feels right.

597
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,600
And if you've been there,

598
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,200
and I've been there once or twice.

599
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,800
I would have been that kid big time for sure.

600
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,760
Cause I was, yeah, I toured 30 Rock when I was 13.

601
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,000
And like you had to drag me out of every room.

602
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,960
I was so excited to be, yeah, you're like,

603
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,000
we should not discount.

604
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,440
There are those people who this is probably

605
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,000
their favorite thing for that reason.

606
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,840
Now I want to say this, if I can just split this hair.

607
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,800
I was a huge SNL kid,

608
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:19,040
big sort of history of entertainment kid.

609
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:22,400
I remember doing the 30 Rock tour probably when I was 10

610
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:25,600
and just loving it, being in hog heaven.

611
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,280
I do live in New York, born and raised,

612
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,800
have lived there my entire life.

613
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,960
So if you just tell me off the bat,

614
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,640
the ride is a race through New York,

615
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,520
I immediately go, doesn't sound that exciting to me.

616
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,240
Even if this ride is going to do things

617
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,560
that I can't do in my daily life,

618
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:46,280
every other ride I've ever gone on is promising a place

619
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:50,800
that is physically impossible to go to, right?

620
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:53,480
If only through the level of stylization

621
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:56,960
or the time period or the elements going on around it.

622
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,720
This feels like the most grounded ride

623
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:02,680
in terms of what they're promising you in the name,

624
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,520
let's say.

625
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,640
It obviously goes some wilder places.

626
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,360
And then you add onto that,

627
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,960
30 Rock is a very impressive building.

628
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,640
It's a beautiful looking building.

629
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,080
It has all this history within it.

630
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,600
At this point in my life,

631
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,040
and I'm very aware this is a humble brag,

632
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,960
at this point in my life,

633
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,640
walking through a very detailed recreation

634
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,680
of the lobby and waiting areas of 30 Rock

635
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:28,760
just makes me feel like I'm going in for an audition.

636
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,680
There's something about this ride

637
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,200
that triggers anxiety for me.

638
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,920
I was gonna ask this exactly,

639
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:36,960
if it like stressed you out to be in that building.

640
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,760
Absolutely, and it is absolutely a point of privilege

641
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,600
on my end,

642
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:46,680
but 30 Rock has become increasingly mundane

643
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,320
over the years for me,

644
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,960
only because of the amount of horrible pilots

645
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,560
I have had to audition for

646
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:55,880
that rejected me out of hand in that building.

647
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:58,720
So there's some kind of bad Pavlovian response.

648
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,880
As much as I appreciate,

649
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:03,280
I think it is a pretty perfect replica.

650
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,120
I will say like walking through it,

651
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,640
it looks pretty identical.

652
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:10,200
And even the cheats around the size of it

653
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,840
are pretty seamlessly done.

654
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,120
The floor, it's a very good floor.

655
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,680
Let me give that big praise.

656
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,080
Great floor. Great floor.

657
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,680
But when I'm in that waiting area,

658
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,160
I do have the feeling of like,

659
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,960
fuck, did I forget to print out my sides?

660
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,720
I do have that little.

661
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,960
See, you're just gonna get that.

662
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,800
That's a New York LA divide

663
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,960
because all our casting offices out here

664
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,200
are in unmarked strip malls

665
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:39,280
or very marked buildings next to salad restaurants

666
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,440
that don't take cash for some reason.

667
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,360
I'll say this though,

668
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,720
like the rare times I have been in LA

669
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:48,200
and gotten to do an audition like on a studio lot.

670
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,120
That still feels pretty cool.

671
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,720
Yeah, it's still some magical.

672
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,560
Yeah.

673
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,400
Sure.

674
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,560
But my experience, I took the 30 Rock Tour,

675
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,440
I think it was a little old,

676
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,560
I was like 13 or 14 and I thought it was great.

677
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,760
I really liked it.

678
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,120
I got a Conan shirt at the gift shop that I still have.

679
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:08,480
And in the gift shop, you got to do,

680
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,360
there was a green screen,

681
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:12,920
like you got to do a Conan desk bit.

682
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,000
You got to do the desk.

683
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,040
The desk goes through 30 Rock.

684
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,480
Oh, the driving the desk, yeah.

685
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,560
Driving the desk.

686
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,760
Driving the, like that was it.

687
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,720
That's one of my big things with this ride is like,

688
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,440
wait, that green screen thing,

689
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:30,160
which was just like, do you wanna buy a VHS of that now?

690
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,320
Like that was more fun.

691
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:36,760
This ride, like, just stay in 30 Rock.

692
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:39,160
Just take us through the history of television.

693
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:42,040
I mean, maybe the licensing would be insane on that.

694
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,480
Wait, you want it to be about the history of television?

695
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,880
The building or the-

696
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,280
I agree with Jason.

697
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:52,680
It leaves, you get out of the historic,

698
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:56,000
interesting building so quickly.

699
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,920
Like you get out of 30 Rock so quickly.

700
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:01,080
Jason, my thought, if, let me tell you,

701
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,520
if this is what you're talking about, let me know.

702
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,840
Because my thought, and I don't wanna get to the full,

703
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:07,360
my thought is I wanna see all the Tonight Show hosts

704
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,160
in this ride.

705
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,640
Well, you know the kids,

706
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,560
want more Jack Parr.

707
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,400
They love Parr.

708
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:18,200
They love Steve Allen.

709
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,000
They love Steve Allen.

710
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,520
That's what I, I mean, there was some stuff

711
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,920
I was legitimately excited about in this lobby.

712
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,720
One, the Karnak hat.

713
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,560
The Karnak hat is there.

714
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,520
That's great.

715
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:34,520
Mike and I used to do this very stupid bit

716
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:38,240
that I tried to get into like variety shows at UCB

717
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,080
that no one was ever interested in

718
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,240
called Baskin-Robbins Karnak,

719
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,800
where I put a Baskin-Robbins bag on my head

720
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:50,080
and the things in the punch lines

721
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,400
are just different Baskin-Robbins flavors.

722
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,120
Doesn't make a lick of sense.

723
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:57,040
But so I was very excited to see the real Karnak hat.

724
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:00,520
I was also thrilled that they were playing Jay Leno clips

725
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:03,160
on a big CRT TV.

726
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:05,320
That I think is so funny.

727
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:10,840
Well, and we have to talk about the best part of this area,

728
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,560
which is the Conan closet.

729
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,520
The Conan closet.

730
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,880
The Conan closet.

731
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,640
I'll give Aaron credit for dubbing it that.

732
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,640
All four of us must've had the same thought

733
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,800
walking into the building,

734
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,200
which is how are they gonna handle Conan?

735
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:27,400
Yeah, which they, you know, and to be fair,

736
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:31,160
he gets as much space as Steve Allen or Jack Parr, I believe.

737
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:33,520
It's not like a, especially diminutive.

738
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:36,080
It's not like Leno has this big shelf

739
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,920
and then you have to go through a doggy door to see Conan.

740
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,720
Or it's like shorter.

741
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,160
They do honor it.

742
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,000
They do give him some space.

743
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:51,000
But it is so, seeing 2009 to 2010 on top of that

744
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,480
is so heartbreaking.

745
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,200
Knowing that 2010 was only a month also.

746
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,040
Right.

747
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:58,520
And then also looking at the,

748
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,720
there's the Leno part of it,

749
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,720
where it's like, his thing is huge.

750
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:08,440
And then it says, whatever, it says like 1991 to 2009.

751
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:13,440
And then it says like, comma, 2011 to 2016.

752
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:17,440
Who's the president with the non-consecutive terms?

753
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,760
It's that.

754
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:25,160
Or like one of these Billy Martin with the Yankees,

755
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:28,440
like with all the stops and starts of what years he did.

756
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,280
I'm looking at it now.

757
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,240
The Leno thing is huge.

758
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,880
The Leno is the size of like eight Conan's

759
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:38,000
and it says J Leno parentheses, 1992 to 2009,

760
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,920
ampersand 2010 to 2014.

761
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:44,680
Like even if the Conan closet still exists,

762
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:47,120
it does feel like that is messaging.

763
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,640
Look, there was one little bump in the road,

764
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:53,040
but we wish we could say 1992 to 2014.

765
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:57,440
You can't not, like, I think they do present him

766
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,040
with as much class as they can,

767
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:01,480
but it still just feels, yeah, that like,

768
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,800
it was some asterisk, it was some mistake,

769
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:04,760
which is so weird,

770
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,880
because I think any history that makes it his fault

771
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:07,960
is stupid.

772
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,880
But I think they try their best, but I did see,

773
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,240
now I don't remember the source of this.

774
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,280
I don't know if this is official universal literature,

775
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,120
but if it is, shame on them.

776
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,080
Listen to this, that in this lobby,

777
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,320
quote, it's an area that pays tribute to Steve Allen,

778
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,920
Jack Parr, Johnny Carson, J Leno, even Conan O'Brien.

779
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:26,880
Wow. Even.

780
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,360
No, damn that even.

781
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,440
That is such a mean word.

782
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,560
But no, but that's perfect.

783
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:35,440
It does feel like the way they treat Conan O'Brien

784
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:39,960
in this waiting area is, it's with the energy of,

785
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,240
see, we did it.

786
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,360
Are you happy?

787
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,040
It's an impression.

788
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,120
We could have dissed him.

789
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,280
We didn't even have to do this.

790
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,320
We didn't have to put him in there.

791
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,400
We didn't even have to do it.

792
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,280
It's very, that's spot on.

793
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,280
That's the energy.

794
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,800
You wouldn't- We took gold lettering.

795
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:56,840
We'd have nice flits.

796
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,480
So gold, we put his name in gold.

797
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,840
What more do you want?

798
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:03,840
You wouldn't think he was with the network for 20 years.

799
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:06,400
So long and incredibly long time.

800
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:09,200
And then there's that sort of photo mural

801
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,600
where it's like the five or six of them in a row,

802
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:16,600
like Steve Allen, Parr, Carson, Leno, Conan, and then Jimmy.

803
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:23,920
And that mural doesn't have the years on it.

804
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,960
So it just makes it look like it's just,

805
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,640
here's the lineage, here's how it gets passed.

806
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:32,520
And that one almost feels not intentionally

807
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:35,160
more insulting to Conan's legacy

808
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,800
because they're acting like there was

809
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:40,680
a proper respectable handoff from Jay to Conan

810
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:43,000
and then from Conan to Jimmy.

811
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,480
Right. They just did him so dirty.

812
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,120
I know. And they still are doing him dirty

813
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,840
with that even word, God.

814
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:49,920
I know. Yeah, jeez.

815
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:52,200
I wish that mural had two Js.

816
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,520
I wish it was just Conan sandwiched

817
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,560
between two different Js.

818
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,120
Jay too.

819
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,960
I wish there was some exhibit somewhere

820
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:04,240
that tributed all the hosts of the Jay Leno show.

821
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,720
So many, so many.

822
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,360
I wish. All the grits.

823
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:10,320
And then we could see the car from the green car challenge.

824
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,720
Yes.

825
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:16,320
My favorite, there's a lot of pictures of Jay

826
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,400
and they're all stuff,

827
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,600
I think we've seen some of these promo images.

828
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,800
The most interesting one though

829
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,520
is they picked a picture of Jay brushing a tiger.

830
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,360
Can't see that with the background,

831
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,720
but he's just brushing a tiger.

832
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:32,400
And it's like, was that one of his famous bits?

833
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:35,040
He loved those animals, Jay.

834
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,040
Do you remember how he had two characters?

835
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:41,080
One was used video effects to make his,

836
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:43,840
the top of his head very big,

837
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,720
like he had a big smart brain.

838
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:47,800
And then the other character made the bottom

839
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:48,920
of his head very big.

840
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,440
So his chin was even bigger and he was a bodybuilder.

841
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,720
That's what I, like early Leno had two characters.

842
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,480
One was a big head, one was a big chin.

843
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,840
Let me talk about range.

844
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,960
Wow.

845
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,520
You guys have any of those like favorite Leno bits

846
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,120
rattling around in your brain?

847
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:05,040
Cause I remember one like,

848
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,920
oh, he did, it was a, it was a sigh parody.

849
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,800
It was a open denim style.

850
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,920
Open, open denim style.

851
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:15,120
It's not M, I don't know what the, what the hell the word was.

852
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:17,680
It was open cause he wears the first button or two.

853
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,600
Oh, for him it was open.

854
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,560
It was open denim style.

855
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,400
Yeah.

856
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,880
And they, and they, even though he, that's not like,

857
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,480
they don't have to put his head on like a,

858
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:31,760
basically they comp his head onto just a dancer's body.

859
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,480
Even though that dance is not that hard to do,

860
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,520
you could just do, but he like,

861
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,280
so was too lazy to do the dance.

862
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,840
So it's a weird head comp bit.

863
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:42,800
Coming from Jay Leno also sounds like a threat.

864
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,240
Like I swear to God, if you don't start behaving,

865
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:48,680
I'm going to open denim style and reveal more of my clammy

866
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:51,000
chest flesh to you.

867
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,360
Stuck under this famously unbreathable Canadian tuxedo.

868
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,240
I wish when he came back, he did the show in the denim.

869
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,240
Oh, me too.

870
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,080
Yeah.

871
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,160
Yeah, yeah. That would have been great.

872
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:09,040
I do like that Jay Leno's garage, he's in the denim.

873
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:14,040
And I think the one thing I wish was in this lobby

874
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:17,800
was the get back to where you once belong commercial.

875
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,240
When he returned.

876
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:20,080
Yeah.

877
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,840
Yes. They made a night where he's driving back

878
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:24,280
to the tonight show in a cool car.

879
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,880
Get back to where you once belong.

880
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,400
He belonged there.

881
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,240
Yeah.

882
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,880
It's like, you, you listen to,

883
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:32,920
I don't know if you guys heard Jay Leno's WTF,

884
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:37,480
but a true like sociopathic level of deflection

885
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,280
where he just kept on being like, I like Conan.

886
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,480
I got nothing against Conan.

887
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,080
You know, if there's a job, they offer you a job.

888
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:42,920
What are you going to do?

889
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:43,760
Don't take the job.

890
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,520
That doesn't help the other guy keep the job.

891
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,640
You know, either I took it or I didn't take it.

892
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,360
It didn't matter either way that we're going to find it.

893
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:54,000
Like all this sort of like deflection, but he, he,

894
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,480
he's so big on the, like, look, I wasn't happy.

895
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,920
You know, I wanted Conan to succeed, but I was number one.

896
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:01,080
I mean, maybe they shouldn't have fired me, you know,

897
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,080
all this sort of stuff.

898
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:04,840
And then the arrogance of that commercial in which he's just

899
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:09,720
sort of coolly looking at the camera and nodding and smiling

900
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:13,280
as get back to where you once belonged plays.

901
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,600
It does speak to this like sort of sense of like,

902
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:19,760
I am the king and finally my reign has been acknowledged.

903
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,600
Like where is the way there's,

904
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,760
I want to see that secret Leno.

905
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:27,080
I want to see the one video that reveals the dark side

906
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,200
where there are some tape of a phone call

907
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,000
where he does what you know is there.

908
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,280
Just like shut him down.

909
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,160
And this is what's crazy about Leno.

910
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,440
And I feel like we have to talk about this as we're going to

911
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:39,560
dig more and more into Jimmy of what I'm sure is now on

912
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:42,680
track to become a seven hour episode with all the things we

913
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:45,200
promised. We need to find a me if we need a lunch break,

914
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,360
you know, do we got to do it?

915
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:51,360
Like in terms of interpersonal behavior,

916
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:54,600
you never hear any bad stories about Jay Leno.

917
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:58,320
You never hear any bad stories about Jay Leno.

918
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,240
You hear the stories about him,

919
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:04,000
like out Foxing Letterman and Conan for the job,

920
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,680
but he's one of those guys where it's just like so nice to

921
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:10,760
fans, so nice to his entire crew, pays them bonuses,

922
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:13,480
negotiates for them to get higher salaries.

923
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:16,560
He was like the first guy I think during the,

924
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:20,680
the whatchamacallit, the writer's strike,

925
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:24,240
who was like, I'm paying my entire staff out of pocket.

926
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:28,280
Like he does a lot of shit that's really commendable.

927
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,880
And I feel like he raises a lot of money for charity.

928
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,680
He does a lot of charity events.

929
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:35,280
Like there's all this weird shit about him.

930
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,520
Like famously the fact that he's apparently never touched

931
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:41,920
a single dime of his tonight show money

932
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,000
and lives entirely off of touring money.

933
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,760
He has no children and no one knows what he's saving

934
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,720
that money for.

935
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,000
Presumably to build an arc, you know,

936
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,120
for when like the world collapses two weeks from now

937
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:55,960
and he can sail safely.

938
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:58,840
A Studebaker shaped Elysium.

939
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,080
Right.

940
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,880
With two of every car.

941
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,600
Two of every car, yeah.

942
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,360
But he is one of those guys who are like,

943
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,960
everyone who's had personal experience with him

944
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:10,760
tends to say like, look, I'm not a fan of him,

945
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:14,120
but I have to say he's a pretty nice, decent guy.

946
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:14,960
Yeah.

947
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:18,600
Does the, have I said on the show that I, two things.

948
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,400
One, I met him as a child.

949
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,520
Wow.

950
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,560
Because I, there was a family friend

951
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:25,200
who worked in the music department

952
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,920
and I got to go around and take a tour and we met him.

953
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,920
And I had with me in the hopes that that might've happened,

954
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:34,640
my autograph book from my recent trip to Disney world.

955
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,840
So, and he's flipping through it

956
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,440
and it's all character signatures.

957
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,800
And he says like, yeah, look at this.

958
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:42,080
That's me right next to Tigger.

959
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,480
Which was me as a child.

960
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,320
Oh my God.

961
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,120
What a crazy moment.

962
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,600
Talking about Disney stuff.

963
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:52,160
And then also, boy, we talk about all this video of stuff

964
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,520
that Jason is in.

965
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,680
And this isn't a big deal

966
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,200
cause you can't see my face in it.

967
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,560
But as a nine year old,

968
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,080
I was in a Leno Tonight Show bit

969
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,440
from that same connection.

970
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,280
Yeah.

971
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,120
What?

972
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:05,960
Really?

973
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:06,800
But you wouldn't, it's not,

974
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,160
I don't want to build it up too much because I'll,

975
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,200
when we post it on Twitter, I'll have to just circle it

976
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,720
so that you know, that's how you know it's me.

977
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:15,120
Because it is a Halloween sketch.

978
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,920
I'm a trick or treater.

979
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:19,400
And I, you got to pick your own costume.

980
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:22,840
And I chose, I was even like, he'll appreciate this

981
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,480
because he likes politics.

982
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,520
Maybe he'll even comment on it in the bit.

983
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:30,040
And I wore a mask of Richard Nixon.

984
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:33,160
So I am, and I'm in a little suit.

985
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:37,360
So I'm a little Richard Nixon in a 1994 or three,

986
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,920
I forget, Leno bit.

987
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:41,200
And they didn't tell us what the bit was going to be

988
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,720
in any way because we didn't really have anything to do.

989
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,640
And there was never time to rehearse it or run it.

990
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:47,920
So it was just that we're trick or treaters at a door.

991
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,320
We walk out and he starts giving us candy.

992
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,240
And then you hear from the side of the stage,

993
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,160
stop the insanity.

994
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,280
And you know that phrase,

995
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:58,480
that's the phrase of the famous workout health person,

996
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,680
Susan Powder, right?

997
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:02,280
Remember Susan Powder?

998
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,120
Yes.

999
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,680
Who was like a short haired lady who said,

1000
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,160
stop the insanity.

1001
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:10,400
And she gave us health food bars instead of candy.

1002
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,280
And that was the sketch.

1003
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:14,800
And I didn't get a candy bar in the sketch.

1004
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:18,160
And you could see me gesture to Susan Powder,

1005
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,160
do I get one?

1006
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,560
And I did not.

1007
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,840
Wow.

1008
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,760
So I look for that on Twitter soon.

1009
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:26,000
Oh my God, that's a big,

1010
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,680
you're downplaying it, but that sounds pretty great.

1011
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:29,880
It's pretty, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1012
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,200
I am pretty, that's,

1013
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,600
I revealed my other favorite tape in my family collection.

1014
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:36,320
My dad on the news being upset about gas prices.

1015
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:40,080
And now there's, this will have exhausted my VHS collection.

1016
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,040
Wow.

1017
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,360
That's pretty big.

1018
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,320
So look for that soon.

1019
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:45,120
Anyway, that's my Leno interaction.

1020
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:47,400
But as to bring it back to your point,

1021
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,880
to me, a little child who really liked Jay Leno,

1022
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,560
he was very, very nice and sweet to me.

1023
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:54,080
And I just want to underline this one thing.

1024
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:59,080
As I feel like has become more and more publicly known

1025
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:02,880
in the last couple months and even years,

1026
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:09,080
most talk show hosts have reputations behind the scenes,

1027
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:13,960
very, very different from their public facing personas.

1028
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:16,320
I am not sub tweeting any one person.

1029
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:21,040
I'm saying it seems to be a profession wide characteristic.

1030
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:25,240
You're not sub tweeting any one woman,

1031
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:27,360
any one daytime host.

1032
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:29,400
You're not sub tweeting, there's no one in particular.

1033
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,600
It certainly applies there, okay?

1034
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:33,040
It certainly applies there.

1035
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,080
But also like Letterman,

1036
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:37,920
who was known for being like kind of a crank,

1037
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:41,960
was then known to be even more cranky and unpersonable,

1038
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,240
you know, with his staff,

1039
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:47,120
unless he was being too personal with his staff.

1040
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:50,440
Conan is known as being a very intense guy, you know?

1041
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:51,760
Like Matt Letterman was-

1042
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:54,600
Very nice, very nice good guy, I will certainly say that.

1043
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:57,080
But like, you know, an opinionated, like,

1044
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:58,880
he's easy because he has opinions

1045
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,600
because he cares and he wants comedy to be good.

1046
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:02,040
And that's the only place that ever-

1047
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:02,880
Right, right.

1048
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:03,760
A great guy, awesome guy.

1049
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:06,000
But it is, I think he himself would admit,

1050
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,920
like he plays a much goofier version of himself

1051
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,800
in front of the cameras and off camera.

1052
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,840
He is very serious and sort of focused

1053
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:16,600
and intense about the job.

1054
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:17,960
That's why I think the remote,

1055
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:19,360
the travel shows are so good

1056
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:22,120
and the podcast is so good because he's like,

1057
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:23,320
more the real him.

1058
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:26,880
He's like weirder, judgier, crankier and funnier.

1059
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:27,840
Totally.

1060
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:30,400
Now all of this to say,

1061
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:33,600
I have never heard anything about Jimmy Fallon

1062
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:36,560
that is explicitly cancelable.

1063
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,200
So I don't want people to think

1064
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,960
that I am talking around some knowledge I have,

1065
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:43,400
but it is pretty widely known

1066
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:46,760
that Jimmy Fallon is pretty fundamentally different

1067
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:49,920
from quote unquote Jimmy Fallon of The Tonight Show.

1068
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,120
Is that fair to say?

1069
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:55,040
You see, you might know more than us,

1070
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:58,640
but say maybe as a part of being a New York person

1071
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,480
and know New York comedy people more.

1072
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:05,080
I mean, I know a lot of people who have worked on that show.

1073
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:10,080
We both, we've all had multiple guests on our podcast

1074
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:12,640
who either- Yes, now we have.

1075
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:14,640
Or later went on to work with him.

1076
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:17,760
From the time we announced,

1077
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,040
maybe we should do a Fallon episode.

1078
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:21,320
They've hired three of our friends,

1079
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,480
who I think are having a pretty okay time.

1080
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,040
They don't fucking work in New York,

1081
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:27,520
so they haven't met him.

1082
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:30,440
So I got nothing from about Jimmy from them.

1083
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:32,680
But because we're gonna talk about,

1084
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:35,400
we must talk about Jimmy Fallon as a talk show host

1085
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:37,840
and his quality in that area

1086
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:39,080
in order to talk about that ride.

1087
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:40,160
Let me make it clear.

1088
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:43,520
He hires some of the funniest people in the business.

1089
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:45,640
He hires really, really good people.

1090
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:48,880
His writers rooms have been pretty consistently incredible

1091
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,720
since he started.

1092
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:52,600
The 80 Miles who's in the ride,

1093
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:55,760
I think we all love from Wet Hot and various other things.

1094
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,480
I mean, yeah, he's made us laugh a ton.

1095
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:00,600
Arguably the second lead of the ride, all over the ride.

1096
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:02,720
True, multiple characters, yeah.

1097
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:05,560
Yeah, kind of not doing those characters

1098
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:07,120
by the time the ride came out,

1099
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:10,760
kind of like stepping away, I believe, from the show.

1100
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:11,600
Yes.

1101
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,600
2018 or 2017 or so.

1102
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:15,840
One of the many things that underlines

1103
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:17,800
why this ride was a bad idea

1104
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:23,800
is the lack of permanence to a late night talk show.

1105
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:24,920
Yes.

1106
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:25,760
Yeah.

1107
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:28,240
That's the whole thing feels like locked in whenever,

1108
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:30,520
was it 2016 or 15?

1109
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:31,360
I don't remember when it opened.

1110
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:32,520
It opens in 17.

1111
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:34,000
It opens early. Oh, 17.

1112
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,200
April 17.

1113
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:39,280
So it opens like six months after the hair ruffle.

1114
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:40,520
And.

1115
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:42,080
Oh, I didn't realize that.

1116
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:43,000
Jesus Christ.

1117
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,720
So the tide's turning a little.

1118
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:46,160
That's what's important.

1119
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,560
I think it's really important

1120
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:49,240
to frame this ride around that.

1121
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:50,480
Yeah, yeah.

1122
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:52,960
Because that's viewed as the,

1123
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:55,120
it's the inverse of the Leno Hugh Grant.

1124
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:57,600
The Tonigras always have these important moments

1125
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:59,800
that seal the deal or unseal the deal.

1126
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:02,040
And he was the king of nice and everybody loves it.

1127
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:04,360
And then in Trump world, he ruffles Trump's hair.

1128
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:06,760
And ever since then, people view him as like,

1129
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:09,200
not being a hard ass on politics

1130
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:10,960
and that's not really his comfort zone.

1131
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,320
It's just all been weird.

1132
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:14,680
And then I feel like during quarantine,

1133
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:16,280
he's the show we like again,

1134
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:17,920
because he's just having fun

1135
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:19,280
and we just want to be cheered up.

1136
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:21,520
But then Black Lives Matter and everything.

1137
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:22,560
And now he once again is like,

1138
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,280
not really equipped to handle the moment.

1139
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:25,720
It's like so back and forth.

1140
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:28,200
I mean, we'll get into this an hour five of the episode.

1141
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:29,360
There's a lot to unpack here.

1142
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:32,520
Jason, you seem like you're burning up to make some point.

1143
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:34,480
Well, I was gonna say like,

1144
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:38,000
in the scheme of our history,

1145
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,360
of podcast, the ride history,

1146
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:44,160
we started recording a few months after this ride started.

1147
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:46,920
But in the larger scheme of theme park history,

1148
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:50,000
this ride opens and on the West Coast,

1149
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,600
kind of within the same one, two month range,

1150
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:56,280
Guardians of the Galaxy opens, which is great.

1151
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:58,160
And I think we were,

1152
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:00,520
I was immediately impressed by probably the,

1153
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:04,000
maybe one of the best screens in a ride.

1154
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:04,840
Yeah.

1155
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:05,920
Maybe the best screen.

1156
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:07,720
Maybe the best.

1157
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:13,320
And replacing a more beloved attraction.

1158
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:19,280
So had a hurdle to overcome Guardians, I mean.

1159
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:20,920
And then on the East Coast,

1160
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:24,320
like this is what Universal rolled out in 2017.

1161
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:27,280
What did Disney roll out in Orlando in 2017?

1162
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:29,120
Pandora, the world of avatars.

1163
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:30,440
Yes.

1164
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:32,200
Wow. Very good context.

1165
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:33,040
Yes.

1166
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:34,680
Great context.

1167
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:35,960
But also Mission Breakout

1168
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:38,680
is a really interesting comparison point

1169
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:43,240
because the thing that impressed me most with that ride,

1170
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:46,440
which I went on finally for the first time about a year ago,

1171
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:50,160
is that it is funny.

1172
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:52,320
That it is consistently funny.

1173
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:57,080
That it has actual jokes that succeed on a thrill ride.

1174
00:47:57,080 --> 00:48:01,600
Like being on Guardians and hearing people laugh

1175
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:04,840
in between screams,

1176
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:07,440
I was like, I did not think this was possible.

1177
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:12,440
That you could engage a ride audience this way

1178
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:14,120
and be able to make them laugh

1179
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:15,600
in the middle of a thrill ride.

1180
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:19,360
Whereas if nothing else,

1181
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:21,600
race through New York should be funny, right?

1182
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:23,240
That should be their pitch.

1183
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:26,200
Is this is gonna be the funniest ride ever.

1184
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:29,960
I mean, that in theory is the competitive advantage

1185
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:32,000
you would get basing a ride,

1186
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,640
not around an animated family film,

1187
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:37,280
not around an action adventure film franchise,

1188
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:40,680
but around a personality based late night comedy show.

1189
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:44,440
In theory, the competitive advantage would be jokes, right?

1190
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:45,520
Yeah, you would, yes.

1191
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:47,880
You would think, and what ends up happening, I think,

1192
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:52,160
is that anything that's like a line that would be funny

1193
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:54,880
is said in the same manner that I think

1194
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:57,480
of the Patton Oswalt joke about when he does like ADR

1195
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:59,760
or adds jokes to animated movies,

1196
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:02,040
where he just writes jokes that happen off screen

1197
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:03,200
that are thrown away.

1198
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:06,040
Like just lines that come out,

1199
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:08,200
you can barely hear them and you're not sure

1200
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:09,720
and they don't land at all.

1201
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:11,360
Jammed into less than a second.

1202
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:12,600
Really quick and alts.

1203
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:15,160
The ride is so cacophonous.

1204
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:20,040
And Universal is known for like screams

1205
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:23,520
where you can get like there's laughs to release the tension.

1206
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:27,000
That is the thing that like in books about Universal,

1207
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,840
they talk about J-Pops, which are these,

1208
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:32,640
the feeling of like you're scared and then everyone laughs.

1209
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:34,080
Everyone shares a collective laugh

1210
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:36,080
because you release the tension.

1211
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:39,560
Named after Jay Stein, one of the early Universal,

1212
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:42,920
the head of Universal at the time, I think,

1213
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:46,200
when the first, when the Florida park opened.

1214
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:47,040
But like that-

1215
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:49,720
But yes, that was conventionally a strength of theirs.

1216
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:51,360
Yeah, that's a different thing though.

1217
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:53,600
You need it to be really intense

1218
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:56,720
and then you scare them with like a spray of water and stuff.

1219
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:59,080
I'm pretty sure there's a spray of water in this ride.

1220
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:00,200
I can't remember.

1221
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:02,800
I watched the ride through like five times

1222
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:06,600
and I just had to write it, the sequence down

1223
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:09,160
because it just was not sticking in my memory.

1224
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:10,600
It's really confusing.

1225
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:13,560
We, I showed a ride through to Erin

1226
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:14,800
since she didn't get to go on it.

1227
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:16,320
And she just kind of stared at it.

1228
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:18,640
And like, I couldn't tell you one thing that happens.

1229
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:22,600
It's just such a weird, it's all moving so quickly,

1230
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:24,960
which could seem like in conceiving it,

1231
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:26,560
they might feel like, and then you're over here

1232
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:27,680
and then you're over here and then you're over here.

1233
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:28,560
And that's a good thing.

1234
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:30,120
But I think it just adds up into,

1235
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:32,560
I don't really know what that was.

1236
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:36,600
It was just too much with no like beats and pauses.

1237
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:39,120
It's a lot of characters showing up,

1238
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:41,560
saying their catchphrase and then like,

1239
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:44,160
they're kind of blurry because it's moving so fast

1240
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:45,520
and then they're off screen.

1241
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,600
And that sort of doesn't really work

1242
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:51,200
with like more fleeting late night comedy character.

1243
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:54,480
Like as you said, it's kind of like constantly changing

1244
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:55,300
or forgotten about.

1245
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:57,520
It's not the same as like Arnold Schwarzenegger

1246
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:01,480
showing up as the Terminator and saying, I'll be back.

1247
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:03,520
Well, like a building blows up

1248
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:06,400
and the whole audience drops, you know?

1249
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:09,360
Or even if they had, sorry, I keep jumping.

1250
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:12,760
Even if they had, imagine if there was a ride

1251
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:17,000
of Saturday Night Live in like recurring character prime

1252
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:21,120
in 1993 and there's a ride where you meet Wayne's world

1253
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:24,480
and Hans and Franz and Church Lady and everybody.

1254
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:27,320
Like they would sort of, you kind of register

1255
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:29,000
who each of them were.

1256
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,680
Because I've seen all of these people five times or so.

1257
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:32,720
Late night characters, you just don't know as much.

1258
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:33,560
And then these characters,

1259
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:36,920
I don't think they use a lot of them a lot.

1260
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:39,200
There's a moment that I think kind of encapsulates

1261
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:40,800
what doesn't work for me about this, right?

1262
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:45,160
When he whizzes by a guy and he says, tight pants,

1263
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:46,080
tight as not land.

1264
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:48,040
And then you just keep moving.

1265
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:50,320
And I know what tight pants was.

1266
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:53,040
I know that's a bit he did with Will Ferrell,

1267
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:54,360
but when did he do it?

1268
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:55,720
And do they still do it?

1269
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:58,040
And did that really land?

1270
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:00,720
Does the audience know what tight pants is?

1271
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:02,440
So just to be tossing off all the,

1272
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:04,440
it's like you're watching a time capsule

1273
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:08,320
of a late night show during one particular week years ago.

1274
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:09,480
And then it's all nonsense.

1275
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:11,480
Like if it was shows just like,

1276
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:13,680
hey, look, it's a senior strawberry.

1277
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:14,600
Okay, gotta go.

1278
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:16,200
But wait, who's senior strawberry?

1279
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:17,960
That's, do they do that anymore?

1280
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:19,800
Yeah, you don't.

1281
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:21,000
Just reads as nonsense.

1282
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,320
You don't get it.

1283
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:23,760
You would think it would get a beat

1284
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:27,720
to show the audience the magic of tight pants.

1285
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:30,960
Get teachers who are tight pants is.

1286
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:31,800
Yeah, yeah.

1287
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:34,120
Oh, the Snapchat snake, look out.

1288
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:39,120
This is the infinity war of Jimmy Fallon characters.

1289
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:42,200
We wanna actually at least get a little moments

1290
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:45,360
and appreciate them more than just kind of waving at them

1291
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:46,640
and going by.

1292
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,520
Can we zoom out for a second?

1293
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:51,360
Of course.

1294
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:53,800
I have some bigger points I wanna get to,

1295
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:55,680
but I feel like we need to lay a little runway

1296
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:57,360
to get to them.

1297
00:52:57,360 --> 00:53:00,560
I feel like this ride is very much the byproduct

1298
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:03,120
of a thing you guys have talked about a lot on your show,

1299
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:05,320
which is universal sort of like,

1300
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:08,360
we need to look at everything in our portfolio

1301
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:11,000
and take acts, make the most,

1302
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,520
like use every part of the buffalo,

1303
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:15,680
in some way incorporate our access

1304
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:17,640
to everything that is valuable.

1305
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:19,840
So I feel like this born stunt show

1306
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:23,080
that's about to open whenever anything is able

1307
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:24,360
to open again.

1308
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:25,440
Oh, it's open.

1309
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:26,320
It's open now?

1310
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:27,520
Yeah, it's open.

1311
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:30,960
It officially opened earlier this week,

1312
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:33,280
end of June as we record this.

1313
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:34,760
That is insane.

1314
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:35,600
Yes.

1315
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:37,680
That is absolutely insane.

1316
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:40,640
There's no better place though to catch the virus

1317
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:43,200
than in a brand new theme park attraction.

1318
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:44,720
No, they can give you some chems

1319
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:47,280
to neutralize the effect of the virus.

1320
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:49,240
I assume the born stunt show is mostly about

1321
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:50,360
the born legacy, right?

1322
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:51,280
The Jeremy Renner film,

1323
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:53,240
it's all about him injecting himself with chems.

1324
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:55,160
Yes, the longest worst one.

1325
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:56,400
That's right.

1326
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,760
I'm hearing it's great by the way.

1327
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:00,800
Yeah, the show is supposed to be amazing.

1328
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:02,280
We are hearing a lot of good things

1329
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:06,360
and podcast ride will cover it in seven years.

1330
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:07,760
A really long time.

1331
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:09,360
Absolutely sure it is great,

1332
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:12,880
but it's also one of those things where when I feel like,

1333
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:14,480
I feel like when it got announced,

1334
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:17,720
everyone said, is anyone asking for that?

1335
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:20,040
And even in the days that it was circling as a rumor,

1336
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:22,280
like when Matt Rogers said on your show,

1337
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:23,680
like I have it on good authority,

1338
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:26,600
everyone was like, is there any demand for that?

1339
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:28,920
Well, Jason was the one who was excited.

1340
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:29,760
I am the one.

1341
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:31,840
I love those movies.

1342
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:34,080
The only way I could have been more excited

1343
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:38,000
is if they said, it's gonna be a now you see me stunt show.

1344
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:40,840
Which honestly-

1345
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:43,440
Which I'll say, makes a little more sense

1346
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:46,120
because there's a franchise based around performance

1347
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:49,080
and stunts and live audience interaction.

1348
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:51,440
Huge popular internationally.

1349
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:52,760
Then now you see me movies.

1350
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:55,240
They get a lot of international tourists.

1351
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:56,760
Yes.

1352
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:59,560
Wow, I get to see Arthur Tressler today.

1353
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:03,040
It's my favorite pal from the movies, Arthur Tressler.

1354
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:04,280
Arthur Tressler.

1355
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:05,840
Henry Reeves.

1356
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:08,680
I just, I feel like there's something

1357
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:12,640
that sort of binds together the Fallon ride,

1358
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:16,800
the Bourne stunt show and the secret life of Pets ride,

1359
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:19,120
which is just universal,

1360
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:23,280
not looking at anything other than recent numbers

1361
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:26,400
and being like, if we have something that's popping,

1362
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:29,720
it is a waste to not be putting it in the parks

1363
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:32,880
without that much thought of how long

1364
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:34,840
that demand is gonna last

1365
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:38,160
or whether or not it's a good fit for a theme park.

1366
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:40,480
Where even though like, who knows?

1367
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:42,560
Maybe the Bourne stunt show will end up

1368
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:44,320
being the next water world

1369
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:46,080
and will take on a life of its own

1370
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:48,000
and will become valuable in a way

1371
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,360
that grows way past the movies.

1372
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:53,960
But I do think, hmm, that's a franchise

1373
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:56,360
that does not have a lot of iconography,

1374
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:58,800
that is mostly known for its central performance

1375
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:00,480
by a humongous movie star.

1376
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:04,040
And it's very, very specific filmmaking sensibility

1377
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:05,360
from Paul Greengrass,

1378
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:06,920
which you're not gonna be able to replicate

1379
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:08,720
in a live stunt show.

1380
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:12,040
It is terse, it is sort of like spare,

1381
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:13,640
it's stripped down,

1382
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:16,360
it's very like muscular kind of filmmaking.

1383
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:18,520
It's not something that translates that much

1384
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:21,280
in my mind's eye to a stunt show.

1385
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:23,720
And I am fully ready to believe

1386
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:25,480
that the stunt show works on its own.

1387
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:28,000
But it has the same kind of timing

1388
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,600
of the Secret Life of Pets ride opening

1389
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:34,040
right after the second movie greatly underperforms

1390
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:35,880
because now you have a Bourne stunt show

1391
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:38,000
where Universal, when they talk about it,

1392
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,720
they say, look, it's a billion dollar franchise.

1393
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:42,120
And apparently that was the initiative.

1394
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:45,440
They said, if anything has made a billion dollars for us

1395
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:47,720
and it's not in the parks, we need to reassess that.

1396
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:50,360
We need to find some way to put it in for us.

1397
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:53,120
And so Bourne, they go, that's a billion franchise.

1398
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:54,680
But you're discounting the fact

1399
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:57,120
that the last most recent Bourne movie

1400
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:59,440
was the lowest grossing Bourne movie,

1401
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:03,040
I believe even lower grossing than the Jeremy Renner one,

1402
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:06,280
the one where Matt Damon returned was another dip.

1403
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:08,120
And then they did a Bourne TV show

1404
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:11,120
and that also got canceled within one season.

1405
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:13,880
And then you time that out to the Jimmy Fallon ride

1406
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:17,920
which comes out six months after he ruffles Trump's hair.

1407
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:21,160
And it just kind of shows like there is a sort of

1408
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:23,400
protectiveness and long-term thinking

1409
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:25,880
to most installations in a theme park,

1410
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:28,200
be they a full ride, be they a live show,

1411
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:31,320
be they even putting a costumed character in there

1412
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:34,200
where there really seems to be some forward thinking of like,

1413
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:38,000
how long is this gonna stay in people's good graces?

1414
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:41,600
And when it evaporates, is the thing still gonna have value

1415
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:44,600
on its own even if this particular brand

1416
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:46,360
dwindles a little bit?

1417
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:47,800
Yes, I mean, that's completely true.

1418
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:51,160
I think that Universal, to give them a little credit,

1419
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:52,800
has been building faster.

1420
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:55,160
I think a lot of times, except for Guardians,

1421
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:57,960
Disney takes a long time to make something,

1422
00:57:57,960 --> 00:57:59,920
like Star Wars Land took forever

1423
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:01,920
and they threw out plans.

1424
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:03,960
And I guess the good thing about Universal,

1425
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:05,920
it does seem like they're willing to pull the trigger

1426
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:10,920
on something, but perhaps it's not all gonna be Nintendo Land,

1427
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:13,720
which I assume is something that will,

1428
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:16,480
Nintendo is gonna be popular for the rest of our lives.

1429
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:19,520
I can't imagine a scenario where that's not gonna be fun

1430
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:21,320
to see Mario, but-

1431
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:22,160
And I think-

1432
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:24,320
It's part and parcel with the too many screens complain

1433
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:26,040
about Universal, because you have to think

1434
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:29,560
that part of that is giving themselves the back door,

1435
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:33,080
the modularity, how easy it is for them to re-theme things,

1436
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:36,120
that it's just about filming with the actual actors.

1437
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:37,280
Really, I love it.

1438
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:39,480
For whatever is popular that year.

1439
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:42,320
That's where this ride slots in in my memory.

1440
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:44,400
And I do have to correct myself by the way,

1441
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:47,000
the term is J-Bangs, not J-Pops.

1442
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,080
Oh boy. Anyway,

1443
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:52,120
what I was starting to say, this ride slots in with me,

1444
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:55,400
I think there is a run of Universal rides,

1445
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:58,640
of screen-based rides that are not going to age well.

1446
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:03,640
And I lump this in with this,

1447
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:08,200
Fast and Furious, just out the gate people,

1448
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:09,760
were not big on.

1449
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:12,560
I don't think Simpsons is gonna age well,

1450
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:14,480
and Transformers either.

1451
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:17,240
Like the screen looks worse and worse on Transformers

1452
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:18,360
as the years go on.

1453
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:22,880
And I wanna say I am not anti like big screen,

1454
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:27,440
because I love Despicable Me, Minion Mayhem.

1455
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:28,840
I think it's delightful.

1456
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:30,960
I think it's got a heartwarming message.

1457
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:32,080
It's nice.

1458
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:33,640
It's a nice ride.

1459
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:34,480
Love it.

1460
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:37,000
Because I am always the one who's like,

1461
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,040
well, what do we do now?

1462
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:39,440
Well, we go on Minion Mayhem.

1463
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:42,120
I think it's fun.

1464
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:45,200
That said, I think part of the thing,

1465
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:48,160
Universal's baggage that they have to deal with,

1466
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:53,160
is that from the start of the Orlando park,

1467
00:59:53,560 --> 00:59:56,440
I mean, at the time they were owned by MCA,

1468
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:58,520
and then they were owned by Seagrams,

1469
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:00,960
and then they were owned by Vivendi,

1470
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:04,800
and then they were owned by GE,

1471
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:06,720
and then Comcast.

1472
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:10,040
Like it's just a string of ownerships.

1473
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:13,200
And I think that probably contributes to some of like

1474
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:14,920
the confusing decisions.

1475
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:18,040
Certainly the tourism downturn after 9-11

1476
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:20,120
affected a lot of projects.

1477
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:24,520
And this one is especially odd.

1478
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:26,640
I think you are right in there,

1479
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:29,520
just going through the portfolio and see what they have.

1480
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:30,360
But if you go-

1481
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:31,200
Well, it's like the Today Show Cafe.

1482
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:33,040
It's like, people love the Today Show,

1483
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:35,320
look at these ratings, why wouldn't we make a cafe?

1484
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:38,400
And it's like, because people watching the Today Show

1485
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:41,160
does not equate to them wanting to eat an omelet there.

1486
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:44,480
It's not a walk that people are making.

1487
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:46,440
It's Mr. Show coupon the movie.

1488
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:49,440
Everybody used the coupon, why aren't they seeing the movie?

1489
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:51,680
Right, and the Fallon ride is a perfect example

1490
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:52,960
of that for me, where it's like,

1491
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:56,640
look, he's not my guy, but I know people like him.

1492
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:58,880
I know there are people who love that show.

1493
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:01,360
I don't know what the overlap is between the people

1494
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:03,280
who love that show and love theme parks.

1495
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:06,360
And even if you get to that overlap in the Venn diagram,

1496
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:08,240
I don't know the people who are begging them

1497
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:10,480
to combine those two things.

1498
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:11,400
Sure, yeah.

1499
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:12,240
I think there's a big,

1500
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:13,920
I might not have the right words here.

1501
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:16,520
There's a difference between things being popular

1502
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:21,200
and money makers and entering the hearts of the public

1503
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:22,360
or entering, like what's the word,

1504
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:26,320
public consciousness or, I don't know,

1505
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:28,760
which I think is what Disney is so concerned with.

1506
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:31,040
Like what they need, they're not gonna put a ride in,

1507
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:33,560
usually, unless they really feel like people have fallen

1508
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:36,040
in love with these characters in this world

1509
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:38,120
and they'll wait a long time to make sure

1510
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:40,560
that they feel like that's happened significantly enough.

1511
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:43,960
I feel like Minions and Guardians are two examples

1512
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:47,120
of rides that got done pretty quickly

1513
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:48,560
that were correct calls.

1514
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:50,120
I think in both of those cases,

1515
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:52,120
those were fundamentally correct calls

1516
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:56,560
and these things seem to have firmly entrenched themselves

1517
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:58,480
in pop culture.

1518
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:01,400
Who knows how people are gonna feel 20 years from now,

1519
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:04,480
but Groot feels like a fairly safe investment.

1520
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:07,800
The Minions themselves feel like a fairly safe investment.

1521
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:10,440
They didn't need to wait for six of those movies.

1522
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:12,920
They didn't need to wait for the 20th anniversary

1523
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:14,960
to make sure it was still sticking around.

1524
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:18,080
It feels like those things were properly judged.

1525
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:20,520
And even something like Avatar,

1526
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:25,120
I am very much with Mike and being an Avatar defender.

1527
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:26,760
I know people like to say it's insane

1528
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:28,320
they invested this much money in this movie

1529
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:30,160
that everyone's already forgotten.

1530
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:31,400
You haven't forgotten it.

1531
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:32,680
You keep on bringing it up.

1532
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:33,760
If you had forgotten it,

1533
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:35,560
you wouldn't keep on trying to make the point

1534
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:36,840
that people have forgotten it.

1535
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:41,840
But it is one of those things where the world of Pandora

1536
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:43,320
works on its own.

1537
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:46,440
Like it is an impressive theme park attraction.

1538
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:48,640
People who have never seen the movie

1539
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:51,360
can enjoy everything that happens there.

1540
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:56,560
The banality of even if it is an important building

1541
01:02:56,560 --> 01:02:58,360
in show business history,

1542
01:02:58,360 --> 01:03:01,800
and even if New York City is a very glamorous city,

1543
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:05,680
or at least portions of it are pre-pandemic,

1544
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:09,800
it still feels like we're finally now our state of the art,

1545
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:12,760
our team at Universal,

1546
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:15,800
they're putting the greatest minds, the greatest resources,

1547
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:18,040
millions and millions and millions of dollars

1548
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:21,360
into recreating a building in Midtown Manhattan,

1549
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:23,440
where you're going to be able to experience

1550
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:27,320
being in the audience of a TV show taping.

1551
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:30,680
And as Jason says, the way to do this feels

1552
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:34,760
a little bit more like the way they use Jimmy Fallon

1553
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:36,280
on the studio tour,

1554
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:39,800
where it's like Fallon just wants to be America's best friend.

1555
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:43,360
He wants to be the guy who's like the happy fun time guy,

1556
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:45,720
who's impossible to dislike

1557
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:48,200
and is just excited about everything.

1558
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:52,520
And that persona can map pretty easily onto him doing

1559
01:03:52,520 --> 01:03:55,280
a handful of videos on the studio tour,

1560
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:58,120
where he's walking you through the magic of movies

1561
01:03:58,120 --> 01:03:59,960
and how things are made different.

1562
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:03,720
And now he's a Western guy, and now he's a sailor or whatever.

1563
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:07,160
And I like the tour videos,

1564
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:08,840
having worked there and suffered through

1565
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:10,760
the Whoopi Goldberg material,

1566
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:14,000
the Jimmy Fallon overlay I think is a vast improvement.

1567
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:19,880
And I also just feel like that's using Fallon

1568
01:04:20,560 --> 01:04:24,480
to some greater end and also sort of weaponizing

1569
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:25,880
what he's good at.

1570
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:29,760
They don't re-theme it as the Jimmy Fallon tour.

1571
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:32,480
It's the studio tour featuring Jimmy Fallon,

1572
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:35,560
whereas this ride is the Jimmy Fallon ride.

1573
01:04:35,560 --> 01:04:37,880
It may be called Race Through New York,

1574
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:41,040
starring Jimmy Fallon, but the entire thing

1575
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:45,720
is built around his persona, him as a brand,

1576
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:48,760
and by extension, the brand of his show,

1577
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:51,680
which I think we've all been sort of talking around.

1578
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:56,000
The show does not have much of an identity at all

1579
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:00,360
removed from whoever his guest is at that moment.

1580
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:02,240
I feel like when I,

1581
01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:04,000
cause I wanna make it clear,

1582
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,160
I'm not like trying to imply that Jimmy Fallon

1583
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:09,200
is a serial killer who has bodies stashed in his basement.

1584
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:11,680
I don't feel like there's some reckoning coming

1585
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:13,880
for Jimmy Fallon, but everyone I know

1586
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:16,280
who's worked on that show has sort of said like,

1587
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:20,160
yeah, he's not like this super happy, fun, loving,

1588
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:23,520
like super amenable guy that is very much a persona.

1589
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:25,160
That is the show he wants to do.

1590
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:28,040
It is like he is like a children's TV show host.

1591
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:29,480
He wants to be friendly.

1592
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:33,360
He wants to be positive and enthusiastic about everything.

1593
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:37,200
But in real life, he's like, oh, that's so bad.

1594
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:39,040
He wants it all.

1595
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:41,040
He's like Garfield in real life.

1596
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:44,360
When he was starting doing the show,

1597
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:46,680
his first show, the Conan show,

1598
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:49,840
I was like, oh, it's like Regis does impressions.

1599
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:51,320
Yes.

1600
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:52,920
Wait, you mean on late night

1601
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:56,560
when he took over the previous, the 1230?

1602
01:05:56,560 --> 01:05:59,360
Which I liked, I liked the 1230 show more.

1603
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:01,960
I agree, that's what I said too at the time.

1604
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:05,040
I was like, well, it's not being like as subversive

1605
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:06,360
or weird maybe as Conan,

1606
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:11,120
but it's kind of a straight ahead variety show.

1607
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:13,680
That's very poppy and full of music and genre parody.

1608
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:16,160
I might say that I specifically liked the show.

1609
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:17,680
And obviously late night with Conan

1610
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:20,200
was more my comedy sensibility, but I like,

1611
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:21,720
they did something different.

1612
01:06:21,720 --> 01:06:22,800
They went a different direction

1613
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:24,960
and are getting a whole new audience and updating it.

1614
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:26,880
And I think they did it successfully.

1615
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:28,720
My immediate takeaway was like,

1616
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:31,560
I still don't think I would have picked Jimmy Fallon

1617
01:06:31,560 --> 01:06:32,400
to host this.

1618
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:34,920
I'm not a huge fan of him as a host,

1619
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:37,200
but this show is well produced.

1620
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:38,640
Like on a basic level, you're like,

1621
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:42,360
it's cool that the roots are the musical backing band.

1622
01:06:42,360 --> 01:06:43,200
Yeah, they're great.

1623
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:45,160
And incorporate them into the show and the set is cool

1624
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:46,400
and it has a good vibe.

1625
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:48,800
And he hired good writers and A.D. Miles.

1626
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:52,520
The thing had a kind of cool sense of style to it.

1627
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:57,240
But I feel like more so than you look at Letterman

1628
01:06:57,240 --> 01:06:59,480
or you look at Conan in particular,

1629
01:06:59,480 --> 01:07:01,560
and I just, every time I engage

1630
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:03,360
with any element of this ride,

1631
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:06,840
I think about Conan because it feels like this ride

1632
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:11,840
is Fallon wishing his show had the type of reputation

1633
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:15,560
and relationship that Conan did.

1634
01:07:15,560 --> 01:07:18,680
Where Conan had like proprietary bits.

1635
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:23,120
He had characters, he had runners that lasted for years

1636
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:25,240
that are still popular today.

1637
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:27,560
You know, he had members of the writing staff

1638
01:07:27,560 --> 01:07:28,760
who he could incorporate,

1639
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:31,120
who they could like make into merchandise.

1640
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:34,480
So like you're entering this crazy cartoon world

1641
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:37,160
with Triumph and the Masturbating Bear

1642
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:40,720
and these bizarre thin characters like FedEx Pope.

1643
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:42,440
And it's, yeah, you have a set,

1644
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:44,520
I know what Late Night with Conan is.

1645
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:48,000
It's this world of dumb, colorful characters.

1646
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,320
And when I enter it, it's a vibe.

1647
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:51,640
It's a universe I'm entering.

1648
01:07:51,640 --> 01:07:52,480
It's a vibe.

1649
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:54,320
It feels like there's a cohesive universe there.

1650
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:58,960
And as Jason said, they used to fucking sell a $30 VHS

1651
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:02,000
that was you pretending to drive his desk for five minutes.

1652
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:03,720
And people lined up to do it.

1653
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:06,880
Like that was part of the show.

1654
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:10,440
That they would pretend that the desk had wheels

1655
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:12,360
and he could drive it around New York City

1656
01:08:12,360 --> 01:08:13,800
and into funny environments.

1657
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:17,000
It is very bizarre that this ride essentially tries

1658
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:20,320
to do the same thing despite that never having been part

1659
01:08:20,320 --> 01:08:23,240
of either Late Night show that Jimmy Fallon has hosted.

1660
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:26,000
And there's something, I'm sorry, I keep cutting you off.

1661
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,920
There's something about that you're driving,

1662
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:31,000
it's silly that you're driving a desk around.

1663
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:31,840
That's funny.

1664
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:34,280
And then you cut to the humorless tonight writer,

1665
01:08:34,280 --> 01:08:36,600
which is just like, it's cool is what it is.

1666
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:38,280
It's the coolest shit in the world.

1667
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:39,840
What were you gonna say, Jason?

1668
01:08:39,840 --> 01:08:44,320
Well, I was gonna say like the other, like jaywalking.

1669
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:46,480
That was another bit like that.

1670
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:50,480
I feel like they would do like on studio tours

1671
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:52,560
or like they'd have a little jaywalking thing

1672
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:55,360
in the gift shops at NBC locations.

1673
01:08:56,600 --> 01:09:00,720
I think, you know, that the thing that not to immediate,

1674
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:02,520
like here's how to improve the ride,

1675
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:05,120
but yeah, people go to New York.

1676
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:08,080
So that's like not like this crazy thing.

1677
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:10,320
People have been to New York City.

1678
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:14,560
And anyway, it abandons that premise so quickly.

1679
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:16,480
It heightens so quickly out of that.

1680
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:19,360
But you know what a lot of people do not experience

1681
01:09:19,360 --> 01:09:21,960
in their lifetime that could be fun to simulate?

1682
01:09:21,960 --> 01:09:24,480
Being a guest on the Tonight Show.

1683
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:27,800
Yes, just make the ride should have just been,

1684
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:30,000
you are a guest of the Tonight Show.

1685
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:33,280
You stand behind the curtain and then you get Murray.

1686
01:09:33,280 --> 01:09:35,640
You get to meet Murray.

1687
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:37,160
Right, right, you're like, should this ride

1688
01:09:37,160 --> 01:09:42,080
just be a fucking kiosk where it's just a green screen space

1689
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:43,760
where you get to act it out?

1690
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:45,920
Should it be Jimmy Fallon tours you

1691
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:48,040
through the history of television?

1692
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:52,040
Should it be just a New York based ride

1693
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:54,520
that happens to star Jimmy Fallon?

1694
01:09:54,520 --> 01:09:56,760
But instead, and I feel like I don't know

1695
01:09:56,760 --> 01:09:58,520
how much of this is true.

1696
01:09:58,520 --> 01:10:02,280
Fallon says that at the moment he got the job

1697
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:06,080
hosting the late night, not even Tonight Show,

1698
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:08,840
that he was like, man, Universal, such a big company.

1699
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:10,920
Like I wanna be such a big company, man.

1700
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:12,840
Like I wanna take advantage of all these different things

1701
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:14,080
that Universal has.

1702
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:17,080
And he went and pitched to them a ride

1703
01:10:17,080 --> 01:10:19,840
and they were like, you've been on air a week.

1704
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:22,280
We're not gonna do a ride around you.

1705
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:24,360
You don't do rides around TV shows.

1706
01:10:24,360 --> 01:10:26,160
You don't do them around real people.

1707
01:10:26,160 --> 01:10:27,880
Like all the things we're talking about

1708
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:30,240
about how much a brand has to prove itself

1709
01:10:30,240 --> 01:10:31,920
before it can become a ride.

1710
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:34,920
And then something changed within those six years

1711
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:37,880
and they were like, screw it, we're doing your ride.

1712
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:39,920
And it feels like the ride that got made

1713
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:44,220
is very much a ride that Jimmy Fallon would have pitched.

1714
01:10:44,220 --> 01:10:47,560
Like this feels like the thing I could imagine him pitching

1715
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:51,480
like within the first six months of him hosting late night

1716
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:54,120
to a bunch of Universal creative executives

1717
01:10:54,120 --> 01:10:56,960
and not a bunch of Universal creative executives

1718
01:10:56,960 --> 01:10:58,360
being given the assignment,

1719
01:10:58,360 --> 01:11:01,040
how do we use Jimmy Fallon in a ride?

1720
01:11:03,200 --> 01:11:04,240
It's interesting.

1721
01:11:04,240 --> 01:11:08,040
I could see it in the broad strokes him pitching it,

1722
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:11,240
but I don't know because one of my things about this ride

1723
01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:15,300
is that Universal just takes everything they've ever done

1724
01:11:15,300 --> 01:11:18,820
in a 3D movie or a screen ride

1725
01:11:18,820 --> 01:11:21,540
and makes a worse version of it for this.

1726
01:11:21,540 --> 01:11:22,540
Oh yeah.

1727
01:11:22,540 --> 01:11:24,660
There's one beat in this ride

1728
01:11:24,660 --> 01:11:27,620
that makes me legitimately angry of like,

1729
01:11:27,620 --> 01:11:29,420
no, you can't do that.

1730
01:11:29,420 --> 01:11:34,420
You cannot just copy a beat from a ride you opened

1731
01:11:34,740 --> 01:11:36,420
like nine years ago.

1732
01:11:36,420 --> 01:11:38,820
You cannot just copy it exactly.

1733
01:11:38,820 --> 01:11:40,940
Doesn't that just feel like desperation?

1734
01:11:40,940 --> 01:11:44,380
Like them trying to throw anything exciting into this ride?

1735
01:11:44,380 --> 01:11:45,500
It feels like that,

1736
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:49,380
but it also feels like a homework assignment that's due.

1737
01:11:49,380 --> 01:11:52,180
It feels like we have a month to do this.

1738
01:11:52,180 --> 01:11:53,740
What do we know we can do?

1739
01:11:53,740 --> 01:11:56,220
Okay, something attaches to a vehicle.

1740
01:11:56,220 --> 01:11:59,100
They fly through the city like on Transformers.

1741
01:11:59,100 --> 01:12:00,580
There's a roller coaster at the end

1742
01:12:00,580 --> 01:12:02,460
that goes down like Simpsons.

1743
01:12:02,460 --> 01:12:03,900
I don't know, okay.

1744
01:12:03,900 --> 01:12:06,220
Throw a character in the middle.

1745
01:12:06,220 --> 01:12:07,060
You're right.

1746
01:12:07,060 --> 01:12:08,940
It's very Universal bag of tricks.

1747
01:12:08,940 --> 01:12:11,640
And I think maybe that's the more disappointing aspect

1748
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:16,280
than like, it doesn't feel like a lot of original

1749
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:18,320
Fallon specific inventions.

1750
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:19,880
It feels like he threw them a premise

1751
01:12:19,880 --> 01:12:22,440
and then they kind of did their Universal things.

1752
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:25,120
And we end up with, it's not the best of either world.

1753
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:29,840
Because what even would the Fallon specific inventions be?

1754
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:31,200
Like it feels like he's saying,

1755
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:33,840
let's make a ride out of my show,

1756
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:36,840
but the show he's presenting here is very different

1757
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:38,440
than the show he has.

1758
01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:40,560
I'm not being literal minded about like,

1759
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:42,840
the Tonight Show never happens on the moon.

1760
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:46,080
I'm saying like, his show does not have a lot of characters.

1761
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:49,000
And this is a ride designed with the confidence of,

1762
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,100
we have so many recurring characters

1763
01:12:51,100 --> 01:12:53,640
that audiences will be excited to see again.

1764
01:12:53,640 --> 01:12:56,720
And that's just fundamentally not what the show is.

1765
01:12:56,720 --> 01:13:00,040
The show is, as you said, primarily at this point,

1766
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:01,180
a variety show.

1767
01:13:01,180 --> 01:13:03,380
It is closer to a game show

1768
01:13:03,380 --> 01:13:05,680
than it is to a traditional comedy based,

1769
01:13:05,680 --> 01:13:06,920
late night talk show.

1770
01:13:06,920 --> 01:13:08,460
And it is so much based around

1771
01:13:08,500 --> 01:13:10,580
whatever celebrity has on with him

1772
01:13:10,580 --> 01:13:13,020
and doing a segment that plays to their strengths.

1773
01:13:13,020 --> 01:13:13,860
You know?

1774
01:13:13,860 --> 01:13:16,980
If their impressions are letting them play a character

1775
01:13:16,980 --> 01:13:19,700
or letting them play beer pong or whatever.

1776
01:13:19,700 --> 01:13:23,340
There's very little stuff that's proprietary in house

1777
01:13:23,340 --> 01:13:25,360
to a Jimmy Fallon late night show

1778
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:28,100
that makes sense to avoid of whoever is on the couch

1779
01:13:28,100 --> 01:13:28,920
that night.

1780
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:30,740
Well, I can imagine yours like Tony Baxter

1781
01:13:30,740 --> 01:13:32,520
or something talking about Indiana Jones.

1782
01:13:32,520 --> 01:13:35,540
Like what would a person want from Indiana Jones?

1783
01:13:35,580 --> 01:13:36,860
Well, you want the boulder.

1784
01:13:36,860 --> 01:13:38,780
You want some sort of temple.

1785
01:13:38,780 --> 01:13:41,520
It's like, these are the experiences you would crave.

1786
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:44,220
And it's like, it's partly because I don't watch

1787
01:13:44,220 --> 01:13:45,460
the Tonight Show that much,

1788
01:13:45,460 --> 01:13:47,340
but it's like, there's not a lot

1789
01:13:47,340 --> 01:13:49,700
other than being a guest on the show

1790
01:13:49,700 --> 01:13:50,540
that you could imagine.

1791
01:13:50,540 --> 01:13:52,900
With Conan, which of course I know the universe better,

1792
01:13:52,900 --> 01:13:56,140
I could imagine where part of it's a janky desk thing

1793
01:13:56,140 --> 01:13:57,020
where you're driving it.

1794
01:13:57,020 --> 01:13:59,660
Part of it's the staring contest.

1795
01:13:59,660 --> 01:14:03,060
Part of it's in the year 2000.

1796
01:14:03,060 --> 01:14:03,900
There were both.

1797
01:14:03,900 --> 01:14:04,900
The thing fucking writes itself.

1798
01:14:05,100 --> 01:14:07,940
Frankenstein could waste 15 seconds of your time

1799
01:14:07,940 --> 01:14:11,100
leading you down the back hallways

1800
01:14:11,100 --> 01:14:12,740
in a high speed pursuit.

1801
01:14:12,740 --> 01:14:14,740
Oh, what a delight.

1802
01:14:14,740 --> 01:14:16,660
A really boring 15 seconds.

1803
01:14:16,660 --> 01:14:17,500
That's great.

1804
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:20,020
And you could see the staring contest.

1805
01:14:20,020 --> 01:14:22,080
You put the camera on the audience

1806
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:23,740
with people in the audience

1807
01:14:23,740 --> 01:14:25,620
and then play it against a video

1808
01:14:25,620 --> 01:14:27,820
and that'll get a laugh just like the rebel spy.

1809
01:14:27,820 --> 01:14:28,660
He built out a universe.

1810
01:14:28,660 --> 01:14:29,940
We all know.

1811
01:14:29,940 --> 01:14:33,820
Yes, maybe this is for white men of the exact age

1812
01:14:33,820 --> 01:14:37,860
to value the peak of Conan O'Brien more than anyone.

1813
01:14:37,860 --> 01:14:41,460
Older, not even just millennials, like older millennials.

1814
01:14:41,460 --> 01:14:42,860
Precisely the audience.

1815
01:14:42,860 --> 01:14:45,100
Aging millennials.

1816
01:14:45,100 --> 01:14:46,260
Aging millennials.

1817
01:14:46,260 --> 01:14:47,100
Yes.

1818
01:14:47,100 --> 01:14:48,420
That's a new tagline for our show.

1819
01:14:48,420 --> 01:14:50,420
Oh, aging millennials.

1820
01:14:50,420 --> 01:14:51,260
Sure, sure, sure.

1821
01:14:51,260 --> 01:14:52,380
Aging millennials.

1822
01:14:52,380 --> 01:14:53,620
All right, we saw that.

1823
01:14:53,620 --> 01:14:55,700
Poorly aging millennials.

1824
01:14:55,700 --> 01:14:57,900
I mean, look, we are the four guys

1825
01:14:57,900 --> 01:15:00,500
who are like most equipped to blue sky

1826
01:15:00,500 --> 01:15:02,180
all the cool things that could happen

1827
01:15:02,180 --> 01:15:04,420
on a 1998 Conan ride,

1828
01:15:04,420 --> 01:15:06,820
including someone who used to work for Conan.

1829
01:15:06,820 --> 01:15:11,540
But still the point is there are possibilities there.

1830
01:15:11,540 --> 01:15:14,460
And then you look at this ride and it's like,

1831
01:15:14,460 --> 01:15:16,260
I remember them promoting it with like

1832
01:15:16,260 --> 01:15:18,700
all your favorite recurring characters are gonna be there.

1833
01:15:18,700 --> 01:15:22,020
And I was like, I don't watch this show that regularly,

1834
01:15:22,020 --> 01:15:24,100
but I'm pretty confident

1835
01:15:24,100 --> 01:15:26,220
there aren't popular recurring characters.

1836
01:15:26,220 --> 01:15:27,860
And then you get on the ride

1837
01:15:27,860 --> 01:15:31,360
and it's Jimmy Fallon appearing nine different times.

1838
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:35,240
Three of them are characters created just for this ride.

1839
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:36,600
Wouldn't it be funny if he's also

1840
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:38,720
the train conductor or whatever.

1841
01:15:38,720 --> 01:15:42,000
But then also it's like a couple of AD Miles,

1842
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:45,160
which is already out of date by the time this ride opens

1843
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:47,440
or shortly thereafter he leaves the show.

1844
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:51,040
So he's never appearing as these characters ever again.

1845
01:15:51,040 --> 01:15:53,160
He's not gonna be in 2020 reminding people

1846
01:15:53,160 --> 01:15:56,760
who Gary the dad of EU is.

1847
01:15:56,760 --> 01:15:59,520
Right, right, Gary's not a thing.

1848
01:15:59,560 --> 01:16:03,000
No one is like invested in Gary the dad of EU.

1849
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:06,360
And EU mostly exists as an excuse to have whoever's

1850
01:16:06,360 --> 01:16:09,280
the guest that night also put on a wig and braces

1851
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:12,160
and do a very reductive impression of an 11 year old girl.

1852
01:16:12,160 --> 01:16:15,760
EU on her own doesn't really mean anything.

1853
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:17,920
Let's go ahead Mike.

1854
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:22,120
Who would be better in like the Disney MGM studios

1855
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:24,180
where you bring up some people from the audience

1856
01:16:24,180 --> 01:16:25,600
and put the braces on them.

1857
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:26,480
Absolutely.

1858
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:28,680
That would go over huge and you'd go,

1859
01:16:28,680 --> 01:16:32,080
well I can't argue with this seeing mom in braces.

1860
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:35,840
Oh, seeing dad, seeing dad with a wig in braces

1861
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:37,400
makes the audience lose their minds.

1862
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:40,440
So should this show be some kind of thing where like,

1863
01:16:40,440 --> 01:16:42,780
it's not that we're not at a tonight show taping,

1864
01:16:42,780 --> 01:16:45,440
but we're like, it should be like what Nickelodeon studios

1865
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:48,800
did we're at the lab, we're testing some new Jimmy Fallon

1866
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:50,280
bits and games.

1867
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:52,520
Why don't you do a screen test as EU?

1868
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:54,320
Why we're gonna try out one of these games

1869
01:16:54,320 --> 01:16:56,440
because he does very double there kind of,

1870
01:16:56,440 --> 01:16:59,040
and then he's in it through videos saying,

1871
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:00,180
hey, great job with that one.

1872
01:17:00,180 --> 01:17:02,160
Now your next assignment and it's like,

1873
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:03,920
probably the characters still factor in.

1874
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:05,240
It's all the same stuff, but not,

1875
01:17:05,240 --> 01:17:06,880
maybe not making it a ride.

1876
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:07,960
It should be like that.

1877
01:17:07,960 --> 01:17:10,320
Or it should be like the American Idol experience

1878
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:12,640
or any of these fucking things that they usually do

1879
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:13,800
with TV.

1880
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:14,640
With some characters.

1881
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:16,880
Or not characters.

1882
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:19,060
Some actors get some cameos in there.

1883
01:17:19,060 --> 01:17:21,800
When they replaced earthquake with disaster,

1884
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:23,100
who hosts it now?

1885
01:17:23,100 --> 01:17:26,000
Christopher Walken hosts it as a Kooky director.

1886
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:29,560
There's a big, huge movie star cameo at the end

1887
01:17:29,560 --> 01:17:31,200
that you don't see coming.

1888
01:17:31,200 --> 01:17:33,560
Like get some celebrities in.

1889
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:35,560
How is Timberlake not in the ride?

1890
01:17:35,560 --> 01:17:36,400
It's amazing they didn't.

1891
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:38,700
How is Timberlake, yeah, that's crazy.

1892
01:17:38,700 --> 01:17:41,320
I mean, I'll say like, at least for Bourne,

1893
01:17:41,320 --> 01:17:43,080
it checks some boxes.

1894
01:17:43,080 --> 01:17:45,360
Like it's been around for a while.

1895
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:46,200
That first movie was like.

1896
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:48,240
All right, defending Bourne.

1897
01:17:48,240 --> 01:17:50,440
That's not what we're doing here.

1898
01:17:50,440 --> 01:17:51,280
No, no, no.

1899
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:53,040
But like compared to, like yeah,

1900
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:56,360
this came out so quickly after he started hosting the show.

1901
01:17:57,240 --> 01:17:59,560
Bourne has been around since 2003.

1902
01:17:59,560 --> 01:18:03,920
It's based on worldwide bestselling books.

1903
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:07,080
They play on cable every hour of the day.

1904
01:18:07,080 --> 01:18:08,120
What else do you like?

1905
01:18:08,120 --> 01:18:09,720
What else?

1906
01:18:09,720 --> 01:18:11,920
I like the close up action.

1907
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:14,760
Great early little role from Clive Owen.

1908
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:15,960
Excellent sound design.

1909
01:18:15,960 --> 01:18:17,560
Oscar nominated every time.

1910
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:18,680
Excellent sound design.

1911
01:18:18,680 --> 01:18:20,980
But there's stuff where it's like, okay,

1912
01:18:20,980 --> 01:18:22,800
I can kind of wrap my head around this.

1913
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:24,720
Do I think when the rumors were starting

1914
01:18:24,720 --> 01:18:26,560
that something would replace Transformers

1915
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:28,560
and one of the rumors was Star Trek,

1916
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:30,320
is that a more beloved brand?

1917
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:31,680
Yes, absolutely.

1918
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:36,880
But yeah, I can't.

1919
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:37,720
How there's just so much.

1920
01:18:37,720 --> 01:18:41,880
Okay, let's talk about why they did end up on this premise.

1921
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:45,680
Because the universal story is when they were viewing it,

1922
01:18:45,680 --> 01:18:46,600
when they were looking at the show

1923
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:48,080
and how do we turn this into a ride?

1924
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:50,680
What he does is he does all of these games.

1925
01:18:50,680 --> 01:18:52,260
Now the games are not races,

1926
01:18:52,260 --> 01:18:54,780
but I feel like the races are things that,

1927
01:18:54,780 --> 01:18:58,620
I think at some point he has had some kind of relay race

1928
01:18:58,620 --> 01:18:59,620
through the hallways.

1929
01:18:59,620 --> 01:19:02,220
And the executives must have seen that and gone,

1930
01:19:02,220 --> 01:19:04,420
okay, so Jimmy likes to play these games.

1931
01:19:04,420 --> 01:19:07,140
What is there a way that we could pit the audience

1932
01:19:07,140 --> 01:19:09,180
against him in a big game?

1933
01:19:09,180 --> 01:19:11,820
So there's at least, that's the logic.

1934
01:19:11,820 --> 01:19:12,940
It might be faulty logic,

1935
01:19:12,940 --> 01:19:14,980
but that is why we got to where we are.

1936
01:19:14,980 --> 01:19:17,560
But also, am I wrong in that almost every game

1937
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:19,620
I've ever seen Jimmy Fallon play,

1938
01:19:19,620 --> 01:19:21,940
it feels like he's throwing to make the celebrity

1939
01:19:21,940 --> 01:19:22,780
look good.

1940
01:19:22,780 --> 01:19:25,220
Like that is his brand of his show.

1941
01:19:25,220 --> 01:19:27,600
Like very often when they do these things,

1942
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:29,300
it is like he,

1943
01:19:30,580 --> 01:19:33,740
the main function of the Jimmy Fallon Tonight Show now

1944
01:19:33,740 --> 01:19:37,200
is to give celebrities an opportunity to showcase

1945
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:40,700
a slightly hidden talent and look really personable.

1946
01:19:40,700 --> 01:19:43,300
So are you saying that the impressions

1947
01:19:43,300 --> 01:19:46,020
on the wheel of impressions aren't random?

1948
01:19:46,020 --> 01:19:48,980
And that they're designed around singing voices

1949
01:19:48,980 --> 01:19:50,660
that the singers can already do?

1950
01:19:50,700 --> 01:19:52,180
Have pre-prepared and when they go,

1951
01:19:52,180 --> 01:19:55,820
oh God, I don't even know what this would sound like.

1952
01:19:55,820 --> 01:19:59,580
How do I do Mariah Carey singing Jingle Bells?

1953
01:19:59,580 --> 01:20:01,540
Well, I don't know, let me think.

1954
01:20:01,540 --> 01:20:05,100
I find that really interesting in juxtaposition

1955
01:20:05,100 --> 01:20:09,940
with how fucking competitive Jimmy Fallon is on this ride.

1956
01:20:09,940 --> 01:20:13,300
Like that is one of the things that blew my mind

1957
01:20:13,300 --> 01:20:14,760
going on it for the first time.

1958
01:20:14,760 --> 01:20:16,780
Considering how much of his reputation is,

1959
01:20:16,780 --> 01:20:19,140
I'm a nice guy, I support everybody.

1960
01:20:19,140 --> 01:20:20,740
Look at me, I'm just a fan of everything.

1961
01:20:20,740 --> 01:20:22,860
We're just having fun at games, it's light.

1962
01:20:22,860 --> 01:20:24,440
That his defense of the Trump thing was like,

1963
01:20:24,440 --> 01:20:25,920
look, I don't like to go hard.

1964
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:27,780
I don't go hard on anybody, right?

1965
01:20:27,780 --> 01:20:31,520
And then this ride is like, you fucking pathetic worms.

1966
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:34,860
I'm gonna cuck you so hard with my dust.

1967
01:20:34,860 --> 01:20:36,900
I'm gonna race you around New York.

1968
01:20:36,900 --> 01:20:40,200
He's got, not only is he equipped with a futuristic car,

1969
01:20:40,200 --> 01:20:41,700
what are we equipped with?

1970
01:20:41,700 --> 01:20:43,460
How are we doing the race?

1971
01:20:43,460 --> 01:20:45,540
We have nothing, we're in a box.

1972
01:20:45,540 --> 01:20:48,020
And he's got, he can spit tubes out.

1973
01:20:48,020 --> 01:20:49,860
He can activate hyper tube.

1974
01:20:49,860 --> 01:20:51,680
We have no resources at our disposal.

1975
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:53,380
We don't even know our way around the city.

1976
01:20:53,380 --> 01:20:55,540
We don't know our way, it's his hallways.

1977
01:20:55,540 --> 01:20:57,380
He has every advantage and it's a miracle

1978
01:20:57,380 --> 01:20:58,340
that we win quite frankly.

1979
01:20:58,340 --> 01:21:00,400
And he's apparently done this like every night

1980
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:03,100
before taping, which makes him look like a shitty,

1981
01:21:03,100 --> 01:21:06,820
like unprofessional host that they go like places, places.

1982
01:21:06,820 --> 01:21:09,300
And he's like, two minutes left time for a quick race.

1983
01:21:09,300 --> 01:21:13,140
And then just puts his entire audience's life at risk.

1984
01:21:13,140 --> 01:21:16,000
Maybe rehearse the bits, look at your notes.

1985
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,040
Read what a brilliant, like remember,

1986
01:21:18,040 --> 01:21:20,120
refresh your memory about the movies that you've watched

1987
01:21:20,120 --> 01:21:21,800
to talk to the guests about.

1988
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:25,600
But I feel like he's got such a weird Bugs Bunny persona

1989
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:28,440
in this ride, which is not who he is on the show

1990
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:31,560
where he keeps on like turning back over his shoulders

1991
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:34,440
and like making snide quips about how much he's beating us

1992
01:21:34,440 --> 01:21:37,800
and throwing like pizza at us and shit.

1993
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:40,120
Like it feels like he's got this real competitive

1994
01:21:40,120 --> 01:21:41,380
ain't I a stinker?

1995
01:21:41,380 --> 01:21:44,880
Like the audience is Elmer Fudd and he's having fun

1996
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:46,520
getting the better of us thing.

1997
01:21:46,520 --> 01:21:50,440
Dart's spreading the news, I'm winning the race.

1998
01:21:50,440 --> 01:21:51,680
It's a fundamental misunderstanding of the persona

1999
01:21:51,680 --> 01:21:55,560
that Jimmy Fallon has spent years trying to cultivate.

2000
01:21:55,560 --> 01:21:57,480
It is closer to Conan's.

2001
01:21:57,480 --> 01:21:58,320
Absolutely.

2002
01:21:58,320 --> 01:22:02,000
Another reason why this ride would work better with Conan.

2003
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,640
Like it feels like he's doing the exact ride

2004
01:22:04,640 --> 01:22:05,980
that Conan would do.

2005
01:22:05,980 --> 01:22:09,600
Like there were so many Conan bits of like Amy Poehler

2006
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:13,280
or Brian Stack or someone just playing a scumbag

2007
01:22:13,280 --> 01:22:14,440
in the audience.

2008
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:17,760
And Conan would just be disgusted at them

2009
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:20,080
and be disgusted by the people around you.

2010
01:22:20,080 --> 01:22:23,800
I'm really, I'm starting to think about now

2011
01:22:23,800 --> 01:22:27,360
like part of this might be that like talk shows

2012
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:31,240
are kind of like empty glasses.

2013
01:22:31,240 --> 01:22:33,880
Like you fill them with water, you fill them with liquid.

2014
01:22:33,880 --> 01:22:36,420
Whatever liquid you put in there fills it.

2015
01:22:36,420 --> 01:22:39,880
And a big part of that is musical guest, celebrity guests

2016
01:22:41,080 --> 01:22:43,500
of which there are none in this ride.

2017
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:46,620
But you know where there are a ton of characters

2018
01:22:46,620 --> 01:22:51,620
and celebrities, Universal Studios Florida.

2019
01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:55,740
And you could have done Jimmy Fallon race

2020
01:22:55,740 --> 01:22:57,580
through Universal Studios.

2021
01:22:57,580 --> 01:22:59,820
And he could have impersonated people

2022
01:22:59,820 --> 01:23:03,860
or actors from the other rides could have shown up.

2023
01:23:03,860 --> 01:23:08,780
Like you get the rock to do a little thing.

2024
01:23:09,100 --> 01:23:14,100
There are ways to translate the function of talk shows

2025
01:23:14,180 --> 01:23:15,940
into a ride.

2026
01:23:15,940 --> 01:23:19,300
There's way, yeah, to make it a little self aware.

2027
01:23:19,300 --> 01:23:21,060
There's all this talk about like the queue

2028
01:23:21,060 --> 01:23:22,980
at the Guardians of the Galaxy coaster in Epcot

2029
01:23:22,980 --> 01:23:25,660
is gonna have a lot of nods to the history of Epcot.

2030
01:23:25,660 --> 01:23:28,200
Like they could have like beaten them

2031
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:29,540
to the punch on that one.

2032
01:23:29,540 --> 01:23:32,480
And there are ways to make Jimmy Fallon

2033
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:35,340
the central character of a ride.

2034
01:23:35,340 --> 01:23:37,740
But it feels weird for them to like,

2035
01:23:37,780 --> 01:23:40,300
it's like they made every wrong decision.

2036
01:23:40,300 --> 01:23:43,460
Okay, people want an experiential interactive

2037
01:23:43,460 --> 01:23:46,100
tonight show based attraction.

2038
01:23:46,100 --> 01:23:48,340
Okay, so what are they gonna stand on a,

2039
01:23:48,340 --> 01:23:49,500
front of a green screen?

2040
01:23:49,500 --> 01:23:50,900
Are they gonna get to act like they're a guest?

2041
01:23:50,900 --> 01:23:52,240
No, it's a ride.

2042
01:23:52,240 --> 01:23:55,540
It's a ride, it's based exclusively off the show.

2043
01:23:55,540 --> 01:23:58,920
But the stuff that's proprietary material to the show

2044
01:23:58,920 --> 01:24:00,860
that doesn't involve the celebrity guests

2045
01:24:00,860 --> 01:24:02,540
and the musical acts that are the things

2046
01:24:02,540 --> 01:24:05,300
that actually go viral from the show.

2047
01:24:05,420 --> 01:24:07,740
And it's based around Jimmy Fallon's persona,

2048
01:24:07,740 --> 01:24:09,760
but not really the persona he does on the show

2049
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:11,980
because that wouldn't translate to a ride.

2050
01:24:11,980 --> 01:24:15,780
So it's him adapting like another kind of character

2051
01:24:15,780 --> 01:24:18,740
as himself, but also playing seven other characters.

2052
01:24:18,740 --> 01:24:20,340
That's Scott, as you said,

2053
01:24:20,340 --> 01:24:22,640
if this had been a 90s SNL ride

2054
01:24:22,640 --> 01:24:24,700
and you imagine like, oh, going on it now,

2055
01:24:24,700 --> 01:24:27,700
or even if it was an SNL ride from 10 years ago, right?

2056
01:24:27,700 --> 01:24:30,860
And the idea of like, oh, it's so topical,

2057
01:24:30,860 --> 01:24:32,660
how quickly would it get dated?

2058
01:24:33,460 --> 01:24:36,820
That would date less than hashtag the panda,

2059
01:24:36,820 --> 01:24:39,580
who for all I know has not made an appearance

2060
01:24:39,580 --> 01:24:41,380
on the show in the last three years.

2061
01:24:41,380 --> 01:24:43,940
I don't think so, and I missed it at the time.

2062
01:24:43,940 --> 01:24:47,220
I knew what tight pants was and I knew what you was.

2063
01:24:47,220 --> 01:24:48,180
Until this ride opened,

2064
01:24:48,180 --> 01:24:51,060
I had never seen hashtag the panda in my life.

2065
01:24:51,060 --> 01:24:51,900
Same here.

2066
01:24:51,900 --> 01:24:53,700
And when Chase was on your show,

2067
01:24:53,700 --> 01:24:57,060
he said like, that was a bit that was created

2068
01:24:57,060 --> 01:24:59,980
to fuck with one of the writers in the room.

2069
01:24:59,980 --> 01:25:02,140
The bit was the costume was hot

2070
01:25:02,260 --> 01:25:05,140
and we made him do shit while wearing the costume.

2071
01:25:05,140 --> 01:25:06,860
And he got really tired.

2072
01:25:06,860 --> 01:25:09,740
Like it's such an inside bit

2073
01:25:09,740 --> 01:25:14,060
that doesn't seem to have permeated culture at large

2074
01:25:14,060 --> 01:25:17,180
in a way that something like Triumph did,

2075
01:25:17,180 --> 01:25:20,220
but it just feels like Universal looking at and going like,

2076
01:25:20,220 --> 01:25:24,260
is there any character within the Fallon universe

2077
01:25:24,260 --> 01:25:26,700
who is like visually striking,

2078
01:25:26,700 --> 01:25:28,900
could make a walk around character

2079
01:25:28,900 --> 01:25:33,460
and is not a real comedy writer or performers face.

2080
01:25:33,460 --> 01:25:34,780
And he's the one.

2081
01:25:34,780 --> 01:25:37,980
And so they up him to being the walk around character,

2082
01:25:37,980 --> 01:25:40,020
the center of all the merchandise,

2083
01:25:40,020 --> 01:25:42,980
the antagonist of the ride kind of,

2084
01:25:42,980 --> 01:25:47,180
because they just need something that fills that visual role.

2085
01:25:47,180 --> 01:25:50,180
He's in the spot where Maggie is in the Simpsons ride,

2086
01:25:50,180 --> 01:25:52,460
the dinosaur in Back to the Future.

2087
01:25:52,460 --> 01:25:56,580
He's like, he plays as the main villain, but why?

2088
01:25:56,580 --> 01:25:57,500
Is he mad?

2089
01:25:57,500 --> 01:25:58,700
Why does he throw you?

2090
01:25:59,540 --> 01:26:01,140
I'm mad.

2091
01:26:01,140 --> 01:26:02,500
That is the moment where I'm like,

2092
01:26:02,500 --> 01:26:03,740
you have to be kidding me.

2093
01:26:03,740 --> 01:26:06,260
Like this is the exact motion.

2094
01:26:06,260 --> 01:26:08,940
It's not even like the dinosaur.

2095
01:26:08,940 --> 01:26:10,740
Yeah, I get it's kind of close to that,

2096
01:26:10,740 --> 01:26:12,900
but it is exactly Maggie in the Simpsons.

2097
01:26:12,900 --> 01:26:16,580
It's the same shot you get close to his mouth.

2098
01:26:16,580 --> 01:26:17,420
Yeah.

2099
01:26:17,420 --> 01:26:20,860
And it's, oh, I was just like, I can't believe that.

2100
01:26:20,860 --> 01:26:24,420
Like it's not like,

2101
01:26:24,460 --> 01:26:29,100
it's like if they had done a Conan ride and like Shooverine,

2102
01:26:29,100 --> 01:26:31,500
Wolverine character that was just a writer

2103
01:26:31,500 --> 01:26:33,500
who put shoes on his hands.

2104
01:26:33,500 --> 01:26:34,340
Andrew Weinberg.

2105
01:26:34,340 --> 01:26:35,180
And did their hair.

2106
01:26:35,180 --> 01:26:39,060
Yes, Andrew Weinberg did his hair like Wolverine.

2107
01:26:39,060 --> 01:26:42,500
Like that is like, if this was a Shooverine scene.

2108
01:26:42,500 --> 01:26:44,660
But then usually if you made a joke out of,

2109
01:26:44,660 --> 01:26:45,900
if you'd made it a little more clear

2110
01:26:45,900 --> 01:26:47,940
that hashtag the panda is nothing

2111
01:26:47,940 --> 01:26:49,500
in the way the Conan nothing characters

2112
01:26:49,500 --> 01:26:51,060
always knew they were nothing.

2113
01:26:51,060 --> 01:26:54,380
But I think it's hard to play irony in theme park world.

2114
01:26:55,380 --> 01:26:56,700
So we'd any sense of like,

2115
01:26:56,700 --> 01:26:59,140
hashtag the panda is lazily named dumb thing.

2116
01:26:59,140 --> 01:27:01,060
And it's just an excuse to make a guy dance.

2117
01:27:01,060 --> 01:27:01,900
That's all lost here.

2118
01:27:01,900 --> 01:27:04,540
Now it's just a kid is supposed to hug hashtag the panda.

2119
01:27:04,540 --> 01:27:06,900
And the only one who's ever done it is Jason Sheridan.

2120
01:27:06,900 --> 01:27:09,420
And part of the premise of hashtag the panda

2121
01:27:09,420 --> 01:27:11,220
is that the costume is shitty.

2122
01:27:11,220 --> 01:27:13,140
That it's like a shitty costume you would get

2123
01:27:13,140 --> 01:27:15,460
from a shitty costume rental place.

2124
01:27:15,460 --> 01:27:17,780
It is not an impressive walk around character.

2125
01:27:17,780 --> 01:27:20,500
Jason, I understand that he brought you more joy

2126
01:27:20,500 --> 01:27:22,700
than you've ever felt in your life.

2127
01:27:22,700 --> 01:27:24,260
I mean, I would have diminished that experience,

2128
01:27:24,260 --> 01:27:27,580
but it is insane how much they put on hashtag the panda

2129
01:27:27,580 --> 01:27:30,740
because it does feel like an alternate scenario

2130
01:27:30,740 --> 01:27:34,700
in which Shooverine was the most successful character

2131
01:27:34,700 --> 01:27:36,140
that Conan had ever done.

2132
01:27:36,140 --> 01:27:38,820
And I don't mean that Shooverine had broken out

2133
01:27:38,820 --> 01:27:40,220
in the way the triumph did.

2134
01:27:40,220 --> 01:27:43,660
I mean, that was the most any character

2135
01:27:43,660 --> 01:27:45,340
had ever broken out.

2136
01:27:45,340 --> 01:27:48,620
If only for justice for Shooverine,

2137
01:27:48,620 --> 01:27:49,460
he should have gotten it.

2138
01:27:49,460 --> 01:27:50,300
For justice for Shooverine.

2139
01:27:51,060 --> 01:27:53,420
He should come back at the Largo.

2140
01:27:53,420 --> 01:27:55,500
Oh yeah, yeah, very much.

2141
01:27:55,500 --> 01:27:57,700
This is why I don't wanna let everyone

2142
01:27:57,700 --> 01:27:58,900
who was involved in this off the hook,

2143
01:27:58,900 --> 01:28:02,100
but this is why it feels like everyone was under

2144
01:28:02,100 --> 01:28:04,420
such a strict rules.

2145
01:28:04,420 --> 01:28:05,740
Like, all right, it has to be a ride

2146
01:28:05,740 --> 01:28:07,660
that lasts for two, whatever.

2147
01:28:07,660 --> 01:28:08,500
How long is this?

2148
01:28:08,500 --> 01:28:09,660
Two and 15?

2149
01:28:09,660 --> 01:28:10,500
What is it?

2150
01:28:10,500 --> 01:28:11,340
Short, right?

2151
01:28:11,340 --> 01:28:14,180
It feels like four and a half hours, but yeah.

2152
01:28:14,180 --> 01:28:16,060
It might not be that short, but it feels short.

2153
01:28:16,060 --> 01:28:16,900
It has to be short.

2154
01:28:16,900 --> 01:28:17,780
It has to be a screen.

2155
01:28:17,780 --> 01:28:20,140
We can't have actors doing anything.

2156
01:28:20,140 --> 01:28:21,140
That's the cheapest way.

2157
01:28:21,140 --> 01:28:23,780
Put people in a theater, load them out.

2158
01:28:23,780 --> 01:28:26,740
It's gotta have, all right, it's gotta be exciting.

2159
01:28:26,740 --> 01:28:27,660
People like exciting.

2160
01:28:27,660 --> 01:28:28,500
Well, what can we do?

2161
01:28:28,500 --> 01:28:30,340
All right, all the same tricks in a 3D movie

2162
01:28:30,340 --> 01:28:32,260
that make things exciting.

2163
01:28:32,260 --> 01:28:34,660
Like, it feels like, and then they just cast

2164
01:28:34,660 --> 01:28:35,820
based on this.

2165
01:28:35,820 --> 01:28:37,140
They're like, all right, it's gotta be something

2166
01:28:37,140 --> 01:28:37,980
that moves people.

2167
01:28:37,980 --> 01:28:40,340
All right, we need a big thing at the end.

2168
01:28:40,340 --> 01:28:42,420
The Panda, I guess.

2169
01:28:42,420 --> 01:28:44,100
It feels like it was an afterthought.

2170
01:28:44,100 --> 01:28:46,500
It feels like the property was an afterthought.

2171
01:28:46,860 --> 01:28:50,260
And that the executives had watched the show that week

2172
01:28:50,260 --> 01:28:52,260
and they were like, I got this meeting at the end of the week.

2173
01:28:52,260 --> 01:28:53,540
What am I gonna put in here?

2174
01:28:53,540 --> 01:28:55,660
Oh, like they did, like I watched it on Wednesday

2175
01:28:55,660 --> 01:28:56,860
and there was this Panda.

2176
01:28:56,860 --> 01:28:58,700
That's a thing you do, right?

2177
01:28:58,700 --> 01:29:01,980
Let's do the intellectual exercise of putting Leno

2178
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:03,700
on this exact ride.

2179
01:29:03,700 --> 01:29:04,540
Yes.

2180
01:29:04,540 --> 01:29:08,260
And like, you're gonna have to cast who's at the top

2181
01:29:08,260 --> 01:29:10,940
of the, one of Judge Edo is at the top of the building.

2182
01:29:10,940 --> 01:29:13,380
Well, maybe that can be the- The Dancing Edo's.

2183
01:29:13,380 --> 01:29:16,060
Or that's the, the Dancing Edo's maybe are in the subway.

2184
01:29:16,060 --> 01:29:19,060
They're performing, you throw money into the, yeah,

2185
01:29:19,060 --> 01:29:19,900
I think so.

2186
01:29:19,900 --> 01:29:23,260
I think it's the, the aforementioned bodybuilder character.

2187
01:29:23,260 --> 01:29:24,860
We all remember maybe he's up,

2188
01:29:24,860 --> 01:29:28,220
because he's strong, climbed up to the top of the building.

2189
01:29:28,220 --> 01:29:29,740
This is by the way, the ride you're describing

2190
01:29:29,740 --> 01:29:32,060
is race through Burbank with Jay Leno.

2191
01:29:32,060 --> 01:29:33,060
Right. Oh, wow.

2192
01:29:33,060 --> 01:29:33,900
Yeah, you're right.

2193
01:29:33,900 --> 01:29:36,180
Which would make a lot of sense because he loves his cars.

2194
01:29:36,180 --> 01:29:38,060
It actually- I was gonna say,

2195
01:29:38,060 --> 01:29:41,180
that problem is it's a cleaner walk with Jay

2196
01:29:41,180 --> 01:29:44,260
because at least he's a vehicle aficionado.

2197
01:29:44,260 --> 01:29:45,660
Yes, that's true. You're right.

2198
01:29:46,300 --> 01:29:49,980
Then you follow him, you whiz into the Bob's big boy,

2199
01:29:49,980 --> 01:29:51,820
and then that gets right in your face and you almost,

2200
01:29:51,820 --> 01:29:53,580
and you bump into the statue.

2201
01:29:53,580 --> 01:29:54,420
Oh, it's better than-

2202
01:29:54,420 --> 01:29:55,780
And it causes some chain reaction.

2203
01:29:55,780 --> 01:29:57,860
It's even better than Conan's, honestly.

2204
01:29:57,860 --> 01:29:58,700
Yeah, this is the one.

2205
01:29:58,700 --> 01:30:01,500
You have places with a Jay's garage ride tomorrow

2206
01:30:01,500 --> 01:30:03,220
and it would work.

2207
01:30:03,220 --> 01:30:05,980
It would work better than race through New York.

2208
01:30:05,980 --> 01:30:08,900
I mean, it just feels like every time there's a new character

2209
01:30:08,900 --> 01:30:11,460
or a new reference or a new visual,

2210
01:30:11,500 --> 01:30:15,860
that I guess is something from the Tonight Show circa

2211
01:30:15,860 --> 01:30:20,700
fall 2006, it feels like the ride is trying to gabbo me.

2212
01:30:20,700 --> 01:30:24,060
It feels like every 15 seconds, there's a new gabbo

2213
01:30:24,060 --> 01:30:26,340
where it's like, you know this, you love this.

2214
01:30:26,340 --> 01:30:28,460
This is what you like about this show.

2215
01:30:28,460 --> 01:30:30,700
This is important and it's iconic

2216
01:30:30,700 --> 01:30:32,900
and it deserves to belong in a theme park

2217
01:30:32,900 --> 01:30:35,660
for an infinite amount of years.

2218
01:30:35,660 --> 01:30:40,300
In terms of Tonight Show characters being iconic,

2219
01:30:40,300 --> 01:30:43,140
I might argue that the closest that they get it

2220
01:30:43,140 --> 01:30:45,340
is the Ragtime Gals.

2221
01:30:45,340 --> 01:30:46,900
The Ragtime Gals were on the show a bunch

2222
01:30:46,900 --> 01:30:49,820
and it is a celebrity vehicle, but it's still like,

2223
01:30:49,820 --> 01:30:53,380
you know, there's costumes there that are reproducible.

2224
01:30:53,380 --> 01:30:55,740
It is a way to get a bunch of theme park performers in.

2225
01:30:55,740 --> 01:30:57,260
It was not my favorite thing to watch,

2226
01:30:57,260 --> 01:30:58,860
but I wish these people well.

2227
01:30:58,860 --> 01:31:01,580
I hope you have fun harmonizing and everything.

2228
01:31:01,580 --> 01:31:04,980
Again, you sort of lose the irony in their performance

2229
01:31:04,980 --> 01:31:08,300
because the joke is we're doing in some cases

2230
01:31:08,300 --> 01:31:13,300
sort of profane hip hop songs, but in this cheesy manner.

2231
01:31:13,540 --> 01:31:16,220
But with the theme park filter, it just is cheesy.

2232
01:31:16,220 --> 01:31:19,500
And like a theme park would just do

2233
01:31:19,500 --> 01:31:21,460
a barbershop ice ice baby.

2234
01:31:21,460 --> 01:31:25,060
That's not, there's nothing weird going on there

2235
01:31:25,060 --> 01:31:28,620
and it's being executed in a not weird way.

2236
01:31:29,540 --> 01:31:30,740
So the Ragtime Gals are weird,

2237
01:31:30,740 --> 01:31:35,140
but it is a little bit of an iconic thing from the show.

2238
01:31:35,380 --> 01:31:37,100
Absolutely, but let's say two things.

2239
01:31:37,100 --> 01:31:41,500
One, it is iconic, but only because they're co-opting

2240
01:31:41,500 --> 01:31:43,580
barbershop quartet iconography.

2241
01:31:43,580 --> 01:31:46,220
Like that works for you just as well if you,

2242
01:31:46,220 --> 01:31:49,020
as if you had never seen an episode of The Tonight Show

2243
01:31:49,020 --> 01:31:50,820
in your entire life and you just go,

2244
01:31:50,820 --> 01:31:53,820
oh, I know what a barbershop quartet looks and sounds like.

2245
01:31:53,820 --> 01:31:55,860
Sure, sure. And as you said,

2246
01:31:55,860 --> 01:31:57,380
you're using the surface elements.

2247
01:31:57,380 --> 01:32:00,020
Obviously in the video elements of the ride itself,

2248
01:32:00,020 --> 01:32:02,220
you have the real four or five writers

2249
01:32:02,220 --> 01:32:04,660
who were part of the Ragtime Gals at the time,

2250
01:32:04,660 --> 01:32:06,340
like Tom Shalhou and whoever,

2251
01:32:07,580 --> 01:32:11,100
but removed from the ironic context

2252
01:32:11,100 --> 01:32:13,420
that made them a comedy bit to begin with.

2253
01:32:13,420 --> 01:32:15,780
Hashtag the panda is the same thing.

2254
01:32:15,780 --> 01:32:18,620
Like the only reason hashtag is funny is the bit of,

2255
01:32:18,620 --> 01:32:21,180
you know there's a real performer in that suit

2256
01:32:21,180 --> 01:32:23,340
and he's getting sweaty and tired.

2257
01:32:23,340 --> 01:32:26,140
And then in this ride, it turns it into,

2258
01:32:26,140 --> 01:32:28,380
oh my God, look, and he's 600 feet tall.

2259
01:32:28,380 --> 01:32:30,140
How did that happen?

2260
01:32:30,140 --> 01:32:32,020
Yeah, the context is lost.

2261
01:32:32,020 --> 01:32:32,860
It's all gone.

2262
01:32:33,140 --> 01:32:35,380
I just wanted to say about the Ragtime Gals

2263
01:32:35,380 --> 01:32:36,780
and I actually wanted to play a clip here

2264
01:32:36,780 --> 01:32:41,780
just to give them some credit and a bit from the show.

2265
01:32:42,220 --> 01:32:44,620
I just, and they are such an important part of this.

2266
01:32:44,620 --> 01:32:45,460
They're in the ride.

2267
01:32:45,460 --> 01:32:47,340
They are the pre-show.

2268
01:32:47,340 --> 01:32:51,700
So I just pulled a random Ragtime Gals performance

2269
01:32:51,700 --> 01:32:55,060
just to help the audience acquaint with them a little bit.

2270
01:32:55,060 --> 01:32:56,820
So as I said, this was a good sketch

2271
01:32:56,820 --> 01:32:59,820
to plug celebrities into.

2272
01:32:59,820 --> 01:33:00,740
So what you're gonna see,

2273
01:33:00,780 --> 01:33:03,220
they always reveal the celebrity in the back of the line.

2274
01:33:03,220 --> 01:33:08,140
They all line up and then like, oh, that's who it is.

2275
01:33:08,140 --> 01:33:09,020
It's a guest on the show.

2276
01:33:09,020 --> 01:33:11,820
I didn't think he'd be doing a bit.

2277
01:33:11,820 --> 01:33:14,260
Do you guys see the Ragtime Gals here?

2278
01:33:14,260 --> 01:33:15,220
Yes, I do.

2279
01:33:15,220 --> 01:33:17,660
Okay, so here's just a random one

2280
01:33:17,660 --> 01:33:19,500
just to show kind of how they weave

2281
01:33:19,500 --> 01:33:21,420
different celebrities into the bit.

2282
01:33:21,420 --> 01:33:25,780
Ta-da-la-la-la, ta-da-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la.

2283
01:33:25,780 --> 01:33:29,260
Ta-da-la-la-la, ta-da-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la.

2284
01:33:30,260 --> 01:33:33,060
I'm not the guy that you get off.

2285
01:33:33,060 --> 01:33:38,060
My look, guys, it's that guy from House of Cards.

2286
01:33:39,420 --> 01:33:43,140
I know what the girl that need, New York to Haiti.

2287
01:33:43,140 --> 01:33:43,980
I'll let it run a little.

2288
01:33:43,980 --> 01:33:45,620
This is a Jason Derulo song.

2289
01:33:45,620 --> 01:33:47,820
I think it's gonna be hard to leave.

2290
01:33:47,820 --> 01:33:50,660
I've been around the world, don't speak the language,

2291
01:33:50,660 --> 01:33:52,860
but your body don't need explaining.

2292
01:33:52,860 --> 01:33:57,220
All you need to understand is when you talk dirty to me.

2293
01:33:57,220 --> 01:33:58,460
Ta-da-la-la, ta-da-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la.

2294
01:33:58,460 --> 01:34:02,740
So just to clarify, they're doing a Jason Derulo song,

2295
01:34:02,740 --> 01:34:04,540
and there's a line about,

2296
01:34:05,740 --> 01:34:09,260
basically, just to clarify, it is a song about,

2297
01:34:09,260 --> 01:34:11,620
in this case, Kevin Spacey having sex

2298
01:34:11,620 --> 01:34:13,660
on international airplanes.

2299
01:34:13,660 --> 01:34:15,100
Just wanted to lay that out there.

2300
01:34:15,100 --> 01:34:17,540
Yes, I didn't even think about that.

2301
01:34:17,540 --> 01:34:18,940
International.

2302
01:34:18,940 --> 01:34:19,780
Oh, Jesus Christ.

2303
01:34:19,780 --> 01:34:21,860
But your booty don't need explaining.

2304
01:34:21,860 --> 01:34:22,940
Oh my God.

2305
01:34:22,940 --> 01:34:24,220
That's a fun bit.

2306
01:34:24,220 --> 01:34:25,820
Just wanted to share that with you guys.

2307
01:34:25,820 --> 01:34:26,660
But even at other times.

2308
01:34:26,660 --> 01:34:27,700
Now it's Spacey Oddities 2.

2309
01:34:27,740 --> 01:34:29,740
You're like, right, okay, first of all,

2310
01:34:31,340 --> 01:34:33,340
every element of the Fallon attraction,

2311
01:34:33,340 --> 01:34:35,140
both pre-show and ride itself,

2312
01:34:35,140 --> 01:34:38,260
is stripping the ragtime gals of their bit,

2313
01:34:38,260 --> 01:34:40,420
of their irony, right?

2314
01:34:40,420 --> 01:34:45,060
But also, that the bit is also dependent

2315
01:34:45,060 --> 01:34:48,940
on having a surprise celebrity fifth person.

2316
01:34:48,940 --> 01:34:51,260
Like, you're removing that from the equation as well.

2317
01:34:51,260 --> 01:34:52,780
And I feel like that's such a huge,

2318
01:34:52,780 --> 01:34:55,340
not to keep on circling back to this point,

2319
01:34:55,340 --> 01:34:59,180
but it's such a huge difference between Conan and Fallon,

2320
01:34:59,180 --> 01:35:02,100
where it's like, for Conan, the characters and the bits

2321
01:35:02,100 --> 01:35:04,860
and the sense of world building that show had

2322
01:35:04,860 --> 01:35:08,740
was what happened in between celebrity appearances.

2323
01:35:08,740 --> 01:35:11,340
Like, there were things that were entirely owned

2324
01:35:11,340 --> 01:35:14,140
by the show, because by and large,

2325
01:35:14,140 --> 01:35:16,340
you wouldn't see Harrison Ford

2326
01:35:16,340 --> 01:35:18,780
interacting with Preparation H. Raymond.

2327
01:35:18,780 --> 01:35:23,300
Whereas every bit Fallon has is pretty much predicated on,

2328
01:35:23,420 --> 01:35:26,460
and you won't believe who's participating this time.

2329
01:35:26,460 --> 01:35:27,300
Whether it's a pain-

2330
01:35:27,300 --> 01:35:29,420
Well, you're maybe describing a bigger problem

2331
01:35:29,420 --> 01:35:32,580
with pop culture and culture in general.

2332
01:35:32,580 --> 01:35:33,860
This is why it's a three hour episode.

2333
01:35:33,860 --> 01:35:38,860
This is why the Fallon ride is so monumental in my eyes,

2334
01:35:39,980 --> 01:35:43,860
in terms of like, this is just such a culmination moment

2335
01:35:43,860 --> 01:35:47,860
of so many different things gone wrong in culture,

2336
01:35:47,860 --> 01:35:49,260
all coming to a head.

2337
01:35:49,260 --> 01:35:51,020
This is the death of American culture.

2338
01:35:51,020 --> 01:35:51,860
Kind of.

2339
01:35:53,500 --> 01:35:55,140
You made a good point a couple times

2340
01:35:55,140 --> 01:35:59,660
that it's difficult to do irony in theme parks,

2341
01:35:59,660 --> 01:36:02,260
in a way, like you can do it in comedy on television,

2342
01:36:02,260 --> 01:36:03,220
certainly in film.

2343
01:36:04,420 --> 01:36:07,140
But if you work with the context

2344
01:36:07,140 --> 01:36:09,100
that theme parks have available,

2345
01:36:09,100 --> 01:36:11,500
there are ways to make stuff work.

2346
01:36:11,500 --> 01:36:13,940
Like, oh, what are the ragtime girls like?

2347
01:36:13,940 --> 01:36:15,700
Oh, they're like barbershop quartets?

2348
01:36:15,700 --> 01:36:17,500
Oh, you mean like the dapper dance

2349
01:36:17,500 --> 01:36:20,100
who just wander Main Street singing?

2350
01:36:20,100 --> 01:36:23,620
Couldn't you just put these guys outside of the building

2351
01:36:24,700 --> 01:36:29,340
as if it was kind of poking fun at the dapper dance?

2352
01:36:29,340 --> 01:36:31,940
Cause they're singing like Jason Derulo

2353
01:36:31,940 --> 01:36:34,580
and they're singing like Lizzo songs.

2354
01:36:34,580 --> 01:36:37,020
You could do that easily

2355
01:36:37,020 --> 01:36:39,820
because that is what Universal figured out early on.

2356
01:36:39,820 --> 01:36:43,820
Yeah, irony is difficult, but you can be a little cutting.

2357
01:36:43,820 --> 01:36:45,900
They could do the hashtag, the panda bit,

2358
01:36:45,900 --> 01:36:48,060
where he's giant and he's on the Empire State Building

2359
01:36:48,060 --> 01:36:51,420
and it's like Maggie, maybe tossing a line,

2360
01:36:51,420 --> 01:36:53,460
go like, wait, isn't this just the same thing

2361
01:36:53,460 --> 01:36:55,020
for the Simpsons ride?

2362
01:36:55,020 --> 01:36:57,620
I think the audience would eat that up.

2363
01:36:57,620 --> 01:37:00,540
But that's what makes this even more inexplicable

2364
01:37:00,540 --> 01:37:02,060
is everything you're saying,

2365
01:37:02,060 --> 01:37:04,420
they kind of did right with the Simpsons ride.

2366
01:37:04,420 --> 01:37:06,580
I'm a Simpsons ride defender.

2367
01:37:06,580 --> 01:37:08,540
I still wish it was back to the future.

2368
01:37:08,540 --> 01:37:11,060
That's a top five of all time ride for me.

2369
01:37:11,060 --> 01:37:13,260
But I think the Simpsons ride works

2370
01:37:13,260 --> 01:37:15,380
and I think the main reason it works is,

2371
01:37:15,420 --> 01:37:19,340
A, you have a TV show that's been on for over 30 years

2372
01:37:19,340 --> 01:37:24,340
is has by just sort of a bullheaded refusal to end,

2373
01:37:25,380 --> 01:37:26,900
become timeless.

2374
01:37:26,900 --> 01:37:29,900
And so the characters have like transcended

2375
01:37:29,900 --> 01:37:33,940
to this sort of level of they can represent everything

2376
01:37:33,940 --> 01:37:35,420
or they can represent nothing.

2377
01:37:35,420 --> 01:37:37,420
Like they're malleable enough

2378
01:37:37,420 --> 01:37:42,420
that the show isn't too au courant to base a ride around.

2379
01:37:43,420 --> 01:37:46,540
It can be whatever the fuck it wants to be,

2380
01:37:46,540 --> 01:37:49,580
but there's a sensibility comedically that you can use

2381
01:37:49,580 --> 01:37:53,540
as a prism through which to parody rides and theme parks,

2382
01:37:53,540 --> 01:37:55,740
which I think it does well.

2383
01:37:55,740 --> 01:37:58,060
Like that's the success of that ride

2384
01:37:58,060 --> 01:38:00,100
is less about the specific characters

2385
01:38:00,100 --> 01:38:02,060
and more about the iconography

2386
01:38:02,060 --> 01:38:07,060
and the sense of humor applied to a ride in the abstract.

2387
01:38:07,660 --> 01:38:10,300
Maybe nothing else can really do a parody

2388
01:38:10,300 --> 01:38:12,740
of a theme park ride in the way the Simpsons ride

2389
01:38:12,740 --> 01:38:14,860
I think successfully is.

2390
01:38:14,860 --> 01:38:17,740
I think it'd be overkill to do too many more.

2391
01:38:17,740 --> 01:38:19,820
This is an anti ride.

2392
01:38:19,820 --> 01:38:22,620
But it also helps that in the universe of the Simpsons,

2393
01:38:22,620 --> 01:38:25,180
they have gone to theme parks before.

2394
01:38:25,180 --> 01:38:27,580
And the ride is pretending that you are going

2395
01:38:27,580 --> 01:38:32,540
to another theme park within the Simpsons universe.

2396
01:38:32,540 --> 01:38:34,620
Whereas this ride is just saying like,

2397
01:38:34,620 --> 01:38:37,020
step into New York, you are on the corner

2398
01:38:37,060 --> 01:38:40,860
of 52nd and fifth, please enter 30 rock.

2399
01:38:40,860 --> 01:38:42,260
This is normal New York.

2400
01:38:42,260 --> 01:38:44,700
And then once the curtains pull open,

2401
01:38:44,700 --> 01:38:48,580
Jimmy Fallon reveals that he has the world's most advanced

2402
01:38:48,580 --> 01:38:53,260
race car slash aeroplane slash spaceship.

2403
01:38:53,260 --> 01:38:56,540
And also the entire audience seating section

2404
01:38:56,540 --> 01:38:58,060
is its own vehicle.

2405
01:38:58,060 --> 01:38:59,780
Let's go to the moon.

2406
01:39:00,700 --> 01:39:01,540
Yeah.

2407
01:39:01,540 --> 01:39:02,380
It's a lot.

2408
01:39:02,380 --> 01:39:04,500
And you get none of this in the pre-show.

2409
01:39:04,500 --> 01:39:05,940
It's just thrown at you,

2410
01:39:05,940 --> 01:39:07,940
which I guess I wouldn't necessarily like an over

2411
01:39:07,940 --> 01:39:11,220
explaining pre-show, but truly you watch the ride.

2412
01:39:11,220 --> 01:39:12,060
Like, wait a minute.

2413
01:39:12,060 --> 01:39:14,460
So how are we moving and why space and why we can go

2414
01:39:14,460 --> 01:39:17,220
under water and it is a little too much to stay.

2415
01:39:17,220 --> 01:39:18,060
If you.

2416
01:39:18,060 --> 01:39:19,540
Fantastico happens until the ride happens,

2417
01:39:19,540 --> 01:39:22,380
all the pre-show stuff, all the warnings, everything is,

2418
01:39:22,380 --> 01:39:25,140
this is going to be a very normal taping

2419
01:39:25,140 --> 01:39:27,060
of the Jimmy Fallon show.

2420
01:39:27,060 --> 01:39:28,500
If it's a Joe roadie ride,

2421
01:39:28,500 --> 01:39:32,060
there's like two pre-shows that explain how the tonight

2422
01:39:32,060 --> 01:39:33,700
rider works.

2423
01:39:33,700 --> 01:39:34,540
Yes.

2424
01:39:34,540 --> 01:39:37,380
Exactly what the jet propulsion is like and exactly how

2425
01:39:37,380 --> 01:39:39,620
fast it can go and what it's raced before.

2426
01:39:39,620 --> 01:39:43,180
Why it exists, why it even exists in this universe.

2427
01:39:43,180 --> 01:39:45,860
There is no place setting it.

2428
01:39:45,860 --> 01:39:47,660
All the place setting is just, you know,

2429
01:39:47,660 --> 01:39:49,420
how a TV show taping works.

2430
01:39:49,420 --> 01:39:51,020
Please turn off your cell phones.

2431
01:39:51,020 --> 01:39:52,980
Here's the roots curtains up.

2432
01:39:52,980 --> 01:39:57,060
Jimmy's already in the tonight rider and he is like,

2433
01:39:57,060 --> 01:39:58,420
Oh, I guess we have four minutes.

2434
01:39:58,420 --> 01:40:00,540
Let's go on a race to the stars.

2435
01:40:00,540 --> 01:40:04,100
I think the first reference to the tonight rider,

2436
01:40:04,100 --> 01:40:07,500
when he says I'm going to go get the tonight rider and you've

2437
01:40:07,500 --> 01:40:11,780
had no previous acclamation to the Jimmy Fallon as a space

2438
01:40:11,780 --> 01:40:12,620
car.

2439
01:40:12,620 --> 01:40:15,420
We oftentimes, I think, talk about stuff where we go,

2440
01:40:15,420 --> 01:40:18,100
it's too much explanation, too much explanation on newer

2441
01:40:18,100 --> 01:40:19,340
rides. There's no reason.

2442
01:40:19,340 --> 01:40:22,380
And I think guardians, which I love and avatar flight of

2443
01:40:22,380 --> 01:40:26,020
passage, which I also love, have a little too much like

2444
01:40:26,020 --> 01:40:26,860
explanation.

2445
01:40:26,860 --> 01:40:30,300
Rocket raccoon could really tell you a lot less about what's

2446
01:40:30,300 --> 01:40:33,020
going on in your hands, scanning and all of that.

2447
01:40:33,020 --> 01:40:36,500
But this one, this needs a couple sentences.

2448
01:40:36,980 --> 01:40:38,660
It needs a little bit.

2449
01:40:38,660 --> 01:40:42,500
I mean, it's got great lines like a space train.

2450
01:40:43,220 --> 01:40:45,660
I've heard about this ride.

2451
01:40:45,660 --> 01:40:47,820
Jesus Christ.

2452
01:40:47,820 --> 01:40:50,340
Like gracefully does take the space train.

2453
01:40:50,340 --> 01:40:51,500
It goes space train.

2454
01:40:51,500 --> 01:40:52,980
I've heard about this ride.

2455
01:40:52,980 --> 01:40:57,300
Yeah. When the announcer in space, who is also his announcer,

2456
01:40:57,300 --> 01:41:00,260
announces about that, there is a space train.

2457
01:41:01,060 --> 01:41:06,340
But I feel like most rides, as you talk about extensively on

2458
01:41:06,340 --> 01:41:09,540
this show, especially most modern rides tend to base

2459
01:41:09,540 --> 01:41:12,660
around this is what we're telling you, the audience,

2460
01:41:12,660 --> 01:41:14,060
you're about to witness.

2461
01:41:14,060 --> 01:41:16,700
But the entire premise of the ride is that something's going

2462
01:41:16,700 --> 01:41:20,140
to go wrong and you're going to end up on a very unique

2463
01:41:20,140 --> 01:41:22,300
journey that was not planned at all.

2464
01:41:22,300 --> 01:41:24,100
You know?

2465
01:41:24,100 --> 01:41:29,700
And this is not that it is like we're preparing you to watch

2466
01:41:29,700 --> 01:41:33,820
a regular taping of The Tonight Show and then the curtains open.

2467
01:41:34,020 --> 01:41:36,740
Jimmy Fallon rides out in a vehicle and goes, fuck you.

2468
01:41:36,740 --> 01:41:42,100
Let's race like as if this is just his pre show ritual.

2469
01:41:42,900 --> 01:41:44,620
Yeah, every that he does every day.

2470
01:41:44,620 --> 01:41:46,940
What if there was what if the pre show involved

2471
01:41:47,780 --> 01:41:49,900
that you do a little backstage tour?

2472
01:41:49,900 --> 01:41:51,820
I'm going to show you how a TV show works.

2473
01:41:51,820 --> 01:41:54,420
Here's the costumes first and all kind of crazy stuff in here and makeup.

2474
01:41:54,420 --> 01:41:55,700
They make me look handsome.

2475
01:41:55,700 --> 01:41:59,660
And then over here is the laboratory where we and then like

2476
01:42:00,100 --> 01:42:02,980
there's a, you know, instead of just some friendly costume person,

2477
01:42:03,100 --> 01:42:06,780
now he has like a mad scientist or a tech guy working for him.

2478
01:42:06,940 --> 01:42:09,700
Like it's the first it's a Muppet showy sort of like,

2479
01:42:09,780 --> 01:42:12,100
wait, why is that at a TV show?

2480
01:42:12,100 --> 01:42:17,380
And like some allusion to I have told the audience that I'm going to do a race.

2481
01:42:17,380 --> 01:42:20,020
But what they don't know is that I'm going to cheat because I have the high

2482
01:42:20,020 --> 01:42:21,820
tech tonight writer with me.

2483
01:42:21,820 --> 01:42:25,340
You just you don't get the no tracks are laid for any of this.

2484
01:42:25,620 --> 01:42:28,500
Yeah. I took call back to your first appearance, Griffin.

2485
01:42:28,740 --> 01:42:31,260
It should be more like Muppet Vision 3D.

2486
01:42:31,940 --> 01:42:34,380
It should be walking. Yeah, that's a great idea.

2487
01:42:34,380 --> 01:42:37,540
Scott is like, yeah, you're walking around backstage at the night show.

2488
01:42:37,540 --> 01:42:39,340
And there's all these crazy like Dr.

2489
01:42:39,340 --> 01:42:42,900
Bunsen, honey do kind of like nonsense.

2490
01:42:43,220 --> 01:42:45,620
Yeah, it's crazy to work here.

2491
01:42:45,620 --> 01:42:49,780
It's so thoroughly not in the DNA of Fallon's show.

2492
01:42:50,020 --> 01:42:53,900
Like Conan could do that and you would go, of course, this makes perfect sense.

2493
01:42:54,140 --> 01:42:58,260
The way like Conan always talks about how whenever they would do

2494
01:42:58,260 --> 01:43:01,820
the sort of backstage bits in the hallways of 30 Rock, he always wanted

2495
01:43:01,820 --> 01:43:05,900
to feel like old timey Hollywood, where there's like a guy in a Roman centurion

2496
01:43:05,900 --> 01:43:08,340
outfit and there's a camel or horse, right?

2497
01:43:08,340 --> 01:43:10,820
A camel. Right. Like any of that shit.

2498
01:43:10,820 --> 01:43:15,780
He cultivated that atmosphere of like this show is crazy.

2499
01:43:15,780 --> 01:43:18,700
Everything's going on behind the scenes. These characters are real.

2500
01:43:18,900 --> 01:43:21,380
They invade my studio. I interact with them.

2501
01:43:21,580 --> 01:43:25,100
They stress me out, which Fallon does not really do.

2502
01:43:25,140 --> 01:43:27,020
And I think part of that is

2503
01:43:27,020 --> 01:43:32,180
Fallon wants to play the characters like if anyone's doing a character bit

2504
01:43:32,180 --> 01:43:35,380
on a Fallon show, it's almost always Fallon.

2505
01:43:35,460 --> 01:43:38,500
And if it's not Fallon, it's because it's a sketch that requires

2506
01:43:38,500 --> 01:43:39,980
more than one character.

2507
01:43:39,980 --> 01:43:42,220
And Fallon is still playing the primary one.

2508
01:43:42,340 --> 01:43:44,500
Fallon has to be one of the ragtime gals.

2509
01:43:44,620 --> 01:43:49,340
Fallon has to be the girl, which also makes building a ride around it difficult

2510
01:43:49,660 --> 01:43:52,860
because there isn't a universe for him to interact with.

2511
01:43:52,980 --> 01:43:56,340
Jimmy Fallon has no relationship with these characters

2512
01:43:56,500 --> 01:43:59,500
because he is them or he is one of them.

2513
01:44:00,060 --> 01:44:02,620
Hashtag the Panda is the only one he has a dynamic with.

2514
01:44:02,620 --> 01:44:05,340
And the dynamic is torturing him.

2515
01:44:06,420 --> 01:44:08,900
Which this speaks to my again over and over.

2516
01:44:08,900 --> 01:44:11,020
I keep saying this. Why?

2517
01:44:11,020 --> 01:44:14,420
It feels like if there's not enough time, like it feels like they maybe had Jimmy

2518
01:44:14,420 --> 01:44:16,980
for 30 minutes to shoot this. Yes.

2519
01:44:16,980 --> 01:44:20,940
Like if he loves playing characters, why isn't Neil Young in this?

2520
01:44:20,940 --> 01:44:25,340
Why isn't why aren't the big hits from his characters in this

2521
01:44:25,340 --> 01:44:28,540
as opposed to a blurry out of focus?

2522
01:44:28,900 --> 01:44:32,940
Him shooting like saying lines from nowhere.

2523
01:44:33,340 --> 01:44:37,100
But he does take time to play his famous character, Travis Bickle.

2524
01:44:37,540 --> 01:44:40,540
Right. Because there's a part if the audience doesn't know this,

2525
01:44:40,540 --> 01:44:45,580
there's a part where he pulls up to a taxi cab and then it is the ultimate taxi driver.

2526
01:44:46,340 --> 01:44:48,580
And they have a little exchange, which is just a weird

2527
01:44:48,900 --> 01:44:52,500
of all the movies to tribute in a theme park like the darkest.

2528
01:44:53,180 --> 01:44:56,340
It's like all Cartoon New York and then the darkest New York film.

2529
01:44:56,380 --> 01:45:00,820
It feels like Jimmy is playing Martin Scorsese in the back seat.

2530
01:45:00,820 --> 01:45:02,660
Like you see up that window

2531
01:45:04,500 --> 01:45:06,220
coked out of his mind.

2532
01:45:06,220 --> 01:45:11,780
Yeah. But you ask why he isn't doing these things instead.

2533
01:45:11,780 --> 01:45:17,140
And it's like, I think there is such an extreme state of denial

2534
01:45:17,300 --> 01:45:21,140
where he and everyone involved in this ride don't want to put it all on his shoulders.

2535
01:45:21,260 --> 01:45:24,300
But it feels like everyone involved in the making of this ride

2536
01:45:24,540 --> 01:45:28,740
wants to convince themselves that this show does function this way,

2537
01:45:29,060 --> 01:45:32,340
that it has enough popular characters that you can fill a ride with.

2538
01:45:32,580 --> 01:45:37,500
So the idea of having to establish a new tonight show labs down the hall.

2539
01:45:38,020 --> 01:45:40,900
I'm sure they would say, well, but that's not part of the show.

2540
01:45:40,900 --> 01:45:43,100
Why would we use that? We don't want to add new things.

2541
01:45:43,420 --> 01:45:46,820
And it's like, but motherfucker, the shit you have doesn't fit on a ride.

2542
01:45:46,980 --> 01:45:49,620
And also you're having to invent the Knight Rider

2543
01:45:49,820 --> 01:45:52,380
because there's no reason for this to be happening.

2544
01:45:52,580 --> 01:45:57,420
And it's all the more bizarre when he already hosts the backlot tour,

2545
01:45:57,540 --> 01:46:02,780
when there already like is a ride in which Jimmy Fallon interacts ostensibly,

2546
01:46:02,780 --> 01:46:07,540
you know, not in a very high tech way, but speaks to the people, the ride goers

2547
01:46:08,180 --> 01:46:11,580
in California and comments on all the different places

2548
01:46:11,580 --> 01:46:13,860
they're going to in history and whatever.

2549
01:46:13,860 --> 01:46:16,660
And this just invents this whole new mythology.

2550
01:46:17,060 --> 01:46:22,300
To then create a ride that acts like all of these other elements fit into a ride.

2551
01:46:22,980 --> 01:46:28,100
I don't want to just dictate the conversation, but I do think I wouldn't mind

2552
01:46:28,100 --> 01:46:32,580
just focusing on the tonight writer for a period of time.

2553
01:46:32,580 --> 01:46:34,500
Let's do an hour. Let's do a quick.

2554
01:46:34,500 --> 01:46:36,140
It's own or just it's own.

2555
01:46:36,140 --> 01:46:38,340
And then we're breaking off the night writer into its own episode.

2556
01:46:39,580 --> 01:46:41,740
So it's it's like a hover car.

2557
01:46:42,860 --> 01:46:44,820
It has it has like those.

2558
01:46:44,820 --> 01:46:50,140
It's very Mario Kart, which apparently he is a big Mario Kart fan.

2559
01:46:50,140 --> 01:46:54,140
We heard the little inside dirt that he plays pre show pre

2560
01:46:54,140 --> 01:46:59,340
taping Mario Kart games with people and is very competitive at this.

2561
01:46:59,340 --> 01:47:00,780
So maybe this whole thing was made.

2562
01:47:00,780 --> 01:47:02,660
They must have pitched it to him often.

2563
01:47:02,660 --> 01:47:05,300
It succeeded based off of his Mario Kart love.

2564
01:47:05,300 --> 01:47:09,980
But once again, very, very bizarre that for a guy who is so deliberate

2565
01:47:09,980 --> 01:47:13,820
about building his public image that on the show, his persona is.

2566
01:47:13,820 --> 01:47:16,700
I always let the celebrity win backstage.

2567
01:47:16,700 --> 01:47:19,340
His persona is you have to let me win Mario Kart.

2568
01:47:19,580 --> 01:47:22,020
And the ride is I need to fucking beat you.

2569
01:47:22,380 --> 01:47:25,780
Like even though the audience barely ekes out a winning at the end,

2570
01:47:25,780 --> 01:47:29,940
the ride is competitive in a way that it sounds like real Jimmy Fallon is.

2571
01:47:30,260 --> 01:47:34,500
But on camera, Jimmy Fallon tries not to be right.

2572
01:47:34,500 --> 01:47:36,700
Real psych. This is a very revealing ride.

2573
01:47:37,500 --> 01:47:39,180
I I was looking.

2574
01:47:39,180 --> 01:47:41,940
I mean, there's not a ton of insight with newer rides.

2575
01:47:41,940 --> 01:47:44,940
There's never a ton of insight into the process.

2576
01:47:45,380 --> 01:47:49,060
Sure. But it does feel like he has, as you were saying,

2577
01:47:49,060 --> 01:47:53,020
if he truly pitched things, he does have some influence on this.

2578
01:47:53,260 --> 01:47:56,900
He kept on talking about how badly he wanted this ride to happen,

2579
01:47:56,900 --> 01:47:59,900
how he kept on pitching it to them, that he thought like,

2580
01:47:59,900 --> 01:48:02,060
I even think the New York premise was his.

2581
01:48:02,900 --> 01:48:06,700
I mean, how much of that is like, you know, PR spin.

2582
01:48:06,700 --> 01:48:09,860
But it really feels like this dude

2583
01:48:09,860 --> 01:48:14,620
spent eight years biding time until Universal finally decided

2584
01:48:14,900 --> 01:48:18,620
that he was valuable enough to build a ride around.

2585
01:48:18,620 --> 01:48:22,380
It's tough because today's show Cafe, if that didn't open,

2586
01:48:22,580 --> 01:48:26,260
I wouldn't question that fact more. You know what I mean?

2587
01:48:26,540 --> 01:48:30,540
The idea that they're opening up other things in the NBC

2588
01:48:30,540 --> 01:48:34,140
Comcast Universal Family makes me a little suspicious

2589
01:48:34,140 --> 01:48:37,100
that this was always something that was so in the forefront of his mind.

2590
01:48:37,100 --> 01:48:38,700
But who knows?

2591
01:48:38,700 --> 01:48:40,540
But I think also he.

2592
01:48:40,540 --> 01:48:43,980
Go ahead. Defend the Tonight Show, the Today Show Cafe.

2593
01:48:44,420 --> 01:48:45,580
Here we go.

2594
01:48:46,860 --> 01:48:47,980
Here comes the stand.

2595
01:48:47,980 --> 01:48:50,140
Sound design is excellent in there.

2596
01:48:50,140 --> 01:48:51,220
Hear the L.

2597
01:48:51,220 --> 01:48:53,900
Roker voice very clearly.

2598
01:48:54,140 --> 01:48:57,180
Getting out of it, that's a problem.

2599
01:48:57,180 --> 01:48:59,220
So the Today Show Cafe

2600
01:49:00,860 --> 01:49:03,060
replaced nothing.

2601
01:49:03,100 --> 01:49:04,460
It was just bakery.

2602
01:49:04,460 --> 01:49:06,740
It was just Hollywood bakery.

2603
01:49:06,740 --> 01:49:11,260
So I kind of get why they made like, well, you painted orange,

2604
01:49:11,260 --> 01:49:14,940
you put the logo on it and and they're trying to like

2605
01:49:15,180 --> 01:49:16,780
up their food game a little.

2606
01:49:16,780 --> 01:49:20,620
So maybe we can test this out because it's mostly getting people

2607
01:49:20,620 --> 01:49:24,300
getting something quick when they're walking in the park or walking out of the park.

2608
01:49:24,660 --> 01:49:27,180
So I I kind of get that.

2609
01:49:27,260 --> 01:49:28,900
I do kind of get that.

2610
01:49:28,900 --> 01:49:29,900
I'm not putting it down.

2611
01:49:29,900 --> 01:49:32,940
I'm just saying that I'm calling it to question

2612
01:49:32,980 --> 01:49:37,060
maybe that it was such an aggressive part of Jimmy's part to get the ride

2613
01:49:37,220 --> 01:49:40,860
when they both opened Today Show Cafe and this Tonight Show ride

2614
01:49:40,860 --> 01:49:42,660
at very similar time frames.

2615
01:49:42,660 --> 01:49:43,660
That's all I'm saying.

2616
01:49:43,660 --> 01:49:47,900
Yeah, I'm saying it feels like a very purposeful idea from the company

2617
01:49:47,900 --> 01:49:50,900
to start branding things in the theme park like.

2618
01:49:51,420 --> 01:49:53,340
Yeah, Tonight Today Show tonight.

2619
01:49:53,380 --> 01:49:54,780
OK, I guess. Yeah.

2620
01:49:54,780 --> 01:49:58,620
But but also like the Tonight Show and the Today Show

2621
01:49:58,660 --> 01:50:03,140
are both these like evergreen brands that have lasted for decades.

2622
01:50:03,180 --> 01:50:05,180
Right. Different hosts and all of that.

2623
01:50:05,460 --> 01:50:09,580
And the Today Show Cafe, which I have not had the pleasure of going to myself,

2624
01:50:09,980 --> 01:50:14,980
seems to be much more a tribute to the larger idea of the Today Show

2625
01:50:14,980 --> 01:50:19,980
and the entire history of it in the sense that it was not a restaurant

2626
01:50:19,980 --> 01:50:23,980
that could be foiled by Matt Lauer news coming out.

2627
01:50:24,020 --> 01:50:27,740
You know, like they didn't have to cancel the doing this at all

2628
01:50:27,740 --> 01:50:29,700
because of Matt Lauer. Right. Right.

2629
01:50:29,700 --> 01:50:31,940
In a way that like this is another thing for me,

2630
01:50:31,940 --> 01:50:35,580
and I don't want to imply that I'm sitting on any knowledge because I'm not.

2631
01:50:35,940 --> 01:50:40,700
But I'm starting to know what I'm truly not.

2632
01:50:40,780 --> 01:50:44,500
You know, I've heard things about Fallon that are just like, huh,

2633
01:50:44,500 --> 01:50:45,380
that's interesting.

2634
01:50:45,380 --> 01:50:48,660
But I've never heard anything that is like cancelable in the least.

2635
01:50:49,340 --> 01:50:56,060
But it is very interesting that this ride opens in like 2017.

2636
01:50:57,020 --> 01:51:01,580
Spring and fall 2017 is when the first

2637
01:51:01,580 --> 01:51:03,980
Harvey Weinstein stories start getting published.

2638
01:51:04,300 --> 01:51:07,500
And then where are you going with this?

2639
01:51:07,500 --> 01:51:10,300
This one's like I'm not saying in a conspiratorial way,

2640
01:51:10,540 --> 01:51:14,980
but I feel like it is important to think about the fact that this ride was created

2641
01:51:14,980 --> 01:51:18,820
at the last window where studios felt like

2642
01:51:19,580 --> 01:51:22,420
if someone's big enough, they can never be taken down.

2643
01:51:23,180 --> 01:51:25,580
And I want to be clear, I'm not saying this about Fallon.

2644
01:51:25,580 --> 01:51:27,780
I don't think he has these skeletons in his closet,

2645
01:51:27,980 --> 01:51:31,060
but it just feels like a year later, a company would be like,

2646
01:51:31,260 --> 01:51:34,660
we cannot invest this much money into one person,

2647
01:51:34,900 --> 01:51:40,380
and especially not a character played by one person, but that person as themself.

2648
01:51:40,980 --> 01:51:45,260
Because people's public standing is pretty, you know, it's

2649
01:51:45,260 --> 01:51:47,900
everyone's on a razor's edge these days.

2650
01:51:47,900 --> 01:51:51,140
You know, you can tell the company is like at any moment

2651
01:51:51,140 --> 01:51:53,500
we could have to distance ourselves from anybody.

2652
01:51:54,300 --> 01:51:56,700
Do you think maybe, though, they have it in the computer

2653
01:51:56,700 --> 01:52:00,940
where they can easily just replace his head with the new Tonight Show host?

2654
01:52:01,700 --> 01:52:04,180
They have a Jack Parr. Yeah, it goes to the ghost.

2655
01:52:04,180 --> 01:52:07,180
Or they yes, in the interim, when they're figuring out who the new Tonight

2656
01:52:07,180 --> 01:52:10,220
Show host would be, they just throw Jack Parr's head on there.

2657
01:52:10,540 --> 01:52:13,460
And Jack Parr, like they have a sound to like do all the lines.

2658
01:52:14,060 --> 01:52:18,940
Mike, I would completely believe that if this were just a generic race

2659
01:52:18,940 --> 01:52:23,300
through New York and not a race that features so many Fallon characters.

2660
01:52:23,460 --> 01:52:27,660
Like, that's the thing I always come back to, is they built a ride

2661
01:52:27,660 --> 01:52:31,940
that is in no way modular without having to scrap the entire thing.

2662
01:52:32,140 --> 01:52:36,500
Like they can't even go, fuck it, let's make it a different thing at 30 Rock

2663
01:52:36,780 --> 01:52:40,060
without having to change everything about the ride itself.

2664
01:52:40,620 --> 01:52:43,340
But not maybe not the theater and not the lobby.

2665
01:52:43,340 --> 01:52:45,620
And it's not like totally a stardo.

2666
01:52:46,100 --> 01:52:49,260
That might have been a purposeful design in the same way that now

2667
01:52:49,260 --> 01:52:52,380
it's the DreamWorks theater that shows Kung Fu Panda

2668
01:52:52,380 --> 01:52:56,380
and the outside isn't themed anymore so they can slide things in and out.

2669
01:52:56,420 --> 01:52:59,380
Right. But in the sense that like you couldn't just reshoot this

2670
01:52:59,380 --> 01:53:03,780
with a new person filling the Fallon role and keep everything else around it.

2671
01:53:03,860 --> 01:53:06,140
You would have to scrap all the video.

2672
01:53:06,140 --> 01:53:08,540
You know, well, you'd have to get rid of the characters.

2673
01:53:08,940 --> 01:53:13,380
I mean, you could put Steve Allen's famous characters in place

2674
01:53:14,020 --> 01:53:18,060
of the Panda, or you could put Johnny's famous characters like.

2675
01:53:18,100 --> 01:53:20,980
We're going back. We're going all the way back to Steve Allen.

2676
01:53:21,300 --> 01:53:23,020
That's going to be the plan.

2677
01:53:23,020 --> 01:53:25,820
Let's do it. Be legends.

2678
01:53:25,820 --> 01:53:28,780
You could you could make this an SNL ride, right?

2679
01:53:28,780 --> 01:53:32,620
You if you imagine they still kept all the digital elements, right?

2680
01:53:32,900 --> 01:53:37,140
You could make this an SNL ride where Lauren Michaels is in his, you know,

2681
01:53:37,140 --> 01:53:39,740
SNL low rider or whatever it's called.

2682
01:53:40,180 --> 01:53:43,940
And he's racing Saturday Night Live writer. Right. Right.

2683
01:53:44,180 --> 01:53:47,100
And all the different characters pop up.

2684
01:53:47,100 --> 01:53:51,140
And those would be modular enough that if someone became more or less popular,

2685
01:53:51,140 --> 01:53:53,420
you could remove them or add them, you know.

2686
01:53:54,060 --> 01:53:59,180
But this just feels like so built around things that are are gabbling,

2687
01:53:59,180 --> 01:54:01,100
you know, are just like, yeah, sure.

2688
01:54:01,100 --> 01:54:02,780
Being yelled at us, we like.

2689
01:54:02,780 --> 01:54:07,500
But I would argue like since since this is so similar to other rides,

2690
01:54:07,500 --> 01:54:11,500
like for Transformers, Transformers does a scene where they pick you up,

2691
01:54:11,780 --> 01:54:15,060
drag you along, flying behind them in a city street.

2692
01:54:15,460 --> 01:54:19,420
This looks so much worse than the Transformers ride.

2693
01:54:19,740 --> 01:54:22,940
Yeah, it's clearly a much cheaper version.

2694
01:54:23,300 --> 01:54:27,380
So I wonder if part of it was like, we're not going to spend too much money

2695
01:54:27,860 --> 01:54:30,500
making this as high level as Transformers.

2696
01:54:31,660 --> 01:54:36,540
Are you are you disappointed in a ride that lets you go to the marquee

2697
01:54:36,540 --> 01:54:39,500
of the Times Square Hard Rock Cafe?

2698
01:54:39,820 --> 01:54:44,420
You get to stare at the Hard Rock Cafe logo in a ride.

2699
01:54:45,500 --> 01:54:47,020
I am I do like that.

2700
01:54:47,020 --> 01:54:52,300
I just wish we spent another couple seconds being able to enjoy the majestic sign.

2701
01:54:52,740 --> 01:54:55,140
I will say and Griffin will appreciate this.

2702
01:54:55,300 --> 01:54:59,580
It's a bummer that you can see that toys, Toys R Us Times Square.

2703
01:54:59,980 --> 01:55:01,700
Yeah. Oh, and it's gone.

2704
01:55:01,700 --> 01:55:03,020
It's gone. Yeah.

2705
01:55:03,020 --> 01:55:04,780
It was a great fun store.

2706
01:55:04,780 --> 01:55:07,180
My favorite place in the world.

2707
01:55:07,180 --> 01:55:09,700
It had all it was fun.

2708
01:55:10,100 --> 01:55:12,900
The giant dinosaur wonka.

2709
01:55:13,140 --> 01:55:16,860
Yeah, you know that that Times Square Toys R Us had a better ride

2710
01:55:16,860 --> 01:55:19,380
than the ride you're on when he zooms past it.

2711
01:55:19,860 --> 01:55:21,020
Was there a ride in there?

2712
01:55:21,020 --> 01:55:22,220
There was a Ferris wheel.

2713
01:55:22,220 --> 01:55:24,900
There was a full size wheel.

2714
01:55:24,900 --> 01:55:28,100
Was it four stories or three? Yeah, four stories.

2715
01:55:28,940 --> 01:55:29,980
My God.

2716
01:55:29,980 --> 01:55:31,780
Truly so fun.

2717
01:55:31,780 --> 01:55:33,900
So great. So fun.

2718
01:55:33,900 --> 01:55:38,180
Wow. And then Mitt Romney's company ruined it.

2719
01:55:38,740 --> 01:55:42,500
Each car in the Ferris reel was was differently themed.

2720
01:55:42,500 --> 01:55:46,580
Like there was like an E.T. car, Nickelodeon car and a cabbage patch.

2721
01:55:46,580 --> 01:55:48,820
And like you get to hang out with your friends.

2722
01:55:48,900 --> 01:55:50,700
It was so good.

2723
01:55:50,700 --> 01:55:55,060
But in this ride, you get the Tonight Rider,

2724
01:55:55,740 --> 01:55:59,540
which I just I my other thought I wanted to get out about the tonight.

2725
01:55:59,780 --> 01:56:04,300
Is it a is it an Air Force One situation

2726
01:56:04,300 --> 01:56:07,940
where just once you're installed, you have access to the Tonight Rider

2727
01:56:07,940 --> 01:56:10,260
where they're proto tonight riders?

2728
01:56:10,260 --> 01:56:15,260
Did Steve Allen have like a, you know, more janky or jalopy version?

2729
01:56:15,260 --> 01:56:19,460
Was this a Leno program to begin with because he's such a vehicle guy?

2730
01:56:19,460 --> 01:56:21,420
And now now all the hosts get did

2731
01:56:22,780 --> 01:56:26,620
Conan get it and then have to turn in the keys immediately.

2732
01:56:27,340 --> 01:56:29,500
When was Conan's Tonight Rider?

2733
01:56:29,500 --> 01:56:32,780
It's just that 1995 sedan he tried to sell.

2734
01:56:36,100 --> 01:56:37,980
Which was in the parking lot at Warner Brothers.

2735
01:56:37,980 --> 01:56:39,820
And I worry that that like really.

2736
01:56:39,820 --> 01:56:42,620
Yeah, the parking lot where the Ellen audience part just had

2737
01:56:43,220 --> 01:56:45,140
his Conan's old car covered.

2738
01:56:45,140 --> 01:56:46,300
Yeah. Wow.

2739
01:56:46,300 --> 01:56:47,660
The send they have.

2740
01:56:47,660 --> 01:56:51,940
Not only does like Conan steering the desk through New York

2741
01:56:51,940 --> 01:56:55,140
work as as a cleaner entry point for a ride,

2742
01:56:55,580 --> 01:57:00,940
even just the short tonight show tenure of Conan O'Brien

2743
01:57:00,940 --> 01:57:05,020
has the Bugatti Veyron mouse like as a better vehicle.

2744
01:57:05,260 --> 01:57:09,300
Oh, yeah. They invented a great comedy vehicle. Right.

2745
01:57:10,060 --> 01:57:11,700
But but you write you.

2746
01:57:11,700 --> 01:57:16,420
I mean, God, the Tonight Rider, the more strings you pull at,

2747
01:57:16,620 --> 01:57:20,100
the more questions you ask, you know, because you know,

2748
01:57:20,100 --> 01:57:22,820
I feel like when people complain about how much the world sucks,

2749
01:57:22,820 --> 01:57:26,540
they always do that hacky thing of like, oh, you know, the future.

2750
01:57:26,540 --> 01:57:30,420
We were promised with all this shit like flying cars that never came to be.

2751
01:57:30,660 --> 01:57:35,780
And this ride presupposes that flying cars do exist.

2752
01:57:36,100 --> 01:57:40,100
The technology is hush hush and only Jimmy Fallon has access to it.

2753
01:57:41,260 --> 01:57:45,060
Waited until this race, until we were in his home to tell us,

2754
01:57:45,060 --> 01:57:47,460
I have this thing and you can't use it.

2755
01:57:47,460 --> 01:57:49,020
You're here to go on a ride.

2756
01:57:49,020 --> 01:57:52,020
And instead, I'm going to go on the ride and you're going to watch me.

2757
01:57:53,540 --> 01:57:55,780
You're going to get dragged along behind.

2758
01:57:55,780 --> 01:57:57,820
Yeah. Is that what's happening also?

2759
01:57:57,820 --> 01:57:59,100
How are we moving?

2760
01:57:59,100 --> 01:58:01,940
I don't know. Unclear. It's very unclear.

2761
01:58:02,500 --> 01:58:04,540
The whole right. Yeah. The whole theater.

2762
01:58:04,540 --> 01:58:06,980
It's there's no unless I missed it.

2763
01:58:06,980 --> 01:58:09,540
There's like a throwaway line that I missed it where he's like,

2764
01:58:09,540 --> 01:58:12,180
also, you're in a tonight rider, too.

2765
01:58:12,180 --> 01:58:13,420
But I don't think so.

2766
01:58:13,420 --> 01:58:16,100
The audience is one big tonight rider. Yeah. There's no explanation.

2767
01:58:16,100 --> 01:58:18,140
I scrubbed back and it really is.

2768
01:58:18,140 --> 01:58:20,140
The opening is curtains open.

2769
01:58:20,140 --> 01:58:22,420
Higgins goes, ah, Jimmy Fallon.

2770
01:58:22,580 --> 01:58:27,940
And then Fallon swerves out in the tonight rider and goes, hey, let's race.

2771
01:58:28,220 --> 01:58:30,660
Like, it's that fast. Yeah.

2772
01:58:30,820 --> 01:58:34,700
Right. And tonight rider obviously is a play on night rider,

2773
01:58:34,700 --> 01:58:37,100
which is not the name of that car.

2774
01:58:37,100 --> 01:58:39,020
And it's not the style of that car.

2775
01:58:39,020 --> 01:58:41,180
It's not the style that car doesn't talk to him because that's.

2776
01:58:41,180 --> 01:58:44,060
And people said there were articles that were like, it's the you know,

2777
01:58:44,060 --> 01:58:46,420
and in a nod to NBC history.

2778
01:58:46,580 --> 01:58:49,980
But there's nothing else that's a nod to NBC history in the ride.

2779
01:58:50,020 --> 01:58:52,660
Once again, I know we're repeating the same points here,

2780
01:58:52,660 --> 01:58:57,260
but in the same way that the the studio tour is like a ride through

2781
01:58:57,540 --> 01:59:01,660
universal pictures history, this ride could have been

2782
01:59:01,980 --> 01:59:05,060
Jimmy Fallon rides through NBC history

2783
01:59:05,260 --> 01:59:09,700
and you see different elements from iconic NBC shows over the decades.

2784
01:59:09,940 --> 01:59:13,620
He is driving kit, you know, you be time travels.

2785
01:59:13,620 --> 01:59:16,020
He goes so that you can go into night rider.

2786
01:59:16,460 --> 01:59:19,180
I don't know what else is what else is exciting for me?

2787
01:59:19,220 --> 01:59:23,260
You know, the Munsters, you drive alongside the Munster mobile.

2788
01:59:23,260 --> 01:59:25,820
Dracula. Oh, that's right.

2789
01:59:25,820 --> 01:59:27,780
Yeah, I do. I feel bad.

2790
01:59:27,780 --> 01:59:29,620
I dropped that. I didn't get the name.

2791
01:59:29,620 --> 01:59:33,340
People would be more excited if this ride, for example,

2792
01:59:33,420 --> 01:59:36,020
went through the offices of Dunder Mifflin.

2793
01:59:36,260 --> 01:59:38,940
Then they are going to the moon with Jimmy Fallon.

2794
01:59:39,060 --> 01:59:41,780
A regular person is would love would love that.

2795
01:59:42,860 --> 01:59:46,180
If they were regular, they'd love it.

2796
01:59:46,180 --> 01:59:47,020
Are you regular?

2797
01:59:47,020 --> 01:59:50,420
These would eat that up.

2798
01:59:50,420 --> 01:59:52,300
I'm not sure what I'm implying there.

2799
01:59:53,300 --> 01:59:56,980
I have a person like me who watched the office for a little while

2800
01:59:56,980 --> 01:59:58,140
and then kind of stopped.

2801
01:59:58,140 --> 02:00:01,140
Yeah, yeah. Not to what after Jim and Pam got together. Yeah. Yeah.

2802
02:00:02,100 --> 02:00:06,140
If you really step back and start, as you say, Griffin, pull at the strings.

2803
02:00:06,460 --> 02:00:09,300
This whole building is insane.

2804
02:00:09,340 --> 02:00:13,860
This is a facsimile of a New York skyscraper

2805
02:00:14,140 --> 02:00:17,820
named after an insanely wealthy oil magnet.

2806
02:00:17,820 --> 02:00:20,580
Is that what the Rockefellers were known for? Or just money?

2807
02:00:20,580 --> 02:00:22,580
They just made money. They just made the money.

2808
02:00:23,540 --> 02:00:25,220
They were they were in the money business.

2809
02:00:25,220 --> 02:00:27,900
I think they were in the money business. Yeah.

2810
02:00:27,900 --> 02:00:31,060
A building filled with Diego Rivera murals

2811
02:00:31,060 --> 02:00:33,980
that the Rockefeller was always fighting with him about.

2812
02:00:34,300 --> 02:00:38,700
And that then became the home of a major player

2813
02:00:38,700 --> 02:00:43,060
in the history of radio and then television that was then owned

2814
02:00:43,060 --> 02:00:47,820
by any number of like the the implications of building

2815
02:00:47,860 --> 02:00:49,820
a facsimile of this.

2816
02:00:49,820 --> 02:00:51,060
It's truly insane.

2817
02:00:51,060 --> 02:00:53,900
And then what's inside of it is even crazier. Right.

2818
02:00:53,940 --> 02:00:57,700
But also like a building where like a bunch of HR people and like accountants

2819
02:00:57,700 --> 02:01:00,700
work like there is a lot of glamour to 30 Rock.

2820
02:01:00,700 --> 02:01:04,500
But there's something just about being in a park where you're like,

2821
02:01:04,500 --> 02:01:09,060
oh, my God, there's the Jurassic Park and there's Hogwarts Castle.

2822
02:01:09,060 --> 02:01:13,500
And there's an actual building I could walk by if I go to New York City.

2823
02:01:13,660 --> 02:01:17,180
You know, there's a there's a Panera in the basement. Right.

2824
02:01:17,180 --> 02:01:18,460
I mean, that's the thing.

2825
02:01:18,460 --> 02:01:22,140
There's so much about it that's just a little too banal for a theme park,

2826
02:01:22,340 --> 02:01:25,780
even if it is a very nice looking historic building.

2827
02:01:26,220 --> 02:01:27,300
Yeah. Right.

2828
02:01:27,300 --> 02:01:28,860
So then does it make up?

2829
02:01:28,860 --> 02:01:33,020
Does it is do they make up for any of these points by going to

2830
02:01:33,260 --> 02:01:37,660
the more outlandish places because it is regular New York stuff

2831
02:01:37,660 --> 02:01:41,980
until you then the Tonight Rider begins to fly.

2832
02:01:41,980 --> 02:01:45,820
And then you go to the Statue of Liberty and then into space

2833
02:01:46,020 --> 02:01:47,620
and then into a tube.

2834
02:01:47,620 --> 02:01:49,220
Does this fix anything you're talking about?

2835
02:01:49,220 --> 02:01:51,980
Because it's all it's it's outlandish. It's bigger.

2836
02:01:53,420 --> 02:01:58,620
Hmm. But there's no grounding like this is this really is like

2837
02:01:59,260 --> 02:02:02,860
improv scenes I've coached where it's like, this is too much.

2838
02:02:03,180 --> 02:02:05,820
Like I know rides, you only have three minutes.

2839
02:02:05,820 --> 02:02:09,780
You got to get a lot of stuff in a ride and have like make people feel a bunch

2840
02:02:09,780 --> 02:02:11,020
of stuff and get excited.

2841
02:02:11,020 --> 02:02:15,180
But it's just like, whoa, this goes zero to 60 too quickly.

2842
02:02:15,580 --> 02:02:17,100
Yeah, I think that's the problem.

2843
02:02:17,100 --> 02:02:22,420
As Jason said, is just like everything that's happening is so insane.

2844
02:02:22,420 --> 02:02:25,180
Like I'm just watching the video here in a little window.

2845
02:02:25,820 --> 02:02:27,700
Curtains open. Fallon's there.

2846
02:02:27,700 --> 02:02:30,140
Let's race already. You're racing with him.

2847
02:02:30,300 --> 02:02:34,140
No explanation of the fact that you apparently are a vehicle

2848
02:02:34,660 --> 02:02:36,420
that you share with everyone else.

2849
02:02:36,420 --> 02:02:38,100
Then you're steering down the hallways.

2850
02:02:38,100 --> 02:02:41,020
And I'm starting to settle into this ride and going, OK,

2851
02:02:41,020 --> 02:02:43,860
I guess this ride is going to go through all of 30 Rock.

2852
02:02:44,060 --> 02:02:48,780
But then pretty quickly, he drives through a wall out into the street.

2853
02:02:48,980 --> 02:02:50,500
So now you're in New York City.

2854
02:02:50,500 --> 02:02:54,820
Now you're driving around from like Rockefeller Center down to Times Square.

2855
02:02:55,060 --> 02:02:58,060
And then it takes so little time for him to start flying.

2856
02:02:58,700 --> 02:03:02,180
Yeah, like every time you think you almost get what the ride's going to be,

2857
02:03:02,180 --> 02:03:06,220
I guess maybe it's like it's it's a theme park version

2858
02:03:06,220 --> 02:03:08,380
of seeing the sights of New York City.

2859
02:03:08,380 --> 02:03:12,580
Then it just ups it to something crazy where you're so distracted by weight.

2860
02:03:12,580 --> 02:03:16,420
This car can fly that when that part happened, I was like,

2861
02:03:17,020 --> 02:03:19,020
they fly now.

2862
02:03:19,380 --> 02:03:20,740
They fly now.

2863
02:03:20,740 --> 02:03:23,100
Tonight, writers fly now.

2864
02:03:23,100 --> 02:03:24,500
They fly now.

2865
02:03:24,500 --> 02:03:26,500
They fly now.

2866
02:03:29,460 --> 02:03:30,100
We just watch.

2867
02:03:30,100 --> 02:03:32,740
I swear, we just watched they fly now last night.

2868
02:03:33,980 --> 02:03:35,620
You watched the movie again.

2869
02:03:35,620 --> 02:03:38,620
No, no, I zoomed through it to the parts that I like.

2870
02:03:38,780 --> 02:03:39,500
OK, good.

2871
02:03:39,500 --> 02:03:42,020
I was going to say, why are you?

2872
02:03:42,060 --> 02:03:43,580
Why are you torturing yourself?

2873
02:03:43,580 --> 02:03:47,420
Yeah, but that's like there are so many rides or attractions, let me say,

2874
02:03:47,420 --> 02:03:52,700
like Ellen's and energy adventure, right, where it's based around a person.

2875
02:03:52,700 --> 02:03:56,660
But it's like that person is plugged into some larger idea.

2876
02:03:57,460 --> 02:04:01,500
So there could be a thing that's like it's race through New York with Jimmy Fallon.

2877
02:04:01,500 --> 02:04:03,700
And it's just about seeing the sights of New York City.

2878
02:04:03,900 --> 02:04:07,980
Or there could be a ride that's like journey into space with Jimmy Fallon.

2879
02:04:08,140 --> 02:04:11,180
And the exact premise is Jimmy Fallon

2880
02:04:11,340 --> 02:04:17,060
has been given the first opportunity to pilot a spaceship.

2881
02:04:17,060 --> 02:04:20,140
It's the first commercial spaceship.

2882
02:04:20,260 --> 02:04:22,580
And you're all going to join him in space.

2883
02:04:22,740 --> 02:04:26,220
And then you can do your fucking Jimmy Fallon on the moon ride, whatever.

2884
02:04:26,380 --> 02:04:29,700
You just need to do that basic amount of world building.

2885
02:04:29,860 --> 02:04:33,300
But this is just the guy who hosts the show

2886
02:04:33,300 --> 02:04:36,620
likes to casually go underwater and to the moon

2887
02:04:36,980 --> 02:04:39,340
every time before he tapes a talk show.

2888
02:04:40,340 --> 02:04:43,420
It feels like we were talking about this a little earlier.

2889
02:04:43,420 --> 02:04:47,220
OK, so 2016 is when Kong opens

2890
02:04:47,900 --> 02:04:53,300
and then 2017 is Fallon, 2018 Fast and Furious.

2891
02:04:54,220 --> 02:04:57,020
It feels like they're all sort of and I think this is probably

2892
02:04:57,020 --> 02:05:00,180
the least successful, the Fallon one, but they're all in the same CGI

2893
02:05:00,180 --> 02:05:02,780
world of stuff happens and you don't even know what's going on.

2894
02:05:02,780 --> 02:05:08,420
And the Fast and Furious is very guilty of 3D nonsense with no explanation.

2895
02:05:08,660 --> 02:05:13,340
I also wonder if part of it was just that, like the time was the thinking there

2896
02:05:13,940 --> 02:05:19,460
at Universal as well, where it was like, just throw a bunch of shit at everybody.

2897
02:05:19,700 --> 02:05:24,140
Like, don't worry so hard about anything, because I don't remember.

2898
02:05:24,300 --> 02:05:28,060
I think Kong is the most successful one, both on the tour and Skull Island.

2899
02:05:28,060 --> 02:05:30,460
But people are still fine.

2900
02:05:30,940 --> 02:05:32,460
You want to see that giant monkey head.

2901
02:05:32,460 --> 02:05:35,580
Ultimately, you want to see a full body monkey, of course.

2902
02:05:35,860 --> 02:05:39,100
But I wonder if it's also the philosophy of the company

2903
02:05:39,100 --> 02:05:41,460
at the time of just like just things blow up.

2904
02:05:42,220 --> 02:05:45,500
People will feel movement and they won't ask questions.

2905
02:05:45,540 --> 02:05:46,420
Don't worry about it.

2906
02:05:46,420 --> 02:05:50,900
And their messaging for The Secret Life of Pets ride was so deliberate in the like,

2907
02:05:50,900 --> 02:05:53,020
look, it's not a screen ride. We built stuff.

2908
02:05:53,020 --> 02:05:54,300
Look, we're listening.

2909
02:05:54,300 --> 02:05:57,860
Like, you're right that this was a period where they just went

2910
02:05:58,500 --> 02:06:02,780
crazy overboard with the same bag of tricks over and over again.

2911
02:06:02,940 --> 02:06:06,860
If you even extend it to like you go, it's it's Transformers,

2912
02:06:06,860 --> 02:06:11,140
Simpsons, this Fast and Furious Supercharged Kong.

2913
02:06:11,140 --> 02:06:15,780
It's a lot of the same sort of shit sprays smells.

2914
02:06:15,820 --> 02:06:20,180
And it's the it's getting worse to Simpsons.

2915
02:06:20,180 --> 02:06:22,020
I like Transformers. I like.

2916
02:06:22,020 --> 02:06:23,860
And then it starts just going off the cliff.

2917
02:06:23,860 --> 02:06:26,380
Like it doesn't. Yes. Approve on those ideas.

2918
02:06:26,980 --> 02:06:31,060
Well, Kong and Fast and Furious harken back to the very early days

2919
02:06:31,060 --> 02:06:36,100
of Universal Orlando, where it started on the studio tour and then was transported.

2920
02:06:36,380 --> 02:06:39,380
However, a lot of those early studio tour

2921
02:06:39,380 --> 02:06:42,420
originally like the stuff that was originally on the studio tour

2922
02:06:42,620 --> 02:06:44,540
became Universal Orlando attractions.

2923
02:06:44,540 --> 02:06:50,140
They really had to do a lot of work to like here is a unique Jaws experience.

2924
02:06:50,140 --> 02:06:53,380
Here's a unique confrontation experience.

2925
02:06:53,740 --> 02:06:58,820
And they kind of really they did like one thing at each Fast and Furious.

2926
02:06:58,940 --> 02:07:00,500
There's a lot of cars.

2927
02:07:00,500 --> 02:07:02,820
There's a lot of like computer rooms

2928
02:07:04,060 --> 02:07:06,340
where people are like hacking stuff.

2929
02:07:07,020 --> 02:07:09,340
There's stuff that kind of reminds me of the movies.

2930
02:07:09,340 --> 02:07:11,180
Kong Skull Island. OK.

2931
02:07:11,180 --> 02:07:15,020
The queue looks a little nice, but there's a big Kong right at the end.

2932
02:07:15,340 --> 02:07:19,780
So like they kind I feel like they kind of know we have to do something,

2933
02:07:20,220 --> 02:07:24,380
but we couldn't spend all this money and make a totally unique attraction.

2934
02:07:24,460 --> 02:07:27,340
You know, this isn't a Kong episode and this isn't a Fast and Furious

2935
02:07:27,340 --> 02:07:30,220
Supercharged episode. I just want to say I

2936
02:07:30,220 --> 02:07:34,620
I frequent the Hollywood Universal far more than the Orlando Universal.

2937
02:07:34,620 --> 02:07:38,740
Almost every time I'm in L.A. I go to Universal usually by myself.

2938
02:07:38,740 --> 02:07:42,300
I find it a very fun and relaxing thing to do since it's such a manageable park.

2939
02:07:42,660 --> 02:07:46,860
I have done the tour almost every time I've gone.

2940
02:07:47,380 --> 02:07:51,540
I've done the Fast and Furious and the Kong parts of the tour many times now.

2941
02:07:51,940 --> 02:07:54,260
I like both of them a lot on the tour.

2942
02:07:54,260 --> 02:07:56,340
I think they work super well on the tour.

2943
02:07:56,500 --> 02:07:59,340
And in both cases, when I heard they were going to bring them to Orlando,

2944
02:07:59,380 --> 02:08:03,820
I got excited about the idea of them running with the little morsel you get

2945
02:08:03,980 --> 02:08:06,340
and being able to blow it up into a full ride.

2946
02:08:06,540 --> 02:08:09,900
I think Kong just barely pulls it off.

2947
02:08:10,060 --> 02:08:13,180
I wish they had done more, but I think the theming is good.

2948
02:08:13,340 --> 02:08:17,020
I like the fact that it's sort of like an old universal like, hey,

2949
02:08:17,020 --> 02:08:19,100
I'm your tour guide. Let's take you through here.

2950
02:08:19,260 --> 02:08:20,900
Oh, no, this isn't good.

2951
02:08:20,900 --> 02:08:23,660
And the robot at the end worth the price of admission.

2952
02:08:24,100 --> 02:08:27,540
I have not gotten to go on the Orlando Fast and Furious yet.

2953
02:08:27,860 --> 02:08:30,020
That is my favorite film franchise.

2954
02:08:30,860 --> 02:08:34,540
It really bums me out that they didn't really give a shit

2955
02:08:34,900 --> 02:08:37,580
because that is not enough to sustain an entire ride.

2956
02:08:37,700 --> 02:08:41,620
If you told me we're going to use what happens on the tour as the kernel

2957
02:08:42,020 --> 02:08:46,700
of a thing, we can expand until like a proper seven minute attraction.

2958
02:08:46,700 --> 02:08:48,620
I would be thrilled.

2959
02:08:48,620 --> 02:08:50,660
But it just seems like it's right.

2960
02:08:50,660 --> 02:08:52,580
Minimum effort. You're going to be upset.

2961
02:08:52,580 --> 02:08:54,820
That's what I've heard. That's what I heard.

2962
02:08:55,380 --> 02:09:00,380
So I I went back to Universal on the very last day before we flew out of Orlando.

2963
02:09:00,740 --> 02:09:04,300
And that was the last thing I did before I went to the airport.

2964
02:09:04,500 --> 02:09:08,460
And I was so I guess I got a bite to eat.

2965
02:09:08,460 --> 02:09:14,140
But like I I was like, guys, I'll you don't have to wait.

2966
02:09:14,140 --> 02:09:16,340
We don't have to wait. We can do Fast and the Furious.

2967
02:09:16,340 --> 02:09:18,980
I'll I'll be the bearer of bad news on that one.

2968
02:09:19,660 --> 02:09:21,580
Because I have notes for that.

2969
02:09:21,580 --> 02:09:23,620
I realize we never got around to doing it.

2970
02:09:23,620 --> 02:09:25,340
So we could do that in the future.

2971
02:09:25,340 --> 02:09:28,340
Yeah, well, definitely I can walk through it because there's some bunker.

2972
02:09:28,380 --> 02:09:33,380
There's some stuff in there that's like, oh, oh, that's what we're doing.

2973
02:09:33,500 --> 02:09:38,740
OK, like it's just yeah, it really doesn't translate because yeah, it's

2974
02:09:39,700 --> 02:09:42,020
I'd say 95 percent the studio tour.

2975
02:09:42,380 --> 02:09:45,700
And you think Fast and the Furious, I want to be in a souped up car.

2976
02:09:45,820 --> 02:09:47,700
That's the problem. I want to go fast. Right.

2977
02:09:47,700 --> 02:09:50,100
Nice try, asshole. You're not getting that.

2978
02:09:50,620 --> 02:09:53,940
You accepted on the studio tour because you've been watching.

2979
02:09:53,980 --> 02:09:57,580
You've been experiencing a very slow paced stroll through like

2980
02:09:57,580 --> 02:09:59,980
Wisteria Lane for 45 minutes.

2981
02:10:00,180 --> 02:10:03,620
Like it works in juxtaposition to what you've been experiencing

2982
02:10:03,620 --> 02:10:06,100
and understanding the ride vehicle you're on.

2983
02:10:06,580 --> 02:10:08,820
But then when I heard, oh, they're going to bring it to Orlando,

2984
02:10:08,820 --> 02:10:10,620
I was like, OK, but just run with it.

2985
02:10:10,620 --> 02:10:13,540
Please go a lot further than this.

2986
02:10:13,900 --> 02:10:15,860
And that sounds like it's just the same bullshit.

2987
02:10:15,860 --> 02:10:18,980
How are you how is there a Fast and Furious ride

2988
02:10:18,980 --> 02:10:21,060
where you are not in a car?

2989
02:10:21,060 --> 02:10:22,900
I know it's such madness.

2990
02:10:22,900 --> 02:10:26,660
And like if there was if if we found out that the Super Mario

2991
02:10:26,660 --> 02:10:31,220
Kart ride was you are in a bus and you look at cars,

2992
02:10:31,580 --> 02:10:33,420
mad people would burn the building down.

2993
02:10:33,420 --> 02:10:36,900
And a universal franchise that has made billions of dollars

2994
02:10:36,900 --> 02:10:41,420
that is going on 20 full years of major theatrical releases.

2995
02:10:41,580 --> 02:10:43,260
Like there's so much to pull from.

2996
02:10:43,260 --> 02:10:47,260
It clearly is something that isn't like a fad for them to commit

2997
02:10:47,260 --> 02:10:49,460
so much less to that.

2998
02:10:49,460 --> 02:10:51,900
Like that that is less effort than this.

2999
02:10:52,100 --> 02:10:55,060
It is crazy that they put less effort in the Fast and Furious ride

3000
02:10:55,060 --> 02:10:57,620
that they did in the Jimmy Fallon ride.

3001
02:10:57,620 --> 02:10:59,300
Is it is it worse, Jason?

3002
02:10:59,300 --> 02:11:01,460
What do you what's your call having been on it?

3003
02:11:02,340 --> 02:11:04,540
I think.

3004
02:11:05,460 --> 02:11:08,780
I think this is this is worse

3005
02:11:08,780 --> 02:11:11,900
as a ride, as an attraction.

3006
02:11:12,100 --> 02:11:15,420
I think Fast and Furious with the source material

3007
02:11:15,420 --> 02:11:17,980
might be more disappointing.

3008
02:11:18,020 --> 02:11:22,580
Yeah, because, yeah, that is you know, let's that is Universal's Avengers.

3009
02:11:22,980 --> 02:11:27,780
Right. And it's still going and it's going to keep going like forever.

3010
02:11:27,900 --> 02:11:29,100
And right.

3011
02:11:29,100 --> 02:11:33,020
Why wouldn't you just I mean, I guess the Mario Kart technology

3012
02:11:33,020 --> 02:11:37,060
wasn't ready yet and wasn't cheap and duplicatable.

3013
02:11:37,060 --> 02:11:38,940
But there are so many things.

3014
02:11:38,940 --> 02:11:42,300
Yes, there should be a Gringotts Fast and Furious with the roller

3015
02:11:42,300 --> 02:11:45,980
coaster cars that look like the rock and roller coaster cars. Yes.

3016
02:11:46,420 --> 02:11:48,620
You should get in a roller coaster that looks like a car.

3017
02:11:48,940 --> 02:11:51,780
You can put some screens to make it feel like you're going way faster

3018
02:11:51,780 --> 02:11:55,020
in certain places, but then actually give people like a thrill.

3019
02:11:55,660 --> 02:11:59,340
It also just feels like that the opening of Rock and Roller Coaster

3020
02:11:59,340 --> 02:12:02,580
should be the starting point of any Fast and Furious ride.

3021
02:12:02,740 --> 02:12:05,540
100 percent have a Fast and Furious ride that doesn't start with you

3022
02:12:05,540 --> 02:12:09,740
throttling and like hitting the nose and then suddenly going super fast,

3023
02:12:09,740 --> 02:12:11,380
even if it's screen based.

3024
02:12:11,380 --> 02:12:13,940
That's how the thing should fucking start.

3025
02:12:13,940 --> 02:12:19,100
Yes, it's not with like watching a very still party

3026
02:12:19,300 --> 02:12:23,780
where people are dancing in like a oddly corralled together way,

3027
02:12:23,780 --> 02:12:26,860
a way that's very distressing and COVID-19 era to watch.

3028
02:12:26,860 --> 02:12:29,500
Once again, stand close stand right next to each other.

3029
02:12:29,540 --> 02:12:32,260
Really jam together works on a tram tour.

3030
02:12:32,260 --> 02:12:34,860
Well, what you've previously been seeing is someone putting 40

3031
02:12:34,860 --> 02:12:38,180
percent effort into playing Norman Bates like that.

3032
02:12:40,180 --> 02:12:43,140
And it's and it's what you were saying about this.

3033
02:12:43,380 --> 02:12:46,940
This ride is not a classic universal and then things go awry.

3034
02:12:47,380 --> 02:12:49,700
The tour is that's completely the tour.

3035
02:12:49,700 --> 02:12:52,380
We're going to go into a sound stage, but something crazy happened

3036
02:12:52,380 --> 02:12:55,180
in the sound stage. And what's this building? Oh, my God.

3037
02:12:55,180 --> 02:12:57,940
We went in there and there was a car race and Vin Diesel and stuff.

3038
02:12:57,940 --> 02:12:59,620
And I'll say this. Yeah. Bare minimum.

3039
02:12:59,620 --> 02:13:05,380
It kind of it kind of does that because of like the setup of the tram tour.

3040
02:13:05,540 --> 02:13:06,820
Things are going wrong.

3041
02:13:06,820 --> 02:13:08,900
Things are coming out of the water, whatever.

3042
02:13:09,180 --> 02:13:11,220
Like the Fast and Furious at least has.

3043
02:13:12,460 --> 02:13:15,380
Once again, haven't been on Orlando, but within the studio tour

3044
02:13:15,580 --> 02:13:20,500
has the sort of building to explain why you're there,

3045
02:13:20,500 --> 02:13:26,020
why they need to escape, you know, like I feel like they fazed this out.

3046
02:13:26,020 --> 02:13:28,980
But when I first went on the Fast and Furious tram tour,

3047
02:13:29,700 --> 02:13:32,140
I call it the Fast and Furious tram tour, even though it's only the last

3048
02:13:32,580 --> 02:13:34,300
three minutes of it.

3049
02:13:34,300 --> 02:13:36,460
They certainly promoted it that way.

3050
02:13:36,580 --> 02:13:38,220
Yes, yeah, sure.

3051
02:13:38,220 --> 02:13:41,420
They do that thing or they used to do the thing where they would have

3052
02:13:41,420 --> 02:13:44,060
Dom's car at different locations.

3053
02:13:44,740 --> 02:13:48,300
Yeah. And the tour guide would go like, huh, that car doesn't belong here.

3054
02:13:48,300 --> 02:13:49,380
What's going on here?

3055
02:13:49,380 --> 02:13:53,500
And then they'd play over the PA like, be on the lookout for some fast racers.

3056
02:13:53,660 --> 02:13:54,700
Like, there's a bit of that.

3057
02:13:54,700 --> 02:13:56,460
Oh, I didn't know they did that. That's kind of cool.

3058
02:13:56,460 --> 02:13:59,660
I feel like they've scaled it back a little bit, but there was that sense of like,

3059
02:13:59,820 --> 02:14:02,340
you understand why this is happening to you.

3060
02:14:02,500 --> 02:14:04,780
You understand why you're getting caught up in this.

3061
02:14:04,940 --> 02:14:07,660
You understand why they need to get out of there so quickly.

3062
02:14:08,020 --> 02:14:10,260
The Fallon ride just does none of that.

3063
02:14:10,620 --> 02:14:14,460
None of that. The stakes are I want to beat you.

3064
02:14:15,500 --> 02:14:18,620
That's it. And we have no way to control.

3065
02:14:18,900 --> 02:14:20,260
He's completely in control.

3066
02:14:20,260 --> 02:14:22,420
And it's an accident whether we win or lose.

3067
02:14:22,420 --> 02:14:25,540
So there's no way for me to impact the bearing of the I kind of like to.

3068
02:14:25,900 --> 02:14:28,620
I do want to make sure we like step through everything.

3069
02:14:28,620 --> 02:14:30,300
You just explain things concisely.

3070
02:14:30,300 --> 02:14:33,140
What happens after that? We end up like

3071
02:14:33,180 --> 02:14:35,940
we're in Times Square. We meet Trev's pickle.

3072
02:14:36,660 --> 02:14:38,660
We go into the do we go into the subway?

3073
02:14:38,660 --> 02:14:40,500
Yes. After that, here you go.

3074
02:14:40,500 --> 02:14:44,860
Right. You go like 30 Rock Hallways to Rockefeller Center.

3075
02:14:45,020 --> 02:14:46,460
You drive down to Times Square.

3076
02:14:46,460 --> 02:14:48,540
You're in the heart of New York City.

3077
02:14:48,540 --> 02:14:52,220
And then he steers down into the subway.

3078
02:14:53,260 --> 02:14:56,620
Of course, goes by the ragtime gals, gets on the tracks.

3079
02:14:56,940 --> 02:15:00,020
You feel like maybe now it's going to be a fun Jimmy Fallon subway ride.

3080
02:15:00,020 --> 02:15:02,540
But no, he drives in the wrong direction.

3081
02:15:02,780 --> 02:15:04,020
The train is coming towards us.

3082
02:15:04,020 --> 02:15:07,220
It pushes us back essentially to where we started.

3083
02:15:07,860 --> 02:15:12,860
Then he goes above ground again and he passes by some construction workers.

3084
02:15:12,860 --> 02:15:14,180
Hey, what are you doing?

3085
02:15:14,180 --> 02:15:16,380
What is this New York City?

3086
02:15:16,380 --> 02:15:20,140
And also drives by Jimmy's Pizzeria, a place that does not exist.

3087
02:15:20,140 --> 02:15:22,740
A Jimmy Fallon based pizza chain.

3088
02:15:22,980 --> 02:15:26,580
It seems like he's maybe just in a different exit of Times Square.

3089
02:15:26,900 --> 02:15:28,700
And then he goes into space.

3090
02:15:28,700 --> 02:15:30,740
Then he starts riding through the skies.

3091
02:15:30,740 --> 02:15:34,820
When you meet you, you run into you, who we've established in the pre show,

3092
02:15:34,820 --> 02:15:36,620
likes puppies. Yes.

3093
02:15:36,620 --> 02:15:38,620
You is like,

3094
02:15:39,780 --> 02:15:44,060
is it the broadest performance ever given that anyone on camera?

3095
02:15:44,100 --> 02:15:47,140
Yes. So like the most hyperactive.

3096
02:15:47,740 --> 02:15:51,340
Well, you know, I'd have to like watch every tape of all that

3097
02:15:51,340 --> 02:15:53,340
and 90s Nickelodeon to be sure.

3098
02:15:53,340 --> 02:15:56,420
But I think this might be the broadest performance ever given.

3099
02:15:56,820 --> 02:15:59,020
I know a sketch like thing.

3100
02:15:59,020 --> 02:16:04,660
It's a comedy subject that I think is on its way of like, oh, teen girls.

3101
02:16:04,660 --> 02:16:09,380
Yeah. And I think like now most people doing comedy are like,

3102
02:16:09,380 --> 02:16:14,260
well, that's kind of diminishing to a large segment of young people is like,

3103
02:16:14,580 --> 02:16:16,500
oh, young women.

3104
02:16:16,500 --> 02:16:19,700
Disgusting. Like that's not what's funny there.

3105
02:16:19,700 --> 02:16:20,860
You're just being cruel.

3106
02:16:20,860 --> 02:16:24,900
You're being it's a trope that was already super creaky.

3107
02:16:24,940 --> 02:16:26,940
It was such well-worn territory.

3108
02:16:26,940 --> 02:16:29,460
And now in the last four years, people have been like,

3109
02:16:29,620 --> 02:16:34,340
it's actually kind of fucked up that it's a subject of ridicule to begin with.

3110
02:16:34,540 --> 02:16:38,580
Like it went from being unoriginal to now being borderline offensive.

3111
02:16:39,100 --> 02:16:43,180
Yeah, it's like, well, young women like young men have interests

3112
02:16:43,180 --> 02:16:47,500
and inner lives and intelligence and emotions like.

3113
02:16:47,500 --> 02:16:50,980
Yeah, it's like Jimmy doing a fucking impression of a 10 year old boy.

3114
02:16:51,020 --> 02:16:53,220
Let's act like that's any better.

3115
02:16:53,220 --> 02:16:55,700
You did that on SNL a number of times.

3116
02:16:55,700 --> 02:16:57,660
And it was funny.

3117
02:16:58,540 --> 02:17:02,500
This is the lesson learned by Sebastian Maniscalco at the VMAs

3118
02:17:02,500 --> 02:17:05,940
when his whole monologue to an audience of 12 year old girls was,

3119
02:17:06,060 --> 02:17:08,540
and we don't want to have our safe spaces.

3120
02:17:08,540 --> 02:17:10,980
OK, none of that PC.

3121
02:17:10,980 --> 02:17:15,060
And everyone just stared at him like, why are you like,

3122
02:17:15,820 --> 02:17:18,220
what are you scolding us about here?

3123
02:17:18,220 --> 02:17:20,260
Yeah, that may have that.

3124
02:17:20,260 --> 02:17:25,180
And then like, I can't artists doing the most high budget

3125
02:17:25,180 --> 02:17:28,940
Lizzo just doing costume changes within songs like

3126
02:17:29,260 --> 02:17:33,500
and just dancers and crazy like sets and yeah.

3127
02:17:33,740 --> 02:17:37,900
But doesn't that relationship, the relationship between Sebastian Maniscalco

3128
02:17:38,180 --> 02:17:41,180
trying to control an audience

3129
02:17:41,660 --> 02:17:44,780
who are there for the exact opposite of what he's good at?

3130
02:17:45,740 --> 02:17:48,060
He's good at yelling about ma's zucchini.

3131
02:17:48,060 --> 02:17:52,900
They are there to see singing and dancing and not hear about ma zucchini.

3132
02:17:53,140 --> 02:17:56,380
The Sunday sauce, it's got to cook all day.

3133
02:17:56,380 --> 02:17:58,300
It's got so much meat in it.

3134
02:17:58,300 --> 02:18:03,660
A complete mismatch of performer tradition and built in audience, right?

3135
02:18:04,180 --> 02:18:07,540
Compared to people like Lizzo at the top of their game,

3136
02:18:07,540 --> 02:18:11,060
exactly who the audience wants to see using the night to the best of their ability.

3137
02:18:11,300 --> 02:18:14,260
Isn't that kind of the relationship between the Jimmy Fallon ride

3138
02:18:14,260 --> 02:18:16,460
and most other rides at Universal?

3139
02:18:16,460 --> 02:18:19,020
Or you just look at it and you're like, what are you doing here?

3140
02:18:19,700 --> 02:18:22,300
This is you have your own spaces where you work.

3141
02:18:22,300 --> 02:18:24,140
This is not it.

3142
02:18:24,140 --> 02:18:27,500
This could be a ride where we go somewhere that we couldn't go.

3143
02:18:27,660 --> 02:18:31,900
If I want to see a taping of the show, I'll go to New York and see a taping of the show.

3144
02:18:31,900 --> 02:18:37,740
But I truly think that would make Jimmy Fallon feel like his show wasn't valuable enough.

3145
02:18:37,740 --> 02:18:39,780
That's what it always comes down to for me.

3146
02:18:39,780 --> 02:18:44,140
Like when you talk through the logic cycles of how this ride could have been better,

3147
02:18:44,420 --> 02:18:47,980
any of those things necessitate taking Jimmy Fallon

3148
02:18:48,140 --> 02:18:52,180
and applying him to something entirely different or bigger than himself.

3149
02:18:53,300 --> 02:18:55,700
Hmm. Wow. Wow. That's very.

3150
02:18:55,700 --> 02:18:58,660
Sedy stuff is powerful stuff.

3151
02:18:58,660 --> 02:19:02,580
Psychology is the reason why the it's a weird ride.

3152
02:19:02,820 --> 02:19:06,860
Right. But if it's through television history, if it's more about sightseeing

3153
02:19:06,860 --> 02:19:10,700
through New York, if it's any of those things, it becomes less about him and his show.

3154
02:19:10,900 --> 02:19:15,220
It becomes more about him merely being the host for some fun ride.

3155
02:19:15,220 --> 02:19:19,780
You're going to go on. Can Tom Shales do a book or can Bill Carter do a book

3156
02:19:19,820 --> 02:19:22,460
on the making of this ride?

3157
02:19:23,300 --> 02:19:26,140
Because I would love to know

3158
02:19:26,140 --> 02:19:28,020
exactly what the genesis of it is.

3159
02:19:28,020 --> 02:19:30,540
What you're saying makes a lot of sense.

3160
02:19:30,540 --> 02:19:31,660
And I wonder if it's true.

3161
02:19:31,660 --> 02:19:35,740
I wonder if anyone actually has documented the process by which this went through.

3162
02:19:35,940 --> 02:19:40,100
It's all conjecture on my part, but I've watched this thing so many times.

3163
02:19:40,100 --> 02:19:42,460
I am saying what you're saying makes some sense.

3164
02:19:42,740 --> 02:19:45,140
I'm so obsessed with this ride.

3165
02:19:45,140 --> 02:19:49,340
I watch the ride through video as if it were the Zapruder film.

3166
02:19:49,340 --> 02:19:51,020
I study it obsessively.

3167
02:19:51,020 --> 02:19:52,900
I've done this for years.

3168
02:19:52,900 --> 02:19:57,100
It's one of the reasons I asked you guys to please, please do this episode

3169
02:19:57,100 --> 02:19:58,220
behind a paywall.

3170
02:19:58,220 --> 02:20:02,180
I've made other people watch it because I need other people to get infected

3171
02:20:02,380 --> 02:20:04,820
with the virus that is this ride.

3172
02:20:04,820 --> 02:20:08,060
And I just really try to figure out all the decisions that lead to this

3173
02:20:08,060 --> 02:20:11,700
where almost every choice it makes, it feels like is the worst one.

3174
02:20:13,300 --> 02:20:17,420
It's funny because Jimmy has taped it universal.

3175
02:20:17,820 --> 02:20:18,540
They build this day.

3176
02:20:18,540 --> 02:20:21,100
I think they build a stage looking out on the water at City.

3177
02:20:21,100 --> 02:20:23,900
Well, like they they shoot outside today.

3178
02:20:24,220 --> 02:20:26,980
That's not true. But they I think they did it inside.

3179
02:20:26,980 --> 02:20:28,780
But did they do it? OK.

3180
02:20:28,780 --> 02:20:30,700
I don't think he did an outdoor. I am pretty sure.

3181
02:20:31,860 --> 02:20:35,540
But he he gets I think he gets that the parks are fun.

3182
02:20:35,860 --> 02:20:36,820
Yeah, like he'll shoot.

3183
02:20:36,820 --> 02:20:40,500
I did a bit where it's like him and someone else ride the rock and rollercoaster.

3184
02:20:40,860 --> 02:20:44,060
Him and someone him and a guest ride rides with Kevin Hart.

3185
02:20:44,060 --> 02:20:46,620
I feel like it's like his most viewed video ever.

3186
02:20:47,300 --> 02:20:48,700
Yeah. Yeah.

3187
02:20:48,700 --> 02:20:52,820
So I think he does get that.

3188
02:20:52,820 --> 02:20:57,220
And I think like if they had just I don't know if they just divorced it

3189
02:20:57,220 --> 02:21:00,260
from the Tonight Show a little more.

3190
02:21:00,700 --> 02:21:04,100
Wait, maybe this is a good segue for me to talk about my favorite thing

3191
02:21:04,100 --> 02:21:07,420
that really ties it to the Tonight Show and to the legacy.

3192
02:21:07,420 --> 02:21:08,340
I have one more little clip.

3193
02:21:08,340 --> 02:21:10,860
I mentioned this when we talked about it the first time.

3194
02:21:11,060 --> 02:21:14,420
But this is one of my favorite things about the culture of this ride.

3195
02:21:14,660 --> 02:21:18,580
Is this moment where this universal executive is taking him around

3196
02:21:18,580 --> 02:21:22,380
and showing him the exhibit down in the bottom of the, you know, the lobby.

3197
02:21:22,580 --> 02:21:26,620
And, you know, with the little here's the Conan booth in the Leno booth.

3198
02:21:26,620 --> 02:21:29,900
And then he lights up at a very particular booth.

3199
02:21:30,460 --> 02:21:33,740
I've thought this is my version of this career films this clip.

3200
02:21:35,180 --> 02:21:36,660
Oh, Steve Allen.

3201
02:21:36,660 --> 02:21:39,380
He started the long day. Steve, we have arrived.

3202
02:21:39,780 --> 02:21:41,620
We have a ride.

3203
02:21:42,260 --> 02:21:43,820
Look what you made.

3204
02:21:43,820 --> 02:21:47,660
We have a ride at a amusement park, Universal Studios.

3205
02:21:48,980 --> 02:21:51,300
He would love this.

3206
02:21:54,580 --> 02:21:59,620
And then they just hang on him, looking wistfully at this tribute to Steve.

3207
02:21:59,780 --> 02:22:03,220
It's like he's mourning the death of Steve Allen.

3208
02:22:03,260 --> 02:22:06,500
He's even though this is a beautiful moment that we have at Tonight Show

3209
02:22:06,500 --> 02:22:11,340
Ride, it isn't entirely happy because of, of course, Steve Allen.

3210
02:22:12,020 --> 02:22:13,460
Couldn't be here.

3211
02:22:13,460 --> 02:22:15,620
We have a we have a ride, Steve.

3212
02:22:15,620 --> 02:22:17,660
In years, he died.

3213
02:22:17,660 --> 02:22:22,660
Steve, Steve, I know you died 20 years ago, but Steve, why can you be here?

3214
02:22:23,140 --> 02:22:25,100
He would have been 130.

3215
02:22:25,100 --> 02:22:27,820
They, why can you be 130 beer?

3216
02:22:27,820 --> 02:22:29,980
God, he would he would love this.

3217
02:22:29,980 --> 02:22:34,700
I know. I know that Steve Allen hated hippies and rock music

3218
02:22:34,860 --> 02:22:37,220
and thought they were destroying society.

3219
02:22:37,220 --> 02:22:42,620
I know that Steve Allen made Elvis perform in front of a literal hound dog

3220
02:22:42,620 --> 02:22:45,860
to humiliate him because that's how much he hated rock music.

3221
02:22:46,020 --> 02:22:48,260
But you would love this theme park rides.

3222
02:22:48,860 --> 02:22:52,740
He devoted the last like 15 years of his life to being part of the parents

3223
02:22:52,740 --> 02:22:58,060
television council to get obscene content, take it off of the air.

3224
02:22:58,340 --> 02:23:01,300
Steve, I know you were part of the parents television council.

3225
02:23:01,540 --> 02:23:04,300
And I know that right before you died, you wrote a book called

3226
02:23:04,340 --> 02:23:09,580
vulgarians at the gate about how Tupac is destroying the mental health of young

3227
02:23:09,580 --> 02:23:12,380
people, but still we have a ride, Steve.

3228
02:23:12,380 --> 02:23:13,860
Steve. Oh, my God.

3229
02:23:13,860 --> 02:23:15,460
We are the friends, Steve.

3230
02:23:15,460 --> 02:23:18,220
We have a ride. This isn't about me, Steve.

3231
02:23:18,220 --> 02:23:19,460
It's about us.

3232
02:23:19,460 --> 02:23:21,900
You did this. You did it.

3233
02:23:22,020 --> 02:23:24,860
This ride belongs to you as much as it does to me.

3234
02:23:24,860 --> 02:23:28,180
If you were to go on it, it would be exactly what you had in your head.

3235
02:23:28,580 --> 02:23:31,580
Steve Allen, who famously was always begging,

3236
02:23:31,940 --> 02:23:35,900
begging the Rockefellers to front him money to create attractions

3237
02:23:35,900 --> 02:23:38,940
at the World's Fair, he was.

3238
02:23:38,940 --> 02:23:40,660
He lived this life.

3239
02:23:40,660 --> 02:23:42,340
It was all he wanted.

3240
02:23:42,340 --> 02:23:44,860
He said, got an idea. That's a night rider. Right.

3241
02:23:45,100 --> 02:23:49,180
Can we build a rolling wooden roller coaster at Rye Playland

3242
02:23:49,500 --> 02:23:53,340
that goes through all the best bits from my tonight show?

3243
02:23:53,340 --> 02:23:55,620
And no one would ever let him do it.

3244
02:23:55,620 --> 02:23:58,660
It's a little it's a merry go round and it shows you all the best bits,

3245
02:23:58,700 --> 02:24:00,620
like the one where I read rock lyrics.

3246
02:24:00,620 --> 02:24:04,500
And that's the joke, because the rock lyrics are funny and bad.

3247
02:24:05,500 --> 02:24:06,940
The kids love it.

3248
02:24:06,940 --> 02:24:09,220
We did it, Steve.

3249
02:24:09,700 --> 02:24:12,060
We did it. Your team.

3250
02:24:12,580 --> 02:24:14,100
Jimmy does not know that Mr.

3251
02:24:14,100 --> 02:24:17,340
Steve Allen had a theme park presence before this, though.

3252
02:24:17,660 --> 02:24:18,700
What? What?

3253
02:24:18,700 --> 02:24:22,340
Had his hands at Disney's MGM Studios.

3254
02:24:22,540 --> 02:24:24,340
Wow. Yeah.

3255
02:24:24,340 --> 02:24:27,220
The cement. I don't know if they're still there, but he did have that.

3256
02:24:28,020 --> 02:24:30,660
Steve, they have your hand, Steve.

3257
02:24:31,660 --> 02:24:35,460
I checked Steve Allen theme parks before this, and I just found that

3258
02:24:35,460 --> 02:24:38,660
and then pictures of him and his kids at Disneyland in 1957.

3259
02:24:39,900 --> 02:24:43,460
So I did confirm the second most watched

3260
02:24:44,140 --> 02:24:47,780
video on the tonight shows YouTube page of all time

3261
02:24:48,340 --> 02:24:51,900
is Jimmy Fallon and Kevin Hart ride a roller coaster at Universal Orlando.

3262
02:24:52,820 --> 02:24:54,340
Wow. Six years ago.

3263
02:24:54,340 --> 02:24:56,940
I mean, before this open years before this open.

3264
02:24:57,660 --> 02:25:00,220
So the synergy was happening then.

3265
02:25:00,380 --> 02:25:03,580
One hundred and eleven million people watched that.

3266
02:25:03,580 --> 02:25:06,900
And then Jimmy said, I think I have a good pitch for a ride.

3267
02:25:07,140 --> 02:25:11,380
It's me cucking a bunch of people because their vehicle isn't as good as mine,

3268
02:25:12,380 --> 02:25:16,260
because it doesn't have underwater or space capabilities.

3269
02:25:16,460 --> 02:25:18,100
Or I don't want to miss this one.

3270
02:25:18,100 --> 02:25:20,460
It doesn't have hyper tube.

3271
02:25:20,460 --> 02:25:24,180
It can't you can't activate hyper tube from me, which,

3272
02:25:24,180 --> 02:25:28,100
if you haven't been on the ride, is how, you know, you can just fly up to space.

3273
02:25:28,100 --> 02:25:28,860
And that is safe.

3274
02:25:28,860 --> 02:25:31,060
And Jimmy can just float through space without a helmet.

3275
02:25:31,060 --> 02:25:32,020
And that is safe.

3276
02:25:32,020 --> 02:25:34,980
But the one thing that you can't do is fall from the moon

3277
02:25:35,100 --> 02:25:37,580
off of a not completed theme park attraction.

3278
02:25:37,700 --> 02:25:40,460
You need a roller coaster to get back from the room, not from the moon,

3279
02:25:40,460 --> 02:25:41,700
not to the moon.

3280
02:25:41,700 --> 02:25:45,300
And then so if you're just falling, you're going to eat shit and die.

3281
02:25:45,300 --> 02:25:46,940
You need a hyper tube.

3282
02:25:46,940 --> 02:25:51,100
So that's why that's nightwriter can spit plastic out that forms a tube

3283
02:25:51,220 --> 02:25:54,140
that hardens as soon as you land on its front grill.

3284
02:25:54,140 --> 02:25:58,340
It produces a tube, which it can then ride through to safety.

3285
02:25:58,540 --> 02:26:03,020
But for miles and miles into space, this is like the longest

3286
02:26:03,820 --> 02:26:04,980
you just ran through.

3287
02:26:04,980 --> 02:26:10,020
I mean, breezed through so many humongous sci fi concepts that we must discuss.

3288
02:26:10,540 --> 02:26:12,900
One man, they could all be their own film.

3289
02:26:12,900 --> 02:26:14,460
Everything I just said, absolutely.

3290
02:26:14,460 --> 02:26:16,580
The tonight rider has no covering.

3291
02:26:16,580 --> 02:26:20,180
It is it is by all intents and purposes, an open air vehicle.

3292
02:26:20,180 --> 02:26:20,620
Right.

3293
02:26:20,620 --> 02:26:21,980
Convertible.

3294
02:26:21,980 --> 02:26:23,060
It's a go car.

3295
02:26:23,060 --> 02:26:24,340
It's supposed to be like a go car.

3296
02:26:24,340 --> 02:26:26,220
Yeah, it's a hover go car.

3297
02:26:26,220 --> 02:26:28,020
It looks like a Mario Kart ride.

3298
02:26:28,020 --> 02:26:28,460
It does.

3299
02:26:28,460 --> 02:26:32,500
It looks like a little card from Mario Kart, but he goes both underwater

3300
02:26:32,500 --> 02:26:34,100
and into space.

3301
02:26:35,260 --> 02:26:40,540
I think neither atmosphere does any sort of helmet presents itself.

3302
02:26:40,540 --> 02:26:40,780
Right.

3303
02:26:40,780 --> 02:26:42,020
There's never any covering.

3304
02:26:42,020 --> 02:26:43,540
It never turns into a bubble.

3305
02:26:43,740 --> 02:26:46,740
He's just safe and let's water.

3306
02:26:47,620 --> 02:26:52,180
The reason he goes into water, he's he's flying through the skies of New York City.

3307
02:26:52,500 --> 02:26:58,180
He's getting close to that old lady herself, the statue of liberty.

3308
02:26:58,820 --> 02:27:05,580
And then we tilt down to see that there is a checkpoint in the water

3309
02:27:05,780 --> 02:27:10,020
because this race seemingly happens enough that there are checkpoints

3310
02:27:10,020 --> 02:27:12,060
littered across New York City.

3311
02:27:12,060 --> 02:27:15,340
You know, there's a starting line in the hallways of 30 Rock,

3312
02:27:15,500 --> 02:27:19,340
but then there's another checkpoint somewhere on the streets, which he flies past.

3313
02:27:19,540 --> 02:27:24,980
And then this one is like a video game, like it's like electric, lit up

3314
02:27:25,180 --> 02:27:31,820
the word checkpoint three in a circle that he like dives through like a tunnel.

3315
02:27:32,220 --> 02:27:34,100
And there hasn't been that yet.

3316
02:27:34,100 --> 02:27:35,380
This is the first time it's happened.

3317
02:27:35,380 --> 02:27:37,580
It's very reminiscent of Echo the dolphin.

3318
02:27:37,580 --> 02:27:38,580
Absolutely.

3319
02:27:38,580 --> 02:27:43,220
Because I've been through every other checkpoint has been a banner

3320
02:27:43,540 --> 02:27:45,260
and now it's like a ring.

3321
02:27:45,260 --> 02:27:48,060
But the type of ring that only exists as a video game

3322
02:27:48,740 --> 02:27:53,780
can seat to help you win some sort of race that goes into multiple environments,

3323
02:27:54,020 --> 02:28:00,300
but does not actually represent a physical, tangible thing in that character's world.

3324
02:28:00,460 --> 02:28:03,300
It's like just a guideline for you, the player.

3325
02:28:03,580 --> 02:28:07,580
So he dives through that underwater, through the wreckage of various ships.

3326
02:28:07,740 --> 02:28:11,180
And of course, those famous New York City sharks

3327
02:28:11,460 --> 02:28:13,740
would come jumping at you.

3328
02:28:13,780 --> 02:28:16,380
That's why the Sully landing was so scary.

3329
02:28:16,380 --> 02:28:18,940
You know, those sharks were circling.

3330
02:28:18,940 --> 02:28:22,340
Fins to the left, fins to the right.

3331
02:28:22,340 --> 02:28:23,740
Amen, brother.

3332
02:28:23,740 --> 02:28:28,660
Jimmy Jimmy Buffett also was on the Jimmy Fallon at Universal

3333
02:28:29,300 --> 02:28:31,460
during that week.

3334
02:28:31,460 --> 02:28:32,500
Yeah. Wow.

3335
02:28:32,500 --> 02:28:34,900
Isn't it the shirt you bought, Jason, that he was wearing?

3336
02:28:35,980 --> 02:28:39,740
Oh, yes. I bought once very late at night.

3337
02:28:39,780 --> 02:28:45,540
I bought a Margaritaville shirt from the Margaritaville web store.

3338
02:28:46,300 --> 02:28:49,180
Full price, $40 shipping.

3339
02:28:50,100 --> 02:28:51,180
But that's the one he was wearing.

3340
02:28:51,180 --> 02:28:53,100
Jimmy was wearing. I was so excited.

3341
02:28:53,100 --> 02:28:57,180
And I was like, oh, it's the Lakers color shirt he was wearing on the Tonight Show.

3342
02:28:58,540 --> 02:29:00,700
Great shirt. Iconic.

3343
02:29:00,700 --> 02:29:04,260
Well, so, you know, the way you admire like a particular share outfit

3344
02:29:04,260 --> 02:29:08,900
or a Liberace outfit, each each Jimmy Buffett outfit is a unique flower.

3345
02:29:09,060 --> 02:29:11,420
Well, Bob Mackie designed that one, right?

3346
02:29:11,420 --> 02:29:14,860
His outfit for the Tonight Show in Orlando.

3347
02:29:14,860 --> 02:29:16,220
That was a Bob Mackie.

3348
02:29:16,220 --> 02:29:19,580
I believe so. Yeah. He hand laid each litter. Yes.

3349
02:29:19,860 --> 02:29:21,300
I'm just scrubbing through this again.

3350
02:29:21,300 --> 02:29:24,700
It's like he he when he goes underwater,

3351
02:29:24,940 --> 02:29:27,300
you're very close to the Statue of Liberty.

3352
02:29:27,900 --> 02:29:32,460
Then he goes underwater for a while, does a few rounds, it feels like.

3353
02:29:32,620 --> 02:29:37,540
Avoid several sharks and then pops up and no real distance has been traversed.

3354
02:29:37,540 --> 02:29:40,380
He is now just slightly closer to the Statue of Liberty,

3355
02:29:40,900 --> 02:29:43,620
even though it seems like he's been driving around in circles

3356
02:29:43,620 --> 02:29:45,900
and going like nautical miles and shit.

3357
02:29:46,340 --> 02:29:49,780
And then I was just going to say it does feel like a knockoff,

3358
02:29:49,780 --> 02:29:53,620
like when you play Mario Kart, but then you play like Sonic Racing All Stars

3359
02:29:53,620 --> 02:29:55,620
and you're like, this isn't the same.

3360
02:29:55,620 --> 02:29:57,460
This doesn't even too much of a compliment.

3361
02:29:57,460 --> 02:30:00,020
It feels like like Garfield racer.

3362
02:30:00,060 --> 02:30:02,620
Yes. Thank you. That's much better.

3363
02:30:02,620 --> 02:30:04,060
Yes. It feels like I don't know.

3364
02:30:04,060 --> 02:30:07,500
Garfield doesn't really belong in a racing game, but it was a cheap license.

3365
02:30:07,980 --> 02:30:10,620
Right. We knew what the track was.

3366
02:30:10,900 --> 02:30:14,100
Then when he gets out of the water, he's closer to the Statue of Liberty.

3367
02:30:14,100 --> 02:30:18,860
He flies up her side and you see that the Statue of Liberty is now wearing a sash

3368
02:30:19,060 --> 02:30:21,900
because she is now the fourth checkpoint.

3369
02:30:23,500 --> 02:30:25,380
And he dings her torch.

3370
02:30:25,380 --> 02:30:26,260
He hits it.

3371
02:30:26,260 --> 02:30:29,980
And that is that is the indication of the checkpoint has to keep her humble.

3372
02:30:32,500 --> 02:30:36,940
It does feel like he like Jimmy Fallon in a video game is a cleaner premise.

3373
02:30:37,180 --> 02:30:41,460
Like, like all of a sudden we're in the Jimmy Fallon six.

3374
02:30:41,460 --> 02:30:43,660
Jimmy Fallon 64.

3375
02:30:43,660 --> 02:30:46,860
Yeah, right. The pre show is hey, look, great news.

3376
02:30:46,860 --> 02:30:48,780
You just got hired to be a writer at the Sniteshaw.

3377
02:30:48,780 --> 02:30:51,820
Now, unfortunately, we have to warn you before every taping.

3378
02:30:51,940 --> 02:30:55,460
Jimmy challenges his writers to a Mario Kart game and you have to lose.

3379
02:30:55,580 --> 02:30:57,620
OK, are you ready? Buckle in.

3380
02:30:57,620 --> 02:31:01,940
Like that would be a better, cleaner walk for this ride.

3381
02:31:03,500 --> 02:31:05,460
Yeah, but no, but then he goes from Statue of Liberty.

3382
02:31:05,500 --> 02:31:07,180
I forgot this. He goes from Statue.

3383
02:31:07,180 --> 02:31:09,460
I'm just rewatching this video over and over again.

3384
02:31:09,740 --> 02:31:14,740
He goes from Statue of Liberty to Empire State Building,

3385
02:31:14,740 --> 02:31:18,580
which feels kind of backwards because we've worked so hard to get out of New

3386
02:31:18,580 --> 02:31:23,340
York City, right, to get underwater, to get into into the skies.

3387
02:31:23,580 --> 02:31:27,580
But then he circles back around into Manhattan, Midtown Manhattan again,

3388
02:31:27,860 --> 02:31:31,300
goes up the side of the Empire State Building, where now

3389
02:31:31,540 --> 02:31:36,420
hashtag the panda is 60 feet tall, which he calls out that there's no explanation.

3390
02:31:36,900 --> 02:31:39,820
Finally, a meta type joke, but there's nothing else like that in the ride.

3391
02:31:39,900 --> 02:31:46,620
Right. And then you crash land in the Bowery ballroom and hop on stage with Prince.

3392
02:31:50,820 --> 02:31:54,900
The next move is Hyperdrive Up to the Moon,

3393
02:31:55,100 --> 02:32:00,700
which has Race Through New York starring Jimmy Fatten, etched onto its side

3394
02:32:00,860 --> 02:32:07,460
permanently, which I should like because it's kind of a spiritual heir to that.

3395
02:32:07,460 --> 02:32:12,580
In the Back to the Future ride, you crash into TVs that say back to the future,

3396
02:32:12,740 --> 02:32:16,180
despite that logo having no meaning to Doc Brown.

3397
02:32:16,220 --> 02:32:18,900
Yes. No, that is good. I like that.

3398
02:32:19,300 --> 02:32:20,540
But I do like that.

3399
02:32:20,540 --> 02:32:22,460
Do I only like that because it's what I grew up with?

3400
02:32:22,460 --> 02:32:25,260
Would I like this moon thing if I grew up with it?

3401
02:32:25,740 --> 02:32:29,540
But for how much the narrative crux of this ride ends up being, oh, no,

3402
02:32:30,100 --> 02:32:32,860
we are going to die trying to get back to Earth.

3403
02:32:33,460 --> 02:32:39,140
The journey from Empire State Building to the moon is maybe one second.

3404
02:32:39,660 --> 02:32:42,940
With no sort of talk about how we got there.

3405
02:32:43,300 --> 02:32:46,380
Then you're just on the moon. The roots are playing on the moon.

3406
02:32:46,700 --> 02:32:48,820
In helmets. They need helmets, right?

3407
02:32:48,820 --> 02:32:49,980
Aren't they? Yeah. Yeah.

3408
02:32:49,980 --> 02:32:54,180
Jimmy is wearing full spacesuits, suits, full helmets.

3409
02:32:54,380 --> 02:32:57,940
Jimmy, of course, takes the moment to write a thank you note.

3410
02:32:58,420 --> 02:33:00,660
Our favorite funniest thing.

3411
02:33:01,180 --> 02:33:04,260
It makes me which now this another bizarre thing.

3412
02:33:04,260 --> 02:33:08,420
And I don't think the joke that he I don't think this thank you note joke is bad,

3413
02:33:08,620 --> 02:33:12,740
but it is thank you notes is their version of a refillable joke bag thing.

3414
02:33:12,740 --> 02:33:16,020
We do it every week and we will do this for decades and decades.

3415
02:33:16,260 --> 02:33:18,740
And, you know, the way these bits are done on shows,

3416
02:33:18,940 --> 02:33:21,700
you take 150 of them and you get them down to 10.

3417
02:33:21,860 --> 02:33:25,460
Here they have committed to one that will play forever.

3418
02:33:26,140 --> 02:33:28,340
So if you laugh at it the first time,

3419
02:33:28,340 --> 02:33:32,700
you will certainly not laugh at it the second time, much less third, fourth, sixth.

3420
02:33:33,020 --> 02:33:37,900
And the and the joke is, excuse me, as I as I paraphrase here, something like.

3421
02:33:38,980 --> 02:33:43,580
Thank you, Moon Dust, for making dirt feel special.

3422
02:33:44,300 --> 02:33:48,660
It's for turning regular dirt into moon dust.

3423
02:33:49,020 --> 02:33:51,300
Thank you, Moon. Thank you, the moon.

3424
02:33:51,340 --> 02:33:53,300
Jesus Christ. Again, I don't mind it.

3425
02:33:53,300 --> 02:33:55,980
I don't mind the like odd way of saying the moon.

3426
02:33:55,980 --> 02:33:57,500
I think he delivers those jokes well.

3427
02:33:57,500 --> 02:34:00,860
I like the way he kind of like does that big pause before he starts writing the joke.

3428
02:34:01,300 --> 02:34:03,020
Yeah, I kind of like that.

3429
02:34:03,020 --> 02:34:05,540
That weird repetitive rhythm.

3430
02:34:05,540 --> 02:34:08,940
Thank you, the moon for turning regular dirt into moon dust.

3431
02:34:08,940 --> 02:34:10,860
And then he blows and blows.

3432
02:34:10,860 --> 02:34:16,100
He met this is one of the stranger tableaus in it to me is Jimmy Fallon blow

3433
02:34:16,100 --> 02:34:19,980
blowing dust at you and then kind of like sweetly staring at you,

3434
02:34:19,980 --> 02:34:24,580
kind of like seducing you with his eyes as he floats through space in a full suit,

3435
02:34:25,180 --> 02:34:27,420
full suit and tie without a helmet.

3436
02:34:27,420 --> 02:34:30,660
One of the stranger images, I think, in theme park history.

3437
02:34:31,140 --> 02:34:33,860
So now, right, which also raises the question,

3438
02:34:33,860 --> 02:34:36,860
how is he staying in the Tonight Rider at all?

3439
02:34:36,860 --> 02:34:41,340
Like, it feels like gravity or the lack thereof is trying to pull him

3440
02:34:41,340 --> 02:34:45,140
floating into space, but he seemingly gets to choose on and off

3441
02:34:45,140 --> 02:34:47,500
when he's sitting normally behind the wheel of a car.

3442
02:34:47,660 --> 02:34:51,020
It's kind of godlike, basically.

3443
02:34:51,060 --> 02:34:53,300
I mean, Jimmy is kind of godlike.

3444
02:34:53,300 --> 02:34:54,940
We have to acknowledge it.

3445
02:34:54,940 --> 02:34:58,060
It's like when you're playing like superheroes as a kid and it's like,

3446
02:34:58,060 --> 02:34:59,340
what's your power, Johnny?

3447
02:34:59,340 --> 02:35:01,380
It's like I'm all powers.

3448
02:35:02,620 --> 02:35:05,060
I can I can I can do all powers.

3449
02:35:05,420 --> 02:35:10,940
The way Leno was dethronable, I think maybe he maybe maybe Leno had god powers

3450
02:35:11,220 --> 02:35:15,860
and he passed them on to he did not pass them on to Conan and he did pass them on to Fallon.

3451
02:35:15,980 --> 02:35:19,020
The immortality that he'll never go away.

3452
02:35:19,020 --> 02:35:21,060
You can't get him out of the throne.

3453
02:35:21,060 --> 02:35:24,620
The fictional character of Jimmy Fallon in the ride

3454
02:35:24,980 --> 02:35:29,540
race through New York, starring Jimmy Fallon, does have big infinity plus one

3455
02:35:29,540 --> 02:35:33,940
energy, as as you're saying, Jason, that everything is like, no, you're infinity.

3456
02:35:33,940 --> 02:35:34,940
I'm infinity plus one.

3457
02:35:34,940 --> 02:35:37,300
I can do it even a little bit better than you.

3458
02:35:37,300 --> 02:35:42,340
And I can choose to change the rules of my reality at any moment to my whims.

3459
02:35:43,500 --> 02:35:44,980
He is no rules.

3460
02:35:44,980 --> 02:35:45,780
There's no rules.

3461
02:35:45,780 --> 02:35:46,980
Jimmy's got in this.

3462
02:35:46,980 --> 02:35:49,420
Jimmy's got. Oh, cool.

3463
02:35:49,420 --> 02:35:50,740
Oh, I'm God.

3464
02:35:50,740 --> 02:35:52,660
I did it. I'm God.

3465
02:35:52,660 --> 02:35:53,700
Oh, my God. I'm God.

3466
02:35:53,700 --> 02:35:55,260
Oh, God. I'm God.

3467
02:35:55,260 --> 02:35:57,820
Thank you, Megagod, for making me God.

3468
02:35:59,460 --> 02:36:03,180
If Jimmy does a funny cover of your song, that's like you've made it.

3469
02:36:03,180 --> 02:36:07,100
That's like, you know, Johnny waving you over, waving you over to the couch.

3470
02:36:07,100 --> 02:36:09,140
The dream, you know, the dream.

3471
02:36:09,140 --> 02:36:11,780
Can I maybe are we done?

3472
02:36:12,180 --> 02:36:15,580
We can go back to anything, but I want to bring up an idea real quick here

3473
02:36:15,900 --> 02:36:19,260
that maybe the four of us are dead wrong.

3474
02:36:19,780 --> 02:36:21,580
Oh, OK. Oh, yes.

3475
02:36:21,660 --> 02:36:23,060
I'm interested. Yes.

3476
02:36:23,060 --> 02:36:27,460
So I was looking at friend of the show, Lentestas Company Touring Plans.

3477
02:36:28,300 --> 02:36:29,980
And I think we should do this for more rides.

3478
02:36:29,980 --> 02:36:33,140
Touring Plans does audience reaction.

3479
02:36:33,140 --> 02:36:39,820
They get ratings from audience to see if people like rides and shows.

3480
02:36:40,380 --> 02:36:42,580
And I was just doing a couple.

3481
02:36:42,580 --> 02:36:47,020
I just looked at a couple and Fast and the Furious does have lower

3482
02:36:47,020 --> 02:36:49,580
ratings than this Jimmy Fallon ride.

3483
02:36:49,580 --> 02:36:55,020
I will say Jimmy Fallon is neck and neck with the E.T.

3484
02:36:55,020 --> 02:36:57,820
ride. What audience satisfaction.

3485
02:36:59,620 --> 02:37:06,060
In fact, Jimmy Fallon is a half star above when it comes to teens.

3486
02:37:06,580 --> 02:37:09,220
Well, allow me to say I will say this.

3487
02:37:09,220 --> 02:37:13,860
Teens are more likely to know who Jimmy Fallon is than they are.

3488
02:37:13,860 --> 02:37:16,900
E.T. There just isn't a new E.T. thing.

3489
02:37:16,900 --> 02:37:20,260
So if it's just awareness, that makes sense to me.

3490
02:37:20,260 --> 02:37:23,860
They love E.T. from the commercial, but they don't know maybe where other

3491
02:37:23,860 --> 02:37:25,620
places you can find E.T. would be.

3492
02:37:25,620 --> 02:37:27,060
Obviously, love the commercial.

3493
02:37:27,060 --> 02:37:29,300
So let's let's connect to other dots here.

3494
02:37:30,260 --> 02:37:34,700
Jimmy Fallon and we were sort of talking around this, his success, the

3495
02:37:34,860 --> 02:37:40,140
popularity of his show represents a sort of larger cultural tide turn in

3496
02:37:40,140 --> 02:37:47,300
comedy towards everything's fun, positive vibes, sort of prom king humor,

3497
02:37:47,300 --> 02:37:51,900
but also that's so much of Fallon is about like, you know, this thing.

3498
02:37:53,100 --> 02:37:57,340
We're referencing things, you know, that so many of his bits are like

3499
02:37:57,340 --> 02:38:01,500
reunions or restagings of things, or it's what if this person saying that

3500
02:38:02,100 --> 02:38:06,500
other song, you know, like, it's a lot of that comedy by association stuff

3501
02:38:06,500 --> 02:38:12,100
where you have to imagine if you are a big Jimmy Fallon fan, I guess you

3502
02:38:12,100 --> 02:38:14,100
would find this ride funny.

3503
02:38:15,100 --> 02:38:18,500
Maybe, but I think I think the definition of funny is I think you'd

3504
02:38:18,500 --> 02:38:19,500
find it fun.

3505
02:38:19,500 --> 02:38:23,300
I I've this is a too big of a theory to get into, but I think people have

3506
02:38:23,300 --> 02:38:26,100
changed. I think people now describe things as funny that don't make them

3507
02:38:26,100 --> 02:38:29,100
laugh. I think if you think it was fun, that was fun.

3508
02:38:29,100 --> 02:38:32,500
I think the definition of funny is maybe if it makes you smile, that means

3509
02:38:32,500 --> 02:38:37,700
funny. But that's kind of my point is like, is it testing better with young

3510
02:38:37,700 --> 02:38:41,500
people than ET because they like they're on a ride that they kind of

3511
02:38:41,500 --> 02:38:44,500
know like they feel special because they get it.

3512
02:38:45,500 --> 02:38:47,100
Do they know Jimmy Fallon?

3513
02:38:47,100 --> 02:38:51,700
Do they think about the Tonight Show as an entity or do they know him just

3514
02:38:51,700 --> 02:38:53,500
from clips going viral on YouTube?

3515
02:38:53,500 --> 02:38:57,100
I think they know him from clips and I think the exact things that this

3516
02:38:57,100 --> 02:39:01,100
ride is referencing are the things that don't get turned into clips on YouTube.

3517
02:39:01,100 --> 02:39:02,100
Yeah.

3518
02:39:02,100 --> 02:39:03,100
Hmm.

3519
02:39:03,100 --> 02:39:06,100
Hmm. Does any I was going to ask this.

3520
02:39:06,100 --> 02:39:10,100
What's the percentage of the audience, particularly the teen audience who

3521
02:39:10,100 --> 02:39:14,100
could do who goes into that ride every day who could tell you who Higgins is?

3522
02:39:14,100 --> 02:39:15,100
Great question.

3523
02:39:15,100 --> 02:39:20,100
Does Higgins register in any way to people from other countries to teen?

3524
02:39:20,100 --> 02:39:24,100
Is there because he there's a huge poster of them.

3525
02:39:24,100 --> 02:39:26,100
We're going a lot of real estate to Higgins.

3526
02:39:26,100 --> 02:39:30,100
Just one percent of the audience in this ride know Higgins.

3527
02:39:30,100 --> 02:39:35,100
Maybe we can team up with Len and the Touring Plants team to poll people about

3528
02:39:35,100 --> 02:39:39,100
specific things like do you know who Higgins is?

3529
02:39:39,100 --> 02:39:41,100
Do you know who hashtag the panda is?

3530
02:39:41,100 --> 02:39:43,100
Do you know who hashtag the panda is?

3531
02:39:43,100 --> 02:39:48,100
And we can do very hyper specific podcasts, the ride specific polling that

3532
02:39:48,100 --> 02:39:50,100
will help for our purposes.

3533
02:39:50,100 --> 02:39:51,100
Yeah.

3534
02:39:52,100 --> 02:39:53,100
Like, do you do?

3535
02:39:53,100 --> 02:39:56,100
Do you do you like Jack Parr better or do you like Steve Allen better?

3536
02:39:56,100 --> 02:40:02,100
You know, this is what maybe if we just tack on they're already surveying people

3537
02:40:02,100 --> 02:40:04,100
as they come off rides.

3538
02:40:04,100 --> 02:40:06,100
Now we can we can.

3539
02:40:06,100 --> 02:40:08,100
So we're going to engage in our very first survey.

3540
02:40:08,100 --> 02:40:11,100
This is an interesting new development of the show.

3541
02:40:11,100 --> 02:40:14,100
I think I think I don't want to speak for Len already.

3542
02:40:14,100 --> 02:40:17,100
I mean, but I think maybe he would be interested in us getting some hyper

3543
02:40:17,100 --> 02:40:19,100
specific questions on these.

3544
02:40:19,100 --> 02:40:21,100
I do specific.

3545
02:40:21,100 --> 02:40:28,100
Yeah, I will admit like we probably have pretty we're not necessarily the target

3546
02:40:28,100 --> 02:40:30,100
audience for this.

3547
02:40:30,100 --> 02:40:36,100
I think if you work in comedy for a little while, you start to you start to get a

3548
02:40:36,100 --> 02:40:38,100
little weird in your taste.

3549
02:40:38,100 --> 02:40:39,100
Yeah.

3550
02:40:39,100 --> 02:40:42,100
The funniest thing to me recently has just been repeating Jack Parr and Steve

3551
02:40:42,100 --> 02:40:45,100
Allen's names a countless number of times.

3552
02:40:45,100 --> 02:40:51,100
Yeah, so I get I get that I would not necessarily be the target audience.

3553
02:40:51,100 --> 02:40:57,100
But in terms of the rule, the rules of theme park, I think this this violates a

3554
02:40:57,100 --> 02:40:59,100
lot of the rules.

3555
02:40:59,100 --> 02:41:01,100
Yes, like successful park endeavors.

3556
02:41:01,100 --> 02:41:06,100
I will say seniors gave this ride four stars and gave ET four stars.

3557
02:41:06,100 --> 02:41:08,100
Jesus Christ.

3558
02:41:08,100 --> 02:41:09,100
They're both very clean.

3559
02:41:09,100 --> 02:41:12,100
You mean older people, not high school seniors, right?

3560
02:41:12,100 --> 02:41:13,100
Not high school seniors.

3561
02:41:13,100 --> 02:41:14,100
Right.

3562
02:41:14,100 --> 02:41:15,100
Not high school seniors.

3563
02:41:15,100 --> 02:41:16,100
OK.

3564
02:41:16,100 --> 02:41:17,100
How did freshmen rate it?

3565
02:41:17,100 --> 02:41:20,100
They said it sucks.

3566
02:41:20,100 --> 02:41:21,100
The big one.

3567
02:41:21,100 --> 02:41:23,100
What do they know?

3568
02:41:23,100 --> 02:41:25,100
Because seniors rock and freshmen drool.

3569
02:41:25,100 --> 02:41:26,100
Yeah.

3570
02:41:26,100 --> 02:41:27,100
Seniors.

3571
02:41:27,100 --> 02:41:29,100
But seniors gave Fast and Furious two and a half stars.

3572
02:41:29,100 --> 02:41:31,100
A little body.

3573
02:41:31,100 --> 02:41:35,100
So seniors are not just giving out four stars left and right.

3574
02:41:35,100 --> 02:41:37,100
I don't get this.

3575
02:41:37,100 --> 02:41:44,100
I mean, I do agree with what Jason's saying that like perhaps no one is is less in the

3576
02:41:44,100 --> 02:41:51,100
wheelhouse for this ride than a comedy fan, because this ride is very much like comedy

3577
02:41:51,100 --> 02:41:52,100
adjacent.

3578
02:41:52,100 --> 02:41:57,100
It's very much as you said, Scott, like, oh, you think it's funny because it made you smile

3579
02:41:57,100 --> 02:41:58,100
a little bit.

3580
02:41:58,100 --> 02:42:04,100
But I even feel like most people who I guess, you know, love Fallon, watch Fallon clips on

3581
02:42:04,100 --> 02:42:10,100
YouTube all the time, I would question how often they're actually laughing at them or

3582
02:42:10,100 --> 02:42:13,100
if they're just sort of thinking like, this is charming.

3583
02:42:13,100 --> 02:42:21,100
I like seeing this person do this thing because in so many ways what his show has succeeded

3584
02:42:21,100 --> 02:42:27,100
at is closer to something like the match game, you know, or Hollywood Squares.

3585
02:42:27,100 --> 02:42:32,100
The kinds of things I think the success of the games on his show has helped lead to that

3586
02:42:32,100 --> 02:42:34,100
there's all these primetime game shows.

3587
02:42:34,100 --> 02:42:35,100
Absolutely right.

3588
02:42:35,100 --> 02:42:41,100
He's he's in a lot of ways more of a game show host than he is a talk show host.

3589
02:42:41,100 --> 02:42:43,100
I do think it's interesting.

3590
02:42:43,100 --> 02:42:49,100
I've seen a little bit of his quarantine stuff, which I know he's had this like big boost

3591
02:42:49,100 --> 02:42:55,100
in popularity again because of filming at home and having his wife and his kids involved.

3592
02:42:55,100 --> 02:42:57,100
Everyone thinks his kids are so cute and whatever.

3593
02:42:57,100 --> 02:42:59,100
But we're in the ride too.

3594
02:42:59,100 --> 02:43:00,100
There's a little cameo.

3595
02:43:00,100 --> 02:43:04,100
And I'm going to send a little photo to the chat for you guys just so you can see.

3596
02:43:04,100 --> 02:43:06,100
Give me a second here as I prep this.

3597
02:43:06,100 --> 02:43:07,100
Sure.

3598
02:43:07,100 --> 02:43:12,100
But I watched a little bit of it because I've been curious to see like how different people

3599
02:43:12,100 --> 02:43:17,100
are handling this different entertainers adjusting to quarantine and stuff.

3600
02:43:17,100 --> 02:43:25,100
And I found him a lot more engaging and charming now than I have in years because it feels like

3601
02:43:25,100 --> 02:43:29,100
now that he doesn't have as many gimmicks he can rely on, he can't play games with people.

3602
02:43:29,100 --> 02:43:33,100
He actually has to like sit down and have an extended conversation with someone over

3603
02:43:33,100 --> 02:43:36,100
Zoom because there's nothing else to do.

3604
02:43:36,100 --> 02:43:41,100
I'm starting to feel like I'm actually seeing him as a real person for the first time in a while.

3605
02:43:41,100 --> 02:43:44,100
Like he's got a very different energy in those interviews.

3606
02:43:44,100 --> 02:43:49,100
And even just the fact that he's like not shaving and he's not wearing a suit, he doesn't seem

3607
02:43:49,100 --> 02:43:50,100
like overly excitable.

3608
02:43:50,100 --> 02:43:56,100
Like he's like actually asking questions and listening to their answers and things like that.

3609
02:43:56,100 --> 02:44:00,100
I think he's adjusted better to quarantine world than a lot of talk shows.

3610
02:44:00,100 --> 02:44:07,100
I would almost argue that someone like Colbert, who is a lot better at sort of like the

3611
02:44:07,100 --> 02:44:13,100
performing and the comedy of everything, has had a slightly trickier time adjusting to the lack of

3612
02:44:13,100 --> 02:44:18,100
a studio audience because he's maybe trying to do a lot of the same energy just without a crowd.

3613
02:44:18,100 --> 02:44:22,100
Whereas Falonet feels like has totally reset here.

3614
02:44:22,100 --> 02:44:23,100
It's a new show.

3615
02:44:23,100 --> 02:44:24,100
Yeah.

3616
02:44:24,100 --> 02:44:27,100
I just sent you guys how Deadline looks right now.

3617
02:44:27,100 --> 02:44:32,100
The entirety of Deadline's home page is bought out by For Your Consideration, Jimmy Fallon ads,

3618
02:44:32,100 --> 02:44:35,100
which are now just for fronting his daughters.

3619
02:44:35,100 --> 02:44:41,100
So it says vote for Jimmy Fallon and Jimmy Fallon is crossed out with a red crayon and it says Winnie

3620
02:44:41,100 --> 02:44:42,100
plus Franny.

3621
02:44:42,100 --> 02:44:45,100
And then the Tonight Show logo is written in crayon.

3622
02:44:45,100 --> 02:44:50,100
It's like they're trying to sell his daughters as the star of the show over him now, which just

3623
02:44:50,100 --> 02:44:57,100
speaks to the idea that it's crazy to invest tens of millions of dollars into a ride based around

3624
02:44:57,100 --> 02:45:02,100
a show where public perception can change it that radically at any moment.

3625
02:45:02,100 --> 02:45:05,100
This list is a ride literally of a different show.

3626
02:45:05,100 --> 02:45:08,100
It is forcibly due to the coronavirus.

3627
02:45:08,100 --> 02:45:14,100
It is a he is not doing the show and already hadn't been doing Gary and you for a long time.

3628
02:45:14,100 --> 02:45:15,100
It's a weird.

3629
02:45:15,100 --> 02:45:18,100
This is now like a time travel ride to 2017.

3630
02:45:18,100 --> 02:45:21,100
This ride was like created pre Trump.

3631
02:45:21,100 --> 02:45:22,100
It was made while A.D.

3632
02:45:22,100 --> 02:45:26,100
Miles was still the main creative voice in the show behind the scenes.

3633
02:45:26,100 --> 02:45:29,100
You know, like everything about it has shifted.

3634
02:45:29,100 --> 02:45:30,100
Mm hmm.

3635
02:45:30,100 --> 02:45:32,100
Which makes it a little interesting, I guess.

3636
02:45:32,100 --> 02:45:36,100
It's thinking of it as a period piece somehow in three years.

3637
02:45:36,100 --> 02:45:40,100
This ride has become a very antiquated throwback.

3638
02:45:40,100 --> 02:45:41,100
Yeah.

3639
02:45:41,100 --> 02:45:42,100
Yeah.

3640
02:45:42,100 --> 02:45:45,100
An archive. I think I mean, that picture you sent is charming and I do.

3641
02:45:45,100 --> 02:45:47,100
I am in favor of like.

3642
02:45:47,100 --> 02:45:52,100
I understand that people want like positive positive stuff, light stuff like.

3643
02:45:52,100 --> 02:45:54,100
Yeah, I totally understand.

3644
02:45:54,100 --> 02:45:56,100
We television has always had that.

3645
02:45:56,100 --> 02:45:57,100
I am in favor of it.

3646
02:45:57,100 --> 02:45:59,100
I like a little of that, too.

3647
02:45:59,100 --> 02:46:05,100
I do think the reunions, the remember this like that, I think, is very realistic.

3648
02:46:05,100 --> 02:46:12,100
And I think it's maybe in a larger view, it's like, oh, this kind of seems like the death of culture.

3649
02:46:12,100 --> 02:46:15,100
Like we've given up on creating new entities and we're just.

3650
02:46:15,100 --> 02:46:20,100
Oh, you know, we're just swimming in the backwater of when we had money to make good movies

3651
02:46:20,100 --> 02:46:23,100
and allowed people the creative liberties to make good movies.

3652
02:46:23,100 --> 02:46:24,100
But also one of those things.

3653
02:46:24,100 --> 02:46:30,100
But it's like the 70s again, where they're like, remember the good times of happy days in the 50s?

3654
02:46:30,100 --> 02:46:32,100
It's like that wasn't what the 50s was like.

3655
02:46:32,100 --> 02:46:36,100
But it's also Jimmy doing these reunions and these tributes to things where you're like,

3656
02:46:36,100 --> 02:46:39,100
I don't think that actually times out properly.

3657
02:46:40,100 --> 02:46:45,100
Like you're you're doing reunions for your target audience and the things that they grew up with.

3658
02:46:45,100 --> 02:46:52,100
And Jimmy is pretending that he loved things that came 15 years after he was the right age to enjoy them.

3659
02:46:52,100 --> 02:46:53,100
Right.

3660
02:46:53,100 --> 02:46:55,100
Oh, like 90s full house sort of.

3661
02:46:55,100 --> 02:47:02,100
Yeah, there's stuff like that where I'm just like, or even now I feel like they are tiptoeing into like early 2000s stuff.

3662
02:47:02,100 --> 02:47:07,100
And it just speaks to this persona of Jimmy just being like the guy who's like a fan of everything.

3663
02:47:07,100 --> 02:47:08,100
He just like loves everything.

3664
02:47:08,100 --> 02:47:09,100
Like everything's great.

3665
02:47:09,100 --> 02:47:11,100
Like it's just like really positive.

3666
02:47:11,100 --> 02:47:12,100
This is like so awesome.

3667
02:47:12,100 --> 02:47:16,100
You know, the cast of The Squid and the Whale altogether in one room.

3668
02:47:17,100 --> 02:47:20,100
Whoa, the District Nine gang is back.

3669
02:47:20,100 --> 02:47:26,100
I remember like in the first couple of years before he went to Tonight Show and he was still on late night

3670
02:47:26,100 --> 02:47:32,100
when he would do like a special episode that was getting all the living Monty Python members together again.

3671
02:47:32,100 --> 02:47:37,100
Or there was one where they had Dick Cavett on and they like recreated the Dick Cavett set.

3672
02:47:37,100 --> 02:47:42,100
And it was so bizarre because you could tell that he really cared.

3673
02:47:42,100 --> 02:47:46,100
Like these are people who actually were influential and important to him starting out in comedy.

3674
02:47:46,100 --> 02:47:50,100
And he's a big fan and he has real questions to ask.

3675
02:47:50,100 --> 02:47:55,100
And clearly this episode is a labor of love and the audience just doesn't give a shit.

3676
02:47:55,100 --> 02:47:59,100
Like you can see that like he's like, like, Dick, you'd like created everything.

3677
02:47:59,100 --> 02:48:00,100
Like you changed the game for all of us.

3678
02:48:00,100 --> 02:48:02,100
Like I'm rocking in your footsteps and everything.

3679
02:48:02,100 --> 02:48:06,100
And the audience just has no idea who Dick Cavett is.

3680
02:48:06,100 --> 02:48:14,100
And I feel very quickly after that, it's like the show is now trying to reunite the cast of Full House or say by the bell, you know,

3681
02:48:14,100 --> 02:48:21,100
like doing that as like an event that stretches over months and acting like I care so much personally.

3682
02:48:21,100 --> 02:48:28,100
Me, Jimmy Fallon, I care about the idea of getting Mario Lopez to wear his weird half cutoff shirt again.

3683
02:48:29,100 --> 02:48:36,100
You know, to that point, it's kind of what you have to give yourself over to to be the host of the Tonight Show.

3684
02:48:36,100 --> 02:48:37,100
I have one more clip I want to show.

3685
02:48:37,100 --> 02:48:40,100
There's another thing I've thought about a lot since it happened.

3686
02:48:40,100 --> 02:48:42,100
And this is from before the ride.

3687
02:48:42,100 --> 02:48:50,100
This is when he when he did a week of shows in Orlando, as we referenced.

3688
02:48:50,100 --> 02:49:00,100
And he so there's a kind of an extended thing, him like, you know, checking out, you know, Diagon Alley and all this stuff.

3689
02:49:00,100 --> 02:49:02,100
And then finally, it's time for him to tape the show.

3690
02:49:02,100 --> 02:49:05,100
So we end up with this moment. You guys seeing this kind of yellow frame here?

3691
02:49:05,100 --> 02:49:09,100
Yeah. Yeah. OK. So this I mean, it'll play more.

3692
02:49:09,100 --> 02:49:13,100
It doesn't really work as audio, but just just so you guys can see this moment, I think,

3693
02:49:13,100 --> 02:49:19,100
taught me what it takes to be a crowd pleaser, to be the host of the Tonight Show and see if you catch what I'm saying.

3694
02:49:19,100 --> 02:49:20,100
But when I show you this.

3695
02:49:29,100 --> 02:49:37,100
So this is a clip of he's running down a red carpet to the big universal gates

3696
02:49:37,100 --> 02:49:42,100
and he is high fiving all of the universal characters who, by the way,

3697
02:49:42,100 --> 02:49:46,100
this clip also exemplifies to me the universal experience of, you know,

3698
02:49:46,100 --> 02:49:53,100
there's the Disney gang and, you know, goofy kind of fits alongside the genie or whatever, even though they're from different eras.

3699
02:49:53,100 --> 02:50:03,100
And in this, Jimmy is high fiving a lineup that includes the Simpsons and Sight Shabab and Thing One, the man in the yellow hat,

3700
02:50:03,100 --> 02:50:06,100
a lot of rabbits from Hop. Yeah.

3701
02:50:06,100 --> 02:50:10,100
He knows characters from Hop. So it's so much Hop. A lot of Hop.

3702
02:50:10,100 --> 02:50:13,100
You catch him noticeably missing Shrek's hand.

3703
02:50:13,100 --> 02:50:19,100
Shaggy and Scooby, Egyptian Beetle Bailey.

3704
02:50:22,100 --> 02:50:24,100
I love it. I'm loving this.

3705
02:50:24,100 --> 02:50:27,100
I mean, this is universal right here as well. This is universal.

3706
02:50:27,100 --> 02:50:31,100
Here comes Beetlejuice. There's like, I think, Groucho Marx at the end of the line.

3707
02:50:31,100 --> 02:50:33,100
Those chickens are also from Hop.

3708
02:50:33,100 --> 02:50:38,100
So much Hop. Yeah. I mean, I think no clip exemplifies the vibe of universal better than this.

3709
02:50:38,100 --> 02:50:44,100
But also, just to go back to this frame where he's kind of he's smiling and high fiving.

3710
02:50:44,100 --> 02:50:47,100
And I just thought, like, this is why.

3711
02:50:47,100 --> 02:50:55,100
OK, Leno won. He beat Letterman because he would go shake the hands of the affiliates.

3712
02:50:55,100 --> 02:50:58,100
That's what being the host of the night show is. Letterman is like a snarky guy.

3713
02:50:58,100 --> 02:51:01,100
Conan's a judgy snarky guy.

3714
02:51:02,100 --> 02:51:07,100
Leno shook hands and Fallon high fives the cat in the hat with a huge grin on his face.

3715
02:51:07,100 --> 02:51:12,100
And that's why it's that's why these guys are doing these jobs.

3716
02:51:12,100 --> 02:51:16,100
And it doesn't stay, you know, then Letterman and Conan went and did their own thing,

3717
02:51:16,100 --> 02:51:19,100
which I guess could not be the tonight show.

3718
02:51:19,100 --> 02:51:22,100
This odd, like, cursed idol that people end up with.

3719
02:51:22,100 --> 02:51:25,100
It's also like, look, that's that's a lane.

3720
02:51:25,100 --> 02:51:29,100
It's hard to do. You know, I certainly caught that.

3721
02:51:29,100 --> 02:51:30,100
I certainly couldn't.

3722
02:51:30,100 --> 02:51:36,100
I understand it takes skill and it takes effort and whatever to be America's best friend.

3723
02:51:36,100 --> 02:51:43,100
Like, that's a full time job, both in terms of the energy it takes and the sort of management of your own personal brand

3724
02:51:43,100 --> 02:51:48,100
and the control over every tendril of it and being equally positive about everything you see.

3725
02:51:48,100 --> 02:51:51,100
I get that. But it also feels like.

3726
02:51:51,100 --> 02:52:03,100
He he and and for a long time, he used to be a big gripe of mine of just like this feels like the end of sort of specific comedy viewpoints.

3727
02:52:03,100 --> 02:52:09,100
Right. When when the show was doing so well, when not only did Conan fail on the tonight show,

3728
02:52:09,100 --> 02:52:14,100
but Jay came back and then Jimmy took over Jay and it was succeeding.

3729
02:52:14,100 --> 02:52:16,100
It was like, I guess I don't know.

3730
02:52:16,100 --> 02:52:18,100
Is this just what people want now?

3731
02:52:18,100 --> 02:52:24,100
Do they just want a guy who seems like their friend who is like completely unwilling to take any stance on anything?

3732
02:52:24,100 --> 02:52:33,100
Even beyond like Jay Leno going after OJ Simpson, you're like that feels like it would be too aggressive for Jimmy Fallon.

3733
02:52:33,100 --> 02:52:39,100
You know, and he was forced to change in Trump world and for the hair ruffle.

3734
02:52:39,100 --> 02:52:41,100
So he does the hair ruffle.

3735
02:52:41,100 --> 02:52:47,100
And it's the opposite of what Jay did, which is like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, heète.

3736
02:52:47,100 --> 02:52:50,100
And what Jay did, which is like, Jay was so softball.

3737
02:52:50,100 --> 02:52:52,100
He was so friendly to celebrities.

3738
02:52:52,100 --> 02:52:55,100
He let Hugh Grant rehabilitate his image.

3739
02:52:55,100 --> 02:52:58,100
Letterman was a little too like toothy.

3740
02:52:58,100 --> 02:53:02,100
And so Jay got him back by shaking the audience hands and being everyone's best friend.

3741
02:53:02,100 --> 02:53:12,100
And instead, it was this like cultural collapse moment where Fallon ruffles Trump's hair and then everyone decides we don't want frivolous bullshit.

3742
02:53:12,100 --> 02:53:15,100
We need people to like take this seriously.

3743
02:53:15,100 --> 02:53:20,100
And suddenly Colbert just grabs the ring from him and has not let go.

3744
02:53:20,100 --> 02:53:23,100
And Colbert has just become more and more political.

3745
02:53:23,100 --> 02:53:28,100
And he just has been running circles around Fallon in the ratings.

3746
02:53:28,100 --> 02:53:37,100
I also think that coincides with this idea of just like, why is it only a certain type of affable white man in a suit who gets to ascend to this type of position?

3747
02:53:37,100 --> 02:53:42,100
Why is only this kind of like personality lists, you know, sort of like I'm everyone's friends.

3748
02:53:42,100 --> 02:53:48,100
I'm a standard, inoffensively handsome man who gets to do this sort of job.

3749
02:53:48,100 --> 02:53:57,100
Like all this stuff is like starting to come to a head and be reexamined right around the time that they're reopening this ride or they're opening this ride rather.

3750
02:53:57,100 --> 02:53:59,100
Yeah. And now we have it.

3751
02:53:59,100 --> 02:54:06,100
As we said, it is a it's a like time capsule of already a bygone era.

3752
02:54:06,100 --> 02:54:09,100
What happens? Does he keep being the host?

3753
02:54:09,100 --> 02:54:14,100
Does he? What happens to this ride if he is not the host?

3754
02:54:14,100 --> 02:54:17,100
Or do things just just trump out of there?

3755
02:54:17,100 --> 02:54:22,100
And now we want and the virus ends or this lockdown ends and now we want to be silly fun again.

3756
02:54:22,100 --> 02:54:24,100
It's it's it's hard to know.

3757
02:54:24,100 --> 02:54:27,100
I think whatever 2020 is going to have.

3758
02:54:27,100 --> 02:54:30,100
What a statement. 2020 is going to have a lot of impact on a lot of things.

3759
02:54:30,100 --> 02:54:33,100
But I am interested in this specific area.

3760
02:54:33,100 --> 02:54:35,100
Like, what will we be ready for fun again?

3761
02:54:35,100 --> 02:54:41,100
Or do we have to mire in a bunch of fucking post corona misery comedy, non comedy?

3762
02:54:41,100 --> 02:54:56,100
It also just feels like the idea of having like the late night talk show as the thing that everyone can come to as this sort of like great cultural meeting place is kind of out the window, not just because there are so many more talk shows now,

3763
02:54:56,100 --> 02:55:11,100
but because there are also so many other types of content in general and you have generations who are never going to think about the idea of sitting down and watching a full hour plus of one person hosting a late night talk show, you know,

3764
02:55:11,100 --> 02:55:14,100
because they want their content in quick bites.

3765
02:55:14,100 --> 02:55:17,100
But here's that's what it boils down to.

3766
02:55:17,100 --> 02:55:19,100
They want one of two things.

3767
02:55:19,100 --> 02:55:29,100
They either want the one funny thing that Ariana Grande did on Fallon last night cut down to three minutes or they want to watch seven hours of Ninja.

3768
02:55:29,100 --> 02:55:42,100
You know, like they will watch like that for them is closer to a talk show is like watching YouTubers do like extended live streams and make appearances on each other shows like that's exciting to them or they want to see short form stuff.

3769
02:55:42,100 --> 02:55:56,100
But I think the idea of like an entire talk show that is still holding on to these sort of like classical tropes of like you have the opening and the monologue and then there's a little sketch and then there are two guests and then there's a little like interactive thing and then there's a musical act of whatever.

3770
02:55:56,100 --> 02:55:58,100
I think they would just be like, I don't need all of this.

3771
02:55:58,100 --> 02:56:02,100
I'm only going to watch the parts that I want to watch and only if there's someone I like on it.

3772
02:56:02,100 --> 02:56:03,100
I'm not going to tune in every day.

3773
02:56:03,100 --> 02:56:17,100
Something Conan knows really well and I think Conan's like deconstruction while keeping the core but we're also going to do the podcast and it's going to be clips and I think he gets he knows that like and for an hour a night you watch your old pal.

3774
02:56:17,100 --> 02:56:18,100
It's just kind of not there.

3775
02:56:18,100 --> 02:56:44,100
I think Colbert is also wisely going like I need to do what Daily Show was doing during the Bush era like I need to be the show where like all the angry liberals can unwind and have a laugh and it's the reason why he's retained an audience better than Fallon because the types of people who would want to watch a show that's just like we're all friends we're having fun we're playing games are maybe getting distracted by entirely different types of entertainment.

3776
02:56:44,100 --> 02:57:01,100
Whereas Colbert is doing the show for people who still want to be watching a nightly talk show like he is still doing the show for the targeted audience who likes that format and speaking to their concerns and their anger and there have been those two big New York Times pieces on Fallon in the last couple of years.

3777
02:57:01,100 --> 02:57:30,100
One was the Itzkoff one that was like done a couple months after the Trump thing that was him like the first sort of like ding in his armor trying to come back from that and explain it and he just keeps on saying like I just don't want to make a challenging show like my goal is like people have tough lives and I want to do a show where they can have fun at the end of the day and I question whether there is a large enough portion of the viewing public who views watching that entire show as the right type of entertainment.

3778
02:57:30,100 --> 02:57:52,100
So that's the type of way to unwind you know if they're individual segments much like James Corden where there are little bits and pieces that travel wildly across the internet that people love but that like the talk show is starting to become more and more of a niche thing for comedy nerds again and then if you're not doing that you're a delivery system for viral clips for later.

3779
02:57:52,100 --> 02:58:07,100
So do we think that then that that Millennials are below or teens you know in 2020 do they still want to take a race through New York where they get to smell pizza and avoid a shark.

3780
02:58:07,100 --> 02:58:11,100
I have data that says they do apparently and learning to one man.

3781
02:58:11,100 --> 02:58:22,100
Maybe the way they think of Jimmy Fallon like they don't even really think of him as oh host of the Tonight Show that show whose format I know very well.

3782
02:58:22,100 --> 02:58:31,100
They think of him as just like he's a guy who shows up and does stuff he like hosts a bunch of things. He's just like very positive and excitable. Why wouldn't he take me on a race through New York.

3783
02:58:31,100 --> 02:58:40,100
Teens don't know the history the rich history of this institution that this is what the lobby is for this what the lobby is for Steve Allen.

3784
02:58:40,100 --> 02:58:48,100
Yeah, we did. It's all right Steve Steve. They don't remember you Steve. I'm trying to let them know.

3785
02:58:48,100 --> 02:58:59,100
I'm telling your story Steve Steve. I'll never let your legend die Steve. Is there a video of broker in the Today Show Cafe being like this is for you Matt.

3786
02:58:59,100 --> 02:59:02,100
They do say.

3787
02:59:02,100 --> 02:59:05,100
Oh no.

3788
02:59:05,100 --> 02:59:11,100
I'll help them develop the menu. OK.

3789
02:59:11,100 --> 02:59:22,100
Well we'll do it. We will do a longer episode about the Today Show Cafe. Actually one more question. Do the do you think that the host of the Today Show have a today writer.

3790
02:59:22,100 --> 02:59:30,100
Boy, no. These are the kinds of questions I want this ride to answer. You know if they're going to open up the world in this way I want them to really dig into it.

3791
02:59:30,100 --> 02:59:42,100
Get into logic. I'm glad we got into it. But I feel like we should have this up for all of our personal health. We've transcended several meal breaks. Did we do we know. Did we get the record. Did we win. Did we win.

3792
02:59:42,100 --> 02:59:46,100
Did we win our zoom to New York. The record.

3793
02:59:46,100 --> 02:59:59,100
The record I believe was I don't know if you count Hard Rock Park because we broke it into two after the fact. Yeah. If we keep this as one is the longest single episode is Dogpatch USA with Chris Cantwell.

3794
02:59:59,100 --> 03:00:12,100
I want to say that we broke it but the listener might be looking at a number that says otherwise. What was the dog patch episode. Like 245. I think at this point we're at three hours. Yeah. Yeah. I think it's close to three hours.

3795
03:00:12,100 --> 03:00:24,100
So we'll see. I don't know because we took we did take breaks. Yeah. That's why I'm not completely sure. But I just want to it's a it's a ride about a competition and I feel like we all need to collectively win the competition.

3796
03:00:24,100 --> 03:00:35,100
Break the record. If we didn't if I put this all together and we didn't we will come back and do as many minutes as it takes to get over the record. Great. Great. Yeah.

3797
03:00:35,100 --> 03:00:48,100
To nudge us over so that we barely like the audience barely snuff out Jimmy in his tonight writer leaving him looking the fool with his suit partially on fire.

3798
03:00:48,100 --> 03:00:59,100
I well I hope I hope that we did it. I hope I hope we did it and thanks for helping us do it. Griffin Newman you survived podcast ride. Oh my god. What a discussion.

3799
03:00:59,100 --> 03:01:15,100
I think my least favorite ride of all time. I've been on it's a favor. Do we have choices for that. Gentlemen my knee jerk is journey into imagination new version. But do you have a knee jerk. What's the worst mission space.

3800
03:01:15,100 --> 03:01:37,100
Mission space Jason it might be this this might just be a little too cynical. I would spend all day in in 30 rocket on this ride then go in that little mission space capsule and look at that low like low quality screen mission space rocks.

3801
03:01:37,100 --> 03:01:55,100
Just scramble my brain King. Yeah. Mission space can step on me. I felt like I was going to die going on the one and it's I mean that's it's crushing my chest. It's an acquired taste. It's an acquired taste. But what can I say I'm a simp for mission space.

3802
03:01:55,100 --> 03:02:08,100
Do you have anything to plug. Let's exit through the 30. Oh wait what's that Mike. Jason would let mission space make love to his wife.

3803
03:02:08,100 --> 03:02:35,100
To to use a word we've used before to cook. Yes. I was saying I was saying it in the more romantic term. That's our that's your version of seats to. Yes. Let's exit through the 30 rock gift shop full of toy t-shirts with our buddies the tight pants and you. But also is there anything that we can buy in that gift shop that you would like to plug. Oh sure.

3804
03:02:35,100 --> 03:03:04,100
How soon is this episode coming out. Do you know yet. It might be delayed a tiny bit. It might end up like 1st of August. One blank check my podcast blank check the Griffin David coast with the film critic David Sims. We're going through Robert Zemeckis will be starting Robert Zemeckis right around this point. A couple movies that have resulted in rides. That's right. Wait what else. OK. This makes me sure there's forest gum pleading to the restaurant chain which is not a. Yeah.

3805
03:03:05,100 --> 03:03:30,100
Roger. That's right. Yeah. It's actually weird. There was never a Polar Express ride but I guess that falls into Warner Brothers weird history with the parks. There is some weird Polar Express for the X. Yeah. Thing which I don't know if that counts as a in the 3D movie series that we've been doing. Is that worth talking about. Could we will we decide no but then do it anyway and then take three hours on it.

3806
03:03:30,100 --> 03:03:34,360
Probably yes. Yes. If you want it if you want to if your lizard ship does not want to deal with Polar Express 4D and you want to cover it over here at an equivalent time let us know. I would love nothing more. And I have been doing this show called the George Lucas talk show. My friend Connor Ratliff is one of the finest people in the world plays George Lucas and I play Wado the toy Darien from Phantom Menace and the

3807
03:04:01,100 --> 03:04:13,100
We used to do is a live stage show at the UCB in New York City and now it's become weekly twitch shows on planet scum dot live. So tune to those. Those are every Sunday.

3808
03:04:14,100 --> 03:04:28,100
I think the first toy that I bought for my son was a Wado from from Orlando. Yes. Yeah. I love those the hand stitched looking toys at Galaxy's Edge. I think those aredirect.

3809
03:04:28,100 --> 03:04:44,100
Those are top notch. I thought I was finally going to get to go to Galaxy's Edge and so many friends of mine have gone there have taken a photo of the Wado for me and said do you want me to get one for you. And I said no I will be going there soon enough. I want to have the experience of buying one for myself. And now who knows when I'll ever get that chance.

3810
03:04:45,100 --> 03:04:56,100
Torture torture or terrible. It makes this time is making us like all pent up and full of rage and we take it out on things like this ride based on a talk show.

3811
03:04:56,100 --> 03:05:07,100
Absolutely. It's very helpful to do so. I hope you listeners enjoyed it. Stay tuned to the second gate. Lots more stuff coming. You already do all the things if you're here.

3812
03:05:08,100 --> 03:05:16,100
Although if you're new and came to listen to this episode there's always fun stuff at the second gate and then be sure to follow us on Facebook and Twitter and Instagram. Anything else Mike Jason.

3813
03:05:17,100 --> 03:05:18,100
No I'm good. I think that's it.

3814
03:05:18,100 --> 03:05:35,100
Well all right we did it and I do well you know what I do I want to say is just like this one's for Steve. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah Steve. All right Steve. Steve we did a podcast about your ride Steve. Steve Steve Steve.

3815
03:05:36,100 --> 03:05:42,100
We have a podcast. We did a podcast Steve. Bye everybody. Bye.
