1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Warning.

4
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:10,680
The following podcast contains a savory pastry with cream chicken, feather-based lockpicking,

5
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,600
and the revelation of life's greatest treasure.

6
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:17,640
It's Sinbad's Storybook Voyage with returning guest Lindsay Katai.

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,880
There is no map, there's no chart.

8
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:20,880
It's Podcast the Ride.

9
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:46,720
Welcome to Podcast the Ride, the theme park podcast who seeks great adventure by following

10
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,880
the compass of their hearts.

11
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,360
Wait a minute, I made a mistake here.

12
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:57,760
The podcast who seeks boring information about Six Flags Great Adventure.

13
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:58,760
Sorry about that.

14
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:02,200
My name is Mike Carlson, joining me as always, Jason Sheridan.

15
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:05,960
Now there are a lot of interesting stuff about Six Flags though, because first off that's

16
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,520
one of the Six Flags with Big Body Water next to it.

17
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,520
Of course.

18
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,960
It's got a drive-through safari.

19
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:12,960
Of course.

20
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,320
Scott Gairdner, do you also have some information about Great Adventure?

21
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,320
Oh yeah.

22
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:21,120
There's people out there who've been to Great Adventure and also had Casamigos tequila.

23
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:24,120
They've also drank the tequila that is extremely common everywhere.

24
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,120
What?

25
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,720
And so that's pretty interesting that you think the same people have been to the theme

26
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,840
park and also had this very common tequila.

27
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,840
Oh my gosh.

28
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:36,440
I just realized somebody had sent me Casamigos is expanding their brand into hot sauces and

29
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:40,440
different flavors, which is very exciting to me.

30
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:43,000
But we can't take up the episode talking about that.

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Is that true?

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,920
That's insane if that's true.

33
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,720
I have a graphic of it.

34
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,040
I'm not exactly sure what the products are.

35
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,800
I was just given this graphic by a friend of the podcast, Dan Grissom.

36
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:57,000
But again, I can't get derailed looking at this right now because we have so much exciting,

37
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,040
positive, uplifting things to talk about today.

38
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,040
Follow the compass.

39
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,040
Yeah.

40
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,040
Exactly.

41
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,040
Follow it to positivity.

42
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,640
But let's welcome the guest who's very psyched about this topic.

43
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:11,800
You know her from Infinity Train, the podcast Teen Creeps.

44
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:17,240
She's a podcast, the right favorite, and she's the Sarah Davis to my Uncle Martin Daniels.

45
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:20,240
This is Lindsay Katai, ladies and gentlemen.

46
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,240
Hello.

47
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:25,120
I don't know what that means.

48
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,120
Well, it is.

49
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,120
I'm not sure.

50
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,120
It took me a sec.

51
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,120
Oh, I know.

52
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,120
Jason.

53
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,600
Well, Jason, you please explain the reference.

54
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:39,480
Well, that that's the central love story at the heart of the classic film Clifford.

55
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,760
I see.

56
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,640
You're like fighting for the whole movie.

57
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,280
I mean, it works out and they get married.

58
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,880
It's a bad like, I don't think this is something you want to be.

59
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:53,880
Well, sometimes when you follow the compass of your heart, there's some swells, you know,

60
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,880
there's pirates.

61
00:02:54,880 --> 00:03:00,960
Yeah, things, you know, love is love can be a little bit rocky sometimes, but they end

62
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,040
up in a good place.

63
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,040
That's why I said it.

64
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,040
Yeah.

65
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,520
You know, I wasn't trying to be negative.

66
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:13,760
I just need a nightmarish nephew to teach you Jason to make you a man.

67
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,480
And then the fighting will stop at some point.

68
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,480
Yeah, Jason.

69
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,480
That dinosaur ride incident.

70
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,480
That's Jason.

71
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,480
Yes, yes.

72
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:29,760
For some reason, I refuse to recognize the antics of this small man child and just be

73
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,520
a big pain in the ass.

74
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,840
That's my whole vibe.

75
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,160
Yes, exactly.

76
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,160
Why doesn't she?

77
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:42,920
Why is she so blind to his high jinkery?

78
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,920
It's kind of inexplicable.

79
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,920
Yeah, yeah.

80
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,920
Because he's off.

81
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:51,080
Like, even when he's being nice, he's still like a weird little man in a suit who talks

82
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:54,920
to a dinosaur and uses 1910 phrases.

83
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,920
Like, yeah, there's no reason she should just go.

84
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,240
She's maybe the true villain of the piece.

85
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,240
That's a good take.

86
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,240
Yeah, I hear you.

87
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,080
I'd have to rewatch the whole thing to see how that lines up.

88
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:09,280
I've been watching Clifford from the little bits I've watched and that I have been piecing

89
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,560
out just little bits of Clifford.

90
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:16,240
Clifford has really come to dominate the podcast in 2021, which is a good development for some.

91
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:19,600
And some listeners, this might be the last straw.

92
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,960
Yeah, some people are upset about all the Clifford talk.

93
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,240
And I just made it worse.

94
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,680
I just threw more wood on the fire.

95
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,680
But we can get off that.

96
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:34,520
We can start talking about the actual topic that the episode you see in the title right

97
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,520
now.

98
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,520
We should.

99
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:40,400
Well, let me let me acknowledge one thing, which is that Lindsay's not been on in a long

100
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:45,320
time and this is the like, I don't know, how has it been for a year and change not having

101
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:48,880
this podcast interrupt your breakfasts?

102
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,680
Surreal.

103
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:55,720
Too calm, maybe.

104
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:10,240
the days unless I have a 25 part podcast on the history of the wood used at Disney California

105
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:15,080
Adventure Pier and ranking each plank.

106
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:19,120
Like how how do you pass a year?

107
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,120
Yes.

108
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,160
Yes.

109
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:26,200
And yeah, we got to do just wood because when you get into nails and bolts, that's a whole

110
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,200
other.

111
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,200
That's not really what you hear.

112
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,200
Apples and oranges.

113
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,200
You can't write them together.

114
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,200
Yeah.

115
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,080
And also each bolt affects the plank.

116
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:39,200
So so they have you have to cover them separately and then do an episode about them working

117
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,200
in conjunction.

118
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:45,280
But yes, but you guys did get featured in Vulture for that 25 part series.

119
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,280
So congratulations.

120
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,280
Thank you.

121
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,560
I think well, I mean, it being that it is so essential.

122
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,680
Yes, of course, we we had to get the right up, obviously.

123
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,440
So essential that you guys were considered essential workers and you all got vaccinated

124
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,800
before in August.

125
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,080
Anyone else? Yeah.

126
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:07,960
In August, we've been like pretending like then we get to have an episode where we go,

127
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,840
hey, we're vaccinated.

128
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,920
We're back in the parks, but that ruins the I'm sorry.

129
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:17,160
I pulled back the curtain on you guys being basically health care workers.

130
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:22,120
Many months ago, we're going to have to cut this whole part out.

131
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,120
It's all unusual.

132
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,120
I'm sorry.

133
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,120
That's OK.

134
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,160
Complicate your editing duties, Michael.

135
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,160
That's OK.

136
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,160
It's fine.

137
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:32,000
So yeah, I go being the Sarah.

138
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
What's her face?

139
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,280
Just needlessly complicating things.

140
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,760
Sarah Davis, of course.

141
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:43,720
I'm surprised you didn't remember that because I've been calling you that for weeks since

142
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,720
we watched Clifford.

143
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,960
I just tune you out.

144
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:47,960
I just do.

145
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:55,080
OK, every time I just go, there's probably some fucking Ninja Turtles thing or something.

146
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,080
And then I just stop.

147
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,080
Yeah.

148
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:02,720
Yeah, love means love means occasionally saying, yep, got it.

149
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,080
So that one already, I think.

150
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,120
Jason just wrote a Ziggy.

151
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,120
Yeah.

152
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,720
I wait, I wrote a Ziggy, not a love is.

153
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,440
Well, they could maybe both be.

154
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,240
Could it be a Dilbert?

155
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,880
I don't know if it can be a Dilbert.

156
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,080
Dilbert doesn't have a lot of love in his life.

157
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,240
Yeah, you're like circa ninety five.

158
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,360
But modern Dilberts are a lot edgier.

159
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,560
It's such a lack.

160
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:34,040
Oh, a lack of experience that it's all of the right.

161
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,120
Yeah, I was just going to say, Jason, maybe it's a lock horns.

162
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,960
I think yeah, lock horns might be good.

163
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:45,640
I think you just, you know, rework it a slightly and then you can send it to all of them.

164
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,000
You know, yeah, just send it.

165
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,800
We'll we'll submit it just to King Features Syndicate blanket and they can use it in whichever

166
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,800
one they want.

167
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,120
So that'll be good.

168
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,600
You put us where you want us.

169
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,600
Yeah.

170
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:01,520
Can I say to can I say two quick things before we get into the meat of the episode?

171
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,640
Because something occurred to me and I think this is, you know, what we're going to be

172
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:12,000
talking about is one of the most like positive, optimistic, uplifting experiences in all of

173
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,640
Parkton, which I'm so happy about.

174
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:17,400
And there's two little optimistic things I want to acknowledge to go along with that

175
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,400
and ramp up to it.

176
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:22,840
As people are listening to this April 30th, this is the day that this comes this episode

177
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,640
comes out is the day that Disneyland reopens.

178
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,520
Like we've started to see, you know, cast members and people who know cast members who

179
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,720
I'm very jealous of starting to trickle in.

180
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:37,200
But today is the day that it's back, which it felt like I was worried there were times

181
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,640
that I was worried it was not going to happen.

182
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,160
Like the thought crossed my mind.

183
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:47,200
Like, what if this kept going so insane that Disneyland closed entirely and this became

184
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,680
condos? Like, that's very insane.

185
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,160
But I was worried. What was that?

186
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:57,240
I said that really would be something I can't I I wasn't worried simply because I can't

187
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,520
imagine a world without Disneyland.

188
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:05,080
Yeah, yeah. Well, and they were like, yes, yeah, yeah.

189
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:09,240
And they're like they would have like personally, they just would have like firing squatted

190
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:14,440
Gavin Newsom themselves in public and people would have been like, yeah, do what you got

191
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,440
to do. OK, so we're back in the back in the green zone.

192
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,920
Cool. Yeah, they would have.

193
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:22,880
I mean, at the worst, they would have had to like sell to Tesla or something or sell

194
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,680
to any of these big brands.

195
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,840
And then Tesla would be running Disneyland.

196
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,280
Finally, more fires at Disneyland.

197
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,720
And Elon, Elon would have just take he would, you know, he would say like the rides are

198
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:41,240
good now, but they're really going to be awesome sauce after we take over.

199
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:47,560
And he's going to he's going to be like, whoa, whoa, this this Haunted Mansion ride, who

200
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,600
made this? What were they smoking?

201
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,720
Huh? He would have been like so random.

202
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:57,920
Yeah, he would have had all these comments from his his mind, his genius level mind.

203
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,600
What do they call it? Disneyland, even though some of it is water.

204
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:06,760
Like like 300000 likes on that for some reason.

205
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,400
Yeah, but he'll he'll do some of this material soon, I think.

206
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,880
I think he has a platform coming up.

207
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,640
Big New York platform. Yes, that's the last.

208
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,080
That's another one more bit of positivity, but not yet.

209
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,800
We got to wake up, wait another week for that.

210
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:25,160
The other thing I wanted to say, and this is just not a personal thing, really quick,

211
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:30,000
I had to share this, but just as things start reopening, going to places has opened back

212
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,440
up and I've been able to do some really fun stuff with my baby son, increasingly less

213
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,560
babies over a year. I don't know if we even call him that now.

214
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,240
We got to go to the zoo, which is very magical.

215
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,960
And, you know, animals, sure, whatever.

216
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:46,720
But the main thing is I now have been on a ride with my son.

217
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,720
This is a big deal.

218
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,680
I was so happy.

219
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:55,200
And now we haven't now we should say we're all probably not going to get around to the

220
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,640
parks for a little bit.

221
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,760
I think it's coming.

222
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,160
But, you know, you'll hear us update you about that.

223
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,520
Hey, we're back and we did it and it was cool.

224
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:06,040
So it wasn't one of the big league parks was very special anyway.

225
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,880
There's a place called Travel Town.

226
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,600
Have you all been to Travel Town?

227
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,000
You're all in this neck of the woods, kind of.

228
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,680
Are people aware of Travel Town?

229
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,800
I know it, but I actually have not made it over there.

230
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,760
Yeah, got to do it.

231
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,880
Meet us there sometime. It's great.

232
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,360
It's just a place with a bunch of parked trains.

233
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,800
And that's and that's all it is.

234
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,600
Here's a bunch of trains sitting around.

235
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,640
There's a train that where the Beach Boys took a photo one time.

236
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:35,320
So that I was happy to see in person the famous Beach Boys train.

237
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,160
But there is famous L.A.

238
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:43,720
landmark. But there is also a little train that tools around the park.

239
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,280
Very like classic early Walt Disney style.

240
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,320
And we didn't think it would be open one day.

241
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,800
And then we went and it was open and I ran over to it

242
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,720
to a speed that was maybe dangerous to the child.

243
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,520
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. A ride.

244
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,960
We did it. Huge smiles.

245
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:03,720
Big smiles. Laughter for the entire first lap.

246
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,720
Second lap. He kind of freaked out and got bored and then cried

247
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,800
as soon as we got off of it.

248
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:12,440
But there was one very successful lap of a ride with my kid.

249
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,520
This felt like just a big moment

250
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,240
for for me as a dad and a ride aficionado.

251
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,520
It finally all came together.

252
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,600
So I just wanted to share that. Wow.

253
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,920
Congratulations. Congratulations.

254
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,560
That's big. That's early. I have been there.

255
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:33,240
I have been there because we went for Owen Dennis's birthday.

256
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,920
My boss, my former boss, the creator of Infinity Train.

257
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,840
We went to Travel Town for his birthday and we sat in a little car.

258
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:45,320
Did you not get on the train, though, to celebrate Infinity Train?

259
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,920
Wait, what?

260
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:52,320
I'm saying there's a train there to celebrate Infinity Train.

261
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,520
You should have ridden the train with there.

262
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:57,160
Well, I think maybe I did.

263
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,560
Or maybe it wasn't running that day.

264
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:02,640
I forget. But there was there was a little train

265
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,280
and there were a bunch of trains and we rented a train car.

266
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:10,120
OK, to have his birthday meal in.

267
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,800
What? Wait, I don't think I know about the rental of the train cars,

268
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,320
which I'm thinking someplace else entirely.

269
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,720
Where is this place?

270
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:22,080
It's in it's in Griffith Park, like not that far from the Disney studio.

271
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,480
You can see it from the from the 134 freeway.

272
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,800
Yeah, I think probably. Yeah.

273
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,000
Confusingly, there's some other little train place

274
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,280
that is not affiliated with Travel Town, but next to it.

275
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:36,560
So maybe it could have been that maybe I was at the unaffiliated train

276
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:40,480
the other one, which who know I don't know why they are like,

277
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,600
did they get along or are they enemies?

278
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,840
It's weird that there's two train parks next to each other.

279
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,040
They were started by a pair of brothers.

280
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,480
Yeah, there's fierce competition.

281
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,600
Two brothers.

282
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,280
They just their difference was like, should the train go clockwise

283
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,600
or counterclockwise?

284
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,880
Mm hmm. Fight over that.

285
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:05,320
I believe at Halloween, they they turn that little train

286
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:09,240
into a ghost train and then they just fill it with like kooky,

287
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:13,960
spooky stuff the whole route, because I saw that

288
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,800
I went to a few years ago.

289
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:22,560
L.A. Haunt, Boney Island set up right next to Travel Town.

290
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,080
And it was awesome. They went all out.

291
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,480
I saw a number of listeners at this event.

292
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:32,000
And as I was leaving, I was like, oh, wow, that ghost train looks awesome.

293
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,320
But it was Halloween and was sold out.

294
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,560
It was totally booked.

295
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:38,480
So hopefully this year they're both back.

296
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:43,320
You know, all this kind of like fun little cute stuff.

297
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:46,480
I am so in on every bit of it this year.

298
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,640
I haven't done any of these Griffith Park trains in the recent past.

299
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:53,520
And it's boy, this is going to be the whole rest of the year is little trains now.

300
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,360
Wow. Five years as little trains made me so about trains.

301
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,800
That's that's great.

302
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,720
A train podcast now you can get him ready for haunts, you know,

303
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,000
get him ready for haunts at an early age, which will be nice.

304
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:10,840
So he'll be he'll be like vaccinated against train like a haunted train stuff.

305
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,920
And by the time he gets to our age, he's going to be like the king of haunts.

306
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:19,240
Well, yeah, if I could have a kid, if I could like kind of thicken the skin

307
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,640
so that he's not like me slash us.

308
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:25,680
And it doesn't take him decades to never to get comfortable with.

309
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,080
I want him to be ahead of it and be like a bully,

310
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:34,240
making fun of kids who are afraid to be young me, his young dad.

311
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,760
Yeah, that's that's that's where I want to go.

312
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:41,680
So far the other direction you want to like a boy named Sue him.

313
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,760
Oh, no, that doesn't sound good.

314
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,480
I don't remember all the ins and outs of those lyrics, but it's probably not.

315
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,800
Really, he just he named his son Sue so that he'd have to fight his whole life.

316
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,280
I think that's it.

317
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,320
Well, that's it.

318
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:00,000
Hmm. I guess if I really wanted this trajectory.

319
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,880
Yeah, I could have gone with Sue.

320
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,240
I didn't go with Sue.

321
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,680
But look, a lot of trains in the future.

322
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:10,160
Maybe just a could be like like a lot of full train podcast.

323
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,080
Or maybe I just need to spin off into a little trains podcast.

324
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,560
I think Jason's going to come along with me.

325
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,280
Oh, little trains.

326
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,240
That's good.

327
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,240
Good title.

328
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:22,720
I would have I would have put a hundred dollars on Jason doing the first one.

329
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:26,680
I know I got to look through all the trademarks I've registered

330
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:29,200
to make sure I haven't already secured little trains.

331
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,520
Scott's going to have to buy that from Jason.

332
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,800
Yeah. Domain squatting.

333
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,400
Oh, no. Little trains dot train.

334
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,400
Barely used. Yeah.

335
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,040
Suffix. Wow.

336
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,880
So that's anyway, magical stuff.

337
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,360
I thought that's how that news would fit into an episode about even

338
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:52,920
more magical stuff, which I'm so happy to talk about for a while with you guys.

339
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:57,840
Yes. So we are talking today about a ride you can only experience

340
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:00,120
at Tokyo Disney Sea.

341
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:06,440
And it is top one of our top favorite top three favorite rides.

342
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:09,800
I don't know. It's called Sinbad Storybook Voyage.

343
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:15,360
And it's something we went into called the Sinbad Storybook Voyage.

344
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:19,520
And it's something we went into completely cold.

345
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,920
We didn't know a thing about it.

346
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:25,840
Again, podcast friend Andrew Grissom said, you got to do Sinbad.

347
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:32,960
We went on Sinbad and it was as magical a time

348
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,760
as like going on a ride for the first time when you're a kid, like a child.

349
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:41,760
We felt like children being on this ride and discovering what it was,

350
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:45,160
you know, as it went.

351
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,160
Yeah. So we've all three of us have been on it.

352
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,400
Jason has watched YouTube videos, I assume.

353
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:53,840
Yes, I watched it a number of times this morning.

354
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,880
And I have to say it is one of the rare rides where it's like,

355
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,280
oh, this is moving just on video.

356
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:06,080
This is, I mean, an emotional year and a half or so, you know.

357
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:12,320
So kind of primed for it was a little worn out

358
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:16,280
going to two grocery stores yesterday, like a little like,

359
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:23,240
so I guess I was kind of in the anything can set me off these days.

360
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,120
But certainly this in a good way did.

361
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,080
Yeah, I completely agree.

362
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:30,920
I don't know that.

363
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,920
And this we've talked a little bit about like weird,

364
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:38,000
like weird times when you go like, am I am I getting emotional with this?

365
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,040
We've we've done a little bit.

366
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:44,360
Like we talked a little bit about it in the frozen episode at the Let it Go part,

367
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:47,840
which I think, yeah, I agree with Scott on that.

368
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:52,400
But like this ride, I think it was the second time we wrote it.

369
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,200
We're like in the soaring part.

370
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,960
And again, I'm getting I'm all over the place.

371
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,360
The song itself is unbelievably good.

372
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,520
It's an Alan Menken song.

373
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,920
There's a soaring part that makes it the song.

374
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,000
Yeah, the ride. Yeah, 100 percent.

375
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,640
The ride is very good on its own.

376
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,240
It's a cute, fun little time.

377
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:15,320
But that song before the the singing even starts.

378
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,080
Yeah, I had me. Yes.

379
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,600
And there's like a soaring part of the song.

380
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,840
And I think it was the second time we wrote it.

381
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,160
I think we wrote it like four times, maybe the soaring part of the song.

382
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:29,280
I start to go, oh, my God, it's like I have some like sense memory

383
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:33,040
or some memory from being like six and going on this ride.

384
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,200
And I'm like, why am I so moved by this?

385
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,000
The room where the like giant is playing the bass.

386
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,280
What is this doing to me?

387
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,400
But yeah, there's something about that song

388
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:47,440
that makes this thing like extra special.

389
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:51,480
Yeah, I just watching the YouTube videos this morning.

390
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:54,000
And then because I cried because of that, I was like,

391
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,640
oh, I bet that Tokyo Disney Resort

392
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,040
35th anniversary theme song still makes me cry.

393
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,440
And so I went and listened to that and it makes me cry even more

394
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,560
because now the lyrics take on this extra poignancy

395
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:10,400
because of the last year of lockdown and not being able to go to the park

396
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,160
because it's it's all about like, hey, hasn't it been a while

397
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,880
since you've come on down and played with your friends?

398
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,720
And I'm like, it has.

399
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,840
Yes, I totally agree.

400
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,920
We had a very nice magical time at Tokyo Disney.

401
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:29,840
And that was the anthem playing like maybe immediately

402
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,000
as we got to their main street.

403
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:32,800
Yeah, it was playing.

404
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,960
It's playing in the monorail area.

405
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,280
Even I don't know.

406
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,680
Do you guys know we played that song for you?

407
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,760
Yes. Yeah. OK.

408
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,560
I think I don't.

409
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,840
I don't remember if it was.

410
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,080
I don't think this was going by the time I got there.

411
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,960
And I think this may have been retired.

412
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,480
I mean, we should probably play a little snippet of.

413
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,960
I don't know what the rules are as far as how much song we can play, really.

414
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,320
But we've broken those.

415
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,480
We like hear about that in the moment.

416
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,560
Yeah. Yeah.

417
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,960
Things all the time. You are correct.

418
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,720
You know, we'll just take it down nicely.

419
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,600
Just two little, two little.

420
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,960
This is the song Lizzie's talking about.

421
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,440
Brand new day, I believe, right?

422
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:09,840
Yeah.

423
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:21,880
It's a it's in the second verse where they said, like,

424
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,400
hasn't it been a while since you played with your friends?

425
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,320
But all right, I can I can.

426
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,120
We have four.

427
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:33,440
The difference between this and the song and Sinbad, though,

428
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,000
this is in English.

429
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,160
Compass of your heart in the ride is 95 percent or more in Japanese.

430
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,200
Yeah, they only say compass of your heart.

431
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,160
In English. Yeah.

432
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,960
Here we go. It's ramping up.

433
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,200
One, two, three.

434
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:31,960
This is where the listeners think this is insanity.

435
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,240
Yeah, probably. Is it? Or not.

436
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,960
I mean, if anybody is not going to think it's insanity, it's your listeners.

437
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:45,480
Yeah, I well, I mean, yeah, if you wandered into this podcast today,

438
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:48,120
you're probably like, these are for lunatics.

439
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,920
What's like? What is like?

440
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,960
These people need therapy.

441
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,440
And you're right. That's all.

442
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,040
Yeah. And that's like that song.

443
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,680
Yeah. And that's like that song.

444
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,600
Like you're like, I guess it's OK.

445
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,080
It sounds like I don't know.

446
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,600
Was it even recorded very well?

447
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,440
I don't know. It makes me cry.

448
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,320
It makes me cry every time I hear it.

449
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,560
And it really makes me cry when it gets to the chorus.

450
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:12,880
But then when I was listening to it today, it the lyric is, I think.

451
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:17,280
Like it's.

452
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,880
I mean, all right, here, I'll just play it.

453
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,960
Hasn't it been a while? Like you?

454
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,000
You. The world is.

455
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,360
Sure, yeah.

456
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,960
Here it is. Here it is.

457
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,200
I know you haven't come to party in a while.

458
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,480
In a while. Right.

459
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,240
Come to party in a while. Right.

460
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,680
It's too applicable.

461
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,800
That's a that's one of the funny of the moment.

462
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,440
Cultural differences, I think, is like saying like come and party,

463
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,520
I think is much more of an innocent fun thing in Japan

464
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:56,320
versus here where it sounds like you're going to go get loaded at Disney.

465
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:01,400
Like, yeah, more of your body lyrics that contain nothing,

466
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,400
not one sliver of an offensive word.

467
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,200
Well, I'm saying already. What is this filth?

468
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,320
I mean, like I am certainly offended by the use of it.

469
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:14,640
I'm just saying I think it's maybe a different a different word usage there.

470
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,000
So, yeah, that's that's one of the things.

471
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,760
And I think it's partly that's that's burning our brain because, yeah,

472
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,920
it was like literally we got into the Main Street

473
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:25,000
and there was like explosion of like confetti in the songs playing.

474
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,560
We're like, oh, man.

475
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:29,040
People ran to see it.

476
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:32,360
Yeah. So anyway, that's that was again, you can go back and listen.

477
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:36,200
We did an episode about our Tokyo Disney trips, both Lindsay and I,

478
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,640
and then a different episode with Scott.

479
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:42,440
So well, let me say that because so you guys did a Tokyo episode

480
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:47,960
and I was I was too strict about spoilers and I physically left the episode.

481
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:50,080
That was the plan. It was not a storm out.

482
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,880
I think you were just strict enough.

483
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,440
I think, well, I'm glad I was because it was it is the rare occasion

484
00:24:56,440 --> 00:25:00,240
like to get to go on rides where I truly don't know what's going to happen.

485
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:07,240
Now, the Sinbad thing, I think, because Erin, my wife, did listen to the episode.

486
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:12,080
And when we got to Sinbad, I sort of knew what I knew that Sinbad was

487
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:15,760
full of animatronics and a boat ride.

488
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,600
I wasn't going in totally blind.

489
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,240
But she said, yeah, I think the thing is, there is this song,

490
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,920
there is a song in it, and the song is very emotional.

491
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,720
And I was like, we'll see.

492
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:28,400
We'll see how emotional this song makes me.

493
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:32,800
And I think as soon as the boat took off, I was tearing up.

494
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,880
I don't think there was one lyric yet.

495
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:40,360
And somehow I and then watching the video just did it again.

496
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:43,600
And we're just going to have to analyze why, because I think, you know,

497
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,000
to some listeners, it might be inherent.

498
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:46,960
It might be you might.

499
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,920
But I do think that the experience is part of it.

500
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:53,360
And I have theories as to the what is so emotional about all this.

501
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,320
But we can get into it. Right.

502
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:58,320
To Mike, like maybe a minute into the ride.

503
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:02,760
And I was like, have we is this song from something?

504
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,480
Why do I feel like I've heard it before?

505
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:09,240
So my theory is just having that all of us having been raised on

506
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:13,920
specifically the Disney music of Alan Mankin and Howard Ashman.

507
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:20,520
We are primed to like connect to the musicality.

508
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:24,280
Yeah, I mean, that's that's got to be part of it.

509
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:27,080
That it's like it's, you know, it's in this.

510
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:32,320
It's got the same DNA as the stuff we were raised on all the Disney songs.

511
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,640
For sure, that has to be part of it.

512
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,720
But yeah, there's an extra little X factor here.

513
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,640
We'll play a little bit of it so you know what we're talking about.

514
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,480
There's there's like piece, there's different pieces of it.

515
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,760
And this is like this is what you hear kind of right when you get on the boat.

516
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,240
Here we go.

517
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:05,680
I can see Scott's like I could see it affecting him in a little window.

518
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,360
I don't want to look at the wind.

519
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,560
I don't want to see what I'm doing.

520
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,080
I don't want to see what you guys are doing.

521
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,440
It's too vulnerable.

522
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,120
Yeah, I'm a I'm the nerve.

523
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,400
I don't want this to be an episode involving tears.

524
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,800
I could see it off our cameras.

525
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,920
Yeah, really, I can see it.

526
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,600
So like that's that's what happens right away.

527
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:24,720
And I think immediately you're kind of like, this is a big deal.

528
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,160
Whatever is about to happen is a big deal.

529
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,280
This is important. What we're doing here.

530
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:32,720
Weeping and an epic and majestic.

531
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,840
It's just it's true.

532
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:37,720
It is the beginning of something.

533
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,440
Yeah. You know, it does it for me.

534
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:43,600
Horns in general, like there's so many uses of horns that will just

535
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,120
have some physical effect on me and the horns.

536
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,680
I feel like it's French horns, probably probably a mix of things.

537
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,840
But that when that little

538
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:58,600
I think that takes you back to the beginning of Beauty and the Beast.

539
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:02,080
And it is like what you never get to experience again for the first time.

540
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:05,160
You can only have seen Beauty and the Beast for the first time once.

541
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:08,920
And this is almost like it's a new beauty and the beast unfolding.

542
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,960
And you had to come into a specific place across the globe to see it.

543
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,320
And you're exhausted and worn down.

544
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,720
And it's in Japan is such a crazy fun adventure to go do.

545
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,680
But it's not relaxing in any way.

546
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:25,000
It's like an agitated go, go, go, holy shit kind of trip.

547
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:29,440
So by the time you get here, which was like towards the end of the trip for me.

548
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,480
And it's all been so magical.

549
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,480
Boy, there's there's a lot feeding into it.

550
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,080
The yeah.

551
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,240
I just want to shout out those who like those who

552
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:43,520
who those who's something about those are like very spooky, but like uplifting.

553
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:47,320
That, I think, is another one of the main components of like this making

554
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,680
like chills from time here's fine.

555
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:53,080
We're going to say so many embarrassing things in the next so many minutes.

556
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:58,080
I'm realizing now I I mine and Kelly's podcast

557
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:02,320
is maybe like more emotional.

558
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:08,000
Like, we're probably like, I don't want to get super like stereotypical,

559
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,240
but we are two women.

560
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:14,880
And we're maybe a little more open and vulnerable.

561
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:19,480
So I've cried a fair number of times on a teen creeps episode.

562
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:23,960
Like we read Never Ending Story and we were reading some passages from it.

563
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,920
It's a very touching book.

564
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:29,760
And I like couldn't get through it because it's crying.

565
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,680
So for me, I'm like, yeah, it's totally normal.

566
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:34,240
We're just going to like cry over us in bed song and we all get it.

567
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:38,600
Well, we're three tough, stereotypical men

568
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:45,040
who are trying to have an aura of, you know, of like strength.

569
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:49,560
So we're going to try to maintain that hard asses.

570
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:52,080
Three traditionally are in men.

571
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,640
Three hard asses.

572
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,000
What's on your head right now?

573
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,080
As you say this, Mike, you describe.

574
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,960
I am wearing what is it called, Jason, a gator?

575
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:02,600
It's a I think it's a gator, right?

576
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,720
Yeah, this is for this is for like athletes, Scott.

577
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,000
You got to know this.

578
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,880
I'm wearing a brawny, strong, emotion free athletes.

579
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:14,080
My hair is very long right now and sort of to keep it up.

580
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:17,960
I've been wearing this gator given to me by my friend John, who was on Survivor.

581
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:20,760
And it says Slam Town on it.

582
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:23,720
Well, slamming is pretty masculine.

583
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:26,200
It was not much more masculine than slamming.

584
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,040
Yeah. So all right.

585
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,400
Pumped up the testosterone here.

586
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,880
No way. We're not going to cry in this episode.

587
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,840
What do you mean? No way.

588
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,200
It's not going to happen anyway.

589
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:41,520
Back to the song and everybody just like just like grimaces and tries to grit.

590
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:47,200
Really? Like I rewatched the I rewatched Alan Menken's performance of it.

591
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,120
Oh, I have a D23.

592
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:54,800
That one makes me just weeping because everybody in the audience is weeping to.

593
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,880
Scott, you've seen this clip, I assume, right?

594
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,920
I have. I don't want to go against you.

595
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:03,200
There is something I the Alan Menken performance does not do it for me as much.

596
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:08,280
And I think why is that I love first of all, I love the singing voice of Sinbad,

597
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,800
the protagonist in the ride.

598
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:14,040
And I think I prefer it as much as like an acoustic performance, you know,

599
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:14,880
should do it for me.

600
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:19,120
I think that switching it back to English kind of undoes the mystery.

601
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:22,880
I sort of like not knowing what the words are of this song

602
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,880
that's making me so emotional.

603
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:29,560
Like I think because you can like almost apply anything to the to the Japanese

604
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,120
lyrics, which I don't.

605
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,320
If you speak Japanese and you can't apply anything to it.

606
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:37,440
But I don't know what they're singing about until they say compass of your heart,

607
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,000
which has some like innate power to it.

608
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,000
I like that it's the only English.

609
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,720
And yeah, I don't I don't disagree with that.

610
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,200
But I think that what I'm responding to actually even more is that he's playing it

611
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:52,160
at a Japanese D23 in, I think, 2018.

612
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,360
And he says he's never performed it before.

613
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:59,120
And they cut to the audience and people immediately are like freaking out.

614
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,520
And then gasping, their hands are going up to their face.

615
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:03,800
And he's playing it.

616
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:06,040
And there's just like women are like sobbing.

617
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:09,000
Everyone's like you can see like this is real.

618
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,040
This emotion is real.

619
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:16,760
Yeah, there's a shot of one person and they're just like serenely smiling

620
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,920
and nodding along.

621
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:22,520
And then you realize they have a sorcerer Mickey like propped on their lap

622
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,960
like a sitting child.

623
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:28,240
And you can just tell it's the happiest moment.

624
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,000
And it yeah, you can feel the energy.

625
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,000
I think the lyrics in English are very beautiful.

626
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:39,200
But I agree. I understand that, like, oh, yeah, there is a certain mystery

627
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,760
in the fall. Yeah, I hear what you're saying.

628
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:47,560
But but hearing the lyrics in English for me had the opposite effect.

629
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:51,640
And I did feel like, oh, I've been hearing this since I was a child.

630
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:54,280
This is making me feel like I felt when I was a child.

631
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:58,200
But I was 36 when we went

632
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,520
and heard this song for the first time.

633
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:07,160
I would never I would never take away the emotion that you guys are experiencing

634
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,480
this for whatever reason.

635
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,520
I don't get us on board. But yeah, yeah.

636
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,960
But we can all play.

637
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:12,920
We all get something.

638
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,240
Yeah. Do you want to play more?

639
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,160
And then we should play. Yeah.

640
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,720
I don't think we said what the hell the right.

641
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,480
I know. I know. We got a song.

642
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:23,840
We've been focused 100 percent on the emotions the song evokes.

643
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:30,000
Well, I mean, I think the song is a big part because this ride is kind of new ish.

644
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,120
Like this version of the ride only dates to 2007.

645
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,120
And that's when you get the song.

646
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,560
It's when you get a lot of the cute little stuff.

647
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,120
We haven't even mentioned Shondu.

648
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:42,920
Yeah, yeah. I mean, I think we'll play this song just so everybody

649
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:45,680
who doesn't know anything about this has sort of the vibe in their head.

650
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,920
And then we'll start describing sort of everything.

651
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,800
Yeah, there's two key parts.

652
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,160
Just real quick, I want to play.

653
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:54,520
This is sort of the start of when Sinbad starts singing.

654
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:59,200
And then I want to play that thing I mentioned, the soaring part, which just

655
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,760
I will hopefully not lose it.

656
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:34,480
I believe in the.

657
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,440
You see, there's a cute banter.

658
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,840
He's talking to the people in the village.

659
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,560
He's talking to Shondu.

660
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:40,600
And that's great.

661
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:43,680
I believe at this point when we were on the ride, I'm sure I said this last podcast,

662
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:47,120
I think I turned to you, Lindsay, and I said, man, I really like

663
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:50,160
I like this Sinbad guy.

664
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:53,600
You were just like, I'm really like, I like Sinbad.

665
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:57,040
I like his energy kind of a statement.

666
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:00,280
Yeah, I like it just seems like a good guy.

667
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:04,440
Yeah, I was like really like immediately charmed by him and his attitude.

668
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,880
I was like, I like this guy.

669
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:08,480
There's something about this guy.

670
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,200
And that's definitely captured there.

671
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:13,200
And then this this is the later in the in the ride.

672
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,600
This is sort of the soaring part I'm talking about.

673
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:27,440
The land to be found.

674
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:31,240
The right.

675
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:34,160
So.

676
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:42,280
See.

677
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:48,840
Yeah, so I got like little bumps on my arm listening to that.

678
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,840
Oh boy.

679
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,840
Man, it's crazy.

680
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,840
It's crazy, ladies and gentlemen.

681
00:35:54,840 --> 00:36:01,200
And now that I know the English lyrics, I like definitely remember what it is he's singing

682
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,200
at that point.

683
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,200
Sure.

684
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,400
So yeah, so that's the vibe.

685
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,360
That's what you're hearing the whole time.

686
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,920
It's looping around.

687
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:12,560
There's one other little section that's like when they're in like the jungle, that part

688
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,840
is the least good part as far as music is concerned.

689
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,840
No offense to it.

690
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:17,840
It's just like kind of nothing.

691
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,840
It's like the instrumental part.

692
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,840
Yeah.

693
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,920
Just a lot of like drums and so.

694
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:26,360
But it's it's it's a small world style and maybe the rare thing.

695
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,480
Maybe I can't think of anything.

696
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:32,400
Maybe since it's a small world, it's brought that back where there's a song looping for

697
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,800
the entire trip.

698
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,800
Yes.

699
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:43,440
Where it's a it's a boat ride with, you know, seven to nine big set pieces, big set pieces,

700
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,440
as we can say.

701
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:51,160
And the it's it's a seamless transition in and out of different parts of the song.

702
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:56,080
They've just like queued it up really perfectly where you're always somewhere in the bed of

703
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,880
that song for this very long attraction.

704
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:04,480
I feel like this can take, you know, 15 minutes depending on the speed of the boats.

705
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:11,480
Yeah. And it's like the difference, even even your best classic dark rides, I probably.

706
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:15,960
Like I might get a little like sleepy in certain sections, but because of the song, I feel

707
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:20,440
like there's not a part of the ride where I'm like, man, this is the weak part of this.

708
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:24,640
I do really I think I don't know that they could like put any sort of animatronic, any

709
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:30,200
type of ride over this song, but it's possible they could have done like a just put like,

710
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:35,840
I'm trying to think like a peer level attraction with that song.

711
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:41,480
If they put this into the the new journey into imagination where he where the figment

712
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:44,480
farts or whatever and the toilet on the ceiling.

713
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,000
But you hear like, oh, it's the greatest.

714
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:51,320
Like, yeah, I think you'd be like, well, that doesn't make much sense.

715
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:53,320
But I feel really good.

716
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:57,440
This is making me maybe it is the toilet on the ceiling that's making me feel really good.

717
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,480
I don't know.

718
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,000
I like this figment guy.

719
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,160
I just think he's got a good heart.

720
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,320
Life is the greatest.

721
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,280
That might do it.

722
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,400
That might ruin it.

723
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,440
If Figment was singing.

724
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,400
If he's saying in that.

725
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:15,040
Yeah, I think yeah, I think probably the song would be affected by the person singing it.

726
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:23,720
But if Dreamfinder's singing it, maybe I can see him having a Kenji style voice.

727
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,360
Sure. So that's that might possibly work.

728
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,400
The singer of Compass of Your Heart.

729
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:33,880
There's a lot of crossover, I think, between this ride and original journey into imagination

730
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:39,040
and the way people feel about it, where it is this specific thing in this specific location

731
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:44,920
never got cloned in another park that people just have really special heartwarming feelings about.

732
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:49,560
And it's and where there's like a little critter is a little critter who's really popular

733
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:53,800
in the merchandise and deservedly so from this one specific ride.

734
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:56,400
Yes. Yeah, there's for sure the parallels there.

735
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,560
That, of course, is Shandu.

736
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,000
We mentioned him earlier.

737
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:04,560
Well, let's say he's a little baby tiger with that little baby tiger

738
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,200
wearing a little baby turban.

739
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:09,640
Yes. And a little bell in the front.

740
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:14,360
This door is so, so cute.

741
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,640
This is the cutest thing.

742
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:19,120
That's a lot of the emotion to instant lovability.

743
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,480
I was taking photos of him just in the queue.

744
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:26,160
There's just, you know, like drawings of him up in the queue where he is.

745
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:30,560
You're getting a hint at the kind of thing that he does, which is mainly, despite being very cute,

746
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,560
keeping bad guys in line.

747
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:38,440
So somewhere in the line, there is him like pulling kind of like biting the fabric of somebody who's

748
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:42,120
up to no good and like, OK, so he's cute, but he's also feisty.

749
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:42,640
This is good.

750
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,640
He's the enforcer.

751
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,760
The most adorable little enforcer you've ever seen.

752
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,440
He's like, yeah, he's like Mike.

753
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,400
I'm breaking bad.

754
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,400
He's the cleaner.

755
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,200
Who do you have sweet emotions for as it goes?

756
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,400
Yes.

757
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,600
The OK.

758
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,480
Cliff notes the ride, not like scene by scene, but just basically,

759
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:06,960
you know, Sinbad's off on a journey.

760
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:12,040
He like leaves his port town and goes to all these different little islands and on

761
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:17,040
different little quests and then returns triumphantly a hero, having done hacks,

762
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,360
acts of heroism throughout his journey.

763
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:25,400
This is all conveyed via like 150 audio animatronics, right?

764
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,600
So many.

765
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,800
So many.

766
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Yes.

767
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,200
Great movement.

768
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,160
These things really move.

769
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,360
Yeah. Yeah.

770
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:35,640
No, it's a small world in that regard.

771
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,560
Yeah, extremely.

772
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:42,720
Mixed with gigantic animatronics, which I'm sure that we will highlight.

773
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:45,360
But like you think that, you know, you know,

774
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:48,200
you think you get what it is.

775
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,600
OK, it's a little it's a doll ride.

776
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,720
Like it's a small world.

777
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:55,880
But then you round some corners to see some of the most jaw dropping

778
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,440
animatronics ever built, just massive in scale.

779
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:01,760
Yes, it's it is like I'm trying to think.

780
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:06,520
I don't know if that was done on purpose, but yeah, you you it throws that surprise

781
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:11,680
at you because as far as like scale is concerned, it's very rare.

782
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:15,240
I feel like the parks were like they really you turn a corner

783
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:19,040
and it's like, oh, wait, they can do this with the OK, I got it.

784
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,400
I mean, I guess you get there's a bird

785
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:23,480
that's pretty big earlier than than the scene you're talking about.

786
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,520
But mostly, yeah, mostly.

787
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:29,880
I mean, it's kind of like approaching Ursula in Ariel's.

788
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,920
What is it called? Undersea Adventure?

789
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:33,120
Mm hmm.

790
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,200
But that was, of course, built after the Sinbad, right?

791
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:41,000
Yeah. And Ursula Ursula is obviously very impressive, but Ursula's probably

792
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:44,880
no ogre, seven feet, seven feet tall, six feet.

793
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,520
She's also like she's further from you.

794
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:50,000
She's not moving as much.

795
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,480
She's not as expressive.

796
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:53,920
You go under that.

797
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:58,280
That is jaw dropping, like getting to see kind of all angles of it.

798
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,320
It's really cool. Yeah.

799
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:02,960
So it's sort of this like it's this

800
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:09,720
like very heartwarming boat ride about a guy going on journeys all over the world

801
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:14,560
and being very supported by the people back in his town.

802
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:17,440
They're so excited for him.

803
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:18,840
Yeah,

804
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:24,720
I mean, like not to we could seen by seeing it a little more, but like,

805
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:30,240
that's, I think, where the emotion comes in for me is the like, OK,

806
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:33,000
so we know that Sinbad is going to go on an adventure.

807
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,480
Is he going to be we don't know what we're going to encounter.

808
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:36,560
What does that mean?

809
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:40,360
Do we see like one solitary boat and this guy's piloting it around?

810
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,400
And instead of what we see is this vibrant

811
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:47,080
community where everyone is so happy and everyone has their purpose.

812
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,560
Everyone has their role.

813
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:50,920
And these people are bringing food to other people.

814
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:52,520
And these there's entertainers and people

815
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:56,760
making shadow puppets and people operating the lamp to help the shadow puppets get

816
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:01,880
made, but they're all united in wishing Sinbad good luck on his journey.

817
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:07,480
And maybe you have to be there to understand why this notion is so emotional.

818
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:10,960
It's just so everybody's just

819
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:15,360
because he doesn't really have a mission beyond just I'm going exploring.

820
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:21,440
And of course, these are based on like very old stories.

821
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:26,920
In which it was not heartwarming, they were just adventures and he was kind of a

822
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:31,200
dick and his his crew was a bunch of assholes who were just like trying to steal

823
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:35,560
treasure and of course, there was an earlier iteration of the ride that was a lot

824
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:41,400
closer to the original tales and and in the original ride,

825
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:45,360
it was just a community that was just where he was from.

826
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:47,200
And it showed the people of the town.

827
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:51,600
And then when they retooled it with the music, then

828
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:58,840
it's a the whole dang town is celebrating Sinbad and his amazing adventure.

829
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:04,440
They're just so happy for him to be going out and seeing the world.

830
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:07,360
And it's not like he's.

831
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:12,280
It's not there's not an aspect to the story where it's like Sinbad's going to

832
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:18,000
save us all or like Sinbad's going to find the answer and we're all depending on Sinbad.

833
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:22,000
It's just like, hey, do you hear Sinbad's going on a boat with Shandu?

834
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:26,600
Cool. Let's go out and see him off with a bunch of banners and singing.

835
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,640
It's just so delightful.

836
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:33,880
Well, what they realized and if you read any blog post or wiki or any sort of thing

837
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:38,000
about this ride, everyone makes sure to mention it's like, OK, first off,

838
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,080
you need to know one thing.

839
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:41,600
The greatest treasure, it's friendship.

840
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:43,640
OK, that's the starting place.

841
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:46,640
And that is kind of like the thesis of this ride.

842
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:53,520
And I think why it you know, the vibe just changed so wildly.

843
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:55,280
The song was added.

844
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:57,080
Chon Du was added.

845
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:00,040
And like I was saying before we started

846
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:04,600
recording the original ride, which opened with the park, Sinbad 7 Voyages.

847
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:09,000
Everyone, everyone just looks is just unhappy to see you.

848
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,400
Everyone's pissed.

849
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:15,960
Yeah, because Sinbad, yeah, he's like him and his crew are trying to get treasure.

850
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:20,400
Like and in this he's helping everyone and he's making new friends.

851
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:24,320
He teaches a bunch of monkeys how to rock, you know.

852
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:29,880
Yeah, that's the thing is the song becomes his his ticket into every community.

853
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,440
He encounters.

854
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:33,200
Yeah, mm hmm.

855
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:37,600
Like it's a beautiful message.

856
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:40,880
Yeah, there's the like the juxtaposition between the two versions,

857
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:42,280
the original version and the newer version.

858
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:43,880
It's like in the original version,

859
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:47,520
the mermaids were like luring them to the rocks to like kill them.

860
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:51,000
And then a very traditional idea of what mermaids did.

861
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:52,560
They were, you know, sirens.

862
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:59,720
They sang and they were gorgeous to try to entice ships to two rocky areas.

863
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:02,400
So that they would die.

864
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:06,320
Yeah, in this version, not in this version, they're friends.

865
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:09,560
They're just more friends in this version and they tell you where to go.

866
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:12,800
Yeah, it's very funny that that

867
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:17,040
is kind of was kind of universal across the ancient world and that it shows up

868
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:20,520
in the Iliad, it shows up in one thousand and one nights.

869
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:24,760
But here we flip it on its head and it's like there's just more friends

870
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:27,880
telling you what's your direction to go, you know.

871
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:29,360
Everyone's a friend.

872
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:30,440
Everyone's a friend.

873
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:33,080
Just nothing but making friends on this ride.

874
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:36,680
I love all that about just supporting the journey.

875
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:39,920
He's going on a trip and we have to be we should all be happy for him.

876
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:44,000
And on a personal note, I might have said this before when I came back from Japan,

877
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:48,840
I don't recall, but how I felt because I had this unusual experience of like,

878
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:52,920
no matter what, going to this park that I dreamed of going to for so long was going

879
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:56,640
to be great and doing it with my wife and like it was this was there was this was

880
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:57,480
always going to be wonderful.

881
00:46:57,560 --> 00:47:01,640
But then I would like post pictures throughout the day

882
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:07,120
and then I would get feedback from our listeners cheering us, cheering Aaron

883
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:13,400
and I on, wow, go Scott, nothing but positive, like so insanely positive.

884
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:16,000
And I'm like, that's the that's the town.

885
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:20,200
The town is cheering me and my journey on it.

886
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:22,720
And not only that, the other thing that

887
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:27,680
occurred to me about why the whole the city supporting each other kind of vibe,

888
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:33,080
that's Japan that from my experience over those couple of weeks of everything else

889
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:37,960
in Japan, Japan is as nice and friendly as Sinbad's town.

890
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:41,600
So you've already been living in that love,

891
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:45,400
like the kindness of strangers for 10 days or whatever.

892
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:48,800
And then you get this little like depiction of it.

893
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:54,520
That I think that's why the the town, the supportive town resonates so.

894
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:57,080
Yeah, that makes sense.

895
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:02,200
It's it's I'm trying to think like, yeah, you're you compared the opening to Beauty

896
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:04,840
and the Beast and I'm trying to think like Beauty and the Beast is really

897
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,720
beautiful and it's fun and the town looks nice.

898
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:10,600
But everyone's like being real dismissive of Bell for the most part.

899
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:13,120
Like, oh, look at her, that weirdo.

900
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:14,080
Like, there's none of the.

901
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:16,640
It's not pretty. Why she got a read.

902
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:18,200
Oh, come on.

903
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,240
Enough with the reading, Bell.

904
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:22,120
Like it's so beautiful.

905
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:24,720
But like there's some negative, there's a lot of a lot of negativity.

906
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:29,000
Also, it finds her people like here's like here's the bookstore guy.

907
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,480
And here's the people I get along with and they get me.

908
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:32,800
But it's not everybody.

909
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,760
Some of the other people are nice, but they don't get me.

910
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:39,080
And that's a little more, I think, what America is like.

911
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:41,800
Maybe you got to watch out, watch out for these people.

912
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:45,960
But then there's some of the best, nicest people you're ever going to encounter.

913
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:49,760
But whereas like, yeah, maybe Japan and Sinbad's town.

914
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,280
Maybe it's like I should assume this person's a friend.

915
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:55,120
Easier to assume, maybe.

916
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:59,880
Yeah. So that's yeah, there's it's like, I guess there was a, you know,

917
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:03,040
maybe like a note in your head of like, oh, it's like make it like

918
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:06,600
beating the beast, but not so negative.

919
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:08,880
Wow. You know, yeah, they fixed the one.

920
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:10,440
I have a criticism.

921
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:15,440
Well, you don't need you don't need conflict in an 11 minute ride necessarily.

922
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:21,280
I was just about to say it's like I look, I love a story with high stakes

923
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:23,840
and conflict and darkness.

924
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:28,080
If you've seen Infinity Train, you know that about me.

925
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:37,280
I write, I wrote a show for children that was like scary and upsetting.

926
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:42,680
But sometimes you just want a story where everybody likes each other

927
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:45,320
and has a good time and sings a song.

928
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:48,520
Yeah, it's just that is that

929
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:52,240
a positive adrenaline shot the whole time, like the whole ride.

930
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:55,360
So like, yeah, we're kind of going scene and scene here.

931
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:59,520
Like basically, like you're coming kind of coming in at the end of adventures

932
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:02,360
a lot like it's almost like the adventures, like kind of wrapping up.

933
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:04,400
Sinbad has one.

934
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:05,880
He's won people over.

935
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:10,400
If the bad guys are bad guys, they have something comical has happened to them.

936
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:14,600
Like there's a scene where one of them is in like the talons of a giant bird.

937
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:19,600
Another one like fell upside down into a giant egg.

938
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:22,520
Yeah. And his little feet are kicking around.

939
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:27,640
Yeah. So it's like this this guy is like he's just he comes into a situation,

940
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:32,360
he fixes it, and now he's celebrating with his magical song.

941
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:36,440
And that's sort of the format in most of those scenes.

942
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:42,080
Yeah. And yeah, you know, to explain the difference between the two versions,

943
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:44,520
which we have a little bit,

944
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:48,320
you know, you know, there's no difference in the locations.

945
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:51,560
Like the locales never change.

946
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:55,440
The basic places that Sinbad goes, we go to this island

947
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:58,080
where there's big birds and we go visit a giant.

948
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:01,560
But the dynamic shifts in every single one of them,

949
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:04,920
they are all about making friends as opposed to a lot of the scenes

950
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:10,000
seem to be about bad stuff is happening and you're going to narrowly escape

951
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:11,280
the bad stuff.

952
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:15,600
And in that way, it's kind of an awkward mix of cute figures.

953
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:16,800
Like it's a small world.

954
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:21,080
But if they were all doing bad things to each other all around the world

955
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:24,440
and that's where you left it like, oh, no, Italy's on fire.

956
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:27,360
Can we help them? No. All right. They're on their own.

957
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:31,560
We came in just as Hitler was invading France.

958
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:35,120
And we're like, well, see you. Best of luck with that.

959
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:41,040
It's a little cute doll, Hitler, but still, it's still the stakes are real for them.

960
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:43,760
Yeah, cutest Hitler.

961
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:48,640
And another another thing like it's a lot of the same audio

962
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:50,480
animatronics, too.

963
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:55,000
And if you if you go back and watch the one that was there from 2001 to 2006,

964
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:58,400
you like and then you watch the current one, you recognize all of them.

965
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:00,080
They may be some changed entirely.

966
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:02,680
I don't know. But you seem to you kind of go, I know that guy.

967
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:03,360
I know that guy.

968
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:05,520
Mostly they just took away facial hair.

969
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:10,240
Yeah. We haven't talked about that one in a very Disney

970
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,240
classic fashion before the new rules.

971
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:15,760
Yes, they made Sinbad remove his facial hair.

972
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:17,840
The old world order.

973
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:21,560
Yes. Walt Walt's ghost came to the Imagineers

974
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,560
and he said, I know what to do to fix this, right?

975
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:27,560
Take the boy's facial hair away.

976
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:29,840
Bearded animatronics are evil.

977
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:31,000
That's the rule.

978
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,440
We all know the goatees are of the devil.

979
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:36,560
The devil has a goatee.

980
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:38,480
Sinbad shouldn't have one.

981
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:42,280
The way the presidents with beards are all the evil ones.

982
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:44,680
That's right. And the ones without hair are all good.

983
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:46,720
Nixon didn't have a beard.

984
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:49,960
He takes credit for fixing the ride.

985
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:52,480
And everybody is like, well, I think it was more the song.

986
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:54,560
And he's like, no, facial hair.

987
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:56,800
Only 100 percent that evil beard.

988
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,600
But they also like something that I don't think is acknowledged

989
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:04,480
and I don't have tangible proof of this, but I do feel like you guys talked about

990
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:07,760
the animatronics moving very, very smoothly.

991
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:08,960
And I agree with that.

992
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:12,640
And I think if you watch the old one, they're a little jerkier.

993
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:14,440
Like maybe there's more going on.

994
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:17,760
They actually might be like more advanced animatronics in that way

995
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:21,280
that that Johnny Depp moves a little more or Trump moves a little more.

996
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:25,080
And I just listed two of the creepiest animatronics that exist.

997
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:26,080
You really went for it.

998
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:29,560
We're probably applying our feelings about the real life people to it a little bit.

999
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:33,280
But I, regardless, I'm like, yeah, maybe a little too much movement going on.

1000
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:37,240
And I think that was maybe true of these old some of these older characters.

1001
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:41,640
And one place that I notice it is like belly dancing,

1002
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:46,360
there's belly dancing going on through kind of at the beginning and the end.

1003
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:49,160
And for some and I watched the original version, I'm like,

1004
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:51,680
why is this like creepier to me originally?

1005
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:54,400
And then they still dance in the new one. Why is it not?

1006
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:58,760
And I think it's like I think like the dancing is just like more manic.

1007
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:00,680
It's just like a crazier dance.

1008
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:04,680
And then they're just surrounded by people

1009
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:07,920
just staring down at the belly dancer's body.

1010
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:11,280
Whereas now it's like the person's dancing, but they're kind of on their own.

1011
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:15,400
They're just like they're off having a they're just like, it's less like spirits.

1012
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:20,120
It's less for the male gaze, perhaps

1013
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:22,640
than it is just for the celebration of dance.

1014
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:24,280
Yeah, I think so.

1015
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:25,560
I think they just want to dance.

1016
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:29,160
And there's no there's no odd little crowd like too close.

1017
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:32,080
Like they gave they gave the dancers some space.

1018
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:33,320
And I think that's good.

1019
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:37,720
But just truly and we'll get to it with the monkeys, but big time,

1020
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:41,600
the monkeys are like crazy in the old one.

1021
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:43,560
Right. And they've kind of toned it down.

1022
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:47,640
It's probably also just that the you know, they're newer animatronics.

1023
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:51,600
And maybe you can be more subtle.

1024
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:55,600
You know, you know what's like a very realistic animatronic, but that isn't.

1025
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:57,160
Well, it's a little creepy, maybe.

1026
00:54:57,160 --> 00:55:01,800
But the the shaman of song, the shaman of song is smooth.

1027
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:04,280
The movement doesn't freak me out about the shaman.

1028
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:07,280
Maybe in general, the shaman is a little creepy, but it's

1029
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:09,400
but there's fluidity for sure.

1030
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:12,320
So wait, Scott, you're saying you like the shaman?

1031
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:14,640
I don't know if I'd go that far.

1032
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:16,200
I guess technically.

1033
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:17,320
Oh, man.

1034
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:20,240
Well, you've really backed yourself into a corner here.

1035
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:23,720
Do I like I've I've been I've been hiding at this halt.

1036
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:24,880
I love the shaman.

1037
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:26,040
All right. Thank you.

1038
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:28,120
It's been my desktop this entire time.

1039
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:33,760
You can appreciate the shaman of song while still feeling like kind of an uncanny

1040
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:37,520
valley feeling about the shaman.

1041
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:39,360
Well, you know what it is?

1042
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:40,480
Actually, it just occurred to me.

1043
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:43,800
It's the it's the big stuff in small rooms.

1044
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:47,720
It's that thing rearing its head as has as it has in many episodes.

1045
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:51,280
I think if the shaman of song was open air,

1046
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:54,880
just like with the sky above it, that'd be fine.

1047
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,400
But it's a very tall creature, not a problem in Sinbad.

1048
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:02,200
I mean, there's big characters in Sinbad, but most of them are extremely small.

1049
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:07,360
So, oh, man, I can't wait for you to ride this new ride.

1050
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:11,920
Everyone's talking about and we'll get some real good feedback on that.

1051
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:14,480
I'm sure you'll be on it soon enough.

1052
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:16,800
Pets. Yeah, pets. Pets.

1053
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:19,600
Yeah, there's a big there's a big pet.

1054
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:21,920
Oh, boy, you have no idea.

1055
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:24,200
Wow. Jason got to see the big pet before us.

1056
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:25,480
I'm very jealous of Jason.

1057
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:27,720
Yeah. Big pet.

1058
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:30,320
Oh, man. Yeah, that's interesting.

1059
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,880
I will. I want to make a quick comparison, though.

1060
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,600
And obviously, it's not quite as good as the song here, though.

1061
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:38,520
But I will say the Na'vi shaman of song song

1062
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:43,560
is similar, kind of haunted our vacation, much like Sinbad.

1063
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:46,160
Haunted is true where it's like that.

1064
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:47,920
That's a new song you just heard.

1065
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:51,400
And maybe it's just me, but I constantly was singing both songs

1066
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:53,080
the rest of our trip.

1067
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:57,080
It became one of the other an additional theme

1068
00:56:57,960 --> 00:56:59,840
of the trip. Yes.

1069
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:05,320
So I will say I have zero emotion ascribed to the shaman song.

1070
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:06,320
Same song.

1071
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:10,200
I did not. Yes, I did not cry about the shaman of song.

1072
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:12,320
And it doesn't do the same thing. But it did become a theme.

1073
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:15,320
But it definitely wormed its way into my head and it

1074
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:17,680
I was using it as a weapon the rest of the trip.

1075
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:20,760
That's true.

1076
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:23,360
Every time I would forget it, it got brought back.

1077
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:26,120
I don't know. Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

1078
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:31,160
This song I kept to just like, yeah, like just like getting

1079
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:33,600
going to the airport and getting on the plane.

1080
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:36,280
I just kept like anything that felt like part of a journey.

1081
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:40,440
I would do this refrain, even though it was the opposite, where like

1082
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:44,720
I think Sinbad was kind of happy to be going home because, you know, like

1083
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:47,760
he had a good thing going back there, even though all the adventures were fun.

1084
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:49,960
We were so sad to leave Japan.

1085
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:54,240
Dear God, that was not I did not feel the joy of this song leaving

1086
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:57,360
leaving Disney. Right.

1087
00:57:57,360 --> 00:58:01,200
And yes, that was not not the same as you leaving Orlando the last time.

1088
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:04,880
Thinking of the shaman.

1089
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:08,800
That was the refrain that was supposed to like, keep me back.

1090
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:12,000
That was supposed to like, no, no, no, don't go.

1091
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,440
Yeah, it didn't didn't do the trick for me. Right.

1092
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:16,680
Neither did. Well, maybe.

1093
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:19,120
Did you have the same effect, though?

1094
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:22,800
Did the the Baja men, did the Baja

1095
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:27,200
were they like, was that like a siren song for you

1096
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:29,840
calling you to stay in Orlando forever?

1097
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:33,120
I mean, kind of. Crash yourself on the rocks of Orlando.

1098
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:37,360
The sirens, the Baja men calling to me

1099
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:41,240
enticing you from a shirtless on a rock.

1100
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:42,880
Just the idea.

1101
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:47,120
Yeah, just the idea, just the idea that you can see that list of bands

1102
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:51,800
that plays Epcot every year in Orlando does make me go,

1103
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:56,960
wouldn't be bad to live 20 minutes and head over here a couple of times

1104
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:00,280
a week and see, see the bomb and see

1105
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:03,960
third eye blind and smash mouth.

1106
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:06,640
And yeah, you can't see Sugar Ray anywhere else.

1107
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:10,360
They're very that's the rarest appearance that you make.

1108
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:14,120
Even though we have seen them two times.

1109
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:16,520
This was this was a revelation in an episode.

1110
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:19,480
Lindsay, you too. You've also seen them twice.

1111
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:23,480
Oh, yeah, we went to to the first one was

1112
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,360
Summerland or was that the second one?

1113
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:27,680
I can't remember which one was which.

1114
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:30,720
The Summerland tour and.

1115
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:33,480
We yeah, we say we remember the name of the next one, but

1116
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:37,200
it was sugar the first year was Sugar Ray.

1117
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:39,840
It was Everclear.

1118
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:41,920
It was lit.

1119
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:44,440
It was the Wallflowers and then one other band.

1120
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:47,640
Marcy Playground, Marcy Playground, who opened

1121
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:49,480
Marcy's Playground. No, Marcy Playground.

1122
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:51,200
Marcy Playground. Yeah.

1123
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:53,080
My mother's name is Marcy also.

1124
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:55,400
So that's where it was a big thing in the house.

1125
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:58,040
Yeah. When that band was around.

1126
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:00,520
It was a great time to be on Marcy. Yeah.

1127
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:04,280
And we yes, that was what over 1997, 98.

1128
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:07,200
And I think we were like, oh, Marcy Playground, good.

1129
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:10,880
Then lit hit the stage and we were like, whoa, lit is good.

1130
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:16,640
Yeah, I was like, oh, I forgot that I really liked lit as a teenager.

1131
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:23,520
They were just like, you know, people were trickling into Greek theater.

1132
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:27,560
It wasn't even like it was full yet because it was a big festival of music.

1133
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:31,800
And lit was bringing it like they were really like they didn't care

1134
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:33,240
that they were playing second on the bill.

1135
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:35,320
And we were like, oh, that's pretty good.

1136
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:39,680
Wow. And you would say, yeah, lit was lit.

1137
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:40,680
I would say that.

1138
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:43,360
And and then Sugar Ray closed that time.

1139
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:49,360
And Everclear, not so good, like audio wise.

1140
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:51,240
They were not bringing the energy.

1141
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:54,840
Sugar Ray, however, sounded fantastic.

1142
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:59,600
And Mark McGrath, a very charming band leader,

1143
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:05,600
like just really he like he knows what he is and he played it to perfection.

1144
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:07,520
Hmm. Like a 90s mic.

1145
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:10,640
Like self-effacing, like funny.

1146
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:13,360
Making fun of himself and Sugar Ray.

1147
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:15,000
It was a good time.

1148
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:19,400
I'm scanning the I'm scanning the sincerity irony meter

1149
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:21,040
and I'm landing at sincerity.

1150
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:22,120
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1151
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:23,040
No sincerity.

1152
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:26,800
He was he was like making fun of himself and him being like,

1153
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:29,440
he said the fact that this tour existed.

1154
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:33,720
He was like, he goes, yeah, you're here to see like douchey Sugar Ray.

1155
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:37,120
And yeah, and we were all like,

1156
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:39,880
we are here to see douchey Sugar Ray.

1157
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:43,440
Thank you, Mark. We're all thank you so much.

1158
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:46,120
Those singles are good. I maintain those singles are good.

1159
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:49,320
I like how you call Mark McGrath a band leader as if he was Xavier.

1160
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:50,680
Uh huh.

1161
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:52,080
His name is Brown.

1162
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:55,840
I mean, can you argue with his?

1163
01:01:55,840 --> 01:01:56,840
No. Yeah.

1164
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:02,120
So then we then we went back the next year and Smash Mouth was on the tour

1165
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:04,000
and I believe they closed.

1166
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:04,800
Well, of course. Yes.

1167
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:08,320
And Gin Blossoms was there and that was fantastic.

1168
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:09,680
Both years, I believe.

1169
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:10,360
Oh, OK.

1170
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:12,600
I believe we've talked about this repeated.

1171
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:17,080
Yeah. But they're yeah, they got the they got those fastball was great.

1172
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:18,920
Fastball was there. Yes.

1173
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:22,120
Couple of songs I like a lot of as far as best.

1174
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:23,440
All right. The audience wants to hear.

1175
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:27,240
And you guys, you two, you guys went to Sturgis, right?

1176
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:29,200
Last year to see Smash Mouth.

1177
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:30,360
You went to the Motor's.

1178
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:33,560
Mm hmm. And it worked out great.

1179
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:34,760
The sacred spreader event.

1180
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:36,240
You stand up.

1181
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:39,160
Everyone stayed six feet apart wearing masks.

1182
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:41,800
It was really a safe, just like welcoming.

1183
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:47,680
It was like it was like the town seeing everyone off, seeing Sinbad off.

1184
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:48,960
Seeing Sinbad off.

1185
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:51,440
Yeah, yeah, it was good.

1186
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:55,280
I think I've said before on the podcast that my old lady,

1187
01:02:55,280 --> 01:03:02,000
Lindsay, jumped into the sidecar on my hog and we headed out for Sturgis.

1188
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:06,000
And it was really a hell of a time.

1189
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:09,560
Yeah. You brought back a lot of memories and a lot of covid. Yeah.

1190
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:13,320
Tons, tons of covid.

1191
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:16,320
But we we had a great time in Sturgis.

1192
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:22,280
Let's let's have more stuff on the ride.

1193
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:24,360
Do we not talk about Shondu enough?

1194
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:26,080
That's the other big.

1195
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:28,560
So, yeah, there was no there was no Shondu before.

1196
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:34,280
It was it was just this this bearded mercenary band of sailors.

1197
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:36,400
Killers. Yeah.

1198
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:38,360
Stealing treasure, getting greedy.

1199
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:43,960
Get that they're the reason they were attacked by birds, whereas in the new version,

1200
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:50,160
they are pirates that Sinbad is fighting instead of the men he hired for the journey.

1201
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:53,600
Yeah. His guys.

1202
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:58,480
Yeah. So now now instead of those jerks, he's got a cute little tiger cub.

1203
01:03:58,840 --> 01:04:00,400
The cutest tiger.

1204
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:02,760
Oh, my God. If you have never seen this

1205
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:09,040
chandu and I'm sure it'll be on Twitter as we do this.

1206
01:04:09,040 --> 01:04:11,400
I boy, what a heartwarming.

1207
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:14,440
Yeah. We have our is it cute arguments all the time.

1208
01:04:14,440 --> 01:04:19,000
I would like to meet the monster who does not find Shondu to be cute.

1209
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:22,200
Yeah, I don't know. Yeah, I don't need I don't need to know.

1210
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:24,920
I don't need to know that person or their minds.

1211
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:30,240
100 percent. If we did the poll, I'd like to know who's responsible for Shondu.

1212
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:35,000
Yeah, you know, there's not a lot of like kind of in-depth,

1213
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:38,400
imagineering interviews and stuff about this attraction.

1214
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:40,520
I was trying to find some.

1215
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:43,400
Yeah, I mean, when you have this much of a retool, you shouldn't.

1216
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:45,200
There should be.

1217
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:48,680
I want to know the oral history of the Sinbad retool.

1218
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:50,880
Oh, sure. It's interesting.

1219
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:54,280
They don't do stuff like this a lot and they don't do it like unless there's

1220
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:57,560
there's a lot of change outs that involve in putting in new IP,

1221
01:04:57,560 --> 01:05:00,240
but there's not a lot of like the rides not working.

1222
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:04,600
Let's fix it. But in like a in a screenwriting way, let's do like

1223
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:07,520
there needs to be a journey and a better hero and a music

1224
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:11,000
musical arc that tells you who the character is and a fun little sidekick.

1225
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:14,360
Locations can stay the same robots change, stay the same go.

1226
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:19,040
Well, I'm very curious as to what the new Snow White ride is going to be,

1227
01:05:19,080 --> 01:05:24,000
because it's no longer the scary adventure. Right now, it's the enchanted wish.

1228
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:25,600
Yeah. Enchanted wish.

1229
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:26,880
What's that going to look like?

1230
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:29,440
Yeah. What does that phrase mean? Yeah.

1231
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:33,440
You know, because most wishes not that enchanted.

1232
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:38,680
This very enchanted most wishes for the prince to come wishing for.

1233
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:41,000
Right. So that's her wish is the prince.

1234
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:44,960
And maybe and now they have a moment at the end like the prince things resolved

1235
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:47,400
a little better in that they have a kiss.

1236
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:51,880
The wish is for a kiss and she has an enchanted kiss as per her enchanted wish.

1237
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:53,400
I think maybe that's what it is.

1238
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:58,440
I mean, Snow White's I Wish song is literally about wishing. So.

1239
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:04,640
Yes, she's wishing well appropriate, but still like not.

1240
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:09,640
Doesn't really indicate what the changes are going to be. Right.

1241
01:06:10,360 --> 01:06:14,240
Well, I mean, well, sooner today, people know.

1242
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:15,800
I think there's people already posted videos.

1243
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:18,440
I'm going cold. Yeah, I don't want to change.

1244
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:21,000
Well, that wish I wanted to know.

1245
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:22,520
Yeah, I want it to be like Sinbad.

1246
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:25,280
I was thinking you were saying like,

1247
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:28,880
like a retooling like could could could Alan Menken.

1248
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:32,640
And I want to mention Alan Menken wrote that song with a guy named Glenn Slater as well.

1249
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:35,560
Oh, yes, he should be credit.

1250
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:37,800
I believe he wrote the lyrics to the song.

1251
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:43,560
But could could Menken and Slater have saved Superstar Limo with a song?

1252
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:48,840
Maybe, you know, because like you leave the animatronics in and you leave what was there.

1253
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:51,600
But yeah, maybe like you didn't have to put Monsters Inc.

1254
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:56,160
And they could have written a song about Hollywood that would have saved the ride.

1255
01:06:56,160 --> 01:07:01,360
And now we would have been enjoying the beautiful Superstar Limo song to this day.

1256
01:07:01,360 --> 01:07:05,000
We just feel as money for me.

1257
01:07:07,040 --> 01:07:08,880
It'd be about coming to Hollywood.

1258
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:11,120
Drew Carey.

1259
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:15,000
Perfect. Soaring epic.

1260
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:18,920
Boring and epic.

1261
01:07:18,920 --> 01:07:22,880
City of stars, sea of shining just for me.

1262
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:25,960
Right. It wasn't.

1263
01:07:25,960 --> 01:07:28,240
Yeah, I get you. It wasn't out yet, though.

1264
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:30,720
Yeah, I know. To put that in there.

1265
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:32,600
But that would have been a that would have been a good show.

1266
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:34,080
They should have tried that.

1267
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:37,800
I mean, I like that one song from earlier in the really quick song that

1268
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,760
I can't remember the name of, but it's very jaunty.

1269
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:43,680
And there's a lot of costume changes in La La Land.

1270
01:07:44,280 --> 01:07:46,320
Took me a while to remember the name of the movie.

1271
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:49,240
Probably not a great sign that you would put in a ride.

1272
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:55,040
I don't know. Is that is that more of a sign of your mental state or is that?

1273
01:07:55,560 --> 01:07:56,880
Oh, yeah, it's yeah.

1274
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:59,320
My memory has definitely deteriorated.

1275
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:02,640
I definitely need to take some more supplements and interpretation.

1276
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:06,880
I'm not even sure why La La Land came up to begin with before he produced the title.

1277
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,280
Oh, jaunty Hollywood song.

1278
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:10,360
You were talking about that.

1279
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:13,120
That's the song. Yeah, it's from La La Land.

1280
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:14,680
Yeah, yeah. Stars. Yeah.

1281
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:15,840
City of stars.

1282
01:08:15,840 --> 01:08:19,360
I'm sure there's we should be advertising some sort of supplements for brains,

1283
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:21,600
you know, like the Joe Rowan podcast does.

1284
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:24,480
Yeah, some sort of a new tropic, new tropic.

1285
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:27,640
If we could, yeah, if we could put that out into the world, we're willing to

1286
01:08:28,720 --> 01:08:30,760
advertise for some sort of brain supplement.

1287
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:34,000
Have we in the way of weird.

1288
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,920
Hey, Lynn, Lynn over it forever.

1289
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:38,560
Don't get us a brain supplement.

1290
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:41,760
Yeah, get us that sweet brain supplement sponsorship.

1291
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:45,800
I want to get in touch with big brain supplement.

1292
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:47,680
Yeah, we need Jason.

1293
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:49,720
We can get Jason on these pills ASAP.

1294
01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:54,800
No, I won't take the vaccine, but I will take any weird pill

1295
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:57,760
or powder that gives money to this program.

1296
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:01,000
A tincture. If you got a tincture, I'm all about it.

1297
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:02,560
Yes, that's right.

1298
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:08,360
Let me say another thing about Chandu, which is that his popularity

1299
01:09:08,840 --> 01:09:15,120
and his cuteness is such that there is a snack in the park based around him.

1300
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:18,360
And I thought that I knew I thought I could picture what this was.

1301
01:09:18,360 --> 01:09:22,280
I thought maybe I'd even seen it or had it, but I clearly didn't have it

1302
01:09:22,280 --> 01:09:27,520
because I'd remember this because the actual what the Chandu Tiger tail is.

1303
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:32,880
If you look at it, it looks very pastry and it is orange and black.

1304
01:09:33,760 --> 01:09:37,680
Odd, odd little like question mark shaped pastry piece.

1305
01:09:37,680 --> 01:09:42,400
But what's inside, it is referred to as a chicken cream bun,

1306
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:45,800
which sounds awful to me.

1307
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:49,960
However, there were a bunch of things in Tokyo, Disney

1308
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:52,640
that sounded not the best and then were the best.

1309
01:09:52,840 --> 01:09:56,080
So maybe I would be a fan of this chicken cream.

1310
01:09:56,400 --> 01:10:00,120
Well, I think I think it's like a bow dough

1311
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:04,120
with like a chicken pot pie kind of filling, and it's just not described.

1312
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:06,040
So you can imagine that.

1313
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:07,520
Yeah, it's a savory pastry.

1314
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:10,280
We didn't, Lindsay, we didn't eat Chandu's tail.

1315
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:13,960
It sounds really might have now that I'm thinking about it.

1316
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:16,960
I think we did. Maybe I think we did.

1317
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:19,480
I think it was raining and we had it. Maybe.

1318
01:10:20,280 --> 01:10:21,080
Pretty sure.

1319
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:25,560
I don't know. I should look through the photos.

1320
01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:28,360
Yeah, we ate Chandu's Chandu's tail from each end.

1321
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:31,720
We were, yeah, like Lady and the Tramp. Yeah.

1322
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:34,880
Romantic. Did you guys see they sell a key?

1323
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:36,080
Oh, sorry, go ahead.

1324
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:38,800
They sell a key chain of the tiger tail.

1325
01:10:39,720 --> 01:10:40,720
Wow.

1326
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:44,680
A key chain of the tail and the rapper, the tail comes in.

1327
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:47,480
That's so Tokyo.

1328
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:50,080
Yeah, that was the kind of thing they'd get fixated on.

1329
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:53,200
It's great. The rappers at Tokyo, maybe we didn't say this

1330
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:58,560
on this other two episodes, like food rappers are like fully themed.

1331
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:02,120
Like art in a way they're like not like you don't even want to throw

1332
01:11:02,240 --> 01:11:05,560
the rappers away for their like quick service chicken sandwich or something.

1333
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:09,720
Because like I think the first place we ate was over in, I guess,

1334
01:11:09,720 --> 01:11:13,640
Frontierland and it was like fully themed to the junior woodchucks

1335
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:16,120
and Huey Dewey and Louie on the rapper.

1336
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:20,800
And I was eating like an OK sandwich with this like beautiful piece

1337
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:22,720
of like artwork essentially.

1338
01:11:22,720 --> 01:11:24,520
And I'm like, I have to throw this away.

1339
01:11:24,520 --> 01:11:28,120
Like and the same with such care goes into everything.

1340
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:30,920
Chandu has like his tiger tail, but then the pack is like,

1341
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:33,880
his tiger tail. But then the package with a tiger tail comes in

1342
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:35,760
is like themed to Chandu.

1343
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:39,520
And it's you find that everywhere, which is fun.

1344
01:11:39,680 --> 01:11:42,360
Little extra bit of theming, which we do not have out here.

1345
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:45,440
Oh, yeah. Such attention to detail.

1346
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:49,000
That's directly related to what I was going to say, which is we were very

1347
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:54,200
disappointed by the lack of Sinbad merchandise, much like country bears in Florida.

1348
01:11:54,840 --> 01:11:57,560
Well, yeah, it was mostly Chandu focus.

1349
01:11:57,560 --> 01:12:00,200
There was a good amount of Chandu stuff,

1350
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:04,040
but we wanted like a Sinbad doll or something like I want him playing

1351
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:07,440
like his little I don't know if it's a mandolin or guitar or whatever.

1352
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:12,040
Best friend. Yeah, because I again, I I he won me over very quickly.

1353
01:12:12,280 --> 01:12:15,120
And I was looking for like a whole all of the figures or something.

1354
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:19,360
All of the characters, especially that belly dancer figure I was looking for.

1355
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:22,440
Yeah, you wouldn't shut up about that belly dancer.

1356
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:28,720
You're either singing the song or some of that belly dancer.

1357
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:30,920
I just like her. Yeah, yeah.

1358
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:35,200
But yeah, we were yeah, we were sort of disappointed in the range of stuff

1359
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:37,440
you get. It was just mostly tiger focused.

1360
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:40,440
Not the quality of the merchandise itself, but the.

1361
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:45,880
Yeah, the lack of additional merchandise.

1362
01:12:46,680 --> 01:12:48,280
It was also Chandu focused.

1363
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:49,360
I just always want more.

1364
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:50,840
I want more, more, more all the time.

1365
01:12:50,840 --> 01:12:56,400
More. I was super satisfied with the amount of Chandu stuff,

1366
01:12:56,400 --> 01:13:00,920
and I bought a Chandu puppet and it was and which Aaron

1367
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:03,120
and I both agreed would be good to have.

1368
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:05,920
But there is to keep being corny in an episode of cornyness.

1369
01:13:06,160 --> 01:13:10,760
We and we confirm later that unspoken we were buying the Chandu puppet

1370
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:13,440
thinking I hope that this is for a baby.

1371
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:16,440
And then that is what ended up being the case.

1372
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:20,160
We would have been happy to have this tiger puppet regardless.

1373
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:22,960
We have plenty of toys as it is.

1374
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:24,920
But we're but I remember that specifically.

1375
01:13:24,920 --> 01:13:27,200
I was and you're and you're so heartwarming by the ride.

1376
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:31,720
We were just kind of like, all right, see you back in America, dude.

1377
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:34,480
And then and now on to the next generation.

1378
01:13:35,320 --> 01:13:37,400
Yeah, thought Michael has never had.

1379
01:13:40,280 --> 01:13:41,760
This is for a child.

1380
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:44,480
No, absolutely not.

1381
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:46,520
I have the opposite for me and for me.

1382
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:50,200
Yeah, I have the opposite feeling like I will not let a future child

1383
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:51,920
see like touch this.

1384
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:54,280
They will not be allowed.

1385
01:13:54,280 --> 01:13:56,440
We're like, this is for a child.

1386
01:13:56,440 --> 01:14:05,640
Me. I will undercut it by saying that he has no interest in plushes of any.

1387
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:07,880
Shandy was a bell, which is good.

1388
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:10,040
The bell helps something that makes noise is good.

1389
01:14:10,040 --> 01:14:15,360
So that puts it a notch above other stuffed animals, which he doesn't care about.

1390
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:17,840
So that all punctured that nice little fantasy scene.

1391
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:20,080
But still, it was nice.

1392
01:14:20,120 --> 01:14:21,040
There's still time.

1393
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:23,680
I mean, you can get he'll get into plush.

1394
01:14:23,680 --> 01:14:24,880
We'll get it. We'll make it.

1395
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:30,880
You brought over some you brought over fantastic plushes, a DeLorean and a Doc Brown,

1396
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:33,880
which he did immediately go for that DeLorean.

1397
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:38,320
So he has a need for speed, probably.

1398
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:40,920
He's going to be at Sturgis in a couple of years.

1399
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:45,120
He loves autos.

1400
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:51,120
And Sammy Hagar, the iconic music from BTTF to he's going to be on.

1401
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:54,000
He's going to be watching Jay Leno's garage in a couple of months.

1402
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:56,720
Oh, hell yeah. I'll take him to Jay Leno's garage.

1403
01:14:56,720 --> 01:14:57,600
He has trains.

1404
01:14:57,600 --> 01:15:00,960
And now I'll find it's probably not that far from where we live.

1405
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:02,000
I'll just go knock on the door.

1406
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:03,760
He'll probably be like, yeah, sure. For a kid. Yeah.

1407
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:10,360
Yeah. And love modes of transportation and cartoon character.

1408
01:15:10,360 --> 01:15:12,480
Jay Leno. Mm hmm.

1409
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:14,600
They love his exaggerated chin.

1410
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:18,680
That's right. He does like, you know, he yells.

1411
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:22,320
The baby yells a lot when he sees a big truck, and that's essentially Jay, too.

1412
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:24,360
It's like the enthusiasm of a six month old.

1413
01:15:24,680 --> 01:15:27,120
Ah, wow.

1414
01:15:27,720 --> 01:15:30,040
I'm trying to split the difference between Jay and baby.

1415
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:34,720
Scott compared Jay Leno to a street shark on a episode a couple of weeks ago.

1416
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:37,720
Like body wise, is big.

1417
01:15:37,720 --> 01:15:40,240
He's just so top heavy in his head is big.

1418
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:42,520
He's like a human street shark. Yeah.

1419
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:44,760
So, yeah, kids, kids love street sharks.

1420
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:50,640
OK, so oh, wait, so so trying to do this can take us into some scenes maybe.

1421
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:53,200
But I wanted to ask this question, just knee jerk.

1422
01:15:53,560 --> 01:15:55,680
And does it do people have a favorite

1423
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:59,200
Chandu moment because you see him in all of these scenes,

1424
01:15:59,200 --> 01:16:01,480
these scenes that were very like mean and joyless before.

1425
01:16:01,480 --> 01:16:05,520
And now there's some way that this cute tiger is undercutting it all with cuteness.

1426
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:07,280
And I think there's a lot of great tableaus.

1427
01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:09,760
But do you have a knee jerk? What's your favorite moment of him?

1428
01:16:10,160 --> 01:16:12,920
Well, the first one that occurred to me was him on the

1429
01:16:13,160 --> 01:16:16,680
the water spout coming out of the whale's blowhole.

1430
01:16:17,480 --> 01:16:19,280
Yeah, yeah.

1431
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:21,800
Spinning around. That's great.

1432
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:25,120
Yeah, it's hard to beat that one.

1433
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:28,240
I feel like I like him with all the bananas a lot.

1434
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:30,200
The bananas is cute.

1435
01:16:30,200 --> 01:16:33,880
The very end, he is like taking a little nap.

1436
01:16:34,680 --> 01:16:36,280
Sinbad says goodbye to you.

1437
01:16:36,280 --> 01:16:39,640
And then Chandu like lifts his head up and kind of goes like, ah,

1438
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:42,320
like that was kind of cute because he hadn't really talked

1439
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:44,800
the rest of the ride, at least from what I could tell a video.

1440
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:46,680
Just a little little moments.

1441
01:16:46,680 --> 01:16:50,320
You hear it in the in the clean audio of the song, but little like

1442
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:54,920
it's great. The little you get is plenty.

1443
01:16:55,240 --> 01:16:57,760
Yeah, I like when he jumps on a drum, too.

1444
01:16:57,880 --> 01:16:59,720
That's what I was going to say. The drum he's being

1445
01:16:59,720 --> 01:17:00,680
that's the door now.

1446
01:17:00,680 --> 01:17:04,720
Oh, yeah. He's being carried by like four guys and a big drum.

1447
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:08,960
And he's like he's on top of it like he's a conquering hero, which is really great.

1448
01:17:09,160 --> 01:17:12,000
That was another moment that that jumped out to me

1449
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:16,760
because I think when the drum sound effect hits of him jumping on it,

1450
01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:19,440
I imitated it with my mouth.

1451
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:24,200
He's in it goes, boom, boom.

1452
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:27,960
And so that I went boom, boom, just because it seemed fun.

1453
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,400
So that was the other one that stuck out to me.

1454
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:36,120
I am sure that I got home and picked up the cats that I hadn't seen in several weeks

1455
01:17:36,120 --> 01:17:39,920
and who were over with the with their grandparents.

1456
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:44,360
And I'm sure I picked one up and made them go boom, boom, boom.

1457
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:46,680
I ascribed a lot of chandu to the cats.

1458
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:49,520
Yeah, I recommend it with Edwin. Give it a shot.

1459
01:17:50,360 --> 01:17:53,560
He hates being picked up. I don't think that's it.

1460
01:17:53,560 --> 01:17:55,440
All right. Do not think that will go well.

1461
01:17:57,160 --> 01:17:58,320
Didn't work with the cats either.

1462
01:17:58,320 --> 01:18:00,400
He has some cat

1463
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:02,600
tendencies, but is not a cat.

1464
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:04,280
Yeah.

1465
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:07,360
Standoffish sometimes wriggles away,

1466
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:09,720
wriggles out of potentially cute situations.

1467
01:18:10,760 --> 01:18:14,880
Yeah, I was trying to think, like, is there a way to get even just a chandu

1468
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:16,800
presence in some part?

1469
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:20,400
Is it like chandu, a member of C Society of Explorers and Adventures?

1470
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:21,600
Isn't there a way?

1471
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:22,760
I, you know, I do.

1472
01:18:22,760 --> 01:18:24,080
Is Sinbad.

1473
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:26,560
Well, sure. I mean, yeah, this is the thing.

1474
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:30,120
Like I and maybe this is a more of the end of the conversation of the episode.

1475
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:33,920
But like I do like it that it's only in Japan.

1476
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
There is something really cool about this.

1477
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:37,360
Don't clone it.

1478
01:18:37,360 --> 01:18:39,440
It should just be in Japan.

1479
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:43,840
That being said, couldn't we get a little reference somewhere

1480
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:46,360
just for the big Sinbad fans?

1481
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:49,400
Yeah, just like incorporate them into the family a little more.

1482
01:18:49,880 --> 01:18:50,760
Yeah, I don't know.

1483
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:54,280
Maybe it's adventure land, like Fortune Teller machine, like we did the.

1484
01:18:54,280 --> 01:18:55,240
Yes.

1485
01:18:55,240 --> 01:18:58,040
Is there some little you just put a coin in and and

1486
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:00,320
Chandu bounces on a drum.

1487
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:01,840
Yeah, that would be something like that.

1488
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:04,200
I would love something like that, because, yeah, there's no.

1489
01:19:04,200 --> 01:19:06,080
I think really what your question, Scott,

1490
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:08,880
like the question you just posed proves there's like really probably

1491
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:12,520
not a bad Chandu moment as long as it's involving Chandu.

1492
01:19:13,960 --> 01:19:18,080
Is he tying someone up in the in the cave scene

1493
01:19:18,080 --> 01:19:20,480
where they're bringing the Uyghur? That is very cute.

1494
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:25,480
I have to say, I think I really like watching the footage of this ride

1495
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:31,760
is that scenes, stuff is set up or like stuff calls back previous scenes.

1496
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:38,920
Like when Sinbad unlocks a giant lock with a big feather from the Bird Island.

1497
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:40,640
Yeah, it's so.

1498
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:43,120
And then that's so sweet to me.

1499
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:47,920
And then you come around the corner and him and the giant Uyghur are jamming together.

1500
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:50,720
It's it's just so nice.

1501
01:19:50,720 --> 01:19:52,800
It's just so like heartwarming.

1502
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:57,080
And then later, like music is acknowledged is a big part of this, because, yeah,

1503
01:19:57,120 --> 01:20:02,560
he teaches the I think I saw it referred to as the residents of the Monkey Kingdom.

1504
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:04,800
He teaches them how to play instruments.

1505
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:08,400
He is, yes, he is spreading the song.

1506
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:13,000
He is spreading the love and the knowledge of music around and playing.

1507
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:18,600
And yes, as you said, that my favorite scene is that scene where he's playing with this Uyghur.

1508
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:25,040
And as we alluded to earlier, the animatronic feels like it's 40 feet tall.

1509
01:20:25,040 --> 01:20:26,400
I'm sure it's not.

1510
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:29,960
But in my memory, it's like the tallest thing I've ever seen.

1511
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:32,400
Yeah. And it's so great.

1512
01:20:32,440 --> 01:20:34,840
It's right by or excuse me.

1513
01:20:34,840 --> 01:20:37,920
It happens like right during that soaring part of the song as well.

1514
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:40,680
And I noticed that scene for particular.

1515
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:44,400
I would start to go like get emotional again when we rode over and over.

1516
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:48,600
Yeah. And the Uyghur's voice is so deep.

1517
01:20:49,160 --> 01:20:50,360
Yeah. Yes.

1518
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:54,800
And he said he is very deep and Sinbad is much higher.

1519
01:20:54,920 --> 01:20:57,200
But they fit together so nicely.

1520
01:20:57,200 --> 01:20:58,320
There is harmony.

1521
01:20:58,760 --> 01:21:03,800
They are such different types of beings and the power of song brings them together.

1522
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:05,120
It's so beautiful.

1523
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:12,240
This is really the core of what this redo was from this kind of abrasive ride to the friendly

1524
01:21:12,680 --> 01:21:17,880
or warming ride that we love where it's is it a giant?

1525
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:21,520
What do we call? I kept seeing it as the cave of the giant.

1526
01:21:21,880 --> 01:21:23,200
I think it's called a giant.

1527
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:25,800
I just think of him as an ogre because he's green.

1528
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:28,240
Oh, sure. Yeah.

1529
01:21:28,240 --> 01:21:33,880
I think, yeah, because he doesn't he's not like he doesn't have human form exactly.

1530
01:21:34,240 --> 01:21:39,600
And so giants, I think of as being just like big old people, people.

1531
01:21:39,640 --> 01:21:41,280
But he's not people.

1532
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:42,160
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1533
01:21:42,160 --> 01:21:45,520
Another weird and bulbous and yeah, has a particular color.

1534
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:51,040
But so he in the original one,

1535
01:21:51,160 --> 01:21:54,880
it's it is sort of the midpoint of the ride and it's this very same grand vista

1536
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:55,960
where you round a corner.

1537
01:21:55,960 --> 01:22:00,640
But in the old one, he is holding up to people like by their clothes or upside down,

1538
01:22:00,640 --> 01:22:03,480
dangling by their legs and kind of torturing them.

1539
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:06,720
Might be people who deserve it, who are trying to plunder his riches.

1540
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:10,800
Nevertheless, it was still like this is your centerpiece as a giant.

1541
01:22:11,200 --> 01:22:15,840
Oh, yeah. And then Sinbad's got his sword out and is like clearly about to go to battle

1542
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:17,480
with the giant ogre.

1543
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:22,000
That yeah, that scene with the original scene with the giant ogre,

1544
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:26,960
like with the people in his hands reminds me of the Robert Smygall Shazam cartoon

1545
01:22:27,680 --> 01:22:32,240
where Shazam is like a genie, but he's like the most mean,

1546
01:22:32,760 --> 01:22:36,360
petty, petty, like, hurts people and like,

1547
01:22:36,360 --> 01:22:42,400
there's too much like, yeah, like the could just kind of like embarrass them once,

1548
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:47,040
but instead, like, like punches them into the ground and makes them eat manure.

1549
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:53,000
And then and then punches himself because he hates himself the most.

1550
01:22:53,240 --> 01:22:56,040
Yeah, yeah. It's a it's a very funny cartoon.

1551
01:22:56,040 --> 01:23:00,720
But this it does remind me of this where I'm like, man, that that giant can like

1552
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:04,280
really do some harm to these people and like, fine, if they were bad.

1553
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:06,800
Yeah, do some like throw them over to the side.

1554
01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:10,880
They were trying to steal his treasure after just trying to steal all those bird eggs.

1555
01:23:11,200 --> 01:23:14,600
But I just picture. Yeah, I picture him like making those guys eat manure

1556
01:23:14,600 --> 01:23:20,600
after the after after the boat is cleared, then the giant does something really cruel to them.

1557
01:23:21,440 --> 01:23:24,360
Chewing them kind of as slowly as he can.

1558
01:23:24,360 --> 01:23:27,920
Like, how can I get their meat off but still keep them alive?

1559
01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:31,280
What's the slowest I can eat these people?

1560
01:23:31,280 --> 01:23:32,000
He's going to torture you.

1561
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:33,000
He seems like such a jerk.

1562
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:37,560
You know, not it's not this harmony, this song, this beautiful moment.

1563
01:23:37,560 --> 01:23:38,360
Sorry, Jason. Good.

1564
01:23:38,360 --> 01:23:41,440
Oh, I was just going to say that talking about the original version of the show

1565
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:46,480
reminds me of some stuff I pulled up of in America.

1566
01:23:46,920 --> 01:23:50,560
It is very popular every now and then to dig up

1567
01:23:51,040 --> 01:23:55,400
and do a Sinbad thing because it's extremely in the public domain.

1568
01:23:55,720 --> 01:23:59,920
And this the current version of this ride could not be further from,

1569
01:24:00,240 --> 01:24:05,840
let's say, this short lived 90 syndicated Sinbad.

1570
01:24:07,560 --> 01:24:09,400
Or is this hunk? Yeah.

1571
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:10,760
From 96.

1572
01:24:10,760 --> 01:24:11,880
I don't know.

1573
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:17,520
I also don't know who this like man who's got a real like sour look on his face.

1574
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:19,360
Oh, that's Shandu.

1575
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:21,320
That's human Shandu.

1576
01:24:21,320 --> 01:24:26,280
And then there, of course, is the 2003 Forgotten Dreamworks animated film

1577
01:24:26,280 --> 01:24:31,560
Sinbad Legend of the Seven Seas with what I am predicting is the most expensive

1578
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:34,080
voice cast I have ever seen.

1579
01:24:35,240 --> 01:24:39,360
Brad Pitt, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Michelle Pfeiffer and Joseph Fong.

1580
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:43,920
And then, of course, at Universal Florida, there was a show

1581
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:47,600
I always really liked, the Eighth Voyage of Sinbad.

1582
01:24:48,240 --> 01:24:51,040
Not a lot of merchandise from that either.

1583
01:24:51,040 --> 01:24:53,800
But I found this on eBay a while back.

1584
01:24:53,800 --> 01:24:59,680
And I kind of know if this was the logo they were going with,

1585
01:24:59,680 --> 01:25:01,920
why they didn't sell a lot of this.

1586
01:25:03,080 --> 01:25:04,840
He is ripped.

1587
01:25:04,840 --> 01:25:06,960
Yeah, it's yeah, he's jacked. Yeah.

1588
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:10,360
And mean, but like these are everyone looks mean.

1589
01:25:10,360 --> 01:25:12,400
Yeah. The female friend looks mean.

1590
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:14,120
The little guy looks mean.

1591
01:25:14,120 --> 01:25:15,840
The mean crew. Really?

1592
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:18,400
Yeah. Jason, you know, you bringing all this up.

1593
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:23,440
I also found a few different versions of Sinbad that might be of some quick interest,

1594
01:25:23,720 --> 01:25:27,280
just because, yeah, this is obviously this character has been around forever

1595
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:30,440
and been used in a lot of different ways.

1596
01:25:30,440 --> 01:25:33,840
And let me just some of the quick, quick highlights real quick here.

1597
01:25:34,480 --> 01:25:39,480
There was a Fantastic Four Sinbad crossover in 2001.

1598
01:25:39,480 --> 01:25:41,880
Chris Claremont wrote it. I have not read anything about it.

1599
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:47,160
There was something called the Freedom Force TV show in 1978,

1600
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:50,480
which had a super team, much like the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,

1601
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:54,960
with Merlin, Sinbad, Super Samurai, Isis and Hercules.

1602
01:25:56,720 --> 01:25:58,480
And then one of my favorite.

1603
01:25:58,480 --> 01:26:00,920
We're going to get the we're going to get a really expensive,

1604
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:05,040
really miserable movie out of this six years.

1605
01:26:05,640 --> 01:26:08,600
Yes. And then one of my favorite topics,

1606
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,400
junkie Anna Barbera cartoons.

1607
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:15,080
There was something called Sinbad Junior and his magic belt.

1608
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:19,360
And I'll just play a little just a snippet of this.

1609
01:26:28,360 --> 01:26:29,480
What that?

1610
01:26:29,560 --> 01:26:30,320
OK.

1611
01:26:37,720 --> 01:26:40,920
So, yes, Sinbad is Sinbad Junior is white.

1612
01:26:42,440 --> 01:26:46,400
And he has a he has a character named Salty the Parrot, which is a sidekick,

1613
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:50,920
which is, of course, Mary Oceaneer's parrot sidekick's name in

1614
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:52,920
See, the Society of Explorers and Adventures.

1615
01:26:54,440 --> 01:26:55,520
So I don't know.

1616
01:26:55,520 --> 01:26:58,320
They ripped. Disney ripped off Hannah Barbera

1617
01:26:59,200 --> 01:27:01,960
with a very classic show that everyone knows.

1618
01:27:01,960 --> 01:27:03,840
Sinbad Junior and his magic belt.

1619
01:27:03,840 --> 01:27:07,880
I think he just set off a corporate corporate war by stating that.

1620
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:10,240
Yeah, I did. Yeah.

1621
01:27:10,240 --> 01:27:12,800
It's funny you mentioned Adam Barbera, because I was convinced

1622
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:17,760
there was a Fox Kids or an ABC Morning Sinbad cartoon.

1623
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:22,000
And then I I looked and what I was thinking of was a Hannah Barbera

1624
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:26,000
cartoon from 1991 called The Pirates of Dark Water.

1625
01:27:26,600 --> 01:27:31,240
If you recall that area, yeah, which remember that features a character

1626
01:27:31,240 --> 01:27:35,680
named Niddler voice in the miniseries

1627
01:27:36,160 --> 01:27:40,480
premier by Roddy McDowell and later in the show by Frank Welker.

1628
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:42,040
Oh, wow.

1629
01:27:42,680 --> 01:27:44,720
Jodie Benson's in this.

1630
01:27:44,720 --> 01:27:46,240
What's that little mermaid herself?

1631
01:27:46,240 --> 01:27:48,320
Jodie Benson is on this show.

1632
01:27:48,320 --> 01:27:51,000
I believe so. Yeah. As Tula.

1633
01:27:52,160 --> 01:27:53,040
That's interesting.

1634
01:27:53,040 --> 01:27:55,800
I have to I was about to say I have to go back and watch that.

1635
01:27:55,800 --> 01:27:57,760
But you know what? I don't.

1636
01:27:57,760 --> 01:27:59,120
The designs.

1637
01:27:59,120 --> 01:28:02,000
And Conk and the Lug Brothers.

1638
01:28:02,840 --> 01:28:03,400
You know what?

1639
01:28:03,400 --> 01:28:07,320
I think it's really good to draw the line.

1640
01:28:07,920 --> 01:28:11,840
I think like we don't have to watch everything.

1641
01:28:12,520 --> 01:28:14,640
We can be discerning.

1642
01:28:14,640 --> 01:28:17,960
A plea from the person who lives with Mike to Mike.

1643
01:28:18,280 --> 01:28:21,360
Oh, I'm the one who watches things.

1644
01:28:21,360 --> 01:28:22,960
I'm the watcher in the house.

1645
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:24,720
She is the watcher in the house.

1646
01:28:24,720 --> 01:28:27,200
I am the collector. I'm Tana Lear to Vaughn.

1647
01:28:27,720 --> 01:28:31,040
She is watching the watcher.

1648
01:28:31,040 --> 01:28:33,960
And I'm Tana Lear to Vaughn to use Marvel characters.

1649
01:28:35,320 --> 01:28:37,720
Yes. Can I quick?

1650
01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:40,720
Let me make a point about the ride and the changeover.

1651
01:28:40,760 --> 01:28:46,160
I feel like there's I'm sure there's, you know, a good way to do a Sinbad ride

1652
01:28:46,160 --> 01:28:48,520
that's scary and more like the original stories.

1653
01:28:48,920 --> 01:28:53,080
But I don't think it's like a small world, slow moving boat ride.

1654
01:28:53,320 --> 01:28:56,320
That is, I think, where they went wrong, where it's like you want to do

1655
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:57,760
something like scary and intense.

1656
01:28:57,840 --> 01:29:02,120
I think the ride system needs to be a little bit more intense as well.

1657
01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:03,320
You know what I'm saying?

1658
01:29:03,320 --> 01:29:07,320
Like, yeah, if you've just got a dark ride, but it's not a ride,

1659
01:29:07,480 --> 01:29:11,000
it's like you're just watching these intense adventures

1660
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,680
instead of feeling like you're in the experience.

1661
01:29:14,160 --> 01:29:17,560
Yeah. And it's a mix of, I think, the slower moving ride

1662
01:29:17,560 --> 01:29:21,880
plus the small world style doll animatronics.

1663
01:29:21,880 --> 01:29:26,720
Like if it was fully pirates level, like human sized animatronics

1664
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:28,200
mixed with a slow moving boat, right.

1665
01:29:28,200 --> 01:29:29,760
I think that's a different story.

1666
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:32,280
We might be going, there's this very cool Sinbad ride

1667
01:29:32,280 --> 01:29:35,000
that's dark and creepy that's in Tokyo.

1668
01:29:35,240 --> 01:29:39,960
But I think that is why the first version of it really didn't work so well.

1669
01:29:40,920 --> 01:29:43,800
We associate boats with relaxation

1670
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:48,600
and maybe even with cuteness or at least niceness.

1671
01:29:48,920 --> 01:29:52,360
But if it was like, even if it was a haunted mansion style,

1672
01:29:52,360 --> 01:29:57,360
it can be slow and scary, but it can't be a slow boat and scary.

1673
01:29:57,880 --> 01:29:59,120
Yes, that's what I think.

1674
01:29:59,120 --> 01:30:03,440
I mean, I can't think of anything that's contradicting what I'm saying that works.

1675
01:30:03,440 --> 01:30:05,240
But like, I feel like that's what it is.

1676
01:30:05,240 --> 01:30:09,680
It could be a slow boat, then where there's a big drop or something

1677
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:13,080
that's all building to something bad happening.

1678
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:14,200
Right. That's OK.

1679
01:30:14,200 --> 01:30:17,800
But like, but maybe that original ride had this air of malice.

1680
01:30:18,040 --> 01:30:21,760
Like we're going into worse and worse places and more dangerous situations,

1681
01:30:21,960 --> 01:30:24,440
but then it's not building to a drop or something.

1682
01:30:24,760 --> 01:30:26,600
Right. Exactly.

1683
01:30:26,600 --> 01:30:30,480
Like if you took if you took like Small World and you like put

1684
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:35,480
like a weird like took the song away and then made it like it would immediately

1685
01:30:35,480 --> 01:30:38,640
be weirder because they're like dolls and toys.

1686
01:30:39,560 --> 01:30:43,000
I mean, it's already a weird ride that we all like.

1687
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:44,960
But yeah, if you took the song away

1688
01:30:44,960 --> 01:30:48,600
and put this original Sinbad song in there, it would be odd.

1689
01:30:49,320 --> 01:30:49,920
It would be odd.

1690
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:54,120
Or like, if you know those things where you take out a sitcom's laugh track

1691
01:30:54,120 --> 01:30:58,160
or something, if you just like hit every sound effect and there was no song

1692
01:30:58,160 --> 01:31:00,600
and just a bunch of mood drastically.

1693
01:31:00,600 --> 01:31:01,880
Right. Yeah.

1694
01:31:01,880 --> 01:31:07,080
Well, then you then what you've got is the gripping film Escape from Tomorrow.

1695
01:31:07,640 --> 01:31:10,080
They finally. Oh, man.

1696
01:31:10,080 --> 01:31:13,120
Small World is twisted, man.

1697
01:31:13,120 --> 01:31:17,000
Yeah, that's right.

1698
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:20,640
It's hard to tell if I like Dismaland better or Escape from Tomorrow.

1699
01:31:21,520 --> 01:31:23,960
I'm always doing that sort of battle in my head.

1700
01:31:24,760 --> 01:31:26,280
Which one is more outrageous?

1701
01:31:26,280 --> 01:31:28,160
Which one more like cuts to the core?

1702
01:31:28,160 --> 01:31:30,720
Which one really gets to the truth of the matter?

1703
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:33,160
It makes a question that we like this stuff.

1704
01:31:33,160 --> 01:31:34,640
Like, have you ever thought about that?

1705
01:31:34,640 --> 01:31:36,760
It's all a bunch of like

1706
01:31:36,760 --> 01:31:40,120
just like corporate crap shoved into our brains.

1707
01:31:40,360 --> 01:31:47,240
We're being fed, thought stew by a corporation by head chef Mickey Mouse.

1708
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:53,760
Who was like, you know, wall was like wall, like literally

1709
01:31:53,760 --> 01:31:57,840
what like did hate crimes, he was like the worst man.

1710
01:31:58,600 --> 01:31:59,840
And he's frozen.

1711
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:01,880
He's frozen. And he's frozen.

1712
01:32:01,880 --> 01:32:05,320
You know, he's got a head is frozen.

1713
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:08,720
It's like under the gets deep under the castle.

1714
01:32:08,720 --> 01:32:11,320
It's hundreds of feet under the castle.

1715
01:32:11,320 --> 01:32:13,880
And he like friends with Hitler, too.

1716
01:32:13,880 --> 01:32:16,120
Like he was he was like a doll.

1717
01:32:16,120 --> 01:32:17,760
The room when a lot of that happened.

1718
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:21,680
Also, I'm 14 and I just discovered the concept

1719
01:32:21,680 --> 01:32:23,960
that like adults don't always have the answers.

1720
01:32:26,120 --> 01:32:29,080
I just download a bunch of Bill Hicks, MP3s.

1721
01:32:29,960 --> 01:32:32,240
It's really it's all making me think, man.

1722
01:32:32,240 --> 01:32:34,760
I have a stepdad now and it's changed everything.

1723
01:32:35,640 --> 01:32:36,840
My yes, you know what?

1724
01:32:36,840 --> 01:32:39,400
If I really think about it, my complaint with this, all this stuff

1725
01:32:39,680 --> 01:32:43,080
is that these people don't know Disney well enough to know exactly

1726
01:32:43,080 --> 01:32:45,400
what to make fun of and think is bad.

1727
01:32:45,680 --> 01:32:49,080
They yeah, they're they need.

1728
01:32:49,440 --> 01:32:51,080
They need to listen to the podcast.

1729
01:32:51,080 --> 01:32:53,960
They need to hear from us if they want to do their real awesome

1730
01:32:53,960 --> 01:32:55,800
piece of satire, you know.

1731
01:32:55,800 --> 01:32:58,280
Yeah, that's what like I'm really most.

1732
01:32:58,280 --> 01:33:03,120
I'm really most upset with them just not knowing a lot like like not proper

1733
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:07,800
ride maintenance or that actually what was a little too chummy

1734
01:33:07,800 --> 01:33:09,200
with Lenny Reif and stall.

1735
01:33:09,200 --> 01:33:14,200
But, you know, mostly let's get a union busting.

1736
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:16,280
Yeah, the real stuff.

1737
01:33:16,280 --> 01:33:17,840
And head. Yeah.

1738
01:33:17,840 --> 01:33:20,880
Yeah. Saying these are not these are the surface level pair.

1739
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:24,600
Say they're the real stuff and then you can use that tone.

1740
01:33:24,600 --> 01:33:26,000
Yeah. And then we'll talk.

1741
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:27,760
Yes. Then we'll talk.

1742
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:29,720
I mean, we won't talk. I don't want to.

1743
01:33:29,720 --> 01:33:31,720
I don't want to talk to you.

1744
01:33:31,720 --> 01:33:33,400
Any of these people.

1745
01:33:33,400 --> 01:33:34,520
We already know this.

1746
01:33:34,520 --> 01:33:37,880
Much like you find it out and then talk about yourselves.

1747
01:33:38,120 --> 01:33:41,160
Please don't say the phrase NFTs to me.

1748
01:33:42,560 --> 01:33:45,880
Yeah, I'm checked out on the whole thing. Absolutely.

1749
01:33:46,760 --> 01:33:50,080
I think maybe the one place that we haven't super visited

1750
01:33:50,360 --> 01:33:52,640
is the land of the monkeys,

1751
01:33:53,320 --> 01:33:58,560
which is also a pretty dramatic shift from the original to the current one.

1752
01:33:58,720 --> 01:34:02,240
Where OK, I think we all agree that this is maybe the most out of place

1753
01:34:02,240 --> 01:34:03,760
and the one where you feel the most like, all right,

1754
01:34:03,760 --> 01:34:06,280
so you feel the old ride in this one.

1755
01:34:06,480 --> 01:34:09,280
It is a happy scene, but the song stops.

1756
01:34:09,280 --> 01:34:12,560
We go into like a full percussive jam

1757
01:34:12,840 --> 01:34:16,960
and the monkeys are all mostly like drumming

1758
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:19,280
and banging on stuff and shaking sticks.

1759
01:34:19,560 --> 01:34:22,480
And it's fun in the original.

1760
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:25,040
They are bloodthirsty.

1761
01:34:25,400 --> 01:34:28,160
They want their terrifying you in the boat.

1762
01:34:28,160 --> 01:34:30,880
They're the first characters you feel like notice you

1763
01:34:30,880 --> 01:34:34,240
and they want to pounce on you and put holes in your neck.

1764
01:34:34,240 --> 01:34:36,560
It's really they're so crazy.

1765
01:34:36,560 --> 01:34:38,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1766
01:34:38,720 --> 01:34:40,840
Oh, God, the monkeys have seen us.

1767
01:34:40,840 --> 01:34:43,240
It's really then they like it.

1768
01:34:43,240 --> 01:34:45,240
This is a little creepy.

1769
01:34:45,240 --> 01:34:48,880
The sullen teens we were just impersonating might think this is weird

1770
01:34:48,880 --> 01:34:49,760
that they do.

1771
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:53,080
They kept all the monkeys the same, but they switched them from like

1772
01:34:53,800 --> 01:34:57,560
howling, scary faces to big old smiles.

1773
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,960
And I think successfully, I think the monkeys are kind of lovable,

1774
01:35:00,960 --> 01:35:02,600
but they're pretty cute.

1775
01:35:02,600 --> 01:35:03,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1776
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:07,880
But boy, that monkey sequence, I was genuinely scary.

1777
01:35:07,880 --> 01:35:10,040
It's just like we was nuts.

1778
01:35:10,040 --> 01:35:11,760
All the monkeys mad at you.

1779
01:35:11,760 --> 01:35:15,480
I was reading that like part of the reason they changed is because children

1780
01:35:15,480 --> 01:35:16,160
were scared.

1781
01:35:16,160 --> 01:35:18,760
And so I'm watching the original ride through and I was like,

1782
01:35:19,360 --> 01:35:25,040
I guess is it like the fact that the like the giant ogre is big or something?

1783
01:35:25,320 --> 01:35:26,520
I guess I see it.

1784
01:35:26,520 --> 01:35:29,280
And then it gets to the monkeys and I was like, oh, no, thank you.

1785
01:35:30,480 --> 01:35:31,520
None for me.

1786
01:35:31,520 --> 01:35:33,400
I don't like these monkeys at all.

1787
01:35:33,400 --> 01:35:34,400
They're scary.

1788
01:35:35,280 --> 01:35:36,920
Yeah, yeah, not to redeem.

1789
01:35:36,920 --> 01:35:40,400
If we had all grown up in Japan, we'd be all of our podcasts would be about

1790
01:35:40,400 --> 01:35:41,800
being freaked out by these monkeys.

1791
01:35:41,800 --> 01:35:42,800
Yeah.

1792
01:35:45,080 --> 01:35:48,880
In the new one, though, you know what I really like in this sequence is how

1793
01:35:49,360 --> 01:35:53,520
Sinbad has a pretty jaunty, fun air for the most part.

1794
01:35:53,760 --> 01:35:58,640
And I think the most serious he is anywhere in the ride is banging on

1795
01:35:59,400 --> 01:36:00,960
drums with the monkeys.

1796
01:36:01,120 --> 01:36:02,640
He is so focused.

1797
01:36:02,800 --> 01:36:05,320
He is taking this jam seriously.

1798
01:36:06,080 --> 01:36:08,600
Very serious about his music.

1799
01:36:08,600 --> 01:36:10,480
Yeah, he's no Mark McGrath.

1800
01:36:10,480 --> 01:36:13,520
He doesn't have self-awareness.

1801
01:36:13,520 --> 01:36:16,800
He is there for the craft and there is no down.

1802
01:36:16,920 --> 01:36:17,360
He's a shoegator.

1803
01:36:17,360 --> 01:36:19,080
There's no pattern.

1804
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:21,240
No, no, no.

1805
01:36:21,240 --> 01:36:22,560
Keep it down. I'm working.

1806
01:36:22,560 --> 01:36:26,320
Mm hmm. Yeah, maybe that's not one of his main instruments either.

1807
01:36:26,320 --> 01:36:29,960
Maybe that's one where he has to focus a little bit more like our mandolin.

1808
01:36:29,960 --> 01:36:34,040
Now, yeah, yeah, he can kind of do whatever while he's playing those.

1809
01:36:34,040 --> 01:36:37,240
But this one, he has to really sit and keep keeping time with the beat.

1810
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:42,360
Yeah. Like if someone asked Sinbad, Sinbad, can you play drums?

1811
01:36:42,640 --> 01:36:45,800
The response would be, I can.

1812
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:52,280
But, you know, like he's like, I'm just I'm warning you now.

1813
01:36:52,280 --> 01:36:55,880
You know, it's not the first instrument I learned.

1814
01:36:55,880 --> 01:36:59,480
Like I just picked it up like maybe like six months ago.

1815
01:37:00,360 --> 01:37:01,560
Right. Yes.

1816
01:37:01,560 --> 01:37:03,840
Yeah. If we're just having fun, it's fine.

1817
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:06,200
If we're just having fun, but if we're putting down tracks,

1818
01:37:07,080 --> 01:37:08,200
you might want to call someone else.

1819
01:37:08,200 --> 01:37:10,000
Should do it. Yeah, someone else should do it.

1820
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:11,000
In the wrecking crew.

1821
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,200
Don't like, yeah, I'll jam, but yeah.

1822
01:37:15,440 --> 01:37:18,360
There's a quick I don't know, maybe that maybe I'm crazy about this.

1823
01:37:18,360 --> 01:37:21,880
If you were to sort of take the one at some of the animatronics of Sinbad,

1824
01:37:22,120 --> 01:37:26,040
does he look a little bit like some of these like directed DVD Pinocchio's?

1825
01:37:27,160 --> 01:37:31,000
Yeah. Oh, like a little bit like the Jonathan Taylor Thomas one.

1826
01:37:31,120 --> 01:37:34,160
Yeah, a little bit Disney style. It's like.

1827
01:37:35,560 --> 01:37:39,560
Yeah, it's like capitalizing off Disney releases.

1828
01:37:40,200 --> 01:37:43,320
Yeah. Maybe it's just because he's a small animatronic

1829
01:37:43,320 --> 01:37:47,000
and I'm thinking of Pinocchio, but if we didn't like him

1830
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,240
and we didn't like the song and everything surrounding it,

1831
01:37:49,240 --> 01:37:54,520
would we say he was like almost getting into like ventriloquist dummy territory?

1832
01:37:54,520 --> 01:37:57,240
And not really. Not that I wouldn't necessarily go that far.

1833
01:37:57,240 --> 01:37:59,040
But you know what I mean? He's like. It's in the family.

1834
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:02,360
I mean, that small world dolls are in the family of ventriloquists.

1835
01:38:03,360 --> 01:38:04,320
Yeah. Yeah.

1836
01:38:04,320 --> 01:38:11,480
So I think comparing it to like knock off straight to DVD releases is very accurate.

1837
01:38:11,640 --> 01:38:17,000
I think that's a fair assessment of the art style of the animatronics.

1838
01:38:17,440 --> 01:38:20,840
Yeah, it's not fully like Roberto Benigni Pinocchio boy,

1839
01:38:21,680 --> 01:38:25,160
but it's it's yeah, there again. Yeah, it's close. It's close.

1840
01:38:25,160 --> 01:38:28,800
But that's it's flirting with that. Sure. Sure.

1841
01:38:29,160 --> 01:38:31,680
But I think it makes it through. Yeah.

1842
01:38:31,680 --> 01:38:34,000
Oh, you still end up you still end up loving the guy.

1843
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:37,680
It's weird that we aren't more creeped out by the the animatronic style.

1844
01:38:37,680 --> 01:38:41,160
Like this would be prime to be a little like scary.

1845
01:38:41,160 --> 01:38:44,600
But I think we love all his friends and neighbors. Yeah. Yeah.

1846
01:38:44,880 --> 01:38:50,040
Yeah. And all the other creatures like there at the end, there's the it's a whale right at the end.

1847
01:38:50,720 --> 01:38:53,280
I believe so. Yeah. Yeah. And that's cute.

1848
01:38:53,600 --> 01:38:57,400
That's cute. And it's it was sort of unbelievable to me.

1849
01:38:57,640 --> 01:39:00,640
I thought it was just going to be the silhouette.

1850
01:39:00,640 --> 01:39:03,320
And then you round the corner and they do it to you again.

1851
01:39:03,320 --> 01:39:08,880
You turn the corner and on your right hand side is a massive thing.

1852
01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:12,320
And it's like, I can't believe in America.

1853
01:39:12,720 --> 01:39:17,640
I feel like the the money people would just be like, you got it once.

1854
01:39:18,240 --> 01:39:20,720
Do we have to we have the second one?

1855
01:39:20,720 --> 01:39:25,720
We gave you got King Kong at the end, can't the recipe screens?

1856
01:39:27,040 --> 01:39:30,040
But here it's twice. It's unbelievable.

1857
01:39:30,680 --> 01:39:36,760
Yeah. That's one where I was watching the video and going like, this is this is grander in person.

1858
01:39:36,760 --> 01:39:41,240
I feel I think like, yeah, I think the darker the lighting is in a ride video,

1859
01:39:41,240 --> 01:39:42,560
the less it translates.

1860
01:39:42,560 --> 01:39:45,920
And this I just remember that room being super magical.

1861
01:39:45,920 --> 01:39:48,440
And it's kind of the last big thing before you return home.

1862
01:39:48,600 --> 01:39:51,400
But then the home, there's so much going on at home, too.

1863
01:39:51,400 --> 01:39:53,680
Like you're you're scarcely done after the whale.

1864
01:39:53,800 --> 01:39:55,560
It's still so. Yeah.

1865
01:39:55,560 --> 01:40:00,400
It's like I wish I had taken a notepad on the ride with me for when we eventually did this episode,

1866
01:40:00,400 --> 01:40:07,840
because, yeah, you can't in the ride views, you the ride throughs, you can't like see every it's like there's so much stuff going on.

1867
01:40:08,240 --> 01:40:12,200
And there's little details I'm sure we're missing that are very nice.

1868
01:40:12,200 --> 01:40:20,080
But, Jason, when you go to Tokyo soon, you know, you will have to point out that stuff that we've missed.

1869
01:40:21,040 --> 01:40:27,240
But yeah, I mean, they just shut down some theme parks there in some cities.

1870
01:40:27,240 --> 01:40:30,280
I don't think Tokyo, Disney, but Universal.

1871
01:40:30,280 --> 01:40:31,600
I'd say tomorrow.

1872
01:40:31,600 --> 01:40:34,000
No, no. But hopefully.

1873
01:40:34,960 --> 01:40:36,760
I'm just trying to get them to break the rule.

1874
01:40:36,760 --> 01:40:39,800
I think the intention was to save a lot of Tokyo until we all did it.

1875
01:40:39,800 --> 01:40:45,360
But like now, like there was a world where you you might have gone, you know, in 2020 or 2021.

1876
01:40:45,360 --> 01:40:47,040
But obviously, that hasn't worked out.

1877
01:40:47,040 --> 01:40:49,680
And yeah, I hope you get the shot.

1878
01:40:49,800 --> 01:40:51,840
Oh, for sure. Yeah.

1879
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:53,320
Now that you have the shots. Yeah.

1880
01:40:53,320 --> 01:40:54,840
I phrase that on. Right.

1881
01:40:54,840 --> 01:40:57,080
But I mean, it worked since August. Yeah.

1882
01:40:57,960 --> 01:40:59,520
Yes, it's August. Yes.

1883
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:02,040
Yeah, we all have for a long time.

1884
01:41:02,040 --> 01:41:06,600
The last scene is what you know, I think I declared this, I don't know in what ride.

1885
01:41:06,600 --> 01:41:11,080
But I think one of these little theme park recurring things that I've decided

1886
01:41:11,080 --> 01:41:13,280
I like is indoor fireworks.

1887
01:41:13,280 --> 01:41:16,280
I really like fireworks up on the ceiling in any case.

1888
01:41:16,280 --> 01:41:18,880
I, you know, in the Mexico ride and Epcot.

1889
01:41:19,080 --> 01:41:21,360
And there's so many here.

1890
01:41:21,360 --> 01:41:23,880
The return home is so great.

1891
01:41:24,520 --> 01:41:27,680
And then it's yours back to like that good luck on your journey.

1892
01:41:27,680 --> 01:41:29,880
And then how was your journey? Good.

1893
01:41:29,920 --> 01:41:31,240
Oh, wonderful.

1894
01:41:31,240 --> 01:41:32,040
Glad to hear it.

1895
01:41:32,040 --> 01:41:36,440
I think it's funny that when he gets back, they're like, congratulations.

1896
01:41:36,600 --> 01:41:37,440
I.

1897
01:41:38,880 --> 01:41:39,600
On what?

1898
01:41:39,600 --> 01:41:43,800
I would say that no matter what happened, even if he didn't rescue some some bird.

1899
01:41:44,080 --> 01:41:45,000
He could have come back

1900
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:49,040
with a totally empty handed and they would have been like, well, those hands are full of friendship.

1901
01:41:49,040 --> 01:41:51,440
Congratulations.

1902
01:41:52,960 --> 01:41:55,560
That's right. This town loves each other.

1903
01:41:55,600 --> 01:41:57,600
And it's wonderful.

1904
01:41:58,080 --> 01:42:02,120
I yeah, it's it's just it's so grand.

1905
01:42:02,200 --> 01:42:05,840
Like how much of it is back in his town and it's all still it's all memorable

1906
01:42:05,840 --> 01:42:10,720
and compelling and I and boy, so long.

1907
01:42:10,760 --> 01:42:14,520
That is really the benefit of the boat ride that they can just go and go.

1908
01:42:14,520 --> 01:42:16,160
Yeah. And you don't get tired of it.

1909
01:42:16,480 --> 01:42:19,400
Mm hmm. And yeah, it's the boat ride.

1910
01:42:19,560 --> 01:42:24,440
Yeah. The nice thing about your small, the slow moving boat ride is you can pack stuff in

1911
01:42:24,800 --> 01:42:28,480
to be seen because it's not going to like you won't be like, well, they're going too fast

1912
01:42:28,480 --> 01:42:31,280
to be able to pay attention to all these details.

1913
01:42:32,560 --> 01:42:33,160
Yeah.

1914
01:42:33,160 --> 01:42:36,520
Well, I mean, what have we not called out?

1915
01:42:36,520 --> 01:42:38,960
Are there other details that we've that we've missed?

1916
01:42:40,360 --> 01:42:42,760
I mean, yeah, there's a there's a scene we didn't really talk about

1917
01:42:42,760 --> 01:42:46,680
that just seems to be like a nice exchange of vases

1918
01:42:47,680 --> 01:42:50,080
in him and a, you know, Sultan.

1919
01:42:50,080 --> 01:42:52,320
They just kind of like, here you go.

1920
01:42:52,320 --> 01:42:53,120
Good to meet you.

1921
01:42:53,120 --> 01:42:56,000
It's not like as dramatic as the bird one.

1922
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:59,080
But in the original, right, I read that that was

1923
01:42:59,920 --> 01:43:05,120
that character was warning Sinbad about the dangers to come

1924
01:43:07,240 --> 01:43:09,880
with the monkeys because the monkeys are next.

1925
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:10,640
Right, right.

1926
01:43:10,640 --> 01:43:12,960
So that character is like, beware, there are

1927
01:43:14,040 --> 01:43:18,320
scary creatures and you're heading into the unknown.

1928
01:43:18,320 --> 01:43:20,440
And then monkeys.

1929
01:43:20,440 --> 01:43:22,480
And then it like gives him time to form a plan.

1930
01:43:22,480 --> 01:43:27,040
Yeah. And instead, in this one, it's like, hey, Vase, teach me this song.

1931
01:43:27,920 --> 01:43:31,960
We want to just absolutely fill your boat with treasures.

1932
01:43:33,320 --> 01:43:35,040
Just everywhere he goes there.

1933
01:43:35,040 --> 01:43:38,160
The monkeys, by the end of hanging out with the monkeys

1934
01:43:38,160 --> 01:43:41,080
and teaching the monkeys the song, they're like, take

1935
01:43:41,680 --> 01:43:45,920
the biggest boatload of bananas you've ever seen in your life.

1936
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:49,000
That's how much we appreciate our time with you.

1937
01:43:49,680 --> 01:43:52,120
To the point where when I was rewatching it, I was like.

1938
01:43:53,120 --> 01:43:57,200
Did they bring bananas to the monkeys?

1939
01:43:57,200 --> 01:44:01,680
No, the monkeys are giving them a boatload of bananas

1940
01:44:02,480 --> 01:44:05,040
out of the goodness of their heart.

1941
01:44:05,040 --> 01:44:07,320
That one hadn't occurred to me. That's wonderful.

1942
01:44:07,320 --> 01:44:09,400
That is nice. And I do get to a ton.

1943
01:44:09,400 --> 01:44:10,360
He gets that.

1944
01:44:10,360 --> 01:44:13,480
I was about to say, I really like the look of the fake bananas, too,

1945
01:44:13,480 --> 01:44:15,320
before we started talking.

1946
01:44:15,320 --> 01:44:15,960
Yes.

1947
01:44:15,960 --> 01:44:18,120
They say like, you know, those fake bananas look great.

1948
01:44:18,120 --> 01:44:21,960
Something fake fruit on rides, I'm sure like not always like.

1949
01:44:22,200 --> 01:44:24,760
Attracted to the fruit like I am to these bananas.

1950
01:44:25,560 --> 01:44:29,800
I found these bananas might be a good if we're if we're doing fake final fours.

1951
01:44:30,160 --> 01:44:31,320
That's an interesting one.

1952
01:44:31,320 --> 01:44:33,400
What's food on a ride?

1953
01:44:33,400 --> 01:44:34,920
Noted. Oh, yeah.

1954
01:44:34,920 --> 01:44:37,880
Oh, Horizon says all that future food in it.

1955
01:44:37,880 --> 01:44:40,200
All those combo fruits.

1956
01:44:40,200 --> 01:44:43,960
Yeah. And then there's a gingerbread house on Mansion Holiday.

1957
01:44:44,520 --> 01:44:48,520
Yeah. Rare thing that was in the smell and then it can be in the food.

1958
01:44:48,520 --> 01:44:50,440
We may have it. I think you guys got to do it.

1959
01:44:50,920 --> 01:44:51,960
That's pretty good. Yeah.

1960
01:44:51,960 --> 01:44:54,600
One. So I don't know why fake is always part of it, but.

1961
01:44:55,960 --> 01:44:56,840
I like it.

1962
01:44:56,840 --> 01:44:57,960
It's the artistry.

1963
01:44:59,400 --> 01:44:59,720
Yes.

1964
01:44:59,720 --> 01:45:00,120
The art.

1965
01:45:00,120 --> 01:45:02,600
Admiring the craft. You're praising the craft.

1966
01:45:03,160 --> 01:45:04,040
Absolutely. Yeah.

1967
01:45:05,160 --> 01:45:10,760
Well, I mean, if that brings us sort of around the bend and the journey's ending.

1968
01:45:10,760 --> 01:45:12,200
Yeah, that is the question.

1969
01:45:12,200 --> 01:45:20,120
If like in some bizarre version of events where they add a bunch of extra Disneyland

1970
01:45:20,120 --> 01:45:25,480
or California Adventure over where there's hotel parking currently and like, why not?

1971
01:45:25,480 --> 01:45:26,680
You know what? We have the space.

1972
01:45:26,680 --> 01:45:29,240
Let's put let's let's do Sinbad.

1973
01:45:29,800 --> 01:45:31,400
Maybe America will like it.

1974
01:45:31,400 --> 01:45:35,720
I can't see this happening, but would you be happy because you can go to whenever you want?

1975
01:45:35,720 --> 01:45:37,480
Or would it be less special in a way?

1976
01:45:38,280 --> 01:45:41,880
It would be less special, but I'm not.

1977
01:45:41,880 --> 01:45:44,200
If it was the same ride, I couldn't be mad.

1978
01:45:44,840 --> 01:45:48,120
Yeah. And I think it would be too elitist

1979
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,720
to be like, no, don't bring it here.

1980
01:45:51,720 --> 01:45:55,560
People should have to go to Tokyo to experience it.

1981
01:45:55,560 --> 01:45:57,640
It's like, well, not everyone can go to Tokyo.

1982
01:45:58,680 --> 01:46:06,600
Let the people know the glory of Sinbad and become acquainted with the compasses of their hearts.

1983
01:46:07,800 --> 01:46:08,520
Yes, exactly.

1984
01:46:08,520 --> 01:46:08,920
Yeah.

1985
01:46:08,920 --> 01:46:11,000
That's more important when it comes down to it.

1986
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:17,160
Much like Sinbad travels the world, the Sinbad ride should travel the world and teach more people

1987
01:46:17,160 --> 01:46:17,640
this song.

1988
01:46:18,280 --> 01:46:19,000
I agree.

1989
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:22,520
And there's some truly fucked vibes in parts of Orange County.

1990
01:46:22,520 --> 01:46:28,520
And I think if they all could learn about the compass of your heart and the true treasure

1991
01:46:28,520 --> 01:46:30,280
of friendship, like that might help.

1992
01:46:30,920 --> 01:46:31,160
Yeah.

1993
01:46:31,160 --> 01:46:33,720
I don't know, help some people chill.

1994
01:46:33,720 --> 01:46:36,040
Get that Aryan nation on into Sinbad.

1995
01:46:36,040 --> 01:46:37,880
And I think they're going to shape right up.

1996
01:46:39,560 --> 01:46:45,400
I think it's a heartwarming story of like American and Japanese imagineers coming together

1997
01:46:45,400 --> 01:46:52,280
with a great musical talent of our time to tell a folktale of Arabian and Persian origin.

1998
01:46:52,920 --> 01:47:00,120
And yeah, I'm assuming they would think that too, you know, some of the weirdos in Orange County.

1999
01:47:00,120 --> 01:47:01,880
Maybe we could at least get to the children.

2000
01:47:02,600 --> 01:47:02,840
Yeah.

2001
01:47:03,720 --> 01:47:08,360
I'm just imagining, like all the things that are bothering us in the recent worlds,

2002
01:47:08,360 --> 01:47:14,360
like that you see like up and off in the distance, you see like a Q save the children rally,

2003
01:47:14,360 --> 01:47:18,120
and then you round the corner and everybody's dropped their signs and they're just,

2004
01:47:18,760 --> 01:47:20,360
and they're singing with Sinbad.

2005
01:47:21,560 --> 01:47:24,920
We'll be amazed at the movement of the animatronics,

2006
01:47:24,920 --> 01:47:29,480
like hitting their palms against their foreheads going, I can't believe I was that foolish.

2007
01:47:29,480 --> 01:47:30,520
What was I thinking?

2008
01:47:32,280 --> 01:47:38,360
Sinbad is personally texting people's like mothers and uncles and aunts.

2009
01:47:39,080 --> 01:47:41,800
Like, here's why, here's the proof that it's wrong.

2010
01:47:41,800 --> 01:47:44,280
Mr. Watson, Mr. Watson, it's wrong.

2011
01:47:44,840 --> 01:47:49,320
Here's a scene of Sinbad having a conversation with his family off Facebook.

2012
01:47:53,960 --> 01:47:55,640
Wow. Sinbad needs to tour.

2013
01:47:55,640 --> 01:47:57,320
Sinbad needs to go everywhere, I guess.

2014
01:47:58,200 --> 01:47:58,760
Yeah.

2015
01:47:58,760 --> 01:48:01,800
Every state put a Sinbad ride in every city.

2016
01:48:03,320 --> 01:48:03,880
Wow.

2017
01:48:03,880 --> 01:48:06,200
Yes. Okay. I've been sold on that. Nevermind.

2018
01:48:07,640 --> 01:48:12,360
Yeah. Yeah. I actually know what needs to happen is that yes, a separate ride is built in every

2019
01:48:12,440 --> 01:48:14,760
state, a freestanding Sinbad ride.

2020
01:48:14,760 --> 01:48:15,800
It's its own park now.

2021
01:48:15,800 --> 01:48:17,400
I think before you know it. Yeah.

2022
01:48:17,400 --> 01:48:18,120
Yeah. Yeah.

2023
01:48:18,120 --> 01:48:18,920
It's an embassy.

2024
01:48:21,160 --> 01:48:22,760
Sinbad embassy.

2025
01:48:22,760 --> 01:48:26,920
And it's like, there's four Sinbad rides in each embassy, the same ride, exact ride.

2026
01:48:26,920 --> 01:48:31,880
But yeah, you build one at just like, without telling him, build it

2027
01:48:31,880 --> 01:48:35,240
somewhere on the grounds of Mar-a-Lago. There's plenty of space.

2028
01:48:35,240 --> 01:48:35,560
Oh yeah.

2029
01:48:35,560 --> 01:48:41,800
And then Trump goes on at once and now he's like offering heaps of bananas to everyone he encounters.

2030
01:48:42,840 --> 01:48:45,320
He's the most generous man now.

2031
01:48:45,320 --> 01:48:49,400
What a world. Can you imagine? A Sinbad world, a Sinbad influenced world.

2032
01:48:50,200 --> 01:48:51,800
Life is the greatest adventure.

2033
01:48:53,320 --> 01:48:54,760
It sure is. It sure is.

2034
01:48:54,760 --> 01:48:58,360
And well, and on that note, Lindsay Katai, you survived podcast The Ride.

2035
01:48:59,240 --> 01:49:03,640
A super sentimental one, a nice one. I thought it was great.

2036
01:49:04,360 --> 01:49:07,320
And let's exit through the gift shop. Is there anything you'd like to plug?

2037
01:49:07,960 --> 01:49:11,640
Well, it was a pleasure to be on the podcast. Thank you for having me.

2038
01:49:12,440 --> 01:49:18,760
And if people have not watched it yet, the Cartoon Network show I wrote on,

2039
01:49:18,760 --> 01:49:23,880
Infinity Train, all four seasons are now available on HBO Max.

2040
01:49:23,880 --> 01:49:27,960
That is the end of the show, sadly. The fourth season is the final.

2041
01:49:29,720 --> 01:49:33,400
Please, please watch it. Very proud of the work that we did on that show.

2042
01:49:33,400 --> 01:49:37,560
And you can also check out my podcast Teen Creeps, where

2043
01:49:37,640 --> 01:49:42,440
me and my co-host Kelly Nugent talk about YA pulp fiction of the 80s and 90s,

2044
01:49:42,440 --> 01:49:45,480
such as Arl Stein, Christopher Pike, etc.

2045
01:49:47,240 --> 01:49:53,320
Check both of those out. Infinity Train this season features a, I don't hope this is not a

2046
01:49:53,320 --> 01:50:00,120
spoiler, but a large pig baby voiced by J.K. Simmons. And it's delightful.

2047
01:50:00,840 --> 01:50:01,480
Wow.

2048
01:50:01,480 --> 01:50:04,600
That's just that's a specific I want to say. There's a lot of great.

2049
01:50:04,680 --> 01:50:09,080
I was yes, Lindsay wrote that episode and I just wanted to give everyone a little treat.

2050
01:50:10,200 --> 01:50:12,440
Much like Pig Baby demands a little treat.

2051
01:50:14,040 --> 01:50:18,120
Yes, there that is. It's a very strange episode.

2052
01:50:18,120 --> 01:50:21,720
And I feel like listeners of this podcast would like that one specifically,

2053
01:50:21,720 --> 01:50:23,720
but the whole series as a whole as well.

2054
01:50:23,720 --> 01:50:27,800
You know, it's just refreshing to hear the phrase Pig Baby demands a treat,

2055
01:50:27,800 --> 01:50:30,120
and it's not referring to me for once.

2056
01:50:32,760 --> 01:50:34,360
I modeled him after you.

2057
01:50:34,360 --> 01:50:35,720
Oh, thank you so much.

2058
01:50:37,480 --> 01:50:39,320
But that my real I don't know.

2059
01:50:41,720 --> 01:50:43,400
Get some of that Oscar winner juice.

2060
01:50:43,960 --> 01:50:44,280
Yeah.

2061
01:50:45,880 --> 01:50:51,640
Hey, as for us, you can follow the compass of your heart to us on all the socials at

2062

month. Check out podcasts, the ride, the second gate at patreon.com slash podcast the ride.

2064
01:51:02,520 --> 01:51:04,840
That was fantastic. Everyone enjoy Disneyland.

2065
01:51:04,840 --> 01:51:07,960
If you're there now, someone might be listening to this who's there now.

2066
01:51:07,960 --> 01:51:10,600
If you're going in the next week or so, have a great time.

2067
01:51:10,600 --> 01:51:12,200
We're hoping to go as soon as we can.

2068
01:51:13,160 --> 01:51:16,200
Lindsay, hopefully see you soon in person and do a podcast.

2069
01:51:16,200 --> 01:51:17,240
That would be very nice.

2070
01:51:17,800 --> 01:51:20,280
Yeah. And interrupt your breakfast again.

2071
01:51:22,120 --> 01:51:25,880
Yeah, I really miss sneaking into my kitchen and getting some cereal and then

2072
01:51:26,520 --> 01:51:29,080
scooting back upstairs. I really miss it.

2073
01:51:29,800 --> 01:51:31,480
Well, in the inner in the interjects, they're like,

2074
01:51:32,920 --> 01:51:36,600
hearing us say something wrong and correcting.

2075
01:51:37,880 --> 01:51:40,440
Going the world needs to hear me on this.

2076
01:51:43,320 --> 01:51:46,600
And wait, so the final thing has to be I don't have it at my disposal.

2077
01:51:46,600 --> 01:51:50,120
What is that? What's the nice message of this ride that has to be the end of the episode?

2078
01:51:51,240 --> 01:51:52,440
About friendship.

2079
01:51:52,440 --> 01:51:55,960
Oh, the greatest treasure of all is friendship.

2080
01:51:56,680 --> 01:51:59,080
Yeah. Wow. That was beautiful.

2081
01:51:59,080 --> 01:52:00,200
Wow. Big baby.

2082
01:52:01,720 --> 01:52:06,200
All right. Well, let's say that's the first and last instance of that.

2083
01:52:07,240 --> 01:52:10,360
You brought that on yourself. Nobody replied it to you.

2084
01:52:10,360 --> 01:52:12,840
You know, I thought it was done. I thought we had moved on.

2085
01:52:12,840 --> 01:52:16,840
And sometimes you can't predict a callback. So fair enough.

2086
01:52:16,840 --> 01:52:20,360
It wouldn't help to juxtapose that awful phrase with the nice one.

2087
01:52:22,760 --> 01:52:24,280
No, let's think about the nice one. Friendship.

2088
01:52:24,280 --> 01:52:24,760
Think about that.

2089
01:52:25,240 --> 01:52:26,680
Thanks for listening. All right.

2090
01:52:26,680 --> 01:52:27,180
Bye.
