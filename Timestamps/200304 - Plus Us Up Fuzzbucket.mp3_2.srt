1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
In tonight's Plus Us Up second game movie,

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
a young boy named Mikey meets a possum or something,

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
and their bond causes Mikey to become very distant

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
from his family.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Hello, I'm Scott Gardner,

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
co-head of the podcast The Ride Company,

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
joined by Michael Carlson.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Hello.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
And Jason Sheridan.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Hello.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Ah, that felt good to do.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Yeah.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So driving a car, you're very comfortable,

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
or a car you've always dreamed of driving.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Yeah.

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Did you know we would do hello?

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I think I was hoping.

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I would have been, that was a good yes ending.

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Yeah, here we are.

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
This is the thing that you, the audience, sentenced us to do.

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Although we chose within this.

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
If you didn't hear a previous episode,

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
we talked about the Imagineering story a couple of times,

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
and that's on Disney Plus.

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
And we said, send us to watch something on Disney Plus,

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
and you know, what's kind of the strangest thing,

28
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
and the thing you'd most like to hear our thoughts on.

29
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
And we got a lot of fantastic entries,

30
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
and maybe it's a thing we could revisit at some point in time.

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
A ton of great, was there anything else that you guys were tempted by?

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Well, I forget the name of it,

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
but I remember specifically,

34
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I think it was Bethany Squires tweeted at us,

35
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
like, you should check out this Apartheid comedy.

36
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And I'm like, excuse me?

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
What? Wait, I missed this.

38
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
And I think it's about the power of friendship with a Caucasian girl,

39
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
and a person, a girl who's a person of color.

40
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
And I was like, is this from the 80s?

41
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
And it's from 2000.

42
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
And I don't quite know what this mystery is.

43
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Was this a thing that, I believe when this aired,

44
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I could have the wrong movie,

45
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
but I think this may have aired on the Wonderful World of Disney,

46
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
or whatever they were calling it at the time,

47
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
with a Bill Clinton appearance.

48
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Okay.

49
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Potentially a Bill Clinton appearance with Eisner,

50
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
because I was trying to find,

51
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I was movie by movie trying to find every Eisner hello for the montage.

52
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
So I'm aware of what a lot of the individual ones were,

53
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
and I don't remember the name of it,

54
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
but I think as aired on TV,

55
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
it may have been a Clinton meets Eisner scenario.

56
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Oh my God.

57
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
That's insane.

58
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Is Eisner on the flight logs?

59
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I don't think so.

60
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
No, I've looked.

61
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I think I've looked for Disney employees and I didn't really find any.

62
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Only someone whose TV series was bought by Disney.

63
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Yeah.

64
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
And is now available.

65
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
That narrows it down.

66
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
The one with 700 episodes.

67
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Oh, right. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

68
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It was just a foot massage from a 13 year old.

69
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Yeah, yeah.

70
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
That's all it was.

71
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Yeah, yeah.

72
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Bethy Squire.

73
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Sorry. Excuse me.

74
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
The color of friendship.

75
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Yeah, I think it's a friendship.

76
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I think it's it, but it's like from 2000.

77
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
So it would have been in that later.

78
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Yeah.

79
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
This was the thing we're talking about today was on the magical world of Disney.

80
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I think that's right.

81
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
It's going to keep them straight.

82
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
And a lot of things were the Disney Sunday night movie.

83
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
If you look it up on Wikipedia,

84
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
it's a very dense Wikipedia that goes way back to a wonderful world of color.

85
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Disney land.

86
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
This used to be called.

87
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
They just considered Disney anthology to be one giant thing that was once

88
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
hosted by Walt Disney and years later hosted by Michael Eisner and has also

89
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
aired with no host.

90
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It's a big confusing mess.

91
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Right.

92
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Did anything strike your fancy, Mike?

93
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Did you want to feel like campaigning for anything else over Fuzz Bucket?

94
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Well, I mean, the stuff we've talked about already, you know,

95
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
the Mighty Ducks series, the animated series.

96
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Yeah.

97
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
We did talk.

98
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
We were just talking about Meet the Deedles, which I do feel like.

99
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It's got a lot of votes and I ended up watching Meet the Deedles and we made

100
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Meet the Deedles maybe worth looking at down the line.

101
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
And when we were casting our final votes, making this decision,

102
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
one of you guys, I forget which said when I brought up Meet the Deedles,

103
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
oh, is that the movie about the guys with the blue hair?

104
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
And I said, no, no, no, that has nothing to do with anything.

105
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
The blue hair are big surf waves and all that that's supposed to communicate

106
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
is that it's about two surfers.

107
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
But it's clearly a poster that failed you.

108
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Yeah.

109
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Thirty years ago, not 30, when was that 98?

110
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Like that's they gave you the wrong impression forever ago that was never

111
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
corrected.

112
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
We thought I think Jason and I both thought they had blue hair.

113
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I thought it was a family that had blue hair.

114
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I never thought about it.

115
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Maybe you saw a poster in passing.

116
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
They were like Marges.

117
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Yeah, they were Marges family and the Simpsons in human form.

118
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
The live action Marge movie.

119
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Something that will eventually come to say like there's no reason why each

120
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Simpson shouldn't have their own show and then go for 30 more years.

121
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Oh, finally, it'll live actioning.

122
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
It is maybe that maybe that is what Disney does.

123
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:33,000
The three PCG of each individual Moe.

124
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I got.

125
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Yeah, he's Moe.

126
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Josh Gadd is Moe.

127
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
For Christmas, I got the DVD set that has Haunted Mansion, Tower of Terror,

128
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Crunchy Bears and the live act, the mysterious live action, Mr.

129
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Toad, Tower of Terror and Mr.

130
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Toad are not on Disney Plus yet.

131
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
No, I'm glad we weren't doing Mr.

132
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Toad because so sad this week, Terry Jones, Terry Jones, right?

133
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

134
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
It might be a while ago when we put this out.

135
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Yeah, but poor.

136
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Yeah, that's the record.

137
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Yeah.

138
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
So I mean, those are all probably worth watching, though.

139
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I would do all of those.

140
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Yeah, because we got votes for Country Bears, too, which I think I think we'll

141
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
hit that at some point, maybe in the vicinity of talking about the the

142
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
attraction, maybe made a little progress in figuring out how to do it.

143
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Yeah.

144
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
But oh, also, Old Dogs got a lot of votes, but it's not technically as of

145
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
this recording, it is not technically on Disney Plus yet.

146
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It's one of those like coming up soon.

147
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
But that is Disney.

148
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

149
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Because Wild Hogs was Disney.

150
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Yeah.

151
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Is that on Disney Plus?

152
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It wasn't Wild Hogs a big hit.

153
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
And then it seemed like they tried to churn out like, oh, let's turn out.

154
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
But those aren't the same.

155
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Those aren't the same universe.

156
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Wild Hogs.

157
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Same director.

158
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Right.

159
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
And Travolta's in the bus.

160
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Similar.

161
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Similar.

162
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
It feels like reaching for the same audience.

163
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
And there's an OGS in the title.

164
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Yes.

165
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Is also what they have in common.

166
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
But it isn't.

167
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Is Wild Hogs.

168
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Wild Hogs.

169
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Travolta is not the same character, though.

170
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
No, no, no.

171
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
OK.

172
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I think it just killed.

173
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
As I recall, the failure of Old Dogs killed Wild Hogs, too.

174
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Really?

175
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Yeah, I think there was going to be a sequel that was canceled.

176
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
That feels unfair.

177
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Yeah.

178
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
It's a different movie.

179
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Mm hmm.

180
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,360
Well, it's like if you make one of the worst films ever put on movie screens, then you

181
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,000
don't get to do a Star Wars anymore.

182
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Right.

183
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
You don't get to make episode nine.

184
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I guess.

185
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I guess that's the same thing.

186
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Even though people are now saying maybe should have kept him.

187
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I don't know.

188
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Well, we've seen the leaks.

189
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
We don't know.

190
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I haven't seen an iconic line in these leaks like The Dead Speak, though.

191
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
So.

192
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Yeah.

193
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
They did one thing.

194
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
It's one of the best lines.

195
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
The way the human brain works, it always feels like the grass is always greener.

196
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Like, oh, what could have been like that possibility allows us to reach for the stars, but it also

197
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
shackles us to the ground if we spend too much time thinking about.

198
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
This is very unfair.

199
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I like this light.

200
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
And what an episode to have it on.

201
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
The subject is so very.

202
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,000
About a creature from who lives under the ground and should probably have stayed there.

203
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Place.

204
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Place.

205
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Home going.

206
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Going.

207
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
God.

208
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Brutal listeners.

209
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I like to think I've given you some joy or respite from this cruel world.

210
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
And I only ask now why?

211
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Why did you do this to us?

212
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Why do we do this to ourselves?

213
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:51,000
And there was a we should now blame this person, though I will say I appreciate his passion.

214
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Nick Hoffman is the Twitter user who said there were discussions on a discord about

215
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
that.

216
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Like, well, we should maybe present a solid case for Fuzzbucket.

217
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
And that was impossible to deny.

218
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
And it got a lot of votes, too.

219
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
So that's great.

220
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Passion.

221
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Great.

222
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Why for this?

223
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I mean, I guess now you're getting it now.

224
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
You're getting us.

225
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
You do get to hear us complain in a hopefully funny way for a little bit.

226
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I hope it's funny.

227
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I feel like you can draw a straight line from Mr. Boogity to that.

228
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Like, this is like.

229
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Clearly cousins.

230
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Yes.

231
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
The oddity.

232
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
It's in our wheelhouse.

233
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:31,000
And I also like I mean, I should we give a little background about what this is first?

234
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Because I have a little more about the.

235
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I do as well.

236
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Yes.

237
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Up the name.

238
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It's called the.

239
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
The Disney DVD on demand Disney Generations collection.

240
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Oh, I have no information about the Generations.

241
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Okay.

242
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I've got a little.

243
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
But if you want to if you want to go ahead and say what exactly is Fuzzbucket?

244
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Fuzzbucket of the week.

245
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Fuzzbucket aired on either magical world of Disney or Disney Sunday movie on May 18th,

246
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:08,000
1986 and bizarrely surprising surprisingly to a lot of people when Disney plus did the

247
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
dump that one day of here's every title that's going to be available.

248
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
There were the big there were the heavy hitters like, oh, finally, this will be somewhere

249
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
and current big movie Star Wars Marvel and then mixed into it.

250
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Mr. Boogity, I think, got all the love.

251
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
But Fuzzbucket as well to present Fuzzbucket.

252
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I think most people were like, what is Fuzzbucket?

253
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I had the vaguest recollection because of the Eisner intro, right, which we'll get to.

254
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:37,000
But so this yeah, this aired one night and the whole.

255
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
It's it's very short, as we discovered.

256
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Yes.

257
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Forty five minutes.

258
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,000
And I think the story with that is that this is, I think, technically a failed pilot.

259
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Yeah.

260
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Five minutes in.

261
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I'm like, this has got to be a failed pilot, right?

262
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Yeah.

263
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
And and it's in a listed in a book about failed pilots.

264
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
And even there's a fun little montage which will tweet.

265
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I recently watched a special that is a cutdowns of a bunch of failed pilots.

266
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
That's pretty fun that aired on ABC in the early 2000s.

267
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:13,000
That kind of makes fun of it like actually kind of shits on all these shows or in some cases goes like, how do you not pick up this one?

268
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Or it was actually a cool little thing.

269
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:27,000
So Fuzzbucket, there's a little two minute cut down and this show was seemingly similarly horrified as we were the night that it aired May 18th because it's only 45 minutes and that block is two hours.

270
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
They had to pad it out with something else.

271
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:38,000
And I think it bears mentioning that that night it was a double feature between Fuzzbucket and a another failed pilot I believe called the Deacon Street Deer.

272
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:46,000
The Deacon Street Deer is about a group of streetwise kids who have to rescue a deer that's lost in a big city.

273
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I think this wasn't it because how does that become a show?

274
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Do they have to rescue a different deer each week?

275
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Maybe it's different deers.

276
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
22.

277
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Bastards.

278
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
22 deers a season.

279
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
They then couldn't call it the Deacon Street Deer unless just every there's new Deacon Street Deers over and over.

280
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:11,000
What if it's like boxcar children where once they get the deer in the first episode then they and the deer just solve mysteries.

281
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I think the deer lives with them now.

282
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I think the deer lives on Deacon Street now.

283
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,000
So the deer lives in their bedroom and then they ride it to a mystery.

284
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Yeah.

285
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Away from mysteries.

286
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Yeah.

287
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:33,000
All the three kids climb on Deer's back and who probably talks like Deacon Deacon Doo.

288
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Yeah.

289
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Yeah.

290
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:50,000
In this film one of the streetwise kids a young Mario Lopez notable thing and probably the craziest thing about it Deacon Street Deer written by the very first writing credit of James Mangold.

291
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Really?

292
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Eventually Logan of Walk the Line of most recently Ford versus Ferrari.

293
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Wow.

294
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
This is his very first writing credit system.

295
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Heavy hitters in Fuzzbucket as well.

296
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Yeah.

297
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I came across that too.

298
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,000
The thing I real quick came across the Generations collection.

299
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Yes.

300
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
OK.

301
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:20,000
So this was I believe like I said it seems like this was a thing that was popular for a little while DVD on demand.

302
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
The thing that comes to mind most is the Warner Brothers archives.

303
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Are you guys familiar with this?

304
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:37,000
They put out kind of more like deep cut movies and like you have to order it right from them because they make they don't make them until someone orders them.

305
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,000
And it seems like Disney tried this in 2011 and 2012.

306
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I found an old WordPress blog called Open Vault Disney that seems like it's cataloged most of them and most of these are still available on Amazon.

307
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
There's 12.

308
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
It looks like there was 12.

309
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
So just shout out anything that piques your interest.

310
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Amy Student Exchange Gold Rush colon a real life Alaskan adventure.

311
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I'm all blanks on this.

312
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Fuzzbucket.

313
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Yeah.

314
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Child of Glass.

315
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
What?

316
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
The Waltz King.

317
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
What?

318
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Back to Hannibal colon the return of Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn 1990.

319
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
What?

320
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Beyond Witch Mountain.

321
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
OK.

322
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I've heard of that.

323
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Endurance.

324
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
What?

325
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Justin Morgan had a horse.

326
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
That I've heard.

327
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I have heard of that one.

328
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
All those titles.

329
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
All of them.

330
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
The Leftovers and the Richest Cat in the World.

331
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
That's a Disney Plus.

332
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
That came back.

333
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Yeah.

334
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I think one or two of these are on Disney Plus.

335
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Unless I'm confusing it with the cat from outer space.

336
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
And not that darn cat.

337
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Not that darn cat.

338
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Either 70s one or Christina Ricci one.

339
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Right.

340
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,000
There's something I've been trying to work on this theory of like there is something

341
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:04,000
about the Disney film division of like when you commit to not making R rated movies.

342
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Something happens to people's brain.

343
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Like you try to be too family friendly.

344
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
You end up with like.

345
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Fuzz bucket?

346
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Fuzz bucket.

347
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Yeah.

348
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
It's.

349
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Like it's so they soften anything that could be sharp until it is nothing.

350
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Yeah.

351
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Until nothing is left.

352
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,320
Although I would not maybe apply that to fuzz bucket because there are things in fuzz bucket

353
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,000
that are like R rated I feel.

354
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Yeah.

355
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
We actually found fuzz bucket kind of bleak.

356
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Yeah.

357
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
And all of the characters seem to hate each other.

358
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Like despise each other.

359
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
And whatever.

360
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
No they don't feel like a family at all.

361
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
They don't feel like a family.

362
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:56,000
And also whatever film green they used made it feel like harsh.

363
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Yes.

364
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Like unintentionally French new wave kind of harsh.

365
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,000
There's shots in the kitchen where we're up front at the sink.

366
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Mom's doing dishes or whatever.

367
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:14,000
And Mikey the boy walks up from the bed and he is the most out of focus I've seen in a

368
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
like a non-student film.

369
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Like John Casametti is about to walk in and start screaming.

370
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I mean though it is to be fair to them I have a feeling they haven't remastered this footage

371
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
for a new generation.

372
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I mean that's true.

373
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Maybe not.

374
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
We need to go in they need to go in and clean it up frame by frame.

375
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Yeah.

376
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
It's not a true restoration.

377
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Yeah.

378
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
No.

379
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Probably not.

380
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Nor did anyone go in and add the word McClunky after the fact.

381
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Though maybe.

382
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
It feels like something fuzz bucket might say.

383
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
It does.

384
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
It's a little grito-esque I suppose.

385
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
He's got a snout.

386
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
He has a lot.

387
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I mean I think he's very inspired by Yoda as well I would say.

388
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Yes.

389
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Rearranged language equals.

390
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:09,000
But he doesn't really he knows most words he just kind of like flops them weird.

391
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Yeah there's not really a consistency to the way he speaks.

392
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
No.

393
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Sometimes he just shouts a word over and over again.

394
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
The point I wanted to quickly make is that about the sit the idea that it was going to

395
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:24,000
be a show is that the cover of it is the whole family like.

396
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Yeah.

397
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
It's like closing around fuzz bucket as if it's like Harry and the Hendersons.

398
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
But this doesn't happen in the movie.

399
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
No.

400
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Most of these characters do not meet fuzz bucket and are furious at the idea that he

401
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
might exist.

402
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Yeah.

403
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
So like the idea that they're all friends and the cover is wrong.

404
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
So this feels like a promo shot.

405
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Yeah.

406
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
For a potential series.

407
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
If you were looking for the moment where they all gather together.

408
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Keep looking.

409
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Look for another.

410
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Go to Alf because there's never a part where they all hug.

411
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Also you don't want these monsters to gather together.

412
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
No.

413
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
They need to stay in the hole.

414
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
No.

415
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:07,000
They need if they're gathering together they need a family therapist or some sort of counselor

416
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
or something.

417
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Oh you meant the monster.

418
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I meant the family.

419
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I meant the fuzz bucket.

420
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Yeah he meant the.

421
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I meant the family and the school administration.

422
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
They're all no they're all monsters as well.

423
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
They're all monsters.

424
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Everyone in this is a monster.

425
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Maybe not Mikey.

426
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
But he's also a little unpleasant.

427
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
He's a very unpleasant 80s kid.

428
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Yeah but he I feel like he is very much an 80s kid.

429
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,000
For context this movie came out in 1986 and the big thing that I looked up is OK.

430
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Yes.

431
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
He came out right after ET.

432
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,000
They're clearly swinging for ET and Alf came along not too long after.

433
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Alf is in the same year.

434
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Same year.

435
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Right.

436
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Like someone was speculating they were trying to beat Alf to markets.

437
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
But I don't I can't confirm that.

438
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
There's something coming.

439
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
There's something on the horizon.

440
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
It's going to kill us.

441
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
A writer just stressed out.

442
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
We got to beat Alf.

443
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
We got to beat Alf.

444
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I got to get this draft.

445
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I don't know what this Alf thing is but people are talking about.

446
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
It's like Gabbo on The Simpsons.

447
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
You just heard the word Alf.

448
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Alf is coming.

449
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Oh shit.

450
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
We need our own Alf.

451
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
God damn it.

452
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Every network is like we got to beat Alf.

453
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I've heard he's some sort of alien puppet.

454
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Like a Muppet?

455
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Yeah.

456
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Well kind of.

457
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Kind of.

458
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
All right fine.

459
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Well let's figure out our own character that's going to be just as enjoyable.

460
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I don't know.

461
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Fuzzbucket?

462
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I don't know.

463
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
There's a cleanliness to Alf.

464
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I mean three letters.

465
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
It's just so pared down.

466
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
It's perfect.

467
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
He talks.

468
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
He speaks in perfect English too.

469
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Should Fuzzbucket?

470
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
No.

471
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Should he like make funny quips?

472
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
No.

473
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
He should just sort of be stressed and you know lick people.

474
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Yeah and then like demand a kiss.

475
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I don't want to get ahead of ourselves here but when Fuzzbucket demands a kiss from Mikey.

476
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I'm glad we were all scarred by the same.

477
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
The rough shit.

478
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
The fancy kiss.

479
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Some rough shit.

480
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:06,000
The writer director is a guy named Mick Garris and I have to say very interesting career.

481
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Yeah I wasn't really familiar with this guy.

482
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Directed the later TV adaptation of The Shining.

483
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Directed a lot of TV Stephen King stuff.

484
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
The Stand.

485
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,000
That star studded version of The Stand.

486
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Did an Amazing Stories.

487
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:36,000
He wrote an Amazing Stories that got an Edgar Award which is a mystery writers award.

488
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
The Fly 2.

489
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
The Fly 2 wrote Hocus Pocus.

490
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Wrote Hocus Pocus.

491
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
The iconic stuff there.

492
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Yeah created some of those horror, later horror anthology shows.

493
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
What was the Showtime one?

494
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Was it Masters of Horror?

495
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Masters of Horror and then NBC tried one called Fear Itself.

496
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:03,000
There's a lot of guys like that like Joe Dante I think he seems similar to career to Joe Dante.

497
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:08,000
He had some big stuff and then has done a lot of horror kind of anthology stuff.

498
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Probably big in that world.

499
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Yes very big in that.

500
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Pulpy.

501
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Really stuck to his guns in the genre.

502
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
He also he was seemingly part of something called Coming Soon.

503
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:27,000
That was I've never heard of it was a compilation of old horror trailers strung together with connective tissue.

504
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
It was segments with Jamie Lee Curtis.

505
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Filmed on the Universal lot.

506
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:39,000
And that seemed to be the way that he came up with the producer of this film John Landis.

507
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Maybe you're getting here but did you see he's an uncredited zombie in Thriller?

508
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Oh yeah I do.

509
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
That's crazy.

510
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Wow.

511
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
He's a Thriller zombie.

512
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:53,000
He worked on something too called is it Michael Jackson's Ghosts?

513
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
He was always part of Ghosts?

514
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Oh I love Ghosts.

515
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
That was a later promotional.

516
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
He also made a lot of making of stuff.

517
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I know way too much about ghosts and I won't get into it here.

518
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:14,000
But that's the bizarre Stan Winston thing that was paired the only way you could see it was paired with Stephen King's Thinner.

519
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:23,000
He had to wait around after Thinner to watch a very long much worse Thriller that also stars Mos Def.

520
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Wow.

521
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
It's a very bizarre thing.

522
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I have a lot of respect for the horror world.

523
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I was never a horror kid and I don't understand it but I respect it as like seeing it as adjacent to like the comic book world or like the theme park kind of world.

524
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I understand it.

525
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I get it.

526
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I get it folks.

527
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
And there's those people there's the Tony Baxter's of that world.

528
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:54,000
These like cult heroes to people who if either you maybe you don't know who they are if you don't know that world but if you do this person's like a hero to you.

529
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Yeah.

530
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:04,000
And and I also I respect Fangoria for coming back and like not really putting much online like you have to track it down because like it came back in print.

531
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,000
That very first issue had like a long conversation between Jordan Peele and Paul Thomas Anderson.

532
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Wow.

533
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:17,000
And I'm like I gotta find that somewhere like I guess I gotta find that issue of Fangoria.

534
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:25,000
This was this kicked off a pretty exciting summer for John Landis.

535
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
This aired in May 1986.

536
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
So all right.

537
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Summer of fun and the summer ended around the beginning of September was the beginning of his manslaughter trial.

538
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
He was producing Fuzzbucket.

539
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Wow.

540
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
This was one of the one of the projects three amigos as well.

541
00:23:44,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I mean you probably spend more time on things he was directing but this was one of the things that happened between the Twilight Zone movie accident which killed actor Vic Morrow and two underage actors in which he was considered responsible for in some regard but then acquitted later.

542
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
But this is one of the things he did like between accident and trial.

543
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Right.

544
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I had no idea.

545
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I thought what happened was he like went quiet or went underground after the accident.

546
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
No.

547
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,000
He made some of his biggest stuff at like the most things you know the most.

548
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Training places was pretty soon after the accident.

549
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Yeah.

550
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Three amigos.

551
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Into the night.

552
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Coming to America is 88.

553
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Right after.

554
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
It's so crazy.

555
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Yeah.

556
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:49,000
I was trying to figure out what event in the the Twilight Zone accident happened closest to the release of Fuzzbucket and it is this and it's pretty good because I have a book about the whole thing.

557
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:54,000
I never remember the name like unjust conduct.

558
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
It's like it's like a really judgmental name.

559
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
But I got this book out.

560
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:05,000
And OK so May 86 Fuzzbucketers June 86.

561
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
They're trying to gather up people to testify in the trial.

562
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
One of the people is producer and Jimmy Buffett friend Frank Marshall.

563
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Of course.

564
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Who people have always thought knows more than he's ever said about.

565
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
He was on Island Time.

566
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
He doesn't know.

567
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
He was at a cocktail.

568
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
What happened?

569
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Oh too bad.

570
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Oh well another pink.

571
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Whoopsie.

572
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Apparently apparently the fire chief inspector was on fire time too.

573
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Or I think I have fuck.

574
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
But like fire time.

575
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
This is the sort of Fuzzbucket you distracted me.

576
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
You're rearranging words.

577
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
You stupid son of a bitch.

578
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
That kind of happens at some point.

579
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Why did I ever take care of you?

580
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
You never did nothing for me.

581
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
He gets really he really yells at Fuzzbucket.

582
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
The kid is right.

583
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Yes he is.

584
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
He is right.

585
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Yeah well I'll move into.

586
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I'm sorry.

587
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
I'll move into.

588
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
I'm sorry.

589
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
But the.

590
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
So really quick.

591
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
So this is June.

592
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:06,000
They want to see if Frank Marshall will testify in the trial at the end of the summer.

593
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,000
But he is in London prepping who framed Roger Rabbit which he's producing.

594
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:16,000
So they send somebody from the American Embassy in England to go serve him.

595
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
And they go to his where he's staying and they buzz.

596
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
And he says oh sure.

597
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
You know what.

598
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Look I'm busy right now.

599
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,000
But if you come back later in the afternoon I'd be happy to talk to you.

600
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
OK.

601
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Sounds good.

602
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Person leaves within a half an hour.

603
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
He is on a private Amblin plane to Paris.

604
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
I was well you added the you added the Amblin there.

605
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,000
I was assuming it would be like Buffett picks him up in his sea plane.

606
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Were they buds yet though?

607
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
I don't know.

608
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
This might have pre dated.

609
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
They were.

610
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Yeah they were for sure in the 90s mid to early 90s.

611
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:56,000
I'm not sure if they were yet but I like the idea that like Jimmy I need a I need a way out.

612
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Jimmy flies the seaplane over with like a rope.

613
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Climb aboard.

614
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Or there's like a monkey holding like hanging on the rope and he like grabs Frank and they just sail away.

615
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Fins up.

616
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:13,000
I would have thought he would have gone somewhere without extradition.

617
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Right.

618
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Paris isn't that far.

619
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
He's still going to get his work done.

620
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
I guess so.

621
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Rebecca says a lot of demands.

622
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Yeah no computer.

623
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Finalizing the Hoskins contract.

624
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Paris is like a Jimmy Buffett safe hold like a stronghold like he has control over Paris.

625
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
He lives in the Arc de Triomphe famously.

626
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Don't go you're not allowed up there.

627
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
It's all island shit.

628
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
It's all deck chairs.

629
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:44,000
I think actually if you bring that up though Jimmy Buffett didn't get crazy crazy popular till the 90s till like the early 90s.

630
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Sure yeah.

631
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
He wasn't like having the same success.

632
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:59,000
In the way that the Grateful Dead kind of like super came back as this tour and never went away but really exploded as a touring entity.

633
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
It seems like it was a similar like that's what really got him there.

634
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Yes I think that's right.

635
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
So yeah maybe I'm not accusing Frank of not being a real fan or anything here.

636
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
I'm just saying maybe you may be right.

637
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:17,000
He might have been maybe he didn't know Buffy yet but he did he got in the private plane and like okay get me out of here.

638
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Hey and could you put on something relaxing like volcano or something fun.

639
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
I'm stressed out.

640
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Yeah.

641
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:39,000
I didn't look I'm not for violence on film sets but after learning that some of these timelines and recalling that Landis showed up at Vic Morrill's funeral.

642
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:45,000
I have to say Eddie Murphy might have been right to choke him on the set.

643
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
I'm coming to you to kick his ass.

644
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:56,000
I also just found the Arsenio Hall clip where Eddie Murphy says I'd more likely or Vic Morrill is more likely to work with John Landis than me.

645
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Yeah.

646
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
But then he did on Beverly Hills Cup 3 the New Park one.

647
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Was like 94.

648
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Really soon he did it again.

649
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Really soon like he just kept working.

650
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
How how did you how.

651
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:21,000
And then after that I feel like he kind of went quiet and he also I feel like John Landis I associate with like a few documentaries and those horror again those horror anthology.

652
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
He took safe haven yes in this.

653
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Yeah yeah yeah.

654
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Well he cooled the career down because you know he had to focus on his family.

655
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Yeah.

656
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
That raising a great family.

657
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Well as well.

658
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Yeah sure.

659
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
That's all I have to say about that.

660
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
So fuzz bucket huh.

661
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Fuzz bucket.

662
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Well you know if you want to see a picture perfect American family.

663
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
I'm trying to I'm trying to find when Frank and Jimmy were friends.

664
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Jimmy Buffett is in hook in 1991.

665
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
He's a shoe.

666
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
He's a pirate right.

667
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
He's a shoe stealing pirate in hook.

668
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Uncredited.

669
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Colin Collins and Buffett both pirates in hook.

670
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Whoa.

671
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Wow.

672
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Do you think they taught they didn't they didn't cross over.

673
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
They've no no no.

674
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
That's too much to worry about.

675
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
You got like you know flying scenes.

676
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Angela Roberts and Buffett and Collins on the same day.

677
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
I OK I just got very distracted.

678
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:29,000
I apologize because I looked at composer on Jimmy's IMDB and there's something called Mara Lagoville from 2019.

679
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,000
That's probably just him they used a song and some shit thing.

680
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Because people attach like musicians to shitty IMD like to their crappy thing that they got on IMDB.

681
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Well we have to find that.

682
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
I mean check it though.

683
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
I'll check it.

684
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
We'll do it later.

685
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Sorry I got distracted.

686
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Yeah.

687
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
So I bet that's just like somebody probably on IMDB.

688
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
That'll make Mara Lagoville really take off.

689
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Right.

690
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Guys we're going viral.

691
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
OK.

692
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:03,000
So fuzz bucket.

693
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
How do we briefly synopsize this film.

694
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:11,000
I tried to at the top a little bit but it's it's clearly very posty T.

695
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:21,000
It's a sort of troubled youth who's clearly like you know artistic and has a lot of imagination.

696
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:26,000
He starts talking to an imaginary friend and his family is skeptical.

697
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:31,000
And people at school are skeptical but it turns out that it was never imaginary.

698
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,000
It was this odd creature named fuzz bucket and now Mikey has to help him get back home.

699
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Yes.

700
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
That's good.

701
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
That's that is what it is.

702
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
That's what the movie is.

703
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Yes.

704
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
That's what it is.

705
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
That's not how it feels.

706
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:51,000
No no it feels like this is like going you're going through molasses or like a sludge through the dirt.

707
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Unpleasant.

708
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:59,000
And there and there's no you would think maybe the movie is going to be like unpleasant until something happens magically.

709
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
And then it's just like it's just as bad.

710
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Yeah.

711
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Now there's a care like now there's a little character.

712
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,000
The things to elevate it the things that are visual just make it worse.

713
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
My favorite part of this.

714
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Does anyone want to guess.

715
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
I don't know if I can.

716
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Is it the dinner order.

717
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
No.

718
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
OK.

719
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
The principal.

720
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
No.

721
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I mean that stuff is all fine.

722
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:27,000
My favorite is my favorite thing in the movie is the little child's name.

723
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,000
His name is Mikey Gerber.

724
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Last name of my favorite people.

725
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Cindy Crawford's husband Randy Gerber.

726
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Got me.

727
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:42,000
So I like to think this is like maybe me if I was raised by Randy Gerber.

728
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
I like that is the one in I had for this movie.

729
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:51,000
They sort of whenever they would say Mikey and then they were talking about Mikey Gerber it would be like oh wouldn't it be cool to be Randy Gerber's.

730
00:32:51,000 --> 00:33:03,000
But does that imply that Randy Gerber is like an overworked like unpleasant man whose job appears to be going to business where he just works a lot doing his work.

731
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Like this was what he was doing maybe before like you know he had to build an empire or hit the tequila before the came when he and George magical suitcase was.

732
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Yeah.

733
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
And the greatest story of all time.

734
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Greatest story ever told.

735
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Greatest story ever told.

736
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Yeah this is I like to yeah this is him and George work.

737
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:27,000
This is him and George trying to figure out the tequila going to the places and learning about making alcohol.

738
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:34,000
And well that's what would have happened in the series is he would have made a tequila with fuzz bucket.

739
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
That green goo.

740
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Yeah that's why the like oh putting the stuff in the blender.

741
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
This looks so weird.

742
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
And Worcester sauce and chocolate.

743
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Let me.

744
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Not bad.

745
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,000
I need to find the brilliant mixologist responsible.

746
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Essentially created like a weird backwards mole sauce.

747
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:04,000
So I like to just the Casamigos connection is a my favorite part of fuzz bucket.

748
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:09,000
I this is a real little thing but when the mom like is in the car the key.

749
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Mike he's up in his room and the mom yells out we'll be back.

750
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,000
We're going to get a pizza and some spaghetti.

751
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:29,000
So unpleasant to me and I have a table set set the table before we're home that combination like I pulled up some articles.

752
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:54,000
I should I meant to do this last night because I had them I didn't really get a chance to read them because I was like wait when did Buffalo wings become nationally popular like they were popular in Buffalo before they kind of went world like country wide 70s and 80s they took off more as a bar food and then I think like pizza restaurants started to add them once like Domino's and Pizza Hut started to add like once it reaches popular consensus.

753
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:01,000
So we know where fuzz bucket lands in the timeline of those helicopter deaths but not in the timeline of the rise of Buffalo wings.

754
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:14,000
I think I think throughout the country there's a common pizza and blank pizza and sandwich pizza even if they like maybe baked seedy but the only time I remember eating pizza and spaghetti is like all right.

755
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:20,000
All right. We're having left overnight like what's in the fridge like I was a couple of there's some spaghetti or some leftover pizza.

756
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
There's some like pork chop.

757
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
You'd be bad. Would you still be bothered by pizza and spaghetti.

758
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,000
I can scarcely imagine this would be a problem for you.

759
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:43,000
I would. It just felt like such an odd thing for a character to go say like I'm going to go pick up and order like not like that and that she clar clarified that it was pizza and spaghetti as opposed to like pizza and something else.

760
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:50,000
It's just odd. It's just if it just hit my ears in a weird way to carbs a lot of carbs.

761
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,000
It's a lot of carbs. Yeah. I hear what you're saying. Yeah.

762
00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:01,000
We all gladly went to Bucatabepo and where you were what we had order pizza and spaghetti for every meal.

763
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Yeah that's true. I feel like that's part of the experience the abundance right.

764
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
But they weren't going to get a better. No they weren't.

765
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,000
That's another we don't know when Bucatabepo I don't know where this falls in the Robert Earl timeline.

766
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Right. Do we know if the rise of Buffalo wings coincides with the rise of Jimmy Buffett in the 90s.

767
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Did he have an opportunity to brand them for himself. Right.

768
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Buffett low wings. Buffett low wings.

769
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:41,000
I've had them at Margaritaville. I have had them. I think coincidentally it starts to like I do and maybe it's just as a kid you start to become cognizant of more things but it did feel like the 90s was like the like we got wings now.

770
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Like you feel like that was a marketing ploy. But you feel if this had been filmed at a later time it would have been pizza and Buffalo wings.

771
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Yeah. I just she had just said we're going to pick up some pizzas. That would have been fine.

772
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:01,000
But pizza and spaghetti just like felt so weird to me. I don't it just runs me such a wrong way.

773
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,000
And I was already like the movie had me in such a weird mood.

774
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:18,000
There's a point where they sit down to eat dinner and it's an unpleasant dinner and then it fades to the child sitting alone at the kitchen table in the near darkness.

775
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Are you most of your complaints about the movie. The dinner and what type of dinner and the mood at dinner.

776
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Because it's so unpleasant. Yeah. Little.

777
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Do we ever see. Oh, I was gonna say. Oh, well, yeah, I was gonna ask. Do we see what fuzz bucket eats? Obviously we see the bizarre.

778
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:41,000
The goo that makes him seeable. Yeah.

779
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Which I have some questions about. So yeah, he all right. Fuzz bucket is invisible for the first half of the movie and even we're questioning what's happening. Yeah.

780
00:37:49,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Is he there? Right. And then at some point, somehow Mikey gets the mission to give him a bizarre drink that consists of every type of sauce that's in their house. Right.

781
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:14,000
And the drink pretty quickly makes him like you see liquid falling onto. It's like they took some shape and put it on green screen and poured liquid on it. So something starts forming.

782
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:25,000
And then people were saying how this is like the director, the horror guy couldn't resist getting all horary because it could just be a cute thing where now the creatures here, Bing.

783
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:32,000
But they have to step it out where first it's a skeleton. This is so crazy.

784
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:41,000
This was cool, but very upsetting. Yes. With a better context, maybe skeleton organs skin like blood and guts.

785
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:59,000
It doesn't. Yes. Mid part is so crazy. Just to underline what you're saying. When he transforms from invisible to visible, we first he's standing perfectly still and you see his skeleton and then you see his organs and it's like circulatory system fill in.

786
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:04,000
And it's slow. This takes a minute and a half. Yeah, it feels like.

787
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
And there's no reason.

788
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Why would he be not be moving? Yeah, it feels like he's taxidermied until he actually moves once. It feels like he's being created. Now, like this feels like his creation.

789
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Like why start of him? I forgot. I like kind of looked away for a second and didn't make the connection that like all the blended sauces was the green goo in the next scene.

790
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:45,000
And I was like, is fuzz bucket just drinking paint like they should not be making a kids movie where they're like, drink paint. So your friend appears like get a bunch of drink paint and you'll start seeing new friends.

791
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:57,000
But then the other big thing is like child acting against invisible friend is it's cheap. Like it's a cheap thing. Like you only have to have the costumed actor less.

792
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:05,000
It's so cheap and it's also so hard to go like, that's crazy. That's even crazier to like nothing.

793
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Yeah, and he's fine. He's doing as good a job as he can, but he's pretty young. Yeah. Yeah, it's a lot of. Yeah, just watching this boy.

794
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:27,000
This boy dressed as bizarrely as I dressed as a child. It's like ill chosen three sizes, two big sweaters. It's it's all it's an unpleasant scene.

795
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Yeah. Well, could we go back a little bit? Like if you were analyzing the movie, like what is this movie saying? What is it about?

796
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:48,000
I think it's about the failure of the mental health system in America for families and children. Yeah, that's that is kind of what I'm getting at because the idea is like the kid is acting out.

797
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:55,000
I guess even though you don't really see much evidence, he seems like a nice kid. But like everyone is so sure he's crazy. Yeah.

798
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:05,000
And problem like, can we stop with the fuzz bucket already? Thank you. I had an imaginary friend. Yeah. You would imagine a friend. Of course. Scott.

799
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:15,000
I remember if I did, you're not so committedly. Do you remember the name of yours? Because I remember mine. I have a bunch and I like talk to myself all day. I had a couple from things and just.

800
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:29,000
I had a couple too. Now that I'm thinking about it, I do. I will remember my mother loves telling the story. My imaginary friend's name was Doinkle Viner and he lived by the library.

801
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Oh, wow. This is a revelation. Yeah. And you're sure this isn't the creep who you've muddied over time.

802
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:53,000
You mean this wasn't like a rat faced creature that lived underground that was actually real. It's not. It wasn't just like a street person who bought. Oh, I see what you're saying. And no, your mom didn't believe you. He had a house by the library.

803
00:41:53,000 --> 00:42:04,000
I should have clarified that. Oh, good for doing great. He was doing great. My mom said I used to point out the house as we drove by and she I would be like, that's where Doinkle lives.

804
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:19,000
And she'd be like, oh, OK. Doinkle. And I think, yeah, Doinkle, which is good. It's a pretty good name if I think about it. Doinkle's good. And I think there was another I had another one that lived a guy who lived inside the shower massage or the shower.

805
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Excuse me. There was a imaginary friend I had that lived inside of that. OK. Yeah. I don't know what that's about. That's some psychological. He's my friend I get to see when I'm naked. Yeah, there's something weird going on there, isn't it? Yeah.

806
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Yeah, I think about now that I say that out loud. He looks down on me. Yeah, I think I said he like fixed it.

807
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:50,000
What? Fixed what? What? The shower. Just fixed it. This is all stuff I'm just coming up. I remembered I was coming in with Doinkle today, but I didn't remember. I think the guy's name was Howie who lived in the shower head.

808
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:58,000
And again, you're sure there wasn't just like a little haunted household and a man lived in the walls and watched you. There was a repairman.

809
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:15,000
There was a man who lived in our walls who watched me shower as a little boy. And now I'm just blocking it out. Is it possible? I guess anything is possible. My memory of it is lather up on the back.

810
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Harrison Ford. My memory of it is that I think I remember thinking it was like almost like a David the Gnome style character inside the shower.

811
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Well, he's benign. I mean, he's a good guy. Yeah, that's my memory of the character that I created. He's not watching kids to get his jollies. No, he's waiting to die. He's jolly already.

812
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:51,000
He's saddest thing of anything. We really should do some David the Gnome stuff. But yeah, David, if you haven't seen it, the finale, he was a little gnome person that lived in a village of other gnomes.

813
00:43:51,000 --> 00:44:01,000
And he had a fox called Swift and they had like adventures. And then the final episode, he and his wife go out into the pasture and die.

814
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:19,000
And it is one of the saddest, shocking. And then the worst part about it is the fox watches. The fox sits and watches as he and his wife become trees and turn into like part of the part of the earth.

815
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:27,000
And yeah, anyway, so yeah, he was a nice guy. And that's my memory of that character who watched me shower.

816
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:31,000
So yeah, he was a nice guy. Yeah. So David the Gnome is what I've done. Turned into trees.

817
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Hey, the fox had a second act in their career. They booked the part of the Chaos Reigns fox and Antichrist all those years later. You've seen that meme.

818
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:43,000
You probably haven't seen that movie. You probably haven't seen the movie.

819
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:49,000
No, I haven't. I should also add David the Gnome voice by Tom Bosley, the dad from Happy Days.

820
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Oh gosh, yeah, that's nice. So dude, what do you think the shower guy sounded like? What was his name?

821
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:00,000
I think Howie? Howie? I think that's right. Howie?

822
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Shower Howie. When are you going to have the money, Howie? When?

823
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:11,000
I think I'm trying to think of what it was like. I can't imagine. I don't think I ever talked to him. That's the thing.

824
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:17,000
I mean, but I mean, if I'm thinking now it's he sounds like Tom Bosley is the gentle voice of Tom Bosley.

825
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:27,000
So an old man is your shower. Yeah. Yeah. An old man lived in my shower. That's what I thought.

826
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,000
You didn't speak. You didn't have to. The connection was stronger.

827
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,000
My mom's going to be mad. My mom hears this. She'll oftentimes be mad.

828
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Like she'll there'll be one detail like I'll get Howie wrong and she'll be like, you know, that's not the name of the character of your imaginary friend who lived in the shower.

829
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:54,000
And then I'll have to be like, I'll issue a correction, I guess. He lived in your toilet paper. Right. He said thanks every time you wiped.

830
00:45:54,000 --> 00:46:00,000
The creepiest shit I've ever. Yeah, maybe that's the worst thing you've ever said. That's the weirdest thing.

831
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:06,000
You got to throw a fuzz bucket on mute on the TV. Oh, sure. I guess. Do we need to?

832
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,000
No, I thought we talked about that before. I thought you were joking.

833
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Okay, never mind. No, I mean, my back is turned. Okay. Jason wants it and I'm happy to oblige.

834
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:21,000
I think it might actually even be loaded as long as as long as mute is the key word.

835
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:25,000
I don't want to hear that. The principal. Should we talk about the principal?

836
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Well, yes, the principal. The kids, the parents are shit talking.

837
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Mikey Garber and there may be the walls are paper thin. Yeah.

838
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Yeah, poor kid is listening to like Mikey is a problem. He's making things up.

839
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:45,000
And like it says the full volume. Yeah, this kid is feeling like shit. It's like, don't you know your house?

840
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Like, don't you know your house at this point? You know, you can go to talk about your kid without him hearing.

841
00:46:51,000 --> 00:47:00,000
They need whisper something counseling or a vacation or something like it just feels like so much animosity right under the surface.

842
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Yes. For all these characters know what caused it.

843
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:11,000
There's also a really like full volume. I'm working long hours for those kids. Feels like a ghost. Yes.

844
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:18,000
The dad is Joe Regal Budo, who, of course, we know from Murphy Brown.

845
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:33,000
And he's one of our all of our favorites who we were so delighted to see return when Murphy Brown made her triumphant return to the small screen with our favorite most likeable politician, Hillary Clinton.

846
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:43,000
So we were so like just obviously are excited to see Murphy again, but to see Joe Regal Budo, we've never stopped thinking of when will he come back?

847
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Just as an all an event only to be topped by the Spectrum original man about you.

848
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Well, I did think nothing would top the Spectrum original man about you.

849
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:57,000
And then I heard that there's a Turner and Hooch series coming to Disney Plus.

850
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:04,000
That's the only thing that I think could have topped those two things that you were talking about, how we all were so desirous to see.

851
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:08,000
We yes. OK, here's a question for everyone.

852
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Does the mom pass the Helen test? Oh, I don't know.

853
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Anyone catch her name? No.

854
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:19,000
No. I'm sorry. This is a trick question. She is credited solely as mom.

855
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:23,000
What? And that is credited though as dad.

856
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,000
All right. But the sister Stevie, she gets a name.

857
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:35,000
The mom and the sister are the biggest example of like underdeveloped women in maybe anything I've ever seen.

858
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Like they give them nothing to do. The mom is concerned.

859
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:47,000
At some point, she says like she I think she punishes Mikey of like you're not leaving this table till you finish your dinner.

860
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:54,000
So then he just waits it out until darkness and then she comes downstairs and it's like, OK, I'll make you a sandwich.

861
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:58,000
And it's like, is that what he's going to actually eat now?

862
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Wait, again, more food is nearly clean.

863
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Like there's like a little pile of it.

864
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,000
I was like, this wasn't evenly spread on those pieces of bread.

865
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:12,000
I don't understand the power dynamic for this punishment.

866
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,000
The food is unpleasant, like puppet.

867
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
You're just like this food doesn't make sense.

868
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Unpleasant. Everything is unpleasant.

869
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,000
The sister just despises the brother.

870
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Yeah. And like Robin Lively, teen witch fame.

871
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Yes. Like Lively's mom.

872
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:33,000
The mom was on Falcon Crest. Oh, I love the last season of Falcon Crest.

873
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,000
But yeah, she had nothing but everyone's a jerk to Mikey.

874
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Even when she starts defending him, it's still unpleasant.

875
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Like, he's not weird. OK, just everything's done like.

876
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Yeah. And then and that's just all of that.

877
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Forgetting the most unpleasant voice in the film, which is Fuzzbucket.

878
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:54,000
But I guess before that, what else is in the prelude?

879
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Now are we at principle? Yeah, I guess so.

880
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:03,000
So Mikey starts he's starting junior high and the principal is a very recognizable figure.

881
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:07,000
He played Dean Wormer in Animal House, which I forgot.

882
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,000
I was like watching it and I was like, why is this so familiar to me?

883
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:16,000
And it's he's essentially playing the same character directed by John Landis.

884
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Mm hmm. And what he says to Mikey, can I if I can do a line reading?

885
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Because I am assuming you have the same line that I have written down.

886
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
I think so. Do you want to take some of it?

887
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:28,000
I have a video, but I'll let you do it. Yeah, you can do it.

888
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:36,000
You nervous about P.E.? A lot of the young fellows are at first not used to taking showers with the other guys.

889
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Get real bad stomach aches, but they get over it soon enough.

890
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:48,000
I mean, Jesus, that is a sinister, sinister, like, threat, seemingly a threat.

891
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Not used to taking showers with the other guy.

892
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Like this is the airplane you ever seen a grown man naked line, but delivered straight.

893
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,000
That's what it reminded me. It didn't occur to me until then. Yeah. Yeah.

894
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:03,000
The real life version. Yeah. Similar vibe of a guy. Very straight and young.

895
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Stomach aches. The way he says it, too, is just so evil.

896
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:14,000
It's so scary. Then he turns the blinds right after.

897
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Yeah. It's a great performance for a different movie. Yeah. Yeah.

898
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Yeah. One day performance. He didn't get a vibe on what is the tone of his bucket.

899
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:30,000
He got some scripts mixed up. He thought he was making an adaptation of The Chocolate War

900
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:34,000
about the very strict boarding school and then someone dies.

901
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:42,000
It's just so intense. It's just like this guy is great, but he is again in the wrong picture.

902
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:48,000
You know, if you need someone to help usher you into the shower, kind of to be your guide.

903
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:52,000
I'm more than happy to lead you by the hand. Introduce you to the other boys.

904
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:56,000
They've seen me in there a number of times. Nothing to worry about.

905
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:01,000
You are saying that the implication is from this conversation.

906
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Got a big bottle of Tums if that stomach aches back. You know, lot of young fellas.

907
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,000
You want to talk about being scared of seeing your friends dicks?

908
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Is that what we need to talk about here? Not a big deal.

909
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,000
You get over it soon enough. You'll get over it. Soon enough.

910
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Describe some of what scared you. Could you describe the details of some of the things you might be imagining?

911
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Did anyone watch this back when they shot it? Because you know, making movies and TVs is hard.

912
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
It's hard.

913
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:38,000
You know, and sometimes maybe you shoot a scene and you don't know what it feels like until maybe you're watching the playback.

914
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Did anyone go, this is fucking weird?

915
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Yeah.

916
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Did anyone think that?

917
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Because also is the same scene maybe done like a, are you nervous about PE?

918
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Are you nervous about probably seeing some of the other boys? What am I saying?

919
00:52:53,000 --> 00:53:01,000
I'm verbal diarrhea-ing. Like if you play like he doesn't know how to help and he doesn't realize he walked himself into it, that he's digging himself a hole.

920
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:09,000
But instead he seems committedly, I am going to talk out the shower issue very slowly.

921
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Did you guys have to shower in PE? We didn't do that. We changed for gym.

922
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,000
I think we avoided it somehow.

923
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
In high school?

924
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Or middle school.

925
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:22,000
Not in middle school. Well, yeah, no, not in middle school, but in high school when we swam.

926
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Oh, even in swimming, we would just like rinse off in our bathing suits and then just change.

927
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:35,000
Well, yeah, I guess you're right. I guess we would rinse off in the bathing suits and then, but we would still like change in front.

928
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,000
You try to like hide it with your towel.

929
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:45,000
Yeah, hide it with a towel. I think I have to remind myself like TV and film usually written by like dorks.

930
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Some of who like had traumatic high school experiences and that's why there's always like plots about like showering or climbing the rope.

931
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Like I've never climbed a rope. Like that was such a trope.

932
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Yeah, a lot of those things that I've spent, I spent my whole childhood afraid of things that were going to happen in high school that did not happen.

933
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Yeah, I didn't like it. Also, by the way, I didn't like it.

934
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Like I was a little bit traumatized by the idea of like, and then you got to like take your clothes off in front of everyone.

935
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
You?

936
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Yeah, believe that or not.

937
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:23,000
But once you had to do it, and there's nothing wrong with a shower because you got a little buddy up there.

938
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,000
I'm still with you.

939
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,000
I followed you to high school.

940
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Now I'm watching all of the boys.

941
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Hey, what?

942
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
I've got eyes on every boy now.

943
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Howie, what are you doing here?

944
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
I don't know how to do Tom Bosley.

945
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Yeah, I have the gnomes.

946
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:47,000
I was just watching an interview with a, what's her name? Mariam, who played the mother on Happy Days.

947
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:53,000
And she used to say she used to tell stories and Tom Bosley would be like, no one gives a shit, Mariam.

948
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Like just ruining his reputation as like a kindly old man.

949
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
It's always the way.

950
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:01,000
I don't know, I think his stock just went up for me.

951
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,000
I don't like that he's doing it to his nice seeming.

952
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Yeah, very like sweet.

953
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Actress partner, but oh boy.

954
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Now I'm going to be in the rest of this podcast as we, you know, any episode as we go on and on, I'm going to imagine him.

955
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Nobody gives a shit.

956
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:20,000
David the gnome, like not like in the middle of a lesson.

957
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Who the fuck cares about this shit?

958
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Tom Bosley.

959
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,000
It's a ride. You go on it, you move on.

960
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Fuck you.

961
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Father Dowling with a foul mouth.

962
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Father Dowling.

963
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,000
He was Father Dowling.

964
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Yeah, he was Father Dowling.

965
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Scott, if you turn around, you can see the body horror.

966
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Oh, here it is.

967
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Oh yeah, this is kind of where we are narratively.

968
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Oh.

969
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Here's Fuzz.

970
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,000
This is Fuzzbucket.

971
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
We're watching him appear again.

972
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Again, a skeleton face.

973
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:51,000
A little animal, a human that's short of the tail.

974
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
A dinosaur with a human skull.

975
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Yeah.

976
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
I would say like a little dinosaur with a human skull.

977
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
I guess in a human rib cage.

978
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Why the guts step?

979
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Yeah, this is like, yeah, this is he's getting a little bit of like his horror voice out.

980
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,000
So slow.

981
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,000
The slowest is all you've ever seen.

982
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:14,000
It's also exactly like the last scene of the movie Zardoz, where Sean Connery and wife

983
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:18,000
experience all of life through a series of fade shots that don't move.

984
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Right.

985
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,000
They have a baby, the baby gets old, the baby leaves, they get old.

986
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
They have the worst press day experience you've ever seen.

987
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:28,000
They turn into skeletons still holding hands.

988
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Which is not.

989
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,000
And then they're piles of dust.

990
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:35,000
That's not dissimilar to what happened to David the Gnome and his wife.

991
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Wow.

992
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:40,000
That sort of fuzz bucket is just making us stare at this picture of death.

993
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Doesn't say it's not so bad.

994
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Just a couple of fades and it's all over.

995
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,000
It's just near a nice tree.

996
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:52,000
This another big 80s go to for kids entertainment.

997
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,000
This kid has like the most elaborate tree house.

998
00:56:55,000 --> 00:57:00,000
At some point they liked him enough to either get a house with a tree house or build the

999
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
tree house for him.

1000
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,000
It's a very book of Henry.

1001
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,000
I was desperate for a tree house like this.

1002
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,000
And this is just like impossible to build this.

1003
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Yeah.

1004
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Also incredibly dangerous to just climb a rope up to like two stories to a house.

1005
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,000
You'd have a ladder.

1006
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
You'd have to have some sort of a ladder.

1007
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Well, speaking of building the tree house, if we want to jump around a little bit, this

1008
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:30,000
might be a good point to talk about the Michael Eisner intro, which frustratingly is not

1009
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,000
included on Disney Plus, but you can look it up on YouTube.

1010
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:39,000
I'd seen it before and it's wonderful to see Michael Eisner and Mickey and Fuzzbucket

1011
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:47,000
all interacting and in a rare peek behind the curtain, he actually says what sound stage

1012
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:50,000
the set of the tree house is built in.

1013
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:57,000
It's on stage four of the Disney lot, which is the was eventually the home improvement

1014
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,000
stage.

1015
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:01,000
And it's today where Black-ish is filmed.

1016
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:07,000
So if you act or work on Black-ish, remember this was once Fuzzbucket's home.

1017
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:13,000
It was also it was originally it was they actually split stage four eventually into

1018
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
two different sound stages, four and five.

1019
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:20,000
It was originally the hugest sound stage they had and they built it to do force perspective

1020
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
for Darby O'Gill and the little people.

1021
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:27,000
They had a light people, they had people really far away to make them look extremely small.

1022
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
And that took so much light buried deep.

1023
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:33,000
They had needed so much light to pull off this effect that one time while they're filming

1024
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:36,000
that movie, they blew out the power grid for all of Burbank.

1025
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:39,000
The entire city got fucked by Darby O'Gill.

1026
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,000
Wow.

1027
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,000
Also on Disney Plus.

1028
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,000
Worth it.

1029
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Yes.

1030
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,000
One of the finest.

1031
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,000
We'll watch that soon.

1032
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:52,000
The kid has a for the time normal sized TV in the tree house.

1033
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Oh, yes.

1034
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,000
And now.

1035
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,000
OK.

1036
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,000
OK.

1037
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:01,000
So this is where this is one of the first creepy things is the first time we actually

1038
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:05,000
see Fuzzbucket and they're hanging out and we see what their dynamic is like.

1039
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:15,000
And very quickly he Fuzzbucket requests tunes, tunes, tunes, just very upsetting.

1040
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:21,000
And they watch a cartoon together and the cartoon is seat central.

1041
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:27,000
It is nothing but chickens turning around and showing their rears and then they're

1042
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:30,000
watching this and they fall asleep arm in arm.

1043
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,000
Yeah.

1044
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:38,000
So now this has become a movie where a boy and a possum cuddle while watching chicken

1045
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
skirt shots.

1046
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:46,000
I think he likes Fuzzbucket because Fuzzbucket is not openly cruel or dismissive to him,

1047
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,000
unlike most of the other characters in this movie.

1048
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:52,000
But Fuzzbucket still treats him like shit, I would argue.

1049
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
You have to look at it.

1050
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,000
This is some fun.

1051
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:58,000
I was just going to Fuzzbucket to describe if you don't know what he looks like at this

1052
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:03,000
point, he looks like a facially balding Ewok.

1053
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Like if he if an Ewok has started going bald on its face, like that's how Ewoks go bald.

1054
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Yes, skin.

1055
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Yeah.

1056
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:17,000
Wow, you know if you shaved your cat or dog, how awful their skin would look.

1057
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Fuzzbucket, that jump.

1058
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:22,000
That jump is the funniest shit.

1059
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
That's like Mack and Me style.

1060
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,000
It's very Mack and Me.

1061
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:30,000
And that's something I thought while watching this that we all owe Mack and Me a big apology.

1062
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,000
Yeah, yeah.

1063
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:36,000
Because Mack and Me, obviously, if you don't know what this extremely unpleasant E.T. ripoff,

1064
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:41,000
but I found I've I've sat through all Mack and Me several times and there's parts like

1065
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:46,000
obviously the Paul Rudd used a clip on Conan, the wheelchair falling.

1066
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:52,000
There's parts of it that are so much fun or the Mack dancing in a teddy bear suit and McDonald's.

1067
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:55,000
Did you see the clip that was edited out?

1068
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
I said I showed it to Jason.

1069
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:02,000
There's a clip from Mack and Me where he gets shot with like an automatic weapon wheelchair.

1070
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,000
Yeah, there's a standoff.

1071
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,000
The kid.

1072
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,000
The kid.

1073
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,000
What?

1074
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,000
Yeah, I should check.

1075
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,000
He gets shot.

1076
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,000
He gets shot.

1077
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,000
Wait a minute.

1078
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Because I know the movie because there's a huge explosion and then he dies essentially and the alien family

1079
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,000
all has to bring him back to life.

1080
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:19,000
But you don't you don't understand why the fire killed him.

1081
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,000
He gets shot in the gut.

1082
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:26,000
So in the cut in the full scene, he's just shot with the assault rifles.

1083
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Let me see if I can throw this up on. Let's see how easy this will be.

1084
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:31,000
From one unpleasant post E.T. film to another.

1085
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Mack just ran into like Stevie, his sister and her friends.

1086
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,000
They're very E.T.s.

1087
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
I pulled up. Here is the scene from.

1088
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Oh, and now the Mack's parents have guns too.

1089
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Oh, it's the police.

1090
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:48,000
The police have opened fire with handguns and shotguns.

1091
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:51,000
Now the explosion I know, but I always wondered why he dies.

1092
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
Yeah, so there it is again.

1093
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Mack.

1094
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
He gets shot.

1095
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:06,000
And the alien points at the police, but it looks like he's pointing as if he has a weapon.

1096
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,000
He does not.

1097
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:10,000
It's only on the Japanese media release.

1098
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Yeah, so that's the funniest thing I've seen in a long time.

1099
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
Wow. Thank you for that.

1100
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,000
You're welcome.

1101
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:21,000
Geez. Yeah, I do love Mac and Mac and me is in the bizarre.

1102
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:24,000
Have you seen the bizarre trailer with the Ronald McDonald intro?

1103
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
I believe so. Yeah, because they helped produce.

1104
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Ronald, you're needed in makeup.

1105
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Makeup me.

1106
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:36,000
It's the creepy laughter of not unlike your pet.

1107
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Oh, right.

1108
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
That laughter.

1109
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Fuzzbucket hides in the mailbox, which is unpleasant.

1110
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:45,000
Although shout out to the good people of the United States Postal Service.

1111
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,000
They do great work.

1112
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
How did you get into the mailbox?

1113
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Well, apparently he gets in the like latch on the bottom of it.

1114
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:55,000
Like he just got out of it.

1115
01:02:55,000 --> 01:03:06,000
And then, of course, the Mikey gets yelled at by like a homeless man who was there to be just another character to yell at Mikey.

1116
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:15,000
This around this point in time, Aaron, my wife pointed out who liked one thing about the movie, which is that it was 45 minutes.

1117
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
She really lit up when she saw that runtime.

1118
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:24,000
But mainly around here, she asked, well, why, as we've said, why does Mikey like Fuzzbucket?

1119
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Because it seems like as soon as Fuzzbucket comes into his life, nothing but bad things happen.

1120
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
His parents get more unpleasant.

1121
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
He's yelled at by a homeless person.

1122
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
He's brought into the principal's office.

1123
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:39,000
His sister's friends start talking shit about him.

1124
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:42,000
He sees a rat and has to throw a can at it.

1125
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:45,000
It's on our screen right now.

1126
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:51,000
He has to spend the night homeless, essentially like Fuzzbucket causes nothing but shit.

1127
01:03:51,000 --> 01:04:00,000
It's implied by the mom at one point that Mikey does have friends like he's like, I called all his friends houses, but they do not appear to be present.

1128
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:04,000
I guess if this was a pilot for a series, we'd meet more characters.

1129
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:07,000
Presumably would introduce his friends to Fuzzbucket.

1130
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
Who is he dressed like?

1131
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
I'm trying to think there's somebody he's really dressed like right now.

1132
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Fuzzbucket is wearing Elaine Stritch.

1133
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:16,000
It's kind of like the glasses.

1134
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:20,000
I think the glasses are using the glasses and the floppy hat.

1135
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:27,000
The only other Elaine Stritch look is with the long dress shirt with the no pants on or the spanks kind of a look on.

1136
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:30,000
We're in the heart of the worst part of the movie.

1137
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
The most terrifying part.

1138
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:38,000
Mikey had to throw a rat clamped onto Fuzzbucket's tail while he was in a dumpster.

1139
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Mikey threw a can at the rat.

1140
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:47,000
And then Fuzzbucket ran off and for some reason on the way out licks Mikey's hand.

1141
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:50,000
He licks a young boy's hand.

1142
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:53,000
And I have some of the dialogue written down because I don't.

1143
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:57,000
There's a lot of resistance to like, can I come see where you live?

1144
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:03,000
And he's always, no, no house, no, not good for you.

1145
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:08,000
Home going, home going, can't go poof no more.

1146
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:11,000
We're going to talk about, I guess we could talk about his voice real quick.

1147
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Yeah.

1148
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:17,000
My first thought about his voice was, is this Sterling Holloway?

1149
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,000
Yes, me too.

1150
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
This sounds like Winnie the Pooh.

1151
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:26,000
And it is not, but it is of course, and let me look up his name unless you have the name right there.

1152
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,000
Hal Smith.

1153
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Hal Smith, who is owl on Winnie the Pooh.

1154
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,000
Strangely.

1155
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:36,000
Strangely and has done Winnie the Pooh at least once.

1156
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:40,000
Took over as Pooh before Jim Cummings.

1157
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:43,000
He was briefly an 80s Pooh.

1158
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:50,000
And I'm assuming you saw the specific TV movie I'm about to mention, Too Smart for Strangers.

1159
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,000
I did not.

1160
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,000
Pooh and it is.

1161
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Oh, is it the one, the live action one?

1162
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,000
The terror, can you see?

1163
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:59,000
Oh God, it's, of course, that's where I know the voice.

1164
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
Another one of the creepiest things I've ever seen.

1165
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:07,000
Yeah, so like live action Pooh before the Disney Channel live action Pooh?

1166
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,000
Maybe.

1167
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:11,000
Do you know, did you watch Welcome to Pooh Corner?

1168
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
Was that the puppet Pooh?

1169
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:14,000
Yeah.

1170
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,000
They were in suits.

1171
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
It's a lot of like green screen backgrounds.

1172
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:21,000
Kind of, and that was 90s, 80s.

1173
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
What is this Too Smart for Strangers though?

1174
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
Is it like a PSA kind of movie?

1175
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:29,000
It's a PSA type movie that also should be on Disney Plus.

1176
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Yeah.

1177
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,000
Wait, really quick.

1178
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:36,000
Does it, I don't remember the parts offhand, but it's like he has to go into like if someone

1179
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:39,000
touches you in a way you don't want to be.

1180
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:45,000
Yeah, it's like they do real stuff about like getting to, it's, this is a boy.

1181
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:48,000
Pooh Corner is before, is 83.

1182
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:51,000
So when we were watching Pooh Corner, it was obvious, it was old.

1183
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:54,000
When I was watching it on Disney Channel as a kid, it was already old.

1184
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,000
It felt that way to me.

1185
01:06:55,000 --> 01:07:00,000
Most of going to elementary school in the 90s was being taught to reduce, reuse, and

1186
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:06,000
recycle and tell a trusted authority figure if a less trusted authority figure touches

1187
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
you in a weird way.

1188
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:13,000
That was most of public education during the Clinton Bush administration.

1189
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:17,000
Hellsmith was for sure Pooh on that as Pooh Corner as well.

1190
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
God, he's like haunted my brain.

1191
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:26,000
I knew it was, so he's, it is this weird alternative Pooh who only acts in things that involve

1192
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:30,000
like molestation and boy touching.

1193
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Hellsmith has cornered the market on.

1194
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,000
I mean, that is one way to put his career into perspective.

1195
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,000
I mean, not all of it.

1196
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,000
That's unfair.

1197
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:44,000
Just fuzz bucket has a lot of creepy shit and then, and a lot of like meetings of the principal

1198
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:47,000
and then this creepy Pooh special.

1199
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:52,000
He also is, which I'm very excited about, Otis the town drunk on Andy Griffith.

1200
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
Oh, yes, of course.

1201
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:55,000
He did.

1202
01:07:55,000 --> 01:08:02,000
He also apparently was Santa Claus consistently anytime Santa Claus was on the Flintstones,

1203
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
which I guess was a lot.

1204
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
Yeah, I guess.

1205
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
I don't have any memory of that.

1206
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:11,000
According to credits, like he did it in the 60s and 80s.

1207
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:12,000
Really?

1208
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,000
He needed Santa a lot.

1209
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:19,000
When we was, since we mentioned the voice, I just looked, I forgot I wrote down at the top of my second page of notes.

1210
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
His voice is just awful.

1211
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:24,000
Fuck.

1212
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:27,000
Once he appeared, I had a visceral reaction.

1213
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:28,000
Once he started talking.

1214
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:31,000
Go poof.

1215
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:34,000
He was Santa Claus on bonkers as well.

1216
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,000
What?

1217
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,000
Okay.

1218
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:39,000
And in the town Santa on Cartoon Network in 1993.

1219
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:43,000
He was also in Camp Candy, which I believe is a John Candy cartoon.

1220
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
The whole very unpleasant theme song.

1221
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:46,000
Yeah.

1222
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
And then he was in Beauty and the Beast.

1223
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:51,000
He played Jafar's horse in Aladdin.

1224
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:52,000
What?

1225
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,000
Jafar had a horse?

1226
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,000
I guess.

1227
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,000
I don't remember this.

1228
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
And he did owl for a long time.

1229
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:00,000
But then they kicked him out and had Jim Cummings do it.

1230
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,000
Well, it's while you're here.

1231
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,000
It's cheaper.

1232
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,000
I guess.

1233
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
But he's the original owl?

1234
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
I believe so.

1235
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:08,000
From the look of it, 19.

1236
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
Well, when was the first poo?

1237
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:14,000
To the 60s, I think.

1238
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:18,000
Also to go back to the Eisner intro.

1239
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
That's the first I ever heard the voice.

1240
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
And he magically appears.

1241
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:25,000
And then there's this little scene that requires a lot out of Eisner.

1242
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,000
Eisner has to do a cross.

1243
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
He has to get out of the way.

1244
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:31,000
And you can tell physical action is tough for him.

1245
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
And a little acting scene.

1246
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:38,000
But then just forever and ever and not in his usual backwards language,

1247
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:41,000
you just get to hear Fuzzbook kiss Mickey Mouse's ass.

1248
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
Just a total sick of fan.

1249
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:48,000
I've seen all of your movies more times than I could count.

1250
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
The great Mickey Mouse.

1251
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
I watched your show.

1252
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
And Mickey buys it hook line and sinker.

1253
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:55,000
See through this guy.

1254
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
He just wants something out of you.

1255
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:58,000
He's new at the company.

1256
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:01,000
And he knows you're at the top of the food chain.

1257
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
But instead Mickey's just like, sure.

1258
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,000
That's a lunch.

1259
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
We're going to cheese omelet.

1260
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:09,000
And it's clearly the in the bin.

1261
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
It's the same Mickey for sure.

1262
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Off Mickey.

1263
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:15,000
This is not standard issue Mickey.

1264
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
So these two voices combined.

1265
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:22,000
Oh, it's mixed with all.

1266
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:26,000
It's clear that Fuzzbucket is a user.

1267
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,000
Straight up.

1268
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
And they are writing him in that.

1269
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
I actually didn't not see the intro, but it's clear.

1270
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
They're writing the character consistently.

1271
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:34,000
He is a user.

1272
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,000
Fake friend.

1273
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
He's a fake ass friend.

1274
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:40,000
And at least they were consistent, I'll say.

1275
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,000
But Mickey shouldn't.

1276
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:44,000
So you're finding a good valuable lesson for kids.

1277
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
Legitimately on Fuzzbucket.

1278
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:47,000
But they don't really spell that out.

1279
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:48,000
No.

1280
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:53,000
You have to read into the subtext of Fuzzbucket to know this is about like a leech in your life who just wants your connections.

1281
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:58,000
Towards the end of the movie, they have assembled a posse.

1282
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
Like an actual search party.

1283
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,000
Police Rangers.

1284
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:02,000
The fugitive.

1285
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:06,000
They're hunting for like a missing child.

1286
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,000
Outhouse, backhouse.

1287
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
Outhouse, backhouse.

1288
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
Like this is serious.

1289
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
Like our child is missing.

1290
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
We don't know what happened.

1291
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
We might be mentally unwell.

1292
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:20,000
Tommy Lee Jones with a gun at Fuzzbucket.

1293
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
No, no, make me go poof.

1294
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,000
I don't care.

1295
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:24,000
Bang, bang.

1296
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:25,000
I don't care.

1297
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:26,000
Bang, bang.

1298
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:27,000
No, no.

1299
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,000
Don't point metal.

1300
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,000
Bang, bang.

1301
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,000
It's Fuzzbucket.

1302
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
There's also now in that search party part.

1303
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
Sorry to jump around.

1304
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:40,000
But Mikey is found and his ordeal in the cave is over.

1305
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:46,000
And there's a great part where his parents and then some officer you don't know, they're just kind of walking up towards the set of trees.

1306
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:50,000
And then the officer is like, look, there's something.

1307
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
Wait, wait, pan over.

1308
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:55,000
The something is Mikey just lying on the ground.

1309
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
What's that pile of rocks?

1310
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
No, that's the boy.

1311
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:02,000
The boy.

1312
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
Then Fuzzbucket goes for the cops.

1313
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:15,000
I want freedom for fellow Fuzzbucket.

1314
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,000
Yeah.

1315
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:17,000
Grant us amnesty.

1316
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:21,000
Mikey right now, what we're watching is he's underground now.

1317
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
He finds the Fuzzbucket like family.

1318
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
They just live in like tunnels.

1319
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,000
They live in dead man's marsh.

1320
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,000
Dead man's marsh.

1321
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:28,000
No humans go there.

1322
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
A murder of Fuzzbucket.

1323
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:33,000
A group is called a murder of Fuzzbucket.

1324
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:39,000
And then Fuzzbucket is about when Fuzzbucket, so Mikey sees a bunch of the Fuzzbuckets and they all get scared and they run away from each other.

1325
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:44,000
And then he's about to meet Fuzzbucket because he's like very dejected that he hasn't found Fuzzbucket.

1326
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:48,000
And here comes Fuzzbucket with the best line in the movie.

1327
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,000
Oh, what's this?

1328
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
Do you know what I'm talking about?

1329
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:52,000
No, you get this one.

1330
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,000
You know what I'm talking about though, right?

1331
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:54,000
I can't remember.

1332
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
How are we doing, party boy?

1333
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,000
How are we doing, party boy?

1334
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:08,000
Now that's a real cousin of that thing that was that Mickey in drag says, fresh boy.

1335
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
Oh, oh, fresh.

1336
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,000
Oh, yeah.

1337
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
Soak your head, fresh boy.

1338
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,000
Soak your head, fresh boy.

1339
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,000
Yeah, yeah.

1340
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,000
Definitely.

1341
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
Soak your head, fresh boy.

1342
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
Oh my God.

1343
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
How are you doing, party boy?

1344
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
How are we doing, party boy?

1345
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:28,000
Fuck.

1346
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,000
In this, if you were-

1347
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
The rock and roll clown does cocaine.

1348
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:40,000
And we're, he also, or also around this time, he says, use the noodle, fellow.

1349
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:41,000
Yeah.

1350
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,000
Awful.

1351
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:50,000
And if we, this is truly the creepiest zone you've ever seen because it really set the tenor to hear how we doing, party boy.

1352
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:59,000
And then, Mikey, the boy who doesn't want to go back to his home, he wants to stay in the cave with Fuzzbucket and he conveys this by saying, I want to be with you.

1353
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,000
Oh God.

1354
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:02,000
Yes, he says that.

1355
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
It's a say anything feel.

1356
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
I want to be with you.

1357
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:10,000
And then, and the response to that is, aw, funny boy.

1358
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:12,000
Horrible.

1359
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,000
Yeah, horrible.

1360
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:18,000
This is, this film is pornography for the worst person who's ever lived.

1361
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
Like the most disturbed person.

1362
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
Yes, I don't even know.

1363
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:30,000
I don't even have a full picture of that person's brain who would be really, really into this.

1364
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:36,000
This is, okay, so then Fuzzbucket, he's telling him, you can't, look kid, you can't stay here.

1365
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:39,000
You can't, what we had was nice, but you can't stay here.

1366
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
Like that's essentially what he was saying.

1367
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:45,000
And then Mikey is starting to be the saddest kid and he's like, but we were friends, right?

1368
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:46,000
You weren't using me.

1369
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
Yeah, of course.

1370
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
No, we were friends.

1371
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:51,000
We're friends.

1372
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:55,000
No, you can, all right, five years from now you get tonight's your fair and square.

1373
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,000
Yeah.

1374
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
Mikey, tonight's yours, but enjoy it, buddy.

1375
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:59,000
Five years away.

1376
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,000
Nothing's wrong.

1377
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:02,000
Nothing's going to go wrong.

1378
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:03,000
You're a good guy.

1379
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,000
You're a family guy.

1380
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:05,000
You're a family man.

1381
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
Jay Leno is now Fuzzbucket.

1382
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:09,000
Also around this.

1383
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:13,000
You can have the cave after me.

1384
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:15,000
She's all you want.

1385
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:20,000
And then, well, and also, maybe we haven't given enough time to the family.

1386
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:21,000
We haven't.

1387
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,000
I found an article that noted.

1388
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:23,000
We've also got 90 minutes.

1389
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:24,000
I knew we.

1390
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
Well, no, an hour and 15.

1391
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,000
Okay, okay.

1392
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
So longer than the film.

1393
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:30,000
Much longer.

1394
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:34,000
But no, don't, whatever you want to say about the family, I don't have a heart out.

1395
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:38,000
They're called just he calls them Fuzzbuckets, even though his name is Fuzzbucket.

1396
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,000
Right.

1397
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:44,000
So a group of them is is are just they are a Fuzzbucket, I guess.

1398
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:54,000
And then when Mikey sees them for the first time, they're all just marching in place in this bizarre cramped court, which is a whatever they whatever ritual they are doing.

1399
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
Aaron dubbed this buzzfucking.

1400
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
Whatever it is that they're up to.

1401
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:02,000
Yeah.

1402
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:05,000
You caught the boy caught us buzzfucking.

1403
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:06,000
They're horrible.

1404
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:11,000
And then they're like giving him only one of them is named Stinky.

1405
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:12,000
Thank you.

1406
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,000
Which is cute.

1407
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:14,000
I mean, that could be a term.

1408
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,000
Endurance.

1409
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
Jason loves Stinker.

1410
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:18,000
Jason loves Stinky.

1411
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:24,000
New fuck has nicknamed Stinky Stinky Sheridan.

1412
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
And he but Stinky.

1413
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:29,000
All he does is go like he just like glares at Mikey.

1414
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:30,000
Right.

1415
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:36,000
He wants to eat him and Fuzzbucket says others crabby, but OK.

1416
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:41,000
And then how does the kiss come about?

1417
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
You mean Scott this kiss?

1418
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
What's the actual line?

1419
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
Can you maybe put on the audio for me?

1420
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:51,000
I'll turn the audio off.

1421
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:52,000
Hold on.

1422
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:55,000
So if you weren't creeped out enough already.

1423
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:58,000
Yes, the little boy and the possum monster kiss.

1424
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:01,000
Sorry.

1425
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:02,000
We're just listening to this.

1426
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,000
Oh, I see.

1427
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
Stinky sucks.

1428
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
Stinky bad apple.

1429
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:36,000
Oh, no, I didn't know he was a bad apple.

1430
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:37,000
OK.

1431
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:38,000
OK.

1432
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
You love Fuzzbucket?

1433
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
Give smooch.

1434
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
You love Fuzzbucket.

1435
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:47,000
Give smooch.

1436
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:48,000
You love Fuzzbucket.

1437
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:49,000
You love Fuzzbucket.

1438
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
Here's what I thought just now.

1439
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:55,000
I have the words you give Fuzzbucket, give smooch written down in my notes.

1440
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:58,000
And I was like, is that an idea for a bit or something I wanted to do?

1441
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
No, those are the lines in the film.

1442
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
You love me?

1443
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,000
How much do you love me?

1444
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:04,000
Show me you love me.

1445
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
Prove, show me your love.

1446
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:07,000
Oh, God.

1447
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:08,000
Put some love on me.

1448
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:09,000
Horrible.

1449
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:10,000
What does he say about his eyes, too?

1450
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
Baby blues, right?

1451
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:13,000
Didn't he say baby blues?

1452
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:14,000
Yeah, he did.

1453
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:15,000
I know.

1454
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:16,000
He's getting over the context.

1455
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:17,000
Oh, my God.

1456
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:25,000
Again, that you are a parent and your child is an actor and you let him near a John Landis

1457
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:26,000
movie.

1458
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:28,000
I mean, come on now.

1459
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,000
Come on now.

1460
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:32,000
Yeah, I.

1461
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:33,000
Yeah.

1462
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:34,000
All right.

1463
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:35,000
He got off on that.

1464
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:36,000
He wasn't.

1465
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:39,000
He was acquitted of manslaughter, but he should have been banned from having any children

1466
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,000
on his set.

1467
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:41,000
Yes.

1468
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:44,000
And he said every and probably should have been banned from having children.

1469
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
That's another matter.

1470
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:47,000
Horrible.

1471
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:48,000
Horrible.

1472
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:49,000
I.

1473
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:55,000
He's the journey of this boy in 45 minutes from a principal talking to him about showering

1474
01:18:55,000 --> 01:19:03,000
to he's trapped in a cave where a creature is making him kiss him where a possum creature

1475
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:04,000
blows him off.

1476
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:07,000
You know, but first makes him kiss.

1477
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:08,000
Gotta go.

1478
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
No, we can't hang out, but kiss me, though.

1479
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:11,000
They get over it.

1480
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:12,000
He's trying enough.

1481
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:18,000
He tries to fuzz bucket, tries to ghost him, first of all.

1482
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:24,000
And then when he finally tracks him down, he's like, yeah, yeah, we're friends.

1483
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
Hey, kiss me and then leave.

1484
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
Fuzz bucket's a fuck boy.

1485
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,000
Yes.

1486
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:30,000
Damn fuck boy.

1487
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:31,000
He's a friend.

1488
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:32,000
Fuck boy.

1489
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:33,000
Yeah.

1490
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:34,000
That's true.

1491
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:35,000
Fuzz Buck's a fuck boy.

1492
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:40,000
Oh, I was going to say fuck bucket.

1493
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,000
I don't like it.

1494
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:42,000
I don't like it.

1495
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:49,000
You know what they should call me.

1496
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:56,000
Is this the most unpleasant thing we've talked about on the Patreon?

1497
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,000
Maybe.

1498
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
What's worse than this?

1499
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:02,000
Well, the paddling, the paddle coming for your ass.

1500
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
Yeah, but that's not unpleasant.

1501
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:05,000
I guess.

1502
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,000
I don't, I didn't care for it.

1503
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:10,000
Well, of course, in the Las Vegas story where you were worried there was a paddle coming

1504
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,000
for your ass.

1505
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:12,000
I mean, maybe that.

1506
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:17,000
From the stern female owner of the German.

1507
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:18,000
The Ubermensch.

1508
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:22,000
There has been.

1509
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:23,000
Oh, sorry.

1510
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:27,000
What is the same when Jason threw $20 on the table and said, I got to get out of here

1511
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:30,000
because he was too high and he was worried about a woman paddling.

1512
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
A sausage sandwich.

1513
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
That's why I got to get out of here.

1514
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
Like, this is too much.

1515
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:37,000
It was too big.

1516
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,000
You had to pay for the paddling.

1517
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:42,000
She wasn't going to paddle you without like a monetary exchange.

1518
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
A lot to figure out if you're high.

1519
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:45,000
Yeah.

1520
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:50,000
I mean, I think watching Fuzzbook, it probably made you feel as stressed out and paranoid

1521
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:54,000
as being trapped in a beer hall where a woman was going to paddle you.

1522
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
It's a, it's a trap.

1523
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:57,000
This movie is a trap.

1524
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:58,000
Man, this.

1525
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:01,000
It really makes Mr. Boogity look good.

1526
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:05,000
It makes the Apple dumpling gang look like Citizen Kane.

1527
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
Like I was at the record show.

1528
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:10,000
Like Apple, people have positive memories of Apple dumpling gang.

1529
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:13,000
Don Knotts, Tim Conway, esteemed careers.

1530
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:16,000
Like I think that's a different ballpark.

1531
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:17,000
That's a different genre.

1532
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
I would agree with you.

1533
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
Disney plus first came out.

1534
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:24,000
I was like, Oh guys, remember Apple dumpling gang?

1535
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
And yes, we respect the Apple dumpling gang.

1536
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
We respect the Apple dumpling gang.

1537
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
I respect Boogity.

1538
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:33,000
Yeah, Boogity I thought was pretty fun.

1539
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:37,000
And I ended up liking the performance and the guy and even the stuff that happens in the interim.

1540
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:41,000
This is just 45 minutes of horror.

1541
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:45,000
There is more 45 minutes ones on Disney plus.

1542
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,000
Are there?

1543
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
I think there's other ones.

1544
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:51,000
Well, if you want us to watch anything else, 45 minutes helps.

1545
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:52,000
Oh, it really does.

1546
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:53,000
Yeah.

1547
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:54,000
45 minutes to an hour.

1548
01:21:54,000 --> 01:22:03,000
Oh, and you know what got the most likes I should say is the, the Mickey Mouse short potato land, which, you know, which thanks for the suggestion.

1549
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:04,000
I watched it.

1550
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:05,000
It's wonderful.

1551
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
I remember Lindsay telling me about it a while back.

1552
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:08,000
It's really great.

1553
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,000
It's a lot of fun.

1554
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:16,000
You know, there's not 90 minutes worth of nightmares to describe with the very good theme park referencing potato land.

1555
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
Yeah, I do recommend potato land.

1556
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:19,000
Sure.

1557
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
Maybe we should have though.

1558
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
Maybe there's still time.

1559
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:28,000
I'm trying to think if anything else in that tweet, because we got a list.

1560
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:35,000
Nick, who suggested this, gave us a list, like a big list of reasons why we should consider this one.

1561
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
I do want to make sure I hit the list.

1562
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:38,000
We hit a lot of them.

1563
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:39,000
I mean, we did.

1564
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:42,000
This is a yeah, this is just a legitimate search party.

1565
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
They do find the kid.

1566
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:45,000
They find Mikey.

1567
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:46,000
Again, I cannot.

1568
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:50,000
Yeah, the mom, the mom in this is like nothing to do.

1569
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:53,000
And the last bit is that.

1570
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:56,000
Oh, the parents, right?

1571
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
Well, they get gifts.

1572
01:22:58,000 --> 01:22:59,000
Oh, yes. Yeah.

1573
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:00,000
Yeah.

1574
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,000
Yeah.

1575
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:02,000
So fuzz bucket.

1576
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
So yeah, basically they all go home.

1577
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:14,000
When the parents find gifts in the house for them and it's what the gifts are, what again, nicely do they open them?

1578
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:22,000
It's a like a music box and a novelty sized Hershey kiss.

1579
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
But nicely wrapped, right?

1580
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
It's just a foil of a kiss.

1581
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:27,000
OK, I see.

1582
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:30,000
I don't know how the music box was wrapped, if it was.

1583
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:37,000
But yeah, he buys Phantom presents for this fighting couple and they neither of them question where did this come from?

1584
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:40,000
They just look at each other and gaze at each other and kiss.

1585
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:47,000
And then there's eerie green footprints on the carpet and he's running out the window.

1586
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
I like it from behind.

1587
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
They don't believe fuzz bucket exists.

1588
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:57,000
So the idea that some stranger came into our bedroom and gave us gifts and they're just like, haha.

1589
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
But I think they did it for each other.

1590
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:02,000
Now, I miss that.

1591
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:03,000
I see.

1592
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:04,000
I think it's happening.

1593
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:05,000
I see.

1594
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:06,000
You do love me.

1595
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
You know, I like big chocolate.

1596
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:09,000
Wow.

1597
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:10,000
And that's music.

1598
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:14,000
So chocolate isn't a good way.

1599
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:20,000
Jason, Jason, you'd rather have a bunch of small kisses instead of having a gnawed giant.

1600
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:27,000
Well, you know, that's one of the issues with the chocolate frogs at Harry Potter is it's just a giant chunk of solid milk chocolate.

1601
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:31,000
It's a novelty and a novelty isn't going to put a marriage back together.

1602
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:35,000
Yeah, they're going to have to scrub the toxic goo waste out of the carpet.

1603
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:39,000
They're all going to get like the fights are going to begin instantly from fuzz.

1604
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
Is he bleeding?

1605
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:42,000
The way he walks.

1606
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:43,000
He's got himself.

1607
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:46,000
Is he bleeding?

1608
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:50,000
Fuzz bucket's green blood is bleeding out the bottom of his feet as he goes on the carpet.

1609
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
Bleed from foot.

1610
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:53,000
Bleed.

1611
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:54,000
Blood's bleeding.

1612
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:55,000
Bleed for you.

1613
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:56,000
Bleed cut me.

1614
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
And coming up next, Mr. Boogity.

1615
01:24:58,000 --> 01:24:59,000
All right.

1616
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:04,000
Well, and you know, notably it is the I can't believe I recognize the Landis font.

1617
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
All of his things are the same font.

1618
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:07,000
Interesting.

1619
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:11,000
So that's mainly because I don't really sense his stamp on it in any other way.

1620
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:14,000
But I but good job standardizing the font.

1621
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
Mike, scroll down to suggest it.

1622
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:17,000
What's that second one in?

1623
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
I read about this one.

1624
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:22,000
It's the ghost of Buckley Hall.

1625
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:25,000
It's about.

1626
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:30,000
OK, so this is from 1980, even though it looks like it's from 1960.

1627
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:36,000
Ghost inhabiting a cast strapped Academy enlists the help of a shy cadet.

1628
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:39,000
Now, this is an hour and 32 minutes.

1629
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
This is a full feature.

1630
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:48,000
And 1980, if you think about the world in 1980, this this looks like a ancient,

1631
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:49,000
ancient movie.

1632
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:50,000
20s.

1633
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:53,000
So who wants ghosts of Buckley Hall?

1634
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:54,000
Let us know.

1635
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
Hashtag bucks us up.

1636
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
I got a little for case busters.

1637
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:04,000
Also, I've watched Sultan in the Rockstar yet.

1638
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:08,000
Oh, gentle tiger being hunted for sport.

1639
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
See details for advisory.

1640
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
What in the heck?

1641
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:14,000
47 minutes. Let me add this.

1642
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
Another 47 minutes.

1643
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:17,000
Go to details.

1644
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:18,000
What is the advisory?

1645
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:19,000
Oh, oh, yeah.

1646
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:23,000
That's spot on Disney Plus where it's like outdated cultural depictions.

1647
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:24,000
Uh huh.

1648
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,000
What are they warning us about?

1649
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:28,000
From his fans and obligations to hide out on what appears to be an island

1650
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:29,000
paradise.

1651
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:33,000
When he arrives, he discovers a tame tiger living in the jungle and befriends it,

1652
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:37,000
but then learns that the island's cruel owner is hunting it for sport.

1653
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
Will you risk it all to save this gentle beast?

1654
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
Contains tobacco depictions.

1655
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:42,000
That's it.

1656
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:43,000
That's all.

1657
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:44,000
Yep.

1658
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:45,000
Unbelievable.

1659
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:46,000
Timothy Hutton.

1660
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:47,000
Wow.

1661
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:48,000
Timothy Hutton.

1662
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:51,000
They should have had the cigarettes out of the tiger's mouth.

1663
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:52,000
Oh my God.

1664
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:53,000
What is can of worms?

1665
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:54,000
I don't know.

1666
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:57,000
I think maybe a Disney 99.

1667
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:00,000
This is a scary ass fucking worm.

1668
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,000
He's cool.

1669
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
He is cool, but he's also scary.

1670
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
Um, yeah.

1671
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:08,000
So there's a lot of like Pillsbury.

1672
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
I would do.

1673
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:13,000
I would do a plus this up again, as unpleasant as this was.

1674
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:14,000
Yeah.

1675
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
I think this is an interesting little experiment.

1676
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:19,000
There's maybe something that I don't want to tilt the scales is maybe something to meet

1677
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:20,000
the details.

1678
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:23,000
People were making a good case about case busters, ironically.

1679
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
Uh, so I don't know.

1680
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
Maybe let's maybe we'll do it again.

1681
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:30,000
Just look out on Twitter if we do it again.

1682
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:39,000
Um, but for now, uh, as fuzz bucket would say, how many clocks, how many clocks, which

1683
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:42,000
means, uh, times, times out.

1684
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:45,000
I'm declaring it is no, I'm not talking about this anymore.

1685
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:46,000
Yikes.

1686
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:47,000
I can't believe we did.

1687
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:50,000
We had that much to say, but I think we needed the therapy.

1688
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:51,000
Yeah.

1689
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:52,000
Just like the parents.

1690
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:55,000
As long as fuzz bucket more pleasant.

1691
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
We'll bring back.

1692
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:02,000
Uh, we will again, we are always saying how available we are, but we are available to

1693
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:05,000
bring fuzz bucket back to Disney plus still.

1694
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:06,000
Yes.

1695
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:11,000
You still want to do this IP, uh, for this bit that I've started here.

1696
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:12,000
Yes.

1697
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
I'll do for the bit, but I will say this.

1698
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:20,000
Uh, I have a big threshold for characters and finding them pleasant that other people

1699
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:21,000
might find unpleasant.

1700
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
Uh, I do hate fuzz bucket.

1701
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:24,000
He does suck.

1702
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:27,000
He fuzz bucket sucks.

1703
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
Well, we'll keep talking about this.

1704
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:30,000
We all hit the showers.

1705
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:34,000
I know you two are nervous, but you'll get over it soon enough.

1706
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:35,000
Yeah.

1707
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:40,000
You nervous about what the other podcast hosts might say and what they might look like down

1708
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:41,000
there.

1709
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:42,000
Calm down.

1710
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:43,000
You'll get over it.

1711
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:44,000
They all do.

1712
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:45,000
All right.

1713
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:52,000
If somehow you desire to stay subscribed to podcast, you paid for this.

1714
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:55,000
And when you just heard, you paid for it.

1715
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:56,000
You made us do this.

1716
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:57,000
This is entire you.

1717
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
This is what us rot.

1718
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:00,000
Enjoy it.

1719
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:03,000
They're not all the gruff hours for you kids.

1720
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:07,000
So enjoy it, but enjoy the next stretch of unpleasantness.

1721
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
Tell your friends to sign up for this.

1722
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:10,000
Make them suffer too.

1723
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:11,000
It's these guys.

1724
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
They talk about awful shit.

1725
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:14,000
All right.

1726
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:15,000
Bye bye.

1727
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:16,000
You survived by the second gate.
