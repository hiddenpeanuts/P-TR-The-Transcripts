1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:01,580
Forever!

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:03,620
Dog!

3
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:12,040
Audience, audience, when we last left the Good Boys, they were ripped apart from each other and scattered into different corners of the multiverse.

4
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:21,760
The only way they can fix the dimensional rift and reunite is to record separate solo podcasts about stuff at malls next to theme parks.

5
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:26,060
We take you now to Scott's End of the Multiverse.

6
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:32,000
La Nuba Boys.

7
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,900
La Nuba Boys.

8
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:48,700
Bonjour and welcome to La Nuba Boys, the only podcast that offers weekly analysis of Cirque du Soleil's 1998 to 2017 show at downtown Disney Orlando, La Nuba.

9
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:54,620
I am your ringmaster, Scott Gardner, joined as always by Le Fou, the Fool.

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,440
Just kidding, just messing around with you, you know I love you.

11
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:02,400
Buzz, buzz, buzz, the Prince of Jesters here, the Bugmane.

12
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:04,720
You walked right into it, you proved my point.

13
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:10,220
Bugmane is here, back for more La Nuba talk, it's us the La Nuba Boys, what's going on?

14
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:17,460
Welcome back, obviously La Nuba is an unforgettable journey through our universe, at once threatening and exhilarating, frightening and familiar, La Nuba is the story of all stories.

15
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:22,120
You know we talk about it every week, the site of all mysteries is La Nuba, that is within the theater.

16
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:34,440
The site of La Nuba is where dreams and nightmares for a brief period of time, 19 years, slept side by side in this theater, nightly, dazzling audiences.

17
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:38,420
Absolutely, not only nightly but dazzling.

18
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:41,280
There was never a night that it didn't dazzle.

19
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:47,100
If that ever happened, I'm sure they would have shut this thing down in a heartbeat, but they kept that standard up, it never didn't dazzle.

20
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:54,040
And the thing about it is it beckons to us, it beckons to us, it challenges us to uncover passions we thought we'd lost long ago.

21
00:01:54,480 --> 00:02:03,080
Basically, if you're imagining you're in Orlando and you've never even seen something so earth shattering.

22
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:08,000
You maybe have never seen a circus, you've maybe never been to an art gallery.

23
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:16,140
You've never left America, you don't know about these cultural things that are happening, you don't know about the Blue Man Group, you don't know about David Fincher commercials,

24
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:31,340
the movie Toys with Robin Williams, you don't know about these very artistic things until Disney through the lens of Cirque du Soleil delivered it to you in La Nuba and with the DVD delivered it in mass.

25
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,840
Then to the world.

26
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:54,600
I don't like these podcasts that become this dense web of references that you don't really understand and you don't really have an in on so it's hard for new people to come in.

27
00:02:54,880 --> 00:03:03,220
So I do like to explain the basics of La Nuba, which of course from 1998 to 2017 performed at downtown Disney.

28
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:08,880
And I became first aware of it on a trip to Walt Disney World, which was fine.

29
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:16,660
I'm not particularly interested in theme parks, but I remember being bored in the hotel room thinking I go there's more of this Disney World trip to get through.

30
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:23,000
And then there's an ad for the things that you can go do at downtown Disney at downtown Disney's west side.

31
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,820
And it's this clip.

32
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:30,560
I like to replay this whenever I can just to recall how La Nuba first spoke to me.

33
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:38,880
The Cirque du Soleil show La Nuba is a remarkably unique family experience unlike any other on the planet.

34
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:48,020
Where feats of physical bearing and acrobatics meet the artistry of live music, magical effects and awesome design.

35
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,560
You've got to see it to believe it.

36
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:57,240
I mean, that says it all.

37
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:08,760
I mean, you get so much in that 22 seconds you get if we just analyze it first, you're going to be in the big tent and the free standing structure that they built just for this at downtown Disney.

38
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,540
Disney has its castle, whatever with its spires.

39
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:18,760
But if that doesn't speak to you, then what is your version of the castle going to be?

40
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:22,920
And for me, the just the gleaming white of the La Nuba tent.

41
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,220
That was my cat.

42
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:34,160
It's sort of a euro minded artistically minded alternative for the Disney castle was the La Nuba tent, which spoke to like the kids who were weird.

43
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:40,040
You know, if you felt like a weird kid, kind of more interested in culture and nuance and enrichment.

44
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:44,180
I mean, I was a kid that grew up loving Renee Magritte.

45
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:51,800
And to finally reach that age where, OK, enough with the kids toys and the Cinderella's and the Peter Pan's.

46
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:54,160
It's time to get cultural.

47
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:54,880
It's time to.

48
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,820
I was such a Magritte kid.

49
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,340
We talked about this the first day before the podcast, and we were just doing the podcast just for fun out loud.

50
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:03,740
And we hadn't actually started the thing yet.

51
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,000
And who could have dreamed of the success that we would end up having?

52
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,040
I mean, you know, so many so much so much great support.

53
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:15,500
So many people subscribing to the La Nuba boys do play on the Patreon.

54
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:16,420
Still Nation.

55
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:32,420
And in that space where La Nuba briefly existed and on October 22nd, 2004,

56
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:46,580
they filmed the staged live performance for the DVD, probably one of the most banner and finest sites in French artistic and experimental theater.

57
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:47,960
Yes, of course.

58
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:56,820
And as always, we suggest and encourage you to consult your own copy of the La Nuba Pro Shot DVD from October 2004.

59
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:00,560
And we'll be reflecting on a particular element of that.

60
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,400
And again, not to be redundant is this episode 48.

61
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:04,560
So you know what we do.

62
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:13,460
But every week on this show, we do rate and review a different sequence, moment or act from La Nuba Cirque du Soleil's finest show.

63
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,660
There's a quote in this commercial.

64
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,740
This was the TV ad for La Nuba, which has a quote that is that is really striking.

65
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:23,560
And I just want to get, you know, get your thoughts on this.

66
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:27,180
Cirque du Soleil presents La Nuba.

67
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:39,500
Now astounding audiences at the downtown Disney West Side to see it is to know the color of imagination to see it is to know the color of imagination.

68
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,580
Is that not how it makes you feel?

69
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,620
Even just watching the DVD.

70
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,780
So La Nuba is almost a new color.

71
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:49,580
It's a new kind of and the thing you can watch La Nuba.

72
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,820
Let's just be a little respectful.

73
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:56,540
Obviously, you don't want to wear your Disney Mickey ears to La Nuba when you're going to see it.

74
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:00,640
We're in an artist's world, but we're not so stuffy.

75
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:04,160
That was what was so beautiful about it and the performance in 2004.

76
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:05,640
It's not so stuffy.

77
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:13,840
You're not going to, you know, some actual European art exhibition with tuxedos and champagne.

78
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:15,260
No, it's not elite.

79
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,520
It's extremely accessible.

80
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:17,540
Yes, exactly.

81
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,900
It's inclusive.

82
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,620
Basically, just kind of wear a collared shirt.

83
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,000
Wear your nicest collared shirt.

84
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,080
And that's what you see when you watch the DVD.

85
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:32,340
And as always, we encourage you to watch the DVD or if for some reason you don't have a copy of the DVD, you can go on YouTube.

86
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:38,660
There is the video Cirque du Soleil La Nuba, Subtitulada, then space and then AVI.

87
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:41,000
I guess that was the that was the file name.

88
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:45,340
But if you, you know, if you're just coming into the show for the first time, go look it up.

89
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,640
It's about 90 minutes.

90
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,120
It's a breezy 90 minutes.

91
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:51,800
Just watch the full pro shot version of La Nuba from 2004.

92
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:56,680
And in that you're going to see these audience members see what they were wearing at the time.

93
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,120
You'll see their nice collared shirts.

94
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:02,880
You'll see their golf resort hats, their band in dune hats, their van dykes.

95
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:03,380
Yeah.

96
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:07,780
A few van dykes, tiny spectacles, tiny glasses.

97
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:11,060
James Taylor post 1999 glasses.

98
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:17,780
It is they cut to audience members of at least the older men in the audience all look like plaid era eagles.

99
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:21,780
They all look like hell freezes over hell freezes over eagles or better.

100
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:26,420
Ben Affleck and Chasing Amy and in their heads, plaids, bowling shirts.

101
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:31,500
Every one of their heads holds the memories of 9-11 in the 2004 DVD.

102
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,520
Even the children.

103
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:33,760
And guess what?

104
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:38,120
Like I was saying, they are their bowling shirts are nice bowling shirts that they're wearing.

105
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,980
They chose their best bowling shirt.

106
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,380
They're choosing at this time.

107
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:45,740
You have to remember in the early 2000s bowling shirt penetration is full.

108
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:51,440
So these young men are looking at a closet of probably a dozen bowling shirts.

109
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,680
They pick their finest one.

110
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,480
And they yeah and they do they know this.

111
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:58,480
Yeah, this is I can't do like the silly yellow one with the Hawaiian pattern.

112
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,280
This has to be kind of an austere maroon and black.

113
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:08,420
Something that shows a little bit of respect to these Frenchmen and their artistry and their dignitaries.

114
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:12,880
They come ambassadors, ambassadors I was going to say of culture.

115
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,720
Of culture to us.

116
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,660
But we also have to show up and give our best.

117
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:19,340
You know, these are our best applause, our best smiles, our best laughs at the clowns.

118
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,280
Our best Van Dykes, our best bowling shirts.

119
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,640
Always our best Van Dykes.

120
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:28,340
And you know, these are people in the audience that are fans of hitman comedies.

121
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:34,940
The year is 2004 and they and they you know, they love lucky number seven and they love you know,

122
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:37,420
They love to get shorty and they can't wait for be cool.

123
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,780
They can't wait for.

124
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,700
Yeah, they even saw Big Trouble.

125
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:41,320
Yeah.

126
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,300
To be perfectly honest.

127
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,200
Yeah, even despite.

128
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,960
They even saw Big Trouble after the delay.

129
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:51,260
Big Trouble showed fear where La Nubia showed bravery.

130
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,020
Big Trouble changed their ending.

131
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:53,880
They didn't back down.

132
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:54,820
Yeah, they didn't.

133
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:55,720
And they kept going.

134
00:09:55,820 --> 00:10:01,600
You know, there was La Nubia was performing on September 10th and then I don't know when they came back after September 11th.

135
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,940
But I bet it was by the end of the month.

136
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:03,680
That much I know.

137
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,540
You know, they didn't say we're done.

138
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,600
We're going back to France.

139
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:10,360
They stayed in Florida because that's what Giuliani wanted.

140
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,460
That's what George W.

141
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,080
Bush wanted.

142
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:16,160
And, you know, our finest cultural institutions had to keep going.

143
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,200
And La Nubia, the finest, did.

144
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:24,260
There's old men in Orlando, Florida, who have just paid $500 and drank a double Jack and Coke,

145
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:32,700
wearing Hellfreeses over plaid shirts and James Taylor tiny glasses with their brother in a Van Dyke and bowling shirt.

146
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:38,440
Inside of their brains are the memories of 9-11 and Barry Sonnenfeld hitman comedies.

147
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:47,720
And they're going to get their mind blown and exposed to European sensibilities on that night of October 22nd in 2004.

148
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,260
And they're going to like it.

149
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:53,420
Also, an olive branch to the French people in general.

150
00:10:53,540 --> 00:11:00,780
At the time, we're talking about freedom fries, not French fries, because of their perceived cowardice.

151
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,500
It's a cliche.

152
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,820
Yeah, it's a cliche.

153
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:03,320
Wow.

154
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:05,680
We are rejecting French culture in a big way.

155
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:14,400
And what better way as an ambassador to France than their other great cliche art?

156
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:24,980
You know, Scott, La Nubia takes you to a new realm where dreams and nightmares collide and your fantasies reach new heights.

157
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,440
Another way to reach new heights is with today's sponsor, Bluechew.

158
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,580
Absolutely, Bug.

Increase your performance and get that extra confidence in bed with Bluechew,

160
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:37,900
the first chewable with the same FDA approved active ingredients as Viagra and Cialis.

161
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:40,580
You can take them any time, day or night, even on a full stomach.

162
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:43,400
And since they're chewable, they work up to twice as fast as pill.

163
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,440
So you can be ready whenever an opportunity arises.

164
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,940
Bluechew is prescribed online by licensed physicians.

165
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:58,300
So you don't have to go to the doctor's office or wait in line at the pharmacy.

166
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:01,220
And it ships right to your door in a discreet package.

167
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:05,760

Bluechew is the better, cheaper, faster choice.

178
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,820
And we thank them for sponsoring La Nubia boys.

179
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:32,560
S'il ménifique.

180
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:45,580
You know, I shudder to think of if there was an alternate universe where La Nubia hadn't hit as hard as it did in ours.

181
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:53,600
I shudder to imagine a world where La Nubia doesn't get the respect that it deserves.

182
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:59,600
And people listen to podcasts not about this, but about trash.

183
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:00,860
Just like garbage.

184
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:01,280
Yeah, exactly.

185
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:06,160
It's infinitely dissecting subjects that no one can care less about, to be perfectly honest.

186
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:12,020
That are fluff, that are hollow, as opposed to what we get to do, which is revisit La Nubia again and again.

187
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:17,900
And, you know, some fools, le-fooze, think that it might get bore-ele-foo.

188
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,220
I said it.

189
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,520
I'm not afraid to say it.

190
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,760
You might think that this podcast would run its course.

191
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,140
That you could only do one of these and then you'd be done.

192
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:30,540
But we keep finding new angles on La Nubia, new information about it.

193
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:33,440
Bug, I've been dying to tell you about this.

194
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,720
I finally, I've been meaning to.

195
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:45,120
I watched the 1999 Bravo hour-long profile of Cirque du Soleil, which is of course called Run Before You Fly.

196
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:52,640
And I learned a little bit of information about how La Nubia came to be and how it showed up at the Walt Disney World.

197
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,180
Oh, wow.

198
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:58,420
Now, you know, we're a little, we're kind of invested in full Cirque du Soleil history.

199
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:06,220
And this was, of course, you know, the mid-90s where they had just done their big show by the Santa Monica Pier at the pop-up tent.

200
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:09,520
And that was causing all kinds of Hollywood interest.

201
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,140
And we've been through this before.

202
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:18,100
But, you know, that's when they almost signed the deal with Columbia Pictures that Columbia Pictures was going to make a full Cirque du Soleil movie.

203
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:23,620
When they showed up on our shores, it was with a bang to be perfectly honest.

204
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:29,480
Honestly, in a nonviolent way, the equivalent of Godzilla showing up on the shore in Tokyo.

205
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,000
Exactly.

206
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:30,960
Or Pearl Harbor.

207
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:31,960
Yes.

208
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:32,200
Yeah.

209
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,080
It was like an inverse Pearl Harbor that was for good.

210
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,140
Yeah, that was for good.

211
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:39,920
And that they didn't cower and run away from the fight.

212
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,820
They were the ones bringing it.

213
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,280
But artistically and culturally.

214
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:43,520
Yes.

215
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:43,760
Yeah.

216
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:49,100
So, of course, who catches wind of Cirque du Soleil?

217
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:52,240
We got to do something with Cirque du Soleil, the Walt Disney Company.

218
00:14:52,680 --> 00:15:02,860
Michael Eisner, full context, since we never really talked about him on this show, he at the time was the CEO and chairman of the Walt Disney Company, like through the 90s and 2000s.

219
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:03,880
You might have heard of him.

220
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,380
So he saw Cirque du Soleil in Santa Monica.

221
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:09,500
We have to lock this down.

222
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:12,460
Can we get this a presence in Walt Disney World?

223
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:13,800
They were interested.

224
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:19,860
Guy LaLiberté, who again, just to orient people, just so this podcast is always accessible.

225
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:33,700
Guy LaLiberté, the founder of Cirque du Soleil, who was a homeless busker and stilt walker and fire eater and is today, due to his Cirque du Soleil profits, the 11th richest Canadian worth $1.

226
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,920
2 billion in Canada's first space tourist.

227
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,320
I'm sorry to say all this again.

228
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:38,700
I know you know all this bug.

229
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,160
You know all about Guy LaLiberté.

230
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:53,340
No, what I didn't know though was I didn't really know to draw the direct line to Michael Eisner being the patient zero of the hell freezes over dad being completely inundated with culture and blowing his mind.

231
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,780
He was the ultimate hell freezes over dad.

232
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:58,040
He was the perfect patient zero.

233
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:04,880
If you look at him, if you look at a photo of him at that time, he does look like James Taylor, but with less wild hair.

234
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:08,740
He absolutely he was like maybe the most powerful James Taylor type.

235
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,220
Yeah, in Hollywood.

236
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:10,700
Yes.

237
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,200
First of all, never knew this.

238
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:13,940
He wanted to buy the company.

239
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,200
He almost bought Cirque du Soleil outright.

240
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,060
Guy LaLiberté said absolutely not.

241
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:19,680
Integrity.

242
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,140
Yes, he has integrity, as we know.

243
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,540
It's what made him the 11th richest Canadian.

244
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,500
So then it became all right.

245
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,840
Well, can we do a show?

246
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,260
Can we do something at Walt Disney World?

247
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:39,520
And you guys point there and the biggest sticking point in the negotiation was Disney not wanting to give over full creative control artistic freedom to Cirque and Guy.

248
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:42,700
And ultimately you have to take a leap of faith when you're dealing with Guy.

249
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,940
Why do the deal?

250
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,060
Don't even talk to Guy if you're not going to do the leap of faith.

251
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:49,740
And ultimately that is what Eisner realized.

252
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:57,280
And he personally intervened and said there's no reason to do this unless we give them it would be like asking Guy to not eat fire.

253
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,360
Absolutely.

254
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:02,920
You don't look at a fire eater and tell him today for breakfast is a bagel.

255
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,260
So listen to this quote from Michael Eisner again for context.

256
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:13,740
It's like asking Guy to not have oxygen in his in his lungs or fire in his belly.

257
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:16,820
His belly belongs on fire.

258
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,920
That is that's that's what Guy LaLiberté is about.

259
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,400
So here's this is quote Michael Eisner.

260
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:47,560
The Hollywood people are used to he was a pussycat.

261
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,760
Amen.

262
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:56,860
I'm glad a Hollywood great that he he compares correctly.

263
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:01,200
Finally, Guy LaLiberté to Lucas and Spielberg.

264
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,340
I'm glad he actually came to his senses.

265
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:04,880
Yeah.

266
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,760
And rationalized it with his friends.

267
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:16,060
And gave them the artistic freedom, which led to why we're sitting here today.

268
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:23,660
We wouldn't be sitting here today without James Taylor, Dad, patient zero, Michael Eisner taking a leap of faith.

269
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:24,340
Take it.

270
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:29,340
Taking a leap of faith after taking a double Jack and Coke and drinking it.

271
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:40,200
I also then there's this piece of footage from the Bravo documentary where this is going to as you as a fan, you're going to go nuts because I'll just ruin the first frame of it.

272
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:46,600
This is Guy LaLiberté on a motorcycle driving through downtown Disney.

273
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,360
And you can see you're not see you.

274
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,340
Hey, you could do whatever the fuck you want if you're Guy LaLiberté.

275
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,600
That's Guy for you.

276
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,200
He doesn't just ignore stop signs.

277
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,960
He ignores ignores every sign.

278
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,040
This guy, you know, he sees a sign.

279
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:04,460
He takes a gulp of fire from his fire belly and he burns that sign up.

280
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:04,760
Yeah.

281
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,460
Guy sees a stop sign.

282
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,820
He goes.

283
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,240
He reads it as he reads it as he has flipped his own brain.

284
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,020
So here he is.

285
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:20,200
And he's driving on a motorcycle past the Virgin Megastore, past the Disney Quest.

286
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,820
I mean, what a zone this was at this time.

287
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:26,660
I feel like this downtown Disney at this time is where the millennium happened.

288
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:34,660
The millennium happened early in 1998 and it happened with the incredible VR at Disney Quest and daily at the Virgin Megastore.

289
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:39,380
As people sampled Moby, as people put on their headphones, they listen to their Moby.

290
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:43,540
Then they went to Wolfgang Puck or Bongo's Cuban Cafe.

291
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:46,480
And then they capped off the night with a double Jack and Coke and Lanuba.

292
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:52,740
Yeah, they got they got they got themselves a butternut squash soup at Wolfgang Puck.

293
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:53,900
A new flavor.

294
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:54,320
A new.

295
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:57,500
That was nobody had that in America before 98.

296
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,280
No, no, no.

297
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:04,280
And then they had themselves a barbecue chicken pizza flatbread, a flatbread.

298
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,360
Now, not a not a we know this word now.

299
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:15,740
Now we're accustomed to this word, but a flatbread barbecue chicken with a butternut squash soup in 1998.

300
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:25,020
I mean, who but Disney and downtown Disney was even ushering the millennium in like I don't think any other company was saying it is coming.

301
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,360
You put the cookies out.

302
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:36,080
You welcome these holidays and no one else was even ushering the great millennium in with the respect that Disney was and with the face of Mickey's face,

303
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,240
facing the future, facing the future of the new millennium.

304
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,340
Obviously, there was a House of Blues deal with Cirque du Soleil.

305
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:44,920
There was a Wolfgang Puck deal.

306
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:48,760
You mean you're talking about the meal deals where you could you could pair it.

307
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:51,660
It was like, you know, you pair wine and cheese.

308
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:55,400
Well, Cirque and Puck Wolfgang Puck.

309
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,080
What now?

310
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:56,520
Now.

311
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:57,260
So perfect.

312
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,280
They're they're aesthetically of a piece, too.

313
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:05,440
You go into Wolfgang Puck and there's the beige or yellow right next to a checkerboard pattern.

314
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,580
And then that's all caught up.

315
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:19,720
Yeah, a kooky sun on an upside down pyramid light that has some some colored glass in there and and also mosaic tile.

316
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:22,640
There's a mosaic tile on a column over there.

317
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,800
I look over there.

318
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,560
There's not a mosaic.

319
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,360
There's not mosaic on that column.

320
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,420
Just on this column has a mosaic.

321
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:29,580
It's not about matching.

322
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,760
It's not about uniformity.

323
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:33,320
If you feel mosaics on this column, do it.

324
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:37,380
If you don't, if you just feel a goofy moon on this column, just do that.

325
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:42,440
And you imagine, imagine you're a James Taylor dad.

326
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:47,280
Tiny spectacles, a Rolex watch, collared shirt.

327
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:52,140
You're there with your bowling shirt, Van Dyke.

328
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,600
You're in Orlando.

329
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:55,600
You woke up in Orlando this morning.

330
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:58,180
You had an extra eight hundred dollars.

331
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,820
You're going to spend that eight hundred dollars.

332
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:11,960
You now find yourself at the brink of the millennium, tasting tastes like flatbreads and sushis and butternut squash soups before you go.

333
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,200
Sushi in America.

334
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:16,320
Did I wake up in the wrong country today?

335
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,980
Sushi in Orlando.

336
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:24,240
And now I'm going to go see a Frenchman on a tricycle while I'm drinking a Double Jack and Coke.

337
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,760
I just spent five hundred dollars.

338
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,920
My son is here.

339
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:27,760
He's going to.

340
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,620
This is the first time he's going to masturbate.

341
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,540
He just saw that girl's body right there.

342
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,720
This is the first time my son's going to masturbate.

343
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:37,500
I'm sitting here in Lanoe by my belly's filled with butternut squash soup.

344
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,480
And I'm drunk.

345
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:39,540
I'm drunk.

346
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,420
I'm watching a Frenchman.

347
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:43,920
I woke up in 1998 one way.

348
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:45,840
I'm leaving and I'm in the year 2000.

349
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:49,720
The next day that just happened because of Disney.

350
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:59,240
Michael Eisner funneled the vision of the millennium into all the like minded James Taylor's and Hell freezes over is like him.

351
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:04,640
It's what Eisner could see with his tiny glasses that other CEOs of companies couldn't.

352
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:10,520
He could see the synthesis of the millennium of butternut squash of your first masturbation.

353
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,600
He could he could triangulate all of it.

354
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,560
He saw through the matrix before even there was a matrix.

355
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,040
There wasn't that film yet.

356
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,100
You're Michael Eisner.

357
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:22,440
You're curating the idealized version of the millennium.

358
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:31,100
He told Dan Aykroyd put some Jack Daniels in that damn barbecue sauce for those ribs at the House of Blues.

359
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:31,820
Yeah.

360
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:32,660
And it paid off.

361
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,520
And guess what?

362
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:42,080
You can go and see social distortion or the cotton mouthed Kings.

363
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:42,640
Yes.

364
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:46,400
Usually the cotton mouthed Kings at the House of Blues.

365
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:56,560
You go from the cotton mouthed Kings at the House of Blues to a belly full of butternut squash and a Frenchman bouncing a tricycle on your lap in one night.

366
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,500
You come you you're from Minnesota.

367
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:02,540
You went into the culture matrix brought to you by Mr.

368
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:03,620
Eisner himself.

369
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:04,640
I got right.

370
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,960
Drive to my job.

371
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:06,380
All right.

372
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,120
Your fill in my data.

373
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,060
Go home.

374
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:09,560
All right.

375
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,260
Meal with the kids.

376
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,000
How was your day?

377
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:11,480
All right.

378
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:11,920
Fine.

379
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:14,600
It's the same thing every day.

380
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,320
To then break out of that.

381
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:20,200
Go to Orlando experience a cultural melting pot.

382
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:26,720
Something that combines Jack Daniels and cotton mouthed Kings and a Frenchman with a long nose.

383
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:34,780
It was hiding but then peering out and then saying hello and then doing strange gestures with their hands and little feathers up top.

384
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,020
You have a flatbread.

385
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:36,800
You're drunk.

386
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:41,420
You and yes your money is now in Michael Eisner's pocket that you brought to Orlando.

387
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,320
Did he not earn it?

388
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:43,400
But did he not earn it?

389
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:43,880
Yes.

390
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,540
It's tough to go back.

391
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:48,780
It is tough to go back after you go to La Nuba.

392
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,160
It's tough to go back.

393
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:50,820
You're a dad.

394
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:57,600
You just had some great silent very silent drunk drunk sex.

395
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,320
You get back there.

396
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,160
You have a you have a belly full of Jack Daniels.

397
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:03,140
You're drunk.

398
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,380
You have butternut squash.

399
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,340
Now you're trying to have silent sex.

400
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:13,380
You're trying to have silent sex in the contemporary with memories of the rag dolls still dancing in your head.

401
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:19,100
And the walker there underneath your little hat that your top hat that you tipped up now there in your head.

402
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:23,280
The new but he brings his hat up and the the call dancing on there his head.

403
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,860
Now you're dancing in sugar plums dancing in your head.

404
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:26,520
You're there.

405
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,040
You you lost your money.

406
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:30,660
You have no more money.

407
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:33,860
You're leaving the contemporary tomorrow with no more money.

408
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:37,600
But you what you've gained what you've gained culturally.

409
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,360
Michael Eisner.

410
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:43,860
Wolfgang the millennium three days in Orlando.

411
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:49,120
And all of a sudden you've seen the best of what the world can offer in 1998.

412
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:53,640
You're sent back to Minnesota a better person because of Michael Eisner.

413
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:54,820
You're sent back better.

414
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:55,420
You're sent back.

415
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:55,920
He fixed you.

416
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,240
He was a cultural doctor.

417
00:25:58,460 --> 00:25:59,700
He diagnosed everybody.

418
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:03,680
He saw what they were missing was Jack Daniels ribs.

419
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:07,180
Cottonmouth Kings and jesters.

420
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:12,580
He curated a medley dish the best of the world for you.

421
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:13,040
Yeah.

422
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,600
In the year 2004.

423
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:24,500
This is a pivotal moment for Eisner as captured by Bravo's cameras.

424
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:32,260
Here is Guy riding through downtown Disney and he picks up somebody along his way.

425
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:35,300
Hi Michael.

426
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:36,300
How are you?

427
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:38,040
Pretty good.

428
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,060
Where are you from?

429
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,340
Coming from the desert.

430
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:40,880
Wow.

431
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:41,820
This had a long ride.

432
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,200
You want to have a ride with me a little bit?

433
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:43,880
Absolutely.

434
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:44,800
Come on in.

435
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:45,420
Excellent.

436
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:49,240
Oh, he's getting on.

437
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:50,720
Yeah, Eisner's getting on.

438
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:53,760
See this is also artistically what he did.

439
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:54,640
Yeah.

440
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:55,580
Got him on the backseat.

441
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:56,320
He took him for.

442
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:02,320
We are right now are watching and we'll post this to our Twitter so everybody in Stilt

443
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,400
Nation can see this.

444
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:08,960
This is really the moment that makes it all happen where Michael Eisner hesitantly, you

445
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,580
know, he's not sure where to put his hands.

446
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:14,260
He's not on a motorcycle all the time, but that's the trust that he puts in Guy.

447
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:18,580
It's analogous to the artistic the artistic trip that he took.

448
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,980
He had to trust Guy.

449
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:24,100
He didn't know where to put his hands when he got on the back of Guy's motorcycle the

450
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:24,440
same way.

451
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:29,700
He didn't know exactly how to how do I put the financial box together for you to do.

452
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:31,200
Do I take creative control?

453
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,300
How do I?

454
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:39,640
But yeah, ultimately, he put his hesitant shaky hands on Guy La Liberté's midsection

455
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:45,520
and they rode off into the sunset or at least eight feet forward to where there was a cut

456
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,940
point and then Bravo went to commercial.

457
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,980
Seemingly he didn't fall off.

458
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,100
I don't think so.

459
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,160
At least not artistically.

460
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,400
At least not in this take.

461
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,720
This might tie us together nicely.

462
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:59,980
Why don't we take the tightrope over to la performance de la semaine, the performance

463
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:00,840
of the week.

464
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:04,280
The main thing we will be analyzing on Lanuba Boys.

465
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,600
My favorite segment.

466
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:09,900
La performance de la semaine.

467
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:12,080
The cycle sequence.

468
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:14,090
The cycle sequence.

469
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,620
We're so lucky.

470
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:16,720
The cycle sequence.

471
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:21,180
All this talk of motorcycle and Eisner on the motorcycle.

472
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:27,040
This is the part of the show where you know you think you're watching some stuffy like

473
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,420
Dad, what is this?

474
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:32,600
I should be back in my room listening to Everclear or Everlast.

475
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:34,700
I should be listening to one of the Evers.

476
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,940
I don't want to be here watching some stuffy French circus.

477
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:41,740
All right, well, what if we told you that this circus has BMX bikes in it?

478
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,800
A spoonful of sugar makes medicine go down, the cultural medicine.

479
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,060
You're also getting sonically the music.

480
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:52,540
You're also getting visually the costumes.

481
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:57,860
Now for a kid, BMX, that's a spoonful of sugar to get the cultural medicine go down.

482
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:58,980
They knew that.

483
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:00,320
Gee knew that too.

484
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:07,560
When you're up to that point, what's the number one coolest, newest, newest sport, action,

485
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:12,460
extreme, X games, X games, X games?

486
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:15,200
What is BMX?

487
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,280
That is incorporated.

488
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:23,380
Gee seamlessly incorporates BMX into his not just a circus, masterful, La Nubia piece of art.

489
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,680
It's going to get the dad.

490
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:25,840
It's going to get the kid.

491
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,460
Well, yes.

492
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:34,560
And as we've talked about a number of times, La Nubia was Cirque du Soleil's attempts to do something cool,

493
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:36,740
to do something for the teens.

494
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:48,240
If I could quote Franco Dragone, who was, of course, the director of La Nubia and who did pass away suspiciously shortly after doing the Chris Angel, a Mystica show.

495
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:48,600
All right.

496
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,760
You know, we don't ask too many questions about that.

497
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:55,500
We honor Franco Dragone and we say thank you for giving us La Nubia.

498
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:57,680
But you know, this is a quote from him.

499
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:04,360
After working on previous Cirque shows, I turned around one day and realized that life had gone by and I hadn't seen my children grow up.

500
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:09,020
I wanted to reconnect with youth to show my 19 year old son that I was still hip.

501
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,420
So that is what this you're reading exactly into it.

502
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:15,700
This is a show meant to pull in the 13 year olds, pull in the 19 year olds.

503
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:16,520
That's what I'm saying.

504
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:21,260
And it's the same thing that Eisner did by putting it in Orlando.

505
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:32,040
Look, at that point in time, Cirque du Soleil didn't just have to be performed in the marble palaces of the intellectual aughty out in Paris.

506
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,800
No, no, not just for the richest sheiks.

507
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,400
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

508
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:38,980
Guila Liberté flipped the whole system on its head.

509
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,660
He was on the streets breathing fire, eating fire.

510
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:46,360
There's the wealthiest of the wealthy and then there's fire eaters on the ground.

511
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:49,820
He flipped the system and now he's the 11th richest Canadian.

512
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:54,540
And I mean, imagine Lefou becomes the king.

513
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,840
It's almost a plot.

514
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:59,800
It's almost a plot from one of Guy's famous performances.

515
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,240
Yeah, they did do that.

516
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:01,780
Isn't that that?

517
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:03,200
That's the story of Mr.

518
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:03,460
A.

519
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:06,640
Yes, I believe I think so.

520
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:11,880
Obviously, we I'm more Lanuba favoring than Mr.

521
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:12,220
A.

522
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:13,040
Oh, no, of course.

523
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:14,740
But we acknowledge their other works.

524
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:15,800
We just don't like them.

525
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:16,020
Yeah.

526
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:22,560
Vertigo and Hitchcock, Guy and you know, you're going to put some of yourself into your work no matter what.

527
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:33,400
Quote, What helped us get through it was to make the show a tribute to all the teenagers in the world, which injected a lot of energy into it.

528
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:43,540
And that really reads when you watch the full 90 minute pro shot version of Lanuba, you definitely can tell that this is something that works for teenagers.

529
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,720
I mean, teenagers would love that.

530
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,940
It's a tribute to them.

531
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:47,880
Rock music.

532
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:50,320
There's BMX bikes.

533
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,200
They could have called the show Teen Tribute.

534
00:31:53,400 --> 00:32:00,820
I mean, Lanuba is a perfect title, Lanuba, which, of course, means party, party, party, which it basically is.

535
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:06,580
I mean, it's not Lanuba being a teenager themed experience makes perfect sense.

536
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:10,660
It's also telling you, listen, this is kind of like a PG 13 show.

537
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:11,160
Yeah.

538
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:11,640
You know what?

539
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:14,160
Maybe keep the seven year old back in the room.

540
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:15,280
Well, the title tells you that.

541
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:15,520
How many?

542
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,240
There's children's birthday parties.

543
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,460
But who goes to parties?

544
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,400
Teenagers, teenagers, teen parties.

545
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:24,120
It's just also a recommendation for who the show's for.

546
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:30,540
And only a teenager could begin to synthesize and understand the beauty and the artistry of Lanuba.

547
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:31,440
You can't.

548
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:32,920
A child could not.

549
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:33,400
Possibly.

550
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:40,220
And we should strive for our entertainment to be smarter than a dumb little child could perceive.

551
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,020
At least start at Lanuba.

552
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:42,680
Yes.

553
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:48,360
I have a child and, you know, he's about to turn four, not quite Lanuba age yet.

554
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:51,200
I would say at five, I'm going to start adjusting.

555
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,380
That's a Lanuba boy.

556
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:52,880
Yeah.

557
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,480
A future Lanuba boy.

558
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:59,140
I guess he's going to be co-hosting with us in not too long, you know, because we know,

559
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:00,840
you know, this will be going for a while.

560
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:06,640
Isn't it nice to have come out of the gate with such audience response to know that we

561
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,960
got 15 years of this thing.

562
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:13,280
Hey, all you Lanu bots out there and Lanubians, I know that you guys have a little bit of

563
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,600
a feud going against each other.

564
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,680
I see them on the Reddit.

565
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:16,320
They argue.

566
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:16,800
I know.

567
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,200
The Lanubians and the Lanubians.

568
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,260
We don't get into it.

569
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,140
We don't get into it.

570
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:20,800
We let you decide.

571
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:21,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

572
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,120
We're just happy that you guys are listening.

573
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:29,180
And honestly, for your son, I can only imagine the joy of putting on a Lanuba DVD shot in

574
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:31,880
2004, October 22nd on the Vision Pro.

575
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,200
Imagine that.

576
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:33,440
Oh, yeah.

577
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,040
That's almost as good.

578
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,020
They never would have dreamed of that.

579
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:43,760
Because he can't, you know, he'll never understand a world where you can just show up with $199

580
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,560
in your pocket to Orlando, Florida.

581
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,640
It takes $199.

582
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,420
And he will never know.

583
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:54,120
Did I have to make the calculation?

584
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:59,760
Do I want to bring a child into the world who can't go experience Lanuba live?

585
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:09,240
Because, of course, Lanuba was replaced in 2017 by a new show called Drawn to Life, I think.

586
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:14,120
I don't even, I don't, I'm so fucking pissed that they got rid of Lanuba.

587
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:17,540
I don't even, I'm not even sure what the name of the new show is.

588
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:22,620
And you can't even go to Gloria Estefan's Bongo's Cuban Cafe anymore.

589
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:22,960
No.

590
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:25,340
Why even go to this part of this place?

591
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,840
Why even go to Orlando at all?

592
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:27,260
I don't.

593
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,140
I don't like going to Orlando.

594
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:33,360
Because now they've made it, it's now a show that involves like Disney characters, Disney animation.

595
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,140
Fuck that.

596
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:37,060
That was not the vision of James Taylor's dad.

597
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:37,860
Or Guy.

598
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,340
This is, we're asking for it.

599
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:49,520
In terms of like any societal breakdown, climate change, we're asking for it, for spitting in Guy LaLiberté's face.

600
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,440
We deserve worse.

601
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:56,980
It would be like canceling Stranger Things and replacing it with some other show on Netflix, right?

602
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:02,400
Yeah.

603
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:09,920
If we ever get rid of Stranger Things just because the children are all now 26 years old, we would be quitting.

604
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:11,220
We'd be quitting culturally.

605
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:12,700
Those parts belong to them.

606
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:18,440
It's about their essences, not about whether they are still four foot five with their little backpacks.

607
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:27,420
Well, Liyama, the Peacock singer, Piero Acrobat, the devil, the lost ballerina, and Piero Clown never age in the dream world.

608
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:39,920
To bring it all back, just to say, I did, of course, My Child Deserves to Live, even though the only way he can experience La Nuba is by watching the DVD from 2004, the ProShot DVD.

609
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:45,400
And hopefully, fingers crossed, as soon as they work out the kinks with that Vision Pro, I'm going to strap that thing on him.

610
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,100
I don't know if it's too big for a toddler's head.

611
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,400
I don't care at this point.

612
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,420
I need to start getting one.

613
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:52,120
I would rather, I mean, exactly.

614
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:57,820
It would be like, I would rather them at least start with La Nuba on Vision Pro than Allegria or, you know.

615
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:58,460
I know.

616
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,340
I mean, I can't even imagine.

617
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:01,380
Winduuk?

618
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:02,320
No, no, no, no.

619
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,320
They're going to put out Winduuk first?

620
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:04,900
Come on.

621
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:05,340
Yeah, yeah.

622
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:10,740
When they, when Cirque starts going through the catalog, if La Nuba is not the first thing out of the gate, what are we even doing?

623
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,820
Shut the company down.

624
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:14,800
I'm showing my kids a new hope for Star Wars.

625
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:15,480
Yeah.

626
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,420
Let's just put it that way.

627
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:16,920
Yes.

628
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:22,100
Yeah, we can quibble with, we can make up these interesting orders to do it in, but you start where you start.

629
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:23,720
You start with new hope.

630
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,400
Whoa, whoa.

631
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:32,680
You know, Bug, Michael Eisner made some great decisions as CEO of the Walt Disney Company.

632
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:37,380
But if our listeners want to feel like the CEO of the bedroom, they should check out Bluechew.

633
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:40,240
You can take them any time, day or night, even on a full stomach.

634
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:43,080
And since they're chewable, they work up to twice as fast as pill.

635
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:46,100
So you can be ready whenever an opportunity arises.

636
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:46,700
Yes.

637
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:52,180

Bluechew is the better, cheaper, faster choice.

657
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,100
We thank them for sponsoring La Nuba Boys.

658
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:33,820
C'est magnifique.

659
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:37,660
So, the BMX sequence.

660
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:42,860
A couple of cool BMX bikers come out and they do awesome bike stunts.

661
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:48,820
They hop around, they hop through the audience, they land their bikes on different platforms.

662
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,800
Very precarious stunts.

663
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:52,040
But it's not just that.

664
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:55,280
They also tie into the broader theme of La Nuba.

665
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:59,780
We know that the characters in La Nuba are broken up into the Cirques, the Circus people,

666
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:05,860
and the Urbains, the Urbanites, and we know them because they wear the dark muted monochromatic colors.

667
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:11,660
And that theme of urbanism is really handily strung through all of La Nuba.

668
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:14,060
And here's quote Aguila-Liberté.

669
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:19,860
We wanted a very urban show that it had to be a modern kind of urban, not something out of Fritz Lang's Metropolis.

670
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:27,580
That's why you see dot com, shift, delete, barcodes, and so forth on the walls for the high tech element.

671
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:33,660
These BMX bikers come out about halfway through the, or not halfway, it's at the 30 minute mark, if you want to follow along with us.

672
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:43,780
And they are wearing skin tight bike suits that say shift and TM and there's a big at symbol.

673
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:45,200
A visionary.

674
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,260
I can't think of anything cooler than that.

675
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:48,620
You mentioned this earlier.

676
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,060
This was before the Matrix.

677
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:57,100
It predates, it predicts, it thematically is getting teenagers involved with the internet, BMX bikes.

678
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:01,140
You're mentioning these words today and it just completely sunk in.

679
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:06,360
I can't believe that after all these episodes, whatever episode we're on, I know you guys at home, La Nuba bots.

680
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:09,680
We let them keep track and you can check the La Nuba boys wiki.

681
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:12,220
Yeah, if you're counting the Patreon episodes, but basically.

682
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,120
They're dorks.

683
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:13,740
We love them though.

684
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,180
We love them.

685
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,640

Please just.

688
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:18,280
Stilt Nation.

689
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:20,400
Yeah, Stilt Nation out there.

690
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:22,520
Obviously all the green birds.

691
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,840
Green birds are getting a little crazy on the forums though.

692
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:27,800
But it's getting.

693
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:30,080
Well, the Reddit's getting a little toxic.

694
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:34,360
Honestly, I can't really check the comments anymore because those green birds are, you know, they're just so good.

695
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,080
There's always some complaint this or that.

696
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,280
You know, why are you so dismissive of Zumanity?

697
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:42,640
Because I, well, because they went too far showing the sensual side of Cirque du Soleil.

698
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,080
Exactly.

699
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:47,320
I want my son to masturbate after the show, not during the goddamn show.

700
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:47,920
Yes.

701
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:48,300
Yes.

702
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:55,120
Keep it in your, no, you, you plant erotic visions for them to take home and then go hide in the bathroom, in the hotel room.

703
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:57,220
Obviously we've talked about this a million times.

704
00:39:57,460 --> 00:40:02,800
We, Zumanity, we have a whole spiel about this, but like I said, La Nuba, visionary.

705
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:09,300
Gee, is prediction about teenagers now all they're looking at or at signs.

706
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:10,000
Yeah.

707
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,140
If you're thinking about it.

708
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:12,340
Because they're on social media.

709
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:13,260
This was in 1998.

710
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:14,380
This is before TikTok.

711
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:17,200
He's putting ads on the BMX bikers.

712
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:18,400
And now ads are attached.

713
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:22,340
We, people know our names with ads before them more than they know our real name.

714
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:28,100
And this is what was, this is what was given to a James Taylor dad in 1998 with his bowling shirt.

715
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:34,800
It's like Eisner and Gee wanted to give James Taylor dads everything they needed to know, a full toolbox.

716
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,540
Yeah, exactly.

717
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:43,500
They were giving, given a millennium toolbox from Michael Eisner in downtown Disney of what to expect, the new taste that you're going to get.

718
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:46,160
That your kids are going to be obsessed with the internet.

719
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:48,860
You are going to be eating flatbread soon.

720
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:53,180
You're going to have to get used to zucchini being a regular part of your diet.

721
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:53,760
Yes.

722
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:59,580
What if I put a walnut in a butternut squash soup with a little bit of goat cheese?

723
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:00,020
Wow.

724
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:03,920
What if I showed you a French clown?

725
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:11,820
What if a person was bald and pale and had a streak of blue paint next to their eyes?

726
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:13,200
Are you afraid of it?

727
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:13,900
You shouldn't be.

728
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:14,900
You should embrace it.

729
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:16,000
Embrace the difference.

730
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:16,820
Embrace change.

731
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:17,320
Yeah.

732
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:21,040
The tent in Lanouba was the ground zero for the very millennium itself.

733
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:23,780
For what was to come in the very millennium itself.

734
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:28,640
At signs on BMX bikes with a belly full of butternut squash, goat cheese soup.

735
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:38,200
How does the Lanouba tent being ground zero for the millennium, does this have any relation to your broader simulation theory?

736
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:39,320
Of course.

737
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:43,240
It all perfectly synthesizes into my 2001 theory.

738
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:50,280
My theory, of course, being that everything before 9-11 2001 was a data set memories implanted sort of like Dark City.

739
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,960
Dark City is what they call the city in Lanouba, by the way.

740
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:57,040
That's also the movie of which I based part of my theory on was Dark City.

741
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:57,600
Wow.

742
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,260
And the Matrix, obviously.

743
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:03,780
But basically, Dark City is these aliens replace people every day and they just data set their brains.

744
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:09,500
You think you wake up in a job and you're a CEO, but actually the day before you weren't, you just have the memories implanted that you're the CEO.

745
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,260
OK, same thing with 2001.

746
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:14,000
On 9-11 2001, we all woke up on 9-11.

747
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,220
It was the alarm clock data set of all the memories.

748
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:22,080
Now, what Lanouba fits in, it's the perfect data set of a memory or a dream.

749
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:28,880
It is within itself the meeting ground of dreams and reality inside of the tent.

750
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:30,280
Everything still stands.

751
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:42,060
Even if it was a dream, if it was a dream, a data set, a memory and it never happened, it all still stands because within that tent holds the clues of which this simulation has now been set in motion.

752
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:44,140
It still has all the clues.

753
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:51,800
When Steven Spielberg woke up on 9-11, he hadn't made Color Purple or Indiana Jones.

754
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:53,900
OK, that was just a memory in his head.

755
00:42:54,380 --> 00:43:01,300
But that memory gave him the clues of which to then proceed and make Minority Report.

756
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:01,700
Yeah, whatever.

757
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:02,380
Anything afterward.

758
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,520
Now, was he the same Steven Spielberg after 2001?

759
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:06,300
Maybe not.

760
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:07,940
He was our Steven Spielberg.

761
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:08,780
No one was the same.

762
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:09,540
Yeah, exactly.

763
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:10,620
Who could be?

764
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:10,840
Yeah.

765
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:15,700
But he learned from his own false dream data set.

766
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,960
That's why this Lanouba Ted is perfect.

767
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:26,180
It actually was the ground zero of what was to become in the millennium after 2001, 9-11.

768
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:33,070
That's why we always return to this October 22, 2004 DVD taping.

769
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:44,960
But it still synthesizes, reinforces, reverberates in that little Lanouba tent in 2004 what they set up in 1998.

770
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:46,580
All those clues are still there.

771
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:48,180
We still can use those clues.

772
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:52,660
They still inform our understanding of what the simulation is.

773
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:57,500
So it fits perfectly in that it is a signature from the Mr.

774
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:59,740
Simulator up there who made all of this.

775
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:01,200
It's just a signature.

776
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,560
It's a way of saying, guess what, guys?

777
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:04,780
You found it.

778
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:13,140
You pinpointed the exact moment where dreams and reality, data set and reality all converge into one tent.

779
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:14,560
And guess what?

780
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:20,400
For this period of time after your existence, you can go back into that tent and watch exactly how I did it.

781
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:22,280
All the clues are still there for you, Mr.

782
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:22,820
Policeman.

783
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:23,940
They're all there.

784
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:24,940
It's a signature.

785
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:29,640
It's a way of saying, bug main, Scott, you figured it out.

786
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:30,960
I'm the simulator.

787
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:36,380
My crockpot for the millennium was the tent at Lanouba in downtown Disney.

788
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:46,440
The way I tested it was in this data set, this mishmash, transference world of dreams and realities in this tent.

789
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:50,160
That's where I put all the flavors of the new millennium into it.

790
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:54,780
So did you think the BMX stunts were cool?

791
00:44:57,700 --> 00:44:58,440
Yes.

792
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:12,480
Okay, well, as always, we conclude the show by taking the act that we saw and giving it a rating.

793
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:17,140
Our rating is, of course, one to eight little shakes of a Jester's Hatbells.

794
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:21,140
What rating would we give the BMX bike portion of Lanouba?

795
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:25,200
That's a full eight shakes of Jester Hatbells for me.

796
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:25,500
Yes.

797
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:26,360
Yeah, absolutely.

798
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:27,160
That's a full eight.

799
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:28,180
You can't get better.

800
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:29,820
I mean, like we're saying, prescient.

801
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:31,500
It's written on their clothes.

802
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:33,840
I mean, Gi is working on a level that is…

803
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:35,580
Pure Gi.

804
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:37,280
Perfect Gi.

805
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:41,140
Yeah, contemporary act BMX bikes.

806
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:42,700
Contemporary act.

807
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:45,340
In a European circus, what are you talking about?

808
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:49,780
Totally surprise you, really like shakes you up just like a Jester's Bell.

809
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:52,900
And that's why I also got to give it eight shakes of a Jester's Hatbell.

810
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:53,860
Can't get any better.

811
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,680
Eight shakes of a Jester's Hatbell.

812
00:45:55,680 --> 00:46:02,000
Well, then it goes in the Super Shake Club along with every other part of Lanouba

813
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:06,820
because we have always given eight shakes of a Jester's Hatbell to every single part.

814
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:12,800
We will determine next week if we give the same eight shake rating to the automatons.

815
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:15,160
We finally make it to the automatons.

816
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:16,780
Audience has been waiting for this one.

817
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:17,860
We'll see.

818
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:18,480
We'll see.

819
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:21,040
We have some hot takes coming for you.

820
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:23,280
This could be the one that doesn't go all the way.

821
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:23,720
We'll see.

822
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:24,160
We'll see.

823
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:27,040
This is where Stilt Nation is going to get mad at us.

824
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:29,440
Stilt Nation, this is the divisive one.

825
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,280
Be cool, Stilt Nation.

826
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:31,900
Relax.

827
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:32,360
All right.

828
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:34,020
Don't be haters, Stilt Nation.

829
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:39,000
Now, I don't know if Stilt Nation can not be haters, to be perfectly honest.

830
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:40,660
Oh, geez.

831
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:41,800
You're asking for it.

832
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:44,240
You're asking for their hot takes about our hot takes.

833
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:45,580
Buzz Buzz, Stilt Nation.

834
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:49,620
But hey, we love you and we thank you for supporting us.

835
00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:52,740
And I guess with that, it's time for us to take our curtain call.

836
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:54,060
Thanks to Stilt Nation.
