1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:10,400
Warning, the following podcast is reconstructed from the bones of our superstar limo episode.

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,640
It also contains further arguments over cuteness.

5
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:18,880
Top Disney vocalist Huey Lewis and Ham in the pool?

6
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:24,880
Oscar Montoya joins us to talk Monsters Inc. Mike and Sully to the rescue on today's podcast,

7
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:25,520
The Ride.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:51,120
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, the only theme park podcast that emits a very faint hint

9
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,480
of ginger at the top of every episode.

10
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:57,080
I'm Jason Sheridan, joined as always by Mike Carlson.

11
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,600
Yes, I'm here on Mike Carlson.

12
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:05,440
I insist though that this holiday we emit a gingerbread smell, but I am happy with the

13
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,640
ginger most of the year.

14
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,080
Sure, yeah.

15
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:13,440
It's a palate cleanser most of the year and then it'll just be an assault of like holiday

16
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:17,760
themed baked goods for like two or three months at the end of the year.

17
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,040
Strongest artificial gingerbread smell possible is what I like.

18
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,480
That's my personal taste, so I would appreciate it if we do it.

19
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:28,600
But anyway, let's see what smell Scott Gardner would like to hear or hear smell.

20
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,640
Jesus, I'm losing my mind.

21
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,360
Whoa.

22
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,400
How long have we been locked in our apartment?

23
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,080
Hearing smells.

24
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,520
Oh, man.

25
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,760
I'm high, man.

26
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,800
Trippy idea, dude.

27
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:45,640
Yeah, I know you should have like you should really dove in around the holiday.

28
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:50,800
You should have like grinded up a bunch of gingerbread cookies and just dove in.

29
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,000
That would have been a nice Christmas.

30
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,360
If you got to spend Christmas alone and then just like scar facing a pile of ground up

31
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:01,040
gingerbreads, one way to do it.

32
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,160
That is such a kid.

33
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:07,160
Honestly, maybe I'm in the minority here, but as a kid fantasy and maybe it starts from

34
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:12,960
DuckTales, but diving into just anything that's not water is such a like it sounds like such

35
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,200
an exciting, fun thing.

36
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,760
Obviously not something that would hurt you like coins, but the idea that you could like

37
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,360
swim in cookies or in I don't know.

38
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:28,480
I'm trying to think like whipped cream or candy like as a kid, I think I always wanted

39
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,120
to do something like that, but it's very impractical.

40
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,720
Did you guys share this feeling or am I alone?

41
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,720
Am I a weirdo?

42
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:42,440
Well, you want to do the like ultimate version of it where it like doesn't start to get gross

43
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:47,040
or inconsistent really quickly or like the material doesn't like break apart immediately

44
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,400
after the dive.

45
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,400
If there's cartoon logic behind it, then sure.

46
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:56,040
I was just what I flashed to when you said that I think one of the things I miss in Pandemic

47
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:00,320
the most is like chips and salsa at a Mexican restaurant, but I don't know if I really want

48
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,800
to swim in salsa.

49
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:06,960
So maybe if I could swim in the chips and just kind of bite them wherever I go and then

50
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:14,720
release salsa through some sort of like water gun situation so that I could like, you know,

51
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:20,160
just little spurts because I think swimming in salsa would maybe get a little exhausting.

52
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,520
Chips wouldn't you get cut up if you dove into chips?

53
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,520
That's what I'm saying.

54
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,680
You have to apply cartoon logic, I think.

55
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:31,000
Yeah, yeah, you're probably getting scratched at some point.

56
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,160
But like, okay, Jason, Jason here, how about this scenario?

57
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:39,800
It's a giant pool and they somehow figure out a way to cook a brownie inside of it.

58
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:44,120
So it's a giant brownie filled pool.

59
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,120
Would you dive in?

60
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,760
Because that would be soft and then you could eat your way out.

61
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,200
Would I dive into a solid object?

62
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,800
Yeah, but it's a brownie.

63
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,800
It's soft.

64
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,880
It's a soft brownie.

65
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,200
I think that would still injure.

66
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,320
If it was angel food cake, I think you could get away with it.

67
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:02,560
But I think the impact of the brownie.

68
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,000
Let's bring our guest in because he's not a log.

69
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,420
He's one of the hosts of the Inside the Disney Vault podcast and the podcast, Podcast Killed

70
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:12,840
the Video Star.

71
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,120
Oscar Montoya is here.

72
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,120
Hi, Oscar.

73
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,120
Hey, hi.

74
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:19,120
That's a that's a really good question.

75
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,120
I do agree.

76
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:24,200
Angel, angel, angel cake, angel food cake.

77
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,080
Yeah, because angel cake is not a thing that doesn't exist.

78
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,480
What is angel cake?

79
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,440
Angel food cake.

80
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,000
That is I think that might be the correct answer here for a soft like landing in some

81
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,600
kind of a non-water dive.

82
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,360
Yeah, no, no, no, no, no, no.

83
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,480
We're we're jumping into food.

84
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:52,120
And I think the thing is, like, I would want to dive into cartoon food.

85
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:57,720
There's nothing more delicious than cartoon ham.

86
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,800
You know exactly what I'm talking about.

87
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:04,760
The look of cartoon ham is like so delicious.

88
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:11,520
I would love to dive into a pool full of cartoon hams and just munch my way.

89
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:18,080
I like the idea of this a lot, but would the hams be like full kind of intact hams

90
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:18,720
that you would buy?

91
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,720
They're not like cold cut, the deli sliced.

92
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,840
No, not sliced ham like full ham.

93
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:29,920
I don't know what body part that is of a pig, but I mean, it's probably every body

94
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,880
part of the pig. But it's those, you know, it's like that.

95
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:38,040
Dark reddish exterior and the soft pink interior.

96
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:41,400
Also, the consistency of cartoon food or just cartoon stuff.

97
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:45,680
Like if we were living in a Roger Rabbit world where it's like we have our live action

98
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,120
selves and then cartoon selves, the cartoon.

99
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:55,320
People would have like this rubbery consistency, like very soft, rubbery consistency.

100
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,240
Right. Oh, am I crazy?

101
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:02,240
And thinking that like the way they've Disney's decided in Toontown, the cartoon

102
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,400
things are sort of soft and foamy.

103
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:08,160
Do you think the people would also be similarly soft and foamy?

104
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,600
Like the cartoon people, I think so.

105
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:15,320
Well, they're flex. I mean, obviously they're flexible because like, yeah, they get hit.

106
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:20,200
If an anvil shoots at their stomach, it bounces past and then they can.

107
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,080
Yeah. So I think there would have to be.

108
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,960
Yeah, they would have to be flexible in some way.

109
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,520
They would have to be soft in some way.

110
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,360
That makes sense.

111
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:33,120
They can't like feel like flesh and fleshy because they don't have flesh.

112
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:33,680
Right. No.

113
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,120
Not like muscle.

114
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,440
Yeah. Mickey Mouse.

115
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:40,720
I don't imagine having muscle and sinew doesn't feel right.

116
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,200
Right. Or like fur, even though he's a mouse.

117
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,400
Like, I know it's not quite like maybe a little bit of like a little like

118
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,480
frosting of fur, just like a little smattering.

119
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,240
But it's not like it's not like hair like our hair.

120
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,760
It's not like an inch of hair.

121
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:58,400
No, I think the Looney Tunes are furry or like fur and feathers.

122
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,120
I feel like I get that from the Looney Tunes a little.

123
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,720
But the Disney base is so like classic

124
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,120
inkblotty from the like hanging around from early days of animation that like,

125
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,400
yeah, I don't know.

126
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,840
I think soft would be right, because if you suddenly touched like Goofy

127
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:20,880
and it felt like a human man, it would be like, oh, this is not weird.

128
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,480
That's yeah, this is weird.

129
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:26,240
So what you're saying is if you touch Daffy Duck,

130
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,640
it would feel different than touching Donald Duck.

131
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,320
Whoa. What's the different?

132
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,280
Like, what's the difference here?

133
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:36,280
Well, I am saying that Daffy doesn't wear any clothes either.

134
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:39,840
He just has that one dignified color.

135
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,720
I think it depends what versions of the characters are talking about,

136
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,360
because the new Mickey cartoons, there's a red and stimpy ish

137
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:52,680
thing they do sometimes where they give a very close up face of the

138
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:58,600
shot of the face where you can see like detail and like bloodshotness and like skin.

139
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,840
And I feel like that might be the most.

140
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,640
If you were to enter that frame of the cartoon and you touched,

141
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,240
it would be the closest to maybe a human being.

142
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,120
But other than that, it would be what you're describing,

143
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,920
like a rubber rubbery feeling, perhaps. Right.

144
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,840
So I think it all depends because cartoon logic changes so often.

145
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,480
So sometimes you touch Mickey.

146
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,320
It feels like, oh, a cartoon.

147
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,080
It's like a bouncy house.

148
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,080
And then sometimes you touch him and it's like a decaying old man.

149
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,520
Oh, no. It all depends.

150
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,080
It all depends.

151
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:32,280
Well, in the instance when they show a close up of Mickey and he's freaking out

152
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:36,440
and his eyes are big and you can see like his skin and you can see what's happening.

153
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,040
I think that's that's when that might.

154
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:41,680
But then are we talking about the same Mickey, though, like is is the classic

155
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,960
Mickey that we all know and love the same as this like new

156
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:49,480
reiteration of Mickey, just like at a different time period?

157
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,800
Or is it like alternate dimension?

158
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,320
Yes, I think it's a multiverse.

159
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,480
I believe there's a multiverse of characters because they we've seen

160
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,360
different versions of the Mickey characters.

161
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,880
We've seen different versions of Looney Tunes.

162
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,440
There's been different types of drawings with them.

163
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:10,600
So, yeah, like in DC Comics, for instance, they call different Earth's

164
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,040
Earth, Earth, one, Earth, two.

165
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,960
So that's right. Make them in the Mickey multiverse.

166
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:20,480
There has to be like an Earth three, which is the new version of the cartoons.

167
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,480
And they're that's we're giving it away.

168
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:27,520
We're giving it away for into the Mickey verse is a billion dollar movie.

169
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,480
Yes, you're right about that, honestly,

170
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,440
because then one of the Mickey verses is just in theme park characters.

171
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,440
Oh, interesting.

172
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:39,840
That look like the ones you see there and they have their own world

173
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,520
and lifestyle, and they obviously feel more like felt.

174
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,920
Interesting. So, OK, so would one.

175
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,320
So if we're making this film, I would say franchise, because we are, by the way,

176
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,040
we are making this blue sky.

177
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,040
We're making it. Yeah.

178
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,640
Would one of the Mickeys in the Mickey verse,

179
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,960
would it be an actor inside of a Mickey suit?

180
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:06,440
Yes. Yeah, it would be like the Disneyland.

181
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,560
It would be like a and I think generally because it's Mickey

182
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:13,200
needs to be on the shorter side, I think it's often a lady that plays Mickey.

183
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,640
Oh, interesting.

184
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:19,280
So maybe the whole narrative could be like, wait, but I'm not Mickey.

185
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,880
I'm like Wendy.

186
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,680
Right. And they're like, no, you're you've been sucked into this machine of Mickey.

187
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,640
So you must be Mickey.

188
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:29,480
And then it's her journey of like realizing that the Mickey was inside her

189
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,080
and not outside of her. Right. This whole time.

190
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:36,040
Yes. Is a Mickey shaped pancake part of this?

191
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,880
Can there be a plot arc involving a Mickey pancake?

192
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,760
I think it makes a cameo, but I don't think it's part of the main.

193
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:46,480
Enough to say, I mean, one coming to life

194
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,240
and having thoughts and feelings would be pretty fascinating.

195
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,440
It's true. It's like Spider Ham.

196
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,040
It's like the John Mulaney Spider Ham is not the star of the movie.

197
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,600
You get some good, good moments, some good set pieces.

198
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,240
Yeah, yeah, sort of. Right. Yes. I like that.

199
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,480
But you're here today.

200
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,720
We're not talking the Mickey versus that we're talking about.

201
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,080
Monster verse. It's the monster verse.

202
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,360
It's your friends and Monsters Inc. Monsters.

203
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,680
Yeah. Mont. Sorry.

204
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,400
I want to say it with all the punctuation, because I think this might be

205
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,440
the theme park attraction.

206
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:20,200
Maybe it's up there with most punctuation and it monsters,

207
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:25,880
comma, Inc. period, Mike Ampersand solely to the rescue exclamation point.

208
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,520
So you got four kinds of punctuation there.

209
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,640
Yeah, this is this failed a grammar test, I feel like.

210
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,400
Yeah. Well, it's like jockeying with guard.

211
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:40,080
It might have been in the lead and then Guardians of the Galaxy

212
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:44,040
mission breakout might be challenging it now,

213
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,120
because I feel like you've got a colon in there.

214
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,240
I think there's a dash in there as well.

215
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,880
Don't forget disaster exclamation point

216
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:57,880
colon, a major motion picture ride, dot, dot, dot starring you exclamation point.

217
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,400
I get the game word for it.

218
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:03,360
You can talk for I think that's really the that's where you take the cake.

219
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,200
Yeah. Yeah. No one's topped.

220
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,840
I don't think anything tops for right.

221
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,040
We haven't found one yet.

222
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:11,240
Someday. I think for for somebody.

223
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,000
Yeah. Somebody will point out it's got to be one somewhere.

224
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,400
The big change we as has been acknowledged online, the big chance,

225
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:21,280
I think, is however they renamed Splash Mountain to be about Princess and the Frog.

226
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:24,800
I think it's possible it might bring five, but we don't know the name yet.

227
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,800
So we're waiting with bated breath.

228
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,120
Splash. Yeah.

229
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:29,880
You're right.

230
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:35,280
And Tiana's journey dash dig a little deeper exclamation point.

231
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,720
Double dash.

232
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,880
A little deeper.

233
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,560
Yeah, that's got to be right.

234
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,560
That's the big. Yeah, yeah.

235
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,160
It's definitely in there.

236
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:46,800
It just feels like a warning, like a passive aggressive, like warning

237
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,880
to the writers, like, come on, dudes, dig a little deeper.

238
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,360
Dig a little more fun on this ride. Yeah.

239
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,400
Oscar, I think initially when I when I asked you to be on the show,

240
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:03,240
you said, have you done Superstar Limbo and the timing had worked out

241
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:07,240
where I was like, yes, literally a week ago to do Superstar Limbo.

242
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,920
I mean, it's a very but this is a I mean, this is like

243
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,480
a reincarnated version of the next chapter.

244
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:17,600
This is a in the Superstar Limbo multiverse.

245
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,240
This is a different world.

246
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,120
It's so because it's similar, but it's obviously something different happens.

247
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,520
So this is Earth to Superstar Limbo.

248
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,080
Let me ask you this. Yeah.

249
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,200
Let me ask you this. Who would get top billing?

250
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:37,400
OK, in in this who I mean, it could be funny man Tim Allen.

251
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,480
It could be

252
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,600
this could be the stars, the Hollywood stars,

253
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,760
Antonio Banderas and Melanie Griffith.

254
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:50,040
Maybe in a way, Jackie Chan is the biggest star depicted in that ride.

255
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,400
Maybe like in terms of Jackie, we just fill in one of those.

256
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,320
Regis was the the very first star I think you see

257
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,480
leaning out the door, like waggling money at you.

258
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,720
What a ride. What a ride.

259
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,120
He's luring you with money.

260
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:10,560
You you were you had some Superstar Limbo fascination Oscar.

261
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,160
Yes, I did.

262
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:17,320
I've you know, I have to say I've never been on the actual ride,

263
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,200
but I have seen videos of it.

264
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:24,080
Hmm. I watched the video maybe once, twice every month.

265
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,560
Sure. Show my friends because a lot.

266
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:30,400
I don't what year did that ride come out?

267
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,160
Because not a lot of people remember that ride. Right.

268
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:38,120
2001, it was it was opened with California Adventure in 2001.

269
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,240
Right. Yeah. And it was such a weird.

270
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:43,280
It was just like a weird question mark.

271
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,280
And of course, it wasn't going to be evergreen.

272
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:49,800
Were they planning to update it every what?

273
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,880
Five years, six years like there was.

274
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,160
Could you imagine still going on that right?

275
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,240
I mean, I would love it in 2021 to still

276
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,240
do a ride 20 years ago, you know, like that would be such a fun time.

277
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,120
Time capsule for me.

278
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,080
But I don't think people would be down for that.

279
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:11,000
Even relevant stars, all of them at the time, let alone 2001.

280
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,040
Yes, it would be extremely bizarre if it stayed.

281
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:17,320
But but like, is there is there a celebrity

282
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:20,280
that's still relevant today that was on that ride?

283
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,360
I think Jackie Chan worldwide.

284
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,760
I don't think Jackie Chan has ever like retired.

285
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,120
I think he's still making movie. I don't know.

286
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,840
I think he's made a lot more movies in Asia than America recently.

287
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:37,440
And I think he still has the name recognition.

288
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,680
I mean, Drew Carey hosts the Price is Right every day.

289
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:43,440
Yeah. Just from sheer like how often are you in media?

290
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,600
I think it would be Drew Carey, but he looks especially now much.

291
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,480
Totally different.

292
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,160
I saw it and then now the beard is radically different.

293
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,720
So they'd have to add that.

294
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,720
Yeah. Well, Tim Allen is like he's had it.

295
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:00,320
He's been on that news show for like 10 years, I feel like, too.

296
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,840
Hey, which speaking of multiverses, that's true.

297
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,920
You know that there was an episode of that show

298
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,440
where whoever the hell he plays on Last Man Standing meets Tim,

299
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,320
the tool man, Taylor. Yes, I saw.

300
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,320
Yeah, I like it to explain that to me.

301
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,120
I don't I don't know if I'm standing.

302
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,360
He runs a fishing and tackle shop, but also is a famous vlogger

303
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,360
for his crankiness. I believe.

304
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,040
Jason, you know, far more than I thought you would.

305
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:34,360
I. I think that's all that is, is mostly what I know,

306
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,600
and that it jumped from like ABC to Fox.

307
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,760
And I is it still going on Fox or did it finally?

308
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:41,600
It's wrapping up. No, I think it's.

309
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,680
Yeah, on the way out.

310
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,320
Oh, but it's still there. Yeah, yeah.

311
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:49,720
But so I had to look up the character to Malin on that show plays Mike Baxter.

312
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:53,680
And through some justification that I don't know off hand,

313
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,720
perhaps another multiverse, the Tim verse.

314
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:01,200
Mike Baxter meets Tim, the tool man, Taylor,

315
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,560
the character from Home Improvement.

316
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:07,760
And there are scenes with two Tim Allen's talking to each other.

317
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,280
Like he's managed to.

318
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:14,920
I'm almost impressed by Tim Allen's acting prowess to be able to go.

319
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:17,960
Who is Tim Taylor as opposed to Tim Allen?

320
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,720
Because you think it's the same thing.

321
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,200
But I think what he does is to kind of dial up the gruffness

322
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:27,360
and sort of in this zone a little more and the whole which you know was

323
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,280
that's the persona, not Tim Allen, the man.

324
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:33,400
So, you know, I love this kind of horseshit.

325
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,320
This is like TGIF.

326
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,200
I wish things were this.

327
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,240
It's very TGIF. Right.

328
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,960
Yeah, weird. Yeah.

329
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,200
Crossovers and they did that all the time in the 90s.

330
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,400
They had a huge crossover events like NBC had those like weird,

331
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,200
like yearly crossover shows.

332
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,080
Oh, yeah. The black programming.

333
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,000
The blackout, that's what it's called.

334
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,920
I in what was that?

335
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,000
Friends Seinfeld.

336
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,360
Uh, what's the show with?

337
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,280
He was he's Ted Danson show.

338
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,200
Becker Becker. Yeah. Yes.

339
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,160
It was a CBS that I think that was that would have been a blackout with CBS.

340
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,800
Oh, wait. No. OK. Oh, was it?

341
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,840
Oh, it wasn't Boston Common.

342
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,600
I think that was.

343
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:16,760
Wait, are you saying that all the shows experienced a blackout on the same night?

344
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,000
Yeah. So all the.

345
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:22,240
Yeah. Must see TV this back when like must see TV Thursday.

346
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,520
There was block before shows.

347
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:29,920
All four shows were, I believe, took place in New York and there was a blackout.

348
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,480
And so they all made sense.

349
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,360
I think they all made sense on their own,

350
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,440
but they all had to work the blackout in.

351
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,880
In some. I got it.

352
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:42,240
I got the list and there's no way I could help you guess one of them.

353
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,320
You will never, ever guess the other.

354
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,320
OK, really?

355
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:48,920
OK, so similar to Seinfeld a little bit like stand up.

356
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,400
Vehicle also lives in New York.

357
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,520
They all have to be in New York to make this work.

358
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:57,040
NBC's sitcom star in ninety four is when this was.

359
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,880
Can you think of what that is?

360
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,320
Is the show named after the comedian?

361
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:08,200
Hmm. It's kind of a two hander, but one of them is sort of Seinfeld esque.

362
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,400
OK.

363
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,880
Oh, oh, I'm not going to.

364
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,680
So it's not.

365
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:17,080
It's not that guy who I always know the name.

366
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,560
It's not one of the Dabney Coleman shows.

367
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,520
Wait, how did you got that one?

368
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,640
Not the other. This is what show was.

369
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,560
Oh, my God.

370
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:29,160
I was going for Mad About You, a very popular show.

371
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,920
Wait, what was the show that you said?

372
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,040
Do you know the name of the show?

373
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,640
What was it called? The show is called

374
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,320
Wait, my internet's blanking.

375
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,560
Mad Man of the People starring Dabney Coleman.

376
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,280
I don't remember the show at all.

377
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,080
I just remember Dabney Coleman, a guy, an actor.

378
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,360
I barely remember.

379
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,960
I remember the name from the 90s.

380
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:55,520
And I feel like I was talking about it to you guys of like,

381
00:19:55,720 --> 00:20:00,480
you know, Dabney Coleman had two different sitcoms back in the past.

382
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:01,960
Wow. Wow.

383
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:05,120
Wow. Now I need to Google search and see what he looks like.

384
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,560
He was in a lot of kids movies.

385
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,520
I'm trying to think what the what the bigger with, you know,

386
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,560
the Beverly Hillbillies or Tootsie he's in.

387
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:15,960
He's in nine. Isn't he the boss in nine to five? Yeah.

388
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:20,000
Yeah, I think that was the biggest one.

389
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,120
He sort of looks like Dr. Phil in this picture.

390
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, sometimes.

391
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:27,000
Clifford is in Clifford. Yeah.

392
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,760
There you go. Oh, he's in the towering inferno.

393
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,920
OK, yes, I remember him. He's everywhere.

394
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,760
He should have been on Superstar Limo.

395
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:39,040
Put Dabney Coleman in the mail, honestly.

396
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,240
The ride would have still been there.

397
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,320
It should have been renamed the Dabney Coleman experience.

398
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,160
Yeah.

399
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,440
It's just like how they get into the blackout.

400
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,040
It's three of the biggest shows ever.

401
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:54,160
And then Madman and the people gets to coast on the way for the blackout.

402
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,960
That's what I I was like, it's not Ned and Stacey.

403
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,360
It's not Boston Common. And it was just out of madness.

404
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:06,800
This is some of the most obscure trivia I feel despite being network TV.

405
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:13,280
As I as a very young, nerdy like tween,

406
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:17,360
my one of my favorite things to do in the summer was to watch this

407
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,240
programming block that USA Network aired called.

408
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:24,800
They was it was either prime time in the A.M.

409
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,760
or P.M. in the A.M. and they would show sit.

410
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:31,240
And so it was like wings Ned and Stacey.

411
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,040
It was all like sitcoms.

412
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,120
Ned and Stacey.

413
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:38,880
So that was a vehicle that was Tom.

414
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,560
Yeah, Thomas Hayden Church and Deborah Messing.

415
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:44,440
It went like two, two and a half seasons, and it was before

416
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,400
sideways and before Will and Grace.

417
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,360
But that was that was what I liked.

418
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:54,960
That was what I evolved from Muppet Babies Rewinds to watching that.

419
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,640
Did you watch USA up all night as well, Jason?

420
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,400
I don't remember USA up all night.

421
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:05,080
I really I would just turn on Comedy Central and watch whatever was on for hours.

422
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:08,880
So absolutely fabulous for many, many hours in a row.

423
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,520
That's what I remember.

424
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,080
And I didn't understand any of it.

425
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,120
I did not remember.

426
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:18,560
I did not understand the UCB show sitcom sketch show, the original one when it was on.

427
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,640
I did not understand Viva Variety.

428
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,720
It was all I got kids in the hall.

429
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,960
But like the others, I was just like, what's Viva Variety?

430
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,520
That was a bunch of the Reno 9-1-1 and state people.

431
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,880
Oh, OK.

432
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,240
Yeah, they did a lot of those, too.

433
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,840
I think they ran. There's more episodes of that than there is of the state.

434
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,480
I think that's right.

435
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:41,320
Exit 57 was the other one that was them, too, I think.

436
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,080
Can I say the strange fact also that Dabney Coleman's

437
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:48,000
Madman of the People was frequently directed by Monsters Inc.

438
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,040
actor John Ratzenberger?

439
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,000
No, that's right.

440
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,680
Who shows up in this ride?

441
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,520
There is a character from Monsters Inc.

442
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,200
The Yeti. Very fun little thing.

443
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,240
That's one of the that's a delightful little door that opens up.

444
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,120
And I guess that gets us out of the territory of Viva Variety.

445
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:10,680
I think that's a good point.

446
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:14,280
But Oscar, you're a star, just like the writers,

447
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,560
just like the guests at the end of Superstar limo.

448
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,840
So something comes back around.

449
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,640
Feel free to, you know, don't hold yourself back.

450
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:26,320
So Oscar, do you like Monsters Inc. the film?

451
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,840
You covered it, I'm sure, at this point on your show.

452
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,440
Yeah, I love Monsters Inc.

453
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:34,760
But I love Monsters University far more than I like Monsters Inc.

454
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,960
And that was that was an unexpected surprise for me

455
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,640
when I covered it on the podcast,

456
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:44,480
because prequels are always to me a bit of a miss,

457
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,120
because it's like, why do we have to do this?

458
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,560
Why do we have to go back?

459
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,920
Like, it doesn't make any sense.

460
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,080
But to me, it hit harder.

461
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:55,680
Monsters, especially with Mike Wazowski storyline.

462
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,800
And it's really have you guys seen Monsters University? Yeah.

463
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,440
I thought it was really charming. Yeah, it was great.

464
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,840
Yeah, it's very charming. Yeah.

465
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,000
But Monsters Inc. is great. Yeah.

466
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,320
So both your fans of both.

467
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,680
But the second one is your preference.

468
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,600
The second one is is a slapper, as they say.

469
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:17,200
Yes. I got to revisit the second one in the theme park world.

470
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,840
I think of the second one as like around the time it came out

471
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:23,280
and right after those Monsters you hats.

472
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,760
Yeah. Just became immediately best sellers.

473
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,360
Merch in all the theme parks. Right.

474
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:31,320
You know, the aesthetic, but no ride yet for Monsters.

475
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,160
No, I guess you had to know it into its own thing.

476
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:37,680
They should just open a Monsters, an actual university

477
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:41,560
in Disneyland Resort, like a full credit at school.

478
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,200
Yeah, sure. And it's like as expensive.

479
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,080
And they also have their own loan program.

480
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,320
So they already have it for the annual passes.

481
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,360
So they can do sort of like predatory loan

482
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,680
to people who just want to be in Disney.

483
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,960
This is a potential money.

484
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,720
Hey, listen, Disney, if you're listening, which I know you are.

485
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:58,480
Oh, yes.

486
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,840
This is potentially a money grabbing thing.

487
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:01,720
Literal Predator.

488
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,640
It was the predatory loans.

489
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,560
He's a monster. Yeah.

490
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,040
I mean, for a while in the 90s into the 2000s,

491
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:13,600
you could go to something called the Disney Institute at Walt Disney World.

492
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,320
And that was I mean, man, we have.

493
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,760
Oh, man, we should do a Disney Institute episode.

494
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:21,680
That thing was so you definitely should,

495
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:25,040
because it's it's a weird part of Disney history.

496
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,960
It is. Yeah, it's very strong.

497
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,880
I mean, Michael Eisner went to some adult retreat sort of thing.

498
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,080
And he's like, we got to make so we could make money on this.

499
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,240
We could do that.

500
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,560
Shitsy classes.

501
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,960
And that is pretty much long gone at this point.

502
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:43,840
I think there's still like, you know, business professional classes

503
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,480
and education workshops you can do.

504
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,920
Oscar, the fact that you know the superstar limo and the Disney Institute,

505
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:53,600
you're you know, some of the strangest, weirdest ends

506
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,880
of Disney lore.

507
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,000
I yeah, yeah.

508
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,240
Any other that you're you're fond of bizarre corners of the of the Disneyverse?

509
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:11,320
For me, I mean, it was what's the I don't see.

510
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:15,080
I'm not very familiar with Disney Walt Disney World, like Disney World.

511
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,480
I don't really know at all.

512
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:20,480
Disneyland is what I've been obsessed with.

513
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:24,360
And it started when I moved to California

514
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:27,720
because I was not really a Disney person at all when I lived in New York.

515
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:32,600
And when I moved to L.A., all these grown ass adults

516
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:35,600
were so obsessed with Disney and I was sort of weirded out by it.

517
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,960
I didn't get it. I was like, what?

518
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,200
It could be a lot.

519
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,720
It could be certainly a lot at first.

520
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:45,400
100. Yeah. At first, because listen, in New York, we're not close to the park.

521
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:48,880
So we don't have that sort of like, you know, foaming at the mouth,

522
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:52,080
passionate drive that these Disney adults have.

523
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,600
So I was very scared.

524
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:57,520
And also, I was

525
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,200
I was born and raised in Colombia.

526
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,840
So I was like kind of really unfamiliar with Disney movies and like

527
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,320
that whole thing. I like missed all of that.

528
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:08,800
So yeah, I was like, I don't I don't really get it.

529
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:12,560
And my friend, Claire and co-host of Inside the Disney Vault,

530
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,640
she was like, well, have you been to the parks?

531
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,040
And I'm like, no, no.

532
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,880
Isn't that for children?

533
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,800
And she's like, no, I'll take you.

534
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:25,320
So she took me and it it truly was a dive.

535
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,880
It was incredible. It was like, what?

536
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,680
I get I got it. I got it at that point.

537
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,240
I was like, oh, there's magic here.

538
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,360
There's like actual magic here.

539
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,360
And then I become obsessed in the 20s.

540
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,200
Is this like later for you a little bit?

541
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,240
This was five years ago. Oh, my God.

542
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,440
So this is possible to be a total late bloomer with all this stuff.

543
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,800
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

544
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,920
I'm interested in your adult years.

545
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:53,080
What were the things that really made you go like, oh, wow, I get here.

546
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,000
This is the thing.

547
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,080
These are the things that people say they like.

548
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:00,920
Yeah. I mean, it was the like to me, the dark rides have always been

549
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,800
like for me, the reason to go to Disneyland.

550
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:09,240
You know, I'm not a roller coaster person or like a wild like six flags.

551
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:13,680
Hell no. I got nauseous at the freaking Wiley Coyote ride, the children's ride.

552
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:16,520
I was like, I ain't doing this shit no more. No.

553
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:20,080
And Disneyland had like just enough excitement for me

554
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:23,760
that made me feel like a sort of bad ass like Space Mountain is a child's ride.

555
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:27,840
But I feel like that's probably like the threshold for me as far as

556
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,800
thrills go, you know.

557
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:37,480
But it's aesthetically so thought out, incredibly well, like really, really.

558
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:42,040
Put together and the details, it's the little details

559
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:45,880
that I was super impressed with.

560
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:48,800
Yeah, that I was just like, oh, there's like so much history here

561
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,480
and there's so like I can keep coming back and discover new things.

562
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,520
You know, that's what I fell in love with.

563
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,240
Yeah, yeah, that makes sense.

564
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,040
That is beautiful to hear.

565
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,720
I mean, we talk about detail.

566
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:02,840
I would say this is a details oriented podcast.

567
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,840
I would I would I would say that.

568
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,720
So, yeah, that makes a lot of sense, whether it's the Pinocchio ride

569
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,320
or Madman of the People with Dabney Coleman.

570
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:14,440
It's the details that we.

571
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,080
But also the thing that I'll say to you about Disneyland

572
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:21,360
that I really like is how creepy it is, like specifically

573
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,480
when it comes to the dark rides. I mean,

574
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:27,440
mm hmm. Yeah, you go to you go to hell in, you know, Mr.

575
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,920
Chow. Yeah, like what if what if shot like what a surprise?

576
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,600
Like kids did that all the time and like didn't even blink an eye.

577
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,120
Like how creepy some of these rides are the Pinocchio ride.

578
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,240
Terrifying, terrifying.

579
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,720
There is. Yeah. And there is an aspect and I

580
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,560
there is an aspect to some of the rides where you do feel like

581
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:47,720
there's a little like hauntedness to them because there's an old

582
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,120
the smell that smells old.

583
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,760
It's some sort of building material that they don't use anymore.

584
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,320
So it smells like your grandmother's house, maybe.

585
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,560
And there are you can like feel like you can feel like the ghosts.

586
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:02,880
You can feel like a Waltz ghost just being like, hey, have fun out there.

587
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,960
I got to feel like that. Yeah.

588
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,640
And also something so like

589
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,640
popcorn and rainbows looking.

590
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:12,040
I mean, it's got to have a secret dark past.

591
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:12,600
You know what I mean?

592
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:16,160
There's got to be a lot of nasty underneath all that, like pretty paint.

593
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:19,040
You know, sure. Of course. I love it.

594
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,560
Yeah. If it's been around a long time. Yes, for sure.

595
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:25,640
So well, this is this attraction.

596
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:29,280
I think Monster's Inc is sort of like feels like kind of an advanced

597
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:32,360
version of the of the dark rides.

598
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:36,120
It like has some things in common with them, with the Fantasyland rides.

599
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:39,920
You know, specifically, there is the like

600
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:43,600
I've certainly seen it as like a complaint or criticism about it,

601
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:47,320
that the characters, they aren't full animatronics, their mouths don't move.

602
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:52,200
But it is in that sense a throwback to, you know, your Alice in Wonderland,

603
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:56,600
your Mr. Toads, you know, where there is a suspension of disbelief

604
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:59,640
and not every one of them is, you know, does the full thing.

605
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:02,800
But you're still I don't know, you can still get caught up in it.

606
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:05,880
Like it's not a requirement for me that they all have fun.

607
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:11,000
Yeah. And I think it honors the vibe of a dark ride

608
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,080
while adding a layer of polish to it.

609
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:16,760
You know what I mean? It's not like an insanely,

610
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:20,640
you know, still feels like a dark ride, you know, which I like.

611
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,360
I like I like the animatronic look to it.

612
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:27,080
But, you know, the the robots moves like smoother.

613
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:31,440
There's like it's like prettier, brighter, you know, but it's still still.

614
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,360
It still works. Yeah. Yeah.

615
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,800
It's it's yeah. Sorry. Go ahead, Jason.

616
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:39,480
Oh, I was going to say, yeah, it's got like, you know, mid 2000.

617
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:44,880
It's got a newer technological base early to that than like the base.

618
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:52,000
The original fantasy land rides have been kind of redone so many times.

619
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,840
This this has only been redone once.

620
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:57,880
I'm sure they've done basic maintenance to it, but it went from,

621
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,080
you know, Superstar Limbo, which barely lasted

622
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:06,480
a two years didn't even make it that long.

623
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:07,840
They wanted that.

624
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,640
They wanted the Yankee so fast.

625
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:14,320
If you want to like, you know, we we did a whole episode about it,

626
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:17,400
which you can listen to so not to read cover any of it,

627
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,560
but just to be to lay it all out.

628
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:23,400
When California Adventure opened, there was this one dark ride

629
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:29,080
that was like a current pop culture, snarky, holly, weird sort of vibe

630
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:34,280
that was just instantly greeted as the with with like the worst feedback

631
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:38,680
that any ride ever has gotten out of the gate, probably even more.

632
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:41,000
So this rides, I think people dislike more people.

633
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,720
This bad figment ride always comes up.

634
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:47,480
But like it wasn't that that was never reviewed by the newspaper.

635
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:50,880
Like, I feel like Superstar Limbo got in trouble because, wow,

636
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,240
Disneyland opened up a whole new park. What's it all about?

637
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,280
Oh, my God, it sucks.

638
00:32:55,280 --> 00:33:00,800
Like this ride just like got all the stink of the early bad PR.

639
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:05,680
So they had to get it out of their base app, though.

640
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:08,680
Though Oscar, I'm sure you wish you could have experienced it.

641
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,360
Oh, God, yes.

642
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:14,440
But I will say even for 2001, the ride feels incredibly dated.

643
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:18,360
Like it just yeah, it expired the second it opened.

644
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,280
Do you know what I mean?

645
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:22,240
Like it's it's what who thought of this idea?

646
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,800
Who thought this was actually going to work?

647
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,600
I love it because it's campy and trash.

648
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,640
Like, that's why it's great.

649
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,360
It's fun to make fun of it. Yeah.

650
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:31,600
The force to genuinely be excited to get on that ride.

651
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,360
For real, real. I don't know.

652
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:36,760
I don't know if it has much like I don't know if there's a person.

653
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,240
Yeah, genuinely.

654
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:42,080
When when Monsters Inc. opened to there was also like a lack of that

655
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,040
classic Disney dark ride in California Adventure.

656
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:48,320
So like, yes, it it filled a purpose.

657
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,560
That movie was a big hit.

658
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:54,800
So we got that that those characters into this park.

659
00:33:56,360 --> 00:34:01,520
And yeah, and it it I think it does a pretty good job of like using these.

660
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:06,400
Horrifying bones of superstar live, like using the taxis

661
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,520
with the little TV screen.

662
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:12,360
Yeah, you re blatantly reusing,

663
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:16,520
like putting a yellow jumpsuit on some animatronics. Yes.

664
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:19,520
Yeah, because as we discovered, I think,

665
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,520
or as we guessed during when we are our episode of Superstar Limo,

666
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:28,040
like some of the bodies and the heads are partially under there from the celebrities.

667
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,960
That's so crazy. Have you ever seen any of these side by side?

668
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:36,240
Have you seen the like explanation of here's the here was the Superstar Limo robot

669
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,640
and now here it is? Is it? I haven't.

670
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:40,600
No, I don't know what robot. I found a bigger.

671
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:44,480
We showed a couple of these in a slideshow at our live show, but I found

672
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:46,160
Jim Hill Media.

673
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:49,160
They did a pretty good breakdown with even more that I'd never seen.

674
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:52,000
So you can see poses side by side.

675
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,480
I didn't realize how many I thought there were only like two or three.

676
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,440
It's a ton of them.

677
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,000
Here's Jackie Chan. He's kicking and hanging off a wire.

678
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,920
And then here is a two eyed sort of two half heads.

679
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:05,240
Child Detecting Agency.

680
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:08,320
If you don't know, that's the the yellow jumpsuited characters

681
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:12,160
that wear hazmat suits because everybody's afraid of children in Monstropolis.

682
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:16,840
So, you know, you slap these suits on these these bones of bad wax figure.

683
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,480
Not even what no wax figures look good.

684
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,760
These are like, you know,

685
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:25,480
like the bad action figure, they're like low end action figure

686
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:28,440
versions of celebrities. Here's.

687
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:29,840
Yeah, it's like the time.

688
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:33,760
It's like the Times Square caricatures that you would get. Yeah. Yes.

689
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,400
Like that's that's whoever designed on proportions.

690
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:40,000
The resume was I made.

691
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,200
I made five dollar caricatures in Times Square.

692
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,800
It boils somebody down to one interest.

693
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,440
That may or may not be an interest of theirs, like in Drew Carey's case,

694
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,800
Maps to the Stars homes.

695
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,320
Why does it make sense?

696
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:56,680
So he pops out, Drew Carey would pop out and fan out all of these maps.

697
00:35:56,840 --> 00:36:01,880
So they replace that with here's photos of Boo, the missing child.

698
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,600
So he has the same gag and he says in the ride,

699
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:07,080
here's the child we're looking for.

700
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:10,480
They really try to hammer home the justification.

701
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,080
Here's Cindy Crawford.

702
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:16,760
Who looks uber trashy in that original depiction?

703
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,760
I mean, I'm scared.

704
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,120
She's especially frightening.

705
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:23,000
And then there's just like kind of a big one big headed

706
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,640
spraying a bottle.

707
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:28,960
I don't know. It's a decontaminant spray, maybe.

708
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:33,880
Here's Tim Allen with a microphone at a stand up club.

709
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,920
That doesn't even look like Tim Allen at all.

710
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:39,240
No, it's like very Duracell man, like those weird.

711
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,080
Yeah.

712
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:46,200
So no longer a microphone, but now like a big sucking machine or something,

713
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,080
but still with weird crossed legs.

714
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:53,960
It's kind of this casual like men's model version of the hazmat suit.

715
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,760
But they had to break his hands.

716
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,160
The hands are at least tilted.

717
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,720
They had to break the animatronics hands and reset.

718
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:03,280
And on some of them, they clearly remove the head.

719
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,800
Oh, you're right. Yes.

720
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,560
Like when we go back up, the moth.

721
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,640
Oh, yeah. Yeah, absolutely.

722
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,920
Yeah. Replaced one head.

723
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,320
We had to carry doesn't have a head.

724
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,600
That's right. It's just a big back.

725
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,320
Drew Carey's head was removed.

726
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,880
So Drew Carey's body is under there in the suit, but his head is somewhere else.

727
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:20,040
It's missing in Imagineering somewhere.

728
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:21,920
That's frightening.

729
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:25,080
Do you think he's wearing a I assume this is an Aloha shirt.

730
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,520
Do you think he's still wearing this shirt underneath the contaminant suit?

731
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,080
I want to hope he is.

732
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:33,600
But if I had to guess, I don't think they took the shirt off and they're

733
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:36,000
it's sitting in a closet somewhere in Imagineering.

734
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:37,680
That's my guess.

735
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,720
But I'd like to think that under there is the clothes.

736
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,680
I am afraid still Drew Carey.

737
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:47,880
If you pry off the yellow, it'll just be big splotches of industrial glue.

738
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:51,960
Like on home renovation shows when they pull up carpet and it's like, wow,

739
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,960
look at this beautiful hardwood under all this rubber cement.

740
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,760
They had to pad out.

741
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:01,280
If you look at the yellow suit, they obviously had to pad out the legs and arms

742
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:05,040
because because, like, for instance, right, there were

743
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,840
on star tours now, there are the robots that check your luggage.

744
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:10,920
Do you know what I'm talking about?

745
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:13,320
That go like there's not your luggage.

746
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:16,600
They test luggage and they're like, yeah, whatever.

747
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,600
And they're like pointing at that.

748
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,200
That's a prerequisite to get on the ride.

749
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,400
You have to bring luggage.

750
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:24,240
Yeah, you have to you have to check a bag to do it.

751
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:27,440
But you can see the robot has a little tail and those are like

752
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,640
they were what geese on America Sings.

753
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:33,400
They were they originally like a bird, a robot bird.

754
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:37,440
So I'm guessing that these aren't just exoskeletons under here,

755
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,480
but it would be funny if it was just like,

756
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:44,280
you know, when the Terminator is burned and it's just a skeleton underneath

757
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:47,240
underneath the yellow suit.

758
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:49,160
It's possible it is. I don't know.

759
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,440
We got to get to the bones.

760
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,760
They're going to see what's down there.

761
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:55,880
If if that's the case, I mean, I will say it's incredibly impressive

762
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:59,680
that they were able to build a monster's ink ride, just like

763
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:03,080
put a monster's ink paint over this star, you know,

764
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:07,480
it's pretty clever because it's the right slaps, the monster's ink right.

765
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,880
Yeah, you know what I mean?

766
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,640
Yeah, definitely.

767
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,640
It makes sense.

768
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,360
Are you? Yeah.

769
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,880
Wow. This literal one to one ratio.

770
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,080
There's so many.

771
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:20,600
And apparently even it's not even all the hazmat suits.

772
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:24,360
They're apparently Regis Philbin turned into Randall.

773
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:27,960
The the chameleon Steve Buscemi.

774
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:31,200
Carrie, that one's really hard to parse.

775
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,680
He's got money in his hands in the Regis version.

776
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,320
And then it's just a weird clause.

777
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,200
Yeah, they did the most work with this.

778
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,800
Share that shares just another hazmat anyway.

779
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:42,960
Yeah. So bizarre to look at these.

780
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,680
Yeah, they did a really seamless job.

781
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:48,120
I was trying to think and I haven't been on every ride ever.

782
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:50,360
So I can't really make an official ruling.

783
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:54,600
But this is maybe like the number two redo behind.

784
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:58,480
Like there's a ride in Japan called Sinbad that I love.

785
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,480
That's amazing.

786
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,960
But it was a much different ride in its first version.

787
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:04,480
And if you go on it now, you wouldn't necessarily know

788
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,120
that it was in this strange.

789
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:06,920
I mean, you wouldn't know.

790
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,920
We didn't know there was a very strange version before.

791
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,600
And I think it's the same with this. Right.

792
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,720
If you go on Monster's Inc, you wouldn't be like, oh, this is clear.

793
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:15,360
Sinbad based on the adventure or the comedian?

794
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,040
Well, the adventure.

795
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,120
The adventure.

796
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,600
Comedian. It's not.

797
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,600
That's an idea. That's another million dollar.

798
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,840
It's not about Sinbad.

799
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:28,520
You watch him like you watch his experiences growing up,

800
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:31,840
what inspired his standup, the colorful characters in the neighborhood

801
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:34,200
that influenced his bits

802
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,880
and what he's doing in his golden years.

803
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,120
Yeah.

804
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:41,640
Now, believe me, I would have said that's one of the best rides ever, too,

805
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:42,760
if I had gone on.

806
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:45,760
Yeah, Sinbad's journey to comedy fame.

807
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,400
The now did you guys come across?

808
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,400
I don't think we talked about this with Superstar Limo before, but the whole.

809
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:57,880
So in the timeline of it, like within the first year of that ride being open,

810
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:58,960
it was like we have to do something.

811
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,200
We got to get people.

812
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,560
We got to get this ride out of here.

813
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:05,440
But there were other people saying we can't lose that capacity.

814
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:09,320
This ride does eat people even though and there's not a lot to do in this park.

815
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,440
So I don't know if it can go offline for that long.

816
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:14,280
Can we keep the bones and do something with it?

817
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:18,200
And Monsters Inc is what they landed on is that what Monsters Inc came out in,

818
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:19,360
what, 2003.

819
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,200
So they didn't have even have that option.

820
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,680
2001 to do a ride out of.

821
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,640
Oh, what's 2001? OK, sorry.

822
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,880
So they could have, but they didn't make it there for a little bit.

823
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:34,000
Do you guys know about what it almost was instead of Monsters Inc?

824
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:38,560
Oh, my gosh. Wait, was it a Chicken Little ride?

825
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,160
Oh, yeah. What?

826
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,520
I'll tell me it was Chicken Little.

827
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:45,680
Oh, I'm on the rain.

828
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:49,960
What? That is the I think that's the actually that's not the worst Disney

829
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:52,000
animated movie of all time. What's the worst?

830
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,160
It's dinosaur. Do you remember dinosaur?

831
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,280
You think dinosaurs are worse on this?

832
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,600
Well, now here's the question. You've seen dinosaur.

833
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:03,680
Do you remember when they obviously, you know, the main character, Aladar?

834
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:08,040
We all love Aladar, the primary dinosaur in dinosaur.

835
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,680
The iconic. Yeah, the iconic.

836
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:15,640
Remember when Aladar is a baby, he's just born and you see him

837
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,680
pee and fart.

838
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:22,600
Do you have any recollection about like how you felt about the baby version

839
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:25,400
of the character Aladar?

840
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,680
Off like off putting incredibly strange.

841
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:30,120
Oh, yeah. Oscar, look at Oscar.

842
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:31,440
Look at I hate it.

843
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,840
I hate this. Disgusting.

844
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:36,200
Why? Why bring this up?

845
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,920
A debate for what feels like a year.

846
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:43,480
I am apparently the only until now the only person

847
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:46,440
who didn't find that to be specifically cute.

848
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:51,560
The key, the word cute and in fact, very cute has been used by our

849
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:55,080
by people on the show, by much of our audience.

850
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:56,240
There's no way.

851
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,640
Thank you. Jason and I think that's cute.

852
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:01,160
He's cute. He's cute.

853
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:02,120
Cute little guy.

854
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:03,840
Explain to me why that is.

855
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,560
All right. Well, he's wiggling around.

856
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:06,640
Let me bring it back up.

857
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,840
No, Jason. No, Jason. I'm sorry.

858
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:11,000
Look at. OK, here's the baby.

859
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,800
Aladar is farting on the bottom here and he like lets out a tooth.

860
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:17,840
Look at his little like face like it's so maybe it's just

861
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:19,240
maybe I just need to have a baby.

862
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:21,320
Maybe that's what's ticking in my head.

863
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:26,000
But no, look, he looks like a baby that is like 10.

864
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:28,880
Your baby is a satiate, Scott.

865
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,120
Babe, I have one.

866
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:31,040
You don't need one.

867
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,360
Babies are cute. This is not.

868
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,960
I don't like this because it looks like it has real.

869
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:39,880
It looks too much like a human and it has that weird animatronic

870
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:45,520
uncanny valley vibe that I don't go senses being spoken on this podcast.

871
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:48,240
We've regained cheeks.

872
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,160
And he got your own pockets.

873
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,760
The dinosaurs don't have cheeks.

874
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,760
Yes, they do look as little cheeks kind of like he like

875
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,800
there's a little sneeze when he lets out his little fart.

876
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,560
Like it's so cute.

877
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:01,600
He's got the little he's got these little arms like his little like

878
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:04,760
that's very cute to the short arms with kind of the wide body.

879
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:05,800
Don't like this.

880
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:08,400
Every technological marvel.

881
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:10,960
OK, yes.

882
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,000
Humans have progressed.

883
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,120
Getting the beginning of the new century.

884
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:18,120
This was a technological marvel, a technical.

885
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:22,040
Logical Marvel was the flying whales in Fantasia 2000.

886
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:24,320
That was a technological marvel.

887
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:26,520
And then we didn't need dinosaur.

888
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:29,960
We didn't need this weird technological experiment that was.

889
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:31,360
I'm keeping this up.

890
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:32,240
We certainly didn't need chicken.

891
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:33,920
I'm just kind of forgot.

892
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,320
No, no, no.

893
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:40,840
I'm like conducting a little orchestra here, much like the evil Ivan Ooze.

894
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:42,880
I'm like, yes, finally.

895
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,480
Oh, yes, Oscar.

896
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:48,960
Keep complaining, Mike and Jason, defend yourselves.

897
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,680
I I'm happy to defend.

898
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:55,440
I'm happy to throw the topic out now and do another hour.

899
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:58,800
I can't believe that.

900
00:44:58,800 --> 00:44:59,320
I'm baby.

901
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:00,680
Have you seen the movie, Mike?

902
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:02,880
Have you seen? No.

903
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:03,640
No, I haven't.

904
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:05,080
Wait, you haven't seen it.

905
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:07,080
No, I forgot about that.

906
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:11,040
Mike got a new phone last year and he's like, oh, guys, hey, check it out.

907
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:14,080
I got the new iPhone, like sent us a screenshot and baby.

908
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:16,760
Yeah, that's the man with the wall.

909
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:18,320
They always look at it.

910
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:20,640
He wants to look at every day.

911
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:25,160
I was crazy and had to photograph, had to get a second device

912
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:30,760
to photograph his phone to make sure we saw that that was the wallpaper.

913
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:36,000
Lindsay, Lindsay, my girlfriend, Oscar, you've done her podcast many times.

914
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,160
I texted her during that time and she said, yes, very cute.

915
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:40,240
She agreed with me.

916
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:42,680
No, I love Lindsay to death.

917
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:45,960
But this is where this is where both of you are incorrect.

918
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,480
Boy, this is well, I just want to tap out here.

919
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:51,520
I'm worried it's this is this is this episode is peak for me.

920
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:54,720
I just need to go like I feel like I've been to the spa because.

921
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:59,480
OK, Mike and Jason, do you find a lot of things cute?

922
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:00,680
That might be it.

923
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:03,720
Oh, if you think that they're the aladar is cute,

924
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:05,800
then you might think like everything is cute.

925
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:08,440
Well, I'm not a man who's afraid to call something cute.

926
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:11,080
Like I would call something cute.

927
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:14,600
So I am not opposed to the term.

928
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:17,200
I'm not a cute troller.

929
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:20,600
I believe I don't believe that I've been accused, I think, by Scott of trolling,

930
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:23,920
calling people cute just for troll purposes.

931
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:26,320
And I don't believe I do that because

932
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:29,040
there's been characters on the show and the Patreon, at least,

933
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,120
that we've discussed that I think are not cute.

934
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:36,040
And I'm not like Fuzzbucket is a movie that came out on the Disney Channel.

935
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:38,320
I know Fuzzbucket very well. Yes.

936
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:42,640
And I hate Fuzzbucket is a little turd and I hate him.

937
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:45,280
And you're just a hater, Mike.

938
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:47,200
OK, that's it. You're just a hater.

939
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,480
I get it. OK, that's fine.

940
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:50,160
But that's OK.

941
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:54,080
But Riff, the fourth Barney and Friends character,

942
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:57,120
which is he's an orange.

943
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:58,520
Turning away.

944
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:00,600
That was a big, that was a long take.

945
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:03,640
You you you might just like dinosaurs, I think, because there's.

946
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:05,600
Oh, yeah. I am a dinosaur fan.

947
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:08,000
I have a question for I have a question for all of y'all.

948
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,840
OK. Yeah. Who is cuter?

949
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:15,200
Baby Aladar or Boo from Monstersling Boo?

950
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:16,920
No, OK. All right.

951
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:19,720
OK, well, I'm going to wait in yet.

952
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:23,080
Let me take a look here.

953
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:26,000
No, remember, like, is really cute.

954
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:29,120
This is ridiculous.

955
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:33,800
The way she calls, she calls Sully Kitty and she calls Mike Mike Wasowski.

956
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:36,200
I mean, just to me, like, you know, thank you.

957
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:38,360
Oh, it's yeah.

958
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:39,920
Maybe one advocate.

959
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:42,840
Yeah, I'll say boo. I'll say.

960
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:45,680
All right. But grudgingly, but I don't even know.

961
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:47,680
You didn't want to say it.

962
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:50,480
If your heart couldn't. I don't want to say it.

963
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:53,600
I feel like it was sort of set up here in this question to make baby

964
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:56,240
all that I look bad, but I will admit I'm an honest.

965
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:57,480
I'm not a cute troller.

966
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:59,640
Nobody puts baby Aladar in a corner.

967
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,680
But you you think

968
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:05,880
Dinosaur is a worse movie than The Good Dinosaur.

969
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:08,080
Oh, my God.

970
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:12,080
That's a great question, because they were both atrocious films.

971
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:16,760
OK, so the only thing that saves the Good Dinosaur

972
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:20,520
is where they eat those berries that are hallucinogenic.

973
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:25,200
And there's not like weird trippy animation that was like too short,

974
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,360
way too short.

975
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:27,080
Yeah.

976
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:32,680
That's the reason why I would rank The Good Dinosaur higher than Dinosaur.

977
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:36,680
Dinosaur looked just like brown crap.

978
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:37,680
Yes.

979
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:39,880
Like cracked dirt is the.

980
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:42,080
Most of that movie.

981
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:45,080
You're just looking at like sad ground.

982
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:48,680
That's what it is.

983
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:50,280
It's like weird clay.

984
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:54,680
It's like someone tried to do a, you know, claymation project.

985
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:57,680
And just like didn't color any of the figures.

986
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:00,880
Good Dinosaur, though, I didn't see dinosaur in theaters

987
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:01,880
and I would have been a kid.

988
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:04,280
So it's not like I could have been like, let's walk out.

989
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:08,080
But like Good Dinosaur was the closest I've ever been.

990
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:12,080
I imagine baby Jason just that those are his first words.

991
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:15,680
That is something baby Jason would say.

992
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:19,480
But but seeing Good Dinosaur, I can picture sitting in the Arclight

993
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:22,280
Pasadena going like, what's that?

994
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:24,480
Policy of getting your money back?

995
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:27,080
Like, is it too far into the move?

996
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:31,080
Like and I knew I think it was probably not helped by like I knew going in.

997
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:34,080
They had like fired everyone from the good guy.

998
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:37,080
They fired the whole voice cast and they brought on new direct.

999
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:38,480
Like it was such a debacle.

1000
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:39,480
It was a mess.

1001
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:40,480
The trouble.

1002
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:41,480
It was a mess.

1003
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:44,880
So probably feeding not even despite it being a hot mess.

1004
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:48,880
It's not it doesn't compare to Dinosaur, which I think is a bigger mess.

1005
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:49,880
I have not said it is.

1006
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:51,080
I said it in my podcast.

1007
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:53,480
I said it in inside the Disney of all I told listeners.

1008
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:58,280
I was like, listen, if you if Dinosaur is your favorite Disney movie of all time,

1009
00:49:58,280 --> 00:49:58,880
let me know.

1010
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:05,080
And I've had four people reach out for people thinking that dinosaur is the best

1011
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:09,080
Disney animated movie, better than Aladdin, better than Lion King.

1012
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:14,480
Yes, better than fucking Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, better than those movies.

1013
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:16,480
But did you serve when they saw it?

1014
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,680
But did you serve when they saw it?

1015
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:23,880
Because if you see a movie, any movie at the right range, like anything,

1016
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:26,280
and I think, yeah, I think and that's it.

1017
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:28,480
Yeah, they were like, I saw it at my formative years.

1018
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:30,280
I was like, OK, well, yeah, there it is.

1019
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:32,480
And that happens with theme park rides.

1020
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:33,480
Yeah.

1021
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:34,480
Yes.

1022
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:38,280
Boy, there's boy, there's enough opinions out there for everyone to have,

1023
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:42,080
I guess, like the most craziest opinion you can imagine.

1024
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:43,280
Somebody has it.

1025
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:44,280
Yeah.

1026
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:48,280
I mean, if you put it out on the Internet, people will, I mean, love to engage.

1027
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:51,880
Yeah, well, and more dinosaur discourse.

1028
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:55,680
We stepped right in it like an Aladar poop.

1029
00:50:55,680 --> 00:51:00,080
So, oh, no, no.

1030
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:05,680
Oh, I bet it's really like a real nice shape, a cute shape.

1031
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:06,680
No.

1032
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:07,680
Oh, boy.

1033
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:11,880
OK, so to back up, because I think we left it hanging where it did sound like I was

1034
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:13,680
saying that there was a home on the range ride proposed.

1035
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:15,280
I don't think that's the case.

1036
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:20,080
What they wanted to do, the quickest fix they could imagine for this ride was

1037
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:21,480
we're not going to change the vehicles.

1038
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:24,480
We're not even we're going to try to not change the settings if we don't have to.

1039
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:27,680
But we got to get these creepy celebrity animatronics out of there.

1040
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:29,080
But what do you replace them with?

1041
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:31,280
You can't just have people go through cardboard flats.

1042
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:32,880
Well, wait a minute.

1043
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:34,080
We have just started.

1044
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:34,880
It was 2001.

1045
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:39,880
We have just started redoing all of the Disney stores in America.

1046
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:41,480
We're starting to gapify them.

1047
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:47,080
We're making them as boring as they can possibly be, just like a big swishy D

1048
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:50,080
instead of like the fun characters up.

1049
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:52,880
And because if you remember what Disney stores used to be like, and some of them

1050
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:59,080
are like the whole second layer of the store, essentially are a bunch of characters

1051
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:00,680
often filming a movie.

1052
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:04,080
I think it depends store to store what it is they're doing and what characters are

1053
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:08,280
up there. But they were starting to retire that theme and get rid of all of these,

1054
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:12,880
not animatronics, but like maquettes, essentially of all the classic characters

1055
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:13,880
that could turn and stuff.

1056
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:22,680
They wanted to flood Superstar limo with yanked Disney store maquettes and call it

1057
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:24,880
Goofy's Superstar limo.

1058
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:27,680
This was a plan on the table for a long time.

1059
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:33,480
And it got far enough that then head of the resort, Paul Pressler, was given an

1060
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:35,680
after hours tour of the park.

1061
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:40,080
At least they did part of the ride decked out with rejected characters that were

1062
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:43,280
sitting in the Disney store warehouse.

1063
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:45,680
They like decked it out for us.

1064
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:48,080
So this ride did kind of exist.

1065
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:48,880
That's audacious.

1066
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:50,680
Isn't that bizarre? Like weird.

1067
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:51,480
Could you imagine?

1068
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:56,680
They buy up figures from malls in Ohio and Indiana and truck them out to Anaheim.

1069
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:58,280
And that's your ride now.

1070
00:52:58,280 --> 00:52:59,880
What would be the storyline?

1071
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:05,480
Goofy's, if it was Goofy's Superstar limo, is it so it must be all the same stuff.

1072
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:09,280
Like it's you're on the way to a movie premiere for Goofy.

1073
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:14,480
But then like the three little pigs are going to like give you a makeover.

1074
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:15,880
Like is it that kind of thing?

1075
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:18,880
Everyone's favorite Disney characters, the three little pigs.

1076
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:19,880
You see them a lot.

1077
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:22,880
You know, nobody really cares about them.

1078
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:28,680
You know, Dumbo is going to read you the Hollywood Reporter on the way.

1079
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:30,080
I don't I don't know.

1080
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:32,280
Where where are Goofy's real friends at?

1081
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:34,280
Where's Donald? Where's Mickey?

1082
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:37,280
Where's Daisy? Maybe you got to save them because like

1083
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:43,480
you can't use more than one unless we're going by Mickey verse multiverse rules.

1084
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:46,080
You can't have like 20 Mickey's in the ride.

1085
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:48,080
I don't know.

1086
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:49,880
Mike, you never came across this odd.

1087
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:51,880
This was like a Jim Hill discovery a long time ago.

1088
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:54,280
No, I missed this. This is very strange.

1089
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:57,480
Yeah, it feels like I mean, if you if you just think,

1090
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:02,480
OK, take Superstar Limo and you just replace up replace, put Goofy on the ride.

1091
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:05,680
It's still obviously a bad ride, but it's not.

1092
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:11,880
Horrible, like whatever the the scale of the characters,

1093
00:54:12,380 --> 00:54:14,880
it must have all been so odd for them to go.

1094
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:16,980
There's no way we can do this.

1095
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:19,480
This looks so. Yeah, well, because they're small.

1096
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:22,180
The yeah, right. The biggest issue.

1097
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:25,480
With with the ride was that there was.

1098
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:29,480
OK, the magic with the dark rides is that there is a storyline.

1099
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:30,980
There's a narrative happening.

1100
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:35,680
Yeah, the narrative of like going to a movie premiere is so loose, so flimsy.

1101
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:40,280
There's nothing there for for them to just replace it with Goofy.

1102
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:42,780
It's still going to suck because there's no story.

1103
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:44,480
At least with Monsters Inc. There's a narrative.

1104
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:46,780
They literally copy the plot of Monster's Inc.

1105
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:50,680
But it's like, what can I attach myself to and Goofy's Superstar Limo?

1106
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:54,280
No, I think you could force one in.

1107
00:54:54,980 --> 00:54:57,480
But it would be expensive.

1108
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:06,080
And my pitch is that Goofy is trying to get to the premiere of the Goofy movie

1109
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:08,580
and he's causing chaos in Los Angeles.

1110
00:55:08,580 --> 00:55:10,480
He's goofing everything up.

1111
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:13,480
But then you got to get Max in there.

1112
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:15,080
You got to get Roxanne in there.

1113
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:17,480
You got to get Pete in there.

1114
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:21,680
You know, you got to get all these guys and all these all these other characters.

1115
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:23,180
But then there's power line in there.

1116
00:55:23,180 --> 00:55:24,480
You got to get power.

1117
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:26,380
Yeah, he knocks.

1118
00:55:26,380 --> 00:55:29,280
He unplugs the power at a power line concert.

1119
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:30,080
Oh, I like that.

1120
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:31,080
They just go.

1121
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:34,380
Why doesn't this power line concert the place they're going to?

1122
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:36,180
Oh, that's good.

1123
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:37,180
Oh, yeah, it doesn't even have to be.

1124
00:55:37,180 --> 00:55:38,580
He's in a limo to a concert.

1125
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:41,880
VIP at the power line concert because he's trying to help.

1126
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:43,280
It doesn't have to be a limo.

1127
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:45,880
It could be his car, which is a reference to the Goofy.

1128
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:48,480
Why isn't there just a Goofy movie ride?

1129
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:52,580
Because then you can have like the you know, Disney loves these like drops.

1130
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:53,480
You know what I mean?

1131
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:55,980
And there was a waterfall scene in a Goofy movie.

1132
00:55:55,980 --> 00:55:58,180
You could incorporate that in the right.

1133
00:55:58,180 --> 00:55:59,480
It's yeah, that would be great.

1134
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:02,080
I mean, it's timing timing wise.

1135
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:04,580
Everything was falling apart when Goofy movie came out.

1136
00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:05,980
Sadly, that's true.

1137
00:56:05,980 --> 00:56:08,580
You feel like you're a Disney disaster.

1138
00:56:08,580 --> 00:56:13,080
Yeah, if I feel like if they announce that now we're doing a Goofy movie ride,

1139
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:17,780
I feel like people would like the most ardent fans would be pretty fucking psyched.

1140
00:56:17,780 --> 00:56:20,880
Oh, yeah, because there is a huge fan base for that movie.

1141
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:21,980
Yeah. Yeah.

1142
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:22,980
Yes, it for sure.

1143
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:26,680
Yeah, I they don't they're not like doing cool stuff like that.

1144
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:29,280
And I know that sounds like that's one of the dorkiest thing to say.

1145
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:32,180
They're not doing cool stuff like make a Goofy movie ride.

1146
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:38,880
It's not really what I'm they're not doing like you mean it is an asterisk next to your cool.

1147
00:56:39,380 --> 00:56:43,680
Yeah. Yeah. Well, it's like when I it's like when I said that like a box lunch

1148
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:47,680
at the mall has hip Disney merch like wristy cats merch.

1149
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:48,880
I was like, all right.

1150
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:52,380
Well, hip, I guess is not really.

1151
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:55,780
Hey, kids, come on in.

1152
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:56,980
Take a seat.

1153
00:56:56,980 --> 00:56:59,380
Let me tell you about the great mouse detective.

1154
00:56:59,380 --> 00:57:01,780
Yeah, that's a hip choice.

1155
00:57:01,780 --> 00:57:03,980
That's a for your Disney shirt.

1156
00:57:03,980 --> 00:57:06,880
Hey, kids, have you heard of fun and fancy free?

1157
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:07,880
There you go.

1158
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:09,980
It's what they called packaged film.

1159
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:12,280
Very melody.

1160
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:14,080
Hey, you know, Looney Tunes was a later.

1161
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:17,580
Mary Melody's is what they used to call them back in my day.

1162
00:57:18,380 --> 00:57:22,780
Look, I wish you kids are all probably about the lunatics.

1163
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:26,680
The extreme ass kicking Looney Tunes.

1164
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:30,480
Yes. The managers like Greg were going to have to we're going to have to buy.

1165
00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:33,780
Voice uses you can't talk really off putting.

1166
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:37,580
Mike, I'll give you credit, though.

1167
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:38,280
I know what you mean.

1168
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:42,180
You like they will they will invest in a number of few palettes of like power line

1169
00:57:42,180 --> 00:57:47,680
t-shirts and lapel pins, but I won't they won't like commit to a multimillion

1170
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:50,380
dollar. No, it needs to be something they're confident in now.

1171
00:57:50,380 --> 00:57:54,380
They're going to make like three to six movies of sadly, like it doesn't feel like

1172
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:59,680
unless it's like truly like Disney Vault classic, then like in Tokyo, they're

1173
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:00,980
building a new right.

1174
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:02,380
Are they building a new Peter Pan or in Tokyo?

1175
00:58:02,380 --> 00:58:03,680
That's right. Yeah, that's right.

1176
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:06,880
Yeah. Yeah. So like something like that, maybe they'll build and they're building

1177
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:08,580
they built the beauty and the beast ride there.

1178
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:11,880
So unless it's one of their prestige things, it's only going to be new stuff.

1179
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:17,580
I feel like and not cool, edgy Disney material like goofy movie like the black

1180
00:58:17,580 --> 00:58:24,180
cauldron or Oliver and Company, the cool ass shit that Disney used to make.

1181
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:29,780
Huey Lewis, nothing cooler than Huey Huey Mike.

1182
00:58:29,780 --> 00:58:32,080
And for the listeners, Mike just put on a bolo tie.

1183
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:33,780
Yeah, I'm cool now.

1184
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:36,480
I'm changed. I'm cooler.

1185
00:58:38,180 --> 00:58:41,080
Yeah. So I wish I mean, I wish

1186
00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:47,780
as I think I've we've said on the show, I think I to I is the best Disney song ever made.

1187
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:53,880
Maybe it's like part of your world and I to I is they're tied maybe.

1188
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:56,080
Hmm.

1189
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:58,080
Ty. Oh, wow. Yeah.

1190
00:58:58,080 --> 00:58:59,680
I yeah, I died as a slapper.

1191
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:02,880
I have a weird bizarre favorite.

1192
00:59:03,180 --> 00:59:07,780
Go ahead. And it's from the 1977 movie The Rescuers.

1193
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:09,480
Oh, I think I know.

1194
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:12,980
And it is from it's called The Journey and it's

1195
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:17,880
the very beginning intro song in the opening credits

1196
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:22,580
where it's it's sung in the perspective of a message in a bottle

1197
00:59:23,580 --> 00:59:25,880
saying and it's it's in the sea.

1198
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:29,780
It's in the ocean waves and it's a beautiful montage opening

1199
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:33,280
credits where they're going on a journey.

1200
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:35,380
Hence the song. And it's beautiful.

1201
00:59:35,380 --> 00:59:38,880
It's great. It's sort of like the Carpenter's except a little spooky,

1202
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:40,480
a little bizarre. And I love it.

1203
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:42,180
I think that's my favorite Disney song ever.

1204
00:59:42,180 --> 00:59:44,580
Oh, my God. I've certainly seen the movie, but I don't remember this.

1205
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:45,980
Yeah, it's not stick.

1206
00:59:45,980 --> 00:59:48,480
It that does actually doesn't stick out because I haven't seen the movie in a long time.

1207
00:59:48,580 --> 00:59:50,280
That's I mean, it sounds great.

1208
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:51,680
It sounds like that'll be so good.

1209
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:55,580
That immediately will be back in our that'll be one of the hipper things we like.

1210
00:59:55,580 --> 01:00:00,080
Once you put it on a radar, I think that's what the song itself.

1211
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:02,980
But yeah, the rescuers, the rescuers is already, of course, very hip

1212
01:00:02,980 --> 01:00:04,480
because it's a little more obscure, too.

1213
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:06,180
But the song specifically.

1214
01:00:06,180 --> 01:00:07,480
Well, and right.

1215
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:10,680
I remember watching the rescuers somehow as a kid.

1216
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:15,480
But the VHS I had was rescuers down under, which is like the tonal op.

1217
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:19,880
It's like the brightest movie I can remember from my childhood because it's an off trail.

1218
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:21,580
It's just so much sunlight. Yes.

1219
01:00:21,580 --> 01:00:27,180
And that first rescuers is so dark, black, dim, green, dim and stuff.

1220
01:00:27,180 --> 01:00:30,780
That is such a such an interesting switch between those two.

1221
01:00:30,780 --> 01:00:33,280
What song was in the rescuers down under?

1222
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:34,480
What was there like?

1223
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:36,080
Is there one? I don't know the answer.

1224
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:38,880
What was your song song years later, too?

1225
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:41,180
That was like there was a pretty big gap between those movies.

1226
01:00:41,180 --> 01:00:42,980
I cannot recall. That's a lot.

1227
01:00:42,980 --> 01:00:48,280
I don't think there is a Oliver and Company was one of my first like in theater movies.

1228
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:49,980
So I as a kid. Oh, yeah.

1229
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:51,880
Oh, that's good. That has good music.

1230
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:53,480
It does. Yeah. Should I?

1231
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:55,680
Why should I worry?

1232
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:58,380
That's a good song. And then Bette Midler has a song in there as well.

1233
01:00:58,380 --> 01:00:59,480
That's also the bond.

1234
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:02,180
You know, maybe my favorite Disney song is the Huey Lewis.

1235
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:10,280
Once upon a time in New York City, which I just learned was a Howard Ashman, actually, like a quieter.

1236
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:12,280
Yeah, I even referenced in the documentary.

1237
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:16,280
But Howard Ashman meets Huey Lewis, which is pretty cool.

1238
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:17,680
That is a good that is good.

1239
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:19,380
Interesting. One of the synthier Disney songs.

1240
01:01:19,380 --> 01:01:24,580
So that that adds up for me to go back to this this pre Monsters Inc.

1241
01:01:24,580 --> 01:01:26,080
history. There's one more thing I want to throw out.

1242
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:30,680
This one seems like this. I don't know that this one got any got anywhere.

1243
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:37,480
But also, Jim Hill claims that there was almost a they almost redid it quickly into Miss Piggy's Superstar limo.

1244
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:40,480
All right. I was trying to throw them up.

1245
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:43,280
They're really hung up on the superstar aspect of the ride.

1246
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:46,380
Got to be a super star.

1247
01:01:46,380 --> 01:01:48,780
They love that name. Yeah.

1248
01:01:50,580 --> 01:01:53,380
Like Superstar wasn't a thing before.

1249
01:01:53,380 --> 01:01:55,280
I mean, I think it was a thing before.

1250
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:57,980
You know, why are they so near this and limo too?

1251
01:01:57,980 --> 01:01:59,980
Because, you know, the cars don't look like limos.

1252
01:01:59,980 --> 01:02:02,680
No, they're I mean in the monsters, they're caps.

1253
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:03,680
Yeah, it just changed.

1254
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:06,680
They are. Can you imagine that being a limo?

1255
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:08,880
Yeah, so oh, good.

1256
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:12,380
I was going to say, sometimes you can't let go of an idea.

1257
01:02:12,380 --> 01:02:16,480
Yeah, yeah, it's hard to say goodbye to those scrunched little limos.

1258
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:18,280
Yeah, but Monsters Inc.

1259
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:19,180
They did the right thing.

1260
01:02:19,180 --> 01:02:21,280
You get in a taxi. They changed entirely.

1261
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:22,780
The port authority. You get in a taxi.

1262
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:28,980
And it's great because it's like you walk in and then, you know, you get a picture of the city of Monstropolis.

1263
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:31,980
Like you get newspaper clippings, you know what's going on.

1264
01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:36,080
You get into the something that, you know, really isn't that explored in Monsters Inc.

1265
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:39,380
But you explore the actual city, which is like, oh, that's fun.

1266
01:02:39,380 --> 01:02:41,880
I feel like I'm a monster in this ride.

1267
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:48,180
It's very it does the job of making you feel like you are a citizen going on this journey.

1268
01:02:48,180 --> 01:02:49,780
So you sit in the car and it's great.

1269
01:02:49,780 --> 01:02:57,580
It's just it's fun. It's I think it's a well, I don't want to say a plus because it's not perfect, but it's an a ride for me.

1270
01:02:57,580 --> 01:03:00,280
Well, it's got a lot of tricks.

1271
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:11,980
I like like the at the top of the ride where you you see the footage of the monster giving like the man on the street and he's doing the like the the you know,

1272
01:03:11,980 --> 01:03:17,280
Yokel had been abducted by aliens like talking about the child with the eyes and tentacles.

1273
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:23,380
And you come around the corner of the ride and then you see the like statue maquette thing.

1274
01:03:23,380 --> 01:03:25,980
You see the interview happening in real life.

1275
01:03:25,980 --> 01:03:27,380
I think that's a nice trick.

1276
01:03:28,780 --> 01:03:32,380
The Randall, I mean a lot of the Randall tricks are very good.

1277
01:03:32,380 --> 01:03:40,080
Him swinging from the door color changing towards the end like Randall has sort of a similar.

1278
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:49,080
I know I'm realizing I'm cursing Randall poor Randall, but Randall has a very similar Jack Sparrow in Pirates vibe on this ride in a better way.

1279
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:51,280
He has more fun tricks of like, oh, there he is.

1280
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:52,680
There he is.

1281
01:03:52,780 --> 01:03:58,780
And it feels like they put some more time or yes, they're better things than just like Jack Sparrow and the barrel and stuff.

1282
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:03,280
Yeah, but I apologize to Randall for the association.

1283
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:04,480
Well, Randall is a villain.

1284
01:04:06,180 --> 01:04:07,980
You wouldn't mind this this ride.

1285
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:10,480
You know Randall's listening.

1286
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:13,280
I don't offend him and he's very sensitive.

1287
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:13,980
I know.

1288
01:04:13,980 --> 01:04:14,980
So that's what I was doing.

1289
01:04:15,980 --> 01:04:24,280
I mean this ride ate it by like, you know, the voices of like Steve Buscemi, Billy Crystal and John Goodman too.

1290
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:25,280
Like right.

1291
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:27,680
Then let's not forget Jennifer Tilly and Jennifer Tilly.

1292
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:29,080
That's what I that was the last one.

1293
01:04:29,080 --> 01:04:31,580
I was trying to think of like who is Cecilia?

1294
01:04:31,580 --> 01:04:34,380
Oh God, it's the goddess Jennifer Tilly.

1295
01:04:34,380 --> 01:04:42,880
And also, I mean it also the ride also has my favorite scene, which is Harryhausen's the sushi restaurant, which is a nice nod to.

1296
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:52,680
You know, the creator of all those stop motion movies from like the 50s, the 60s and 70s like Sinbad, those Sinbad movies.

1297
01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:56,280
And yeah, like I love all of that.

1298
01:04:56,280 --> 01:04:59,680
That chaotic scene in the restaurant was like so perfect.

1299
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:00,480
God, I loved it.

1300
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:01,280
Oh, I love that.

1301
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:02,280
That scene is the best.

1302
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:03,280
That's my favorite scene.

1303
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:06,180
I think that's like that's not a that's a common opinion to have.

1304
01:05:06,180 --> 01:05:12,480
I assume that's not crazy is that that seems like a lot of people love the Roz at the end.

1305
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:13,380
The doors are cool.

1306
01:05:13,380 --> 01:05:14,280
All that stuff is cool.

1307
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:16,580
But yeah, that sushi that's yeah.

1308
01:05:16,580 --> 01:05:23,680
And the ginger, of course, the smell in there, which I think we determined is probably the only theme park ginger smell that exists.

1309
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:27,480
I don't think we've found another example of them with fake smells.

1310
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:28,380
We did a fake.

1311
01:05:28,380 --> 01:05:31,680
We did a fake smell final four last year.

1312
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:37,280
Who broke down the best fake smells in theme parks and what's what was the best?

1313
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:38,180
It was it.

1314
01:05:38,180 --> 01:05:38,980
I forget it.

1315
01:05:38,980 --> 01:05:39,780
ET.

1316
01:05:39,780 --> 01:05:41,380
The ET ride.

1317
01:05:41,380 --> 01:05:41,880
Oh, yeah.

1318
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:43,380
Right. Of course, the forest.

1319
01:05:43,380 --> 01:05:45,180
Wait, what was the smell like a forest?

1320
01:05:45,180 --> 01:05:47,080
Wow.

1321
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:52,280
And so, yeah, so I forest but it's you know, that doesn't sound so great.

1322
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:56,480
But yeah, if you were there and if you go in Orlando, there's just a magic to it.

1323
01:05:56,480 --> 01:06:02,380
A musty magic is the right still.

1324
01:06:02,380 --> 01:06:02,880
Yeah, yeah.

1325
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:03,980
Still going to Florida.

1326
01:06:03,980 --> 01:06:04,680
Oh, yeah.

1327
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:05,780
Yeah, really.

1328
01:06:05,780 --> 01:06:07,980
They took it out at Universal.

1329
01:06:07,980 --> 01:06:08,380
Yeah.

1330
01:06:08,380 --> 01:06:09,380
Yeah.

1331
01:06:09,380 --> 01:06:10,180
Gone in Hollywood.

1332
01:06:10,180 --> 01:06:11,380
Oh, wow.

1333
01:06:11,380 --> 01:06:12,080
Yeah, so that one.

1334
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:14,080
But ginger was in the mix.

1335
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:16,080
Didn't make it that far.

1336
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:21,380
I will say this and I don't want to get us, we're being very positive and this will sound negative and I guess it's a little negative.

1337
01:06:21,380 --> 01:06:25,580
But I always forget about all this stuff because I don't go on this ride that often.

1338
01:06:25,580 --> 01:06:26,680
Mm-hmm.

1339
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:31,480
Because the queue, the exterior of the queue, inside the queue is great.

1340
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:38,680
I find it very kind of similar to like almost like Men in Black where I really appreciate how like mundane it feels.

1341
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:39,980
It feels like it's part of the world.

1342
01:06:39,980 --> 01:06:50,080
Both of those movies have aspects where you have like very mundane officey type like things put on fantastical, I don't know, constructs.

1343
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:52,680
I don't know what words I'm saying here, but you get what I'm saying.

1344
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:56,380
It's very like office like and then it's a fantastic world.

1345
01:06:56,380 --> 01:07:08,280
Yeah, I think to add on to that, Mike, I think that there's when it comes to getting on the ride, the waiting is the waiting element of it either makes you

1346
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:12,280
believe that you're like a stranger coming into this like strange land.

1347
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:17,780
So it either impresses or it emerges you into that world, right?

1348
01:07:17,780 --> 01:07:19,480
And I think the Monsters Inc.

1349
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:23,480
Ride does a really good job of making you feel like, oh, this is I impart.

1350
01:07:23,480 --> 01:07:29,280
This is like normal life for my character, the person that I am in this ride, you know,

1351
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:37,680
whereas like the Hogwarts ride in Universal Studios is very much like look, be impressed by all this cool stuff.

1352
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:38,680
Like, I don't think Monsters Inc.

1353
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:39,180
Does right.

1354
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:42,180
It's very much like this is your everyday life like.

1355
01:07:42,180 --> 01:07:43,780
Yeah, I mean, yeah, the fun of Monsters Inc.

1356
01:07:43,780 --> 01:07:50,780
is like the mundane this of it's putting on like just like making it making scaring kids,

1357
01:07:50,780 --> 01:07:54,280
not something that's mystical or fantastical.

1358
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:55,680
It's just like a job.

1359
01:07:55,680 --> 01:07:57,180
It's a boring job.

1360
01:07:57,180 --> 01:07:58,380
And that's what's fun about it.

1361
01:07:58,380 --> 01:08:04,380
And then you get that vibe initially of like you're going to work, which is which is fun.

1362
01:08:04,380 --> 01:08:10,380
But I will say the exterior and the place this ride is located sucks.

1363
01:08:10,380 --> 01:08:11,480
Yeah, it's bad.

1364
01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:16,280
And it doesn't that we've I think we've found this on a lot of episodes

1365
01:08:16,280 --> 01:08:20,680
and we found this with the Soarin in Florida versus Soarin out here the Soarin in Florida.

1366
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:23,280
I'm not happy with what's outside.

1367
01:08:23,280 --> 01:08:24,580
It's inside of a big building.

1368
01:08:24,580 --> 01:08:25,280
There's a lot of stuff.

1369
01:08:25,280 --> 01:08:31,280
It's kind of confusing and I don't really have any desire to go to it because of that, even though it's the same ride out here.

1370
01:08:31,380 --> 01:08:35,280
But the ride's version out here has a very cool hanger.

1371
01:08:35,280 --> 01:08:37,780
It's very inviting.

1372
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:38,980
The location makes sense.

1373
01:08:38,980 --> 01:08:47,280
And it's so interesting how I really feel like that makes a huge difference on if I go to the ride a lot or not is like what it looks like

1374
01:08:47,280 --> 01:08:54,980
and what the area around it feels like and the place it's in in California Adventure is this just weird empty lot.

1375
01:08:54,980 --> 01:09:00,980
Now that's been used a lot for different like festivals, the glow fest festival, the mad tea party.

1376
01:09:00,980 --> 01:09:07,680
These are all things I like, by the way, Tron, the Tron, whatever it's electronica electronica.

1377
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:10,980
But during the day, it's nothing.

1378
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:13,480
And it's just this weird empty square.

1379
01:09:13,480 --> 01:09:18,980
And then the exterior of Monsters Inc is just like flats, just sort of boring, cheap looking flats.

1380
01:09:18,980 --> 01:09:22,580
And every time and I feel like maybe I go once or twice a year on Monsters Inc.

1381
01:09:22,580 --> 01:09:26,180
And every time I go on and I go, hey, these things are great.

1382
01:09:26,180 --> 01:09:30,280
Why didn't I? But I never want to go on the ride.

1383
01:09:30,280 --> 01:09:35,480
And I swear it's just because of its location and what's going on with like traffic flow out there.

1384
01:09:35,480 --> 01:09:37,680
I yeah, I 100 percent agree.

1385
01:09:37,680 --> 01:09:42,180
It is in a weird. It's also I believe the only dark ride in California Adventure.

1386
01:09:42,180 --> 01:09:44,880
Well, Little Mermaid now. Little Mermaid now.

1387
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:49,180
Oh, Little Mermaid. Yes. But see, the Little Mermaid placement makes a lot of sense.

1388
01:09:49,180 --> 01:09:53,480
I mean, also it takes a lot of space for a not that impressive ride.

1389
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:57,980
And you know, with Monsters Inc is just sort of like.

1390
01:09:57,980 --> 01:10:02,180
In the middle of nowhere, it just feels very tossed out, like just like an afterthought.

1391
01:10:02,180 --> 01:10:03,780
Yeah, you know, so I totally agree.

1392
01:10:03,780 --> 01:10:05,180
Of course, it's like a messy.

1393
01:10:05,180 --> 01:10:09,880
It's like the last part of the park that's sort of untouched

1394
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:14,580
because, you know, they put all that money into it years ago now when Cars Land started.

1395
01:10:14,580 --> 01:10:17,580
And it feels like they've been like, we're we're getting to this.

1396
01:10:17,580 --> 01:10:19,380
We swear we're getting to this.

1397
01:10:19,380 --> 01:10:22,480
And then they like touched it with putting in Guardians ride.

1398
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:25,880
And they're like, we swear we're going to do something soon.

1399
01:10:25,880 --> 01:10:29,080
But in the meantime, we're going to throw like chairs in the middle

1400
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:33,280
and then we'll put like a Black Widow photo op or you can meet Black Panther

1401
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:35,080
or Captain Marvel over here.

1402
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:37,680
Yeah. But like by a soundstage.

1403
01:10:37,680 --> 01:10:39,080
And it's like, are they actors?

1404
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:41,580
That doesn't make any sense. It's chaotic.

1405
01:10:41,580 --> 01:10:42,980
It's just chaotic.

1406
01:10:42,980 --> 01:10:45,680
It's a lot like there's a lot going on every time you go there.

1407
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:48,480
Like when Jason and I were there for the Guardians opening, it was like

1408
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:50,780
the summer of heroes.

1409
01:10:50,780 --> 01:10:54,780
And then it's like this really like militaristic music plays

1410
01:10:54,780 --> 01:10:56,980
and an SUV drives by with a Black Widow.

1411
01:10:56,980 --> 01:11:00,280
And we're like, we're supposed to like Black Widow after this, like show

1412
01:11:00,280 --> 01:11:02,780
of military strength.

1413
01:11:02,780 --> 01:11:06,080
Like, yeah, of course, she's not doing it.

1414
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:10,480
Well, but I think the reason they haven't adjusted it in addition to cost is like

1415
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:14,380
the both pro and con thing of like

1416
01:11:14,580 --> 01:11:19,280
back lot soundstage themed areas is its container.

1417
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:22,180
You can put anything in the container like a movie's big hit.

1418
01:11:22,380 --> 01:11:23,580
You can get it in there.

1419
01:11:23,580 --> 01:11:28,580
Yeah. If we need we need something to distract people, we need something

1420
01:11:28,580 --> 01:11:31,880
that take people away

1421
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:33,380
from the main part of the park.

1422
01:11:33,380 --> 01:11:38,680
Well, put something short run in the back lot area because it's like a movie studio.

1423
01:11:38,680 --> 01:11:42,080
You can put any movie, you can put any TV show back there.

1424
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:46,480
I think the thing I like about the exterior is the

1425
01:11:47,080 --> 01:11:51,080
2D style of like the credits for Monsters Inc.

1426
01:11:51,080 --> 01:11:54,780
It's one of the movies where they do the credits kind of in like that 2D

1427
01:11:55,480 --> 01:11:57,180
throwback style.

1428
01:11:57,180 --> 01:12:01,580
And I would say the one thing I've always wanted to see from Pixar is a full length

1429
01:12:02,780 --> 01:12:07,980
2D animated film or like a 2D 3D combined like that paper man.

1430
01:12:07,980 --> 01:12:10,480
What are you, Jason? What are you saying?

1431
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:13,580
What are you? Because Pixar has never done that.

1432
01:12:13,580 --> 01:12:14,980
I know that's what I'm saying.

1433
01:12:14,980 --> 01:12:17,080
I think that's crazy.

1434
01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:19,780
Oscar, that's part of that.

1435
01:12:19,780 --> 01:12:20,680
Disney's job.

1436
01:12:20,680 --> 01:12:22,080
That's my hot take.

1437
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:23,180
You leave that to Disney.

1438
01:12:23,180 --> 01:12:24,280
Pixar does not do that.

1439
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:28,580
But that but what if they they could some of those shorts, they get a little

1440
01:12:28,580 --> 01:12:30,180
animated, you know, shorts.

1441
01:12:30,180 --> 01:12:30,880
Paper man is not.

1442
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:33,780
The shorts are a little different.

1443
01:12:33,780 --> 01:12:38,080
Yeah. But like that's that's that's dangerous talk, Jason.

1444
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:40,880
You know, the way that's dangerous talk.

1445
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:43,280
The wrong people hear that and you can be in serious trouble.

1446
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:48,280
But you do see like what people, you know, international like Secret of Kells or triplets

1447
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:53,380
of Belleville, like these very interesting 2D animated films.

1448
01:12:53,380 --> 01:12:56,980
And I think, you know, you're looking for more innovation.

1449
01:12:56,980 --> 01:13:00,780
Yes. Well, I'm just I'm thinking like, you know, you when you see like

1450
01:13:00,780 --> 01:13:05,180
Pixar artists like Doodle or like when they do shorts or they go off on produce

1451
01:13:05,180 --> 01:13:11,680
something on their own, it is often not like that CGI kind of style.

1452
01:13:11,680 --> 01:13:13,380
Right. And so I don't know.

1453
01:13:13,380 --> 01:13:16,880
I just think it would be interesting to know that is that's a good point

1454
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:21,180
because like I do remember in the 70s with 100 and walled dimensions

1455
01:13:21,180 --> 01:13:25,880
being like a shining example of this is that a lot of their animations

1456
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:29,780
were sort of shown as like rough drafts in the final animation.

1457
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:33,780
You could see the line drawings in 101 Dalmatians.

1458
01:13:33,780 --> 01:13:37,280
Like it just it looked a little like the scratchy.

1459
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:39,380
But it's yeah, the scratchiness.

1460
01:13:39,380 --> 01:13:43,580
And it was it added to the aesthetic of that movie.

1461
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:46,180
And I want to see more of that.

1462
01:13:46,180 --> 01:13:50,580
I want to see more of like, yeah, show us a little of like a pared down Pixar film.

1463
01:13:50,980 --> 01:13:55,680
Because it's like every Pixar film is such a friggin like a bullhorn every year.

1464
01:13:56,180 --> 01:14:00,880
It's like I want to see like a quieter or like a I don't know, like a gentler.

1465
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:03,380
One that doesn't have to be a tent so much.

1466
01:14:03,380 --> 01:14:05,380
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1467
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:08,480
Yes. Not a temple understated exactly that.

1468
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:11,380
Yeah. A little weirder. Give me an odd movie.

1469
01:14:11,380 --> 01:14:12,580
That isn't the good thing.

1470
01:14:12,580 --> 01:14:15,080
Well, I think baby elder should come back, quite frankly.

1471
01:14:15,580 --> 01:14:16,580
No!

1472
01:14:16,580 --> 01:14:17,780
In a new feature.

1473
01:14:18,780 --> 01:14:22,380
I was looking back through some rumors and for a while, I think before,

1474
01:14:22,380 --> 01:14:26,680
because like what probably will happen, I don't know what's going to be the final fate of Monster's Inc.

1475
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:31,380
But it does feel like Marvel will keep swallowing this part of the park within the next 10 years.

1476
01:14:31,380 --> 01:14:33,780
I don't know if they'll probably get rid of Monster's Inc.

1477
01:14:33,780 --> 01:14:40,380
And maybe maybe they take the heads off other characters and put different Marvel heads on perhaps.

1478
01:14:40,380 --> 01:14:44,880
Like Drew Carey's body will still be there, but it'll be like Hawkeye's head now.

1479
01:14:45,180 --> 01:14:46,680
Onto Carey's body.

1480
01:14:46,680 --> 01:14:49,280
Just a weird Jeremy Renner like head.

1481
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:49,980
With an...

1482
01:14:49,980 --> 01:14:53,580
Jeremy Renner head in the style of Superstar limo.

1483
01:14:53,580 --> 01:14:54,580
Oh, I got it. I got it. I got it.

1484
01:14:54,580 --> 01:14:55,780
It's Gambit's head.

1485
01:14:55,780 --> 01:15:01,280
Whoever they cast is Gambit because he has the four pamphlets and they turn them into playing cards.

1486
01:15:02,580 --> 01:15:03,380
That would be fan...

1487
01:15:03,380 --> 01:15:04,080
That's perfect.

1488
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:06,780
Look at that. I'm saving money for the company right here.

1489
01:15:06,780 --> 01:15:09,380
So it's the X-Men Superstar limo.

1490
01:15:09,380 --> 01:15:10,680
X-Men Superstar limo.

1491
01:15:10,680 --> 01:15:12,380
It has to be Superstar limo again.

1492
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:14,580
It has to be Superstar limo.

1493
01:15:14,680 --> 01:15:21,380
And Beast builds them all like they get rid of the Blackbird, the jet, and they still have a new limo that they ride around in.

1494
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:23,480
Well, because you're a student.

1495
01:15:23,480 --> 01:15:25,880
You're a student at the Xavier Institute, you know?

1496
01:15:25,880 --> 01:15:26,180
Yes.

1497
01:15:26,180 --> 01:15:28,880
So you haven't gotten to the jet yet.

1498
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:31,380
So you got to go on these like rinky-dink limos.

1499
01:15:31,380 --> 01:15:32,380
They're called.

1500
01:15:32,380 --> 01:15:34,380
But it stands for something, you know?

1501
01:15:34,380 --> 01:15:37,180
You got to drive them to make money to pay your way through school.

1502
01:15:37,680 --> 01:15:41,180
Yeah, for your predatory loan that Professor X loans you.

1503
01:15:41,180 --> 01:15:42,680
That is actually can...

1504
01:15:42,680 --> 01:15:54,780
Like I've been rereading the Chris Claremont, like the 70s and early 80s X-Men stuff, and they do have a long fancy car that like I guess it's like well, Professor X is a rich guy.

1505
01:15:54,780 --> 01:15:55,880
So he would have this.

1506
01:15:55,880 --> 01:16:02,180
But like when Cyclops needs to jaunt into that, they were going into the city to go to a nightclub.

1507
01:16:02,180 --> 01:16:04,680
He's like, well, let me just drive our big car.

1508
01:16:05,180 --> 01:16:08,380
See, so you can like you can weave that into the ride.

1509
01:16:08,380 --> 01:16:09,280
All of that.

1510
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:10,180
You know what I mean?

1511
01:16:10,180 --> 01:16:11,180
All of that story.

1512
01:16:11,180 --> 01:16:11,480
Yeah.

1513
01:16:11,480 --> 01:16:13,980
That's look, these are great ideas.

1514
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:16,680
But I hope that happens.

1515
01:16:16,680 --> 01:16:24,680
But there was a time, according to rumors and hearsay, that this section was just going to become monstropolis.

1516
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:25,680
Whoa, really?

1517
01:16:25,680 --> 01:16:26,680
Wow.

1518
01:16:26,680 --> 01:16:27,680
Oh, yeah.

1519
01:16:28,680 --> 01:16:31,680
So they were going to add more stuff to that part of the park?

1520
01:16:31,680 --> 01:16:33,180
Yeah, build it out more, make it look better.

1521
01:16:33,180 --> 01:16:41,680
And then there would have been also, I believe, I believe I was reading correctly that there would have been an additional ride, which was the Monsters Inc, which I've seen this rumor.

1522
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:44,680
And I'm sure this was for sure rumored for here and for Florida.

1523
01:16:44,680 --> 01:16:46,680
Monsters Inc door coaster.

1524
01:16:46,680 --> 01:16:47,680
Yeah.

1525
01:16:47,680 --> 01:16:51,680
It would have been a roller coaster, probably not a crazy one, but it would have been a roller coaster.

1526
01:16:51,680 --> 01:16:52,680
Yeah.

1527
01:16:53,680 --> 01:17:03,680
But it would have been a pretty fun little ride through like doors and through sort of the world, which seems great.

1528
01:17:03,680 --> 01:17:05,680
How would you be strapped into a door though?

1529
01:17:05,680 --> 01:17:06,680
Well, you're not in the door.

1530
01:17:06,680 --> 01:17:09,680
You'd probably be in some sort of, I'll say a limo.

1531
01:17:09,680 --> 01:17:11,680
Let's just say it's a fast limo.

1532
01:17:11,680 --> 01:17:12,680
You know.

1533
01:17:12,680 --> 01:17:18,680
Taxi cab, some sort of public transit to play up the sort of.

1534
01:17:18,680 --> 01:17:20,680
The door maintenance limo.

1535
01:17:20,680 --> 01:17:23,680
On the limo, it says this is a door painted on it.

1536
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:24,680
Yes.

1537
01:17:24,680 --> 01:17:30,680
So that, so yeah, there was a, there was a time I believe when that could have happened.

1538
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:37,680
I remember even people showing pictures of when they were going to demolish and now it's Mickey's Mickey and the magic.

1539
01:17:37,680 --> 01:17:38,680
What is no, not magical map.

1540
01:17:38,680 --> 01:17:39,680
Well, Philhar magic.

1541
01:17:39,680 --> 01:17:40,680
Geez.

1542
01:17:40,680 --> 01:17:41,680
Yeah.

1543
01:17:41,680 --> 01:17:48,680
They were going to demolish then the then Muppet Theater and they had the the balloons in the air, which they use in Imagineering to see how high things are.

1544
01:17:48,680 --> 01:17:52,680
Like if they would have to build, they use, they're not called trial balloons.

1545
01:17:52,680 --> 01:17:53,680
That's not right.

1546
01:17:53,680 --> 01:17:55,680
But that's a different thing.

1547
01:17:55,680 --> 01:17:57,680
They send the balloon boy up.

1548
01:17:57,680 --> 01:17:58,680
Yeah.

1549
01:17:58,680 --> 01:18:01,680
See if he gets high enough to get scared.

1550
01:18:01,680 --> 01:18:02,680
Right.

1551
01:18:02,680 --> 01:18:03,680
Falcon.

1552
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:04,680
Let me down.

1553
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:06,680
Let me down.

1554
01:18:06,680 --> 01:18:17,680
But I think on all four corners of the like existing building, they put a balloon up based on, okay, this ride will need to be this tall to see sight line wise, how it'll look from different parts of the park.

1555
01:18:17,680 --> 01:18:19,680
And to see what it would look like.

1556
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:20,680
Yeah.

1557
01:18:20,680 --> 01:18:24,680
Just to sort of visualize what it would look like if they had to build a very tall structure right there.

1558
01:18:24,680 --> 01:18:29,680
So I believe they even got as far as maybe measuring stuff like that to do that here.

1559
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:31,680
But I don't think it's going to happen.

1560
01:18:31,680 --> 01:18:34,680
I think it's going to be superstar limo with X.

1561
01:18:34,680 --> 01:18:35,680
No way.

1562
01:18:35,680 --> 01:18:36,680
That's kind of fascinating.

1563
01:18:36,680 --> 01:18:37,680
Are you seeing all of Hollywood?

1564
01:18:37,680 --> 01:18:42,680
Like if you just turn in that Hollywood area, is that Monstropolis from the get go?

1565
01:18:42,680 --> 01:18:56,680
I think it's just going to, the idea was maybe just those back lot, like the sound stages and that area they use for electronica and then with an additional ride and then maybe some eating thing or some restaurant.

1566
01:18:56,680 --> 01:18:57,680
That's cool.

1567
01:18:57,680 --> 01:18:58,680
Merch.

1568
01:18:58,680 --> 01:18:59,680
Harry houses.

1569
01:18:59,680 --> 01:19:00,680
Sure.

1570
01:19:00,680 --> 01:19:03,680
Harry has a good sushi place in the parks.

1571
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:04,680
That'd be amazing.

1572
01:19:04,680 --> 01:19:06,680
They don't have a sushi place at Disneyland.

1573
01:19:06,680 --> 01:19:07,680
That would have been great.

1574
01:19:07,680 --> 01:19:08,680
Oh man.

1575
01:19:08,680 --> 01:19:13,680
So yeah, so I think that was, yeah, there was a time when that was very possible.

1576
01:19:13,680 --> 01:19:14,680
But we'll see.

1577
01:19:14,680 --> 01:19:15,680
Wow.

1578
01:19:15,680 --> 01:19:18,680
Now we're going to get a fantastic four sushi restaurant.

1579
01:19:18,680 --> 01:19:20,680
It would have been the exact same sushi though we know.

1580
01:19:20,680 --> 01:19:21,680
It would have been the same quality.

1581
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:23,680
It would have been bad.

1582
01:19:23,680 --> 01:19:29,680
Yeah, it would have been bad sushi, but the one sushi is going to be real long.

1583
01:19:29,680 --> 01:19:32,680
One's going to be charred.

1584
01:19:32,680 --> 01:19:34,680
And one's going to be clear.

1585
01:19:34,680 --> 01:19:37,680
The wrapping is going to be like jellyfish clear.

1586
01:19:37,680 --> 01:19:41,680
And then the last one will just be on a rock plate.

1587
01:19:41,680 --> 01:19:45,680
Yeah, it's a valid cleanser.

1588
01:19:45,680 --> 01:19:46,680
Yeah.

1589
01:19:46,680 --> 01:19:51,680
Man, I mean, I want this expanded Monstropolis.

1590
01:19:51,680 --> 01:19:53,680
That sounds really good.

1591
01:19:53,680 --> 01:20:03,680
And because that, you know, when you're behind the flats and looking at that most usually empty stage where they don't do shows very often, that's one of my least favorite zones in a park.

1592
01:20:03,680 --> 01:20:04,680
Anywhere.

1593
01:20:04,680 --> 01:20:05,680
I really hate it.

1594
01:20:05,680 --> 01:20:06,680
And it's a boy.

1595
01:20:06,680 --> 01:20:10,680
It was so lame that around Christmas, that's one of the only things you could see.

1596
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:14,680
Just really added to the depression of the Christmas festivities.

1597
01:20:14,680 --> 01:20:17,680
They have to blow that whole zone up.

1598
01:20:17,680 --> 01:20:18,680
Whatever happened.

1599
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:20,680
I would love if Monsters Inc stayed as long as it could.

1600
01:20:20,680 --> 01:20:21,680
Yeah, oh yeah.

1601
01:20:21,680 --> 01:20:22,680
Yeah, right.

1602
01:20:22,680 --> 01:20:26,680
I think it does hurt and it puts you in like a weird bad mood when you're going on to the ride.

1603
01:20:26,680 --> 01:20:28,680
You think about not like, do I really want to walk over there?

1604
01:20:29,680 --> 01:20:35,680
Do I want to walk past all the scaffolding and the barely painted metal walls?

1605
01:20:35,680 --> 01:20:36,680
It's a bummer.

1606
01:20:36,680 --> 01:20:40,680
Yeah, the Monsters Inc ride is not a place you go first.

1607
01:20:40,680 --> 01:20:43,680
Technically, like usually, no one's like gunning for that ride.

1608
01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:44,680
You know what I mean?

1609
01:20:44,680 --> 01:20:47,680
No one's going to be like, I'm going to go to Disneyland to go to that ride and then go home.

1610
01:20:47,680 --> 01:20:48,680
No, that doesn't happen.

1611
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:51,680
It's usually the last ride of the day.

1612
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:55,680
You go to Disneyland and then you go to California Adventure, you know, and then you're tired at this point.

1613
01:20:55,680 --> 01:20:56,680
There's nothing.

1614
01:20:56,680 --> 01:20:58,680
There's nothing pretty to look at anymore.

1615
01:20:58,680 --> 01:21:03,680
You know, so like you're sort of in a bad mood going into it and that taints everything.

1616
01:21:03,680 --> 01:21:10,680
But I think there's a power to the ride where you come out of it feeling kind of renewed and feeling good.

1617
01:21:10,680 --> 01:21:13,680
It's a good one to like if you're bright and colorful and nice.

1618
01:21:13,680 --> 01:21:20,680
And well, and you see your friends, you see like the nice, you know, like Sully bonding with Boo, which is adorable.

1619
01:21:20,680 --> 01:21:25,680
I mean, any depiction of Sully anywhere, whether it's a walk around or on any ride, just

1620
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:28,680
I don't know. It's nice to see Sully is very lovable.

1621
01:21:28,680 --> 01:21:35,680
Yeah. And then if you're wearing Mickey ears, the Roz animatronic calls it calls out the fact that you're wearing ears.

1622
01:21:35,680 --> 01:21:39,680
And it's very nice. That's one of the things Roz can refer to.

1623
01:21:39,680 --> 01:21:44,680
Yeah. So she'll say like, oh, the lady in the front, nice ears.

1624
01:21:44,680 --> 01:21:49,680
Are those yours? And it's like that only gets triggered if you are wearing a Mickey Mouse ears.

1625
01:21:49,680 --> 01:21:51,680
I did not. I do not know that.

1626
01:21:51,680 --> 01:21:52,680
Very cool.

1627
01:21:52,680 --> 01:22:00,680
Roz work. Is that like one of those situations where there's like a number of phrases and somebody has to be there activating them?

1628
01:22:00,680 --> 01:22:06,680
Yes. Yeah. Yeah. It's one of those like I don't know if the Mr. Potato Head works the same way.

1629
01:22:06,680 --> 01:22:08,680
I think there's an actual actor.

1630
01:22:08,680 --> 01:22:13,680
No, there's not. It's a it's a button thing, I think, because it's Don Rickles voice.

1631
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:17,680
Oh, it's a button thing. But I think it's not a Don Rickles.

1632
01:22:18,680 --> 01:22:24,680
It's not like a 25 year old Don Rickles voice impressionist, because I think sometimes I'm sorry.

1633
01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:27,680
I'm sorry. Take the magic away. Sorry to crush your dream.

1634
01:22:27,680 --> 01:22:30,680
I know you were angling for that when it reopened.

1635
01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:32,680
If you want to audition on the podcast right now, go ahead.

1636
01:22:32,680 --> 01:22:35,680
I mean, Disney listens.

1637
01:22:35,680 --> 01:22:37,680
Call us chowder heads. Yeah.

1638
01:22:37,680 --> 01:22:42,680
Whatever. Probably shouldn't use some of the material he used to use, I'll be honest, in 2021.

1639
01:22:42,680 --> 01:22:43,680
Yeah. Yeah.

1640
01:22:43,680 --> 01:22:45,680
It's not aged very well.

1641
01:22:45,680 --> 01:22:48,680
The explanation that like, you know, you're all big people.

1642
01:22:48,680 --> 01:22:50,680
You know, we're all big people here tonight.

1643
01:22:50,680 --> 01:22:56,680
You know, I don't pick that doesn't fly as quite as well nowadays.

1644
01:22:56,680 --> 01:22:58,680
I think you could do some ribbing and pull that off.

1645
01:22:58,680 --> 01:23:00,680
But yeah, some of that stuff.

1646
01:23:00,680 --> 01:23:05,680
Yeah. So, well, yeah, the potato.

1647
01:23:05,680 --> 01:23:07,680
I was going to say potato head. Yeah.

1648
01:23:07,680 --> 01:23:11,680
He just I remember there's been times when he like really can target people in the in the line.

1649
01:23:11,680 --> 01:23:13,680
And then sometimes he's just singing a song.

1650
01:23:13,680 --> 01:23:16,680
Yes. Yeah.

1651
01:23:16,680 --> 01:23:19,680
If the guy wants to take a lunch break.

1652
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:22,680
I'll say this about Monsters Inc.

1653
01:23:22,680 --> 01:23:25,680
In terms of when I write it, I think Monsters Inc.

1654
01:23:25,680 --> 01:23:32,680
And Little Mermaid, I usually end up writing because there is if you spend a lot of a day at California Adventure,

1655
01:23:32,680 --> 01:23:37,680
let's assume at normal times, everything's operating.

1656
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:44,680
There is a crush in the middle of the day at that park where the rides you really want to go on have super long waits.

1657
01:23:44,680 --> 01:23:56,680
All the restaurants are packed and you're like, I got to kill time for a fast pass or I got to kill time to like let the crowds die down a little at the restaurants or stores.

1658
01:23:56,680 --> 01:23:59,680
And that is usually Monsters Inc.

1659
01:23:59,680 --> 01:24:02,680
And Little Mermaid, just because they never stop loading.

1660
01:24:03,680 --> 01:24:07,680
That is when I find myself on one of those sorts of rides.

1661
01:24:07,680 --> 01:24:11,680
So it's like an afterthought. It's not even like you want to go there.

1662
01:24:11,680 --> 01:24:14,680
You don't like it's an afterthought. You hate the ride, Jason.

1663
01:24:14,680 --> 01:24:20,680
Well, OK, I'm not going that that I think I will admit it's my it's an afterthought for me.

1664
01:24:20,680 --> 01:24:24,680
And I'm saying it's not fair. It's fair that that's what happens.

1665
01:24:24,680 --> 01:24:28,680
I do think it's helping the Guardians now is something I love and go to.

1666
01:24:28,680 --> 01:24:32,680
So I'm more forced on the way in the flow of traffic.

1667
01:24:32,680 --> 01:24:35,680
Do you like the Guardians ride more than Tower of Terror?

1668
01:24:35,680 --> 01:24:37,680
The one that was there for sure the one that was there.

1669
01:24:37,680 --> 01:24:47,680
I like more. And I also I also though find now Tower of Terror in Florida a little lacking because of the drop sequences and as fun as the one.

1670
01:24:47,680 --> 01:24:52,680
But for sure, I like it better than what was there before the very because it's a it's a little better in Florida.

1671
01:24:52,680 --> 01:24:56,680
There's more theming and the one in Florida to the Tower of Terror.

1672
01:24:56,680 --> 01:25:00,680
But so I am going that way more often now, which leads me on there.

1673
01:25:00,680 --> 01:25:04,680
But I'm mad. But you don't go. You don't go for the monsters, right?

1674
01:25:04,680 --> 01:25:08,680
You go for Guardians of the Galaxy and then you make the stop.

1675
01:25:08,680 --> 01:25:10,680
Yes. And I don't I'm sorry to the right.

1676
01:25:10,680 --> 01:25:12,680
It's not fair because I said I go on it.

1677
01:25:12,680 --> 01:25:23,680
It's almost like because of where it's located, all it's all the good feelings I just had disappear so quickly because I'm in a really barren weird place again.

1678
01:25:23,680 --> 01:25:27,680
So it almost feels like a dream. It's like you're right.

1679
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:30,680
And also you're right in terms of like tone as well.

1680
01:25:30,680 --> 01:25:35,680
Like you go to Guardians of the Galaxy, that area feels like very like adult to me.

1681
01:25:35,680 --> 01:25:45,680
Like it's not a place that like it doesn't have the whimsy or magic that I think like months that right should belong that that right belongs in Disneyland.

1682
01:25:45,680 --> 01:25:49,680
Number one and number two and like a more youthful area of the park.

1683
01:25:49,680 --> 01:26:04,680
Yeah, it's also I feel like maybe if they did like if they just built a really sort of I'm trying to think like an office like an office building that's a little stylized or something, something that like looks like a thing.

1684
01:26:04,680 --> 01:26:06,680
And that is, you know what?

1685
01:26:06,680 --> 01:26:10,680
It's you know, the thing is here's here's let's be quite honest.

1686
01:26:10,680 --> 01:26:14,680
This is an afterthought even for the people working at the parks.

1687
01:26:14,680 --> 01:26:17,680
Literally, it's an afterthought. It's not you know what I mean?

1688
01:26:17,680 --> 01:26:21,680
They didn't not mean to make monsters in the right.

1689
01:26:21,680 --> 01:26:25,680
And it shows it shows it shows in the park.

1690
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:28,680
Yeah, it's like it's and that's and that's a shame.

1691
01:26:28,680 --> 01:26:34,680
It should be like the Dunder Mifflin office or something like they should give it.

1692
01:26:34,680 --> 01:26:39,680
I mean, look, the actual it's the most popular show of all time.

1693
01:26:39,680 --> 01:26:40,680
I get you may as well.

1694
01:26:40,680 --> 01:26:42,680
I know they don't own it, but give it an homage.

1695
01:26:42,680 --> 01:26:50,680
Maybe like there should be a little something there to sort of to sort of make me go, oh, I need to like the Haunted Mansion or whatever.

1696
01:26:50,680 --> 01:26:53,680
You see it and you go, oh, you get that good feeling from the Haunted Mansion.

1697
01:26:53,680 --> 01:26:54,680
I walk by Monsters Inc.

1698
01:26:54,680 --> 01:27:00,680
And I go, there's some paint is a flat piece of cardboard with the colors on the outside Monsters Inc.

1699
01:27:00,680 --> 01:27:05,680
Well, do you want it to look like the like where they work at like the factory?

1700
01:27:05,680 --> 01:27:06,680
Is that good?

1701
01:27:06,680 --> 01:27:09,680
I mean, probably better that than the Dunder Mifflin office.

1702
01:27:09,680 --> 01:27:10,680
I would know what.

1703
01:27:10,680 --> 01:27:12,680
No, I think it should be the actual Dunder Mifflin.

1704
01:27:14,680 --> 01:27:15,680
I think that's what.

1705
01:27:15,680 --> 01:27:18,680
All right, Scott, it's got to be something from the movie.

1706
01:27:18,680 --> 01:27:22,680
Whatever something that makes logical sense.

1707
01:27:22,680 --> 01:27:23,680
What a stickler.

1708
01:27:23,680 --> 01:27:25,680
Even for the container part of the part.

1709
01:27:25,680 --> 01:27:26,680
All right.

1710
01:27:26,680 --> 01:27:29,680
No, you're right.

1711
01:27:29,680 --> 01:27:30,680
Like, because they isn't it?

1712
01:27:30,680 --> 01:27:38,680
There is a better exterior in Tokyo in the Tokyo ride, which is a different ride called Ride and Seek.

1713
01:27:38,680 --> 01:27:51,680
And it is left over from the exterior that was there, but it lent itself more to that industrial, the grand building and the the the atrium that you walk into when you get into the ride.

1714
01:27:51,680 --> 01:27:58,680
You get in the line is like, you know, like the the monsters are very proud of where they work.

1715
01:27:58,680 --> 01:28:00,680
That's the thing you really feel in the movie.

1716
01:28:00,680 --> 01:28:05,680
They like they're so proud to be scarrers or makes a scare assistant or whatever.

1717
01:28:05,680 --> 01:28:09,680
The you know, they love this how these hallowed halls.

1718
01:28:09,680 --> 01:28:18,680
And yet I think you feel that when you go into the Tokyo one this year, you're in these narrow corridors and then the building itself still is sound stagey.

1719
01:28:18,680 --> 01:28:22,680
You want to feel Sully's pride when you walk into the thing.

1720
01:28:22,680 --> 01:28:25,680
It might help Sully's.

1721
01:28:25,680 --> 01:28:27,680
Well, he landed on the.

1722
01:28:27,680 --> 01:28:31,680
Yes, and everyone was that he made Sully made a miracle happen.

1723
01:28:31,680 --> 01:28:41,680
And do you still get on a cab in the Tokyo Disneyland ride with that vehicle is supposed to be this whole other.

1724
01:28:41,680 --> 01:28:42,680
Oh, but it is. Yeah.

1725
01:28:42,680 --> 01:28:47,680
And it's this premise where it is as opposed to this ride, which is kind of during the events of the movie.

1726
01:28:47,680 --> 01:28:53,680
This is post the movie where it is not screams the power of the city anymore.

1727
01:28:53,680 --> 01:29:00,680
It is laughs. So there is a fun game that is done now that is a hide and seek game with a flashlight.

1728
01:29:00,680 --> 01:29:02,680
So every so you get a flashlight.

1729
01:29:02,680 --> 01:29:07,680
It's basically like a Buzz Lightyear laser tag ride, but you point a flashlight instead of a gun.

1730
01:29:07,680 --> 01:29:09,680
So it's like a more family friendly.

1731
01:29:09,680 --> 01:29:16,680
But then boo gets loose again and you got to find boo and Randall still gets come up and he gets crushed into a cube in this really amazing.

1732
01:29:16,680 --> 01:29:19,680
Sequence. It is. It's extremely cool.

1733
01:29:19,680 --> 01:29:23,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's it's interesting.

1734
01:29:23,680 --> 01:29:29,680
So I'm trying to I'll stop talking about the exterior because the ride itself is good, but it is funny.

1735
01:29:29,680 --> 01:29:35,680
Like thinking about like pirates in Florida doesn't have the queue that California does.

1736
01:29:35,680 --> 01:29:39,680
California has obviously that buildings exterior and it's a lot better.

1737
01:29:39,680 --> 01:29:45,680
The one in Florida doesn't even have like the you know how like there's the restaurant blue by your restaurant doesn't have that intro part to the ride.

1738
01:29:45,680 --> 01:29:49,680
It feels like the best rides like really easy in and out.

1739
01:29:49,680 --> 01:29:53,680
But also when you see the building of it, also it's like enticing you.

1740
01:29:53,680 --> 01:29:58,680
It's like the best rides have all of that in it.

1741
01:29:58,680 --> 01:30:04,680
Yeah, but also, I mean, we have to think think about the fact that the Monsters Inc.

1742
01:30:04,680 --> 01:30:07,680
Ride is a substitute ride.

1743
01:30:07,680 --> 01:30:14,680
You know, it replaced a as much as I love it, a shitty ride superstar limo tours.

1744
01:30:14,680 --> 01:30:21,680
It's it's just like it was never meant to be the star despite the name having superstar in the title.

1745
01:30:21,680 --> 01:30:25,680
This was an afterthought. This was like honestly a ride filler.

1746
01:30:25,680 --> 01:30:30,680
Let's be real. It was plugging a hole in a rowboat like that's exactly it.

1747
01:30:30,680 --> 01:30:34,680
The expectations are different when they start from a blank expansion pack.

1748
01:30:34,680 --> 01:30:38,680
Oh, yeah. Build fresh as opposed to like, yeah, reskinning.

1749
01:30:38,680 --> 01:30:41,680
We've got to get something in here. People say there's not enough characters in this park.

1750
01:30:41,680 --> 01:30:45,680
People say there's not enough family dark ride kind of things in this park.

1751
01:30:45,680 --> 01:30:51,680
So it kind of was a necessity being the mother of invention.

1752
01:30:51,680 --> 01:30:56,680
I need to cut it. Exactly. Yes. I need to be well, I need to be nicer.

1753
01:30:56,680 --> 01:31:00,680
Yeah, be yeah, be nicer. There's always room for improvement.

1754
01:31:00,680 --> 01:31:07,680
I mean, you know, here we've been trying to do our thing and get plus it up, keep it as is or burn it down for insurance money.

1755
01:31:08,680 --> 01:31:13,680
I think there are some options here and I'm not sure like in Mike's case, Mike is your version of this.

1756
01:31:13,680 --> 01:31:15,680
Make it a grander experience.

1757
01:31:15,680 --> 01:31:19,680
Fill in some of those things they couldn't do in the rush job of 2005.

1758
01:31:19,680 --> 01:31:29,680
And so Dunder Mifflin exterior like Scott character actor outside voice like actor inside talking like like.

1759
01:31:29,680 --> 01:31:33,680
There's a Michael Scott big head. Big, big.

1760
01:31:33,680 --> 01:31:36,680
That's good. Yeah. And then I mean, you could put as many as you want.

1761
01:31:36,680 --> 01:31:40,680
Dwight, we could have Dwight out there. So that would be my plus up.

1762
01:31:40,680 --> 01:31:44,680
Let's just get these office characters. But then it's the monsters in.

1763
01:31:44,680 --> 01:31:48,680
It's a monster sink. But people want to see the office characters.

1764
01:31:48,680 --> 01:31:54,680
I think this is perfect. Rendered like superstar limo looking like scary miniature dummies.

1765
01:31:54,680 --> 01:31:59,680
That'd be good. They're still under there. Turn Cindy Crawford into Pam.

1766
01:31:59,680 --> 01:32:05,680
All right. Yeah. And Melanie Griffith is Angela.

1767
01:32:05,680 --> 01:32:11,680
That's right. I think this makes Jackie Chan is Oscar. Yeah.

1768
01:32:11,680 --> 01:32:14,680
It makes sense. Your carries. Dwight, I guess. Yeah.

1769
01:32:14,680 --> 01:32:19,680
There's an equivalent. But Regis Philbin stays. Yes, yes. In honor.

1770
01:32:19,680 --> 01:32:23,680
All right. Does anybody else have strong feelings about what could happen?

1771
01:32:24,680 --> 01:32:27,680
I think I feel like I'm not in dire need to.

1772
01:32:27,680 --> 01:32:30,680
I think you got to plus up everything around the ride.

1773
01:32:30,680 --> 01:32:33,680
Just take that awful flat out of there.

1774
01:32:33,680 --> 01:32:41,680
But I think if with the right new ride, I wouldn't miss this.

1775
01:32:41,680 --> 01:32:47,680
Jason, what you said last time about Joe Rody's quote about like these things are like Broadway shows.

1776
01:32:47,680 --> 01:32:50,680
You get a run and that's a good run and then something else has to come in.

1777
01:32:50,680 --> 01:32:57,680
I think for the right replacement, I think I could say, hey, Monsters Inc was great, but let's do the next thing.

1778
01:32:57,680 --> 01:33:01,680
But it would have to be it have to be good. Can't be an afterthought.

1779
01:33:01,680 --> 01:33:06,680
And I will not keep it a limo if possible.

1780
01:33:06,680 --> 01:33:15,680
Yeah, I will see. Yeah, I feel like sadly I'm not going to be so upset if they get rid of it, but it's not fair.

1781
01:33:15,680 --> 01:33:20,680
I mean, it would be nice if they could move it and make it like a little grander somewhere else.

1782
01:33:20,680 --> 01:33:24,680
Like, I don't know. I mean, they do sometimes move stuff like this, but they probably won't.

1783
01:33:24,680 --> 01:33:31,680
But it would be fun if they like really massively built out Toontown or something and put this I guess this doesn't really make sense in Toontown.

1784
01:33:31,680 --> 01:33:34,680
But does it really make sense in Hollywood?

1785
01:33:34,680 --> 01:33:37,680
Certainly not. Yeah, where would it make sense? It doesn't really make sense.

1786
01:33:37,680 --> 01:33:42,680
Yeah, because it's like there's like California Venture is Pixar area.

1787
01:33:42,680 --> 01:33:53,680
Like I think they've supposedly I don't think they've said it said it unofficially, but like California Venture supposedly is Pixar, Marvel and Disneyland is Star Wars and then classic Disney.

1788
01:33:53,680 --> 01:33:57,680
Apparently they have some also in Disneyland.

1789
01:33:57,680 --> 01:34:02,680
But there's also a ton of Pixar because they didn't make that rule before. Yeah. Yeah.

1790
01:34:02,680 --> 01:34:04,680
It's from now on. Right. Yeah. So it's a hot mess.

1791
01:34:04,680 --> 01:34:09,680
Going forward, supposedly that's what it is until it changes tomorrow.

1792
01:34:10,680 --> 01:34:11,680
Jason or Oscar?

1793
01:34:11,680 --> 01:34:22,680
Oh, my God. Yeah, I was just going to say like if they fully build out like Marvel Comics in New York in this area, I will be in heaven if they do it right.

1794
01:34:22,680 --> 01:34:26,680
Like they're they're opening Avengers campus and I'm excited to go to it.

1795
01:34:26,680 --> 01:34:30,680
But it's like it looks like a college campus with a jet on the roof.

1796
01:34:31,680 --> 01:34:39,680
So I don't know, that's not quite that's not quite the excitement I had is reading the comics as a kid was like, oh, I want to go to college.

1797
01:34:39,680 --> 01:34:41,680
Like, and that's not even the X-Men's man.

1798
01:34:41,680 --> 01:34:45,680
The X-Men's mansion was like, I know the X-Men are in there.

1799
01:34:45,680 --> 01:34:50,680
It's like, oh, there's a building like learn from Hulk.

1800
01:34:50,680 --> 01:34:52,680
He'll teach me. Yeah, that feels weird.

1801
01:34:52,680 --> 01:34:55,680
Also, it's not canon and it's like, OK, I don't know.

1802
01:34:55,680 --> 01:35:00,680
I I could do without I like Spider-Man.

1803
01:35:00,680 --> 01:35:02,680
I like Spider-Man being in the Avengers.

1804
01:35:02,680 --> 01:35:04,680
Like I like him being worked into the universe.

1805
01:35:04,680 --> 01:35:08,680
But like the stuff that's coming with the ride, I'm sure I will enjoy the ride.

1806
01:35:08,680 --> 01:35:13,680
But like all this stuff about like, hey, stem, honk, it's don't you like step?

1807
01:35:13,680 --> 01:35:14,680
It's like, I don't know.

1808
01:35:14,680 --> 01:35:17,680
Can't kids do you got to do?

1809
01:35:17,680 --> 01:35:19,680
I don't push this.

1810
01:35:19,680 --> 01:35:22,680
Listen, if they're committing to a university put monsters university.

1811
01:35:22,680 --> 01:35:23,680
Hey, there we go.

1812
01:35:23,680 --> 01:35:26,680
And presumably there's some liberal arts at that Monsters University,

1813
01:35:26,680 --> 01:35:29,680
because, you know, we got to have liberal arts graduates.

1814
01:35:29,680 --> 01:35:31,680
We can't just have engineers and stuff.

1815
01:35:31,680 --> 01:35:34,680
Otherwise, you end up with all these Silicon Valley psychos.

1816
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:40,680
And also, like in the in the case of like of what you were saying, Scott,

1817
01:35:40,680 --> 01:35:43,680
about keeping Monsters Inc. right, it's like, I don't mind it.

1818
01:35:43,680 --> 01:35:46,680
I don't mind them getting rid of it.

1819
01:35:46,680 --> 01:35:49,680
But if we get rid of it, as far as I know, that's the only Monsters

1820
01:35:49,680 --> 01:35:52,680
Inc. representation we see at the park.

1821
01:35:52,680 --> 01:35:54,680
And that's unfair.

1822
01:35:54,680 --> 01:35:55,680
That's unfair.

1823
01:35:55,680 --> 01:35:56,680
We got to have Monsters Inc.

1824
01:35:56,680 --> 01:35:57,680
somewhere in the park.

1825
01:35:57,680 --> 01:36:00,680
So we either like tear it down and rebuild another Monsters Inc.

1826
01:36:00,680 --> 01:36:02,680
thing or move Monsters Inc.

1827
01:36:02,680 --> 01:36:03,680
somewhere else in the park.

1828
01:36:03,680 --> 01:36:05,680
Well, there is one frozen treat.

1829
01:36:05,680 --> 01:36:07,680
The frozen treat stand in Pixar Pier.

1830
01:36:07,680 --> 01:36:09,680
Get out of here, Jason.

1831
01:36:09,680 --> 01:36:10,680
Get the fuck out of here.

1832
01:36:10,680 --> 01:36:12,680
No, that's not what I mean.

1833
01:36:12,680 --> 01:36:13,680
I know that's not what you mean.

1834
01:36:13,680 --> 01:36:17,680
But I do like that if you go by that door screen at the right time.

1835
01:36:18,680 --> 01:36:20,680
And I think this is a good use of screens.

1836
01:36:20,680 --> 01:36:21,680
Oh, yeah.

1837
01:36:21,680 --> 01:36:22,680
The doors to different places.

1838
01:36:22,680 --> 01:36:27,680
The Yeti offers you like a lemon ice, which you can then go by on Pixar Pier.

1839
01:36:27,680 --> 01:36:29,680
That's nice.

1840
01:36:29,680 --> 01:36:32,680
Why can't there be little doors like that, like just scattered throughout the park?

1841
01:36:32,680 --> 01:36:33,680
That's nice.

1842
01:36:33,680 --> 01:36:34,680
Yeah, that would be great.

1843
01:36:34,680 --> 01:36:35,680
You never know when someone will say hi.

1844
01:36:35,680 --> 01:36:37,680
Like doors that don't lead to anywhere.

1845
01:36:37,680 --> 01:36:41,680
They could be like storage spaces, but just like make a door on the outside

1846
01:36:41,680 --> 01:36:42,680
and it could lead.

1847
01:36:42,680 --> 01:36:47,680
Have those little interactive moments with like the Yeti or Cecilia, et cetera, et cetera.

1848
01:36:47,680 --> 01:36:49,680
I would be satisfied with that.

1849
01:36:49,680 --> 01:36:50,680
Where the front of the building.

1850
01:36:50,680 --> 01:36:52,680
You cover the front of the building and different doors at OE.

1851
01:36:52,680 --> 01:36:55,680
And then you can stand there and watch a little show between all the doors.

1852
01:36:55,680 --> 01:36:56,680
That's fantastic.

1853
01:36:56,680 --> 01:36:58,680
Like an updated Laugh-In.

1854
01:36:58,680 --> 01:36:59,680
That's fantastic.

1855
01:36:59,680 --> 01:37:00,680
Oh, yeah.

1856
01:37:00,680 --> 01:37:01,680
Yes.

1857
01:37:01,680 --> 01:37:03,680
Monster Laugh-In is pretty good.

1858
01:37:03,680 --> 01:37:04,680
That's a good show.

1859
01:37:04,680 --> 01:37:07,680
Billion dollar ideas left and right on this episode.

1860
01:37:07,680 --> 01:37:11,680
Could they turn the Hall of Presidents into Laugh-In maybe?

1861
01:37:11,680 --> 01:37:16,680
Maybe like with doors and like that, at least like you can get the like you won't be like

1862
01:37:16,680 --> 01:37:20,680
a serious political thing anymore where people boo the president.

1863
01:37:20,680 --> 01:37:24,680
It'll just be like Nixon and everybody opening up a door and saying socket to me.

1864
01:37:24,680 --> 01:37:26,680
Are people really booing presidents at the Hall of Presidents?

1865
01:37:26,680 --> 01:37:27,680
Well, I'm sure they do.

1866
01:37:27,680 --> 01:37:29,680
The last couple presidents certainly.

1867
01:37:32,680 --> 01:37:34,680
No one's booing Zachary Taylor.

1868
01:37:34,680 --> 01:37:36,680
I don't think so.

1869
01:37:36,680 --> 01:37:37,680
Interesting.

1870
01:37:37,680 --> 01:37:39,680
Not for a few decades.

1871
01:37:39,680 --> 01:37:47,680
It'd be great to see a Lincoln with like the Daniel Day Lewis like socket socket to me.

1872
01:37:47,680 --> 01:37:48,680
I don't know his voice.

1873
01:37:48,680 --> 01:37:49,680
No, no, no.

1874
01:37:49,680 --> 01:37:51,680
We're on the world stage now.

1875
01:37:51,680 --> 01:37:54,680
No, no, no.

1876
01:37:54,680 --> 01:38:00,680
He did because they say Lincoln they think had a much higher register that he was portrayed

1877
01:38:00,680 --> 01:38:02,680
in like old fifties and sixties movies.

1878
01:38:02,680 --> 01:38:07,680
And so like, yeah, Daniel Day Lewis doing a very interesting voice in that movie.

1879
01:38:07,680 --> 01:38:08,680
Interesting.

1880
01:38:08,680 --> 01:38:10,680
But he's so tall.

1881
01:38:10,680 --> 01:38:11,680
That is weird.

1882
01:38:11,680 --> 01:38:12,680
Yeah.

1883
01:38:12,680 --> 01:38:13,680
Deep voices.

1884
01:38:13,680 --> 01:38:14,680
Yes.

1885
01:38:14,680 --> 01:38:22,680
They have a they have a plot of land, I think, back in Pixar Pier that could be developed on.

1886
01:38:22,680 --> 01:38:23,680
Yeah.

1887
01:38:23,680 --> 01:38:25,680
So that's where door laughing should have it in the rights.

1888
01:38:25,680 --> 01:38:26,680
Yeah.

1889
01:38:26,680 --> 01:38:29,680
Or laughing, cooking and will be sad.

1890
01:38:29,680 --> 01:38:33,680
And then the ride can then it'll become a literal afterthought.

1891
01:38:33,680 --> 01:38:34,680
I guess.

1892
01:38:34,680 --> 01:38:35,680
Yeah.

1893
01:38:35,680 --> 01:38:36,680
That's sad.

1894
01:38:36,680 --> 01:38:41,680
I'm trying to provoke Oscar with these divisive words, I think.

1895
01:38:41,680 --> 01:38:44,680
I mean, you're not the yes, I'm mad about it.

1896
01:38:44,680 --> 01:38:46,680
But listen, I can't be mad at the truth.

1897
01:38:46,680 --> 01:38:47,680
And that is the truth.

1898
01:38:47,680 --> 01:38:52,680
It's it's an afterthought ride pains me to say, but it is.

1899
01:38:52,680 --> 01:38:56,680
And I think as far as an afterthought ride, it's pretty dang good.

1900
01:38:56,680 --> 01:38:57,680
It's great.

1901
01:38:57,680 --> 01:38:58,680
It's true.

1902
01:38:58,680 --> 01:39:00,680
And it's great for what it is, what type of ride it is.

1903
01:39:00,680 --> 01:39:03,680
And I like it better than Little Mermaid.

1904
01:39:03,680 --> 01:39:04,680
Yeah.

1905
01:39:05,680 --> 01:39:06,680
100 percent.

1906
01:39:06,680 --> 01:39:08,680
And that was not an afterthought ride.

1907
01:39:08,680 --> 01:39:10,680
That was like a ride they wanted to make.

1908
01:39:10,680 --> 01:39:11,680
Huh?

1909
01:39:11,680 --> 01:39:13,680
So you might be disappointed.

1910
01:39:13,680 --> 01:39:17,680
I think we should we could bolster Monsters Inc.

1911
01:39:17,680 --> 01:39:21,680
Like the fan response, I think we should like the next thing they put on

1912
01:39:21,680 --> 01:39:27,680
like a meme kind of T-shirt is the guy with the photos of boo.

1913
01:39:27,680 --> 01:39:33,680
His line is I mean, part of the fun of those, you know, the yellow seat

1914
01:39:33,680 --> 01:39:36,680
decontamination guys is they you can have them say anything.

1915
01:39:36,680 --> 01:39:43,680
And his delivery when you go by him, he says, I have information on the girl.

1916
01:39:43,680 --> 01:39:47,680
Like he says the weirdest he says it the strangest way.

1917
01:39:47,680 --> 01:39:51,680
So if Disney I think will make big bucks if you start selling, I have

1918
01:39:51,680 --> 01:39:55,680
information dot dot dot on the girl on a T-shirt.

1919
01:39:57,680 --> 01:39:59,680
I catch that.

1920
01:39:59,680 --> 01:40:00,680
All right.

1921
01:40:00,680 --> 01:40:01,680
I love that.

1922
01:40:01,680 --> 01:40:03,680
Put it out there, Jason.

1923
01:40:03,680 --> 01:40:04,680
Yeah.

1924
01:40:04,680 --> 01:40:05,680
Yeah.

1925
01:40:05,680 --> 01:40:06,680
So hopefully they do it.

1926
01:40:06,680 --> 01:40:07,680
Yeah.

1927
01:40:07,680 --> 01:40:08,680
Yeah.

1928
01:40:08,680 --> 01:40:09,680
All right.

1929
01:40:09,680 --> 01:40:10,680
I think I'm just going to make the T-shirt.

1930
01:40:10,680 --> 01:40:11,680
Yeah, we might actually.

1931
01:40:11,680 --> 01:40:12,680
Yeah, we have a T-public.

1932
01:40:12,680 --> 01:40:13,680
Yeah, we should just go.

1933
01:40:13,680 --> 01:40:15,680
Now it's a race to the make it a race to the finish.

1934
01:40:15,680 --> 01:40:19,680
Whichever one of us does it first cashes in first.

1935
01:40:19,680 --> 01:40:23,680
So we're all going to make a dash to a T-public for now.

1936
01:40:23,680 --> 01:40:26,680
Oscar Montoya, you survived podcast the ride.

1937
01:40:26,680 --> 01:40:27,680
What a blast.

1938
01:40:27,680 --> 01:40:28,680
Thank you so much.

1939
01:40:28,680 --> 01:40:29,680
This was really fun.

1940
01:40:29,680 --> 01:40:30,680
This is so fun.

1941
01:40:30,680 --> 01:40:31,680
Thank you so much.

1942
01:40:31,680 --> 01:40:32,680
Let's exit through the gift shop.

1943
01:40:32,680 --> 01:40:36,680
Is there anything you would like to plug?

1944
01:40:36,680 --> 01:40:42,680
You can follow me on Instagram and Twitter at Ozzy Mo Ozzy ZYMO.

1945
01:40:42,680 --> 01:40:48,040
I also have a bunch of podcasts, one of them being a music video podcast called Podcast

1946
01:40:48,040 --> 01:40:51,680
Kill the Video Star, where we will we are on a quest.

1947
01:40:51,680 --> 01:40:56,680
Me and Mano Gappi are on a quest to find the top 100 definitive best music videos of all

1948
01:40:56,680 --> 01:41:01,680
time and then the listeners get to vote for which one makes it to the countdown.

1949
01:41:01,680 --> 01:41:06,680
I have Spanish I keep presented to the Latin X comedy podcast.

1950
01:41:06,680 --> 01:41:11,680
Listen to that wherever you listen to podcasts inside the Disney vault where I and Rachel

1951
01:41:11,680 --> 01:41:16,680
Chapman and Claire Logren watch every single Disney animated movie in chronological order.

1952
01:41:16,680 --> 01:41:17,680
We did that.

1953
01:41:17,680 --> 01:41:18,680
We watched every Pixar movie.

1954
01:41:18,680 --> 01:41:19,680
We did that.

1955
01:41:19,680 --> 01:41:24,680
Now we're watching every D com in chronological order and that is a charade.

1956
01:41:24,680 --> 01:41:25,680
Wait, every one.

1957
01:41:25,680 --> 01:41:26,680
That's fun.

1958
01:41:27,680 --> 01:41:29,680
Every single D com Disney channel.

1959
01:41:29,680 --> 01:41:30,680
I didn't know that acronym.

1960
01:41:30,680 --> 01:41:31,680
Oh my God.

1961
01:41:31,680 --> 01:41:32,680
Wow.

1962
01:41:32,680 --> 01:41:33,680
Yeah.

1963
01:41:33,680 --> 01:41:34,680
They're all on Disney Plus.

1964
01:41:34,680 --> 01:41:35,680
This is a pretty like deep archive there.

1965
01:41:35,680 --> 01:41:36,680
They're all on Disney Plus.

1966
01:41:36,680 --> 01:41:37,680
Yeah.

1967
01:41:37,680 --> 01:41:41,680
So it's a fun little actually after Disney Plus we had a nice little boost because people

1968
01:41:41,680 --> 01:41:43,680
now could like watch them.

1969
01:41:43,680 --> 01:41:46,680
Watch along and like, you know, but yeah.

1970
01:41:46,680 --> 01:41:52,680
And other than that, you can watch me on a Fox show called Bless the Hearts is an animated

1971
01:41:52,680 --> 01:41:57,680
show every Sunday at 830 on Fox or wherever you watch that show.

1972
01:41:57,680 --> 01:41:58,680
Yeah.

1973
01:41:58,680 --> 01:42:00,680
And you did didn't like Fuzzbucket.

1974
01:42:02,680 --> 01:42:03,680
I love us.

1975
01:42:03,680 --> 01:42:06,680
You didn't like funny words in my mouth.

1976
01:42:06,680 --> 01:42:07,680
Yeah, that's true.

1977
01:42:07,680 --> 01:42:08,680
OK, I apologize.

1978
01:42:08,680 --> 01:42:13,680
You know, since we're going back to that conversation, I have a little addendum that appeared during

1979
01:42:13,680 --> 01:42:14,680
this recording.

1980
01:42:14,680 --> 01:42:18,680
This is about like about an hour ago.

1981
01:42:18,680 --> 01:42:22,680
I was trying to close out of some windows so that the Internet would be a little better.

1982
01:42:22,680 --> 01:42:28,680
And I clicked on my email and I had a new email that was updating me about an eBay order.

1983
01:42:28,680 --> 01:42:29,680
Let me explain.

1984
01:42:29,680 --> 01:42:32,680
I looked up the date on November 29th.

1985
01:42:32,680 --> 01:42:38,680
I purchased on eBay something for Mike Carlson for Christmas.

1986
01:42:38,680 --> 01:42:42,680
It gave me an estimated delivery date of December 18th.

1987
01:42:42,680 --> 01:42:44,680
December 18th rolled around.

1988
01:42:44,680 --> 01:42:46,680
No sign of anything.

1989
01:42:46,680 --> 01:42:51,680
I checked the listing and it was like, all right, so label printed and then nothing else

1990
01:42:51,680 --> 01:42:52,680
had occurred.

1991
01:42:52,680 --> 01:42:55,680
I'm like, OK, well, this thing isn't coming.

1992
01:42:55,680 --> 01:43:00,680
I use some taramana tequila to fill the Christmas order.

1993
01:43:00,680 --> 01:43:02,680
I mean, that's that's something in its own right.

1994
01:43:02,680 --> 01:43:05,680
But I was trying to do this thing.

1995
01:43:05,680 --> 01:43:11,680
And then somehow during this recording, I got an update about this.

1996
01:43:11,680 --> 01:43:14,680
And we're recording this on January 19th.

1997
01:43:14,680 --> 01:43:16,680
So this was supposed to come December 18th.

1998
01:43:16,680 --> 01:43:17,680
It is now January 19th.

1999
01:43:17,680 --> 01:43:22,680
And I get this email from an eBay seller.

2000
01:43:22,680 --> 01:43:27,680
I'm contacting you because as of the last month and a half, there's been a major backup and delay with USPS.

2001
01:43:27,680 --> 01:43:29,680
Packages have not scanned or delivered.

2002
01:43:29,680 --> 01:43:32,680
Please let me know if you've received this item.

2003
01:43:32,680 --> 01:43:34,680
If not, I'm sorry for wasting your time.

2004
01:43:34,680 --> 01:43:36,680
And I hope you understand the bother.

2005
01:43:36,680 --> 01:43:40,680
If you have not, please let me know so I can get the ball rolling and put a trace on this package.

2006
01:43:40,680 --> 01:43:43,680
Suddenly there is imperative.

2007
01:43:43,680 --> 01:43:47,680
Somebody really has the fire to get this thing out to me a month later.

2008
01:43:47,680 --> 01:43:49,680
What is this item?

2009
01:43:49,680 --> 01:43:51,680
You may ask.

2010
01:43:51,680 --> 01:43:53,680
The item is a baby.

2011
01:43:53,680 --> 01:43:55,680
I don't know.

2012
01:43:55,680 --> 01:43:56,680
Action.

2013
01:43:56,680 --> 01:44:00,680
No, what is what am I looking at?

2014
01:44:00,680 --> 01:44:03,680
Well, it's not what you're looking at.

2015
01:44:03,680 --> 01:44:08,680
The question really is, is this cute?

2016
01:44:08,680 --> 01:44:10,680
That doesn't quite look like the movie.

2017
01:44:10,680 --> 01:44:11,680
I wouldn't.

2018
01:44:11,680 --> 01:44:17,680
Let me see if I can get a bigger vintage Disney baby Aladar sound walking dino alive.

2019
01:44:17,680 --> 01:44:20,680
Aladar toy figure works.

2020
01:44:20,680 --> 01:44:22,680
And I don't know if I can see it any better than that.

2021
01:44:22,680 --> 01:44:24,680
It's a pretty small photo.

2022
01:44:24,680 --> 01:44:27,680
There we go.

2023
01:44:27,680 --> 01:44:28,680
Oh, my.

2024
01:44:28,680 --> 01:44:30,680
They have the merch.

2025
01:44:30,680 --> 01:44:31,680
There were baby.

2026
01:44:31,680 --> 01:44:32,680
Did you know this, Mike?

2027
01:44:32,680 --> 01:44:33,680
Did you ever checked in on this?

2028
01:44:33,680 --> 01:44:35,680
I think we looked on the episode a little bit.

2029
01:44:35,680 --> 01:44:37,680
I didn't see this one, though.

2030
01:44:37,680 --> 01:44:40,680
This might have been like part of another toy.

2031
01:44:40,680 --> 01:44:43,680
Like there might be like a bigger like mechanism that's supposed to be with it.

2032
01:44:43,680 --> 01:44:45,680
They broke this off.

2033
01:44:45,680 --> 01:44:46,680
But what would it be?

2034
01:44:46,680 --> 01:44:47,680
What could it be?

2035
01:44:47,680 --> 01:44:48,680
Possibly?

2036
01:44:48,680 --> 01:44:53,680
Oh, a adorable little turn.

2037
01:44:53,680 --> 01:44:56,680
No, think about it.

2038
01:44:56,680 --> 01:45:06,680
Imagine you're going to have to rig the turn yourself and imagine for yourself that you could make it out of Play-Doh, make it out of a little piece of chocolate.

2039
01:45:06,680 --> 01:45:07,680
Yeah.

2040
01:45:07,680 --> 01:45:08,680
Oh, fudgey.

2041
01:45:08,680 --> 01:45:17,680
I believe a listener emailed us that they had this toy and their family tried to get rid.

2042
01:45:17,680 --> 01:45:24,680
And it was like a haunted toy like for years, like with just the batteries never quite died.

2043
01:45:24,680 --> 01:45:29,680
So every now and then it would just make a horrific like sound.

2044
01:45:29,680 --> 01:45:33,680
And then every time they tried to get rid of it, it would end up back.

2045
01:45:33,680 --> 01:45:37,680
I have to go back and look through our emails.

2046
01:45:37,680 --> 01:45:38,680
Am I getting a cursed toy?

2047
01:45:38,680 --> 01:45:39,680
I think so.

2048
01:45:39,680 --> 01:45:41,680
So maybe you are getting it.

2049
01:45:41,680 --> 01:45:43,680
Maybe you are finally getting it.

2050
01:45:43,680 --> 01:45:44,680
That's why it couldn't get rid.

2051
01:45:44,680 --> 01:45:45,680
It disappeared.

2052
01:45:45,680 --> 01:45:52,680
But then we bring up Baby Aladar for the first time in months and suddenly it appears again.

2053
01:45:52,680 --> 01:45:54,680
They're absolutely a ghost thing.

2054
01:45:54,680 --> 01:45:55,680
You know what you did?

2055
01:45:55,680 --> 01:45:57,680
You secreted this shit right here.

2056
01:45:57,680 --> 01:45:58,680
I manifested it.

2057
01:45:58,680 --> 01:45:59,680
You manifested it.

2058
01:45:59,680 --> 01:46:01,680
It's going to end up in Scott's house.

2059
01:46:01,680 --> 01:46:03,680
I mean, it'll have to wait.

2060
01:46:03,680 --> 01:46:07,680
It's going to come to me to where I live, but maybe I won't bring it inside.

2061
01:46:07,680 --> 01:46:09,680
I think I have to leave it.

2062
01:46:09,680 --> 01:46:13,680
If it never actually enters my home, I think I'll feel more comfortable.

2063
01:46:13,680 --> 01:46:14,680
I'll leave it on the porch.

2064
01:46:14,680 --> 01:46:17,680
I'll let you know you can come get it on your own time.

2065
01:46:17,680 --> 01:46:18,680
What if yours?

2066
01:46:18,680 --> 01:46:21,680
I think your child has a new best friend.

2067
01:46:21,680 --> 01:46:22,680
Never.

2068
01:46:22,680 --> 01:46:23,680
No, I think no.

2069
01:46:23,680 --> 01:46:27,680
I think what's going to happen is you're going to pick up the package and you're going to open it up.

2070
01:46:27,680 --> 01:46:30,680
And then your son is going to go, brother.

2071
01:46:30,680 --> 01:46:33,680
No, my God.

2072
01:46:33,680 --> 01:46:36,680
Aladar, his first word.

2073
01:46:36,680 --> 01:46:39,680
Aladar.

2074
01:46:39,680 --> 01:46:42,680
He sounds like ET too.

2075
01:46:42,680 --> 01:46:45,680
Aladar.

2076
01:46:45,680 --> 01:46:52,680
Then he's in school one day and people are kids are talking about trying to see if they can figure out where babies come from.

2077
01:46:52,680 --> 01:46:54,680
And he says babies come from the mail.

2078
01:46:54,680 --> 01:46:58,680
That's where my bestest little brother came from.

2079
01:46:58,680 --> 01:47:01,680
eBay.

2080
01:47:01,680 --> 01:47:03,680
An angel named eBay.

2081
01:47:03,680 --> 01:47:04,680
Let's get this kid.

2082
01:47:04,680 --> 01:47:06,680
Let's teach him a lesson.

2083
01:47:06,680 --> 01:47:08,680
Oh, God.

2084
01:47:08,680 --> 01:47:09,680
Oh, God.

2085
01:47:09,680 --> 01:47:12,680
When the other kids are mad about him.

2086
01:47:12,680 --> 01:47:15,680
Everybody knows it's from sex.

2087
01:47:15,680 --> 01:47:16,680
Let's beat him up.

2088
01:47:16,680 --> 01:47:21,680
Good boy, generation two doesn't know babies come from sex.

2089
01:47:21,680 --> 01:47:24,680
His dad does a theme park podcast still.

2090
01:47:24,680 --> 01:47:26,680
He's been doing it for 10 years.

2091
01:47:26,680 --> 01:47:27,680
Get him harder.

2092
01:47:27,680 --> 01:47:29,680
Get him harder than.

2093
01:47:29,680 --> 01:47:35,680
No, I will not send it to my child to this.

2094
01:47:35,680 --> 01:47:36,680
That's why we're getting out of here.

2095
01:47:36,680 --> 01:47:38,680
We're not we're not going to engage this fantasy anymore.

2096
01:47:38,680 --> 01:47:43,680
Go to our social medias and check us out there on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

2097
01:47:43,680 --> 01:47:49,680
And if you want three bonus episodes every month, go to podcast thread, the second gate at Patreon dot com slash podcast.

2098
01:47:49,680 --> 01:47:50,680
The ride there.

2099
01:47:50,680 --> 01:47:52,680
The buck stops here.

2100
01:47:52,680 --> 01:47:53,680
I say.

2101
01:47:54,680 --> 01:47:58,680
However, though, I would like to end the episode on it.

2102
01:47:58,680 --> 01:48:09,680
Just Jason, if you could do one clean what you imagine that that toy sounds like based on what the listener told you and we'll compare it eventually when it comes and Mike tested himself.

2103
01:48:13,680 --> 01:48:16,680
Did you do it like we didn't hear it?

2104
01:48:16,680 --> 01:48:17,680
Wait, I didn't hear it.

2105
01:48:17,680 --> 01:48:18,680
Oh, OK.

2106
01:48:18,680 --> 01:48:25,680
Ah, like a man, like someone choking in a restaurant.

2107
01:48:25,680 --> 01:48:33,680
All right, we will put the real and it probably it probably was supposed to say like, hurry, come on, everyone.

2108
01:48:33,680 --> 01:48:34,680
Stand together.

2109
01:48:34,680 --> 01:48:35,680
That's how it is.

2110
01:48:35,680 --> 01:48:38,680
Get your stand together.

2111
01:48:38,680 --> 01:48:40,680
Stand together.

2112
01:48:40,680 --> 01:48:45,680
Honestly, that sounds like a cute little noise.

2113
01:48:45,680 --> 01:48:53,680
Well, yeah, just record Jason doing that and put that in the toy.

2114
01:48:53,680 --> 01:48:55,680
So it sounds like that.

2115
01:48:55,680 --> 01:48:57,680
And then we'll start selling these.

2116
01:48:57,680 --> 01:48:58,680
We'll 3D print them.

2117
01:48:58,680 --> 01:48:59,680
We'll copy the mold.

2118
01:48:59,680 --> 01:49:06,680
Now I'm going to carry baby all around like he's Grogu and I'm mandalorian.

2119
01:49:06,680 --> 01:49:08,680
You have to protect him.

2120
01:49:08,680 --> 01:49:11,680
It's going to have a floating bassinet.

2121
01:49:11,680 --> 01:49:19,680
In a few years, we'll see like a post from like a Chris, Chris Evans or Chris Pine of like.

2122
01:49:19,680 --> 01:49:23,680
And by the way, the upcoming movie Aladar is not based on Disney's.

2123
01:49:23,680 --> 01:49:28,680
It's based on the dinosaur Aladar that exists that the movie was based on.

2124
01:49:28,680 --> 01:49:31,680
Why was it only Chris's Jason?

2125
01:49:31,680 --> 01:49:32,680
Huh?

2126
01:49:32,680 --> 01:49:33,680
Because I couldn't remember.

2127
01:49:33,680 --> 01:49:37,680
It's one Chris is playing Buzz Lightyear and I couldn't remember which of the Chris's.

2128
01:49:37,680 --> 01:49:41,680
I believe it is Evans.

2129
01:49:41,680 --> 01:49:43,680
Yeah, he's playing.

2130
01:49:43,680 --> 01:49:45,680
And also Chris is I'm not getting anywhere.

2131
01:49:45,680 --> 01:49:47,680
Only Chris is allowed to work.

2132
01:49:47,680 --> 01:49:51,680
You know, you can't do anything.

2133
01:49:51,680 --> 01:49:52,680
All right.

2134
01:49:52,680 --> 01:49:53,680
We will play.

2135
01:49:53,680 --> 01:49:57,680
We'll put this cursed item up to the microphone when it's in our possession.

2136
01:49:57,680 --> 01:49:59,680
But for now, thanks for listening.

2137
01:49:59,680 --> 01:50:00,680
