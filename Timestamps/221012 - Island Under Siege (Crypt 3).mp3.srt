1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:28,080
Crypt Three Welcome to haunt cast the fright club freak?

2
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,680
Club freak?

3
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:38,480
I pose to you guys that's a pitch could be yeah I was like why don't we sort this out just in the

4
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:45,120
you know club freak like me because it's in the same universe yeah yeah it is a little

5
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:51,440
applicable characters well imagine like the logo that we have and then it's spray painted over

6
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:59,120
with freak yeah that could be okay yeah yeah but that's a little middling the other pitch is club

7
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:05,680
eek exclamation point do you okay did you encounter the phrase streaks and foons

8
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:12,800
okay so could be club treak oh I don't know if they have the copyright of club treak we I'm very

9
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:18,000
excited about treaks and foons but we are now marrying ourselves to something very obscure

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,480
well look it's it's another island so it is adjacent but I'm sure it was going to come up

11
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:30,560
eventually well let me look I'm not sure either of those are uh home runs so if there's something

12
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:36,080
else if it occurs to you now or we have to keep I mean we got only like a day to figure this out

13
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:44,480
but club club three headed dog you would like the like from hell like a cerebus uh-huh yeah how

14
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:52,560
about that club three headed dog that was a kind that's good so enthusiastic about anything yet

15
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:58,160
no one's been that jacked well yeah you know we'll sleep on it that's interesting it's interesting

16
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:04,640
that the listener will know what it is and when we don't currently um and if we landed at one of

17
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,520
those then you know we threw in the towel or maybe you have better ideas uh well we'll figure it out

18
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:18,720
we're at club something and uh today we are discussing the topic island under siege

19
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,840
which is a it's a it's the marvel scare zone from islands of adventure I will get into that

20
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:32,000
right after this just just to say this poll the most nail biter yes of a poll there has been

21
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,040
by because often what's happened you know look we spelled out what to do with garfield eats we

22
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:42,560
pretty much said hey you know vote vote for it we you know we might have cranked the meters

23
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:49,360
yes hi didn't do any politicking for this one seemingly no no I don't think anybody had a super

24
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,880
a super dog a three-headed dog in the fight I mean I was very pleased with the results it certainly

25
00:02:54,880 --> 00:03:00,400
seems like something I would suggest yeah absolutely uh uh and then I'm delighted because

26
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,800
it's a thing I've never heard of and that's always good to stumble on too because if we exhaust

27
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,680
everything that we know about already in the podcast but if we find out about new things

28
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:17,840
it can go forever and ever forever uh forever um this one this topic won by five votes wow

29
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:23,520
that's how low that's how close of a margin with a lot of it with the highest voter turnout yet

30
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,520
uh people really came through that percentage is going up and up but just let that be a lesson don't

31
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:35,440
say that voting doesn't matter if any if anyone ever tells you according to twitter it seems like

32
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:40,240
there's a lot of people walking up to randos on the street and saying voting doesn't matter and

33
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:46,560
then they keep walking so if that ever happens to you don't listen because every vote counts in this

34
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:52,880
I thought we were maybe heading to to run off here but uh it squeaked it out yeah no it's a good point

35
00:03:53,200 --> 00:04:00,240
and yeah for sure vote in every club three poll that's the number one thing you should vote for

36
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:06,640
yes this nove and the next one is november that's true so this november vote look I know you and you

37
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:11,360
might end up exhausted from voting so I understand if you only want to vote for one thing and of

38
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:17,360
course we want that one thing to be the topic hershel walker oh okay well depending on where you

39
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:21,840
live of course no no all right if you're there get the vote out for hershel yeah for hersh but

40
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:29,920
will one of his secret children be the deciding vote in he just by like you know like based on

41
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:34,560
stats it seems very possible that we have one of his secret children in the audience it's entirely

42
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:40,880
the audience is growing and it's like oh we could see a repeat of kevin costner's swing vote is it

43
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,920
kevin costner starring griffin newman yes yeah starring griffin newman yeah wait no no no no

44
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:52,560
that's oh he's oh he's the one yelling at the I got the weird kevin costner movie run but you

45
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:59,520
all agree that's that seemed right right to me uh-huh no not swing vote draft day draft day I

46
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:07,520
just want to say I there's a little slogan to remember to vote vote uh vote in okay wait vote

47
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:15,600
in the ptr no matter who you are that's the wait let's punch that up uh vote for club three and

48
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:23,360
ptr no matter who you are you know vote blue no matter who vote in club three or like vote

49
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,280
vote in club three no matter who are the okay that's better that's better better better good

50
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,520
punch up that's how it works that's how good ideas get formed maybe some of these creative

51
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:40,000
juices will eventually be funneled to whatever we're calling this uh yeah or you well no we

52
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,120
know the name of the episode we don't know the name of the thing we don't know what the yeah well

53
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,440
we'll put our heads together because we have to because we don't have a lot of time so uh the

54
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:55,200
runner-up which barely lost spirit halloween yeah moves to next halloween yeah so we'll put a big

55
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:01,520
pin in that and now we head into november need you to vote this november and we go back to non

56
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,680
spooky topics unless you still got really good spooky ones sure in the hole in your pocket but

57
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,960
let's open it up to uh to anything and uh the returning fighter of course is suggested by

58
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:18,000
william evans is uh that we watch all of bob iger's master class now that is a um 12 hour

59
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:25,840
endeavor is that is it longer or less long uh not sure i can look it up while we some of those are

60
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,640
like four hours i feel like but i don't know okay i think it depends i think it depends how much

61
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:38,720
wisdom the uh person has to impart yeah so or how much other work they have to do right oh no no no

62
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:45,600
13 video lessons totaling two hours and 11 oh okay that's not so bad and you know what i will

63
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:52,000
make a club three promise that in this case i will not tap out at 38 minutes okay this i'm

64
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,120
because this i can learn from yeah i truly thought these were like i i guess i was too

65
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:02,080
naive i thought these were like great courses plus you know you can borrow those on a few apps for

66
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:08,080
free on like library lending apps these are scams oh okay that makes sense these are big scams yeah

67
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:14,240
where's somebody sits for two hours and just does an interview and they cut it up got it yeah that's

68
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,800
true if you yeah i guess you would know well we'll find out well we will one of the things we would

69
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:24,800
report is does iger ever change his shirt which might indicate that a second day was put in or

70
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:33,120
at least like a shower i it doesn't feel like it no way um so that's the one to beat but uh will it

71
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:38,240
win i don't know depends on what you guys suggest so uh keep comments suggestions coming in the

72
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,000
comments we appreciate everything's been great as evidenced by this where all these things were so

73
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:48,240
close uh monster cereals in there too that i was rooting for that one but we'll but it goes to the

74
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:54,160
crypt now paul and paul paul and got really betrayed i feel like jason threw it out and

75
00:07:54,160 --> 00:08:00,000
yeah uh-huh it seemed like the you know we weren't nudging people that hard but right i'm interested

76
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,320
to know i mean there's a it looks like it's a good split between what people's interests are because

77
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:11,040
there's i i'm impressed that marvel won not that i know marvel's popular and we like marvel a lot

78
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:16,800
but but it's a very this is not the marvel of today right this is this is very much a different

79
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:24,000
era this is coming out of bankruptcy era marvel and like license like handshake well not handshake

80
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,080
contract but like not not fully watching the shop marvel like nowadays which is beautiful which is

81
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:38,320
happened potentially yeah so this is an era where a little more fun was being had a little more

82
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:44,000
random fun was being had obviously yes there's a reason uh maybe it didn't happen again is because

83
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,040
there was too much fun being had but we will address that license well yeah let's talk about

84
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:55,200
that later because i got some bones to pick with that oh that theory bones all right here just as

85
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:02,240
a way in let me read the full suggestion and this was suggested by eric b madden island under siege

86
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:09,120
the short-lived marvel superhero island scare zone that featured carnage and dead superheroes

87
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:18,160
yeah that is the an entry point and a nice synopsis um didn't know about it until now um basic stuff

88
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:24,240
about it 2002 yes was the year this is the first universal halloween horror nights

89
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:32,720
that was held in islands of adventure yes halloween horror nights 12 12 okay retroactively 12

90
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:38,640
uh i think if you go back to the early halloween horror nights like the first year or two it was a

91
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:45,440
pretty sparse affair okay and even this one if you got some of the video clips of it and stuff

92
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:51,760
they don't have all the ips yet you know there's a fear factor house on the other side of islands

93
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:58,640
of adventure but there's not like a halloween house and big horror weekend yeah big horror ips

94
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,120
yeah this it is but i'll say this the footage of it makes the whole thing seem creepier

95
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:09,680
oh yeah seems odder and weirder and not polished and feels like you might be more unnerved now it's

96
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:15,120
possibly it's also partly because of the vhs footage that exists this the small amount of

97
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:20,720
footage i should say but not a lot to work with here well do you guys know about the art of the

98
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:27,200
scare did you watch that i saw a comment some listener thank you led me to art of the scare

99
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:34,480
yes so this was a special for where and what i could not tell um i think it was traveled channel

100
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:39,200
okay and i think they filmed at islands of adventure at horror nights to that

101
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:46,160
20 2002 and then aired the special in 2003 okay i'll maybe promoting the next year which then was

102
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:52,320
also fully at islands of adventure that's there to clarify that that there were at this time it was

103
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:57,680
not both parks it was either or so for a couple years it went to fully islands of adventure and

104
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:02,960
then i think in 2004 there was enough uh interest in halloween horror nights that it was at both

105
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:09,680
places yeah and then eventually just back to the original universal park okay okay uh although that

106
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:13,840
and that's still how they there's nothing i believe so yeah i don't think there's anything at islands

107
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:20,000
of adventure well there's uh they have the death eaters the death eaters are there yeah um but yeah

108
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,920
so this was what is it 20 years ago already when we're discussing yeah it's the 20 year anniversary

109
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:31,600
of island 20 years ago i would have never stepped foot here that being said i didn't even know about

110
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:37,840
the marvel thing did you know about this at the time i did know about this from reading universal

111
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:43,360
message boards in college after the fact though after the fact because you were yeah i started

112
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:49,200
college what fall 2003 so after the fact i learned like oh holy shit there was a marvel

113
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:56,640
like haunt thing so my first question is would it have gotten you to go uh that may have gotten me

114
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:02,080
to go because i'm trying to think i think it would have gotten me to go but i'm not sure

115
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:09,920
i may have still been a chicken to do it would it get you to go now uh now i i think it would

116
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,040
you think it would i think it would you take would you take a flight would you go across the country

117
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:21,920
to go to this well that's a good question park podcast yeah i'd consider you would have to go

118
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:28,800
i feel like i would yeah but now they they just wouldn't no i know it's oh i mean yeah it's not

119
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:33,760
going to ever happen but i'm just i'm just trying to think of would this have like started you on

120
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:39,280
going to a haunt just because it's such an attractive like ip that you like yeah because

121
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:43,040
i i'm maybe i'm trying to figure out if i would have done it back then i don't i might have still

122
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:47,120
been too scared obviously right now i would be amazed it would be amazing to do it but

123
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,680
i'm just wondering if this would have gotten you into haunts 20 years ago well i don't know that

124
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:58,480
the walk-around characters at island of adventure wherever like a big uh uh selling point you know

125
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:05,120
yeah sure but i just it's such a fun crazy narrative it is a funny idea uh scott is there

126
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:10,400
an ip 20 years ago that would have gotten you into haunts what did you love 20 years ago was it uh

127
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:15,840
saturday night live if there was like uh like uh it's like wes anderson movies and punch

128
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:21,360
trunk love if there was a punch trunk love oh yeah themed yeah because i was new that year

129
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:30,320
so i would although well it wasn't i don't think it was out in october so it was in the fall yeah

130
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,480
it was in the fall year around then i feel november is what's in my head but i don't quite recall but

131
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:40,720
yeah if there was something uh if it was a simulation of uh the valley of north hollywood

132
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:45,760
around where i used to live a simulation of the the french restaurant and a used car lot and all

133
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:52,400
the ut and different utah brothers are jumping out at you and and threatening your car with crowbars

134
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:58,480
and saying they're gonna they're gonna hurt your girl yeah and then uh uh what does he smash the

135
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:03,920
like the back door or the glass door in the movie yeah like you'd have a well maybe there's some

136
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:09,520
like you know i feel like it's maybe a trope of mazes that you're like in the the head of one of

137
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:13,760
the great villains or even like the weekend it seemed like a weird like fever dream that the

138
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:20,240
weekend had so if you're yeah you're in barry egan's head and like seeing what causes the rage

139
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,160
fits and maybe going it oh that's another way to get a lot of characters in there you have people

140
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:29,520
playing the the many sisters that he has which causes him to to freak out and right yes the

141
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:35,120
dinner party you you go through the bathroom as he's beating it up yeah you get to be part and

142
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:40,960
maybe there's multiple barry egan's all beating up the bathroom um this would have gotten you to go

143
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:47,040
yeah yeah yeah yeah this or the royal dead and bombs the funny question i asked it as a funny

144
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:52,720
question but i do think there's like all there's like this is the butterfly effect you know you go

145
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,200
to like 20 years ago something that would have would have gotten you to go the butterfly effect

146
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:03,440
is the movie the butterfly yeah yeah it was that would be my uh top ip 20 years or me put uh how

147
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:09,680
about punch drunk love hate rising yeah that's good yeah so that would have done it um because

148
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:16,320
yeah this might have done it for me this marvel or a butterfly effect action yeah um uh well it's

149
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,560
fun to think about where we were at then and what would it because you need the more extreme

150
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:27,520
uh teen tastes i guess to yeah to get you in there and this is like this is appealing to a

151
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:34,960
pretty specific angle on marvel fandom this because there's like there's like uh i get you know i'm

152
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:40,800
not a big marvel person but there's like there are the materials for if you want like edgy

153
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:45,600
fucked up like there there is that sure there was in the comics at the time and this is playing

154
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:52,080
into that completely yeah this is right at the start of marvel max and the mature readers line

155
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:58,400
carthin is carthin is dirty nick fury book punisher is that when he started doing punisher

156
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:04,400
you know he did a marvel knights and then that switched to max okay where it could get dirtier

157
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:09,440
and violent her well i don't know that i've ever read them was it like r rated or was it like pg 13

158
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:16,960
it was like vertigo it was like dcs like there was like naked jessica jones and luke cage having sex

159
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:25,200
in the first issue of like nudity or yeah some nudity like butt uh yes it's heavily implied that

160
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:31,680
they have anal sex in the first issue really yeah heavily implied this was scandalous i this

161
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:37,120
at the time passed me by alias bendis right yeah yeah okay interesting bryan michael bendis uh

162
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:42,000
comic book writer yeah uh so okay this might be by the way with what just occurred this might be a

163
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,120
good time to tell you that something that was set up in an earlier episode in the dr doom episode

164
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:53,040
is still in effect the paper never left my garage oh yeah the fun fun fun facts if you don't

165
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:58,800
remember oh please yeah sure about no no i'm not doing it now i'm just saying uh that i i wanted

166
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:03,280
to come with protection you want to be prepared for situations like you don't want to use it

167
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:07,200
necessarily but if you don't remember what this was right and this is this will just be around in

168
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:15,520
the future that if there if marvel talk that i cannot penetrate um if i'm sorry to say penetrate

169
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:22,480
so soon after the anal sex reference uh but uh if i if i fill on the outside of i do have uh

170
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:30,080
10 beach boys facts okay that are uh not funny but i will i i will read one of no

171
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:34,400
uh choice but to deploy yeah yeah exactly yes great i also want to make it clear though when i

172
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,720
said but i just meant is there a picture of a but i didn't mean is there any else any well it was

173
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,640
such a perfect transition no you're right it's a one i want to be clear that that's not what i was

174
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:48,000
asking for i was just saying is there nudity yeah not sexual content anyway so yes they were

175
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:53,200
that happen in this and at the theme park did they pay tribute to the anal sex implication scene

176
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:58,720
is there any anal sex at island adventure i don't know that's a good question no it's not

177
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:06,640
question i don't answer to well i think the the real answer is the comics were more leaning

178
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:11,680
towards r-rated and this is still pretty pj 13 yeah now let me ask you this because

179
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:19,120
do i'm sensing now that you may not like this concept at all which concept really concept of

180
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:23,920
i'm asking jason because because there was a phrase in one of the wikipedia's that that said that

181
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,400
like you know this is obviously the kind of intense for kids or whatever and and i've said this

182
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:33,040
before the anecdote about jason seeing the first infinity war when half the superheroes are turned

183
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:37,600
to dust and he said i don't i didn't like it because all these kids are going to be so sad

184
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:45,760
i you you i i am not wild about it but not for that reason oh okay see interesting i sense this

185
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:52,640
because i somebody served up a marvel topic and jason's wild i love this i i think this is great

186
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:59,600
sorry i i'm not let me go back i do like this concept i'm not wild about the objection

187
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:06,880
to this concept oh okay so you do like so the opposite i misspoke yes oh okay no then you

188
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:13,920
then you like it i am into i really like this i'm into the uh i thought this would come later but

189
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:19,680
i'll say it now the objection to it from like somewhat at marvel's side some dummy at marvel's

190
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:25,040
side was like this is terrible we can't have this what if children see this the superheroes are dying

191
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:34,000
by 2002 marvel had pumped out so many storylines it was pat to do the the heroes are dead the

192
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:42,240
villains all won this is mere years after a story called onslaught where all the fantastic four

193
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:47,920
and avengers sacrifice themselves seemingly they die really they just go into a pocket universe

194
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:55,600
and then there was another story called legion quest where professor x's son goes back in time

195
00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:02,080
to try to kill magneto in reality what happens is professor x dies this causes an apoc the age of

196
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:08,960
apocalypse to happen they never do it do they they never do something they never do it i was all

197
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:14,320
when i heard about the movies i was like whoa shit really they killed everybody like yeah but they of

198
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:19,840
course they didn't do it right they had around the time of a one-shot comic called the punisher kills

199
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:28,720
the marvel universe where he does that he does okay okay all right so great now we're talking

200
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,960
now see well now i'm coming from the perspective of i don't care about any of this

201
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:39,120
so kill everybody as far as i'm concerned sure so like a world where that's that's the deed that

202
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:45,600
like the we're on marvel superhero island and the heroes are no more and the villi so they're all

203
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:53,840
gone yeah yeah or like or they're you know they they like ran screaming they like they ran in fear

204
00:20:54,480 --> 00:21:02,160
they're changing their names yeah um bloody captain america shield mounted oh god i saw a

205
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:07,040
headless spider-man body mentioned but i didn't see a picture of it but that's pretty funny

206
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:17,840
uh-huh i there's a uh like a wolverine corpse i i read uh that sounds right or impaled impaled

207
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,560
oh do we see a there's a there's not that many pictures because there's a couple videos and

208
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:27,520
they use some of the same footage and it's like maybe there's like a like a beaten up dr strange

209
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:33,680
walking around whoa or like a she hulk that's like kind of like looking like she hulks i think

210
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:37,920
yeah that was she hulk right yeah walking around with a gun she looks yeah like really like she's

211
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:44,080
seen some shit at this point uh yeah but yeah there was yeah was i like thor's hammer is like

212
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:49,840
everything's bloody shield uh bloody thor's hammer bloody iron man's helmet bloody because

213
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:56,960
they're all dead they've been killed stanley sweaters bloody uh-huh uh-huh broken glasses

214
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:06,640
broken like orange aviators you know red mustache hairs yeah really uh really disturbing stuff um

215
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:13,120
so well we haven't even said i mean like if you feel comfortable talking about this one there's a

216
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:18,720
i mean you probably i'll just say it there's a neon sign for one of the restaurants that i think

217
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:25,360
typically says dine but they didn't light up the n it says die it says diner it's the captain

218
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:31,440
america diner diner okay i'm sorry diner all right diner well and they turned off the r2 clearly die

219
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:37,920
it says it's the same gag as mel's diner becomes die okay they love this gag it's a good one yeah

220
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:43,440
it is a good gag yeah it's easy yeah it's good well it's fun to think about a hero uh you know

221
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:48,160
you guys know i don't know but just you know or i'm sorry about a villain walking around going like

222
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:53,440
okay we gotta fix this place up all right oh you know we should do you know what we gotta do

223
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,400
look at the size of diner here look at that okay just like with your fingers cover up the

224
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:06,800
end and cover up the r guys mephisto bullseye magneto come here come here look at this perfect

225
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:11,280
perfect because that is carnage is in charge of everything carnage is in charge and carnage is

226
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:17,280
like venom but worse crazier yeah venom well yeah explain that relationship to me as i don't know

227
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:23,120
about this venom have you seen the venom films no okay do you know venom he's uh uh i know the

228
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:34,640
rap song about him the best is a great song uh great song uh so there's a symbiote which is an

229
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:40,000
alien life form uh and and when it's the comic the first story is that it like attaches itself to

230
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,880
spider-man it turns his costume black he starts to feel bad and like evil or whatever and then

231
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:51,120
it jumps off and it jumps onto eddie brock and that guy turns into venom but it's the same type

232
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:56,720
of symbiote that like attaches itself to cletus cassidy who's a complete psychopath a serial

233
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:03,120
killer serial killer okay so he's like and even like eddie brock is like a bad guy but not like

234
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:08,400
so bad his nickname is the lethal protector yeah there's like times when he's good there's times

235
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:14,720
when he's bad there's different people who had this the venom symbiote uh but cletus

236
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:23,200
cassidy carnage is a crazy madman fully only bad or if yeah so they've made him the main guy who's

237
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:28,080
in charge of all the signs at islands of adventure he is in charge of making all make sure all the

238
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:33,920
signs are clever and uh halloweenified well it's nice that he keeps up the theme park tradition of

239
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:41,200
yeah yeah clever wordplay does carnage speak or does he just growl he speaks yeah he speaks

240
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:47,200
i actually i will admit i have not seen uh venom 2 where he is played by woody harrelson oh that's

241
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:53,120
who okay i might like that i tend to always like woody harrelson sure i mean he's great he's in

242
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,960
everything i mean he's he's out of hand in every uh universe at this point maybe one maybe the

243
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:01,600
only actor where i get excited if he's added to a franchise like the like planet of the apes

244
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:06,720
hunger games uh well i still now that still didn't get me but if i end you know hey next

245
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:11,840
time i want to play i will i will try to watch every woody harrelson movie available on planes

246
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:18,160
at least uh and then you know what you also got to do watch this club random uh anyway moving on

247
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:26,960
yeah so so carnage is like he's up in like uh what would you call it cherry picker he's not a cherry

248
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:32,960
picker but it's sort of that vibe but like here i am i'm he's like mickey uh conducting uh like

249
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,800
the water fountain or something and like in a cherry picker in a cherry picker like in the

250
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:44,320
epcot yeah yeah so uh yeah he's like kind of shouting directions and controlling traffic

251
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:52,880
from up there he's he's activating the fog yes which is firing off a lot of fog yeah so uh uh

252
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:57,040
just looking at the vhs footage of all of it with the fog directing the chain link put the

253
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:03,680
chain link fence there put the barrels there put the burnt cop cars there and it's not so well

254
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:08,640
lit in these few videos i've seen too where like you go to horror nights now the whole thing is

255
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:16,720
lit well the music is loud and it's like scary but it's kind of not it's kind of a party atmosphere

256
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:21,200
i don't know watching these videos to me there i felt more unnerved because it felt closer to

257
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:26,320
being like oh something's wrong at the park yeah like there is like a bunch of fires that were set

258
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:31,680
and it doesn't it didn't feel so polished which makes the whole thing feel more unnerving to me

259
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:38,000
i wasn't there but that's the vibe i'm getting from the footage yeah yeah yeah i think especially

260
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:44,800
the footage of the house on the island which is called maximum carnage right which was like a 90s

261
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:52,640
storyline and video game and video game yeah and uh it is unnerving because it's just a lot of like

262
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:58,640
seems like they're using the dr doom or the spider-man overflow queue and it's a lot of

263
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:06,160
you know those pneumatic drills they have that they just put on scrap metal and waterfall effects

264
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:13,040
and uh lighting effects and people dressed as like nuclear mutants or uh henchmen

265
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:21,040
so it's just kind of a little more chaotic yes it's not it's it's watching the actual maze itself

266
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:25,840
because i guess we could take a step back real quick is that there was they were trying they

267
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:33,040
they had it like an overarching theme narrative to the horror nights of the time yes oh yes right

268
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:40,560
but they had two yes it's kind of yes so initially it was a little girl everything in the same way

269
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:45,760
that starlight express is taking place on like a little boy's head oh yeah they had this narrative

270
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:52,640
of a original character named cindy of a little girl and all the different areas of islands of

271
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:57,200
adventure all the different haunts were like visions she was having in her head is that right

272
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:02,960
uh yeah that was like her toys and her play things wreaking havoc right but the wiki says

273
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:07,040
that there were a lot of child abductions at the time and they decided to change this character

274
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:16,640
into uh what the care the caretaker caretaker yeah uh uh hhn legacy says unfortunately a slew of

275
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:23,360
child abductions within central the central florida area caused universal to scrap the idea of cindy

276
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:29,600
and create the character of the caretaker out of her father paul bearer yes which is also a

277
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:34,880
wrestling man it had been for yeah 12 years yeah it's crazy there was so many florida abductions

278
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:42,160
matt gates wasn't even around yet oh yes i mean he was around but we don't know where he was

279
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:51,200
so they had like yeah so they they had tied all the ip to these this original lore this universal

280
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:58,480
lore so there was like a a seuss they didn't have a maze yeah they did like fog up the seuss area

281
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:05,120
and turn off all the rides and it was called oh it's uh boo what is it booville thank you

282
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:10,000
yes this is where to be this is where i got excited because i was a little like

283
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,560
it's a marvel thing is this interesting and then like starting for the special that you mentioned

284
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:18,560
jay's weight that's already the scare is the special yeah uh because they take you through

285
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:23,600
they show the map at the beginning and very seriously say all the but to seuss landing

286
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:30,720
becomes booville port of entry is now port of evil um something's called scary tales

287
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:37,840
yeah which one is that oh is that the lost continent yeah maybe yeah i don't know what

288
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:43,760
to do with that one so that becomes scary fairy tales that had nightmare it did was what's that

289
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:49,120
become an icon i think would come back ah they were like what's nightmare what is he oh sorry

290
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:56,480
he's just a creepy uh like demon guy okay you know i i am interested in the horror night's lore

291
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:03,360
you know you got the caretaker you got the director you know you got nightmare and fear they're

292
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:09,840
different sure i don't know any of this but we will that seem people seem to want to hear but that

293
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:15,360
so we'll figure that out we'll know i think i'm more interested in diving into all of that stuff

294
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:19,920
than actually going to horror nights while you're going next year okay we'll see

295
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:27,200
there's gonna be a smile house people smiling yeah there'll be a lot of smiles they're gonna do like

296
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:31,840
five on five off because everyone's faces are clenching because they're smiling so much is there

297
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:38,960
a strain of weed that you know of that would not make you anxious and would make you so chilled out

298
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:43,360
that you would be like just laughing your way through the whole night oh i don't know you'd

299
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:49,440
probably want an indica strain for that all right but that would probably just make me sleepy so

300
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:54,480
well if you can get through a couple houses before you go to bed that's true yeah you know although

301
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:59,920
i didn't make it through the monsters that's true and you that was you that was a strain that was

302
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:06,320
an edible though oh yeah you can't do an edible before this too potent okay this fear might be the

303
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:13,040
real fear might be that he just doesn't just falls asleep in one of the maze in the us house

304
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:19,040
right that's like a very cozy room yeah yeah yeah and like the exorcist he falls asleep next to the

305
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:24,560
what's-her-name linda blare linda blare look alike some people walking in there's just a man

306
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:30,800
sleeping while there's a puppet vomiting puppet vomiting that's so creepy it's just the still

307
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:35,680
animatronic just a mannequin there it's a nice change of pace from my childhood where i would be

308
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:42,880
the one up at night vomiting i was a pukey kid what are you gonna do which horror look people out

309
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:47,360
there have been every horror nights for 20 years which house which classic horror nights house would

310
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:52,080
you want jason to take a nap in that's my question to you oh yeah if you know the full way of the

311
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:58,160
land because there's been there's plenty of iconic beds in in 20 plus 30 years of horror nights so

312
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:02,880
like i said i was very intrigued by this house when i first learned about in college

313
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:09,280
but in the last couple years i got really interested in the haunt they did walking around

314
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:16,560
the floor of the mummy ride oh on the tr- whoa on the ground like with the track above you

315
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:22,640
that's pretty crazy it might have been the floor of kong whatever it was the ground's gotta get

316
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:26,640
you're probably not totally clear of mummy although maybe i don't know i don't know

317
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:32,720
i forget which one it might have been kong and you saw some of the city it seems so dangerous to me

318
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:37,760
there's so much universal horror night stuff i'm not aware of and i feel like it's not even that

319
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:44,240
well preserved yeah yeah because like this thing this thing you would think there would be so much

320
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,640
maybe people just didn't and it was an awkward era for there's not a lot of internet and people

321
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:54,160
don't have cameras is readily available and then low light for sure not um even just doing a history

322
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:59,840
of horror night seems good like it seems like we could get we could get uh three plus hours yeah

323
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:07,040
content the uh pictures make it seem very blair witch like taking like the old transition from

324
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:13,680
film camera to digital camera yes sure early digital camera yeah it may add to the creepiness

325
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:19,520
of it a little bit would you sleep in one of those killer clown like kind of pod things that they put

326
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:24,560
people in like they trap them in those kind of big balloon maybe i don't know anything about that

327
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:29,760
okay well they they sort of like have these we're killers in it a bullet yeah that's true

328
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:33,440
they like kidnap people and they put them in these big like hanging cotton candy

329
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:40,560
oh sort of sacks it kind of said oh and i kind of like that it looks like a babeson chair but a killer

330
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:46,640
pod isn't gonna be good well but i forget it's not really that so okay so yeah you could take a nap

331
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:54,400
in one of those um i guess a simula yeah wait because like the the pods in the matrix are very

332
00:33:54,400 --> 00:34:00,160
scary i don't want to be in one for real but maybe a simulated one you could get a nice nap in yeah

333
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:05,040
please as long as i don't have to have wires in my head yeah exactly so so there's a lot of options

334
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:11,120
yeah um if you want to talk about like inventiveness and like oh they use that area for a

335
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:19,840
for a maze the special kind of goes into a jurassic park one oh yeah yeah this is what's

336
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:23,760
interesting about this year is what they're figuring out well how do we do a horror version

337
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:33,040
of marvel and of sue subuville sure nailed it uh but jurassic park what do we do and they used the

338
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:40,320
walkthrough attraction triceratops encounter where and and had to make use of like

339
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:47,120
basically that is like going to see a very gentle uh not i forget if sleeping but like kind of

340
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:54,240
docile yeah word um you know it's a very serene kind of little attraction so how do you turn that

341
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:58,160
horror it is very like twisting and winding so i guess i'm like oh that makes a lot of sense

342
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:03,840
but they had to turn it into a scenario where there's an evil there's a bad genetics lab guy

343
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:10,000
dr burton and dr burton's doing some bad experiments and they just by hiding some

344
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:15,120
stuff in shadows and blood and flashes and then there's an impaled or like a uh a hung up

345
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:22,160
uh dr bird decapitated dr burden or something uh um and it's and then they get they made another

346
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:29,520
triceratops they made a triceratops head that was fully ripped off with a bloody spinal cord

347
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:34,240
that's coming out of it yeah isn't that's kind of crazy you talk about i mean the thing we're

348
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:38,160
talking about marvel is like oh something that's kind of darker than the franchise at large

349
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:44,560
that's there's nothing that fucked up in a jurassic park that's kind of crazy so i i'm like oh this is

350
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:50,560
a this is kind of a bold situation and yeah these uh the people putting this thing together thinking

351
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:54,400
outside of the box yeah it's they're experimenting obviously because they pulled it all back

352
00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:00,880
pretty quickly a little bit the one thing you can like you can murder and you can maim but you cannot

353
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:06,400
mess with intellectual property that's really the lesson here uh because yeah marvel now at

354
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:11,280
avengers campus they are doing at least doing stuff like you can see the zombie captain america

355
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:17,760
and werewolf by night is out which is a little short that michael giacchino just directed oh uh

356
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:22,720
which is like pretty we watched it kind of fun and man spoiler alert man things in it who's like

357
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:29,760
yeah swamp thing for marvel okay uh basically he's cute he is cute uh that's true so cute he's funny

358
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:36,640
uh so yeah but they're not gonna they're not gonna go nuts yeah yeah yeah this is a it's a nuts time

359
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:41,120
and then there's there's one more if we're talking about the lay of the land and the best phrase to

360
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:48,400
hear said by the the creepy voiced narrator of art of the scare which is the boy i was excited when

361
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:57,360
i heard the aforementioned phrase treaks and food this is what they did to tune lagoon which is the

362
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:03,280
home of our king features syndicates pals right from dudley do right and popeye that's pretty

363
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:10,000
specific to what the hell do you do we have to make a scary zone but also you'll see dudley do

364
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:16,000
right there and i i can't say i know exactly what they did but they've used the phrase treaks and

365
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:23,920
foons which i guess is freaks and tunes mixed up they're kind of like killer clowns they're

366
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:30,400
kind of bouncing freakish things that's what it is the treaks they were like original characters

367
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:36,640
original characters but i think we're burying the lead they pump the land full of foam foam party

368
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:42,720
foam an upsetting amount of foam that you have to walk through pretty much to get

369
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:51,200
to jurassic park unless you go counterclockwise uh from port of entry like a real sicko you and i have

370
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:57,040
been in a play we had to walk through foam a couple years ago we ended up at the end of a foam party

371
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:02,640
yeah in a bar that was not far from where i used to live yeah um and you got like lost in the foam

372
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:09,440
at one point and we went we went out on the patio yes there was a full foam party happening with like

373
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:14,320
naked like semi-naked people happening in a bar down the street and you had to go through it

374
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:20,160
no we didn't want to get to the bathroom you did wait but why were you there to begin with i mean

375
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:24,000
if the answer is you were there to go to the party that makes sense we were not it was the only bar

376
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:30,000
open till last call it was memorial day weekend like seven years ago and there was a play was it

377
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:36,640
called michaels no uh and mj mj's maybe yeah it was across the street from the gelsens which used

378
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:42,560
to be the disney studios and we said was there anything open and somebody said oh there's mj's

379
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:47,920
it's a gay bar oh but it's the only thing and we go oh yeah let's go over there so we went over there

380
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:55,600
and it was not just a bar it was a rave happening there were men in their underwear in a foam party

381
00:38:55,680 --> 00:39:00,560
and i was like this is happening right like it's not the like the street where you would assume

382
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:05,200
big parties like that are happening sure so we were like okay well we're not prepared markets yes

383
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:10,480
i am not in the shape to have to strip all my clothes off and have a foam part didn't feel in

384
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:15,040
foam shape at the time i was not if all the bartenders were fucking jacked i remember we

385
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:19,760
gave them some money like they would just slap it on their chests to stick the dollar bills there

386
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:24,240
and we were like well let's let's just sit on the terrace i mean we were the five or six of us none

387
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:29,920
of us prepared to a party in foam and it was a cold spring it was a cold spring it was not in

388
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:35,520
the weather to be getting in the mix a novel phrase is the beginning of a novel you kind of had to go

389
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:38,720
through the phone to get to the bathroom which we all went to once and i remember jason disapproved

390
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:42,480
through the phone and i told turn to the everybody else who was with us and i went we're never seeing

391
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:48,240
him again he's gonna get lost in the foam i the bathroom i got lost because i was reading there

392
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:54,480
was a printout much like your printout of beach boys facts there was a sign on the door of the

393
00:39:54,480 --> 00:40:00,000
regulations for the bathroom which were all different ways of saying please do not have sex

394
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,240
in the bathroom yeah and everyone in the bathroom they were everyone was really nice but they were

395
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:08,000
everyone's in their underwear and they were like why aren't you in the phone like what are you

396
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:13,600
doing man and i was like look i didn't know we didn't know we didn't know i'm not in the shape

397
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:19,680
i'm not in the shape to do this we got here 10 minutes before last call we just want to drink

398
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:27,120
a single newcastle each and leave i'm not against get foamy you only drink if you're foamy i was not

399
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:31,360
against the part i always wanted to go to a foam party in college i never did it never seemed to

400
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:36,080
come up um but i was you love your big douchey parties and you haven't been to a foam party

401
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:42,000
never went to a foam party in college and yes i was wildly i did i went to one really rito

402
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:47,920
rosarito which one is it really were you sure great town i don't believe no i don't believe

403
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:55,200
it was required or uh it was uh very bad and it stung my eyes oh okay you're not missing out on

404
00:40:55,200 --> 00:41:02,640
much i went to one as he uh had died down so everything was just kind of clammy and soapy

405
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:07,840
like everyone was like oh that was fun but we didn't buy enough detergent like someone had

406
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:13,120
just covered an apartment in tarps oh wow that does not seem like a good usually don't you get

407
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:20,000
like a warehouse for that yeah you probably should yeah so but anyway so we've learned that the time

408
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:25,760
to go to a foam party is not the very end nothing in both cases this place maybe not in where i went

409
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:31,440
in mexico so that your eyes don't sting yeah there's nothing sexy about that yeah yeah

410
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:37,040
up higher quality foam won't sting your eyes um but yeah then this place closed down the street

411
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:41,840
and it was replaced by a place that had a bunch of like bad reports of like people drugging drinks

412
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:46,960
and stuff which might still be there primarily known uh among our friends is like oh don't go

413
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:53,680
there people keep getting roofied yeah so that's uh they're not doing foam parties i can't even

414
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:59,280
remember the name is very stupid and i can't remember it so anyway don't go in don't go

415
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:05,920
anywhere with a stupid name anyway treaks and foons treaks and foons so they're a bunch of weird

416
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:12,720
little bouncing freaks treaks and foons bouncing around i saw them giving people hugs in the foam

417
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:17,040
they were popping out of the foam and scaring people do you think that they there was a clear

418
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:24,080
delineation between what is a phone and what is a tree there was i know what it is i i think they

419
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:31,440
said in the special they said what makes one is one boys and one girl yeah one is male one is female

420
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:39,280
wow why what it's so interesting because like why didn't they just do the same gimmick in

421
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:47,680
tomb lagoon all the good guys are dead and it's the best oh bluto and snow and snidely whiplash

422
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:57,040
and like uh and uh and kathy's enemy ice cream ice cream is alive uh and what the the wife lock

423
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:02,880
horn is alive because she's the villain of that strip right i hate this there's a lot i don't know

424
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:07,280
man lock horn hate his wife jason is that the gimmick of that they hate each other okay so

425
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:15,840
maybe they're both dead the undead lock horns yeah the um the the the kid from family circus is uh

426
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:20,000
dead they're all dead and there's just the there's like a little like sprite that one of them could

427
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:25,920
see they told him to do or like tisk tisk them i don't know the name offhand put that in the

428
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:30,080
comments but not as a suggestion for an episode i don't think that's strong enough unless it is

429
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:34,480
maybe i might be strong enough yeah it could be uh so yeah so like that i'm wondering why they

430
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:38,960
didn't even go that way because it feels like people would be even less precious about those

431
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:43,200
characters but i guess it doesn't maybe thematically make sense king feature syndicate

432
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:47,760
might have been in better financial shape than marvel at that oh for sure at that point yeah

433
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:52,160
that's true so maybe they had more sway maybe they maybe they were presented with an idea like that

434
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:57,840
yeah it was they spelled it with an i it was king features syndicate right and they just for this

435
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:02,800
event they replaced that marmaduke photo op where you're holding on to the leash and they like a dog

436
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:08,400
skeleton was put in the marmaduke oh i thought you were gonna say they turned it around and he was

437
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:15,040
running right at you running like through you or biting you yeah killing you who's marmaduke's enemy

438
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:22,640
an empty bowl i mean for sure that is was there a bad was there a villain in the mar is there a

439
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:27,200
villain in marmaduke it's a good question i don't know the seems like it'd be like a real estate

440
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:36,000
developer maybe or like the dog catcher did uh uh did nancy nancy had enemies but was there a main

441
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:44,000
nancy enemy uh in the current run of nancy she has like a rival okay so a very studious rival

442
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:49,760
gotcha did in the like in the 40s did they all was hitler all their villain in the strips i guess

443
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:55,600
so yeah i mean and fritzy kind of has an antagonistic real yeah but she loves and fritzy

444
00:44:55,600 --> 00:45:01,040
and nancy she does they do love each other but she's not a true villain yeah um i just passed by i

445
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:06,560
went oh what's marmaduke walker duel and then it turns out that was something from the civil war

446
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:13,280
okay all right it's not i'm so i'm no longer interested no boring real life snooze all right

447
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:18,000
but we've done this full circle around uh the islands was it the islands of fear

448
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:24,960
uh was that the larger i think the bigger name was islands of fear yeah like that um there's

449
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:30,640
there's one thing to say about it yeah about this the special really quick before we get back to

450
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:36,240
marvel because my favorite thing from the special has nothing to do with any of the specific mazes

451
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:43,200
it's like a general thing for about like maze craft and this is just a little behind the scenes

452
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:51,200
tidbit that i found interesting scenic pieces play a major role but how do they keep all the

453
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:59,120
visitors from fingering the props stop that really quick how do they and they're showing the visuals

454
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:07,520
there by the way or it is like a it's a disembodied hand though do they still yeah fingering that was

455
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:14,560
that afraid that word was used to mean steal for more right at a certain point like just i don't

456
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:22,640
know that the shift happened post 2002 i think people were talking about we were we were not

457
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:27,920
no right we do not have fingering on the brain we don't mean that we were worried props were

458
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:32,240
getting stolen from our favorite theme parks anyway how do you stop the guests from fingering

459
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:41,920
oh simple smear them with the gooeyest concoction you can find petroleum jelly

460
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:50,880
want to prevent fingerings better get yourself some petroleum jelly that's a good just in general

461
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:56,720
if you don't want anything to get uh uh stolen just cover it in petroleum jelly are you worried

462
00:46:56,720 --> 00:47:02,240
about a rough spade of fingerings if you lube up with jelly pocket pick you know you want to

463
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:08,400
prevent a pick pocket from picking your pocket just a jelly up your wallet lube in there lube

464
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:15,840
up your big wallet they're not going to be able to get grasps on anything nothing a pocket full of

465
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:24,080
jelly this special uh i really like this special uh in the sense it's it's very dry but it's a guy

466
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:31,280
doing that voice for 48 minutes well that bird wasn't so dry thanks to all the lube all the lube

467
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:38,000
my other favorite thing about that special is the uh editor in chief of haunted attraction magazine

468
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:45,600
who appears to be named lennard pickle cool that was a good yeah kind of an unfortunate uh pause

469
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:52,320
that i showed them um lennard pickle seems fine but he you'd think he'd be very excited being on

470
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:58,400
television um but he's more of a just the facts man he's like they're all so stressed about with

471
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:05,360
fingerings yeah focus they go well we got a whole month of fingerings ahead of us the rat lady's

472
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:10,640
pretty enthusiastic she's pretty chill about it all yeah you get to see a rat lady she actually

473
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:17,440
is in a little bed uh little glass coffin with a bunch of rats yeah she's very casual yeah they

474
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:24,160
get in little spats sometimes but it seems pretty domesticated yeah yeah they used to use when we

475
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:29,760
were at nots they said that they had some they did some weird rat stuff back in the day but then like

476
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:36,000
people were upset by that so yeah well this as we talked about the animal actor stage like the

477
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:42,480
the theme park turn away from using animals unnecessarily i think that's kind of a later

478
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:52,000
2000s thing yeah so in this day and age the rats were running wild um but not on her rat lady was

479
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:56,560
okay but so yeah that's look there was a lot going on this is a good excuse to get a general lay of

480
00:48:56,560 --> 00:49:04,480
land of 2002 of islands of fear but the most fun thing seemingly is this topsy turvy superhero

481
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:09,360
dead world yes yeah i think for sure yeah they were having the most fun with this even though

482
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:13,680
there's still stuff where you go like oh i there's so much more they could have done but for the time

483
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:19,120
it feels like they were really like swinging for the fences yeah and i want to get it let let's get

484
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:24,880
into that can we talk about the villains that were used sure they're walking around i mean carnage we

485
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:31,600
mentioned he was the big one his big bad guy a pretty popular character 90s character 90s character

486
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:41,760
used a lot over the years comes back a lot um and then the other name uh well i guess the other big

487
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:50,800
one was the cat in america uh villain crossbones who was played by frank grillo in the movies the

488
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:56,560
the current movie not in the parks not in the parks no uh played by what looks like a very

489
00:49:56,560 --> 00:50:04,000
gaunt man and then a whole bunch of other guys they had a bunch of crossbones walking around

490
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:09,280
with chainsaws they were the chainsaw guys we're looking at like seven of them some of these guys

491
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:15,280
look perfectly cast like they are jacked yeah they look like they worked at that bar that jason and

492
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:21,280
i went with the phone party yeah those guys are in good shape good shape um crossbones pretty easy

493
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:30,560
costume to do like a tank top with bones on it and a skeleton mask the other big character i saw

494
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:38,240
mentioned was craven the hunter this is a spider-man villain um scott just from the song i know him

495
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:43,680
he's from the david larry performance if you'll remember he's like kind of a big burly guy here's

496
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:49,760
here's one drawing he's kind of bane-esque kind of bane he's a hunter he likes to hunt

497
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:57,040
game and man the most dangerous game the most dangerous game of course um this is what he looked

498
00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:05,680
like at islands uh of fear uh he had frosted tips and he was real lean oh yeah yes click on it real

499
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:10,960
quick oh sorry just zoom in yeah the the most popular craven story is one in which he kills

500
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:17,840
himself is that what i have never read that craven's last time he's like he's not around

501
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:23,520
anymore i don't think they did that on the island of adventure but it's craven's last the other

502
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:30,160
villains try to stop him let him know that the way we love you no uh but yeah that's that's an old

503
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:39,280
story um yeah he's old his time yeah so uh uh i guess 1987 is when the story is from yeah he did

504
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:47,360
not have frosted tips in that story 2002 you know no wonder he killed himself geez

505
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:56,960
now he looks cool yeah yeah yeah um so yeah so so it's an interesting mix because they would have

506
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:01,120
different they had different villains inside the maze and different villains roaming around

507
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:08,320
yeah but there's no and then there was like i i think early on there were plans of like and this

508
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:13,200
film's going to take over this ride and this film's going to take over this ride but it doesn't

509
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:16,720
seem like they got very far right because it would make sense for the hulk an incredible hulk coaster

510
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:23,040
to like to be taken over by the abomination which is one of his main villains yes or the leader or

511
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:28,880
the leader tim blake nelson's character who's going to return in captain america 4 i believe

512
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:35,920
something like that for the norton hulk has this character and now we're getting norton hulk stuff

513
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:41,440
in you know we're in the ruffalo and we're gonna have to have a hulk we're gonna have to have a

514
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:49,520
spider-man with the hulks with banna norton and ruffalo and uh mizlani yeah you know it's interesting

515
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:56,240
there's a real life villain who maybe bears mentioning oh no he's from uh and i'm speaking

516
00:52:56,240 --> 00:53:03,200
of course of murray wilson the uh brian's abusive father is also the manager of the group uh you know

517
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:08,480
it's interesting it's fun fun fun that brian wilson's first number one hit wasn't recorded

518
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:14,080
by the beach boys it was surf city by jan and dean and murray the abusive father was irate that

519
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:19,040
brian gave away their first number one hit to another group and he called jan barry a record

520
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:25,040
pirate a record pirate record pirate that's no yeah that's that's quite a slight you wouldn't

521
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:29,520
want to see any of those walking around islands of fear who is scarier brian wilson's father or the

522
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:36,960
leader who i don't know let's tell the audience decide what let's just square them off what do

523
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:43,520
we know about the leader uh he's got a big brain uh jason what help me out with the leader at a

524
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:51,120
false eye leader has his eyes okay let's see the leader is very intelligent the gamma radiation

525
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:56,400
made him super smart in the way that it made banner super strong he's very smart too he put

526
00:53:56,400 --> 00:54:02,000
out his own record the many moods of murray wilson and he loved to tell brian hey brian i'm a genius

527
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:07,600
too okay so they're pretty evenly matched so far this the leader looks like this he has a big head

528
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:15,040
yeah well that's scarier murray well but is it scarier that just a plain man like murray wilson

529
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:20,160
could be such an abusive monster that's you might know what's coming for you from the leader that's

530
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:26,080
true you know if we're talking about gamma radiation we should mention the storyline old man logan

531
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:31,040
similarly the villains won all the heroes except like hawkeye and wolverine are dead

532
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:38,000
for the most part um and there's a bunch of inbred hulks that control a part of the country right um

533
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:44,480
that storyline would go on to inspire the movie logan nominated for oscars that's true some

534
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:51,680
inbred hulk are they so are they dumber than yeah they're dumber and yeah i would probably

535
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:58,240
like old man logan i bet this sounds good it's fucking weird and gross yeah here's the one big

536
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:03,200
cover of it okay i don't see any inbred hulks on there no that's what i want to see they're kind

537
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:09,200
of in the corner they're these weird little guys in the corner oh i see are they little no it's just

538
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:14,160
an interpretation they're little well because that's a way that a hulk could be inbred is it

539
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:19,920
end up very small instead of very big uh it's a yeah it's it's fun it's got some shock humor

540
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:24,160
you might or shock uh violence as well okay i won't spoil it i mean you're not gonna

541
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:31,280
wolverine gets mind controlled by mysterio and accidentally kills all the x-men he thinks he's

542
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:35,600
killing like villains but then like the mind his mind like it's clear and he realizes he just

543
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:41,600
killed all the x-men wow and then he swore to like like never pop his claws again wow

544
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:48,960
and they kill you kill him for real yes in this story yeah it's else worlds and whatever what i

545
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:54,640
want i want permanence to these deaths mysterio also the big villain in kevin smith's daredevil

546
00:55:54,640 --> 00:56:00,320
arc from the right around this time period okay so there you go you're not going to the facts now

547
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:03,920
after you get hit with something like that well you have kevin smith no fun fun fun facts after

548
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:10,080
this i have had attention sorry if i spoiled that uh 20 plus year old uh story line for anyone 15

549
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:14,720
year old story at this point yeah i spoiled some of the story of the film love and mercy

550
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:22,560
uh well spoilers abound on club three uh but yeah there's other villains in the maze

551
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:28,240
and one of them i'm really excited about uh do you have the list of them here because i'm really

they've listed here they have uh uh just chainsaw henchmen vermin they have toad listed

559
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:22,960
okay zorn listed really yes wait no that can't be accurate that's what it says yeah okay that would

560
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:28,160
be accurate i guess so zorn has like been both good and bad he's been used the most during

561
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:35,360
grant morrison's uh new x-men yeah um and zorn again i think i've spoiler alerted zorn on this

562
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:41,920
podcast before but in case i haven't zorn is uh actually in that run he's raising a human kid and

563
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:48,960
he's a cartoon and sheryl hinds says no no problems with him uh uh zorn is magneto in disguise in

564
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:53,280
disguise the whole time oh so people don't know that i don't know that there was a reveal in this

565
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:59,840
maze but i'm a big fan of the zorn character and reveal that's a deep pull right this is why it's

566
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:05,040
exciting they did not have magneto they did not have kingpin right there's a list hold on

567
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:11,440
dr doom was right there yes um but then one was which makes it better because if you're a comic

568
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:16,720
book fan it's a creepy design kind of a weird design yeah he's got kind of a skull head um

569
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:26,160
yeah but yeah they had uh electro uh mephisto not mr mechphisto bono's character this is mephisto

570
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:30,400
the devil is a devil in marvel universe kind of walking around the scare zone too

571
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:36,720
walking around he was just walking around oh would you be more afraid of the marvel universe

572
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:45,040
devil or bono's mr mechphisto from the zoo tv i don't know i don't know enough about the other

573
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:50,480
i mean somebody with the ability to take over your tv feed because bono is the devil too they're both

574
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:55,920
the devil mr mechphisto is the devil if you're if you're if you hear fisto then you might be

575
00:58:55,920 --> 00:59:01,280
dealing with a barely disguised devil right it's not kit and it's not the door's character kit

576
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:07,600
fisto not the devil not the devil so not all the stows are devils not all fistos are devils um

577
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:15,600
this mephisto and mechphisto this uh wiki says the punisher was there oh yeah okay and also guy with

578
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:22,400
overalls with wearing overalls with a gun scary character that's a real world villain there's an

579
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:26,000
infinite amount of those the punisher i think i was watching one of the videos and they said the

580
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:33,040
punisher was like under some mind control so he was like firing at people with his gun uh they also

581
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:40,000
supposedly had i think they scrapped the idea that there would be snipers on the roofs of this uh and

582
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:44,800
but apparently in the maze there were laser pointers to make you feel like you were in sites

583
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:52,400
of characters which is very scary that's really scary uh so they were doing some intense things

584
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:58,240
i would say that they don't do i haven't seen them do that more psychologically scary a little bit

585
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:02,480
yeah there was a tunnel with like holes in it they do this trick still where you walk through

586
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:07,600
something that's like a like a cylinder that rotates yeah that looks cool that's very

587
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:13,920
unset that's like something from a corn video yes yes it is i don't even mean that's like an insult

588
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:17,680
the corn videos were very well done freak on a leash yeah where there's holes in the

589
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:25,120
yeah that but spinning yeah was the video was the jonathan davis video with the chris angel

590
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:31,440
uh vegas show was it as good as free connelly i don't think it was but it was still similar

591
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:37,440
i don't now i don't i this sounds vaguely familiar but you saw the original i know you've obviously

592
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:43,920
seen the new the new um chris angel show but did you see the one prior to that yeah i do look

593
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:48,880
i'm pretty a mystic of fog that's it's hard to keep when he's clearly topped the previous show

594
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:53,360
there is a i don't remember no jonathan davis i remember getting blasted with trash okay fair enough

595
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:58,320
but jonathan davis does do the music for mine his regular mind freak show and i think there is a

596
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:04,960
music video component uh as well but it's not yeah it's not on the level of the iconic freak

597
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:10,880
on the leash video so yes there is a freak on the leash style uh thing happening in this maximum

598
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:18,880
carnage maze cool um but i'll say this just from looking at the video the actual um like

599
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:26,560
location that you're being put placed into is not that specific in the house no that if i had a

600
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:33,600
punch up it would be that like give me some more marvel like iconography in the actual maze because

601
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:39,440
the maze just seems like it's a bunch of chain link fences and like walls and it i was watching

602
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:45,920
the special and i lost track of that this was the marvel one yes so that tells you it is so not

603
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:50,080
specific right so it never because this is we know this will never happen again there will never be a

604
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:56,080
scary marvel or at least not a fully murderous thing like this yeah um so if this was their

605
01:01:56,080 --> 01:02:01,280
chance it does not necessarily give you the full like herbal fun house it would have been awesome

606
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:05,680
i mean i know they couldn't have done this and kept putting like kept putting it back each night

607
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:11,600
but like if they had taken the cue of spider-man which is the daily bugle office like and fucked

608
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:16,480
that up and made that scary that'd be awesome i don't know like cletus i don't know do cletus

609
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:22,320
have a famous villains layer that i'm forgetting even just something that like they made up some

610
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:28,000
sort of industrial thing that like felt specific or like a villain's i don't know something specific

611
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:33,680
to him it well he just feels like some of these costumes are like kind of done generically and on

612
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:38,720
the cheap compared to like the caretaker or nightmare which were like very intensive

613
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:44,240
makeup and costuming right yes so like even just something that was a little bit less

614
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:52,080
fence based little like less fence wire fence based what's look in music videos uh from then

615
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:56,960
and ever since what is scarier than a chain link fence that's a good point you put it in front

616
01:02:56,960 --> 01:03:01,760
behind the performer and it's a little scary you put it in between the performer and the camera

617
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:06,800
it's true it's very unsettling very unsettling yeah so yeah i guess look there could have been

618
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:12,560
some fences but it didn't have to be all of them like it didn't have to be don't rely on fan if

619
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:17,440
they don't make fences your when you have scary villains at your disposal yeah so but maybe the

620
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:23,760
budget wasn't that high you know so i would say definitely the budget cheap yeah but it's a bummer

621
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:28,800
that it like that them doing this coincided with the budget maybe not being as high as it is now

622
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:36,240
for horror nights and for for uh marvel things we see great iterations of these costumes now that

623
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:42,640
disney is doing it yeah back in these days um the werewolf by night did you see what i'm talking

624
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:48,240
there's werewolf he's like on top of avengers uh i haven't seen whatever it is they did like a little

625
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:52,480
like patch of something up in top and there's like full moon and there's a guy dressed as a werewolf

626
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:57,920
and like he's howling and you're like yeah pretty good yeah like things are cool yes you want like

627
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:03,680
this little this little carriage of parades um i do want to know though like what level was the

628
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:10,880
person from marvel going like we're mad you can't do this again like well it's kind of like a vp or

629
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:16,240
a licensing person like because writers and editors wouldn't give a shit you know yeah they'd like this

630
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:20,800
probably yeah who knows and also this is very unofficial all these like halloween horror nights

631
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:28,080
things are not so officially they feel like in general the story seems to be marvel got mad you

632
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:34,320
can't show kids dead superheroes don't do this again but there's no real source on that no doubt

633
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:39,760
that happened but it's so vague but it didn't happen again and seuss i don't think they ever

634
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:45,520
did anything near halloween again yeah but they yeah it feels like the whole thing the whole

635
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:51,520
concept of this sort of went away pretty quickly so yeah it's weird because you would think they

636
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:56,400
would have had to like somebody a marvel would have known what they were doing yeah so that's

637
01:04:56,400 --> 01:05:00,160
it seems suspicious to me that it's as simple as just like you're going to scare the kids

638
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:05,280
versus marvel saying like it would make more sense to me where marvel said oh it's cool that you're

639
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:10,800
doing something at horror nights just let us approve what it is because like just doing villains

640
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:16,080
night at islands of adventure would be cool just say yeah this okay the difference is you can't

641
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:21,360
say the captain murk is dead you know what i mean like that's why that's that seems like a simple

642
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:27,760
explanation for why it didn't happen it took over but the heroes will return villains take over i

643
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:33,680
do think does that shit all the time yeah yes so i don't know it seems simplistic as far as a

644
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:38,640
reason maybe it's true but it feels like uh this is the reason somebody said no don't do this anymore

645
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:49,200
yeah so so they did keep doing stuff in this they still used it as a scare zone the next year but

646
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:58,400
the marvel affiliation was gone it then in 20 2003 it was known as toxic city and if we don't have

647
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:05,600
all these villains to use how do we fill the space and the answer was foam the aforementioned here we

648
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:11,920
go from shrieks and shrieks and foons became all right let's move that foam over here and the idea

649
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:18,960
is toxic city you are in a toxic city and this is toxic foam and some of it is green foam so aware of

650
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:26,160
the uh the green foam that's spewing everywhere it creepily says you've broken quarantine and

651
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:33,760
entered a city plunged into a biohazard nightmare uh i don't have to read all of this copy um it

652
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:38,000
says can you escape this biohazard nightmare or will the toxic avengers get to you first

653
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:44,560
but is it then is it the toxic no but it sounds so why are you the toxic avenger because that'd be

654
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:50,320
awesome yeah i said don't use the word avengers if you don't have that yeah copyright or yeah or the

655
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:58,240
toxic avenger which is a movie and a cartoon yeah great toys really detailed toys the playmates

656
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:02,480
there the playmates made them and they very much fit directly with the playmates turtles at the

657
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:08,000
time did you ever know that makes sense i remember it more as a toy thing yeah knowing what the actual

658
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:14,080
property was yeah me too that and bucky o'hare i remember the toys more than anything completely

659
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:20,160
the bucky o'hare gang could sit next to the turtles no problem yeah yeah they had a very hard to find

660
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:25,360
arcade cabinet every now and then we'd be on vacation i'd find the bucky o'hare cabinet

661
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:29,920
somewhere and i'd get so excited say well mom dad this is where i am for the next five days

662
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:35,360
this is where i am but you're like me i had the nintendo game i had all the comics and i had all

663
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:41,520
the toys and now i have the newer toys of turtles and i have a perfect layer oh bucky o'hare okay

664
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:48,320
i so uh you know they try to do something else here but they lost the moral thing i don't think

665
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:53,680
toxic nobody's telling us to do an episode about toxic city um so it didn't have the same the the

666
01:07:53,680 --> 01:08:00,000
boldness of killing beloved superheroes ironic because there are like a million toxic based

667
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:07,280
heroes and villains i feel like in marvel yeah but they don't want any part of it by now so when the

668
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:13,120
sun goes down you lose the license this would be disney's dream of how it could play out i think

669
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:20,400
they would bite on that it's okay we at night you get to have marvel at disney world great done can

670
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:26,880
do great works for me sure we'll buy we'll buy the rest out somehow they've been doing like at the

671
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:32,880
at the oogie boogie bash in disneyland they do little excuse me they do like a challenge trail

672
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:38,400
they turn it into like foggy thing with some villains i forget what it's called i feel like

673
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:43,840
there's not enough room for them to even do anything at disneyland right now no you like

674
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:51,280
a fun i was there the day an oogie boogie bash was starting and it's very funny how they can't

675
01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:56,160
tell you to get the fuck out but they're kind of telling you you have to leave right like we were

676
01:08:56,160 --> 01:09:03,760
eating an ice cream bar and next to the starbucks and they let jane go in for napkins but someone

677
01:09:03,760 --> 01:09:08,480
went in to try and buy coffee and they're like uh uh no you don't have you don't have a badge you

678
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:13,200
can't go in you know they got to do that yeah with every like horror nights in the regular park goers

679
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:19,920
too yeah i had two manhattans and i thought i could outsmart it but with no plan i was like here i know

680
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:27,840
let's just you me and the child let's just walk into the park confidently immediately oh badges

681
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:31,840
okay never mind bye oh so you weren't even in the park to begin with oh we were in the park we just

682
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:37,200
like like what if we try to stay i'm sure no one's ever thought of that before we took our time and

683
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:42,400
it was fun to hear the music change over it was fun to see some people had very good costumes

684
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:48,240
when we had left the grand california and people were already entering that entrance

685
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:55,280
grand california was packed tons of people were staying there and clearly going to this the the it

686
01:09:55,280 --> 01:10:04,880
was like a block long line from that hotel entrance to the park to the lobby there was people i would

687
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:09,840
this is just a side note this seems like it would be fun to go to but it never seems like there's

688
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:15,120
enough offerings like a horror nights for me to spend what is 150 bucks which is like a day ticket

689
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:19,520
well i just didn't think of it this year and then when i was there i was like this does look fun

690
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:25,040
i'm sure it's like it sells out in a day yeah you have to be at your computer it's so popular the

691
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:30,400
headless horseman runs down the street during the parade which is fun okay so it sounds like fun but

692
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:34,160
it always feels like it's not quite enough for me especially because usually i have an annual pass

693
01:10:34,160 --> 01:10:38,640
which i don't know going forward what that's going to look like because we're all so confused and

694
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:44,480
irritated by the changes i just got a new magic key magnet in the mail because i renewed behind

695
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:49,360
oh you did oh right right okay hell yeah man they really appreciate you it's blue now

696
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:57,920
it's blue and the mailing was addressed to magic key holder so no more names no more names

697
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:02,800
did i say immediately having the child that lindsay has gone from her stance of like we're waiting

698
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:08,000
till the baby is two before we go to disneyland too we should take the baby soon right

699
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:15,520
jason keeps saying the baby's free which is really what the attractive part of it is

700
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:22,080
no we're not doing it imminently but at least she's a little flexible on the on the time table

701
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:27,200
try anything crazy like trying to get a lunch reservation because you're fucked in that respect

702
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:33,680
sure uh so anyway yeah disney we should do one of these parties one of these days but

703
01:11:33,680 --> 01:11:38,880
it just feels like you're there all the time it's like am i gonna go and pay more money it doesn't

704
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:43,840
if it was like eight mazes i've said this before where disney if they did like elaborate disney

705
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:50,800
mazes that they erected only for halloween season then okay maybe but it just you're like is it

706
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:57,520
enough to justify in my mind i'll say this the vibe was good i'm sure it was jack to be there

707
01:11:57,520 --> 01:12:03,440
sure that's the case the vibe at the 80s night was great yeah people are so excited to be there

708
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:08,640
for a themed event and when like when the ambiance is a little different people get

709
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:13,520
excited like when you go they're playing pop music on main street it was a very suggestive excited

710
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:19,520
there was a little eyebrow raise there was that seemed like foam party maybe maybe i was a little

711
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:26,480
excited at the 80s night i saw micky in his tracksuit from uh the mouser size and i got excited

712
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:30,960
that's why when i was dancing we got a film filming singlet totally mini that night

713
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:36,480
so maybe that's what is what i'm talking about i i um memory came back a friend of mine from high

714
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:42,160
school went down to disney and universal around halloween and they went to horror nights

715
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:50,720
and you know again it was not as built up as it is now but uh there were like margarita stands

716
01:12:50,720 --> 01:12:56,800
like every 20 feet and the only distinction between alcoholic and non-alcoholic was like

717
01:12:57,360 --> 01:13:04,400
either the cup or or a parasol in it or something so our parents just kept buying

718
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:11,120
her the alcoholic ones and doing the thing to the cup and she was just like yeah i was just

719
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:14,720
going into haunted houses and we were all hammered by some point

720
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:23,360
well you can you can get hammered at disney at ogee boogie bash yeah and meet they card a lot

721
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:28,560
more aggressively nowadays that's true yeah this is having done a lot of these podcasts like

722
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:34,320
bodiness hammered is one of those listeners do a drinking game with mike and jason with the word

723
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:40,160
hammered i do you guys are you guys aware of the amount of i think a 16 17 year old has much of a

724
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:45,280
tolerance you know i think even team part i'm just saying you use the hammered becomes the word i

725
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:49,600
think of it a lot because you know what always comes up is that irish bar that's next to despicable

726
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:54,320
me that i say and it's always like you get because you go there and get hammered i you get you get

727
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:59,760
hammered there's a big wind up always i like the fray i like hammered i mean is it just a fun

728
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:06,000
yeah it's like thors hammer i just see people who can barely stand it's how tides walk around that

729
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:10,240
upper lot coming from that bar yeah what would you say your go-to word to mean that is

730
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:14,560
oh i have to no i think i say a few too many

731
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:24,320
well we can go to that we made me feel like a trick and a fool we can start saying it like that

732
01:14:26,160 --> 01:14:32,160
so i this one i'm not gonna i like saying hammered and i will still say this is just listen for it in

733
01:14:32,160 --> 01:14:36,400
past episodes and in the future now that i've made it a thing you listeners play a drinking

734
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:42,720
game with it and you yourselves will get hammered hammered you will get hammered hammered it's always

735
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:47,280
it's the bit the h gets a lot of hang time i'm trying to think of it a good other way i would

736
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:53,520
like to say it uh i'm trying to think there's a move john c reilly says getting drunk in a funny

737
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:58,080
way and i'm trying to remember how he says it i got something whatever okay it'll come to me

738
01:14:58,080 --> 01:15:01,680
there's another way i like to say it but it's not hammered so maybe i'll replace it with with this

739
01:15:01,680 --> 01:15:05,680
thing i can't think look that one up and then you'll straight uh um is there anything else about

740
01:15:05,680 --> 01:15:11,360
i'm worried he says it's in it's in ricky pittson tell it good night he sees uh they're improving at

741
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:15,760
the table with it when they're saying he's saying he's improv in that movie yeah believe it or not

742
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:21,680
they have do some riffs he says he's in the front row of a lennard skinner concert and he says i'm

743
01:15:21,680 --> 01:15:26,560
hammered drunk it is hammered yeah it's hammered it might have been the birth of the maybe the love

744
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:33,680
burrowed into our brains yeah uh the only other thing just there's so many easy things to do like

745
01:15:33,680 --> 01:15:39,360
if they did a maze with doom like as doom's embassy which is the queue for oh yeah the like

746
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:44,160
why not a great villain there doom embassy like or something carnage it seems like as it was

747
01:15:44,160 --> 01:15:48,640
developed it kept it was going to be in the extended queue for storm accelerator storm force

748
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:53,520
accelerator and then i think they just built a warehouse because they're like oh we'll keep

749
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:57,520
using this it's called the carnage warehouse and i believe now it's being used for storage

750
01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:03,040
yeah so put in the carnage warehouse so people yeah carnage warehouse and it's just yeah there's

751
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:09,040
a lot of chain link fence in there and uh some like uh uh drink cups that we're gonna need when

752
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:15,120
we run out cylinder with a bunch of holes in it we just spin it around i wonder cylinder i wonder

753
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:20,320
if it's a pain in the ass to run horror nights at two parks spread out over two parks i mean i'm sure

754
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:26,000
yeah logistically because i i am surprised as it gets bigger and bigger it hasn't gone back to both

755
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:32,400
parks yeah i don't know i don't because it's sold out every night so i don't know if they yeah i

756
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:37,840
don't know maybe it's just easier to stay at one yeah i don't know good question for what's his

757
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:44,640
name murdy john murdy oh yeah maybe you talk jason talked to him once yeah i think he's mostly out

758
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:49,440
here though sure but he might know he may know yeah may know don't make me get the list

759
01:16:50,240 --> 01:16:57,040
um

760
01:16:57,040 --> 01:17:02,960
i guess i did establish rules of when the list comes out yeah uh um okay uh a little quick thing

761
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:09,120
we forgot one thing about the about horror nights 2002 and we've talked about a lot of things in this

762
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:17,040
episode we have talked about uh unorthodox villain team up super team ups we've talked about uh

763
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:21,200
intellectual property being done a little sloppily maybe the costumes not being the best

764
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:26,480
and we have not mentioned the ultimate iteration of all the things i just said and that is the

765
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:33,120
bill and ted halloween show oh right very well might have talked about this specific one when

766
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:38,320
we did an episode about that with uh with brad and nick years ago uh but just in case just to like

767
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:44,160
set the cultural scene that island under siege chill came out chill yeah fall of 2002 cool

768
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:51,440
progressive yeah yeah yeah great attitudes towards sexuality uh um so the well the big

769
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:56,480
things this year uh hey well see if you can guess them honestly if there's a 2002 do you have any

770
01:17:56,480 --> 01:18:04,240
that's a good thought what's big what is the big pop culture in 2002 and i'll i'll save you uh i

771
01:18:04,240 --> 01:18:10,160
it's not what i said before barry egan from punch trunk love does not appear it's not the mattress

772
01:18:10,160 --> 01:18:15,040
man does not oh why didn't they say oh the mattress man is that car manage that oh yeah

773
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:22,080
uh is it the war on terror yeah i was gonna go war on terror as well they get all the guys in

774
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:27,600
rumsfeld yeah is that it colin fell the playing cards haven't happened yet iraq hasn't been

775
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:36,160
invaded yet but they're still trying osama bin haydn oh yeah yeah um no amazingly none of that

776
01:18:36,160 --> 01:18:44,160
is referred it's uh why of course it's uh uh well dr evil and but dr evil takes on uh the most

777
01:18:44,160 --> 01:18:52,080
sinister henchman that he could which is serlina from men in black two what yeah you know oh yeah

778
01:18:52,080 --> 01:19:02,880
is that larvalyn boil yes the lingerie uh model who gets taken over um so then all right agent j

779
01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:10,400
comes out to battle dr evil and serlina but mini me fights out and jumps out and fights agent j

780
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:14,480
and by the way just hearing about agent j you're like oh bill and ted why can you not

781
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:22,800
be here to have now certain characters in 2022 say keep my wife's name out your fucking mouth

782
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:34,320
say that to um i uh try guy ned probably that's right yes the team up of uh will smith and try

783
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:39,840
guy med yeah yeah wait how does it work because he's well he's well will smith is a is an ardent

784
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:47,440
defender of marriage and try guy ned fucked up and broke the marital vows right in a way that

785
01:19:47,440 --> 01:19:53,760
the try guys seem to feel has never right occurred in history before so they'd be at odds right yes

786
01:19:53,760 --> 01:20:00,000
so they would yes that would team up and then maybe it's keep your wife's name out your fucking

787
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:06,240
mouth when he tries to apologize but the apology is not because he's dreaming of the food baby

788
01:20:06,240 --> 01:20:12,080
so will smith has to remind him what matters so will smith is the hero i think doing the slap

789
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:15,920
right that's that's good i think you know you maybe put too much thought into it because it

790
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:22,800
might just be like then like dr phil comes out and interrupts them yes probably still in 2022

791
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:29,200
2022 right dr phil comes out because my temptation was is it dr oz because he's topical but i think

792
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:34,880
mike's right i think it is dr phil because someone on the staff who someone who's there can do a

793
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:39,120
doctor phil yeah yeah dr oz how do you do that he's just like a weasel then you would just have a big

794
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:44,880
inflatable because john federman is a massive man he's a tall tall guy this is two of the weasels

795
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:50,240
but if you could just have a giant inflatable like foot come down and like step up like the

796
01:20:50,240 --> 01:20:57,120
monty python foot on dr oz oh no john federman john federman but if it was florida then like

797
01:20:57,120 --> 01:21:01,200
oz pushes up on federman's boot and he raises up the boot and he wins

798
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:09,440
dr oz beats everyone cheers you sure well well then they would have to get desantis

799
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:15,200
yeah that's true yeah yeah probably desantis like he's in the show for real he says he shows

800
01:21:15,200 --> 01:21:20,880
every night he actually shows up in the white boots that's what he wants in the dallas cowboy boots

801
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:26,720
and tell us cowboy shearley are boots that he's wearing he goes up to dr fauci and says keep the

802
01:21:26,720 --> 01:21:34,320
word lockdown out your fucking mouth right crowd cheers slaps the actor for real even though they

803
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:40,320
talked backstage please mr desantis uh-huh this sound won't even be audible they're gonna put in

804
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:45,760
a sound effect but he's too tough of a guy yeah i'm too tough i talk like this and i'm like yeah

805
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:51,440
i'm a very tough man and he gets the slap and then the whole crowd goes wild they're spilling their

806
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:58,080
mikulov ultra can bottles everywhere you know some illegal immigrants try to sneak into the show and

807
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:08,560
give some a free trip to martha's vineyard in the phone booth oh yes oh wow and villain ted go cool

808
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:19,120
not in the show very much so far i i thought they i thought drag i neck would trying to be like

809
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:25,440
hide me bill and ted and they're like no way man you're gross yeah look we've done a lot of

810
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:31,120
bad stuff and we've said some bad slurs about gay people but there's one thing we won't stand for

811
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:37,040
which is your affair try guy nid and then the audience takes like a couple like a minute of

812
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:44,720
like contemplative silence then actors playing the try guys respectfully not like those lunatics on

813
01:22:44,720 --> 01:22:50,480
saturday night live actors respectfully come out and reenact the apology video but with no jokes

814
01:22:50,640 --> 01:22:56,080
oh this is not a laughing matter oh i just okay that kind of negates my pitch which

815
01:22:58,480 --> 01:23:02,080
the couch is actually in a big toilet and they all get flushed out of the toilet

816
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:09,520
i think all the show should end like that oh yeah they could bring it back and it's just everyone

817
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:14,880
getting flushed down a big toilet like every character epic universe i'm billy eichner i'm

818
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:21,440
mad about the movie people didn't come out flush down he goes where are the cast of amsterdam

819
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:26,480
biden falls up the stairs that flush

820
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:34,480
anyone yeah anyone who's in the news gets flushed this will be an epic universe they're building a

821
01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:39,520
big toilet for epic universe for this new bill and ted show to skewer the center of the park

822
01:23:39,680 --> 01:23:44,720
that's their their castle that's their center of the park anything topical that's happening

823
01:23:44,720 --> 01:23:50,880
will be flushed we see a coca cola dream world what epic universe is like we're bringing back

824
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:56,640
villain ted every night in the middle of the esplanade might be i don't know we don't know

825
01:23:56,640 --> 01:24:01,200
that could be the biggest weirdly that could be that's the end one more thing there's been

826
01:24:01,200 --> 01:24:04,960
yeah there's been no leak about that there's a lot of leaks about other rides but we don't know

827
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:10,720
yeah uh well get billed in that big toilet yeah and by the i think also i think they could always

828
01:24:10,720 --> 01:24:18,160
end with how they ended 2002 which is darth vader and gandalf fight and gandalf comes out victorious

829
01:24:18,160 --> 01:24:21,120
darth vader reveals that he is actually martha stewart

830
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:32,000
that's what snl needs to learn from that's that's funny yeah that's back when comedy used to be

831
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:38,880
funny then yeah i don't know they just now they don't have their facts straight add the flush and

832
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:46,320
i'm laughing that's all i say add the flush kind of ever well look you're editing this so feel

833
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:51,680
free to put in as many flushes as you want uh but that's just if you have time otherwise you

834
01:24:51,680 --> 01:24:58,880
survived haunt cast the fright oh i don't know all right it's been a little time does club freak or
