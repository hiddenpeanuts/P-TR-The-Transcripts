00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:05,360
Five, four, three, two, one.

00:00:21,292 --> 00:00:23,312
Podcast The Ride, The Second Gate.

3
00:00:23,652 --> 00:00:25,152
My name is Mike Carlson.

4
00:00:25,292 --> 00:00:27,292
Joining me as always, Jason Sheridan.

5
00:00:27,332 --> 00:00:27,672
Hi.

6
00:00:27,952 --> 00:00:28,832
And Scott Gairdner.

7
00:00:28,992 --> 00:00:29,332
Hello.

8
00:00:29,572 --> 00:00:31,372
One of the big ones, we're hitting one of the big ones.

9
00:00:31,632 --> 00:00:32,792
One of the big ones.

10
00:00:33,172 --> 00:00:35,712
One that I was not too familiar with today.

11
00:00:37,152 --> 00:00:42,912
It was 1998, Disney's Hollywood Studios.

12
00:00:43,132 --> 00:00:44,532
Then Disney's MGM Studios.

13
00:00:44,532 --> 00:00:45,332
Yeah, you're right, sorry.

14
00:00:45,652 --> 00:00:45,732
Yeah.

15
00:00:45,732 --> 00:00:46,652
Oh, it was still, okay.

16
00:00:46,812 --> 00:00:49,372
I can never keep track of when those changes happened.

17
00:00:50,092 --> 00:00:52,172
2000s, they changed to Hollywood Studios.

18
00:00:52,252 --> 00:00:52,892
Was it that late?

19
00:00:52,892 --> 00:00:55,012
Later 2000, or mid 2000s, yeah.

20
00:00:55,632 --> 00:00:57,492
And that's when they had to get rid of the hat,

21
00:00:57,512 --> 00:00:59,832
or they had to put the hat, or they left the hat on.

22
00:00:59,832 --> 00:01:01,552
I don't know what the deal with the hat is.

23
00:01:01,732 --> 00:01:02,832
I mean, we're gonna have to do with the hat.

24
00:01:02,832 --> 00:01:04,992
The deal with the hat is it's bad, I hate the hat.

25
00:01:05,012 --> 00:01:05,952
It's bad, yeah.

26
00:01:05,952 --> 00:01:07,632
And it's gone, but they had like a problem

27
00:01:07,632 --> 00:01:10,692
with the rights to use the Chinese theater

28
00:01:10,692 --> 00:01:12,032
as the icon of the park.

29
00:01:12,052 --> 00:01:15,032
Which was separate from using a lot of the MGM properties.

30
00:01:15,032 --> 00:01:16,752
So as long as they blocked the view.

31
00:01:16,932 --> 00:01:18,332
Right, it could still be there.

32
00:01:18,332 --> 00:01:20,132
It's just the view of it was the issue.

33
00:01:20,132 --> 00:01:21,332
That's my understanding of it.

34
00:01:21,332 --> 00:01:22,692
I could be completely wrong.

35
00:01:22,692 --> 00:01:25,112
Yeah, I don't know how much of it is apocryphal.

36
00:01:25,172 --> 00:01:27,692
Yeah, we'll have to do an episode about that fucking hat.

37
00:01:28,052 --> 00:01:30,052
Well the point is, this is sort of an,

38
00:01:30,212 --> 00:01:33,232
this is an awkward era for that park at this point,

39
00:01:33,372 --> 00:01:34,692
Disney, MGM Studios.

40
00:01:35,192 --> 00:01:37,632
And today's attraction is definitely part of it.

41
00:01:37,692 --> 00:01:39,352
Soundstage with Steven Weber.

42
00:01:39,592 --> 00:01:40,472
Yes. Yeah.

43
00:01:40,612 --> 00:01:44,112
Which is to me, like, I have only the vegas recollection

44
00:01:44,112 --> 00:01:45,192
of this, but to me it was like,

45
00:01:45,192 --> 00:01:48,652
it's like part of that transitional era

46
00:01:48,652 --> 00:01:53,232
where the audience is no longer giving a shit

47
00:01:53,232 --> 00:01:55,212
about how movies are made.

48
00:01:55,212 --> 00:01:58,552
But they know that they have to start getting rid

49
00:01:58,552 --> 00:02:01,512
of the original attractions about how movies are made.

50
00:02:01,952 --> 00:02:03,332
Right. So we're seeing the original

51
00:02:03,332 --> 00:02:05,112
Universal stuff go.

52
00:02:05,152 --> 00:02:06,252
Yeah. Or like here in Hollywood,

53
00:02:06,552 --> 00:02:09,252
like Backdraft is seeming really out of date

54
00:02:09,252 --> 00:02:10,192
and they're trying to slide,

55
00:02:10,292 --> 00:02:12,532
let's put the mummy into that thing where you go,

56
00:02:12,972 --> 00:02:15,712
you know, through the stages instead of Back to the Future,

57
00:02:15,732 --> 00:02:18,032
like those little demonstration stages or whatever.

58
00:02:19,012 --> 00:02:22,392
They get rid of earthquake and turn it into that disaster

59
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:25,112
thing in Florida with Christopher Walken.

60
00:02:25,252 --> 00:02:27,052
Yeah, they're trying to make everything more active

61
00:02:27,052 --> 00:02:29,472
as opposed to, cause like Universal was,

62
00:02:29,652 --> 00:02:33,292
all those initial things were like kind of passive experience.

63
00:02:33,392 --> 00:02:35,192
It's like, not passive completely,

64
00:02:35,192 --> 00:02:37,772
but it's like really taking you out of reality

65
00:02:37,772 --> 00:02:39,352
and you want to show how the movies are made.

66
00:02:39,352 --> 00:02:40,992
But they're all educational too.

67
00:02:40,992 --> 00:02:42,312
A little too educational.

68
00:02:42,692 --> 00:02:46,552
And like referring to a different type of movie.

69
00:02:46,632 --> 00:02:48,112
Like there's a world of difference between,

70
00:02:48,112 --> 00:02:51,592
you know, early nineties movies and late nineties movies.

71
00:02:51,712 --> 00:02:54,752
So they're trying to make things sort of poppier

72
00:02:54,752 --> 00:02:57,872
and bring, you know, fresher talent.

73
00:02:58,012 --> 00:02:59,612
I like it was our, okay, so there's this attraction

74
00:02:59,612 --> 00:03:02,252
with Chevy Chase and Martin Short.

75
00:03:02,652 --> 00:03:04,652
And you know, they've never stopped being relevant,

76
00:03:04,652 --> 00:03:06,012
but still it's weird you're watching

77
00:03:06,012 --> 00:03:07,232
a Chevy Chase movie get made.

78
00:03:07,272 --> 00:03:08,452
So I guess they're like, we need to start getting

79
00:03:08,452 --> 00:03:10,572
some newer people into the park.

80
00:03:10,572 --> 00:03:12,452
So like Drew Carey, right?

81
00:03:12,532 --> 00:03:14,212
This weird sounds dangerous.

82
00:03:14,212 --> 00:03:16,012
Sounds dangerous with Drew Carey,

83
00:03:16,072 --> 00:03:20,612
this very dreadfully dull, like audio demonstration

84
00:03:20,612 --> 00:03:22,492
with Drew Carey who's hot at the time.

85
00:03:22,852 --> 00:03:25,732
And then elsewhere we end up with Steven Weber.

86
00:03:25,932 --> 00:03:28,252
Which is interesting cause Drew Carey at least,

87
00:03:28,372 --> 00:03:31,052
like the ABC merger at Disney had bought ABC.

88
00:03:31,172 --> 00:03:33,512
Drew Carey show, big hit for ABC.

89
00:03:33,592 --> 00:03:38,332
And I think was a few seasons in when Sounds Dangerous opened.

90
00:03:39,032 --> 00:03:39,432
But.

91
00:03:39,832 --> 00:03:41,472
A big part, a big feather in their cap.

92
00:03:41,912 --> 00:03:45,672
Yeah, and before that, like Disney starting to do more,

93
00:03:45,672 --> 00:03:48,092
Disney did used to have more stuff on NBC.

94
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:51,972
Steven Weber, 98 would have been like coming off of Wings,

95
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,852
which was a hit, but not like a monster hit.

96
00:03:55,052 --> 00:03:56,652
But he was in the family, right?

97
00:03:56,652 --> 00:03:58,132
He was in the Disney family.

98
00:03:58,372 --> 00:04:00,532
He had done, well, yeah, so I was looking at it,

99
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:01,732
I was trying to figure out why.

100
00:04:02,612 --> 00:04:04,372
Okay, so he is a, this was weird.

101
00:04:04,412 --> 00:04:07,312
He was a voice on the show, The Legend of Tarzan,

102
00:04:07,312 --> 00:04:09,172
which was an animated Tarzan show.

103
00:04:09,172 --> 00:04:12,512
In which he plays Edgar Rice Burroughs.

104
00:04:12,612 --> 00:04:16,152
Apparently the author of Tarzan shows up

105
00:04:16,152 --> 00:04:18,372
in the world of Tarzan.

106
00:04:19,012 --> 00:04:21,992
And he sort of played like you don't know who this is

107
00:04:21,992 --> 00:04:23,572
and there's a reveal at the end.

108
00:04:23,932 --> 00:04:24,512
It's the creator.

109
00:04:24,532 --> 00:04:25,612
Which children would love.

110
00:04:26,052 --> 00:04:27,192
Oh yeah. Children would love.

111
00:04:27,192 --> 00:04:29,052
Was there a, very familiar with classic authors.

112
00:04:29,072 --> 00:04:30,732
Very familiar with the author itself.

113
00:04:30,852 --> 00:04:32,312
Was there a sequel to like Hunchback

114
00:04:32,312 --> 00:04:34,032
where Victor Hugo was a character?

115
00:04:34,512 --> 00:04:36,312
Like, what was this, a constant thing happening?

116
00:04:36,312 --> 00:04:38,332
Well, that's actually the post credit sequence

117
00:04:38,332 --> 00:04:41,652
on Hunchback 2, the directed video one.

118
00:04:42,092 --> 00:04:44,612
It's Victor Hugo just witnessing all this stuff

119
00:04:44,612 --> 00:04:49,872
and going like, huh, this might make an interesting story.

120
00:04:51,372 --> 00:04:54,292
Crazy times in my town of Paris lately.

121
00:04:55,052 --> 00:04:56,472
Maybe I'll write it all down.

122
00:04:56,472 --> 00:04:56,952
Yeah.

123
00:04:57,472 --> 00:04:59,172
In Lion King one and a half,

124
00:04:59,312 --> 00:05:02,632
I think the creator of the anime

125
00:05:02,632 --> 00:05:05,292
that the Lion King ripped off shows up.

126
00:05:05,432 --> 00:05:05,572
Right.

127
00:05:06,312 --> 00:05:08,252
This looks awfully familiar.

128
00:05:09,752 --> 00:05:11,132
Should Lion King rip off an anime?

129
00:05:11,452 --> 00:05:12,312
Yeah. Do you know all that?

130
00:05:12,592 --> 00:05:13,952
I forget that. Oh, I didn't know that.

131
00:05:14,092 --> 00:05:16,952
It's why in the Simpsons joke

132
00:05:16,952 --> 00:05:20,092
when there's a Mufasa type character in the sky

133
00:05:20,092 --> 00:05:23,552
next to Bleeding Gums Mervy that he says.

134
00:05:24,052 --> 00:05:24,892
Kimba. Yeah.

135
00:05:25,092 --> 00:05:27,072
You have to avenge my death, Kimba.

136
00:05:27,332 --> 00:05:28,352
I mean Simba.

137
00:05:28,472 --> 00:05:33,072
I know Kimba or I know the, yeah, I kind of know that.

138
00:05:33,132 --> 00:05:34,492
I didn't even think about that.

139
00:05:34,492 --> 00:05:36,132
I always just think of the Hamlet

140
00:05:36,132 --> 00:05:38,732
because there's so many parallels to the story of Hamlet.

141
00:05:38,732 --> 00:05:39,752
It's also that.

142
00:05:40,112 --> 00:05:41,332
Yeah. Interesting.

143
00:05:42,392 --> 00:05:45,732
Anyway, so he's in the Stars and Cartoon.

144
00:05:45,952 --> 00:05:50,452
What I forgot is that he was in the ABC fan.

145
00:05:50,452 --> 00:05:53,552
He was heading for a show called Once and Again,

146
00:05:53,732 --> 00:05:54,932
which ran for a couple of years.

147
00:05:54,952 --> 00:05:57,272
That premiered in September 99.

148
00:05:57,332 --> 00:05:58,892
So that's like a year out.

149
00:05:59,472 --> 00:06:01,712
So maybe he had like a development,

150
00:06:01,712 --> 00:06:05,392
maybe he was like under Disney contract at that point.

151
00:06:05,412 --> 00:06:07,292
And they're probably like with Superstar limo,

152
00:06:07,312 --> 00:06:11,112
like trying to get people around who are like, you know, cheap.

153
00:06:11,312 --> 00:06:13,812
They're not like you were like getting the

154
00:06:13,812 --> 00:06:18,152
having to get Robin Williams or somebody to sign a contract to be shown in the

155
00:06:18,152 --> 00:06:20,012
play, like it's somebody they're already doing business with.

156
00:06:20,252 --> 00:06:22,232
Hey, can you do a day on this attraction?

157
00:06:22,432 --> 00:06:26,832
Yeah. And I had an experience with that, like as a kid,

158
00:06:26,912 --> 00:06:32,292
like I was one of my weird kid things was I liked Steven Weber a lot

159
00:06:32,292 --> 00:06:36,312
and I liked Wings a lot because USA Network,

160
00:06:36,392 --> 00:06:42,052
USA Network had this promotion for a while called Primetime in the A.M.

161
00:06:42,432 --> 00:06:45,492
And they would show like from like eight to 10 a.m.

162
00:06:45,492 --> 00:06:48,952
They would show in syndication was specifically.

163
00:06:48,972 --> 00:06:52,172
I remember Wings and Ned and Stacey,

164
00:06:52,292 --> 00:06:56,212
which is the sitcom that Thomas Hayden Church left Wings to go do.

165
00:06:56,212 --> 00:06:58,912
That was him and never finish out wings.

166
00:06:58,912 --> 00:07:00,652
He didn't finish out wings. No.

167
00:07:00,892 --> 00:07:03,672
And it was different missing in a different pair title show,

168
00:07:03,732 --> 00:07:05,192
a different pair title show.

169
00:07:05,252 --> 00:07:08,872
And it did run for like two or three seasons.

170
00:07:09,092 --> 00:07:12,892
Like researching this, I realized like so many shows like

171
00:07:12,892 --> 00:07:17,932
Single Guy or Boston Common did get like two seasons or so.

172
00:07:18,112 --> 00:07:20,152
Boston Common was in Primetime in the A.M.

173
00:07:20,372 --> 00:07:23,592
But they weren't showing syndicated friends or syndicated Seinfeld.

174
00:07:23,592 --> 00:07:27,692
They were showing the other NBC shows that were cheaper, probably, to get the rights.

175
00:07:27,712 --> 00:07:31,212
Sure. And I'm trying to get you accustomed to you like these as well.

176
00:07:31,252 --> 00:07:35,252
Right. Yeah. With many viewings, you will start to like Caroline in the city. Sure.

177
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:40,232
And I mean, Wings did have Tony Shalhoub, Steven Weber, Thomas Hayden Church.

178
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:42,472
Like a very decent guys.

179
00:07:42,772 --> 00:07:47,312
Thomas Hayden Church and Steven Weber are very similar guys to me.

180
00:07:47,312 --> 00:07:49,992
I think they look similar. I think I got when I

181
00:07:49,992 --> 00:07:53,392
I think when I was picturing this attraction, I thought maybe it was Thomas Hayden Church.

182
00:07:53,592 --> 00:07:58,752
Oh, maybe I think of him as having such a distinctive like cadence and delivery.

183
00:07:59,192 --> 00:08:01,872
I think of Weber much more affable, I feel like.

184
00:08:01,932 --> 00:08:04,692
Well, but not on Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip.

185
00:08:04,892 --> 00:08:06,092
That was another thing.

186
00:08:06,732 --> 00:08:08,512
He's menacing executive Jack Rudolph.

187
00:08:08,792 --> 00:08:13,072
That's fair. Whoa. Steven Weber from Wings is on a new NBC show.

188
00:08:13,372 --> 00:08:16,812
It's about behind the scenes of comedy from the creator of the West Wing.

189
00:08:17,012 --> 00:08:19,152
Sign me up. And Bradley Whitford.

190
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,592
And Bradley Whitford. You love Rob Cordray.

191
00:08:21,632 --> 00:08:22,732
You're going to love his brother.

192
00:08:22,812 --> 00:08:29,072
I got to say, I spent I worked so hard trying to get an internship on Studio 60

193
00:08:29,072 --> 00:08:31,492
because I was out here doing a semester in college.

194
00:08:32,252 --> 00:08:36,512
And did you on the actual show itself or the show about the show Warner Brothers?

195
00:08:36,612 --> 00:08:38,832
I was living at the apartment up the road.

196
00:08:38,892 --> 00:08:41,292
You just thought it was real and you wanted to be part of it.

197
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:46,192
No. Well, I mean, I wish I could study under the tutelage of Matt Albee and Danny Tripp.

198
00:08:46,432 --> 00:08:52,092
But I just want to polish the microphone where the announcer says live from the sunsets.

199
00:08:52,092 --> 00:08:54,432
Wait, it's like a much more convoluted life.

200
00:08:54,532 --> 00:08:58,332
Yeah. Live from Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip.

201
00:08:58,472 --> 00:09:00,992
Live from Studio. Live from the Sunset Strip.

202
00:09:01,092 --> 00:09:04,752
Now is the time for Studio 60 live.

203
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:07,072
Get ready. I think it was that.

204
00:09:08,072 --> 00:09:10,812
But so they were shooting at Warner Brothers and no one could be.

205
00:09:10,872 --> 00:09:12,872
Other people tried. No one could get an internship.

206
00:09:13,192 --> 00:09:14,932
And one person got an internship.

207
00:09:14,932 --> 00:09:19,912
And it turned out that it was because she was like her mom was Bradley

208
00:09:19,912 --> 00:09:21,832
Whitford's cousin or something.

209
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:24,372
And that's how she got in there.

210
00:09:24,372 --> 00:09:27,752
This was the Lori Loughlin scenario of its day.

211
00:09:27,912 --> 00:09:30,432
Yeah. You know, and then we were all a fool.

212
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:35,232
Like then when midseason when 30 Rock came on, we're like, well, this is infinitely better.

213
00:09:35,252 --> 00:09:36,752
Like this is it was funny.

214
00:09:36,912 --> 00:09:41,172
Yeah. The two. And then you thought like, how can this stupid one survive?

215
00:09:41,172 --> 00:09:43,592
And it did by leaps and bounds.

216
00:09:43,592 --> 00:09:44,232
It blew it out of the water.

217
00:09:44,232 --> 00:09:47,952
By the way, Felicity Huffman hosted Studio 60 within the world.

218
00:09:48,032 --> 00:09:49,572
She definitely. Yeah.

219
00:09:50,112 --> 00:09:55,332
Because and like maybe in the pilot, like I feel like Judd is it Judd Hirsch?

220
00:09:55,532 --> 00:09:57,072
Is the guy who's the guy who cracks up?

221
00:09:57,372 --> 00:10:01,272
Oh, she the host. I think she's the hood of the one that implodes.

222
00:10:01,432 --> 00:10:02,532
Is that what the events?

223
00:10:02,752 --> 00:10:07,272
Because I think he says, Felicity, I'm sorry, you're doing a great job.

224
00:10:08,372 --> 00:10:09,972
Like, I'm having a rough.

225
00:10:10,152 --> 00:10:13,712
Just go get a cup of tea and everything's going to be OK.

226
00:10:13,792 --> 00:10:17,072
OK, one which as the famous meltdown,

227
00:10:17,212 --> 00:10:21,952
that feels like a nod to television for the Sorkin heads, where it's like,

228
00:10:22,072 --> 00:10:27,592
well, Dana from Sports Night is hosting in studio actresses hosted Studio 60.

229
00:10:27,692 --> 00:10:31,452
Again, use people keeping the family together.

230
00:10:31,592 --> 00:10:32,972
Yeah, keeping the company.

231
00:10:33,212 --> 00:10:36,652
He's, you know, theatrical, you know, keeping the company together.

232
00:10:36,732 --> 00:10:39,612
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. He's got his his rep players.

233
00:10:39,612 --> 00:10:43,392
Yeah. The author of the play, the Farnsworth invention, Aaron Sorkin.

234
00:10:43,592 --> 00:10:46,572
You have to. That's an interesting like how much Sorkin Disney

235
00:10:47,992 --> 00:10:50,472
park crossover there. I feel like there are a few.

236
00:10:50,592 --> 00:10:51,592
Oh, yeah. Interesting.

237
00:10:52,272 --> 00:10:56,052
I mean, this this is a big one within that, at least.

238
00:10:56,692 --> 00:11:00,132
I mean, OK, we haven't said like, what is the thing with this show?

239
00:11:00,152 --> 00:11:02,692
Like I said, it's sort of in that world of like it's it's behind it.

240
00:11:02,792 --> 00:11:06,392
They're trying to do fresher behind the scenes takes

241
00:11:06,392 --> 00:11:10,472
and that are utilizing, you know, kind of kind of flashier effects.

242
00:11:10,512 --> 00:11:12,292
And it's mainly I guess, how would you describe it?

243
00:11:12,372 --> 00:11:16,692
That he like Stephen Webber is your host as you go

244
00:11:17,732 --> 00:11:21,332
inside a working Hollywood sound stage and learn about

245
00:11:21,332 --> 00:11:25,792
all of the parts of it until something goes around.

246
00:11:26,072 --> 00:11:28,932
Yeah, I think that's pretty right. Park premise.

247
00:11:29,172 --> 00:11:32,312
It's a lot. It's a little bit of superstar television.

248
00:11:32,472 --> 00:11:36,152
It's a little bit of earthquake and tornado and twister.

249
00:11:36,292 --> 00:11:38,872
It's like all a little bit of thing. Armageddon.

250
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:41,492
It's like kind of all that in one.

251
00:11:41,692 --> 00:11:43,812
And it's kind of like a practical set.

252
00:11:43,812 --> 00:11:48,292
But then like they at least weren't just showing you different video.

253
00:11:48,312 --> 00:11:52,672
There was sort of like a Pepper's Ghost sort of like it looks like they were sort of

254
00:11:52,672 --> 00:11:55,352
in to make Stephen Webber sort of be hosting.

255
00:11:55,372 --> 00:11:59,612
Yeah. What you're saying is like they had this effect that would kind of make him 3D ish.

256
00:11:59,712 --> 00:12:02,452
Like it's the kind of best they could do for like 1998.

257
00:12:02,692 --> 00:12:05,632
It looks a lot better in like Gringotts in the queue for Gringotts.

258
00:12:05,712 --> 00:12:07,992
It looks well, yeah. I mean, they had perfected it.

259
00:12:07,992 --> 00:12:11,152
But he does look a little bit like you can from the white.

260
00:12:11,312 --> 00:12:13,272
There's there's very little video footage of it, too.

261
00:12:13,272 --> 00:12:16,712
But there one like there because this is back before cell phone cameras.

262
00:12:16,712 --> 00:12:20,512
There I can kind of see that I could give you squinted.

263
00:12:20,512 --> 00:12:23,132
You'd be like, oh, is Stephen Weber standing there hosting this?

264
00:12:23,232 --> 00:12:25,612
But obviously, I'm sure it's like a naturally good.

265
00:12:25,712 --> 00:12:29,712
There's a reason why this effect keeps blowing people's minds and the Tupac hologram.

266
00:12:30,152 --> 00:12:31,232
And right. What have you.

267
00:12:31,232 --> 00:12:33,012
It does just work.

268
00:12:33,372 --> 00:12:35,792
But I think it's a pain in the ass to do.

269
00:12:36,072 --> 00:12:40,212
And that's, you know, like when they did the Aerosmith because that's the same,

270
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:44,312
you know, technique that makes it look like Aerosmith in the recording studio.

271
00:12:44,552 --> 00:12:47,292
And even then, it's a little better. Yeah, yeah.

272
00:12:47,312 --> 00:12:50,652
Yeah. This was almost like a test scenario for that, maybe.

273
00:12:50,832 --> 00:12:54,832
But I think they all had to like wear crazy contact lenses.

274
00:12:55,672 --> 00:12:59,212
They can Marino famously unspeaking extra in that part.

275
00:12:59,252 --> 00:13:03,052
I think they all had to wear like weird because they have to light it so bright

276
00:13:03,052 --> 00:13:07,072
and so heavy to make it to make the footage bright enough to appear like it's in the room,

277
00:13:07,212 --> 00:13:10,532
which makes me wonder, is that why Stephen Weber?

278
00:13:10,532 --> 00:13:15,312
Did they throw this to like a Steve Martin and he's like, and what do I have to do?

279
00:13:15,392 --> 00:13:21,172
I have to be trapped under special contact lenses like UV contacts.

280
00:13:21,192 --> 00:13:23,152
Mm hmm. Yeah, I would not.

281
00:13:23,272 --> 00:13:26,512
I feel like Stephen where it can have been the first choice.

282
00:13:26,512 --> 00:13:28,372
And it's not like this is like catered to him.

283
00:13:28,452 --> 00:13:30,932
I feel I feel like it was like a role that like, all right.

284
00:13:30,952 --> 00:13:32,992
And then an actor will be your host.

285
00:13:33,072 --> 00:13:35,932
And it's who they this is who they landed on. Right.

286
00:13:35,932 --> 00:13:38,952
Yeah, I mean, I would assume I didn't because like there's so much

287
00:13:38,952 --> 00:13:42,052
lore surrounding Rock and Rollercoaster about like, oh, it was going to be

288
00:13:42,052 --> 00:13:44,752
the Rolling Stones, but they said no, it was going to be Kiss.

289
00:13:44,812 --> 00:13:46,532
But they said no, you wanted too much money.

290
00:13:46,852 --> 00:13:49,032
And then it's Aerosmith. There's not quite as much.

291
00:13:49,392 --> 00:13:52,972
But yeah, I was trying to figure out like, yeah, 1997 or something.

292
00:13:52,992 --> 00:13:55,532
Who on ABC? Because Drew Carey show

293
00:13:55,532 --> 00:13:57,992
Drew Carey makes sense to host a thing around that time.

294
00:13:58,012 --> 00:13:59,272
They already had him pegged for the other.

295
00:13:59,532 --> 00:14:01,632
You know, they're thinking Tim out like it's got to be.

296
00:14:01,872 --> 00:14:03,632
Yes. Or I mean, or yeah.

297
00:14:04,112 --> 00:14:05,632
Any anyone Richard Karn?

298
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:08,132
You could even like soundstage with Richard Karn.

299
00:14:08,332 --> 00:14:10,672
Obviously, sure. I feel like Weber over Karn.

300
00:14:10,952 --> 00:14:12,092
No offense, Karn.

301
00:14:12,372 --> 00:14:14,872
No, he has to be on that list shortlist.

302
00:14:15,092 --> 00:14:18,152
Just because you don't like you do kind of recognize the name Steven Weber.

303
00:14:18,172 --> 00:14:20,852
You're more like I know Al when I see him.

304
00:14:21,172 --> 00:14:22,492
I don't know the name.

305
00:14:22,912 --> 00:14:26,192
Yeah, you do now more from like infomercials or whatever.

306
00:14:26,312 --> 00:14:30,852
Well, and it it falls into that weird nebulous kind of area where it's like

307
00:14:30,852 --> 00:14:34,112
Steven Weber is playing himself, but then some of the people

308
00:14:34,112 --> 00:14:38,172
who work in other departments are like recognizable actors,

309
00:14:38,172 --> 00:14:41,892
but they're playing characters like Ellen's energy adventure.

310
00:14:41,892 --> 00:14:43,852
Yeah. Yeah. How it's like.

311
00:14:44,072 --> 00:14:45,192
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

312
00:14:45,632 --> 00:14:49,632
Uh huh. Because like, yeah, when you go to the lighting department or whatever,

313
00:14:49,952 --> 00:14:52,532
it's like Martin Moll is one of them. Is that right?

314
00:14:52,712 --> 00:14:54,012
Yeah. He shows up.

315
00:14:54,472 --> 00:14:58,992
And then I mean, the weirdest one was that like so they go through all the departments

316
00:14:58,992 --> 00:15:01,192
and eventually they get to director.

317
00:15:01,272 --> 00:15:02,172
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

318
00:15:02,232 --> 00:15:04,892
And the director is Elliott Gould.

319
00:15:05,412 --> 00:15:08,472
So they got Elliott Gould to do the director character.

320
00:15:08,472 --> 00:15:13,132
And there's even like a joke about it where like Steven Weber says, like,

321
00:15:13,132 --> 00:15:16,912
you know, he gives good notes and goes like, yeah, that's a great idea.

322
00:15:17,012 --> 00:15:18,552
Hey, you should be an actor. Yeah.

323
00:15:18,552 --> 00:15:20,212
You should be an actor, as he said.

324
00:15:20,472 --> 00:15:23,552
But it's like, is Elliott Gould sort of on the way down?

325
00:15:23,632 --> 00:15:27,152
Because like soundstage with Elliott Gould is that well, doesn't even

326
00:15:27,932 --> 00:15:32,432
amount of time like these people will do cameos, but I will like

327
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:33,672
stick around for the whole thing.

328
00:15:33,672 --> 00:15:38,712
But didn't you find like Elliott Gould shows up in like, was it Carolyn in the city?

329
00:15:39,752 --> 00:15:41,872
It did. I sounds right.

330
00:15:42,032 --> 00:15:44,612
I seen there's one where Elliott Gould shows up as himself

331
00:15:44,612 --> 00:15:46,692
and they're like looking through a telescope.

332
00:15:47,172 --> 00:15:48,292
Why did I see this?

333
00:15:48,332 --> 00:15:49,812
Someone posted this recently.

334
00:15:50,192 --> 00:15:53,652
There it's like you were just following around Elliott Gould with a telescope.

335
00:15:53,832 --> 00:15:57,132
I think it was someone posting.

336
00:15:57,132 --> 00:15:59,872
Posting about like Christine Baranski is on.

337
00:16:00,052 --> 00:16:01,792
What show was she on? Was she on?

338
00:16:01,792 --> 00:16:02,932
She was on Sibyl. Yeah.

339
00:16:03,132 --> 00:16:07,052
So there's an episode of Sibyl where she's looking through a telescope.

340
00:16:07,112 --> 00:16:12,992
She realized Elliott Gould is like next door and like he's like in a state of undress.

341
00:16:12,992 --> 00:16:16,052
And then at some point he comes over and knocks on the front door and he goes like,

342
00:16:16,052 --> 00:16:19,892
do you want a better look at like opens his robe and the audience goes crazy?

343
00:16:20,632 --> 00:16:25,452
Does the so is the reaction similar with the director joke?

344
00:16:25,732 --> 00:16:26,692
Does it kill?

345
00:16:27,312 --> 00:16:30,132
I think I feel like I only saw this like once or twice.

346
00:16:30,132 --> 00:16:33,692
I feel like the one time it kind of did because then Elliott Gould kind of like

347
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:36,552
looks in the camera and rolls his eyes a little like makes a thing.

348
00:16:36,792 --> 00:16:38,032
Yeah. So you saw you.

349
00:16:38,032 --> 00:16:41,272
You did this attraction. So I don't think I did.

350
00:16:41,272 --> 00:16:42,472
I don't have a memory of it.

351
00:16:42,812 --> 00:16:43,952
I don't think I did it.

352
00:16:44,372 --> 00:16:48,392
So because I guess we weren't there because it was open for a very short time.

353
00:16:48,572 --> 00:16:50,612
We would have been in the less than a year.

354
00:16:51,092 --> 00:16:52,392
Then, yeah, I don't think.

355
00:16:52,672 --> 00:16:55,372
Did you I don't I didn't see a confirmation on this.

356
00:16:55,372 --> 00:16:59,332
I saw that there was a thing where they were selling like megaphones sort of,

357
00:16:59,432 --> 00:17:02,872
where you could kind of shout along with the cues of the ride.

358
00:17:03,232 --> 00:17:06,132
So it would say soundstage on like an old time like megaphones.

359
00:17:06,132 --> 00:17:07,312
I think they would. It's pretty good.

360
00:17:07,952 --> 00:17:08,392
Yeah, it is pretty.

361
00:17:08,572 --> 00:17:13,032
I could I could not find anyone on eBay to confirm that they sell the clapboards.

362
00:17:13,172 --> 00:17:16,012
But yeah, you haven't seen the director megaphones,

363
00:17:16,012 --> 00:17:19,572
which is still what we assume sets have. Right.

364
00:17:19,792 --> 00:17:21,912
Even though Tino has a giant.

365
00:17:21,972 --> 00:17:23,612
Yeah, he has one. He might.

366
00:17:24,052 --> 00:17:25,152
He might. And he should. Yeah.

367
00:17:25,152 --> 00:17:27,472
But not JJ. No, no.

368
00:17:27,472 --> 00:17:29,432
They switched to bull horns if they have to.

369
00:17:29,432 --> 00:17:30,692
You just have like a radio shack.

370
00:17:30,752 --> 00:17:33,792
You don't think that wasn't intended to take home.

371
00:17:33,952 --> 00:17:38,072
That's like you would go on the attraction again and like say the

372
00:17:38,072 --> 00:17:42,292
is it because they ask like the audience all has to yell action and quiet on the set?

373
00:17:42,312 --> 00:17:46,652
So you do it with the I think that was the idea that it was a fun interactive thing.

374
00:17:46,652 --> 00:17:48,692
So it would be like we're all going to try it.

375
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:52,232
We'll all say action. We'll all say cut, print or whatever.

376
00:17:52,292 --> 00:17:54,532
The Harry Potter wand of its time.

377
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:57,772
Right. The megaphone, the soundstage megaphone.

378
00:17:58,072 --> 00:18:00,452
I mean, that that yeah, that was weird.

379
00:18:00,452 --> 00:18:03,052
Like the interactive stuff was so in its infancy.

380
00:18:03,112 --> 00:18:05,832
But I thought the strangest thing was that for a while,

381
00:18:06,092 --> 00:18:09,812
like they go through all these departments, but they skip the sound department

382
00:18:09,812 --> 00:18:12,392
because sounds dangerous was coming.

383
00:18:12,852 --> 00:18:16,032
And Steven Weber says, separate, see whoever says like,

384
00:18:16,172 --> 00:18:17,852
I'm going to leave that one to my friend, Drew.

385
00:18:18,572 --> 00:18:21,312
And but my God, he pre allude to it.

386
00:18:21,312 --> 00:18:22,292
Yeah, this open first.

387
00:18:22,292 --> 00:18:25,692
So for a while, people were like, what the fuck is he talking about?

388
00:18:25,712 --> 00:18:28,392
It's like a Rosita type, like not.

389
00:18:28,392 --> 00:18:29,812
Yeah, there's a little Easter egg.

390
00:18:29,832 --> 00:18:33,652
What's only for like the shittiest stakes, the shittiest thing.

391
00:18:33,732 --> 00:18:36,692
And then Drew Carey is playing a character in Sounds Dangerous.

392
00:18:36,692 --> 00:18:38,752
So like some wires got crossed.

393
00:18:39,032 --> 00:18:41,412
They did not like check each other's reality.

394
00:18:41,412 --> 00:18:46,812
Oh, yeah. Maybe there was a draft of Sounds Dangerous where he was to carry himself.

395
00:18:46,812 --> 00:18:49,112
And what's the name of the character from Sounds Dangerous?

396
00:18:49,152 --> 00:18:51,772
It's like Detective Godfrey or something.

397
00:18:52,752 --> 00:18:53,492
Or Hobnob.

398
00:18:53,872 --> 00:18:55,772
Yeah, he's like some bumblein.

399
00:18:56,572 --> 00:18:57,212
Huh? Weird.

400
00:18:57,412 --> 00:18:59,752
That is weird. This inconsistent mythologies.

401
00:18:59,832 --> 00:19:03,932
That's a perfect like that's, you know, of the time for sure.

402
00:19:04,272 --> 00:19:08,172
I think, OK, here's what here's the other reason I think this happened in the wind.

403
00:19:08,332 --> 00:19:14,692
Like, OK, the they built Disney Studios thinking will have

404
00:19:14,692 --> 00:19:19,552
like we'll build all these sound stages and there will be actual shows being fit

405
00:19:19,872 --> 00:19:21,412
like Nickelodeon Studios Universal.

406
00:19:21,772 --> 00:19:24,852
All that was filmed in Disney and James Studios.

407
00:19:25,412 --> 00:19:29,212
Mickey Mouse Club's going on and Star Search with Ed McMahon.

408
00:19:29,212 --> 00:19:30,012
Oh, yeah.

409
00:19:30,552 --> 00:19:34,512
And so you would go on these walking tours and you would look down into the sets,

410
00:19:34,512 --> 00:19:35,892
which was a big deal for me.

411
00:19:35,892 --> 00:19:37,412
I loved M.M.C. as a kid.

412
00:19:37,412 --> 00:19:40,752
And you can sit like, well, wow, it's empty and nobody's working down there.

413
00:19:40,772 --> 00:19:42,192
But I could see the actual set.

414
00:19:42,552 --> 00:19:46,132
Then the production stops because after the Disney

415
00:19:47,972 --> 00:19:51,092
Universal war settles down, they they all stop pretending

416
00:19:51,092 --> 00:19:53,412
that they're actually a film stuff at these studios.

417
00:19:53,412 --> 00:19:57,352
But these sound stages are all like in the park.

418
00:19:57,532 --> 00:20:01,312
They're all like, it's not even just like here's the studio area like it is

419
00:20:01,312 --> 00:20:05,872
universal, like you're walking right by them and they're just rotting.

420
00:20:05,952 --> 00:20:07,032
They're nothing. Right.

421
00:20:07,032 --> 00:20:09,732
So like, how can we repurpose the studio?

422
00:20:09,872 --> 00:20:12,632
How can we repurpose the sound stage and make an attraction out of it

423
00:20:12,632 --> 00:20:15,792
by making it a sound stage that comes to life?

424
00:20:15,792 --> 00:20:18,652
So you it's all of the though the effects are neat.

425
00:20:18,652 --> 00:20:23,732
Essentially, if you look through it all, you are just walking through an empty

426
00:20:23,732 --> 00:20:25,192
sound stage, right?

427
00:20:25,212 --> 00:20:27,352
Some cases just totally unadorned.

428
00:20:27,352 --> 00:20:29,972
There's the door. There's the fire extinguisher.

429
00:20:29,992 --> 00:20:31,512
I mean, need effects at everything.

430
00:20:31,712 --> 00:20:36,832
But like, I don't know, they don't like sell it necessarily completely.

431
00:20:37,012 --> 00:20:38,692
It seems like a quick fix.

432
00:20:39,132 --> 00:20:40,252
It just seems. Yeah.

433
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:42,992
So it's literally then easy to get rid of.

434
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:46,872
It's like it's not like they made a Transformers type experience.

435
00:20:46,872 --> 00:20:50,992
No, they are to demolish, which that like and that stuff is.

436
00:20:51,052 --> 00:20:54,772
So you're like all of those little demonstrations of like

437
00:20:54,772 --> 00:20:58,432
the parts of the sound stage, which are we I mean, like the departments,

438
00:20:58,432 --> 00:21:02,732
I guess, I guess, yeah, the costume area would be in the sound stage.

439
00:21:02,732 --> 00:21:04,072
But it becomes a stretch.

440
00:21:04,432 --> 00:21:07,812
Like, well, how do you show this stuff when they get to craft services?

441
00:21:07,972 --> 00:21:12,012
The running craft services joke, which as a comedy nerd,

442
00:21:12,092 --> 00:21:15,992
this is very funny to think back that it was Chris Elliott doing.

443
00:21:16,112 --> 00:21:18,012
Chris Elliott was the craft services guy.

444
00:21:18,312 --> 00:21:21,392
And the running joke is that his name was Mickey.

445
00:21:21,932 --> 00:21:23,492
It was Mickey, the craft services guy.

446
00:21:23,732 --> 00:21:27,232
And Steven Weber keeps making jokes of like, hey, you look different.

447
00:21:27,292 --> 00:21:27,892
Where's Minnie?

448
00:21:28,272 --> 00:21:30,632
You look different from the cartoons and all.

449
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:32,592
And then he keeps eating that cheese, too.

450
00:21:32,592 --> 00:21:33,972
Like that's his of all the crafts.

451
00:21:34,052 --> 00:21:37,572
Like he he's pushing the cheese on everyone to eat because there's just too.

452
00:21:37,592 --> 00:21:39,032
So much cheese. There's just so much.

453
00:21:39,032 --> 00:21:40,292
But he is not Mickey Mouse.

454
00:21:40,292 --> 00:21:43,392
But they know any and he's like, why do people keep saying that?

455
00:21:43,672 --> 00:21:46,712
Meanwhile, he has a big block of cheese that he keeps pushing.

456
00:21:47,132 --> 00:21:47,572
Yeah. Yeah.

457
00:21:47,572 --> 00:21:49,652
And then it's like, yeah, but you got all that cheese.

458
00:21:49,772 --> 00:21:53,672
Good Chris Elliott part like, yeah, sort of like grimy, you know,

459
00:21:54,112 --> 00:21:56,712
I miss him being and he seems like he doesn't show up and stay.

460
00:21:56,712 --> 00:21:58,832
He would like be in commercials.

461
00:21:59,012 --> 00:22:00,512
He'd be little parts in movies.

462
00:22:00,512 --> 00:22:02,832
And he's on Schitt's Creek, which I've never watched.

463
00:22:03,192 --> 00:22:06,372
So I'll continue to assume that it's very good.

464
00:22:06,612 --> 00:22:08,092
People say it's very good. I'm sure it is.

465
00:22:08,212 --> 00:22:09,472
All those people are good. Check it out.

466
00:22:09,732 --> 00:22:11,112
He gives this is all.

467
00:22:11,132 --> 00:22:14,192
And I think the character actors in general, and not to say that Stephen doesn't.

468
00:22:14,212 --> 00:22:17,012
He's like, I don't know. I mean, it's not like he

469
00:22:17,012 --> 00:22:22,072
he just kind of like walks through it with this sort of like

470
00:22:22,072 --> 00:22:24,452
flipping air. He's like tossing off.

471
00:22:24,572 --> 00:22:29,192
You know, it's the one I like is when he's like telling you in general

472
00:22:29,192 --> 00:22:31,472
what a sound stage is.

473
00:22:31,692 --> 00:22:34,552
And he and like, you know, yeah, you know, it's this big place

474
00:22:34,552 --> 00:22:36,152
of the with the tall roof, whatever.

475
00:22:36,232 --> 00:22:39,012
It's kind of like your high school gym, except nobody's getting rope burn.

476
00:22:40,532 --> 00:22:42,332
It's like, that's all right.

477
00:22:42,332 --> 00:22:43,152
Yeah, that's fine.

478
00:22:43,532 --> 00:22:46,452
I don't know. You know, he does it with sort of this 90s

479
00:22:46,452 --> 00:22:48,172
Dennis Miller thing.

480
00:22:48,532 --> 00:22:52,972
So he's fine. But it's for sure there's more to chew on as the craft service guy.

481
00:22:53,192 --> 00:22:56,972
Did you guys ever have to do that in school, like climb the rope to the gym?

482
00:22:56,972 --> 00:23:00,972
Yeah. I never did that, which made the joke seem weird to me

483
00:23:00,972 --> 00:23:05,232
that they would do like, yeah, it feels like a very fifties version of

484
00:23:05,232 --> 00:23:07,752
which have made it work for dads. But you did the rope.

485
00:23:07,752 --> 00:23:09,552
I did the rope. I didn't get to the ceiling.

486
00:23:09,712 --> 00:23:11,512
I don't remember. I didn't get that.

487
00:23:11,892 --> 00:23:13,992
Were there mats like if you fell, were there mats?

488
00:23:14,332 --> 00:23:17,452
There were. There was like a mat, but it wasn't like a big crash pad.

489
00:23:17,452 --> 00:23:19,232
It was like a couple of gym mats.

490
00:23:19,532 --> 00:23:22,472
So I would assume some kids, no one ate shit.

491
00:23:22,552 --> 00:23:24,972
No one like fell on their head as far as I saw.

492
00:23:25,292 --> 00:23:27,432
But I would assume. Yeah.

493
00:23:27,612 --> 00:23:29,532
Because I'm trying to remember.

494
00:23:30,032 --> 00:23:33,392
I for sure did the rope and I did not get very high.

495
00:23:33,852 --> 00:23:35,072
But kids would get high.

496
00:23:35,072 --> 00:23:38,092
So you think there was a chance that they just flipped or like let go

497
00:23:38,092 --> 00:23:39,712
and they cracked their head on the ground.

498
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:40,952
Yeah. Hmm.

499
00:23:41,432 --> 00:23:42,552
We should look into accident.

500
00:23:43,932 --> 00:23:49,052
We will try. We try to avoid theme park accidents, but the rope,

501
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:50,472
gym class, rope accidents.

502
00:23:50,852 --> 00:23:54,312
I don't like knowing that my beloved theme parks have problems, but yeah,

503
00:23:54,432 --> 00:23:57,412
some, you know, yeah, incidents at high schools.

504
00:23:57,572 --> 00:24:00,752
Or the rope. I'm sure at a certain point, a rope became detached.

505
00:24:00,752 --> 00:24:02,572
Mm hmm. Had to have.

506
00:24:02,652 --> 00:24:04,692
How sturdy could it have been?

507
00:24:04,692 --> 00:24:05,732
Right. Yeah.

508
00:24:06,052 --> 00:24:07,852
Because they didn't have sounds.

509
00:24:07,972 --> 00:24:13,112
The sound stage is famous grids, which they talk about at length

510
00:24:13,112 --> 00:24:16,052
as if a grid is interesting.

511
00:24:16,112 --> 00:24:18,892
Like the lighting grid and then there's walks.

512
00:24:19,352 --> 00:24:20,012
Yeah. Yeah.

513
00:24:20,092 --> 00:24:23,692
Well, they do a whole like the lighting grid sort of has its own personality.

514
00:24:23,952 --> 00:24:26,432
So it's like, are you are you guys ready?

515
00:24:26,572 --> 00:24:28,712
Are the floods ready? And it's like boop boop.

516
00:24:28,792 --> 00:24:31,432
And then they kind of like have that little like Pixar lamp

517
00:24:31,432 --> 00:24:33,652
kind of a movement to it.

518
00:24:33,652 --> 00:24:34,852
That was really fun.

519
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:38,452
Light has more personality because he can bend all around.

520
00:24:38,652 --> 00:24:42,292
Yes. But like the, you know, what it did a great job of teaching me.

521
00:24:42,332 --> 00:24:42,972
I can't even name it.

522
00:24:42,972 --> 00:24:45,512
Just like the general like fluorescence. Right.

523
00:24:45,732 --> 00:24:48,672
Are there there? No, they just they just like hum.

524
00:24:48,772 --> 00:24:50,372
They literally hum. Right. Yeah.

525
00:24:50,372 --> 00:24:51,672
And they get me. They do that.

526
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:55,532
Like the work lights when they come on, they do make that thunk

527
00:24:55,532 --> 00:24:58,912
that like when you throw a bunch of fluorescence on, you can hear like,

528
00:24:59,792 --> 00:25:03,012
thunk. And then like they say they're like the crotchety.

529
00:25:03,112 --> 00:25:04,352
Yeah, they're the crotchety.

530
00:25:04,892 --> 00:25:07,872
Yeah. I like when he's when the gels, I like the gels.

531
00:25:07,972 --> 00:25:08,912
He goes, ready gels?

532
00:25:09,232 --> 00:25:11,392
And then the gels that are like a bright purple

533
00:25:11,392 --> 00:25:12,972
and they kind of give a different like mood.

534
00:25:13,312 --> 00:25:16,372
Oh, well, we love they kind of go through like the rain, but and it's a little like

535
00:25:16,372 --> 00:25:19,632
the it's sort of like a little like Tiki room scenario.

536
00:25:20,152 --> 00:25:23,152
The lights might be the my favorite part of all of it, honestly.

537
00:25:23,532 --> 00:25:24,932
That's fun. Lights are fun.

538
00:25:25,132 --> 00:25:26,832
Yeah. They have like a little personality.

539
00:25:26,832 --> 00:25:27,952
I always like something.

540
00:25:28,452 --> 00:25:31,832
And this did I did remember this from being a kid like.

541
00:25:32,092 --> 00:25:36,112
So you come in the one elephant elephant door of the sound stage.

542
00:25:36,112 --> 00:25:38,852
But then it looks like there's a second set of elephant doors

543
00:25:38,852 --> 00:25:39,792
that you're looking at.

544
00:25:39,792 --> 00:25:42,832
And he goes like, why do they shoot on sound stages?

545
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:47,232
Why don't they just shoot outside and goes, well, sometimes outside

546
00:25:47,232 --> 00:25:49,752
doesn't cooperate and they slide open the elevator doors.

547
00:25:49,752 --> 00:25:52,592
And there's an Orlando like downpour going.

548
00:25:52,612 --> 00:25:56,292
And it's like, but in here, we can make any weather we want.

549
00:25:56,512 --> 00:26:00,932
That's right. They do the like little miniature reveal of like the hard rain.

550
00:26:00,932 --> 00:26:02,152
Yeah. Coming down.

551
00:26:02,512 --> 00:26:03,272
Yeah. Yeah.

552
00:26:03,792 --> 00:26:07,552
I you know what I part that I was always like, all right,

553
00:26:07,552 --> 00:26:10,752
I see why they're demonstrating this, but it's a little like

554
00:26:10,752 --> 00:26:14,032
they take they take a little too far when they when they explain

555
00:26:14,032 --> 00:26:17,612
soundproofing, you know, you got to get into all the like

556
00:26:17,612 --> 00:26:21,672
the nitty gritty of the buildings themselves, like the fascinating process

557
00:26:21,672 --> 00:26:25,612
of the soundproof. Yeah, that takes up a lot of time, a lot of time.

558
00:26:25,612 --> 00:26:27,932
And they've already like glossed over.

559
00:26:28,192 --> 00:26:30,332
We're not going to talk about the sound department.

560
00:26:30,472 --> 00:26:34,492
Not the recording of the sound, but the idea that you need like,

561
00:26:34,932 --> 00:26:39,712
yeah, a quiet environment that at least like they feel like they need to address.

562
00:26:40,132 --> 00:26:43,912
So there's this there's like when they they flip on like, all right,

563
00:26:43,912 --> 00:26:45,912
if there wasn't, you know,

564
00:26:45,992 --> 00:26:48,852
like if you couldn't control the environment and there was no roof

565
00:26:48,852 --> 00:26:53,032
on the place, you know, then your movie would sound like then they like show a scene

566
00:26:53,032 --> 00:26:54,952
from the movie. I forget.

567
00:26:55,132 --> 00:26:58,552
It's like so it's just like some generic touchstone kind of movie.

568
00:26:58,752 --> 00:27:02,792
But you hear like it's the sounds that it's not just like general,

569
00:27:02,992 --> 00:27:05,072
like what you would hear if one plane was passing by.

570
00:27:05,092 --> 00:27:07,572
It is full on World War Two.

571
00:27:07,612 --> 00:27:13,372
It was like a thousand planes and tractors and cats and sheep's bawling.

572
00:27:13,592 --> 00:27:18,112
But then they inflate the soundproofing cloth. Right.

573
00:27:18,112 --> 00:27:20,492
And then that all makes it go away. Yeah.

574
00:27:20,512 --> 00:27:21,612
Which is like, all right.

575
00:27:21,712 --> 00:27:24,652
I mean, you have to exaggerate it to get the point across.

576
00:27:25,032 --> 00:27:28,992
But like who's trying to make a movie during like an air raid?

577
00:27:29,332 --> 00:27:31,632
Why? Why is it so crazy?

578
00:27:32,052 --> 00:27:35,892
I would imagine that they try to just like put normal noise in it.

579
00:27:35,892 --> 00:27:38,292
It wasn't that bad. It didn't read. So then.

580
00:27:38,312 --> 00:27:40,952
Right. So they were just like, well, let's throw all this shit against the wall.

581
00:27:41,592 --> 00:27:43,372
And but the inflatable wall,

582
00:27:43,552 --> 00:27:46,532
seeing the inflatable walls just like puff up all of a sudden,

583
00:27:46,572 --> 00:27:49,672
like behind that scrim. Right. That's kind of a neat effect.

584
00:27:49,692 --> 00:27:50,632
That was a neat effect.

585
00:27:50,832 --> 00:27:54,312
I did think, though, like in terms of exaggeration, I thought they went

586
00:27:54,512 --> 00:27:58,192
they pushed it a little too far, like almost a little condescending

587
00:27:58,192 --> 00:28:02,292
when he's like, we're on the set of a new show I'm on called Order Up,

588
00:28:02,712 --> 00:28:05,452
which is about a big city lawyer who leaves his firm

589
00:28:05,452 --> 00:28:08,512
to take over his family's New England diner.

590
00:28:08,512 --> 00:28:13,192
And so like he's the head of the he's the head cook and manages the diner.

591
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:15,532
But he also used to be a big city lawyer.

592
00:28:15,532 --> 00:28:19,312
And it's like, I don't it's so confusing.

593
00:28:19,312 --> 00:28:21,652
So much. Yeah, there's so much.

594
00:28:21,772 --> 00:28:25,332
Well, like everyone in the audience is like, OK, that's a little we know that's fake.

595
00:28:25,332 --> 00:28:26,612
That's not a real show.

596
00:28:26,912 --> 00:28:29,452
Which and also and like as a theme park,

597
00:28:30,012 --> 00:28:32,412
you mean we get to go inside a false kitchen.

598
00:28:32,612 --> 00:28:36,912
Yeah. Makes boy, you know, I like going inside Indiana Jones's

599
00:28:36,912 --> 00:28:38,312
you know, into the temple.

600
00:28:38,492 --> 00:28:39,892
Indiana Jones is invading.

601
00:28:39,992 --> 00:28:43,192
But I also like seeing a false kitchen. Yeah. Yeah.

602
00:28:43,192 --> 00:28:47,272
So, yeah, I mean, there's a lot of unexciting stuff,

603
00:28:47,452 --> 00:28:50,012
I would say with it in general.

604
00:28:50,012 --> 00:28:53,072
It's just so what I mean, it's all real.

605
00:28:53,192 --> 00:28:54,432
Order up is the most realistic.

606
00:28:54,692 --> 00:28:57,052
Like, yeah, for sure, that's a show that would happen.

607
00:28:57,312 --> 00:29:00,432
But like, yeah, they're not going to take us into, you know, right.

608
00:29:00,552 --> 00:29:04,232
But then collapsing mine or three cameras, you can only be so interesting.

609
00:29:04,272 --> 00:29:07,752
So they're also showing you movie tricks to like it.

610
00:29:07,772 --> 00:29:08,632
Yeah, well, they do.

611
00:29:08,792 --> 00:29:12,492
So they're like because they have to live in like the order up universe.

612
00:29:12,852 --> 00:29:14,552
Like they have to stay in that narrative.

613
00:29:14,612 --> 00:29:16,672
But that's this that's what this TV show is.

614
00:29:16,932 --> 00:29:19,792
But they do want to show you like stunts and stunt men.

615
00:29:20,012 --> 00:29:23,512
So they're showing you like, I forget what the character's name is,

616
00:29:23,572 --> 00:29:28,012
but a character and it's a real live performer has to slip on a banana peel in the kitchen.

617
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:33,252
So he has to do a big fall, but they have to show that there's a crash pad there

618
00:29:33,252 --> 00:29:34,852
and he's going to slip on it.

619
00:29:34,852 --> 00:29:37,292
And then they're like, and this is one of the megaphone parts

620
00:29:37,292 --> 00:29:39,092
where you have to yell into the megaphone.

621
00:29:39,192 --> 00:29:41,212
It's like, OK, ready stunt man, Steve.

622
00:29:41,712 --> 00:29:44,692
So that's like a kind of a famous thing that people would like, I guess.

623
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:45,772
Ready stunt man, Steve.

624
00:29:45,912 --> 00:29:50,212
I also saw there's a whole section of like red bubble shirts.

625
00:29:50,212 --> 00:29:52,892
I didn't even realize this devoted to that.

626
00:29:52,892 --> 00:29:58,192
Like stunt man. Yeah, it's crazy because I thought it's like a hat box ghost of this

627
00:29:58,192 --> 00:30:01,292
where it's like I didn't even realize hat box ghost was a thing until, you know,

628
00:30:01,392 --> 00:30:04,212
10 years ago. But I guess that's a thing.

629
00:30:04,252 --> 00:30:06,652
I didn't even realize that was like a theme park.

630
00:30:06,692 --> 00:30:10,152
It's in the family of Scuba Steve, the big daddy.

631
00:30:10,332 --> 00:30:14,672
Yes, there is beloved toe who Adam Sandler dresses up as right.

632
00:30:15,312 --> 00:30:20,332
A little sexist, though, that they don't allow for the possibility of a right.

633
00:30:20,372 --> 00:30:21,792
So it always has to be a male man.

634
00:30:21,792 --> 00:30:23,612
And for Stephanie, yeah, right.

635
00:30:23,892 --> 00:30:26,292
I think if they were to bring it back, they would have to do.

636
00:30:26,392 --> 00:30:27,452
Yeah, they would obviously have to.

637
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:29,212
It would have to be flexible to be a gender.

638
00:30:29,252 --> 00:30:33,992
Yeah. Like if you name it, Dana or Joe or something like some sort of gender

639
00:30:33,992 --> 00:30:39,012
neutral, they did the guy that takes you around is named Casey.

640
00:30:39,632 --> 00:30:44,652
And the dialogue refers to like Steven always says, like, like, OK,

641
00:30:44,652 --> 00:30:47,872
you're ready, Casey, which does allow like for gender neutrality.

642
00:30:48,112 --> 00:30:51,212
So they thought of it there. But Stuntman Steve, I guess they're

643
00:30:51,212 --> 00:30:53,052
just like who they did a casting.

644
00:30:53,092 --> 00:30:56,012
And it was like, I think only the guys are going to work for this.

645
00:30:56,032 --> 00:30:58,892
And the joke is Steven Weber, it's his name. His name is Steve, too.

646
00:30:58,932 --> 00:31:01,892
So I think that's another reason why, because he was like, I'm glad that's

647
00:31:01,892 --> 00:31:03,472
this different Steve Stuntman.

648
00:31:03,652 --> 00:31:05,372
Yeah, right. Stuntman Steve, not me.

649
00:31:05,592 --> 00:31:09,632
So they have to call him on set if you have Steve, two people turn around.

650
00:31:09,652 --> 00:31:11,692
But they started saying Stuntman Steve. Right.

651
00:31:11,692 --> 00:31:14,632
So they milk it. So I understand for those jokes, they had to do it.

652
00:31:14,632 --> 00:31:17,392
Because he's got dialogue with the live performers.

653
00:31:17,452 --> 00:31:19,552
So it had they had to choose what I'm saying.

654
00:31:19,592 --> 00:31:24,672
What I also like that to then force them and they like that

655
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:28,952
the diner has to serve banana splits in order to set up.

656
00:31:29,112 --> 00:31:31,312
Right. That's like its trademark or signature item.

657
00:31:31,512 --> 00:31:34,052
Yeah. And they can't just make that a subtle thing.

658
00:31:34,132 --> 00:31:37,412
Like there's this gigantic sign. Right.

659
00:31:37,612 --> 00:31:41,312
Blinking signs that they can involve it in the lighting demonstration.

660
00:31:41,332 --> 00:31:45,972
A big neon sign today's special banana splits. Right.

661
00:31:46,132 --> 00:31:48,972
But it's a special every day. It's always the special.

662
00:31:49,812 --> 00:31:53,492
They're like, what what restaurant would what short order restaurant

663
00:31:53,492 --> 00:31:55,812
would invest in a constantly flashing?

664
00:31:56,092 --> 00:31:57,892
I mean, one that Jason would go to. Yeah.

665
00:31:57,892 --> 00:32:02,332
I do think of banana splits of like a diner staple, like

666
00:32:02,332 --> 00:32:06,192
because it seems like, oh, that's something, you know, we've been drinking

667
00:32:06,192 --> 00:32:08,512
or you want something sweet late at night or so.

668
00:32:08,652 --> 00:32:11,212
It's it's not a lot of stuff to keep in the kitchen.

669
00:32:11,412 --> 00:32:13,772
It's a few kinds of ice cream,

670
00:32:13,772 --> 00:32:18,592
special bananas and those bananas keep working for desserts, even if they

671
00:32:18,592 --> 00:32:22,312
like a mushy banana can still factor into a dessert.

672
00:32:22,312 --> 00:32:23,452
Yeah. Yeah. Banana bread.

673
00:32:23,512 --> 00:32:26,412
Even if eating the banana is unpleasant.

674
00:32:26,812 --> 00:32:31,152
But like maraschino cherries, crushed pineapple, like that shit keeps forever.

675
00:32:31,692 --> 00:32:33,792
So chocolate syrup. Yeah. Yeah.

676
00:32:34,532 --> 00:32:39,312
I which also the part where the the ice box

677
00:32:39,312 --> 00:32:44,752
open where the big industrial fridge opens and you feel the cold blast.

678
00:32:45,332 --> 00:32:46,792
Yeah, that's cool.

679
00:32:46,932 --> 00:32:50,432
But it doesn't like represent anything.

680
00:32:50,932 --> 00:32:52,012
It doesn't make sense.

681
00:32:52,032 --> 00:32:56,012
The movie like if you're watching the show order up at home,

682
00:32:56,032 --> 00:32:57,832
you wouldn't be able to feel the cold.

683
00:32:58,012 --> 00:33:03,032
It's like neat to be in the audience and have a big blast of cold at you.

684
00:33:03,032 --> 00:33:04,852
Yeah. But what is that showing off?

685
00:33:05,092 --> 00:33:08,492
No, because, you know, most of those things aren't plugged in on a set.

686
00:33:08,492 --> 00:33:12,352
So it's just like that was just a fun thing they thought to do, I guess.

687
00:33:12,832 --> 00:33:14,872
And it is. Yeah. Yeah.

688
00:33:14,992 --> 00:33:18,892
But I'm trying to track the actual narrative of like

689
00:33:18,892 --> 00:33:22,652
if it is literally the making of order up, then, yeah,

690
00:33:22,652 --> 00:33:24,552
why have they bothered to plug everything in?

691
00:33:24,592 --> 00:33:29,052
So it's like so much of it is devoted to such dull, like real movie,

692
00:33:29,052 --> 00:33:30,412
like filmmaking information.

693
00:33:30,412 --> 00:33:34,292
But then there's just huge blind spots of why would they do this?

694
00:33:34,452 --> 00:33:37,352
Yeah, it seemed like they were running out of material to show everyone.

695
00:33:37,352 --> 00:33:38,852
It's like, we need a fun thing here.

696
00:33:38,912 --> 00:33:42,432
Let's hit them with cold air because there's not that much like sound

697
00:33:42,432 --> 00:33:45,992
stages essentially are empty rooms.

698
00:33:46,192 --> 00:33:48,512
Yeah. And they do their best to dress it up.

699
00:33:48,552 --> 00:33:52,912
But I mean, like, yeah, you know, like the like probably the like

700
00:33:52,912 --> 00:33:57,632
not every department is literally going to work out of the same sound.

701
00:33:57,932 --> 00:34:00,072
They're all kind of on top of each other.

702
00:34:00,072 --> 00:34:03,872
And then when you exit like the exit area, it doesn't go into a gift shop.

703
00:34:03,872 --> 00:34:08,712
It does go into a photo op area where you can pretend to be like

704
00:34:08,712 --> 00:34:12,152
a lighting rigger or you can pretend to be Mickey

705
00:34:12,152 --> 00:34:14,672
giving out like snacks and stuff.

706
00:34:15,032 --> 00:34:21,452
You could put on like overalls like to be like a union, like a teamster.

707
00:34:21,452 --> 00:34:22,372
Yeah, like a team.

708
00:34:22,412 --> 00:34:25,432
You could hold a clipboard and a megaphone like Elliot Gould.

709
00:34:25,592 --> 00:34:28,692
And there's the I mean, and it is neat that you could like

710
00:34:28,692 --> 00:34:32,552
like that they have those lights around their phone

711
00:34:32,592 --> 00:34:35,192
and you can pick them up and hold them over your head.

712
00:34:35,232 --> 00:34:39,012
Oh, those are even though those like, yeah, they would be very heavy in real life.

713
00:34:39,112 --> 00:34:41,992
Did you end up like, well, it's more for kids, but you didn't end up

714
00:34:41,992 --> 00:34:44,532
with a photo of like the like, you know, the thing.

715
00:34:45,092 --> 00:34:46,112
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

716
00:34:46,552 --> 00:34:51,992
They're maybe, you know, my there are probably boxes and boxes of Disney photo.

717
00:34:52,132 --> 00:34:56,372
Like, I remember I remember my mom when I was in like sixth or seventh grade,

718
00:34:56,892 --> 00:35:00,952
buying like one of the big Mickey photo albums down there.

719
00:35:00,952 --> 00:35:04,772
And she's like, I'll put all the all the pictures from all the trips in this.

720
00:35:05,132 --> 00:35:08,792
And I think it got a few photos in it.

721
00:35:08,792 --> 00:35:11,372
And it's probably in the box with the photos.

722
00:35:11,372 --> 00:35:13,172
So we got to get you got to find out.

723
00:35:13,452 --> 00:35:15,292
I got to dig next time I'm home.

724
00:35:15,292 --> 00:35:20,692
Well, you know what they do have is that like, OK, so like with with order up,

725
00:35:20,692 --> 00:35:26,432
it becomes tough to like, like they still want to do all their universal trickery.

726
00:35:26,432 --> 00:35:30,152
Yes. Yeah. Like because if we haven't said, it's like one of those things

727
00:35:30,152 --> 00:35:32,812
where you're on the set, but then everything goes, hey, well,

728
00:35:32,812 --> 00:35:35,932
like the real magic of the movies unfolds on the set.

729
00:35:36,052 --> 00:35:40,772
So they want to have, you know, like water flood out, which that works in a kitchen.

730
00:35:41,032 --> 00:35:42,432
They want to do pyro.

731
00:35:42,672 --> 00:35:44,672
So there is like the big flash fire.

732
00:35:44,672 --> 00:35:46,592
The stove on the grill.

733
00:35:46,952 --> 00:35:49,072
And that's the that's legitimately impressive.

734
00:35:49,072 --> 00:35:54,332
That's fun. But then it's a little more of a stretch that they that at the very end,

735
00:35:54,472 --> 00:35:59,632
that a train like a subway train goes haywire

736
00:36:00,092 --> 00:36:03,132
and slams into the into the wall of the restaurant,

737
00:36:03,172 --> 00:36:07,492
which, by the way, would be a cool thing to happen on. Right. Order up. Sure.

738
00:36:07,592 --> 00:36:11,412
Like there. But that's the entire budget of the season.

739
00:36:11,532 --> 00:36:15,472
If you have your your set, actually have a train go through it.

740
00:36:15,472 --> 00:36:18,032
But they I understand they want to bring it to life, you know, in a theme park

741
00:36:18,032 --> 00:36:23,312
setting. But then that sets up that cutting to us, the audience as the extras

742
00:36:23,312 --> 00:36:27,692
going, ah, like you're about to crash into the restaurant.

743
00:36:27,692 --> 00:36:31,972
And then they edit it together, you know, so that you can like

744
00:36:31,972 --> 00:36:35,772
we're in the movie, the train car, and you can like take that tape home.

745
00:36:36,212 --> 00:36:40,552
But do you remember, like, you want to guess the amount of money to like

746
00:36:40,552 --> 00:36:45,672
have that you take home a video of you and the entire audience

747
00:36:45,672 --> 00:36:49,952
crashing as part of a train crashing into the into the restaurant

748
00:36:49,952 --> 00:36:51,632
in an episode of Order Up?

749
00:36:53,012 --> 00:36:54,592
Like three minute video. Three.

750
00:36:54,692 --> 00:36:57,372
So you don't even get to see the whole show.

751
00:36:57,372 --> 00:37:00,052
You don't even get to take home a copy of the whole show.

752
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:02,372
Well, there's all that, you know, they edit you into an episode.

753
00:37:02,372 --> 00:37:05,052
Oh, right. So like so you're in all of the use.

754
00:37:05,052 --> 00:37:08,732
You get all of the Steven Webbers and like, you know, when the kid like

755
00:37:08,732 --> 00:37:12,772
dresses up as the shorter cook and, you know, the volunteer kids or whatever.

756
00:37:12,852 --> 00:37:16,812
Like twenty five dollars. Forty five for a VHS.

757
00:37:16,972 --> 00:37:19,292
Forty five for late that you're barely ninety eight.

758
00:37:19,432 --> 00:37:21,432
That's barely. Jesus. Wow.

759
00:37:21,672 --> 00:37:25,392
I think it's probably like to turn those things around that quickly.

760
00:37:25,772 --> 00:37:27,432
Then it's you know, it's Disney.

761
00:37:27,432 --> 00:37:28,832
They're going to they're going to gouge you.

762
00:37:28,892 --> 00:37:32,172
But you don't like you.

763
00:37:32,232 --> 00:37:36,492
You barely see from the one that you barely like see yourself in there.

764
00:37:36,492 --> 00:37:38,952
And you're one of like 50 people.

765
00:37:38,952 --> 00:37:40,472
And it doesn't look like you're on a train.

766
00:37:40,532 --> 00:37:43,992
You're clearly in like bleachers of a studio audience.

767
00:37:44,172 --> 00:37:47,732
So the whole thing is like, also, like, yeah, that wasn't going to last.

768
00:37:47,732 --> 00:37:50,912
Train derailing crashing into a diner is a tragedy.

769
00:37:51,072 --> 00:37:55,072
That's not like a funny that they're trying to sell that as like a funny

770
00:37:56,752 --> 00:37:56,372
sitcom hijinks.

771
00:37:57,792 --> 00:38:02,532
Yeah, somebody slips on a banana peel and then a train mows through.

772
00:38:03,052 --> 00:38:05,932
And what scenario is like that?

773
00:38:05,932 --> 00:38:09,152
Why would a train be tiered like?

774
00:38:09,692 --> 00:38:13,212
It gets confusing, too, because they they make a joke about like, oh,

775
00:38:13,292 --> 00:38:14,612
stuntman Steve's fault.

776
00:38:15,192 --> 00:38:17,632
And I couldn't tell if it's like that's the real.

777
00:38:17,812 --> 00:38:20,332
The reality of it is that he drove a train into the soundstage

778
00:38:20,332 --> 00:38:21,972
or he drove a train into the scene.

779
00:38:21,972 --> 00:38:24,512
Is it a thing that's supposed to happen?

780
00:38:25,092 --> 00:38:28,612
Did they plan on that happening on this episode?

781
00:38:28,732 --> 00:38:31,992
Right. Or is it like a magic misfire?

782
00:38:32,092 --> 00:38:36,032
I thought it was supposed to be a joke about like, you know, oh, no,

783
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:39,892
they got carried away next door or like, oh, no, tomorrow's production

784
00:38:39,892 --> 00:38:42,572
showed up too early. Oh, right.

785
00:38:42,972 --> 00:38:46,992
But then I don't that always got confusing for me there.

786
00:38:47,032 --> 00:38:50,372
And the conceit that like one day it's a diner, the next day

787
00:38:50,372 --> 00:38:52,592
it's immediately a subway car.

788
00:38:52,972 --> 00:38:55,352
They can't trade out sets with that.

789
00:38:55,352 --> 00:39:00,112
No, today's set is order up and then tomorrow is NYPD Blue.

790
00:39:00,492 --> 00:39:03,952
And it's such an inconsistent show because that's that train thing happens

791
00:39:03,952 --> 00:39:08,572
right after a five minute kind of a chunk about how to be a good audience.

792
00:39:09,172 --> 00:39:12,112
Like it's like the most boring part where they're like showing you

793
00:39:12,112 --> 00:39:16,292
how people flub lines and then you have to sit there and like, keep your laughter up.

794
00:39:16,292 --> 00:39:20,252
Like, it's this real dry part about like being a good studio audience.

795
00:39:20,252 --> 00:39:22,412
And then a train, then the train part.

796
00:39:22,872 --> 00:39:24,712
So it's like, what are we doing here?

797
00:39:24,952 --> 00:39:27,672
I don't. Yeah. And but they also can't have

798
00:39:27,672 --> 00:39:33,732
when Steven Weber is enacting these scenes as the owner, he can't

799
00:39:33,732 --> 00:39:35,312
fuck up and go, shit.

800
00:39:35,592 --> 00:39:37,892
Yeah, they have to like, just like, darn it.

801
00:39:37,932 --> 00:39:39,772
Yeah. Shucks.

802
00:39:39,892 --> 00:39:41,192
Screwed that up.

803
00:39:41,192 --> 00:39:44,292
Like that's sort of what he has to do because you can't you can't curse.

804
00:39:44,552 --> 00:39:49,372
And that is usually like, yeah, the sitcom taping, they'll they'll curse

805
00:39:49,992 --> 00:39:53,252
or say something and that'll actually wake up the audience a little

806
00:39:53,252 --> 00:39:54,572
because they get to see a blooper.

807
00:39:54,812 --> 00:39:55,572
You know what I did?

808
00:39:55,792 --> 00:39:57,432
You know what I like? We kind of stepped.

809
00:39:57,772 --> 00:39:59,972
We went to into the ride before this.

810
00:39:59,972 --> 00:40:03,492
They have like a warm up guy before the show starts, which I liked.

811
00:40:03,792 --> 00:40:06,272
But why is he doing like a Sam Kinison impression?

812
00:40:06,812 --> 00:40:07,612
Isn't that weird?

813
00:40:08,232 --> 00:40:11,772
Like he's yelling at the audience so aggressively and I just doesn't make any sense.

814
00:40:11,772 --> 00:40:13,092
Dead by that point.

815
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:14,812
For sure. Sam Kinison is dead by that.

816
00:40:15,252 --> 00:40:16,852
He's yelling. He's such an aggressive.

817
00:40:16,892 --> 00:40:18,532
Why wouldn't they pick a different stand up?

818
00:40:18,532 --> 00:40:21,612
I guess like a recognizable, like even if people don't know,

819
00:40:21,612 --> 00:40:24,652
they know like yelling comic or like, where are you from?

820
00:40:24,952 --> 00:40:26,712
He yells. He's like yelling at people.

821
00:40:26,812 --> 00:40:28,432
I mean, I get it that that gets the energy up.

822
00:40:28,512 --> 00:40:30,732
It's just such an odd choice in 1998.

823
00:40:31,392 --> 00:40:33,412
Well, it's to like bring it to life.

824
00:40:33,972 --> 00:40:38,472
Like when you have to exaggerate, like in the 50s primetime cafe,

825
00:40:38,572 --> 00:40:41,452
like, you know, the most 50s mom ever. Right.

826
00:40:41,632 --> 00:40:44,172
You need the most abrasive. Right.

827
00:40:44,592 --> 00:40:46,292
You know, I guess.

828
00:40:48,352 --> 00:40:54,832
But then like that like warm up guys that we're dealing with that at all.

829
00:40:55,332 --> 00:40:58,012
Yeah. I mean, I get that it's fun because people are filing in

830
00:40:58,012 --> 00:40:59,832
and they're trying to have some business there.

831
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:03,092
But yeah, why? That's a extra level of.

832
00:41:03,812 --> 00:41:05,332
Yeah, I forget. What is this?

833
00:41:05,332 --> 00:41:06,272
What is his name again?

834
00:41:06,352 --> 00:41:07,912
Did you catch the warm up guys?

835
00:41:08,052 --> 00:41:09,252
They give him a name.

836
00:41:10,052 --> 00:41:12,332
Ralph. Yeah, that sounds like a.

837
00:41:12,492 --> 00:41:15,912
Yeah, I think it was Ralph because that like that seems like generically gruff.

838
00:41:15,912 --> 00:41:19,172
Like that's like a Jake Sully kind of like.

839
00:41:19,172 --> 00:41:20,592
Jay, oh, you like a guy.

840
00:41:20,592 --> 00:41:21,712
The guy named. Yeah.

841
00:41:22,412 --> 00:41:25,552
Yeah, I think there I think there may have been.

842
00:41:26,352 --> 00:41:31,352
Like an actual like like I think this might be like an inside reference

843
00:41:31,352 --> 00:41:36,712
or something to the guy who did warm up for Star Search like this.

844
00:41:36,732 --> 00:41:42,192
Oh, really? Yeah, that there was there was like an abrasive guy.

845
00:41:42,292 --> 00:41:45,472
It was like I read somewhere that he was he was like

846
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:49,832
like took it a little too far, took the yelling stick too far

847
00:41:49,832 --> 00:41:53,772
and was yelling at that somebody who was actually hard of hearing.

848
00:41:54,012 --> 00:41:57,572
And like that's why and he's like yelling like why are like like like like,

849
00:41:57,732 --> 00:41:59,112
wake up, why did you come here to sleep?

850
00:41:59,272 --> 00:42:00,332
And then he got in trouble.

851
00:42:00,412 --> 00:42:03,632
Like, no, that was that person was actually so specific.

852
00:42:03,852 --> 00:42:05,052
Like that's so neat.

853
00:42:05,172 --> 00:42:07,912
I mean, that's like it does make me laugh when like every

854
00:42:08,432 --> 00:42:13,292
every park has its own niche stuff that doesn't show up in a guidebook.

855
00:42:13,852 --> 00:42:19,032
But like Disneyland has like stuff unique to Disney, like, you know, the the

856
00:42:19,032 --> 00:42:24,172
oh, Chef Oscar, then the potato dish he invented and and like the swing dancing

857
00:42:24,172 --> 00:42:30,012
and the thing and your feet and the ducks, like the ducks walk out

858
00:42:30,012 --> 00:42:35,292
and the ducks and the cats and all this stuff like usually the mythology of

859
00:42:35,652 --> 00:42:41,532
an angry, abrasive star search warm up guy is not as charming

860
00:42:41,532 --> 00:42:43,412
as they're being ducks in a pond.

861
00:42:43,492 --> 00:42:44,472
No, it's not.

862
00:42:44,592 --> 00:42:47,912
But it's like and that but that didn't even last as long.

863
00:42:48,012 --> 00:42:50,372
Like the swing dancing has been there for decades.

864
00:42:50,712 --> 00:42:54,552
But I guess I think they thought it was a type like the the warm up guy

865
00:42:54,552 --> 00:42:56,272
who's off his rocker.

866
00:42:56,312 --> 00:42:59,052
They thought it was like a familiar stereotype.

867
00:42:59,512 --> 00:43:03,072
Which is funny, I guess, if you're coming up with these ideas in Glendale,

868
00:43:03,472 --> 00:43:05,412
California, I'd imagine nearing.

869
00:43:05,672 --> 00:43:11,372
But like the middle of the country, maybe if they came to Hollywood,

870
00:43:11,532 --> 00:43:13,172
maybe they saw a sitcom.

871
00:43:13,232 --> 00:43:14,352
I did walk and leap.

872
00:43:14,492 --> 00:43:18,252
There's only a couple little videos like but I did see one.

873
00:43:18,472 --> 00:43:19,612
I saw another one.

874
00:43:19,712 --> 00:43:21,312
I think I had to I was looking at like daily.

875
00:43:21,312 --> 00:43:22,172
It wasn't even YouTube.

876
00:43:22,232 --> 00:43:23,352
It was like Daily Motion.

877
00:43:23,612 --> 00:43:25,072
I found it on or one of those.

878
00:43:25,112 --> 00:43:29,892
Oh, yeah. Obscure, obscure sites because this is so poorly documented.

879
00:43:30,132 --> 00:43:32,972
Yeah. But I do think they toned it down.

880
00:43:32,972 --> 00:43:34,612
It was the date was later.

881
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:36,532
So I think they had to tone down the yelling.

882
00:43:36,532 --> 00:43:39,712
So this is an alien encounter.

883
00:43:39,712 --> 00:43:43,232
Yeah. Scenario where you could see it pre and see it after.

884
00:43:43,412 --> 00:43:47,532
Yeah. Like the Sam Kinnison impression was less coked up, basically.

885
00:43:48,112 --> 00:43:51,952
Yeah. Casey does a lot more heavy lifting at a certain point.

886
00:43:52,012 --> 00:43:56,412
Yeah, for sure. They upped Casey's role, which you know what I like

887
00:43:56,412 --> 00:44:01,212
is the the handing back and forth of the sound stage master control,

888
00:44:01,212 --> 00:44:04,992
like the big box that Steven has that controls the sound.

889
00:44:05,312 --> 00:44:10,152
You know, that little thing, the box that controls all of it, that opens the doors.

890
00:44:10,412 --> 00:44:11,692
You always get that to your lead.

891
00:44:11,832 --> 00:44:14,792
You always let your lead fiddle around with that.

892
00:44:14,792 --> 00:44:15,792
Yeah. Yeah.

893
00:44:15,972 --> 00:44:18,252
So the fact that they're able to like,

894
00:44:18,732 --> 00:44:22,832
I'm actually still not sure how they do that effect of like passing it from

895
00:44:22,832 --> 00:44:28,412
this like, you know, a hologram character essentially right to a real person.

896
00:44:28,492 --> 00:44:33,072
But then like, but it's fun that that sets up the, you know,

897
00:44:33,112 --> 00:44:37,232
like like the back and forth and who's got it and where is it that that sets up

898
00:44:37,232 --> 00:44:41,432
that like like then when then when the kid

899
00:44:41,432 --> 00:44:45,372
has it and like that and he like doesn't know how to operate it.

900
00:44:45,372 --> 00:44:49,472
And that's what makes the set go haywire and the the grease fire shoot off.

901
00:44:49,832 --> 00:44:50,392
Right. Yeah.

902
00:44:50,432 --> 00:44:53,692
Did you catch they say who invents invented the sound stage box?

903
00:44:53,872 --> 00:44:54,972
Did you guys catch this?

904
00:44:55,712 --> 00:44:56,752
No. The inventor.

905
00:44:56,832 --> 00:45:00,212
Yeah, they talk about who invented the box because it's like they do sort of

906
00:45:00,212 --> 00:45:02,312
acknowledge it's sort of a fantastical box.

907
00:45:02,312 --> 00:45:04,492
Nigel Channing.

908
00:45:04,492 --> 00:45:05,572
They tie it together.

909
00:45:05,972 --> 00:45:09,592
You can catch that because he goes, oh, yeah, I got to talk to the creator

910
00:45:09,592 --> 00:45:11,732
of this box. And then he goes, Nigel Channing.

911
00:45:11,832 --> 00:45:14,472
And he throws it away like you were saying he throws a lot of jokes.

912
00:45:14,872 --> 00:45:19,432
So it's referencing Sounds Dangerous and the Imagination Institute.

913
00:45:19,552 --> 00:45:21,652
Yes. At least was open. Right.

914
00:45:21,692 --> 00:45:26,372
So they were this is actually we were talking about how there's a couple

915
00:45:27,012 --> 00:45:28,832
appearances of Nigel Channing now or three.

916
00:45:29,012 --> 00:45:31,632
I forget. I mean, this is just a name only.

917
00:45:31,872 --> 00:45:32,932
Right. He doesn't make it very.

918
00:45:33,172 --> 00:45:35,432
This is the pre-C. Yes.

919
00:45:35,432 --> 00:45:39,872
Tying together that wow, the host of Honey, I Shrunk the Audience.

920
00:45:40,772 --> 00:45:42,812
So you watch Honey, I Shrunk the Audience.

921
00:45:42,932 --> 00:45:46,532
He's handing out the inventor of the year awards, but you don't know what he invented.

922
00:45:46,812 --> 00:45:48,912
Right. And finally, it is answered.

923
00:45:49,032 --> 00:45:49,992
It's answered here.

924
00:45:50,352 --> 00:45:51,632
The man. What did you what's the box?

925
00:45:52,012 --> 00:45:54,912
This the sound stage master control master control box.

926
00:45:54,912 --> 00:45:59,472
Yeah. So he so Nigel Channing did work for Hollywood.

927
00:45:59,472 --> 00:46:01,072
He was like, yeah, there.

928
00:46:01,252 --> 00:46:05,572
Why would there be a different like a chain to open the door and a full,

929
00:46:06,112 --> 00:46:08,752
you know, why would you want like a board for the lighting grid?

930
00:46:08,812 --> 00:46:11,672
Why can't it all be in one remote? Right.

931
00:46:12,192 --> 00:46:13,512
Yeah. So I was shocked.

932
00:46:13,812 --> 00:46:18,512
So Nigel Channing revolutionized, you know, sound stage

933
00:46:18,512 --> 00:46:20,132
care and maintenance.

934
00:46:20,132 --> 00:46:21,772
Yes. With this mechanism.

935
00:46:21,772 --> 00:46:25,412
And they kind of like the crew all like kind of scott.

936
00:46:25,532 --> 00:46:28,792
There's a couple punch lines of like actors,

937
00:46:28,792 --> 00:46:34,652
like because it's always Steven Weber or the kid doing hijinks with that control.

938
00:46:34,772 --> 00:46:39,492
And and there that that control box is the thing that makes stuff go wrong.

939
00:46:39,552 --> 00:46:43,292
You know what I like is when Steven presents that

940
00:46:43,292 --> 00:46:45,612
and he's explaining kind of what it is.

941
00:46:45,632 --> 00:46:48,712
And he said that joke about like it's kind of like your remote control at home.

942
00:46:48,712 --> 00:46:52,572
But sorry, folks, even this can't control your VCR clock.

943
00:46:53,692 --> 00:46:55,352
And we can reset your VCR.

944
00:46:55,532 --> 00:46:58,232
Oh, yeah. They only had a couple of years left of that.

945
00:46:58,252 --> 00:47:00,472
Still worked. Still worked at the time.

946
00:47:00,592 --> 00:47:04,112
You still has the VCR, even if it's not your primary mechanism.

947
00:47:05,192 --> 00:47:07,012
And that's true. I don't know how to reset.

948
00:47:07,472 --> 00:47:09,532
Yeah. The cost is

949
00:47:09,532 --> 00:47:12,032
Nora Dunn, who's the costuming woman.

950
00:47:12,112 --> 00:47:13,532
She laughs at that.

951
00:47:13,912 --> 00:47:14,812
The character laughs at that.

952
00:47:14,812 --> 00:47:16,492
She's the only one. The character.

953
00:47:16,992 --> 00:47:20,072
The people in the real people in the audience don't.

954
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:22,212
But Nora Dunn, Nora Dunn laughs at it.

955
00:47:22,292 --> 00:47:23,572
Right. The false costumer.

956
00:47:23,732 --> 00:47:25,952
Yeah. That's the thing with the costume department also.

957
00:47:26,092 --> 00:47:32,872
OK, we've it's a show with like a what kinds of characters are going to be in a in a diner.

958
00:47:33,152 --> 00:47:36,652
There's you know, you need like you need you need aprons and you need the paid

959
00:47:36,652 --> 00:47:41,432
maybe like a a cop comes in or a New York firefighter or whatever.

960
00:47:41,732 --> 00:47:43,632
A couple of regulars reading the paper. Yeah. Yeah.

961
00:47:43,632 --> 00:47:48,392
But why does why does Nora Dunn need to operate from this like

962
00:47:48,392 --> 00:47:54,172
endless rack of clothing with like, you know, like a like a marching band

963
00:47:54,172 --> 00:47:58,812
uniforms and like, you know, like the 50s space alien in silver.

964
00:47:59,152 --> 00:48:02,352
When are they going to need that on hand for daughter up?

965
00:48:02,532 --> 00:48:06,932
Well, I think it was just holdover from like, remember, the tram used to go

966
00:48:06,932 --> 00:48:10,532
through the costuming bill that would ride through the costuming building.

967
00:48:10,832 --> 00:48:11,832
Giant windows.

968
00:48:11,832 --> 00:48:13,592
You could see all these costume racks.

969
00:48:13,872 --> 00:48:16,472
So I'm wondering if they're just like, well, we got all these costume racks.

970
00:48:16,472 --> 00:48:17,652
We may as well use them.

971
00:48:17,772 --> 00:48:22,012
And the productions have left nothing is shooting here anymore.

972
00:48:22,072 --> 00:48:24,792
What I don't get and Christina are long gone.

973
00:48:24,952 --> 00:48:29,112
What I do like about that that long thing is it's just I think it's probably a setup

974
00:48:29,112 --> 00:48:32,412
for the joke of like Warwick Davis being inside of the clothes.

975
00:48:32,812 --> 00:48:34,792
Him popping out is such a funny thing.

976
00:48:34,992 --> 00:48:37,072
Right. That's such a weird.

977
00:48:37,512 --> 00:48:39,872
It's the big it's that big tall costume.

978
00:48:39,872 --> 00:48:42,792
And then like he's only fill in the pants.

979
00:48:43,152 --> 00:48:43,652
Yeah.

980
00:48:43,652 --> 00:48:46,312
So I like it's just for the joke, I think.

981
00:48:46,472 --> 00:48:47,352
Sure. Yeah.

982
00:48:47,432 --> 00:48:51,472
But when I like the casting, I love when I mean, it's nice to see him.

983
00:48:51,472 --> 00:48:52,612
Yeah. Yeah.

984
00:48:52,612 --> 00:48:56,112
And he says, like, I got to get over to Star Tours.

985
00:48:56,172 --> 00:48:59,332
Right. They're just so in love with the inside.

986
00:48:59,852 --> 00:49:05,952
I think they they feel like like people know the Disney MGM Studios world

987
00:49:05,952 --> 00:49:07,032
and they're going to want us.

988
00:49:07,032 --> 00:49:11,852
It's like the beginning of like self aware, sort of meta comedy almost happening

989
00:49:11,852 --> 00:49:12,572
within the shows.

990
00:49:12,892 --> 00:49:16,272
And it's very 90s like self aware meta comedy.

991
00:49:16,352 --> 00:49:20,532
What I don't get is like if you have Nora done, why wouldn't you have her be like

992
00:49:20,532 --> 00:49:21,372
a sassy witch?

993
00:49:21,472 --> 00:49:23,492
Why wouldn't you have her be another actor?

994
00:49:23,892 --> 00:49:26,912
Like why should I feel like she barely gets to do anything as the costumer?

995
00:49:26,972 --> 00:49:28,032
She gets some funny physical.

996
00:49:28,352 --> 00:49:30,172
SNL. Yeah.

997
00:49:30,592 --> 00:49:34,492
She was my neighbor once and really Woodland Hill.

998
00:49:34,552 --> 00:49:36,552
She lived down. I discovered while trick or treating.

999
00:49:37,072 --> 00:49:38,392
She lived on my block.

1000
00:49:38,552 --> 00:49:39,652
No, I've done. Yeah.

1001
00:49:39,652 --> 00:49:40,932
Crazy. I don't think she does anymore.

1002
00:49:41,032 --> 00:49:42,832
So don't go. Hey, creeps.

1003
00:49:42,832 --> 00:49:43,832
Don't go looking for Nora.

1004
00:49:43,972 --> 00:49:44,452
Yeah.

1005
00:49:44,552 --> 00:49:45,752
Who else?

1006
00:49:46,192 --> 00:49:48,152
All of this.

1007
00:49:48,312 --> 00:49:51,772
Did you know all of these sequences directed by Peyton Reed?

1008
00:49:52,472 --> 00:49:54,852
He did this to. Yeah, he's done.

1009
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:56,532
Yeah, he did a couple of different things for the part.

1010
00:49:56,532 --> 00:49:58,012
The back to the future stuff.

1011
00:49:58,072 --> 00:50:03,552
Yeah. And he was like the go to guy and the go to go for like,

1012
00:50:03,612 --> 00:50:08,752
you know, like filming like small size scenarios, whether it be shrinking

1013
00:50:08,752 --> 00:50:10,712
or just filming Warwick Davis.

1014
00:50:10,812 --> 00:50:12,532
Yep. Popping out of a costume.

1015
00:50:12,812 --> 00:50:16,712
Would have been doing the the UCB TV show around this time, too, I believe.

1016
00:50:16,892 --> 00:50:17,492
Yeah, sure.

1017
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:20,092
And I didn't realize this.

1018
00:50:20,232 --> 00:50:21,912
Bob Gur worked on that train effect.

1019
00:50:22,912 --> 00:50:24,472
OK, that's because he's Mr.

1020
00:50:24,652 --> 00:50:26,052
Vehicle. Oh, yeah.

1021
00:50:26,472 --> 00:50:27,172
So that's the thing.

1022
00:50:27,272 --> 00:50:31,252
Like you I mean, it's legitimately shocking when it plows into the set.

1023
00:50:31,272 --> 00:50:33,232
And you have the question like, was this supposed?

1024
00:50:33,232 --> 00:50:35,132
I mean, you know, it's all in effect. Right.

1025
00:50:35,132 --> 00:50:39,932
Like, but then watching like the clockwork with which it goes backward

1026
00:50:39,932 --> 00:50:43,132
and resets and that stuff's fun when they show you.

1027
00:50:43,232 --> 00:50:45,432
And look, it's a it's going back to the place.

1028
00:50:45,732 --> 00:50:48,632
It's going to they're going to do this 20 more times a day.

1029
00:50:48,952 --> 00:50:52,232
Yeah, it's not his greatest.

1030
00:50:52,232 --> 00:50:53,572
No vehicle.

1031
00:50:53,632 --> 00:50:55,432
But it's in there.

1032
00:50:55,752 --> 00:51:00,852
I mean, a lot of talent went into this.

1033
00:51:01,032 --> 00:51:03,052
Yeah, it just maybe didn't come together.

1034
00:51:03,232 --> 00:51:04,972
In the way they had to.

1035
00:51:05,092 --> 00:51:08,672
I think they had a lot of ideas and it just didn't like

1036
00:51:08,672 --> 00:51:14,812
it feels like just like a flurry of notes and people wanting different things.

1037
00:51:14,852 --> 00:51:18,732
And we have to like we have to promote ABC and we have to promote

1038
00:51:18,732 --> 00:51:20,412
Steven Weber being in the family.

1039
00:51:21,432 --> 00:51:23,592
And yeah, there are too many cooks.

1040
00:51:23,892 --> 00:51:26,932
There is ironically within the world of order of too many cooks.

1041
00:51:27,212 --> 00:51:28,612
There is a fondness for it.

1042
00:51:28,612 --> 00:51:30,932
And as like I said, there was that sure I didn't even realize

1043
00:51:30,932 --> 00:51:34,212
there's a community where they sell those shirts about Stuntman Steve.

1044
00:51:34,332 --> 00:51:38,752
And I found a Facebook group about that, like how I found the Pleasure Island.

1045
00:51:38,852 --> 00:51:40,992
Yeah, yeah. There is a tribute Facebook group.

1046
00:51:41,192 --> 00:51:42,832
It's it's a, you know, a couple hundred strong,

1047
00:51:43,332 --> 00:51:46,772
but they are very much into this ride, this attraction.

1048
00:51:47,172 --> 00:51:49,612
Really? And they like post about it's pretty active.

1049
00:51:49,832 --> 00:51:50,672
Like I had to answer.

1050
00:51:50,812 --> 00:51:54,092
I had to answer like a pretty easy like Stuntman Steve question of like,

1051
00:51:54,432 --> 00:51:56,392
who are we yelling at through the megaphone?

1052
00:51:56,392 --> 00:51:58,512
And I wrote Stuntman Steve, because that's how you have to get

1053
00:51:58,512 --> 00:52:00,012
into these closed Facebook groups.

1054
00:52:00,012 --> 00:52:03,792
Oh, yeah. Thank God you didn't have to say like Nora Dunn's characters.

1055
00:52:04,312 --> 00:52:05,292
No, yeah, they don't want to.

1056
00:52:05,292 --> 00:52:08,132
I think you don't even say that you'd have to like zoom into her ID

1057
00:52:08,132 --> 00:52:10,092
badge or whatever to write.

1058
00:52:10,092 --> 00:52:14,812
But yeah, they just there'll be people post like, hey, remember how good this ride was?

1059
00:52:14,972 --> 00:52:19,012
And this traction was and people be like, amen, this is my favorite attraction.

1060
00:52:19,212 --> 00:52:19,852
You bring it back.

1061
00:52:20,352 --> 00:52:21,352
They should. Yeah, we should. Yep.

1062
00:52:21,472 --> 00:52:23,452
That's a lot. That's a very common thing.

1063
00:52:23,572 --> 00:52:26,692
Like the like rides ever come back basically.

1064
00:52:27,172 --> 00:52:27,592
And wait, wait, wait.

1065
00:52:27,712 --> 00:52:29,812
Yes, it never happens.

1066
00:52:29,812 --> 00:52:33,972
And like, why would it be this of all the things?

1067
00:52:33,972 --> 00:52:36,332
I don't know. But there's people that have a lot of affection for this.

1068
00:52:36,452 --> 00:52:38,472
I think a lot of people enjoy the humor.

1069
00:52:38,772 --> 00:52:39,872
They enjoy the comedy.

1070
00:52:40,852 --> 00:52:44,772
I like if like I noticed there were people posting about like

1071
00:52:44,772 --> 00:52:48,492
they like showing themselves like

1072
00:52:48,492 --> 00:52:52,912
like ringing the bell, like pull like pulling the crank.

1073
00:52:52,912 --> 00:52:55,332
Right. To do the like quiet on set.

1074
00:52:56,332 --> 00:53:00,112
Bell and that gag where they bring up like the bulky, you know,

1075
00:53:00,112 --> 00:53:03,412
the biggest guy in the audience and he can't do it.

1076
00:53:03,412 --> 00:53:05,812
They like lock it like the sword in the stone. Right.

1077
00:53:05,832 --> 00:53:08,392
But then the kid reaches up and does it easily.

1078
00:53:08,392 --> 00:53:09,932
And that's a good photo op.

1079
00:53:10,072 --> 00:53:11,332
That's like a thing that's really fun.

1080
00:53:11,372 --> 00:53:13,032
You don't want to remember. Yeah.

1081
00:53:13,052 --> 00:53:17,332
Which any if anybody has one of those, you know, send it to us.

1082
00:53:17,352 --> 00:53:18,432
But guess the ride.

1083
00:53:20,052 --> 00:53:21,992
For sure. Anything has to ring that bell.

1084
00:53:21,992 --> 00:53:25,672
If you have any of this material, if you guys in this attraction,

1085
00:53:25,752 --> 00:53:28,532
please send us those photos and any merch because there's so

1086
00:53:28,532 --> 00:53:30,012
lack of of old.

1087
00:53:30,352 --> 00:53:31,352
Not a lot. Yeah, I checked eBay.

1088
00:53:31,932 --> 00:53:33,472
There were photos on that Facebook group.

1089
00:53:33,632 --> 00:53:35,692
Apparently, when they took this down,

1090
00:53:36,132 --> 00:53:39,472
there was a small contingent, like 20 people who took the megaphones

1091
00:53:39,472 --> 00:53:41,892
and started yelling at the construction workers,

1092
00:53:42,032 --> 00:53:43,892
like to try to get them to stop.

1093
00:53:44,232 --> 00:53:45,252
It's crazy.

1094
00:53:45,392 --> 00:53:48,772
Which if you if the show you get to see union people

1095
00:53:48,772 --> 00:53:51,472
at work within the show, that should teach you.

1096
00:53:51,472 --> 00:53:53,092
It is not their fault. Right.

1097
00:53:53,232 --> 00:53:53,512
It's not.

1098
00:53:53,712 --> 00:53:56,712
There are photos of them at the fences with the megaphone,

1099
00:53:56,712 --> 00:53:59,712
the soundstage megaphones yelling at these construction workers.

1100
00:53:59,932 --> 00:54:01,512
Stop, stop. Save the ride.

1101
00:54:02,132 --> 00:54:04,492
But they had to cut and they would say like cut and print.

1102
00:54:04,512 --> 00:54:06,692
They would still use the terminology of directing.

1103
00:54:06,692 --> 00:54:08,492
Well, cut, stop.

1104
00:54:08,992 --> 00:54:09,872
Stop the take.

1105
00:54:09,932 --> 00:54:11,712
They're not using it correctly.

1106
00:54:11,912 --> 00:54:13,152
Right. They're just using it.

1107
00:54:13,152 --> 00:54:14,532
Yeah. But they did this.

1108
00:54:14,892 --> 00:54:16,092
Hey, asshole, print.

1109
00:54:16,332 --> 00:54:19,672
Yeah. For a couple of weeks, apparently, they were at they were at this

1110
00:54:19,672 --> 00:54:20,772
to try to save the ride.

1111
00:54:21,432 --> 00:54:24,372
But I hope they didn't like throw the cones.

1112
00:54:24,692 --> 00:54:27,012
I mean, they're wearing hard hats, so it's fine.

1113
00:54:27,232 --> 00:54:28,832
But yeah, they're not afraid of some.

1114
00:54:29,052 --> 00:54:30,612
And then they lose the cones.

1115
00:54:30,752 --> 00:54:34,512
That's dumb to like you should hold on to that thing,

1116
00:54:34,572 --> 00:54:35,992
especially knowing the ride is going to go away.

1117
00:54:35,992 --> 00:54:37,432
Right. Because I can't find any on eBay.

1118
00:54:37,692 --> 00:54:40,212
But they did like they kept the buildings intact because isn't this

1119
00:54:40,212 --> 00:54:43,212
what eventually became who wants to be a millionaire, which we just talked.

1120
00:54:43,372 --> 00:54:44,112
Oh, yeah. Yeah, of course.

1121
00:54:44,232 --> 00:54:46,272
I just like they kept the sound stages.

1122
00:54:46,632 --> 00:54:48,032
Yeah. But they were pulling stuff in.

1123
00:54:48,092 --> 00:54:50,692
And obviously that train effect was something you that was going to take

1124
00:54:50,692 --> 00:54:54,132
some construction, I think they had to widen the wall to get it out again.

1125
00:54:54,432 --> 00:54:57,892
Oh, they know they had to like clear a big path to you.

1126
00:54:57,912 --> 00:55:01,492
And then they had to take down the famous elephant doors,

1127
00:55:02,012 --> 00:55:03,992
not the elephant doors. Right. Yeah.

1128
00:55:04,072 --> 00:55:09,172
This is a thing on the Universal Tour, too, like the terminology like, oh, yeah.

1129
00:55:09,252 --> 00:55:12,492
You know, kids, do you know those aren't just called doors?

1130
00:55:12,672 --> 00:55:14,492
They're called elephant doors.

1131
00:55:14,492 --> 00:55:17,432
And it's glazed over one weird little Jason.

1132
00:55:17,732 --> 00:55:20,332
And like, I will remember this writing it

1133
00:55:20,332 --> 00:55:22,312
in your little notebook. Yeah.

1134
00:55:23,272 --> 00:55:25,012
Yeah. That was me for sure.

1135
00:55:25,292 --> 00:55:29,052
Yeah. But this is like the people not

1136
00:55:29,052 --> 00:55:32,312
caring anymore about how

1137
00:55:32,312 --> 00:55:35,652
stuff that you can and you feel you can feel it happening like with that,

1138
00:55:35,972 --> 00:55:41,812
that green screen, the presentation that like they lay out green screen

1139
00:55:41,812 --> 00:55:45,592
as if that's something you're totally unfamiliar with.

1140
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:47,912
And of course, like a couple years down the line, you know, from DVD,

1141
00:55:47,912 --> 00:55:49,852
special features, green screen is everywhere.

1142
00:55:50,612 --> 00:55:54,632
And they totally shit that thing where Steve Stevens, like he's wearing a green

1143
00:55:54,632 --> 00:55:57,232
sweater. So when the peppers goes to 50 walks in front of it,

1144
00:55:57,232 --> 00:56:02,012
then you see him on the monitor and he his body disappears. Right.

1145
00:56:02,112 --> 00:56:06,312
And then he's and then he then he walks back and like, oh, sorry, lost my head there.

1146
00:56:06,372 --> 00:56:12,792
But like, yeah, also, and it's almost like the only thing he didn't lose

1147
00:56:12,792 --> 00:56:15,172
is his head. Yeah. Right.

1148
00:56:15,172 --> 00:56:16,692
It's actually the only thing that remained.

1149
00:56:17,032 --> 00:56:19,772
So the joke is doesn't quite work.

1150
00:56:19,912 --> 00:56:24,812
Has some issues. But I think mainly they I mean, they stopped doing

1151
00:56:24,812 --> 00:56:29,972
things like this, like the behind the scenes of the fake show.

1152
00:56:30,612 --> 00:56:34,192
Like, yeah, like maybe you'd be interested in how a real movie was made.

1153
00:56:34,192 --> 00:56:38,332
But here's our hypothetical sitcom you will never see.

1154
00:56:38,412 --> 00:56:40,292
And you could feel the audience going.

1155
00:56:41,712 --> 00:56:44,612
So when does when do we see the show?

1156
00:56:45,012 --> 00:56:47,272
Is this coming on ABC? Yeah.

1157
00:56:47,432 --> 00:56:49,712
Did you did you? This is unconfirmed.

1158
00:56:49,712 --> 00:56:52,612
But I read this is crazy. But I read that who wrote?

1159
00:56:52,772 --> 00:56:54,732
Did you read who wrote it? No.

1160
00:56:55,012 --> 00:56:57,592
Norman Lear. Norman Lear.

1161
00:56:57,792 --> 00:56:58,992
Yes. How can that?

1162
00:56:59,332 --> 00:57:00,732
That's why I said it's unconfirmed.

1163
00:57:00,792 --> 00:57:02,372
The Peyton Reed thing, I think you can confirm.

1164
00:57:02,612 --> 00:57:05,292
But like someone says that I don't think it's crazy.

1165
00:57:05,292 --> 00:57:08,732
I don't know. One of the message boards on WDW Magic.

1166
00:57:08,772 --> 00:57:11,712
And you go deep into the magic and the message boards.

1167
00:57:11,712 --> 00:57:14,172
Maybe just like, oh, Disney.

1168
00:57:14,592 --> 00:57:16,352
I don't know. Other information.

1169
00:57:16,592 --> 00:57:20,552
This is just somebody's claims that Norman Lear wrote the dialogue for this.

1170
00:57:21,192 --> 00:57:22,112
It seems insane.

1171
00:57:22,172 --> 00:57:24,952
But I guess I could see where it's like, oh, we were going to do like a classic

1172
00:57:24,952 --> 00:57:27,792
sitcom, so we want to have that type of pattern.

1173
00:57:28,312 --> 00:57:30,432
Obviously, I don't think he's done any other theme park work.

1174
00:57:30,452 --> 00:57:33,332
So this seems crazy. Like a consultant thing.

1175
00:57:33,792 --> 00:57:36,612
They like brought him down there. He wanted a free trip to Florida.

1176
00:57:36,612 --> 00:57:40,172
He gave one note and then was like, very seems right.

1177
00:57:40,192 --> 00:57:41,012
Seems possible.

1178
00:57:41,012 --> 00:57:46,252
Like if you give me the written by credit, I'll pretend to pay attention to it.

1179
00:57:46,252 --> 00:57:46,952
Right. Yeah.

1180
00:57:47,132 --> 00:57:48,752
They still have to give him a lot of money.

1181
00:57:48,752 --> 00:57:50,932
And yeah, they had to get him and his family.

1182
00:57:51,012 --> 00:57:53,472
He's like, oh, my grandkids want to go to Disney World.

1183
00:57:53,552 --> 00:57:57,992
Maybe the show is maybe order up is a like

1184
00:57:57,992 --> 00:58:00,712
was like a failed normally.

1185
00:58:00,872 --> 00:58:01,452
I would have his.

1186
00:58:01,752 --> 00:58:05,852
Yeah, maybe that's what they mean by like they like found like the one show of his

1187
00:58:05,852 --> 00:58:06,792
that didn't take off.

1188
00:58:07,112 --> 00:58:11,252
It's just a note, a sentence he wrote on the back of a Musso and Frank's receipt.

1189
00:58:11,732 --> 00:58:17,392
Like, I don't know, maybe something in a diner, a guy moves back from the big city.

1190
00:58:17,612 --> 00:58:18,192
Yeah.

1191
00:58:18,952 --> 00:58:23,372
More than other episodes of order up, if like we get it, we get a train

1192
00:58:23,372 --> 00:58:26,012
crashing through a wall in this one and a flash fire.

1193
00:58:26,792 --> 00:58:30,712
Like was this was it always a that seems like a season finale?

1194
00:58:30,712 --> 00:58:33,052
Yeah. I mean, so yeah, what was it?

1195
00:58:33,372 --> 00:58:36,012
Allie, if you destroyed the said right.

1196
00:58:36,612 --> 00:58:38,732
He was also what did you he was a lawyer?

1197
00:58:38,992 --> 00:58:40,312
Yeah, he was a lawyer.

1198
00:58:40,472 --> 00:58:41,832
And then he became a short order cook.

1199
00:58:41,832 --> 00:58:44,672
He came back to take over his family's diner.

1200
00:58:44,692 --> 00:58:46,992
Right. So he kind of was the manager and the cook.

1201
00:58:46,992 --> 00:58:49,472
And he was kind of doing a little every he grew up in the diner.

1202
00:58:49,492 --> 00:58:50,932
Right. So he knew how to run it.

1203
00:58:50,932 --> 00:58:51,932
Yeah. He knew how to do stuff.

1204
00:58:52,132 --> 00:58:55,672
I never get an actual scene of Stephen Webber on.

1205
00:58:55,812 --> 00:58:57,412
He's just like, here we are on the set.

1206
00:58:57,412 --> 00:58:59,252
And he tells you the back story. Right.

1207
00:58:59,252 --> 00:59:02,992
And then all you see is like the set come to life and the microwave door

1208
00:59:02,992 --> 00:59:03,972
opening and closing.

1209
00:59:04,192 --> 00:59:07,692
So you don't know what his character is like and how the show,

1210
00:59:07,752 --> 00:59:09,912
what the rest of the show would be if it existed.

1211
00:59:10,012 --> 00:59:14,812
I mean, my guess is that in the pilot, he's begrudging and then like

1212
00:59:14,812 --> 00:59:19,452
he's begrudgingly coming back and then something makes him glad he stayed.

1213
00:59:19,532 --> 00:59:21,072
Like the diner is rewarding.

1214
00:59:21,512 --> 00:59:25,372
You know what? Probably his high school sweetheart is like a teacher in the town.

1215
00:59:25,392 --> 00:59:28,112
And maybe they will finally get back together.

1216
00:59:28,112 --> 00:59:31,052
Unless they all of them get burnt in a grease fire,

1217
00:59:31,052 --> 00:59:34,852
who seemingly happens frequently in the.

1218
00:59:34,912 --> 00:59:39,292
You know, actually, I will also say I think that it's nice when they like

1219
00:59:39,292 --> 00:59:41,652
give the pyro like lever.

1220
00:59:41,852 --> 00:59:42,892
I mean, it's silly. They make it.

1221
00:59:42,972 --> 00:59:46,452
They they make it like you're setting off dynamite in the 30s cartoon,

1222
00:59:46,452 --> 00:59:51,212
but that they let the like the littlest girl in the audience like start the pyro.

1223
00:59:51,232 --> 00:59:52,672
Oh, sure. That's pretty cute.

1224
00:59:52,732 --> 00:59:55,892
That also if you had a video with that, I mean, that'd be great.

1225
00:59:57,352 --> 01:00:01,212
But like, I don't know, I'm just I'm worried for the lawyer and his and his new bride.

1226
01:00:01,372 --> 01:00:07,692
If I was if I was making it, I would make the season finale be

1227
01:00:07,692 --> 01:00:12,892
Steven Webber's ex comes back from the big city and tries to coax him back.

1228
01:00:13,172 --> 01:00:14,932
He tries to go to him back to the big city.

1229
01:00:15,052 --> 01:00:16,912
You can tell he's really thinking about it.

1230
01:00:16,912 --> 01:00:19,192
Like he really almost might do it.

1231
01:00:19,192 --> 01:00:21,972
And then the season premiere is the second part.

1232
01:00:21,972 --> 01:00:23,872
And he decides to stay in the town.

1233
01:00:23,932 --> 01:00:25,232
So it's like Jersey girl.

1234
01:00:25,232 --> 01:00:27,692
Yeah, kind of like a Jersey girl sort of thing.

1235
01:00:27,692 --> 01:00:31,592
And I do I think the ex girlfriend, the big city ex girlfriend

1236
01:00:31,592 --> 01:00:36,512
should be like Laura Flint Boyle or like who was in dogma.

1237
01:00:36,672 --> 01:00:39,112
Linda, if you're into Fiorentino, Fiorentino.

1238
01:00:39,272 --> 01:00:41,532
Yeah. Good casting. Yeah.

1239
01:00:41,632 --> 01:00:44,892
Thank you. Do you think you could procure work

1240
01:00:44,892 --> 01:00:49,552
in the industry by writing a spec of order up the

1241
01:00:49,952 --> 01:00:55,392
non-existent show from the briefly open attraction soundstage with Steven Webber?

1242
01:00:56,092 --> 01:00:59,372
I don't. It's kind of sort of a state the way people write, like, you know,

1243
01:00:59,372 --> 01:01:03,132
here's my like say by the bell spec or whatever like this.

1244
01:01:03,132 --> 01:01:05,392
This sort of like a hook to it in a way.

1245
01:01:05,392 --> 01:01:07,812
Yeah, it is like an interesting hook to it.

1246
01:01:07,892 --> 01:01:10,692
Yeah, I don't know. Yeah, we were taught all of order up.

1247
01:01:10,812 --> 01:01:15,132
There'd be like the one executive who would go, oh, my God, you're kidding me.

1248
01:01:15,132 --> 01:01:17,972
I think I would have even their better luck.

1249
01:01:19,112 --> 01:01:24,232
How uploading it and making it go viral than having it an actual sample

1250
01:01:24,232 --> 01:01:29,652
that an agent or manager like in the way that people write, like the Seinfeld 2000

1251
01:01:29,652 --> 01:01:32,092
score or whatever, like write a Seinfeld episode.

1252
01:01:32,272 --> 01:01:34,572
Also, I'm going to guess probably not a good thing to write a spec for,

1253
01:01:34,712 --> 01:01:37,832
because I know the show doesn't exist and there's no way of knowing order up.

1254
01:01:37,832 --> 01:01:39,292
Probably all white cast.

1255
01:01:39,712 --> 01:01:41,092
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

1256
01:01:41,772 --> 01:01:44,532
If it was if it was 98. Yeah. Yeah.

1257
01:01:44,752 --> 01:01:48,752
But weren't all sitcoms right at the time.

1258
01:01:48,752 --> 01:01:51,672
No way of knowing. No way of knowing.

1259
01:01:52,752 --> 01:01:53,552
Sounds like Steven Weber.

1260
01:01:54,732 --> 01:01:56,552
I mean, do we do?

1261
01:01:56,712 --> 01:01:58,692
Do we agree with the Facebook group?

1262
01:01:58,812 --> 01:02:01,592
Do we want soundstage with Steven Weber to?

1263
01:02:02,412 --> 01:02:06,552
Well, look, I didn't see it as a kid or adult.

1264
01:02:06,812 --> 01:02:11,932
So I will never know exactly what the situation was or how the experience was.

1265
01:02:12,952 --> 01:02:14,872
So from just describing it,

1266
01:02:14,872 --> 01:02:18,332
maybe it doesn't sound so great and worthy of bringing back.

1267
01:02:18,492 --> 01:02:22,652
But maybe in the play pavilion, when you get to relive old rides,

1268
01:02:23,612 --> 01:02:25,572
maybe that's a place for it in Epcot.

1269
01:02:25,652 --> 01:02:29,112
Yeah. Once a month, you can go and see the show.

1270
01:02:29,132 --> 01:02:31,392
The VR in a VRE way.

1271
01:02:31,972 --> 01:02:36,932
It definitely I think it was one of the things I absorbed through osmosis

1272
01:02:36,932 --> 01:02:41,552
of like soaking in all of MGM Studio, like all the old signs and the old,

1273
01:02:41,552 --> 01:02:46,372
like, you know, lights, camera action, like Hollywood.

1274
01:02:46,772 --> 01:02:48,472
Here's the here's how it's made.

1275
01:02:49,152 --> 01:02:54,432
I think I did have an affection for all of that and probably pushed me

1276
01:02:54,432 --> 01:02:57,472
into the arms of the entertainment industry. Right.

1277
01:02:57,692 --> 01:03:02,592
Unforgiving in a way this helped in as much as like seven attractions all helped.

1278
01:03:02,792 --> 01:03:05,152
Yeah, they all kind of like meshed together.

1279
01:03:05,272 --> 01:03:07,712
Soundstage is the reason you live in Los Angeles.

1280
01:03:07,832 --> 01:03:10,812
Maybe I got to go see the real sound stages.

1281
01:03:11,032 --> 01:03:15,092
That's also that on the way in that you're in the lobby

1282
01:03:15,092 --> 01:03:19,972
and you were looking at framed photos of sound state, like famous sound stages.

1283
01:03:20,072 --> 01:03:24,292
Here's Pinewood and here's where they film Mary Poppins.

1284
01:03:24,632 --> 01:03:27,152
But sound stages are just building.

1285
01:03:27,352 --> 01:03:30,412
Right. I love them. I love sound stages, especially when they have a plaque

1286
01:03:30,412 --> 01:03:32,292
that says everything that's shot there.

1287
01:03:32,672 --> 01:03:33,752
I'll stop and read the plaque.

1288
01:03:33,932 --> 01:03:35,772
And I was like Conan.

1289
01:03:36,032 --> 01:03:40,132
I got to work like what was the white, you know, way Goonies was filmed in here.

1290
01:03:40,132 --> 01:03:42,792
Sure. It's like weird and fun to think about.

1291
01:03:43,032 --> 01:03:45,272
I mean, Robin on the Warner Brothers live. Yeah.

1292
01:03:45,472 --> 01:03:46,832
Oh, they must have taken it over.

1293
01:03:47,052 --> 01:03:50,272
So many things. So pretty much it'll be like gone with the wind.

1294
01:03:50,312 --> 01:03:51,052
We're going with something.

1295
01:03:51,052 --> 01:03:53,032
Casablanca, Batman, Robin.

1296
01:03:53,032 --> 01:03:55,332
Yeah, it's my favorite.

1297
01:03:55,352 --> 01:03:58,272
Ever used the famous Long Beach Dome.

1298
01:03:59,112 --> 01:04:02,972
Yes. The cruise ship terminal formerly home of the Spruce Goose.

1299
01:04:03,012 --> 01:04:08,512
Now the home of a pre-gaming carnival cruise

1300
01:04:08,512 --> 01:04:09,452
slide passengers.

1301
01:04:09,932 --> 01:04:10,352
It does.

1302
01:04:10,772 --> 01:04:13,972
So when I put that in the row of

1303
01:04:13,972 --> 01:04:17,732
some soundstage pictures, like because otherwise it's just you're looking at like

1304
01:04:17,732 --> 01:04:19,272
10 tan buildings.

1305
01:04:19,272 --> 01:04:22,772
It's like the like the GM plant and test track.

1306
01:04:23,112 --> 01:04:26,192
You're looking at a bunch of like industrial roads.

1307
01:04:26,592 --> 01:04:30,012
Like this was the peak era of like,

1308
01:04:30,012 --> 01:04:32,552
look, a road, a field, a warehouse.

1309
01:04:33,212 --> 01:04:36,912
Somebody claims on the Facebook group that you could buy those famous

1310
01:04:37,032 --> 01:04:39,432
little toys of those famous sound stages.

1311
01:04:39,972 --> 01:04:43,552
So you could buy a little Pinewood toy in a gift shop.

1312
01:04:43,692 --> 01:04:45,652
That probably stopped pretty quickly.

1313
01:04:45,832 --> 01:04:46,292
I would think.

1314
01:04:46,512 --> 01:04:50,452
Make your own penny type like they like molded out a little

1315
01:04:50,452 --> 01:04:53,152
build a toy so you could own Pinewood and you can own

1316
01:04:53,152 --> 01:04:57,192
and then all the official soundstage from Soundstage with Steven Weber.

1317
01:04:57,552 --> 01:05:01,252
You can own, you know, stage eight of that.

1318
01:05:01,352 --> 01:05:03,952
Warner Brothers were step by step was filmed.

1319
01:05:04,172 --> 01:05:06,392
Wow. Just so it was like the early.

1320
01:05:06,432 --> 01:05:09,512
Tea walked inside this miniature fake building.

1321
01:05:09,572 --> 01:05:11,752
There should be a Park Stars of the soundstage.

1322
01:05:11,832 --> 01:05:14,552
You know, I like park specific merch.

1323
01:05:14,672 --> 01:05:15,432
I know.

1324
01:05:15,952 --> 01:05:17,512
But would you love this?

1325
01:05:17,512 --> 01:05:17,932
Yeah.

1326
01:05:18,072 --> 01:05:18,952
I mean, it's pretty.

1327
01:05:18,952 --> 01:05:20,152
Oh, I would buy this.

1328
01:05:20,232 --> 01:05:21,412
It's pretty wonderfully.

1329
01:05:21,652 --> 01:05:21,952
I know.

1330
01:05:22,152 --> 01:05:25,872
I think from Soundstage, I own the soundstage.

1331
01:05:25,892 --> 01:05:32,312
Like also that the sign off of a pay.

1332
01:05:32,672 --> 01:05:35,612
Thanks for coming and I'll see you on the soundstage.

1333
01:05:35,612 --> 01:05:36,072
Right.

1334
01:05:36,412 --> 01:05:37,132
Little ones.

1335
01:05:37,212 --> 01:05:40,552
Why am I really?

1336
01:05:40,692 --> 01:05:43,612
Am I going to see Steven Weber on a soundstage?

1337
01:05:43,692 --> 01:05:44,612
No, that is not.

1338
01:05:44,632 --> 01:05:45,972
That's far from guaranteed.

1339
01:05:46,152 --> 01:05:46,452
Yeah.

1340
01:05:46,452 --> 01:05:47,112
Now you might.

1341
01:05:47,632 --> 01:05:48,812
I'd love to.

1342
01:05:48,932 --> 01:05:52,052
Oh, the especially after this, because now I'd be able to bring it up like,

1343
01:05:52,412 --> 01:05:56,372
yeah, I am a big Soundstage fan, though I just hope he doesn't listen to it

1344
01:05:56,372 --> 01:05:59,112
because we'll know I've said some derogatory things.

1345
01:05:59,352 --> 01:06:00,192
He seems cool.

1346
01:06:00,592 --> 01:06:03,052
He seems like he's so he did some funnier dying.

1347
01:06:03,452 --> 01:06:05,632
So I was going to ask if he ever came through there.

1348
01:06:05,672 --> 01:06:06,292
He did.

1349
01:06:06,292 --> 01:06:08,212
I forget what the he was in some.

1350
01:06:08,312 --> 01:06:09,712
He was in a video called shit.

1351
01:06:10,112 --> 01:06:17,032
My Republicans say, which was a very, very, very, very time a reference to the

1352
01:06:17,032 --> 01:06:21,952
Twitter and then like it's all also imagine what it would like watching a

1353
01:06:21,952 --> 01:06:27,652
video from 2012 of crazy Republican quotes, like whatever Santorum was saying.

1354
01:06:27,892 --> 01:06:31,372
Imagine how that compares to the pure batch.

1355
01:06:31,472 --> 01:06:32,452
It's the blood in soil.

1356
01:06:33,932 --> 01:06:36,272
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1357
01:06:36,272 --> 01:06:37,092
Funny today.

1358
01:06:37,552 --> 01:06:37,572
Yeah.

1359
01:06:37,772 --> 01:06:41,772
You know, when you talk though about Steven Weber in.

1360
01:06:41,772 --> 01:06:45,072
Combining with theme parks, I think there is an opportunity to do it again,

1361
01:06:45,152 --> 01:06:50,012
which is, you know, NBC is sitting on the studio 60 property.

1362
01:06:50,312 --> 01:06:50,632
Yeah.

1363
01:06:50,732 --> 01:06:54,792
And there potentially is an opportunity to do a studio 60 attraction.

1364
01:06:55,532 --> 01:06:56,992
I'm not sure what I mean.

1365
01:06:56,992 --> 01:07:01,352
Like maybe the, I mean, if they ever wanted to refresh Spider-Man and replace

1366
01:07:01,352 --> 01:07:05,012
Spider-Man with peripheral vision, man could essentially be the same.

1367
01:07:05,552 --> 01:07:11,752
I mean, I think there's a good chance, not a good chance, an okay chance that

1368
01:07:11,752 --> 01:07:14,592
that for sure happens pretty likely.

1369
01:07:15,212 --> 01:07:20,972
Also seeing a, like a live, there's not enough shows at universal, seeing a live

1370
01:07:20,972 --> 01:07:25,472
daily depiction of the, I'm the very model of a modern network TV show.

1371
01:07:25,532 --> 01:07:28,332
I think you could just put it next to Falon's thing.

1372
01:07:28,432 --> 01:07:30,112
So you get a little street there.

1373
01:07:30,152 --> 01:07:35,072
Obviously that's New York, but it's confusing that NBC and I think it

1374
01:07:35,072 --> 01:07:36,412
isn't the other one NBS.

1375
01:07:36,412 --> 01:07:37,312
Yeah.

1376
01:07:37,312 --> 01:07:37,872
Yes.

1377
01:07:37,952 --> 01:07:41,092
NBC and NBS live next door to each other.

1378
01:07:41,232 --> 01:07:41,932
Late night lane.

1379
01:07:42,092 --> 01:07:42,752
That's what it is.

1380
01:07:42,832 --> 01:07:43,412
Late night lane.

1381
01:07:43,412 --> 01:07:45,692
Late night lane.

1382
01:07:47,052 --> 01:07:51,632
If, now if that, okay, now it look, if soundstage is all about tying shit

1383
01:07:51,632 --> 01:07:56,972
together, if you're on race through New York with Jimmy Fallon and then you

1384
01:07:56,972 --> 01:08:02,912
turn a corner and the villainous Jack Rudolph is like, Hey, NBC boy, let me,

1385
01:08:02,932 --> 01:08:07,512
let me give you a taste of the real New York and then tries to smack you.

1386
01:08:07,832 --> 01:08:07,972
Oh, sure.

1387
01:08:08,132 --> 01:08:10,252
Well then Jack Donaghy can save you.

1388
01:08:10,252 --> 01:08:11,052
Oh yeah.

1389
01:08:11,072 --> 01:08:14,872
Cause there'll be a 30 rock who was from that's what's confusing.

1390
01:08:14,972 --> 01:08:19,492
The 30 rock was on real NBC, but studio 60 was on NBS.

1391
01:08:20,292 --> 01:08:24,992
But 30 rock seems to be in a world where there is no SNL or TGS replaces SNL,

1392
01:08:24,992 --> 01:08:27,612
but studio 60 does exist in SNL universe.

1393
01:08:27,652 --> 01:08:32,212
Cause they'll say like, you know what aired at 1250 the first time Wayne's world.

1394
01:08:32,712 --> 01:08:35,552
Like Wayne's world is in that.

1395
01:08:35,772 --> 01:08:36,072
Oh, Wayne's world.

1396
01:08:36,232 --> 01:08:37,172
It's a, oh fuck.

1397
01:08:37,372 --> 01:08:37,572
Yeah.

1398
01:08:37,572 --> 01:08:38,712
I never thought about that.

1399
01:08:38,752 --> 01:08:41,152
But does the girly show exist within?

1400
01:08:41,412 --> 01:08:45,172
I don't, I believe, yeah, I don't believe SNL exists within the girl.

1401
01:08:45,752 --> 01:08:46,332
Yeah.

1402
01:08:47,972 --> 01:08:52,112
That's also just, yeah, studio 60 is accidentally bad.

1403
01:08:52,352 --> 01:08:52,592
Right.

1404
01:08:52,592 --> 01:08:57,812
The girly show, I think is like what the self-deprecating people who make SNL

1405
01:08:57,812 --> 01:09:00,272
think like, oh yeah, that's what we're doing with our lives.

1406
01:09:00,432 --> 01:09:00,812
Right.

1407
01:09:00,952 --> 01:09:05,332
Went to Harvard, but so did doctors, but we make this, you know, fart show.

1408
01:09:05,452 --> 01:09:05,732
Jokes.

1409
01:09:06,032 --> 01:09:06,092
Yeah.

1410
01:09:06,352 --> 01:09:06,572
Fart jokes.

1411
01:09:07,012 --> 01:09:07,032
Right.

1412
01:09:07,152 --> 01:09:15,352
But now is the chance to clarify a lot of the stuff that NBC and NBS tie together,

1413
01:09:15,652 --> 01:09:18,752
just like the imagination Institute merging.

1414
01:09:19,232 --> 01:09:22,572
Is that, was there, like, there's like an imagination Institute logo on the

1415
01:09:23,492 --> 01:09:24,292
the control, the control.

1416
01:09:24,292 --> 01:09:24,972
It's on the control.

1417
01:09:25,992 --> 01:09:28,392
Pointless world cross.

1418
01:09:28,512 --> 01:09:29,092
I like that.

1419
01:09:29,092 --> 01:09:29,892
I like it too though.

1420
01:09:30,412 --> 01:09:30,492
Yeah.

1421
01:09:30,492 --> 01:09:30,832
Yeah.

1422
01:09:31,272 --> 01:09:32,152
You know, I don't know.

1423
01:09:32,172 --> 01:09:32,832
Was this good?

1424
01:09:32,952 --> 01:09:33,792
Maybe this was good.

1425
01:09:33,952 --> 01:09:34,912
And maybe it was good.

1426
01:09:35,032 --> 01:09:38,052
I mean, if I get deeper into that Facebook group, they can convince, help

1427
01:09:38,052 --> 01:09:39,392
can convince me here.

1428
01:09:39,772 --> 01:09:41,992
I think there's more to it than sounds.

1429
01:09:42,212 --> 01:09:42,312
Danger.

1430
01:09:42,312 --> 01:09:46,732
I, is there red bubble merch for Sergeant Hobnob, whatever Drew Carey plays?

1431
01:09:46,932 --> 01:09:48,612
And there might be, I should look into that too.

1432
01:09:48,672 --> 01:09:49,012
Yeah.

1433
01:09:49,412 --> 01:09:55,212
Well, I mean, there's a, I do feel like there's a whole level of this, um, MGM

1434
01:09:55,212 --> 01:09:58,232
studios fandom too, maybe I'm not as plugged into cause I'm more plugged into

1435
01:09:58,232 --> 01:10:00,072
the Epcot stuff for the Tomorrowland stuff.

1436
01:10:00,232 --> 01:10:04,712
But yeah, I do think there's people for whom soundstage is a formative.

1437
01:10:05,152 --> 01:10:06,112
That's their Disney.

1438
01:10:06,672 --> 01:10:07,032
That's their thing.

1439
01:10:07,412 --> 01:10:07,512
Yeah.

1440
01:10:07,532 --> 01:10:07,912
Yeah.

1441
01:10:07,912 --> 01:10:08,312
Mm hmm.

1442
01:10:08,352 --> 01:10:13,672
Uh, so if you're one of those people, you hit the mother load with this episode and

1443
01:10:13,672 --> 01:10:16,232
I hope you enjoyed it.

1444
01:10:16,232 --> 01:10:18,992
Um, if we missed anything, please let us know.

1445
01:10:19,292 --> 01:10:19,732
Yeah.

1446
01:10:19,732 --> 01:10:24,352
Did us up because there's, as we discovered a lot going on in this attraction.

1447
01:10:25,172 --> 01:10:28,652
Um, but, uh, I don't know, email us, maybe we bring it back.

1448
01:10:28,792 --> 01:10:30,352
Maybe, um, maybe we got a petition.

1449
01:10:30,392 --> 01:10:31,312
We'll do a part two.

1450
01:10:31,432 --> 01:10:31,832
Yeah.

1451
01:10:31,832 --> 01:10:32,812
I'm interested.

1452
01:10:32,932 --> 01:10:37,092
I will say, and I didn't know this, there's a version of it in Disneyland

1453
01:10:37,092 --> 01:10:40,012
Paris, there was, there was, excuse me.

1454
01:10:40,112 --> 01:10:40,492
Oh yeah.

1455
01:10:40,492 --> 01:10:43,272
I didn't think when I was there, but it's the same thing.

1456
01:10:43,352 --> 01:10:47,592
Like a perfect thing to copy now, but was it real Steven Weber?

1457
01:10:47,592 --> 01:10:49,912
Was it the, like the French equivalent?

1458
01:10:50,112 --> 01:10:51,172
It was the French equivalent.

1459
01:10:51,172 --> 01:10:51,632
The French.

1460
01:10:52,052 --> 01:10:52,332
Yep.

1461
01:10:52,692 --> 01:10:54,832
But we can't, we don't have time to talk about that.

1462
01:10:54,872 --> 01:10:56,252
Pierre, whatever.

1463
01:10:58,312 --> 01:11:03,772
What an honor for a Frenchman to be officially called.

1464
01:11:04,072 --> 01:11:05,832
We consider you Francis Steven Weber.

1465
01:11:06,092 --> 01:11:06,312
Of course.

1466
01:11:06,352 --> 01:11:06,952
100%.

1467
01:11:06,952 --> 01:11:08,912
So the dream we'll get that.

1468
01:11:09,092 --> 01:11:09,952
We'll get there.

1469
01:11:10,252 --> 01:11:11,392
We will get there.

1470
01:11:11,412 --> 01:11:15,852
Who are Francis Scott, Mike and Jason doesn't exist.

1471
01:11:15,852 --> 01:11:19,852
Doesn't podcast the right Paris international spin-offs.

1472
01:11:20,132 --> 01:11:20,332
That's true.

1473
01:11:20,552 --> 01:11:20,712
I will.

1474
01:11:21,072 --> 01:11:24,172
We need to brand ourselves and start expanding, but only to the

1475
01:11:24,172 --> 01:11:25,272
countries that have Disney parks.

1476
01:11:25,352 --> 01:11:26,632
I am interested in that.

1477
01:11:26,652 --> 01:11:30,452
We will license our name out and there'll be three people that do our show.

1478
01:11:30,512 --> 01:11:33,292
And then we click 80% of the money they make.

1479
01:11:33,472 --> 01:11:33,652
Yes.

1480
01:11:33,732 --> 01:11:33,972
Jason.

1481
01:11:34,212 --> 01:11:34,512
Yeah.

1482
01:11:34,752 --> 01:11:34,912
Jason.

1483
01:11:35,312 --> 01:11:35,332
Yeah.

1484
01:11:35,332 --> 01:11:35,932
I'm into that.

1485
01:11:36,112 --> 01:11:36,552
Yeah.

1486
01:11:36,552 --> 01:11:38,092
Okay.

1487
01:11:38,392 --> 01:11:38,412
Great.

1488
01:11:38,492 --> 01:11:39,792
The Euro is right now.

1489
01:11:39,892 --> 01:11:40,672
Sure.

1490
01:11:41,132 --> 01:11:41,972
Cash in.

1491
01:11:42,072 --> 01:11:42,612
All right.

1492
01:11:42,632 --> 01:11:45,272
In that case, if you're interested in being a podcast, the right

1493
01:11:46,452 --> 01:11:50,652
international franchisee, especially our guests in Hong Kong or Shanghai,

1494
01:11:50,832 --> 01:11:53,872
email us at podcast, the right at gmail.com.

1495
01:11:54,012 --> 01:11:58,032
Keep subscribing to the second gate for the more and well, hey, we'll hit them.

1496
01:11:58,032 --> 01:11:59,832
I will hit sounds dangerous.

1497
01:11:59,832 --> 01:12:01,072
We'll hit monster.

1498
01:12:01,072 --> 01:12:01,572
