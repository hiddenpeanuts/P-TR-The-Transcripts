1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever!

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog!

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:09,080
Hey folks, we're here at Podcast the Ride's celebratory event where the brightest stars

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:14,000
in Hollywood sky are out for the Planet Hollywood episode featuring restaurant maven and self

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,760
proclaimed sicko Robert Earl, chicken tendies covered in Captain Crunch, and a disconnected

6
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,440
New York telephone number.

7
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:25,880
Pat Castles joins Mike, Scott and Jason here on Podcast the Ride.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:55,320
Welcome to Podcast the Ride Presents Celebruary, a month long celebration of celebrity owned

9
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,480
restaurants.

10
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,520
I'm Scott Gardner and I just want to let you guys know right away, I feel like maybe there

11
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:07,400
is some kind of celebratory curse that has befallen myself, that has previously befallen

12
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:12,320
you guys because for once I am the one who is dealing with big stomach issues.

13
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:17,800
I don't know what happened to me and I think maybe, I think it could be because of what

14
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:22,080
we're doing because we're talking about so many insane bad restaurants.

15
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,080
So, this is maybe prime among them.

16
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:30,720
For further thoughts, let me go to last episode stomach issue have Jason Sheridan.

17
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,000
Scott, I am on the exact opposite footing now.

18
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,200
I feel great.

19
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:44,120
I have since had Taco Bell again and felt perfect, felt fine, and I could not be more

20
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,280
excited for today's topic.

21
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:50,840
One of my rider dies and I know I'm going to be alone in that respect.

22
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,520
Oh, hang on.

23
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:58,600
Well, now let me, now I'm referring to the food only, but I'll take that.

24
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,600
I'm going to go to bat for some of that too.

25
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,600
To the food too, no kidding.

26
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,720
Not all of it, but some of it.

27
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:09,040
I'm excited to hear, but let me second you in the ride or die for this topic.

28
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,240
I am thrilled.

29
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,880
I'm not sure I've had so many tabs to pull open.

30
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:18,360
We'll see how many we'll get through, but let me check in on excitement level and stomach

31
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,440
health level with Mike Carlson.

32
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,280
Hi, I'm here and yes, my stomach is fine.

33
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,280
I feel like it's been better.

34
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,400
I feel like I needed a lot more sleep yesterday.

35
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,760
I played tennis yesterday and as an old man.

36
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,240
It's still tennis in 2022.

37
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,320
I'm back to playing.

38
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:37,760
I took a couple of months off because of my Achilles tendons, but it was a feel, but now

39
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:43,080
my shins seem to be sore, but I feel like the tiredness is affecting my whole body.

40
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,520
My stomach, I would say is medium.

41
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,520
It's fine.

42
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:50,200
It's not bad, but it's not like, it was a little gurgly after I had some lunch, so it's

43
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,200
not perfect.

44
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:56,560
But yeah, I would think after looking at pictures of all these menus, I'm a big psychosomatic

45
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,560
illness.

46
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,240
I believe that happens a lot with people.

47
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:03,320
So Scott, I think if you're seeing all of these pictures of blue drinks, like I know

48
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:07,880
you don't you specifically like blue drinks, I feel like makes your stomach turn.

49
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:11,740
So I feel like perhaps it's now been sort of like your brain is now playing tricks on

50
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:18,200
you as if it's digesting one of these delicious sugary alcoholic beverages and you're almost

51
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,280
going through, you're having a phantom digestion.

52
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,600
I think that might be it.

53
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,600
Yeah, yeah.

54
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:29,000
And which could have something to do with looking at the exteriors or interiors of these

55
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
restaurants.

56
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,840
Now, again, I'm not, these are not bad things necessarily.

57
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:37,840
Again, I'm thrilled to be talking about all of it because today is Planet Hollywood.

58
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,320
It's the big dog.

59
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:44,640
It's the, in a month of celebrity owned restaurants, it is the biggest restaurant owned by the

60
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:52,760
most celebrities, sort of, I guess, to varying percentage degrees.

61
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:58,520
And we've got a great guest joining us from a city that is home to one of the few remaining

62
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:01,560
planet Hollywoods in the world slash the country.

63
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,560
You're very lucky.

64
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,240
So we need to know what that's like.

65
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:08,020
I'm talking about New York City and the guest I'm talking about is a Emmy winning writer

66
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:12,960
for Full Frontal with Samantha Bee and a before that a longtime writer performer for College

67
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,960
Humor.

68
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,280
Hi, Pat.

69
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,280
Hello.

70
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,280
Thanks for having me.

71
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,280
Absolutely.

72
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,280
So thrilled to be here.

73
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,280
Until you told me.

74
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,280
I didn't realize that.

75
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,840
I did not know there were so few lefts on the planets, on our planets.

76
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:32,080
And I want to break the bad news to everyone that there is recently, seemingly one less

77
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,800
left that very Times Square location.

78
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,800
What?

79
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,800
Yeah, I did.

80
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,800
Yeah.

81
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,800
Wait, wait.

82
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,800
So I'm wrong.

83
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,800
So there isn't one in New York?

84
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,800
It's temporarily closed.

85
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,800
Is it closed?

86
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,680
It's temporarily closed, but the phone is also disconnected.

87
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,680
I called.

88
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,320
You called them?

89
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,720
I called because I had heard a podcast.

90
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,400
I had heard on the podcast what a time to be alive.

91
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:57,560
They casually mentioned the Times Square planet Hollywood being closed.

92
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:02,200
And then there was a massive article about planet Hollywood from not too long ago in

93
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:06,800
Esquire where they're talking about planet Hollywood during the pandemic in New York

94
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,000
doing takeout.

95
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,720
But it's seemingly not open now.

96
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,080
And it's not on the website at the moment.

97
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,560
It's not on the official website.

98
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,520
It's off the planet Hollywood website.

99
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,160
Oh, oh, that's good.

100
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,440
I man, I was there.

101
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:26,760
I went there pretty close to like beginning of pandemic, weirdly enough, just like it's

102
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:31,040
probably like one of the last restaurants I went to before March 2020.

103
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:35,680
So you could have been one of the last ever.

104
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,000
You might have been one of the final diners.

105
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Maybe.

106
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I don't know.

107
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Well, it was open then.

108
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Yeah.

109
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,280
Google says temporarily closed, but I don't know.

110
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,880
Maybe it's it certainly doesn't seem Times Square seems like a lot of turnover happens

111
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,880
there.

112
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,880
Yeah.

113
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,880
Yeah.

114
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,840
And being that it's all like the property values there have to be crazy.

115
00:05:54,840 --> 00:06:00,280
And I feel like even I think during pandemic, like the whatever the landlord was sued this

116
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,280
location for.

117
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,280
That's right.

118
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,280
Okay.

119
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,280
Okay.

120
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,280
Sure.

121
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,280
It's one of those.

122
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,560
Just a casual five million dollars in back rent.

123
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,880
That's going to be a frequently said stat, I think, throughout this month.

124
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,280
There's a lot of that.

125
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,800
I well, then, well, why don't why don't we start there?

126
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,520
I mean, we can dive into your feelings about the place and any history you have, Pat.

127
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,560
But like, what's give me the latest?

128
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:28,040
What was it like as close to the pandemic and possibly the closing as it could have

129
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,840
been?

130
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:36,480
Well, we I normally go to those restaurants in Times Square.

131
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:42,560
Anytime I see I don't see that many theatrical plays or musicals, nor do I go to MSG that

132
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,560
much.

133
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:48,160
So when I do, though, I always try and pair it with a outing to some kind of Times Square

134
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,600
restaurant just because it's like, I'm here.

135
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,600
I'll never be here.

136
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,640
You know, I'm here once a year, Times Square.

137
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:57,640
And so I think we were seeing.

138
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:01,640
No, we were seeing Beetlejuice the musical.

139
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,640
Oh, great.

140
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,760
What an either juice musical.

141
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,760
And we were like, let's just go here.

142
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,840
It was it was pretty empty.

143
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,840
It was quite empty.

144
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:14,520
There was a dude there working like on a laptop, like in the corner, which is kind of a bad

145
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:19,440
sign for like a fun restaurants and like a family fun.

146
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,760
Like it's supposed to be every table's crawling with birthdays and celebrations.

147
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:27,040
Yeah, it was definitely not at its best.

148
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,360
It was like definitely not full.

149
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:31,040
But I'm not sure when the last time it was full ever.

150
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,040
I'm not really sure.

151
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,520
Yeah, maybe opening night.

152
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,520
And that was it.

153
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,320
Well, they had mostly celebrities are there.

154
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,400
They had 14 different Hollywood stars there.

155
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,320
Right. Yes. Yeah.

156
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:45,920
These. Well, I think they all started strong and then it's a slow diminishing this already.

157
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:51,600
That location, the New York one currently or maybe not currently is like a downsize

158
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,360
already. That isn't the original one.

159
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,040
The original New York restaurant was the first planet Hollywood ever.

160
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,880
And it moved to a smaller one still in Times Square.

161
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:04,680
But that's kind of like a like a duplex, a sublet.

162
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,080
I don't know what you want to call it with Bucatubeppo.

163
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:13,000
Like you enter this weird little alleyway and then you go one direction, I think, for Bucatubeppo

164
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,360
and the other way for planet Hollywood.

165
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,760
So it's already sharing the space and we're like cramming the props together much more.

166
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,640
You don't know which way it's going.

167
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,680
It's kind of like a mystery.

168
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,720
Like it's a it's a it's a it's a coin toss.

169
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,320
They keep it deliberately confusing.

170
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,880
I was on the like as empty as it was, though, it's still like

171
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:35,680
all the props that were there when they stopped being popular are still there.

172
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,880
So it still has that.

173
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:42,440
I you were saying earlier, the ambiance is like food, notwithstanding the ambiance rules.

174
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:48,320
And like if you're like I am, I assume you guys are like a really big fan of like mid

175
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,200
90s Hollywood. It's like the perfect museum.

176
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,400
I'm sure we'll get into all this and like what's actually there and stuff like that.

177
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,840
But it was. Yeah.

178
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:00,280
So for me, it was just like a great museum to walk around and be like,

179
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,200
oh, it's this, it's that, it's whatever.

180
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,560
Yeah. Yeah. Did it?

181
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,600
Did anything stand out?

182
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:08,880
Do you recall anything from from the real big one was we were eating on

183
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,560
like literally we looked at we were eating lots of, you know, like probably

184
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,600
17 terminator things is like the first thing you say.

185
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:21,640
And then we realized halfway through we were eating under

186
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,120
there's a lot of ceiling stuff.

187
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:27,040
If you look up, there's a lot of like the bus from speed is like

188
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,120
literally hanging above you.

189
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,320
But it was my favorite thing was Dorothy from Twister.

190
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,400
You know, Dorothy.

191
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,800
Oh, the like the machine with the machine.

192
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,200
Yes. Wow.

193
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,000
Geez. The Dorothy.

194
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,320
The full Dorothy, you're saying, because Dorothy.

195
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,360
OK, remind me, Dorothy is the machine, but there has the little like balls.

196
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,840
That was exactly what I'm not sure the balls were in there, though.

197
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,720
OK, because I really the balls for me would be the big draw.

198
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,000
That's killer. Yeah. As far as Dorothy's concerned.

199
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,920
And if you're in the mall, the little professor, right.

200
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,000
Right. Yeah.

201
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,440
They would spin inside the to this.

202
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:02,240
I can't confirm the presence of the little individual things in there.

203
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,760
OK, well, Jason, we'll get on the phone again, hopefully if they reopen.

204
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,120
I mean, I kept trying.

205
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,360
I kept looking.

206
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,600
There weren't a lot of reviews recently.

207
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:14,080
You know, then lots of information about the Malta one on the website.

208
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,840
The newest, the newest one opened in 2015.

209
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,440
Malta. Malta. Yes.

210
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,240
The small island of Malta. Yeah.

211
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:26,800
New that before that, the Los Angeles International Terminal at LAX.

212
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:32,520
Mm hmm. But these the thing with these is it's not the it's not the trash.

213
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:36,920
It's not the like the like the room with too much going on

214
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:40,440
and props exploding off of every wall and like big

215
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:44,000
kooky sunglasses in the bathroom and that kind of thing.

216
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:50,480
I think like the the new vibe is like the vibe of everything in the in the 2000s

217
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,120
and 2010 is very sleepy and just kind of sleek.

218
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:59,000
And like like the Vegas one was another move where it was a big, crazy, trashy one.

219
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,960
And now it's like a much smaller.

220
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,960
It does feel like an airport restaurant.

221
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,240
So I don't like this. That's happened to the brand.

222
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:10,760
Yeah, I remember being at Caesars in college and going like,

223
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:14,960
oh, my God, there's a planet Hollywood and watching them watching like in the middle

224
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:18,200
of all these expensive shops as they just dropped a planet Hollywood

225
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,280
and then watching the walk through like in the opening.

226
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,800
It's like, oh, my God, it's across from a Brookstone and down the way

227
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,240
from a Warner Brothers store.

228
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,800
This is the most 90s time capsule footage I've ever seen.

229
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,880
Yeah, the new ones have like legitimate Hollywood props in them

230
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,800
like the way the old ones do.

231
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,720
Not yet. Not a lot.

232
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:43,800
I mean, I excitedly texted my girlfriend like there's still one in Vegas,

233
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,240
the one in Caesars. It moved. It's still there.

234
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,680
It's at the top of the spiral escalator at the forum shops.

235
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,240
And it seems like they have a few, but the one in LAX does not appear

236
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,240
to be decorated at all.

237
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,960
Yeah, it's just like primary colors.

238
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,600
It's really boy looks like a weird like an office lobby.

239
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,600
It's it's it's so I thought you meant the 90s movie primary.

240
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,200
Now, Scott, that would be a big get if they had some primary colors.

241
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:13,200
I'm sure one of them has like, you know, John Travolta's Blazer or

242
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,640
from the way the way he is where the white wig.

243
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,680
I just I assume he died his hair.

244
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,280
Maybe he was died. Probably a real hair.

245
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,000
Yeah, yeah. I don't know much about that.

246
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,240
That's the perfect kind of my favorite props there are like not the Terminator

247
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,920
skeleton. It's like the really random forgotten movies.

248
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,080
There's a there's a great I think it was on air.

249
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,240
Jason, you probably heard the story a million times.

250
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,560
There's an unaired UCB show sketch

251
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,960
that Walsh and Besser did

252
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,800
where they did a prank and it was at a planet Hollywood.

253
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,920
And basically what the gist of it was is they made a giant fake glove

254
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:52,600
that looked like maybe like a Mad Max, like Spikes Road Warrior.

255
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,280
And they they snuck it into the restaurant.

256
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,000
And all of a sudden, like when they made sure no waiter was looking,

257
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,560
they just dropped it on the table and pretended one.

258
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,720
It fell on one of them.

259
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:09,280
And like, I forget if there was fake blood or not, but like,

260
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,680
it's like Walsh or Besser was like, oh, this fell.

261
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,680
So like all of a sudden, people were freaking out, like running over to them,

262
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,080
like worried about like, you know, getting sued or whatever.

263
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:20,640
And they I forget if Besser and Walsh was like, we kept asking over

264
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,840
and over again, oh, what movie is this from?

265
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,920
What movie is this?

266
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,120
I don't even know what movie this is from.

267
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,520
But then I guess somebody found out and they could never

268
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,360
they never got the rights to air the the prank or anything.

269
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:35,160
I mean, like to go there, it is a very ceiling.

270
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,120
The ceiling is just filled with stuff in that place.

271
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,280
It's like everything's hanging from

272
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,240
another thing that the New York one was the independent,

273
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,480
all the little miniatures from Independence Day, like the spaceships and stuff are there.

274
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,840
Wow. Yeah.

275
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:50,960
It seems like a high, high probability of of a prop falling on you.

276
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:55,720
A nude, semi nude is it was it Stallone?

277
00:13:56,080 --> 00:14:00,600
Like a mannequin, like a body double of a mannequin of like Stallone

278
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:04,720
and a speedo from I don't know if it was Demolition Man or something.

279
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:08,360
He's naked in Demolition Man because he's in the when he gets frozen, he's naked.

280
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,400
He gets frozen.

281
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,920
It's a cryogenic tube.

282
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,440
I think he in the movie, I assume he's just naked.

283
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,960
But they in the restaurants, they had to put in like black fabric

284
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,200
to cover up the crotch zone.

285
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,120
And one thing this was one where I was I kept thinking, like,

286
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,480
I feel like I've seen that at every one of them.

287
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,960
And I was looking around other comments, places that said, yeah,

288
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,040
I've seen this at every one.

289
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,440
I think this is one of the mass produced.

290
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:35,600
Every single planet Hollywood had the naked, which you could eat.

291
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:38,240
A family could eat directly under

292
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:42,240
a tube with Stallone naked and been weird fluid.

293
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,280
And I have.

294
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:46,840
I have. Maybe more than once.

295
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,640
Wow. Are you saying, am I naive?

296
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,440
Are you saying like they reproduce the stuff?

297
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,000
Some of them, because I also I remember always thinking.

298
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,960
That's OK. It's a little heartbreaking. That's fine.

299
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,200
I mean, I don't think all of it.

300
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,120
But at least that one feels like it was everywhere.

301
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,560
And don't you guys feel like, I don't know, we can get into which planet

302
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,160
Hollywood's people have been to.

303
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:08,400
But I feel like even as a kid, I was like, boy, there was a lot of

304
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,040
a lot of Terminator robots.

305
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,400
Seems like there are enough to go around.

306
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,400
I get Judge Dredd to I would say I feel like there were a ton of Judge Dredd

307
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,680
suits. They may have needed him for the movie.

308
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,320
But that yeah, that naked Stallone tub.

309
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:24,000
I don't I don't have a good feeling about that.

310
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,600
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

311
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,000
I think this is just in case.

312
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Yeah, I have a photo of it here.

313
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,840
I'm assuming this is the one you guys are talking about.

314
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:37,360
Oh, that's a worse photo than I had seen.

315
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,720
That's a particularly odd.

316
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,320
He's like, maybe he's really straining.

317
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,280
Yeah. Yeah. So he's I just want to sketch this out for the listener.

318
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:49,720
Imagine like a slightly taller baby pool that is clear and you can see through

319
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:52,280
the sides and it is no water in it.

320
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:58,200
And there is a really realistic wax figure of a naked Sylvester Stallone

321
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:02,320
with just like maybe a sock covering his penis.

322
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,040
A black, it looks like half of a thong.

323
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:09,160
Yeah, he looks like he was maybe like there was some sort of like he was killed

324
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:13,360
in the middle of a pose somehow, like he got shot by like a death ray

325
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,920
and it froze him in this position.

326
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,520
Yeah. And he's like, yeah, like this.

327
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:19,160
You're seeing the last moment of his life as he was like panicked,

328
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,200
naked with a sock covering his genitals.

329
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:25,560
I also believe he's in this plexiglass like bowl.

330
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:29,320
You can actually if you pay enough, they will fill that with liquor

331
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,600
and you can drink it like a scorpion bowl.

332
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:36,080
It's the most expensive thing you can get at Planet Hollywood.

333
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,360
Yeah, Bachelorette parties can can get it.

334
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,680
It's a big package, part of the package, and they can.

335
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,120
Yeah, they can actually get in the pool with him.

336
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,680
Drink it out. Yeah, yeah. Drink it out off of his butt.

337
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,080
Bachelor parties can pay

338
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:54,120
and they don't get a drink, they just get to borrow the casual slacks

339
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,600
from the hangover, which I saw the New York location.

340
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,920
There's a there was a video walkthrough from a few years ago, and it's like,

341
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:06,880
wow, they have all the casual wear from the hangover, like all the main guys,

342
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:11,680
all their polos and Oxford shirts and khaki slacks.

343
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,760
Wow. OK.

344
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:17,320
Now, does that include the baby Bjorn that Alan has or?

345
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:21,400
It just seemed like they had the busy graphic tea he wore.

346
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,000
I was hard to tell.

347
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,880
I don't think it had the baby Bjorn.

348
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,400
Are you there? I love the least.

349
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,000
So the only actual notable piece of wardrobe from that movie

350
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,640
they don't have.

351
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,760
Just like, yeah, just the business casual clothes.

352
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,360
But they have those.

353
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,040
That's true. They do have the clothes.

354
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,800
They have at Helms's Polo.

355
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,920
The plain shoes they wore, the old all the notable wardrobe.

356
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,840
I there's going to be a lot of screen sharing happening here.

357
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:53,920
And I I would like to share a little because I I got to go to the New York

358
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,360
location a little bit

359
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:02,320
a little further in time, which was for my this was in May 2019.

360
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:06,600
And my wife and I were celebrating our fifth wedding anniversary

361
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,040
and we did so in New York City.

362
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:12,840
I don't look it would be kind of on brand to say that we did

363
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,760
the dinner at Planet Hollywood, but I'm not that bad of a husband.

364
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:21,160
We were on our way to the good dinner that we got.

365
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:25,600
And it went like walking towards it like, yeah, but we should do.

366
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,200
Oh, yes. Yeah.

367
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,960
So I might if we go the other way on the stairs real quick.

368
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,960
No, it seemed so like, oh, what a good way to kick it off

369
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,440
would be with with champagne from the Planet Hollywood bar.

370
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,800
So really quick, here's

371
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:49,760
do I have too many tabs open where I can't even showing me the the eye photo?

372
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,240
Yeah, possibly.

373
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,800
Well, here we go.

374
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,040
It was minimized.

375
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,600
So here's some some memories.

376
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:01,720
My wife and I am like super thrilled to be there.

377
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:06,880
Yeah. And strolling behind you was the the like Walk of Fame, but on the wall.

378
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:11,360
Oh, yes, that's not because the other the way there's a thing to point out

379
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,320
decor wise is that they've always had hands and cement

380
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:19,800
all the Chinese theater in Hollywood, but they put them up.

381
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:23,520
They put them up on the wall and they and they kind of put them diagonal.

382
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,280
And that's their their twist.

383
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:30,520
But in this case, though, like to get it super current and or futuristic,

384
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,080
they're like LED.

385
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,920
What do you do?

386
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,600
They're they're like not even hologram.

387
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,080
Those aren't as cool as hologram.

388
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:42,800
I don't know. But technically, yeah, it's celebrity handprints back there.

389
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,640
I don't know who of who this point at this point, like, do they really

390
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,880
does anyone know Planet Hollywood favors today?

391
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,240
I forget. I mean, we took a photo and my friends and I last time we were there,

392
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,520
we took a photo in front of that thing and I can't remember.

393
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:57,800
I mean, it's probably like, you know, it's the usual suspects of like

394
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:02,760
Schwarzenegger, Stallone, Willis, Julie Roberts, maybe.

395
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,080
Yeah. Yeah. Melanie Griffith.

396
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,480
Yeah, exactly right.

397
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:10,480
I try to get who's like a who was a rising star then that is no law.

398
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,240
Like, I don't know.

399
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,800
I think I'm in Terry Casper Vandeen.

400
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,480
Casper Vandeen. Yeah.

401
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:21,840
Lori Petty, Tank Girl, John Claude Van Damme and a lot of the opening.

402
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,600
Lori Petty, Roseanne and Sinbad

403
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:30,000
at the TV special for the Beverly Hills Planet Hollywood Comes Home.

404
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,720
Oh, yes, of course.

405
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:34,800
A fine, fine piece of primetime programming.

406
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,760
So so here's here's some other favorites.

407
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,800
Here's us strolling the not the red carpet.

408
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:44,240
It's kind of red carpets, the red zebra carpet.

409
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:49,160
And it's also the red, the dirty red zebra carpets.

410
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,920
This is pretty ghastly.

411
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:55,480
The entire staircase up is done in this pattern.

412
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,920
And boy, is it walked on.

413
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,680
Boy, is it movie theater style?

414
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,080
But that's what you want, right?

415
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,240
That's the actual carpet from Monkey Bone.

416
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,480
Sorry, I'm not sure it was a zigzaggy like.

417
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:13,080
Wow. The kind of carpet that Chris Katana or whoever would have in their house.

418
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,360
It's the dirty carpet from Monkey Bone.

419
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,400
Well, then I shouldn't have walked on it at all.

420
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,480
I wish they told me how to put a sidestep.

421
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,240
Yes, the carpet.

422
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,160
Thanks for your service, carpet.

423
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,480
But then props.

424
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,520
What was stuff that I liked?

425
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,920
I'm going to go in order of impressiveness.

426
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:34,000
I'm of course, of course, wonderful to see a gray sports

427
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,320
almanac from my favorite movie Back to the Future 2.

428
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,600
Who knows how many of those there are?

429
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,760
Say these are the time it does.

430
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,960
And they're there. They're a dime a dozen.

431
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,640
But I'm hoping I can I can trust him on it.

432
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:50,040
We got Foxy Cleopatra's wardrobe from Goldmember.

433
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,200
Roster Powers 3.

434
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,520
I mean, that's pretty cool. That is great.

435
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,240
That kind of gives you a sense of like when they stopped updating.

436
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,400
Like that feels current in Planet Hollywood.

437
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,200
World is 2003 or so.

438
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:05,000
So like the only place in the world that's like we have Beyonce's wardrobe.

439
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:09,040
No, not from over concerts from Goldmember from Goldmember.

440
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:13,080
Well, it was it's an important movie from New York because the summer of 2002,

441
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,960
we were finally able to laugh again.

442
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,560
Yeah, Jason, 911 Context sure.

443
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,760
Thanks to Mike Myers and his beloved character, Goldmember.

444
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:29,640
It's almost like the guy from Planet High was like, wait, she's a musician, too.

445
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,280
Someone told the hard rock.

446
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,120
So what else we got?

447
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:40,640
I mean, this this also feels current in this is seeing a big 98 Godzilla.

448
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,480
Yeah. And elsewhere from the Emmerich Devlin universe.

449
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,080
I think I see some of those Independence Day things back there.

450
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,240
But you were mentioning, oh, yeah, you're right.

451
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,600
You have no. Sorry. I need to jump on that. Sorry. No, no, no.

452
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:55,760
We got a we got a tool time hammer. Oh, wow.

453
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,840
And tool time hammer.

454
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,600
That hammer touched by a grap.

455
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,320
This is like, you know, Thor has a hammer and Richard Karn.

456
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:06,080
This is Richard Karn's hammer magic hammer. Right.

457
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,760
And it's more important to me than Thor's hammer.

458
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:13,720
Yeah. And when everyone cheered, when Tim Allen got to pick up the hammer,

459
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,680
that's right. That was a big remember that like Captain America. Yeah.

460
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,600
I didn't realize they had TV memorabilia.

461
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,360
I thought it was just movies.

462
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,720
It's a little bit. Yeah.

463
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,200
Primarily movie. I'm trying to think if there's any other.

464
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:28,600
Well, you know what I know they used to have.

465
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,120
And I think this might this might actually now this might have moved in

466
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,240
and now is in the studio or the office where they make the show.

467
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,160
But I know that when I was a kid, I was a gog

468
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:42,520
because they had the original weekend update sign from Saturday Night Live,

469
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,960
like the Chevy Chase.

470
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:46,120
It was up. What was up on the wall behind?

471
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:50,920
I think maybe now that's now back in the offices, but that's a legit cool one.

472
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,640
And for a little comedy dork, me at 13.

473
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,520
Oh, my God. The Chevy Chase sign.

474
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:00,720
Yeah, that's I I will say I did go to Planet Hollywood as a child,

475
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,320
but I don't really remember anything and feel like I wasn't like

476
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,360
they didn't have anything Batman in there that was going to impress me.

477
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,960
And whatever the year was, did they not?

478
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,120
That feels like a given that Batman returns.

479
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,400
I wonder. Yeah.

480
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,840
Well, but did you come across a fact, Mike, that they hired

481
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,840
the production designer from the Tim Burton Batman?

482
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,120
No, I didn't. To design the Times Square.

483
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,800
And that's why there's all seemingly why there's all these girders

484
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,480
and bent metal and stuff.

485
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,280
And as I always was like, this is like Gotham.

486
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:36,360
There's a little bit of Batman in this design

487
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:41,160
in between the multicolored zebra prints and the giant collages

488
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:45,880
and circular screens, which is more like Batman villain, I guess.

489
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:49,200
Like it's it's a clash of hero and villain within the restaurant.

490
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,920
Spices carpet in Batman forever.

491
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,920
Debbie Mays are spice character.

492
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,440
Oh, of course. Right.

493
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:59,480
That's the two face had two girlfriends.

494
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:02,920
Yes. To Barrymore with sugar and Debbie Mays are with spice.

495
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:05,800
And yeah, she would have had like a animal print carpet.

496
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,960
I imagine it does seem like Planet Hollywood is the only place in the world

497
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,800
that specifically like it's not into it's kind of.

498
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:17,000
It was too early for the Chris Nolan Batman's

499
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,640
and it was too late for like the Tim Burton Batman.

500
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:23,960
So it kind of only likes those like Joel Schumacher Batman's.

501
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,680
Right. And do they have like the old Batman?

502
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,520
Do they have like Keaton's Batman suit there?

503
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,920
They've got to have some remnants of that.

504
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:38,080
I just see that like 95 96 is that Schumacher era where they were

505
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,840
when, you know, Planet Hollywood could get whatever they wanted.

506
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:43,680
That's perfect timing. Yes.

507
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:47,400
Well, there are no aesthetically so much like the Schumacher,

508
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:51,800
like the like so busy and multiple levels and lights flashing.

509
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,880
And that's what Joel Schumacher's brain looks like.

510
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,120
Yes, you should have.

511
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,400
Joel Schumacher should have been a day one Planet Hollywood guy.

512
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,800
Oh, yeah, he should have gotten some some Ponzi scheme shares.

513
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,520
Yes. So I have a quote.

514
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,680
The name is Anton First.

515
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:10,920
He was a set designer behind Tim Burton's Batman.

516
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:15,760
And the quote from him in the Esquire article, his mandate

517
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,760
first told Esquire in 1991 was to quit, was great.

518
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,200
A fun place for the Jeans Brigade, not upmarket or smart.

519
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:28,160
Huh? The Jeans Brigade.

520
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:33,520
I think that's like, you know, the hoy polo, you know, the the the common man.

521
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,360
Oh, wow. Interesting.

522
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,480
So that's because they wear blue jeans.

523
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:40,720
I guess that's what I had never heard the phrase Jeans Brigade

524
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,200
to refer to, like the middle class.

525
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,520
Wow. Interesting.

526
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,040
This guy, this guy only did the first Batman.

527
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:52,440
Yes, because it's a very sad story because he like got weird issues,

528
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:56,240
prevented him from working on returns and that bummed him out.

529
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,640
And then he tried to he was going to direct a nightmarish sounding

530
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:05,000
Michael Jackson movie called Midnight with a K and no one.

531
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,400
Where's the K?

532
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:10,520
I guess before the end.

533
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,600
It's not hiding somewhere you wouldn't expect.

534
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,800
Who knows? I first said it's actually instead of the eye.

535
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,400
It's a K. Makes no sense.

536
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,200
Bidden to big neck height is an experimental title.

537
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:25,360
No. So he like I think he took this planet Hollywood job

538
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,560
because his like other projects weren't taken off.

539
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,520
And then he did it and was like battling some crazy demons.

540
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,960
And a month after the opening of the first planet Hollywood,

541
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,680
he threw himself off of a building and killed himself.

542
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,560
It's really crazy and a bummer to bring up.

543
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:43,760
And I don't want to be disrespectful to this this death that occurred.

544
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:46,680
But what I found this is this, I think where I really got fascinated

545
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:49,920
with planet Hollywood as an adult was I was on my way.

546
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:54,800
I knew I was going to see one at at Disneyland Paris, where there still is one.

547
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,160
And I was reading old articles like, that's crazy.

548
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,800
They still have a really locked in time planet Hollywood.

549
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:03,800
And this article that I read from Los Angeles magazine almost implied

550
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:07,440
that the decor was so bizarre and depressing that it like

551
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,280
that he like it like

552
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:15,080
impacted the person getting depressed and committing suicide.

553
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,840
That seems like impossible.

554
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:20,280
That seems like a major jump for the writer of this article.

555
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:23,080
Because conversely, like the

556
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,440
Orlando and Vegas ones would go on to become

557
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,080
the highest grossing restaurants in the country.

558
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:33,400
Like it was very successful, insanely popular and like filled

559
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:37,840
with celebrities for a long time before they, I guess, overexpand it.

560
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:41,760
And then their revenue dropped like an insane amount.

561
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,880
It went from like 12 million in one year to four million

562
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,640
the next like fiscal quarter.

563
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,640
Like it was an insane drop.

564
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,440
I agree. I guess the only way it could even it's depressing is that

565
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:57,080
it is kind of like a Norma Desmond house where it's just like literally

566
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,040
you're reliving your old Hollywood memories, like

567
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:03,800
it's a museum of like Hollywood's faded past.

568
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,360
Yeah.

569
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:08,640
Trumbling remains of what we now know is like a business

570
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,680
that's like in peril in certain ways.

571
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,320
But I think Jason's right there.

572
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,360
I mean, it seems like back then it certainly would have been.

573
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,360
I mean, I'm sure we'll get into this, but like

574
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:21,000
it seems like for at least a week, it was like the coolest place in the world.

575
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,200
I my my memories of it is my family was like all in.

576
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,720
If we we went to the Orlando one a number of times,

577
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:35,920
if we went to a city, we and there was a plane of Hollywood near where we were.

578
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:36,680
We were probably going to eat.

579
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,880
I ate at the Washington, D.C. one.

580
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,440
I've been to Times Square twice.

581
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:45,840
And we always had a nice time.

582
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,280
It was very fun.

583
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,840
We were all very fond of the Captain Crunch chicken.

584
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,880
Which I let's let's let's stop here.

585
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,440
Let's pause here for a minute.

586
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,560
I guess it's going to make Scott's stomach worse.

587
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:01,880
Yeah, I don't want to get ahead because I'm saying so I'm saying let's stop here

588
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,920
because I have to go to the bathroom.

589
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,640
Everybody hold tight for 20 minutes.

590
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,040
Sure.

591
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:08,360
I'm going to vomit because of that chicken description.

592
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,600
Just the hearing the the title of it.

593
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:16,160
So, yeah, food wise, I was trying to remember what even they had.

594
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,360
And it seems like it's kind of generic.

595
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:21,200
Burger sandwiches, pastas, kind of whatever.

596
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:26,920
And I don't know that a lot of the food jumped out and was like even the reason to go.

597
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:32,040
But I do I do remember it being a little notorious from articles and press at the time

598
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:38,080
that they had chicken that was fried and coated in a batter that was comprised of Captain Crunch.

599
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,400
Jason had it.

600
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,640
Anybody else have it?

601
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:44,240
No, I did not. But I had other.

602
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,920
I've had like some other places I've had like versions of it.

603
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:50,880
And it never it's never satisfying to me.

604
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,680
Cornflake chicken, I think, is a lot more common.

605
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,120
Yeah, sure. It sounds all right.

606
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:56,720
That makes sense.

607
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,600
How is the how is the Captain Crunch chicken?

608
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:02,440
I mean, I was a kid and I liked anything sweet.

609
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:07,280
And so I think we're all very amused by the novelty of it.

610
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:12,680
I think they also lost the license to say Captain Crunch pretty quickly,

611
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:16,040
because eventually it just became like sweet crunch chicken.

612
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:19,360
It's still on the menu.

613
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,360
It was so bad.

614
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:23,200
It was like the flavor of this smirches.

615
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,440
The good name of Captain Crunch.

616
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:31,520
Yeah. Now they have an appetizer sampler that is served on a little metal wire

617
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,040
ferris wheel.

618
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,720
OK, that was like bring this up.

619
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:38,080
Yeah. What I thought I was delighted by that.

620
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,920
It's like a vertical lazy Susan. Yeah.

621
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:44,160
Whoa. I'm picturing this.

622
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,440
What do you Google to find to like

623
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,120
explain it to us or find a photo?

624
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:50,000
Yeah, let me find a photo.

625
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:50,880
Yeah, keep talking.

626
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:51,360
I'll find it.

627
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,000
It's like a circular thing and they would put it like so.

628
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,960
I just don't know. It was like a ferris wheel.

629
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:58,160
It was like a little like they put on the table.

630
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:01,240
It had like seven or eight baskets in like around the wheel.

631
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,040
Oh, I got it.

632
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,280
Each one had a different appetizer.

633
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:07,240
So it was just to expand the amount of space a table could have,

634
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,200
because I think so.

635
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:11,480
And also, like if you and like a lazy Susan, it's oh.

636
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,840
There we go.

637
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:17,240
The appetizer wheel, the appetizer wheel.

638
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,680
OK, I love this.

639
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,920
Yeah, this is pretty good.

640
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:22,040
I can't do it on this. Yeah.

641
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:25,880
I'm so I'm so happy that this is like proprietary to Planet Hollywood,

642
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:28,520
because I thought you guys would have already encountered these before.

643
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,000
Yeah, I don't know.

644
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,280
I'm trying to think of the I've had big.

645
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:35,760
I've had a three tiered like appetizer platter before,

646
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:39,120
and I'm trying to remember where that was, but I don't ever think it's come

647
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:41,680
in the form of a theme park ride.

648
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,360
Like my appetizers have never come on a ride.

649
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:46,880
That's a big deal.

650
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:50,920
Well, yeah, a ride mechanism that is a bunch of dumb appetizer.

651
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:53,960
This is pretty this is way up really film reel.

652
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,040
Is that possible?

653
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,400
Hmm. Oh, potentially.

654
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,360
Yeah, very. Yes.

655
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,160
If not, that's a waste of opportunity.

656
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,880
Definitely. Yeah, maybe.

657
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:06,400
But it's I think I feel like they could have done a better job

658
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,520
of making the outside look like a film canister.

659
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,400
Yeah, I think I'm wrong. I'm just guessing.

660
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,000
I don't know that you're wrong, though.

661
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,080
I just think maybe they were like, well, here's the deal.

662
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:17,320
All of these existed before and we can just buy up a bunch of them.

663
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,200
We don't need to make a bunch of film.

664
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,440
Like it's possible they cheaped out on an idea.

665
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,760
So I'm not totally discounting what you're saying.

666
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,520
Wonder how they describe it in the menu.

667
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,160
That would be the way to get good.

668
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:31,960
It's called a I think it's called a high roller sampler.

669
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,840
Yeah, I am also seeing the phrase high roller sampler. Correct.

670
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,920
Yes. OK. It's not film. It's not film.

671
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,760
It's like just a different theme, like Vegas.

672
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,720
Like, why are they going in a different direction?

673
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:44,360
Like not even trying to make it sound like Hollywood.

674
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:47,840
Did it debut at one of the places that has a casino nearby?

675
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,720
It well, I saw it also.

676
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:54,160
I saw it a second place because this is OK.

677
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:56,520
This is a confusing thing about Planet Hollywood's presence

678
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,400
in modern day Las Vegas.

679
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,800
The Planet Hollywood restaurant is in Caesars.

680
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:05,480
The Planet Hollywood Casino has a restaurant called Cafe Hollywood

681
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,840
that also has the Ferris wheel sampler

682
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:13,360
and a little bit of the similar theming.

683
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:16,360
But I don't think they could call it Planet Hollywood

684
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:21,160
because there's one of those in Caesars and they didn't want to cannibalize

685
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,360
their own business.

686
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:26,120
Cafe Hollywood is not Planet Hollywood.

687
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:28,280
No, but it was in Planet Hollywood.

688
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,760
It was the original name.

689
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,360
It was a name they were batting around before they hit on Planet Hollywood.

690
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,920
The high roller.

691
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:38,880
Yeah, this is I'm really it's I'm stuck on this boy.

692
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:42,000
It's an amazing wheel, but it's called the high roller

693
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:46,440
and it's served at a restaurant that's Hollywood themed.

694
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,520
I just I guess I guess Hollywood people are high roller.

695
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:51,720
I'm sure I rollers these guys have gambling problems, so maybe it makes sense.

696
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:52,760
That's true. Yeah.

697
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:55,680
The Ferris wheel in Las Vegas, the big observation wheel

698
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:58,400
in the middle of the Las Vegas strip is also called the high roller.

699
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,480
OK, all right. So there you go.

700
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,200
Yeah, I guess is a roll.

701
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,040
I guess it roll.

702
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:06,560
It doesn't really roll a Ferris wheel, though, doesn't really roll.

703
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,640
Rolling indicates that that the thing would have to actually

704
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,480
spin around spinning bins.

705
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,360
So the roll would be bad for bro is an accident

706
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:18,440
and it's come off of its axis and it's crushing people. Yeah.

707
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:23,000
Do you mean are you trying to are you all trying to tell me that

708
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,560
Planet Hollywood may not have thought something through?

709
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,360
Well, I guess I well, if we're talking about food,

710
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,400
are we now talking about actual food now or now?

711
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,560
I can tell you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

712
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:38,440
Well, I guess my question is off this.

713
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,800
You guys have probably done more research than I have.

714
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,480
Is are any of the dishes like Hollywood theme like

715
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:49,760
or is there like the Schwarzenegger burger or like the Joe Piscopo fries or something?

716
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:54,960
You know, that's where one of the breakdowns seem to happen,

717
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:58,120
because reading about the development of the place,

718
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:01,080
Bruce Willis was all about the cocktail menu.

719
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:05,600
Sylvester Stallone kept making comments about wishing the food could just be in pill

720
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:09,480
form because he just cares about getting protein and working out.

721
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:12,960
Well, he doesn't like eating. He gets tired of chewing.

722
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,280
He gets tired. He wishes all food was pill.

723
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:19,240
That's that's his pitch for the world is that food is all he's coming out demolition

724
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:22,240
and like Taco Bell is nothing but like goo on a plate.

725
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,520
That's right. Yeah. Really made him think.

726
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,280
Schwarzenegger really wanted.

727
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:29,440
I believe it was his mother or his grandmother's strudel.

728
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,800
And that seems easy to make in both.

729
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,200
So I but I don't remember any of that.

730
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:39,080
You want that. Who wants strudel at this Jason place?

731
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:42,080
Probably. Yeah, I do. I absolutely would like that.

732
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,200
That's a pretty easy dessert. That's a pretty easy.

733
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:49,440
So did he not get his way in his mom's strudel was not at Planet Hollywood?

734
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,520
He said that's a shocker.

735
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,000
Yeah, you get that done.

736
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,160
I don't think he remembered saying that.

737
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:57,920
I don't know that any of them remembered saying any of this.

738
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,520
Well, the pill form I saw I saw an interview

739
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:03,320
where Sylvester Stallone would made it made a joke like I don't like to eat.

740
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,520
I don't like eat it.

741
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:07,040
I don't I don't I never liked it to trade a lot.

742
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:10,160
I just wanted food to be the pill, which is an odd thing to say

743
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,800
when you're promoting your restaurant.

744
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,480
Yeah, you don't want to hear that.

745
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,600
You hate to hear that from the restaurant tour.

746
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,800
I hate to. Yeah, that's right.

747
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,840
Yeah. Why did you open this place then?

748
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,240
The interviewer actually asked him that.

749
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,560
And it's like it's like it's an English, like a very snooty,

750
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,600
like English interviewer. And he's like, is it greed?

751
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:30,040
And so, oh, yeah, yeah, whatever.

752
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,320
No, it's fun to do.

753
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,560
You know, you're like half asses.

754
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:36,080
So my answer, a gotcha moment was attempted.

755
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:37,920
Take him to task.

756
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,400
Here's what I know that they have.

757
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:42,240
I think that we find ourselves,

758
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:45,720
Pat, often let down by not just what we're covering this month,

759
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:49,320
but other things where like the other theme restaurants

760
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:52,880
where they don't go the extra mile with naming the things.

761
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:53,720
This happens all the time.

762
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:57,000
There's only one thing on the menu where they bother.

763
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,560
And it's so insulting.

764
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,600
Like, why not?

765
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:03,080
If you're going to do a theme to something, why not go full tilt

766
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,360
and have and have fun?

767
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:08,040
Because there's so much like there is so much fun to be had with naming.

768
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:13,240
I did find I think the drink menu is where they really did it.

769
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:16,600
And this is very pixely what I'll show you.

770
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,840
So it's going to be a little hard.

771
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,720
Yeah, Bruce is the only one who tried.

772
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,480
He gave a damn.

773
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:26,480
And that's why his movies.

774
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,400
This was in an era where he still was.

775
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,480
He was down to try like two more things.

776
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:34,280
And I love my harmonica in support of as a sort of like thank you, Bruce.

777
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,200
Oh, yes. For the first summoning of Bruce.

778
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,560
Yes. Please play the harmonica you brought to the record.

779
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,640
I just I'm going to blow.

780
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,560
I can't actually play it.

781
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,000
That's all right.

782
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,200
It's neither can he.

783
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,560
That's great. That was beautiful.

784
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:55,960
Well, here's if you really want to be him, then like just yell like

785
00:38:56,200 --> 00:39:00,120
you don't have to know the tune of the song, but just just go like long,

786
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:04,120
tall Sally and then do whatever you want on the harmonica. Yeah.

787
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:08,000
Have you seen is a secret seven ads from like the 80s?

788
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:12,320
That is that's that's like in the era where he like he was famous for that.

789
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:15,120
For me, that's the Bruno kind of like.

790
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:19,440
Bruno era. Yeah, I'm not super familiar with with these,

791
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,960
but they were like exceedingly popular, right?

792
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,560
But it feels like I think so.

793
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:27,440
But it was like that he had an actual album that came out where him playing harmonica.

794
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,560
This is like a future proto.

795
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:34,680
Yeah. Planet Hollywood, Bruce, because I feel like he was famous for playing

796
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:37,600
harmonica at Planet Hollywood openings.

797
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:41,560
Am I crazy? His his one of his contributions was always like,

798
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,360
and of course, I can play the opening.

799
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,040
I can help out. I can play the opening.

800
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,480
With the accelerators.

801
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:49,760
You know, like I think I just have this visual of him with a suede

802
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:54,360
planet Hollywood jacket, like pointing at the back of it, like that perfect, like

803
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,560
like a letterman jacket.

804
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:00,400
He goes and puffy as many colors as can be on those sleeves.

805
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,840
Yeah, that are like shirtless.

806
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:07,920
I feel like he was just shirtless at these openings a lot and and and bald too.

807
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:10,280
And maybe wearing some goofy hat.

808
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:13,640
That's what I found in a lot of these. He has a song.

809
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,280
It is shocking.

810
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:19,000
We haven't done a full Bruno episode because I'm a big fan of the concert.

811
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,760
I know a lot of the songs.

812
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:25,160
He has a song called Down in Hollywood, which would be what?

813
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,560
Yeah, believe it or not, would be perfect for the opening.

814
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:32,440
So yeah, I wish there should be a video of him.

815
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:35,240
I don't I haven't seen him perform those songs.

816
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,280
I've heard I've seen him do it.

817
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:41,200
Scott's saying like long tall Sally at like a sort of outdoor festival.

818
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,680
And we're in covers.

819
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:43,440
You could ever.

820
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:47,120
It's so fascinating that like he he was already the coolest guy in the world.

821
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,000
But in his brain.

822
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,760
He's like, I can be cooler with a harmonica.

823
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:55,120
I think he saw I just can't wrap my head around that.

824
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:58,720
I think he saw Billy Joel and I think he goes, I can do that.

825
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:01,680
Like when you see when you watch Return of Bruno

826
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,440
and one of my favorite songs, my probably my favorite song is called Fun Time

827
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:09,760
that he does. We we we've been in an episode playing this one.

828
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,320
Yeah, we have talked. What's that?

829
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:11,880
Sorry, Pat.

830
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:15,360
Do the lyrics go, this is where the fun starts.

831
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,560
He goes, oh, yes, it's fun time.

832
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:21,800
Fun time like break time, break time.

833
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,160
Everyone be happy.

834
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,800
It's fun time.

835
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:28,720
And it's all like, I think I'm thinking of a of a of a Seagram's wine cooler

836
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,240
commercial. OK, maybe that's a different.

837
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:33,480
Yeah, we have multiple songs about fun.

838
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,720
Bruce that loves to have.

839
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,480
That's right.

840
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:37,480
I love your artist.

841
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,080
I think you're right.

842
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,600
I think we have played fun time.

843
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,400
I feel like we ended an episode for some reason playing Fun Time.

844
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:46,200
And forgive me if I've if I've said this fact already,

845
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:49,800
but it's a it's a fact that stuck in my brain for a long time

846
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:52,120
and since the accelerators have come up.

847
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:55,040
I am a massive Beck fan, really love Beck.

848
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:58,480
And I love all the amazing musicians he's played with over the years, especially.

849
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:02,280
And his primary guitar player since Odell era,

850
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:05,600
this amazing guitarist named Smokey Hormel has been on tour of them.

851
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:09,360
He played all the awesome guitar on C Change and Mutations and all the like.

852
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,040
Lush, pretty stuff.

853
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:14,280
He was asked to join Beck's band in like 94, 95.

854
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:18,560
And it was he was heartbroken to have to turn it down

855
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:21,120
because he had already accepted a purely for money gig.

856
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:24,760
Touring planet Hollywood's with Bruce Willis and the Accelerators.

857
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:30,280
He almost and then playing with Beck became like a decades long.

858
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:32,040
And he is Beck's guy.

859
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:35,360
And he almost missed it entirely so that he could go right.

860
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:37,640
Salah right.

861
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:40,520
I think this is something we should mention

862
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,240
the that a lot of the openings,

863
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:47,360
especially for younger listeners, a lot of these openings,

864
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:51,880
they would just be filled with celebrities, like even in the smaller cities.

865
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:54,400
That definitely fell off at a certain point.

866
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:59,840
But there is a very funny story of Tom Arnold saying, I went to all of them

867
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:04,360
and him and his him and his then wife, which I don't think was Roseanne

868
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:07,520
because Roseanne started getting really into the plan Hollywood stuff.

869
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:08,640
I don't think he was there.

870
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:13,560
I think he was there in Roseanne era and post Roseanne era and post Roseanne era.

871
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:16,680
So he always took them up on the free trips, the free flight,

872
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:18,000
the free hotel and everything.

873
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,560
You just got gobs of merch.

874
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:23,480
And he's like, my wife was like next to sitting next to George Clooney

875
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:27,800
on the plane when he got a phone call and he hung up and he went, well, I'm Batman.

876
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,760
But he got the call.

877
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:32,240
It all comes back to Batman.

878
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:34,480
It was the Schumacher era.

879
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,640
She was Batman. Yeah.

880
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:40,440
Let me I mean, like we'll get into celebrities and stuff just while it's open.

881
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:43,360
Let me like point out some of these these drinks, because these are good.

882
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:45,200
I can't read the descriptions too well.

883
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:49,360
But I love the like degree of selection of movies that we got here.

884
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:51,160
We got the Jurassic Park.

885
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:53,320
We got the Steel Magnolia.

886
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:57,000
We got the cliffhanger, the legends of the fall.

887
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,800
Sometimes they pluralize, not always

888
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:04,040
indecent proposal and ghost.

889
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:08,480
I like that it's a it's a mix of like silly movies and then kind of like

890
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:14,640
austere adult circle of friends is circle of friends goes under shooters.

891
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:17,920
You can get shooters that are themed after this.

892
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:22,160
Like, I don't really know what that movie is, but can we can we get around the back

893
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,480
drafts? Can we get around the back draft for the table?

894
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:29,440
I'm like, I think in Legend of the Fall, Brad Pitt's character, like,

895
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,520
is like a hopeless alcoholic.

896
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:35,600
So like having a specialty drink named after him is in poor taste.

897
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:41,480
I'd like to get hammered off of a bunch of terms of endearment shots, please.

898
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:43,080
What's the terms? I can't.

899
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:45,160
Can you read the ingredients? There's a two tall.

900
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:47,320
Oh, God, I wonder if I can find a better one.

901
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:50,720
The other term. Wait, wait, is there cancer?

902
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:51,720
Right. It was nice.

903
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:53,880
Is that a joke? Did I make that up or did you say it?

904
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:56,520
Wait, no, I don't see terms of endearment.

905
00:44:56,520 --> 00:45:00,440
They made that up. I think I think I assumed it was on here somewhere.

906
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,280
Steel Magnolias is on here.

907
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:04,280
And I want to get the listener in a little peak.

908
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:06,720
I said, OK, let's say Carlson, you're a funny guy.

909
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:07,480
Here's what you're going to do.

910
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:10,800
You're going to think of a movie they haven't said that seems like a serious movie.

911
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:12,320
I said it out loud.

912
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:14,320
No one seemed to laugh at it.

913
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:17,200
And then all of a sudden, everyone thought it was actually something you said.

914
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:19,040
It seemed plausible.

915
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:23,760
Yeah, I commend you for realism because it's like so close to Steel Magnolia.

916
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,280
Why? Yeah, we're all just immediately like, oh, I don't see terms of it.

917
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:30,040
It's notable they have an entire market like they specialize in martinis.

918
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:34,120
Yeah. Yeah. Ghost 12 Monkeys, which, you know, 12 monkeys

919
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:38,680
as they have some bullshit banana ingredients and fakey awful

920
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:43,600
Sabrina, that real Rat Pack swinging movie, 12 Monkeys.

921
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:47,600
They're all just a bunch of 12 monkeys.

922
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:50,360
Can't be licensed. They don't. Yeah.

923
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:51,640
They have the.

924
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:53,600
But they are.

925
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:57,840
A lot of the stuff like Cliffhanger is to loan terminal velocity is Willis.

926
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,560
Right. No, that's

927
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:03,280
Charlie Sheen, I think, or that drop zone or terminal

928
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:07,800
Charlie Sheen is either in drops down or terminal velocity.

929
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:11,120
Charlie Sheen shows up in one of the openings.

930
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:13,760
She was around. Yeah, she was around.

931
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:14,840
They picked him up.

932
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:16,880
It seemed to go in tears like they gave.

933
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:21,440
They started with the big three, which turned into the big four with Demi Moore.

934
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:23,600
And then it started expanding.

935
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:25,320
You know who else was early in fall?

936
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:29,400
Like often it is like more like, oh, like party guy kind of celebrities.

937
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:30,760
And Tom Arnold makes sense.

938
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:35,960
But then like John Hughes early on, John Hughes, not the most like public man.

939
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:39,840
And I think he he was genuinely interested, I think, in like having a place

940
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:41,480
he could go with a private booth.

941
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:45,680
And I think the Chicago location had a space that had to be reserved

942
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:48,160
for John in case he he came in.

943
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:50,120
Wow, that's crazy.

944
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:56,000
That was the Chicago location was in Gurney Mills, which is right by Six Flags.

945
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:57,880
Oh, wow.

946
00:46:58,040 --> 00:46:59,720
What a zone, Mike.

947
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:01,800
Yeah, minutes from Six Flags.

948
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:06,000
One of the ones listed, I believe Gurney, Illinois, stuck out to me of like

949
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,240
in the 1999 news stories about Planet Hollywood to close

950
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:12,320
upwards of a dozen locations.

951
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:16,680
And it just I was like, where is why is there one in Gurney, Illinois?

952
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:21,440
Because of the Six Flags that I'm sure that's why Gurney Mills was a pretty big

953
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:22,920
mall. It's still a mall.

954
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:24,720
They forget if its name has changed.

955
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:26,960
Home alone, maybe home alone.

956
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:32,800
The massive success of home alone put Illinois on the map for for a minute.

957
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,320
That's possible. That's true. Yeah.

958
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:39,320
I I went to a couple of times the Atlantic City one,

959
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:41,760
which was on the boardwalk at Caesars.

960
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:43,800
I know I have a shirt somewhere.

961
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:45,920
I have a number of Planet Hollywood T-shirts,

962
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:50,320
I believe, because my family had the Planet Hollywood credit card for a while.

963
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:52,560
So we had a lot of points. What?

964
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:56,040
What? I read a comment somewhere,

965
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:59,840
might have even been in our Facebook or somebody talking about like they're like

966
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:03,400
that the waiter was pushing the credit card the whole time.

967
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,760
And it was like, well, it really makes sense because, you know,

968
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:07,600
if you're going to eat here and you're going to buy merch.

969
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:09,480
So your parents had a Planet Hollywood.

970
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:10,400
What does it get you?

971
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:14,920
Well, I I should say I should ask him if this was a coincidence

972
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:19,680
or whether it happened at the same time, because my dad, a proud Sheridan heirloom

973
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:23,560
has the denim jacket, the Planet Hollywood denim jacket

974
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:25,920
with the patch on the back in good shape.

975
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:28,200
And I have not stolen it yet.

976
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:32,280
But we cashed it like he I think they were getting rid of it.

977
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:35,840
They were they were getting rid of the card and my parents were getting rid of the card.

978
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:37,920
And we did cash in.

979
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:40,960
And my brother and I got a few shirts.

980
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:45,360
They were very clear that like you don't get to pick which city the shirts are from.

981
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:48,440
We're just going to send you shirts.

982
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,840
But I also got this fine

983
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:55,280
watch that I would wear to school dances and

984
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:58,480
family weddings and stuff.

985
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:02,240
Jane with like the shitty 90s logo with like the very like that's like

986
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:06,200
latter day style laughing from the other room.

987
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:08,440
This watch, of course, the battery would go on to die

988
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:11,200
and the band would very quickly disintegrate.

989
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:14,120
It's the cute. What did you say?

990
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:16,760
I what did you say?

991
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,160
Yeah, I wore it to formal offense.

992
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:20,240
I love you.

993
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:22,200
I'm responding to the same thing I'm responding to.

994
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:23,360
I love it.

995
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:26,760
It's the cutest thing I can possibly think of is that you're like,

996
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:28,520
I'm getting dressed up.

997
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:32,520
And to finish off this look for my dressed up dance

998
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:36,440
look is the Planet Hollywood, the finest piece of jewelry I own.

999
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:40,000
That's because people would come back from vacations with the shirts

1000
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,520
or the bomber jackets. It was the thing.

1001
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:44,520
I love it. It was a thing.

1002
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:46,800
And I know I still have it sitting at my mom's.

1003
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:50,560
And now it's now it's like, OK, do I try to find it and repair it?

1004
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:54,280
Like get a new battery, get a new band or do I just buy it again?

1005
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:56,120
Because that's insane.

1006
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:58,920
I mean, I guess I'd like you to do it.

1007
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:02,640
I think I just like Islands of Adventure watch

1008
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,920
like some old Italian watch fixer and like who's normally fixing like

1009
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:10,320
stock stopwatches and old like now this one.

1010
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:11,560
It's like a little hot.

1011
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:13,520
Yeah, it's like a little cottage somewhere up

1012
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:16,000
like in like some of the hills.

1013
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,440
I'm impressed that the case, I guess,

1014
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:21,400
if you can't see the photo, like it comes

1015
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:25,720
in a case that looks as if it's the most valuable thing in the world.

1016
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:29,200
Yes, it does. Yeah, it looks like it's like that.

1017
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:31,640
I mean, the case tells you, I guess, especially if you were a kid,

1018
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:33,360
you're like, this is expensive.

1019
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:35,280
This is an important watch.

1020
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:36,320
Yeah, there it is.

1021
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:38,960
Yeah. Well, look, it felt more fitting with a suit

1022
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:41,160
because my other watch looked like, you know, it's just whatever

1023
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:45,840
like Timex expedition that my mom had just bought for stocking stuffers or whatever.

1024
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:48,720
We got to figure out how we can restore this watch

1025
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:51,160
and how you can wear it maybe every day.

1026
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:54,840
There's one guy like the last planet Hollywood who can fix it.

1027
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:56,400
The watchmaker is there.

1028
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:58,840
Did any of those guys star in a movie about a watchmaker?

1029
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:01,120
I mean, I have a watch guy.

1030
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:04,640
I I don't. Oh, I think I know what guy.

1031
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:06,120
Yeah, a watch guy.

1032
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:07,800
How often do you go to your watch guy?

1033
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:10,520
If I need a new battery or the band is worn out

1034
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:11,800
and I need a new band.

1035
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:14,320
OK, because you know the back is the watch is the battery.

1036
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:17,280
Yeah, you pop the back out. Yeah. Wow. Interesting.

1037
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:19,200
I was given you got to take this in.

1038
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:21,400
If you have a guy, we don't have a guy.

1039
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:22,160
But that's the thing.

1040
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:26,320
I don't know where the original one is, but there are plenty of versions of it

1041
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:31,080
online and there are numerous other played out of what not for not very much money.

1042
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:36,120
All right. Well, did you ever go out of your way at a dance to like

1043
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:40,520
were you dancing in such a way to try to like show those wrists around?

1044
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:43,400
Hands up, everyone.

1045
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:47,760
No, no, Scott, I was too busy dealing with the flop sweat and nerves.

1046
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:50,760
So I don't think I ever mentioned it

1047
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:53,720
because at least I had the sense of like.

1048
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:58,040
Can you play a time is on my side just so I can do this when they say time

1049
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:00,840
and sees my watch?

1050
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:02,480
Or are you really a prom song?

1051
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:05,000
You went up to like a strobe light and tried like reflecting

1052
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,440
the strobe off of your watch to like.

1053
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:11,600
I do. I mean, that watch, it is actually until you see the planet

1054
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:13,960
Hollywood logo, it looks like a pretty tasteful watch.

1055
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:17,640
Yeah, it is surprisingly reserved by Planet Hollywood standards.

1056
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:23,160
And a girl would have to get really close to you to be able to see

1057
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:24,960
that detail of the logo.

1058
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:28,080
So I think you're showing that off basically in success.

1059
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:31,680
And I don't know what level of success you were feeling the deal. Yeah.

1060
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:36,680
I like Jason guy, but did you see his fucking watch?

1061
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:41,080
Holy crap. Nothing was special about like do anything like Hollywood, right?

1062
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:43,040
Oh, man, I wish.

1063
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:45,440
No, I mean, I think it had a date on it, but, you know,

1064
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:49,400
I thought maybe I had to watch a Star Wars, a Star Trek watch

1065
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:51,160
that would play the theme song when you pressed it.

1066
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:53,360
So I thought maybe like you press a button and play like

1067
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:56,080
array for Hollywood or something.

1068
00:52:56,080 --> 00:53:00,560
I Robert Earl just thanks you for the thank you for patronizing my restaurant.

1069
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:03,840
I love you real quick, just because we're talking about the jacket

1070
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:04,560
and the watch here.

1071
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:08,280
I don't know. You guys probably saw this, but there's a shirt here

1072
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:09,800
that Schwarzenegger is wearing.

1073
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:13,280
And I want to know if Jason remembers this because he was I think it's safe

1074
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:17,000
to say he was the biggest planet Hollywood fan of of the four of us.

1075
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:20,680
Right. As a kid, I Jason, it sounds. Yeah, I guess so.

1076
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:24,520
I know. I thought maybe I'm more of a fan post your adult years.

1077
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:26,160
2010s. Yeah, I think so.

1078
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:28,240
Just about era of Hollywood in general.

1079
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:29,240
Like right, right.

1080
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:31,120
But not that restaurant specifically.

1081
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:35,320
I heard it referred to as like the 90s was the last really fun time for Hollywood

1082
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:37,520
because there was a limited number of cameras.

1083
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:40,120
There were beepers and early cell phones,

1084
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:43,480
but like you weren't constantly tracked every hour of the day. Yeah.

1085
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:47,120
So Schwarzenegger is wearing a shirt that looks like

1086
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:50,400
like like a

1087
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:54,240
carpeting at a bowling alley, kind of, but also like it's a Hawaiian shirt.

1088
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:56,960
It's got the big gaudy planet Hollywood logo.

1089
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:59,200
It's got rocket ships.

1090
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:02,760
It almost looks like the Space Jam logo, like the Space Jam logo is

1091
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:04,920
is the planet Hollywood logo.

1092
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:07,720
It's very, very colorful, very gaudy.

1093
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:11,600
But the thing I found the most on eBay are vest versions.

1094
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,040
Oh, my God.

1095
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:16,040
And this vest. Yeah.

1096
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:19,240
And we talked about last on the dive episode, there's a denim vest

1097
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:20,520
you can get with a big dive logo.

1098
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:23,040
But these are cheap. These are how planet Hollywood vests.

1099
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:25,080
We can get this for under 20 bucks.

1100
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:29,000
And Jason, I think if you would let me,

1101
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,880
I would love to purchase one of these vests for you.

1102
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:35,080
If you wear it, I, I,

1103
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:40,800
I will I would happily wear this like at one of our shows.

1104
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:46,200
We all we all three of us wear these rainbow vests

1105
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:50,520
without shirts on underneath that like immediately.

1106
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:52,800
We'll leave and ask for their money back.

1107
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:55,520
Like, listen, if that doesn't work out, you can all just become

1108
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:58,560
professional billiard players and wear at the billiard games.

1109
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:04,320
Yeah. So, I mean, I guess we'll do it off off, Mike.

1110
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:08,640
But I do think the only thing that concerns me about these vests is like

1111
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:13,280
there's a lot of very like generically kind of designs

1112
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:16,240
that the planet Hollywood logos don't seem big enough to me.

1113
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:18,600
I see what you're saying. You know what I mean?

1114
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:19,760
Where it's like cut off.

1115
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:21,400
I mean, look at in the back here.

1116
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:22,880
That one looks better. Yeah. OK.

1117
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:25,400
OK. So I think you could find it. I think it's it depends.

1118
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:27,240
Maybe each one is very unique because look at this.

1119
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:29,840
This is really a front. That one's good. Yeah, that was.

1120
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:34,000
Yeah. So I think it was like, you know, each one is a unique snowflake.

1121
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:36,360
It's like Lula Rowe. Right.

1122
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:37,600
You also have to wear it.

1123
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:42,320
The only thing acceptable to wear under these vests is a button down,

1124
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:45,320
a colorless button down.

1125
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:48,280
Oh, yes, sure. Like all the way. Yeah. Yeah.

1126
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:51,240
Well, I thought either that or like a white t shirt.

1127
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:55,440
Like a like a too shiny Macy's white t shirt.

1128
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:58,120
Yeah. I think that's very Bruce Willis.

1129
00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:00,440
He too, like very 90s Bruce Willis.

1130
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:03,520
Well, yeah, it reminds me of like a full house Stamos look.

1131
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:05,640
Yeah. Oh, big time.

1132
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:07,760
I would think cool. Yeah.

1133
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:09,120
Well, hmm.

1134
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:10,760
With the zany colors.

1135
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:14,280
Yeah, it's the gaudiness of the of the uncle of the Joey character,

1136
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:19,600
not only of the Joey character and the like cool sexiness of the of the.

1137
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:21,000
Yeah. Uncle Jesse character.

1138
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,880
Jesse's wearing it without anything underneath.

1139
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:28,800
Joey's wearing it with a like tritone long sleeve shirt

1140
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:31,640
and jean shorts, and it's all tucked in.

1141
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:33,880
The vest is tucked into. Right.

1142
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:38,760
That's can I share some of the the current celebs

1143
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:41,040
that they're like pushing on the Planet Hollywood home page?

1144
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:43,400
I cannot imagine who. Yes.

1145
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:46,680
Some of which some of which are promoting the merchandise.

1146
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:49,280
It's exactly who you think it is.

1147
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:52,200
You got Reese Witherspoon, you got Josh Gatton, a little hat.

1148
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:54,680
Gwen Stefani is doing a residency.

1149
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:57,320
And of course, who would be wearing the clothing?

1150
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:59,640
Why is Jacob Sartorius himself?

1151
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:02,560
What? Who's Jacob Sartorius?

1152
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:06,720
Why is Jacob Sartorius the young online influencer who is like

1153
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:11,840
what came of I think was very popular like years ago and is now 20.

1154
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:15,040
But I have never come across this name.

1155
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:17,320
Why that was Jason before?

1156
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:19,320
I did know who Jacob Sartorius was.

1157
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:21,840
I don't know what he's known for.

1158
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:23,840
Jason is out, hip to us again.

1159
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:26,880
I don't think I don't think Jason Sartorius is hip.

1160
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:28,680
I'm going to call Jacob.

1161
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:30,240
I'm not a man.

1162
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:32,120
Are you calling Jason Sartorius?

1163
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:34,520
Do I could say Jason Sartorius?

1164
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:37,320
Well, that's what he wishes he was, is Jason Sartorius.

1165
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:38,320
Pretty cool name.

1166
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:40,400
It's a cool name. Sure.

1167
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:43,000
Yeah. Sartorius is a first name I would really love.

1168
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:44,080
That's that's the thing.

1169
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:49,000
I just thought it was a very weird crop and a very weird like,

1170
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:53,080
yeah, check out check out this 12 year old wearing wearing this sweatshirt.

1171
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:54,760
Like what?

1172
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:56,840
I mean, you can still mail order.

1173
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:59,240
You can still buy all the sweatshirts and stuff.

1174
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:02,200
They have a very big store at the Orlando location, although I think

1175
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:04,600
Chicken Guy has taken over a chunk of it.

1176
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:06,760
This is modern.

1177
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:11,360
I'm showing a photo now of modern merch and I kind of like these sweatshirts.

1178
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:13,320
They're very like modern.

1179
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:16,240
They have the Planet Hollywood logo, but they're kind of like faded,

1180
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:18,640
faded, monocolor type.

1181
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:22,040
Yeah. And I like I like this is cool, but this isn't exactly

1182
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:24,920
what I want from the brand.

1183
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:27,800
You know, I want the airline one, that top gun looking one.

1184
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:31,120
Yeah, like there's some that they really look like Planet Hollywood

1185
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:34,960
is like a gym or a high school or something, which like get out.

1186
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:35,480
I don't understand.

1187
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:38,080
Why would anyone what would possess someone to buy a shirt

1188
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:43,160
from Planet Hollywood that is almost impossible to tell it's from there?

1189
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:44,000
Exactly.

1190
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,080
Yeah.

1191
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:48,760
Yeah. What is that insecurity about your shitty brand?

1192
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:49,960
I guess.

1193
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:54,120
Well, they also got some real American like I'm like over

1194
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:57,760
over designed red, white, blue eagle crap.

1195
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:01,280
Yeah. It's just founded in 1991.

1196
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:03,920
Yeah. This is looks like Patriot gear.

1197
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:07,040
And if you squint, you go, oh, it's a Planet Hollywood shirt. OK.

1198
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:10,280
And then like as far as jackets, like look at this.

1199
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:13,040
I mean, again, I'm not mad at this jacket, but it's not.

1200
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:16,080
The colorful sleeves thick,

1201
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:21,200
like Steven Spielberg bomber jacket with nine colors and only one color.

1202
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:23,000
It's one color. There's a little low.

1203
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,560
It's black. It's very form fitting.

1204
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:28,800
And it's got a Planet Hollywood logo on the left shoulder.

1205
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:31,960
Yeah. It's like it's a small again.

1206
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:34,760
It's small. It's like you'd have to you'd have to be like a woman

1207
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:37,320
would have to be slow dancing with you at a high school dance

1208
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:41,200
to read the logo because she'd be kind of looking at your arm that close.

1209
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:45,440
Yeah. You have not taken your motorcycle jacket off.

1210
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:49,560
Yeah. Now they do have here they have one varsity jacket.

1211
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:52,040
And it's that's the OG.

1212
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:53,760
That's the that's the thing. Yeah.

1213
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:56,160
Yeah. And that's one hundred and ninety dollars.

1214
00:59:56,440 --> 01:00:00,480
Do you guys watch just do you guys watch the righteous gemstones on HBO?

1215
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:01,920
Yeah. Caught up.

1216
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:05,120
But yeah, there was an episode recently that was set in the 90s

1217
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:07,800
when they were like doing a Christmas special and

1218
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:12,400
Baby Billy, who's Walton Goggins, kind of like ridiculous brother character,

1219
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:14,840
is a rock and a not.

1220
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:17,080
He said in the 90s rock and a Planet Hollywood vest.

1221
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:19,960
And it was right before we take this. I was very excited to know.

1222
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:22,120
No kidding. Oh, I wish I made it up to that.

1223
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:24,680
What a great character to be perfect.

1224
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:26,080
Planet Hollywood fan.

1225
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:28,840
That makes sense. Wow.

1226
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:33,640
You know, merchandise with the logo isn't the only thing

1227
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:37,080
that Planet Hollywood is selling, because I don't know if the question

1228
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:41,120
has occurred to any of you what happened to all of the merchandise.

1229
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:45,320
And I discovered that what happened to at least some of it

1230
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:48,480
is that they are just selling it on Amazon.

1231
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:53,000
There is a store called the Planet Hollywood Collectibles store.

1232
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:56,600
And I'm going to share screen here.

1233
01:00:56,680 --> 01:01:00,000
Again, maybe I've overloaded with too many windows.

1234
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:01,720
Let me let me drop a few.

1235
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:03,080
But yeah, you can.

1236
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:06,720
There is a store you can find.

1237
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:11,520
That is just like random props and you could just buy it now.

1238
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:13,600
It's not an auction.

1239
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:15,520
You can just go straight to it.

1240
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:18,400
Is it eBay or Amazon? Amazon, weirdly.

1241
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:20,400
OK, because then yeah, wouldn't be an auction on Amazon.

1242
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:23,080
Oh, so when you say merchandise, you don't you don't mean like the jackets and stuff.

1243
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:24,480
You mean like the props?

1244
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:25,800
I mean, the props. Yeah.

1245
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:27,960
And none of them are I mean, well, you'll see.

1246
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,800
There's a few that I might describe as a little exciting

1247
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:34,960
and some that are more of the hangover regular shirt nature.

1248
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:37,280
You guys seeing this?

1249
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:41,440
I mean, we have here Rain Man's shoes,

1250
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:45,920
which are going for 700 Raymond Babbitt's shoes.

1251
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,040
And it's twenty five dollars shipping, which I don't know.

1252
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:50,280
Do you get Amazon Prime free shipping for any of these?

1253
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:52,960
I guess not. I don't think the I don't think that applies.

1254
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:54,000
I don't think they have that deal.

1255
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:57,400
I mean, I would never buy these, but it doesn't seem like the worst.

1256
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:01,160
Like that is a best picture winning movie.

1257
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:02,640
Yeah. Yeah.

1258
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:03,800
An iconic character.

1259
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:07,880
Yeah. It's like more prominent than what you would expect to find on the planet.

1260
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:08,720
Hollywood. Exactly.

1261
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:11,360
Like the Amazon store.

1262
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:13,560
Well, don't worry, we get a little deeper

1263
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:15,960
for the film buffs out there.

1264
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:20,880
What with Danny Aiello's Dosmo Pizzo ensemble

1265
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,880
from Two Days in the Valley.

1266
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:23,840
Oh, wow.

1267
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:28,480
Which is four hundred dollars for a bowling shirt, a white T-shirt, like slacks,

1268
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:32,760
big boots, which those are crazy.

1269
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:34,280
Lowest dress.

1270
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:35,640
Oh, it's socks. OK.

1271
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:36,680
I was going to say. Right. All right.

1272
01:02:36,680 --> 01:02:38,200
It looked like stockings or something.

1273
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:41,280
And then like, do you get his boxers to whatever we talk?

1274
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:42,480
What does it look like?

1275
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:45,360
Traditional white boxers. Yeah.

1276
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:46,880
We're Danny. We're boxer.

1277
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:49,160
We're underwear. Danny Aiello.

1278
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:52,320
That looks like you that looks like you could wear that to a Brian Setzer concert.

1279
01:02:55,720 --> 01:02:57,280
Well, you maybe I should.

1280
01:02:57,280 --> 01:02:59,920
One of you guys rocks one of the vests.

1281
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:02,160
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1282
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:04,360
Or a vest. Yeah. Vest underneath this, too.

1283
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:07,880
And if it's like you get too hot when you're swing dancing, you get too hot.

1284
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:11,360
Take it off and use a vest.

1285
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:14,520
Hey, this guy looks like Dosmo Pizzo over here.

1286
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:16,280
You're the coolest boy.

1287
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:18,560
Watch out. This guy jump drives in Wales.

1288
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:22,720
You think you're Danny Aiello because you're not.

1289
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:25,760
There could only be one.

1290
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:31,920
Here is Rob Schneider's costume as the character Fergie.

1291
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:35,120
It's like a it's a prison jumpsuit from Judge Dredd

1292
01:03:35,360 --> 01:03:36,880
that you can buy right now.

1293
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:39,880
Listeners for the 17,

1294
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:43,560
$1700 or $1750.

1295
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:48,120
I was a thousand dollars more than the like the rain man rain man.

1296
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:51,720
Rain man's I guess because it's more stuff.

1297
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:55,600
And then I guess maybe who cares about rain man about his shoes.

1298
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:57,800
But the shoes kind of tell you something.

1299
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:00,440
They're kind of like they they're sort of like Gump's shoes. Right.

1300
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:02,200
These are simple.

1301
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:06,840
Also, for whatever reason, I think as you I think you mentioned this earlier, Scott, like

1302
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:13,440
Planet Hollywood places a premium on anything Judge Dredd related.

1303
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:16,760
That might be part of it. Yes, that's maintained.

1304
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:21,200
And they feel like with the reboot, whenever that was three years ago,

1305
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:24,920
12 years ago, I couldn't tell you, but it's Dredd mania again.

1306
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:26,840
They keep pumping life into it.

1307
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:30,120
Well, it seems like there's still an informal relationship,

1308
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:34,280
at least a few years ago, that the that Esquire reporter

1309
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:37,880
could not get anyone on the record to say they still were involved.

1310
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:42,680
But the premieres for the 2008 Rambo and the Expendables

1311
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:46,520
were held at the Planet Hollywood Casino and Hotel in Las Vegas.

1312
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:48,480
Huh? Yeah.

1313
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:52,040
So slides kind of in the fold, a little kind of in the fold,

1314
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:55,520
but still gave a no comment of like, do you still own shares?

1315
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:59,120
Because they declared bankruptcy twice, right?

1316
01:04:59,120 --> 01:05:00,840
They declared it in 99.

1317
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:05,480
And then in 2001, they they chalked it out to the tourism downturn.

1318
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:07,840
Sure. That's a lot of other.

1319
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:10,640
Isn't there a lot of I think I sent Scott an article back when we

1320
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:12,160
I told him I wanted to.

1321
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:16,520
I mentioned that I am interested in doing this like the guy who one of the guys died.

1322
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:19,000
One of the guys died recently, right?

1323
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:19,680
This one. Yeah.

1324
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:22,320
I mean, there's you guys probably there's some I guess there's so much

1325
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:27,440
financial intrigue with this place that I feel like

1326
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:29,560
I don't only know the surface of.

1327
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:32,600
There's a bunch of stuff.

1328
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:36,320
Yeah, I can explain the characters involved.

1329
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:37,600
That's a funny character.

1330
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:38,880
What are your favorite guys?

1331
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:40,120
What are your favorite guys?

1332
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:44,600
You know, I've been dying to talk, but I'll I'll weave the whole whole tale.

1333
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:47,560
And I know you're there really quickly.

1334
01:05:47,560 --> 01:05:52,440
Just while it's up, we got a Jessica Lang's cape from Rob Roy

1335
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:54,560
for a thousand dollars.

1336
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:58,880
We got a smashing pumpkins shirt worn by Elijah Wood and Flipper.

1337
01:05:58,880 --> 01:05:59,960
Wow. And Flipper.

1338
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:01,640
That's 450.

1339
01:06:01,640 --> 01:06:04,560
That's not bad. If you were for some reason in a lot of this,

1340
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:07,600
somebody's I'm like, it was like a two hundred dollars less.

1341
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:09,640
Maybe a little and maybe they'll get there.

1342
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:12,560
They they, you know, they might not be committed to the and these

1343
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:15,200
might have all been up for like years at this point.

1344
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:17,880
So maybe we'll we'll get a little downturn.

1345
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,800
This one's pretty genuinely crazy.

1346
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:24,200
It's a John Candy life mask.

1347
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:28,760
That's how they made his his face to be barf and space balls.

1348
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,560
So it's a weird, creepy, looks like a closed eye.

1349
01:06:31,560 --> 01:06:33,720
It's John Candy's real face.

1350
01:06:33,720 --> 01:06:36,960
But with us, with a little like black painted for his snout.

1351
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:38,640
That's like, wow.

1352
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:40,480
I don't know if you were into space balls.

1353
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:41,360
That's not so bad.

1354
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:43,880
People who would like hanging this on their wall for sure.

1355
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:45,880
But for sure. Yeah. Yeah.

1356
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:48,920
That creepily mounted like you like you killed him.

1357
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:51,280
You hunted and killed barf.

1358
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:53,920
It's terrifying. But yeah.

1359
01:06:55,080 --> 01:06:58,800
This is a piece of wood that Harrison Ford

1360
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:02,120
has Jack Ryan touched in clear and present danger.

1361
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:04,840
He's in a room with lots of logs.

1362
01:07:04,840 --> 01:07:07,200
And he touched his log scene or something.

1363
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:08,600
I looked it up.

1364
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:13,000
I did find a still of him like looking confused in a room full of logs.

1365
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:14,800
I don't know why that happens.

1366
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:16,040
Maybe he beats someone like this.

1367
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:17,760
I mean, kill a guy maybe with a lot.

1368
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:18,600
I don't know. Oh, wow.

1369
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:20,440
It does seem like a scam at this point.

1370
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:23,600
Yeah. If he heard him, if Harrison Ford heard himself on the log,

1371
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:25,680
I think the price would skyrocket.

1372
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:26,800
Yeah. I don't know.

1373
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:28,720
Harrison Ford injuries are a dime a dozen.

1374
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:32,440
They have an impossible to authenticate this like, yeah, it's a log.

1375
01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:33,440
He touched a log.

1376
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:35,640
What do you say? He doesn't log. Yeah.

1377
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:36,560
Yeah. I don't.

1378
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:39,640
How can they possibly and how did we know it's the one that he touched?

1379
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:44,960
And how does that like Harrison Ford touches an item and it goes from

1380
01:07:46,120 --> 01:07:48,320
worth two dollars to three hundred fifty.

1381
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:51,480
He is he is like Christ.

1382
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:53,240
It's magic powers that way.

1383
01:07:54,360 --> 01:07:57,440
We have some actual silk stockings from silk stocking.

1384
01:07:57,440 --> 01:08:00,240
Wow. The silk stockings from silk stocking.

1385
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:02,040
I don't know if it's these silk stockings.

1386
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:03,640
They may have had a lot of.

1387
01:08:03,640 --> 01:08:06,720
And by the way, silk stockings, you have to keep in mind, is spelled

1388
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:09,120
like stocking, like following somebody.

1389
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:11,840
So in a way with the double play.

1390
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:15,040
But they are stockings and they're only one hundred dollars.

1391
01:08:16,240 --> 01:08:18,840
And then where am I heading?

1392
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:23,160
Oh, some leather pants that John Lithgow wore on Third Rock from the Sun.

1393
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:27,640
This is what this is one of the weirdest, like of all the things on Amazon,

1394
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:29,640
you know, like one click and you can buy this.

1395
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:32,800
I think it's really weird that any listener right now could,

1396
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:37,280
if they ponied up two thousand dollars by a Jack Benny violin.

1397
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:40,560
Well, now, now, real gas for me.

1398
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:45,680
Yeah, Jason and I may need to pull our money and do like a like the Simpsons.

1399
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:48,360
One of the first season with the comic book situations.

1400
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:52,560
No, with you'll kill your you'll kill each other with the violin.

1401
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:57,400
Benny's signature violin and bow was he was the violin part of his jam.

1402
01:08:57,400 --> 01:08:58,840
I guess that's yeah.

1403
01:08:58,840 --> 01:09:00,840
Yeah. I don't know. I don't know my Jack Benny that well.

1404
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:03,240
I'm sorry. I thought he would do it sometimes in a bit.

1405
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:06,760
Yeah. The bit was like, yeah, no one wanted to hear him play it really.

1406
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:11,840
Oh, so this one. Yeah, this one seems more famous than like John Lithgow's pants.

1407
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:13,680
Yeah, it's pretty.

1408
01:09:13,680 --> 01:09:15,160
All the respects to Lithgow.

1409
01:09:15,160 --> 01:09:17,280
Yeah, yeah, of course. Yeah, I just don't remember the pants

1410
01:09:17,280 --> 01:09:18,280
or why he was wearing leather.

1411
01:09:18,280 --> 01:09:20,520
Well, clearly, I mean, obviously, like they're there.

1412
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:24,960
If he wore those pants on episode, that's the point of the episode.

1413
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:26,240
Those are those are load bearing.

1414
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:28,000
I remember the pants episode.

1415
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,800
I think I do remember the pants.

1416
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:31,080
I watched it recently.

1417
01:09:31,080 --> 01:09:32,200
We've been rewatching it.

1418
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:37,360
And yeah, there's it's kind of like a hook, an important outfit in that episode.

1419
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:40,320
So you recognize when I brought up the pants, of course, the pants.

1420
01:09:40,320 --> 01:09:42,800
I just saw the pants. Yeah. Yeah.

1421
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:45,720
We're all laughing, but I can't wait for this us to stop recording.

1422
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:48,120
We all just go into a bidding war immediately over all this stuff.

1423
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:50,800
Excuse me a sec.

1424
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:52,880
And I'll just

1425
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:55,840
oh, and then have to do the rest of the episode through gritted teeth

1426
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:57,120
because we're really mad.

1427
01:09:57,120 --> 01:09:59,000
Damn it. I'm one of those stockings.

1428
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,920
Pat sniped me on the stockings.

1429
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:03,120
The silk stockings.

1430
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:06,440
I mean, the one I genuinely have thought of and I'm still thinking about buying

1431
01:10:06,440 --> 01:10:10,960
is a flip phone used by Michael Douglas in disclosure, which is

1432
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:13,600
you talk like mid 90s insanity.

1433
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:15,160
I love disclosure.

1434
01:10:15,160 --> 01:10:19,200
But this prop is not in very good condition.

1435
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:23,440
And frankly, I don't understand why a flip phone had to be made out of foam

1436
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:25,320
rubber to begin with.

1437
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:28,840
So I don't know that I want to pony up four hundred fifty dollars for this.

1438
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:31,480
Oh, 450 for that. Yeah.

1439
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:35,000
But I'm tempted. I really I thought about I gave it like five solid minutes.

1440
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,680
The thought of it's kind of like the it's kind of like the consolation.

1441
01:10:37,680 --> 01:10:41,080
But like you can't get the I'm sure like his cell phone from

1442
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:43,960
Wall Street is like in the Smithsonian now.

1443
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:46,920
Oh, yes. The closest thing you get.

1444
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:51,200
Yeah, there is a much more prominent Douglas cell phone. That is true.

1445
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:55,760
You know, Scott, while we're on the subject of props, could we hear from

1446
01:10:56,440 --> 01:11:00,480
certified Hollywood celeb and Planet Hollywood shareholder herself

1447
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:02,120
about Planet Hollywood's?

1448
01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:04,360
Of course. I don't know to whom you refer.

1449
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:05,960
I'm I'm on pins and needles.

1450
01:11:05,960 --> 01:11:09,560
Well, I'm referring to Miss Demi Moore herself.

1451
01:11:09,560 --> 01:11:13,520
Now I'm going to play this clip and kind of gives an image

1452
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:15,560
of Hollywood at its time.

1453
01:11:15,560 --> 01:11:17,800
What I really want to focus on is a few seconds in.

1454
01:11:17,960 --> 01:11:20,400
But I figured I'd I'd have this set up too.

1455
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:24,040
So hold on one second. Here it goes.

1456
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:26,440
One of the things Planet Hollywood has become famous for

1457
01:11:26,440 --> 01:11:28,840
is its collection of movie memorabilia.

1458
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:32,280
Each Planet Hollywood location is like a museum within a funhouse.

1459
01:11:32,680 --> 01:11:35,320
And as you might expect, the Planet Hollywood in Beverly Hills

1460
01:11:35,320 --> 01:11:37,600
has to be the champion of them all.

1461
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:41,800
So let's get down to the heavy stuff. Hardware, guns.

1462
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:44,160
Now, what would be without?

1463
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:47,200
She's at a restaurant booth holding up a big guy.

1464
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:49,240
Huge gun. That's right.

1465
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:51,440
What would movies be without guns?

1466
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:56,440
A phrase we're all constantly saying still to this day in 2022.

1467
01:11:57,160 --> 01:12:00,200
If you'll notice, she also had what appears to be the golden idol

1468
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:02,320
for a Raiders of the Lost Ark binder.

1469
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:04,440
Just not even in a case.

1470
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:08,080
Just sitting around, just sitting behind her in her giant gun.

1471
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:11,960
Somebody could spill a steel magnolia drink on that.

1472
01:12:14,280 --> 01:12:15,680
Wow, that's insane.

1473
01:12:15,680 --> 01:12:18,440
That frame of you got to post at least the whole clip.

1474
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:20,840
But I'll just clip that part. Oh, my God.

1475
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:25,160
Yeah. Her holding on the gun and bragging about like after

1476
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:29,760
kind of a dull montage of like, look, it's the outfit from the mask.

1477
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:31,560
It's the outfit from this thing.

1478
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:35,240
And then she's like, and of course, where would be without guns?

1479
01:12:35,240 --> 01:12:39,080
Wow. Chilling, chilling.

1480
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:41,720
Well, do you want to get into history a little bit?

1481
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:45,280
Or have we missed anything about like personal experiences we've had

1482
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:48,080
or fun, specific memories or food?

1483
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:52,200
Just like, like, you know, the grab bag of what makes Planet Hollywood,

1484
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:53,560
Planet Hollywood?

1485
01:12:53,560 --> 01:12:55,840
Yeah, I have a request for listeners.

1486
01:12:56,440 --> 01:13:00,320
One of the best meals I ever ate was at a Planet Hollywood.

1487
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:05,120
It was seared scallops over linguine with a lime cream sauce.

1488
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:06,320
And capers.

1489
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:08,120
And I've never had anything like it.

1490
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:12,240
If anyone has a recipe like that, because I went to a Planet Hollywood once,

1491
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:13,800
went back a few years later.

1492
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:17,000
And of course, the menu had totally changed because they were constantly

1493
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:21,080
changing the menu to little luck of improving it.

1494
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:25,600
But so you're calling for the listeners to just give you a recipe.

1495
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:28,880
That sounds like the thing to recreate your magical meal.

1496
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:32,840
One of the best meals you've ever had, which was like Seymour Skinner himself.

1497
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:35,000
I've never been able to recreate.

1498
01:13:35,960 --> 01:13:38,280
The stew. The stew.

1499
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:42,920
I well, I mean, I it seems like anyone in the world can find out

1500
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:45,280
the executive chef at that time.

1501
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:47,160
It'd be you guys.

1502
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:50,280
It's true. It's probably a way of harnessing the power of your fans.

1503
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:51,960
Yeah, yeah. Maybe, yeah.

1504
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:56,000
Maybe the man himself or woman could make you the recipe themselves.

1505
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,720
It's like a little bit.

1506
01:13:57,720 --> 01:14:00,440
I it'll make me come off as really irritating.

1507
01:14:01,120 --> 01:14:02,520
So just preface it with that.

1508
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:03,840
OK, well, you were deep in.

1509
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:04,960
People are enjoying you already.

1510
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:07,080
So I thought for them, so right now,

1511
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:09,360
but I think was probably one of the last times I was there.

1512
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:13,640
But I'm actually I went there before we saw the Beatles musical

1513
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:17,200
and we just got drinks and maybe appetizers by the bar.

1514
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:21,040
And the irritating thing is that I have to reference that.

1515
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:23,280
Like I got recognized by the waitress

1516
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:26,400
because she knew from the college she was called.

1517
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:27,680
She knew college humor stuff.

1518
01:14:27,680 --> 01:14:31,080
Oh, well, at the time, I got recognized from time to time.

1519
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:33,680
That's the irritating part. Sorry.

1520
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:36,600
No, this is an episode about celebrities.

1521
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:39,040
This was your your sly moment.

1522
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:43,080
I mean, I was like, you know, we were just my friend was laughing his ass off

1523
01:14:43,080 --> 01:14:45,000
because he just thought it was embarrassing or whatever.

1524
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:49,280
But I was like, I did ask her, I was like, I was like, oh, thanks for watching.

1525
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:52,360
That's cool. You know, and but I was like, just like out of curiosity,

1526
01:14:52,360 --> 01:14:53,560
this is Planet Hollywood.

1527
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:55,600
Like, you get a lot of celebrities here anymore.

1528
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:58,120
Like in this is like twenty seventeen, eighteen.

1529
01:14:58,640 --> 01:15:01,440
And she was like, ah, you know who was here recently?

1530
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:03,600
I was like, who? She was Kelly and Conway.

1531
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:04,640
Yeah.

1532
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:09,720
I was like, OK, well, that's me and her, I guess.

1533
01:15:09,720 --> 01:15:11,280
What a company to be in.

1534
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:14,520
So Kelly and Conway has been to the Planet Hollywood, New York.

1535
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:17,600
Wow. That's that's good.

1536
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:21,240
That's good to show that wasn't it wasn't like a just a predator suit

1537
01:15:21,240 --> 01:15:24,320
that was in the lobby.

1538
01:15:25,880 --> 01:15:27,800
You try to steal everything.

1539
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:30,800
I mean, it's like I have to like name drop or like whatever.

1540
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:31,800
It's boastful.

1541
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:36,480
But then also the it makes it like apparently in this woman's mind, I'm

1542
01:15:37,560 --> 01:15:39,440
like Kelly and Conway

1543
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:41,000
neck and neck with.

1544
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:44,600
Yeah. The Kelly and Conway of

1545
01:15:45,680 --> 01:15:48,720
2010's Internet comedy.

1546
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:51,040
If you need to use that quote on a book or something.

1547
01:15:51,040 --> 01:15:53,360
So yeah, what an honor.

1548
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:56,480
One waitress one time at a point.

1549
01:15:56,480 --> 01:16:00,360
Jason, you've been to the planet Hollywood inside the Caesars Casino

1550
01:16:00,360 --> 01:16:01,440
in Atlantic City.

1551
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:03,440
I know in Atlantic City.

1552
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:04,680
Oh, yeah. OK.

1553
01:16:04,680 --> 01:16:06,520
And multiple times.

1554
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:09,320
I think so. Yeah, I definitely have a T-shirt from there.

1555
01:16:09,640 --> 01:16:13,840
OK, because I'm reading here that the actual

1556
01:16:14,240 --> 01:16:20,200
grandpa from the Munsters, Dracula hung in this planet Hollywood.

1557
01:16:20,280 --> 01:16:22,600
What? Grandpa Al Lewis.

1558
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:24,280
Grandpa Al Lewis. Yes.

1559
01:16:24,280 --> 01:16:27,960
The location is the planet pictures of there's a, you know,

1560
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:32,400
a website called Munster coached out, of course, talks about the Munster cars.

1561
01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:36,320
We know which can now let's get specific here because we've run into

1562
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:39,080
trouble with this before. Which car are we talking?

1563
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:43,440
We're talking about the Dracula grandpa's car, which is a coffin car,

1564
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:45,320
basically like a drag race.

1565
01:16:45,320 --> 01:16:48,560
That's the distinction that grandpa's car is the Dracula, but it's not.

1566
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:50,480
You wouldn't call it the Munsters car.

1567
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:53,400
The Munster car and it's called the Munsters coach.

1568
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:57,400
And that's the bigger car that you're more you usually see them in.

1569
01:16:57,880 --> 01:17:02,200
The Dracula is from a specific episode where grandpa races.

1570
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:05,200
OK. Yeah. But but it says it's hanging.

1571
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:06,360
There's pictures of it here.

1572
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:09,960
Let me show you, Jason, just in case this jogs any memories for you.

1573
01:17:11,080 --> 01:17:14,480
I don't know. And we should say this location long gone.

1574
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:16,680
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1575
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:19,720
Yeah. It looks familiar. Yeah.

1576
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:23,560
Whoa. Wow. This is a major piece of.

1577
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:25,640
Yeah. Recent PTR.

1578
01:17:26,120 --> 01:17:28,200
Things have been very Munster heavy recently.

1579
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:30,600
So that's amazing. That's where this was. Wow.

1580
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:34,680
And then the motion of the Dorothy was kind of a rare exception of like a non

1581
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:37,880
car, like most of the like the speed bus

1582
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:43,680
speed car is so crazy real estate or the prime attractions that these places

1583
01:17:43,680 --> 01:17:47,000
had room for a bus to be hung from the ceiling.

1584
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:50,400
Well, I'm not sure how they did it, but it was like it's I'm sure you can Google it.

1585
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:52,160
But like it was bursting through the wall.

1586
01:17:52,160 --> 01:17:53,920
Like I think was only like the front of the bus.

1587
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:56,840
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1588
01:17:56,840 --> 01:17:59,960
I mean, I think I remember a lot of cars at the

1589
01:18:00,360 --> 01:18:02,960
the Disney World one, which we haven't super focused on.

1590
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:07,280
But like that thing was but ma'am, that restaurant was so crazy

1591
01:18:07,400 --> 01:18:12,600
and went up so high for like a four tiered restaurant and all in a big dome.

1592
01:18:12,840 --> 01:18:16,840
And I think this is a picture of the Disney World one.

1593
01:18:16,840 --> 01:18:19,920
I could be wrong, but the it or maybe it isn't.

1594
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:22,960
I don't know. But this is the way his world car. Right.

1595
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:25,200
The Murth Mobile Murth Mobile.

1596
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:30,280
Yeah. Big with another demolition man, naked sly next to him.

1597
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:35,280
At least if this isn't Disney World, then that could have been the one

1598
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:37,920
because that had the Herbie the love bug.

1599
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:39,360
That's what I'd rather I'd like to know what happened.

1600
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:41,480
All these cars. That's so crazy.

1601
01:18:41,480 --> 01:18:42,600
They had room for all this.

1602
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:47,120
I thought it was like this whole other like museum just for cars for of these kinds.

1603
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:50,160
I'm surprised that isn't it like some very famous museum

1604
01:18:50,240 --> 01:18:55,440
just has all like the Batmobile and there's a bunch of that because I think a number of them are made.

1605
01:18:55,440 --> 01:19:02,040
Like there is there is a small car museum at this massive chain of dealerships

1606
01:19:02,040 --> 01:19:06,160
in Van Nuys, California, and they have a bunch of the cars.

1607
01:19:06,160 --> 01:19:11,440
And you used to be able to just walk through Berris Custom Auto had a small museum.

1608
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:14,720
They did a lot of the they did the Batmobile. They did the Monsters car.

1609
01:19:15,560 --> 01:19:19,440
But I have a story about the Disney World one that Jane told me her like

1610
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:26,080
she hadn't been there, but her sister was she doesn't like things hanging above her.

1611
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:31,360
So avoid it. She would have a restaurant.

1612
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:35,600
So they her sister would try to scare her by saying there's a massive

1613
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:40,000
Woody from Toy Story in this plane on Hollywood hanging above you.

1614
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,680
There's a massive Woody from Toy Story.

1615
01:19:41,680 --> 01:19:44,080
And we thought it was like, oh, how big could it be?

1616
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:45,200
How big could it be?

1617
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:49,840
And so we found video online and we looked it up and it turns out.

1618
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:51,200
Yeah, he's pretty big.

1619
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:55,760
Jesus. Yeah, he's that's that's not what Woody's like.

1620
01:19:55,760 --> 01:19:56,880
That's so scary.

1621
01:19:57,680 --> 01:20:02,080
Yeah, he is like the size of the Home Depot 12 foot skeleton

1622
01:20:03,680 --> 01:20:08,320
hanging over like a tunnel with that sort of bent girder design.

1623
01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:10,560
This is Batman.

1624
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:11,920
This is not like a props movie.

1625
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:13,680
This is like some custom built thing, right?

1626
01:20:13,680 --> 01:20:15,440
Yeah, they didn't.

1627
01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:16,400
Yeah, they did.

1628
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:19,840
Like early on was the technology that such that you had to build a

1629
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:24,880
giant two story model of a toy to get it in the computer and scan it.

1630
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:28,160
I think it was it was just a yeah, because it was at Disney.

1631
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:32,320
They had that when we were down in Florida in 2019, I walked through the gift shop

1632
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:38,560
and I was the only one doing that and they had a lot of stuff on sale.

1633
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:42,800
So I don't know how long for the world that gift shop was,

1634
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:47,120
especially when Chicken Guy was so popular and they needed the seating.

1635
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:51,360
The yeah, the Disney World one.

1636
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:56,240
I don't know if you ever went, Pat, or have seen photos of it, but it's like.

1637
01:20:56,240 --> 01:20:56,880
I thought I had.

1638
01:20:57,440 --> 01:20:57,760
I'm sorry.

1639
01:20:57,760 --> 01:20:58,320
You go ahead.

1640
01:20:58,320 --> 01:20:59,280
Oh, no, no, no, go ahead.

1641
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:02,400
I thought I was trying to do my like little mental inventory.

1642
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:04,240
I've been to the New York one at least three times.

1643
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:08,960
And then I had this very distinct memory of going to my dad in Orlando because we

1644
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:09,920
a couple of years ago.

1645
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:13,840
My dad's an engineer and he wanted to see the last space shuttle launch.

1646
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:15,040
So we drove down.

1647
01:21:15,040 --> 01:21:16,640
We flew down there to see it.

1648
01:21:16,640 --> 01:21:18,640
But like we just stayed in Orlando proper.

1649
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:20,480
No Disney World, though, but I can't.

1650
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:21,840
It's in Disney World, right?

1651
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:23,600
It's like in actual Disney World.

1652
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:24,160
It is.

1653
01:21:24,160 --> 01:21:26,560
Yeah, it's at the what used to be pleasure.

1654
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:26,880
Right.

1655
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:28,160
They're like weird novelty.

1656
01:21:28,160 --> 01:21:32,880
You know, you know, like Orlando, not like there's a lot of themed restaurant.

1657
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:35,360
They have their own little Times Square in Orlando.

1658
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:37,600
Say different.

1659
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:39,200
Yeah, but it's in.

1660
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:40,000
You might have been there.

1661
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:43,120
It's in Disney Springs, which is like this free shopping area.

1662
01:21:43,120 --> 01:21:44,800
You could just go to it.

1663
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:48,720
What I mean is there was a restaurant that looked like it looked at the entire building

1664
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:50,400
was upside down from the outside.

1665
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:51,280
Does that ring a bell?

1666
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:52,480
Oh, that is something else.

1667
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:54,960
Yeah, that's like is that a believe it or not.

1668
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:57,360
I feel like that's that's a thing Ripley's does.

1669
01:21:57,360 --> 01:21:58,640
Well, we near that area.

1670
01:21:58,640 --> 01:22:00,000
So that's not the right.

1671
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:00,800
Sorry, there's a dead end.

1672
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:01,680
I don't know why.

1673
01:22:01,680 --> 01:22:04,800
No, no, no, that might be like I drive like I get there is a

1674
01:22:05,680 --> 01:22:10,480
lot of touristy crap and dinner theaters and big giant free standing restaurants.

1675
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:11,120
Dracula coach.

1676
01:22:11,120 --> 01:22:15,280
And I just like conflated that with like Hollywood or something.

1677
01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:18,480
Be that's no, I've never been to, but I've not been to I've been to Disney World a long

1678
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:22,480
time ago, but I've not been to the as far as I know, the Planet Hollywood down there.

1679
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:23,600
The one out there.

1680
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:28,720
It's like, I mean, this it like so captured my imagination at nine, 10 years old.

1681
01:22:28,720 --> 01:22:34,640
Whenever it opened, I remember I remember seeing it off of the freeway on the approach.

1682
01:22:34,640 --> 01:22:36,960
This is my second Disney World trip ever.

1683
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:44,720
And just like, oh, my God, like I like seeing it rise up over the trees, this mammoth globe

1684
01:22:44,720 --> 01:22:50,000
type building, which then not just that in Orlando, you got the globe at Universal,

1685
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,800
the globe and Planet Hollywood, like really globe heavy.

1686
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:53,600
What does that mean?

1687
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:58,880
It's like it's some sort of like world conquering theme.

1688
01:22:58,880 --> 01:22:59,520
I don't know.

1689
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:00,800
It's not it's creepy.

1690
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:07,760
But they I just like and walking up to that, like stick, it only got stranger and stranger.

1691
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:09,840
It felt like the peak 1994.

1692
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:13,680
It got so strange as time went on and it never changed.

1693
01:23:13,680 --> 01:23:21,120
And it's not only this huge blue marble building, but then also a UFO crashed into it.

1694
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:28,080
And also there's a big like alligator or dinosaur or something wearing a Planet Hollywood T-shirt.

1695
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:32,080
And then outside of it, they parked not there's not just the vehicles inside,

1696
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:35,680
but outside there was the fishing boat, Jenny from Forrest Gump.

1697
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:40,000
Confusingly not at a Bubba Gump.

1698
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,880
You would think they'd want to reserve that for like the biggest Bubba Gump,

1699
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:44,640
but they lost control of it.

1700
01:23:44,640 --> 01:23:44,960
I don't know.

1701
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:46,400
Is there a Bubba Gump in Orlando?

1702
01:23:47,120 --> 01:23:48,240
That's a universal.

1703
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:49,200
Yes.

1704
01:23:50,240 --> 01:23:51,760
If you could draw the corporate lines.

1705
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:53,200
Yes, they are aligned with Universal.

1706
01:23:53,200 --> 01:23:54,880
Was the UFO crashing into the building?

1707
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:57,680
Was it like a UFO from like Mars attacks or something?

1708
01:23:57,680 --> 01:23:59,840
Or was it just kind of generic UFO?

1709
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:01,600
I think just generic UFO.

1710
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:03,520
It just like serves as an awning.

1711
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:04,240
See, I don't like that.

1712
01:24:04,240 --> 01:24:07,600
I'm like why that's that's breaking the theme of the whole place to me.

1713
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:08,320
Yeah, that's true.

1714
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:11,680
It should be like make it the Independence Day ship or make it like a

1715
01:24:11,680 --> 01:24:13,120
Doc Brown's DeLorean or whatever they got.

1716
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:14,400
I don't know whether wherever they have access to.

1717
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:15,920
Or a flight of the Navigator.

1718
01:24:16,640 --> 01:24:16,880
Sure.

1719
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:17,920
I mean, yeah, that's right.

1720
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:19,520
Yeah, something Disney.

1721
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:21,280
Yeah, I don't know why they didn't get it.

1722
01:24:21,280 --> 01:24:24,640
And why is it some generic dinosaur and not 98 Godzilla?

1723
01:24:25,040 --> 01:24:27,360
That obviously would be iconic.

1724
01:24:27,360 --> 01:24:29,520
That was living in the New York one, you know?

1725
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:30,320
Yeah, yeah, of course.

1726
01:24:30,320 --> 01:24:32,480
All the pieces of the Godzilla were living in New York.

1727
01:24:34,240 --> 01:24:39,840
Anyway, I just like stylistically that location, I find it so funny that they

1728
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:44,560
basically the whole area that it's in used to be really like bright, colorful,

1729
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:48,160
gaudy 90s and it like only got stranger as time went on.

1730
01:24:48,160 --> 01:24:52,080
I remember like looking outside there as the paint is fading

1731
01:24:52,080 --> 01:24:56,560
and the little like lagoon next to it just gets dirtier and dirtier.

1732
01:24:56,560 --> 01:24:59,120
It felt like there was malaria in that water.

1733
01:24:59,120 --> 01:25:02,080
It was just so seedy, if you guys recall.

1734
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:04,640
And then they're like, we got to refresh this thing.

1735
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:08,640
They kind of like beige-ified this entire shopping center.

1736
01:25:08,640 --> 01:25:14,400
But they're like, how the hell do we change this big globe build?

1737
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:20,720
How do we like make this not abhorrent and kind of like, in my opinion, blandify it?

1738
01:25:20,720 --> 01:25:25,760
Which is why now it's the Observatory at Planet Hollywood, correct?

1739
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:26,640
Correct, yes.

1740
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:34,400
So this is how this is a redressed big blue marble, which looks cool sort of, but.

1741
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:36,080
A little more restrained.

1742
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:37,040
It's that new logo.

1743
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:39,200
It's that, yeah, it's that Vegas logo too.

1744
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:42,400
Lowercase, that's classy.

1745
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:43,920
Jason's watch style sort of.

1746
01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:44,800
Jason's watch style.

1747
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:46,480
Classy Jason watch style.

1748
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:48,160
That water still looks weird, right?

1749
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:49,760
They didn't clean the water.

1750
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:52,960
Probably far too late they have the crazy milkshake trend.

1751
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:54,560
They hopped on that trend.

1752
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:55,060
Yeah.

1753
01:25:55,440 --> 01:25:56,560
That's disgusting.

1754
01:25:56,560 --> 01:25:58,000
I mean, it's like just caked on.

1755
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,560
That building is entirely different looking than it used to be.

1756
01:26:01,280 --> 01:26:01,840
Yeah, yeah.

1757
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:06,400
They managed to figure out something else to do with a big weird round.

1758
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:11,760
As opposed to like all the other ones that are like that, like Myrtle Beach,

1759
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:13,760
they just demolished.

1760
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:14,400
Do you have that?

1761
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:15,120
Okay, that's mid construction.

1762
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:16,160
This is the original.

1763
01:26:16,160 --> 01:26:17,280
Oh, okay, okay.

1764
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:18,400
Wow, you're right.

1765
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:20,080
That's like an entirely, but you're totally right.

1766
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:20,720
That's so different.

1767
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:22,320
Yeah, yeah.

1768
01:26:22,320 --> 01:26:27,040
And the most 90s ever, which is I guess really why I'm in love with the place.

1769
01:26:27,040 --> 01:26:29,440
Ultimately, you feel the 94.

1770
01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:30,800
100% in its genes.

1771
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:31,520
Yeah, yeah.

1772
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:38,720
But anyway, I mean, is now the time to talk about the rise and fall a little bit.

1773
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:45,760
And bring my favorite character into my favorite character in restaurant fiction,

1774
01:26:46,480 --> 01:26:48,400
Robert Earl into the scene.

1775
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:51,440
Pat, are you familiar with the name Robert Earl?

1776
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:55,680
Was this the guy who I sent you his obituary when he died?

1777
01:26:55,680 --> 01:26:56,240
It is not.

1778
01:26:56,240 --> 01:26:57,200
It is not that guy.

1779
01:26:57,200 --> 01:27:02,240
So here, so if we're explaining the whole backstreet, we'll go in order of how this thing

1780
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:06,000
Yeah, no, go nuts.

1781
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:12,640
The original guy, Jason, you probably read some of this in that Esquire article,

1782
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:13,440
which is really great.

1783
01:27:13,440 --> 01:27:15,360
Kate Story is the writer on it.

1784
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:17,120
So I'm pulling from that a lot.

1785
01:27:17,120 --> 01:27:20,960
But there was, okay, so there's a producer named Keith Barish.

1786
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:23,440
He is the producer of Sophie's Choice.

1787
01:27:23,440 --> 01:27:32,320
And in his, of course, and in his, he had an actor, I don't know if it was his assistant

1788
01:27:32,320 --> 01:27:37,120
or just an actor who was around, was reading the script of the Flintstones movie

1789
01:27:37,120 --> 01:27:39,200
in this producer's office.

1790
01:27:39,200 --> 01:27:44,000
And it involved name checking a place called Holly Rock.

1791
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:48,320
And this guy, Brian Kestner, was reading and he said out loud to the producer,

1792
01:27:48,320 --> 01:27:50,000
that should be a real place.

1793
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,480
There should be a restaurant called Holly Rock.

1794
01:27:52,480 --> 01:27:55,600
And that is how Planet Hollywood got started somehow.

1795
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:55,840
Wow.

1796
01:27:55,840 --> 01:27:57,280
From those odd beginnings.

1797
01:27:58,400 --> 01:28:02,880
And I guess the idea started spinning out of, oh, a restaurant where you could sit

1798
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:07,120
next to the Ruby slippers or whatever from Wizard of Oz.

1799
01:28:08,240 --> 01:28:13,120
So that intrigued this producer who went and talked to the person

1800
01:28:13,120 --> 01:28:19,520
who's obituary found Bobby Zerum, who was a major Hollywood publicist.

1801
01:28:20,720 --> 01:28:26,000
And who seems to have all these colorful stories from the 70s and weird things about,

1802
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:30,080
if you don't promote this movie, if you don't write an article about this movie,

1803
01:28:30,080 --> 01:28:31,440
I'm going to kill myself.

1804
01:28:31,440 --> 01:28:33,200
Like he's saying that on the phone.

1805
01:28:33,200 --> 01:28:36,800
So this is like a weird Hollywood crazy story guy.

1806
01:28:38,320 --> 01:28:38,960
This producer-

1807
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:41,680
Is he a valley super in a liquor's pizza?

1808
01:28:41,680 --> 01:28:42,880
Oh yeah, I think so.

1809
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:46,320
I think a very 70s level of Hollywood crazy.

1810
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,160
This producer doesn't know anything about the restaurant business.

1811
01:28:50,160 --> 01:28:54,240
He talks to this guy, Bobby Zerum, and is there anybody you can introduce me to?

1812
01:28:54,240 --> 01:28:56,400
And he said, why, yes, Robert Earl.

1813
01:28:56,400 --> 01:28:59,520
Robert Earl is a guy I know who is part of the Hard Rock Cafe.

1814
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:01,200
He might've been running it at this point.

1815
01:29:01,200 --> 01:29:07,600
He is a theme restaurant, I mean, entrepreneur, big wig, whatever you want to call it.

1816
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:11,440
My little thesis for this zone that I wanted to describe is that Robert,

1817
01:29:11,440 --> 01:29:14,640
I think that Robert Earl is a theme restaurant addict.

1818
01:29:14,640 --> 01:29:16,640
I think that is what we're dealing with here.

1819
01:29:16,640 --> 01:29:19,600
And that kind of explains the rise and fall.

1820
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:22,720
And there's a nice little button to that theory that I have.

1821
01:29:23,280 --> 01:29:26,720
But God bless his addiction because we've all gotten so much out of it.

1822
01:29:28,240 --> 01:29:32,320
So Keith Barish is introduced.

1823
01:29:32,320 --> 01:29:34,480
This guy introduces Keith and Robert Earl.

1824
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:38,800
It should be noted also that this is the same guy, Bobby Zerum,

1825
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:42,480
who introduced Mia Farrow to Woody Allen.

1826
01:29:42,480 --> 01:29:48,480
So all of his introductions lead to a lot of good in the world.

1827
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:50,480
Anytime he can get people together.

1828
01:29:51,920 --> 01:29:56,160
So anyway, because this producer had also produced The Running Man,

1829
01:29:57,280 --> 01:29:58,080
they get cooking.

1830
01:29:58,080 --> 01:30:01,040
They start thinking like, oh, maybe we could get Arnold involved with this.

1831
01:30:01,040 --> 01:30:03,680
They literally pitched him on the set of Terminator 2.

1832
01:30:04,640 --> 01:30:07,200
And he said, yes, love it as long as we do Schnitzel.

1833
01:30:08,160 --> 01:30:11,600
Stallone seemingly big to be involved.

1834
01:30:12,480 --> 01:30:15,600
I think they might have told them and then was it Schnitzel or Strudel?

1835
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:16,480
Or Strudel?

1836
01:30:16,480 --> 01:30:17,200
Might be Strudel.

1837
01:30:17,200 --> 01:30:17,680
OK, OK.

1838
01:30:17,680 --> 01:30:19,600
Jason, would you prefer a Schnitzel?

1839
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:20,080
What is it?

1840
01:30:21,040 --> 01:30:26,160
Schnitzel is like a thin pounded pork or chicken.

1841
01:30:26,160 --> 01:30:27,360
And then it's breaded.

1842
01:30:27,360 --> 01:30:28,560
I would prefer Strudel.

1843
01:30:29,440 --> 01:30:31,760
I ate Strudel with you guys once.

1844
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:34,720
We were eating at one of the Universal hotels.

1845
01:30:34,720 --> 01:30:36,160
And I had already eaten dinner.

1846
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:37,760
So I just ordered Apple Strudel.

1847
01:30:39,200 --> 01:30:40,160
Yes, yes.

1848
01:30:40,160 --> 01:30:42,720
That's classic order from Jason.

1849
01:30:42,720 --> 01:30:44,240
It's nothing like Arnold's mom's.

1850
01:30:44,240 --> 01:30:45,680
Yeah, this is out of here.

1851
01:30:45,680 --> 01:30:47,600
Not in all the country.

1852
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:48,100
Yeah.

1853
01:30:49,840 --> 01:30:53,440
So anyways, yeah, Arnold says yes.

1854
01:30:53,440 --> 01:30:57,040
Stallone begs to be involved hearing that Arnold was involved.

1855
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:01,840
Bruce Willis said, yes, as long as my band can play all of the openings.

1856
01:31:02,400 --> 01:31:04,800
That literally was the contingent.

1857
01:31:05,520 --> 01:31:06,960
And now they're off to the races.

1858
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:09,280
And then this, I think this is from the Esquire story.

1859
01:31:10,080 --> 01:31:15,520
This is so crazy that the two partners are talking about what are we going to call it?

1860
01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:16,960
It's not really going to be Holly Rock.

1861
01:31:17,840 --> 01:31:20,720
One of them says, I have a name, but I'm not going to tell you.

1862
01:31:20,720 --> 01:31:21,600
You have a name?

1863
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:22,480
Yeah, I have a name.

1864
01:31:22,480 --> 01:31:23,760
I'm not going to tell you.

1865
01:31:23,760 --> 01:31:28,640
And as if in a scene from a movie, the two men said the name at the same time.

1866
01:31:28,640 --> 01:31:30,000
Planet Hollywood.

1867
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:30,880
Too perfect.

1868
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:31,840
I saw that too.

1869
01:31:31,840 --> 01:31:34,640
The most polished anecdote I had ever read, I think.

1870
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:41,280
I believe that the reporter was told that anecdote, but I also believe he has been

1871
01:31:41,280 --> 01:31:45,360
sitting in his office fine tuning that anecdote for years.

1872
01:31:45,360 --> 01:31:47,840
So he just has it in his back pocket, ready to go.

1873
01:31:49,280 --> 01:31:50,960
Also, the story, I guess I remember.

1874
01:31:51,760 --> 01:31:54,240
As if in a movie, they got like just adding that in there too.

1875
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:55,760
It's like Hollywood people.

1876
01:31:57,760 --> 01:32:02,480
The sheer amount of like Hollywood, hooray for Hollywood in this restaurant is just so

1877
01:32:02,480 --> 01:32:03,600
delightful to me.

1878
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:04,880
It's just how we think.

1879
01:32:04,880 --> 01:32:06,400
We think in terms of magic.

1880
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:06,880
I don't know.

1881
01:32:06,880 --> 01:32:09,840
It's a dream factory or something.

1882
01:32:09,840 --> 01:32:13,280
You know, like, you know, like you guys like if you've got like friends who are

1883
01:32:13,280 --> 01:32:16,480
like in the Writers Guild or whatever, or like anything they have to do, they'll

1884
01:32:16,480 --> 01:32:17,680
get incorporated at some point.

1885
01:32:18,480 --> 01:32:18,960
Oh, yes.

1886
01:32:18,960 --> 01:32:20,480
And you got to think your little name.

1887
01:32:20,480 --> 01:32:20,720
Yeah.

1888
01:32:20,720 --> 01:32:21,120
Yeah.

1889
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:23,120
I've always said I've always tried to convince my friends when they do it.

1890
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:27,920
I'm like, you should call it like Tinseltown Dream Factory or something like that.

1891
01:32:27,920 --> 01:32:29,920
Like, like, don't try to be clever.

1892
01:32:29,920 --> 01:32:31,520
Just make it like the night.

1893
01:32:31,760 --> 01:32:37,360
It's the same nerve of mine that just loves this whole planet Hollywood, you know,

1894
01:32:38,240 --> 01:32:39,680
T2 skeletons everywhere.

1895
01:32:40,400 --> 01:32:44,880
It's well, it's a yeah, it's a bygone era that, you know, like a little bit of

1896
01:32:44,880 --> 01:32:49,520
pixie dust falling off of the megaplex pixie dust is the megaplex production.

1897
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:52,640
It's the same DNA as like never like in the 90s on Fox.

1898
01:32:52,640 --> 01:32:54,960
They had these like specials of like, how they do that.

1899
01:32:54,960 --> 01:32:59,280
And it's like it was all CG already, but it was like, yeah, remember that commercial

1900
01:32:59,280 --> 01:33:02,960
where the girl sucks her is a Pepsi commercial, but she sucks the bottle so hard.

1901
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:04,080
She like gets sucked inside.

1902
01:33:05,360 --> 01:33:05,920
Oh, right.

1903
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:06,240
Yeah.

1904
01:33:06,240 --> 01:33:06,480
Yeah.

1905
01:33:06,480 --> 01:33:07,600
It was a whole special time.

1906
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:09,840
I made that video that commercial.

1907
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:10,400
Yeah.

1908
01:33:10,400 --> 01:33:11,120
Oh, absolutely.

1909
01:33:11,120 --> 01:33:12,240
I would eat up anything like that.

1910
01:33:12,240 --> 01:33:15,200
I think, yeah, you're you're cluing into a thing that is very special about

1911
01:33:15,200 --> 01:33:19,840
Planet Hollywood that it is like just now that we know that everything's like filmed in a

1912
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:24,560
green screen bunker in Atlanta, it's like all less all less magical.

1913
01:33:24,560 --> 01:33:28,720
The magic's a little bit gone and there isn't like and so being that was such an

1914
01:33:28,720 --> 01:33:33,280
the appeal to me as a kid is like being near the like I just watched these at home.

1915
01:33:33,280 --> 01:33:37,280
I never thought that I would be next to the masks mask.

1916
01:33:38,720 --> 01:33:44,080
And if any of that pixie dust could spill off onto me, maybe I could get into the business.

1917
01:33:44,080 --> 01:33:44,800
If you did.

1918
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:45,040
Yeah.

1919
01:33:45,040 --> 01:33:48,640
If you did like if you were starting Planet Hollywood now, it would basically just be all

1920
01:33:48,640 --> 01:33:54,080
the restaurants would have like a hard drive or a computer near all the tables and you'd be like,

1921
01:33:54,080 --> 01:33:59,840
oh, wow, this Topi Maguire is like punching arm was rendered by this computer.

1922
01:33:59,840 --> 01:34:00,400
Yes.

1923
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:05,200
In a minute, like 120 of Spider-Man.

1924
01:34:05,200 --> 01:34:05,680
Wow.

1925
01:34:05,680 --> 01:34:07,360
The computer that rendered it.

1926
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:07,680
Wow.

1927
01:34:10,160 --> 01:34:12,160
This is from this carousel.

1928
01:34:12,160 --> 01:34:12,400
Yeah.

1929
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:20,400
So anyways, the just if I could explain a little bit more about Robert Earl,

1930
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:23,840
we've talked about him before because we covered his restaurant Earl of Sandwich,

1931
01:34:24,480 --> 01:34:29,120
which is a sandwich restaurant as they might imply that's outside.

1932
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:34,240
Well, I think we yeah, I don't remember it involved like Mike Mitchell getting

1933
01:34:35,120 --> 01:34:36,400
do we go inside?

1934
01:34:36,400 --> 01:34:38,480
Do we shrink and go inside his penis?

1935
01:34:38,480 --> 01:34:41,280
Or yeah, then we went what up is your eithra.

1936
01:34:41,280 --> 01:34:45,440
Yeah, sometimes every once in a while our show has magic and scenes in it.

1937
01:34:45,520 --> 01:34:45,840
Yeah.

1938
01:34:45,840 --> 01:34:46,560
Okay.

1939
01:34:46,560 --> 01:34:48,400
Not not not always.

1940
01:34:48,400 --> 01:34:52,240
I thought this restaurant had like a was like Mars 2112 where it's like now we're going

1941
01:34:53,040 --> 01:34:54,000
inside a penis.

1942
01:34:55,760 --> 01:34:59,840
That's a hell of a theme like the human body, the human body, the restaurant.

1943
01:35:00,640 --> 01:35:01,680
Did you ever do Mars?

1944
01:35:01,680 --> 01:35:03,600
Were you ever the speaking of Times Square?

1945
01:35:03,600 --> 01:35:05,360
Yeah, Mars 2112.

1946
01:35:05,360 --> 01:35:06,000
I went there once.

1947
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:06,480
Yeah.

1948
01:35:06,480 --> 01:35:06,960
What was that?

1949
01:35:06,960 --> 01:35:08,640
What any any particular?

1950
01:35:08,640 --> 01:35:11,440
I mean, it was also kind of it felt a little last legs.

1951
01:35:11,440 --> 01:35:13,760
I mean, the saddest thing was that I mean, I'll be quick here.

1952
01:35:13,760 --> 01:35:14,000
I'm sorry.

1953
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
I never sure.

1954
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:19,040
The main thing was like the whole point is like you were supposed to get into like

1955
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:19,680
you show up.

1956
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:22,160
It's kind of like the Star Trek experience.

1957
01:35:22,160 --> 01:35:23,520
You know, the Vegas thing.

1958
01:35:23,520 --> 01:35:24,000
Oh, yeah.

1959
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:24,320
Yeah.

1960
01:35:24,320 --> 01:35:26,560
Where it's like you show up and you wait in line.

1961
01:35:26,560 --> 01:35:30,800
Then they're like, OK, get in this room and you're going to sit down and you're

1962
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:33,840
going to go on a spaceship to Mars and then the door opens the other side.

1963
01:35:33,840 --> 01:35:35,840
And then you're like a video plays.

1964
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:36,480
But we got there.

1965
01:35:36,480 --> 01:35:37,760
They're like, oh, yeah, this thing's not playing.

1966
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:38,960
So just walk into the restaurant.

1967
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:40,720
I was like, that's the whole point.

1968
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:42,800
It was good.

1969
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:47,360
I like that it's not I like that it's not a Star Trek thing.

1970
01:35:47,360 --> 01:35:48,320
It's like its own thing.

1971
01:35:49,280 --> 01:35:50,160
Original sci fi.

1972
01:35:50,160 --> 01:35:50,560
You're right.

1973
01:35:50,560 --> 01:35:52,560
Not not tied into one of the universes.

1974
01:35:52,560 --> 01:35:52,800
Yeah.

1975
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:58,160
So it's just like but were there like kind of Battlestar cyborg kind of guys,

1976
01:35:58,160 --> 01:36:01,840
but like you don't know, like I don't have never seen this armor before.

1977
01:36:01,840 --> 01:36:02,960
Yeah, it was.

1978
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:03,440
Yeah.

1979
01:36:03,440 --> 01:36:05,680
Nothing there was familiar to me in terms of likes.

1980
01:36:05,680 --> 01:36:10,080
I mean, maybe some knockoff Star Trek ship, but like it was not it was all.

1981
01:36:10,080 --> 01:36:12,080
I mean, there's not high quality.

1982
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:13,280
It was.

1983
01:36:14,240 --> 01:36:19,200
You never see that that episode of 30 Rock where Tracy Morgan's like,

1984
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:22,960
I think, son, who's kind of a con man has it has that restaurant

1985
01:36:22,960 --> 01:36:25,040
where like Godzilla's fight each other for your.

1986
01:36:25,840 --> 01:36:26,400
Oh, yeah.

1987
01:36:26,400 --> 01:36:26,640
Yeah.

1988
01:36:26,640 --> 01:36:27,520
I don't know if I saw this.

1989
01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:28,480
It's kind of a random poll.

1990
01:36:28,480 --> 01:36:32,880
Sorry, but I guarantee that restaurant is based on 2112.

1991
01:36:33,760 --> 01:36:34,080
Sure.

1992
01:36:34,080 --> 01:36:34,640
Right.

1993
01:36:34,640 --> 01:36:35,120
Yeah.

1994
01:36:35,120 --> 01:36:36,000
Godzilla fighting.

1995
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:36,640
I'm sorry.

1996
01:36:37,360 --> 01:36:38,080
They did all play.

1997
01:36:38,720 --> 01:36:40,560
They did all the aliens did dance to.

1998
01:36:40,560 --> 01:36:42,960
Don't rock the boat.

1999
01:36:44,320 --> 01:36:44,880
What?

2000
01:36:44,880 --> 01:36:45,200
Why?

2001
01:36:46,880 --> 01:36:48,160
It's not about Mars.

2002
01:36:50,720 --> 01:36:54,000
Maybe they're like Earth's fragile ecosystem or something.

2003
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:54,880
Oh, I see.

2004
01:36:54,880 --> 01:36:55,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2005
01:36:56,400 --> 01:36:56,800
Too late.

2006
01:36:56,800 --> 01:36:57,920
We're all rocking the boat.

2007
01:36:57,920 --> 01:36:58,160
Yeah.

2008
01:36:58,160 --> 01:36:58,400
Sorry.

2009
01:36:58,400 --> 01:36:59,440
That's a tangent.

2010
01:36:59,440 --> 01:37:00,960
We didn't heed the aliens warning.

2011
01:37:02,480 --> 01:37:04,080
OK, so no, no, no.

2012
01:37:04,080 --> 01:37:04,580
Anyways.

2013
01:37:05,200 --> 01:37:09,440
OK, so Robert Earl, we talked about he basically

2014
01:37:10,240 --> 01:37:12,480
I became enamored with him partially off of this.

2015
01:37:12,480 --> 01:37:14,480
It really came from reading this Planet Hollywood article

2016
01:37:14,480 --> 01:37:19,280
a number of years ago where they described this guy as like the

2017
01:37:20,160 --> 01:37:24,240
it's about the downfall of Planet Hollywood and they describe this guy as kind of like a

2018
01:37:25,040 --> 01:37:30,480
he's a pear shaped version of Dudley Moore who walks around with his pants unbuckled

2019
01:37:30,480 --> 01:37:32,000
and his shirt tails hanging out.

2020
01:37:32,720 --> 01:37:38,960
And he's kind of this like flouncy silk shirt guy who's like kind of like

2021
01:37:38,960 --> 01:37:42,880
Robin Leach a bit raw, but maybe a little whiny.

2022
01:37:42,880 --> 01:37:47,760
You get a little verruca salt in there and any videos you see,

2023
01:37:47,760 --> 01:37:54,160
he's like T. Rex's little arms around and helping himself to morsels of food.

2024
01:37:54,160 --> 01:37:56,640
He's just this very odd little character.

2025
01:37:58,320 --> 01:38:02,800
And just really quick, I'll sit to introduce you, Pat, to

2026
01:38:03,920 --> 01:38:07,360
the man who brought us this establishment and continues to fight for it.

2027
01:38:09,360 --> 01:38:12,240
Here's a selection of photos of Mr. Earl.

2028
01:38:12,240 --> 01:38:13,600
Here he is at his other.

2029
01:38:13,600 --> 01:38:16,240
He also owns Bucatabeppo, which is why they paired up.

2030
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:23,280
Well, you see on the right is actor Arnold Schwarzenegger.

2031
01:38:23,280 --> 01:38:26,320
That is the more buff fellow is also a governor.

2032
01:38:26,320 --> 01:38:30,480
And on the on the left is Robert Earl holding up a big meatball.

2033
01:38:33,680 --> 01:38:35,680
Is it eating meatball to Arnold?

2034
01:38:36,960 --> 01:38:38,000
Yeah, yeah, could be.

2035
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:39,680
Eat up nummy nums.

2036
01:38:40,560 --> 01:38:42,080
Oh, that's another thing to know.

2037
01:38:42,080 --> 01:38:46,720
Somewhere in Planet Hollywood stories, I heard like the interviewer

2038
01:38:46,720 --> 01:38:51,360
asked him a serious question about having to declare Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

2039
01:38:51,360 --> 01:38:56,560
And he said Robert Earl's answer is, oh, yes, that was the start of the wobblies.

2040
01:38:58,720 --> 01:39:02,720
Well, wait now in the in the Esquire thing, they point out like

2041
01:39:02,720 --> 01:39:08,160
he was sued by Hard Rock because he basically opened a movie version of Hard Rock.

2042
01:39:09,040 --> 01:39:15,120
And he said the lawsuit was, quote, a real bloodbath and then added,

2043
01:39:15,120 --> 01:39:19,440
I'm probably fairly litigious and it would all be in a day's work.

2044
01:39:19,440 --> 01:39:23,840
He pauses that adds, I'm a sicko, so I was probably enjoying it.

2045
01:39:25,440 --> 01:39:26,880
A bit of a sicko.

2046
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:28,320
A bit of a sicko.

2047
01:39:30,320 --> 01:39:31,920
What he's he's a character.

2048
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:32,400
Here he is.

2049
01:39:32,400 --> 01:39:32,960
Just real quick.

2050
01:39:32,960 --> 01:39:39,280
Here he is with a young, fresh faced Will Smith jumping on his back and riding him

2051
01:39:39,280 --> 01:39:42,720
with the most loving smile you could give a nonparent.

2052
01:39:43,680 --> 01:39:47,600
Here's Robert with peak 2000s, Justin and Brittany.

2053
01:39:48,720 --> 01:39:56,560
Here he is at the casino with Sly Stallone and the I guess the King of Versailles,

2054
01:39:56,560 --> 01:40:01,360
the real guy from that documentary, the Timeshare guy, Robert Siegel.

2055
01:40:02,560 --> 01:40:07,520
Or David Siegel looks like according to his name badge, David Siegel, a great villain.

2056
01:40:08,880 --> 01:40:10,400
Did he own the Planet Hollywood Hotel?

2057
01:40:11,200 --> 01:40:12,640
They had a partnership.

2058
01:40:12,640 --> 01:40:13,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2059
01:40:13,360 --> 01:40:14,880
It was called Westgate PH.

2060
01:40:15,760 --> 01:40:21,760
Yeah, well, he was trying to get he he kept fucking up and he was he wouldn't let go of it

2061
01:40:21,760 --> 01:40:24,560
and eventually did sell it to someone else.

2062
01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:27,920
But it was the Timeshare tower I think connected to Planet Hollywood.

2063
01:40:28,880 --> 01:40:29,360
Wow.

2064
01:40:29,360 --> 01:40:30,000
I see.

2065
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:30,960
Look at this.

2066
01:40:30,960 --> 01:40:33,840
Yeah, I just well, I'm glad he met Stallone.

2067
01:40:35,440 --> 01:40:37,200
He also got some fun out of it.

2068
01:40:37,200 --> 01:40:43,920
He eventually bragged about like his his horrible company did an aggressive get out the vote

2069
01:40:44,560 --> 01:40:54,480
in Florida for their employees to vote for George W. Bush and then Al Gore lost by like 500 votes.

2070
01:40:54,480 --> 01:41:00,480
And when they did the survey of the employees, like a thousand employees who said they

2071
01:41:00,480 --> 01:41:05,760
wouldn't have voted, did end up going to the polls and voting for George W. Bush.

2072
01:41:06,400 --> 01:41:10,960
So he helped sway the election.

2073
01:41:10,960 --> 01:41:11,120
Yeah.

2074
01:41:11,120 --> 01:41:12,080
Oh, God.

2075
01:41:12,080 --> 01:41:14,640
That's his most successful endeavor, I think ever.

2076
01:41:14,640 --> 01:41:16,880
That building that big stupid house.

2077
01:41:16,880 --> 01:41:19,200
Yeah, that's right.

2078
01:41:19,200 --> 01:41:25,520
That's a well, America is his big, also this photo stalling rocking a kind of a one of these like,

2079
01:41:25,520 --> 01:41:30,800
I think he's rocking a plan of sort of one of those more chic Planet Hollywood shirts

2080
01:41:30,800 --> 01:41:31,520
we were talking about.

2081
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:32,080
That's right.

2082
01:41:32,080 --> 01:41:32,640
Oh, sure.

2083
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:35,200
He can make it work.

2084
01:41:35,200 --> 01:41:39,600
Look at that weird chain to weird like snakes or something around.

2085
01:41:40,400 --> 01:41:42,400
There's a there's a really I don't want to get on this tangent,

2086
01:41:42,400 --> 01:41:45,600
but there's a really crazy ad for a Sylvester Stallone pin.

2087
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:46,240
And you watch it.

2088
01:41:46,240 --> 01:41:48,240
Oh, he's all about the pens.

2089
01:41:48,240 --> 01:41:48,640
Yeah.

2090
01:41:48,640 --> 01:41:49,520
Oh, is that a fair?

2091
01:41:49,520 --> 01:41:50,000
Yeah.

2092
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:51,280
Oh, you know about the pins.

2093
01:41:51,280 --> 01:41:54,640
If you watch the Expendables, there's like one scene in every Expendables where he's like

2094
01:41:54,640 --> 01:41:57,120
signing the welcome to the Expendables.

2095
01:41:57,120 --> 01:41:58,080
Let me sign your contract.

2096
01:41:58,080 --> 01:42:00,960
And it's like a four thousand dollar skull pen.

2097
01:42:02,160 --> 01:42:05,920
Everyone loves the paperwork sequences and the Expendables.

2098
01:42:07,760 --> 01:42:11,920
Yes, I need to know how the arrangement starts to become an Expendable.

2099
01:42:11,920 --> 01:42:15,760
I need to see lawyers looking it over and in crisp closeups.

2100
01:42:15,760 --> 01:42:20,000
So I thought they were going to until I saw these like totally sweet ass pens.

2101
01:42:20,640 --> 01:42:21,120
Wow.

2102
01:42:21,120 --> 01:42:25,280
Scott Adkins is putting on his reading glasses and taking out his official pen.

2103
01:42:27,280 --> 01:42:28,560
This might get me to watch him.

2104
01:42:28,560 --> 01:42:29,840
Actually, this does sound good.

2105
01:42:30,880 --> 01:42:33,920
And then real quick, here's Robert Earl rubbing Trump's belly.

2106
01:42:34,480 --> 01:42:38,240
And here he is with Academy Award winner Kevin Spacey.

2107
01:42:40,160 --> 01:42:41,200
Planet Hollywood event.

2108
01:42:42,160 --> 01:42:44,640
So, you know, he hobnobs with the greats.

2109
01:42:45,440 --> 01:42:47,040
He's he's he's wonderful.

2110
01:42:47,040 --> 01:42:52,800
I don't think, though, that he like in terms of like that bad of guy, I don't know.

2111
01:42:52,800 --> 01:42:54,000
I don't want to say either way.

2112
01:42:54,560 --> 01:42:57,600
You know, you probably I should just stay out of this discussion entirely.

2113
01:42:57,600 --> 01:42:59,200
You never know what it's like.

2114
01:42:59,200 --> 01:43:02,160
Other than it sounds other than him, like, I guess, being like pear shaped.

2115
01:43:02,160 --> 01:43:03,600
Nothing sounds out of the ordinary.

2116
01:43:03,600 --> 01:43:05,040
And that was and that was a quote.

2117
01:43:05,040 --> 01:43:07,600
I have not said any fruit that I think he looks like.

2118
01:43:07,600 --> 01:43:08,160
Here's Trump.

2119
01:43:08,160 --> 01:43:09,360
There's Trump.

2120
01:43:09,360 --> 01:43:11,840
The plan Hollywood Marla Maples.

2121
01:43:11,840 --> 01:43:13,920
Trump in all black everything.

2122
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:14,640
Look at the back.

2123
01:43:15,200 --> 01:43:18,800
You know, it's not bad jacket in the background that does appear to be a back.

2124
01:43:19,440 --> 01:43:23,120
I get in the background and a full cigarette ashtray.

2125
01:43:23,120 --> 01:43:23,760
Oh, man.

2126
01:43:24,320 --> 01:43:26,000
We used to be a proper country.

2127
01:43:27,440 --> 01:43:28,080
Oh, shit.

2128
01:43:28,720 --> 01:43:33,840
If he comes back in twenty, twenty four in the black turtleneck and a big black trench coat,

2129
01:43:33,840 --> 01:43:35,680
it's like, oh, fuck, we might be done.

2130
01:43:35,680 --> 01:43:36,240
Game over.

2131
01:43:36,240 --> 01:43:37,200
Yeah, yeah, I know.

2132
01:43:37,200 --> 01:43:39,840
I've this I've never been so attracted to Donald Trump.

2133
01:43:39,840 --> 01:43:42,320
I have to say that was very Bruce Wayne.

2134
01:43:42,320 --> 01:43:43,760
That look again to go back.

2135
01:43:43,760 --> 01:43:47,760
Mostly you're attracted his proximity to the back draft jacket is like, wow,

2136
01:43:47,760 --> 01:43:49,440
this guy is really the center of power.

2137
01:43:49,440 --> 01:43:49,920
I know.

2138
01:43:49,920 --> 01:43:50,240
Yeah.

2139
01:43:50,240 --> 01:43:54,560
No jealousy about being the president, being having the nuclear codes,

2140
01:43:54,560 --> 01:43:56,560
but being so close to that back draft prop.

2141
01:43:58,480 --> 01:44:02,320
So anyways, this guy is just such a funny character.

2142
01:44:02,320 --> 01:44:06,720
And I do think there is another quote from from from this Los Angeles Magazine article.

2143
01:44:06,720 --> 01:44:07,360
And this again.

2144
01:44:07,360 --> 01:44:07,520
All right.

2145
01:44:07,520 --> 01:44:11,440
So the story that I'm building of that he is a I think he's a theme restaurant addict.

2146
01:44:11,440 --> 01:44:12,560
This says a lot about him.

2147
01:44:13,200 --> 01:44:17,600
So he started he initially did some restaurant called like the Beef Eater.

2148
01:44:17,600 --> 01:44:21,120
He tried a lot of British themed restaurants in America and in Orlando.

2149
01:44:21,680 --> 01:44:27,840
He invented and operated what he estimates as 300 different chain restaurants and theme eateries.

2150
01:44:27,840 --> 01:44:33,520
Three hundred three different in England and America with names like Talk of London

2151
01:44:33,520 --> 01:44:35,280
and Medieval Banquet.

2152
01:44:35,280 --> 01:44:35,680
Wow.

2153
01:44:35,680 --> 01:44:36,320
Yeah.

2154
01:44:36,320 --> 01:44:38,240
Crown Place, just like whatever.

2155
01:44:38,960 --> 01:44:41,360
However, I can rearrange royal words.

2156
01:44:41,360 --> 01:44:42,080
Nice table.

2157
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:44,160
Works great.

2158
01:44:45,760 --> 01:44:46,800
He'd give you the thumbs up.

2159
01:44:46,800 --> 01:44:47,200
Good.

2160
01:44:47,200 --> 01:44:48,320
Keep going.

2161
01:44:48,320 --> 01:44:48,960
More.

2162
01:44:48,960 --> 01:44:49,280
More.

2163
01:44:51,520 --> 01:44:56,560
Are any of these medieval times predecessors or not just just regular British food?

2164
01:44:56,560 --> 01:45:00,480
I think they're just more like pubs or like a place where you'd go where they would make

2165
01:45:00,480 --> 01:45:06,800
the waiters where like the big weird like what are the like old British tutus?

2166
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:08,160
You know what I'm saying?

2167
01:45:08,160 --> 01:45:12,400
Like the name of it, though, like it would be like on a deck of cards.

2168
01:45:12,480 --> 01:45:12,800
Right.

2169
01:45:12,800 --> 01:45:16,080
Like in your like he's like putting a big staff in the ground.

2170
01:45:16,080 --> 01:45:17,520
A puffy pants thing.

2171
01:45:17,520 --> 01:45:18,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2172
01:45:18,320 --> 01:45:18,720
Totally.

2173
01:45:18,720 --> 01:45:19,200
Yes, exactly.

2174
01:45:19,200 --> 01:45:19,920
Yeah.

2175
01:45:19,920 --> 01:45:23,760
So they humiliated their waitstaff, making them wear stuff like that.

2176
01:45:24,640 --> 01:45:29,040
Quote, in all of these places, it's generally agreed the food was terrible.

2177
01:45:29,040 --> 01:45:34,000
Robert Earl is a very good brand developer, says Peter Romeo from Restaurant Business

2178
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:34,560
Magazine.

2179
01:45:34,560 --> 01:45:37,280
Yet food is perhaps not his strongest suit.

2180
01:45:37,280 --> 01:45:40,480
The dining room experience where the fork hits the plate.

2181
01:45:40,480 --> 01:45:41,840
That's his weakest point.

2182
01:45:42,720 --> 01:45:49,360
So besides the plate, besides what's on the plate in your restaurant, he's really good

2183
01:45:49,360 --> 01:45:55,760
at restaurants, which continues to be true because has anybody been to a Bucatabebo in

2184
01:45:55,760 --> 01:45:57,360
the recent past?

2185
01:45:57,360 --> 01:46:00,800
Not since we had to go for the city walks for the saga.

2186
01:46:00,800 --> 01:46:01,360
Yeah, yeah.

2187
01:46:02,400 --> 01:46:08,320
No, I actually, to be honest, I only learned about it at all from your guys' podcast, to

2188
01:46:08,320 --> 01:46:08,960
be honest.

2189
01:46:08,960 --> 01:46:11,360
Oh, you didn't know the brand whatsoever.

2190
01:46:11,360 --> 01:46:11,920
No, I don't know.

2191
01:46:11,920 --> 01:46:15,840
For some reason, I just was not in my maybe I didn't grow up near them or something.

2192
01:46:15,840 --> 01:46:16,480
I don't know why.

2193
01:46:16,480 --> 01:46:18,880
For whatever reason, it looks I love Italian food.

2194
01:46:20,080 --> 01:46:22,240
Then don't go to Bucatabebo.

2195
01:46:22,240 --> 01:46:24,160
Yeah, they didn't give it.

2196
01:46:24,160 --> 01:46:29,040
The place where like truly like I don't understand how you mess up garlic bread.

2197
01:46:29,040 --> 01:46:32,960
Garlic bread, like just slather butter or easy mac on bread.

2198
01:46:32,960 --> 01:46:36,800
Like it's like any like just kitchen sink ingredients.

2199
01:46:36,800 --> 01:46:37,120
Yes.

2200
01:46:37,120 --> 01:46:38,720
Yeah, yeah, any markets.

2201
01:46:38,720 --> 01:46:39,680
Those are great.

2202
01:46:39,680 --> 01:46:40,480
Throw it in the oven.

2203
01:46:40,480 --> 01:46:42,640
I don't know how they made such awful garlic bread.

2204
01:46:42,640 --> 01:46:47,280
Just on a Ventura, they could just drive down the hill from City Walk, come back with the

2205
01:46:47,280 --> 01:46:50,160
ingredients and it would be like 10 times better.

2206
01:46:51,120 --> 01:46:53,840
Kroger makes a serviceable frozen garlic bread.

2207
01:46:53,840 --> 01:46:54,880
Just to get that.

2208
01:46:54,880 --> 01:46:56,000
Just to put it right.

2209
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:57,760
You guys know what the origin of the name?

2210
01:46:57,760 --> 01:47:00,880
The name is so is so fascinating to me.

2211
01:47:00,880 --> 01:47:03,200
It's just like a city or something.

2212
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:04,960
I don't know.

2213
01:47:04,960 --> 01:47:06,560
And he didn't know he owns it now.

2214
01:47:06,560 --> 01:47:07,760
He didn't name it.

2215
01:47:07,760 --> 01:47:12,080
But I am curious in the like, yeah, does that translate to something or?

2216
01:47:12,080 --> 01:47:16,800
Well, I know it plays a big role because one of the housewives bought into a location,

2217
01:47:16,800 --> 01:47:19,840
the location in Encino or Thousand Oaks.

2218
01:47:19,840 --> 01:47:25,120
And I was happy to learn that they also mispronounce it in hilarious ways, much like I do.

2219
01:47:26,080 --> 01:47:27,920
OK, who could you say?

2220
01:47:28,720 --> 01:47:29,040
Who?

2221
01:47:29,040 --> 01:47:29,520
Sorry.

2222
01:47:29,520 --> 01:47:30,400
He says Pepo.

2223
01:47:30,400 --> 01:47:31,840
He, Jason says Pepo.

2224
01:47:31,840 --> 01:47:35,440
I said, which apparently translates to bee pole.

2225
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:38,560
I am.

2226
01:47:38,560 --> 01:47:42,080
And you've called it just Bucca, which I like as like as it's your friend.

2227
01:47:42,080 --> 01:47:43,120
He tried to get around it.

2228
01:47:43,120 --> 01:47:43,920
He tried to get around it.

2229
01:47:45,120 --> 01:47:45,520
Yeah.

2230
01:47:45,520 --> 01:47:46,800
OK, I've got the answer here.

2231
01:47:46,800 --> 01:47:47,200
If we.

2232
01:47:47,200 --> 01:47:50,320
Yeah, it's possible we've come upon this and all three of us have forgot because that's

2233
01:47:50,320 --> 01:47:52,720
forgotten because that's happened a lot, I feel like, in the show.

2234
01:47:52,720 --> 01:47:58,480
But it means my buddy's basement because I believe the first one was started in a tiny

2235
01:47:58,480 --> 01:47:59,920
basement in Minneapolis.

2236
01:48:01,200 --> 01:48:04,480
So loosely translated into my buddy's basement.

2237
01:48:05,280 --> 01:48:06,240
Bucca de Beppo.

2238
01:48:07,040 --> 01:48:10,720
Did anyone come across Robert Earle's recent endeavors?

2239
01:48:10,720 --> 01:48:14,560
Kind of a horrifying epilogue to the planet Hollywood story.

2240
01:48:14,560 --> 01:48:17,360
I mean, I have something of that nature, but.

2241
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:24,320
I yeah, you could if you if you want to read it, is it about Hollywood and Vine?

2242
01:48:24,320 --> 01:48:24,800
Yeah, yeah.

2243
01:48:24,800 --> 01:48:26,960
Let me let me let me let me go to it.

2244
01:48:26,960 --> 01:48:27,760
There's a little tease.

2245
01:48:27,760 --> 01:48:30,560
Yes, that's that's this is the story that I'm that I'm weaving here.

2246
01:48:31,520 --> 01:48:34,400
So anyways, Planet Hollywood starts.

2247
01:48:34,400 --> 01:48:35,920
They are booming.

2248
01:48:36,960 --> 01:48:41,360
One thing to say we haven't said, apparently there were in this time, people were not keeping

2249
01:48:41,360 --> 01:48:43,760
track of the movie memorabilia very well.

2250
01:48:43,760 --> 01:48:46,640
And you would think it'd be extremely expensive to get all this stuff.

2251
01:48:46,640 --> 01:48:51,600
But in fact, like nobody cared at the time now auctions, like all the stuff's going for

2252
01:48:51,600 --> 01:48:52,640
millions of dollars.

2253
01:48:52,640 --> 01:48:58,880
But they collected all of these items so easily, like the axe from the shining.

2254
01:48:59,600 --> 01:49:05,680
Apparently, they found in the in the garden shed of a guy who worked on the movie.

2255
01:49:06,720 --> 01:49:09,600
It was just sitting around all the fake blood on it.

2256
01:49:10,320 --> 01:49:14,480
And the people collecting props for the place said, what do you want for it?

2257
01:49:14,480 --> 01:49:16,640
And he said, well, I'll need another axe.

2258
01:49:17,600 --> 01:49:18,800
And that's all I had to pay.

2259
01:49:19,840 --> 01:49:20,340
Wow.

2260
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:23,760
I love this guy as I love him.

2261
01:49:24,320 --> 01:49:24,960
Yeah, yeah.

2262
01:49:25,920 --> 01:49:29,440
Do you think we could get the dusting off my shoes if we just sent them our shoes?

2263
01:49:32,240 --> 01:49:33,120
Two for two.

2264
01:49:33,120 --> 01:49:34,160
Yeah, just a nice trade.

2265
01:49:34,160 --> 01:49:34,960
They're less scuffs.

2266
01:49:34,960 --> 01:49:37,200
These shoes are better shoes.

2267
01:49:37,200 --> 01:49:39,040
These are brand new shoes for your charge.

2268
01:49:40,480 --> 01:49:44,320
So anyways, the chain gets off the ground.

2269
01:49:44,320 --> 01:49:46,080
It's big right off the bat.

2270
01:49:46,640 --> 01:49:49,440
People do love eating next to this stuff, taking pictures of it.

2271
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:53,200
As Jason said, Hard Rock Cafe, which he was currently working for,

2272
01:49:53,200 --> 01:49:57,040
he just outside of the company said, I'll do this other thing and start another thing

2273
01:49:57,040 --> 01:49:58,080
without asking them.

2274
01:49:58,080 --> 01:49:59,760
Hard Rock Cafe sues him.

2275
01:49:59,760 --> 01:50:00,720
He's not deterred.

2276
01:50:00,720 --> 01:50:01,280
I don't care.

2277
01:50:01,280 --> 01:50:03,120
He called the lawsuit bullshit.

2278
01:50:03,120 --> 01:50:05,360
That's again, theme restaurant addict.

2279
01:50:05,360 --> 01:50:06,320
He has to do this.

2280
01:50:07,120 --> 01:50:09,760
So now he's part of Hard Rock and Planet Hollywood.

2281
01:50:10,480 --> 01:50:12,000
How do we keep building this thing up?

2282
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:15,600
Gangbusters success.

2283
01:50:16,720 --> 01:50:21,680
Stevie Wonder would go around and sing Happy Birthday to people if he was in the restaurant.

2284
01:50:21,840 --> 01:50:25,600
If it was somebody's birthday and the waitstaff went, he would follow them around.

2285
01:50:25,600 --> 01:50:26,880
And I'm doing it too.

2286
01:50:26,880 --> 01:50:30,800
That's how genuinely high wattage the star power was back then.

2287
01:50:30,800 --> 01:50:35,680
Happy birthday, the regular song, or he's singing his happy birthday to you.

2288
01:50:35,680 --> 01:50:38,400
Happy is his specific happy birthday song.

2289
01:50:38,400 --> 01:50:39,520
Oh, I don't know.

2290
01:50:39,520 --> 01:50:40,160
It's a medley.

2291
01:50:40,160 --> 01:50:42,320
You get every type of happy birthday in there.

2292
01:50:42,320 --> 01:50:44,240
Also, how did he follow them around?

2293
01:50:44,240 --> 01:50:44,800
Sorry.

2294
01:50:44,800 --> 01:50:45,840
Oh, um, hmm.

2295
01:50:49,440 --> 01:50:49,600
I'm sorry.

2296
01:50:49,600 --> 01:50:50,960
Tugged on a jacket or something.

2297
01:50:50,960 --> 01:50:51,440
I'm not sure.

2298
01:50:53,040 --> 01:50:55,680
So the stars are there.

2299
01:50:55,680 --> 01:50:57,040
The events are huge.

2300
01:50:57,040 --> 01:50:59,360
They gather up more and more celebrities.

2301
01:51:00,080 --> 01:51:04,800
The company goes public and understandably because the company has so much value.

2302
01:51:04,800 --> 01:51:10,400
As Jason said, the Orlando Planet Hollywood is the largest grossing restaurant in the world.

2303
01:51:10,400 --> 01:51:12,560
They make $50 million a year.

2304
01:51:12,560 --> 01:51:13,280
Wow.

2305
01:51:13,280 --> 01:51:13,600
Yeah.

2306
01:51:13,600 --> 01:51:14,400
Can you believe that?

2307
01:51:14,400 --> 01:51:17,120
50 million for one location, which was like a mammoth.

2308
01:51:17,120 --> 01:51:21,360
I feel like they probably could fit like a thousand people at a time in there.

2309
01:51:21,360 --> 01:51:21,600
Yeah.

2310
01:51:21,600 --> 01:51:26,560
And again, as we mentioned on the dive episode, a lot of these themed restaurants,

2311
01:51:26,560 --> 01:51:30,480
it's split 50, 50 food and drink, 50, 50 merchandise.

2312
01:51:31,120 --> 01:51:36,960
So they're just moving merchandise in Orlando and Vegas like crazy in Washington,

2313
01:51:36,960 --> 01:51:38,640
D.C. or Atlantic City.

2314
01:51:39,600 --> 01:51:41,760
Who knows how much they were really moving.

2315
01:51:41,760 --> 01:51:45,840
Oh, so half the half the revenue from the Orlando one, he said.

2316
01:51:45,840 --> 01:51:50,880
I'm saying, hey, all of them, any of them, like the profitable theme restaurant

2317
01:51:51,440 --> 01:51:54,160
will be like half food and drink, half merchandise,

2318
01:51:54,160 --> 01:51:56,640
at least back in the day when they were really cooking.

2319
01:51:58,240 --> 01:52:01,440
And we see how it was doing really good on both ends there.

2320
01:52:01,440 --> 01:52:01,920
Yeah.

2321
01:52:01,920 --> 01:52:02,640
They had it tight.

2322
01:52:02,640 --> 01:52:03,120
It was.

2323
01:52:03,120 --> 01:52:03,760
Yeah.

2324
01:52:03,760 --> 01:52:03,920
Yeah.

2325
01:52:04,880 --> 01:52:09,440
I mean, we're talking about the jackets and also you mentioned the blue drinks earlier.

2326
01:52:09,440 --> 01:52:10,800
Like I just have a very visual.

2327
01:52:10,800 --> 01:52:13,760
I feel like for some reason, I feel like I,

2328
01:52:14,480 --> 01:52:19,360
I an ordinate number of friends of mine have that, like my tie glass with the

2329
01:52:19,360 --> 01:52:21,360
Planet Hollywood logo on it.

2330
01:52:21,360 --> 01:52:21,680
Yes.

2331
01:52:21,680 --> 01:52:24,720
Which is I don't have my friends don't have logos,

2332
01:52:24,720 --> 01:52:26,720
spread cups from many different places.

2333
01:52:26,720 --> 01:52:29,840
But for some reason, I've seen that cup everywhere.

2334
01:52:29,840 --> 01:52:30,320
Wow.

2335
01:52:30,320 --> 01:52:30,800
I don't know.

2336
01:52:30,800 --> 01:52:32,720
I know that sounds really specific, but.

2337
01:52:32,720 --> 01:52:33,440
That's crazy.

2338
01:52:33,440 --> 01:52:34,800
I'm really jealous, too.

2339
01:52:34,800 --> 01:52:36,480
I would like one for sure.

2340
01:52:36,480 --> 01:52:37,200
Yeah.

2341
01:52:37,200 --> 01:52:38,640
I'll steal one for you next time.

2342
01:52:38,640 --> 01:52:38,800
Yeah.

2343
01:52:38,800 --> 01:52:40,480
But yeah, from one of your friends.

2344
01:52:40,480 --> 01:52:40,720
Yes.

2345
01:52:41,120 --> 01:52:47,120
So anyways, they go public when they go public at the company is valued.

2346
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:51,680
At one point in time is higher valued higher than General Motors.

2347
01:52:52,720 --> 01:52:57,200
I don't know how that's possible, but just billions of dollars this company is worth.

2348
01:52:57,760 --> 01:53:03,600
But you go public and now you have to now you owe things to shareholders and you owe a certain

2349
01:53:03,600 --> 01:53:08,560
amount of growth, which is why they started opening restaurants to such a crazy degree.

2350
01:53:08,560 --> 01:53:14,000
And also, it all makes sense because when they do this, people show up in droves because they want

2351
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,080
to see the celebrities in Nashville.

2352
01:53:16,080 --> 01:53:23,600
Forty thousand people stood in 100 degree heat to see the Lori Petty in Moscow.

2353
01:53:25,040 --> 01:53:29,840
Moscow was such chaos that people were just like climbing up on parking garages and trying to get

2354
01:53:29,840 --> 01:53:36,640
glimpses of people and somebody got himself into an unsafe position and fell off a rooftop and died.

2355
01:53:36,720 --> 01:53:41,840
These things are such pandemonium that people are literally dying at them around the world.

2356
01:53:41,840 --> 01:53:46,240
They start going into the trash cities like Myrtle Beach and Niagara Falls,

2357
01:53:47,120 --> 01:53:49,920
which those locations look so crazy.

2358
01:53:49,920 --> 01:53:53,680
The Niagara Falls one is essentially abandoned.

2359
01:53:53,680 --> 01:53:56,480
Like all of the Planet Hollywood branding is off of it.

2360
01:53:56,480 --> 01:53:58,400
It's all just rotting away.

2361
01:53:58,400 --> 01:54:02,400
It looks like Roman ruins just being reclaimed by nature.

2362
01:54:02,400 --> 01:54:05,120
Tons of dilapidated prop cars outside.

2363
01:54:06,880 --> 01:54:12,640
Just like I could see like just constructors throwing like workers throwing like armageddon

2364
01:54:12,640 --> 01:54:15,520
spacesuits into the river and over the falls.

2365
01:54:17,120 --> 01:54:19,360
It looks like suicides to passersby.

2366
01:54:20,480 --> 01:54:22,000
Is that spaceman okay?

2367
01:54:23,360 --> 01:54:26,240
Oh, I should Jeff Rubin, you know, Jeff Rubin, right?

2368
01:54:26,240 --> 01:54:27,200
Yeah, yeah.

2369
01:54:27,200 --> 01:54:28,640
He mentioned I told him I was doing this.

2370
01:54:28,640 --> 01:54:29,280
He's very excited.

2371
01:54:29,280 --> 01:54:35,280
He just he mentioned his favorite thing that he saw at Planet Hollywood was

2372
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:39,200
the spacesuit from the movie Rocket Man.

2373
01:54:39,200 --> 01:54:41,120
Remember not the Elton John Rocket Man.

2374
01:54:43,120 --> 01:54:44,000
Who's the guy that's in it?

2375
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:45,040
Harlan Williams?

2376
01:54:45,040 --> 01:54:46,720
Yeah, Harlan Williams, Rocket Man.

2377
01:54:46,720 --> 01:54:50,240
So just it's a big inflated like fat spacesuit.

2378
01:54:51,040 --> 01:54:51,280
Wow.

2379
01:54:51,280 --> 01:54:53,200
Oh, and it is in inflated.

2380
01:54:53,200 --> 01:54:56,080
It's like so it's you're looking at the version that's full of farts.

2381
01:54:56,080 --> 01:54:56,560
Think so.

2382
01:54:56,560 --> 01:55:01,680
I think it's like it looks it's like the funny one from when the I like a chip blows it up or something.

2383
01:55:02,480 --> 01:55:04,080
Wow.

2384
01:55:04,080 --> 01:55:04,400
Wow.

2385
01:55:04,400 --> 01:55:06,400
Well, thanks, Jeff, for bringing that to our attention.

2386
01:55:06,400 --> 01:55:11,040
And thanks to our friend, Andrew Grissom, for loaning me a copy of Rocket Man on DVD

2387
01:55:11,840 --> 01:55:15,360
five years ago that I still have not returned or watched.

2388
01:55:21,520 --> 01:55:22,020
Yeah.

2389
01:55:22,960 --> 01:55:26,560
Now that there's now that there's listener heat on me, I'm going to have to do something about it.

2390
01:55:27,520 --> 01:55:31,520
So anyways, this yeah, this thing is growing to the probably this

2391
01:55:31,520 --> 01:55:37,680
unsustainable level and it's already becoming like the word is definitely out that the food is not good

2392
01:55:37,680 --> 01:55:41,920
because there's these openings that all of these top tier celebrities come to.

2393
01:55:41,920 --> 01:55:46,640
And at the openings, they always get outside caterers to make all of the food.

2394
01:55:47,200 --> 01:55:49,760
They bring in food from other places.

2395
01:55:49,760 --> 01:55:52,880
We cannot possibly make Tom Arnold eat this slop.

2396
01:55:53,440 --> 01:55:57,120
So that food reputation is getting out there.

2397
01:55:58,080 --> 01:56:02,640
Does Robert Earl say maybe we stop growing this as much?

2398
01:56:02,640 --> 01:56:05,120
Maybe we try to make this all a little more sustainable.

2399
01:56:05,120 --> 01:56:07,920
No, he wants more theme restaurants.

2400
01:56:07,920 --> 01:56:14,880
So with his own money outside of Planet Hollywood, again, he's always going around the back of the company that he works for.

2401
01:56:14,880 --> 01:56:19,760
He starts a new thing and that is called the official All-Star Cafe.

2402
01:56:19,760 --> 01:56:23,520
Does anyone remember the official All-Star Cafe, the sports restaurant?

2403
01:56:23,520 --> 01:56:25,760
I vaguely remember hearing about.

2404
01:56:25,760 --> 01:56:32,960
I mean, the whole the spin off, the other themed restaurants that Planet Hollywood tried to start could make their own episode.

2405
01:56:32,960 --> 01:56:38,240
I mean, we thought we did cover Marvel Media before because they were involved in that.

2406
01:56:38,240 --> 01:56:40,480
Yes, that's one. Yes. Yeah.

2407
01:56:40,480 --> 01:56:45,840
Yeah. Like not not enough that we're like opening restaurants in Moscow and people are falling off of buildings.

2408
01:56:46,640 --> 01:56:49,200
We got to be doing like every possible theme.

2409
01:56:49,200 --> 01:56:50,480
Marvel is a go.

2410
01:56:50,480 --> 01:56:51,840
Sports is a go.

2411
01:56:51,920 --> 01:56:57,680
He gets Shaq and Wayne Gretzky and Ken Griffey Jr. involved and and he opened their open.

2412
01:56:57,680 --> 01:57:00,960
And there's one of those in Times Square and Vegas and Cancun.

2413
01:57:00,960 --> 01:57:04,320
Disney World had one of the Wild World, a wide world of sports area.

2414
01:57:04,320 --> 01:57:10,000
But the thing that Robert Earl didn't realize is that sports appeal is very regional.

2415
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:17,520
So if you open a Times Square restaurant that Shaq endorses, you're like, I'm a Knicks fan.

2416
01:57:17,520 --> 01:57:19,280
I don't like Shaq.

2417
01:57:19,280 --> 01:57:22,560
Fuck Shaq. Why would I go to the Shaq place?

2418
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:26,160
So these started failing right away.

2419
01:57:26,160 --> 01:57:28,400
Immediately bad news.

2420
01:57:28,400 --> 01:57:33,440
But he somehow still had like a 30 million dollar evaluation from the stock market.

2421
01:57:33,440 --> 01:57:38,000
So he's coming in hot, even though these restaurants are all going to be gone in a year, like clearly.

2422
01:57:38,720 --> 01:57:41,680
But he's he's like, well, I need to rearrange things.

2423
01:57:41,680 --> 01:57:47,280
I have no choice but to dissolve this failing sports enterprise into Planet Hollywood and

2424
01:57:47,280 --> 01:57:53,600
therefore give myself more stock because my stock in the sports thing will now combine

2425
01:57:53,600 --> 01:57:59,760
with Planet Hollywood, thus diluting the stock of Arnold Stallone, Bruce Deme.

2426
01:57:59,760 --> 01:58:06,640
So his need to have this sports place also makes Arnold and Stallone all mad at him.

2427
01:58:06,640 --> 01:58:08,400
We're not making as much money.

2428
01:58:08,400 --> 01:58:11,440
And there's like a general downturn happening anyway.

2429
01:58:11,440 --> 01:58:12,960
Like the the.

2430
01:58:12,960 --> 01:58:14,080
What year is this?

2431
01:58:14,160 --> 01:58:19,520
This is we're talking like if the peak of it was 95, they made 12, 12.7 million.

2432
01:58:19,520 --> 01:58:22,880
Ninety six, they made four million in 96.

2433
01:58:22,880 --> 01:58:26,800
Their stock price was thirty two dollars and thirteen cents by 99.

2434
01:58:26,800 --> 01:58:28,000
It was one dollar.

2435
01:58:28,560 --> 01:58:31,120
That's how fast this plummet happened.

2436
01:58:31,120 --> 01:58:36,800
So this is like this is like some really insane version, even more insane version of the big

2437
01:58:36,800 --> 01:58:39,360
one of the big short is what you're describing right now.

2438
01:58:39,360 --> 01:58:41,840
Like, yeah, so much splashier money.

2439
01:58:41,840 --> 01:58:42,160
Yeah.

2440
01:58:42,960 --> 01:58:47,120
Much dumber like like with more like as opposed to like you got to really like stop and pay

2441
01:58:47,120 --> 01:58:48,640
attention to the bonds and whatever.

2442
01:58:48,640 --> 01:58:50,720
This is about Captain Crunch Chicken.

2443
01:58:50,720 --> 01:58:51,360
Yeah.

2444
01:58:51,360 --> 01:58:53,200
And the biggest stars in the world.

2445
01:58:53,200 --> 01:58:59,600
I have a video clip here that kind of sums up America's attitude towards this celebrity's

2446
01:58:59,600 --> 01:59:00,160
attitude.

2447
01:59:00,880 --> 01:59:04,640
And it's not a person you normally think of being a voice of reason.

2448
01:59:04,640 --> 01:59:05,200
Here we go.

2449
01:59:06,320 --> 01:59:08,880
I think of this is getting crazy.

2450
01:59:08,880 --> 01:59:10,960
Every one of these I go to, it gets crazier.

2451
01:59:10,960 --> 01:59:12,000
It's getting out of hand.

2452
01:59:12,880 --> 01:59:15,360
It's a lot to go through for a couple of turkey burgers and a hat.

2453
01:59:18,720 --> 01:59:22,880
It's a lot to go through for a couple of turkey burgers and a hat.

2454
01:59:22,880 --> 01:59:29,440
That's Mark Wahlberg talking to an E Entertainment reporter about the Las Vegas opening where

2455
01:59:30,400 --> 01:59:32,000
Whoopi Goldberg is carried in.

2456
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:37,040
Like Cleopatra.

2457
01:59:37,040 --> 01:59:37,440
Yes.

2458
01:59:37,440 --> 01:59:40,240
And Sylvester Stallone rides a chariot pulled by a horse.

2459
01:59:40,960 --> 01:59:45,120
Also disappointing to hear Mark Wahlberg of all people disparage burgers.

2460
01:59:45,120 --> 01:59:45,840
Yeah, really.

2461
01:59:45,840 --> 01:59:48,720
He would go on to start a business.

2462
01:59:48,720 --> 01:59:52,880
A lot of trouble into doing exactly that and a massive reality show.

2463
01:59:52,880 --> 01:59:56,960
And he just made this other crazy reality show that's just kind of like a stockholders

2464
01:59:56,960 --> 01:59:59,520
presentation for all of his various brands.

2465
01:59:59,520 --> 02:00:01,040
It's called Wall Street.

2466
02:00:01,040 --> 02:00:01,540
Yes.

2467
02:00:03,040 --> 02:00:07,280
But and there's a part where there's a Wall Street sign at the beginning and then spray

2468
02:00:07,280 --> 02:00:10,960
paint paints out the first L and turns it into an H.

2469
02:00:12,160 --> 02:00:14,640
And then it really is just like a PowerPoint.

2470
02:00:14,640 --> 02:00:17,280
But Michael Eisner appears in it very briefly.

2471
02:00:17,280 --> 02:00:18,160
So it's notable for that reason.

2472
02:00:18,160 --> 02:00:19,680
That E Reporter was familiar too.

2473
02:00:19,680 --> 02:00:24,560
I can't remember his name but that was a real flashback there for me.

2474
02:00:24,560 --> 02:00:30,720
Yeah, there's a clip, more clips of this online and the best is him talking to Dan Cortez,

2475
02:00:30,720 --> 02:00:33,120
who I believe is an MTV DJ.

2476
02:00:33,120 --> 02:00:34,720
And they go like, oh, hold on.

2477
02:00:35,280 --> 02:00:36,080
Take a step.

2478
02:00:36,080 --> 02:00:36,720
Watch out.

2479
02:00:36,800 --> 02:00:38,320
Mary Tyler Moore is walking behind.

2480
02:00:41,440 --> 02:00:45,680
But like they stay on the Dan Cortez interview and she just kind of waves.

2481
02:00:46,320 --> 02:00:46,800
Yeah.

2482
02:00:46,800 --> 02:00:47,040
Yeah.

2483
02:00:47,040 --> 02:00:48,160
This legend.

2484
02:00:48,160 --> 02:00:48,880
Get inside.

2485
02:00:48,880 --> 02:00:50,080
Yeah, get inside.

2486
02:00:50,080 --> 02:00:50,320
Yeah.

2487
02:00:50,320 --> 02:00:51,680
Look, we're going so long.

2488
02:00:51,680 --> 02:00:52,240
I apologize.

2489
02:00:52,240 --> 02:00:58,320
But the just if we're talking about crazy mashups of celebrity culture and like this is what,

2490
02:00:58,320 --> 02:00:59,440
thank God all this happened.

2491
02:00:59,440 --> 02:01:03,440
And thank God Robert had the theme restaurant addiction because we got magical moments like

2492
02:01:03,440 --> 02:01:09,280
this in Berlin, Stallone, Gerard Depardieu and the Fugees hanging out together.

2493
02:01:10,640 --> 02:01:15,520
Here's Drew Barrymore in the restaurant with a live tiger with a chain around its neck.

2494
02:01:16,080 --> 02:01:23,840
Here's Steven Seagal and a terrifying Donnie Darko bear in a crown.

2495
02:01:23,840 --> 02:01:25,200
I'm glad you got the bear too.

2496
02:01:25,200 --> 02:01:26,480
Yeah, I got the bear.

2497
02:01:26,480 --> 02:01:29,680
And in the wider shot, you can see the bear's t-shirt.

2498
02:01:29,680 --> 02:01:30,480
Oh, there it is.

2499
02:01:30,480 --> 02:01:32,640
It says Berlin groundbreaking.

2500
02:01:32,640 --> 02:01:34,000
So this isn't even the opening.

2501
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,320
This is the groundbreaking with the bear.

2502
02:01:36,320 --> 02:01:39,200
They pulled this together just to dig up a little dirt.

2503
02:01:39,200 --> 02:01:39,840
That's right.

2504
02:01:40,720 --> 02:01:41,280
Wow.

2505
02:01:41,280 --> 02:01:44,240
Oh, there wasn't a Stallone did something like that where he like

2506
02:01:44,240 --> 02:01:47,600
plows through a concrete wall for one that never opened.

2507
02:01:47,600 --> 02:01:48,720
I forget where that was.

2508
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:50,720
He destroyed it.

2509
02:01:50,720 --> 02:01:51,600
That was not planned.

2510
02:01:52,240 --> 02:01:54,240
Well, so we're going to start over now.

2511
02:01:54,240 --> 02:01:54,640
Damn it.

2512
02:01:54,640 --> 02:01:57,520
Is this bear some kind of Berlin like is he like the king?

2513
02:01:57,520 --> 02:02:00,160
He's like Berlin's official mascot or something.

2514
02:02:00,800 --> 02:02:03,840
He's got a little crown on it could be.

2515
02:02:03,840 --> 02:02:07,200
Yeah, it could just be a German thing where we're like, what is this?

2516
02:02:07,200 --> 02:02:08,160
He's the state bear.

2517
02:02:09,280 --> 02:02:10,560
I'm very scared of him.

2518
02:02:10,560 --> 02:02:11,600
He's the country bear.

2519
02:02:11,600 --> 02:02:12,960
He's their country bear.

2520
02:02:12,960 --> 02:02:13,460
Yes.

2521
02:02:13,920 --> 02:02:15,920
I didn't know Seagal was allowed.

2522
02:02:15,920 --> 02:02:19,360
I always thought Seagal like didn't get along with like the Bruce Willis's

2523
02:02:19,360 --> 02:02:21,520
and the Schwarzenegger's for some reason.

2524
02:02:21,520 --> 02:02:24,320
Oh, he's not an expendable.

2525
02:02:24,320 --> 02:02:25,200
He's not expendable.

2526
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:26,960
He's like the only one.

2527
02:02:27,520 --> 02:02:28,960
Yeah, of that type.

2528
02:02:29,040 --> 02:02:32,640
Yeah, well, maybe they sent they only sent him to ground breakings.

2529
02:02:32,640 --> 02:02:35,040
The bear is actually in the expendables.

2530
02:02:37,360 --> 02:02:39,040
They hand him a fancy pen.

2531
02:02:39,040 --> 02:02:40,400
He struggles with his paws.

2532
02:02:43,120 --> 02:02:44,560
Let's go to Sydney, Australia.

2533
02:02:44,560 --> 02:02:47,040
Here's Charlie Sheen and a koala.

2534
02:02:47,040 --> 02:02:54,080
Here's Danny Glover blowing a didgeridoo with like a shirtless,

2535
02:02:54,080 --> 02:02:55,760
shocked up native kind of guy.

2536
02:02:56,800 --> 02:03:01,680
Here's George Harrison at the Miami Planet Hollywood.

2537
02:03:01,680 --> 02:03:05,840
It does not square to me whatsoever that George Harrison would have ever set foot

2538
02:03:05,840 --> 02:03:10,160
in a planet Hollywood, much less worn this bizarre shirt that is so much like all the

2539
02:03:10,160 --> 02:03:11,520
shirts we've been looking at today.

2540
02:03:11,520 --> 02:03:12,640
That's what I was going to say.

2541
02:03:12,640 --> 02:03:14,640
He's got Converse on too.

2542
02:03:14,640 --> 02:03:15,200
He's wearing Converse.

2543
02:03:15,200 --> 02:03:18,080
He's got a suit with that shirt and then he's got Converse on as well.

2544
02:03:18,960 --> 02:03:23,040
Are all these people that we've seen like the Danny Glover,

2545
02:03:23,040 --> 02:03:26,080
George Harrison, are they like just going there to be seen?

2546
02:03:26,080 --> 02:03:28,000
Are they investors or a little bit of both?

2547
02:03:28,720 --> 02:03:35,360
Well, yeah, it started as they would give agents and celebrities like shares in lieu of payment.

2548
02:03:35,360 --> 02:03:37,920
And then at a certain point, it just got so big there.

2549
02:03:37,920 --> 02:03:40,800
They were saying like, yeah, we just need to invite them.

2550
02:03:40,800 --> 02:03:42,880
We just need to get them a hotel room or fly them.

2551
02:03:42,880 --> 02:03:44,000
Like we don't need to pay them.

2552
02:03:45,440 --> 02:03:47,520
And there's probably not and there's not that many to give.

2553
02:03:47,520 --> 02:03:51,760
And by the time Earl dilutes it all with his sports shares, then like we can't

2554
02:03:52,240 --> 02:03:54,400
Harrison was begging to get involved, I bet.

2555
02:03:55,120 --> 02:03:57,200
Yeah, but there was no room for him.

2556
02:03:59,520 --> 02:04:03,200
Here's Ken Griffey Jr. looking kind of like stressed out next to

2557
02:04:04,320 --> 02:04:07,120
Dale of Chip and Dale in a bomber jacket.

2558
02:04:07,920 --> 02:04:08,480
It's Chip.

2559
02:04:08,480 --> 02:04:09,920
He's got the brown nose, doesn't he?

2560
02:04:09,920 --> 02:04:11,040
Yeah, yeah, that is Chip.

2561
02:04:11,040 --> 02:04:12,480
Like a chocolate chip.

2562
02:04:12,480 --> 02:04:12,800
Yeah.

2563
02:04:12,800 --> 02:04:18,000
Well, I think it's stressed out because of one of like All-Star Cafe is already failing at this point.

2564
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:21,440
Good to see you, Ken.

2565
02:04:21,440 --> 02:04:22,800
It's me, Robert.

2566
02:04:22,800 --> 02:04:28,880
Before you rock the red, the red zebra carpet, you have lost 10 million dollars in the last month.

2567
02:04:28,880 --> 02:04:29,440
All right.

2568
02:04:29,440 --> 02:04:30,400
Have fun with Chip.

2569
02:04:31,840 --> 02:04:32,560
Off you go.

2570
02:04:34,960 --> 02:04:37,760
Here's here's Penny Marshall in fatigues.

2571
02:04:37,760 --> 02:04:38,880
What?

2572
02:04:38,880 --> 02:04:39,120
Yeah.

2573
02:04:39,120 --> 02:04:39,920
What's this?

2574
02:04:39,920 --> 02:04:41,200
Did she do this a lot?

2575
02:04:41,200 --> 02:04:43,520
She got the hat and the dog tags, too.

2576
02:04:43,520 --> 02:04:49,280
Maybe it's like the premiere of like what's that Danny Dan, Dan DeVito movie, Renaissance Man.

2577
02:04:49,840 --> 02:04:50,480
Oh, maybe.

2578
02:04:50,480 --> 02:04:51,280
Oh, interesting.

2579
02:04:51,440 --> 02:04:52,720
That's a pure guess.

2580
02:04:52,720 --> 02:04:54,400
Is that Laurie Petty or G.I.

2581
02:04:54,400 --> 02:04:55,040
Jane?

2582
02:04:55,040 --> 02:04:57,040
Oh, it might be Laurie Petty.

2583
02:04:57,040 --> 02:04:58,400
Laurie Petty's Lumen Lahr.

2584
02:04:58,400 --> 02:04:59,440
I got to catch up on.

2585
02:05:00,400 --> 02:05:01,440
I never seen Tangirl.

2586
02:05:01,440 --> 02:05:02,160
It's a serious movie.

2587
02:05:02,160 --> 02:05:07,440
It feels like this would be kind of but who knows a little like, yeah, like she's got to do.

2588
02:05:09,200 --> 02:05:10,720
And then what was my last?

2589
02:05:10,720 --> 02:05:14,880
Well, here's James Caan handing a child a giant machine gun

2590
02:05:17,040 --> 02:05:19,520
while a baby looks on horrified.

2591
02:05:19,520 --> 02:05:20,560
It's not quite a holiday.

2592
02:05:20,560 --> 02:05:23,360
This is like just a random photo in the middle of like Los Angeles.

2593
02:05:24,640 --> 02:05:26,000
Here, hide this for me, kid.

2594
02:05:27,760 --> 02:05:30,400
Here's oh, and this is the this is the highlight.

2595
02:05:30,400 --> 02:05:30,640
Yeah.

2596
02:05:30,640 --> 02:05:31,040
All right.

2597
02:05:31,040 --> 02:05:40,160
Here we have Bruce Willis in a fuzzy hat and sunglasses and a cut off mid-drift revealing

2598
02:05:40,160 --> 02:05:44,880
Planet Hollywood t-shirt with like his hairy chest hanging out.

2599
02:05:44,880 --> 02:05:46,240
He's got a harmonica.

2600
02:05:47,120 --> 02:05:52,640
He's got shorts kind of like riding a little too low to where we're going to start to see pubes.

2601
02:05:52,640 --> 02:05:59,920
And hanging off of him is Anna Nicole Smith showing as much bare breast as can possibly

2602
02:05:59,920 --> 02:06:02,400
be shown without nipple getting revealed.

2603
02:06:02,400 --> 02:06:02,640
Right.

2604
02:06:02,640 --> 02:06:07,040
Like there's like like that fabric is hanging on for dear life.

2605
02:06:08,480 --> 02:06:12,080
And then in the next one, they're sloppily making out.

2606
02:06:12,960 --> 02:06:13,840
Whoa.

2607
02:06:13,840 --> 02:06:17,600
But he's got the he's got the mouth organ in prime position.

2608
02:06:17,600 --> 02:06:19,200
He's got it ready to go.

2609
02:06:19,200 --> 02:06:22,320
You know, with the microphone on and everything.

2610
02:06:22,320 --> 02:06:26,400
Yeah, he's not going to look like he's like they're kind of debauched.

2611
02:06:26,400 --> 02:06:27,920
And but they're both so happy.

2612
02:06:27,920 --> 02:06:30,640
This is either like these were taken either at the

2613
02:06:31,760 --> 02:06:36,640
the highest peak of the restaurant success or like the day before they foreclosed.

2614
02:06:37,760 --> 02:06:41,600
So does it have an air of like last day before the apocalypse?

2615
02:06:42,080 --> 02:06:46,560
Like celebrating success or it's like Berlin and it's all falling apart.

2616
02:06:47,760 --> 02:06:52,320
I'd like to think that all the celebrity investors all had sex together eventually.

2617
02:06:52,320 --> 02:06:53,280
Big weird pile.

2618
02:06:53,280 --> 02:06:57,440
That's Anna Nicole and Demi and Sinbad and Tom Harcourt.

2619
02:06:57,440 --> 02:06:59,680
He was married to Demi at this point.

2620
02:06:59,680 --> 02:07:02,800
I mean, yes, it's probably their stage going like, what?

2621
02:07:03,920 --> 02:07:04,560
What is this?

2622
02:07:05,200 --> 02:07:05,920
It doesn't care.

2623
02:07:05,920 --> 02:07:06,320
I don't know.

2624
02:07:06,320 --> 02:07:08,720
The thing is really weird to me.

2625
02:07:08,720 --> 02:07:09,600
Yeah, I don't know.

2626
02:07:09,680 --> 02:07:10,080
Why am I?

2627
02:07:10,080 --> 02:07:17,280
Yeah, I'm like that seems more like nudity to me than what's going on with her breasts.

2628
02:07:18,160 --> 02:07:19,120
Exactly what you mean.

2629
02:07:19,120 --> 02:07:21,600
Yeah, the more egregious thing.

2630
02:07:21,600 --> 02:07:22,960
Yeah, a man's stomach, I guess.

2631
02:07:24,640 --> 02:07:25,040
Not here.

2632
02:07:25,040 --> 02:07:27,200
It's not like amazingly.

2633
02:07:27,200 --> 02:07:30,560
We've seen a lot of Stallone pictures and that guy's like pretty cut.

2634
02:07:30,560 --> 02:07:32,240
There's no body fat on that guy.

2635
02:07:32,240 --> 02:07:33,200
I'm amazed.

2636
02:07:33,200 --> 02:07:34,880
This is what Bruce Willis looked like.

2637
02:07:35,440 --> 02:07:36,960
You wanted him to be more shreddy.

2638
02:07:36,960 --> 02:07:39,200
I don't know if he's ever been like shredded like that.

2639
02:07:39,920 --> 02:07:41,920
Maybe not because that's not his vibe.

2640
02:07:41,920 --> 02:07:42,240
Yeah.

2641
02:07:42,240 --> 02:07:46,960
Yeah, I feel like John McClane's like an everyman, you know, just like a beat cop from New York.

2642
02:07:47,520 --> 02:07:48,160
Yeah, that's true.

2643
02:07:48,160 --> 02:07:48,480
Yeah.

2644
02:07:48,480 --> 02:07:48,800
Yeah.

2645
02:07:48,800 --> 02:07:51,280
I mean, a harmonica drinking wine coolers.

2646
02:07:52,320 --> 02:07:53,600
I've got a Willis.

2647
02:07:53,600 --> 02:07:54,800
This was in Esquire.

2648
02:07:54,800 --> 02:07:56,240
What are their photo collages?

2649
02:07:57,200 --> 02:08:03,040
This is one of the other big gets where you're like, I can't believe he's there,

2650
02:08:03,040 --> 02:08:05,680
but he's there in like the funniest fashion.

2651
02:08:07,440 --> 02:08:08,320
It's Jack.

2652
02:08:09,120 --> 02:08:10,640
They got wow.

2653
02:08:10,640 --> 02:08:11,280
Wow.

2654
02:08:11,280 --> 02:08:14,320
You don't say that seems like too a little too big in a way.

2655
02:08:14,960 --> 02:08:15,360
Yeah.

2656
02:08:15,360 --> 02:08:18,480
Well, here I'm trying to get the photo up again.

2657
02:08:19,200 --> 02:08:22,960
He's got an open bottle of Jack Daniels and a full glass of it.

2658
02:08:24,320 --> 02:08:27,120
Just cigarettes hanging out to who's that?

2659
02:08:27,120 --> 02:08:28,960
Who's that to me more than to me?

2660
02:08:28,960 --> 02:08:30,240
That's to me and Bruce.

2661
02:08:30,240 --> 02:08:32,560
Yeah, Bruce at his at his hangout spot.

2662
02:08:32,560 --> 02:08:33,920
You know, what is this photo?

2663
02:08:33,920 --> 02:08:35,920
Like, is this like 11 year olds collage?

2664
02:08:36,640 --> 02:08:40,000
No, the Esquire did the photos like it was a scrapbook.

2665
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:40,480
Oh, I see.

2666
02:08:40,480 --> 02:08:41,440
It was pretty cool.

2667
02:08:41,440 --> 02:08:41,680
Yeah.

2668
02:08:42,240 --> 02:08:44,560
I was not making fun of your Photoshop skills.

2669
02:08:48,240 --> 02:08:54,000
Apparently Nelson Mandela would show up to like truly like the hugest people on earth.

2670
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:59,840
Nelson Mandela dined with Harry Belafonte and Danny Glover at the private room at the Times Square one.

2671
02:09:00,800 --> 02:09:02,320
The Maryland room, of course.

2672
02:09:02,320 --> 02:09:03,200
The Maryland.

2673
02:09:03,200 --> 02:09:03,440
Yeah.

2674
02:09:03,440 --> 02:09:03,840
Yeah.

2675
02:09:03,840 --> 02:09:04,560
We all know.

2676
02:09:04,560 --> 02:09:05,600
I don't even need to say it.

2677
02:09:05,600 --> 02:09:06,720
We all know.

2678
02:09:06,720 --> 02:09:11,200
In my brain, like no matter who like Belafonte or Nelson Mandela, like whenever they show up,

2679
02:09:11,200 --> 02:09:15,680
they come like leather jackets, sunglasses, shotgun and like,

2680
02:09:15,680 --> 02:09:19,520
John John John John John John John John John.

2681
02:09:19,520 --> 02:09:20,320
The Terminator thing.

2682
02:09:21,360 --> 02:09:23,840
They played that through the entire restaurant.

2683
02:09:23,840 --> 02:09:25,360
Yeah, that's just like a rule.

2684
02:09:25,360 --> 02:09:28,560
You have to wear that and that music plays.

2685
02:09:29,440 --> 02:09:32,000
And then they all played individual harmonica solos.

2686
02:09:32,880 --> 02:09:34,000
Go Mandela, go.

2687
02:09:36,080 --> 02:09:42,960
So anyways, hedonism, craziness, the biggest stars in the world, but it's starting to unravel.

2688
02:09:42,960 --> 02:09:48,000
Every one of these restaurants cost a million dollars to build and then a million dollars to promote.

2689
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:51,840
But again, does Robert turn around and slow the ship down?

2690
02:09:51,840 --> 02:09:52,480
No.

2691
02:09:52,480 --> 02:09:53,520
Ahead we go.

2692
02:09:53,520 --> 02:09:55,520
Marvel Mania, I say.

2693
02:09:55,520 --> 02:09:57,600
Cool Planet, I say.

2694
02:09:57,600 --> 02:10:05,200
An ice cream store with a whoopee Goldberg flavor and with no further elaboration in this article.

2695
02:10:05,200 --> 02:10:08,000
And apparently also a flavor called Blueberrymore.

2696
02:10:09,040 --> 02:10:10,000
These existed.

2697
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:17,120
There were a third street promenade had Cool Planet, a plant, the Planet Hollywood ice cream place.

2698
02:10:17,120 --> 02:10:18,720
I can't find any photos of this.

2699
02:10:18,720 --> 02:10:20,240
Nobody bothered to document it.

2700
02:10:21,360 --> 02:10:21,840
Why?

2701
02:10:21,840 --> 02:10:23,840
Why are we diluting things so much?

2702
02:10:23,840 --> 02:10:25,760
But surely he would stop there, right?

2703
02:10:25,760 --> 02:10:30,720
No, he decided what if there was a theme restaurant based around music?

2704
02:10:30,720 --> 02:10:35,120
And perhaps somebody should have said there already was that you worked for it.

2705
02:10:35,120 --> 02:10:36,880
You left that to do this.

2706
02:10:36,880 --> 02:10:38,400
No, no, I won one.

2707
02:10:40,320 --> 02:10:43,840
And thus he opened a place called Sound Republic.

2708
02:10:43,840 --> 02:10:49,040
Hard Rock is your that's your grandpa's music themed restaurant.

2709
02:10:49,040 --> 02:10:51,200
Sound Republic is the future.

2710
02:10:51,200 --> 02:10:56,800
It costs 28 million dollars to build the single location.

2711
02:10:56,800 --> 02:11:01,920
So how do you turn a profit from a restaurant with it that costs 28 million dollars?

2712
02:11:02,080 --> 02:11:06,880
So all of this to say things start unraveling.

2713
02:11:06,880 --> 02:11:08,480
There are way too many of these plant Hollywood's.

2714
02:11:08,480 --> 02:11:12,720
They start closing every one of these spinoffs closes almost immediately.

2715
02:11:13,440 --> 02:11:17,600
The original founder, Keith Barish left 2000 Arnold left.

2716
02:11:17,600 --> 02:11:21,120
So they still get together to give each other meatballs or whatever.

2717
02:11:22,480 --> 02:11:23,440
He would not be back.

2718
02:11:24,560 --> 02:11:26,080
In one case, he would not be back.

2719
02:11:28,400 --> 02:11:30,400
Then they're asking him in this article, what are you going to do?

2720
02:11:30,400 --> 02:11:31,360
You got to turn this thing around.

2721
02:11:31,360 --> 02:11:34,960
He says, I know it's not called Planet Hollywood anymore.

2722
02:11:34,960 --> 02:11:36,960
It's called Planet 2000.

2723
02:11:37,680 --> 02:11:38,000
Great.

2724
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:38,720
That'll do it.

2725
02:11:41,360 --> 02:11:43,520
Apparently, that's what they did in Miami.

2726
02:11:43,520 --> 02:11:45,760
They just changed it to Planet 2000.

2727
02:11:45,760 --> 02:11:50,000
That might have George Harrison may have set foot in Planet 2000 in his life.

2728
02:11:50,640 --> 02:11:52,320
Two locations in Miami.

2729
02:11:52,320 --> 02:11:53,760
You know, always good to have two.

2730
02:11:54,320 --> 02:11:55,920
There's two just in Miami.

2731
02:11:55,920 --> 02:11:58,480
So Planet Hollywood is different than Planet 2000.

2732
02:11:58,480 --> 02:11:59,360
Oh, I guess so.

2733
02:12:00,240 --> 02:12:01,120
I want that shirt.

2734
02:12:01,120 --> 02:12:04,560
I want to plan 2000 sure that sounds like a limited edition kind of thing.

2735
02:12:04,560 --> 02:12:05,440
Yeah, they not exist.

2736
02:12:05,440 --> 02:12:06,400
They exist at all.

2737
02:12:06,400 --> 02:12:08,160
That's $2,000 at least.

2738
02:12:08,960 --> 02:12:10,240
And this was in the year 2000.

2739
02:12:10,240 --> 02:12:11,120
I assume.

2740
02:12:11,120 --> 02:12:12,000
Probably almost.

2741
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:13,760
Yeah, a lot of symmetry.

2742
02:12:15,280 --> 02:12:21,760
Anyway, they were here though, because it was that and Fox was called Fox 2000 for briefly.

2743
02:12:21,760 --> 02:12:22,880
And then right.

2744
02:12:22,880 --> 02:12:25,200
Why brothers 2000 was just a movie.

2745
02:12:25,200 --> 02:12:29,440
They just called it 2000 in 98 way before 2000.

2746
02:12:29,440 --> 02:12:29,840
That's right.

2747
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:37,520
Um, and then the idea was like, what if we get new cooler celebrities involved like Ben

2748
02:12:37,520 --> 02:12:39,520
Affleck and in sync?

2749
02:12:39,520 --> 02:12:42,320
What if we steal in sinks money?

2750
02:12:42,320 --> 02:12:44,240
Okay, do anything for you.

2751
02:12:44,240 --> 02:12:47,440
Well, it's no Jacob Sartorius, but that'll come at time.

2752
02:12:50,960 --> 02:12:54,160
He's like, not even probably wasn't alive.

2753
02:12:55,280 --> 02:12:55,920
Probably not.

2754
02:12:55,920 --> 02:13:00,320
Like he was, I think his parents were like, not even they were minors still, I think.

2755
02:13:00,480 --> 02:13:02,240
Yeah, I looked him up.

2756
02:13:02,240 --> 02:13:02,880
He's 19.

2757
02:13:02,880 --> 02:13:04,880
So yeah, he was 19 now.

2758
02:13:04,880 --> 02:13:05,440
Yeah.

2759
02:13:05,440 --> 02:13:05,840
Yeah.

2760
02:13:05,840 --> 02:13:10,160
Jacob, if all the listeners are like, God, these guys are so ignorant.

2761
02:13:10,160 --> 02:13:13,360
I went through a huge Jacob Sartorius era.

2762
02:13:13,360 --> 02:13:17,760
Well, younger listeners probably know him, but it would be weird if we were 36 year olds

2763
02:13:17,760 --> 02:13:20,080
and like, well, of course we know Jacob Sartorius.

2764
02:13:21,440 --> 02:13:23,360
Well, one of us is like that.

2765
02:13:23,360 --> 02:13:23,760
That's true.

2766
02:13:23,760 --> 02:13:24,880
Jason, you are like that.

2767
02:13:25,600 --> 02:13:30,320
I thought you would have like come across him in like the tween fest, like, like, like

2768
02:13:30,320 --> 02:13:31,760
as a reference point.

2769
02:13:31,760 --> 02:13:33,120
What medium was he on?

2770
02:13:33,120 --> 02:13:42,240
Was he like, who fucking knows like vine or like, uh, uh, uh, some like doomed like planet

2771
02:13:42,240 --> 02:13:43,600
Hollywood social media app.

2772
02:13:43,600 --> 02:13:47,040
They tried like pH plus.

2773
02:13:48,960 --> 02:13:52,240
Mike, what was the WWE one that they went in?

2774
02:13:52,240 --> 02:13:54,400
Well, there was a, it wasn't theirs, but it was tout.

2775
02:13:55,440 --> 02:13:55,680
Yeah.

2776
02:13:55,680 --> 02:13:56,720
He might've been on tout.

2777
02:13:56,720 --> 02:13:58,000
He might've been on vine.

2778
02:13:58,000 --> 02:13:59,120
Tout about tout.

2779
02:14:00,560 --> 02:14:00,960
Yeah.

2780
02:14:00,960 --> 02:14:02,880
So look, the wheels start coming off.

2781
02:14:02,880 --> 02:14:07,440
They declare, uh, they, they declare bankruptcy, a bit of the wobblies.

2782
02:14:07,440 --> 02:14:13,280
Um, and yet this motherfucker manages to keep the brand alive despite two

2783
02:14:13,280 --> 02:14:15,920
bankruptcies, despite losing the celebrities.

2784
02:14:15,920 --> 02:14:18,160
We of course know it is still the casino.

2785
02:14:18,160 --> 02:14:20,400
The restaurants are still around a little bit.

2786
02:14:20,400 --> 02:14:22,880
New ones are, are opening up.

2787
02:14:22,960 --> 02:14:27,520
And not only that, he has not turned his back on new theme restaurants.

2788
02:14:27,520 --> 02:14:29,360
He is a theme restaurant addict.

2789
02:14:29,360 --> 02:14:30,800
We know about Earl of Sandwich.

2790
02:14:30,800 --> 02:14:33,680
We know about chicken guy with Guy Fieri.

2791
02:14:33,680 --> 02:14:37,120
And this brings us to what Jason was alluding to.

2792
02:14:38,400 --> 02:14:42,000
A monkey's per, a monkey's paw curled somewhere.

2793
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:46,560
Someone said like, I wish we had something like planet Hollywood and it just curled.

2794
02:14:47,840 --> 02:14:52,240
And thus, but thus, you know, Robert's generation had to combine with the

2795
02:14:52,240 --> 02:14:53,920
Sartorius generation.

2796
02:14:53,920 --> 02:14:58,800
And luckily he had a Sartor, a member of the Sartorius generation in his own family.

2797
02:14:58,800 --> 02:15:00,800
And that is his son.

2798
02:15:01,360 --> 02:15:03,440
This is Robbie Earl.

2799
02:15:03,440 --> 02:15:09,280
He has a kid now and his kid opened a restaurant called the Breakfast Club.

2800
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:14,880
There is a new generation of Earl theme restaurant addiction.

2801
02:15:14,880 --> 02:15:17,680
The Breakfast Club is at Hollywood and Vine.

2802
02:15:17,840 --> 02:15:23,840
It is described as a restaurant where influencers and vloggers eat regularly.

2803
02:15:23,840 --> 02:15:28,320
Like a new media planet Hollywood with no proof.

2804
02:15:28,320 --> 02:15:34,320
There's no, like, there's no pictures of Sartorius hanging out or whoever the hell is popular.

2805
02:15:34,320 --> 02:15:35,440
Any of these Tik Tokers.

2806
02:15:37,040 --> 02:15:40,720
You would think that would be important to a place that's all about social media and

2807
02:15:40,720 --> 02:15:43,520
influencing to have a lot of documentation of it.

2808
02:15:43,520 --> 02:15:47,360
Well, it's an authentic place where they can create content, Mike.

2809
02:15:47,360 --> 02:15:50,720
You know, get yourself an $18 breakfast burrito.

2810
02:15:50,720 --> 02:15:55,040
You know, the breakfast meal that's usually famous for being under $10.

2811
02:15:56,720 --> 02:15:57,360
Delicious.

2812
02:15:58,320 --> 02:15:59,600
I'm a mascot.

2813
02:15:59,600 --> 02:16:00,800
I feel like you have to mention the man.

2814
02:16:02,880 --> 02:16:04,080
What's up with this mascot?

2815
02:16:05,200 --> 02:16:09,360
Well, he's a pretty like these are real pre NFT is what he is.

2816
02:16:09,360 --> 02:16:13,760
He's like he's he was an ugly animal before it was cool.

2817
02:16:13,760 --> 02:16:17,200
This is he's like a real like kind of sly perverted panda.

2818
02:16:17,840 --> 02:16:22,560
It's like a lounging stone panda rubbing a nipple.

2819
02:16:22,560 --> 02:16:23,760
What is the cause?

2820
02:16:23,760 --> 02:16:26,800
He's rubbing his own tummy like Robert was rubbing Trump's.

2821
02:16:28,480 --> 02:16:29,920
Do they only serve breakfast here?

2822
02:16:31,360 --> 02:16:32,080
I think they do.

2823
02:16:32,080 --> 02:16:33,600
I think they're only open in the morning.

2824
02:16:33,600 --> 02:16:36,000
And then you end, you know, just kind of like basic stuff.

2825
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:40,480
Like, here's the pancake platter, you know, with just and they got some toppings and stuff.

2826
02:16:40,480 --> 02:16:44,560
And so it's a couple of pancakes with syrup and butter and it's only $24.

2827
02:16:45,200 --> 02:16:49,920
It's a reasonable price for what you can make at home for 60 cents.

2828
02:16:49,920 --> 02:16:51,760
It comes on a big piece of wood, though.

2829
02:16:52,400 --> 02:16:53,360
Yeah, that's true.

2830
02:16:53,360 --> 02:16:54,720
I'm intrigued by that piece of wood.

2831
02:16:54,720 --> 02:16:58,400
I don't think you get to keep it, but I'm interested why it's like it's not a plate.

2832
02:16:58,400 --> 02:16:59,600
It's a slab.

2833
02:17:00,160 --> 02:17:04,000
That was for that was touched by Harrison Ford and clear and present danger.

2834
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:05,200
It's from the old collection.

2835
02:17:05,200 --> 02:17:07,280
I have to bid on these meals.

2836
02:17:09,280 --> 02:17:10,560
I got up to a thousand.

2837
02:17:10,560 --> 02:17:11,600
I would like to go here.

2838
02:17:11,600 --> 02:17:12,960
I would like to go here soon.

2839
02:17:12,960 --> 02:17:13,440
And it's.

2840
02:17:13,440 --> 02:17:14,160
You want to go?

2841
02:17:14,160 --> 02:17:16,080
Well, it's at Hollywood and Vine, Mike.

2842
02:17:16,080 --> 02:17:19,120
And I believe they love going to Hollywood and Vine.

2843
02:17:19,120 --> 02:17:21,520
You love that famous cross section.

2844
02:17:23,360 --> 02:17:28,320
I believe they also imply that Robert Earl may have helped create

2845
02:17:28,960 --> 02:17:34,400
helped with the developing 1600 fine, which I think not 100% sure.

2846
02:17:34,400 --> 02:17:37,680
I believe it's the apartment building where all the content creators,

2847
02:17:37,680 --> 02:17:40,320
all the vine people used to live in one apartment.

2848
02:17:40,320 --> 02:17:41,120
Wow, really?

2849
02:17:41,120 --> 02:17:41,680
Building.

2850
02:17:41,680 --> 02:17:44,880
And now I'm sure they pivoted to tick tock or whatever.

2851
02:17:45,600 --> 02:17:48,720
But it is right around the corner.

2852
02:17:48,720 --> 02:17:53,520
They had to find a new avenue that was called tick tock just to make the symmetry go on.

2853
02:17:53,520 --> 02:17:54,020
Yeah.

2854
02:17:54,960 --> 02:17:55,360
Wow.

2855
02:17:55,360 --> 02:17:58,480
I think this this proves though that Robert Earl, if we could get a hold of him,

2856
02:17:58,480 --> 02:17:59,680
would maybe do a podcast.

2857
02:18:00,320 --> 02:18:00,880
Oh, God.

2858
02:18:00,880 --> 02:18:01,840
Podcast restaurant.

2859
02:18:02,400 --> 02:18:03,360
Oh, you're right.

2860
02:18:03,360 --> 02:18:04,880
Oh, interesting.

2861
02:18:04,880 --> 02:18:06,560
Oh, he's going to launch our.

2862
02:18:06,560 --> 02:18:07,120
Oh, yeah.

2863
02:18:07,120 --> 02:18:07,920
I mean, like.

2864
02:18:07,920 --> 02:18:08,560
What would be called?

2865
02:18:08,640 --> 02:18:13,680
He called like rate and like eat and subscribe or.

2866
02:18:14,240 --> 02:18:14,960
That's yeah.

2867
02:18:14,960 --> 02:18:15,460
Yeah.

2868
02:18:16,480 --> 02:18:17,040
It would depend.

2869
02:18:17,040 --> 02:18:18,480
I mean, if it's a full restaurant.

2870
02:18:18,480 --> 02:18:20,160
Yeah, I mean, I guess you could go niche.

2871
02:18:20,160 --> 02:18:23,280
You could be ice cream like planet or whatever the name of the planet.

2872
02:18:23,280 --> 02:18:24,560
Hollywood ice cream place was.

2873
02:18:24,560 --> 02:18:25,200
I already forgot.

2874
02:18:25,840 --> 02:18:26,640
Cool planet.

2875
02:18:26,640 --> 02:18:30,400
Like there'd be like a I mean, there'd be like a Joe Rogan burger and like.

2876
02:18:31,360 --> 02:18:32,640
Yeah, but but.

2877
02:18:32,640 --> 02:18:34,000
Dak Shepard's fries.

2878
02:18:34,800 --> 02:18:35,680
They would all be there.

2879
02:18:35,680 --> 02:18:39,360
But if we want to stay within the like, you know, stay with how Robert likes to do it,

2880
02:18:39,360 --> 02:18:41,680
the hamburger would just be called hamburger.

2881
02:18:44,240 --> 02:18:47,040
And it would be just the grilled cheese.

2882
02:18:47,040 --> 02:18:50,560
It would be and then you would see Dax would at least be on the red carpet once.

2883
02:18:51,440 --> 02:18:53,120
But the cocktails would all be themed.

2884
02:18:53,120 --> 02:18:53,440
Though.

2885
02:18:53,440 --> 02:18:56,640
Yeah, cocktails would be named after podcasts.

2886
02:18:58,480 --> 02:19:00,080
The spooky mental haunted house.

2887
02:19:00,880 --> 02:19:01,840
Yeah, spooky metal.

2888
02:19:01,840 --> 02:19:04,480
Intrude to Whitney Cummings tweet, defending Joe Rogan,

2889
02:19:04,480 --> 02:19:06,640
a reference that will only make sense this very week.

2890
02:19:06,640 --> 02:19:07,280
Enjoy it.

2891
02:19:07,280 --> 02:19:13,440
You get a sampler, a sampler of different shooter, a sampler of like shots or little tasting,

2892
02:19:13,440 --> 02:19:17,600
like a tasting thing that says like every podcast, all three,

2893
02:19:17,600 --> 02:19:23,120
every podcast has three hosts who look like this, you know, that funny picture that.

2894
02:19:23,120 --> 02:19:24,720
That's very funny.

2895
02:19:24,720 --> 02:19:25,760
So funny.

2896
02:19:25,760 --> 02:19:27,120
Keep sending it, folks.

2897
02:19:27,120 --> 02:19:28,000
Accurate.

2898
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:29,440
We all know who's who.

2899
02:19:29,440 --> 02:19:31,840
It's clear you all have the same answer for it.

2900
02:19:33,280 --> 02:19:39,280
The shot glasses should be little stars like for your to get your five stars that we all need so

2901
02:19:39,280 --> 02:19:40,480
much on it.

2902
02:19:40,480 --> 02:19:43,920
To this is this is the bone marrow of podcasters.

2903
02:19:43,920 --> 02:19:46,000
Give us our stars or we collapse.

2904
02:19:46,800 --> 02:19:51,440
One of you guys has if one of you guys get invited to this opening as podcasters yourselves,

2905
02:19:51,440 --> 02:19:56,160
you have to like one of you has to come with a harmonica or something.

2906
02:19:57,200 --> 02:19:58,080
Oh, yeah.

2907
02:19:58,080 --> 02:20:00,480
Either you're going to say has to wear a big belly shirt.

2908
02:20:02,240 --> 02:20:02,960
And I'll do it.

2909
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:09,600
So I'll wear I'll wear I'll wear fatigues and a belly shirt to the opening.

2910
02:20:09,600 --> 02:20:10,400
That's a guarantee.

2911
02:20:11,280 --> 02:20:17,520
And a weird fuzzy hat and sunglasses and bring a change tiger as your date.

2912
02:20:17,520 --> 02:20:19,200
Podcast restaurant is a legit good.

2913
02:20:19,200 --> 02:20:20,320
I mean, sure.

2914
02:20:20,320 --> 02:20:23,040
Context of this conversation is a legit good idea.

2915
02:20:23,040 --> 02:20:23,680
Yeah, right.

2916
02:20:23,680 --> 02:20:24,560
Is it right now?

2917
02:20:25,440 --> 02:20:26,640
Right now here in this.

2918
02:20:26,960 --> 02:20:32,880
This guy made according to all it'll be a good idea for like five years and crash horribly,

2919
02:20:32,880 --> 02:20:34,640
but you'll get a couple of good years.

2920
02:20:34,640 --> 02:20:35,200
Sure.

2921
02:20:35,200 --> 02:20:40,400
There can be like a Sunday that's just vanilla ice cream, marshmallow fluff and whipped cream.

2922
02:20:40,400 --> 02:20:44,560
And it says a group of white men is called a freaking podcast.

2923
02:20:45,200 --> 02:20:49,280
That's another evergreen joke that no one ever gets sick of hearing.

2924
02:20:49,360 --> 02:20:58,720
Yeah, it's look, I think Robert, because Scott is saying has an addiction to getting restaurants.

2925
02:20:58,720 --> 02:21:03,360
So I think you got to give the addict the fix is what I'm saying.

2926
02:21:03,360 --> 02:21:06,880
So we get in front of him and we go, Robert, do you listen to podcasts?

2927
02:21:06,880 --> 02:21:08,640
And he goes, of course, I do.

2928
02:21:09,440 --> 02:21:09,920
Paul D.

2929
02:21:09,920 --> 02:21:11,040
Can you mean Paul D.

2930
02:21:11,040 --> 02:21:11,520
Cast?

2931
02:21:11,520 --> 02:21:13,520
Yeah, that's what I call them.

2932
02:21:15,520 --> 02:21:18,400
As a normal shape man, you must appreciate podcasts.

2933
02:21:20,080 --> 02:21:25,440
As someone who does not resemble any particular fruit, an unflattering fruit,

2934
02:21:26,560 --> 02:21:28,080
as a normal shaped man.

2935
02:21:28,080 --> 02:21:33,360
I mean, it is shocking that Stallone Schwarzenegger or Willis has not made

2936
02:21:33,360 --> 02:21:36,240
an unlistenable vanity podcast yet.

2937
02:21:36,240 --> 02:21:36,720
Have they?

2938
02:21:36,720 --> 02:21:37,360
Oh, you're right.

2939
02:21:37,360 --> 02:21:38,320
Maybe we just missed it.

2940
02:21:39,200 --> 02:21:39,440
Who?

2941
02:21:39,440 --> 02:21:40,240
That's a good question.

2942
02:21:40,240 --> 02:21:41,200
I don't know.

2943
02:21:41,200 --> 02:21:42,960
I don't think so, but it's possible.

2944
02:21:42,960 --> 02:21:45,200
It feels like that's coming this year.

2945
02:21:45,200 --> 02:21:48,400
Like, I feel like it's been a wave of like, didn't someone really?

2946
02:21:48,480 --> 02:21:50,000
Isn't Tom Hanks doing a podcast?

2947
02:21:50,640 --> 02:21:51,040
Oh, boy.

2948
02:21:51,040 --> 02:21:52,720
He's probably more.

2949
02:21:52,720 --> 02:21:56,160
I'm sure he's more compelling as a podcaster than Schwarzenegger would be.

2950
02:21:57,040 --> 02:21:58,880
But it's the beginning.

2951
02:21:58,880 --> 02:22:00,160
It could be the beginning of a train.

2952
02:22:00,160 --> 02:22:01,600
He's doing a Bandit Brothers podcast.

2953
02:22:02,320 --> 02:22:03,120
Okay.

2954
02:22:03,120 --> 02:22:06,560
So it could be the beginning of a wave of A-list podcasters.

2955
02:22:06,560 --> 02:22:10,800
I mean, I look I would like if all of the Planet Hollywood investors

2956
02:22:10,800 --> 02:22:15,360
all started a podcast network, the Planet Hollywood podcast network.

2957
02:22:15,440 --> 02:22:16,480
What do you call it?

2958
02:22:16,480 --> 02:22:18,320
Is that ho ho or whatever?

2959
02:22:21,200 --> 02:22:21,440
G-How.

2960
02:22:21,440 --> 02:22:22,640
Spendables podcast network.

2961
02:22:22,640 --> 02:22:24,960
On P. Oh, yeah, wait, yeah, yeah.

2962
02:22:24,960 --> 02:22:25,440
Play.

2963
02:22:25,440 --> 02:22:26,080
Wait, what was it?

2964
02:22:26,080 --> 02:22:26,640
Play-ho.

2965
02:22:26,640 --> 02:22:27,200
Play, yeah.

2966
02:22:27,760 --> 02:22:29,440
Play-ho.

2967
02:22:29,440 --> 02:22:30,880
The Play-ho podcast network.

2968
02:22:30,880 --> 02:22:34,800
And every time a new episode drops, there's a lavish opening.

2969
02:22:36,720 --> 02:22:40,160
There's tigers and koalas everywhere that I can see.

2970
02:22:41,680 --> 02:22:42,560
Every episode.

2971
02:22:43,520 --> 02:22:47,680
We need this blockbuster culture to come back.

2972
02:22:47,680 --> 02:22:48,240
We miss it.

2973
02:22:48,240 --> 02:22:50,160
We don't know who's a star anymore.

2974
02:22:50,160 --> 02:22:51,680
I don't know who's popular.

2975
02:22:51,680 --> 02:22:54,000
I've missed Sartorius entirely.

2976
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:58,800
We need to give the ball back to our betters, the 90s celebrities.

2977
02:22:58,800 --> 02:23:02,080
They were the best at movies and the best at blues harmonica.

2978
02:23:03,040 --> 02:23:06,560
If everything's moving to podcasts, then they need to as well.

2979
02:23:07,680 --> 02:23:08,480
I agree.

2980
02:23:08,480 --> 02:23:12,000
I think that we'll send an email to Robert Earl and we'll have plans drawn up.

2981
02:23:12,560 --> 02:23:17,520
For a podcast network and a series of 80 chain restaurants by next week.

2982
02:23:18,800 --> 02:23:24,240
And if we can time it correctly, then we could make it out of this endeavor

2983
02:23:24,800 --> 02:23:32,000
with 20 million dollars each or we all personally lose 20 million dollars.

2984
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:32,720
Quickly.

2985
02:23:32,720 --> 02:23:35,520
Sell the stock quickly is what we have to do.

2986
02:23:35,520 --> 02:23:42,160
Yeah, we'll get the Queen of Versailles guy to help us funnel our money into something.

2987
02:23:42,240 --> 02:23:42,480
Yes.

2988
02:23:43,520 --> 02:23:44,240
To hide it.

2989
02:23:44,240 --> 02:23:47,040
We'll only be paid in credit.

2990
02:23:47,040 --> 02:23:52,560
We can only redeem at the Planet Hollywood Resort in Goa, India.

2991
02:23:52,560 --> 02:23:56,400
Which yeah, they've got deals for monsoon season.

2992
02:23:57,040 --> 02:23:59,120
That's the summer and monsoon season.

2993
02:23:59,120 --> 02:24:00,640
Seems to be their busy times of year.

2994
02:24:01,760 --> 02:24:02,640
Oh wait, so wait.

2995
02:24:02,640 --> 02:24:03,600
Yeah, I wish.

2996
02:24:03,600 --> 02:24:08,000
So if you never canceled the credit card, would it still be a valid credit card, you think?

2997
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:09,440
I think, yeah, I don't.

2998
02:24:09,840 --> 02:24:12,080
I do wonder about that.

2999
02:24:12,080 --> 02:24:16,640
Or would it have just transferred to like, you know, whatever bank was backing it?

3000
02:24:16,640 --> 02:24:20,960
Would it have just been like, oh, it's a visa, you know, at Wachovia now?

3001
02:24:21,520 --> 02:24:26,000
Yeah, yeah, I would hope if you're not getting the logo on there, that's a loss.

3002
02:24:26,800 --> 02:24:31,840
Yeah, and if you can't get the reward, if you can't convert rewards to merchandise, you know.

3003
02:24:33,520 --> 02:24:34,320
I'd be disappointed.

3004
02:24:34,320 --> 02:24:36,320
All your bucks go to like All Star Grill, whatever.

3005
02:24:37,120 --> 02:24:39,280
Is All Star Grill, did any of those survive?

3006
02:24:39,280 --> 02:24:43,520
Like, can I go to like one random one that's still, you know, like there's still one

3007
02:24:43,520 --> 02:24:44,800
blockbuster that exists.

3008
02:24:44,800 --> 02:24:46,640
Like, is there still one All Star Grill or whatever?

3009
02:24:46,640 --> 02:24:51,840
Is there still a Planet Movies, the combination project with AMC Theaters?

3010
02:24:51,840 --> 02:24:53,760
Oh yes, in Columbus, Ohio.

3011
02:24:53,760 --> 02:24:56,640
If any listeners are from there, that looks unbelievable.

3012
02:24:56,640 --> 02:25:01,200
They did a big, it was like, this was a massive complex that was a Planet Hollywood restaurant

3013
02:25:01,200 --> 02:25:07,600
and Planet Movies by AMC of 30 screen movie theater and the All Star Sports Cafe.

3014
02:25:07,600 --> 02:25:13,120
There was all of this together next to each other in Columbus, Ohio that was opened up by

3015
02:25:13,920 --> 02:25:17,840
Kelsey Grammer and Shaq, all holding up big movie tickets.

3016
02:25:18,800 --> 02:25:22,160
This is where you can come to see the next Kelsey Grammer flick.

3017
02:25:23,760 --> 02:25:29,280
That's a real Wach, Wach Wolf, the one you feed, Wach Wolf comes out of you.

3018
02:25:29,280 --> 02:25:31,280
Everyone is a Kelsey Grammer to Shaq.

3019
02:25:33,760 --> 02:25:38,240
Grammer app announced the intro, but immediately fell off the stage and broke his ankle.

3020
02:25:38,240 --> 02:25:42,080
Oh no, Kelsey, stop doing these events.

3021
02:25:42,720 --> 02:25:43,280
Exactly.

3022
02:25:43,280 --> 02:25:45,040
And Gam, come on.

3023
02:25:45,040 --> 02:25:47,280
Scan the stage before you walk on it.

3024
02:25:48,560 --> 02:25:49,760
Pat, it's been so fun to have you.

3025
02:25:49,760 --> 02:25:51,360
Any closing thoughts?

3026
02:25:51,360 --> 02:25:56,960
Have you, has this invigorated you or you like, do we all need to go bang down the doors

3027
02:25:56,960 --> 02:26:00,560
of the Times Square restaurant and get in there again and party?

3028
02:26:01,440 --> 02:26:04,480
If it's genuinely closed forever, I would be sad.

3029
02:26:04,480 --> 02:26:10,480
I actually did like it because like I said before, it's just like, I mean, the food,

3030
02:26:10,480 --> 02:26:11,040
I don't really care.

3031
02:26:11,040 --> 02:26:16,400
The food, it's not good, but almost none of the food in Times Square is good.

3032
02:26:16,400 --> 02:26:21,280
So it's really just about what you're looking at around the food.

3033
02:26:23,200 --> 02:26:26,560
And yeah, I mean, it was such a, I would happily bang down the door because I just

3034
02:26:26,560 --> 02:26:33,440
feel like it is such a, it's just, it's, you know, I'm sad that it's, it failed so

3035
02:26:33,440 --> 02:26:39,840
spectacularly, but I'm glad that it did at the exact moment it did because it frozen

3036
02:26:39,840 --> 02:26:44,720
in time in this like late nineties thing, which is just so much of my heart is that

3037
02:26:45,520 --> 02:26:50,880
like it accidentally is a museum to be my favorite time in movie history.

3038
02:26:50,880 --> 02:26:51,120
Yeah.

3039
02:26:51,840 --> 02:26:52,240
Yeah.

3040
02:26:52,240 --> 02:26:56,160
Like they didn't think it was going to be a tribute to that and only that,

3041
02:26:56,160 --> 02:27:02,080
but that's how it ended up and like, Hey, it's yeah, it's when Hollywood was still on top

3042
02:27:02,080 --> 02:27:06,880
and things were expensive and crazy and loud and yeah.

3043
02:27:06,880 --> 02:27:07,440
And you know what?

3044
02:27:07,440 --> 02:27:08,960
There's just enough of it left.

3045
02:27:08,960 --> 02:27:09,680
That's what I like.

3046
02:27:09,680 --> 02:27:13,120
Like, unlike some, a lot of these places we're going to talk about this month are gone and

3047
02:27:13,120 --> 02:27:16,560
completely all star cafe to answer your question is gone completely.

3048
02:27:16,560 --> 02:27:21,360
But that one, I mean, as long as one or two of them, hold on, it's a bummer if,

3049
02:27:21,360 --> 02:27:24,720
if Times Square is gone, but we're, we're rooting for you Times Square.

3050
02:27:24,720 --> 02:27:25,280
Yeah.

3051
02:27:25,760 --> 02:27:30,720
If I, if I, if I see it open, when I walk by there, I will, I will go in and give you

3052
02:27:30,720 --> 02:27:32,080
send you guys a photo or something.

3053
02:27:32,080 --> 02:27:32,480
Please.

3054
02:27:32,480 --> 02:27:32,960
Please do.

3055
02:27:32,960 --> 02:27:33,360
Yeah.

3056
02:27:34,080 --> 02:27:38,160
Well, just tell it like a book plane tickets for us and we'll pay you back.

3057
02:27:38,160 --> 02:27:38,560
Okay.

3065
02:27:52,080 --> 02:27:52,560
Oh yeah.

3066
02:27:52,560 --> 02:27:53,440
So, so much fun.

3067
02:27:54,080 --> 02:27:55,680
Let's exit through the gift shop.

3068
02:27:55,680 --> 02:27:56,960
Is there anything you'd like to plug?

3069
02:27:58,320 --> 02:27:58,640
Sure.

3070
02:27:59,520 --> 02:28:05,040
Full front old Samantha Bee is at this as, as of this season, we're on Thursday nights

3071
02:28:05,040 --> 02:28:05,920
now at 10 PM.

3072
02:28:06,480 --> 02:28:06,800
All right.

3073
02:28:06,800 --> 02:28:08,160
So tune on TBS.

3074
02:28:08,160 --> 02:28:08,960
So tune in there.

3075
02:28:09,680 --> 02:28:12,000
I think you ever been involved.

3076
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:15,200
How about, oh, here's a question on that show or college humor.

3077
02:28:15,200 --> 02:28:19,680
Is there any, is there like a, is there a prop or something that you would be proud to

3078
02:28:19,680 --> 02:28:20,800
donate to a plant?

3079
02:28:20,800 --> 02:28:25,600
If you had to represent some of your work in such a facility.

3080
02:28:26,320 --> 02:28:30,000
I, I don't know.

3081
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:35,120
I mean, weirdly I, I, the college humor, I visited the New York office kind of

3082
02:28:35,120 --> 02:28:38,800
before they kind of, they let go of, unfortunately had to let go of a lot of

3083
02:28:38,800 --> 02:28:42,400
people within the last couple of years, but I visited the New York office and

3084
02:28:43,120 --> 02:28:46,640
they had like a lot of the old props that from my time, I felt, I felt like

3085
02:28:46,640 --> 02:28:50,640
Methuselah coming in there and being like, oh, like, like those are like the old

3086
02:28:50,640 --> 02:28:51,120
dorm room.

3087
02:28:51,120 --> 02:28:56,080
And I graduated 10 years ago or whatever, but I was shocked to, I couldn't believe

3088
02:28:56,080 --> 02:29:00,640
that a room that like a lot of the old weird props, like we had a TV show on MTV,

3089
02:29:00,640 --> 02:29:05,440
like for like a week back in the early, in the late 2000s.

3090
02:29:05,440 --> 02:29:07,280
Oh, a Viacom television show.

3091
02:29:07,280 --> 02:29:09,680
That should be readily available still to this day.

3092
02:29:09,680 --> 02:29:10,720
Yeah.

3093
02:29:10,720 --> 02:29:11,360
Can I do, okay.

3094
02:29:11,360 --> 02:29:14,240
So we got the podcast restaurant and we got the influencer restaurant.

3095
02:29:15,120 --> 02:29:18,800
Third restaurant is like different, like, and I think you could probably donate

3096
02:29:18,800 --> 02:29:25,840
some stuff here too, is like late aughts, early 2010s internet comedy restaurant.

3097
02:29:25,840 --> 02:29:27,520
The Kings of dot comedy era.

3098
02:29:27,520 --> 02:29:28,000
Of course.

3099
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:28,320
Exactly.

3100
02:29:28,320 --> 02:29:28,560
Yeah.

3101
02:29:29,200 --> 02:29:31,360
Some super deluxe, some super deluxe merch.

3102
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:32,400
Oh yeah.

3103
02:29:32,400 --> 02:29:32,880
Yeah.

3104
02:29:32,880 --> 02:29:33,120
Yeah.

3105
02:29:33,920 --> 02:29:39,680
Now we'll correct, well, you know, I'll call my friends at Funny or Die and go get the,

3106
02:29:39,680 --> 02:29:44,160
the forehead to Taze, Marion Cotillard's forehead to Taze.

3107
02:29:44,160 --> 02:29:44,560
The landlord.

3108
02:29:47,840 --> 02:29:48,960
The baby from the landlord.

3109
02:29:50,640 --> 02:29:51,680
That's the physical baby.

3110
02:29:51,680 --> 02:29:51,920
Yeah.

3111
02:29:51,920 --> 02:29:52,240
Yeah.

3112
02:29:52,240 --> 02:29:52,640
Yeah.

3113
02:29:52,640 --> 02:29:53,040
Yeah.

3114
02:29:54,080 --> 02:29:55,120
McKay will send her over.

3115
02:29:56,320 --> 02:29:56,640
Yeah.

3116
02:29:56,640 --> 02:29:57,200
Well, all right.

3117
02:29:57,200 --> 02:30:00,320
We'll start that to the Kings of dot comedy, the restaurant.

3118
02:30:00,320 --> 02:30:02,800
Wait, did I cut off your, your, your, your pluggery though?

3119
02:30:03,440 --> 02:30:04,880

That's it.

3124
02:30:13,680 --> 02:30:14,320
Fantastic.

3125
02:30:14,320 --> 02:30:14,640

Yeah.

3127
02:30:15,200 --> 02:30:17,280
And of course all these future restaurants at some point.

3128
02:30:17,280 --> 02:30:17,760
Of course.

3129
02:30:17,760 --> 02:30:18,080
Yeah.

3130
02:30:18,080 --> 02:30:20,960
You know, we are pre plugging these things once they're up and running and,

3131
02:30:20,960 --> 02:30:22,320
and failing in seven years.

3132
02:30:23,680 --> 02:30:27,680
As for us, we'll put up a lot of these pictures and videos and garbage.

3133
02:30:27,680 --> 02:30:30,960

3140
02:31:04,240 --> 02:31:07,680
that I care about as much as the, the, the, what was it?

3141

The deal them up.

3142
02:31:13,520 --> 02:31:17,120
I just want to be on a big one of those, like in a spinach and artichoke dip.

02:31:17,120 --> 02:31:17,680
And that's it.

3144
02:31:17,680 --> 02:31:18,800
I'm going to dream about tonight.

3145
02:31:19,760 --> 02:31:23,680
I'd like to keep it as is now plus it up or demolish it.
