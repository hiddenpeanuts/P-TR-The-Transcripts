1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Forever!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Dog!

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Haunt Cast the Fright!

4
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Welcome to Haunt Cast the Fright, where for the next 90 minutes to two hours all evil references are legal.

5
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
References like Doll-Faced Spectroman and Brian Setzer.

6
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
My name is Frightful Narlson, joining me as always, Scottlejuice.

7
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The fastest way to get me out of here.

8
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
If there could be literal monsters hiding in the room waiting to pounce, that'd be more acceptable to me than Brian Setzer talk.

9
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Yeah, of course. Joining also is a guy who I keep forgetting his Halloween name. I know it's Slash and Drain is the last part of it.

10
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Oh, it's Jagged Slash and Drain.

11
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Jagged Slash and Drain, that's right. We may have to change the first part of that.

12
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Okay, I don't know. I'm open to it.

13
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Also, it's on the host to introduce themselves if they make their names something so clunky.

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
That's true. That's a very good point.

15
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I just gotta point at him.

16
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'll point at him next time if I do the intro. But no, you're right. It's my problem, not yours. For now at least.

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You know, if we're talking Setzer, it's a good thing.

18
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
We're not, by the way. But go ahead.

19
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm just a little boogie-woogie bugle boy from Company B.

20
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Is that a song they did or do you just like to bring up boogie-woogie bugle boy? I don't think they did that.

21
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I feel like he did.

22
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
You don't think they covered the Brian Setzer Orchestra?

23
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Look, it seems extremely possible, but I just don't.

24
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I don't know for a fact they did, but it seems right.

25
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I just think that's a separate thing Jason loves to say.

26
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
That he's a little boogie-woogie bugle boy? Yeah, I think he does like to say that.

27
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
There's been multiple boogie-woogie bugle boys.

28
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Well, it's true, though. He is a little boogie-woogie bugle boy.

29
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
That's just a fact. Let's bring our guests real quick because I think they would like to talk about this specific topic.

30
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Not the actual topic we have today, but they've been on the show. These are friends of the show, good friends of the show.

31
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,000
They're now together on the podcast. Justin, Michael, Marissa Strickland, they're here. Welcome back.

32
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Thank you.

33
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Can I be monstrous as Shreekland, please?

34
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Oh yeah, perfect.

35
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Let me write these down.

36
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Shreesa is very fancy.

37
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It's a family name.

38
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
They changed it to LLS Island.

39
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I know. It used to be much weirder.

40
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Skeleton Island. It's a giant skeleton.

41
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Oh yeah.

42
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
That's right through it. That's a scary entrance to Ascarica.

43
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Oh, we're off to the races.

44
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I don't know. Justin, Michael, Myers.

45
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Very good. Very nice.

46
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I don't like leaning into an IP version, but you know.

47
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
It's the same thing.

48
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I do want to pitch for this month, boogie-woogie boogle boy.

49
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Oh yeah. That's good, too.

50
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Boogie-woogie.

51
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Oh wow.

52
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It makes it real easy.

53
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
It gets better and better.

54
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Oogie-woogie bashle boy.

55
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
These are all good for next year even, too, if we want to do Jason.

56
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
This is going to keep Jason in names for years.

57
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Sure. And hey, still looking on at the Brian Setzer Orchestra did that song.

58
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
But they did do a Christmas album called Boogie-woogie Christmas.

59
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
So we've got that to look forward to coming up.

60
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
In what way?

61
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
In that it'll be playing out in the world?

62
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Because it certainly was not that we're going to talk about it further on the show.

63
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I'll slam that door down right now.

64
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Hold on a second. What songs do they do?

65
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Well, let me do a little more research.

66
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
All right. Yeah, you get back to us about that.

67
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Or let's see if the conversation takes us away from Brian Setzer entirely,

68
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
which I think that it might because you guys are here to celebrate the Halloween season.

69
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
You all went to Halloween Horror Nights together.

70
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Yes. So what happens is we get some nice comps.

71
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I'll admit it. We get some comps from some places that are not Disney.

72
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
And this year, since my co-hosts generally don't go with me,

73
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I get to invite different friends to go.

74
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
And this year, the roulette wheel landed on U2, which was a delight.

75
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
So you do have a big wheel.

76
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Yes. The friend wheel, I call it.

77
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
It's how I if I have a funny little joke to text to someone,

78
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I spin the wheel and see who's getting this take on all the latest current events.

79
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Brian Setzer.

80
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I have a Brian Setzer joke.

81
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Yeah. So so we went to Halloween Horror Nights,

82
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,000
which is this is something that you're both fans of in general, the haunt, the scary stuff.

83
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
More so than me, I actually like longer. You've been a longer time haunt fan.

84
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I'm very new to it relatively.

85
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It looks great on you.

86
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Well, thank you. I appreciate that.

87
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I didn't I don't want to be a poser at these events because I you know,

88
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I declared that I loved haunts a few years ago,

89
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
but I do feel like sometimes people are like, do you do you really?

90
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Really? You feel that wave of pushback or?

91
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Well, not really a pushback.

92
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
You know, you have a little paranoia that somebody thinks that I'm not maybe I'm not legit.

93
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Maybe I'm not a legit fan.

94
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Well, you went so far with it also, like some people might who who do love it still might say out loud.

95
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I like going to haunts. You came out so strong with all the way from hating scared to loving.

96
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Right. So maybe that's maybe you're a little nervous about owning that full time.

97
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Yeah, I am. Yes. Because, yeah, again, you two are legit.

98
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I've been in a long time.

99
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I, you know, in my mid to late 30s is when I've developed this.

100
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I only got into them like maybe early 30s.

101
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Like I was scared. I felt it was when we started dating and we went to the Haunted Hayride

102
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
and we just went on the hayride here in Los Angeles.

103
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
And then on the way out, there's a maze.

104
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
And Marissa was like, I want to go on that.

105
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
And I was like, oh, you so you had to be like a brave, brave guy.

106
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Driving it like pulling a cartoon goat, you know, like push back, go on.

107
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
No, I don't. You know what I hecho a lot of resistance.

108
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Oh, yeah. And then you were like, well, I'm going to go on alone.

109
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You can just wait here at the end. I was like, no, no, no, no, no.

110
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Yeah, yeah. And was scared.

111
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
And then and then Marissa like probably insulted you a lot.

112
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Like, what are you chicken? What are you scared?

113
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Yeah. What are you little chicken?

114
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Oh, fuck, fuck, fucking get in this dark maze.

115
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
And she was dressed as Biff for no reason.

116
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Yeah, I fell in a pile of shit.

117
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You guys are washed to this day.

118
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
You got your come up and Justin also got his love of haunts.

119
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Yes, truly over the years. So I'm just saying you're on the path.

120
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
OK, thank you. Thank you for letting me know that.

121
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I love it. How scary is that thing?

122
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
The the Haunted Hayride. That's it's a local thing.

123
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I'd say it's a zero on a scale of one to ten.

124
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
OK, OK. Oh, wait, there's the ride and then there's mazes next.

125
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
OK, so the ride is like a family friendly.

126
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I'd give it a three. I'd give it a three.

127
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I think if you are if you're not into haunts, you're still going to have like people running out at you

128
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
and like dragging metal things across the metal part of the wagon and like making loud noises.

129
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
That is scary. Yeah, there are some noises that catch you off guard, I guess.

130
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Right. Marissa, I believe many years ago, I think you've done like more extreme haunts.

131
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
You've had a bag placed on your head and a waiver has been signed.

132
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Yeah, which sounds a little too intense for me even.

133
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
But how could you describe what this was at the time?

134
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Yeah, this was also pretty early on in Justin and my relationship.

135
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Oh, did he do it? Yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah.

136
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
So we went to Rob Zombie. Justin got nagged into loving haunts.

137
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Yeah, please help me.

138
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Lisa Lampanelli is the queen of me and Marissa is the queen of nagging.

139
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
And it rhymes.

140
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Well, you're not the queen of rhyming.

141
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
You're the queen of nagging.

142
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
OK. Yeah, no.

143
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
So we went to Rob Zombie's American Scream, which used to be at the Pomona Fairplex.

144
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
One year, one year at the Pomona Fairplex.

145
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Then I think it kind of toured, but I don't know where it is now.

146
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I hope it's still active somewhere in America, possibly.

147
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
But at that event, and I don't know when that was, maybe like 2015, something like that.

148
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I think earlier. OK, it was a while ago.

149
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
But there were several mazes, one kind of like traditional,

150
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
like House of a Thousand Corpses kind of traditional maze.

151
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:18,000
And then there was one blackout maze where you had to wear a little burlap sack on your head.

152
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
And they just kind of pushed you into a maze.

153
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
So you're just using your hands to feel around, which is really cool.

154
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:32,000
And then there was a maze, so you're just using your hands to feel around, which is truly very exciting to me.

155
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
But there were light electric shocks in that one, too.

156
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I feel like we got tricked into doing more extreme mazes, because I don't think like either of us would be like, we want the pain maze.

157
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Well, except that like a couple of years later, we did opt into a нужно maze.

158
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
The 17th door. It's too extreme.

159
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
You get electrocuted left and right.

160
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
There's a pig fetus on her head and they chased her around.

161
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Yes, truly. And they like birthed a pig fetus out of a woman like you follow the story of this, you know, woman in college who ends up getting pregnant.

162
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
And then she has a pig fetus and they rub it on you.

163
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Is that like a morality play about like the dangers of premarital sex?

164
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I do think that there is an element of that.

165
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Yeah, it's definitely not a fun story that you're walking through.

166
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
It's not a blessed delivery, a happy delivery.

167
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:27,000
But we got tricked into these three mazes at Rob Zombie's because you have to go in back to back to back.

168
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
So like once you go in one, you have to go through all three.

169
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
And so we were like, oh, we're going to go into this normal looking maze.

170
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
And then the second one is like, OK, put this burlap sack on your head.

171
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
You're going to be stuck in this labyrinth with a burlap sack and electric shocks.

172
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:47,000
And because you can't see, you get stuck a lot because you're just like, how does this maze work?

173
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
And there was one kind of, I guess, you know, guard inside the maze.

174
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
And we were like feeling our way against a wall.

175
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
And he was like, you're in a corner.

176
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
That sounded in a monster voice.

177
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
It was like, you're in a corner.

178
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
But like we were trying so hard and it was like humiliating.

179
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Yikes, yikes.

180
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:15,000
But that's like I'm scared enough of you know, what was never I never felt great about were any of those void things where you are.

181
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
You're essentially you're not blindfolded.

182
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I mean, it's the most high tech blindfold there is because it puts you into a digital environment.

183
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
But even that I don't trust it at all.

184
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I am walking so hesitantly and scared.

185
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
So doing complete darkness.

186
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
This is misery to me.

187
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
My God.

188
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
So so the electric shock, would you do that one again?

189
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
The one?

190
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
No, that was the 17th door.

191
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
No, they said the mad shocks, but the 17th door had more.

192
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
The better the more.

193
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Yeah.

194
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,000
In the 17th door and I'm assuming they've changed their thing because I got an email and they're like, come back.

195
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
And I was like, I'm never coming back.

196
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
But like you had to hold hands with your party, right?

197
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:58,000
If you went in with like seven people, you had to hold hands with your party and then flip one of those like electrocutioner.

198
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
You know, things and then electricity like went through all of our hands.

199
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Through our like daisy chains.

200
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Like they were like, it's like so basically 17th door is like there are 17 rooms, I think.

201
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,000
So basically you have a chance to opt out after each room if you're too scared.

202
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
There's like a safe word.

203
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:23,000
But if you get to the end, you get to see the whole horrible problematic story that they've set out and made you pay money for.

204
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Is the fetus at the end?

205
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
The fetus was at the end.

206
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
But every year it's kind of different.

207
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:35,000
The coolest room was there was like an evil Ronald McDonald and they you sit on a bench and it's like a very small room and they pump suddenly like from the ceiling.

208
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
A bunch of ball pit balls started to fill up and they filled up past our heads.

209
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Whoa.

210
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
And then at the last minute they had this like big vacuum suck it all out.

211
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
And I was like, oh, that one was kind of fun.

212
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I mean, I'm claustrophobic.

213
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
So neither am I.

214
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
But I felt claustrophobic in that moment because you're like, wait, wait, wait.

215
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I'm being buried alive.

216
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Like it really did give that sensation.

217
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
But it was fun because it was colorful.

218
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Oh, they were still colorful.

219
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
They didn't make them like not spooky balls.

220
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Yeah.

221
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:15,000
So when you go to horror nights, is it like kind of even like, well, this is like baby stuff in some ways because you've been electrocuted.

222
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I do think that after being electrocuted, after watching a friend's face get shoved in a stinky toilet, after watching them torture animals, they had roaches that they had.

223
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
What?

224
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
It was really it was that was like the most offensive part.

225
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Yeah, I was like, I don't like bugs.

226
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I don't like roaches, but I don't want to see them alive and taped to something.

227
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Yeah. And like held to your face and stuff.

228
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,000
It feels like there's like a weird moral, not a gray area, just bad.

229
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
So I'm black.

230
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Yeah.

231
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Horror nights is kind of so fun.

232
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Maybe Scott and Jason, that's what you need to do.

233
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
You need to do this one first and then everything else is like a piece of cake.

234
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Oh, watch some small animals suffer and then I can go like watch, you know, exorcist 20, the maze.

235
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
That's right.

236
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
It'll feel like a walk in the park.

237
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
It'll feel like just a nice literal walk in a nice park.

238
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Sure.

239
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Getting electrocuted will make it so I don't pee my pants at Chuckie.

240
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,000
That's what you need to do to fix it.

241
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Just a sign of Chuckie is too much for me.

242
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I not to delay the Halloween Horror Nights, but there's something I was looking forward to bringing up with Marissa here, especially.

243
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
You know, you're diving back into into your haunt history.

244
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:40,000
But but also in terms of like, well, I'm not sure when 2000s 2010s history and your guys shared history.

245
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Something came up on the Patreon recently.

246
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
God damn.

247
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
You knew you weren't going to escape.

248
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:52,000
So we did an episode about Shaqtoberfest, the Shaq Long Beach Halloween event.

249
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
And this led to a discussion of the things that Shaq endorses.

250
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
And, you know, I was since I wasn't there.

251
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Maybe I'll just let Mike ask the question of a memory that you might have.

252
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
So OK. So Marissa, I don't know if you remember this.

253
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
We had a get together. We were on an improv team together, Jason, Marissa and I.

254
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:15,000
And there was sort of like a bring your own stuff night where we kind of brought food or something to Marissa's looking like.

255
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Marissa's looking like she's pretty kind of lost. So hopefully.

256
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Oh, right. Keep in mind only Mike is the only person here who remembers everything Jason does.

257
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
That's true. Yeah. That includes Jason.

258
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
This is over 10 years ago, too.

259
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:42,000
So basically, Jason brought this up because I had forgotten about it that Jason brought over basically like my memory is like one can of Shaq soda and a tiny sort of twinkie sized dessert from 7-Eleven.

260
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:53,000
You're saying no, I brought like he says he brought three Shaq sodas and a little soda and a full size like Swiss cake roll like both of you with your hands.

261
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Make the size that you recall.

262
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Jason is saying it's like this like it was like a Fudgy the Whale.

263
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Give me inches if you can.

264
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Um, there's no way it was that big.

265
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Reduce, reduce, reduce.

266
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:12,000
You're showing me about what's that. Is that like 15 more foot and a half? I don't know.

267
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Is it a foot and a half size?

268
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
A foot and a half twinkie?

269
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,000
No, like a traditional. It was like a red velvet Swiss roll.

270
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Traditional. Purchased from where?

271
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
From 7-Eleven when they were doing beets.

272
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Just a traditional home cooked.

273
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:43,000
It was just very clear at the time that everyone had like kind of gone at least to a grocery store and bought like something and then Jason rolled up to the 7-Eleven and found Shaq soda and like when my memory a very smallish kind of dessert maybe a little bigger than a twinkie.

274
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Give me an inch count.

275
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I feel like it was like this big. I feel like it was a small.

276
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Like a single serve.

277
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Yeah, that's like six, seven inches right there.

278
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
A smaller thing. So you have no memory of this specific incident.

279
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
No. Do we know where this occurred?

280
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:03,000
My memory is that it was at that house that multiple people would cat sit for.

281
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Yes, that's where my brain pegged it.

282
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Yeah.

283
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Because there are a couple pictures of us and a little yaddle from that night.

284
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
That's what I remember.

285
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,000
The Star Wars Yoda equivalent, the female Yoda equivalent yaddle.

286
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I believe it was that night that I brought the yaddle figure.

287
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Yeah, Mike was on that yaddle tip.

288
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Oh, your contribution was a yaddle figure.

289
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I brought food of some kind as well, which I don't remember what I brought,

290
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:32,000
but I do remember bringing yaddle and we took many photos of yaddle.

291
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I believe I started making like weed memes with yaddle that night.

292
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
That's cool.

293
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:45,000
So right, exactly. It's easy being green and then it would be like I put like a puff of smoke or something.

294
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
That's pretty dank.

295
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Pretty dank, yeah. So okay, so you don't have a memory of this?

296
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
You can't clear up anything about how many kings.

297
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I can't. I'm so sorry. I wish I had a memory, but I do not remember any.

298
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I feel like I'm on the stand. I do not remember any shack sodas.

299
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I do not remember any smaller, large traditional rolls from 7-Eleven.

300
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,000
All right. And look, that's fine. There's still plenty of people we can ask about this.

301
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Yes.

302
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
And we will.

303
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
There are five more people.

304
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Anyone who may have been there.

305
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
We have five, yeah.

306
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
And we will ask every one of them if we have to.

307
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Who doesn't remember because yaddle's high.

308
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Well, yeah. Yaddle holds the keys.

309
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Yaddle smoked us all up and that's why some people can't remember.

310
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Now, in the interest of not making this all about Jason accusations, I have something to point at Mike,

311
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,000
which is the discussion of this in this episode kept going past the episode.

312
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I filmed this and I was watching the video later and you, as if to like recount a better type of gift you could bring to a potluck type thing, said,

313
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I remember the one party where I brought clowny cones.

314
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Yes.

315
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I remember that clearly.

316
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Okay, sure.

317
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Because that's a memorable thing to bring.

318
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
A good fun dessert.

319
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Now, I have a follow-up question.

320
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Go ahead.

321
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Do you mean from Baskin Robbins?

322
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Yes.

323
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
That's what you're referring to.

324
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Now, okay. Now I have one more follow-up question.

325
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Where in the world are these referred to as clowny cones as opposed to clown cones?

326
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I believe when I was younger, either we started calling them clowny cones and that's how I still say it,

327
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
or they made a name change at some point because you're correct.

328
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
They call them clown cones.

329
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I watched the video of this with Erin and she was like, what the fuck is a clowny cone?

330
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:35,000
They were at a certain point, I don't know if my mom said it or what, but you are right.

331
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I apologize for the off-the-record saying of the name wrong.

332
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I was just curious where it came from because I was like, I don't think it's a regional thing.

333
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I think this is a childhood thing that Mike is holding on to and the fact that it may have come from your mother makes 1000% sense to me as well.

334
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
It's a good question.

335
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I will look into this and see if there was ever any name change because that is how we always refer to them.

336
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I was obsessed with these and if you don't know what we're talking about,

337
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Baskin Robbins would make a little, it would be an upside-down ice cream cone and they would make a little clown face on it.

338
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I was obsessed with it even though that ice cream had been sitting in there longer

339
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
than the fresh ice cream coming from one of the cartons.

340
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Older, more dried-up ice cream.

341
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Hard as a rock, I was saying.

342
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,000
The icing is really slick and almost like an oil.

343
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
It's like, that flavor.

344
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Jason warned us about the cake boss vending machines in Las Vegas about how bad they were.

345
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
You're kidding.

346
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Jason luckily warned us about this because I would have just gotten a ton of them.

347
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I saw this from another video.

348
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I did not sample it.

349
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Same Instagram, probably Vegas accounts that warn you of this type of thing.

350
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:54,000
The cake boss has cake slice vending machines but they're covered in some sort of oil to keep it fresh or make it look good.

351
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I feel like the clown cones are similarly like, it just doesn't taste as fresh as if you put...

352
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Preserved in a way that's not natural.

353
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Yeah, I think so.

354
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Now let me say this, when you said clown cones just now, that was correct.

355
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
But now that I've heard you say it, it made me a little sad.

356
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I think now that I've gone through this, I want you to say clowny cones.

357
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
It felt bad to say it like that.

358
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
So I will go back to calling them clowny cones.

359
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:25,000
In my defense, I feel like this is a I learned it from watching you scenario.

360
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Where he started bringing clowny cones and I was like, oh, wouldn't it be funny if I brought shacks

361
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
and I brought shack soda and...

362
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Oh, we are blaming Michael now.

363
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
No way.

364
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Hang on.

365
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
You're reverting timelines.

366
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
You know what I mean?

367
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Shack happened first.

368
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
No way.

369
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Clowny cones happened second.

370
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Absolutely not.

371
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
We have to have photo records somewhere.

372
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:52,000
No, because Mike brought clowny cones to multiple social events.

373
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
That might be true.

374
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
It was between multiple clowny cone bringing.

375
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
It was likely between.

376
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
And I also owned up that the shack soda tasted like shit.

377
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
None of the flavors were good.

378
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,000
And I would say most people coming to like a hang might bring a six pack of beer.

379
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
You know?

380
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Yeah.

381
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
This is what the discussion was.

382
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Maybe you bring enough for everyone.

383
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
There's eight of us.

384
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I did bring enough for everyone.

385
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Well, because we were all, I was like, oh, we'll sample the shack soda.

386
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
We will all have not a full can.

387
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
You wouldn't bring three beers.

388
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
And say, oh, we'll all sample the beers.

389
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
It's a fierce sampling.

390
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
It's fun.

391
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
For each person.

392
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
It's an activity.

393
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
This was part of the funniness of it.

394
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I don't know.

395
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Eight sodas seemed like overkill.

396
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I mean, it would have been in retrospect knowing that the soda is horrible.

397
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
But this wasn't known at the time.

398
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Yeah.

399
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
So you could have given everyone a chance to experience.

400
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Maybe some people would have like, I disagree.

401
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I will drink the entire thing.

402
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Also, the clown cones, there was four thought it was the seven eleven was like around the corner.

403
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Oh, I forgot.

404
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Yeah, for sure.

405
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Forgot.

406
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
And I was trying to save it.

407
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Do you remember?

408
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I'll save it on a budget.

409
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Yeah.

410
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Do you remember?

411
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Like if, if you can go back in time, 10 plus years, you're walking into seven eleven.

412
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:24,000
You're like, I need a quick gift for my friends to show that we are having a potluck experience.

413
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
And you scan, scan, scan.

414
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
You see Shaq's face and say, maybe.

415
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Like, is that what happened?

416
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I thought the cans looked fun.

417
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
And I've little squist roll.

418
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Can you describe the can?

419
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Just somebody who's never seen a Shaq soda.

420
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,000
They were all different colors and he was really happy on the can.

421
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
He said was.

422
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
I love a sad Shaq on a soda can.

423
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Happy Shaq.

424
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Happy Shaq was on it.

425
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:59,000
I was going to say his face was large for the can, but small for Shaq.

426
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I have photos here.

427
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
There's a, there's a.

428
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
And now what do you, both of you understand?

429
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Do you or do you not think this looks fun?

430
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
This is like a fun, like this, this is crazy.

431
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Should we try this?

432
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Yes.

433
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Right.

434
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
It's like a valid thing to be like, I'm with friends and let's try this in.

435
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Like this looks nuts.

436
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Yeah.

437
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Sure.

438
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Okay.

439
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
There's like a fun.

440
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Wait, did you bring all four flavors?

441
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Cause it appears there are four flavors.

442
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
I don't think they add all four.

443
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Only happy.

444
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
It is funny though.

445
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
You didn't get like four.

446
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
You know what I mean?

447
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Like even just four cans.

448
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Cause then you go, oh, well each have half of it.

449
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Oh, each have half.

450
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Yeah.

451
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
You have tall cans.

452
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
I think my little arms were full.

453
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I know.

454
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Wait a minute.

455
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
I'm, you're showing me your arms.

456
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
You have room for more than three cans.

457
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
You're a smaller person.

458
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
You're shorter than us, but you're not four feet tall.

459
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Don't do your tiny Tim Kwan.

460
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
I was too tired.

461
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
The cans sir.

462
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Wait, wait, wait.

463
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Look at that.

464
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
That's what I'm talking about.

465
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
I was too tired.

466
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
The cans sir.

467
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
They were going to tip me over.

468
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,000
How will I scratch off my lottery ticket if I have all these cans?

469
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
You did do a lottery.

470
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
You should have bought us each a lottery ticket.

471
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Yeah.

472
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
That would have been funny.

473
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Eight scratchers?

474
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Eight scratchers?

475
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
That's an activity.

476
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
That's a better idea.

477
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Well next time we're all on a Harold team together.

478
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Yeah.

479
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
We got to get back in classes.

480
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
It's on the rise baby.

481
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
That's the place to be.

482
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
I'm looking to drop another 1500.

483
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
I'd love to be taught by a 26 year old.

484
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Well look, I can't pass up an opportunity to relitigate something from many years ago.

485
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
And we're not done with this.

486
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
No, no, no.

487
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
I don't believe so.

488
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
There'll be more questions.

489
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
It's like a wrestling feud.

490
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
This isn't over.

491
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
This isn't over.

492
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
There's a pay-per-view in two weeks.

493
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
This is our Rashomon.

494
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Okay, that being said, now we can actually, let's get spooky.

495
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Cold chill just came through the room.

496
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:16,000
So we're going to, I guess we'll try to focus on this crazy new show they have.

497
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Oh yes, in all this time we've not said that, I mean it's, it'll be, we'll have been in the intro,

498
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:26,000
but this, and we'll talk about other Halloween Horror Nights stuff, but this is the,

499
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
the focus here is the Purge Dangerous Waters,

500
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:36,000
a nighttime experience that takes place on the Waterworld stunt show set.

501
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Live Sea War Spectacular set.

502
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
I'm sorry, I misspoke.

503
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Yeah, thank you.

504
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Yeah, so that's basically, that was the most fun I had the whole night I think.

505
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
That was my favorite thing.

506
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
But we did all of Horror Nights.

507
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,000
We should talk about, you know, highlights and stuff we liked in general.

508
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:56,000
I will say we first got some of the themed drinks, which we should point out.

509
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
The ones with like an eyeball in it?

510
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Yeah, or, or, you know, a glass that was rimmed with sprinkles and frosting.

511
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
I mean, very clowny cone.

512
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Yes.

513
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
An alcoholic clowny cone.

514
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
With a bit of an alcohol, show you a photo.

515
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Now which of you three ordered that one?

516
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
This is a low res, but that's in the middle there, I got it.

517
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
This was a light up ice cube.

518
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Light up ice cube.

519
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
It was the fun choice.

520
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,000
And I was just, I was tonguing the glass again.

521
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
I think it was the least fun name.

522
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
What was the name?

523
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Well, it was, it was Peacock themed.

524
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
The Peacock tail.

525
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
The streaming platform?

526
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:40,000
So right, there was like, yeah, Purge Punch and that's like, that's a fun name, but then this was the Peacock tail.

527
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,000
For the synergy of Peacock, the streaming service.

528
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
So I got it.

529
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Not a Palti Gold-tini.

530
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,000
You should have been, there should have been a scare actor playing him and not David S. Pumpkins.

531
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
You could have taken a picture with him.

532
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Can I talk to you for three straight hours?

533
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
It would have maybe just been him.

534
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
One room.

535
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
It's literally him.

536
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
But what did, I forgot, what you two ordered.

537
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
We got Modellos.

538
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Yeah.

539
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
You drank like adults.

540
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
But Mike made the right choice, like he did the fun choice.

541
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
He did the fun choice.

542
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
You don't have to defend me, I'm fine.

543
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
I ordered my favorite streaming service, it's a cocktail.

544
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:29,000
So yeah, we got, we got that right under the wire as far as getting into, because then I think there was an eureka moment where we could get one of these and we could go and sit and watch the show.

545
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Yes, they allow you to drink and watch the nighttime spectacular.

546
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
That's good.

547
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Wow. So is this top of the night? Is this first thing you're doing?

548
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
First thing.

549
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
First thing we did.

550
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Wow, wow. Was it downhill from there? Does that start at so strong?

551
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
I mean technically because it was on the upper part of Universal.

552
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Yeah, it was on the up and down hill.

553
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
It was all downhill for you.

554
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
And then it was back uphill.

555
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
And then it was out the parking lot.

556
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
And then it was home.

557
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
We ended with Chucky though, which I think was one of the highlights.

558
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Yeah, I love Chucky.

559
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
What does Chucky do this year?

560
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
What is Chucky not doing this year, right?

561
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
There's a million Chucky's in that maze.

562
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Yeah, so this is based on the show, right?

563
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
This is based on the new show.

564
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,000
I've only seen the first two Child's Playz and I've not seen the show.

565
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
So you were probably catching all the references.

566
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
On Peacock or Syfy?

567
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Peacock, yeah. The Peacocktail streaming service.

568
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Very good. They also offer a streaming service. They aren't just cocktails.

569
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,000
I would say the outside of the Chucky maze looked like Child's Play 2.

570
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
So there's a big toy factory, the big set piece.

571
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Or not even, I don't know. It's just a bunch of dolls and boxes.

572
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
It was beautiful.

573
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,000
I think visually I thought that was the most exciting exterior of the maze.

574
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:44,000
There were so many. I think it leaned into the lore of Chucky.

575
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:50,000
We caught up on all the Chucky movies in a row in the last year and a half.

576
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:57,000
So we could watch the Chucky TV series, which feels like the Avengers of Chucky lore.

577
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
And then we dropped off after three episodes.

578
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Not because we didn't like it. There's just many things to do in the world.

579
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
A lot of things to do. Amen.

580
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
It's like he's president now in the third season or something.

581
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
I know. I really want to get to it.

582
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Wow, the Yellowstone arc.

583
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Is that what happens?

584
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:21,000
I think the first season he's the largest land farm owner in Montana.

585
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
And by the fourth or fifth season he's the governor.

586
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
I love that's how it heightened a political office. Yes.

587
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Yeah.

588
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
You got it when you do a show, when you get bored.

589
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:37,000
And the maze is great. There's so many animatronics.

590
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
A lot of animatronics.

591
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Really. And there's tons of Chucky's.

592
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
I don't even think there was a human performer in any of them.

593
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:48,000
I don't think so. I think it was all puppets or animatronics.

594
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Yeah. And I was wondering.

595
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
I think in the old House of Horrors, I think I've told this story before,

596
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:57,000
which was my pre-haunt days, my friend forced me to do it and I was freaked out the whole time.

597
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:02,000
And I believe there was like a Chucky performer that pretended that they were a robot.

598
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:07,000
And then it kind of came to life and pulled like a knife on my friend's throat.

599
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
And I got freaked out.

600
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:14,000
We actually had a, when we went to Spain, we went to a little theme park called Tibidabo.

601
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
And it's like at the top of a mountain. It's really beautiful.

602
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Like overlooks Barcelona. Yeah.

603
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Yeah. And then there was a year round haunt there and it was all just like IP.

604
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Famous movie monsters.

605
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:34,000
All done really well. And in the middle of that maze, there was a Chucky room and there was a little Chucky just sitting there.

606
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
It was honestly really good production value.

607
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:43,000
And we just were walking by and then they have like a lightning strike effect, you know, and like the room flashes.

608
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
And he came to life. He was like, Sorpresa!

609
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
It was great.

610
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
And we say Sorpresa.

611
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Spanish Chucky. That's amazing. Yeah.

612
00:31:53,000 --> 00:32:01,000
And this one, there's, I guess the finale room is the one where there's many Chucky's, but then also there's a giant Chucky.

613
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Oh, yeah. I didn't understand if that was a reference since I haven't seen more than three episodes of the TV show.

614
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Maybe there's a giant Chucky in the TV show.

615
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Maybe it's just like the giant snake in the Indiana Jones ride. It's kind of like a manifestation of your mere.

616
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
It's more than a literal.

617
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
And it was there. That giant Chucky is like as tall as the ceiling, probably.

618
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,000
So it's like 12, 14 feet or something like that.

619
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,000
This is are you guys Scott and Jason scared of Chucky?

620
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
I definitely had that as a kid. I was big. Yeah, for sure.

621
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Even the mirror. I was saying it earlier.

622
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:39,000
It was definitely true as a kid that the mere sight of him was a lot.

623
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,000
And I caught too much of the is it part three, the military school one?

624
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Actually, that's the only one we haven't seen. But yeah. Oh, really? OK. OK.

625
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Skip that. That's that's all I've seen some of.

626
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,000
And it scares me that somebody gets ground up in a trash compactor or something.

627
00:32:53,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Didn't like that. But the idea of it like this triggers my recurring fear, which is something that's supposed to be small being big and indoors.

628
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,000
I think I would really. Oh, yeah. That's exactly it. Yeah.

629
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Yeah. Yeah. Scott, let me ask you, did you have a my buddy doll? No, no.

630
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Anyone have a my buddy? I did. You did. You both did. OK.

631
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:23,000
I had one, too. And I think like I learned about Chucky and it's like, oh, it's like an evil my buddy doll.

632
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:28,000
And I did not inquire any further. I begged for a my buddy doll.

633
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,000
I my mom and dad got me a my buddy doll.

634
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:40,000
And then I was terrified of this doll once my dad offhandedly called it Chucky.

635
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:46,000
He was like, oh, Chucky. And then he got put he got relegated to a closet.

636
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:51,000
And then when my sister, my sister just kept it and like drew on its face and it only made it scary.

637
00:33:51,000 --> 00:34:00,000
OK. This all is like the origin story for a Chucky being neglected, drawn on, forgotten, abused.

638
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
It's probably still out there. Oh, fuck.

639
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,000
I'm wandering the streets with crayon on it.

640
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
It's only got one thing on its mind. Revenge.

641
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Revenge. Any moment he's like behind the curtain here.

642
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:24,000
So, yeah, that one felt like that felt like a good finale for us for the night, because I think that I think that was my favorite.

643
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Or I guess the other one was the monster. Yes. Yes.

644
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
The Latin American Monsters Man. Yeah.

645
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,000
That one had some crazy like animatronic.

646
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,000
There's this really cool bird lady monster.

647
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
You know, I don't know the folklore behind it.

648
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,000
I should have looked it up before this, but she was awesome.

649
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Like she was like a really freaky bird.

650
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Yeah. And like big yellow feathers lived on a place called Sesame Street.

651
00:34:53,000 --> 00:35:00,000
No, she was like, you know what I mean, like molded and nasty and gray and like sour faced.

652
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Yeah. But it was such a like we were so close to it.

653
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:09,000
I'm always impressed that these things don't get taken apart by people there because it feels like so easy.

654
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
I could just rip the head off of this.

655
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:16,000
I don't do it because I'm afraid of the like metaphysical repercussions.

656
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
But the literal band from the park or that.

657
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Yes, because that would be I want to go on that Fast and Furious coaster in a couple of years.

658
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
But yeah, that one like really impressed me a lot.

659
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Those were my faves. Yeah.

660
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
It felt like like a dark mother.

661
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:35,000
You know what I mean? Like the the the vindictive quality a mother could have.

662
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:41,000
You know what I mean? Where like she's like over caring for her children in a nasty way where she's like killing their life force.

663
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:46,000
I love this, but I just want to make this clear.

664
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
It's your patronly symbolically.

665
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
That's what it felt like to me. Yeah.

666
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,000
It was the dark mother maze.

667
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
I'll bring up the photo later. But yeah, no, it was great.

668
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
I just didn't feel that necessarily.

669
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
But I see what you're saying.

670
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
I see where you're headed with a very dark mother.

671
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Very, very dark mother.

672
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Can I back up to Chuckie for a second?

673
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Because Chuckie is represented not just in this maze, but also in culinary form.

674
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Oh, yeah. There is a restaurant called Chuckie's Killer Barbecue.

675
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Should have eaten. We should have gotten.

676
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
We walked right by it. No rush to get to the first show.

677
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Yeah, sure, sure.

678
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Well, then you missed out.

679
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Although I think the most enjoyable thing about this might be not eating, but reading.

680
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:39,000
And this is a sign credit to friend of the show, BugmaneBuzzBuzz for finding this and sending me this.

681
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
And I've been obsessed with it for weeks.

682
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
This is just a banner. You can see it if you go to the park in the daytime, too.

683
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:52,000
I would like everybody, perhaps at once, however you want to do it, everyone just try to read this menu item.

684
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Go ahead. Anyone give it a shot whenever you feel like it.

685
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Think out loud. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Marissa, go for it.

686
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Okay. Chuckie's Macassacre and Cheese.

687
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,000
But the and cheese feels like it should be bigger. And cheese!

688
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
It also, that switches back to a regular font.

689
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:18,000
We just go to Cooper Black and then before that is like, buddy, painted by Chuckie himself.

690
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:23,000
But this is, you could stare at this Chuckie's Macassacre.

691
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,000
It's real.

692
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Ass is in there, yeah.

693
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
I feel like the ass.

694
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Oh yeah, it does say ass. Just ass.

695
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Yeah, that's what I saw.

696
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Is that supposed to be like Chuckie's fucking with you? He put ass in the food.

697
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,000
I mean, he stuck his ass in the mac and cheese.

698
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
He rubbed it all over.

699
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,000
My ass is the secret ingredient. So, praise God.

700
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Well, he wrote it in blood.

701
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:55,000
So obviously, I mean, I don't know where the first part of it went. Nobody's selling just and cheese.

702
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
And cheese.

703
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
No need to horrify that part.

704
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Gotta tell the customer what they're getting.

705
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Tiffany probably wrote and cheese. Tiffany's Chuckie's life partner.

706
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Oh, that's the bride?

707
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Oh, okay.

708
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Bride of Chuckie.

709
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Yeah.

710
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Macmascassacres.

711
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Macassacre?

712
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Macassacre.

713
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
That is incredible.

714
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:24,000
I'm almost happy they put something so clunky and they didn't note it to be less clunky.

715
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Yeah, it's still good.

716
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:30,000
It's got some of the best, worst named food.

717
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:38,000
You probably talked about this. If you went, when they had the Ghostbusters maze there, this was years ago.

718
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:48,000
They had one of the grossest looking things I've seen. It was a hot dog with green, kind of like neon green ketchup or something.

719
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Maybe it was supposed to be a relish. And it was called Slimer's Dirty Water Dog.

720
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
No, no, no.

721
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Jason, would you have tried that?

722
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Yeah, of course. I mean, most dogs, especially at a theme park made in large quantities, are sitting in that dirty hot dog water.

723
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Right, that's true. So you wouldn't have been bothered.

724
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Was that a sentence meant to prove why it's good?

725
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:15,000
I was like, well, I guess of course it hears why. Dirty hot dog water.

726
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Well, do you know about, in Florida, I think it's just in Florida they have a hot dog at hard nights that comes on a Funfetti bun.

727
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
No, I haven't seen this Funfetti bun.

728
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Does it have a name?

729
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Sounds a bit cloudy.

730
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Yeah, Jason, look up the name.

731
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Why don't you look that up?

732
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Because I have another one ready to go. This looks gross, strange name too. This is the Always Come Back Corn Dog.

733
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:48,000
And what does this even look like to you on the top? I mean, I'll say the ingredients, but just like, can you name a food item that you're looking at?

734
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Is it Hot Cheetos?

735
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
It's a corn dog which is like red. You got it. Yeah, yeah.

736
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Hot Cheetos and Jason New.

737
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
He's got the eye.

738
00:39:54,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Hot Cheetos and Taki crumble with an orange garlic aioli. But this is nightmarish.

739
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
I thought it was kimchi.

740
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Oh, sure. That's not a bad guess. It's hard to imagine how that would blend.

741
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:14,000
It looks like a fried pickle on a bed of confetti. White bed of confetti.

742
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
And for this you pay $13.

743
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
That's a scary unlucky price.

744
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
What a deal.

745
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Okay, here we go. The Florida food. Dr. Oddfellows corn evil dog. Dr. Oddfellows their icon this year.

746
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:43,000
He's kind of like a carnival barker, like sinister guy. I believe I learned he killed Jack, another icon of Horror Nights in the continuity of Horror Nights.

747
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:56,000
This is Dr. Oddfellows corn evil dog, a red hot dog in a confetti hot dog bun, goulay pickles, bubble gum mustard and potato sticks.

748
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
What?

749
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Potato sticks are fries.

750
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:04,000
No, no. Like the chip potato sticks.

751
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Oh.

752
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Like crushed.

753
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Like just like the little like slivers of potato potato potato sticks.

754
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Yeah, I also I didn't understand either of those ingredients bubble gum.

755
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
What is it?

756
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
What does that mean?

757
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:26,000
They can't just say that and expect me to fill in the caps.

758
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
It doesn't make me want to buy it.

759
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,000
No. And what was the first the one before bubble gum mustard?

760
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Kool-Aid pickles.

761
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
What does that mean?

762
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Are they soaking in cool?

763
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Yeah, you just, you know, toss some Kool-Aid mix into the vinegar when you're making the pickles.

764
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Also, what's red hot dog?

765
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:54,000
You know, that one's interesting. That can go a lot of ways. There's lots of different color hot dogs like a red hot or like I've had white hot dogs that are more poultry based.

766
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
You've had a white hot dog?

767
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Nobody calls it a white hot dog.

768
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:01,000
You know when it's kind of fuzzy and long and it's kind of been sitting in the fridge a long time.

769
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
It's aged. Many years.

770
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Purple dogs, green dogs. I've had them all.

771
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Spectrum of dogs.

772
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000
He brought them to an improv party.

773
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Jason brought three white hot dogs to an improv party.

774
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Sad white hot dogs.

775
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Here we go. Hoffman white hots.

776
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,000
They look kind of like bratwurst.

777
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
It looks adorable.

778
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,000
It looks like something that should have been from hundreds of years ago and stayed there.

779
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:32,000
It looks like a hot dog got scared in a cartoon and like all of it's color was shit.

780
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Here's a whole, here's multicolor. Different shades of hot dog.

781
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Not one thing in that. You got 15 images in that Google search. There's not one that looks appetizing to me.

782
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:52,000
I'm going to look at this iPad later today and the image searches that are open are just different colored hot dogs.

783
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,000
And your mouth will start watering. All over the iPad.

784
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:01,000
I will be like, I thought I'd close these tabs yesterday.

785
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:06,000
You should buy like a pack, like you know you get crayons and there's 16 colors.

786
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,000
You should get one of those with hot dogs in them. With each different color.

787
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Hot dogs from around the world. Yeah.

788
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Yeah, that's right.

789
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:21,000
I'm looking at a photo with a close up of bubblegum mustard. It is like, it's bubblegum color. It's like salmon.

790
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:30,000
And then bright red burger. And I'm reading a review that said, quote the review, it's not as offensive as we expected.

791
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,000
But it's also not good. We wouldn't eat it again.

792
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
That's the best thing we could say.

793
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Yeah. God.

794
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:40,000
What, I mean if the bubblegum flavor is so strong at that point, what even makes it still mustard?

795
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Why wouldn't it just be like with bubblegum juice? You know what I mean?

796
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Yeah. Yeah.

797
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:51,000
I guess it's just mustard where they add a bubblegum flavor, but still at that point, like what's the point?

798
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:56,000
It's a transformation like a werewolf. It became were bubblegum.

799
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Yeah. It's no longer mustard.

800
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
It's no longer, yeah.

801
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Also review, the bun was not fresh.

802
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:07,000
What excuse would there be for the bun to be not fresh? There's no such thing as confetti buns until this calendar year.

803
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Why would they not be fresh?

804
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Organic funfetti. Boy, that sounds delicious to me.

805
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
And you like a stale bun, Jason? Am I wrong?

806
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Huh?

807
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
You like a little stale bun or am I wrong? Am I thinking of somebody else?

808
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:25,000
I like a chewy bun. Like I like an Amarosa roll or a Martin's potato roll. Those are pretty.

809
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Those are chewy. But like if it's stale, stale is a little, it depends. There's good and bad stales for stales.

810
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Stales for like a pork. Are there?

811
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:40,000
For like a portillo's or a Coles rose beef. If you're getting a lot of dip on there.

812
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Yeah. If you're soaking it.

813
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,000
If you're soaking it, the stale buns are better because it holds up.

814
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Right. And then it soaks it and makes the stale, the hardness a little bit less hard.

815
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Yeah.

816
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
So you prefer it to be old.

817
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:57,000
No, I'm not saying I want it to be old, but sometimes when things are just a little stale, it's actually kind of good.

818
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Or there's something interesting.

819
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
For the dip.

820
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
For the dip.

821
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Or a gentle.

822
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Because it'll fall apart maybe if the bun's too soft and you put it in the dip.

823
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Exactly.

824
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Like Lindsay likes a little stale popcorn. That's not my favorite, but she likes it a little like a day past.

825
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:15,000
We have a pal that opens her popcorn early and then eats it like a week later.

826
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Yep.

827
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Oh, a week later.

828
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
She's a fan of stale food.

829
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Yeah.

830
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Jason, you might have a friend.

831
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Can we talk real quick? We've been talking, not that we've talked a lot about it, but the phrase has come up a couple of times on the show lately.

832
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Plush pile.

833
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Yes.

834
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
I'm just waiting for Mr. To say something because she looks like she's about to throw up.

835
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Yeah, it, I mean, oh God, I don't even want to say it, but it just sounded like a way like a pervert would talk about a vagina.

836
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Let me see that.

837
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
That is plush pile.

838
00:45:53,000 --> 00:46:00,000
That's true. I was about to say, like you were just doing, you can only say that while rubbing your hands together menacingly.

839
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
That is not where I was going with it.

840
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Are you talking about?

841
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
That's not how the discussion has been.

842
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Because I was up in Universal in the daytime when family was visiting and there are large plush piles.

843
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Yes.

844
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Kind of by the Starbucks, right?

845
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Yes.

846
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Like the one entryway?

847
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,000
There's also a big, I was not talking about a vagina.

848
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:23,000
I was talking about literal piles of like stuffed animals and stuff.

849
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Jason was though.

850
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
There were two of them outside the studio.

851
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
He was just nude.

852
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
It was during the day.

853
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:37,000
This has come up, this is all strange now because this has become, because this is like the thing that Disney Store used to have.

854
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
This is the thing that Disney Store.

855
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Where a bunch of stuffed animals are in a big pyramid.

856
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Yeah, but it's thick and twisted when Chucky is involved, you know.

857
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Yeah, and they recreated a plush pile at Destination D in Orlando.

858
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Which is for the people who paid what, $500?

859
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,000
They got to like see what a Disney Store looked like 10 years ago.

860
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Which is why it came up.

861
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Worth every penny.

862
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:05,000
But yeah, they have like at the, they always do kind of a big entrance to Horror Nights that happens by the Starbucks in Hollywood.

863
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
That's past the Waterworld stage.

864
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
And I was just like, wow, plush pile.

865
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,000
There's a big plush pile right there.

866
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
But then, there's a monster.

867
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,000
There's also though a monster emerging, which looks almost like a Yeti or something.

868
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Yeah.

869
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Yeah.

870
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
I wasn't really.

871
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:25,000
It was a little confusing because like the plush pile, I was like, oh, maybe this is tied to Chucky because there's like a toy theme.

872
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Right.

873
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,000
But it wasn't Chucky themed.

874
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Right.

875
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
I didn't know what it was for.

876
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
I don't know.

877
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
I don't know why it's there.

878
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,000
But I was just, I was, I was happy to see it because I do like a plush pile.

879
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
That is something I do like.

880
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Are people calling this a plush pile?

881
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,000
I was like, well, I was like, I've heard that before.

882
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:45,000
And then I'm like, oh, it's because Mike called it that at Halloween Horror Nights.

883
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
But I think it accurately describes what it is.

884
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
It does.

885
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Much like clowny cones.

886
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Like, you make up so many phrases.

887
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Mighty Mekron.

888
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
You do.

889
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Let's look up plush pile and.

890
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Nothing but vagina.

891
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
It's all porno.

892
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
It's all porno.

893
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
It's all porno.

894
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Well, here's what.

895
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:06,000
The first Google image for that phrase is from BronyCon 2019.

896
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Oh, yeah.

897
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Yeah.

898
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
That makes sense.

899
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Oh, maybe that is maybe a plush pile is some sort of orgy situation.

900
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Well, that's a cuddle puddle.

901
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Is it with a with furries?

902
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
No, I think that's any orgy.

903
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
I think that's the after the orgy.

904
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Everyone just lies around together.

905
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,000
But the plush aspect would make it seem that there's a furry quality to it.

906
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
You know what I'm saying?

907
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Oh, yeah.

908
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
So maybe it is like a furry orgy.

909
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
And maybe that's what Marissa's thinking.

910
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Which could end in a plush pile cuddle puddle.

911
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Yes, sure.

912
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
A cuddle puddle.

913
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Yeah, for sure.

914
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
It can be, I think, furry or non-furry.

915
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Yeah.

916
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
But plush pile, I think, has to be furries.

917
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
And it doesn't have to be sexual, maybe.

918
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
It could be just a cuddle puddle version of it.

919
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
We're all flopping together.

920
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Yeah.

921
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
We're all flopping.

922
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Well, you're right, though.

923
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
There was another.

924
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
There were plush piles at Knott's this year, too.

925
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Yeah.

926
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Yes.

927
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
There was a whole room.

928
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
I mean, it was great.

929
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Really good room in one of their mazes.

930
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
The chilling chambers.

931
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
They had a plush pile room.

932
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Yes.

933
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
There was a big plush pile.

934
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Yeah, like all on the wall.

935
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:09,800
And Michael Eisner knew what he was doing when he put those plush piles together back

936
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:10,800
in the day.

937
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:14,440
Because they're popping up, and I still go, I like seeing them all together.

938
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:16,600
I like seeing all these, even if I don't know the characters.

939
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:17,600
It doesn't matter.

940
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:21,800
But now I will never see one or hear the phrase without thinking about what Marissa said.

941
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:23,800
This phrase is forever tainted.

942
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:24,800
I hope for the listeners, too.

943
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:30,800
Every Disney store had one big plush pile at the very end by the big video.

944
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:31,800
Watch these dens of perversion.

945
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:32,800
Yeah.

946
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:33,800
Cue it on his right.

947
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:37,600
I'm sorry to hurt your brains.

948
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:39,600
No, it's OK.

949
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:40,600
Their favorite phrases.

950
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:42,600
It's our favorite phrase.

951
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:46,600
So, yeah, I like seeing that.

952
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:49,200
It was a returning maze.

953
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,200
It was the holidays.

954
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:52,200
Oh, Holidays in Hell.

955
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:56,200
Holidays in Hell maze, where you go through all the holidays, and they're all, of course,

956
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:59,200
twisted, murderous versions of the holidays.

957
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:00,200
That one was good.

958
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:01,200
It was fun.

959
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:02,200
And that was fun.

960
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:04,600
What's the deepest cut of holiday?

961
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:07,600
Because you've got Santa and Easter Bunny, but what's the one where they're stretching

962
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:08,600
it a little bit?

963
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:09,600
Did they have an Arbor Day one?

964
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:10,600
Yeah, there's an Arbor Day.

965
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:11,600
Yeah.

966
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:12,600
All right.

967
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:14,600
Yeah, I feel like they expanded it since the last time.

968
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:17,600
It was maybe half as many holidays, and they were like, fuck it.

969
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:19,600
Let's just do everything.

970
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:20,600
It felt pretty fun.

971
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:21,600
It felt longer.

972
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:28,600
There was a good candy smell in the Easter section, and then there was a turkey smell

973
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:31,600
that made you want to vomit in the Thanksgiving room.

974
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
They love a stinky room.

975
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,000
And it was a really...

976
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
I think especially Universal loves stinky rooms.

977
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Yes, I think that's right.

978
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
I don't remember Knott's.

979
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Knott's has smells, but I don't think anything like...

980
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
There's a fart room this year.

981
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Oh, yeah.

982
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,000
There's like an elephant butt farting.

983
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,000
There's an elephant butt farting, and it's so funny.

984
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Knott's or Universal?

985
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Knott's.

986
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Knott's has elephant farts.

987
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,000
You just walk through them, there's just elephant butts and the tails fly up.

988
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:58,000
There's a clown in there, at least the couple times we've gone, where he goes stinky and

989
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:01,400
he points to the person you're with and he's like, they're the one who farted.

990
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:03,400
And it's not a scare room.

991
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:06,400
It's like literally you just walk through and there's just elephants farting.

992
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:10,400
This is one part of a maze that my toddler would love.

993
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,400
He would eat up every bit of that.

994
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:15,400
I'm always shocked that there are toddlers going through these mazes.

995
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:17,400
Every haunt.

996
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:18,400
I'm not saying to do that.

997
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:21,400
I'm not advocating for that, but I am always shocked.

998
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:23,400
If your toddler is willing, mine is...

999
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:26,400
I got a frady cat just like his frady cat dad.

1000
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:28,800
God knows if you have a toddler who's into it.

1001
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:29,800
Why not?

1002
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:30,800
I guess.

1003
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:34,800
I guess also there's that point too when the kid doesn't know what they're seeing even

1004
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:35,800
too.

1005
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:36,800
There's a point where maybe they...

1006
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:41,800
There's like a point up to like three or four maybe where they're just like, okay,

1007
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:42,800
lights and stuff.

1008
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:43,800
Slashing lights.

1009
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:44,800
Nice.

1010
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:45,800
It seems too loud for little ears though.

1011
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:46,800
It absolutely seems too loud.

1012
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:47,800
It's too loud.

1013
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:49,800
Too many strobe lights and stuff.

1014
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:54,800
But I am still amazed when I see people just being like, fuck it, the kid's coming with.

1015
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:55,800
That's everywhere.

1016
00:51:56,200 --> 00:52:00,200
I remember that at Meow Wolf in Vegas, a woman holding like an eight month old under her

1017
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:03,200
arm, hiking up the spiral stairs.

1018
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:05,200
I'm like, this is what?

1019
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:07,200
You can't be enjoying this either.

1020
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:08,200
Yeah.

1021
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:10,200
I was just like, that's okay.

1022
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:11,200
Just fuck it.

1023
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:12,200
We're bringing the kid.

1024
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:13,200
No other option.

1025
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:16,200
We have to go to see what Omega Mart's all about.

1026
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:17,200
Yeah.

1027
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:20,200
So I like the holidays one.

1028
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:23,200
Universal is always fun.

1029
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:25,200
There's a ceiling on these mazes.

1030
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:26,600
Maybe I've said this before.

1031
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:28,600
Maybe I think we've talked about it there.

1032
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:34,400
Where it feels like they run out of budget for certain like transitional rooms.

1033
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:38,720
And it feels like there's a couple just like dark hallways that like take you out of the

1034
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:39,720
immersive thing.

1035
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:42,400
And I don't see it at knots as much, or at least I don't feel it at knots.

1036
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,000
No, I don't think it's there.

1037
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Yeah.

1038
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,000
And I don't know.

1039
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,560
I don't know if it's a budget thing or if it's not.

1040
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:49,120
I'm sure everyone's working hard.

1041
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:52,040
But I'm always a little bit like, I get really psyched.

1042
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:57,040
Because I think we did that first, that the dark mother maze.

1043
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:58,040
Thank you.

1044
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:01,040
And we'll call it dark mother from now on.

1045
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:04,040
The evil dead rise maze should be the dark mother maze.

1046
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:05,040
And it's not, unfortunately.

1047
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:06,040
And it's not.

1048
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:09,040
It doesn't have a bird.

1049
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:10,040
Yeah.

1050
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:12,040
And I always get kind of like, oh, like maybe this year, like it's really they're going

1051
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:13,040
to take it up like a crazy notch.

1052
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:17,040
And then like there'll be a few mazes and like Stranger Things was like that where you're

1053
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:20,040
like, yeah, but it's not quite.

1054
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:21,040
Where were the elephants farting?

1055
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:24,040
Where was the magic in a lot of these?

1056
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:25,040
Yeah.

1057
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:27,040
And they didn't have the weekend last year.

1058
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:30,040
I really liked because it was kind of just an oddity for them.

1059
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:33,040
But it's always there's a little something missing every year.

1060
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:35,040
And I wish I don't know.

1061
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:36,040
I don't know how you feel about it.

1062
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:37,040
You have similar pages.

1063
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:38,040
I think.

1064
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:39,040
Yeah.

1065
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:43,040
I feel like I think everybody who works that like the scare actors are all really good.

1066
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:44,040
Absolutely.

1067
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:46,040
The design is limited by some.

1068
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:47,040
And some of the design is really good.

1069
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:51,040
But it feels like there's a lot of like dark hallways where people are just popping out

1070
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:56,040
of there's just a loud noise and somebody like pulling a curtain aside and jumping out.

1071
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:58,040
It's like a black box theater.

1072
00:53:58,040 --> 00:54:03,040
You know, just it feels sort of predictable in some of the scares there, which I guess

1073
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:08,040
is a thing I would say that it's a if you're a scaredy cat is good because you kind of

1074
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:11,040
by the way, I know kind of how this is going to go.

1075
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:14,040
Not as a little more of like keeping you on your toes.

1076
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:17,040
I feel like they're they're using like a little shaker cans and banging drums.

1077
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:19,040
And also they're jumping over you.

1078
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:21,040
There's a lot of like overhead scares and not.

1079
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:22,040
Yes.

1080
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:25,040
Things will fly at you bungee kind of bungee.

1081
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:26,040
Yeah, there was bungee.

1082
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:27,040
Yeah, Jack.

1083
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:28,040
Oh, we didn't talk about that.

1084
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:31,040
I was surprised because you've talked you've brought that up in other haunts.

1085
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:33,040
And I thought that sounded pretty scary.

1086
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:36,040
And I didn't realize I'd be encountering a bungee guy.

1087
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:38,040
I didn't know they had the budget for it at checktoberfest.

1088
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:39,040
Yeah.

1089
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:40,040
Pretty surprised animatronics.

1090
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:41,040
So, you know, check that out on the page.

1091
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:42,040
And if you want to hear more about that.

1092
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:43,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1093
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:45,040
They had bungee money.

1094
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:48,040
Jason bought three sodas.

1095
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:51,040
He's still coasting on that.

1096
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:54,040
That's how he bought a dozen more franchise.

1097
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:55,040
The entire empire.

1098
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:56,040
Thank you, Jason.

1099
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:58,040
Flush with cash ever since.

1100
00:54:58,040 --> 00:55:00,040
Yeah, not as the witch.

1101
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:01,040
I'm like that.

1102
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:02,040
Yes, I love that way.

1103
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:04,040
And the Calico origins may.

1104
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:05,040
Yes.

1105
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:06,040
Which is one of my favorites.

1106
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:07,040
So, yeah.

1107
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:11,040
So if I had to ever say anything that I would say, I guess I would say I would say I would

1108
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:15,040
say if I had to ever say anything negative, first of all, it's such a hard universal,

1109
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:18,040
such a hard park to like walk around.

1110
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:19,040
Yes.

1111
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:22,040
You really feel like exhausted by the end of up and down.

1112
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:27,040
And there's no again not there's no evil starway this year again.

1113
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:28,040
Which I think.

1114
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:30,040
Which really I was hoping написa like maybe they'll bring it back.

1115
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:35,040
But the starway when you're on the escalators used to have like a scary voice.

1116
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:38,040
Oh, and now it's just a regular voice.

1117
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:41,040
I'm not playing happy during this, I don't think.

1118
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:46,040
But they may as well be because the tone is still sort of just normal starway or just they

1119
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:48,040
should do a parody because it's scary.

1120
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:49,040
Great.

1121
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:50,040
That would be great.

1122
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:51,040
Yeah.

1123
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:52,040
Yeah.

1124
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:54,040
I think Chuckie one time was the voice of the yes.

1125
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:55,040
Yes.

1126
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:56,040
Yeah.

1127
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:57,040
So that would have been good, too.

1128
00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:01,040
But yeah, the starway used to be like, don't smoke and don't smoke weed.

1129
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:05,040
Like and you could say weed and you'd be like, whoa, who is this?

1130
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:10,040
Big Yaddle taking over Universal Studios.

1131
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:11,040
Oh, I wish.

1132
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:15,040
I wish there was like a big Yaddle like, you know, there's a big minion you can see.

1133
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:19,040
I wish from the five in Anaheim use a big Yaddle over the Daltese edge.

1134
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:22,040
That's really what it's always flood shot eyes.

1135
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:23,040
Yeah.

1136
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:24,040
Yeah.

1137
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:25,040
Yeah.

1138
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:26,040
Yeah.

1139
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:27,040
Smoked up.

1140
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:28,040
Yeah.

1141
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:29,040
It's like the Paris Disney Paris Space Mountain.

1142
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:32,040
Like there's a ride that like rockets out of Yaddle's blunt.

1143
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:33,040
Because Yaddle's going to the moon.

1144
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:34,040
You know what I mean?

1145
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:37,040
I think Yaddle was killed in a comic that I send you.

1146
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:39,040
Or did you send me this?

1147
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:43,040
But did she make an appearance in one of the Disney TV shows at some point?

1148
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:44,040
I don't know.

1149
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:45,040
She's going to have to.

1150
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:47,040
They're running out of characters to bring back.

1151
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:48,040
Yeah.

1152
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:50,040
We got to look Yaddle's in season nine of Ahsoka.

1153
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:53,040
Everyone biting their tongue so hard it bleeds.

1154
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:56,040
They're like, I'm so it wasn't my favorite.

1155
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:57,040
It was pretty good.

1156
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:59,040
I'm like, I'm going to go back to the show.

1157
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:01,040
It was so it wasn't my favorite.

1158
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:02,040
It was pretty good.

1159
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:03,040
Oh, but Yaddle showed up.

1160
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:04,040
Hey.

1161
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:08,040
Yaddle showed up and she smoked all the Jedi up.

1162
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:12,040
They didn't do anything for the rest of the episode.

1163
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:14,040
This is a chill out.

1164
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:16,040
You drink a lot of Blue Mills.

1165
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:21,040
Jedi bottle episode because the hot pox with Yaddle.

1166
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:25,040
Honestly would watch it.

1167
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:26,040
Yeah.

1168
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:29,040
You ever just think about the force?

1169
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:32,040
It's pretty trippy if you think about it.

1170
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:34,040
What are midichlorians?

1171
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:35,040
Midichlorians.

1172
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:36,040
Thank you.

1173
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:39,040
Macassacre.

1174
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:41,040
Everybody tried to say it at the same time.

1175
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:47,040
When all those young things died, it was a real Macassacre.

1176
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:51,040
We tried this happened last year where they make the they turn Jurassic

1177
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:56,040
Patio into a cool neon lights bar.

1178
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:57,040
This was the weekend last year.

1179
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:58,040
The weekend last year.

1180
00:57:58,040 --> 00:58:02,040
But the same situation where it was too crowded up there and it just for how

1181
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:03,040
much you have to get done.

1182
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:04,040
It was a stranger things this year.

1183
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:05,040
Right.

1184
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:06,040
Yeah.

1185
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:09,040
And again, it was as fun as the weekend like after hours party.

1186
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:11,040
But it was still like, I want to go up there.

1187
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:13,040
And then we went up there and the line was just insane.

1188
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:17,040
The core of Jurassic Patio is that there are only five people.

1189
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:21,040
It's not truly Jurassic Patio if it's not mostly deserted.

1190
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:22,040
Yes.

1191
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:26,040
Jurassic Patio is a wonderful place during the day to go up and chill out.

1192
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:28,040
Jason loves his meal that now is bad.

1193
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:30,040
He mentioned this recently.

1194
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:34,040
There was a meal you used to love at Jurassic at the restaurant underneath.

1195
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:37,040
You was fine when I had it recently.

1196
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:38,040
What was it again?

1197
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:44,040
Well, it used to be like mollo pork on a Ray Paz with rice and beans.

1198
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:45,040
I don't.

1199
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:48,040
I was trying so hard.

1200
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:50,040
I still don't know how to say it.

1201
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:51,040
Marissa, is that how you say it?

1202
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:52,040
No.

1203
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:53,040
Right.

1204
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:54,040
Is it?

1205
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:55,040
A repas.

1206
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:57,040
But you don't have to do it all big.

1207
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:59,040
I want to hear you do it all big.

1208
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:00,040
Do it.

1209
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:01,040
A repas.

1210
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:02,040
That's close.

1211
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:03,040
Roll the R.

1212
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:04,040
A repas.

1213
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:05,040
Oh, yeah.

1214
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:07,040
I can't roll my R like that.

1215
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:08,040
Sorpresa.

1216
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:13,040
I thought I said mojo wrong.

1217
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:15,040
Well, that's the English.

1218
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:17,040
Oh, I can't speak to that word.

1219
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:19,040
Oh, okay.

1220
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:22,040
But you said it got worse, that dish.

1221
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:26,040
It's just like pork dumped on a giant plate of rice.

1222
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:28,040
Now, there's no beans.

1223
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:31,040
But they got rid of the beans is what you're saying?

1224
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:32,040
They used to have beans?

1225
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:33,040
Yeah, I swear they did.

1226
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:36,040
I swear to fucking God.

1227
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:37,040
All right, all right.

1228
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:38,040
I believe you.

1229
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:43,040
Now, we ate inside because it was very hot today.

1230
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:47,040
My family was up there, so I didn't make it up to Jurassic Patio.

1231
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:48,040
Right.

1232
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:50,040
There is good shading, though, at Jurassic Patio as well.

1233
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:51,040
But if it was too hot, yeah.

1234
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:56,040
But no, it turns into a hip nightclub during horror nights that I nab.

1235
00:59:56,040 --> 00:59:58,040
Ask anyone with a meter for what's hip.

1236
00:59:58,040 --> 01:00:00,040
They'll tell you the hippest spot in Los Angeles.

1237
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:03,040
You've got to go to Jurassic Patio at Horror Night.

1238
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:12,040
But you're saying the bar based on the TV show starring children is not as good as the bar based on the mega star.

1239
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:14,040
Well, it didn't seem as exciting to me.

1240
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:18,040
And the line was still crazy, but not as crazy as the weekend line.

1241
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:23,040
That was more people were more drawn to a weekend club than Stranger Things Club.

1242
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:29,040
But it was better because there was a longer line, but you're more mad at it because the line was longer.

1243
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:30,040
I would say I was more mad at it.

1244
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:31,040
Yeah.

1245
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:38,040
It's also I think it's drawing to me because it's very it's an aesthetic I would like it a douchey pool party in Vegas.

1246
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:49,040
I don't want to now force us into the main topic, but this does occur to me that the aesthetic of the big show we want to talk about.

1247
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:53,040
I mean, the first that I knew this existed, I thought of you.

1248
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:55,040
Yeah, I think a lot of listeners were the same.

1249
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:56,040
Thank you for thinking of me.

1250
01:00:56,040 --> 01:01:00,040
And I guess I get I think that just being that there are like light strips in it.

1251
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:03,040
Yeah, it's dark and there's lasers and it's neon.

1252
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:05,040
And I like that.

1253
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:07,040
And music is loud and music is loud.

1254
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:09,040
Music is I don't know the neon is hip neon is timeless.

1255
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:10,040
It's timeless.

1256
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:13,040
Yeah, I think we all like neon, right?

1257
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:14,040
Oh, yeah.

1258
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:15,040
Oh, yeah.

1259
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:16,040
OK.

1260
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:17,040
I love a neon sign.

1261
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:18,040
Ooh, vintage neon.

1262
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:20,040
Oh, give me that old gas.

1263
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:21,040
Yeah.

1264
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:22,040
Yeah.

1265
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:23,040
Yeah.

1266
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:24,040
Well, yeah.

1267
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:28,040
The show we're talking about has a lot of neon and it has smoke.

1268
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:29,040
It has lasers.

1269
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:31,040
It has EDM music.

1270
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:37,040
Well, this is if I could read the tweet, because this is what I this is probably the first I heard of it.

1271
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:41,040
And I definitely saw listeners going, oh, my mic meter is going off.

1272
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:42,040
Correct.

1273
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:48,040
Don't miss this new show where you will be thrust into the purge during a fiery EDM fight.

1274
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:55,040
During a fiery EDM fueled stunt spectacular unprecedented fuel for anything.

1275
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:57,040
Sound better than that.

1276
01:01:57,040 --> 01:02:00,040
Now, this is just to clarify.

1277
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:03,040
I don't know that you listen to a lot of EDM.

1278
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:04,040
I don't know.

1279
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:07,040
I was about to put you on this, but now name your three favorite EDM artists.

1280
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:13,040
So we were leaving and they're playing this loud music and we'll reveal why in a second.

1281
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:14,040
But we're playing this music.

1282
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:17,040
And I think I said to both of you, I said, I go, is this the prodigy?

1283
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:21,040
It did. It did sound like fire starter, but a little off.

1284
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:23,040
This is old 25 year old music.

1285
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:26,040
I think our bud that sang in it, he passed away and for.

1286
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:27,040
Oh, is that right?

1287
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:28,040
I didn't know that.

1288
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:30,040
So the prodigy.

1289
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:33,040
So I was that was my reference essentially to EDM.

1290
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:37,040
But it didn't sound that dissimilar to the prodigy.

1291
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:39,040
I don't think I was so crazy.

1292
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:41,040
I wasn't so wrong about how it sounded.

1293
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:46,040
It sounded like something very derivative of it or like almost like a remix and homage to.

1294
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:48,040
Sure. You know, well, that makes sense.

1295
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:49,040
Yeah.

1296
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:51,040
Theme park EDM.

1297
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:54,040
That makes sense that it would be maybe not the most cutting edge.

1298
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:55,040
Yes.

1299
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:59,040
Kind of a pastiche of an older rendition.

1300
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:00,040
Yeah.

1301
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:02,040
The type of music that's what I liked about it.

1302
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:04,040
It felt familiar.

1303
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:05,040
Yeah.

1304
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:06,040
Which is nice.

1305
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:07,040
So yeah.

1306
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:13,040
So this is a purge themed show and they're using the bones and the set.

1307
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:16,040
I shouldn't say I should just say set of the Water World show.

1308
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:17,040
So it's exact.

1309
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:19,040
They haven't changed the set very much.

1310
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:21,040
But and they don't use certain.

1311
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:23,040
There's no like the plane doesn't happen.

1312
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:24,040
Big plane.

1313
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:27,040
I was wondering because it's been a while since I saw the actual Water World show.

1314
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:29,040
I was like, maybe I get to see the plane.

1315
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:32,040
I'm like, oh, they're going to make you pay another day to see the plane.

1316
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:33,040
I guess so. Yeah.

1317
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:36,040
I was wondering if they would shoot something else over the wall.

1318
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:39,040
But I don't think there was a purge banner.

1319
01:03:39,040 --> 01:03:40,040
There are a lot of banners.

1320
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:41,040
Yeah.

1321
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:44,040
I think that was the most significant change shift.

1322
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:45,040
Yeah.

1323
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:46,040
And like day glow.

1324
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:47,040
Like it's written in paint.

1325
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:50,040
You can't see when you come in and then they shine lights on it.

1326
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:56,040
And they have purge light different colored lights with the masks, the purge masks.

1327
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:58,040
I don't know how to describe it.

1328
01:03:58,040 --> 01:03:59,040
The X's over the eyes.

1329
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:00,040
Yeah.

1330
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:01,040
Yeah.

1331
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:02,040
Like iconography of the purge.

1332
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:03,040
Now.

1333
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:04,040
The purgers wear often.

1334
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:07,040
We did some purge stuff like this point two years ago.

1335
01:04:07,040 --> 01:04:08,040
Yeah.

1336
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:09,040
With J'Kees.

1337
01:04:09,040 --> 01:04:10,040
Yeah.

1338
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:13,040
And I have not seen a purge movie still.

1339
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:14,040
I've not watched one.

1340
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:18,040
So I don't know anything more than I did then about the purge.

1341
01:04:18,040 --> 01:04:20,040
Whatever I learned there is what I know.

1342
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:21,040
But that's how it should be.

1343
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:23,040
You know, you shouldn't have to be a purge expert.

1344
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:25,040
No. And they don't make you need to know anything.

1345
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:27,040
It's a simple show.

1346
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:29,040
I've never seen any purge movies either.

1347
01:04:29,040 --> 01:04:34,040
But what feels like 200 years of Halloween Horror Nights having the purge as a theme.

1348
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:37,040
Everything I need to know.

1349
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:38,040
Yeah.

1350
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:43,040
Because it's a series of movies and one season of a TV show, I believe.

1351
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:56,040
Where they that features a announce an announcer telling you what the purge is in every one of them, including this show.

1352
01:04:56,040 --> 01:04:59,040
Yeah, this is a recurring. You are reminded for sure.

1353
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:03,040
You can come in on any purge, I would think, including the live show.

1354
01:05:03,040 --> 01:05:04,040
Good idea. Purge is a fun high.

1355
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:05,040
Well, fun may be weird.

1356
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:07,040
A good high concept idea.

1357
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:10,040
But I've never had the desire to see a movie.

1358
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:11,040
Sure.

1359
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:13,040
It feels like it will be upsetting.

1360
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:14,040
Yeah.

1361
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:18,040
I don't think they're always such like orgies of over the top.

1362
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:19,040
Yeah.

1363
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:21,040
I enjoyed the first one.

1364
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:23,040
I watched the first one, I think, before we talk to Jacqueeson.

1365
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:25,040
First one pretty exciting.

1366
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:27,040
It almost feels like more of a real movie.

1367
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:32,040
You know, the way horror movies kind of start to get like pulpy and like the actors are kind of.

1368
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:34,040
There's no more actors you've heard of in them.

1369
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:36,040
And so the first purge is real.

1370
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:38,040
That's Ethan Hawke in that one.

1371
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:39,040
Yeah, yeah.

1372
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:40,040
Good cast.

1373
01:05:40,040 --> 01:05:41,040
Uh huh.

1374
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:42,040
Strong cast.

1375
01:05:42,040 --> 01:05:44,040
Okay, maybe I got to get into the purge.

1376
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:46,040
Yeah, I didn't know he was in that.

1377
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:47,040
I'll watch that.

1378
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:54,040
It gets to from Ethan Hawke to Frank Grillo very quickly in terms of stars.

1379
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:56,040
No shade to Grillo.

1380
01:05:56,040 --> 01:05:57,040
Yeah, yeah.

1381
01:05:57,040 --> 01:05:58,040
Multigullman cast member.

1382
01:05:58,040 --> 01:05:59,040
Don't let Grillo here.

1383
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:00,040
He's a tough guy.

1384
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:01,040
He's a tough guy.

1385
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:02,040
He's going to come after you.

1386
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:03,040
What'd you say about me?

1387
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:05,040
So yeah, so the show.

1388
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:27,040
So basically, yeah, the show starts with like an evil senator and his team kind of coming in and like relishing the idea that the purge, which if you don't know the purge, is like a 12 hour period where murder is legal and it's basically, you know, poor people kill each other while the very rich people and politicians all kind of like enjoy the chaos of all of it.

1389
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:28,040
I hate to correct you.

1390
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:30,040
All crime is legal.

1391
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:31,040
Yeah, you're right.

1392
01:06:31,040 --> 01:06:32,040
Yes.

1393
01:06:32,040 --> 01:06:33,040
Including that.

1394
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:35,040
They say all crime is legal, including murder.

1395
01:06:35,040 --> 01:06:38,040
Generally, that's like the topper for it.

1396
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:44,040
But it's really it seems to be I think a recurring thing is that, yeah, if you don't have a lot of money, you're screwed in the purge.

1397
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:50,040
If you have a lot of money, you can fortify these big compounds, which break always.

1398
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:51,040
Of course.

1399
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:53,040
The most purging happening to you.

1400
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:54,040
It's all yes.

1401
01:06:54,040 --> 01:06:55,040
It's class warfare.

1402
01:06:55,040 --> 01:07:03,040
And yeah, so so the show starts with a very cocky senator talking about he's going to his whatever safe house with a name.

1403
01:07:03,040 --> 01:07:06,040
Do it was he just sent it when I think I heard Phil.

1404
01:07:06,040 --> 01:07:08,040
But I don't I don't know about last name.

1405
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:10,040
Yeah, it's I want to know the full mythology.

1406
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:11,040
I wanted to too.

1407
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:15,040
And I was listening to it and I was like, I can't get a clear name from the video I'm watching.

1408
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:22,040
And yeah, so there's somebody there's like he calls his advisor a name, but I couldn't catch the actual senators last name.

1409
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:24,040
Well, he's one of the new founding fathers.

1410
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:25,040
Sure.

1411
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:27,040
The people who instituted the purge.

1412
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:28,040
Right. Right. Right.

1413
01:07:28,040 --> 01:07:31,040
And yeah, he's very cocky, but I was going to watch.

1414
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:34,040
He loves to see all these people hurting each other.

1415
01:07:34,040 --> 01:07:35,040
Salivating.

1416
01:07:35,040 --> 01:07:36,040
Salivating.

1417
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:38,040
Yes. And he's a perfect villain.

1418
01:07:38,040 --> 01:07:43,040
It felt very like broad 80s action movie vibes, which I really enjoyed.

1419
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:44,040
Yes, absolutely.

1420
01:07:44,040 --> 01:07:45,040
It felt like that.

1421
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:53,040
And then, yeah, very quickly, the good guys of the piece, which are the I don't know the they're they're like have a group.

1422
01:07:53,040 --> 01:07:54,040
I forget if they have a name or not.

1423
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:57,040
But the persistence, the persistence.

1424
01:07:57,040 --> 01:07:59,040
I call them that the sisters.

1425
01:07:59,040 --> 01:08:00,040
Yeah.

1426
01:08:00,040 --> 01:08:01,040
Right. Yeah.

1427
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:02,040
Yeah.

1428
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:04,040
Well, you don't you don't know.

1429
01:08:04,040 --> 01:08:05,040
You don't know.

1430
01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:06,040
You don't know.

1431
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:08,040
There's a sister.

1432
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:13,040
There's a sister who is the baddie at the beginning.

1433
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:14,040
Yes.

1434
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:15,040
But she's good.

1435
01:08:15,040 --> 01:08:16,040
She's a good baddie.

1436
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:17,040
Oh, yeah.

1437
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:18,040
The Gal Friday one.

1438
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:19,040
Yeah.

1439
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:20,040
Yeah.

1440
01:08:20,040 --> 01:08:21,040
There's a turn that happens.

1441
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:22,040
So, yeah.

1442
01:08:22,040 --> 01:08:42,040
Then at that point, there's a helicopter noise and then shooting happens and then like pretty quickly, EDM starts blasting and water ski or excuse me, jet skis fly out the sides with neon on them and just start doing the normal jet ski tricks that you're allowed to do in a tiny space like this.

1443
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:45,040
Well, it's like they like cross each other and then turn around and cross each other.

1444
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:47,040
Yeah, they can't.

1445
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:50,040
There's a limited amount of things they can do for this.

1446
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:55,040
That's cool to synchronize even in a resistance murderous night situation.

1447
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:56,040
It looks neat.

1448
01:08:56,040 --> 01:08:58,040
That being said, it was very exciting when they flew out.

1449
01:08:58,040 --> 01:08:59,040
I got very excited.

1450
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:00,040
It was thrilling.

1451
01:09:00,040 --> 01:09:01,040
Thrilling.

1452
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:02,040
You guys also.

1453
01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:03,040
I don't know.

1454
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:11,040
Oh, I was going to say the interesting thing to me in this is it is all the major stunts.

1455
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:16,040
Of the Waterworld show intact in different contexts.

1456
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:17,040
Yeah, sure.

1457
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:25,040
But probably the thing you want the least for like stunt performers, a laser light show also going on.

1458
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:27,040
Not at the same time usually.

1459
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:31,040
Like people aren't doing giant falls while lasers are happening.

1460
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:35,040
But I just thought it was a very interesting combination of like.

1461
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:43,040
No one has to drop while a laser gets in their eye, which makes them stumble back the wrong way and fall not into the water.

1462
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:46,040
Because yeah, it is dangerous to do this stuff.

1463
01:09:46,040 --> 01:09:49,040
So yeah, if somebody got hit with a stray laser, that would probably be bad.

1464
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:51,040
Yeah, I was nervous for them.

1465
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:54,040
I was like, are these the same stunt performers as the Waterworld ones?

1466
01:09:54,040 --> 01:09:59,040
Or because I feel like it's like doing a different show on the same stage in a different order.

1467
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:01,040
Would you mix shit up?

1468
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:02,040
Yes.

1469
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:03,040
Oh, very good.

1470
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:04,040
Oh, sure.

1471
01:10:04,040 --> 01:10:06,040
If you've been doing it for 20 years.

1472
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:07,040
Yeah, yeah.

1473
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:08,040
Right.

1474
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:11,040
So they go to the wrong queue where they're like supposed to fight the Mariner.

1475
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:16,040
But you know, there's supposed to fight like the senators aides and then they're in the wrong spot.

1476
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:20,040
And then the whole show gets screwed up because of how many queues are probably locked into the soundtrack.

1477
01:10:20,040 --> 01:10:21,040
Yeah.

1478
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:23,040
Yeah. But no, that didn't seem to happen.

1479
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:24,040
At least they covered it if it didn't.

1480
01:10:24,040 --> 01:10:26,040
They covered it up nicely if it didn't.

1481
01:10:26,040 --> 01:10:27,040
Sure.

1482
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:38,040
I would say not to like back up to some like it just seemed to me from the video that an exciting moment is pre-story where just a bunch of lasers flash.

1483
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:42,040
Like that tells you what you're getting that you're getting into an EDM fueled stunt spectacular.

1484
01:10:42,040 --> 01:10:45,040
EDM fueled is a very good way to describe something.

1485
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:49,040
I would like to say it as much as I imagine the music fueling something.

1486
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:51,040
Music being a liquid.

1487
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:55,040
EDM should EDM could fuel cars in the future.

1488
01:10:55,040 --> 01:11:00,040
If you play EDM loud enough, we could combat climate change with EDM fuel.

1489
01:11:00,040 --> 01:11:04,040
EDM fueled mustard bubble gum.

1490
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:08,040
These are alternative energy sources.

1491
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:16,040
One moment though is that I you know, I saw that this existed and I saw a thumbnail of the video and I just watched the very beginning of it.

1492
01:11:16,040 --> 01:11:22,040
Not knowing we were going to be doing an episode and just from seeing the first 10 seconds where lasers flash and are redone.

1493
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:24,040
Water world stunt show.

1494
01:11:24,040 --> 01:11:28,040
My first reaction was, oh my God, this looks pretty dumb.

1495
01:11:28,040 --> 01:11:36,040
Then I talked to both of you, Mike and Jason and in separate interactions, you both said, oh my God, that looks so cool.

1496
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:39,040
Maybe just illustrates the difference.

1497
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:41,040
That's an aesthetic difference.

1498
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:42,040
Or maybe I'm maybe I'm too cynical.

1499
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:45,040
I might illustrate my too high of cynicism.

1500
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:47,040
Well, you know, fuel wasn't in me.

1501
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:51,040
Well, you hadn't gotten to the third giant element of the show.

1502
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:54,040
The many throat slashes.

1503
01:11:54,040 --> 01:11:55,040
Yeah, yeah.

1504
01:11:55,040 --> 01:11:56,040
Uh huh.

1505
01:11:56,040 --> 01:11:57,040
Yes.

1506
01:11:57,040 --> 01:11:58,040
Violence is hardcore.

1507
01:11:58,040 --> 01:11:59,040
That's for sure.

1508
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:01,040
I would say it's brutal bloodshed.

1509
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:03,040
It's like explosions of blood.

1510
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:04,040
Very funny.

1511
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:13,040
It's like very like mortal combat finishing moves like, you know, like a huge to be able to see a spray of blood at night in that big a stage from.

1512
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:14,040
Yeah.

1513
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:15,040
How close are you?

1514
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:16,040
We were in the we were far.

1515
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:17,040
The back row.

1516
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:19,040
Right next to the speakers that make the helicopter noise.

1517
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:21,040
Yes, we were.

1518
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:22,040
It was very.

1519
01:12:22,040 --> 01:12:23,040
Yeah, maybe.

1520
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:24,040
I hate to say it.

1521
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:25,040
Maybe a bit too loud.

1522
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:29,040
I don't I don't like admitting that to do she had a hard night.

1523
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:34,040
She no maybe a bit too loud, just a little.

1524
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:35,040
But I can handle it.

1525
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:36,040
I could I could handle it.

1526
01:12:36,040 --> 01:12:39,040
You know, we could go through the plot.

1527
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:48,040
But as you flash back to these horrible moments, Marissa, what is the one that like that one is like what would keep you up at night?

1528
01:12:48,040 --> 01:12:55,040
Truly like the amount of blood that like gushes forth and sprays like I was like, I can't believe they're doing this.

1529
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:58,040
Like I just didn't expect that at a theme park.

1530
01:12:58,040 --> 01:12:59,040
And I loved it.

1531
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:00,040
I'm like I'm on board for it.

1532
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:01,040
But it was shocking.

1533
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:02,040
So cartoonish.

1534
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:03,040
Yeah.

1535
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:04,040
Yeah.

1536
01:13:04,040 --> 01:13:08,040
And it's like it's there's like hoses hidden, I think, in my crates.

1537
01:13:08,040 --> 01:13:11,040
Oh, I couldn't tell where it was coming from in a video.

1538
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:12,040
I think that you really can't tell.

1539
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:17,040
Yeah, I think that's a guess because it just felt like there's no this is such like propulsion.

1540
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:20,040
It feels like there's no way it's in like a sleeve of a performer.

1541
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:22,040
It would blow their arm off.

1542
01:13:22,040 --> 01:13:23,040
It was like a hit.

1543
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:25,040
Didn't somebody's head get smashed?

1544
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:30,040
Yes, it was like like they laid their head down, like hit them with something like a wrench.

1545
01:13:30,040 --> 01:13:32,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1546
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:35,040
It was there's throats, heads.

1547
01:13:36,040 --> 01:13:43,040
There's a point where the senator, I think it's a senator, is like begging for his wife's life.

1548
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:46,040
And then they just go like, no, fuck her.

1549
01:13:46,040 --> 01:13:52,040
They kick her into a big barrel and then they like fire a gun into the barrel and it blows up.

1550
01:13:52,040 --> 01:13:53,040
Or it's like the aid.

1551
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:57,040
And then there's like the guy gets killed by his neck being sliced in another horror movie.

1552
01:13:57,040 --> 01:13:58,040
She's like blood spurt.

1553
01:13:58,040 --> 01:14:00,040
And you're like, this is insane.

1554
01:14:00,040 --> 01:14:03,040
This is so like cartoonishly over the top.

1555
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:07,040
Does it feel justified in the story from what you can tell?

1556
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:16,040
Well, in the in the like, yeah, I mean, that's the whole isn't that every purge were like the rich people are getting their comeuppance.

1557
01:14:16,040 --> 01:14:18,040
At one point they say this is not revenge.

1558
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:19,040
It's justice.

1559
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:20,040
Yeah, yeah.

1560
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:21,040
And it really resonated.

1561
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:23,040
Over.

1562
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:26,040
Like it really resonated.

1563
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:30,040
Which means it was really big because it was hard to resonate over that.

1564
01:14:30,040 --> 01:14:31,040
Of course.

1565
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:32,040
Yeah.

1566
01:14:32,040 --> 01:14:33,040
With such an aggressive beat.

1567
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:37,040
And yeah, it was just like it was.

1568
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:48,040
Yeah. Like Justin saying, like seeing an 80s action movie live, which yeah, I I thought, look, when I saw that this existed, I was just excited about the lights and the EDM.

1569
01:14:48,040 --> 01:14:51,040
I didn't know anything about the gore or the cartoonishness of it.

1570
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:52,040
That was an added.

1571
01:14:52,040 --> 01:14:56,040
I was going to use the stage and like not do as big a show.

1572
01:14:56,040 --> 01:14:58,040
And it was pretty significant.

1573
01:14:58,040 --> 01:15:01,040
Yeah, I feel like that's what they have universal.

1574
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:10,040
I think, you know, say what you will about the mazes versus other places and, you know, the kind of conventional scares that we sort of talked about sometimes happening.

1575
01:15:10,040 --> 01:15:15,040
I feel like nobody could do a show like that at any other theme park, but universal.

1576
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:17,040
So I was like, why haven't they done this?

1577
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:18,040
Yeah.

1578
01:15:18,040 --> 01:15:22,040
It's got like the high production value, like a high budget.

1579
01:15:22,040 --> 01:15:23,040
Yeah.

1580
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:27,040
With like being genuinely upsetting and kind of edgy.

1581
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:30,040
Yeah, that's I don't think you're going to see that.

1582
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:33,040
Not maybe you'll go edgy or budgets are lower.

1583
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:35,040
So it's an interesting blend for sure.

1584
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:37,040
Yeah, they really they did.

1585
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:42,040
I because I was trying to like rewatch like the old Miami Vice show and like this one.

1586
01:15:42,040 --> 01:15:45,040
And I didn't realize that they had done a horror nights thing before.

1587
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:46,040
Have you?

1588
01:15:46,040 --> 01:15:47,040
Oh, yeah.

1589
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:48,040
I know which slaughter world.

1590
01:15:48,040 --> 01:15:49,040
Oh, yeah.

1591
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:50,040
Yeah.

1592
01:15:50,040 --> 01:15:51,040
Two years.

1593
01:15:51,040 --> 01:15:52,040
Yeah.

1594
01:15:52,040 --> 01:15:53,040
Which looked even bloodier.

1595
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:54,040
Right.

1596
01:15:54,040 --> 01:15:55,040
Wow.

1597
01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:56,040
Wow.

1598
01:15:56,040 --> 01:15:57,040
Yeah, I couldn't.

1599
01:15:57,040 --> 01:15:58,040
I didn't watch a video to refresh my memory.

1600
01:15:58,040 --> 01:16:08,040
We definitely talked about that forever ago, but that's it's insane that this is the second iteration of and I guess you got a well, you know, you saw one live and maybe saw a video of the other.

1601
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:09,040
I don't know.

1602
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:11,040
I don't know how you if you had to compare them.

1603
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:15,040
Was there anything about slaughter world that seems superior?

1604
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:26,040
Yeah, I mean, I think the slaughter world kind of felt more akin to nots is like the hanging or like the Bill and Ted show maybe like a little bit more like provocative edge Lordy jokes.

1605
01:16:26,040 --> 01:16:27,040
Oh, yeah.

1606
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:28,040
Yeah.

1607
01:16:28,040 --> 01:16:32,040
The main attraction is that they might say, you know, shit.

1608
01:16:32,040 --> 01:16:33,040
Right.

1609
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:34,040
They'll they'll offend you.

1610
01:16:34,040 --> 01:16:41,040
If you're easily offended, then get out of this, you know, they'll be like a Dr. Phil joke, but it'll be like blue.

1611
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:42,040
Yes.

1612
01:16:42,040 --> 01:16:43,040
And I have more songs.

1613
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:46,040
I think it like there was like musical numbers in slaughter world.

1614
01:16:46,040 --> 01:16:53,040
I always seem to recall that there's sort of like a leather clad female equivalent of the who's the.

1615
01:16:53,040 --> 01:17:01,040
Yeah, we can talk about this and that the the entrance music on that big fan boat is nearly for Tato's Maneater.

1616
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:09,040
Oh, and there's like a like not only stunts, but like stunt like sex essentially like there's like a big like intense make out versus.

1617
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:19,040
This is scandalous film this like clearly filmed it a few times and they definitely had a punch in of like they knew that like there was going to be the steamy part in the front row.

1618
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:28,040
And it's just like they're they're going at each other's mouths with the level that only a stunt person can.

1619
01:17:28,040 --> 01:17:31,040
It would be safe for normal people to do that.

1620
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:33,040
No, absolutely not.

1621
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:45,040
I saw somebody on those WGA picket lines just you know to try to get you know drum up support for the WGA like that guy lit himself on fire who was a stunt person just making out with somebody really dangerous in a dangerous way.

1622
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:47,040
Teeth were all over their old head.

1623
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:49,040
Yeah, teeth were in trouble.

1624
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:51,040
If you didn't know what you were doing.

1625
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:53,040
Oh yeah, that was teeth on teeth.

1626
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:54,040
You don't know what you're doing.

1627
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:56,040
Yeah, that's a little sadder.

1628
01:17:56,040 --> 01:17:57,040
Two sets of teeth.

1629
01:17:57,040 --> 01:18:00,040
Try to do it like that.

1630
01:18:00,040 --> 01:18:11,040
What I think is interesting about this too is it feels like it's a normal theme park stunt show trope of like something's happening and then here comes some people like invaders.

1631
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:14,040
But generally it's like those are the bad guys.

1632
01:18:14,040 --> 01:18:18,040
So it's like usually like oh the Joker has shown up and now the fight happens.

1633
01:18:18,040 --> 01:18:26,040
But this is this version is the good guys of the story show up and are now just going to kill the people that were there first.

1634
01:18:26,040 --> 01:18:28,040
So like it's flipping the normal.

1635
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:29,040
It's colonization baby.

1636
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:30,040
Sure.

1637
01:18:30,040 --> 01:18:42,040
Well do you think that we are saying how this is the show is reflective of our times in a way and the notion of getting revenge against corrupt politicians.

1638
01:18:42,040 --> 01:18:48,040
Do you think like maybe the show a show like this couldn't have been done before the current era.

1639
01:18:48,040 --> 01:18:53,040
I would think that that's giving everyone a lot of credit and maybe they deserve it.

1640
01:18:53,040 --> 01:19:02,040
But I'm never I'm never sure exactly what the the universe creatives because the Bill and Ted isn't too far away as far as in our memories.

1641
01:19:02,040 --> 01:19:07,040
So yeah I guess I guess there's there's certainly politics in the show.

1642
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:08,040
I guess you can't avoid that.

1643
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:17,040
But it's tough to like we were saying before how like you kind of you know or you like the idea maybe of like getting ours against the crooked politician.

1644
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:26,040
But then the biggest scale version of this that we've seen in America I don't agree with the people who are climbing the Capitol Wall.

1645
01:19:26,040 --> 01:19:35,040
Yeah let's say so I if it's meant to if it's meant to be a January 6th analog I guess I don't like that.

1646
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:36,040
I don't think so.

1647
01:19:36,040 --> 01:19:39,040
I don't think the show is trying to convince us that they're the good guys.

1648
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:40,040
I don't think so.

1649
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:42,040
Cool.

1650
01:19:42,040 --> 01:19:47,040
The problem with you weren't rooting for the people because they weren't playing cool enough music.

1651
01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:48,040
Not enough lasers.

1652
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:51,040
They didn't bring lasers only zip ties.

1653
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:56,040
If the shaman had EDM blasting from a boombox everything would have been different I guess.

1654
01:19:56,040 --> 01:19:57,040
It would change his whole vibe.

1655
01:19:58,040 --> 01:20:03,040
I don't think this show was really giving any sort of nuance to things.

1656
01:20:03,040 --> 01:20:14,040
I think it was a it was a very simple idea and maybe deconstructing sort of January 6th and what exactly happened might have taken longer than 15 minutes.

1657
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:22,040
It seems pretty focused on purge based political specifics.

1658
01:20:22,040 --> 01:20:32,040
Yeah I think you need I think it's gonna have to at least be the length of the Aladdin show at Disney's California Adventure to really get into sort of the ins and outs of what was happening that day.

1659
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:34,040
Is that about 45 or?

1660
01:20:34,040 --> 01:20:35,040
45 yeah 45.

1661
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:37,040
45 in an hour.

1662
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:43,040
So you need your topical your genie character slot who can address like the current you know.

1663
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:47,040
Yeah he can poke fun at yeah of course he can poke fun at it he can ask questions.

1664
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:48,040
He can speak to both sides of the aisle.

1665
01:20:48,040 --> 01:20:49,040
Right right.

1666
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:54,040
It's a rare figure who can do that nowadays but the genie has got the magic.

1667
01:20:54,040 --> 01:21:01,040
And that year when Apple removed the headphone jack from the iPhone like the show got much longer you know.

1668
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:04,040
He had a lot of jokes about the headphone jack.

1669
01:21:04,040 --> 01:21:07,040
You mean the Aladdin show or the hypothetical show we're talking about?

1670
01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:09,040
The Aladdin show.

1671
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:10,040
The Aladdin show.

1672
01:21:10,040 --> 01:21:11,040
We were saying yeah.

1673
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:13,040
They had to add five minutes to that show yeah.

1674
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:14,040
Yeah yeah.

1675
01:21:14,040 --> 01:21:18,040
Yeah well and then yeah because they're not going to cut the Dr. Phil stuff.

1676
01:21:18,040 --> 01:21:20,040
No no.

1677
01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:26,040
But they had to get new props where he's trying to plug a regular headphone into like an iPhone.

1678
01:21:26,040 --> 01:21:28,040
Bringing the headphone jack.

1679
01:21:28,040 --> 01:21:29,040
Yeah.

1680
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:31,040
Snooki you can't lose Snooki.

1681
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:33,040
Was Snooki in the Slaughter World Show?

1682
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:35,040
I bet she was.

1683
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:42,040
I did honestly do some like fast forward like double tap like 10 seconds ahead.

1684
01:21:42,040 --> 01:21:44,040
I was like okay there's not a stunt.

1685
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:45,040
Go go dancing.

1686
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:46,040
No Snooki joke.

1687
01:21:46,040 --> 01:21:48,040
Fast forward fast forward.

1688
01:21:48,040 --> 01:21:54,040
Yeah so I was imagining like oh yeah this is where the Riddler would show up at the Six Flags.

1689
01:21:54,040 --> 01:21:56,040
And now it's sort of turned on its head.

1690
01:21:56,040 --> 01:22:00,040
But yeah they do all as Jason was saying it's like repurposed stunts.

1691
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:03,040
They use that like zip line kind of thing with a cage.

1692
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:07,040
So like get to platforms and the action's happening everywhere like right in front of us too.

1693
01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:10,040
So the blood cannons are everywhere.

1694
01:22:10,040 --> 01:22:14,040
Well I would say because there's like these like scaffolding kind of structures.

1695
01:22:14,040 --> 01:22:20,040
And there are some guys that just have some neon reflective you know goggles on.

1696
01:22:20,040 --> 01:22:22,040
And they're just climbing up and climbing down.

1697
01:22:22,040 --> 01:22:25,040
I think that's all they did was climb up and climb down like a lizard you know.

1698
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:27,040
And then they're like oh now I'll come down.

1699
01:22:27,040 --> 01:22:30,040
So I don't know if the guys closest to us were doing all that much.

1700
01:22:30,040 --> 01:22:32,040
But they added some ambiance.

1701
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:33,040
Yeah.

1702
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:34,040
There's lookouts maybe.

1703
01:22:34,040 --> 01:22:37,040
Yeah I think that was just to me like oh it's dangerous it's wild.

1704
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:39,040
Something happening everywhere.

1705
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:40,040
Every corner of the.

1706
01:22:40,040 --> 01:22:45,040
So there was like there was blood spray right by us somewhere.

1707
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:54,040
And I do wonder I wish there was like there wasn't like a media thing for not to where I think we could have toured some of like the behind the scenes.

1708
01:22:54,040 --> 01:22:55,040
I would have been very interested.

1709
01:22:55,040 --> 01:22:58,040
Where are you hiding the blood cannons?

1710
01:22:58,040 --> 01:23:00,040
I want to see the blood cannons during the day.

1711
01:23:00,040 --> 01:23:01,040
Could they shoot something else?

1712
01:23:01,040 --> 01:23:05,040
Maybe are they like shooting water on the like during the Waterworld show perhaps?

1713
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:07,040
Like I don't know the answers to these questions.

1714
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:08,040
These are just hypotheticals.

1715
01:23:08,040 --> 01:23:10,040
They're water hoses not blood hoses.

1716
01:23:10,040 --> 01:23:12,040
Right maybe there's a tank of water somewhere.

1717
01:23:12,040 --> 01:23:14,040
But they replace it with a tank of fake blood.

1718
01:23:14,040 --> 01:23:15,040
I love it.

1719
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:19,040
And they could replace it with a tank of bubblegum mustard for another show.

1720
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:23,040
Well I was going to say they just dump a packet of the kool-aid of the mustard.

1721
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:25,040
Oh yeah maybe.

1722
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:26,040
The pickle kool-aid.

1723
01:23:26,040 --> 01:23:30,040
This is when this type of hot dog really takes off coast to coast.

1724
01:23:30,040 --> 01:23:34,040
And then they then a new show becomes like you know it's.

1725
01:23:34,040 --> 01:23:37,040
Wait what was the what was the evil character?

1726
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:38,040
There's a doctor.

1727
01:23:38,040 --> 01:23:39,040
Oh Dr. Oddfellow.

1728
01:23:39,040 --> 01:23:42,040
Yeah all right Dr. Oddfellow's giant hot dog factory.

1729
01:23:42,040 --> 01:23:43,040
Oh man.

1730
01:23:43,040 --> 01:23:47,040
They use all the what that you still have the water tank but it's dirty hot dog water.

1731
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:48,040
Yeah.

1732
01:23:48,040 --> 01:23:52,040
And they send giant hot dogs sailing past kool-aid.

1733
01:23:52,040 --> 01:23:54,040
Starring Jason.

1734
01:23:54,040 --> 01:23:56,040
Yeah yeah yes and he's Dr. Oddfellow.

1735
01:23:56,040 --> 01:23:58,040
Yeah it could be a non-horror character just like.

1736
01:23:58,040 --> 01:24:00,040
Yeah there's nothing scary about it.

1737
01:24:00,040 --> 01:24:02,040
Hello.

1738
01:24:02,040 --> 01:24:03,040
Dr. Weiner.

1739
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:04,040
Dr. Weiner.

1740
01:24:04,040 --> 01:24:10,040
And then enjoy the last room chocolate covered starfish.

1741
01:24:10,040 --> 01:24:12,040
Oh my god.

1742
01:24:12,040 --> 01:24:13,040
There's a room too.

1743
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:16,040
Yeah well that's the room at the end they launch a.

1744
01:24:16,040 --> 01:24:19,040
You do the show then you walk into a tiny room.

1745
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:20,040
Yeah.

1746
01:24:20,040 --> 01:24:21,040
And that's where the water is.

1747
01:24:21,040 --> 01:24:22,040
Yeah yeah.

1748
01:24:22,040 --> 01:24:23,040
Yeah and there's a plush pile in there.

1749
01:24:23,040 --> 01:24:26,040
Not the one you think.

1750
01:24:26,040 --> 01:24:28,040
Which one are you thinking?

1751
01:24:28,040 --> 01:24:29,040
Matt it's up to you.

1752
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:30,040
Further questions.

1753
01:24:30,040 --> 01:24:37,040
The end of the show is particularly I don't know it's not crazier but it just feels a

1754
01:24:37,040 --> 01:24:42,040
little crazier because it's like they finally have the senator cornered that twist which

1755
01:24:42,040 --> 01:24:48,040
all the advisor is actually the sister of one of the resistance people and the senators

1756
01:24:48,040 --> 01:24:52,040
begging for his life he's trying to make a deal there at like the highest part of the

1757
01:24:52,040 --> 01:24:54,040
sets I don't know if you guys saw this.

1758
01:24:54,040 --> 01:24:55,040
Yeah.

1759
01:24:55,040 --> 01:24:59,040
The highest part of the set and essentially what just happens is they say yeah this is

1760
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:05,040
not revenge this is justice and they set the man on fire and shoot him into the water

1761
01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:06,040
and as soon as.

1762
01:25:06,040 --> 01:25:07,040
Marissa's eyes are wide.

1763
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:08,040
Yeah.

1764
01:25:08,040 --> 01:25:14,040
And as soon as he hits the water EDM dance party starts and it is like the end of the

1765
01:25:14,040 --> 01:25:19,040
Criss Angel show where he has the rave to stop pediatric cancer.

1766
01:25:19,040 --> 01:25:20,040
Wow.

1767
01:25:20,040 --> 01:25:24,040
It felt exactly the same thing only this time now they're celebrating that a man fell from

1768
01:25:24,040 --> 01:25:26,040
a very high height while on fire.

1769
01:25:26,040 --> 01:25:27,040
We killed a man.

1770
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:33,040
We killed a man via falling and a flamethrower and it's am I crazy or does the in the regular

1771
01:25:33,040 --> 01:25:39,040
Waterworld show does does not someone just emerge on fire as opposed to another actor

1772
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:45,040
has to blast the flamethrower and hit and it's like aimed at their face and their face is

1773
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:48,040
just clearly like their face is liquid it up.

1774
01:25:48,040 --> 01:25:49,040
Yeah.

1775
01:25:49,040 --> 01:25:53,040
Like the flame return stuff but that's a nuts level of coordination.

1776
01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:56,040
Regular Waterworld I think they just shoot a flare gun.

1777
01:25:56,040 --> 01:25:57,040
OK.

1778
01:25:57,040 --> 01:26:03,040
I feel like the the deacon who's clearly wearing a mask and it's covered in goo.

1779
01:26:03,040 --> 01:26:04,040
But this guy's not wearing a mask.

1780
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:05,040
It's just a regular guy's face.

1781
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:11,040
It's a regular guy and then someone's up there with the flamethrower like dancing.

1782
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:13,040
And I applaud it.

1783
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:16,040
Like I truly and I don't know what that says about me.

1784
01:26:16,040 --> 01:26:18,040
I feel like there are multiple moments where I went yeah.

1785
01:26:18,040 --> 01:26:22,040
Like you didn't know what was happening as you were clapping.

1786
01:26:22,040 --> 01:26:26,040
We all celebrated like like our kid had won a soccer game.

1787
01:26:26,040 --> 01:26:31,040
So excited for just the absurd moment to have happened.

1788
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:39,040
And then just that it was a mix of the crazy looking stunt and then the dance party that is immediate.

1789
01:26:39,040 --> 01:26:40,040
Everyone dances.

1790
01:26:40,040 --> 01:26:43,040
Everyone is dancing while the EDM plays.

1791
01:26:43,040 --> 01:26:44,040
And that's it.

1792
01:26:44,040 --> 01:26:46,040
That's the end of the show.

1793
01:26:46,040 --> 01:26:50,040
The lights come up and they send you on your way.

1794
01:26:50,040 --> 01:26:53,040
And you have to figure out which way to go because there are multiple ways to go.

1795
01:26:53,040 --> 01:26:55,040
And I was like which way is the exit.

1796
01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:56,040
Yes.

1797
01:26:56,040 --> 01:27:02,040
And if this show was packed like it's all like the Water World show is still packed because that's why it's still going on.

1798
01:27:02,040 --> 01:27:03,040
It seems ridiculous.

1799
01:27:03,040 --> 01:27:07,040
But they're building new Water World shows across the globe.

1800
01:27:07,040 --> 01:27:09,040
New tributes to Atolls.

1801
01:27:09,040 --> 01:27:10,040
Yeah.

1802
01:27:10,040 --> 01:27:11,040
Yeah.

1803
01:27:11,040 --> 01:27:13,040
There's been no ones in the last three years.

1804
01:27:13,040 --> 01:27:14,040
Are you kidding me?

1805
01:27:14,040 --> 01:27:17,040
Universal Beijing has a whole land with it.

1806
01:27:17,040 --> 01:27:18,040
It expanded.

1807
01:27:18,040 --> 01:27:19,040
The show is so popular.

1808
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:20,040
Yeah.

1809
01:27:20,040 --> 01:27:21,040
Oh yeah.

1810
01:27:21,040 --> 01:27:22,040
It's such a popular show.

1811
01:27:22,040 --> 01:27:23,040
Not movie show.

1812
01:27:23,040 --> 01:27:29,040
I remember seeing it in the theater and being horrified because I was a child and I was like oh no is water going to be an issue.

1813
01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:31,040
It was just so scary.

1814
01:27:31,040 --> 01:27:32,040
Yeah I know.

1815
01:27:32,040 --> 01:27:35,040
You're a guilt person or whatever.

1816
01:27:35,040 --> 01:27:42,040
But yeah the place was packed even more packed I feel like than a normal Water World show maybe.

1817
01:27:42,040 --> 01:27:45,040
It's the only time I ever wanted to see a show at Horror Nights though.

1818
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:48,040
I think every other time it's like what like Jabberwockies or.

1819
01:27:48,040 --> 01:27:49,040
Yeah.

1820
01:27:49,040 --> 01:27:52,040
I was like why aren't you just doing the Beetlejuice show again.

1821
01:27:52,040 --> 01:27:53,040
Just do that.

1822
01:27:53,040 --> 01:27:54,040
Yeah.

1823
01:27:54,040 --> 01:27:55,040
I know.

1824
01:27:55,040 --> 01:28:00,040
Well get everybody in the theater groping and touching each other's dicks over the pants.

1825
01:28:00,040 --> 01:28:02,040
Getting all Bobert.

1826
01:28:02,040 --> 01:28:05,040
The hornyest show in entertainment.

1827
01:28:05,040 --> 01:28:06,040
Oh yeah.

1828
01:28:06,040 --> 01:28:09,040
Genie would be talking about Bobert.

1829
01:28:09,040 --> 01:28:13,040
Do you think Genie would be booed by the current California adventure crowd.

1830
01:28:13,040 --> 01:28:14,040
For his half of it.

1831
01:28:14,040 --> 01:28:15,040
For a Bobert.

1832
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:16,040
Yeah.

1833
01:28:16,040 --> 01:28:17,040
I don't know.

1834
01:28:17,040 --> 01:28:18,040
I don't think she's.

1835
01:28:18,040 --> 01:28:19,040
Genie is pretty.

1836
01:28:19,040 --> 01:28:20,040
Much beloved.

1837
01:28:20,040 --> 01:28:23,040
Genie is a very Leno sort of type where he's going to go after all sides.

1838
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:27,040
So I feel like they can appreciate that about Genie is that he's not he's not political.

1839
01:28:27,040 --> 01:28:29,040
He's just in it for the jokes.

1840
01:28:29,040 --> 01:28:31,040
So I think that he wouldn't get booed.

1841
01:28:31,040 --> 01:28:32,040
But I could be wrong.

1842
01:28:32,040 --> 01:28:35,040
And then it'll hit him with a Gavin Newsome French joke.

1843
01:28:35,040 --> 01:28:36,040
That's Jay's philosophy.

1844
01:28:36,040 --> 01:28:39,040
He would do a Bobert then a French laundry and then everybody's happy.

1845
01:28:39,040 --> 01:28:40,040
Yeah.

1846
01:28:40,040 --> 01:28:41,040
Yeah.

1847
01:28:41,040 --> 01:28:42,040
And Genie is very much a populist like that.

1848
01:28:42,040 --> 01:28:45,040
I also just want to say I think it's crazy that they would depict a senator getting lit

1849
01:28:45,040 --> 01:28:50,040
on fire and then falling to their death because I don't know if you saw the full autopsy the

1850
01:28:50,040 --> 01:28:53,040
death report but that's how Dianne Feinstein died.

1851
01:28:53,040 --> 01:28:54,040
And she was back in.

1852
01:28:54,040 --> 01:28:55,040
Oh thank you.

1853
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:56,040
And then she was like.

1854
01:28:56,040 --> 01:28:57,040
Oh yeah.

1855
01:28:57,040 --> 01:28:58,040
And then she was like.

1856
01:28:58,040 --> 01:28:59,040
Oh yeah.

1857
01:28:59,040 --> 01:29:00,040
And then she was like.

1858
01:29:00,040 --> 01:29:01,040
Oh yeah.

1859
01:29:01,040 --> 01:29:02,040
And then she was like.

1860
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:03,040
Oh yeah.

1861
01:29:03,040 --> 01:29:04,040
And then she was like.

1862
01:29:04,040 --> 01:29:07,040
I'm going to go back in office the next day.

1863
01:29:07,040 --> 01:29:08,040
All right.

1864
01:29:08,040 --> 01:29:09,040
We still got enough here.

1865
01:29:09,040 --> 01:29:10,040
Charged remains.

1866
01:29:10,040 --> 01:29:11,040
Put in the chair.

1867
01:29:11,040 --> 01:29:13,040
Seems insensitive.

1868
01:29:13,040 --> 01:29:16,040
I did not know that.

1869
01:29:16,040 --> 01:29:19,040
You would assume old age but once the full of the report came out.

1870
01:29:19,040 --> 01:29:20,040
I didn't know.

1871
01:29:20,040 --> 01:29:21,040
The Waterworld report came out.

1872
01:29:21,040 --> 01:29:22,040
Waterworld scandal.

1873
01:29:22,040 --> 01:29:24,040
It was at the Waterworld show too.

1874
01:29:24,040 --> 01:29:26,040
But unrelated to the show.

1875
01:29:26,040 --> 01:29:27,040
She was just attending.

1876
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:29,040
Well that's where her office is.

1877
01:29:29,040 --> 01:29:30,040
At the top of the.

1878
01:29:30,040 --> 01:29:31,040
At the top yeah.

1879
01:29:31,040 --> 01:29:33,040
Honestly on that big plane.

1880
01:29:33,040 --> 01:29:34,040
If you could have.

1881
01:29:34,040 --> 01:29:35,040
She's from California.

1882
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:36,040
That's right.

1883
01:29:36,040 --> 01:29:39,040
If you could pick an office anywhere for sure you'd be there.

1884
01:29:39,040 --> 01:29:40,040
Actually having the.

1885
01:29:40,040 --> 01:29:43,040
The death so close to the.

1886
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:45,040
A big dance party.

1887
01:29:45,040 --> 01:29:49,040
Maybe that is like how the January 6th people thought it would go.

1888
01:29:49,040 --> 01:29:50,040
Probably.

1889
01:29:50,040 --> 01:29:51,040
I bet that is true.

1890
01:29:51,040 --> 01:29:53,040
So we'll light Mike Pence on fire.

1891
01:29:53,040 --> 01:29:55,040
Make him walk off the top of the Capitol building.

1892
01:29:55,040 --> 01:29:56,040
And then we'll all.

1893
01:29:56,040 --> 01:30:00,040
Everyone agrees the cops start high fiving us.

1894
01:30:00,040 --> 01:30:02,040
Did you just say are you humming all your songs?

1895
01:30:02,040 --> 01:30:03,040
I was just thinking.

1896
01:30:03,040 --> 01:30:05,040
Are you humming y'all ready for this?

1897
01:30:05,040 --> 01:30:06,040
Yeah.

1898
01:30:06,040 --> 01:30:07,040
Well is it not.

1899
01:30:07,040 --> 01:30:10,040
Has the music progressed that much further than y'all ready for this?

1900
01:30:10,040 --> 01:30:11,040
Not so much.

1901
01:30:11,040 --> 01:30:14,040
I was just thinking it was an interesting choice.

1902
01:30:14,040 --> 01:30:15,040
Yeah.

1903
01:30:15,040 --> 01:30:16,040
No it had more of it.

1904
01:30:16,040 --> 01:30:17,040
It was slightly.

1905
01:30:17,040 --> 01:30:19,040
It was more of a.

1906
01:30:19,040 --> 01:30:20,040
It was more.

1907
01:30:20,040 --> 01:30:21,040
It was more.

1908
01:30:21,040 --> 01:30:22,040
It sounded like yeah.

1909
01:30:22,040 --> 01:30:25,040
It was a dubstep break in the y'all ready for this.

1910
01:30:25,040 --> 01:30:26,040
Yeah.

1911
01:30:26,040 --> 01:30:27,040
For sure.

1912
01:30:27,040 --> 01:30:28,040
It was a newer version of it.

1913
01:30:28,040 --> 01:30:29,040
I guarantee some.

1914
01:30:29,040 --> 01:30:34,040
I think the most interesting theme park on this planet in the last 24 hours y'all ready for this has played somewhere.

1915
01:30:34,040 --> 01:30:35,040
Oh I'm sure.

1916
01:30:35,040 --> 01:30:36,040
Yeah I would think so.

1917
01:30:36,040 --> 01:30:37,040
Yeah.

1918
01:30:37,040 --> 01:30:45,040
There was a video of Michael Jordan on vacation somewhere and somebody played the intro song for the Bulls while he was there and everyone's going nuts.

1919
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:46,040
And I was like yeah.

1920
01:30:46,040 --> 01:30:47,040
What did he think?

1921
01:30:47,040 --> 01:30:48,040
Was he annoyed by it?

1922
01:30:48,040 --> 01:30:50,040
No he seemed like he was having a great time.

1923
01:30:50,040 --> 01:30:51,040
Thank God.

1924
01:30:51,040 --> 01:30:52,040
Yeah.

1925
01:30:52,040 --> 01:30:53,040
You do not want to get on his bad side.

1926
01:30:53,040 --> 01:30:54,040
Oh yeah.

1927
01:30:54,040 --> 01:30:55,040
You don't want it to be.

1928
01:30:55,040 --> 01:30:58,040
He's watching an iPad later and thinking about you.

1929
01:30:58,040 --> 01:31:02,040
I was upset with his optimism and I heard there's a DJ there and I took offense to that.

1930
01:31:02,040 --> 01:31:04,040
I was upset with him.

1931
01:31:04,040 --> 01:31:09,040
With his drink level constantly going up and down between shots.

1932
01:31:09,040 --> 01:31:10,040
Sure.

1933
01:31:10,040 --> 01:31:11,040
Yeah.

1934
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:12,040
He seemed happy.

1935
01:31:12,040 --> 01:31:13,040
He didn't get up or anything.

1936
01:31:13,040 --> 01:31:16,040
So he didn't come leave to enter again as they play the music.

1937
01:31:16,040 --> 01:31:21,040
It would have been great if he did the whole thing and had the Jersey Superman maybe.

1938
01:31:21,040 --> 01:31:23,040
He's always got it on underneath.

1939
01:31:23,040 --> 01:31:24,040
Because he would like to still be playing.

1940
01:31:24,040 --> 01:31:25,040
So yeah.

1941
01:31:25,040 --> 01:31:26,040
No it didn't.

1942
01:31:26,040 --> 01:31:27,040
I was like yeah.

1943
01:31:27,040 --> 01:31:28,040
I like giving one of these.

1944
01:31:28,040 --> 01:31:29,040
Wow.

1945
01:31:29,040 --> 01:31:30,040
Which I like.

1946
01:31:30,040 --> 01:31:31,040
Yeah good.

1947
01:31:31,040 --> 01:31:32,040
So anyway.

1948
01:31:32,040 --> 01:31:33,040
So that's the show.

1949
01:31:33,040 --> 01:31:34,040
It's a simple show.

1950
01:31:34,040 --> 01:31:35,040
Yeah.

1951
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:36,040
But a very.

1952
01:31:36,040 --> 01:31:40,040
It's a simple show about simple people with laser capes.

1953
01:31:40,040 --> 01:31:41,040
Laser mohawks.

1954
01:31:41,040 --> 01:31:42,040
Home spun.

1955
01:31:42,040 --> 01:31:43,040
Alright.

1956
01:31:43,040 --> 01:31:44,040
He's running.

1957
01:31:44,040 --> 01:31:45,040
Mike's running.

1958
01:31:45,040 --> 01:31:53,040
But yeah definitely the highlight of Fortnite this year for me.

1959
01:31:53,040 --> 01:31:54,040
Yeah.

1960
01:31:54,040 --> 01:31:55,040
You guys too?

1961
01:31:55,040 --> 01:31:57,040
Yeah I think it was like definitely tops.

1962
01:31:57,040 --> 01:31:58,040
I mean that.

1963
01:31:58,040 --> 01:31:59,040
Chuckie.

1964
01:31:59,040 --> 01:32:00,040
Monstros.

1965
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:01,040
All that stuff.

1966
01:32:01,040 --> 01:32:03,040
But I feel like it's something you can't get anywhere else.

1967
01:32:03,040 --> 01:32:04,040
Yeah.

1968
01:32:04,040 --> 01:32:05,040
Yes.

1969
01:32:05,040 --> 01:32:06,040
And yeah with budget wise.

1970
01:32:06,040 --> 01:32:08,040
Obviously there's grosser things.

1971
01:32:08,040 --> 01:32:11,040
There's fetus stuff that you can go do somewhere.

1972
01:32:11,040 --> 01:32:12,040
But that's for.

1973
01:32:12,040 --> 01:32:14,040
That's a different budget level.

1974
01:32:14,040 --> 01:32:17,040
You're not getting a high budget Waterworld show where they're throwing.

1975
01:32:17,040 --> 01:32:18,040
It's an emotional budget.

1976
01:32:18,040 --> 01:32:19,040
Yeah.

1977
01:32:19,040 --> 01:32:21,040
You need a high emotional budget to be touching by a fetal pig.

1978
01:32:21,040 --> 01:32:23,040
I don't think we had the emotional budget for that.

1979
01:32:23,040 --> 01:32:24,040
Right.

1980
01:32:24,040 --> 01:32:25,040
I don't think we had that.

1981
01:32:25,040 --> 01:32:26,040
But this is the.

1982
01:32:26,040 --> 01:32:31,040
This has got to be the highest budget gore show that exists in like a theme park.

1983
01:32:31,040 --> 01:32:32,040
Yeah.

1984
01:32:32,040 --> 01:32:33,040
I would think.

1985
01:32:33,040 --> 01:32:34,040
Maybe.

1986
01:32:34,040 --> 01:32:36,040
I don't know what's going on in Orlando but I bet you're right.

1987
01:32:36,040 --> 01:32:37,040
Yeah.

1988
01:32:37,040 --> 01:32:38,040
Maybe because it's like scale.

1989
01:32:38,040 --> 01:32:39,040
Yeah.

1990
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:41,040
I feel like we touched on it briefly but now I'm not going to know the name.

1991
01:32:41,040 --> 01:32:43,040
In Orlando there's the show.

1992
01:32:43,040 --> 01:32:46,040
Are like commenters bringing it up.

1993
01:32:46,040 --> 01:32:47,040
Oh nightmare fuel.

1994
01:32:47,040 --> 01:32:52,040
I feel like we need to go deeper in the night because that might be the bodyist.

1995
01:32:52,040 --> 01:32:54,040
I think that's the body or yeah.

1996
01:32:54,040 --> 01:32:56,040
This is more of an action show.

1997
01:32:56,040 --> 01:32:57,040
Yeah.

1998
01:32:57,040 --> 01:32:59,040
And that's more of the like topical material show.

1999
01:32:59,040 --> 01:33:00,040
I think.

2000
01:33:00,040 --> 01:33:03,040
Or is it just more about sexy dancing.

2001
01:33:03,040 --> 01:33:05,040
Women flipping their hair back.

2002
01:33:05,040 --> 01:33:07,040
There's some of that as well.

2003
01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:08,040
Can you imagine in a theme park?

2004
01:33:08,040 --> 01:33:09,040
Yeah.

2005
01:33:09,040 --> 01:33:11,040
I can't and I don't want to.

2006
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:12,040
And I will not.

2007
01:33:12,040 --> 01:33:16,040
But is there any plus ups can we think.

2008
01:33:16,040 --> 01:33:18,040
Like is there any way to make the show better.

2009
01:33:18,040 --> 01:33:20,040
Is there any improvement.

2010
01:33:20,040 --> 01:33:22,040
I mean more longer.

2011
01:33:22,040 --> 01:33:25,040
I mean let's bring the plane into the show.

2012
01:33:25,040 --> 01:33:26,040
Yeah we have.

2013
01:33:26,040 --> 01:33:27,040
Yes.

2014
01:33:27,040 --> 01:33:28,040
How would you decorate it though.

2015
01:33:28,040 --> 01:33:29,040
Yeah.

2016
01:33:29,040 --> 01:33:30,040
It's got to have like crazy like neon piping.

2017
01:33:30,040 --> 01:33:31,040
Yeah.

2018
01:33:31,040 --> 01:33:32,040
You could put some neon piping.

2019
01:33:32,040 --> 01:33:35,040
Maybe like a tasteful bikini.

2020
01:33:35,040 --> 01:33:36,040
What.

2021
01:33:36,040 --> 01:33:38,040
A tasteful plane sized bikini.

2022
01:33:38,040 --> 01:33:40,040
Oh the plane is wearing a bathing suit.

2023
01:33:40,040 --> 01:33:41,040
Yeah.

2024
01:33:41,040 --> 01:33:42,040
Oh.

2025
01:33:42,040 --> 01:33:43,040
Wait wait.

2026
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:45,040
Like a neon bikini.

2027
01:33:45,040 --> 01:33:48,040
So will the plane have like eyelashes painted on the like windshield.

2028
01:33:48,040 --> 01:33:49,040
No don't be ridiculous.

2029
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:55,040
So the plane is not an anthropomorphic plane that you're attracted to.

2030
01:33:55,040 --> 01:33:57,040
It's just a bikini plane.

2031
01:33:57,040 --> 01:33:58,040
Yeah.

2032
01:33:58,040 --> 01:33:59,040
This is the purge.

2033
01:33:59,040 --> 01:34:00,040
Anything's legal.

2034
01:34:00,040 --> 01:34:01,040
Even a bikini plane.

2035
01:34:01,040 --> 01:34:02,040
Yeah I mean it could be.

2036
01:34:02,040 --> 01:34:03,040
So the plane.

2037
01:34:03,040 --> 01:34:07,040
I guess I guess with the purge you could put some eyelashes.

2038
01:34:07,040 --> 01:34:08,040
Hold on.

2039
01:34:08,040 --> 01:34:09,040
Hold on here.

2040
01:34:09,040 --> 01:34:14,040
Hold on everyone hold on.

2041
01:34:14,040 --> 01:34:21,040
If you make it too anthropomorphic you get into planes fire and rescue territory.

2042
01:34:21,040 --> 01:34:24,040
Well I'm just feeling out the idea you've thrown out here.

2043
01:34:24,040 --> 01:34:27,040
Is the plane like a purger plane.

2044
01:34:27,040 --> 01:34:32,040
Like have they dressed up the plane for fun or is the plane coming to rescue them.

2045
01:34:32,040 --> 01:34:33,040
And the plane is also.

2046
01:34:33,040 --> 01:34:34,040
The plane alive is what you're asking.

2047
01:34:34,040 --> 01:34:35,040
That's what I'm asking.

2048
01:34:35,040 --> 01:34:42,040
I think well maybe the plane has like the neon mask for the movies with like the neon

2049
01:34:42,040 --> 01:34:43,040
masks and stuff.

2050
01:34:43,040 --> 01:34:44,040
Yeah.

2051
01:34:44,040 --> 01:34:47,040
And then it also has like a bikini.

2052
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:48,040
Or chaps.

2053
01:34:48,040 --> 01:34:49,040
Where?

2054
01:34:49,040 --> 01:34:52,040
What is the part of the plane?

2055
01:34:52,040 --> 01:34:55,040
Hanging off the wings or the tail.

2056
01:34:55,040 --> 01:34:56,040
Wings?

2057
01:34:56,040 --> 01:34:59,040
Oh I guess there are wings on the plane.

2058
01:34:59,040 --> 01:35:02,040
I was imagining a helicopter.

2059
01:35:02,040 --> 01:35:03,040
Yeah yeah yeah.

2060
01:35:03,040 --> 01:35:04,040
It's a sea plane.

2061
01:35:04,040 --> 01:35:09,040
Okay I hate to ask this and I don't want to be so.

2062
01:35:09,040 --> 01:35:13,040
Is the landing gear the bosom of the plane?

2063
01:35:13,040 --> 01:35:15,040
Is that where the bikini would be on?

2064
01:35:15,040 --> 01:35:16,040
Or is it upside down?

2065
01:35:16,040 --> 01:35:18,040
Or is it upside down?

2066
01:35:18,040 --> 01:35:19,040
The bosom's on top.

2067
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:21,040
Is the bosom on top of the plane?

2068
01:35:21,040 --> 01:35:25,040
I mean this is something for Universal Creative to work on.

2069
01:35:25,040 --> 01:35:26,040
Oh you don't want to decide.

2070
01:35:26,040 --> 01:35:29,040
No no this isn't my call you know.

2071
01:35:29,040 --> 01:35:32,040
Well okay Jason doesn't want to put.

2072
01:35:32,040 --> 01:35:33,040
I think it's a living plane.

2073
01:35:33,040 --> 01:35:38,040
That would be fun for me I think as if now Purge has planes that are alive and can feel

2074
01:35:38,040 --> 01:35:42,040
and can land after the Senator's death and say hey guys let's party.

2075
01:35:42,040 --> 01:35:43,040
Let's party.

2076
01:35:43,040 --> 01:35:49,040
The plane is almost like Rodney Dangerfield in Caddyshack or something where it's just

2077
01:35:49,040 --> 01:35:50,040
like hey come here.

2078
01:35:50,040 --> 01:35:55,040
Or like back to school because Rodney does a big dive at the end.

2079
01:35:55,040 --> 01:35:58,040
That's the most current reference I could have made for a character that shows up that

2080
01:35:58,040 --> 01:35:59,040
wants to party.

2081
01:35:59,040 --> 01:36:02,040
Wants to party 50 years ago when there was a movie.

2082
01:36:02,040 --> 01:36:05,040
I mean it kind of tracks with the music that was playing at the Purge.

2083
01:36:05,040 --> 01:36:06,040
Very true yeah.

2084
01:36:06,040 --> 01:36:08,040
It wasn't Kenny Loggins playing after the.

2085
01:36:08,040 --> 01:36:10,040
Oh that's a good plus up.

2086
01:36:10,040 --> 01:36:12,040
Maybe one Kenny Loggins song.

2087
01:36:12,040 --> 01:36:15,040
EDM Kenny Loggins and EDM I'm Alright.

2088
01:36:15,040 --> 01:36:21,040
Hey everybody we're going to get laid as somebody says at the end and then Kenny Loggins I'm

2089
01:36:21,040 --> 01:36:24,040
Alright plays at the end of a Purge stunt show.

2090
01:36:24,040 --> 01:36:25,040
It's an evil caddyshack.

2091
01:36:25,040 --> 01:36:26,040
Slaughter shack.

2092
01:36:26,040 --> 01:36:27,040
Slaughter shack.

2093
01:36:27,040 --> 01:36:28,040
Who owns it?

2094
01:36:28,040 --> 01:36:29,040
Does Universal own it?

2095
01:36:29,040 --> 01:36:30,040
Don't remember.

2096
01:36:30,040 --> 01:36:31,040
I don't know.

2097
01:36:31,040 --> 01:36:33,040
Jason can you help us out here?

2098
01:36:33,040 --> 01:36:34,040
Who owns Caddyshack?

2099
01:36:34,040 --> 01:36:35,040
Yeah.

2100
01:36:35,040 --> 01:36:37,040
Very important we look this up.

2101
01:36:37,040 --> 01:36:42,040
Any other ideas plus wise or things you'd want to see even in the Waterworld show like

2102
01:36:42,040 --> 01:36:47,040
a different property or something that you could do a kind of gory show.

2103
01:36:47,040 --> 01:36:50,040
What are your favorite horror movies?

2104
01:36:50,040 --> 01:36:53,040
I love The Thing.

2105
01:36:53,040 --> 01:36:54,040
Sure.

2106
01:36:54,040 --> 01:36:55,040
John Carpenter's The Thing.

2107
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:56,040
That would be a great maze.

2108
01:36:56,040 --> 01:37:01,040
Yeah I think they did it in 2011 when they were like the requel kind of one.

2109
01:37:01,040 --> 01:37:04,040
I was too afraid to go to Haunts at that point.

2110
01:37:04,040 --> 01:37:05,040
Oh yeah that's a good idea.

2111
01:37:05,040 --> 01:37:09,040
But I've watched a video and I've been like damn I wish I wasn't afraid when that happened.

2112
01:37:09,040 --> 01:37:16,040
I wish I could have somebody in their words neg me into Someday.

2113
01:37:16,040 --> 01:37:21,040
I'd love to bring Jaws into that area right that kind of makes sense.

2114
01:37:21,040 --> 01:37:23,040
I know we've got Jaws on a lot.

2115
01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:28,040
Oh but a live Jaws show where a Jaws is puffing up.

2116
01:37:28,040 --> 01:37:29,040
Yeah.

2117
01:37:29,040 --> 01:37:32,040
Maybe eating people and blood is spraying out of its mouth or something.

2118
01:37:32,040 --> 01:37:33,040
Yeah.

2119
01:37:33,040 --> 01:37:37,040
How would you do the stunts that have to happen like above?

2120
01:37:37,040 --> 01:37:44,040
Well in Jaws 2 there is a scene where there's a rescue copter that comes and Jaws jumps

2121
01:37:44,040 --> 01:37:46,040
and like bites onto it and drags it down.

2122
01:37:46,040 --> 01:37:50,040
So I'd love to see that recreated in front of an audience.

2123
01:37:50,040 --> 01:37:58,040
And Jaws 3 is in the sea world so you have justified water skiers and water skier towers

2124
01:37:58,040 --> 01:37:59,040
and stuff that's already ready to go.

2125
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:05,040
And at the end you dress the plane up like a giant shark with a bikini on.

2126
01:38:05,040 --> 01:38:06,040
With a bikini.

2127
01:38:06,040 --> 01:38:09,040
I don't know which side is which.

2128
01:38:09,040 --> 01:38:11,040
That's for Universal to decide.

2129
01:38:11,040 --> 01:38:18,040
Well my good news Caddyshack was released by Warner Brothers and Universal already has

2130
01:38:18,040 --> 01:38:24,040
with the Harry Potter deal a co-theme park deal with Warner Brothers.

2131
01:38:24,040 --> 01:38:26,040
You're saying that's going to be no problem legally.

2132
01:38:26,040 --> 01:38:28,040
So I'm saying they'll get Caddyshack in there.

2133
01:38:28,040 --> 01:38:29,040
Good news.

2134
01:38:29,040 --> 01:38:30,040
This is good news.

2135
01:38:30,040 --> 01:38:37,040
So as long as the Doug Kenny estate gets a dollar per ticket like JK Rowling.

2136
01:38:37,040 --> 01:38:42,040
Also did we know about the Murray Brothers Caddyshack restaurant?

2137
01:38:42,040 --> 01:38:44,040
The golf themed restaurant?

2138
01:38:44,040 --> 01:38:45,040
My God.

2139
01:38:45,040 --> 01:38:47,040
Oh my God no.

2140
01:38:47,040 --> 01:38:53,040
If it existed in Celebruary when Marissa was here last then we sadly didn't bring it up.

2141
01:38:53,040 --> 01:38:54,040
Where is that?

2142
01:38:54,040 --> 01:38:57,040
St. Augustine, Florida?

2143
01:38:57,040 --> 01:39:02,040
Interesting because the Murray Brothers I know about their golf clothing line that exists

2144
01:39:02,040 --> 01:39:06,040
and their golf accessories but I did not know about the restaurant.

2145
01:39:06,040 --> 01:39:07,040
So that's interesting.

2146
01:39:07,040 --> 01:39:08,040
We'll have to look into that.

2147
01:39:08,040 --> 01:39:10,040
It's got a giant golf ball on the.

2148
01:39:10,040 --> 01:39:11,040
Oh and it says Caddyshack on it.

2149
01:39:11,040 --> 01:39:12,040
That looks fun.

2150
01:39:12,040 --> 01:39:14,040
You know what you're getting into.

2151
01:39:14,040 --> 01:39:19,040
It's so like dumb Planet Hollywood style.

2152
01:39:19,040 --> 01:39:26,040
Rarely has there been a building in the last few years where something was added flying out of or into the building.

2153
01:39:26,040 --> 01:39:27,040
I know.

2154
01:39:27,040 --> 01:39:28,040
Only City Walk.

2155
01:39:28,040 --> 01:39:30,040
That's why you got to go up there.

2156
01:39:30,040 --> 01:39:31,040
Yeah.

2157
01:39:31,040 --> 01:39:41,040
Well I think we made it and I think that I can say Monstressa Shreekland and Justin Michael Myers you survived podcast The Fright.

2158
01:39:41,040 --> 01:39:42,040
Wow.

2159
01:39:42,040 --> 01:39:47,040
Thanks for giving me the most fun outro possible and let's exit through the crypt shop.

2160
01:39:47,040 --> 01:39:50,040
Is there anything you'd like to plug?

2161
01:39:51,040 --> 01:39:58,040
I mean if you are interested in seeing more of my spooky delights.

2162
01:39:58,040 --> 01:40:05,040
You can just go to Marissa Shreekland dot com and you know be nice to each other.

2163
01:40:05,040 --> 01:40:06,040
Not nice be kind.

2164
01:40:06,040 --> 01:40:07,040
Kind is better than nice.

2165
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:10,040
I'm like I'm anti nice.

2166
01:40:10,040 --> 01:40:11,040
Too much.

2167
01:40:11,040 --> 01:40:12,040
It's performative.

2168
01:40:12,040 --> 01:40:13,040
It's performative.

2169
01:40:13,040 --> 01:40:14,040
Yeah that's true.

2170
01:40:14,040 --> 01:40:16,040
It's thinking about the other instead of genuinely doing something.

2171
01:40:16,040 --> 01:40:17,040
That's a good distinction.

2172
01:40:17,040 --> 01:40:18,040
Wow.

2173
01:40:18,040 --> 01:40:19,040
Wow.

2174
01:40:19,040 --> 01:40:20,040
I think I'm going to do.

2175
01:40:20,040 --> 01:40:23,040
Queen of nagging me into going to Mazes on that one.

2176
01:40:23,040 --> 01:40:24,040
And it worked.

2177
01:40:24,040 --> 01:40:25,040
It rhymed.

2178
01:40:25,040 --> 01:40:26,040
Justin plug.

2179
01:40:26,040 --> 01:40:31,040
Oh yeah I'm online.

2180
01:40:31,040 --> 01:40:32,040
Hey Justin.

2181
01:40:32,040 --> 01:40:33,040
On X.

2182
01:40:33,040 --> 01:40:34,040
On X.

2183
01:40:34,040 --> 01:40:35,040
Yeah exclusively on X.

2184
01:40:35,040 --> 01:40:36,040
Me and Elon.

2185
01:40:36,040 --> 01:40:37,040
Only.

2186
01:40:37,040 --> 01:40:43,040
You can listen to Nature Talks to Itself.

2187
01:40:43,040 --> 01:40:45,040
It's an improv podcast.

2188
01:40:45,040 --> 01:40:47,040
First podcast by nature for anybody.

2189
01:40:47,040 --> 01:40:48,040
Oh yes.

2190
01:40:48,040 --> 01:40:50,040
I sent I sent in a voice letter.

2191
01:40:50,040 --> 01:40:51,040
Yeah.

2192
01:40:51,040 --> 01:40:52,040
You guys have you been.

2193
01:40:52,040 --> 01:40:53,040
I did a voice letter.

2194
01:40:53,040 --> 01:40:54,040
Mm hmm.

2195
01:40:54,040 --> 01:40:55,040
That's what you call it.

2196
01:40:55,040 --> 01:40:56,040
Voice letter.

2197
01:40:56,040 --> 01:40:57,040
Probably not.

2198
01:40:57,040 --> 01:41:00,040
We have a section called snail mail where people call in as like plants or animals and things

2199
01:41:00,040 --> 01:41:02,040
and they get advice from us.

2200
01:41:02,040 --> 01:41:03,040
I did do it.

2201
01:41:03,040 --> 01:41:04,040
A rock and a leaf.

2202
01:41:04,040 --> 01:41:05,040
I did it.

2203
01:41:05,040 --> 01:41:06,040
Yeah right.

2204
01:41:06,040 --> 01:41:07,040
Jason have you done it.

2205
01:41:07,040 --> 01:41:08,040
No.

2206
01:41:08,040 --> 01:41:09,040
Okay well.

2207
01:41:09,040 --> 01:41:10,040
You're next.

2208
01:41:10,040 --> 01:41:11,040
It was.

2209
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:12,040
The horror movie.

2210
01:41:12,040 --> 01:41:13,040
Uh oh yeah.

2211
01:41:13,040 --> 01:41:14,040
A house.

2212
01:41:15,040 --> 01:41:16,040
I believe a haunted house.

2213
01:41:16,040 --> 01:41:19,040
I know our nights.

2214
01:41:19,040 --> 01:41:21,040
Marissa also brought Tato chips.

2215
01:41:21,040 --> 01:41:22,040
Oh yeah.

2216
01:41:22,040 --> 01:41:23,040
Wait.

2217
01:41:23,040 --> 01:41:24,040
Yes.

2218
01:41:24,040 --> 01:41:30,040
So really briefly Justin and I went to Ireland and you know before you guys I had zero affinity

2219
01:41:30,040 --> 01:41:31,040
with Mr. Tato and now.

2220
01:41:31,040 --> 01:41:32,040
Oh yes.

2221
01:41:32,040 --> 01:41:36,440
I covered Tato Park this Irish theme park in our European vacation series and you did

2222
01:41:36,440 --> 01:41:38,760
the episode despite not having been.

2223
01:41:38,760 --> 01:41:43,840
You just like sparks to the idea of it and that was a particularly delightful one I thought

2224
01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:47,240
in deepest pandemic and now you've been.

2225
01:41:47,240 --> 01:41:50,640
Well I've been to Ireland I haven't been to Tato Park.

2226
01:41:50,640 --> 01:41:51,640
Oh right.

2227
01:41:51,640 --> 01:41:52,640
It was rebranded.

2228
01:41:52,640 --> 01:41:53,640
Did it like.

2229
01:41:53,640 --> 01:41:56,640
It's called Emerald Park I think now.

2230
01:41:56,640 --> 01:42:00,840
Had Tato still been the mascot of the park we would have definitely gone.

2231
01:42:00,840 --> 01:42:02,560
But our flight was delayed.

2232
01:42:02,560 --> 01:42:07,520
You know there wasn't time to drive the distance to get there we would have gotten there right

2233
01:42:07,520 --> 01:42:12,600
at closing so we did not go to Emerald Park I'm sure it's lovely but I did want you to

2234
01:42:12,840 --> 01:42:17,240
eat some of my cannon husband Mr. Tato.

2235
01:42:17,240 --> 01:42:21,760
I brought cheese and onion chips or they're calling it flavor potato crisps.

2236
01:42:21,760 --> 01:42:22,760
Not potato sticks.

2237
01:42:22,760 --> 01:42:28,040
No not the little sticks that's for hot dogs that's for novelty hot dogs.

2238
01:42:28,040 --> 01:42:30,200
Those are hot dog dressings.

2239
01:42:30,200 --> 01:42:32,200
But I hope you enjoy.

2240
01:42:32,200 --> 01:42:36,200
You know Tato's still got his hat he's still waving his four fingers and you know he's

2241
01:42:36,200 --> 01:42:37,200
happy.

2242
01:42:37,200 --> 01:42:38,200
Wow wow.

2243
01:42:38,200 --> 01:42:41,160
Oh it's so it's so nice to hear it's so nice to hear you guys are doing well.

2244
01:42:41,240 --> 01:42:42,240
Yeah it's real great.

2245
01:42:44,240 --> 01:42:47,560
Good for me to be humiliated publicly with your new husband.

2246
01:42:47,560 --> 01:42:49,560
A mascot on a chip bag.

2247
01:42:49,560 --> 01:42:52,560
Join the cuddle puddle.

2248
01:42:52,560 --> 01:42:54,560
He's in my you're all everybody.

2249
01:42:54,560 --> 01:42:59,560
I mean those crisps are going to be crushed if you cuddle too hard.

2250
01:42:59,560 --> 01:43:04,560
If you cuddle with Tato himself too hard he will be crushed.

2251
01:43:04,560 --> 01:43:05,560
He will be crushed.

2252
01:43:05,560 --> 01:43:06,560
The mashed potatoes.

2253
01:43:06,960 --> 01:43:07,960
Yeah.

2254
01:43:08,960 --> 01:43:09,960
Well this is Delilah.

2255
01:43:09,960 --> 01:43:12,960
So happy to have both of you guys in together.

2256
01:43:12,960 --> 01:43:13,960
Dream scenario.

2257
01:43:13,960 --> 01:43:14,960

2260
01:43:22,360 --> 01:43:24,360
That's what's so cool about it.

2261
01:43:24,360 --> 01:43:26,360
