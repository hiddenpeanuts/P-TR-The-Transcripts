1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,840
Forever.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:03,680
Dog.

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,740
Warning, the following podcast contains

4
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:09,840
drop-based accomplishments, electronic mail,

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,040
the start of a bitter feud with a theme park

6
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:15,160
award show organization, and a look at the dark arts

7
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:19,240
at Hogwarts Castle Show at Universal Studios.

8
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:23,520
Expecto Patronum, it's podcast The Ride.

9
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:28,520
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, hosted by three guys

10
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,800
who now have all helped a certain raccoon break his friends

11
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,720
out of the world's most high-stakes gantry lift.

12
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:55,760
Oh my god.

13
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,240
I'm Scott Garner, the bravest guy, joined by Mike Carlson,

14
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,760
Jason Sheridan, who proved their bravery long ago,

15
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,800
but for me it's hot off the presses.

16
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,940
I almost didn't. It's done.

17
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,400
It's been done.

18
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,560
I will keep wanting to interrupt you

19
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,600
because I'm so, so shocked.

20
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,560
I just wanted to play it real smooth,

21
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,520
like nothing was going on.

22
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,360
I, it just suddenly, it struck me and I did it.

23
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,040
I'm talking about Guardians of the Galaxy mission breakout.

24
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,040
Wow.

25
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:22,860
See, you didn't, if you didn't know.

26
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:25,680
We all know what happens now.

27
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,720
We know about the hand scan.

28
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,000
His hands don't scan.

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,840
That hands don't scan.

30
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,560
My hands don't scan.

31
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,720
My hands do scan.

32
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,620
I need to get the clearance so you guys can get up the lift

33
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:39,460
or whatever he says.

34
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:41,800
If you know anything about biology,

35
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:45,640
you know that raccoon hands don't scan, famously.

36
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,800
You learned that in school.

37
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,400
My hands don't scan.

38
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,360
I always like, he goes like up on that one, I feel like,

39
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,640
when he's doing that thing.

40
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,460
Oh, my hands don't scan.

41
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:53,640
They never do.

42
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,080
Money and joy.

43
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:55,920
My name's Rocket.

44
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,320
You go right through.

45
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:00,160
Well, when, when the fuck did you do this, Scott?

46
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:05,160
Um, I was at the park yesterday.

47
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,600
I was wondering if this was the day

48
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,200
because I, if you heard the Tokyo episode,

49
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,480
I braved the Tower of Terror.

50
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,840
I liked it so much I did it three times, all told.

51
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,640
But still, Aaron had warned me,

52
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,000
Guardians more intense, definitely more intense.

53
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,720
But I had a trick up my sleeve,

54
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,960
which was drinking a lot of wine.

55
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,800
Oh, yeah.

56
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,520
Which certainly helps to soften what was scary about it.

57
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,240
All it took was two glasses of Chardonnay

58
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,000
and a red trolley ale.

59
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,420
And suddenly I was blasting off with all my buds,

60
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:45,400
with Strongo and Blue Girl and all of them.

61
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,040
That's not so much a trick, so much as a lifestyle.

62
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,800
Hey, if it works.

63
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,640
Yeah.

64
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,880
Well, everyone, this is now, I think,

65
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:58,720
the third in my trilogy of bravery.

66
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,520
In that now I have, you know,

67
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,200
Tony got me on Splash Mountain.

68
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,000
I started doing Incredicoaster and then Tower of Terror.

69
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,320
And I guess then relatedly, Guardians of the Galaxy,

70
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,400
this was sort of like the last one.

71
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,000
So now X2 is the next.

72
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,400
Yeah, yeah, now I'm prepped to go on, you know,

73
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,000
the 10th scariest Six Flags ride

74
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,880
and still be really fucked up from it.

75
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:24,640
Scary by design and by like a 15-year-old running it.

76
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,760
Oh, yes, true.

77
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,200
I'm almost more scared of the ricketyness

78
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,800
of a lot of those rides than,

79
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,800
because at least these things are all scary but smooth.

80
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,720
Boy, that was one thing.

81
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,040
In Tokyo, doing Space Mountain

82
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,440
and having Space Mountain be like rickety again

83
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,880
was definitely upset.

84
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,960
It's a more, it's tamer than other Space Mountains

85
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,080
and yet more upsetting because it's,

86
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,160
they haven't had the track redo.

87
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,520
But anyway, it was, what I was getting at was that alcohol

88
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,920
was involved in all of these bravery situations.

89
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:58,640
But you know, I needs my medicine, I guess.

90
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,320
But you know, as I go forward,

91
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,480
I think I can get to where I only need like a beer and a half

92
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,200
to go on these scary rides.

93
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,640
Work your way down, that's the way.

94
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

95
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,400
So you did it once.

96
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,480
I did it the once.

97
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,840
I got Burning Love was my sequence.

98
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,880
Though I was yelling the whole time

99
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,000
and everyone was yelling the whole time.

100
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,880
I feel like I barely heard the song

101
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,720
and there's a lot going on.

102
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,400
But I kept my eyes open a lot more than I thought.

103
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,840
I really thought the Tower of Terror was,

104
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,200
in Japan, was gonna be the gateway for me

105
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,240
because now I could like, if I was freaked out,

106
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,000
I recognize the space now.

107
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,880
I know where the handles are.

108
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,280
The view will seem familiar to me.

109
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,120
So I looked, it all made sense.

110
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,280
But definitely more intense, for sure more intense.

111
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:50,840
I had been so afraid with my No Launch Queen history.

112
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,640
I was afraid, like this is a drop ride

113
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:56,480
and a launch combined, worst case scenario.

114
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,520
But that part really didn't bother me, actually.

115
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,560
It still is drops are the big thing.

116
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:08,080
And in this case, I think what ended up bugging me the most

117
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,360
is that you like, as opposed to,

118
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:13,720
Tower of Tokyo has like three drops, ultimately.

119
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,440
And you do feel like you get like solid footing

120
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,480
here and there.

121
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:20,800
Guardians, you're up and down and up and down.

122
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,920
And they wobble you in between, too.

123
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,240
Oh yes, even when you stop, that's a very good point.

124
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,480
Even when you are stopped, quote unquote,

125
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:31,280
in the show scenes, you're never really at rest.

126
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,280
And it worked out fine,

127
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,360
especially with the cloak of wine.

128
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,560
Here's what I will say, going to bed last night,

129
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,400
I was a little like weird from it.

130
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,240
Really?

131
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,200
Does this make any sense?

132
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,200
Does this sound familiar at all?

133
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,960
I feel as if, I was just thinking in my head is like,

134
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,120
if I had been in a centrifuge,

135
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,320
I would probably be having weird phantom feelings

136
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,600
later in the day.

137
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,480
But I was having like weird nausea dizziness,

138
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:00,600
way late, way delayed, like at the end of the day.

139
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,720
That's weird.

140
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,440
Does it sound familiar at all?

141
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,560
No, I'm trying to think.

142
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,600
I mean, if you're not used to it, I can kind of see that.

143
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,440
That might be it.

144
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,920
It's like sensations that are new to me.

145
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,040
Also, do you think you're tense?

146
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,720
How tense are you on it?

147
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,120
I was probably pretty tense.

148
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,520
I'm digging in on those handles for sure.

149
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,960
I bet that's it.

150
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,280
I bet that's sort of the feeling of like,

151
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,080
it's sticking with your body is when you're tense.

152
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,680
Cause when you're in a car wreck,

153
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,800
they say you're not supposed to tense,

154
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,840
obviously how are you gonna ever figure that out?

155
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,880
Or know how to do that right in the moment.

156
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,680
But I bet it's similar where like your body,

157
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,760
like since you were so tense,

158
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,520
it's like got the memory of it.

159
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,240
And you're like reliving it a little bit.

160
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,080
Well, and in my, like as with all of these things,

161
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,320
you know, Splash Madden freaked me out

162
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,520
because I was scared of the earnest special.

163
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,120
Tower of Terror has freaked me out for a long time

164
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,280
because the one time I did it in 2005 was so crazy.

165
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,080
It was like way too advanced for me thrill wise.

166
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,080
And I totally freaked out.

167
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,880
And I think I couldn't find the handles.

168
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,400
And I was like clawing against the cage wall,

169
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,000
which is why still in both towers,

170
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,840
I went, Aaron was like, do you wanna go against the wall?

171
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,760
And I was like, no, no, no, no, no, no.

172
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,600
So you don't want-

173
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:14,200
I'm scared of the wall I think from my first experience.

174
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,520
I'm still like, yeah.

175
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,360
So what's-

176
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:21,360
I have like, you know, like weird shattered memories

177
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,560
from that like-

178
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,520
Cause that seems comfortable to me if you're scared

179
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,080
is like the back corner wall sort of.

180
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,440
I think, I really think, I think something happened

181
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,840
and I couldn't find the handle.

182
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,120
And then I was like trying to find it later

183
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,840
and clawing against the wall

184
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,240
as if trying to get out of a cage.

185
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,600
Doesn't that sound scary?

186
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,240
Can you see why I wouldn't have kept doing it?

187
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,080
Yeah.

188
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,840
A caged animal trying to escape.

189
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,000
That was me in 2005.

190
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,280
But today, 2019, Mr. Triumph,

191
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:55,240
which is one of the names of one of the guardians, correct?

192
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,520
As far as I know. Mr. Triumph.

193
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,680
That's, he's played by John Cena.

194
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,120
Oh yes, that's what I thought.

195
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,840
A mo-capped John Cena.

196
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,240
And he's very small.

197
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,360
He's like two feet tall.

198
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,080
They mo-cap squish him, right?

199
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,960
I haven't seen the films so I'd-

200
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,800
Mr. Triumph.

201
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,480
This is a billion dollar franchise

202
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,320
you're just giving away right now.

203
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,440
I do have to say with guardians,

204
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,520
some of the seats you get the music better.

205
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,000
Like some of the seats you hit the speakers better.

206
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,840
Yeah, a lot.

207
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,560
Cause yeah, in the back I think you don't hear it as well.

208
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,960
Okay, that might be true.

209
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:33,000
None of these times now have I been in the front row

210
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,480
I would like to be.

211
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:38,960
Now you were saying that maybe the way to break me out of it

212
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,640
is just like ripping through three in a row.

213
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,200
I think from the nausea,

214
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,880
which in a way I still feel right now as I record this,

215
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,880
I think three in a row would fuck me up.

216
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,840
I think that's too much like gravity shift

217
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,960
for me or something.

218
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,800
I guess, yeah.

219
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,520
I think it was just sort of the,

220
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,040
cause being comfortable is the issue.

221
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,040
I don't know, it depends if that would make you

222
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,880
comfortable or not.

223
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,200
Cause yeah, I guess if you're having like

224
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,480
war flashbacks right now still too yesterday.

225
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,640
That's the word I was searching for, yes.

226
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,880
PTSD.

227
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,720
It's PTSD.

228
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,880
Did you, how soon after,

229
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,280
when did you eat?

230
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:22,400
I had a pretty hearty churro probably an hour before.

231
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,840
Which by the way, another thing Tokyo Disney taught me,

232
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:29,880
churros with stuff on them, better than regular churros.

233
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,920
We had this Nemo churro that was so good

234
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,480
and Erin got a birthday churro that's available right now.

235
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,240
So much better than regular churro.

236
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,080
I fucked up.

237
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,080
It was like a sugar cookie combined with the churro.

238
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,920
No more plain churros for me.

239
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,040
I've learned my lesson.

240
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:47,120
Well, that price, that price keeps going up, you know?

241
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,760
It is a ton of money for one stick.

242
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,160
That is certainly true.

243
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,480
You get the same amount of food at Taco Bell

244
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,640
and they're like cinnamon sticks for like 79 cents

245
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,920
or something for like $7 at Disney.

246
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,920
At Universal, a butter beer with tax is up to like $8.

247
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,880
They were like five when they debuted.

248
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,160
I had nothing to compare it to.

249
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,880
Hey, again, prices in Tokyo, pretty reasonable.

250
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:18,720
And that yen conversion, I do miss that.

251
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,000
But anyway, I'm doing it.

252
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,600
I think it's in the rotation despite my,

253
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,160
I guess what still is my current PTSD.

254
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,600
But.

255
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,960
We'll obviously do a full review

256
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,160
after you're totally comfortable.

257
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:34,120
But just overall from what you saw

258
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:37,560
through the very closed eyes,

259
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,400
what did you, just an overall impression.

260
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,240
I watched a lot.

261
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,080
I really did.

262
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,240
I swear that I did.

263
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,120
And the photo will attest to that.

264
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:45,960
There's a photo.

265
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,160
I need to download it.

266
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:50,760
But yes, eyes open on the job.

267
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,600
It was great.

268
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,440
All the scenes are great.

269
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,640
I have no idea what's going on.

270
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,840
I haven't seen these movies.

271
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,080
But it's very manic.

272
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,760
But a lot of fun.

273
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,160
Love the screens.

274
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,480
They look good.

275
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,920
It is such a bright, sharp kind of screen.

276
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,560
That might be the best looking

277
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,840
current theme park screen, I would say.

278
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,680
Maybe so.

279
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,520
I can't compare.

280
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:13,640
I don't know about the sort of supplemental screens

281
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,480
on Avatar.

282
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,760
But it could be, those might be better.

283
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,000
But yeah, boy, they really boomed through the room.

284
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I guess I prefer Tokyo and the idol and all that.

285
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,400
But story-wise and scene-wise.

286
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,920
But I like that they're different flavors.

287
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,400
I don't know why, with everybody fighting to keep it,

288
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,320
Twilight Zone, and by fighting I mean complaining

289
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,080
and having no power to do anything about it.

290
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,200
I really like that they're all different.

291
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,720
That it's the same genre of ride

292
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,160
that now in two places is Twilight Zone.

293
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,120
In one is this totally original story about a high tower

294
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,720
and one is a franchise.

295
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,040
It's like how I really like that there's,

296
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,560
all the haunted mansions are a little different

297
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,840
and then there's Phantom Manor and then there's

298
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,660
Mystic Manor.

299
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:04,360
Mystic Manor, yeah, yeah.

300
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,280
So I don't know, they're just totally different flavors.

301
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,280
I have no complaints.

302
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:11,680
I'm not upset about plot holes in the ride.

303
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,840
I feel fine.

304
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,200
Yeah, I don't know.

305
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,360
How do you feel about,

306
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,680
I mean I know you like the ride a lot.

307
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,560
Do you feel similar compared to Twilight Zone?

308
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:27,360
Yeah, I mean I think especially with what we've said before

309
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,120
where it was like that was the weakest one

310
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,920
or one of the weakest ones of Tower of Terror.

311
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,240
So yeah, this is much better.

312
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,320
I think the ride itself is longer and is the most fun

313
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,520
of the actual physical sensation of dropping.

314
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,680
I like that it's crazy and it goes up and down

315
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,280
and it's always different.

316
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:47,240
I seriously am feeling it in my body.

317
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,480
It's like I'm coming down from some trip

318
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,320
or some chase thing.

319
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,760
It happened to me as a kid.

320
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,920
If I went boogie boarding for a long time

321
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,720
then I'd be going to bed and I'd be feeling

322
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,240
like the phantom motion of the waves

323
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,520
way later in the day.

324
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,200
I've had that on a boat.

325
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,040
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

326
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,540
It's similar to that, yes.

327
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:04,840
Because you do go up and down

328
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,680
and when you're up and down in between the drops

329
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,800
it is a little bit like an ocean,

330
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,800
like a little bit of a, like you're on a boogie board

331
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,480
or like a, you're just sitting idly in a boat.

332
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,640
You have no firm footing.

333
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,280
This also combined with,

334
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,480
I'm still not that far out from my Tokyo trip.

335
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:22,560
I've had Tokyo Disney dreams every single night

336
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,400
since I left.

337
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,220
Wow.

338
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,680
Just constant.

339
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,520
Wow.

340
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,880
Including that when I got home

341
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,440
I was so weird and jet lagged

342
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:33,440
that I took a nap immediately at two in the afternoon.

343
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,400
And there's just like, yeah, yeah.

344
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,840
Fuck me up for a little while.

345
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:41,080
But in the afternoon there's just like

346
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:44,680
yellow golden light flooding into the room

347
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:49,240
which turned into dreams about Easter and Gudetama

348
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,040
and all of the egg content in Tokyo.

349
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,600
I had wonder, they've all been great dreams.

350
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,760
I wanna stay in this place where I'm like,

351
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,780
I get to still live in Tokyo in my dreams

352
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,440
for a third of every day.

353
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,280
It rules.

354
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,120
Yeah, it sounds great.

355
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,040
I had a dream I couldn't find a dog last night

356
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,640
and I woke up like in a panic, an angry panic.

357
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,220
Like who let him out?

358
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:13,040
If only you could go back to your beloved checking dreams.

359
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,620
No, that's the best.

360
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:16,420
I've said on the show before,

361
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:18,300
did I say I had a dream about Star Wars Land Hotel

362
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,780
where it was like a really realistic Star Wars Land Hotel

363
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:22,420
where you would have to get like decontaminated

364
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:25,660
before going into space and you were like naked in showers?

365
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:26,940
Jeez, horrifying.

366
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:29,460
A theme is hallmark of the Star Wars films.

367
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:31,940
Well, I mean like it was like a weird sci-fi movie

368
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,100
but like how you would actually maybe

369
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,380
have to get decontaminated

370
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:37,580
and it was like a real brutal, gross process.

371
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,300
Checked up your butt?

372
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,900
No butt, nothing in the butt.

373
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,460
But I was naked.

374
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,620
Yeah, my shame.

375
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,620
My shame was, that's what you call it, right?

376
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:48,740
With an audience of like 500 storm troopers

377
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,420
who all like point at you?

378
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:52,460
There were storm troopers but they weren't pointing

379
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,940
but there were just a bunch of other humans

380
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:58,140
all like naked walking through these like bleak corridors.

381
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,340
Yeah, you sound like you're doing better

382
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:03,100
in the dreams department than I am.

383
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,980
They've been pretty nice lately

384
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:07,700
and hopefully Guardians helps keep that out.

385
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,900
Anyway, I'm sorry, I know how this is supposed to go

386
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,600
is that we're supposed to stretch this

387
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,200
into four episodes of content

388
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,040
but instead what I do is I drink a beer

389
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,760
and then I do the thing that scares me.

390
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:22,760
It's working for me and hey, this podcast has made me

391
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:26,520
get over fears that I've had for decades

392
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,920
and it feels great.

393
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,160
Good justification to do it.

394
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:34,400
Well, we'll draw you going on like six times in a row

395
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,920
to get all six songs or something.

396
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,440
Like we'll make that an event maybe.

397
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,880
The day where you'll have to do all six.

398
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:39,720
Oh, that's good.

399
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,560
Or Monsters After Dark

400
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,560
which is my favorite of all the profiles.

401
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,960
Do you think it's, is it, well is it more intense

402
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,080
and does it being generally scarier

403
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,120
affect the thrill level?

404
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:53,040
I think it's scarier because you don't know the song.

405
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,320
Like you can't latch on to like, I know this song.

406
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,440
It might be a song that never ends.

407
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,760
Like does this song go for 24 minutes?

408
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,880
Oh, it kind of doesn't.

409
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,800
It's much like comic books are all second act

410
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,480
as we're all about to learn or have learned at this point

411
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,440
with no real conclusion.

412
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:14,200
The Monsters After Dark song just repeats and repeats.

413
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,040
I love it.

414
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,800
No, it's the same ride profile as one of the six.

415
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,200
It's just a different song.

416
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,520
And then the vibe inside is a little different

417
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,360
and it's cool.

418
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:27,000
Yeah, but it's as far as actually physically being on there.

419
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,440
It's not a ton scarier.

420
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,640
It's a little, it's like, it's not,

421
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:34,000
I think Ghost Galaxy is even a little scarier honestly.

422
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,040
Well, that last hit at the end.

423
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:36,880
Yeah.

424
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,700
Dear God.

425
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,180
It's a little scarier.

426
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,020
Yeah.

427
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:40,840
Yeah.

428
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,940
All right, well I'll keep building and then,

429
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:45,340
yeah, maybe this is, maybe I've built up to where I have

430
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:47,180
like a Six Flags handicap.

431
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:51,300
I have like a 15 handicap as far as,

432
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,460
you gotta grade me on a curve

433
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:54,300
when it comes to real thrill rides.

434
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:57,140
But I'm getting there, progress.

435
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:57,980
Great.

436
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:58,820
Yes.

437
00:16:58,820 --> 00:16:59,660
Congratulations.

438
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:00,480
So happy to report it.

439
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,060
And that's just one, that's just one part

440
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,860
of a little Grab Bag episode that we're doing

441
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:06,340
where we'll answer some of your questions.

442
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:09,020
But first, you know, still some business

443
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:11,060
to take care of post Tokyo.

444
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:12,740
You guys were up to some stuff

445
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,260
and I don't even know what it was.

446
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:16,420
I hear there were some dark arts involved,

447
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:18,340
but some other adventures as well.

448
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:21,980
Hey, as the ride would say, hit me with your best shot.

449
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:23,660
What do you got?

450
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:24,900
Very good segue.

451
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:29,260
Yeah, so Universal Hollywood, very kind to invite,

452
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:34,260
podcast the ride to a press event for the new dark arts.

453
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:35,220
What's it called officially?

454
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,660
Dark Arts at Hogwarts Castle.

455
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:39,100
Dark Arts at Hogwarts Castle.

456
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:42,100
It's a new nighttime projection mapping show,

457
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,140
although that kind of undersells like what it is.

458
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:46,060
There's a little more than that.

459
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:48,580
They sort of, I mean, they've done a few projection

460
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:50,940
kind of shows on the Hogwarts Castle.

461
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:55,500
And this one, I think they plus up their own thing.

462
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,940
Like there's a lot more effects.

463
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:59,060
There's some fog effects.

464
00:17:59,060 --> 00:17:59,900
Fire.

465
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,540
There's fire.

466
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,420
And the grand finale, which you know, Scott,

467
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,540
you know what the grand finale is?

468
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:05,380
Do not.

469
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:06,220
All right, spoilers.

470
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:07,060
Should we?

471
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:07,900
Spoiler alert.

472
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:08,740
Spoiler alert.

473
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:12,060
Jump ahead a few minutes if you don't wanna hear about this.

474
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:15,700
It's a massive fleet of drones that forms,

475
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,540
I believe.

476
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:18,380
Patronus.

477
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:19,220
Yeah, Patronus.

478
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,980
Which is like an elk.

479
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:21,820
Yeah.

480
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:22,660
And it moves.

481
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,060
It lifts its leg.

482
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:25,340
I should show you a little clip here.

483
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:26,420
I thought it was just gonna be like,

484
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,940
oh yeah, look, it's drones.

485
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,460
It's like twinkling lights.

486
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:32,300
But then it formed a shape.

487
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:33,140
Wow.

488
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:33,980
And lifted its leg.

489
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:36,820
So this is where finally the drone technology

490
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,940
we've been hearing about for a long time.

491
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:41,860
Really, there's been like a quiet drone war

492
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:43,180
between Disney and Universal.

493
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:44,820
And it seems like Universal won.

494
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:45,660
They got it out sooner.

495
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:48,500
Yeah, Disney was testing out a holiday kind of drone show

496
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,500
at Disney Springs.

497
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,180
It was pretty short.

498
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:54,780
But I think this might be the first in-park one.

499
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:57,500
And a good place to do it, Universal Hollywood,

500
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,260
because you have a whole empty movie studio backlog

501
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:03,780
to take off and land those things from.

502
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:07,300
And due to tax breaks happening in other states

503
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:10,020
and countries, it is an empty studio lot.

504
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:12,700
So it's plenty of room to do whatever they want.

505
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,340
Just avoid the set of Superstore,

506
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,900
the only show that exists.

507
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:16,740
Yes.

508
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:22,540
But yeah, it was very cool to see.

509
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:25,060
I took some pictures, but it's nighttime.

510
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:26,700
It's hard to sort of see.

511
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,140
I mean, I don't, like, can you see that, Scott?

512
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,460
Can you move over?

513
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,300
To the left.

514
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,140
Is that all visible?

515
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:33,300
You see it at all?

516
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:34,660
It's only the tiniest.

517
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:36,060
Oh, I see the elk.

518
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:38,220
Well, from here, it looks like a magic eye.

519
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,260
But I'm sure it's much brighter.

520
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,260
Oh, look.

521
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:44,060
Oh my god, it turns its head in a very subtle manner.

522
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,260
Lifts its leg.

523
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:47,500
It's really quite impressive.

524
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,620
Takes a piss.

525
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:52,180
Flowing really realistic drone piss.

526
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:53,740
Gets shot by a hunter.

527
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,100
A hunter's drone arrow.

528
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,580
Its son cries.

529
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,860
Now, of course, like fireworks,

530
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:02,580
drones have their own issues.

531
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:05,260
I've heard nights where they do the show,

532
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:08,380
but because of the winds that we've been having in LA,

533
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:10,580
they haven't done the drone sequence.

534
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:13,300
We also saw a little inadvertent behind the scenes

535
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,820
because a helicopter flew by

536
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:17,820
probably more than a mile away.

537
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:21,100
And I think the drones have automatic warning lights.

538
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:25,220
So as they were resetting, it kind of popped up.

539
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:27,340
But they were pretty far out of view at this point.

540
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:29,060
They were headed back to base.

541
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:29,900
They were headed back.

542
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:30,940
A helicopter flew by and all of a sudden

543
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:33,020
they all shot up, like turned red.

544
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,620
And we were like, oh, that wasn't supposed to happen.

545
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:35,460
No.

546
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:36,300
That was after the end.

547
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,100
It was, yeah, after the show was over.

548
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:42,020
So, and honestly for what we like was more cool.

549
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:43,980
They were like, yeah, yeah, we wanna see,

550
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,900
we wanna see the seams.

551
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:46,740
Yeah.

552
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,340
And know about the safety procedures.

553
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:49,180
Yeah.

554
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:51,380
Show is one thing, but what happens if they get shot at?

555
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:52,220
Right.

556
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:53,820
We wanted to warn the helicopter too.

557
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:57,700
But a fun, a nice show, a good length.

558
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,860
It's like, yeah, they did it before,

559
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:02,660
but it's like, is it Dumbledore talking?

560
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:03,500
Is he?

561
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,300
Dumbledore talking and then Voldemort shows up

562
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,860
and destroys the castle.

563
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:09,820
Yeah, so it's like, the idea is that

564
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:11,820
they're just getting attacked by Dementors

565
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:14,260
and Dementors and Death Eaters.

566
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:16,780
And then there's like spiders crawling up the castle

567
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:20,420
and skulls and then like magic sweeps it away.

568
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:24,180
The storefront of Borgen and Berks, the Nocturnally.

569
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:26,940
Which I was reading about, cause I was like,

570
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,900
how does this place still get a lease

571
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:31,380
if it's where all the evil people buy their stuff?

572
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:34,020
And the reason is that in the Harry Potter universe,

573
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:36,380
it acts as like a pawn shop.

574
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:38,180
And so that's what they.

575
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:39,020
That's their front.

576
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:41,460
That's like, yeah, that's the justification.

577
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:45,060
But it's always, there's always stuff being sold

578
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:47,060
or bought there or discovered there

579
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:48,940
that has larger implications.

580
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:52,860
But the projections, yeah, the projections are very cool.

581
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:57,180
Fire, because they shoot fire out of the castle essentially.

582
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:59,260
Let's see here.

583
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:00,300
I'm scrolling through it.

584
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,260
Yeah, it's pretty scary.

585
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,820
The music's very cool.

586
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:08,820
I do think it's like, with the Disney castle projections,

587
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:12,940
it's like they're not destroying the castle

588
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:15,140
or like attacking it really.

589
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:17,140
So it's like, they change the castle

590
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:18,340
to look like different stuff,

591
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:21,380
but it's kind of, it's less narrative.

592
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:23,140
And the show is a little bit more narrative.

593
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:26,940
I kind of, my only maybe one plus up would be like,

594
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:30,500
I'd love like more like little wizards

595
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,220
like saving the castle.

596
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:33,060
Because it's kind of just like.

597
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,540
The castle kind of puts itself back together

598
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:36,900
as the lights come on and you're filing out.

599
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,740
Yeah, but that's a real minor gripe.

600
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:39,580
I mean, what are we gonna have?

601
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:42,340
Tiny little projections of wizards on little brooms?

602
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:43,140
Yeah. Maybe.

603
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,700
Doing a little cleanup effort.

604
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,940
Yeah. Doing a little cleanup.

605
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:49,420
It's, hey, the fact that they are willing

606
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:52,140
to be a little more like scary, violent with it,

607
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:55,740
that's the universal voice in action.

608
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:59,900
And I think it's neat that they are expanding

609
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:02,660
their nighttime offerings.

610
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:04,540
Because the history of universal had,

611
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:07,260
this might be a weird fun second gate episode

612
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:10,940
is like all of their attempts at nighttime entertainment.

613
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:11,780
Yes.

614
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:13,580
Because there are a few and I don't,

615
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:14,900
they're pretty spotty.

616
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:17,180
There's a lot that happened for six months

617
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:18,340
and were never tried again.

618
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:20,820
I know for a while they had the magicians,

619
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:23,500
the pen dragons doing shows every night.

620
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,940
I mean, I guess Halloween Horror Nights

621
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,020
is a big nighttime.

622
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:27,860
Yeah.

623
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:30,180
But I feel like they've tried, and in Florida too,

624
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:32,900
like phantasmac-esque things along the,

625
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:35,820
stunt shows along the lagoon or whatever.

626
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:37,860
But they've never really found one that sticks.

627
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:41,140
And I think it's cool that Harry Potter's the opportunity

628
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:43,060
for them to do their version of a fireworks show.

629
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:43,900
Sure. Yeah.

630
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,340
Hollywood's kind of in a weird spot

631
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,860
where there's so many neighborhoods around it

632
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:49,460
and a major freeway.

633
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:52,540
And so they can't really shoot off fireworks every night.

634
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:53,380
Sure.

635
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:56,900
So our friend lives over right across the street

636
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,300
and when he takes his dog out,

637
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:01,180
he said he can just see the elk.

638
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:02,020
Yeah.

639
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:02,860
Like you just see it.

640
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:05,660
So like you can obviously view a lot of this stuff

641
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:07,060
from very close nearby.

642
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:09,660
It's a weird thing in general that living around here,

643
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:12,180
that whenever you're driving on the 101,

644
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:16,460
very often you see like a flare go up from Waterworld.

645
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:17,300
Yeah.

646
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:19,460
Yeah, or at nights, like a brief hit

647
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:20,940
of Harry Potter fireworks.

648
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:21,780
Yeah.

649
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:26,020
Olive or Barham, just one of the many benefits

650
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:28,380
of living in Los Angeles, California.

651
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:29,500
Get out here.

652
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,340
If you don't live here already,

653
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:32,700
it's plenty of room. It's one of the-

654
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,540
Get out. Rents are great.

655
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:35,380
It's one of the few.

656
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:37,660
Yeah, the rents are so good.

657
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:39,500
It's one of the few things that's like

658
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:42,180
in a montage sequence in a movie where you're like,

659
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:44,420
this is a busy studio set.

660
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:48,420
Or even just like montages of like people in LA.

661
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,980
It is one of the things where it's like,

662
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:50,820
yeah, stuff happened.

663
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:51,660
Movies are made.

664
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:53,900
Yeah. Absolutely.

665
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:54,740
Yeah, yeah.

666
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:57,180
You feel that Hollywood energy.

667
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:59,420
Hey, to that end, have you guys seen that ad

668
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:03,340
for the Jurassic World ride where like the backlot

669
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:08,340
goes chaotic and all of the, like every type of movie

670
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:12,460
and show is running away from the indominus.

671
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:13,300
Yes.

672
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:16,420
Like showgirls and vampires.

673
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:17,260
And astronauts.

674
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:18,700
And candy. Yeah.

675
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:21,140
They are making every type of movie.

676
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:24,660
It's kind of corny, but of course I do always like that

677
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:27,340
in any Pee-wee, Muppet Show, or Muppet movie,

678
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:30,340
Blazing Saddles kind of setting where all the movies

679
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:31,620
are happening on the lot.

680
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:33,540
Yeah. I do, I don't know.

681
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:34,580
It is a nice so-called act.

682
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:35,660
It worked on me, yeah.

683
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:37,580
It's good. It's got also in that little,

684
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:39,980
it's got what I assume is a scene too at the end

685
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,100
from the ride.

686
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,500
The like cracking glass.

687
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:45,540
Yeah, I think that's the first scene,

688
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:46,980
like the first section.

689
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,220
That's my guess.

690
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:51,540
And then on the newest Mice Chat podcast,

691
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:54,580
I believe Doug Barnes lets it loose that

692
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:56,260
this is a very scary ride.

693
00:25:57,340 --> 00:26:00,780
That this ride, like people are concerned

694
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:05,180
in the company of how scary Jurassic World is gonna be.

695
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:07,820
Like he says, I think on Mice Chat that he wants to,

696
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:09,180
like there's some people that are thinking

697
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:11,700
maybe we have to dial this back.

698
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,700
Ooh, it's their alien encounter.

699
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,100
Yeah. Oh my God.

700
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,460
We gotta get there soon then.

701
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:17,900
Well, I was gonna say- Whenever they open it.

702
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:20,540
I hope they dial it back a couple of weeks

703
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:22,140
after the press event.

704
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:26,300
I mean, I was always scared on that ride.

705
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:29,660
I'm still a little bit freaked out when the dinosaur,

706
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:31,580
when T-Rex comes out at the end.

707
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:32,420
Yeah.

708
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:34,460
I'm imagining what the difference might be now

709
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:37,580
is that it's gonna be dark.

710
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:39,300
It's gonna be very dark.

711
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,340
There's gonna be a lot of like,

712
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:43,660
all of a sudden lights shoot up and there's a dinosaur

713
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:45,220
and it's a horrible noise.

714
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:49,660
Cause the lift hill is pretty much lit in Jurassic Park.

715
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:51,540
So I'm guessing that it's gonna be a lot of dark.

716
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:52,700
Scares the whole way.

717
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:54,660
Scares the whole way.

718
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:57,140
A lot, yeah, a lot less open air.

719
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:58,780
Well, I'm not gonna be able to do it

720
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:00,500
because I don't have a pass right now.

721
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:03,580
And that is the reason it is not that I am scared.

722
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:06,820
I obviously am very brave from my guardians news.

723
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:09,900
So it really is just a logistics thing with the pass.

724
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,300
And otherwise I'd be there in a second.

725
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:12,660
It's just, I can't, I can't.

726
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:13,500
It makes sense to me.

727
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,420
Just can't pull that right now.

728
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:15,420
The great thing is though,

729
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:17,620
we have such a great relationship with Universal Studios

730
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:20,060
that we'll obviously just get an invite to the press event.

731
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:21,140
You guys do.

732
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:23,580
They know your faces, but I'm gonna be there.

733
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:25,060
Like who's this loser?

734
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,420
I'm just gonna feel like kind of a third wheel

735
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:28,420
and you guys don't want that.

736
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:30,180
I could spoil the whole relationship.

737
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:32,940
So I just, I don't know if it's gonna work out.

738
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,220
I will wish though.

739
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:35,580
I wanna see that in Dominus.

740
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:37,140
I want all the scares.

741
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:39,700
I love scares now too, just like you Mike.

742
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:43,220
Well, look, I know you're a changed man ever since Tokyo.

743
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:44,140
So I believe you.

744
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:46,380
I believe what you're saying 100% that that is the reason.

745
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:47,660
Everyone should.

746
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:49,540
Don't take any tone that I'm using

747
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:50,900
as anything but the truth.

748
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,580
Right, well in a couple of weeks,

749
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:55,540
I mean very soon I think this is opening.

750
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,380
So we'll see.

751
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,540
We'll see what happens.

752
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:58,980
Could we build the saga out of that?

753
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,620
Perhaps we could.

754
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:02,620
Oh boy, now I'm trying.

755
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:03,460
I don't know.

756
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:04,780
I'm not saying you're even involved in the saga.

757
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:06,420
I'm just saying we could turn it into a thing.

758
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:07,820
True, true.

759
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,100
Look Scott, Ohana means family

760
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:11,420
and family means no one gets left behind.

761
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:16,060
What's, is there a Hawaiian word for beer or wine?

762
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:16,900
That's what it'll be.

763
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,900
Oh, there's gotta be a Jurassic World beer

764
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,780
that they're introducing now with the new land.

765
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:21,620
Oh, I would hope.

766
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:22,940
This would change the equation.

767
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:25,260
Jurassic, I know we already said piss on the show.

768
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:26,100
A renal?

769
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,780
Jurassic piss, I was gonna like it's the piss

770
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:31,140
of a rare dinosaur.

771
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:33,820
Why, Savignon Brontosaur.

772
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:34,660
Oh yeah.

773
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:35,980
They haven't really touched on the idea

774
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:37,460
in any of the movies of someone

775
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:40,180
wanting to eat the dinosaurs, right?

776
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:41,020
You know what?

777
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:42,980
That feels like a missed opportunity.

778
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:43,820
Let's get on the call.

779
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:45,860
Let's get on the phone with Trevorrow and let's see.

780
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:48,260
Maybe we can get that idea in four.

781
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,780
The eating the dinosaurs.

782
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:53,540
There's like some rich guys that wanna eat the dinosaurs

783
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:54,940
and that's the whole movie.

784
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:56,980
Jason's smiling.

785
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:58,940
They didn't work as weapons and they didn't work as pets

786
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:00,660
but now another auction.

787
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:04,820
We will be auctioning them these dinosaurs to be cubed

788
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:07,340
and prepared for your enjoyment.

789
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:09,020
And it's just a movie about people eating them.

790
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:11,180
It's not even like a scary adventure movie.

791
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:13,580
It's just rich weirdos.

792
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:15,740
It's like Chef.

793
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:17,580
It's like Jon Favreau's Chef.

794
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:19,740
It does sound like a realistic entry

795
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:24,940
in the strangest blockbuster franchise that has ever existed.

796
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:27,620
One has a woman being murdered for no reason.

797
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:31,380
Two is two movies split down the middle.

798
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:32,220
All right.

799
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,540
Do it fairly related films.

800
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:36,300
Gymnastics plays a heavy role.

801
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:38,300
No, we're talking about.

802
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:40,980
He's talking about the Jurassic World franchise.

803
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,220
World not park.

804
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:44,380
Yes, that's true too though.

805
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:46,580
I like Jurassic World too.

806
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:49,380
It does become like a Jurassic Park movie.

807
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:51,780
Halfway through it becomes a haunted house movie.

808
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:57,140
I didn't watch the entire thing so I can't.

809
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:58,740
I kind of enjoyed the auction.

810
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:00,060
I'll say that.

811
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:03,220
Well, the fourth one will be hopefully Jason starring

812
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:05,900
and he'll be dining on a T-Rex.

813
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,980
Succulent, delicious.

814
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:09,500
I'll be doing a voice in the movie as well.

815
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,380
I've eaten every animal on this earth

816
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:14,420
and now I can finally say I ate the ones

817
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:15,980
on a prehistoric earth.

818
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:18,700
What if it's like you playing like the owner of Jimmy John's

819
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,900
and you hunt them for sport and then you eat them

820
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:23,260
or then you sell them in your restaurant.

821
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,100
Oh, that'd be great.

822
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:27,060
Jimmy John's number like 20 is a dinosaur sub.

823
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:29,980
A scene standing on the back of an open air Jeep

824
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:33,420
going like, this is gonna be number 22.

825
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:36,780
We got like 10 different names we're trying to settle on

826
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:39,580
where they're yelling over like the helicopter noise

827
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:40,860
and the car noise.

828
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:43,420
Rice seratops will pair great on a sandwich

829
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:44,700
with Swiss cheese.

830
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,420
Perhaps sauerkraut.

831
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:51,540
I don't think once we do this we're gonna be losing

832
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:53,740
so no one's gonna be buying turkey toms

833
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:55,340
once we introduce this.

834
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:57,980
T-Rex toms?

835
00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:00,380
T-Rex toms, that's on the list, trust me.

836
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:05,260
It's all about you crushing togos into the ground.

837
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:06,100
Yeah.

838
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:07,900
Sweet, sweet dinosaur meat.

839
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:10,100
People are trying to be the first now to like CBD

840
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:12,660
and like vegan burgers but the Jimmy John's franchise

841
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:14,700
is trying to get the dinosaur first.

842
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,420
Trying to beat their competition.

843
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:18,140
Sure, there's probably a way to clone them

844
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:20,380
to where they have CBD blood also.

845
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:22,380
Oh yeah, that's Jason's dream.

846
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,220
Happy grade.

847
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:26,780
Their meat kills you up and their blood gets you high.

848
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:28,500
The ultimate animal.

849
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,980
Gosh, culture viral, we'll talk to him right after this.

850
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:33,660
I think you would buy every one of these ideas.

851
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:35,180
Oh my God.

852
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:37,580
And can we add a strange molestation plot?

853
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:40,420
Then I'm very sold.

854
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:43,140
That's a Book of Henry reference.

855
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:45,300
Yes, I didn't bring up molestation for no reason.

856
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:47,540
That was a reference to the film The Book of Henry

857
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:48,380
but you know that.

858
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:50,860
Just in case you haven't seen it, we know you have.

859
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:53,780
That is a spoiler about The Book of Henry.

860
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:56,860
There's a lot of spoilers I guess in this episode to give.

861
00:31:56,860 --> 00:32:01,140
The whole movie is spoiled like a spoiled egg or food.

862
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:01,980
One thing.

863
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,660
I was gonna say.

864
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:05,500
It's tainted meat.

865
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,780
One of the one Guardian's characters

866
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:11,780
that's not on the ride is one of your favorite characters

867
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:14,860
from Book of Henry, Dr. David Daniels.

868
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:15,900
Oh yes.

869
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:16,740
He plays Ronan.

870
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:18,100
Dr. David Daniels.

871
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:20,020
Hello, I'm Dr. David Daniels.

872
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:22,620
A normal character who seems to have wandered in

873
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:23,940
from a different movie.

874
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:28,060
He's wandered in from a soap opera from 1988.

875
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:28,900
Yeah.

876
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:31,460
He's Ronan the Accuser in The Guardians

877
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:33,220
and Guardians 1 and Captain Marvel

878
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:34,180
but he's not on the ride.

879
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:36,620
So that's, I would have pointed,

880
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:37,780
too bad is what I'm saying.

881
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:41,860
Very low in Lee Pace content.

882
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:46,860
Who also is in, he's Marmaduke's owner in Marmaduke

883
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:51,140
and there is a part where Marmaduke farts

884
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:54,740
and he says, oh Marmaduke, what did you eat?

885
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:59,700
I hope that's clip number one and Lee Pace is acting real.

886
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:00,540
I hope that that's.

887
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:01,700
Oh he doesn't need a reel.

888
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:04,020
He's a pretty prominent performer.

889
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:05,420
I hope though he appears on the,

890
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:09,300
I assume the Toon Lagoon new e-ticket Marmaduke ride

891
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:11,700
that is coming soon to Islands of Adventure.

892
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,140
Can you imagine?

893
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:15,740
It's a screen ride, the most realistic.

894
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:17,260
Yeah, photo reel.

895
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:19,620
You could see every fur follicle.

896
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:21,340
You can smell the farts.

897
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:23,700
You are Marmaduke and then Lee Pace just scolds you

898
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:25,580
through the whole ride.

899
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:26,860
Look what you did.

900
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:29,740
You're going on a different diet.

901
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:32,020
I don't wanna smell another fart around here.

902
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:33,020
Now we're describing it.

903
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:34,140
This is like a nightmare.

904
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:35,500
This is a dream you would have.

905
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:36,820
Yeah, that really.

906
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:39,820
I'm Marmaduke and Lee Pace is yelling at me.

907
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:42,180
It's Spider-Man Transformers ride vehicle.

908
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:44,980
That technology but with just scenes

909
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:46,300
of Lee Pace in a kitchen.

910
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,980
And this is your nightmare because you want rides

911
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:49,780
where characters say that they're proud of you.

912
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:50,620
Yes.

913
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:52,860
So a ride where a character scolds you.

914
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:53,700
I don't like it.

915
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:54,540
Bad dog.

916
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:57,380
Is the ride vehicle simulating that you are Marmaduke?

917
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:58,220
Is that what you're saying?

918
00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:59,420
It's Marmaduke's head.

919
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:03,660
So at some point we would use the however many degrees

920
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:08,140
of movement to sit on Lee Pace.

921
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:08,980
Wonderful.

922
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:09,820
We'll sit on him because he's a Marmaduke.

923
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:10,660
I love it.

924
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:11,940
Famously a giant dog.

925
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:12,780
Giant dog.

926
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:14,180
Not as big as Clifford but pretty big

927
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:16,740
when you consider the sizes of normal dogs.

928
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:19,580
Bigger than a Beethoven.

929
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:20,420
For sure.

930
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:22,740
The point of a Beethoven is that he's very big.

931
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:23,580
Holy shit.

932
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:26,860
How has there never been a Marmaduke versus Beethoven movie?

933
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:27,700
Oh man.

934
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:29,540
We are giving away too many good movies.

935
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:31,340
We gotta keep these in our pocket.

936
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:34,420
That would tear apart the straight to video market.

937
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:37,340
There'd be 10 of those within three years.

938
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:39,980
And then Clifford shows up in the post credit scene.

939
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:45,940
I'm forming a team of big dogs.

940
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:50,060
Large dogs all unite to save the world.

941
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,900
My different voice is very sad.

942
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,700
I think you could also do it like the one Fancy.

943
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:56,660
Oh no, it's McGruff.

944
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:59,900
Oh, I'm putting a team together.

945
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,900
I'm putting a team together.

946
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,540
But pee in this cup first.

947
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:05,140
Let me make sure you're clean.

948
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:07,700
I think you marry ideas like the one Fast and the Furious

949
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:10,020
post credit sequence where they're like,

950
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:12,260
we just got some weird news.

951
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:13,940
And then they put down a file folder

952
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:15,740
and it's Michelle Rodriguez's character

953
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:19,060
you think died in the last movie but she's still alive.

954
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:20,940
But like we're off putting down a folder

955
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:22,620
with Clifford's picture of like,

956
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,540
this son of a bitch is still kicking.

957
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:28,740
He's managed to hide even though he's very big.

958
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:32,540
He got big, I suspect he got big

959
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:36,020
off of performance enhancing drugs.

960
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:39,500
McGruff and Clifford is the next Topps and Shaw.

961
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:40,340
Yeah.

962
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:41,700
It's gonna make.

963
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:44,420
We've already got sub franchises.

964
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:48,260
Oh, the big dog cinematic universe.

965
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:50,940
And everyone can wear those shirts too.

966
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:51,860
I was gonna say East Tech.

967
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:55,260
East Tech and CGH, canine growth hormone.

968
00:35:58,260 --> 00:35:59,580
Ah, yeah.

969
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:03,260
He's hopped up on dog smack and he's ready to bite.

970
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:04,460
But not crime.

971
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:06,180
There should be a song. He's biting your bones.

972
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:08,940
These dogs are all too fucking big.

973
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:11,500
We need to take him down a peg.

974
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:13,580
I like this, this is good.

975
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:16,380
I really like it. I love it.

976
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:18,100
Yeah, maybe we need to put our heads together.

977
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:22,260
I mean, as franchise culture gets weirder and decays,

978
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:23,700
I think this is maybe our only ticket

979
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:25,660
is to start just grabbing properties.

980
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:27,980
And ride them into hell.

981
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:29,820
Just all the way down the tunnel of.

982
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:32,420
If anyone would let properties be insane,

983
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:36,780
I would be pitching all the time, but I'm just.

984
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:37,700
People are too scared.

985
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:38,900
That's the thing.

986
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:42,940
The Marvel and DC universes are so fucking bonkers

987
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:44,660
because they've had to publish

988
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:47,780
however many dozens of comics every month

989
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:51,980
since the 40s and later the 50s and 60s.

990
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:54,260
But just years and there's decades and decades

991
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:56,180
of oddities and weirdness.

992
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:59,180
And they barely scratched the surface in these movies.

993
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:00,740
I get the sense I read that.

994
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:02,780
We're about to see this end game tonight.

995
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:03,980
Very excited about it.

996
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,620
I kind of feel like it might be weird.

997
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:09,260
I think I read it might be weird.

998
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:10,740
I'm hoping it's very weird.

999
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:13,260
This is the general narrative as a Marvel outsider.

1000
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:15,100
The narrative is that the comics are weirder

1001
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,460
than the movies have gotten to be.

1002
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:17,940
And you like Marvel as kids

1003
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:19,700
because maybe it's weirder than DC.

1004
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:20,540
And that's what you're.

1005
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:22,140
That's like what you're.

1006
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:22,980
Is that vaguely correct?

1007
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:24,100
They're both weird.

1008
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:27,460
Both weird more real.

1009
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:31,420
Marvel got the Marvel boom in the 60s was like,

1010
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:33,820
this guy's a regular guy who gets powers.

1011
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:35,540
Peter Parker's a regular teenager.

1012
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:37,020
He's got regular teenage problems.

1013
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:38,660
The X-Men are teenagers.

1014
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:39,980
They're outcast.

1015
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:41,860
There was more personality in the books.

1016
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:45,100
Stan Lee, I think whether he stole everything

1017
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:47,580
from Kirby and Ditko, which probably,

1018
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:49,700
whether he did that or not,

1019
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:52,260
the one thing I think you cannot take away from him

1020
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:54,500
is that his personality was in the books.

1021
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:59,140
So there was a kind of a fun tone overall,

1022
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:02,660
the whole that still is kind of on the line to this day.

1023
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:05,780
And I think that like sort of like that personality

1024
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:08,820
was a big part of like why I found it

1025
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:10,020
a little more accessible.

1026
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:10,860
Yeah, sure.

1027
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:12,220
Because like DC I think was not,

1028
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:14,500
I mean, you can find versions of everything now

1029
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:15,660
because there's been so many comics.

1030
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,420
It was just a little stiffer, a little safer.

1031
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:20,700
Now DC comics, especially in the 50s were plenty weird

1032
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:21,740
and looking back on them,

1033
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:24,460
the more stiffness of the stories and the art

1034
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:26,300
only enhances the weirdness.

1035
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:28,700
So it is like different flavors.

1036
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:30,260
Yeah.

1037
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:32,540
So the story I've heard is that

1038
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:36,780
even though Stan Lee stole before all that,

1039
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:39,820
he, Clifford was stolen from him.

1040
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:40,780
It was his idea.

1041
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:43,660
So it was like kind of his retribution to

1042
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:46,300
his million dollar ticket was ripped from his hands.

1043
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:49,580
So that's the weirdest idea ever conceived.

1044
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:50,420
Cycles of abuse.

1045
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:52,300
So you repeat the abuse that was done to you.

1046
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:54,500
Yeah, it's almost like he couldn't help it.

1047
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,740
But you still can't forgive him.

1048
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:58,780
No, no, no, of course not.

1049
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:02,060
Well, what do we do?

1050
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:03,300
Should we take a quick break?

1051
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,460
Well, we got a little thing.

1052
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:05,900
Let's talk about this real quick

1053
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,900
and then we'll take a little break before the mail.

1054
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:08,860
There's one little quick thing.

1055
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:13,060
It's not, look, this story doesn't have a satisfying ending.

1056
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:15,420
But so we've been talking for a while.

1057
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:17,980
There's an organization called the Tias.

1058
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:20,300
Oh no.

1059
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:22,420
Yeah, Scott knows sort of where we're going here.

1060
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:23,700
And they have an award show.

1061
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:26,140
And this is for like basically a theme park organization.

1062
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:27,140
It's a trade group.

1063
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:28,700
Trade group, thank you.

1064
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:31,700
And they have an award show called the Theas,

1065
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:34,060
which is a thing they host every year

1066
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:35,540
at usually the Disneyland Hotel.

1067
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,140
I think it's probably been there every year.

1068
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:38,020
I like that.

1069
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:39,380
And that's fun.

1070
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:42,140
And I think, oh, a year ago, I started saying,

1071
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:43,660
the three of us should host the Theas.

1072
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:44,500
Ha ha, that's funny.

1073
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:45,860
That's a funny joke or whatever.

1074
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:48,700
And some people maybe said, don't do it.

1075
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:49,540
It's too long.

1076
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:50,360
It's too boring.

1077
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,780
What are you doing wasting your time?

1078
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:53,500
That didn't dissuade me at all, of course.

1079
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:56,180
But see, I heard that part.

1080
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:57,900
That part rang true to me.

1081
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:59,220
But let's hear it.

1082
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:00,060
What's the plan for you?

1083
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:01,620
But again, there's parallels in comics

1084
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:03,460
because the Eisner Awards,

1085
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:05,820
the sort of Oscars of the comic book industry

1086
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:08,900
has over the years got added more entertainers

1087
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:11,060
and comedians as presenters

1088
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:12,900
and sort of livened it up a little.

1089
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:14,660
And the Golden Globes were very stiff

1090
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:17,420
until that rascal Ricky Gervais showed up

1091
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:19,540
and took a piss all over all of it.

1092
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:22,580
This motherfucker doesn't even believe in God.

1093
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:23,660
He's nothing sacred.

1094
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:25,140
Wild, he's wild.

1095
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:28,860
So a couple months ago, I just said,

1096
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:30,620
okay, maybe we're not gonna host this year.

1097
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:32,020
Not this year.

1098
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:34,300
But you know, podcast the right, we have listeners.

1099
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:37,180
We have some, I'd like to think we maybe have some influence

1100
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:40,060
or there's a value to bringing us somewhere.

1101
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:42,500
So I emailed the Theas.

1102
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:45,020
And I said. And we got a one sheet, you know?

1103
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:47,100
We've got a professional presentation.

1104
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:50,460
We've got logos, t-shirts, a little write-up, GQ.

1105
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:53,060
GQ Magazine, Wired Magazine.

1106
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:54,420
Old media, baby.

1107
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:58,820
Yeah, we got that PR guy who we pay so much money to.

1108
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:02,140
We're really taking a bath paying Jacob.

1109
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:04,180
Jacob is. But he's got hustle.

1110
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:05,220
Working hard.

1111
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:08,220
He can't get us in a Knott's Berry farm.

1112
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:10,300
He's a little bit of a defensive from Broadway World.

1113
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:12,580
Jacob on staff at Broadway World.

1114
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:16,140
Now he's full-time podcast writer, PR guy.

1115
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,980
And we were sent back a very, so yeah, just saying,

1116
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:20,340
hey, you know, we're a podcast.

1117
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:22,780
We'd love to come and cover the Theas.

1118
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:27,340
And we were sent an email that I would call insulting.

1119
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:28,700
Maybe, Kurt.

1120
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:30,260
Well, you just threw out, hey, what's up?

1121
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:31,180
I'm good, what's going on?

1122
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:32,500
We wanna host your Theas, okay?

1123
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:33,340
I didn't say host.

1124
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:34,420
This was just a cover.

1125
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:36,100
I just said, you know, we'd love to come out.

1126
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:37,420
Okay, okay, okay.

1127
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:38,820
You take up seats.

1128
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:41,540
And these seats cost a great deal.

1129
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:43,060
$500.

1130
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:46,060
They're going on expense accounts, you know?

1131
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:47,420
Companies are writing them off.

1132
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:49,100
Here's the way I figure it.

1133
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:52,060
Who's going down to cover Theas?

1134
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:56,660
So this is the audience of nerds and theme park people

1135
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:59,140
who would be like, oh, you know, there's this award show

1136
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:01,060
and it recognizes stuff that we all like.

1137
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:01,900
So in my mind.

1138
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:05,740
This place that sells $500 banquet seats easily

1139
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:08,340
for many decades in a row needs our help.

1140
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:09,340
Needs our help, yes.

1141
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:12,820
Sure, trade groups famously love publicity

1142
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:15,780
about their day-to-day operations.

1143
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:18,620
But we were told that our podcast is probably,

1144
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:21,500
they don't think it's a good match for the Thea Awards.

1145
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:24,180
Faster than a Jack-Jack,

1146
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:28,940
faster than Jack-Jack taking off on the credit coaster.

1147
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:31,820
We got a response saying, thanks, but no.

1148
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:33,020
Jeez. Yeah, yeah.

1149
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:36,140
So basically, so again, this doesn't have a good,

1150
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:37,260
this story doesn't have a good ending.

1151
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:39,220
But. Oh, it's very sad.

1152
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:41,180
Was it two Saturdays ago?

1153
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:43,060
Yeah. Two Saturdays ago,

1154
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:46,380
Lindsay had something to do

1155
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:48,860
and Jason and I. Had nothing.

1156
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:50,500
Had nothing to do.

1157
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:51,900
So we went down to the parks

1158
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:53,780
the day the Thea Awards were happening.

1159
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:55,900
Oh, oh.

1160
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:57,140
And we staked it out.

1161
00:42:57,140 --> 00:42:59,820
We did not wear tuxes like I wanted to

1162
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:01,620
and try to sneak in,

1163
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:03,380
which I know is not good boy behavior,

1164
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:05,260
but I felt this since this email,

1165
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:08,100
it would be like cosmically like us getting to see the show

1166
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:11,780
would be, would make up for the sting of this painful email.

1167
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:14,300
So we just kind of like hung out.

1168
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:17,380
So it was basically in like, I guess it's the main ballroom.

1169
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:20,100
When we saw there was one security guard

1170
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:22,900
standing outside the Thea Awards, like,

1171
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:24,180
and we were like, that's right in there

1172
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:26,820
because you saw people in gowns and tuxes.

1173
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:29,260
This is no, this is no goof around.

1174
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:30,500
This is a real life.

1175
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:33,620
And to paint a picture directly next door

1176
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:35,540
was the Dapper Days convention.

1177
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:38,140
Yes. So people selling like,

1178
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:41,820
so you had classic evening, like tuxedos and gowns.

1179
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:46,820
And then next to it, like suspenders and poodle skirts

1180
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:51,020
and bow tie, like the Dapper Day kind of look.

1181
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:53,460
We met a guy, we met a listener who was down there.

1182
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:54,500
Yes, who was down for Dapper Day.

1183
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:55,340
Dapper Days.

1184
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:56,540
He gave us a little hack too,

1185
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:59,540
is that the hotels are a discount

1186
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:01,420
if you go through like a certain,

1187
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:03,260
like a trade show or an expo.

1188
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:04,300
You get a discount.

1189
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:07,900
So if you were in Dapper Day tickets are like $15 or $10.

1190
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:09,780
Yeah, and he got an insane discount

1191
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:11,620
on these like hotel rooms.

1192
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:13,380
I was like, oh, that is a good little hack.

1193
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:14,740
Okay.

1194
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:16,500
So we, as I think as we were coming in,

1195
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:18,900
I wasn't sure if the people with the curly mustaches

1196
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:22,220
and the like hat, the cabby hats were for the Thea's

1197
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:23,780
or for Dapper, then we figured out

1198
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:25,460
there were two separate things going on.

1199
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:28,020
Yes, the Thea's were much more square.

1200
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:32,500
Yeah, but I would say like there was a room,

1201
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:33,740
you could see there was a room

1202
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:35,260
where they had like a reception area

1203
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:36,580
and then the actual ballroom,

1204
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:38,820
I think where the awards took place.

1205
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:40,820
And after the awards were over,

1206
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:43,140
they were pumping loud music.

1207
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:47,020
There was a loud thump thump, four on the floor beats,

1208
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:48,500
modern music coming out of there.

1209
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:50,660
So I think there were some people that were still partying.

1210
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:53,340
Yeah, but that was the official like cast party.

1211
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:55,660
The real cast parties are elsewhere.

1212
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:56,500
Well, sure.

1213
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:57,540
You know how it is.

1214
00:44:57,540 --> 00:45:00,220
The other kids, I know some of you are listening.

1215
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:05,220
So what happened was we were walking around

1216
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:06,300
and all of a sudden like,

1217
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:09,380
so basically what is Jason's pass is blacked out that day.

1218
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:10,220
Yes.

1219
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:11,220
Mine is not.

1220
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:12,540
I did the Scott Gierdner trick,

1221
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:14,380
went to the monorail and out

1222
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:16,100
and started racking up fast passes

1223
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:17,460
while Jason and I were eating dinner.

1224
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:18,380
But have I said what I learned,

1225
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:21,540
which is that then you can't go into Disneyland after?

1226
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:23,860
I got in weird trouble from that.

1227
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:26,020
If you do that, then the next park you enter

1228
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:27,100
has to be California Adventure.

1229
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:27,940
That's interesting.

1230
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:29,340
Because it's like you entered the park twice

1231
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:31,020
and that throws off the system.

1232
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:32,260
So be careful with that.

1233
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:33,100
Oh, interesting.

1234
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:33,940
But anyway.

1235
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:36,300
I've done that, but it's only been just by happenstance,

1236
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:37,300
California Adventure.

1237
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:38,340
I've done it like within,

1238
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:40,500
I somehow got from one to the other in 10 minutes

1239
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:43,380
and they're like, wait a minute, you're already here.

1240
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:45,060
Wait, I went in and out.

1241
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:45,900
Wait, stand here.

1242
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:47,740
What like a person was called over.

1243
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:48,580
It was horrible.

1244
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:49,420
Wow, really?

1245
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:50,260
Yeah, yeah.

1246
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:51,100
So just be careful with that.

1247
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:51,940
Okay, good school California Adventure.

1248
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:52,980
I guess so.

1249
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:55,340
So then we went back and,

1250
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:56,300
I mean, long story short,

1251
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:58,820
because this episode is already long,

1252
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:02,420
the after party is at Trader Sam's.

1253
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:04,900
And the newly expanded Tangeroa Terrace

1254
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:06,860
featuring an outdoor bar patio.

1255
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:10,220
Basically Jason and I sat and one of us stood,

1256
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:11,060
because there was no room,

1257
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:13,700
with in the middle of,

1258
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:18,700
I don't want to say, maybe a 75 to 100 tuxedo gowns,

1259
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:23,100
Imagineer theme park related industry people

1260
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:25,260
all having like a celebratory drink

1261
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:28,660
or wallowing and losing drink.

1262
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:31,660
And very quickly realized anyone in this organization

1263
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:34,540
who has listened to our show and sent us a nice email

1264
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:38,060
is far too young and does not get to use the expense account

1265
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:39,540
to travel to Anaheim.

1266
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:40,940
That sort of, because like, look,

1267
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:42,940
Jason and I were really hoping

1268
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:46,100
that there would be like some people who have messages

1269
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:48,100
over the last year and a half of like,

1270
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:49,100
oh wow or whatever.

1271
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:52,340
And then we'd be invited to some secret like cabal,

1272
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:54,700
some secret Imagineer after party.

1273
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:58,020
That's how we did round a corner and run face,

1274
00:46:58,020 --> 00:47:00,420
almost smack dab into the people,

1275
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:02,740
the women behind the Disneyland foodies account.

1276
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:03,580
Oh yeah, yeah.

1277
00:47:03,580 --> 00:47:05,700
That was very nice to talk to them for a while.

1278
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:06,820
Yeah, that was very nice.

1279
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:08,660
They were not there for the theists.

1280
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:12,220
They were there for just having a good time at Disney.

1281
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:14,140
But I think, yeah, we, at least my-

1282
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:14,980
Guys, cut to the,

1283
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:17,180
which Imagineers did you hook up with?

1284
00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:19,020
I don't know.

1285
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:19,860
Jason and Bob Gurr.

1286
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:21,060
I mean, those are little details.

1287
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:22,940
Jason and Bob Gurr went back.

1288
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:28,820
I hooked up with a delicious Steakhouse 55 cheeseburger.

1289
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:29,660
Oh nice.

1290
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:31,500
That might be the best burger on prop.

1291
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:32,500
Delicious. Really?

1292
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:33,340
I would've known that.

1293
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:36,020
With like fried potato, like wonderful.

1294
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:39,380
Yeah, I had Nashville hot chicken.

1295
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:40,580
Yeah. Which was really good.

1296
00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:42,220
And you can get this in the, we were in the bar.

1297
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:43,220
We were just eating in the bar.

1298
00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:44,060
So basically-

1299
00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:46,580
With some people from Pasadena who were getting hammered

1300
00:47:46,580 --> 00:47:48,380
and just kept getting weirder and weirder

1301
00:47:48,380 --> 00:47:49,340
as the meal went on.

1302
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:51,260
I of course had two complaints then,

1303
00:47:51,260 --> 00:47:52,380
sort of at the end of the night.

1304
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:56,420
Basically that we were not involved in Intuxas

1305
00:47:56,420 --> 00:47:59,620
and two that we were not having the fun

1306
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:01,340
of the people that were there.

1307
00:48:01,340 --> 00:48:06,340
So next year, I'm not saying we have to host,

1308
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:11,580
but we have to at least present, do a bit in the show.

1309
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:13,700
There's gotta be some involvement here.

1310
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:15,340
We have to call on the listeners to,

1311
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:18,780
I don't wanna say bombard the theists, the Tia award.

1312
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:19,900
I don't wanna bother them.

1313
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:21,460
But in a nice say, you know what?

1314
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:24,500
We love themed entertainment.

1315
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:27,180
These are the king, these three gentlemen are the kings.

1316
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:30,180
They would plus up this event like nothing else.

1317
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:31,020
The original kings.

1318
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:33,700
We are wearing comically oversized suits.

1319
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:34,540
Yes.

1320
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:36,340
The original kings of theme park comedy.

1321
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:39,740
The original kings of theme park comedy.

1322
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:41,860
I think that's right actually.

1323
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:43,820
I don't think there's any dispute to that.

1324
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:44,660
So-

1325
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:45,820
Jason the entertainer.

1326
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:46,660
Oh God.

1327
00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:47,580
Rest in peace.

1328
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:52,580
Wait no, Bernie Mac's the one who passed away.

1329
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:53,420
Oh.

1330
00:48:53,420 --> 00:48:54,260
Jesus, Jason.

1331
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:55,740
But it's the entertainer ultimately

1332
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:56,580
when things come to that.

1333
00:48:56,580 --> 00:48:58,420
I hope you're all in peace.

1334
00:48:58,420 --> 00:48:59,540
Yes, hope we all do.

1335
00:48:59,540 --> 00:49:00,380
All of us.

1336
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:02,660
So we'll be involved next year.

1337
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:04,860
That is my hope because it honestly,

1338
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:07,740
I was jealous of the fun these Tuxedo people were having.

1339
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:08,580
And I said, wouldn't it be great

1340
00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:10,180
if we were having this fun too?

1341
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:11,700
And wouldn't it be great if everyone knew us

1342
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:12,540
and thought we were great?

1343
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:14,380
And I said, I don't know.

1344
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:15,820
If everyone knew us and thought we were great.

1345
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:16,660
That's what I was feeling.

1346
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:17,500
Well sure.

1347
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:20,380
But you're saying we're having fun

1348
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:22,940
but we're not having their fun two feet over.

1349
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:24,860
I had a lovely evening with my friend Michael

1350
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:26,180
and a terrific meal.

1351
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:27,020
Really good.

1352
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:28,180
Yeah, it'd be coming to a close.

1353
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:31,860
I'm gonna say next year, I wanna be in a Tuxedo.

1354
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:34,020
I wanna be getting, I wanna be people coming up

1355
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:37,660
and going, that bit you guys did was so great.

1356
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:42,060
How did you get that cameo from Jeff Garland?

1357
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:43,660
How did, how?

1358
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:44,740
Wow, that's so great.

1359
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:45,580
You guys are great.

1360
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:46,540
Hey. From Hondo.

1361
00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:48,380
Let me. You got the real Hondo.

1362
00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:49,820
Hey, do you wanna design a,

1363
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:51,460
do you wanna design one of the rooms

1364
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:53,220
on the new Avengers coaster?

1365
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:54,820
Like an arm around me, you know?

1366
00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:56,540
Which character do you want in there, huh?

1367
00:49:56,540 --> 00:49:58,020
Which X-Men? Hey, there's a country,

1368
00:49:58,020 --> 00:49:59,380
well it doesn't exist yet

1369
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:01,220
cause it's still being coup d'etat

1370
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:02,500
but they got a lot of money

1371
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:04,900
for a little bit of time to build a theme park.

1372
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:06,260
Yeah, that's right.

1373
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:07,100
Yeah, exactly.

1374
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:08,020
You know, but you guys,

1375
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:11,140
there's gonna be a Hanna-Barbera land in,

1376
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:13,460
there's a South America country, yeah,

1377
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:15,140
that we're building a whole theme park.

1378
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:17,260
Yeah, in the process of being co-opted and.

1379
00:50:17,260 --> 00:50:18,100
We're not sure, yeah.

1380
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:18,940
So you guys. We're building

1381
00:50:18,940 --> 00:50:21,500
a terminal ride in ironically a country

1382
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:24,620
that is going through a terminal sort of limbo.

1383
00:50:24,620 --> 00:50:25,820
Which Hanna-Barbera property?

1384
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:29,620
And I would say, well the Partridge family 2025

1385
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:30,980
from Hanna-Barbera's library.

1386
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:33,100
And they go, that sounds like a great idea here.

1387
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:34,980
You drop a plan and we'll do it.

1388
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:36,260
That's what I want next year.

1389
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:40,500
We're foreclosing Nicolas Cage's island for tax evasion

1390
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:42,460
and we're building a theme park there.

1391
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:44,260
That's all I want.

1392
00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:45,820
And you can build a new Marvel McFay.

1393
00:50:45,820 --> 00:50:49,900
The contract does say there has to be a Mandy ride.

1394
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:52,780
Mandy ride based on the recent movie.

1395
00:50:54,140 --> 00:50:55,500
Well, I like this,

1396
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:57,620
I think this threat is gonna get us in there.

1397
00:50:57,620 --> 00:50:59,220
And if they don't,

1398
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:00,540
if they don't let us in,

1399
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:02,860
then we're gonna go Sam Bee on their ass

1400
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:07,860
and do the Not Your Dads Thea Awards right next door.

1401
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:11,180
It's gonna be full of attitude and punk bands

1402
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:13,740
and we're gonna take the piss out of the Theas.

1403
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:15,260
Yeah, I agree.

1404
00:51:15,260 --> 00:51:17,220
All right, well we'll be right back.

1405
00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:18,900
You guys have a lot to think about.

1406
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:21,420
And we will get to some of your questions,

1407
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:22,980
like one or two.

1408
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:23,900
Oh, oh, oh.

1409
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:28,820
Oh, oh, oh.

1410
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:34,100
All right, we are back and we're finally ready

1411
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:36,980
to make it not about us, but about you.

1412
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:38,780
We are taking some of your questions.

1413
00:51:38,780 --> 00:51:39,940
We just did a call on Twitter.

1414
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:41,580
Thank you for sending them.

1415
00:51:41,580 --> 00:51:43,260
And we have a lot in the archives.

1416
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:44,500
I'll always be sending.

1417
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:46,540
Send us a question every day.

1418
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:48,220
ABS, always be sending.

1419
00:51:48,220 --> 00:51:52,740
We will get to it sometime in the next eight years.

1420
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:54,620
But I'll be scouring the Twitter,

1421
00:51:54,620 --> 00:51:56,740
but I know you guys had some archive questions

1422
00:51:56,740 --> 00:51:59,620
that you were looking forward to bringing up

1423
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:01,700
and I'll look at the new stuff.

1424
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:03,260
Yeah, so there's a couple.

1425
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:04,420
Yeah, we had these a few months ago.

1426
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:05,900
We've called for questions before.

1427
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:07,780
These are old questions.

1428
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:10,260
This was an Instagram question.

1429
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:12,060
User thatpappy.

1430
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:14,660
And this is a little, we'll get into this

1431
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:16,540
when we do a full video, but I like this question.

1432
00:52:16,540 --> 00:52:19,020
What's the ideal Star Tours video order?

1433
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:20,980
Oh!

1434
00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:22,060
Which is a very fun, I think, question.

1435
00:52:22,060 --> 00:52:23,220
We don't have to say maybe why.

1436
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:25,260
Maybe we give a quick version and we can get into it more

1437
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:26,100
when we finally do Adventure Continues.

1438
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:26,940
Yeah, I know, I thought maybe we'd talk about this

1439
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:28,460
with Adventures Continue.

1440
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:29,300
But I mean.

1441
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:30,620
Yeah, just off the top of your head.

1442
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:35,620
Off the top of my head, I like Kashyyyk,

1443
00:52:35,620 --> 00:52:39,900
the Wookie planet, and I like going to the Gungan city.

1444
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:40,740
Oh, and Naboo.

1445
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:41,580
Yes.

1446
00:52:41,580 --> 00:52:42,420
Yeah, I like that one.

1447
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:44,780
Is Wookie a first scene?

1448
00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:45,620
Yes.

1449
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:47,980
Yeah, so I'd go with that.

1450
00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:50,940
Or Padre, Padre's pretty fun.

1451
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:52,820
Maybe Wookie though, because when he gets stuck to the,

1452
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:54,100
it's really fun.

1453
00:52:54,100 --> 00:52:59,100
I want BB-8 in the middle, or Yoda, I think.

1454
00:53:01,540 --> 00:53:05,460
And yeah, I like Gungan, I really do.

1455
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:10,500
I'm not one of these I like Jar Jar now people.

1456
00:53:12,220 --> 00:53:17,220
But that planet is so fun, and the spike of the boat ship

1457
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:22,020
hitting you, breaking the glass at the end.

1458
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:23,820
And I didn't realize until recently there's another one

1459
00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:24,660
where it doesn't break.

1460
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:28,500
That's why I didn't realize it until like six months ago.

1461
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:29,340
Wow.

1462
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:30,180
Oh yeah.

1463
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:31,020
It blew my mind.

1464
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:34,060
You know, I think they did a good job with the,

1465
00:53:34,060 --> 00:53:35,180
it wouldn't be my ideal.

1466
00:53:36,020 --> 00:53:39,620
I got a little tired of the red salt planet,

1467
00:53:39,620 --> 00:53:42,060
but I think they did a good job with that world.

1468
00:53:43,340 --> 00:53:48,260
And I got that in Japan, but then the Galaxy's Edge

1469
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:51,340
set up scene in Japan where they are not getting

1470
00:53:51,340 --> 00:53:54,500
Galaxy's Edge, it was very off putting.

1471
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:58,380
I guess it's still promoting tourism to the other spots.

1472
00:53:58,380 --> 00:54:01,380
But I like that little scene, that gives you a nice little.

1473
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:02,220
Oh, I love that scene.

1474
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:03,060
I like that.

1475
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:04,940
But yeah, that's my ideal order I think.

1476
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:10,700
I like Jakku, where you're tracing the Falcon

1477
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:12,420
through all the wreckage and stuff

1478
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:14,180
from Force Awakens and stuff.

1479
00:54:15,860 --> 00:54:16,700
Yeah, I don't know.

1480
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:21,300
I like acknowledging the mythology of the prequels.

1481
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:23,100
Whether you like the prequels or not,

1482
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:26,700
it does make it feel like a more lived in universe

1483
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:28,980
and stuff to go like, no, that exists.

1484
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:30,820
Definitely. That's canon.

1485
00:54:30,820 --> 00:54:33,860
That the one food stall coming to Galaxy's Edge

1486
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:35,740
is like, yeah, it's hot dogs cooked over

1487
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:37,460
an old pod racer engine.

1488
00:54:37,460 --> 00:54:38,980
It's like, I love it.

1489
00:54:38,980 --> 00:54:41,620
That's probably where I'm going first.

1490
00:54:41,620 --> 00:54:45,660
The lava planet in the void.

1491
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:47,380
The void, yeah, I love that.

1492
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:49,540
Mustafar, Mustafar, Vader's Castle.

1493
00:54:49,540 --> 00:54:50,380
So cool.

1494
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:54,700
Absolutely, they should keep prequel stuff alive

1495
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:58,300
and sort of like repurpose it and do something neat with it.

1496
00:54:58,300 --> 00:55:02,540
Yeah, but we'll hit adventures, continue in the near future.

1497
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:05,300
What else we got?

1498
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:07,100
I've got one.

1499
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:08,260
I selfishly picked this one

1500
00:55:08,260 --> 00:55:10,380
because I kind of have a story related to it.

1501
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:12,580
Michael Hidalgo emailed and asked,

1502
00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:15,460
ever gotten sick while on a long distance park trip?

1503
00:55:15,460 --> 00:55:18,020
I recently got hit with a stomach flu

1504
00:55:18,020 --> 00:55:20,820
while on a week long trip visiting Walt Disney World.

1505
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:24,100
In a similar situation, would you force yourself

1506
00:55:24,100 --> 00:55:26,820
to hit the parks or would you opt for comfort

1507
00:55:26,820 --> 00:55:29,100
and just take it easy back at the hotel?

1508
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:32,420
What do you think guys, this ever happened to you?

1509
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:35,620
I think luckily I have not gotten super sick

1510
00:55:35,620 --> 00:55:36,620
on a theme park trip.

1511
00:55:36,620 --> 00:55:39,780
As a child I got sick on the way back once.

1512
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:40,660
I was a little kid.

1513
00:55:40,660 --> 00:55:43,220
That's when I ate a corn dog and I threw up.

1514
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:45,900
And that's why I haven't had a corn dog since.

1515
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:48,300
Which I guess that's maybe my mountain to climb.

1516
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:52,580
Like Scott's drops and launches, I should eat a corn dog.

1517
00:55:52,580 --> 00:55:54,180
We should build up to me eating a corn dog.

1518
00:55:54,180 --> 00:55:55,500
Oh, you swore off corn dogs, really?

1519
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:56,340
Yeah.

1520
00:55:56,340 --> 00:55:57,900
But it was just like, as a kid you were like,

1521
00:55:57,900 --> 00:55:59,540
oh, I don't like corn dogs, they make me throw up.

1522
00:55:59,540 --> 00:56:01,740
But it's like, it's fried hot dog.

1523
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:04,820
I've never been a fan of corn dogs my whole life,

1524
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:07,860
despite no sickness related to it.

1525
00:56:07,860 --> 00:56:12,180
But I, boy, the Frontierland corn dogs,

1526
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:14,580
I only recently started doing in Disneyland

1527
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:15,420
and they're fantastic.

1528
00:56:15,420 --> 00:56:16,380
Disneyland corn dogs, right.

1529
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:18,380
Yeah, that'd be the one to start with I think.

1530
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:22,140
I did get kind of sick once.

1531
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:24,820
Well, myself and my brother,

1532
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:27,220
my brother once when my family was down there in the summer

1533
00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:29,020
got very bad sunburned.

1534
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:31,980
I was like grounded for a day or so

1535
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:34,900
of like staying in the hotel room.

1536
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:39,900
My brother as a kid always got sunburned or sick on holidays.

1537
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:43,300
Like it became like a running joke in the family.

1538
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:46,220
I got sick once when I was a freshman in high school

1539
00:56:46,220 --> 00:56:47,420
when I was down there.

1540
00:56:47,420 --> 00:56:50,380
I think because I stressed myself out so much

1541
00:56:50,380 --> 00:56:52,020
that I wasn't gonna get everything done

1542
00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:53,340
I wanted to get done.

1543
00:56:53,340 --> 00:56:55,340
And it was the day that just me and my dad

1544
00:56:55,340 --> 00:56:58,500
were going to go from the Borwalk Hotel

1545
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:00,260
over to Islands of Adventure.

1546
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:02,660
But I just woke up feeling like death.

1547
00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:04,980
And I was like, no, we gotta go, we gotta go.

1548
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:07,980
And my parents are just like, go back to sleep.

1549
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:09,940
You're like in really bad shape.

1550
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:12,700
And then like, I think I just hadn't been sleep.

1551
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:15,780
I mean, just being like going from sunup to sundown.

1552
00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:20,220
And I got a few, I slept in until like a few hours

1553
00:57:20,220 --> 00:57:24,100
and then just had, just took it easy and had lunch.

1554
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:26,060
And then I was better and went the next day.

1555
00:57:26,060 --> 00:57:27,420
But it was like, I don't know,

1556
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:29,060
freshman year in high school sucked.

1557
00:57:29,060 --> 00:57:31,700
I think there was a lot mentally weighing on my mind.

1558
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:34,660
And I'm like, I have to have fun now

1559
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:37,020
because I have to go back to that fucking hell.

1560
00:57:38,660 --> 00:57:41,420
It wasn't even that bad of an experience

1561
00:57:41,420 --> 00:57:43,340
compared to some people's high school experience.

1562
00:57:43,340 --> 00:57:45,580
But it was still like, Jesus,

1563
00:57:45,580 --> 00:57:47,140
like I gotta blitz through all this

1564
00:57:47,140 --> 00:57:49,060
and knowing I had to go back to school the day

1565
00:57:49,060 --> 00:57:50,460
after we get back sucks.

1566
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:53,420
It's still not Disney world.

1567
00:57:53,420 --> 00:57:55,900
There was comfort that I took when leaving Tokyo.

1568
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:58,940
I was the saddest I've been since leaving Disney world

1569
00:57:58,940 --> 00:58:02,020
when I was seven where I just wept and wept.

1570
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:05,340
I was so, it was such an embarrassing crying show.

1571
00:58:05,340 --> 00:58:07,740
But I was really sad to leave Tokyo,

1572
00:58:07,740 --> 00:58:08,820
but I could take solace in,

1573
00:58:08,820 --> 00:58:11,540
you aren't going back to school right now.

1574
00:58:11,540 --> 00:58:13,980
You don't have to go back to second grade

1575
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:15,220
when you leave here.

1576
00:58:15,220 --> 00:58:17,460
It was nice to remind myself.

1577
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:18,740
But wait, was there a question related to that?

1578
00:58:18,740 --> 00:58:19,780
Like what would you do?

1579
00:58:19,780 --> 00:58:21,340
You could take it easy.

1580
00:58:21,340 --> 00:58:22,340
What is your opinion?

1581
00:58:22,340 --> 00:58:23,660
Would you take it easy a little

1582
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:25,500
or would you just power through?

1583
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:29,140
I would have to be real jacked up to not power through.

1584
00:58:29,140 --> 00:58:32,180
I would have to be like throwing up badly.

1585
00:58:32,180 --> 00:58:33,020
Excuse me.

1586
00:58:33,020 --> 00:58:34,740
Geez, I'd have to be like throwing,

1587
00:58:34,740 --> 00:58:35,580
I'm throwing up now.

1588
00:58:35,580 --> 00:58:36,420
As your throat starts to give out.

1589
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:37,580
I'm throwing up now.

1590
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:39,340
I'm gonna throw my gruff in there.

1591
00:58:39,340 --> 00:58:42,700
I did my gruff in a bit show a couple days ago

1592
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:44,740
and my throat has been different since.

1593
00:58:44,740 --> 00:58:46,060
Oh no.

1594
00:58:46,060 --> 00:58:48,860
So you did like a three minute character piece

1595
00:58:48,860 --> 00:58:50,740
and Scott went on a three minute ride

1596
00:58:50,740 --> 00:58:52,740
and you're both in bad shape.

1597
00:58:52,740 --> 00:58:53,580
Yes.

1598
00:58:54,460 --> 00:58:55,660
The 30s are great.

1599
00:58:55,660 --> 00:58:57,500
Your 30s, your body treats you.

1600
00:58:58,540 --> 00:58:59,860
This is so lame.

1601
00:59:00,860 --> 00:59:02,340
Because of the day,

1602
00:59:02,340 --> 00:59:04,620
I ate too many animals on 420

1603
00:59:04,620 --> 00:59:07,660
and it took me a couple of days to feel normal again.

1604
00:59:10,060 --> 00:59:12,740
I got that one day we'll tell the Vegas story

1605
00:59:12,740 --> 00:59:13,580
on a show or something.

1606
00:59:13,580 --> 00:59:15,060
The Vegas story is wild with you.

1607
00:59:15,060 --> 00:59:16,980
But I accidentally did that.

1608
00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:18,780
You have like two to three beers

1609
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:21,180
and your next two days are shot.

1610
00:59:21,180 --> 00:59:22,020
Yeah.

1611
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:23,500
It's crazy.

1612
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:25,100
We had one of the episodes earlier,

1613
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:26,620
our podcast The Ride, it was your birthday

1614
00:59:26,620 --> 00:59:29,340
and you had had three beers the night before

1615
00:59:29,340 --> 00:59:32,260
and it was the first time you were brutally late to record

1616
00:59:32,260 --> 00:59:34,180
and you were like jacked real fucked up.

1617
00:59:34,180 --> 00:59:35,020
Mad.

1618
00:59:35,020 --> 00:59:38,220
The last two birthdays we've recorded the morning after

1619
00:59:38,220 --> 00:59:39,940
and I've been in a bad way.

1620
00:59:39,940 --> 00:59:42,860
Again, three beers over five or six hours.

1621
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:43,700
Yeah.

1622
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:45,620
I'm getting to that point though.

1623
00:59:45,620 --> 00:59:48,940
My grand total, spread over eight hours yesterday

1624
00:59:48,940 --> 00:59:51,780
was three beers and two glasses of wine

1625
00:59:52,620 --> 00:59:54,220
and I was like, am I gonna have to cancel?

1626
00:59:54,220 --> 00:59:56,060
It's getting to that point.

1627
00:59:56,060 --> 00:59:59,820
And I'm feeling guardians still in my body.

1628
00:59:59,820 --> 01:00:04,100
I can't go quip on a chair for an hour and a half.

1629
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:07,460
Then there was just an ad on the Night Call podcast

1630
01:00:07,460 --> 01:00:09,740
where they were talking about some new supplement

1631
01:00:09,740 --> 01:00:11,340
that you can take before you go to bed

1632
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:13,820
after you've been drinking to prevent that sort of thing

1633
01:00:13,820 --> 01:00:15,900
and I'm like, I gotta go back and write that name down.

1634
01:00:15,900 --> 01:00:18,700
That might be a good thing to look into to use that code.

1635
01:00:18,700 --> 01:00:19,540
That's funny.

1636
01:00:20,460 --> 01:00:21,300
Yeah, I don't know.

1637
01:00:21,300 --> 01:00:22,140
That's a tough one.

1638
01:00:22,140 --> 01:00:22,980
I guess it depends.

1639
01:00:22,980 --> 01:00:24,860
If it's a crazy, if it's a place you don't think

1640
01:00:24,860 --> 01:00:27,380
you'll go back to if you haven't been there.

1641
01:00:27,380 --> 01:00:29,300
But also, so many of these places

1642
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:30,820
have nice resort property.

1643
01:00:30,820 --> 01:00:32,140
You gotta enjoy the pool.

1644
01:00:32,140 --> 01:00:34,820
I would just say then do a more mellow overt.

1645
01:00:34,820 --> 01:00:39,580
Don't do a jam it all into a front to close day.

1646
01:00:39,580 --> 01:00:41,020
Yeah, take it easy.

1647
01:00:41,020 --> 01:00:41,900
Watch what you're eating.

1648
01:00:41,900 --> 01:00:45,900
Oh, and also Disneyland has doctors on call

1649
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:48,540
and an urgent care practically on the property.

1650
01:00:48,540 --> 01:00:50,980
Universal has like at the concierge,

1651
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:54,420
they'll give you, there's phone numbers you can call

1652
01:00:54,420 --> 01:00:57,140
if you're down in Orlando on vacation and you're ill

1653
01:00:57,140 --> 01:00:59,500
and they will connect you with a doctor or a dentist

1654
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:03,300
because my dad had like a tooth like ache,

1655
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:06,180
like a bad tooth thing go and they were able to get him

1656
01:01:06,180 --> 01:01:07,700
an appointment the next morning

1657
01:01:07,700 --> 01:01:10,540
and at least get him antibiotics before he could get back

1658
01:01:10,540 --> 01:01:12,740
home and get the tooth pulled.

1659
01:01:12,740 --> 01:01:16,460
Was it like a character, was like Dr. Octopus who?

1660
01:01:16,460 --> 01:01:18,020
Oh, I wish, no.

1661
01:01:18,660 --> 01:01:20,820
It was just a friendly Orlando professional.

1662
01:01:20,820 --> 01:01:22,260
Right.

1663
01:01:22,260 --> 01:01:24,820
Yeah, so it's all, that's a case by case basis I think.

1664
01:01:24,820 --> 01:01:26,060
Yeah, take it easy.

1665
01:01:26,060 --> 01:01:29,220
If you're contagious, please quarantine yourself

1666
01:01:29,220 --> 01:01:30,060
to your hotel.

1667
01:01:30,060 --> 01:01:30,900
Oh yeah, don't go there.

1668
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:32,220
Wear the mask.

1669
01:01:32,220 --> 01:01:34,420
A lot of masks in Japan, they're probably smart.

1670
01:01:34,420 --> 01:01:35,260
Yeah.

1671
01:01:35,260 --> 01:01:36,100
Sure.

1672
01:01:36,100 --> 01:01:40,300
Here's a fun one from just on Twitter from Tyler Holtz.

1673
01:01:41,620 --> 01:01:43,060
I might be looking at the same one.

1674
01:01:43,060 --> 01:01:47,300
Bob Iger has retired and Bob Chapek is stepping down

1675
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:50,420
and they've chosen you three as successors

1676
01:01:50,420 --> 01:01:52,620
to head the theme Disney Parks division.

1677
01:01:52,620 --> 01:01:55,500
What is your first order of business?

1678
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:58,060
We'll talk about this at length at some point

1679
01:01:58,060 --> 01:01:59,660
but I've probably said it before and I'll say it again,

1680
01:01:59,660 --> 01:02:01,620
Autopia is gone.

1681
01:02:01,620 --> 01:02:04,500
No more Autopia, that is a day one decision

1682
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:08,140
and I recently thought of how to split that land up.

1683
01:02:08,140 --> 01:02:11,620
Half of it is Tron which also extends into where Carousel

1684
01:02:11,620 --> 01:02:13,140
is now, that's gone too.

1685
01:02:13,140 --> 01:02:16,420
The other half Matterhorn perfectly transitions

1686
01:02:16,420 --> 01:02:20,180
into either Frozen or Beauty and the Beast.

1687
01:02:20,180 --> 01:02:23,220
Frozen's a smoother transition but you're using some

1688
01:02:23,220 --> 01:02:25,340
of the Fantasyland side too.

1689
01:02:25,340 --> 01:02:27,620
This new Beauty and the Beast ride I think would fit in

1690
01:02:27,620 --> 01:02:29,580
great, this is what they are doing in Tokyo

1691
01:02:29,580 --> 01:02:32,060
and it is very smart, that is happening day one,

1692
01:02:32,060 --> 01:02:34,860
everywhere that it can happen but especially Disneyland.

1693
01:02:34,860 --> 01:02:35,700
Wow.

1694
01:02:35,700 --> 01:02:36,520
Who could object to this plan?

1695
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:38,900
Fascinating to hear you pitch IP,

1696
01:02:38,900 --> 01:02:40,860
like inject some IP and stuff.

1697
01:02:40,860 --> 01:02:43,220
Well I don't think I'm an IP snob

1698
01:02:43,220 --> 01:02:44,980
and that Beauty and the Beast stuff looks incredible.

1699
01:02:44,980 --> 01:02:46,180
The Tron ride looks great.

1700
01:02:46,180 --> 01:02:48,620
I mean that's what's getting built right

1701
01:02:48,620 --> 01:02:51,460
and obviously I'd love to have the Aquatopia in there

1702
01:02:51,460 --> 01:02:53,340
or journey to the center of the earth.

1703
01:02:53,340 --> 01:02:54,180
Oh sure.

1704
01:02:54,180 --> 01:02:58,700
Although honestly I think, hey if I'm the head

1705
01:02:58,700 --> 01:03:02,820
of the division, I want what the people want too.

1706
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:05,420
That's not a weird idea in any way.

1707
01:03:05,420 --> 01:03:07,460
That's what I don't understand, why are we holding

1708
01:03:07,460 --> 01:03:11,340
to the Autopia when we could put in mega crowd pleaser

1709
01:03:11,340 --> 01:03:14,620
people eater attractions that everyone would love.

1710
01:03:15,260 --> 01:03:17,100
That is a no brainer, that's day one.

1711
01:03:17,100 --> 01:03:18,980
Day two we'll figure it out.

1712
01:03:18,980 --> 01:03:20,180
What do you guys think?

1713
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:26,300
Oh my god, Marvel baby, X-Men Mansion, two e-tickets,

1714
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:30,160
X-Men's Mansion, fantastic Fort Baxter building ride,

1715
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:34,340
full wheel, not this college campus Marvel land,

1716
01:03:34,340 --> 01:03:37,760
New York City Marvel land, crazy e-tickets,

1717
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:41,380
tons of robots, that's what I'm doing.

1718
01:03:41,380 --> 01:03:42,640
Yeah.

1719
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:43,480
Jason.

1720
01:03:43,480 --> 01:03:44,300
Jason.

1721
01:03:44,300 --> 01:03:49,300
I don't know, I feel like mine are more ethereal.

1722
01:03:51,140 --> 01:03:51,980
I think like.

1723
01:03:51,980 --> 01:03:53,620
More benches.

1724
01:03:53,620 --> 01:03:58,620
I think like less oversight, less oversight for imagineering.

1725
01:03:59,060 --> 01:04:00,660
I mean that's real pipe dreamy.

1726
01:04:00,660 --> 01:04:04,900
Cause Disney's always been pretty careful

1727
01:04:04,900 --> 01:04:08,020
of guarding their image and the company image and stuff.

1728
01:04:08,020 --> 01:04:10,740
But you read about what it was like in the 80s and 90s

1729
01:04:10,740 --> 01:04:13,140
and stuff is getting built left and right.

1730
01:04:13,140 --> 01:04:17,780
And they had more budget issues back then,

1731
01:04:17,780 --> 01:04:20,620
but I don't think it's crazy to describe the company now

1732
01:04:20,620 --> 01:04:23,060
as having unlimited money.

1733
01:04:23,060 --> 01:04:23,900
Yeah.

1734
01:04:23,900 --> 01:04:24,940
Like there's a few companies in the world,

1735
01:04:24,940 --> 01:04:27,700
like Apple and Disney, I think you could describe

1736
01:04:27,700 --> 01:04:30,340
as having like unlimited resources.

1737
01:04:30,340 --> 01:04:31,180
All the money.

1738
01:04:31,180 --> 01:04:36,180
So like loosen it up a little, like go a little more wild.

1739
01:04:36,460 --> 01:04:39,740
I am not proposing releasing Song of the South.

1740
01:04:39,740 --> 01:04:40,940
Sure.

1741
01:04:40,940 --> 01:04:42,940
One of the best jokes I have heard recently

1742
01:04:43,740 --> 01:04:45,700
was someone on a podcast describing self-reflection

1743
01:04:45,700 --> 01:04:48,180
as a beloved American pastime.

1744
01:04:48,180 --> 01:04:50,340
And all the hosts started laughing and I was like,

1745
01:04:50,340 --> 01:04:51,820
yeah, that's true.

1746
01:04:51,820 --> 01:04:54,460
And that's why they should not put Song of the South

1747
01:04:54,460 --> 01:04:56,260
on Disney Plus.

1748
01:04:56,260 --> 01:04:57,100
Oh yeah, yeah.

1749
01:04:57,100 --> 01:04:59,220
Might give people some new good ideas.

1750
01:04:59,220 --> 01:05:00,060
Yeah.

1751
01:05:01,300 --> 01:05:02,140
Yeah.

1752
01:05:02,140 --> 01:05:03,700
I feel like the worst people in the world

1753
01:05:03,700 --> 01:05:07,300
would be super jacked for it for the wrong reasons.

1754
01:05:07,300 --> 01:05:09,220
Plenty of clips of it on YouTube.

1755
01:05:09,220 --> 01:05:12,140
I think just like, yeah, loosening up.

1756
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:15,660
And I don't wanna say like drop prices,

1757
01:05:15,660 --> 01:05:17,780
but it does feel like Disney has become

1758
01:05:17,780 --> 01:05:21,220
much more exclusionary to regular people

1759
01:05:21,220 --> 01:05:23,540
or like come and come with money.

1760
01:05:23,540 --> 01:05:25,500
And that was always the attitude,

1761
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:28,780
but I feel like you saw a lot more promotions in the 90s

1762
01:05:28,780 --> 01:05:31,820
and even in the 2000s of like come for half a day,

1763
01:05:31,820 --> 01:05:33,540
come for free on your birthday.

1764
01:05:33,540 --> 01:05:37,780
And maybe that's more realistic to implement in Orlando

1765
01:05:37,780 --> 01:05:40,020
where the infrastructure is a little better

1766
01:05:40,020 --> 01:05:42,580
and out here, Disneyland's just so crushed

1767
01:05:42,580 --> 01:05:45,140
by current demand.

1768
01:05:45,140 --> 01:05:47,420
But I think they should get friendlier with that stuff

1769
01:05:47,420 --> 01:05:50,580
in California Adventure since they want people over there.

1770
01:05:50,580 --> 01:05:53,060
And in the past, they've done like a really cheap Costco

1771
01:05:53,060 --> 01:05:55,140
ticket that's only California Adventure

1772
01:05:55,140 --> 01:05:56,900
that I really thought about doing.

1773
01:05:58,300 --> 01:06:00,100
Hey, I'm there for wine and one ride,

1774
01:06:00,100 --> 01:06:01,460
so it works out great for me.

1775
01:06:01,460 --> 01:06:03,780
But like I do think if they're trying to spread

1776
01:06:03,780 --> 01:06:07,540
the crowds out more, yeah, do some of that.

1777
01:06:07,540 --> 01:06:09,740
Make California Adventure more people friendly

1778
01:06:10,460 --> 01:06:12,460
and being that Star Wars is gonna be such a crush soon.

1779
01:06:12,460 --> 01:06:16,340
Yeah, and I kind of like that they're doing the Epcot

1780
01:06:16,340 --> 01:06:20,020
like always running a festival model at California Adventure

1781
01:06:20,020 --> 01:06:22,700
because people seem into that and it is a nice way

1782
01:06:22,700 --> 01:06:26,220
to like do tasting menus and stuff.

1783
01:06:26,220 --> 01:06:27,180
Sure, sure.

1784
01:06:27,180 --> 01:06:31,860
But yeah, I think a little less hostility

1785
01:06:31,860 --> 01:06:36,860
to your customers is probably my thing, yeah.

1786
01:06:37,860 --> 01:06:39,340
Yeah, yeah.

1787
01:06:40,420 --> 01:06:42,580
Anybody got anything else?

1788
01:06:42,580 --> 01:06:44,420
Oh wait, wait, really fast.

1789
01:06:44,420 --> 01:06:46,980
I was gonna say I like how Scott and I pitched rides

1790
01:06:46,980 --> 01:06:49,260
and Jason pitched a corporate restructuring.

1791
01:06:49,260 --> 01:06:50,460
I mean.

1792
01:06:50,460 --> 01:06:51,820
That's some mayor talk.

1793
01:06:51,820 --> 01:06:53,620
Yeah, I mean he's gotta think about the big picture.

1794
01:06:53,620 --> 01:06:55,220
It's a crowd pleaser.

1795
01:06:55,220 --> 01:06:56,060
Sorry, Scott, go ahead.

1796
01:06:56,060 --> 01:06:59,100
Oh, it's really fast, this is from Dan Bn7 on Twitter.

1797
01:06:59,100 --> 01:07:00,460
Who is your favorite tiny fuppet?

1798
01:07:00,460 --> 01:07:02,620
Anna Manuel is the answer, we can move on.

1799
01:07:04,420 --> 01:07:05,860
I think I was gonna say Tommy.

1800
01:07:05,860 --> 01:07:07,300
Oh thanks, okay, yeah.

1801
01:07:08,340 --> 01:07:10,660
Well, Tommy's the heart, Tommy gets abused

1802
01:07:10,660 --> 01:07:12,620
and Tommy needs the most love.

1803
01:07:13,780 --> 01:07:15,660
Always was a big gonzoir kid.

1804
01:07:15,660 --> 01:07:17,100
Oh thanks.

1805
01:07:17,100 --> 01:07:19,580
I'm also really fond, I'm thinking about a spinoff

1806
01:07:19,580 --> 01:07:21,660
with Mr. Fresh Juice who is the equivalent

1807
01:07:21,660 --> 01:07:23,100
of the Kool-Aid Man.

1808
01:07:23,100 --> 01:07:23,940
Oh of course.

1809
01:07:23,940 --> 01:07:26,180
I have an idea of where the fuppets don't factor in

1810
01:07:26,180 --> 01:07:28,860
and it's only the, I'll pass that to the Portuguese

1811
01:07:28,860 --> 01:07:30,060
animators behind Tiny Fuppet.

1812
01:07:30,060 --> 01:07:33,180
I believe all of them have their own solo projects

1813
01:07:33,180 --> 01:07:35,780
in development, like Eddie Property.

1814
01:07:36,780 --> 01:07:39,980
Like Joaquin Phoenix Joker, ooh that's a best-in-hand.

1815
01:07:39,980 --> 01:07:42,100
Like we have heard through Crape Fines

1816
01:07:42,100 --> 01:07:45,100
that every obscure storyline in Marvel and DC

1817
01:07:45,100 --> 01:07:47,780
is being mined and pitched right now.

1818
01:07:47,780 --> 01:07:49,620
That's what's gonna start happening in Fuppetverse.

1819
01:07:49,620 --> 01:07:51,980
Anyway, didn't mean to dominate with that.

1820
01:07:51,980 --> 01:07:54,940
We'll see if, I will have to cut this out.

1821
01:07:54,940 --> 01:07:59,700
I am getting right now a rumor from a friend.

1822
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:02,380
If this is, obviously if he doesn't want me to do this,

1823
01:08:02,380 --> 01:08:03,220
I'll cut this out.

1824
01:08:03,220 --> 01:08:04,060
The crow is back in Dumbbell.

1825
01:08:04,060 --> 01:08:07,740
But no, he is saying right now there is a rumor

1826
01:08:07,740 --> 01:08:11,460
that there will be a Jurassic World tiki bar

1827
01:08:11,460 --> 01:08:13,100
at Universal Hollywood.

1828
01:08:13,100 --> 01:08:13,940
Whoa!

1829
01:08:13,940 --> 01:08:15,260
There we go, now we're talking.

1830
01:08:15,260 --> 01:08:18,260
Suddenly, maybe I buy Braves,

1831
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:21,260
suddenly I stand face to face, toe to toe

1832
01:08:21,260 --> 01:08:22,380
with the Indominus.

1833
01:08:22,380 --> 01:08:23,220
Oh man.

1834
01:08:23,220 --> 01:08:24,540
You stand the Indominus.

1835
01:08:24,540 --> 01:08:25,740
Yeah, I'm gonna stand up on your eye.

1836
01:08:25,740 --> 01:08:27,340
We stand the Indominus.

1837
01:08:27,340 --> 01:08:30,780
Yeah, one Mai Tai and I start doing crazy things.

1838
01:08:30,780 --> 01:08:33,940
Well, you gotta have two as a tribute to Jimmy.

1839
01:08:33,940 --> 01:08:34,780
Sure.

1840
01:08:34,780 --> 01:08:36,340
Yeah, there's two Margaritas you have to sing.

1841
01:08:36,340 --> 01:08:37,940
Oh yes, yeah.

1842
01:08:37,940 --> 01:08:40,540
Now, can you imagine if that was on the ride,

1843
01:08:40,540 --> 01:08:42,380
if a Buffett robot ran away?

1844
01:08:42,380 --> 01:08:43,940
Gosh, now that's a dream.

1845
01:08:45,460 --> 01:08:47,260
That's probably the answer to one of these questions.

1846
01:08:47,260 --> 01:08:48,460
What if you were in charge of Universal,

1847
01:08:48,460 --> 01:08:49,300
what would you do?

1848
01:08:49,300 --> 01:08:50,140
Jimmy Buffett robot.

1849
01:08:50,140 --> 01:08:51,380
I don't agree with that.

1850
01:08:51,380 --> 01:08:52,340
Interesting.

1851
01:08:52,340 --> 01:08:55,340
Show scene where the slightly aloof assistant

1852
01:08:55,340 --> 01:08:56,860
you've known for two minutes

1853
01:08:56,860 --> 01:08:59,180
gets dropped into a pool to be eaten.

1854
01:09:01,140 --> 01:09:03,380
Anybody got anything?

1855
01:09:03,380 --> 01:09:07,820
Well, this one is just for Jason.

1856
01:09:07,820 --> 01:09:11,700
And I'm trying to, I just scrolled past six a minute yet.

1857
01:09:11,700 --> 01:09:13,340
This is from at Ben Stans.

1858
01:09:13,340 --> 01:09:15,860
What's Jason's favorite depression era food?

1859
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:20,860
Even the Great Depression, not when I'm depressed, right?

1860
01:09:21,180 --> 01:09:22,540
Yeah, no, I think they're talking about

1861
01:09:22,540 --> 01:09:23,700
the Great Depression.

1862
01:09:23,700 --> 01:09:25,820
Oh, hmm.

1863
01:09:25,820 --> 01:09:26,660
That is a great question.

1864
01:09:26,660 --> 01:09:28,700
Scrapple of depression era food.

1865
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:32,460
I was probably a luxury during the Depression.

1866
01:09:34,300 --> 01:09:36,380
Well, soup and bread is hard to beat,

1867
01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:39,100
but this is actually a little pre-Depression,

1868
01:09:39,100 --> 01:09:43,060
but Philadelphia favorite, Goldenberg's peanut shoes,

1869
01:09:43,060 --> 01:09:45,700
which were originally made as a ration

1870
01:09:45,700 --> 01:09:50,100
for doughboys in the trenches,

1871
01:09:50,100 --> 01:09:53,060
troops in the trenches during World War I,

1872
01:09:54,820 --> 01:09:56,420
are a real favorite.

1873
01:09:56,420 --> 01:09:58,580
It's just molasses and peanuts

1874
01:09:59,420 --> 01:10:01,100
and traditionally dark chocolate.

1875
01:10:02,020 --> 01:10:04,060
You would eat it when you're on the front

1876
01:10:04,060 --> 01:10:05,940
and gives you a little energy boost.

1877
01:10:06,820 --> 01:10:09,460
That became a favorite Philadelphia treat

1878
01:10:09,460 --> 01:10:12,500
and has really upped their game in recent years

1879
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:15,140
with social media and publicity and stuff.

1880
01:10:15,140 --> 01:10:17,540
And now you can get them in Los Angeles.

1881
01:10:17,540 --> 01:10:19,820
Delicious and vegan.

1882
01:10:19,820 --> 01:10:20,660
Wow.

1883
01:10:20,660 --> 01:10:23,100
I am so impressed with the speed and dexterity

1884
01:10:23,100 --> 01:10:23,940
of that answer.

1885
01:10:23,940 --> 01:10:25,380
I'm really glad. Always ready to go with a treat.

1886
01:10:25,380 --> 01:10:26,460
That was asked.

1887
01:10:26,660 --> 01:10:29,940
Let me keep looking here.

1888
01:10:29,940 --> 01:10:31,300
I mean, how do you talk that?

1889
01:10:31,300 --> 01:10:34,780
I've got an Epcot one from Mark Miskovic.

1890
01:10:34,780 --> 01:10:36,540
The directive is given to you

1891
01:10:36,540 --> 01:10:39,180
that you must replace one of the countries at Epcot

1892
01:10:39,180 --> 01:10:40,620
with a new country.

1893
01:10:40,620 --> 01:10:42,940
Which country would you choose to get the ax

1894
01:10:42,940 --> 01:10:44,460
and what would get in?

1895
01:10:44,460 --> 01:10:48,740
I would nix Canada and replace it with India, says Mark.

1896
01:10:48,740 --> 01:10:50,580
I feel like we can only comfortably say

1897
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:52,220
get rid of United States or Canada.

1898
01:10:52,220 --> 01:10:53,500
Yeah, get rid of United States.

1899
01:10:53,500 --> 01:10:54,340
You can't say another.

1900
01:10:54,340 --> 01:10:55,180
You can't say another.

1901
01:10:55,740 --> 01:10:57,860
There's three white guys that are not allowed

1902
01:10:57,860 --> 01:11:00,700
to get rid of a non-white country.

1903
01:11:00,700 --> 01:11:02,020
That's not gonna happen.

1904
01:11:02,020 --> 01:11:04,460
I mean, obviously there's other European countries.

1905
01:11:04,460 --> 01:11:06,420
Well, let's go, it certainly wouldn't be Mexico.

1906
01:11:06,420 --> 01:11:07,980
It certainly wouldn't be Norway.

1907
01:11:08,860 --> 01:11:09,860
I mean, some of them could get,

1908
01:11:09,860 --> 01:11:12,460
I'd rather give something an attraction

1909
01:11:12,460 --> 01:11:16,620
than like, it's not as if just the surroundings are so bad.

1910
01:11:16,620 --> 01:11:19,260
I mean, how about, is Germany,

1911
01:11:19,260 --> 01:11:21,540
are we allowed to cancel Germany as white people?

1912
01:11:21,540 --> 01:11:23,420
Maybe, yeah, maybe.

1913
01:11:23,460 --> 01:11:26,500
Because there's nothing going on in Germany.

1914
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:28,700
But what do you put in there?

1915
01:11:28,700 --> 01:11:31,980
I would love, I mean, it was pitch.

1916
01:11:31,980 --> 01:11:35,340
It was real enough to be on one of the TV specials

1917
01:11:35,340 --> 01:11:37,340
with Alex Haley introducing it, right?

1918
01:11:37,340 --> 01:11:39,220
The Africa Outpost.

1919
01:11:39,220 --> 01:11:40,060
Really?

1920
01:11:40,060 --> 01:11:42,580
Yeah, there was supposed to be a whole pavilion,

1921
01:11:42,580 --> 01:11:47,260
which it's crazy that it was for a whole continent.

1922
01:11:47,260 --> 01:11:49,660
But I do think like,

1923
01:11:49,660 --> 01:11:53,100
Africa and the Middle East are underrepresented

1924
01:11:54,060 --> 01:11:55,660
countries with amazing,

1925
01:11:55,660 --> 01:11:59,940
regions with amazing cultures and food and everything.

1926
01:12:01,540 --> 01:12:02,380
I think-

1927
01:12:02,380 --> 01:12:05,140
Wait, what's our ticket to, here's what it is.

1928
01:12:05,140 --> 01:12:06,900
I don't know which country specifically

1929
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:07,820
you would associate it with,

1930
01:12:07,820 --> 01:12:10,140
but how do you get Sinbad in there?

1931
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:11,940
Interesting.

1932
01:12:11,940 --> 01:12:13,140
Yes, yes.

1933
01:12:13,140 --> 01:12:15,340
Part of me is a little bit like,

1934
01:12:15,340 --> 01:12:18,100
kind of wants it to stay just in Tokyo.

1935
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:18,940
I do kind of like that.

1936
01:12:18,940 --> 01:12:20,540
It's kind of special that it's only there.

1937
01:12:20,540 --> 01:12:22,780
You have to make the journey to see the journey.

1938
01:12:23,500 --> 01:12:27,580
But I mean, the Morocco pavilion is very beautiful

1939
01:12:27,580 --> 01:12:30,020
and those restaurants are supposed to be very good.

1940
01:12:30,020 --> 01:12:34,500
And if that Iran pavilion had ever been built,

1941
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:36,060
I think it could have gone a big way

1942
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:38,900
for like relations between the two countries.

1943
01:12:41,700 --> 01:12:42,700
This is tough.

1944
01:12:42,700 --> 01:12:45,020
All right, get rid of America.

1945
01:12:45,020 --> 01:12:46,500
Get rid of the US pavilion.

1946
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:48,500
Mark Twain shaking hands with,

1947
01:12:48,500 --> 01:12:49,500
can you just leave them,

1948
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:51,500
like put them on a barge out in the lake?

1949
01:12:51,660 --> 01:12:54,740
Move that show to the hall of presidents.

1950
01:12:54,740 --> 01:12:57,260
That show is better than the hall of presidents.

1951
01:12:57,260 --> 01:12:58,460
Oh yeah, absolutely.

1952
01:12:58,460 --> 01:12:59,940
Swap those bad boys.

1953
01:12:59,940 --> 01:13:01,940
Mm-hmm, good point.

1954
01:13:01,940 --> 01:13:06,500
And then put in Australia.

1955
01:13:08,100 --> 01:13:09,540
Rescuers Down Under.

1956
01:13:09,540 --> 01:13:11,220
Yeah, rescuers, I need a ticket.

1957
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:14,740
Yeah, flying on the wing of eagle.

1958
01:13:14,740 --> 01:13:15,580
Yeah, great.

1959
01:13:15,580 --> 01:13:18,060
Yeah, a Soarin', that's, yeah.

1960
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:20,340
I don't know if anybody's asking for rescuers Down Under,

1961
01:13:20,340 --> 01:13:22,540
but it'll be good when you're on it.

1962
01:13:22,540 --> 01:13:23,380
Yeah.

1963
01:13:23,380 --> 01:13:24,220
You're gonna like it when you're on it.

1964
01:13:24,220 --> 01:13:25,340
Tiny Soarin'.

1965
01:13:25,340 --> 01:13:26,180
Yeah.

1966
01:13:26,180 --> 01:13:27,780
I am getting more details

1967
01:13:27,780 --> 01:13:30,620
about this Jurassic World tiki bar.

1968
01:13:30,620 --> 01:13:33,740
It's on the top of Jurassic Outfitters supposedly.

1969
01:13:33,740 --> 01:13:35,300
Oh, because there's a second level.

1970
01:13:35,300 --> 01:13:37,540
Oh yeah, that's a great idea.

1971
01:13:37,540 --> 01:13:38,500
Yes.

1972
01:13:38,500 --> 01:13:39,340
All right.

1973
01:13:39,340 --> 01:13:41,060
Man, you guys can go there.

1974
01:13:41,060 --> 01:13:43,540
I can meet you with one of those big crazy ice creams

1975
01:13:43,540 --> 01:13:45,740
they have only in Amon the Lower Lot.

1976
01:13:45,740 --> 01:13:46,580
Oh yeah, yeah, those are good.

1977
01:13:46,580 --> 01:13:47,900
That were closed when we were there.

1978
01:13:47,900 --> 01:13:48,820
And I won't say this part,

1979
01:13:48,820 --> 01:13:52,060
but I do have a date for possibly the soft opening.

1980
01:13:52,060 --> 01:13:53,020
Oh.

1981
01:13:53,020 --> 01:13:54,620
Is it Lindsay?

1982
01:13:54,620 --> 01:13:55,460
No, no, no, no, no.

1983
01:13:55,460 --> 01:13:56,300
Nailed it.

1984
01:13:56,300 --> 01:13:57,380
Oh.

1985
01:13:57,380 --> 01:13:58,980
That's you, Jason, of course.

1986
01:13:58,980 --> 01:14:00,740
That's me, it's Jason and I.

1987
01:14:01,940 --> 01:14:03,100
Here's one.

1988
01:14:04,140 --> 01:14:06,220
Houston Barber on Twitter.

1989
01:14:06,220 --> 01:14:09,300
If you were in charge of adding a new modern day scene

1990
01:14:09,300 --> 01:14:12,940
for Spaceship Earth to come after the Steve Jobs robot,

1991
01:14:12,940 --> 01:14:14,500
what would it be?

1992
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:16,060
I've got it right away.

1993
01:14:16,100 --> 01:14:18,900
You have to do innovators and inventors

1994
01:14:18,900 --> 01:14:20,180
and people who push the ball forward.

1995
01:14:20,180 --> 01:14:22,620
It would be Del Close inventing the Herald.

1996
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:24,340
How near you?

1997
01:14:24,340 --> 01:14:25,180
We have a close robot.

1998
01:14:25,180 --> 01:14:27,180
In a hoarder's apartment,

1999
01:14:27,180 --> 01:14:29,740
as Bob Odenkirk described when he went in there,

2000
01:14:29,740 --> 01:14:31,220
it was full of shit. With the iguana.

2001
01:14:31,220 --> 01:14:32,340
It was in the middle of winter

2002
01:14:32,340 --> 01:14:34,340
and there was a busted window.

2003
01:14:34,340 --> 01:14:37,540
It was just blowing freezing cold Chicago air

2004
01:14:37,540 --> 01:14:38,860
into his shitty apartment.

2005
01:14:38,860 --> 01:14:43,140
Eating marijuana flour out of a cereal bowl with a spoon.

2006
01:14:43,140 --> 01:14:43,980
Jesus.

2007
01:14:43,980 --> 01:14:45,900
The story Bob Odenkirk tells is he saw Del Close.

2008
01:14:46,740 --> 01:14:48,980
By the way, Del Close invented long form improvisation.

2009
01:14:48,980 --> 01:14:51,780
He taught a lot of people like Bill Murray, Tina Fey,

2010
01:14:51,780 --> 01:14:52,620
Amy Poehler.

2011
01:14:52,620 --> 01:14:53,460
Helen Arkin.

2012
01:14:53,460 --> 01:14:55,900
The original ECB people.

2013
01:14:55,900 --> 01:14:57,940
Yeah, Bob Odenkirk, I guess he was a kid

2014
01:14:57,940 --> 01:15:01,260
and he was interviewing people for a newspaper

2015
01:15:01,260 --> 01:15:03,220
and he ran into him in a bookstore and he was like,

2016
01:15:03,220 --> 01:15:04,820
hey, you're Del Close, can I interview

2017
01:15:04,820 --> 01:15:06,740
and get an interview from you?

2018
01:15:06,740 --> 01:15:08,380
And he goes, I love it.

2019
01:15:08,380 --> 01:15:09,980
And then took him into his apartment

2020
01:15:09,980 --> 01:15:11,660
and then answered his questions.

2021
01:15:11,660 --> 01:15:13,540
He told him to take a bite out of crime.

2022
01:15:14,500 --> 01:15:15,340
Ah.

2023
01:15:16,740 --> 01:15:18,620
Yeah, I remember him saying that the apartment was crazy

2024
01:15:18,620 --> 01:15:20,940
and he lived in this insane hobble

2025
01:15:20,940 --> 01:15:25,020
but he was also saying thing after thing

2026
01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:28,740
that would, I just remember Odenkirk's takeaway being,

2027
01:15:28,740 --> 01:15:31,140
I wanna be that age and have something

2028
01:15:31,140 --> 01:15:33,740
that I can't wait to do the next day.

2029
01:15:34,940 --> 01:15:36,500
Because we're gonna do this where we flip this format

2030
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:37,860
on its head and then we're gonna do this show

2031
01:15:37,860 --> 01:15:39,420
and we're gonna combine this with that.

2032
01:15:39,420 --> 01:15:40,700
He was very into it still.

2033
01:15:40,700 --> 01:15:42,380
Yeah, it ended up being a positive.

2034
01:15:42,420 --> 01:15:44,540
I actually found that to be cool,

2035
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:46,660
which I'm a big admirer of Odenkirk

2036
01:15:46,660 --> 01:15:49,060
and I think that is what he's like as,

2037
01:15:49,060 --> 01:15:51,620
well, that's a guy who's doing it

2038
01:15:51,620 --> 01:15:54,340
and relevant and current in his 50s.

2039
01:15:56,260 --> 01:15:57,740
So that ended up being a nice story.

2040
01:15:57,740 --> 01:15:59,460
Maybe we should attribute to Del Close.

2041
01:15:59,460 --> 01:16:01,340
I mean, that's the story with anything.

2042
01:16:01,340 --> 01:16:04,740
The actual act of doing, of writing or acting

2043
01:16:04,740 --> 01:16:07,300
or improv and stuff, the actual act of doing it

2044
01:16:07,300 --> 01:16:09,220
tends to still be pleasant.

2045
01:16:09,220 --> 01:16:11,380
It's just the trappings that are around it

2046
01:16:11,380 --> 01:16:13,740
or the things you associate with your memories

2047
01:16:13,740 --> 01:16:16,580
and emotions is the baggage.

2048
01:16:16,580 --> 01:16:18,140
I don't wanna just keep talking about this Bob Odenkirk

2049
01:16:18,140 --> 01:16:20,340
interview about Del Close on this theme park podcast,

2050
01:16:20,340 --> 01:16:22,260
but I really like in that interview,

2051
01:16:22,260 --> 01:16:24,620
he also talks about how when he went to Second City,

2052
01:16:24,620 --> 01:16:26,500
whoever was running Second City was giving him

2053
01:16:26,500 --> 01:16:30,500
the fantasy answer of, and then John Belushi got up

2054
01:16:30,500 --> 01:16:33,660
on stage and he was great and everyone loved him.

2055
01:16:33,660 --> 01:16:36,060
There was no practicality to it,

2056
01:16:36,060 --> 01:16:37,780
whereas Del Close was like,

2057
01:16:37,780 --> 01:16:40,380
these are the steps and you're gonna be bad.

2058
01:16:40,420 --> 01:16:42,620
He sort of walked him through it in a realistic way

2059
01:16:42,620 --> 01:16:44,420
where it made it less magical,

2060
01:16:44,420 --> 01:16:46,020
which honestly is something I needed somebody

2061
01:16:46,020 --> 01:16:46,980
to tell me when I was a kid,

2062
01:16:46,980 --> 01:16:49,540
because as a kid you think, oh, if you're talented,

2063
01:16:49,540 --> 01:16:52,140
you're talented and mostly it's just like grinding

2064
01:16:52,140 --> 01:16:54,580
through hard work to try to figure something out.

2065
01:16:54,580 --> 01:16:58,660
He did so much better to hear that heroes are fallible.

2066
01:16:58,660 --> 01:17:00,740
Every once in a while there's like a prince

2067
01:17:00,740 --> 01:17:02,540
or somebody who's like struck by lightning,

2068
01:17:02,540 --> 01:17:04,340
like no one will ever be as talented as that guy,

2069
01:17:04,340 --> 01:17:05,980
but it's not helpful to hear,

2070
01:17:05,980 --> 01:17:07,100
so how'd that guy get where he is?

2071
01:17:07,100 --> 01:17:08,500
Because he's the greatest ever to do it

2072
01:17:08,500 --> 01:17:10,940
and you will never, I love hearing any stories

2073
01:17:10,940 --> 01:17:14,940
of like fallibility of somebody who ended up being great

2074
01:17:14,940 --> 01:17:16,340
is the best.

2075
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:17,180
That's what Del gave him.

2076
01:17:17,180 --> 01:17:19,300
So yeah, Del should be in Spaceship Earth for sure.

2077
01:17:19,300 --> 01:17:22,860
Clearly, we have legitimate reasons for that.

2078
01:17:22,860 --> 01:17:25,180
Oh, but now I feel gross, what a dorky,

2079
01:17:25,180 --> 01:17:26,020
we think Del Close.

2080
01:17:26,020 --> 01:17:29,620
Would you rather have like Twitch streamer ninja dabbing?

2081
01:17:29,620 --> 01:17:33,500
Like would you rather have the Dolan twins in there

2082
01:17:33,500 --> 01:17:35,500
doing whatever it is they do?

2083
01:17:35,500 --> 01:17:39,140
Yeah, we need PewDiePie pioneering the,

2084
01:17:39,140 --> 01:17:39,980
God Jesus.

2085
01:17:39,980 --> 01:17:41,620
Yeah.

2086
01:17:41,620 --> 01:17:44,300
And early influencers filled the world

2087
01:17:44,300 --> 01:17:46,580
with compelling, enriching content.

2088
01:17:46,580 --> 01:17:48,060
Olivia Jade is there.

2089
01:17:48,060 --> 01:17:48,900
Olivia Jade is there.

2090
01:17:48,900 --> 01:17:49,740
Laurie Laughlin's kid.

2091
01:17:49,740 --> 01:17:52,060
I mean, I would love a Merrin animatronic

2092
01:17:52,060 --> 01:17:55,060
telling a Barack Obama animatronic

2093
01:17:55,060 --> 01:17:57,220
of how he almost got updated,

2094
01:17:57,220 --> 01:18:00,060
but he still hasn't got, even after talking to Lorne,

2095
01:18:00,060 --> 01:18:01,660
he still doesn't quite understand.

2096
01:18:01,660 --> 01:18:04,180
The new Twain and Franklin shaking hands

2097
01:18:04,300 --> 01:18:07,900
is Obama and Merrin shaking hands.

2098
01:18:07,900 --> 01:18:10,340
Nothing good happened after that scene in that ride though,

2099
01:18:10,340 --> 01:18:11,460
so I don't know what to put.

2100
01:18:11,460 --> 01:18:14,100
I like the idea that there are robots

2101
01:18:14,100 --> 01:18:15,820
of Laurie Laughlin and Olivia Jade,

2102
01:18:15,820 --> 01:18:18,420
and then that's where you start going downhill,

2103
01:18:18,420 --> 01:18:19,980
and you turn it into a thrill ride.

2104
01:18:19,980 --> 01:18:24,340
Now it's a plummet to the bottom of time.

2105
01:18:24,340 --> 01:18:27,780
Yeah, one that spins and has an incline,

2106
01:18:27,780 --> 01:18:29,700
like Disney hasn't really done that yet,

2107
01:18:29,700 --> 01:18:30,540
but that's what it feels like.

2108
01:18:30,540 --> 01:18:33,460
Yeah, you fall off a cliff at that moment.

2109
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:36,580
Accelerationism, the end of the ride is accelerationism.

2110
01:18:36,580 --> 01:18:38,420
Everything's getting faster and faster,

2111
01:18:38,420 --> 01:18:40,900
and the human mind can't process it correctly.

2112
01:18:40,900 --> 01:18:44,100
Watch whatever Paul, coming out of the suicide forest,

2113
01:18:44,100 --> 01:18:45,340
and then you see, and then.

2114
01:18:45,340 --> 01:18:48,020
Ha ha ha, Logan, that was definitely Logan.

2115
01:18:48,020 --> 01:18:49,780
And then it's a bigger,

2116
01:18:49,780 --> 01:18:51,980
you have to dig a basement in Spaceship Earth,

2117
01:18:51,980 --> 01:18:54,500
you go hundreds of feet into the ground.

2118
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:55,540
I was gonna, I'll say,

2119
01:18:55,540 --> 01:18:57,940
let's do a fantasy to the future look,

2120
01:18:57,940 --> 01:19:01,860
like they were trying to do with Carousel of Progress.

2121
01:19:01,900 --> 01:19:04,780
Let's have, and we can put IP on it too,

2122
01:19:04,780 --> 01:19:06,860
the WALL-E people in the chairs.

2123
01:19:06,860 --> 01:19:07,700
No, yes you are.

2124
01:19:07,700 --> 01:19:09,900
Because that's technology, that's an innovation,

2125
01:19:09,900 --> 01:19:11,380
and now we got IP.

2126
01:19:11,380 --> 01:19:13,540
You know what, I know my Epcot,

2127
01:19:13,540 --> 01:19:16,980
the nerd tradition answer is supposed to be,

2128
01:19:16,980 --> 01:19:18,740
don't touch Spaceship Earth, it's perfect,

2129
01:19:18,740 --> 01:19:21,260
the Da Vinci guy, if they just made that a WALL-E ride,

2130
01:19:21,260 --> 01:19:22,340
I'd be so happy.

2131
01:19:22,340 --> 01:19:23,180
That'd be great.

2132
01:19:23,180 --> 01:19:25,860
And then you get up to the space part,

2133
01:19:25,860 --> 01:19:27,700
and you're watching projections of them

2134
01:19:27,700 --> 01:19:29,860
playing in the stardust and all that.

2135
01:19:29,860 --> 01:19:32,940
That'd be wonderful, I love WALL-E, that'd be better.

2136
01:19:32,940 --> 01:19:35,780
I guess I'm becoming an IP guy.

2137
01:19:35,780 --> 01:19:36,980
You're an IP man though.

2138
01:19:36,980 --> 01:19:41,100
Apparently, I mean as long as they bring back

2139
01:19:41,100 --> 01:19:46,100
figment somewhere, I don't feel like keep Epcot

2140
01:19:46,660 --> 01:19:51,140
as it is decaying and hasn't been touched in decades.

2141
01:19:51,140 --> 01:19:53,420
WALL-E ride in Spaceship Earth would be awesome actually.

2142
01:19:53,420 --> 01:19:54,740
Yeah, I'm fine with that.

2143
01:19:55,660 --> 01:19:57,380
Yeah, any other, no,

2144
01:19:57,380 --> 01:19:58,860
I'm good with my Spaceship Earth answer.

2145
01:19:58,860 --> 01:19:59,700
That's great.

2146
01:20:00,820 --> 01:20:05,660
Adam Framp from Instagram asked,

2147
01:20:05,660 --> 01:20:07,900
what would you want for a fifth gate in Florida?

2148
01:20:07,900 --> 01:20:10,100
And then he said Disney's Florida Adventure?

2149
01:20:10,100 --> 01:20:11,940
And of course, ha ha, that's not what we want,

2150
01:20:11,940 --> 01:20:12,900
we don't want that.

2151
01:20:14,100 --> 01:20:15,500
Well, I would want the weird,

2152
01:20:15,500 --> 01:20:19,300
I would want like the Waukechi Springs,

2153
01:20:19,300 --> 01:20:21,860
Florida sideshow version of it.

2154
01:20:21,860 --> 01:20:22,700
Sure.

2155
01:20:22,700 --> 01:20:23,660
But I don't think the state of Florida

2156
01:20:23,660 --> 01:20:25,100
would be super fond of that.

2157
01:20:25,100 --> 01:20:27,820
My answer for this is what had been rumored,

2158
01:20:27,820 --> 01:20:30,220
which I remember hearing back when I was 18

2159
01:20:30,220 --> 01:20:32,180
that this was on the table and I don't know,

2160
01:20:32,180 --> 01:20:33,860
I've seen it online too, so there must have been

2161
01:20:33,860 --> 01:20:36,820
some truth to somebody having this idea in the company.

2162
01:20:36,820 --> 01:20:38,860
The Disney Villains thrill park.

2163
01:20:38,860 --> 01:20:39,700
Yeah.

2164
01:20:39,700 --> 01:20:42,860
That's with like Maleficent's Castle as opposed to the,

2165
01:20:42,860 --> 01:20:46,980
so it's a reverse, it's a negative version of Main Street.

2166
01:20:46,980 --> 01:20:50,180
That always sounded like a cool way for them to do,

2167
01:20:50,180 --> 01:20:52,580
because you were feeling in the late 90s, early 2000s

2168
01:20:52,580 --> 01:20:54,220
that they're getting a little cheaper.

2169
01:20:54,220 --> 01:20:56,220
But so for them to do, all right,

2170
01:20:56,260 --> 01:20:58,180
like a six-flags style park with less theming

2171
01:20:58,180 --> 01:21:01,340
would be cheaper, but the thrills would kind of counteract

2172
01:21:01,340 --> 01:21:03,220
that, that just seemed like a good,

2173
01:21:03,220 --> 01:21:04,700
like oh, that is what they should be doing

2174
01:21:04,700 --> 01:21:06,140
if they're trying to spend less money.

2175
01:21:06,140 --> 01:21:07,860
I'm surprised it didn't happen.

2176
01:21:07,860 --> 01:21:09,380
I am surprised it didn't happen as well.

2177
01:21:09,380 --> 01:21:11,860
I mean, at this point, now we don't want the cheap version.

2178
01:21:11,860 --> 01:21:15,460
We want the crazy e-ticket road coasters.

2179
01:21:15,460 --> 01:21:17,260
And it doesn't even have to be a thrill park.

2180
01:21:17,260 --> 01:21:19,860
But I think that the market, people love evil.

2181
01:21:19,860 --> 01:21:22,340
People love haunts, people love horror.

2182
01:21:22,340 --> 01:21:24,140
So give us the Disney version of it.

2183
01:21:24,140 --> 01:21:26,980
And you could have the amount of Halloween events,

2184
01:21:26,980 --> 01:21:28,260
Halloween events year round,

2185
01:21:28,260 --> 01:21:30,460
you could throw in just this park alone.

2186
01:21:30,460 --> 01:21:32,180
I really think it's a great idea.

2187
01:21:32,180 --> 01:21:34,380
I would still like to see, I mean,

2188
01:21:34,380 --> 01:21:36,540
I've watched a few videos on it now,

2189
01:21:36,540 --> 01:21:38,260
and it's crazy that it got so far

2190
01:21:38,260 --> 01:21:39,620
to be in the promotional materials,

2191
01:21:39,620 --> 01:21:42,420
but the Beastly Kingdom part of Animal Kingdom

2192
01:21:42,420 --> 01:21:43,580
still looks great.

2193
01:21:45,020 --> 01:21:45,860
Yeah, I don't know.

2194
01:21:45,860 --> 01:21:49,420
I'm very curious to see what that new Universal Park

2195
01:21:49,420 --> 01:21:50,740
is gonna be like.

2196
01:21:50,740 --> 01:21:53,660
The theme park university had a whole like,

2197
01:21:53,700 --> 01:21:55,500
this might be interesting,

2198
01:21:55,500 --> 01:21:58,140
like a main street city walk hybrid

2199
01:21:58,140 --> 01:22:00,940
with the hotel at the end to not block the view

2200
01:22:00,940 --> 01:22:03,140
and like four different portals

2201
01:22:03,140 --> 01:22:05,260
that you pay for one ticket,

2202
01:22:05,260 --> 01:22:07,260
but you have to go back out to that main street

2203
01:22:07,260 --> 01:22:09,260
to get into each land.

2204
01:22:09,260 --> 01:22:12,900
Like the idea of uprooting what we think of,

2205
01:22:12,900 --> 01:22:15,940
like how the parks are designed and function

2206
01:22:15,940 --> 01:22:18,540
is interesting to me if they can get away with it.

2207
01:22:18,540 --> 01:22:20,180
Yeah, I agree.

2208
01:22:20,180 --> 01:22:21,820
Beastly Kingdom, yeah, sounds awesome.

2209
01:22:21,820 --> 01:22:22,660
Sure, sure.

2210
01:22:22,820 --> 01:22:23,660
What do you think?

2211
01:22:25,860 --> 01:22:26,700
Disney Sea.

2212
01:22:27,860 --> 01:22:30,500
I'm sorry, such a Disney Sea haze.

2213
01:22:30,500 --> 01:22:31,460
Oh, I got this.

2214
01:22:33,140 --> 01:22:34,260
Disney Swamp.

2215
01:22:37,140 --> 01:22:38,340
It's essentially the same,

2216
01:22:38,340 --> 01:22:39,660
but the water's all green and brown.

2217
01:22:39,660 --> 01:22:42,420
Swampy shitty water like in Florida.

2218
01:22:42,420 --> 01:22:43,540
I got a little distracted by this one,

2219
01:22:43,540 --> 01:22:45,220
which I think is,

2220
01:22:45,220 --> 01:22:48,060
do I know my history well enough to answer this,

2221
01:22:48,060 --> 01:22:48,940
but I like the question.

2222
01:22:48,940 --> 01:22:50,380
Peter Page asks,

2223
01:22:50,380 --> 01:22:53,460
best five year run of a creative group.

2224
01:22:53,460 --> 01:22:57,260
Universal 2010 to 2014 had Diagon and Hogsmeade.

2225
01:22:57,260 --> 01:23:02,260
Disney 92 to 96 had DLP Tower and Indiana Jones.

2226
01:23:03,620 --> 01:23:08,620
My vote is Disney 70, 71 Pirates Mansion and Disney World.

2227
01:23:09,620 --> 01:23:13,060
I think for us, the Baxter run of,

2228
01:23:15,620 --> 01:23:19,220
Big Thunder, Star Tours, Splash Mountain.

2229
01:23:19,260 --> 01:23:20,460
But you gotta go five years.

2230
01:23:20,460 --> 01:23:21,740
Oh, five years, shit.

2231
01:23:21,740 --> 01:23:25,540
So I think you gotta include the famous Breck Eisner moment

2232
01:23:25,540 --> 01:23:30,540
where both Star Tours and Splash got approved.

2233
01:23:33,900 --> 01:23:35,380
I think Disneyland was at its best.

2234
01:23:35,380 --> 01:23:36,220
A lot of great stuff.

2235
01:23:36,220 --> 01:23:37,740
What would my years be on that?

2236
01:23:37,740 --> 01:23:40,020
Is it like 84 to 89?

2237
01:23:40,020 --> 01:23:43,260
A ton of stuff that looms really large to me.

2238
01:23:43,260 --> 01:23:45,260
That's when all the Star Tours is happening.

2239
01:23:45,260 --> 01:23:47,940
I think we're about to hit another five year thing.

2240
01:23:48,700 --> 01:23:51,540
It feels like five years for both companies.

2241
01:23:52,700 --> 01:23:55,620
We're at the start of very big fives.

2242
01:23:55,620 --> 01:24:00,620
Whenever, whatever would overlap with Radiator Springs

2243
01:24:01,220 --> 01:24:03,780
and the general improvements of California Adventure,

2244
01:24:03,780 --> 01:24:05,460
I think a fantastic run.

2245
01:24:05,460 --> 01:24:08,980
That culminates in 2012, all of that opening, I think,

2246
01:24:08,980 --> 01:24:12,460
but stuff gradually started in 2010, 2011.

2247
01:24:12,460 --> 01:24:13,740
Can you find a five year window

2248
01:24:13,740 --> 01:24:17,020
that also then intersects with Avatar and?

2249
01:24:18,780 --> 01:24:22,100
The mid 2010s have been pretty strong.

2250
01:24:22,100 --> 01:24:24,180
I followed Disneyland stuff.

2251
01:24:24,180 --> 01:24:26,940
Growing up on the East Coast, I followed it so rarely,

2252
01:24:26,940 --> 01:24:29,740
only when it was in specials or the magazines and stuff.

2253
01:24:29,740 --> 01:24:35,020
But for me as a kid from 89,

2254
01:24:35,020 --> 01:24:37,260
89 was opening of MGM Studios, right?

2255
01:24:37,260 --> 01:24:41,460
89 to 94, where you saw Tomorrowland 94,

2256
01:24:41,460 --> 01:24:43,700
like that Tomorrowland.

2257
01:24:43,700 --> 01:24:44,540
Yeah, that's a good cap of it.

2258
01:24:44,540 --> 01:24:46,500
Lots of stuff opening in Florida,

2259
01:24:46,540 --> 01:24:49,020
lots of hotels opening.

2260
01:24:49,020 --> 01:24:51,620
Toontown, which came out of the gate pretty strong.

2261
01:24:53,020 --> 01:24:54,700
What else is early 90s?

2262
01:24:54,700 --> 01:24:57,500
Honestly, when they built all those 90s hotels,

2263
01:24:57,500 --> 01:24:58,620
that's a dorky answer,

2264
01:24:58,620 --> 01:25:01,940
but Yacht and Beach Club, Grand Floridian,

2265
01:25:01,940 --> 01:25:04,220
Swan and Dolphin, they're all really cool.

2266
01:25:04,220 --> 01:25:05,940
We love the Boardwalk Hotel.

2267
01:25:05,940 --> 01:25:10,940
Strong 90s hotels in addition to the theme parks.

2268
01:25:12,020 --> 01:25:14,780
I think Maelstrom you'd put in that run too.

2269
01:25:14,820 --> 01:25:15,900
That's a good one.

2270
01:25:17,220 --> 01:25:18,380
That's a little generic,

2271
01:25:18,380 --> 01:25:22,060
but I think you gotta put Baxter in there.

2272
01:25:22,060 --> 01:25:24,420
I think the Baxter or when Disney World opened

2273
01:25:24,420 --> 01:25:25,660
that five-year chunk.

2274
01:25:25,660 --> 01:25:26,500
Sure, sure.

2275
01:25:27,620 --> 01:25:29,420
I remember, I'm just reporting news

2276
01:25:29,420 --> 01:25:30,780
from other theme park podcasts,

2277
01:25:30,780 --> 01:25:32,420
but I wanted the Jim Hill podcast.

2278
01:25:32,420 --> 01:25:33,820
I think he reported that Breck Eisner

2279
01:25:33,820 --> 01:25:36,700
was going to be directing the creature from the Black Lagoon

2280
01:25:36,700 --> 01:25:38,740
in the original Dark Universe.

2281
01:25:38,740 --> 01:25:39,580
Whoa.

2282
01:25:39,580 --> 01:25:40,420
Huh.

2283
01:25:40,420 --> 01:25:41,740
But obviously that fell apart

2284
01:25:41,740 --> 01:25:43,980
and now it's Blumhouse for those characters.

2285
01:25:43,980 --> 01:25:46,180
Boy, that could have been fun.

2286
01:25:46,180 --> 01:25:48,100
All right, well let's get one or two more.

2287
01:25:48,100 --> 01:25:48,940
Yeah.

2288
01:25:50,140 --> 01:25:51,420
Let's see here.

2289
01:25:54,780 --> 01:25:56,220
Somebody just said Stollywood,

2290
01:25:56,220 --> 01:25:57,980
which we haven't been through yet.

2291
01:25:59,940 --> 01:26:01,740
How many, okay here is a quick one.

2292
01:26:01,740 --> 01:26:03,260
How many of those cute waddle plushes

2293
01:26:03,260 --> 01:26:05,820
are you planning on buying when Galaxy's Edge opens?

2294
01:26:07,980 --> 01:26:08,820
One.

2295
01:26:08,820 --> 01:26:10,500
I'll say one.

2296
01:26:10,500 --> 01:26:11,340
Reasonable answer.

2297
01:26:11,340 --> 01:26:12,380
They're pretty tiny, right?

2298
01:26:12,380 --> 01:26:13,900
Like they're little guys.

2299
01:26:14,860 --> 01:26:16,460
You know what, I've been looking at a lot

2300
01:26:16,460 --> 01:26:20,180
of the pre-opening press and stuff and I'm like,

2301
01:26:20,180 --> 01:26:22,460
I don't know what souvenirs I really need from here.

2302
01:26:22,460 --> 01:26:26,180
I think the Toy Darien, like the toys that look

2303
01:26:26,180 --> 01:26:28,900
like they were hand sewn look pretty cool,

2304
01:26:28,900 --> 01:26:30,540
but I don't know if I would get anything.

2305
01:26:30,540 --> 01:26:35,540
Maybe if there's like metal desk stuff.

2306
01:26:35,540 --> 01:26:36,380
I don't know, I try to buy.

2307
01:26:36,380 --> 01:26:38,420
Do you want a nice paperweight or a pen set?

2308
01:26:38,420 --> 01:26:40,140
I almost said paperweight

2309
01:26:40,140 --> 01:26:42,300
and then I knew you would roast my ass.

2310
01:26:42,980 --> 01:26:45,980
Either something has to be really pleasing

2311
01:26:45,980 --> 01:26:48,540
to my aesthetics to buy at a theme park now

2312
01:26:48,540 --> 01:26:50,980
or needs to also serve a practical purpose.

2313
01:26:50,980 --> 01:26:52,700
I'll take the black spire outpost,

2314
01:26:52,700 --> 01:26:54,220
three hole punch please.

2315
01:26:55,900 --> 01:26:58,300
Michael, when was the last time you used a three hole punch?

2316
01:26:58,300 --> 01:26:59,140
I, not me, it's for you.

2317
01:26:59,140 --> 01:27:01,420
It's all PDFs now, baby.

2318
01:27:01,420 --> 01:27:02,380
I like to print it out.

2319
01:27:02,380 --> 01:27:03,220
I like to hold the paper in my hand.

2320
01:27:03,220 --> 01:27:04,780
I remember film school professors saying like,

2321
01:27:04,780 --> 01:27:09,460
make sure to have a box of brads at home, right?

2322
01:27:09,460 --> 01:27:11,380
That's what they're called to put scripts together.

2323
01:27:11,380 --> 01:27:12,500
Which if you bought one then,

2324
01:27:12,500 --> 01:27:14,620
you still have all those brads today.

2325
01:27:14,620 --> 01:27:16,220
2007.

2326
01:27:16,220 --> 01:27:18,420
I have those things like that, like Q-tips instead,

2327
01:27:18,420 --> 01:27:20,340
where you like, well, the one,

2328
01:27:20,340 --> 01:27:23,820
the package that I bought 15 years ago

2329
01:27:23,820 --> 01:27:25,100
is still what I have.

2330
01:27:27,340 --> 01:27:30,020
So if they have Q-tips, I'll get to Galaxy.

2331
01:27:30,020 --> 01:27:31,940
Oh, great, yeah, get some toiletries.

2332
01:27:31,940 --> 01:27:33,180
We got a good final one.

2333
01:27:33,180 --> 01:27:34,260
I've got one.

2334
01:27:35,340 --> 01:27:36,180
What, okay.

2335
01:27:36,180 --> 01:27:37,540
Is this final, is this a good final one?

2336
01:27:37,540 --> 01:27:38,380
Yeah, I think so.

2337
01:27:38,380 --> 01:27:39,200
Oh, okay, good.

2338
01:27:40,080 --> 01:27:43,560
Wins, Winsstinius on Instagram.

2339
01:27:43,560 --> 01:27:46,880
What's the single theme park experience you want to have,

2340
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:48,280
but have not yet?

2341
01:27:48,280 --> 01:27:51,760
Be it a ride or exclusive club or walk off

2342
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:54,040
or for Jason some tasty treat.

2343
01:27:54,040 --> 01:27:56,040
Okay, well, I do have other interests.

2344
01:27:56,040 --> 01:27:56,880
So.

2345
01:27:56,880 --> 01:27:59,880
But my answer would probably be.

2346
01:27:59,880 --> 01:28:01,080
Contain multitudes.

2347
01:28:01,080 --> 01:28:04,720
Eating at Victoria Albert at the Grand Luridie.

2348
01:28:04,720 --> 01:28:05,560
Uh huh.

2349
01:28:07,400 --> 01:28:08,240
Yeah.

2350
01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:11,040
I mean, it's tough.

2351
01:28:11,040 --> 01:28:11,880
There's too many.

2352
01:28:11,880 --> 01:28:12,800
There's not one.

2353
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:15,400
Obviously just Dollywood in general

2354
01:28:15,400 --> 01:28:16,880
is pretty high up there.

2355
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:20,360
But like going on Mystic Manor in Hong Kong,

2356
01:28:20,360 --> 01:28:22,160
I think about often.

2357
01:28:22,160 --> 01:28:24,660
There was an extra park there to really entice it,

2358
01:28:24,660 --> 01:28:26,200
entice me to go there.

2359
01:28:26,200 --> 01:28:28,680
You just had to deal with the city of Hong Kong.

2360
01:28:28,680 --> 01:28:30,000
Well, and that'll be fun too.

2361
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:31,400
I just like knowing there's like an extra,

2362
01:28:31,400 --> 01:28:32,920
because Disney Sea is such a great thing.

2363
01:28:32,920 --> 01:28:33,920
And then Disney, like.

2364
01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:34,760
Yeah, it needs more.

2365
01:28:34,760 --> 01:28:36,560
Because Tokyo, Hong Kong is just such a like,

2366
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:37,760
they're building it up now.

2367
01:28:37,800 --> 01:28:38,640
In a couple of years,

2368
01:28:38,640 --> 01:28:40,520
I think it'll be a little more special.

2369
01:28:40,520 --> 01:28:42,440
Yeah, I think it's a trip you do in a decade or something.

2370
01:28:42,440 --> 01:28:43,880
It's a little chintzy.

2371
01:28:43,880 --> 01:28:45,480
At least it had been for years.

2372
01:28:46,320 --> 01:28:48,320
Tron's out there for me.

2373
01:28:48,320 --> 01:28:49,160
Tron looks good.

2374
01:28:49,160 --> 01:28:50,000
Yeah, yeah.

2375
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:50,840
Yeah.

2376
01:28:50,840 --> 01:28:52,400
And soon at Disney World.

2377
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:53,240
But soon.

2378
01:28:53,240 --> 01:28:56,120
But now I'm also trying to think off of,

2379
01:28:56,120 --> 01:28:58,880
getting off of rides and what's just like,

2380
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:02,440
transcendent experience.

2381
01:29:02,440 --> 01:29:04,680
We got to do Club 33 that we,

2382
01:29:04,680 --> 01:29:06,120
hey, we've been having some good ones.

2383
01:29:06,120 --> 01:29:07,480
Yeah, talk to Tony Baxter.

2384
01:29:08,200 --> 01:29:10,560
Club 33, it's like so many have been checked.

2385
01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:11,400
Yeah.

2386
01:29:11,400 --> 01:29:12,600
Thanks, podcast.

2387
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:16,360
Yeah, I guess like working an hour on like Haunted Mansion

2388
01:29:16,360 --> 01:29:18,360
or something would be like.

2389
01:29:18,360 --> 01:29:19,520
You want to work a shift?

2390
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:22,320
I want to work a shift in a Haunted Mansion.

2391
01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:23,160
I would like.

2392
01:29:23,160 --> 01:29:24,880
Fish some ashes out of there, Mike.

2393
01:29:24,880 --> 01:29:25,720
Yeah, that's.

2394
01:29:25,720 --> 01:29:27,760
Somebody dumped ashes again.

2395
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:30,720
I would like to go in all of those locked buildings

2396
01:29:30,720 --> 01:29:33,440
we were not taken into at Disney Imagineering.

2397
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:35,040
Like we saw the public face.

2398
01:29:35,080 --> 01:29:36,760
We saw the lobbies in the manor,

2399
01:29:36,760 --> 01:29:38,960
hallway in the cafe, in the store.

2400
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:40,800
But I want to see those square.

2401
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:42,080
I'll sign NDAs.

2402
01:29:42,080 --> 01:29:45,320
I would like to lead a team of Imagineers building a ride.

2403
01:29:45,320 --> 01:29:46,160
Is that rude?

2404
01:29:46,160 --> 01:29:47,560
Does that count?

2405
01:29:47,560 --> 01:29:48,760
I'd like to be in charge.

2406
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:51,080
I guess that's partly.

2407
01:29:51,080 --> 01:29:52,360
Well, I still haven't been to Japan.

2408
01:29:52,360 --> 01:29:53,200
So I got all Japan.

2409
01:29:53,200 --> 01:29:54,880
You got to go to Japan.

2410
01:29:54,880 --> 01:29:55,720
I'm not sure.

2411
01:29:55,720 --> 01:29:58,040
I think this, this second gate episode

2412
01:29:58,040 --> 01:29:59,200
will have come out by now,

2413
01:29:59,200 --> 01:30:01,840
but you will have, if you check out the second gate,

2414
01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:03,760
and please do, you may have heard about my fondness

2415
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:07,040
for the Pan Galactic pizza port and Tony Solaroni.

2416
01:30:07,040 --> 01:30:10,200
If I could spend, if I could do a full loop

2417
01:30:10,200 --> 01:30:14,400
of that experience in Tony Solaroni's chair,

2418
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:16,560
just let me sit up there for 20 minutes.

2419
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:18,800
With like a jelly, a jelly drink,

2420
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:21,080
a jelly sparkling drink or whatever they sell.

2421
01:30:21,080 --> 01:30:23,040
Sure, that sounds nice.

2422
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:24,680
They got those alien mochis there.

2423
01:30:24,680 --> 01:30:27,000
So just give me, give me a handful of mochis

2424
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:30,880
and let me, let me experience what Tony Solaroni experiences.

2425
01:30:30,880 --> 01:30:32,400
Japan is light years ahead of us

2426
01:30:32,400 --> 01:30:34,480
when it comes to treats and snacks.

2427
01:30:34,480 --> 01:30:35,320
Unbelievable.

2428
01:30:35,320 --> 01:30:38,160
My final idea is that we could record a live podcast

2429
01:30:38,160 --> 01:30:40,960
of Cosmic Rays on the stage with Sonny Eclipse.

2430
01:30:42,120 --> 01:30:42,960
That's pretty good.

2431
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:43,780
That would be great.

2432
01:30:43,780 --> 01:30:44,620
I mean, it's never gonna happen.

2433
01:30:44,620 --> 01:30:46,240
Sure, I mean, just the other day,

2434
01:30:46,240 --> 01:30:49,080
one of the Disney executives was talking about,

2435
01:30:49,080 --> 01:30:50,880
the nice thing about owning Fox now is like,

2436
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:52,840
the characters in West Side Story can smoke.

2437
01:30:52,840 --> 01:30:55,200
We can't do that with the Disney smoking ban.

2438
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:58,480
And it's just like, what are you talking about?

2439
01:30:58,480 --> 01:30:59,720
What is going on?

2440
01:30:59,720 --> 01:31:01,520
So yeah, that's a real pipe dream

2441
01:31:01,520 --> 01:31:05,960
to let us foul mouse on the stage at a Disney restaurant.

2442
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:09,160
Yeah, we'd clean it up, but the reputation.

2443
01:31:09,160 --> 01:31:11,040
I mean, we did a legitimate run

2444
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:15,000
of his backwards planet names that was not even,

2445
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,320
I mean, there was some reference to, you know,

2446
01:31:17,320 --> 01:31:20,480
to Lynn Bodden and some dark stuff, but we'd clean it up.

2447
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:23,640
I find Sonny Eclipse's comedy legitimately funny.

2448
01:31:24,600 --> 01:31:27,400
I find Tony Solaroni funny as well.

2449
01:31:27,400 --> 01:31:29,440
So yeah, we can, we'll play in there.

2450
01:31:29,440 --> 01:31:30,280
We'll play ball.

2451
01:31:30,280 --> 01:31:31,100
Yeah.

2452
01:31:31,100 --> 01:31:32,260
We can play ball.

2453
01:31:32,260 --> 01:31:35,700
I just, you gotta convince the sharp pencil boys

2454
01:31:35,700 --> 01:31:37,260
in Burbank, cause they say.

2455
01:31:37,260 --> 01:31:39,100
Well, you know what, here's one more.

2456
01:31:39,100 --> 01:31:42,340
I want Cranium Command to come back

2457
01:31:42,340 --> 01:31:45,860
and I want us to be some of the body parts.

2458
01:31:45,860 --> 01:31:46,700
Oh, sure.

2459
01:31:46,700 --> 01:31:48,220
Us and some of our favorites.

2460
01:31:48,220 --> 01:31:52,140
You get a Mundy in there, you get a Bugsy in there.

2461
01:31:52,140 --> 01:31:53,340
Oh yeah.

2462
01:31:53,340 --> 01:31:55,740
He's like the bad, he's like,

2463
01:31:55,740 --> 01:31:57,660
the bad devil. I'm the bad thoughts

2464
01:31:57,660 --> 01:32:00,340
that you hide all the way in the back of your brain.

2465
01:32:00,340 --> 01:32:02,180
Maybe you should just go masturbate

2466
01:32:02,180 --> 01:32:03,580
instead of going to school.

2467
01:32:03,580 --> 01:32:06,660
I might should go nut a little while.

2468
01:32:07,620 --> 01:32:09,100
Have you seen the squid in the whale?

2469
01:32:09,100 --> 01:32:11,180
This isn't gonna help us get Disney on our side.

2470
01:32:11,180 --> 01:32:12,020
Oh, you're right.

2471
01:32:12,020 --> 01:32:12,860
Yeah, yeah.

2472
01:32:12,860 --> 01:32:14,620
This foul Cranium Command.

2473
01:32:14,620 --> 01:32:15,460
All right.

2474
01:32:15,460 --> 01:32:16,460
Well, that was fun.

2475
01:32:16,460 --> 01:32:17,300
That was fun.

2476
01:32:17,300 --> 01:32:19,260
Geez, keep sending questions.

2477
01:32:19,260 --> 01:32:22,820
And you know, we keep a document also where all of these go.

2478
01:32:22,820 --> 01:32:24,580
