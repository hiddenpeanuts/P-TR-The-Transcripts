00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Club 3

2
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Well guys, it was my turn this month to plummet straight to last place in the poll with a sitcom-oriented topic.

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I now know your pain, Mike, your frequent pain.

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I feel no pain when Mike... I feel...

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I'm maybe not even happy, but I don't even feel... I'm not upset at all.

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
You seem kind of proud in a way.

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I think so.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
To isolate that last place.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
You know, it didn't feel good, and I'll tell you why.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Sometimes you feel like people don't know what they're missing out on.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
That's something you've said before.

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Sure, that's true.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Have I quoted you on this before?

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Because I don't remember if this was on an episode or not.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
There was a while where I couldn't tell...

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I was like, I don't know if anybody's like...

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Because you would float the Annette test balloon every once in a while.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
And I think at some point I said, I don't feel like people are exactly clamoring for Annette.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
And you said, well, that's because they don't know what's coming.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
And then that was a very fun, perfectly good episode.

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
But I still am like, what was coming?

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
That was scary. It was kind of a threat.

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
What was coming was a girl with an OK voice singing some Sherman Brothers songs.

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
That's what was coming.

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
People didn't know.

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Pineapple princess.

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Yeah.

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Well, you know, but maybe I feel some of that on your behalf.

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Because in this case, this was listener submitted.

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
It's something I mentioned on the show before and it went straight to last place.

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
And I can't say I blame you.

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:02:00,000
But I think if you didn't vote for Jason Alexander's music video career, either you're confused by that phrase, which is pretty dull on its face.

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
But I think clearly if you didn't vote for that, then you don't know the Nickelback video,

34
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:23,000
trying not to love you, in which Jason Alexander plays a lovelorn barista who is trying to impress the girl of his dreams played by model Brooke Burns and trying to do so with impressive foam art.

35
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
He is using his foam to express his heart.

36
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:35,000
But then another barista shows up who is way better at foam art than he is.

37
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:46,000
And what I don't want to do is spoil who plays that part because either if either if we just declare we're going to do that episode or if you the listener wants to just go for it and watch it.

38
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
But I would not dare because I kind of forgot when it came up in the polls like, oh, I got to watch that again.

39
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
And I forgot who barista number two is played by.

40
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:03,000
He really drives up on like a little tiny motorbike straight into the store and like wearing like a like a fedora and a vest.

41
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
And he just like flips a sign that says help wanted the flips it as if to say not anymore.

42
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I work here now, fills out no paperwork, just starts doing foam art.

43
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
And I when when he turns around and you realize who it is, big moment.

44
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:27,000
So all I could say is you're missing out and you're also missing out on the on a great song by Nickelback and you're missing out on no visual appearance from Nickelback.

45
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
This is made completely outside of their purview.

46
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Do you think that with that little talk up, you could get it to a third or four like could come back in a club three or we just have to.

47
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:47,000
God, I don't know. It's still a little well, let me add to the let me add to the pot and say the reason that it's not just that one music video is that there's another.

48
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:59,000
There are count them, not one, but two Brad Paisley music videos starring Jason Alexander, one of which is also directed by Jason Alexander and stars him.

49
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
It's called Online.

50
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:14,000
The cast of this video includes William Shatner, Marsha Brady, herself, Maureen McCormick, George's mom on Seinfeld, reunited Estelle Harris and Taylor Swift.

51
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Taylor Swift and not just in like a zoom in cameo because this was like she was still on the rise.

52
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:27,000
So it was an honor for her to be a backup dancer for Brad Paisley backup dancer.

53
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Yes. Her and Kelly Pickler, I believe, are kind of like they, you know, it was a big slot to get a Brad Paisley video.

54
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:41,000
So I don't know. I don't want to submit the biggest chance I think that we'll ever get for any of these to sort of get their revenge.

55
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
And why I like to talk them up once in a while is that we've only done it once.

56
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
We did the poll where like a lot of old topics came back from the dead.

57
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I think it was called Topic Rewind. Oh, yeah.

58
00:04:50,000 --> 00:05:01,000
And we're overdue for that, but I feel like we sort of can't do it until we close out the current business of the poll, which once again remains the second place finisher.

59
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Bugman does whatever he wants.

60
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I feel like that needs to fully play itself out before we can do the topic rewind.

61
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Did you can I really quick rewind to Jason Alexander?

62
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm always the amount of stuff that he just pops up in, including motion capturing a robot in the electric state.

63
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I baffled me with that one.

64
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
You're kidding. The smash hit Netflix Brothers film, The Electric State.

65
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
He is in it, but he mocapped a robot.

66
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Do we know this character's name?

67
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I'm trying to the robot.

68
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I've been looking at you.

69
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I've been trying to find the name of the character.

70
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Oh, my God.

71
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Wow.

72
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
No, I'd never heard that.

73
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Ted Wingman.

74
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I think maybe the guy Ted with the robot's name is Ted Wingman.

75
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I think maybe he was like a guy in his head.

76
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
He's like his consciousness went into a robot or like, I don't know.

77
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I don't I haven't seen the film, but I just saw behind the scenes of mocap suit.

78
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Jason Alexander, like running around with Millie Bobby Brown.

79
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
And I was just like, what is this?

80
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,000
The top result when you look up Jason Alexander, Electric State is a post on the Seinfeld

81
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Reddit where the top comment is, yeah, besides Jason Alexander, that movie sure did suck.

82
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
It just plain sucked.

83
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I've seen movies suck before, but it was the suckiest bunch of sucks that ever sucked.

84
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Got to go. My damn wiener kids are listening.

85
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Turns into a Simpsons quote on the Seinfeld Reddit.

86
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I think there's some sincere, some sincere feelings to that post.

87
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
They got to fix those results.

88
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
That's number one is the movie.

89
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
And number two is, yeah, it sucked.

90
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Yeah, that's they should probably pay someone to get that knocked down.

91
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Yeah, but I don't know.

92
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I have a feeling there's not a lot of money left over.

93
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Me knowing nothing about Electric State.

94
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
My guess would be just knowing the Russos and the way they work.

95
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
My guess would be that the budget and marketing altogether were 800 million dollars,

96
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
which of course were recouped.

97
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
They always are.

98
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
The Russos, every single one of them is the highest.

99
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
They top themselves every single time, just like James Cameron.

100
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
The world's most expensive movies.

101
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
They play all around the world.

102
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
They're global.

103
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
They're global.

104
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
They sit until they're global.

105
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,000
And you know who's to blame for not recouping the Electric States, like all that money.

106
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
A single social media post from Rachel Ziegler.

107
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Oh, yes.

108
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
That's always to blame.

109
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Yes, absolutely.

110
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
She's got those lips.

111
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
So anyways, yeah, I don't know.

112
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Maybe Jason comes back.

113
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I'd like to see him.

114
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
He's got so much stuff.

115
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Yeah, because I think the music video career would also include that McDonald's commercial.

116
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
The McDLT commercial.

117
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
The hot stays hot and the cold stays cold.

118
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Jason, here he is.

119
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
He's back.

120
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
There he is.

121
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Sorry.

122
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
He's waking up.

123
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
No, no.

124
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I was silently watching the Trying Not To Love You video.

125
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Oh, very good.

126
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Oh, so now you know who the...

127
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I mean, don't say it, but you know who Barista 2 is?

128
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Yeah, I think so.

129
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I think so.

130
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
It's a little confusing.

131
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
It's a little confusing, but I think I got the joke.

132
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
It's a performer who's so engulfed in the part.

133
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
You question, is this a real character?

134
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Yeah.

135
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Yeah.

136
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:25,000
By the way, if you're hearing some birds and dog noises and stuff, you might not be.

137
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
But if you are, if you hear an ambulance go by, we're in a recording location we haven't

138
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
used in a minute, which is my garage.

139
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
We've been out of my garage for some time, but we figured it'd be good to bring it back

140
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:43,000
here, because we didn't want to stink up a studio at a place where it might linger for

141
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
a while.

142
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Maybe we wouldn't consider it a stink.

143
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Maybe these are good aromas.

144
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I guess that's what we're here to find out, because the winner of the poll triumphing

145
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
barely over Bugman, who I think was one of his strongest second place showings.

146
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
We'll find out next month how high within second place he goes.

147
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:08,000
But a solid winner and a fun idea is this, unlicensed theme park scented candles.

148
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
This idea comes to us from Mike D. Guglielmo.

149
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Spring is in the air.

150
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Let's discuss some unofficial unlicensed copyright skirting park scented candles from

151
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Etsy.

152
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:27,000
The boys can get a whiff of Caribbean waters, or passage flight, or butterscotch brew, or

153
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
ghostly manner, or the delightfully vague flume.

154
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Well, thank you, Mike, for that.

155
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
And you got your wish.

156
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:43,000
We are now here in a zone with compromised audio quality, but, you know, good air quality.

157
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Open air where all of these potentially conflicting scents that are laid out on a table in front

158
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
of us can waft and, you know, not bother anybody.

159
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Yeah.

160
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
So this general area, I think we were aware of this.

161
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I think probably we all had at least one somewhere in our collection.

162
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:13,000
But what I sense is the highest enthusiasm for this stuff, just before it was a topic,

163
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
these candles out in the world, comes from Jason.

164
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Because you see, you had a bunch of these.

165
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I had a bunch.

166
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
The ones I brought, I didn't realize.

167
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Besides like one, well, maybe two of them.

168
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
And I think there's a fourth hidden somewhere at home or burned out.

169
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Like we've actually used.

170
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Yes.

171
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Do you know what that's burned out?

172
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Like, I don't know what.

173
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
No, no, no, that's right.

174
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
No, it's just funny that you made a point.

175
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
You made a point of like, I'll bring some candles.

176
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I got them.

177
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
And then as soon as you open it, it's like a moth flew out.

178
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Those are all the way down to the wicks.

179
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Which shows that you're enthusiastic about.

180
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Yeah.

181
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Me and my partner.

182
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Blushing bride.

183
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Blushing bride.

184
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Yeah.

185
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:02,000
We burned through some of these and I don't know where my banshee flight one got to.

186
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Banshee flight, not flight of passage.

187
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Do you know?

188
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,000
But you know, it's kind of the same scent as this feet.

189
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Do you want me to talk about the ones I have?

190
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Do you want me to start or?

191
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Well, let's see.

192
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Should we like to explain this area a little bit first?

193
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I mean, I think Mike laid it out very nicely, but if you don't know this from the ground up,

194
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:33,000
there are a number of stores online that claim to kind of capture theme park scents within not just candles,

195
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:40,000
but I feel like also soaps or just spray bottles because there's so many wonderful smells in the world of theme parks.

196
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
We covered a lot of them in the fake smell final four.

197
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:50,000
So the thought would be that if some of these are simulated scents already,

198
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:57,000
maybe an outside person could make their their best guess and bottle them and sell them and you could bring them home.

199
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
And I think I'm trying to think.

200
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I mean, I don't remember these really existing or being popularized before 10 years ago,

201
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,000
but I think we've all kind of in our travels in the last 10 years like maybe I've gotten one as a gift.

202
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Maybe it seems like Mike, you've like explored them, you know, just for no particular reason,

203
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:33,000
because the idea of it is so nice to be able in the way that anything being like a warp tunnel that takes you straight to a theme park when you aren't at one sounds really nice in the way that like the right YouTube video can do it or like, you know,

204
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
having a car they Manhattan at home or whatever, approximating a food.

205
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:47,000
So the idea of it is so great and something as a smell that we desire to smell as much as the E.T. forest.

206
00:12:47,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I mean, like it feels like if it worked, the idea feels better than a drug that you could just like open, open a can and just go like, oh, Dennis Hopper, Blue Velvet style.

207
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Oh, yeah, I'm in the forest, baby.

208
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
A canister of the sense.

209
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
And you had the thing you put over your mouth and nose.

210
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I guess if you were being given oxygen at the hospital, yeah, yeah, that would be maybe more of the ultimate.

211
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Give it to me.

212
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Because this is yeah, because like the you know, you're a candle burns, the whatever wax, whatever you would call it.

213
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,000
And then the scent gets in the air, but it's not quite how the smell is transferred from a ride.

214
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
It's usually in a canister of some kind of some sort of diffuser, I'm assuming.

215
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Yes. Yeah.

216
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,000
So like little vents like that maybe are on the vehicle itself or in the environment.

217
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Yeah. Where I've kind of encountered this before, all the resorts, the casino hotels in Vegas all have particular sense.

218
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
And on the casino websites, you can buy a candle or like a diffuser.

219
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Is that right? Yeah.

220
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I think for a house warming, when Jane and I moved into our apartment, I got the Park MGM like a big candle.

221
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
No kidding.

222
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
And it smells lovely.

223
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:21,000
And there's a scent company, there's a fragrance company in Vegas that sells like the copyright skirting scents hotel by hotel.

224
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Sure, sure.

225
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
So you could get a Park MGM scented candle.

226
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Well, I got the official like the like official on the casino website.

227
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Smells like casino?

228
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
No, it's just kind of like a florally smell.

229
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:44,000
But you can buy like the mattresses from the Wynn, like the same mattresses they use at the casinos.

230
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
You can buy the literal bed.

231
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Not the literal bed, but like the same sort of, you know, model.

232
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I didn't know they were so open with like take our specific home.

233
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Take our, well, I think it's like a $2,000 mattress.

234
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Is it made specifically for the Wynn?

235
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I think that's the idea.

236
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Is that they craft, Steve Wynn crafted a mattress, went into the labs, the mattress labs, and said I want it like this and like this and like this.

237
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I don't think it's that specific.

238
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I think it's like the Cerda or whatever, the luxury hotel version.

239
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Well, he specifically has Wynn at home, a collection of.

240
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Okay, that one.

241
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Of Wynnons and bath goods.

242
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Is he still in charge of that aspect of the company?

243
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:40,000
It was not removed from, we are perfectly comfortable associating Steve Wynn and beds.

244
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
That's fine.

245
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
He can stay in the at home collection.

246
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
But yeah, dream beds, it says.

247
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Wynn at home.

248
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Wow, we worked with one of the world's finest manufacturers.

249
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
We did.

250
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
To create the Wynn dream bed.

251
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Oh, okay.

252
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
He was in the lab.

253
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
He was in the bed lab.

254
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Yeah.

255
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Lomping around.

256
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Yeah.

257
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Firmer, firmer.

258
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Less firm.

259
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Yeah, wow.

260
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Mattress only $2,400 and his name is like.

261
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
It's like a bunch of abstract swirls, but then it turns into his signature.

262
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Do you want to buy a pre haunted mattress?

263
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
We've got you.

264
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
We've got you set up.

265
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
It's like the canvas on a boxing ring on the mat.

266
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
It says Wynn on it.

267
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
It probably has a couple other ads.

268
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
The problem is you never want to like put covers on it because you just want to.

269
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Yeah, I want to see that name every time I dream.

270
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Jason, would you sell ad space on your mattress to different companies?

271
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Oh, like a car wrap?

272
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Yeah, a car wrap or I'm saying like the canvas on a boxing ring or how WWE now cuts a TKO.

273
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
But then who would say it's covered?

274
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
It would be primarily advertising to you and Jane.

275
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Okay.

276
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I suppose.

277
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Okay, well, I'm just asking like what brand would you feel like kind of like seeing on your mattress every night?

278
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Well, but you don't see your I'm telling you you there's like so many sheets and covers.

279
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Hold on.

280
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I'm correct.

281
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
No, no, you are correct.

282
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Hold on.

283
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Yeah, I haven't laid it out.

284
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I guess you're going to have a clear sheet over your mattress.

285
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
It's a Steve Wynn has developed a new clear sheet.

286
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:19,000
So now you can see the mattress underneath, but you still have the softness of the bed and the sheets and stuff.

287
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Folding a clear fitted sheet.

288
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
That's not going to be any easier.

289
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Might be confusing.

290
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Yeah.

291
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Yeah.

292
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I don't know.

293
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Like what brand do we like?

294
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I'd be okay.

295
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
We get Taco Bell pretty regularly.

296
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Do you want a Taco Bell mattress?

297
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Well, if it's just like the old, you know, it's just a little purple and the bell, you know.

298
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I'm bored with him.

299
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
What are you saying here?

300
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Taco Bell.

301
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I thought you would like that too.

302
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
It's not so much that they made.

303
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,000
It's just that you it's it's branding to remind you that when you wake up, you should get Taco Bell.

304
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Well, okay.

305
00:17:52,000 --> 00:18:01,000
If waking up, that's a good like if it was the Dunkin Donuts, it was the logo and the guy, Fred, who would make the doughnuts.

306
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Fred, you want the guy.

307
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Like a little caricature.

308
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Yeah.

309
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
You want him on your bed?

310
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I want him on his bed.

311
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
It's time to make the doughnuts.

312
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
It's time to make the doughnuts.

313
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
You wake up.

314
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Which could become a catchphrase before a certain act in this bed.

315
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Yeah.

316
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
All right, baby.

317
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Time to make the doughnuts.

318
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Jason pretends this hasn't always been the catchphrase.

319
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:33,000
This isn't a massive like thought out Sherlock Holmes plan.

320
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:40,000
As if as if either of you need a reminder when you wake up to go to Taco Bell or Dunkin Donuts that day.

321
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Oh, right.

322
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
It would just be nice.

323
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I'm neglecting this brand.

324
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Well, you know, also because it would just be good for like, you know, if you're doing like influence influencer style posts, you know, it's like hear me in front of the.

325
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Which neither of you guys are.

326
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I think you're missing out on a whole area.

327
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Not yet, because Jason doesn't have Fred from Dunkin Donuts on his bed.

328
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
We got the Fred.

329
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
We got the Fred mattress, you know, cost about four grand.

330
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
It's worth every penny.

331
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Get to see Fred at Fred every time I wake up.

332
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Sometimes look over, you know, during the act.

333
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
See Fred.

334
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I pretend he's encouraging me, pushing me on.

335
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Was Fred.

336
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Oh, go buddy.

337
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Was Fred an actor or did he actually make doughnuts?

338
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I can't remember the full details.

339
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Long dead.

340
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Right.

341
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Yeah, he is long dead.

342
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Read the Baker.

343
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I think this was a legit.

344
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I think this was the magic of entertainment that they hired an actor and they didn't hire him because of baking.

345
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Well, maybe, you know, because Dave Thomas was a real guy.

346
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
He was the guy and he was in all the ads.

347
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
So well, he did own the company.

348
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
No, I know that.

349
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I'm just saying it's not impossible that they would have put a guy that actually has something to do with it.

350
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
It doesn't appear to be the case.

351
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:50,000
It could have been like, you know, finding a starlet working at Schwab's Pharmacy.

352
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
The ad guy.

353
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Your version of a starlet would be finding a baker.

354
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:02,000
The ad guy goes into Dunkin Donuts and he's like, man, that baker has a certain shine to him.

355
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:08,000
There's a charisma radiating from him as he does the glazed blueberries.

356
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I guess this is Jason's dream when he moved to Los Angeles.

357
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
He thought, well, all right, step one, go to Schwab's Pharmacy.

358
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Step two, meat producer.

359
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Step three, Baffo Bucks.

360
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
The system hasn't changed since 1956.

361
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
That's true.

362
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
OK, it appears Schwab's is now a hustler superstore.

363
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
But there is a restaurant.

364
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Oh, I'm confused now.

365
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Yeah.

366
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
There is coffee.

367
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
By the way, just to circle back on something.

368
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Google's wind dream bed ended up on something called on the forums of something called The Mattress Underground.

369
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
And here's a review from July 2022.

370
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
If you ever think to buy the wind dream bed, hotel bed, don't do it.

371
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,000
The mattress is made by Sealy Posturepedic and I can say is the worst mattress I've ever tried.

372
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Very hard and uncomfortable.

373
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
They don't offer returns or refunds at all and you will be scammed with that trash.

374
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I hope I can help someone not to waste the money there.

375
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
They claim is the best sleep you ever had.

376
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
LMAO.

377
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:17,000
So I think we may have like we may have sparked to the idea of the wind dream bed a little too hard, which I guess is just Sealy.

378
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
You see, I read a long feature article once though.

379
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I am a little skeptical of mattress review websites because when the box mattress that ships your home, all those startups came up.

380
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:42,000
They they started there were mattress influencers and people started getting mattresses and then people started writing real reviews and fake reviews.

381
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
And like it got very like there were fines.

382
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
People weren't tell they wouldn't tell you were advertising.

383
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,000
So that review very likely true.

384
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,000
But there is a chance it was planted by a competitor.

385
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:09,000
But from the name, I think it's possible that the mattress underground is the real website where you avoid all of this chicanery that you're talking about.

386
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:18,000
The mattress underground may have risen up as a resistance in response to all this grim mattress controversy.

387
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Some people call the mattress underground a terrorist organization, but some of us say they're freedom fighters.

388
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
So it depends what your philosophy is on some of this stuff.

389
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I believe in the mattress underground.

390
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I am signing up for the mattress underground.

391
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I will leave my home and family to join the mattress underground.

392
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
People think that's righteous, a righteous cause.

393
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:44,000
That's what that Pepsi come to join the conversation of commercial.

394
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
That was a mattress underground demonstration.

395
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Yeah, I think you know what?

396
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I think Jason just doesn't want to lose a possible Sealy endorsement in the future.

397
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:58,000
He just doesn't want to trash Sealy right here because he wants the possibility of getting a free Sealy mattress.

398
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Yeah, I have forgotten the names of all the mattress companies.

399
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I forget what you're still in business and what you bought dad's on the show.

400
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I think it's well, if we did an ad read for it in 2018, that probably means it's gone out of business.

401
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I think they just like a lot of those companies just are cannibalizing each other, just are buying each other up and stuff.

402
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Michael Vail passed away 20 years ago and he was an actor.

403
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Who's Michael Vail?

404
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
He was the donut guy.

405
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Fred is the donut.

406
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Well, I hate to break it to you.

407
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
His real name.

408
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Boy, this is going to upset you.

409
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
That was Sedonomous?

410
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
What?

411
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
It was a pseudonym?

412
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Oh, wow.

413
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Is that a word?

414
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Sedonomous?

415
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Yeah, I always thought that was a word.

416
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Yeah, you're probably right.

417
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
That's a big awesome word actually.

418
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Yeah, I've never used it either.

419
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Sedonomous.

420
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I don't even know if I've heard of it.

421
00:23:51,000 --> 00:24:00,000
On Wikipedia, they describe him as an American character actor famous for being the longtime sleepy-eyed mascot, Fred the Baker, for donut change.

422
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Sleepy-eyed mascot.

423
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Amazing we haven't done more Fred the Baker talk.

424
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:22,000
There's a great like 30, I think it's an account that posts like old archive footage from is it WGHB Boston with a public TV station in Boston.

425
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:29,000
And it's all just people drinking like cups of coffee at the like one of the first Dunkin Donuts.

426
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:40,000
And like just imagining a Dunkin Donuts with like a diner counter and like ceramic china and just all these old miserable people drinking the coffee.

427
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Would that be your version of the of the building an oval office in your house if you had the room?

428
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Yeah, replicating that.

429
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Replicating an old Dunkin Donuts with a bunch of old men sadly or angrily sipping coffee.

430
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Well, that's I kind of forget where I read this or heard this.

431
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,000
But Tom Petty, do you know the Tom Petty coffee story?

432
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
I don't think so.

433
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I don't think so.

434
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Someone was interviewing Tom Petty and he said, hey, do you want to water a cup of coffee?

435
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
He's like, oh, I'd love a cup of coffee.

436
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
He's drinking it.

437
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:16,000
And he's like, Tom, I got to tell you, this is like the best cup of coffee I ever had.

438
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:29,000
And he tells a long story that Tom Petty and his girlfriend at the time were coming back from somewhere, stopped at a diner and Tom Petty liked the coffee so much.

439
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
He bought the industrial.

440
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:37,000
He bought the same model of industrial coffee maker for his house.

441
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
And I believe maybe even had two of them.

442
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,000
But like Tom Petty is like, you're not the first person to say you like the coffee here.

443
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
But apparently, apparently it was just Maxwell House.

444
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Yeah, it was just Maxwell House.

445
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Going automatic.

446
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
It was just like diner ass coffee.

447
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Interesting.

448
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,000
It's funny that this was like this anecdote got out.

449
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Like, who do you remember where you heard this?

450
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,000
I think it was someone writing a book or profile on Tom Petty.

451
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
It doesn't.

452
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Yeah, it's in Petty, the biography.

453
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Wow.

454
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
I have a question.

455
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
How do you think you spell pseudonym?

456
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Well, you spell it like pseudonym, but you put it O-U-S on.

457
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Okay.

458
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Pseudonyms.

459
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Pseudonymous.

460
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
It sounds right.

461
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Yes.

462
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Oh, yeah.

463
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
I was spelling it wrong.

464
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Yeah.

465
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Pseudonyms.

466
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
It's like pseudonym.

467
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
That's a really good vocabulary.

468
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Pseudonymous.

469
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Wow.

470
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
The pseudonymous author of this mystery is the example.

471
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Wow.

472
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Well, thank you for that education.

473
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Anyway, so I love you, Fred.

474
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Thinking about you, brother.

475
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
We miss you every day.

476
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
We miss you in your pseudonymous ways.

477
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
I'm not saying Michael, I'm saying Fred.

478
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:51,000
So I think the other thing to highlight about the candles is that in sort of a unlicensed Halloween costume way,

479
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:59,000
they have to use all of these generic terms because none of them are Disney affiliated.

480
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Or universal affiliated.

481
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Well, hold that.

482
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Well, yes, yes, yes.

483
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Hold that thought.

484
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
But I'm trying to think of a good example.

485
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:13,000
One of mine, Park Sense, is allowed to say extraterrestrial adventure, which is pretty close.

486
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:19,000
But you sort of have to, they all have to kind of word soup it a little bit to get like passage flight.

487
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:27,000
And then if you end up on, like here I'm on Magic Candle Company's website, they have one called Banshee Flight.

488
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,000
And you click on that and they can't say it's a smell like from Avatar Flight of Passage.

489
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Right.

490
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:39,000
It is a fragrance that captures the thrill of taking flight over an otherworldly landscape.

491
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Stuff like that.

492
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:47,000
It's an invitation for your imagination to embark on an aromatic aerial adventure.

493
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Spread your wings and embrace your adventurous spirit as you discover new horizons

494
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
and experience the thrill of taking flight over an exotic landscape today.

495
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,000
This is, I mean, we're going to do like equivalence of this.

496
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
We're going to smell equivalence of this.

497
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:07,000
And that'll be the question is like, does it make us feel like we are, we have answered an invitation of to our imagination?

498
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Yeah.

499
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Aromatic aerial.

500
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
It's a lot of pressure.

501
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Or does it just smell like a nice soap or something?

502
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
I guess that's what we're going to have to cut.

503
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Yeah.

504
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:25,000
I also, something I noticed, they all like, they can't, they have to like evoke the feeling, but they can't show you the real thing.

505
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:30,000
So especially Magic Candle Company on their website, it's a lot of like very AI feeling.

506
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Like here's AI spitting out its closest equivalent to the Grand Floridian.

507
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Right.

508
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
It's kind of a bummer because I don't think they were doing that a few years ago.

509
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Like these designs, I think, are real designs.

510
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:51,000
But the background in a lot of the links is kind of like the AI goo art, which I don't love.

511
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:56,000
And it's unfortunate because they already had very nice like human designs on them.

512
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Yeah.

513
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:04,000
It's also, I do want to, this is a thing I think about sometimes now because I'm so like radar focused on like, oh, AI, that's AI.

514
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
That looks like AI.

515
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Sure.

516
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Sometimes maybe it's just bad art.

517
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Maybe it just looks like shit.

518
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
This is true.

519
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
It is possible.

520
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
I'm not saying this specific.

521
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:19,000
I'm just saying that this is a thought I had the other day where I go, am I just so like hyper aware of AI that now I'm just calling something shitty AI?

522
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Sometimes could just be very bad graphic.

523
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Yes.

524
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:30,000
But I agree that the candles themselves, you know, just what's on the like, at least, you know, I bought a few from PerkSense.

525
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:36,000
And this is just very like simple, clean, classy design.

526
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
You know, they evoke as best they can.

527
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Like ET, I'm looking at, you know, just outline of the forest.

528
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Yeah.

529
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
You know, and bikes going over the moon.

530
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
But they're changed.

531
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:50,000
You know, they're changed to like a kind of wagon bike that doesn't I don't think exist in reality.

532
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
They've all got it.

533
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
That looks like an Amish.

534
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
We're sent buggy.

535
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Yeah.

536
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
No, very strange.

537
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:04,000
This might be a good place to start because I think like, you know, this, as I said, this is a smell that we're chasing.

538
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
And I feel like we have a few.

539
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Do you have an equivalent of this?

540
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Maybe we can kind of mix and match.

541
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Let me read the copy on this.

542
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Oh, trouble.

543
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Grab your bike, your interplanetary passport and meet your friends in this rich nostalgic forest.

544
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
It's time for an adventure.

545
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
So they get a lot of quotes out.

546
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
They aren't afraid.

547
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
You know, I think they've looked into how close can we get with this copy?

548
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,000
And I wonder if they've looked into or just like did it.

549
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
And it's not worth litigating.

550
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Yeah, maybe.

551
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Yeah. Because, look, universal, put your money where your mouth is.

552
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
If you have a problem with this, you have the real smell.

553
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Bottle the real smell.

554
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Don't let all these third parties profit from it.

555
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Like, you know, yeah, it's their loss for not giving people something they clearly want.

556
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:57,000
So I'm going to light this one up because I'm definitely curious how close we can and maybe we can kind of compare contrast.

557
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Can we maybe do smells before the and then light?

558
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Yeah, sure. Let's pass it because it's sort of different smells beforehand.

559
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Now, here's something.

560
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Here's something that I detect as we begin smelling these candles.

561
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,000
I detect that we are all going to be terrible at describing smells.

562
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Yeah, it's very hard.

563
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
It's a very difficult thing to do.

564
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Things that you can look at.

565
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
I think you can do.

566
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
But like anybody try.

567
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,000
What can? Oh, this is what I'm the most nervous about about.

568
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Yeah, go ahead.

569
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Give it a give it a shot.

570
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Well, hold on.

571
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Let me just want to theater of the mind.

572
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Yeah, yeah.

573
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Listeners smelling.

574
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Sniffing.

575
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Oh, is it their nose or yours?

576
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:44,000
There's like a vanilla vanilla.

577
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
No, maybe I'm wrong.

578
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
What if Jason's killer at it?

579
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
I know I would love it if he is.

580
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
I don't know how to can I even begin?

581
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Because I think what we'll do is like I think we'll end up doing a lot of like, you know, it's very like it's very it's very calming.

582
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Detecting notes of my nose is already starting to get irritated.

583
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Well, yes, this is the whole thing I was about to say.

584
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
I'm a quick candle guy.

585
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
I do not.

586
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:13,000
I do not like a candle burning for hours.

587
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
I don't.

588
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
We never do this in the house.

589
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
We do not.

590
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
We've never taken to this.

591
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:27,000
I feel sometimes the influence of my father when I was a senior in high school, but still living in the house and pretending that I was a looser, chiller person than I was.

592
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:32,000
And I remember lighting up some incense in my bedroom.

593
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:46,000
And that was going for about five minutes when my dad woke up, I think from us being asleep, stormed to my room all the way across the house and said no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

594
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Yeah.

595
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
He was right.

596
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
You're a child of the 60s, Father.

597
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
You should know this better than anybody.

598
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
You have put truly in your blood.

599
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:00,000
No, I and I did kind of stick with me.

600
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
I don't know.

601
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,380
I you know I'd light up some incense in college or whatever, but not not not these days

602
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:10,180
I like I like you turn you light a candle for five ten minutes. You blow it out. I am NOT

603
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:12,640
I'm kind of like that too. Well. I'm terrified

604
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:19,420
Something's gonna catch on fire. I'm terrified. I'm so sure nowadays and a senior dog

605
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:25,300
Like it just makes me so nervous having that you have a sink as you have a senior dog

606
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:29,640
Yeah, I've seen you're like an old dog. Just wandering around stumbling into things

607
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:34,480
I'm like like if you have kind of a loose Ikea shelf and the dog just like

608
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:42,920
Walks into the oh, yeah, yeah, and I I just feel like guys so many goddamn books and cut

609
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:48,840
Let's just like oh, that's going up like like yeah, well this can read so much. He's got no

610
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:56,800
Basically the New York library on eBay

611
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:03,120
Much stuff in there well, then let's be let's be careful handling these I suppose. Let's not light my garage

612
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,640
How do we all like to light a candle mmm?

613
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,640
With that with a lighter. What are you?

614
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,320
lighter or one of the

615
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:16,420
Forever like we're not brother. I got a list okay here. See there. We go

616
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:18,420
This is

617
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:24,180
Assuming well, no, that's just that's just a cheap a bit lighter

618
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:29,460
But we can only got one a long big candlestick lighters mmm

619
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:34,200
You can just get it in any store assuming it works correctly sometimes. They're a little finicky

620
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:40,060
But I love a stick match or a book match is very satisfying well

621
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:42,860
I thought I was that's what I was wondering with you especially the way

622
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:49,040
I bet you've especially as a once-in-a-while cigarette smoker. I bet you love that match

623
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:56,140
I love it, and and I forget the the folding the match book over and pulling it you feel like you're a detective

624
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,820
Yeah, and you light a cigarette outside of the

625
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:02,060
sexy dames

626
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:07,260
Helping with the I feel like people have definitely why are you leaving a joint with a match?

627
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:11,340
I was like I don't know it's fun for me

628
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:14,340
Well you get a little thrill out of the

629
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:21,780
We've never talked about it. I knew I yeah, I knew it. Yeah, that's why I knew this guy had had lighting opinions

630
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:24,260
I knew the match. I knew match book 2 was part of it

631
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:29,940
I'm just gonna use this Bic with kind of a long so long and now those guys are here very hard

632
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:34,300
No, well, we're seeing that are they I haven't found it hard. I got this on the way to a

633
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:40,340
Birthday party for my oldest son listener. He is five years old now believe it

634
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:43,820
We are long this shows been going

635
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:49,340
This is a combo I used to have these and I know about the marketing

636
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:55,060
This is a combo Bic lighter and like candle shorter candlestick lighter

637
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:58,640
Martha Stewart and Snoop Dogg, I believe did

638
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:01,340
Advertisements for this for this bit

639
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:07,020
Specific bigger a different like they're like you can light up lots of things wink

640
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:13,740
That's for the odd pairing I see yeah, okay, okay satisfied well this

641
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:19,100
Children's birthday party candles and nice

642
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:22,860
ETSI scented candles for good boys

643
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:29,180
It also said to cut the wick a little bit of food. Nope. No, not even that. Okay, let's see and

644
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:31,220
And

645
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:34,780
This is not

646
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:37,580
Wasted time and as we signed up stuff

647
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:40,020
I I'll say this while we're waiting and while you're sniffing

648
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:43,540
I just bought a lighter on the way over here at a gas station and

649
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:48,500
There was a bunch of different designs on the Bic lighters and the guy looked at me

650
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:54,280
He looked at the different designs. He chose for me and said, you know, you a turtle guy

651
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:57,840
And he should and I go I am a turtle guy

652
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:01,360
And he goes, yeah, here you go. And he hands me this and it's a turtle

653
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:09,160
It's not a ninja turtle, but a like Lisa Frank look at Frank turtle. Yeah. Yeah, and I was like, well he you had my number

654
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:14,280
Also, my nose is like stuff today. Geez. Well, you're disqualified

655
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:19,280
You just really sucked that back because you look really upset. I took like a hit of it

656
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:26,280
Well, you guys almost got burned in the face this is gonna I feel like some listeners maybe know already this is heading for the first

657
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,560
on-air fire

658
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:32,960
One of the last times we were here the police came now fire departments gonna come this is here you go. All right

659
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:39,040
Oh, I'm careful with that. It's also because it's also tough because the smell was stronger when that wasn't lit

660
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:44,560
Yeah, that's what I'm thinking now. You're getting a lot of burning smell in addition in addition to the smell of

661
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:50,280
Fire wick. Yeah, you're getting wick. Yeah, you know, it's very fiery. I sense since notes

662
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:54,600
Yeah, is it is it better if we put the candle closer to you?

663
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:59,520
I don't know. It's also this card table feels like it could just go this feels. Yes, it could. Yes

664
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:07,220
Mmm, but you doesn't smell like it's supposed to is really the question. Well, it smells like warmth Michael

665
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:11,120
Well, go lick and off. I don't know I

666
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:14,040
You know not to jump

667
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:19,380
I have an ET one too. And I think there is I'm gonna blow my nose on Mike real quick

668
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:23,600
This is gonna be we have backed into the darkest episode

669
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:28,800
Oh my sinuses Mike Mike walked into my apartment once recently

670
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:33,400
I forgot whether Jane had perfume on or we had like a room spray. It was incense

671
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:39,820
Oh, it was not polos on I think was saying it was not perfect. I go who's wearing perfume in here. She

672
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,440
She burned sage a lot. Yeah

673
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:47,600
Sometimes and I said our other guy did I oh maybe was sage. Did I say something about ghosts or something?

674
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:51,840
I was like, are we getting ghosts out of here? I think you said your eyes hurt. Oh, yes

675
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:56,000
I walked in within. Oh, sorry within 45 seconds. My eyes were like burning. Yeah

676
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:03,800
I think Jason's glasses are fogging and I sense that you're kind of getting a little sniffly because of this too

677
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:08,200
I got really close to it. Okay. Also, it's not just if it's just going

678
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:12,560
I gotta say not just striking the match being a favorite pastime

679
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:17,000
but I used to love going to bed bath and beyond and I think

680
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:24,160
Like go into the Yankee Candle section go like oh, which one will I buy today? Oh cupcake

681
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,880
Yeah, I would smell

682
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:32,060
Cupcake candle for this Yankee doodle damn. Do I do I what?

683
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
cupcake or vanilla

684
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,280
and then I

685
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:43,240
Would take home and I would like he walks up. I would like a candle at like 21 22

686
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:47,200
I'd be like, I'm I'm an adult. I am buying

687
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,880
home goods

688
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:56,840
This is for my home. Wow, or my furnishing. This is not just I don't want just a cupcake sniff. We've

689
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:04,520
I've also I've been having the worst allergies of my Los Angeles life in the last two weeks. Also, it's been pretty bad

690
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:09,240
Yeah, it's been crazy. Like I touch my I like what is making it because it's windy or what?

691
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,640
I just live with spring and pollen and shit

692
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:17,800
I think I'm like if you touch my eye and it literally I was driving and it was 20 minutes of just like I need

693
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:22,880
To get I need to pull over my left eye is unusable because I've touched my eye

694
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:30,160
Not not you Mike, but Mike D. Guglielmo. Are you happy you have created the most grandma episode ever?

695
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:38,000
Let's let's trend let's use a bunch of candles to transform the boys into three grandmas. I am jacked. I am thriving

696
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:44,200
I'm locked in I love smelling candles. Yeah seem jacked though. Um, no, this is some

697
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:50,720
Jack talking about Bed Bath and Beyond about a minute. I'm just reminiscing about that cupcake can right? That's a different deal

698
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:55,280
Well, but then I okay, so here's what I know close

699
00:40:55,320 --> 00:41:01,520
Is it from my van it from from over here you have the candle now by your computer it does smell close

700
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:05,080
I think it was better before the well, that's not what I'm saying

701
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:09,680
Let's light up this other one unless it's already burnt to the bottom. So what's yours yours is mine?

702
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:12,380
It was from sense extraterrestrial adventure yours is

703
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,040
extraterrestrial forest

704
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:21,440
This is magic candle company. This was a gift from a listener a number of years ago and thank you so much

705
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:26,760
I'm terrible with names, but thank you again for this. Do you want me to light it?

706
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,680
Yes

707
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:36,080
Down there I got to do it cuz I got I got the Martha Stewart Reacher you got the Cruella De Vil cigarette

708
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:40,380
Length the penguin cigarette holder looking

709
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:43,960
extraterrestrial forest features top notes of

710
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,600
metallic and moss

711
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:49,080
metallic followed by my notes

712
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:53,080
Middle notes of fur needles and musk all

713
00:41:53,960 --> 00:42:00,600
Resting upon faith notes of balsam and sandalwood. Okay. So now a thing about magic

714
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:04,120
You know company they have these very distinct wooden wicks

715
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:09,880
So Scott when you like this be very careful as they have a tendency to pop. Ah

716
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:11,800
Yeah

717
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:15,360
Like ashes no way to stun. I have an old

718
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:20,880
I have like an eight or nine year old magic candle company candle here with different graphic

719
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,400
Smell like anything and this is still smell

720
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:30,000
Okay, this isn't all this is going on here

721
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,280
I don't think I think maybe some of this I think a lot of the magic is faded over here

722
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,040
You look like you do

723
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:40,000
I mean you you were saying you only can last five or ten minutes with a candle but you've been really well

724
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:46,640
You know what it Jane likes to take baths and on the bathroom counter is show light a candle and

725
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:52,920
Really the candle she's the candle fiend of the two of the candle fiend I would say and

726
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:57,920
It's like all the way above the wax. I don't know if we're getting any wax on this thing

727
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
The heat is melting it for sure

728
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:09,880
Well, hold on a sec you just lit it, okay. Yeah. All right. All right

729
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:12,960
So we have to almost like do this in advance and check in on them

730
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:18,040
We know what we should do is we should have like we should like have hotboxed each other

731
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:23,240
We should get like a tube of paper towel like a paper towel roll tube

732
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:30,680
Yeah, and then blow them to each other's mouths get a good idea. Get a big puff of it. Yeah. Yes. All right pucker up

733
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,560
It is vaguely sexual I suppose

734
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:38,520
It was done that was done to me maybe 25 years ago

735
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:41,240
Which is done to you

736
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:48,160
Yes, in the sense that some rowdy your friends did something like that to me and it made me feel crazy

737
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,160
Was it ET smell or was it drugs?

738
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:59,400
They hot they blew it at you in a tube, yeah, why'd they do that to mess me up? Okay

739
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:04,880
Yeah, did they did they ask your permission or they don't call? Oh my god. Don't recall Mike

740
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:07,040
We're unlocking traumatic memories

741
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:12,520
Yeah, you know you're right. It's hard when you trust that's what's happening here with Mike de Guglielmo is doing this with you

742
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:14,960
Like you know, we didn't necessarily consent

743
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:20,880
This is right back to your hotbox scenario. Look three is all not consenting to the top

744
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:26,480
You can surely by the way Mike you can do that without devices. What do you mean? If your lover?

745
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:33,320
Takes a hit of a joint holds it in for a second and then breeze it into your like makes out

746
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,440
We know what

747
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:43,720
You and breeze it into your mat then you can exhale and you will get

748
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:46,160
very high

749
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:48,760
Yes, you how much how often?

750
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:55,640
Oh, not all can you do that once like do you take multiple because one of those seems like it would be a lot

751
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:57,880
Sometimes you don't get a lot

752
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:01,680
but the thing that will really mess you up is if you

753
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,400
You know take a hit

754
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:09,200
Breathe a little out breathe back in breathe a little out breathe back it you will be on the moon

755
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:12,040
Yeah, but you like being on the moon

756
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:16,760
I don't the moon isn't so fun for me that version of the moon at least well occasionally

757
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:24,800
But it's a thing do it outside and then I immediately want to go into my locked home and it just turned on the television

758
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:30,040
So it sounds like you don't like it either. Yeah, this was described as this grand romantic gesture

759
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:34,040
But now you've just described coming in putting the lock on wait to make sure no

760
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:40,560
Yeah next to my loving white like I hang out with my loving what I mean, why was the lock part of it?

761
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:45,720
Huh, what is what are you worried about with the lock? I don't know other people. I just don't like other people

762
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:47,720
There's a bit of paranoia in there. Oh

763
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:54,100
I've been getting robbed while you're super high. It doesn't sound good. No, I wouldn't want it. Yeah, that'd be upsetting

764
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:56,360
Okay, so it is good though

765
00:45:56,920 --> 00:46:02,320
You're describing a good yeah, yeah, you say it's fine. No, it's fun. Oh, okay. It's fun. Mm-hmm

766
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:07,560
Okay, watch that watch all of these burning. We don't have to have them all burning at once. We could blow that out

767
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:10,600
Are we done with this or don't with that one?

768
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:14,080
Let's see if we can get a good cuz I'm getting I'm getting two smells now

769
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:18,800
I'm getting two different smell profiles at once. Mm-hmm, and I just I don't want to get messed up

770
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:24,080
I just have the question that one you were just what you were just what you were describing Jason sounded like a grand romantic

771
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:28,000
Gesture, but it also seems like it goes straight into watching food that saved America

772
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:40,560
Will like pull them old mic trip just DJing music videos an old mic trick

773
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:47,440
Mike invented playing different news for fun. Tastemaker Mike showed I got this idea

774
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:52,560
I showed him so okay. Get ready your minds about to be blown as if you were getting hotboxed

775
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:55,260
I thought this was just a nice memory

776
00:46:56,120 --> 00:47:00,120
Mike used to love that people over it is nice you up it is nice

777
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:04,360
It is but the old Mike trick. It's Mike's old trick. I

778
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:14,480
Sorry if you've ever found yourself watching old music videos, you don't even know who invented that for you to do me

779
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:20,840
I did it. I emailed YouTube one day Jason hadn't met Mike. He wouldn't know like 80% of what he knows

780
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:24,040
You're lucky you met this guy except for that big word he

781
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:31,600
Town and I go like I do you want to know what synonymous is

782
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:38,160
Yeah, okay. I think that the first ET candle smells better or stronger than this one

783
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:41,160
But there's also very

784
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:46,200
Talked up and I'll bring some of my candles then they come in and there's no wax left and they're all like rusty

785
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:49,640
There is a plenty of way like plenty of wax has been melted here. Sure

786
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:54,600
So I'm yes, there's not as much wax as that one, but it looks like a fun campfire. I

787
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:59,080
Guess it does look like a fun campfire. So magic candle company

788
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:04,840
They have these lovely large tins that you get to keep these lovely large tins now

789
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:13,440
They have these distinctive wooden wicks, which like I said, they do sparkle they do pop a little

790
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:21,440
But here's a tip for everyone now, you don't want to burn a candle usually it says an hour or two hours

791
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:28,200
Max on the burns before you blow them out. But if you would like to keep the container your candle is in

792
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:34,520
Put it when the fire is out and the wax is cooled down put it in the freezer

793
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:39,520
Then the wax will harden and you can kind of chip it out and then you can wash out the container

794
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:46,080
Or you can pour some ice water into the used wax and that will cause it to break up

795
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:53,800
Okay, then what do you do in the container? It just becomes why you can put a paper clips in it or a pencils or we?

796
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:55,800
Maybe knickknacks

797
00:48:56,080 --> 00:49:01,880
Dry this flower. Well, not any of these containers, but maybe some other time have a taller candle

798
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:08,840
He's right about that. Why this one you could put pencils. Why this would be great for quarters if you need quarters for your laundry

799
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:12,840
This would be great for quarters. He's right orders could fit in here

800
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:16,520
Well, this freezer tip is interesting and that's something you definitely didn't learn from Mike

801
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:19,720
It that's not an old Mike trick. He did not learn that from me

802
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:23,920
Um, that doesn't smell good to me or like anything these these are not that way

803
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:28,120
ET ride that one of these I swear that first one smells closer

804
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:35,640
And this one I don't get a strong Jason is hotboxed himself blowing that out breathe it in like a lover's kiss

805
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:41,720
Exhale brother, I'll exhale I didn't have I got away from it. Do they have weed candles

806
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:47,360
Like candles to get you high. Yeah, I don't know not as far as I bet they do

807
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:56,240
They might have dabs or wax or red sand or they should because what easier way could there be to light something and get high

808
00:49:56,520 --> 00:50:04,000
What would be it's got if only there was an easier way than lighting a candle which is infused with marijuana along with its wax

809
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:08,320
It's probably dangerous. I don't you want to be sucking that wax

810
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:14,480
Yeah, I don't know. I can't say if it's just there's plenty of things that say cannabis candle

811
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:20,400
But I don't know if it's just the smell versus the smell you just want that smell around more. Oh, yeah

812
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,280
Yeah

813
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:27,600
Is there another compare contract? Well, we can because we do we have to avatar or you have to have it's right

814
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:32,680
Maybe let's do that because you were you were talking this one up or what you're while yours yours is with a caveat

815
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:38,920
I'm flying over Fiji, which is the tropical scene from Soren

816
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:43,520
Ascent that also appears in a flight of pass

817
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:48,200
It's it's very similar and some of the websites note that they use the same or some of the same elements

818
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:53,400
Yes, the Fiji Soren smell in for avatar passage flight rise to the challenge

819
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:56,440
See fuck go relax in your link chair dot

820
00:50:56,640 --> 00:51:01,520
This is if you just the idea that you would just buy this and then like relax in my link chair

821
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:07,000
Excuse me. I have what does the candle still work? Even if I don't have a link chair Jason's got a link chair

822
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:13,240
I don't know what that implied exactly, but would you like to elaborate?

823
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:19,960
Link chair directly to the Oscar Meyer store

824
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:28,200
I just learned about stocking shelves for Oscar Meyer. I just learned about a new character

825
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:32,120
Because at the Phillies game the other night

826
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:38,880
There was a pig running around like a big pig character

827
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:43,840
Running around with the fanatic and he had a Hatfield

828
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:50,120
Thing on and I learned it was a BOGO night buy one get one free hot dogs

829
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,120
so

830
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:54,120
Hatfield I think is the supplier

831
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:56,120
Hatfield is a hot dog supplier?

832
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:58,120
You're teaching us a bunch here, Hatfield

833
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:00,120
I thought we were going to go

834
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:02,120
Buy one get one free. Oh, okay

835
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:04,120
Hatfield I think

836
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:06,120
Wait, where's the free?

837
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:12,120
Buy one. I think it's just buy one get one. I think the free is implied. I always just said a free

838
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:14,120
I don't like that acronym that's confusing me

839
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:16,120
I thought you were going we were going with Hatfield and McCoys

840
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:21,120
Which is certainly Jason's favorite characters of all time. I guess it's not as usual

841
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:28,320
It's not as big a company as I thought but it's a Northeast like Hatfield hot dog company. Is there a McCoy company hot dog?

842
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:36,120
That you could get to. Oh at war? Yeah, no. There was not a McCoy pig taking pot shots at the Hatfield pig

843
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:46,640
Nicky's the real McCoy hot dogs. It's a restaurant. That's I think the closest we can get to a McCoy's

844
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:48,640
That's what you know

845
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:53,640
Candles that smell like rides or smell like avatar is one thing but if Jason could find the candle

846
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:56,640
Northeast hot dog company

847
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,640
Oh yeah

848
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:00,640
We're burning through that. We're burning through one of those a day

849
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:02,640
Yeah, a full candle a day

850
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:04,640
The I-95 candle company

851
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:07,640
Can you bottle the smell of people yelling?

852
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:15,640
Oh, no, I just I just well, you know what your your joke made me laugh and the laugh made me blow out of my nostril

853
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:17,640
And I blew out the candle

854
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:23,640
Okay, gotta light this one again. You want to you want to cook up a Fiji here? I just got a burst of

855
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:25,640
You want to hand Fiji over?

856
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:31,400
Yeah, maybe hand it because I'm running out of lighter. I'm like like Martha Stewart. I know you fucked up

857
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:36,840
I'm already like this has been used like seven times. I know my dad's down to the can. I don't know that

858
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:41,140
God am I gonna have to go in the house and get the long one?

859
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:48,440
I don't know that you're gonna get though. I got it. Are you kidding me? I know what a light a candle

860
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:51,160
Okay, it is going. Okay

861
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:56,980
Fiji is going it is. Yeah, you are you how when did you get this Fiji candle? How long have you had it?

862
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:04,720
Maybe like less than a year. Okay, they had they had a buy to get one free deal going on right now

863
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:08,600
So we were looking at new ones to try a BOGO BOGO

864
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:14,120
BOGO the acronym that uses almost all the letters of the phrase

865
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:17,560
80% it would be BOGOF

866
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:23,040
We're running a BOGOF we got a BOGOF here

867
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:26,320
Well, it doesn't work on this one because you gotta buy two get one

868
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:29,280
mmm

869
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:31,280
BATOGOF

870
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:37,120
And this one went out already well, we're all blowing them, huh

871
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:42,760
You think Jason did that a very difficult thing to do on a podcast. I think that one's just burned down

872
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:47,320
This is well, it's down like it's it's just metal. Well, just melt the metal then

873
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:53,560
Hold on. Hold on. I mean I can get this is certainly a much different smell than the

874
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:59,960
ETs you can smell that it's much more like this one smells closer to the tropical, right?

875
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:05,440
Yeah, yeah, but I still you're right. I smell them more before they're lit than when lit

876
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:10,080
Maybe you got it. Maybe it's got to like fill the room for 15 minutes that it yes, that would definitely

877
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:15,440
We're just gonna turn this into a five-hour episodes that we have time to let all the smells walk through the room

878
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:19,240
We often the ones we really like we'll just leave the lids off

879
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:25,880
Like to let it linger you kind of let it linger in a room. You've got to let it linger got to got to

880
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:34,440
So yeah the flight so these these should be the same sense because Fiji is the prominent scent on flight of passage

881
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:38,920
Which Scott and I just went on a couple weeks ago. So we have it somewhat fresh

882
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:41,400
It was so I was telling you after I was like

883
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:45,680
I think if I if I got a video of me on that ride now that I am blue-pilled

884
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:51,720
Oh, I could see what I was doing with my face like from time one doing it to time two

885
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:55,160
Which is post me understanding the movies seeing the movies

886
00:55:55,160 --> 00:56:00,280
I mean seeing the movies way of water post way of water. I think it'd be a very embarrassing video

887
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:06,720
I think it would like I look like I'm like being baptized. It was it meant so much more to me this time

888
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:11,880
Well, I want some fire and ash candles they they're gonna get on the ball by that I just

889
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:17,480
I wish those screens would be fixed. No, it's not lurry shit on that, right?

890
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:20,640
We're saying we we just believe that James doesn't know

891
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:27,240
Yeah, just busy. I think if anybody told him I think we could tell him and he would get furious if we fly a

892
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:33,000
Helicopter Steve would just land straight in the middle of Pandora. You write it himself in half an hour

893
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
I'd land on one of the rocks. Oh, yeah

894
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:37,240
And then repel down

895
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:42,720
Yeah, he's got his kit with he doesn't travel without his repelling kid, right?

896
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:48,600
Yeah, so I am getting this now that this has been melted for a little bit melting for a bit

897
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:50,600
I am getting a little bit more of a smell

898
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:58,480
It it's cool I think it's I've been saying that about every candle it's closer

899
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:03,760
And this is what this is what we've ended up with this episode

900
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:07,880
It was saying that candles smell like burning. It smells like burning. This is as

901
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:13,960
Observant as we can be are there really good smell podcasts. They're really good candle podcast. Are there good candle podcast?

902
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:15,760
That's a good question. Mm-hmm. I don't know

903
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:20,560
I don't really like candles, but the guys have such a rapport the candle boys that I just yeah

904
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:25,160
The waxman that I just like it doesn't matter that I don't like candles

905
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:29,040
They make me like them there is one I

906
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:32,560
Kept seeing one on like

907
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:39,020
Reddit or message boards. I think one of the bed bath it no bath and body works candles

908
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:41,600
smells like that

909
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:43,520
Fiji

910
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:48,320
Pandora the very close. I thought you were gonna talk about that bath and body works official podcast

911
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:54,220
Which could exist which you should be the whole videos were very I don't know if they're still big

912
00:57:54,420 --> 00:57:56,420
But I do remember

913
00:57:56,940 --> 00:58:03,300
Finding like years ago a woman who's like I'm back from the Yankee Candle Store. Check out my hall

914
00:58:03,940 --> 00:58:05,940
I'm back from

915
00:58:06,140 --> 00:58:08,140
Bath and body works. Here's my hall

916
00:58:08,980 --> 00:58:11,960
Soaps and candles my Yankee candle dandy

917
00:58:15,460 --> 00:58:22,180
Do you want to do you want to start drifting to are the ones that are not comparisons because Mike I notice you have a few

918
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:27,100
I mean one of mine might line up with your biggest one, but I'm curious about your smallers here

919
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:33,060
Oh, you want to go with my small? I think your smallers. Yes. Yeah, this candle has a lot of dust on it

920
00:58:33,060 --> 00:58:35,740
These are ancient. These are the oldest this one

921
00:58:36,460 --> 00:58:39,520
Your these ones are fresh. Okay, what do we what do we got here?

922
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:42,420
So these were sent these were sent to me

923
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:46,140
I think right before we moved and I forgot completely about them

924
00:58:46,420 --> 00:58:51,740
And I apologize because some nice person sent them to me and this is one of the people are so nice

925
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:56,580
I also a blanket apology to anyone who's ever sent us anything or said like a nice thing and we haven't responded

926
00:58:56,580 --> 00:59:00,460
I feel bad in general cuz I'm like, ah, I'm thank you everyone. I'm so sorry

927
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:06,360
We can pretend that it's because we get sent 5,000 things right that could be a good cop-out. It's not true. Yeah

928
00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:13,660
So I am trying to figure out what company even made these but we have a

929
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:21,100
Shark bait and banana breath candle here. Yes, which of course is the jaws and then banana

930
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:27,300
Breath is King Kong now. I can't really conjure any smells of I don't know. I never went on it. I

931
00:59:28,740 --> 00:59:34,240
Think that along there's some water ride candles floating around the table

932
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:39,580
the match candle company for their splash candle which

933
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:42,660
mentions the scent of bromine

934
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:44,900
bromine

935
00:59:45,140 --> 00:59:47,900
I've also seen dispute. We've talked about that being the

936
00:59:48,980 --> 00:59:52,420
Magic smell on pirates, but I've also seen people be like nobody really knows

937
00:59:52,420 --> 00:59:55,620
I don't know if that's actually ever been confirmed that that's what that is

938
00:59:56,180 --> 01:00:01,620
Yeah, yeah. Well, I might have a little info about it. We'll see when we get to the yeah. Yeah. Here's

939
01:00:02,420 --> 01:00:09,140
The copy contains highly themed notes of damp air and musty bromine water

940
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:15,060
Hmm doesn't sound good doesn't sound musty is yeah. No, no like that water

941
01:00:15,060 --> 01:00:17,640
Well, we have some we have some stuff related to that, but let's

942
01:00:18,540 --> 01:00:23,260
You want to talk about jaws or or or banana? Well, here's banana. Yeah banana breath candle

943
01:00:23,260 --> 01:00:25,620
Let me go around and smell it before what's been lit

944
01:00:26,620 --> 01:00:29,860
It is banana is hell. It is fake banana

945
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:32,060
It is extremely

946
01:00:32,060 --> 01:00:38,020
Then that runs down but that's what the you know in the ride or in the in the tour having done it many many times

947
01:00:38,180 --> 01:00:40,260
The right that was definitely the fakiest

948
01:00:40,780 --> 01:00:46,780
Candiest banana smell right the same. Yeah, very handy and I am this might be park sense

949
01:00:46,780 --> 01:00:51,580
I don't know because that's when you look up banana breath that park sense. There's multiple size candles

950
01:00:51,580 --> 01:00:53,500
Yeah, that is called. They're called banana breath

951
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:59,660
But you also notice that different candle companies use basically the same name fake name for the scent as well

952
01:00:59,660 --> 01:01:02,900
So I'm not let me know if you sent me this candle. So I'm trying to say

953
01:01:03,780 --> 01:01:08,300
Take credit go public you can imagine what this is gonna smell like when it's been lit

954
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:11,780
It's not been like banana plus burning. It does smell like

955
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:19,300
My beloved banana runs candy. Mm-hmm. I will say that so on that level. I do like it

956
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:23,500
I don't know if banana is the smell I want to smell in my house though. No, not really

957
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:29,900
I don't really wanna I'm not a minion. Yeah, so you know, there's there's that

958
01:01:29,980 --> 01:01:34,220
Well, let's let that cook do you also want to light up you just want to just make this a universal pair

959
01:01:34,220 --> 01:01:38,060
Do you want to light up your jaws jaws and it's gonna be a variant on water?

960
01:01:40,380 --> 01:01:46,940
Yes, okay, let's see that's not a bad smell without it being lit that's that's closer to like Fiji I think

961
01:01:47,580 --> 01:01:49,340
Not particularly

962
01:01:49,340 --> 01:01:54,380
Appealing to me someone I'd want around. Yeah. I mean what smells do we like?

963
01:01:54,380 --> 01:01:58,820
What are our favorite sense is what I would ask in general?

964
01:01:58,860 --> 01:02:03,660
I don't know like like fresh baked dessert in a small spit, you know

965
01:02:03,660 --> 01:02:09,220
If we ever do it at at home a spoiler. Oh, it's not a spoiler cuz my son's not listening

966
01:02:09,220 --> 01:02:11,700
but I think he's getting a cinnamon rolls for his

967
01:02:12,700 --> 01:02:14,700
fifth birthday

968
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:19,700
Flying over here if you got a test batch, you don't want to throw away

969
01:02:20,060 --> 01:02:25,940
I blew out the banana cuz I swear then you can once the smoke is gone. Then you can really get the sense

970
01:02:26,060 --> 01:02:28,940
Okay, well, maybe that's that might be the way we should have done this

971
01:02:30,820 --> 01:02:35,060
Where I don't where did jaws go do you have jaws is the brand? Oh, yeah, I forgot

972
01:02:36,220 --> 01:02:40,420
Again, this is not a scent that I want filling my house this but this banana one

973
01:02:40,420 --> 01:02:47,380
But I I find it appealing and interesting and it's maybe the most reflective of what you experienced in that, right? It's accurate

974
01:02:49,060 --> 01:02:52,100
Pre-lighting jaws, I kind of liked

975
01:02:52,820 --> 01:02:57,260
It smelled a little is sandalwood the smell that's like a default

976
01:02:57,900 --> 01:03:03,540
For a lot of stuff. I'm not sure I fully know what is and is not sandalwood

977
01:03:03,540 --> 01:03:09,100
I feel like I see sandalwood on every deodorant I purchase. Yeah, I feel like it's kind of a default

978
01:03:09,820 --> 01:03:15,140
Masculine quote-unquote smell. Oh, yes masculine smell. What do you think now? What do you think deodorant wise?

979
01:03:15,980 --> 01:03:21,120
Okay, when it comes to masculine when masculine smell I sandalwood is very much the aesthetic

980
01:03:21,540 --> 01:03:24,020
You know you see with men's stuff. I

981
01:03:25,060 --> 01:03:27,060
I like a little

982
01:03:27,300 --> 01:03:33,100
Smell in my deodorant. I've been a degree man for wait since way back. We got aluminum in that

983
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:38,700
It's a degree man. We got aluminum in that. Yeah, so it works. Oh, so you are you're doing aluminum. Yeah

984
01:03:39,540 --> 01:03:43,780
Okay, I'm not I'm anti aluminum as far as the deodorant is concerned

985
01:03:44,260 --> 01:03:47,180
They say it might not be good for you, but it

986
01:03:48,020 --> 01:03:55,700
The non-aluminum ones don't work that well. How long do you guys intend to talk about aluminum in deodorant?

987
01:03:55,700 --> 01:03:59,860
We've only been doing it for about 30 seconds. Yeah, but that's maybe a bit too much for me

988
01:03:59,860 --> 01:04:03,340
How long do you think the rant how long do you anticipate the real estate?

989
01:04:03,340 --> 01:04:08,420
Um, I think I got about a minute or two left to talking about it. Okay, that's fine

990
01:04:08,420 --> 01:04:13,060
I could check an email is I do have I mean I want to I want to get Jason sense of this is what I was

991
01:04:13,060 --> 01:04:18,340
Wearing I'm wearing today. I've been wearing it's it's a very masculine every man Jack

992
01:04:19,140 --> 01:04:21,140
And it's it's gel

993
01:04:21,140 --> 01:04:28,060
Needs to decide is it masculine or is it faux masculine? That's what I'm asking that getting it does look like a box of wood

994
01:04:28,220 --> 01:04:30,900
paneling right exactly, so I

995
01:04:31,420 --> 01:04:37,020
Just wanted you don't say it is sandalwood and it is a deodorant in the end. I perspire it

996
01:04:37,460 --> 01:04:41,900
What is the two? What are the two forget what the difference is, but I bought one once

997
01:04:41,900 --> 01:04:48,220
I think that was just anti-perspirant didn't work. Mm-hmm. This is you guys did like the scott-free episodes

998
01:04:48,220 --> 01:04:55,220
This is becoming a scott-free moment Scott. Yes, Scott's Scott's brain is just what brand will you haven't even said what brand you're doing

999
01:04:55,220 --> 01:05:00,980
What do you know? I don't even know or really I literally don't know it's in there. I put it on

1000
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:05,700
I don't know what it is or why I buy that's why I have zero interest in this topic

1001
01:05:05,700 --> 01:05:11,220
No, I don't know what I wear or why I buy it Wow really no because this is one of the biggest scent decisions

1002
01:05:11,220 --> 01:05:15,300
We make as human beings. I guess you're right. So I'm a decision

1003
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:17,780
I make is fine move on with my day

1004
01:05:17,780 --> 01:05:21,260
Well, we don't know what it is because you don't know so we don't know if it's fine

1005
01:05:21,260 --> 01:05:24,860
Maybe it's bad who could possibly care what deodorant I wear wife

1006
01:05:26,460 --> 01:05:31,340
It's fine. He has no if she's the only person who would or should care and what I pick is inoffensive

1007
01:05:31,860 --> 01:05:37,220
Listen in three listeners. I bet are vaguely interested in what it is. I like why smell like sometimes

1008
01:05:37,220 --> 01:05:44,060
I'll switch it up and get the old-spice Fiji that one has a nice scent. Okay. Yes. I have done the old-spice Fiji as well

1009
01:05:44,060 --> 01:05:45,580
Yeah, that has a nice. That's pretty mild

1010
01:05:45,580 --> 01:05:49,780
I agree with you that the non-aluminums are tricky cuz some sometimes they just don't work

1011
01:05:49,900 --> 01:05:53,580
But I do feel like this one has been working the sandalwood has been working for me

1012
01:05:53,580 --> 01:05:58,740
Is this not a conversation you would walk away from at a party would this not provoke you saying?

1013
01:05:58,740 --> 01:06:00,740
You know what? I'm gonna grab another drink you guys want anything?

1014
01:06:01,540 --> 01:06:05,940
I'm just a little sensitive little scent boy when I when I was a kid

1015
01:06:05,940 --> 01:06:08,100
I know how to I know how to keep Scott on the hook

1016
01:06:08,100 --> 01:06:10,740
I'll say little boy about sensitive little scent

1017
01:06:10,740 --> 01:06:16,700
That's the way to keep him from jumping into the house to see his baby for a while a childhood memory. I like

1018
01:06:17,300 --> 01:06:23,820
Elementary school, you know as kids are stinky old school buildings were stinky and oh

1019
01:06:24,340 --> 01:06:26,340
my sense it

1020
01:06:26,620 --> 01:06:33,740
Sense of smell I would get headaches all the time now looking back. That's probably because no one was drinking water

1021
01:06:34,620 --> 01:06:41,940
Very rarely get headaches in school. We get headaches in school and the sense would like my eyes from the smelly kids

1022
01:06:43,940 --> 01:06:47,540
Smelly what was going on in Philly? I know I know kids are smelly

1023
01:06:51,140 --> 01:06:56,820
Smelly kids in school. Well, no looking back. I think it was mildly irate irate it

1024
01:06:57,580 --> 01:07:00,980
Irritated by smelly kids and then I was just dehydrated

1025
01:07:01,780 --> 01:07:07,540
Cuz you'd like take a couple steps at a drinking fountain. Yeah, like that's still

1026
01:07:08,180 --> 01:07:13,860
Weird. I haven't been getting a constant headache elementary school unless these kids keep in mind

1027
01:07:13,860 --> 01:07:18,380
This is Philly everybody's eating these big old meat sandwiches all that breakfast lunch and dinner

1028
01:07:18,580 --> 01:07:22,260
Everybody's it's it's sausage rolls pork and everyone is and bread

1029
01:07:22,260 --> 01:07:27,260
So everybody so all these kids smell like like they all have meat sweats. It's all day every day

1030
01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:32,860
You're not that far I think maybe I'm on to something it's 1915 and it's a bunch of pig pens

1031
01:07:34,860 --> 01:07:38,380
You have to keep in mind they all did have visible smoke or I have it all times

1032
01:07:38,380 --> 01:07:43,620
I have one strong memory of a smelly kid and it was cuz he had he ate baloney every day

1033
01:07:43,620 --> 01:07:46,420
I need a baloney sandwich in his desk next to me

1034
01:07:46,420 --> 01:07:53,780
So he smelled like baloney, but that's the only time so extract that and it's like every kid had a big baloney sandwich

1035
01:07:53,780 --> 01:07:58,780
In their desk. Yes, and Jason was going to school. Uh-huh. And it gave the baloney gave him a headache. I

1036
01:07:59,940 --> 01:08:06,380
I don't associate baloney with smelling that bad. I guess it was room temperature. It was eating up

1037
01:08:06,660 --> 01:08:10,700
Was it like a baloney or something? He's every bit of that makes me

1038
01:08:12,180 --> 01:08:17,860
Baloney's room temperature when I said baloney sandwich. She was like, oh that would have made the headache go away

1039
01:08:18,460 --> 01:08:23,700
But hey put that in the frying pan. You got you're on your I've never had fried baloney in my life

1040
01:08:23,700 --> 01:08:25,700
Oh, it just tastes like a flat hot dog

1041
01:08:28,300 --> 01:08:31,780
Did you ever get headaches from the smelly kids in your elementary school? No

1042
01:08:32,660 --> 01:08:38,880
You're forgetting. I I all smelling like the beach and so killed. I guess that's true. Yeah, sunny day

1043
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:44,380
I smelled I wasn't drinking enough water. I was a nervous child. I was probably worrying myself

1044
01:08:44,740 --> 01:08:48,980
Well, that makes more sense the combination of everything I see I see

1045
01:08:49,060 --> 01:08:54,980
But you did present it as there were so many smelly kids and the building was smelly that you were getting headaches initially

1046
01:08:54,980 --> 01:08:56,980
That's why I'm stuck on it

1047
01:08:57,380 --> 01:09:04,160
That was the thing that I honed in on like I hate that I eat this so much. Let's light up a smelly kid candle

1048
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:09,820
Um, I think I have traces of room temp baloney. This is okay. I'm gonna

1049
01:09:10,340 --> 01:09:13,180
Baloney candle there's got to be a baloney candle. We can get you know it

1050
01:09:13,980 --> 01:09:15,820
11 year old wearing a mr.

1051
01:09:16,100 --> 01:09:20,660
Jason at the life is the jaws I lit it and now I've blown it out and now you got a little of the liquid there

1052
01:09:21,340 --> 01:09:27,020
And it is really hard to trait. It's just nothing. I would never smell this and say jaws ride. Yes

1053
01:09:27,020 --> 01:09:32,460
I don't know what the jaws ride smells like. So is it supposed to like it's like a purplish wax

1054
01:09:32,820 --> 01:09:34,820
Is it supposed to be like blood in the water?

1055
01:09:34,900 --> 01:09:40,300
Is it supposed to like kind of blue water and blood is it supposed to be like feed you but it tastes like a hint

1056
01:09:40,300 --> 01:09:42,300
of blood as well

1057
01:09:42,340 --> 01:09:46,820
Like what does blood smell like Jaws water was purple. Yeah, I don't know

1058
01:09:46,820 --> 01:09:51,220
I don't know what blood is supposed to like there's metallic depending on I don't know

1059
01:09:51,220 --> 01:09:57,100
Yeah, I haven't smelled my own blood in a while. There's kind of like a pleasant flat earthier smell a

1060
01:09:57,740 --> 01:09:59,100
flat earther

1061
01:09:59,100 --> 01:10:01,340
No, not flatter like

1062
01:10:02,340 --> 01:10:05,540
Saying top notes bottom notes. I'm like, oh, there's kind of a

1063
01:10:06,380 --> 01:10:11,020
smell soil soil dirt. It's not a bad smell. I just yeah, it doesn't

1064
01:10:11,660 --> 01:10:13,860
Like there's no smell on the

1065
01:10:14,700 --> 01:10:20,460
Studio tour section of Jaws as far as I know not that I recall thing because it's outside also would be hard

1066
01:10:20,460 --> 01:10:24,020
Yeah, no, so that yeah, that's an odd one to to try to extract

1067
01:10:24,020 --> 01:10:27,820
I mean, maybe we should talk about these we've gone through a lot of what we brought to the table

1068
01:10:27,820 --> 01:10:34,540
But like just going through magic candle that has the most robust, you know, they have flying over orange groves. That's a big one

1069
01:10:34,540 --> 01:10:40,020
We know that's a problem. They have like desserts. They pineapple whip as they call it the non-branded version

1070
01:10:40,020 --> 01:10:42,580
They have a lot of smells that are like the the resorts

1071
01:10:42,580 --> 01:10:46,620
I guess that's something people chased into what you were saying about yeah, I guess like although they say

1072
01:10:47,220 --> 01:10:49,220
actually contemporary and

1073
01:10:49,380 --> 01:10:53,300
You know yacht and beach are all the same so they come up with different candles

1074
01:10:53,300 --> 01:10:59,420
But I think it's yeah different branding for that is people online have said like oh a lot

1075
01:10:59,420 --> 01:11:06,100
I contacted that Vegas scent brand where I was like, hey, what smell is park MGM and they're like, oh

1076
01:11:07,020 --> 01:11:08,500
usually the

1077
01:11:08,500 --> 01:11:15,660
MGM resorts most of them are all this smell. Oh, I see. So it's kind of united across the board rather than different

1078
01:11:15,660 --> 01:11:16,660
Okay, okay

1079
01:11:16,660 --> 01:11:22,620
You know Rome burning is a big one from spaceship Earth, right? I don't know if that's something I want in my house

1080
01:11:22,620 --> 01:11:26,220
I guess I'm kind of comforted by that smell but do I want it at home not

1081
01:11:27,460 --> 01:11:31,100
Simulation of smoke. Yeah, I don't really want to smell that. I think I'd freak out

1082
01:11:31,620 --> 01:11:35,500
yeah, I mean I guess what it's not gonna smell like it's gonna smell like what a

1083
01:11:36,100 --> 01:11:41,700
Darker tone earthy. Yeah, what I guess something. Yeah, I know you don't want it to smell like char. I

1084
01:11:42,340 --> 01:11:46,960
Would assume yeah. Yeah, just like pure smoke. I don't know and then there's one, you know

1085
01:11:47,660 --> 01:11:53,940
When Jane was dropping you off she brought up that she's interested in getting one called Walters office

1086
01:11:54,180 --> 01:11:58,820
This is yeah, maybe worth addressing for a minute step into a world of creative power

1087
01:12:00,340 --> 01:12:02,500
Hello step in the world of creative power

1088
01:12:02,740 --> 01:12:03,980
a

1089
01:12:03,980 --> 01:12:09,420
Passion and childlike wonder as you become filled with inspiration by our Walters office fragrance

1090
01:12:09,420 --> 01:12:16,340
Let the warm and spicy aroma of freshly cured pipe tobacco transport you to the most magical office there ever was

1091
01:12:17,060 --> 01:12:20,980
So it smells like pipe. There must have been more magical offices than

1092
01:12:22,060 --> 01:12:29,020
Waltz it should smell like bourbon and whatever oil hazel-george used on his polo injury. I that should be the two smells

1093
01:12:29,700 --> 01:12:34,460
That's what I tried to make that joke earlier and I couldn't pull the name hazel-george

1094
01:12:35,260 --> 01:12:37,980
Okay, I don't know if that would have helped it crush with Jane

1095
01:12:37,980 --> 01:12:43,840
No, no linked at you when you made the joke about Walt liking massage. It's like okay. I'm gonna go

1096
01:12:45,380 --> 01:12:50,660
But yeah pipe tobacco with subtle hints of honey rose and violet this one

1097
01:12:50,660 --> 01:12:55,460
I kind of honed in on because I thought the name Walters office was very funny

1098
01:12:55,460 --> 01:13:03,260
But then we've read the actual description. We're like we kind of like all those tents. Yeah, honey rose violet that all that else

1099
01:13:03,260 --> 01:13:07,220
Yeah, fine. Yeah. Yeah, I don't know and kind of this like a smoky old man

1100
01:13:07,220 --> 01:13:12,980
It's not really a park smell and it's not a smell anybody ever knew besides he and his masseuse

1101
01:13:12,980 --> 01:13:16,820
But maybe a Sherman brother or two if they came to him

1102
01:13:17,580 --> 01:13:20,980
But other than that, I don't know. I could see liking a smell of this nature

1103
01:13:21,180 --> 01:13:25,740
Do you think one of the Sherman brothers came in Walt's office now like ah, you know what?

1104
01:13:25,740 --> 01:13:29,100
My shoulders really bothering me today and he goes, you know what? Let me call hazel

1105
01:13:29,100 --> 01:13:33,500
I think that's an upcharge. You think so? Yeah. Yeah, I don't think you I think he's handing that out for free

1106
01:13:33,500 --> 01:13:39,060
I think you would let hazel work on one of the dick Sherman's shoulder. I think he would give hazel's card

1107
01:13:39,940 --> 01:13:45,900
Hmm for more business, but I don't think it would be a freebie and cut into his time

1108
01:13:45,900 --> 01:13:49,220
Yeah, yeah, although I don't know if it got the songs cranking out right

1109
01:13:50,180 --> 01:13:56,680
Those ivories I'm not saying he's giving out to anyone working. I'm just saying like the Shermans are like high-value. Yeah

1110
01:13:57,300 --> 01:13:58,980
creators at Disney

1111
01:13:58,980 --> 01:14:05,140
Yeah, no, he should like loose who need those hands. Those are valuable. I have Bob Gurry. He should have loaned it out

1112
01:14:05,140 --> 01:14:09,380
Yeah, these keys gotta be knocking those rides together with hammers. That's right

1113
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:15,260
The should have been chilly is part of us also. Oh god. Yes, chilly would have been great

1114
01:14:15,580 --> 01:14:22,620
And and maybe so you've got the tobacco thing here and that that does feel like something that maybe you know would have been in

1115
01:14:22,620 --> 01:14:28,540
Walt's office and there's a smell that people chase and I I had a thought I was like since we're

1116
01:14:29,340 --> 01:14:36,500
Sparking up lighting a bunch of stuff here. Hmm something we could do if all parties here agree

1117
01:14:37,260 --> 01:14:40,340
Option that is on the table. I have brought something

1118
01:14:40,340 --> 01:14:47,680
It's not quite in the candle zone, but it's something that would have some aromas as part of it. We could gentlemen

1119
01:14:48,380 --> 01:14:50,060
light up a couple of

1120
01:14:50,060 --> 01:14:55,780
Big old stogies big old stogies. I have three big old stogies with me

1121
01:14:56,180 --> 01:15:02,680
This could be our chance to determine once and for all or to order just I'm just curious to see how you feel in

1122
01:15:02,680 --> 01:15:06,500
General about like a live big old stogie demonstration. I okay

1123
01:15:07,100 --> 01:15:11,540
I'm willing to try it. Uh-huh. I well, I did already say

1124
01:15:12,060 --> 01:15:16,060
All it's smelling all these candles has me a little light habit

1125
01:15:16,060 --> 01:15:20,860
Well, it might be a bad eyes and noses are irritated. Well, that's not maybe not a good start

1126
01:15:20,900 --> 01:15:24,820
But I don't have you could also give it a shot Wow Will Smith

1127
01:15:25,420 --> 01:15:30,580
First of all, I don't want you to pass out. Yes, I can of all will Smith in I believe the song Miami

1128
01:15:31,220 --> 01:15:35,420
Says he has the cigar, but he doesn't light it. It's just for the look

1129
01:15:35,460 --> 01:15:41,500
That is you're recording getting jiggy with it. Damn it. Yeah. Yeah, it's getting jiggy with it. I apologize light it

1130
01:15:42,620 --> 01:15:47,140
Yeah, I would have fucking like like, you know, remember how I'd easy on the swears

1131
01:15:47,140 --> 01:15:51,260
we don't swear until the most famous swear ever uttered is a

1132
01:15:52,220 --> 01:15:58,780
Life television cultivating a wholesome image at the time, but I think Jason should continue cultivating it. He could just for the look. That's true

1133
01:15:58,780 --> 01:16:02,380
He doesn't have to do it. I don't want him to yes

1134
01:16:02,940 --> 01:16:07,020
Yes, no, no, no that might be that might be that doesn't happen, but we can certainly pass it his way

1135
01:16:07,020 --> 01:16:11,580
Well, do you want to like maybe this is one you could just know without all right. All right. Yeah, great

1136
01:16:11,620 --> 01:16:14,460
Well, this is great. I didn't know if I'd get immediate objection

1137
01:16:14,460 --> 01:16:19,540
I don't know if you'd be upset just that a stogie was produced in front of you because listener if you don't know what I'm

1138
01:16:19,540 --> 01:16:24,860
Referring to what I've noticed is that Jason has done a lot of references over the years to a big old

1139
01:16:25,340 --> 01:16:30,740
Stogie and you say it with the most hate in your heart. I've ever hurt you you despise stogie

1140
01:16:30,780 --> 01:16:37,700
So I'm just curious what would happen. It's very funny to call it that first off and second off. It just comes from like

1141
01:16:38,340 --> 01:16:42,780
Years on the beach at the Jersey Shore and yes lighting up the cheapest

1142
01:16:42,900 --> 01:16:49,020
Yes, like shittiest and it just well Jason you'll be happy to know that these all cost ten dollars each

1143
01:16:49,020 --> 01:16:51,940
I'm sure a great price for a quality

1144
01:16:52,460 --> 01:16:56,020
I don't know. I think you're getting gangbusters quality for ten dollars

1145
01:16:56,660 --> 01:17:02,780
Down at the liquor store down the street and if and am I I'm correct gentlemen that it's I get them confused

1146
01:17:02,780 --> 01:17:06,020
But the the best cigars are from Venezuela. Is that correct?

1147
01:17:06,340 --> 01:17:12,780
That's as far as I know cuz that's where these are from. I don't know. Um, you pulled them out of a plastic bag

1148
01:17:16,900 --> 01:17:20,540
Well, they were wrapped I had to pull them out to you know, chop the

1149
01:17:21,220 --> 01:17:25,780
Right, you got a chopper. I don't I used the technique of scissors

1150
01:17:26,580 --> 01:17:30,300
Mike are you going for it? Are we gonna say we're gonna do a live stogie demonstration. Yes, we will

1151
01:17:30,300 --> 01:17:35,460
Yeah, it's this thing you I would I don't know the end that I cut I had to look that up

1152
01:17:35,460 --> 01:17:41,580
So you and you just from this you just yes puff on it. You don't inhale. That's right. Yeah

1153
01:17:41,580 --> 01:17:45,660
Yeah, I mean by the way, you know, no romantic hot boxing. These are

1154
01:17:46,860 --> 01:17:48,780
lacumanases

1155
01:17:48,780 --> 01:17:51,300
And I'm sure I'm sure a quality brand

1156
01:17:51,300 --> 01:17:55,020
I'm sure the best that you could get when you go to the when you go to the liquor store

1157
01:17:57,140 --> 01:17:59,840
Well, they're not I didn't want like the little cigarillos

1158
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:04,580
I'm like because I think stogie the spirit of the term stogie is I believe

1159
01:18:05,060 --> 01:18:11,060
Like kind of big cheap ones. I think that is what it is the vibe. Yeah. Yeah, what did the groucho smoke?

1160
01:18:11,060 --> 01:18:12,300
I'm not sure one

1161
01:18:12,300 --> 01:18:16,540
This is a thing this was some of my thing of like Jason's big objection to big old stogies

1162
01:18:16,540 --> 01:18:21,980
But I feel like a lot of Jason heroes like yeah. Yeah, you've got I forgot about groucho

1163
01:18:22,500 --> 01:18:29,100
WC feels I assume he's got an affinity for baby Herman a lot of I think Jason coded characters

1164
01:18:29,300 --> 01:18:32,620
Well, this is the this is the what is it? What's the word?

1165
01:18:32,620 --> 01:18:37,880
I'm looking for here that maybe the contradiction where Jason heroes and then as well the steak and bourbon conversation

1166
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:40,260
We've been having a lot of the old-time steak houses

1167
01:18:41,020 --> 01:18:43,940
Were frequented by heroes as well

1168
01:18:43,940 --> 01:18:49,400
So it's some somewhat more new school versions of some of these time

1169
01:18:50,140 --> 01:18:56,720
Traditions look. Yeah, I like it once in a blue moon. Hey, I really like it if I'm not paying for it, right fellas

1170
01:18:56,720 --> 01:19:02,260
I think all the objections to steak and bourbon will disappear if the tab is free

1171
01:19:02,260 --> 01:19:05,960
We should move you back. Is that just hitting that smell hit me so hard

1172
01:19:06,680 --> 01:19:13,100
We don't need the table move Jason back the moment I would I would take a puff off someone's I don't want to

1173
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:19,480
I want you to take that home though and just in the middle of

1174
01:19:20,240 --> 01:19:23,860
Conversation with Jane try to light like pretend you're gonna light it up

1175
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:28,480
Candles were a hit. Why don't we go out on the balcony?

1176
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:33,080
This is illegal now under California laws of

1177
01:19:33,280 --> 01:19:40,080
How do you know is that your own balcony on your own balcony you cannot smoke in an apartment apartment in a hotel

1178
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:42,820
I don't know if I disagree with that. Totally. I don't either

1179
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:50,960
Although we did stay at a hotel in Napa where it's like was a balcony overlooking woods and there was a built-in ashtray

1180
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:55,200
So it's like I guess it's fine here. Did I think I got it lit?

1181
01:19:56,600 --> 01:20:01,760
Like you got it. I haven't smoked a cigarette or anything in a very long time. Oh that stinks

1182
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:07,080
This is one of your favorite smells of the day, Michael. Jason's right

1183
01:20:09,640 --> 01:20:11,640
Jason's right

1184
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:15,880
I haven't lit mine yet. I feel like I'm at a golf tournament. All right, hold on. Mike has some outshone

1185
01:20:15,880 --> 01:20:18,160
You could drop the mic Mike. Oh

1186
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:23,280
Michael never dropped the mic except when he has a good slam lined up

1187
01:20:23,720 --> 01:20:28,240
Now it might have been also though all the flakes are cut it so badly all the flakes are

1188
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:29,520
I

1189
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:33,320
Dropped the right was it the flakes? I have a mouthful of flakes

1190
01:20:33,320 --> 01:20:36,960
Oh, you might have gotten the worst what you might have gotten the one I cut the worst

1191
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:40,440
Oh

1192
01:20:40,440 --> 01:20:41,760
God this is just a lot

1193
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:45,500
I've just set us up for a live situation where Jason is being proven right look at this

1194
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:50,320
Jason is vindicated here. Look at this is falling apart as I try to just hold it

1195
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:57,840
I think I'm loving it fellas. I'd love just put it in for the fun of it again like the getting jiggy with

1196
01:20:58,480 --> 01:21:01,920
Is so good at doing the like waggling a party

1197
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:07,160
About I'm doing that more than I'm sucking on it. No, no, no, no

1198
01:21:08,520 --> 01:21:15,300
See go see God. What does he say? What is this cute Cuban? What is it? Yeah, Venezuelan cigars $10

1199
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:22,520
Got him from village liquor. I'm messing up my I keep keep wanting to sing party in the city where the heat is on

1200
01:21:22,520 --> 01:21:26,120
That's Miami though. That's not getting jiggy with a better song. I mean, I like Miami more

1201
01:21:26,120 --> 01:21:28,120
I think Miami is the better song

1202
01:21:28,160 --> 01:21:32,360
Those are all good songs though. Let's be right. Well, hang on just the two of us

1203
01:21:33,080 --> 01:21:35,080
Okay, not just see

1204
01:21:36,440 --> 01:21:42,600
But the men in black getting jiggy with it Miami trilogy in my mind is is good

1205
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:48,640
It's nothing to be defensive about well, I will be defensive about it

1206
01:21:48,640 --> 01:21:51,920
I also you know my recommendation go to the samples Patrice Russian

1207
01:21:52,760 --> 01:21:54,760
The whispers and the beat goes on

1208
01:22:00,680 --> 01:22:05,960
There's like the shell came off this big cigar, this is not your fault. I gave you the worst one

1209
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
Shell the protective shell

1210
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:18,160
I'm a turtle guy. Yes. All right. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. I'm just trying not to blow this in Jason's face

1211
01:22:18,160 --> 01:22:20,560
I didn't do a good job proving my point by getting

1212
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:26,320
Ten dollars. Yeah. Yeah, but isn't but isn't that the stogie spirit? It is the soggy spirit

1213
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:30,920
I agree and I feel like Jason would like this spirit of getting the cheapest thing humanly possible

1214
01:22:30,920 --> 01:22:36,280
He's actually another and smelling the smoke. These don't smell too bad

1215
01:22:37,960 --> 01:22:39,960
You want it you want to near you a little bit

1216
01:22:42,760 --> 01:22:46,320
Dust again blame me here

1217
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:50,200
There's a good

1218
01:22:54,600 --> 01:22:56,600
What do we feel about this stogie

1219
01:22:56,600 --> 01:22:58,600
What do you think?

1220
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:22,600
Jason's coming around on big old stogies, but we have lost Mike

1221
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:33,280
The worst possible one you're wearing a prank cigar. I've been given you're wearing a brown windbreaker right now

1222
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:36,160
So you're kind of set for that. Um, I

1223
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,920
Noticed the pieces. Yeah to not notice all the pieces

1224
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:46,640
I can't gonna hug your daughter and she said she's gonna say daddy. There's pieces of there's pieces of cigar

1225
01:23:46,640 --> 01:23:48,760
Did you roll in the leaves daddy? I

1226
01:23:49,680 --> 01:23:53,800
think I like like 20 seconds of smelling that but like

1227
01:23:54,640 --> 01:23:55,800
Imagine

1228
01:23:55,800 --> 01:23:59,520
Working 45 minutes an hour. I would agree with that

1229
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:03,760
I would it does remind I'm like where have I smelled this the most and it is when I go to golf tournaments

1230
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:08,920
Oh, yeah. Yeah, that is where they really come out which have gotten so they when I was a kid

1231
01:24:08,920 --> 01:24:15,840
They were a little bit pleasant to go to they've gotten so ludicrously expensive and parking is so insane and cigar spells have gotten really out

1232
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:20,360
of hand and the golf the golf tournament hot dogs have gone from like

1233
01:24:21,040 --> 01:24:22,160
$3 to

1234
01:24:22,160 --> 01:24:29,960
$25 right bonkers. It's so unpleasant. There was an f1 event. I was reading about I think in Miami and it was like

1235
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:34,100
$300 for fish tacos or something

1236
01:24:37,160 --> 01:24:43,120
We could wrap up the cigar portion of the festivities, but you know what Mike while you

1237
01:24:44,040 --> 01:24:47,560
Process this and get everything out of your mouth and try to clean yourself off

1238
01:24:47,560 --> 01:24:49,780
I think a picture with it to go ahead keep going. Yeah. Yeah

1239
01:24:49,780 --> 01:24:53,140
Well, I was thinking I think that you should not have the hate

1240
01:24:53,140 --> 01:24:57,100
Well, maybe you know what you just kind of let out is that you kind of like saying the word stogies

1241
01:24:57,100 --> 01:25:03,500
And I don't think this is any coincidence because do you know Jason that the word stogie comes from?

1242
01:25:04,340 --> 01:25:06,340
Conestoga, Pennsylvania

1243
01:25:06,780 --> 01:25:12,820
Lancaster County term you didn't know that you did know that. Oh, no. Sorry. It's just been I'm familiar

1244
01:25:12,820 --> 01:25:13,780
I know

1245
01:25:14,780 --> 01:25:21,260
In there yeah Conestoga is where one of the first cigar factories in this nation was it's an Amish tradition

1246
01:25:21,260 --> 01:25:27,300
And in fact the wagon drivers in that time were called stogies as were the durable shoes that they wore

1247
01:25:27,700 --> 01:25:29,380
Why stogie?

1248
01:25:29,380 --> 01:25:34,320
I'm feeling cold and tired to grab me a pair of stogies you'd say

1249
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:39,300
I also feel like you should embrace the term because you love a big old hoagie

1250
01:25:40,220 --> 01:25:47,100
Well, so it would follow you might also like a big old stogie and he loves bogey Humphrey Bogart

1251
01:25:47,100 --> 01:25:52,140
He loves him. He loves big old bogey or Humphrey as sometimes he's called in a while. They call him that

1252
01:25:53,380 --> 01:25:58,180
Well, this is yeah, I this has been fascinating how this is played out that I think Jason is sitting here

1253
01:25:58,700 --> 01:26:03,340
Like it like calm collected Mike is a mess. You do. Yeah

1254
01:26:04,340 --> 01:26:10,500
Destroy the part it's I wish I'm trying to be cool man. I try and I we we might be

1255
01:26:11,180 --> 01:26:15,540
That I see a couple more candles on the table, but if anyone wants a clean scent

1256
01:26:16,340 --> 01:26:19,460
To kind of cleanse the palette this one

1257
01:26:19,460 --> 01:26:22,740
I got and I think it was when the

1258
01:26:23,380 --> 01:26:29,700
H2o soap seemed like they were going away. This one is called sea salt and h2o. So that's the Disney brand

1259
01:26:29,940 --> 01:26:36,380
That's a Disney brand of soaps which they just bought the formula and put their own name on now, right?

1260
01:26:36,740 --> 01:26:41,540
Well, and that's do you and you feel that's a very similar sense. Yeah, I think this is pretty close

1261
01:26:41,540 --> 01:26:44,180
They have a lot of varieties of soaps

1262
01:26:44,700 --> 01:26:51,860
But I think this is kind of close to the sea salt one. That's pretty pleasant. Yeah doesn't match the stogie though

1263
01:26:53,060 --> 01:26:56,540
I'm never smelling anything else again. Get me spider-man

1264
01:27:00,340 --> 01:27:05,820
I'm trying to think famous stogie smokers in fiction. Well, he's got to look up all those

1265
01:27:06,700 --> 01:27:11,060
Cigar aficionado covers, you know, oh, yeah, David Letterman and right. Oh

1266
01:27:11,780 --> 01:27:15,060
Belouche and below. Yeah Belouche Jim

1267
01:27:15,860 --> 01:27:19,740
Yes. Yeah, this is well, yeah, doesn't it being in this garage doesn't it?

1268
01:27:20,100 --> 01:27:23,900
Kind of transport you to if you were getting to hang with the Belouche himself. Oh, man

1269
01:27:23,900 --> 01:27:29,300
I feel like Danny I feel like Danny Ackroyd has a cigar once in a while with the when he cracks a head

1270
01:27:29,340 --> 01:27:31,340
Yeah

1271
01:27:31,940 --> 01:27:33,940
You know

1272
01:27:33,980 --> 01:27:35,980
Light a stogue. Yeah

1273
01:27:36,740 --> 01:27:38,740
Yeah, but

1274
01:27:39,660 --> 01:27:42,360
No, this was this was bad. This is very bad

1275
01:27:42,360 --> 01:27:44,620
I wonder how much we would sense the difference or in G

1276
01:27:44,620 --> 01:27:51,500
Do you feel like you might enjoy an expensive cigar and would it even be worth the attempt? I mean would it be worth it?

1277
01:27:52,020 --> 01:27:53,340
I mean

1278
01:27:53,340 --> 01:27:57,980
For the pictures, I guess for the fun of it. So you post those on Instagram

1279
01:27:58,540 --> 01:28:01,700
Guys a high-roller. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Wow. I get those clicks

1280
01:28:02,700 --> 01:28:05,660
Like I thought Mike only smoked the human aces

1281
01:28:06,780 --> 01:28:09,540
Turns out he'll throw down for cigars. It's true

1282
01:28:10,500 --> 01:28:16,340
But I mean maybe I mean look if there was that cigar bar or whatever it was called at City Walk in Orlando

1283
01:28:16,340 --> 01:28:21,300
I was a guys with Z. Yes, I would definitely still try one there. Yeah, but it's too bad

1284
01:28:21,300 --> 01:28:24,460
We definitely would have found ourselves all lighten up at cigars

1285
01:28:25,260 --> 01:28:27,620
Fun episode the Disney Springs

1286
01:28:28,180 --> 01:28:34,820
Cigar shop closed not that long ago. Mm-hmm, right and I think it survived all the different

1287
01:28:35,340 --> 01:28:42,040
Shopping village downtown at Disney the various iterations. I think it was there for a while

1288
01:28:42,340 --> 01:28:47,260
Listeners, there's still a place to get cigars in or near a theme park

1289
01:28:47,260 --> 01:28:51,300
Do you know a question is that that would really you know? Yeah

1290
01:28:51,300 --> 01:28:56,300
That would become under our purge by the Ben and Jerry's on I Drive is there a store called

1291
01:28:56,460 --> 01:29:03,420
Siggy's like a fun funky cigar store or can you get like cigarettes at a gift shop at Six Flags?

1292
01:29:03,700 --> 01:29:09,220
Yeah, I don't think so. Maybe six do any characters in Six Flags attractions

1293
01:29:10,980 --> 01:29:17,660
Yeah, probably yeah, wait don't they all bugs bunny was like a lot of cigars like to blow up his villains

1294
01:29:18,020 --> 01:29:19,300
bugs has a

1295
01:29:19,300 --> 01:29:22,140
He should have a like a cigar room wing on his house

1296
01:29:23,660 --> 01:29:25,660
And a humidor

1297
01:29:26,420 --> 01:29:33,620
Smoking area at Six Flags is they just give you an old mascot head and you just smoke in here

1298
01:29:33,620 --> 01:29:37,260
Yeah, that's a hot box. Yeah, it's a hot box. They miss his taz

1299
01:29:37,780 --> 01:29:41,940
Pull up a tweety head. This is good. I do like this. I do like this. I don't know that

1300
01:29:41,940 --> 01:29:47,460
I know h2o sense. So the smell so far that first flight of passage

1301
01:29:47,460 --> 01:29:52,020
I think is the Fiji which I like I don't mind see salt might be the most functional one. I might yeah

1302
01:29:52,020 --> 01:29:53,340
Yeah, I'm gonna go up

1303
01:29:53,340 --> 01:29:58,820
So I'm gonna go back to maybe let's let's handle these last few these were these ones might be related Mike

1304
01:29:58,820 --> 01:30:02,460
You have one that's kind of a common area. I think of oh, yeah

1305
01:30:02,980 --> 01:30:08,020
Theme park smell which is pirate water you're chasing chasing the Pirates of the Caribbean water

1306
01:30:08,740 --> 01:30:14,660
And then I have one that Mike called out in our assignment as he put it the delightfully vague bloom

1307
01:30:14,660 --> 01:30:20,220
I think these are meant to be kind of the same thing because I see some pirate imagery here in flume, right?

1308
01:30:20,220 --> 01:30:24,580
But that is about as copyright skirting as you could do. Flume is really mysterious

1309
01:30:24,580 --> 01:30:29,820
Is that like a splash mount like magic handle company at splash? This is flume

1310
01:30:29,820 --> 01:30:34,580
Well, let's say no because it says escape cannon fire or end up in Davy Jones locker

1311
01:30:34,580 --> 01:30:38,780
All right, take your boat to the lady in red, but watch out for rowdy pie

1312
01:30:38,780 --> 01:30:40,780
I'm gonna say it with

1313
01:30:40,780 --> 01:30:46,060
Watch out for rowdy pirates. You're only after one thing something a ratty rum

1314
01:30:47,340 --> 01:30:53,260
I'd love to do bits with my cigar, but it's literally will fall apart in my mouth. So I can't I would love to though

1315
01:30:53,260 --> 01:30:58,420
This is cracking apart. It is sort of akin to like just eating a bunch of like breakaway wood

1316
01:30:59,420 --> 01:31:02,740
It's like you just put a like a falling apart cork in your mouth

1317
01:31:03,220 --> 01:31:06,980
It's like you popped it out of a wine bottle and like it's decaying already you put it in there

1318
01:31:06,980 --> 01:31:12,980
Pieces of cork are very nice. Okie. Yeah, I'd love to I'd love to do bits with it, but I can't

1319
01:31:14,700 --> 01:31:16,700
Don't do anything

1320
01:31:16,740 --> 01:31:22,540
We've already put ourselves on the line for this one. Let's compare it. Let's pass around flume and pirate water. Let's compare

1321
01:31:22,540 --> 01:31:25,780
Yeah, your pirate water is as old as the pirates themselves

1322
01:31:26,580 --> 01:31:30,180
Dusty but it's been a bunch of how you open the lid and a bunch of powder came out

1323
01:31:30,180 --> 01:31:34,140
Yeah, it's very but it has been used recently. So I guess maybe it was just I don't know

1324
01:31:34,500 --> 01:31:39,340
You can still smell sort of the gist of it

1325
01:31:40,660 --> 01:31:44,700
I've always rubbed the way you're rubbing your fingers around like it's chew

1326
01:31:44,700 --> 01:31:49,740
I don't want to like set off like duh, like a dust fire if I light it

1327
01:31:49,740 --> 01:31:54,620
I don't know. This is disgusting. It looks gross. Yeah, I agree. So gross. I didn't really I just was closed

1328
01:31:54,620 --> 01:31:56,620
So I picked it up and last gross too

1329
01:31:56,700 --> 01:31:58,060
It's not

1330
01:31:58,060 --> 01:32:02,400
Flume is kind of a pleasant room scent. Yeah

1331
01:32:04,940 --> 01:32:06,260
Yeah

1332
01:32:06,260 --> 01:32:12,060
Stare this shit down Jason. I think that smells better than flume. Honestly flume smells a little plasticky to me

1333
01:32:12,060 --> 01:32:14,340
I do not like I do not like your pirate water

1334
01:32:14,340 --> 01:32:19,540
Well, wait a second till I burn all the dust off to it and then maybe the scent will really come might be part of it

1335
01:32:19,540 --> 01:32:23,660
I don't make it smell like the Haunted Mansion. This is a whole other area that we didn't get we didn't we didn't get anything like

1336
01:32:23,820 --> 01:32:29,940
Ghostly man or yeah or spooky residents or whatever the hell you call the off-brand pirates

1337
01:32:29,940 --> 01:32:34,400
So we don't have and what I don't know what smell I'm after in Haunted Mansion anyway, exactly

1338
01:32:34,500 --> 01:32:39,420
Yeah, besides the gingerbread house when it does a solid. There is like paint some old

1339
01:32:39,420 --> 01:32:43,860
I don't know like it's there's some smell to it that I cannot explain in Haunted Mansion

1340
01:32:43,860 --> 01:32:49,260
But you know what we were talking about we were on when we went on Tron. There's a smell to newer rides

1341
01:32:49,260 --> 01:32:50,180
Oh, yeah

1342
01:32:50,180 --> 01:32:54,580
And I smell it on Guardians and I smell it on Tron and I don't know if I smell it as much on cosmic rewind

1343
01:32:54,580 --> 01:32:59,460
But there is some sort of I don't know if it's plastic or new paint smell

1344
01:32:59,580 --> 01:33:07,180
Stores in epic universe you noticed on new park. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. There's some new park smell akin to new car smell

1345
01:33:07,180 --> 01:33:11,980
You're saying yes, it's it's not it's definitely some artificial plasticky paint smell

1346
01:33:11,980 --> 01:33:18,220
That's probably toxic, but I do now like it because of its association with newer theme park stuff

1347
01:33:18,220 --> 01:33:24,780
That is I would like a candle of new park smell. Yeah, you guys see the speaking of epic universe. Did you see?

1348
01:33:25,340 --> 01:33:27,340
the rumor that

1349
01:33:28,340 --> 01:33:36,340
Well, it's not a rumor because it happened but the rumor of how long it's gonna go that the Captain Kakao stuffed animals

1350
01:33:36,780 --> 01:33:44,900
Were removed from the stores during some of the previews. I did see this because they were worried they wouldn't have enough

1351
01:33:46,420 --> 01:33:48,420
They were just very popular

1352
01:33:48,820 --> 01:33:51,300
It's just very cute. Wow only

1353
01:33:52,140 --> 01:33:54,140
Remnant of the

1354
01:33:55,260 --> 01:33:59,660
Lore if that lore truly is dead, we'll see I wonder if any comes back or if they revamp or

1355
01:34:00,060 --> 01:34:03,260
To make it more accessible to a regular person. Yeah

1356
01:34:05,260 --> 01:34:10,780
There's a door with a cute tiny little door which is meant to be Captain Kakao's

1357
01:34:11,060 --> 01:34:16,660
But then there's a smaller third door built it and I'm like, who's that third door for?

1358
01:34:17,220 --> 01:34:24,580
Doors, where are the doors in one of the celestial park shops or restaurants a third door is like dog

1359
01:34:25,100 --> 01:34:32,100
Captain Kakao's dog. I guess or is Maya the Explorer little I don't think it looks like a mouse

1360
01:34:32,100 --> 01:34:35,100
I look like a mouse. Is there a mouse then?

1361
01:34:38,380 --> 01:34:39,980
When I see

1362
01:34:39,980 --> 01:34:45,100
The smell old bloom. I almost want like in an industrial smell

1363
01:34:45,100 --> 01:34:50,260
I want it to be like this is what it's like to like be a scuba diver who has to do repairs at Pirates of

1364
01:34:50,260 --> 01:34:57,380
The Caribbean. Oh, that's yelling it out and spelling Mike. I think what's right about that. Then you got to give it a second

1365
01:34:57,380 --> 01:34:58,380
Yeah

1366
01:34:58,380 --> 01:35:00,380
Pirates might be closer

1367
01:35:01,180 --> 01:35:02,500
to

1368
01:35:02,500 --> 01:35:08,420
The ride flu might be more pleasant in terms of like a pleasant plasticky smell

1369
01:35:08,740 --> 01:35:13,340
Hmm. Yeah, I I mean this I've smelled this a lot. I don't know that it's the ride

1370
01:35:13,860 --> 01:35:16,180
No, I don't know that it smells like the right at all

1371
01:35:16,180 --> 01:35:23,140
I really don't think any of these and maybe avatars the avatars get banana breath. Yes. Yes, but it does

1372
01:35:23,140 --> 01:35:28,060
It's not I ever want again. No, no, right. So it is

1373
01:35:29,940 --> 01:35:34,820
Impossible I think to completely recreate the conditions for which you smell

1374
01:35:35,380 --> 01:35:40,300
It's just too vague and it's like even the even if you took the literal smell it wouldn't be the same room

1375
01:35:40,300 --> 01:35:43,540
It wouldn't be as lived in it wouldn't be these mechanisms that have been here since

1376
01:35:44,540 --> 01:35:46,140
1967 or

1377
01:35:46,140 --> 01:35:54,060
Toxic shit in the walls or the water the mold or the who knows exactly what the Legionnaires disease

1378
01:35:56,300 --> 01:36:00,940
Events at Disneyland some of it comes from its its smells that are accrued from a time where

1379
01:36:01,700 --> 01:36:05,700
coding was different where like, you know, like it was

1380
01:36:06,260 --> 01:36:10,560
Looser legally the kinds of rooms you could bring the general public into

1381
01:36:12,060 --> 01:36:14,060
I do not like flume

1382
01:36:14,300 --> 01:36:18,620
This is funny because I think flumes on my I really for some reason I find it unpleasant

1383
01:36:18,620 --> 01:36:21,260
I think I like flu. Do we have it? Does everybody want to pick a winner?

1384
01:36:23,220 --> 01:36:25,620
Are we saying what we like or what we think is accurate?

1385
01:36:26,380 --> 01:36:29,260
Either one that first was it was this one?

1386
01:36:29,780 --> 01:36:34,540
I think it was this one that I like sense which I brought to the table passage flight. Yeah

1387
01:36:36,580 --> 01:36:38,460
That's up there

1388
01:36:38,460 --> 01:36:43,660
Yeah. Yeah, I am a fan of flume. I gotta say that's interesting like weird blunt one

1389
01:36:43,660 --> 01:36:49,180
That was it is presented like a dare by Mike. I don't mind flume. It is weird. It is weird cuz like

1390
01:36:49,660 --> 01:36:52,300
there are plenty of sense that are not like

1391
01:36:52,980 --> 01:36:58,980
Sometimes if I like walk by somewhere and somebody's smoking I do miss being in a bar filled with cigarette smoke

1392
01:36:59,300 --> 01:37:02,620
Even though that is an unpleasant smell and especially when you get home

1393
01:37:03,140 --> 01:37:06,140
Your clothes we've talked about this before like in our early 20s

1394
01:37:06,140 --> 01:37:10,140
This was still happening and we'd go to a college bar and it was a bar full of cigarette smoke

1395
01:37:10,140 --> 01:37:15,260
Mm-hmm, and I kind of missed that smell to some degree. I'm glad that that's not the case

1396
01:37:15,260 --> 01:37:21,260
Oh, I see. I'm wondering if that's an Illinois thing because I don't think Central New York

1397
01:37:21,340 --> 01:37:26,140
I don't think I ever had that in college. There was no bar full of cigarettes smoke

1398
01:37:26,260 --> 01:37:32,940
Did they get rid of it a couple years earlier maybe that's what I'm thinking maybe they passed it early because we go to like

1399
01:37:33,620 --> 01:37:36,940
You know, I'm trying to think like whatever downtown

1400
01:37:37,900 --> 01:37:42,900
Bar it was just like so crazy how bad the cigarette smoke was in there

1401
01:37:42,900 --> 01:37:46,580
Mm-hmm, but then that was gone within a year or two and then by the time I was out here

1402
01:37:46,980 --> 01:37:51,260
There's something about it. Yes is like, you know kind of like secondary

1403
01:37:51,820 --> 01:37:56,620
Infusion of environment that there is some like, you know, you know yourself

1404
01:37:56,620 --> 01:38:01,100
Yeah, there's yeah, that's that's something and like even like a gasoline is kind of a good smell

1405
01:38:01,860 --> 01:38:05,980
Yeah, like gasoline kind of a good smell and then well, that's a smell from jaws actually

1406
01:38:05,980 --> 01:38:10,580
I don't I don't mind a little bit of distant like a fire is about to start

1407
01:38:10,580 --> 01:38:15,340
Yeah in my theme park environments and then like opening a new toy is so

1408
01:38:15,580 --> 01:38:20,260
Plastic e or paint smell and it's certainly not good for you. But man, is that a nice smell? Yes

1409
01:38:20,260 --> 01:38:22,700
I love that plastic smell

1410
01:38:23,900 --> 01:38:28,700
so it is interesting because it's not like I'm I guess well my point is that I'm not so adverse to a

1411
01:38:29,460 --> 01:38:34,860
Smell that's weird and bad. Sure. Sure. It's just for whatever reason flume is hitting me and I'm like

1412
01:38:34,860 --> 01:38:39,060
That's not so I may be leaning flume weirdly you like avatar Jason of what we sampled here

1413
01:38:41,140 --> 01:38:45,460
Passage flight or flying over feet that similar

1414
01:38:46,100 --> 01:38:49,740
Apple melon bergamot I think is how they described it

1415
01:38:49,740 --> 01:38:50,900
Yeah

1416
01:38:50,900 --> 01:38:53,340
I like that smell if that's the agree

1417
01:38:53,340 --> 01:38:59,320
I mean I would like round up and say that if we're calling the group favorites the the avatar smells

1418
01:38:59,580 --> 01:39:05,380
Yeah smells because you know flume is only maybe I'm only thinking of it because it's recent. Yeah

1419
01:39:05,900 --> 01:39:10,060
It's kind of hit-and-miss like we did a grocery store pick up

1420
01:39:10,340 --> 01:39:15,740
We end up with all these plastic bags and I was like, hey these kind of smell good and then

1421
01:39:16,580 --> 01:39:19,580
I'm sitting next to one and I'm like I need to

1422
01:39:20,460 --> 01:39:26,940
Leave the room cuz now I'm starting to feel bad like it's starting to be overwhelming. Yeah

1423
01:39:27,500 --> 01:39:29,300
Yeah, and now

1424
01:39:29,300 --> 01:39:34,640
Mike would you like to revisit Stokey now that it's been sitting around? What do we think about like?

1425
01:39:35,260 --> 01:39:41,100
Rotting for 15 minutes Stokey as opposed to you mean fresh out of my plastic bag stoke Mike

1426
01:39:41,100 --> 01:39:44,200
This is brand new or no, I'm supposed to take this with yeah

1427
01:39:44,240 --> 01:39:50,440
You got to take that with you because you got it out mid can I have a plastic bag to keep it in?

1428
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:58,740
So I don't absolutely I'm a man who lives to serve take my plastic bag my good man

1429
01:39:59,680 --> 01:40:05,380
The burnt part it just smells like a burnt piece of wood or something. Yes. No, this is not good

1430
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:12,460
Not good. I should have maybe gone for but I also I think that the difference between how we all felt about a $10

1431
01:40:12,580 --> 01:40:17,140
Versus a $300. I don't think you should have done that

1432
01:40:17,140 --> 01:40:22,220
I feel like I see but I feel like I see friend of the show Matt Cardona smoke a cigar in his hot tub

1433
01:40:22,220 --> 01:40:27,740
I'm on Instagram or whatever. Maybe if we're in Orlando, I mean, I'm not saying he's gonna buy us to the tub

1434
01:40:27,740 --> 01:40:30,340
I'm just saying maybe he knows where to go in Orlando

1435
01:40:30,900 --> 01:40:35,420
Could we are you allowed to smoke a cigar on the boardwalk? I don't know

1436
01:40:36,580 --> 01:40:41,540
Usually public smoking areas in theme parks, but he but that's the hotel

1437
01:40:41,900 --> 01:40:48,460
Yeah, the hotels have a sign smoking areas. Okay, so the answer is probably no, but probably off to the side

1438
01:40:48,460 --> 01:40:50,460
There might be a little section on the boardwalk

1439
01:40:50,780 --> 01:40:55,500
They try to keep it away from places that are it's like you don't get like scenic views in your smoking areas

1440
01:40:55,500 --> 01:41:00,340
Right is too bad. Oh what you'd want but I guess I'd I guess I want to be in those places without

1441
01:41:01,020 --> 01:41:05,980
Dense smoke. Yeah, when I stayed at the Beach Club a few years ago

1442
01:41:06,020 --> 01:41:13,060
There's was like a lot of reeds and some fountains and stuff. So that was still pretty scenic. Okay

1443
01:41:13,060 --> 01:41:17,340
Okay, they let they let smokers look at something besides an alley. Yeah

1444
01:41:17,700 --> 01:41:24,340
well, I was looking at the Universal Orlando app and it seemed like they moved the

1445
01:41:25,340 --> 01:41:33,140
Smoking area from the dead center of Celestial Park to like the side of stardust racers

1446
01:41:33,420 --> 01:41:36,740
Wow, like it seems like where a dumpster would be

1447
01:41:38,740 --> 01:41:42,420
Geez they had like a prime spot, I guess dead center of the park

1448
01:41:42,420 --> 01:41:47,000
I can't even hold this without it peeling apart. It's so funny that I gave you the worst

1449
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:51,060
There was one where I was like, I fucked it up and I even thought like I should take that one instead

1450
01:41:51,060 --> 01:41:56,460
I wasn't thinking I'm handing it out and but it is perfect for you. Like you prank your luck and mischief that you yes

1451
01:41:56,460 --> 01:42:02,460
That is true. I wasn't trying to explode you. I swear. All right, and I guess thinker. Um, anyway, I

1452
01:42:03,140 --> 01:42:04,820
What one little?

1453
01:42:04,820 --> 01:42:09,280
remaining thing is that I got a little I mean one thing we haven't really talked about is like

1454
01:42:09,860 --> 01:42:15,820
The process here and and if you know, maybe we have our questions about like how accurate they're able to get but you know

1455
01:42:15,820 --> 01:42:19,360
Some of the some of them are impressive and I I just don't know

1456
01:42:19,360 --> 01:42:20,140
I

1457
01:42:20,140 --> 01:42:25,860
Didn't know like what it's like putting these things together and how these smells are extracted and how they chase them and how you end

1458
01:42:25,860 --> 01:42:29,800
Up like how the actual stores, you know that makers

1459
01:42:30,440 --> 01:42:35,760
You know what what allows the do they have to do research and how close can they get to the real smells?

1460
01:42:35,760 --> 01:42:37,760
Just like what is the process there?

1461
01:42:38,200 --> 01:42:40,200
So I went to one of these

1462
01:42:40,760 --> 01:42:46,880
Etsy stores I sent just a DM on Etsy to one of the actual doors that makes these things

1463
01:42:46,880 --> 01:42:49,160
Yeah, called scent simulations

1464
01:42:49,160 --> 01:42:53,120
I sent him a message and asked if like could I just ask you a couple questions about like kind of the process here and

1465
01:42:53,120 --> 01:42:55,120
The owner was nice enough to write me back

1466
01:42:55,480 --> 01:43:02,280
His name is Beaumont G. Mannheim and he sent me a little voice memo that just kind of like takes us into the process

1467
01:43:03,160 --> 01:43:08,160
So this could be education just in terms of like how these you know, what the process is actually all about

1468
01:43:09,720 --> 01:43:12,560
Hey Scott, it's a Bo

1469
01:43:13,560 --> 01:43:15,560
Beaumont G. Mannheim

1470
01:43:15,920 --> 01:43:21,240
And I just want to thank you for reaching out. It's a real joy making these candles

1471
01:43:21,880 --> 01:43:23,880
the olfactory glands are actually

1472
01:43:25,360 --> 01:43:27,360
the strongest of the

1473
01:43:27,640 --> 01:43:29,640
sense memory glands

1474
01:43:29,960 --> 01:43:31,960
and the best way to

1475
01:43:32,440 --> 01:43:38,000
Reach them in your house through the candle and candles start with wax

1476
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:42,280
There's a thousand colors and a thousand types of wicks

1477
01:43:42,280 --> 01:43:48,080
But the wax I would say is the heart of the candle. I always say quality wax quality candle

1478
01:43:48,920 --> 01:43:56,960
At scent simulations we use soy, paraffin wax blend, which I think helps you achieve the strongest scent throw

1479
01:43:57,880 --> 01:44:01,240
So it gives you a longer burn, but with the paraffin you get those

1480
01:44:01,920 --> 01:44:03,400
quality

1481
01:44:03,400 --> 01:44:10,360
Hydrocarbons, which really unlocks the strong scent for the hot throw. I always say you don't want to focus on the cold throw

1482
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:15,880
To the detriment of the hot throw. The hot throw is really where the scent lives

1483
01:44:18,080 --> 01:44:22,160
Now as far as favorite scents, I would say it's up to the candle maker's imagination

1484
01:44:23,560 --> 01:44:29,640
Pirates of the Caribbean water. What you're using is a little bit of a stale moldy scent, but don't worry

1485
01:44:29,640 --> 01:44:36,120
It's not actual mold. Just mix that in with hard water the kind that you would find from a sprinkler

1486
01:44:36,760 --> 01:44:40,920
You kind of deconstruct that naturally using the soy

1487
01:44:42,040 --> 01:44:45,360
The same would go for yacht club towel scent

1488
01:44:48,240 --> 01:44:52,760
A candle can really I guess smell like anything. We've done candles that smell like an orange grove

1489
01:44:53,440 --> 01:44:55,440
For those of you who like sorin

1490
01:44:56,920 --> 01:45:02,560
It's kind of the same deal that they use for that or an ice cream parlor

1491
01:45:04,200 --> 01:45:06,200
Calm ocean breeze, popcorn

1492
01:45:08,680 --> 01:45:10,680
Even the scent of

1493
01:45:10,720 --> 01:45:16,760
I'm coming club three. You can't hide forever

1494
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
Oh my god

1495
01:45:26,760 --> 01:45:29,160
I've guys. Oh, I am sorry

1496
01:45:29,160 --> 01:45:34,040
I first I did a poor job cutting the cigars and then I didn't listen to it and no you didn't prior before

1497
01:45:34,040 --> 01:45:38,640
I got scent simulations with some kind of sting operation. Whoa, you're tip

1498
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,000
The kindly candle maker

1499
01:45:41,320 --> 01:45:48,160
Beaumont G. Mannheim the whole time was bug main. Oh my god. I feel so deceived right now

1500
01:45:49,200 --> 01:45:55,080
Jesus no way. I felt right it. How did I just happen to gravitate towards that particular store?

1501
01:45:55,080 --> 01:45:58,080
I owe you guys a little power. I'm really at that

1502
01:45:58,240 --> 01:46:03,360
He's what much like bugs bunny as we've been referring to in his rascally ways

1503
01:46:03,760 --> 01:46:09,200
This gosh jeez just like you know the way he's able to you know use various

1504
01:46:09,640 --> 01:46:13,080
Disguises to get an omer fudge good graces and then BAM

1505
01:46:13,600 --> 01:46:16,960
He just he waltzed right in here as a nice old kid

1506
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:22,120
Wait, I mean what Jason you must have been into were you were you enjoying those tales of candle making?

1507
01:46:22,120 --> 01:46:30,000
I very much was enjoying it. But as I was reading this can I was like that's weird. There's no mention of scent

1508
01:46:30,720 --> 01:46:32,520
simulations on here

1509
01:46:32,560 --> 01:46:40,000
Well, I don't know. I mean, yeah, like it's I it's weird that I didn't end up feeling like I should buy from sense simulations

1510
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:44,840
But that they were the one that I yeah decided to DM and I get I mean, you know, I

1511
01:46:45,920 --> 01:46:48,440
Guess if I had ordered one I would have opened the can

1512
01:46:48,440 --> 01:46:53,120
I know just would have been just a a little bug with a skittle scattled right out of the canister

1513
01:46:53,640 --> 01:46:57,480
This is I'm gonna report this store. Yeah to Etsy sense

1514
01:46:57,640 --> 01:47:04,880
Do not buy from do not buy the wind mattress the dream mattress and do not buy from sense simulations because Beaumont G

1515
01:47:04,880 --> 01:47:10,880
Mannheim is not who he's a charlatan. Yeah, Jesus. Okay. Well, I don't know where that takes us

1516
01:47:10,880 --> 01:47:15,320
I like boy what a what a tease for next month's poll

1517
01:47:15,320 --> 01:47:17,920
I know I don't know how that's gonna affect things

1518
01:47:17,920 --> 01:47:21,600
But he's got he snuck right in here and I got lit, you know, let's get out of here

1519
01:47:21,600 --> 01:47:25,440
I guess for any other yeah, I don't want surprises with her. Yeah, Jesus Christ

1520
01:47:25,560 --> 01:47:30,100
Or I have more particles in my mouth from the cigar

1521
01:47:32,520 --> 01:47:34,520
Particles in your mouth

1522
01:47:36,360 --> 01:47:44,400
My my olfactory senses are working over time as are my tear ducts and now my brain's working over time

1523
01:47:44,400 --> 01:47:48,760
He truly can be any yeah, he could be around any corner

1524
01:47:48,760 --> 01:47:52,680
Yeah, they're way who know there there could have been guests who've been on the show

1525
01:47:53,200 --> 01:47:55,800
Multiple times who were all just like surprise

1526
01:47:55,800 --> 01:47:58,520
Yeah, like where we've been planning it for years

1527
01:47:58,520 --> 01:48:03,440
Like what if we found out there is no Julia Prescott she and she has been bug main

1528
01:48:03,440 --> 01:48:09,480
Oh, yeah guys this entire time Marvel's planning or invasion Jason. Uh-huh. They were they were yeah scrawl, but

1529
01:48:14,280 --> 01:48:19,240
Yeah, all right well where I guess in any up there you never know when the book could strike

1530
01:48:19,360 --> 01:48:21,360
But if you want to vote for the bug to strike

1531
01:48:21,960 --> 01:48:25,400
Next month's poll is on the way. We need your new topic suggestions

1532
01:48:26,120 --> 01:48:30,880
And otherwise you survived podcast the ride. Thanks for subscribing to club 3

1533
01:48:31,840 --> 01:48:38,040
Your bravery saved the podcast. Well done freedom fighters. There's no panel. It's the smell of

1534
01:48:39,360 --> 01:48:46,560
Intimacy. Yeah, it was prime. Oh, maybe I'll work on it. Just a big romantic hotbox you saved our planet

1535
01:48:46,560 --> 01:48:48,560
Well done my oh

1536
01:48:48,880 --> 01:48:50,880
He blew smoke into the car

1537
01:48:51,400 --> 01:48:56,000
That would rule. It's suck my smoke Michael. That should be a fan fest nights

1538
01:48:56,440 --> 01:49:00,560
Thing we're only for fan fest you pay the extra money. He blows his exhaust

1539
01:49:01,720 --> 01:49:03,720
exhaust at you

1540
01:49:04,520 --> 01:49:06,520
But straight from my engine

1541
01:49:07,200 --> 01:49:11,440
I've been cooking it up all day just for you, Michael. You're welcome
