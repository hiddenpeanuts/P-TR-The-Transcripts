1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,840
Forever.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:03,680
Dog.

3
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:08,680
Live from the Lyric Hyperion in Los Angeles, California.

4
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:18,400
It's an intimate Christmas evening with podcast, The Ride.

5
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:23,400
Featuring appearances by Regis Philbin, Michael Eisner,

6
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,240

00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:35,240

Chuck E. Cheese, and hopefully not for some reason, Chucko.

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,520
We take you now to Jason Sheridan's Gingerbread Cottage

10
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,480
in the Forest, where old man Jason is settling in

11
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,120
for a long winter's nap.

12
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,380
Really coming down out there.

13
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,180
Darn kids trying to eat my house.

14
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:24,380
I built it deep in the woods for a reason, for me to eat.

15
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:29,140
Now I can enjoy my holiday in solitude,

16
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:31,540
reading and studying.

17
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:34,180
Oh yes, what a time it will be,

18
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:37,620
eating gingerbread doorknobs and gingerbread hinges

19
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:39,020
all by my lonesome.

20
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,100
Oh, who could that be?

21
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:43,940
Come in.

22
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,260
Hi there, hi.

23
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:47,100
Oh hi.

24
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:47,940
Hello.

25
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,220
Hi.

26
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,460
Oh boy.

27
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:52,620
Really coming down out there.

28
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:53,460
Yeah.

29
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:54,300
Oh boy.

30
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,980
I'm really sorry to bother you.

31
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:58,140
Are you the new neighbor?

32
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:01,140
Well, it's been a long time since I've been the new anything.

33
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,060
Very, very, very good.

34
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:07,940
Listen, you seem like a nice man.

35
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:09,200
I don't want to bother you.

36
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,580
Let me just explain.

37
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:11,420
My name's Scott.

38
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:13,740
I'm the theme park podcaster from Up the Road.

39
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:14,580
Oh.

40
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:18,220
Well say I'm a theme park podcaster as well.

41
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:19,220
No kidding.

42
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:20,060
Really, really.

43
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:22,740
You get into some of the newer stuff?

44
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:23,580
Oh sure.

45
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:24,500
I think it's marvelous.

46
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,900
Some of it's real fine.

47
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:26,740
Real fine.

48
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:27,580
Wonderful.

49
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:28,540
Geez.

50
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:30,700
Well, you seem like a very kindhearted man.

51
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,140
I was wondering if you could help me

52
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:34,180
with my little predicament.

53
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:36,020
You see, what with the blizzard and all,

54
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,620
my power went out.

55
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:41,940
And I've got a sack full of theme park related

56
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,340
holiday clips.

57
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,980
And no one to share them with.

58
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:52,340
Well, that's an unfortunate predicament,

59
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,060
but sadly I can't help you.

60
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:56,660
No?

61
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:57,480
Really?

62
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,320
I came all this way.

63
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,460
All the way down the block.

64
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:03,620
I've got a lot of gingerbread house to eat by New Year's.

65
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:05,960
Interesting.

66
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,540
Well then I guess I'll also have no one

67
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:11,500
with whom to share these Tate's double chocolate chip

68
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,140
cookies.

69
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,620
Why don't you take a seat?

70
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:15,460
Pull up a chair.

71
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,460
Oh.

72
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,580
Change your mind.

73
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:18,420
Lovely.

74
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,460
Thank you so much, sir.

75
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,220
I'm sorry, kids.

76
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,260
Kids, I'm so sorry.

77
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,340
I'm just gonna,

78
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,780
it doesn't look like we're gonna have a house

79
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,580
to spend the holidays at this year.

80
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,980
Sorry, hold on.

81
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,420
Hold on one second.

82
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,660
I went into such credit card debt turning.

83
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,260
Shut the fuck up out there.

84
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:42,260
But the credit cards offered such lucrative rewards.

85
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:46,300
But the credit cards offered such lucrative rewards.

86
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,980
I spent us into a hole, kids.

87
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:49,820
I'm so sorry.

88
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,820
I don't think there's gonna be any sort of festivities

89
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:52,780
this year.

90
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:54,780
Oh no.

91
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,540
Well, if you're gonna make a fuss about it,

92
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,300
just come on in.

93
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,140
What's that?

94
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,980
Oh, thank you kindly old sir.

95
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:11,980
Oh.

96
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:13,660
Thank you.

97
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,540
The age, the wisdom you have in your eyes.

98
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:16,980
Thank you very much.

99
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:22,020
Is it okay if I bring my kids?

100
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:23,740
Up to you, your house.

101
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:24,580
Fine.

102
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,940
Okay, hold on one second.

103
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,900
I don't wanna knock anything over.

104
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:30,740
All right.

105
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:39,100
Well, it's hard to stay mad at a whole community

106
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:42,180
of characters who come with fully customizable outfits.

107
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,340
How many months is the bird?

108
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,340
He's a mailman.

109
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:53,580
Oh, so quite old then if he has a profession.

110
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:56,300
Yes, I'd like to introduce you to Duffy,

111
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:59,460
his non-sexual life partner, Shelly May.

112
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:02,900
You sure about that?

113
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:03,740
You're totally sure about that?

114
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:04,980
I'm totally sure.

115
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:07,700
So it's a Jay and Silent Bob sort of relationship?

116
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,820
No, it is not Jay and Silent Bob.

117
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:10,860
Two body, I think.

118
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:13,740
Two body, their love is wholesome and pure.

119
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:14,580
Fair enough.

120
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,940
Their love is a perfect love.

121
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,020
And of course-

122
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,380
The Christmas spirit said that.

123
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:26,380
This is a gelatoni and he does one thing.

124
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:28,820
He fucks.

125
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:36,300
Oh, how rude of me gentlemen.

126
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:39,820
This is my audience of 85 people

127
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:42,260
plus 10 give or take friends and family.

128
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:44,540
Oh sure, oh wow.

129
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:47,340
That's an unusual feature for a cabin, oh my.

130
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:53,700
Well, you know what, in addition to all the clips in my sack,

131
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,060
I do have some things that I could potentially share

132
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,300
with some of the audience.

133
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,980
If that's something, they'd be-

134
00:05:58,980 --> 00:05:59,820
Sure.

135
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:04,700
Before I say what the thing is,

136
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,060
let me just see if I can get a reaction out of it.

137
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:09,300
Is anybody a particularly big Knott's Berry Farm fan?

138
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,140
Woo!

139
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,540
I should have known if I asked that to this crowd,

140
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,540
it would be a tie of 85.

141
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:19,300
Who traveled from the furthest?

142
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,780
This is an LA show, but-

143
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:21,620
I'm in the-

144
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:22,460
What?

145
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:23,540
Oh hi, wait, we met you.

146
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:24,700
Oh hi, what's going on?

147
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,100
Well, you know what, then to-

148
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,620
We gotta give you a-

149
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:29,460
Wait, let me ask a question.

150
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,100
Have you been to Knott's Berry Farm?

151
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,060
I wasn't really-

152
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:35,900
Once is fine!

153
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:36,740
Once is fine!

154
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:37,580
Yeah!

155
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:38,420
Yeah!

156
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:39,260
Yeah!

157
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,100
Yeah!

158
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:40,940
Yay!

159
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:43,100
That works then, and it's perfect,

160
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,900
because what we have, this is actually Christmas related.

161
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,340
This is a Christmas ornament

162
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:50,460
from Knott's now closed iron reef

163
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:54,300
VR attraction.

164
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:57,420
Yeah, here, let me go ahead and answer this to you.

165
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:00,060
You know, I'd like to get in on this gift-giving fun,

166
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,500
because I-

167
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,620
Yes.

168
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:06,220
Cleaned out some garbage from my gingerbread house.

169
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:07,060
It's just your thing?

170
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,060
While we're on Knott's Berry Farm,

171
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,140
any other Knott's Berry Farm fans here?

172
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:16,060
Who thinks they've been the most?

173
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,060
Oh.

174
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,140
Not a great-

175
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,380
I see a hand.

176
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,220
Oh, you work there!

177
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,820
That's going a lot.

178
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,460
Says the person in the tiny Fuppet shirt.

179
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:30,820
What?

180
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:34,780
Calico River Rapids Poncho.

181
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:35,620
Yeah.

182
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:37,260
Take that.

183
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:41,180
Was that, wait, wait, was that worn by you at the press night?

184
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,020
Yes, it was.

185
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,420
Why didn't, wait, hold on,

186
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:47,940
why didn't you throw that away like Scott and I did?

187
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,660
You never know what'll come in handy.

188
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:54,500
And that's why it also comes with this hand towel from Club 33.

189
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,340
Oh!

190
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:01,460
Wow.

191
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,300
Wow.

192
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,060
Any more garbage?

193
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,900
You do have more garbage.

194
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,300
Yeah, I got a few rounds of garbage.

195
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:11,140
Okay, this is, they send you Comic-Con badges

196
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:13,180
in these cute little boxes now.

197
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:20,340
And this is a pack of absolute carnage, temporary tattoos.

198
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:21,860
What?

199
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,980
We are now completely off of the theme.

200
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:28,780
This one's got Jack Ryan on the inside.

201
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:31,380
Who wants the tchotchke box?

202
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:34,660
That, she's enthusiastic there, I think.

203
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:37,660
This also comes with a Club 33 hand towel.

204
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:43,180
Oh, yeah, I think so.

205
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:46,780
Most Jack Ryan enthusiasm ever produced by anyone.

206
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:51,580
Okay, this is another year Comic-Con box.

207
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,260
What?

208
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,980
What the hell is this?

209
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:57,740
Are there any Brooklyn Nine-Nine fans?

210
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:01,540
Okay, this comes with a very tiny pin.

211
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:06,300
Seems like less, huh?

212
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:10,300
Go, oh, an Ifca man, all right, you get this.

213
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,140
Oh.

214
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:13,860
Hey, Jason, do you have any loose leaf

215
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,660
notebook paper for them?

216
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:16,500
Yes, I do.

217
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:20,740
Here's your box and your Club 33 hand towel.

218
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:26,660
These are my handwritten notes from being forced

219
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:28,540
to watch the Haunted Mansion movie.

220
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,260
And a Club 33 hand towel.

221
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:40,180
This was the first hand I saw.

222
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,700
And this is the last thing to wrap up

223
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,180
this interminable bit.

224
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:49,020
Okay, this is a shirt I have, but T-Public

225
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:51,540
sent me the wrong one so that I got the right one.

226
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,340
And they told me to keep it.

227
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:55,020
This is the five original X-Men

228
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:57,860
and the Helvetica ampersand kind of thing.

229
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:02,220
Does anyone like the X-Men and wear a medium?

230
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,820
There, there in the front.

231
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:09,780
Maybe, here's your shirt and your Club 33 hand towel.

232
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:11,700
Wow.

233
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:17,660
Wonderful, a little like surprise secret Santa

234
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:20,460
for all of our friends for this holiday gathering.

235
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:25,780
You know, I know we all just met, but also we were just

236
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:28,580
talking about how there's a special gift

237
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:31,820
for a special someone in the audience.

238
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,380
Do you want to pull people in on that?

239
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:34,900
Oh, sure, I mean, I think we have actually

240
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,500
a special representative here from a company

241
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,220
that we all have a lot of affection for.

242
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:42,300
Excuse me, Anthony Gio, is he around?

243
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,140
Woo!

244
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:48,140
Oh, there he is.

245
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:52,020
Wow, wow, through the gingerbread door, good to see ya.

246
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:55,660
I wasn't sure if that was the door or the chimney.

247
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:00,500
So yeah, I hear you actually have a new job.

248
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:05,180
Yes, so I'm happy to announce I'm the new brand manager

249
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:07,540
for Skull Chewing Tobacco.

250
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,740
Great, great, great.

251
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:15,100
And I have a little secret Santa gift here

252
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:18,860
so I'm not only here spreading good tidings and cheer,

253
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:23,180
I'm here to pack a mean lip as this.

254
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:25,380
Pack a mean lip.

255
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,820
And so on behalf of Skull, Skull,

256
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:32,820
a pinch better since 1934, I would like to honor

257
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:38,140
and reward this to Skull's Dipper of the Year 2019,

258
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,060
Mr. Nick Mundy.

259
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:40,900
Yeah!

260
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:41,940
Yeah!

261
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:48,940
That's it!

262
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:56,940
And just for social media, for social media,

263
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,500
we have to take a picture.

264
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,700
No, no, bullshit.

265
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,900
It's not yours, you don't do it.

266
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,740
Yeah, sir, do you mind?

267
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,300
Thank you so much.

268
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,700
He's gotta pack the lip before we take the photo.

269
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,380
Sure.

270
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:14,220
Not enough time, not enough time.

271
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,420
It's important for the audience to know that...

272
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,780
Anyone have another bottle?

273
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:19,620
Or like a tin can?

274
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:23,740
If any theater management can get Nick Mundy a dip cup,

275
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,980
if not, it's going everywhere.

276
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:27,820
For the key work.

277
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:31,300
You drinking that coffee?

278
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,140
That man is drinking that coffee.

279
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:38,540
For the audience at home, Nick's wife is thrilled right now.

280
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:44,340
Dipper of the Year, any thoughts upon getting this reward?

281
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:45,660
About goddamn time.

282
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:51,780
And for the tight end of the holidays, it is winter green.

283
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,660
Happy holidays, sir.

284
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:54,500
Nick Mundy.

285
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:59,540
And from Skull Magazine, Anthony Geo.

286
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:00,380
Good to see you.

287
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,420
Thanks for swinging by.

288
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,860
We should have you on the show more often.

289
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:05,060
All right.

290
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:07,340
Okay, so with those gifts being given,

291
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:11,660
the main gift now to give out is this sack full of clips.

292
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,540
Let me just, I'll just like rattle them.

293
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:18,700
Like the spirit of them will go up to the booth.

294
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,140
Here we go.

295
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,820
Okay, and I see them.

296
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,820
The bits and bytes traveling up.

297
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,340
Let's have a seat, gentlemen.

298
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,020
Let's settle in.

299
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:28,860
Oh, boy.

300
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,180
Duffy, oh, careful.

301
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:33,140
Oh yeah, sorry.

302
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,620
Is this seat taken?

303
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,420
Lightning McQueen man, huh?

304
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:42,540
My son is allowed to dress how he wants.

305
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:48,660
Hey, Scott here.

306
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:49,500
From this point on,

307
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,140
we're gonna be showing a bunch of Christmas clips.

308
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:53,700
So if you aren't sure what's happening visually,

309
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,300
or you just wanna follow along with us,

310
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,620
we'll be posting all of the clips to our Twitter

311
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:02,620
at podcast the ride and using the hashtag PTR sack-o-clips.

312
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:07,860
That's hashtag PTR sack-o-clips.

313
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,500
So we'll be posting all the stuff there.

314
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,340
Go check it out.

315
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:14,500
Yeah, well, hey, thanks so much everybody for coming out.

316
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:18,220
You know, we did an episode a couple years ago.

317
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:21,540
It was called the Christmas Special Christmas Special,

318
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:25,420
where we dug into the vast archive of strange,

319
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:28,180
inane Disney theme park specials.

320
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:31,620
And we wanted to dig deeper, you know,

321
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:34,900
find, you know, worse muck and scum,

322
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:37,940
aligning the walls of the Disney vault.

323
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:41,060
The stuff they're not brave enough to put on Disney Plus.

324
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:46,820
But we're happy to put on display for you here.

325
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,380
Sound good, everybody excited?

326
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,500
Wonderful.

327
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,020
Nice way to spend the holidays.

328
00:14:55,020 --> 00:15:00,020
You know, he got a big shout when we were introducing folks

329
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:02,740
at the beginning, you know, it wouldn't be a true

330
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:05,620
Disney Christmas Special without an introduction

331
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:08,780
from a very special person, and that's Michael Eisner.

332
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:09,620
Yeah!

333
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:18,620
You know, Michael Eisner did a number of great holiday intros.

334
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:23,100
There's a lot to choose from, but there was this one

335
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,540
that I especially enjoyed, and I think all you need

336
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:29,940
to know about it is that it's in service of a lot of people

337
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,860
and that it's a special event is about ice skating.

338
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,580
That's all I need to say.

339
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:37,380
At tonight's Christmas show, we celebrate the holiday season

340
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:40,820
with some of your favorite Olympic ice skating stars.

341
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:43,780
Well, Michael Eisner and the Walt Disney Company.

342
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:46,100
During the holiday season here in Southern California,

343
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,220
we don't get much ice or snow.

344
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:51,020
So instead of ice skating, we're rollerblading.

345
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:52,420
It's a great way to get around the lot

346
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:54,100
here at the Disney Studio.

347
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,860
Gee, Michael, can you rollerblade?

348
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:58,020
Well, Mickey, just a little.

349
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,900
Could you show us?

350
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:00,740
Well.

351
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:04,780
The list card, homie, took out a red hat.

352
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:06,180
And sunglasses.

353
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,300
What a dink.

354
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,140
Okay.

355
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,100
Bye.

356
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:10,940
Bye, mom.

357
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:11,780
Be careful, Michael.

358
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:12,620
Yeah.

359
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:15,660
Gee, Minnie, homie got the...

360
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:16,500
He skated away.

361
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,660
Oh, oh, did we see that?

362
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:19,500
Ah!

363
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,340
Ah!

364
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,260
Jump, spin.

365
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:22,260
Not the spin.

366
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,100
Spin.

367
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:23,940
Oh!

368
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:27,900
Gosh, that was pretty good for an old guy.

369
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:31,220
Oh, Michael, you were great.

370
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:33,820
You know Minnie, I'm a little out of practice.

371
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:34,660
Yeah, sure.

372
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,500
Enjoy tonight's show.

373
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,820
How about that?

374
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:37,660
Woo!

375
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:42,340
You know, I know the glasses and the hat

376
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:46,380
were to cover the stunt, you know, switcheroo.

377
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:51,380
But in the 90s, that glasses and hat combo communicated,

378
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:52,820
I am the Unibomber.

379
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:56,180
I am the police sketch of the Unibomber.

380
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:59,300
Wasn't the Unibomber, didn't he wear a hood over his head?

381
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,140
Didn't he have like a hoodie?

382
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:01,620
I guess he had the hood.

383
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,380
You're thinking of a different guy.

384
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:06,260
A different bomber.

385
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:08,780
I'm thinking of that drawing in those spam ads

386
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:10,220
where it's like thousands of people

387
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,780
dream this man every night.

388
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,380
Yeah, yeah, that's it.

389
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:15,980
That guy.

390
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:18,860
I mean, we all, we dream Eisner every night, certainly.

391
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:20,860
I think everyone here does.

392
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:24,100
The rest of that special I scoured for anything worth

393
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:25,260
showing to you guys.

394
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:29,580
And the, there's, it's not really worth sitting to,

395
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:32,780
this far too much Bronson Pinchot for my taste.

396
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,900
But this clip kind of, I think,

397
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,940
tells you everything you need to know.

398
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:39,780
Here, I got it.

399
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:40,620
Okay.

400
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:43,620
Here we go.

401
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:46,380
["The Unibomber"]

402
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,500
["The Unibomber"]

403
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,100
Donald and Pluto finally had the last point

404
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,140
of the magic snowflake.

405
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:01,980
The end.

406
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,260
For,

407
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,260
for the listener at home,

408
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:12,420
ice skater,

409
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:15,980
Scott Hamilton, joined by saxophonist, Tom Scott.

410
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:18,500
And that's how lame my music taste is

411
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,300
that I know who the saxophone player was in this thing.

412
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,460
Do you know what else he's played on?

413
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:24,940
I mean, and a lot of good solo stuff.

414
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:27,660
He was in the, you know, the 70s SNL band here and there.

415
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:31,340
He was Chevy Chase's band leader on the Chevy Chase show.

416
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:33,980
The greatest talk show of all time.

417
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,220
They weren't brave enough to keep it on

418
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,460
longer than six weeks.

419
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:43,660
So, Scott Hamilton ice skates up to Tom Scott

420
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:47,620
and blows magic out of his hand.

421
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:50,620
And then, you know, there was a laugh from the audience.

422
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:52,100
And so in case you couldn't hear it,

423
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:54,580
then Bronson Pinchot narrates,

424
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:59,020
and so Donald and Pluto had the last part

425
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:00,660
of the magic snowflake.

426
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:01,500
The end.

427
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,380
That wrapped up nicely.

428
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:10,140
I spared you all the other parts of the magic snowflake,

429
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:13,140
which were all attained via excellent ice skating.

430
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,860
So what does the magic snowflake do?

431
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:22,060
Well, I think Bronson Pinchot's niece

432
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:25,060
throws it up in the air, who's never experienced winter,

433
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:27,740
and then it magically snows at Disneyland.

434
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:28,580
Oh, okay.

435
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:31,220
The thing that it does, like, every night

436
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:32,940
during the holidays?

437
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,540
Yes, but this time for real.

438
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:35,380
It's real, okay.

439
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah, for real.

440
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:40,060
Also in that special, Bronson Pinchot plays Jack Frost

441
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:43,340
in almost the same way that Martin Short did it later

442
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:44,940
in Santa Claus 3.

443
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:46,660
So if you're a fan of that and want to see

444
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:49,340
essentially the same makeup,

445
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:51,140
it's another place you could see it.

446
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:52,900
There you go.

447
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,540
So, you know, a Disney special,

448
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:57,900
the Disney Christmas parades,

449
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,740
Eisner set up the pins,

450
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:02,680
and then Regis Philbin knocked him down.

451
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:06,460
He was the king of these specials.

452
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:10,540
You know, so much broadcast skill and panache.

453
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:15,540
And let me make that especially evident with this clip.

454
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:20,860
This is from the 2002 Disney Christmas parade.

455
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:23,500
He is finishing talking to Eric Roberts,

456
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,780
who I guess was on some show at the time.

457
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:31,320
And he's introducing a musical performer.

458
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:35,560
And just from Regis and Kelly's description,

459
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:38,660
see if you just internally can guess

460
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:42,140
who the musical guest is.

461
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:44,980
And if I had more prizes, I'd give them to you

462
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,140
if you did figure it out.

463
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:46,980
Here we go.

464
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:49,900
Why don't you guys stick around for our next performance?

465
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:52,300
Yeah, he is a big rock star.

466
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:55,220
That's right, singer, performer, songwriter.

467
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:59,260
Yes, he's got the scratchy voice,

468
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:01,100
you know, the white teeth, got the whole thing.

469
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,820
You know who we're talking about.

470
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,940
John Resnick of the Goo Goo Dolls.

471
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:05,780
Sure.

472
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:07,460
He's here to make us sing his hit song

473
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:09,220
from Disney's Treasure Planet.

474
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:10,740
It's called I'm Still Here.

475
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:14,260
And then a little, here's a little taste.

476
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:16,020
This came up on the show recently.

477
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:17,940
Yes. Like you're a fan, I believe.

478
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:21,660
What is this song called again, Mike?

479
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:26,700
I'm Still Here, John's name?

480
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,100
Jim's theme.

481
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:31,180
All right, I'm so sorry.

482
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:33,460
I have seen the Goo Goo Dolls in concert twice.

483
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,820
Has anyone seen them more?

484
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:37,180
But twice.

485
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:38,660
Two, two?

486
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:40,340
Two, everyone two?

487
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:45,300
We've hit a stalemate on Goo Goo Dolls' concerts.

488
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,900
I saw them at the Hard Rock in Orlando.

489
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:52,140
Your personal bizarre concert series.

490
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:56,140
Pretty good.

491
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:57,380
Oh, we saw, Kate, my sister is right here.

492
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:59,300
We saw them, right?

493
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,140
Hello, my sister.

494
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:00,980
That's my sister, Kate.

495
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:02,380
Hey, hello, hello.

496
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:08,180
She didn't get any of the prizes.

497
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:09,020
Nope.

498
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:14,060
There'll be a big gift coming at Christmas, I'm sure.

499
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:14,900
Oh, sure.

500
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:17,140
And the gift of hanging out with your family.

501
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,500
The most precious things in the world to me.

502
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:29,940
We do another little Regis moment here.

503
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:31,260
This one's a lot of fun.

504
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:34,780
There was a bit on a lot of these specials

505
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:38,220
where Regis would get a little preview

506
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:41,780
of some of the upcoming attractions for the year

507
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:44,820
and future projects.

508
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:49,660
And so he would, he'd get a little behind the scenes taste

509
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,380
but then things would go a little bit awry.

510
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:54,140
This happened every year and this I think was the peak.

511
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:56,140
I think they might've stopped doing that after this year

512
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:57,660
because how do you top this one?

513
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,060
1993 or four, I believe.

514
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:05,620
I'm here at Disney's Future Projects Center

515
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:08,140
for a sneak preview look at an exciting new attraction

516
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:10,020
that's gonna be opening up in the coming year.

517
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:10,860
Come on in.

518
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,180
This must be the model.

519
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:15,020
Let's check it out.

520
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:15,860
Come on.

521
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:18,060
See, it looks a little scary, doesn't it?

522
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:18,900
Almost looks like a real thing.

523
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,740
The listener does an elevator door.

524
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:22,220
I wonder if these doors open.

525
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:24,420
They do.

526
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:25,260
They do.

527
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:27,060
What do you think, should I go inside?

528
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:27,900
I'll try.

529
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,380
Yeah, why not?

530
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:30,380
Oh yeah.

531
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:32,220
Ma, Ma!

532
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:34,620
Hey, what's happening here?

533
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:35,460
What's going on?

534
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,180
Holy mackerel, look at me.

535
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,300
I'm black and white.

536
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:41,860
Next stop, the Twilight Zone.

537
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:45,780
I don't like this.

538
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:49,860
The doors have opened.

539
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:50,700
He's screaming.

540
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:53,940
Full view of Disney Entertainment Studios.

541
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:57,220
Drop.

542
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,700
Listen, listen, listen to this.

543
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:01,860
I'm out of control.

544
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:09,260
What happened to him?

545
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:14,580
For the listener, he's one quarter his height.

546
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:17,220
Next year, you do the new projects update.

547
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:20,060
Right now, I got a whole lot of suits to alter.

548
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:25,820
And that's how Kelly Ripa got rid of Regis

549
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:27,460
and replaced him with Michael Strahan.

550
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:28,300
Sure.

551
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:31,700
She threw him into a broken elevator.

552
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:35,460
If I let him take the elevator too early,

553
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:38,300
an elevator surely would shrink you to one quarter

554
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:41,900
your usual height and make your voice be pitched up

555
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:43,740
four times its usual.

556
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:46,060
It would make your voice a lot cuter.

557
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:48,820
Oh yeah, a little Regis elf there.

558
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:49,660
Kind of adorable.

559
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:51,980
Now wonder they stopped doing it after this year.

560
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:54,300
They scarred Regis.

561
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:56,100
They like maimed him.

562
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:58,940
And he says the line, I'm out of control,

563
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:02,100
which is the Dana Carvey impression of him,

564
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,060
something he didn't actually say.

565
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:07,140
So they were like, say the line that you don't say.

566
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:07,980
Yeah.

567
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:12,020
Much like George W. Bush's beloved catchphrase,

568
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:15,220
strategic, not his own.

569
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:16,060
Right.

570
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:17,860
And not going to do it.

571
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,180
George H.W. Bush.

572
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:21,100
I'm not sure he ever said that.

573
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:21,940
Yeah.

574
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:23,860
All equally beloved figures.

575
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,020
Just nice men all around.

576
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:31,060
According to Ellen, yes.

577
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:32,700
Yeah, they're both pieces of shit.

578
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:33,540
That's right.

579
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:40,260
Strategic was also the name of George W. Bush's podcast.

580
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:41,100
Right?

581
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:41,940
What?

582
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:46,940
Was there a George W. Bush library podcast?

583
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:47,780
I don't know what you're talking about.

584
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:49,220
Was it called strategic?

585
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:50,060
Sound familiar to anybody?

586
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:51,660
The audience usually has Jason's back

587
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:53,500
on these kinds of things.

588
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,900
But there is befuddled.

589
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:55,740
I'm not sure.

590
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:56,580
I don't know.

591
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:57,420
I don't know what you're talking about.

592
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:58,260
I don't know what you're talking about.

593
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,100
I don't know what you're talking about.

594
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,700
But there is befuddled this guy.

595
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,540
That's just general support.

596
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:06,900
He just likes Jason.

597
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,060
And it means the world.

598
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:12,300
We'll figure that out.

599
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:13,140
Yeah, yeah.

600
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,780
We'll find the George Bush podcast.

601
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:17,140
It's strategic.

602
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:17,980
Oh, it's strategic.

603
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:18,820
That's what it's called.

604
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:20,060
Lindsay K. Tai is in the house.

605
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:21,060
Lindsay K. Tai.

606
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:23,620
The author.

607
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:27,060
The author of Jelatoni Fux.

608
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:28,180
Did you say that first?

609
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:29,380
Did you say that first?

610
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:34,860
I think you may have invented Jelatoni Fux.

611
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:37,700
Wow.

612
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:38,540
Yeah.

613
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:40,700
So she should hand for that.

614
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:41,540
Yeah.

615
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:45,020
It's going to be so many people's senior yearbook quote.

616
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:47,820
The rest of the time.

617
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:49,820
K-A-S, Jelatoni Fux.

618
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:51,380
Have a K-A-S.

619
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:52,700
Jelatoni Fux.

620
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:55,940
Let me see here.

621
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:58,740
I think elsewhere on the Regis front.

622
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:00,180
Let me see if I got this one.

623
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:01,940
Oh yeah, here we go.

624
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:05,020
For one year, and only for one year,

625
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:07,380
and we might see why from this quick cut down,

626
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:10,620
Regis was joined by his usual co-host,

627
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:14,620
not Kelly Ripa, but her predecessor.

628
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:16,060
And I'll show you this.

629
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:19,060
You know her face and love her voice.

630
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:22,460
Today it's Kathie Lee Gifford with a special holiday number.

631
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:23,820
Let's see what's happening elsewhere

632
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:24,900
in this fabulous resort.

633
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,620
First, someone that I think you know.

634
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:27,660
No, she's not here.

635
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:28,500
Kathie Lee Gifford.

636
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:29,340
She's everywhere.

637
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:30,340
With a couple hundred Christmas fans

638
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:32,420
at the Disney MGM Studios.

639
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:33,900
Merry Christmas, Kathie Lee.

640
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:36,980
Hi Regis, hi Joan.

641
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:38,860
Regis, you just can't get rid of me, can you?

642
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:41,260
Merry Christmas and happy holidays to everybody.

643
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:43,300
We are having a fabulous time here

644
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:45,380
at the Disney MGM Studios.

645
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:46,220
Yay!

646
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:48,820
Hi everybody.

647
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:52,220
Oh, they're so thrilled I'm here.

648
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:54,500
This is what the interior of a busy soundstage

649
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,700
really looks like.

650
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,380
And as you can see, the crew's really busy

651
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:59,180
getting ready for my big Christmas number.

652
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:00,740
I'm gonna sing my brains out.

653
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:11,580
I'll spare you the actual number, but I'm sorry.

654
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:12,780
You don't have it, do you?

655
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:13,740
I don't have it, no.

656
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:14,780
The booing does nothing.

657
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:15,620
Could you?

658
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,300
Could you sing?

659
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,140
Do you remember it?

660
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:21,700
I think it's walking in a winter wonderland,

661
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,540
is what it is.

662
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:25,180
But imagine it being sung,

663
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:28,740
imagine her singing her brains out on it.

664
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:31,460
So you gotta kinda astral project that.

665
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:37,260
I agree with Monday.

666
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:39,220
Oh no, now we've opened up,

667
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:40,860
now we got a peanut gallery.

668
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:44,220
He's all scolled up over there.

669
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:46,260
Ready to fight.

670
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:50,820
Scott, can I play a clip?

671
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:51,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

672
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:52,500
You wanna go to yours?

673
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,820
Yeah, yeah.

674
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:57,060
So, we love these clips,

675
00:28:57,060 --> 00:29:01,100
but we do need to acknowledge these are from the past.

676
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:01,940
Long ago.

677
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:05,500
And as the young person correspondent,

678
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:11,180
I had to see what's Disney up to in 2019.

679
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:13,500
Now I want you to remember,

680
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:16,100
this is happening in 2019.

681
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:18,780
This happened mere weeks ago.

682
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:21,020
And this clip, this is a little longer,

683
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:23,740
so bear with me, I'll narrate some of it.

684
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:25,780
This is like a magic trick.

685
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:26,740
It's got three parts.

686
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:29,140
It's got the pledge and the turn and the prestige.

687
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:36,100
And again, I do need to reiterate, this is 2019.

688
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:38,020
So as you can imagine.

689
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:39,260
The goo goo dolls.

690
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:44,260
Only the hippest, coolest influencers are in this.

691
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:50,340
Scared grumble from the crowd.

692
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,420
Yeah, that's Sting.

693
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:01,260
Sting.

694
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,300
This rocks.

695
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:09,300
Of course he's gonna sing a current Christmas tune

696
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:12,660
or something, right?

697
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:15,020
He's gonna sing something very modern.

698
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:18,660
No.

699
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,860
This is an every little thing.

700
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:23,620
Okay, so here's the ballerina.

701
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:25,180
The ballerina has now come out.

702
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:27,820
And if you haven't picked up yet,

703
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:29,700
this is everything she does.

704
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,220
Every little thing she does is magic.

705
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,540
Magic.

706
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:33,380
Yikes.

707
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,540
Here's some butterflies.

708
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:39,060
Some high school theater butterflies have arrived.

709
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:45,060
There's a fireworks burst set up to the energy.

710
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:48,300
I like this.

711
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:50,460
Yep.

712
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:54,300
Apparently has a Vegas residency up

713
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:56,340
and that's why he's coming up.

714
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:58,500
That's why it's all over this.

715
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:02,980
So the turn is coming in just a second.

716
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:07,380
Again, I cannot stress that the year is 2019.

717
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:09,540
Shaggy.

718
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:14,260
Oh man.

719
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:19,220
Hey everyone, say his name.

720
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:20,060
Shaggy.

721
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:22,540
Wow, that was fun.

722
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:28,460
Why, where's Sting?

723
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:29,980
He replaced Sting.

724
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:30,820
Shaggy.

725
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:31,900
They have an album together.

726
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:32,740
Barely moving.

727
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:34,420
Yeah, they have an album together.

728
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:35,260
Do they really?

729
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:38,180
So they have a single, they have a Christmas single.

730
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:43,420
They did not open the show with that Christmas single.

731
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:45,820
They closed the show with the Christmas single.

732
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:52,060
Here is Sting's mostly, or Shaggy's mostly white dance crew.

733
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:56,660
He just said it's a reggae Christmas.

734
00:31:56,660 --> 00:32:01,660
I was looking for a moment to go backstage

735
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:06,060
and get my wine and I think we were at that moment.

736
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:07,060
You can get it, yeah.

737
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:15,020
Shaggy is really grooving.

738
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:16,820
Is this the prestige or is that still coming?

739
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:18,660
Still coming, it's still coming.

740
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:20,580
We're in the second part of the magic.

741
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:22,780
Sweet Cabernet, take me away.

742
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:25,580
Oh shit.

743
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:28,180
What happened?

744
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:30,220
Well, we're gonna have to watch it all over again.

745
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:31,660
Okay.

746
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:34,300
Well, the ending is what you probably guessed.

747
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:38,900
All your favorite characters come out in tucks and tails

748
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:42,500
and they sway gently with Sting and Shaggy

749
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:46,620
tepidly, tepidly singing Feliz Navidad.

750
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:50,740
And then who are your hosts?

751
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:55,460
Why, it's Matthew Morrison from Glee and Baby Spice herself.

752
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:58,140
Again, 2019.

753
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:00,900
Disney, bring it out their best.

754
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:02,460
Baby's Emma Bunton?

755
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:03,580
Yep, that's right.

756
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:05,060
Wow.

757
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:07,580
What, does she have a Vegas residency?

758
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:09,180
I think she's just a host.

759
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:10,740
What, does some of y'all know?

760
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:13,820
Oh yeah, yeah.

761
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:14,660
Oh, sure.

762
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:15,700
Oh, for sure.

763
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,500
Yeah, so catch Sting in the new year

764
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,620
at Caesar's Palace, Las Vegas.

765
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:23,300
If he really gets going, some of those gigs go

766
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:24,900
for like 10, 12 hours.

767
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,860
He can go, he can go and go and go.

768
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:31,820
So the YouTube video I pulled this from,

769
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:34,220
there was only one comment on this video

770
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:37,940
from Gooch's mom.

771
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:42,660
And it said, oh, Sting,

772
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:44,940
I wish your arm would get better already.

773
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:49,580
Which apparently he tore a tendon in his shoulder

774
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:51,220
and had to have shoulder surgery.

775
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:53,420
So we wish him the best.

776
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:56,900
And Gooch's mom, most importantly,

777
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,340
wishes him the best.

778
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:01,540
Does Gooch too?

779
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:02,940
We'll never know.

780
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,460
Yeah, just his mom, I think.

781
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:07,100
Gooch likes current stuff.

782
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:09,940
We gotta get Gooch on the show.

783
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:11,740
Yeah, we gotta get Gooch on the show.

784
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:16,940
We've been trying to nail Gooch down.

785
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:18,620
Hasn't been happening.

786
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:22,340
Major topic, Pirates of the Caribbean with Gooch.

787
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:28,180
Special appearance by Gooch's mom.

788
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:32,940
New fourth host, Gooch.

789
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:35,020
Permanent.

790
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:38,380
Jason fired, Gooch hired.

791
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:41,660
Oh, snaked by Gooch again.

792
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:45,380
Mike and Scott willingly fired themselves.

793
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:47,100
Now the Gooch cast.

794
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:51,780
Forever dog changes to Gooch dog.

795
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:55,580
Forever Gooch is better.

796
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:56,420
I like that too.

797
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:57,260
Forever Gooch.

798
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:00,540
Unfortunately in 2020,

799
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:03,860
Taylor Swift's music does revert back to Gooch.

800
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:07,340
Sorry, Tay Tay.

801
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:11,300
Taylor Swift throws massive shade at the Grammys at Gooch.

802
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:17,060
Anymore?

803
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:18,300
Where do we take it from here?

804
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:21,700
I mean, Mike, feel free to throw in anything you want.

805
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:24,900
I've still, I could take us back to the past.

806
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:26,300
Yeah, take us to the past, I think.

807
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:28,340
I'll take you to the past.

808
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:31,340
After that disturbing look at 2019.

809
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:34,220
You know, I was,

810
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:37,780
my brain got poisoned as a kid

811
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:41,780
and I watched nothing but Disney specials and Disney parades.

812
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:42,780
And there was also this show,

813
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:43,780
did anybody watch something called

814
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:45,580
Walt Disney World Inside Out?

815
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:49,660
Worked my whole life to get into a room where

816
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:55,340
12% of people knew what the show was.

817
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:59,260
So this is,

818
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:03,220
this is from a Christmas episode of that show.

819
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:06,540
The host's name is Scott, incidentally.

820
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:09,420
I say that not to brag that I have the same name as him,

821
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:12,540
but you just, you might need to know it later.

822
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:17,540
And this is this host taking an attractive young guy

823
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:22,740
she, it's an attractive young worker.

824
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:23,820
That's all I can say.

825
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,740
I won't, I promise you, here's what I can promise.

826
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:29,500
I'm not gonna, I won't take this as far as Scott does.

827
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:30,900
As other Scott.

828
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:35,900
This is a tour of the shop in the Germany pavilion.

829
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:40,940
And let me bring her, here we go.

830
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:42,020
Hi Yvonne, how are you?

831
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:42,860
I'm fine, thanks.

832
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:43,900
How long have you worked here for?

833
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:45,260
I've worked here for six weeks now.

834
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:46,100
And where are you from?

835
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,660
I'm from Hamburg, Germany.

836
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:49,020
I'm from Hot Dog America.

837
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:50,460
Oh yeah?

838
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:52,500
So here we have a nutcracker.

839
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,740
And you can open it here.

840
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:56,820
You can put your finger in there.

841
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:57,660
And lose a joint.

842
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:58,780
Okay, that's good.

843
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:00,300
Why does Santa have sticks in his hand?

844
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:02,980
Because if you're a bad boy, he would,

845
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:06,220
wimp you, at Christmas.

846
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:07,980
It's kind of a cheery holiday tradition.

847
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:09,740
And of course we have a lot of glass ornaments,

848
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:10,700
like the one here.

849
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:12,460
All right, what do you call Santa Claus in Germany?

850
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:13,740
We call him Weihnachtsmann.

851
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:15,180
All right, and what do you call this guy?

852
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:17,300
Scott, but he's really cute.

853
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:21,780
Was that a, what?

854
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:24,020
Yeah, did we hear that?

855
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:24,980
Did we hear that?

856
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:25,980
Whoa.

857
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:27,780
Was that a boing sound effect?

858
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:28,620
Yep.

859
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:32,660
We have a boing.

860
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:33,500
That guy,

861
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:37,620
Scott got a boner.

862
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:41,060
I guess he did.

863
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:43,500
And I guess, I guess do we blame

864
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,660
some sound effects of department?

865
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:48,540
Or did Scott have a boner?

866
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:50,500
That was loud.

867
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:54,740
And made that sound, it was picked up on the microphone.

868
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:56,980
Scott has an extra springy boner.

869
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:00,940
Fun facts, that Scott is now

870
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:04,580
Secretary of the Interior in the Trump administration.

871
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:11,660
And you can hear it when he gets a boner from down the hall.

872
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:12,500
Yeah.

873
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:16,380
So it's still loud is what I'm saying.

874
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:21,660
Okay, so is that the last appearance of him in that special?

875
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:23,260
No, he's throughout.

876
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:27,820
He takes you on a tour of, he goes on Body Wars.

877
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:29,340
Oh no.

878
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:31,420
Body Wars, which was an Epcot attraction

879
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:32,980
where you get shrunk down and you go through

880
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:34,380
like the human bloodstream.

881
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:36,860
And they're trying to find a way to make that Christmas,

882
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:40,180
I guess, because blood is red.

883
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:42,740
And he like says like, oh, I think I just missed my,

884
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:46,260
you know, a little bit of an errant Thanksgiving stuffing.

885
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:47,940
Or some shit like that.

886
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:49,020
I don't like.

887
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:49,940
That's rough.

888
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:51,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

889
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:53,060
Do we know who he is?

890
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:55,020
Was he a host of any kind at the time?

891
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:56,780
Does anybody recognize him?

892
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:57,620
No, nobody.

893
00:38:57,620 --> 00:39:00,380
Is anyone in his employee now?

894
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:02,020
Is Scott here?

895
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:05,700
If Scott, if you're here, you know what to do.

896
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:10,700
Let's all be very quiet for one minute.

897
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:20,900
Okay, he's not within a 10 mile radius.

898
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:24,740
Oh my God.

899
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:26,540
We got to figure out where Scott is too.

900
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:27,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

901
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:29,780
Well, we can delve into, well, we have to do

902
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:31,820
the Scott era of Disney World Inside Out

903
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:34,460
and then the George Foreman era of Disney World.

904
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:37,340
The show, this was a monthly show taking you

905
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:38,620
behind the scenes of Disney World

906
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:41,100
that was eventually hosted by George Foreman.

907
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:43,740
The strangest things ever.

908
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:45,540
That's cool though.

909
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:46,860
Yeah, yeah.

910
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:48,020
He was excellent.

911
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:50,460
Better than Scott, but a much quieter boner.

912
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:53,780
Well, yeah, when you're a boxer,

913
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:55,540
you got to do everything quick and.

914
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:57,780
You don't want to give them a warning.

915
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:59,300
You're about to get a boner.

916
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:02,500
You remember that scene in Rocky

917
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:03,900
where Mick is telling Rocky

918
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,740
to not let them hear your boner?

919
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:08,740
Don't let them hear your boner, kid.

920
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:10,500
Don't let them hear your boner.

921
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,140
You got to put socks over that thing.

922
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:12,980
Muffle it.

923
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:16,940
Dampen the sound, Rock.

924
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:20,940
My hands don't scan.

925
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:29,340
You got to make your voices different, Scott.

926
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:30,180
You got to push them.

927
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:31,700
I wasn't critiquing you.

928
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:33,420
My voice was the same voice.

929
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:37,300
And it's just a hair away from.

930
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:39,220
Don't do inhalants.

931
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:41,180
Damage your brain.

932
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:42,460
Don't do inhalants.

933
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:44,660
My graph is more like this.

934
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:48,740
And then Rocket and every other character is,

935
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:50,540
hey, your hands don't scan.

936
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:53,300
Far from the shallows now.

937
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:58,020
Jackson Maine voice.

938
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:03,300
Okay, where are we going now?

939
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:06,900
Let me find the next thing.

940
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:10,180
I see you're going by phone.

941
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:12,420
Oh, here, let's do this one.

942
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:16,700
I didn't want to just represent Disney

943
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:21,300
with these specials because so many theme parks

944
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:24,100
and themed entertainment experiences

945
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:28,060
do have Christmas overlays and Christmas iterations.

946
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:30,180
And that includes this place.

947
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:31,940
Maybe I should just let this place

948
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:33,900
do the introduction for itself.

949
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:35,380
So much phone fumbling.

950
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:37,380
That was very embarrassing.

951
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:39,860
Okay, here we go.

952
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:41,580
Take over, guys.

953
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:44,180
Ho, ho, ho, mateys.

954
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:47,020
Christmas has arrived at the Pirates Voyage in Myrtle Beach.

955
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:49,660
Christmas at Pirates Voyage Dinner and Show,

956
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:52,820
the most fun place to eat in Myrtle Beach.

957
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:55,860
Enjoy a holiday feast to warm your hearts.

958
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:58,220
Travel through time with Captain Scrooge

959
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:00,060
and the mystical spirit of Christmas.

960
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:02,820
It's a spiritual journey filled with...

961
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:04,100
Here's the Nativity.

962
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:07,100
Celebrating the real meaning of Christmas.

963
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:09,100
Pirates Voyage Dinner and Show.

964
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:12,780
Yeah.

965
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,100
Wow.

966
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:14,940
Love that.

967
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:16,900
Pirates Dinner Adventure spends

968
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:19,020
all their budget at Christmas.

969
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:20,300
I think so, I think so.

970
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:22,140
Well, keep in mind, this is the Myrtle Beach one.

971
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:23,780
This is not the one we experienced,

972
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:26,180
which does seem like it's a pretty huge scope.

973
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:29,660
Like I've watched more clips of their Nativity scene

974
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:31,580
and it's like full line.

975
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:33,460
It's like every barnyard animal,

976
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:35,580
there's a big Noah's Ark procession.

977
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:37,180
Like there's two of every kind.

978
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:39,460
I have to think all the like dinner shows

979
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:42,700
and Branson and like Myrtle Beach are just like,

980
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:44,580
once it becomes Christmas time, they're like,

981
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:46,900
yes, time to cash it in.

982
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:48,780
Time to get baby Jesus up there.

983
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:50,340
I got the camels in here.

984
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:55,900
So the pirate ship transforms into Noah's Ark.

985
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:56,740
Well, Captain Scrooge.

986
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:57,580
Is that what it is?

987
00:42:57,580 --> 00:42:58,420
Well, that's what you just described, right?

988
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:00,060
I mean, I didn't mean literally Noah's Ark.

989
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:02,220
I just mean there are so many animals

990
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:04,540
booked for this Nativity scene every year.

991
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:06,700
But like you're saying two of each animal?

992
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:07,620
I mean, not literally.

993
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:11,340
I just mean like it is such a massive parade of animals

994
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:13,220
that all have to live in this dinner theater

995
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:14,540
in Myrtle Beach.

996
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:16,660
It sounds a lot like Noah's Ark though.

997
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:17,500
Yeah, certainly.

998
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:19,300
A big boat with a bunch of animals.

999
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:20,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1000
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:22,540
And the baby Jesus, the same story.

1001
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:27,460
They also alluded to a Captain Scrooge.

1002
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:31,100
And what appeared to be some sort of father Christmas

1003
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:33,500
like mystical creature.

1004
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:37,620
Set sail with Captain Scrooge, they said.

1005
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:40,420
And then a ghostly figure appears.

1006
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:45,420
So I guess it's a Scrooge that makes Bob Cratchbeard

1007
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:50,780
work late on the ship that Christmas Eve.

1008
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:53,660
And then various ghosts visit him

1009
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:55,780
and show him journeys past.

1010
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:58,580
Tiny Tim is ill, he went in the elevator,

1011
00:43:58,580 --> 00:44:00,660
he reaches Philbin went in and.

1012
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:05,660
And this is the same Pirates Dinner Adventure

1013
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:08,420
that's in Buena Park.

1014
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:09,540
Or it's a different pirate show.

1015
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:11,260
I'm not sure, they may be affiliated.

1016
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:12,100
I don't know the ownership.

1017
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:14,700
Cause there are Sister Pirates Dinner Adventures

1018
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:16,140
in Orlando, I guess it's Orlando.

1019
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:16,980
I think it's Orlando.

1020
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:17,820
I think this is a.

1021
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:18,640
Can anybody back me up?

1022
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:19,740
There's Pirates Dinner Adventure Orlando

1023
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:21,020
and then in Buena Park.

1024
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:24,420
So this is a separate Pirate Dinner Adventure.

1025
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:26,100
And.

1026
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:28,100
Does Mundy know?

1027
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:30,700
Do you know the ownership rights of the various pirates?

1028
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:33,140
What?

1029
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:33,980
Yeah.

1030
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:36,660
Busy scrolling.

1031
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:38,900
You know guys, if you think about it,

1032
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:41,620
Jesus was kind of the biggest pirate of them all.

1033
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:44,140
He walked on water, you know?

1034
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:47,380
He threw the money lenders out of the temple.

1035
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:52,380
He said, if you authority to like the Romans.

1036
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:53,420
Keep going.

1037
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:57,460
He loved that wine.

1038
00:44:58,580 --> 00:45:00,740
And like pirates, he ate fish.

1039
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:03,820
He has long hair like Jack Sparrow.

1040
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:05,020
He has long hair.

1041
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:08,420
Is that we have to figure out,

1042
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:12,700
in Buena Park they do do a specific Christmas pirate show.

1043
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:13,540
I know they do that.

1044
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:16,180
I just wonder if it's as hardcore as this looks like.

1045
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:18,340
Let's all go right now.

1046
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:19,940
Let's catch the 10.30.

1047
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:21,260
But it's probably not pirates.

1048
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:25,220
It's probably the naughty show, Teatro Martini.

1049
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:27,060
Which is the real name of the bawdy show

1050
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:28,660
they do down at the Pirates Dinner Adventure.

1051
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:29,500
Has anyone seen that?

1052
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:30,780
I have not.

1053
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:31,620
Woo.

1054
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:36,860
I have to imagine though, there's no seals.

1055
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:39,740
I feel like the Buena Park seals would be sickly.

1056
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:45,060
One thing to explain to the listener at home

1057
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:46,620
is that what was happening there,

1058
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:49,460
the narration says discover the real meaning of Christmas.

1059
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:54,020
And then a baby Christ is held up high by Mary and Joseph.

1060
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:56,300
And then pretty quick after it cuts to a seal,

1061
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:57,940
catching a wreath around its neck.

1062
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:03,780
The reason for the season.

1063
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:10,180
That has to be illegal in California, right?

1064
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:12,620
In Myrtle Beach, it's like a lawless place still.

1065
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:13,460
Yeah.

1066
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:16,020
You can do whatever you want, but in Buena Park.

1067
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:19,260
You can do like, they'll do plastic rings here,

1068
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:20,380
but you can't do a wreath.

1069
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:22,300
It scratches up the seal's neck.

1070
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:23,940
Oh, so the seal isn't the problem.

1071
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:24,820
I know.

1072
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:26,540
They'll still do seal stuff.

1073
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:29,180
If it's a soft thing, it's a soft hoop.

1074
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:31,620
Yeah, you can throw it at a seal during a dinner show.

1075
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:32,580
You just need padding.

1076
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:33,100
Yes.

1077
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:33,740
OK.

1078
00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:35,340
Myrtle Beach just has too many.

1079
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:38,060
So they roll right into the Christmas rush

1080
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:43,940
into the seal culling rush down in South Carolina.

1081
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:45,300
That's a real bummer.

1082
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:47,260
Yeah.

1083
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:48,500
I don't know.

1084
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:51,500
I think I just remembered who is the owner of that Pirates

1085
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:54,300
Theater, and I think it's Dolly Parton.

1086
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:55,100
I believe this.

1087
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:56,100
I think it is related to.

1088
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:58,180
She does have a Pirates Intervention.

1089
00:46:58,180 --> 00:46:59,900
I mean, maybe that's hers.

1090
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:00,820
That's probably it.

1091
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:03,540
Yeah, I think her company was buying up

1092
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:07,620
a lot of the theaters that were having trouble.

1093
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:09,140
What do they know?

1094
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:12,140
Why are they buying all the seals?

1095
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:16,740
So Dolly Parton owns the IP Captain Scrooge.

1096
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:18,100
Yeah.

1097
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:22,180
So she's making these Netflix movies.

1098
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:26,420
There could be a Captain Scrooge Netflix movie.

1099
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:31,260
And they do need three ghosts.

1100
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:36,260
So they need three actors of varying heights

1101
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:40,260
to play the different ghosts.

1102
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:40,820
I call it.

1103
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:43,060
Well, no, Jason calls Marley.

1104
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:43,900
Oh, he's Marley.

1105
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:46,860
Oh, no, Marley's not one of the three.

1106
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:49,260
That's going to be Monday.

1107
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:49,780
In.

1108
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:51,740
Do you have any more Kathy Leigh clips?

1109
00:47:51,740 --> 00:47:59,620
Calling out a request for Kathy Leigh.

1110
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:01,780
He has not been the same since she left the fourth hour

1111
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:04,420
of the Today Show.

1112
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:05,980
He loved that fourth hour.

1113
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:07,460
Is she just retired?

1114
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:07,940
Yeah.

1115
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:09,740
Well, I don't know.

1116
00:48:09,740 --> 00:48:10,660
She's taking a break.

1117
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:12,700
That seemed like her and Hoda seemed like they're

1118
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:14,340
having so much fun every day.

1119
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:16,820
Yeah, but sometimes you just got to take a step away.

1120
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:18,940
Honestly, it's healthy.

1121
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:20,220
She made a movie.

1122
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:24,980
Kathy Leigh made a movie with Craig Ferguson.

1123
00:48:24,980 --> 00:48:29,020
Well, Craig Ferguson and Kathy Leigh, two powerhouses

1124
00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:32,780
together for the first time.

1125
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:34,700
Is it out?

1126
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:35,260
It's not out.

1127
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:38,220
Is it coming out?

1128
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:41,180
Is it a Hallmark movie?

1129
00:48:41,180 --> 00:48:43,660
We're grilling you.

1130
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:45,900
We appreciate the knowledge.

1131
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:47,940
That's more than we needed.

1132
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:49,140
Plenty of information.

1133
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:49,540
Yes.

1134
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:50,220
Yeah.

1135
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:51,500
You don't need to know that.

1136
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:52,660
Second gate coming.

1137
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:54,260
Yeah.

1138
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:55,660
Great.

1139
00:48:55,660 --> 00:49:02,740
I like to imagine the poster said like Ferguson, Lee Gifford,

1140
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:06,940
and those big metallic letters at the top.

1141
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:11,100
For some people, those are better than the expendables.

1142
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:12,860
Yes.

1143
00:49:12,860 --> 00:49:15,140
Those are my expendables.

1144
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:18,500
So let me go elsewhere in themed entertainment worlds.

1145
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:26,100
This is our last official show of 2019.

1146
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:27,860
And we're reflecting a little bit

1147
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:30,780
on some of the fun we've had through the year.

1148
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:34,300
And one of my favorite episodes of the year

1149
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:37,380
was talking about Chuck E. Cheese with Jamie Loftus.

1150
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:38,500
That was a ton of fun.

1151
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:41,420
Thank you.

1152
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:43,580
And Mike, what you brought to the table in that one

1153
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:46,220
is that some of the newer Chuck E. Cheese music

1154
00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:47,820
is really fantastic.

1155
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:49,780
If I may say, really quickly, yesterday

1156
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:52,900
was Pasquale's birthday.

1157
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:54,900
That is not a lie.

1158
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:58,500
I'm on the Facebook, the Chuck E. Cheese Facebook fan group.

1159
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:02,420
And there was a big graphic that said, happy birthday, Pasquale.

1160
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:05,940
So just keep them in your hearts today,

1161
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:07,100
because it's a birthday week.

1162
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:12,580
And we all love Pasquale P. Pie Plates, his full name.

1163
00:50:12,580 --> 00:50:15,540
December 12th.

1164
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:18,500
December 12th, Pasquale P. Pie Plates.

1165
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:20,420
Is there a code there?

1166
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:23,220
That's 1212.

1167
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:24,660
I see what you're saying.

1168
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:27,100
Is that something, a little Easter egg

1169
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:29,500
that the creator put in?

1170
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:30,540
Yeah.

1171
00:50:30,540 --> 00:50:32,740
Does that look like pizza cutting tools

1172
00:50:32,740 --> 00:50:34,220
if you lay the number?

1173
00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:34,820
I'm stretching.

1174
00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:37,180
I'm trying to figure it out.

1175
00:50:37,180 --> 00:50:40,740
Let's just say that, yes, if you draw 12 right,

1176
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:44,780
it looks like pizza cutting tools.

1177
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:46,140
So I think that's what it is.

1178
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:47,940
Nailed it.

1179
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:49,540
I knew it.

1180
00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:52,460
So anyway, the point is, we found some of the newer

1181
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:53,500
Chuck E. Music.

1182
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:56,940
And there is a newer Chuck E. Christmas song.

1183
00:50:56,940 --> 00:51:00,380
And I'm going to play just the end of it for you.

1184
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:02,780
You can watch a full music video of this on YouTube

1185
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:05,020
as sung by the puppet Chuck E. Cheese.

1186
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:08,940
And we should say, RIP the robots, I guess, this year.

1187
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:10,100
That's a thing.

1188
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:13,420
Our personal in memoriam for 2019 is just those robots,

1189
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:15,780
and who cares about anyone else?

1190
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:17,540
Five sad souls.

1191
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:18,340
Yeah.

1192
00:51:18,340 --> 00:51:20,580
They've replaced, like they're replacing all the robots

1193
00:51:20,580 --> 00:51:21,980
with a screen, right?

1194
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:23,460
Boo.

1195
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:25,100
Boo.

1196
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:26,420
Yeah.

1197
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:27,580
I don't like our screens.

1198
00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:28,500
Robots are what you think.

1199
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:29,660
The angriest the audience has been

1200
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:32,500
is when I mentioned a screen.

1201
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:34,980
Yeah.

1202
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:35,500
What for?

1203
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:36,180
Fuck screens.

1204
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:36,660
Yeah.

1205
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:38,980
Fuck screens.

1206
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:42,940
That's a good rallying cry for our audience.

1207
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:44,500
Yeah, so that sucks.

1208
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:45,020
It's a barn.

1209
00:51:45,020 --> 00:51:45,860
We do have to look in.

1210
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:47,700
None of us, I don't think, have enough money

1211
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:49,620
to start buying up robots.

1212
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:51,260
But not expendable robot money, no.

1213
00:51:51,260 --> 00:51:52,420
We'd like to.

1214
00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:52,940
Yeah.

1215
00:51:52,940 --> 00:51:53,660
Yeah.

1216
00:51:53,660 --> 00:51:55,500
Yeah.

1217
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:56,260
We shall try.

1218
00:51:56,260 --> 00:51:58,380
We'll try in the coming year.

1219
00:51:58,380 --> 00:52:00,380
So these guys, I mean, these guys

1220
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:03,020
will be up for auction soon enough

1221
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:05,060
that we can get these specific robots.

1222
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:08,660
I want to give credit to the, so these are robots

1223
00:52:08,660 --> 00:52:10,100
being filmed.

1224
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:12,060
And all of the cuts and edit decisions

1225
00:52:12,060 --> 00:52:13,620
are from the YouTube user.

1226
00:52:13,620 --> 00:52:15,620
And I give him credit for it.

1227
00:52:15,620 --> 00:52:16,380
This is really nice.

1228
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:19,340
And it has a little bit of a wonderful Christmas time vibe,

1229
00:52:19,340 --> 00:52:20,300
I think you'll find.

1230
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:20,780
Here we go.

1231
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:26,180
["Christmas Time"]

1232
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:29,660
And now it's here.

1233
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:31,740
Christmas time has come again.

1234
00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:35,700
Friends are near.

1235
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:38,180
And that is all we need.

1236
00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:47,180
To celebrate this special time when we can come together.

1237
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:52,140
Wishing for you joy, love, peace, and harmony.

1238
00:52:52,140 --> 00:52:57,140
And we'll have a very merry Christmas.

1239
00:52:57,140 --> 00:53:00,140
Yes, we're ready.

1240
00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:05,140
Merry Christmas, yes, we'll have APP Merry Christmas time.

1241
00:53:06,140 --> 00:53:10,420
And we'll have a very merry Christmass.

1242
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:15,420
Yes, we'll have a merry Christmas time.

1243
00:53:17,140 --> 00:53:21,820
Merry Christmas time.

1244
00:53:21,820 --> 00:53:25,060
Merry Christmas time.

1245
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:27,380
Merry Christmas, Helen.

1246
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:28,780
Merry Christmas, Chuckie.

1247
00:53:31,180 --> 00:53:32,380
Wow, yeah.

1248
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:36,020
Give it up for that one.

1249
00:53:36,020 --> 00:53:38,100
Listeners at home, somewhat the audience is responding to.

1250
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:41,060
We'll post the video, but

1251
00:53:41,060 --> 00:53:43,620
first of all, at one point, some random kids just ran by.

1252
00:53:44,780 --> 00:53:48,140
They couldn't shoot it when the restaurant wasn't open.

1253
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:51,940
Well, I think this is a guy just going in and filming.

1254
00:53:51,940 --> 00:53:53,540
Oh, this wasn't. Oh.

1255
00:53:53,540 --> 00:53:54,740
Officially produced video.

1256
00:53:54,740 --> 00:53:57,900
No, no, no. This is a fan film.

1257
00:53:58,180 --> 00:54:02,980
Yeah, that had higher production values than some streaming shows.

1258
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:07,900
That's what I got confused because there's a they post on the Chuckie

1259
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:12,700
Cheese YouTube so much content like songs, new stuff, well produced things,

1260
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:16,220
puppet version, like little sketches and stuff and songs.

1261
00:54:16,220 --> 00:54:18,940
So I just assume that was just a little thing they put up there

1262
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:21,060
because they love to make.

1263
00:54:21,060 --> 00:54:23,340
There's a separate music video that is better produced.

1264
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:26,500
And this one is just like also some of what we were liking there

1265
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:29,300
is that just a ghostly Helen, the bird

1266
00:54:29,860 --> 00:54:33,420
appeared in the corner of the lower corners of the frame

1267
00:54:33,660 --> 00:54:36,260
in sort of a like

1268
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:40,820
Natalie Cole, Nat King Cole, like as if it was a posthumous duet.

1269
00:54:44,980 --> 00:54:48,500
I guess in my version of this, Helen has passed away.

1270
00:54:49,340 --> 00:54:56,420
Is it possible that Helen in this restaurant had been removed already?

1271
00:54:56,660 --> 00:55:00,780
Yeah. And she was singing to Chuckie from like a scrap yard somewhere.

1272
00:55:04,140 --> 00:55:06,700
They're the ones getting rid of the robots, not me.

1273
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:08,340
This is what they're doing.

1274
00:55:08,340 --> 00:55:11,580
Do you realize a little bit that sink in

1275
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:15,740
Twitter claps, some cognitive dissonance going on too,

1276
00:55:15,740 --> 00:55:20,780
because like there was a tiny screen in the corner playing the puppet versions

1277
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:24,820
of Chuckie and Ellen and then like casual puppet.

1278
00:55:24,820 --> 00:55:26,940
Chuckie was on the Christmas tree.

1279
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:30,140
So like this is reasonably recent.

1280
00:55:30,340 --> 00:55:33,220
Yeah, yeah, very recent as in Chuckie cheese.

1281
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:34,900
It's not a Chuckie cheese.

1282
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:38,060
If I can't see five different iterations of Chuckie,

1283
00:55:38,060 --> 00:55:41,100
she's sure all within one field of vision.

1284
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:43,980
That's old. Hell, it's old, like 90s Helen.

1285
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:48,020
But newer Chuck, newer Chuck with super new on the screen.

1286
00:55:48,020 --> 00:55:49,420
It's like the full Dr.

1287
00:55:49,420 --> 00:55:54,140
Manhattan being able to see your whole life at once ability.

1288
00:55:56,660 --> 00:55:58,940
Seeing all he's been and all he will be.

1289
00:56:00,740 --> 00:56:03,420
I love I by the way, I haven't seen that before.

1290
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:05,300
I loved it. It's really nice.

1291
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:07,380
Yeah, yeah, that was great.

1292
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:10,020
Yes, we'll have.

1293
00:56:10,020 --> 00:56:10,980
Yeah, those are good.

1294
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:12,180
Cheese, we said it on the episode.

1295
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:13,540
The YouTube is good.

1296
00:56:13,540 --> 00:56:16,340
Like to look at all this, the songs like there's some good songs,

1297
00:56:16,340 --> 00:56:18,900
a lot of them parodies, but like

1298
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:20,940
there's a weird one that sounds like Snoop Dogg.

1299
00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:22,940
But I love that one.

1300
00:56:22,940 --> 00:56:26,340
Another Chuckie day, you know, is another Chuckie day.

1301
00:56:27,380 --> 00:56:28,900
I like that.

1302
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:32,540
I like the me and my friends, which is a Bruno Mars, Mark Ronson riff

1303
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:35,180
where he lists all his friends.

1304
00:56:35,180 --> 00:56:37,620
And there is a dance that goes with it.

1305
00:56:37,620 --> 00:56:38,500
I don't know it.

1306
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:40,260
Don't ask me to do it.

1307
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:44,460
But if you know it's you do this and then you clap.

1308
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:47,340
So it's four quarters and then you spin.

1309
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:51,700
Oh, you just got Mayor Pete on the brain. Yeah.

1310
00:56:52,740 --> 00:56:55,300
I love his little dance.

1311
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:56,900
What is what I think?

1312
00:56:56,900 --> 00:57:00,340
Honestly, we have talked about this at the show, if it's the same dance before.

1313
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:02,700
But what if Mayor Pete went into a Chuckie cheese

1314
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:05,100
and he stole the me and my friends dance?

1315
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:08,060
And it was the scandal that sunk his campaign.

1316
00:57:08,820 --> 00:57:10,620
Happy something.

1317
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:11,780
It's possible.

1318
00:57:11,780 --> 00:57:13,580
We have to look. We have to look into it.

1319
00:57:15,460 --> 00:57:16,620
But there's if you go to the Chuck E.

1320
00:57:16,620 --> 00:57:18,780
Cheese fan page, not the official page,

1321
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:22,380
there's a couple of people that will post new versions of them

1322
00:57:22,380 --> 00:57:24,740
doing the dance weekly.

1323
00:57:25,660 --> 00:57:28,500
Oh, I don't know why everyone's making that noise.

1324
00:57:30,020 --> 00:57:32,300
I like watching it.

1325
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:35,140
And then he'll dance like this guy, all his dance with Chuckie.

1326
00:57:35,140 --> 00:57:37,100
And I love it.

1327
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:38,100
I go join it.

1328
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:40,900
You do have to answer some questions to get in the group.

1329
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:45,260
But it's nothing everyone here doesn't know, I assume.

1330
00:57:45,780 --> 00:57:47,820
The first question, are you OK?

1331
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:52,580
And oh, send.

1332
00:57:54,060 --> 00:57:55,460
Come on in.

1333
00:57:59,140 --> 00:58:02,780
But there's no one doing recreations of Helen

1334
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:07,580
just with just total mono focus during game and time, right?

1335
00:58:07,580 --> 00:58:10,660
Or she's just like, I got to play this game, like just ignoring

1336
00:58:10,660 --> 00:58:12,820
everything going on around her.

1337
00:58:12,820 --> 00:58:15,020
That's the song I like.

1338
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:18,220
I don't know.

1339
00:58:18,220 --> 00:58:18,780
I don't know.

1340
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:20,580
That's the other song.

1341
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:22,740
That was the other song we talked about gaming time.

1342
00:58:22,740 --> 00:58:24,620
It's the Taylor Swift like table.

1343
00:58:24,620 --> 00:58:26,700
Yeah, yeah, it's very it's an intense.

1344
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:28,580
I forgot that that's about sorry.

1345
00:58:28,580 --> 00:58:30,220
I'm sorry. We hung out to dry there.

1346
00:58:30,220 --> 00:58:31,060
Oh, that's all right.

1347
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:33,300
I just didn't remember gaming.

1348
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:36,340
Sometimes I'm being a dick and I'm doing it on purpose, but not now.

1349
00:58:36,460 --> 00:58:37,420
I know. I know.

1350
00:58:37,420 --> 00:58:40,500
That's the one the running joke in it is like Munch is like,

1351
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:41,900
I'm going to eat your pizza, Helen.

1352
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:44,220
And Chuck is like, knock that shit off.

1353
00:58:45,860 --> 00:58:48,620
Don't eat her pizza, man.

1354
00:58:48,620 --> 00:58:49,540
So, yeah, that's right.

1355
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:52,620
So the song is she is just very excited about gaming.

1356
00:58:52,660 --> 00:58:55,340
Yeah, that is that song is pretty good as well.

1357
00:58:55,340 --> 00:58:58,180
That album is available, I think, for free on the Chuck E.

1358
00:58:58,180 --> 00:59:00,180
Cheese website. It is. Yeah. Yeah.

1359
00:59:00,180 --> 00:59:02,540
So very good. Very good.

1360
00:59:04,420 --> 00:59:07,340
You all have a lot of homework now.

1361
00:59:07,340 --> 00:59:10,380
Yeah. And it's our break over the break, though.

1362
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:13,980
So and everybody have a dance video ready to go to show us.

1363
00:59:14,940 --> 00:59:17,180
We do need to make a Mayor Jason dance, though.

1364
00:59:17,580 --> 00:59:20,260
Oh, good idea.

1365
00:59:21,660 --> 00:59:23,500
Yeah, yeah.

1366
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:26,460
We'll be workshopping that and I'll be ready in January. Yeah.

1367
00:59:26,780 --> 00:59:31,100
OK, as I'm talking about other episodes I've really enjoyed

1368
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:34,620
through the year, another another favorite of mine was talking about

1369
00:59:34,620 --> 00:59:36,580
a place called Dogpatch USA.

1370
00:59:38,260 --> 00:59:40,580
And thank you. Thanks.

1371
00:59:40,580 --> 00:59:42,260
That was a lot of fun.

1372
00:59:42,260 --> 00:59:44,460
Chris Cantwell joined us, who went there as a child.

1373
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:48,980
It is now this strange, dilapidated park in Arkansas

1374
00:59:49,140 --> 00:59:53,940
that's been through a number of owners, including most recently

1375
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:59,700
a right wing patriot con artist, allegedly

1376
01:00:00,580 --> 01:00:03,020
named David Hare.

1377
01:00:03,020 --> 01:00:06,460
And I was hoping, praying that there would be some connection

1378
01:00:06,460 --> 01:00:09,700
between Dogpatch and David Hare and Christmas.

1379
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:12,620
And what I found is that this man who you're about to see,

1380
01:00:12,620 --> 01:00:19,900
this is video from 1990 of a future failed theme park impresario.

1381
01:00:20,380 --> 01:00:25,900
This is a original musical that he wrote and produced and performed.

1382
01:00:26,620 --> 01:00:27,980
It's just a taste of it.

1383
01:00:27,980 --> 01:00:32,380
And then with the power of editing, it is going to flash forward

1384
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:36,700
to the David Hare that we know via

1385
01:00:37,940 --> 01:00:40,300
Dogpatch USA YouTube videos today.

1386
01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:45,380
So we're going to time travel real fast from 1990 to 2018.

1387
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:47,820
And here we go.

1388
01:00:50,020 --> 01:00:52,620
Christmas is here. It's the time of the year.

1389
01:00:52,620 --> 01:00:55,900
The jingle bells ring out, the carolers sing out.

1390
01:00:56,140 --> 01:01:00,900
Good cheer is about when Christmas is here.

1391
01:01:01,380 --> 01:01:04,900
So spread a little laughter with some good old Christmas joy.

1392
01:01:05,220 --> 01:01:08,060
Mix it all together for every girl and boy.

1393
01:01:08,140 --> 01:01:10,020
It's a special time of year.

1394
01:01:10,020 --> 01:01:11,860
So families draw near.

1395
01:01:11,860 --> 01:01:15,820
Gather together as Christmas is here.

1396
01:01:15,940 --> 01:01:21,100
You know, somebody buried the pool at the hotel,

1397
01:01:21,420 --> 01:01:24,300
and we're going to get that back up and running.

1398
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:26,780
I don't know exactly when at this point.

1399
01:01:26,780 --> 01:01:31,220
It's not at the top of our list, meaning in the immediate, immediate, immediate,

1400
01:01:31,220 --> 01:01:35,220
as in people start asking me when it's not in that scope.

1401
01:01:35,220 --> 01:01:37,700
It is in the next few months. I don't know.

1402
01:01:37,980 --> 01:01:40,060
It's coming up. We're going to get it done.

1403
01:01:40,340 --> 01:01:41,900
But I'm not going to give any announcement

1404
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:44,180
because I'm not ready to answer questions about it.

1405
01:01:45,820 --> 01:01:55,820
OK, is Christmas here?

1406
01:01:55,900 --> 01:01:57,380
I'm not ready to answer that yet.

1407
01:01:57,380 --> 01:01:59,540
I'm not I'm not prepared to answer that at this time.

1408
01:01:59,620 --> 01:02:01,580
So stop asking me. I do believe Christmas is coming.

1409
01:02:01,660 --> 01:02:02,660
I think we'll be here soon enough.

1410
01:02:02,660 --> 01:02:04,540
Will it be December 25th? I can't promise you that.

1411
01:02:04,540 --> 01:02:08,140
I don't know. I just I just don't know.

1412
01:02:10,980 --> 01:02:13,420
God bless this man. Oh, my God.

1413
01:02:14,420 --> 01:02:17,420
Who would have thought this man would go on to own a property

1414
01:02:17,420 --> 01:02:20,260
you can only call Dogpatch Fury Road?

1415
01:02:24,780 --> 01:02:26,580
This setup he has here

1416
01:02:28,380 --> 01:02:31,060
is so interesting to me.

1417
01:02:31,060 --> 01:02:33,420
He has his characters.

1418
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:36,380
Well, what's the what's the first of all down in Dogpatch?

1419
01:02:36,380 --> 01:02:38,740
Do we remember the song?

1420
01:02:38,740 --> 01:02:39,940
From the episode?

1421
01:02:39,940 --> 01:02:43,060
No, it's my sister, I think, texted me after that episode

1422
01:02:43,060 --> 01:02:45,620
and was like, that song is a jam or something like she

1423
01:02:46,460 --> 01:02:49,180
like a legit a bob a bob.

1424
01:02:49,180 --> 01:02:50,580
Did you say Bob?

1425
01:02:51,340 --> 01:02:53,460
That's a term Jason and kids use.

1426
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:58,100
But I mean, this is like he's got his memorabilia here.

1427
01:02:58,100 --> 01:03:01,060
So he is trying to sort of like make it like whimsical.

1428
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:05,220
He's in front of like a picture of himself working on a green screen

1429
01:03:06,580 --> 01:03:11,660
and then a big mug of WC Fields and a Diet Coke.

1430
01:03:12,660 --> 01:03:15,460
And there's a cannon right behind him.

1431
01:03:16,140 --> 01:03:18,780
Oh, yeah, an old timey.

1432
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:19,900
Hmm. Hmm.

1433
01:03:21,100 --> 01:03:23,740
An interesting man.

1434
01:03:23,740 --> 01:03:26,820
Go down the dog patch rabbit hole if you get the chance.

1435
01:03:27,260 --> 01:03:30,260
It's delay is that whole first part of the special online.

1436
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:33,340
Yes, you can watch all of Christmas is here.

1437
01:03:33,980 --> 01:03:39,420
If you're curious, spoiler, a fifties car rolls on stage

1438
01:03:40,220 --> 01:03:43,140
and some greasers sing Jingle Bell Rock.

1439
01:03:44,780 --> 01:03:47,540
So you have that ahead of you.

1440
01:03:48,540 --> 01:03:49,940
I'm coming to the end of video.

1441
01:03:49,940 --> 01:03:52,980
Should I close out my videos or should you are like,

1442
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:56,340
do you have one more, the one more we were going to end with left?

1443
01:03:56,660 --> 01:03:58,780
And there's one there's one for that.

1444
01:03:58,780 --> 01:04:01,220
Yeah, OK, OK, I'll get to this quickly.

1445
01:04:01,220 --> 01:04:02,380
This is OK.

1446
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:05,500
This is a little bit theme park tangential, but I could not resist

1447
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:07,940
showing this to an audience because it is related to Christmas

1448
01:04:07,940 --> 01:04:09,780
and it's related to animation.

1449
01:04:09,780 --> 01:04:14,100
How many people like and enjoy the rank and bass holiday specials?

1450
01:04:15,100 --> 01:04:18,980
Yes. Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer and Frosty the Snowman.

1451
01:04:19,980 --> 01:04:22,140
So, you know, the 2D animation and clay mission.

1452
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:24,820
A friend of mine, Brian Rowe,

1453
01:04:24,820 --> 01:04:27,900
got a box set of the rank and bass holiday specials,

1454
01:04:27,900 --> 01:04:29,260
and it's the ones that we know.

1455
01:04:29,260 --> 01:04:32,980
And then there's one that I didn't know called that was referred to as a lost

1456
01:04:32,980 --> 01:04:34,580
Christmas classic.

1457
01:04:34,580 --> 01:04:37,380
And this is something called Cricket on the Hearth.

1458
01:04:37,620 --> 01:04:39,540
Is anyone familiar with Cricket on the Hearth?

1459
01:04:41,380 --> 01:04:45,860
Aaron Gardner is just a good to see you.

1460
01:04:49,180 --> 01:04:52,700
A favorite around the Gardner home, and I'm so we get to share it now.

1461
01:04:52,700 --> 01:04:54,580
This is really exciting.

1462
01:04:54,580 --> 01:04:56,700
I'm more of a turkey in the straw, man.

1463
01:05:01,340 --> 01:05:03,660
Your favorite song, favorite song.

1464
01:05:03,660 --> 01:05:06,340
I will say that Cricket on the Hearth is old timey because it is based

1465
01:05:06,340 --> 01:05:10,700
on a Charles Dickens novel that is much, much less popular than his other

1466
01:05:10,700 --> 01:05:12,580
Christmas carol.

1467
01:05:15,460 --> 01:05:18,740
I'd say Cricket on the Hearth comes in at a distant two.

1468
01:05:21,340 --> 01:05:24,220
Stuff competition, very tough competition.

1469
01:05:24,220 --> 01:05:27,580
So this, yes, as I said, this is released on DVD and it's called

1470
01:05:27,580 --> 01:05:28,900
a lost holiday classic.

1471
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:32,980
And I think the reason it was lost is because of massive animation errors.

1472
01:05:33,980 --> 01:05:37,300
I will give you an example of that right now.

1473
01:05:40,020 --> 01:05:41,940
A gasp at the design alone.

1474
01:05:41,940 --> 01:05:43,900
Wait till you see what he does.

1475
01:05:43,900 --> 01:05:46,300
I suppose you're all wondering what me a crick.

1476
01:05:46,660 --> 01:05:48,220
Oh, no, I'm sorry.

1477
01:05:48,220 --> 01:05:49,380
Go back. OK, here we go.

1478
01:05:49,380 --> 01:05:53,580
I suppose you're all wondering what me, a cricket is doing here on Christmas

1479
01:05:53,580 --> 01:05:56,780
Eve with a home of me own.

1480
01:05:56,780 --> 01:06:00,060
See, I am a part of the family, as it were.

1481
01:06:00,580 --> 01:06:02,460
Oh, and it's a lucky household.

1482
01:06:02,460 --> 01:06:03,580
What has a cricket on the.

1483
01:06:03,580 --> 01:06:06,500
Oh, God. Indeed, I am good luck.

1484
01:06:06,780 --> 01:06:09,180
Or if it hadn't been for cricket, Crockett here,

1485
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:11,500
why, there wouldn't be no blinking family.

1486
01:06:12,140 --> 01:06:13,820
I'll tell you how it all began.

1487
01:06:13,820 --> 01:06:18,900
So it is what we're watching is an elderly cricket.

1488
01:06:20,660 --> 01:06:24,020
And he the why the audience is gasping is because

1489
01:06:24,620 --> 01:06:28,420
strangely, in an extreme close up, one eyelid lowers

1490
01:06:29,420 --> 01:06:32,900
for like three full seconds, then opens back up.

1491
01:06:32,900 --> 01:06:35,740
Then the other eyelid lowers for three full seconds.

1492
01:06:35,980 --> 01:06:39,740
You know, the way living beings do, we see it all the time.

1493
01:06:41,380 --> 01:06:45,660
So that's one reason the cricket on the hearth doesn't stick around

1494
01:06:45,660 --> 01:06:47,100
to holiday after holiday.

1495
01:06:47,100 --> 01:06:49,420
But I think I know the biggest one.

1496
01:06:49,820 --> 01:06:52,420
And and it is this clip.

1497
01:06:52,460 --> 01:06:57,940
So about an hour into the thing, the cricket runs a fowl of some powerful people.

1498
01:06:57,940 --> 01:07:00,020
And they want him gone.

1499
01:07:00,020 --> 01:07:02,300
So a group is enlisted.

1500
01:07:02,580 --> 01:07:09,220
And the group consists of a dog, a monkey and a crow.

1501
01:07:09,820 --> 01:07:13,660
And these are they're almost like, I guess they're like bounty hunters in a way.

1502
01:07:14,580 --> 01:07:17,500
And they are going to round up this cricket and then they're going to

1503
01:07:17,780 --> 01:07:19,500
they're going to get a reward for it.

1504
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:22,020
And that's all the setup you need to know.

1505
01:07:22,020 --> 01:07:22,820
Here's this.

1506
01:07:28,820 --> 01:07:31,820
Hello.

1507
01:07:45,820 --> 01:07:47,540
Now, where's our pay?

1508
01:07:48,100 --> 01:07:50,980
I've got your pay off right here.

1509
01:07:50,980 --> 01:07:59,380
Oh, I can tell you.

1510
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:20,580
That's what Scrooge originally did to the ghosts of past, present and future.

1511
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:24,580
I've got your lesson right here.

1512
01:08:25,540 --> 01:08:26,060
Holy shit.

1513
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:28,780
It cuts to an exterior of a boat.

1514
01:08:29,060 --> 01:08:32,140
And there are huge colored gun blasts

1515
01:08:32,620 --> 01:08:38,900
implying that a human man has shot a dog, a monkey and a crow in the face.

1516
01:08:40,660 --> 01:08:44,460
I have dreamed of the day I could show that to a big group of people.

1517
01:08:45,300 --> 01:08:47,340
I was fun.

1518
01:08:50,980 --> 01:08:54,940
I don't know what to say.

1519
01:08:55,180 --> 01:08:57,940
Yeah, I don't have a witty retort.

1520
01:08:57,980 --> 01:08:58,780
I have nothing.

1521
01:08:58,780 --> 01:09:00,860
No observations will make it right.

1522
01:09:00,860 --> 01:09:02,820
We'll make it easier to swallow.

1523
01:09:02,820 --> 01:09:04,500
Did you see that when you were a kid?

1524
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:05,220
No, no, no.

1525
01:09:05,220 --> 01:09:09,580
No, I like like 10 years ago and we watch it every single Christmas.

1526
01:09:10,260 --> 01:09:13,500
So much of it is so dreadfully boring.

1527
01:09:13,740 --> 01:09:16,580
And there's a part with like I didn't even want to punish the audience

1528
01:09:16,580 --> 01:09:19,780
by showing you the Mae West esque sexy cat.

1529
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:22,300
Good.

1530
01:09:22,300 --> 01:09:23,020
What's the hell?

1531
01:09:23,020 --> 01:09:25,220
Truly scarring.

1532
01:09:25,900 --> 01:09:26,980
Incredibly scarred.

1533
01:09:26,980 --> 01:09:29,140
So you got to like fast forward, fast forward, fast forward.

1534
01:09:29,220 --> 01:09:29,620
Oh, good.

1535
01:09:29,620 --> 01:09:32,140
Now here's the part where the man shoots the monkey in the face.

1536
01:09:33,860 --> 01:09:36,620
That's worse than the Bambi scene.

1537
01:09:36,940 --> 01:09:37,980
Yes. Yeah.

1538
01:09:37,980 --> 01:09:40,060
Like much worse.

1539
01:09:40,060 --> 01:09:44,780
It's a good Christmas lesson about what the life of sin leads to.

1540
01:09:46,980 --> 01:09:49,060
Justice.

1541
01:09:49,860 --> 01:09:51,140
See justice.

1542
01:09:51,140 --> 01:09:53,220
See justice.

1543
01:09:53,220 --> 01:09:55,580
The fairest of them all.

1544
01:09:55,580 --> 01:09:56,900
Internet.

1545
01:09:56,900 --> 01:09:58,140
Oh, my God.

1546
01:09:58,140 --> 01:10:01,900
So if there's a cricket in your house this holiday season, leave it be.

1547
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:06,900
That's my video run.

1548
01:10:06,900 --> 01:10:08,340
Mike, take the wheel for a little bit.

1549
01:10:08,340 --> 01:10:09,100
We got a couple of things.

1550
01:10:09,100 --> 01:10:12,580
We're sort of running out of time, so I'm going to just roll through here.

1551
01:10:12,580 --> 01:10:16,540
This is just going to be a quick thing for everybody here.

1552
01:10:16,700 --> 01:10:19,700
I just want to show everyone some photos of my favorite Christmas seats.

1553
01:10:21,660 --> 01:10:24,460
No. Oh, boy.

1554
01:10:24,460 --> 01:10:26,460
This is Bugs Bunny from Six Flags.

1555
01:10:26,460 --> 01:10:28,780
Nice. And there's his seat.

1556
01:10:31,820 --> 01:10:32,740
Dang.

1557
01:10:32,740 --> 01:10:35,460
This is these are the reindeer in the Disneyland parade.

1558
01:10:36,540 --> 01:10:38,780
And there are their seats.

1559
01:10:40,260 --> 01:10:42,460
There is Reese's Pieces, man.

1560
01:10:42,780 --> 01:10:43,500
Hell, yeah.

1561
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:45,060
Peanut butter cup.

1562
01:10:45,100 --> 01:10:47,020
Here is his seat.

1563
01:11:00,260 --> 01:11:03,180
You you had to get in real close to get this shot.

1564
01:11:04,420 --> 01:11:07,100
You had to be a real pervert to get this.

1565
01:11:07,100 --> 01:11:08,220
I have to run the joke for the audience.

1566
01:11:08,220 --> 01:11:09,540
It's the rapper. It's really funny.

1567
01:11:09,540 --> 01:11:10,540
It's a very funny joke.

1568
01:11:10,540 --> 01:11:12,780
How else will they know? Thank you.

1569
01:11:12,780 --> 01:11:14,260
And then the king of them all.

1570
01:11:14,260 --> 01:11:15,260
Here he is.

1571
01:11:18,740 --> 01:11:21,020
Check out that Christmas seat, folks.

1572
01:11:25,420 --> 01:11:27,540
That's that's my segment called Christmas Seats.

1573
01:11:28,540 --> 01:11:30,500
All right. So.

1574
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:32,380
Wow. Wow.

1575
01:11:32,980 --> 01:11:35,540
I will say, though, you know, we've had a lot of fun tonight,

1576
01:11:36,620 --> 01:11:39,180
but it is a holiday time.

1577
01:11:39,180 --> 01:11:43,700
And as Jason said, some things, you know, there there is a reason for the season.

1578
01:11:44,020 --> 01:11:47,260
Yeah. You know, a very special little guy

1579
01:11:48,060 --> 01:11:50,980
that we all need to remember when it comes to Christmas time.

1580
01:11:51,020 --> 01:11:54,460
So I've made a little piece here and I just want to show it.

1581
01:11:55,700 --> 01:11:56,740
Hey, Scott, again.

1582
01:11:56,740 --> 01:12:02,460
At this point, Mike plays a video that includes many, many images of Baby Grinch.

1583
01:12:02,700 --> 01:12:06,260
And eventually Baby Grinch is interacting with me, Scott.

1584
01:12:06,620 --> 01:12:09,860
It is obviously very horrifying and should be viewed by no one.

1585
01:12:10,020 --> 01:12:12,820
But if you want to watch it, it will be available on our Twitter at

1586
01:12:12,820 --> 01:12:16,580
podcast, the ride and using hashtag PTR SAC eclipse.

1587
01:12:28,180 --> 01:12:31,940
No, no, no.

1588
01:12:34,620 --> 01:12:36,820
These blessings are down.

1589
01:12:36,820 --> 01:12:38,620
Yes, we.

1590
01:12:39,420 --> 01:12:42,780
And the stars in the sky

1591
01:12:42,780 --> 01:12:45,580
the town on Earth, it

1592
01:12:46,540 --> 01:12:50,980
living Lord, Jesus sleep

1593
01:12:51,020 --> 01:12:52,060
on.

1594
01:12:57,820 --> 01:12:58,060
Oh, oh,

1595
01:12:58,060 --> 01:13:01,220
no, no, no, no, no, no.

1596
01:13:01,220 --> 01:13:04,220
The cattle are lowing,

1597
01:13:04,220 --> 01:13:07,220
the baby of wings,

1598
01:13:07,220 --> 01:13:10,820
but live Lord Jesus.

1599
01:13:10,820 --> 01:13:12,820
How many are there?

1600
01:13:12,820 --> 01:13:17,820
I love you, Jesus.

1601
01:13:17,820 --> 01:13:21,820
I come from the sky

1602
01:13:21,820 --> 01:13:24,820
and stay by my cradle

1603
01:13:24,820 --> 01:13:27,820
till morning comes.

1604
01:13:28,820 --> 01:13:31,820
Hell yeah!

1605
01:13:34,820 --> 01:13:38,820
For lay the manger

1606
01:13:38,820 --> 01:13:41,820
the pit for a bed.

1607
01:13:41,820 --> 01:13:44,820
The little Lord Jesus

1608
01:13:44,820 --> 01:13:47,820
lay down his seat.

1609
01:13:47,820 --> 01:13:51,820
The stars in the sky

1610
01:13:51,820 --> 01:13:54,820
the town where he lay.

1611
01:13:55,820 --> 01:13:58,820
The little Lord Jesus

1612
01:13:58,820 --> 01:14:02,820
sleep on the hay.

1613
01:14:10,820 --> 01:14:11,820
All right.

1614
01:14:13,820 --> 01:14:15,820
Let's get a Randy Gerber

1615
01:14:15,820 --> 01:14:16,820
chant going.

1616
01:14:16,820 --> 01:14:20,820
Randy Gerber, Randy Gerber,

1617
01:14:20,820 --> 01:14:22,820
Randy Gerber.

1618
01:14:22,820 --> 01:14:23,820
Ladies and gentlemen,

1619
01:14:23,820 --> 01:14:24,820
let me welcome.

1620
01:14:24,820 --> 01:14:26,820
No, that's it.

1621
01:14:26,820 --> 01:14:27,820
Me and Monday are hitting the road.

1622
01:14:27,820 --> 01:14:28,820
We're fucking out of here.

1623
01:14:28,820 --> 01:14:29,820
Let's split.

1624
01:14:32,820 --> 01:14:33,820
Yeah, I can't.

1625
01:14:33,820 --> 01:14:34,820
I can't.

1626
01:14:34,820 --> 01:14:35,820
I can't.

1627
01:14:35,820 --> 01:14:38,820
So, yeah, it felt good to pretend

1628
01:14:38,820 --> 01:14:40,820
for a second and you had my back

1629
01:14:40,820 --> 01:14:41,820
and I knew you would.

1630
01:14:41,820 --> 01:14:42,820
Yeah, I want to get out of here.

1631
01:14:42,820 --> 01:14:43,820
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1632
01:14:43,820 --> 01:14:44,820
I understood.

1633
01:14:44,820 --> 01:14:45,820
All right.

1634
01:14:45,820 --> 01:14:46,820
Well, we're well, now I will

1635
01:14:46,820 --> 01:14:48,820
really swear we are wrapping it up

1636
01:14:48,820 --> 01:14:50,820
the entire podcast that is.

1637
01:14:50,820 --> 01:14:51,820
Well, look, I just there's

1638
01:14:51,820 --> 01:14:53,820
is important that we remember

1639
01:14:53,820 --> 01:14:55,820
around Christmas time.

1640
01:14:55,820 --> 01:14:58,820
It's it said reason for the season

1641
01:14:58,820 --> 01:15:00,820
and I understand the joke that

1642
01:15:00,820 --> 01:15:01,820
that's baby Grinch.

1643
01:15:01,820 --> 01:15:03,820
But then you kept adding reasons.

1644
01:15:03,820 --> 01:15:06,820
The reasons are all things I don't like.

1645
01:15:06,820 --> 01:15:07,820
I downloaded this.

1646
01:15:07,820 --> 01:15:08,820
I didn't make this.

1647
01:15:14,820 --> 01:15:15,820
Hmm, I found it.

1648
01:15:15,820 --> 01:15:16,820
Maybe that that Chuck E.

1649
01:15:16,820 --> 01:15:18,820
Cheese videographer did it or something.

1650
01:15:18,820 --> 01:15:19,820
Yeah, do it.

1651
01:15:19,820 --> 01:15:20,820
Should we watch it again?

1652
01:15:20,820 --> 01:15:21,820
Oh, yeah.

1653
01:15:24,820 --> 01:15:25,820
We have to go.

1654
01:15:25,820 --> 01:15:26,820
No, no, no.

1655
01:15:26,820 --> 01:15:28,820
The lyric I period is famously strict

1656
01:15:28,820 --> 01:15:29,820
to end times.

1657
01:15:29,820 --> 01:15:32,820
Well, we'll watch it after the show is over.

1658
01:15:32,820 --> 01:15:34,820
It's called the greatest story

1659
01:15:34,820 --> 01:15:36,820
ever told for a reason.

1660
01:15:36,820 --> 01:15:38,820
A child was born to us

1661
01:15:38,820 --> 01:15:42,820
and then two bros made a tequila company

1662
01:15:42,820 --> 01:15:44,820
and they decided to spread the wealth

1663
01:15:44,820 --> 01:15:46,820
around in a series of briefings.

1664
01:15:46,820 --> 01:15:47,820
We have heard this story.

1665
01:15:47,820 --> 01:15:48,820
We have heard this story.

1666
01:15:48,820 --> 01:15:51,820
We have heard this story a number of times.

1667
01:15:51,820 --> 01:15:53,820
We're all millionaires now.

1668
01:15:53,820 --> 01:15:54,820
Yeah.

1669
01:15:54,820 --> 01:15:55,820
Mundy, unplug his mic.

1670
01:15:55,820 --> 01:15:57,820
Unplug his microphone.

1671
01:15:57,820 --> 01:15:59,820
Um, he'll do it.

1672
01:15:59,820 --> 01:16:00,820
He will do it.

1673
01:16:00,820 --> 01:16:03,820
Do it at the end of the show.

1674
01:16:03,820 --> 01:16:06,820
We're just making Mundy clean up now.

1675
01:16:06,820 --> 01:16:09,820
I paid seven dollars for that dip.

1676
01:16:09,820 --> 01:16:14,820
So he should earn it is what I'm saying.

1677
01:16:14,820 --> 01:16:15,820
Seven dollars.

1678
01:16:15,820 --> 01:16:16,820
Who knew dip was so expensive?

1679
01:16:16,820 --> 01:16:18,820
Did it used to be seven dollars?

1680
01:16:18,820 --> 01:16:20,820
In high school when I was like 14 now.

1681
01:16:20,820 --> 01:16:22,820
What was it?

1682
01:16:22,820 --> 01:16:23,820
Three.

1683
01:16:23,820 --> 01:16:25,820
That was like 1996.

1684
01:16:25,820 --> 01:16:27,820
Boy.

1685
01:16:27,820 --> 01:16:29,820
That's why we got to vote for Biden

1686
01:16:29,820 --> 01:16:31,820
and get this country back on track.

1687
01:16:31,820 --> 01:16:33,820
We got to go backwards.

1688
01:16:33,820 --> 01:16:34,820
Back to dipping.

1689
01:16:34,820 --> 01:16:36,820
Get America dipping again.

1690
01:16:36,820 --> 01:16:38,820
Take America dip again.

1691
01:16:38,820 --> 01:16:39,820
All right.

1692
01:16:39,820 --> 01:16:40,820
Okay.

1693
01:16:40,820 --> 01:16:41,820
Okay.

1694
01:16:41,820 --> 01:16:42,820
Do you have other stuff?

1695
01:16:42,820 --> 01:16:43,820
Where are we at?

1696
01:16:43,820 --> 01:16:45,820
No, that's the most important thing

1697
01:16:45,820 --> 01:16:46,820
I could show.

1698
01:16:46,820 --> 01:16:47,820
Oh my God.

1699
01:16:47,820 --> 01:16:48,820
Thank the Lord.

1700
01:16:48,820 --> 01:16:49,820
Okay.

1701
01:16:49,820 --> 01:16:51,820
Then we're going to start winding it down.

1702
01:16:51,820 --> 01:16:56,820
But as we do, I mentioned that we did this special

1703
01:16:56,820 --> 01:16:59,820
a couple years ago where we showed old clips.

1704
01:16:59,820 --> 01:17:01,820
And those of you who've stuck with us for a while

1705
01:17:01,820 --> 01:17:02,820
and listened to this podcast for a while,

1706
01:17:02,820 --> 01:17:03,820
you might have heard it.

1707
01:17:03,820 --> 01:17:07,820
And there was this part of one of the specials

1708
01:17:07,820 --> 01:17:13,820
that we showed that was it as scarring as Baby Grinch

1709
01:17:13,820 --> 01:17:16,820
and Chuck-O, perhaps not.

1710
01:17:16,820 --> 01:17:20,820
But it was very memorable and stuck with me.

1711
01:17:20,820 --> 01:17:23,820
And that is this strange moment from an old Christmas special

1712
01:17:23,820 --> 01:17:25,820
involving Geppetto.

1713
01:17:25,820 --> 01:17:27,820
Do people remember this?

1714
01:17:27,820 --> 01:17:28,820
Okay.

1715
01:17:28,820 --> 01:17:29,820
Okay.

1716
01:17:29,820 --> 01:17:33,820
So this was a Christmas special from 1978,

1717
01:17:33,820 --> 01:17:36,820
Christmas of Walt Disney World 1978.

1718
01:17:36,820 --> 01:17:39,820
And to reacquaint, or for the first time,

1719
01:17:39,820 --> 01:17:40,820
or to, for the first time,

1720
01:17:40,820 --> 01:17:43,820
acquaint people who don't know this moment,

1721
01:17:43,820 --> 01:17:48,820
an actor named Avery Schreiber is playing Geppetto.

1722
01:17:48,820 --> 01:17:53,820
And he is very lonely at Christmas because he is not

1723
01:17:53,820 --> 01:17:56,820
with Pinocchio this year.

1724
01:17:56,820 --> 01:18:02,820
And he is airing his grievances to pets and other toys

1725
01:18:02,820 --> 01:18:07,820
and really wishing that Pinocchio could be around.

1726
01:18:07,820 --> 01:18:12,820
So here now is this classic Christmas moment.

1727
01:18:12,820 --> 01:18:17,820
Merry Christmas, you boy Pinocchio.

1728
01:18:17,820 --> 01:18:20,820
That's nice.

1729
01:18:20,820 --> 01:18:23,820
You boy Pinocchio.

1730
01:18:23,820 --> 01:18:25,820
You hear that?

1731
01:18:25,820 --> 01:18:27,820
He's still my boy.

1732
01:18:27,820 --> 01:18:28,820
Pinocchio's grown up.

1733
01:18:28,820 --> 01:18:32,820
He moved to America, but he's still my boy.

1734
01:18:33,820 --> 01:18:37,820
What a crazy wooden puppet I make.

1735
01:18:37,820 --> 01:18:41,820
What a man he has turned into.

1736
01:18:41,820 --> 01:18:46,820
I remember Pinocchio when he was a little child.

1737
01:18:46,820 --> 01:18:51,820
What a wooden head he was.

1738
01:18:51,820 --> 01:18:54,820
Every time I get a splinter at the work table here,

1739
01:18:54,820 --> 01:18:58,820
I remember the time I gave him the only spanking I ever gave him.

1740
01:18:58,820 --> 01:19:01,820
This is going to hurt me more than it's going to hurt you.

1741
01:19:01,820 --> 01:19:04,820
Boy, was I right.

1742
01:19:04,820 --> 01:19:11,820
Do you remember the time that I gave Pinocchio the first bath?

1743
01:19:11,820 --> 01:19:13,820
Oh, was he scared.

1744
01:19:13,820 --> 01:19:14,820
He was so frightened.

1745
01:19:14,820 --> 01:19:15,820
What's the water?

1746
01:19:15,820 --> 01:19:18,820
I put him in and he floats.

1747
01:19:18,820 --> 01:19:20,820
Then I couldn't get him out.

1748
01:19:20,820 --> 01:19:22,820
He gets all soaked.

1749
01:19:22,820 --> 01:19:23,820
He gets the wood inside him.

1750
01:19:23,820 --> 01:19:24,820
He gets twisted.

1751
01:19:24,820 --> 01:19:25,820
He gets warped.

1752
01:19:25,820 --> 01:19:29,820
It wasn't funny then.

1753
01:19:29,820 --> 01:19:34,820
Now we can laugh about it.

1754
01:19:34,820 --> 01:19:35,820
All right.

1755
01:19:35,820 --> 01:19:38,820
Who's seeing that for the first time?

1756
01:19:38,820 --> 01:19:39,820
Just to get a, okay, okay.

1757
01:19:39,820 --> 01:19:40,820
Oh, very good.

1758
01:19:40,820 --> 01:19:41,820
Okay, okay.

1759
01:19:41,820 --> 01:19:45,820
So that gives you the, I mean, it's like way longer than that too.

1760
01:19:45,820 --> 01:19:49,820
He monologues to no one for a long time.

1761
01:19:49,820 --> 01:19:51,820
Really long time.

1762
01:19:51,820 --> 01:19:57,820
Talks to his toys and to fish and fondly recalls spanking a wooden boy.

1763
01:19:57,820 --> 01:20:03,820
And when he got the wooden boy in a bathtub and made him swell up.

1764
01:20:03,820 --> 01:20:06,820
And it wasn't funny then.

1765
01:20:06,820 --> 01:20:09,820
It must have been terrifying then.

1766
01:20:09,820 --> 01:20:11,820
The child was in pain.

1767
01:20:11,820 --> 01:20:14,820
But it's funny now.

1768
01:20:14,820 --> 01:20:18,820
Biden told that story out of stump speech.

1769
01:20:18,820 --> 01:20:20,820
Biden.

1770
01:20:20,820 --> 01:20:25,820
What a funny wooden puppet I make.

1771
01:20:25,820 --> 01:20:30,820
And I called him corn pop and Jill said, don't call him corn pop.

1772
01:20:30,820 --> 01:20:35,820
So then I called him Pinocchio.

1773
01:20:35,820 --> 01:20:41,820
So this goes on for a while.

1774
01:20:41,820 --> 01:20:47,820
Pinocchio moved to America, of course, as we all know that's Canon and he's.

1775
01:20:47,820 --> 01:20:50,820
He's bummed about it.

1776
01:20:51,820 --> 01:20:53,820
He's bummed about it.

1777
01:20:53,820 --> 01:21:02,820
And then he decides he's not going to just take this loneliness sitting down.

1778
01:21:02,820 --> 01:21:06,820
He says, today.

1779
01:21:06,820 --> 01:21:10,820
I'm going to make a new friend.

1780
01:21:10,820 --> 01:21:14,820
And then he puts his thoughts into song.

1781
01:21:14,820 --> 01:21:18,820
And we played this clip a couple of years ago.

1782
01:21:18,820 --> 01:21:21,820
But I didn't think we should just repeat material.

1783
01:21:21,820 --> 01:21:23,820
We shouldn't just press play on this clip.

1784
01:21:23,820 --> 01:21:24,820
We had to elevate it.

1785
01:21:24,820 --> 01:21:30,820
That's why we're now going to perform this song for you.

1786
01:21:30,820 --> 01:21:34,820
All right.

1787
01:21:34,820 --> 01:21:44,820
So this is going to take a little a little bit of setup, a little bit of wig work on my part.

1788
01:21:44,820 --> 01:21:55,820
Coming up here while you pull it out on guitar, Mike Carlson.

1789
01:21:55,820 --> 01:22:01,820
On Gepetto vocals, here's Truly Scott Garen.

1790
01:22:01,820 --> 01:22:04,820
This is the honor of a lifetime.

1791
01:22:04,820 --> 01:22:10,820
And on wood block.

1792
01:22:10,820 --> 01:22:14,820
It Jason is Sheridan.

1793
01:22:14,820 --> 01:22:15,820
That sounded OK.

1794
01:22:15,820 --> 01:22:18,820
Is it sort of working for us?

1795
01:22:18,820 --> 01:22:22,820
It check it check.

1796
01:22:22,820 --> 01:22:24,820
I'm not just rifling in my pockets creepily.

1797
01:22:24,820 --> 01:22:27,820
I'm like searching for a mustache.

1798
01:22:27,820 --> 01:22:31,820
We will see if it will remain on for the duration of the performance.

1799
01:22:31,820 --> 01:22:32,820
Likely not.

1800
01:22:32,820 --> 01:22:38,820
It's actually a repurposed Santa Claus eyebrow.

1801
01:22:38,820 --> 01:22:42,820
Which interesting fact.

1802
01:22:42,820 --> 01:22:43,820
All right.

1803
01:22:43,820 --> 01:22:44,820
I'm ready to go.

1804
01:22:44,820 --> 01:22:47,820
We're ready to go.

1805
01:22:47,820 --> 01:22:52,820
Do we have a name for when we perform music together?

1806
01:22:52,820 --> 01:22:53,820
It's the good boy.

1807
01:22:53,820 --> 01:22:54,820
The good boy.

1808
01:22:54,820 --> 01:22:56,820
The good boy band.

1809
01:22:56,820 --> 01:22:59,820
Be that for now.

1810
01:22:59,820 --> 01:23:02,820
So here we go.

1811
01:23:02,820 --> 01:23:09,820
Let this song carry you into the holiday season.

1812
01:23:09,820 --> 01:23:15,820
Today I take some wood from an old tree.

1813
01:23:15,820 --> 01:23:18,820
Don't you worry Christmas tree.

1814
01:23:18,820 --> 01:23:28,820
Today I try to make it's company.

1815
01:23:28,820 --> 01:23:34,820
Today I try to make those clones.

1816
01:23:34,820 --> 01:23:37,820
Make it out of wood you know.

1817
01:23:37,820 --> 01:23:43,820
Today I tried to stop being alone.

1818
01:23:43,820 --> 01:23:46,820
That's hard.

1819
01:23:46,820 --> 01:23:55,820
Today I try to turn lead into gold.

1820
01:23:55,820 --> 01:24:01,820
Today I try to stop growing old.

1821
01:24:01,820 --> 01:24:04,820
That's hard.

1822
01:24:04,820 --> 01:24:13,820
But today I drink from life's renewing stream.

1823
01:24:13,820 --> 01:24:22,820
Today I wake to cop a dream.

1824
01:24:22,820 --> 01:24:27,820
In all the good kids there's the bad.

1825
01:24:27,820 --> 01:24:29,820
With all of the laughs.

1826
01:24:29,820 --> 01:24:31,820
Then it comes the sad.

1827
01:24:31,820 --> 01:24:35,820
And as the clouds of time roll by.

1828
01:24:35,820 --> 01:24:41,820
It's getting clearer to my eye.

1829
01:24:41,820 --> 01:24:45,820
Today I wept for they.

1830
01:24:45,820 --> 01:24:47,820
So long ago.

1831
01:24:47,820 --> 01:24:50,820
You hear me Pinocchio.

1832
01:24:50,820 --> 01:24:58,820
Today I feel inside of me.

1833
01:24:58,820 --> 01:25:00,820
For today.

1834
01:25:00,820 --> 01:25:08,820
But it's all the man has been made new.

1835
01:25:08,820 --> 01:25:15,820
Today I give my love to you.

1836
01:25:15,820 --> 01:25:20,820
I give my love to you.

1837
01:25:20,820 --> 01:25:29,820
I give my love to me.

1838
01:25:29,820 --> 01:25:33,820
Oh, well.

1839
01:25:33,820 --> 01:25:37,820
Merry Christmas in Gilberto.

1840
01:25:37,820 --> 01:25:39,820
Oh, well.

1841
01:25:39,820 --> 01:25:42,820

So much for coming and listening.

1852
01:26:10,820 --> 01:26:12,820
We've had such a blast all year.

1853
01:26:12,820 --> 01:26:14,820
I can't imagine a thing I've had more fun doing.

1854
01:26:14,820 --> 01:26:16,820
And thank you all for being a part of it.

1855
01:26:16,820 --> 01:26:18,820
Thank you very much.
