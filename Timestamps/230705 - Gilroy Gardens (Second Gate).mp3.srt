1
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:09,580
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:23,380
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, the second gate,

3
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,640
where today's recipe calls for a little bit of garlic

4
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:32,460
and a little bit of sincerity about a magical place.

5
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:35,200
I'm Scott Gardner, joined by Jason Sheridan.

6
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:37,820
Yeah, I'm very intrigued.

7
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:41,940
This is the first park in a while where I was like,

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,420
I'd never heard of it until you mentioned it.

9
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:48,020
Yeah, it's kind of a rare thing, I think.

10
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,720
And I was a little inspired, I think I'd heard of it,

11
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,160
but I was definitely inspired by the audience

12
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,700
because we did a call for second gates at some point,

13
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:00,500
where this was suggested and I realized I'd be up there

14
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:05,400
or I could group it into my NorCal theme park wanderings.

15
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,140
And I'm so glad that I did.

16
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,720
Mike Carlson, hi.

17
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,620
I'm here and since I'm here, I'm something.

18
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,840
I'm here, I'm sincere.

19
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:21,680
And let's be clear, Gilroy Gardens is a very nice theme park.

20
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,240
I'm spilling the lead, but I kind of did in the preview.

21
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:26,780
I'm so excited, am I, about this place and to talk about it

22
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:31,360
and to keep talking about my Northern California theme park wanderings

23
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,920
as I was on the main feed about Great America.

24
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:39,280
And we'll get into that, but there was something that I saved for this

25
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,440
because there was so much to talk about in the other one.

26
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:47,000
And I alluded to that I had stories to tell about the Chuck E. Cheese

27
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,580
that is up there in San Jose.

28
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:56,060
The world's largest Chuck E. Cheese, which it's not, look, you know,

29
00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:00,220
I hear world's largest Chuck E. Cheese and I want it to be the size of an Ikea.

30
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,580
I think that's everybody's.

31
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:04,880
I picture the Warner Brothers store in Times Square.

32
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:06,640
Or is that the one that's nine stories?

33
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,860
They expanded from three to nine.

34
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,540
Yeah, that's what I, a nine story Chuck E. Cheese.

35
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:12,400
Oh, God.

36
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:18,000
With all the characters from years past, Dolly Dimples and et cetera, et cetera.

37
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,980
The king, if you're getting an entire like beach section for the beach,

38
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,260
Bowser's an entire cavern club or whatever.

39
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:28,020
Oh, yeah.

40
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,960
I call it for the what is the Beatles one called?

41
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:33,120
I always just were they the Beagle the Beagles.

42
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,720
Yeah, I think a full barbershop for the four little shavers.

43
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,420
Oh, yes.

44
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:41,360
Oh, God, Jason, can you imagine a whole floor for the four little shavers?

45
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,740
Four little shavers.

46
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:46,180
One of the restored ones at the Volo Auto Museum.

47
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,160
Yes.

48
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:47,620
Illinois.

49
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,780
Yeah, we got to do next time you go back.

50
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,000
Yeah, you got to.

51
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,400
Yeah.

52
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,360
You have a follow.

53
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,480
My parents live out here.

54
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,340
I'm never going back.

55
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,020
That's right.

56
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:56,540
Yeah.

57
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:56,800
Wait.

58
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,240
Yeah.

59
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,860
Well, yeah, you got friends out here.

60
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:00,580
Yeah, you're not.

61
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,760
OK, then you have to go just for that.

62
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,700
Just for Volo.

63
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:04,260
Oh, yeah.

64
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:04,820
I guess you're right.

65
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:08,600
I'll go for Volo and I'll go for I don't know the pizza.

66
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,540
You don't want to have FOMO about missing.

67
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,940
Oh, yeah.

68
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:14,500
OK.

69
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,080
And because, you know, Yolo.

70
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:16,940
That's true.

71
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,600
So you got to go to Volo.

72
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:19,080
Yeah.

73
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,620
And I'm a car guy, too.

74
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,840
So of course.

75
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:22,840
Get there.

76
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:23,580
Rent a car.

77
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,780
Rent a great car and you'll be set.

78
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:33,760
So yeah, it's not, you know, it's not like unbelievable, but it's big.

79
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,640
It's a sizable Chuck E. Cheese.

80
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:38,320
It's it's three stories.

81
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:45,980
And it's like first floor is big dance floor that has become the thing they've

82
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:48,120
replaced the animatronics with.

83
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,820
And of course, we'd find that to be a bummer.

84
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:56,500
But now, having been to that one and other ones with my son, it works pretty well

85
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,060
for the kids.

86
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:00,280
I got to say he's not too interested in the animatronics.

87
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,200
He really likes the light up dance floor.

88
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:02,880
I'm trying.

89
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:03,520
I'm try.

90
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,660
Of course, I took him to a full munch one.

91
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:06,060
Yeah.

92
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:11,240
So I'm giving him all options like, you know, as I said, like religion, like you

93
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:14,800
want to like, you know, not dictate it to you, you know, maybe put some different

94
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,720
things on the table.

95
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:19,140
But but this being my religion, you will be into Chuck E. Cheese.

96
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,920
There's no negotiation about that.

97
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:22,340
Right.

98
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:23,640
What kind of Chuck E.

99
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:24,860
Cheese I do leave up to you.

100
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,300
Yeah.

101
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:25,560
Yeah.

102
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,600
You're you're not forcing him like you need to like the mouse and the tuxedo that

103
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,960
says good night, ladies.

104
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,660
He sings good night, ladies.

105
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,180
All sorts of barbershop songs.

106
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,000
If you want a Chuck E.

107
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,280
Cheese that does more updated songs, and by that I mean sound, the likes of hits

108
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,360
from 2013, then that's fine.

109
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,320
Get more modern.

110
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,920
That's your prerogative.

111
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,700
So that's the big dance floor on the bottom.

112
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:53,600
Second floor is maybe a little more older kids.

113
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,900
Like it's more mature stuff up there.

114
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,380
It's weird.

115
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,220
Like Dolly Dimples used to be.

116
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:59,940
You can say that's the thing you're in.

117
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,900
There's not a lot of remnants of old Chuck E.

118
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,720
Cheese in this place.

119
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:08,720
There's a few, a few scattered ones, but they're being like eliminated bit by bit.

120
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,300
But enough that are.

121
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,340
And if you watch videos that people have posted on the.

122
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,380
So you just know from the space, like, of course, this one had different.

123
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:18,760
Of course, there were other like cabaret style rooms in this one.

124
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:19,320
That one.

125
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,160
I really am jealous because I don't think I've ever been in a Chuck E.

126
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:24,980
Cheese that felt like it was one of the old original ones.

127
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,640
Most of them felt like, oh, it's kind of one big room.

128
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,360
And then the area where the dinner show and the robots.

129
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,780
Well, you got to go to Northridge or recede.

130
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:33,900
It's on recede of Boulevard.

131
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,120
I don't know if you call it Northridge, but you like.

132
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,420
Yeah, genuinely good for a kid hang.

133
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:42,980
But there's like a back room where that's just games.

134
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,800
But for sure, absolutely.

135
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,880
That was the home of the beach bousers.

136
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:51,240
Man, I do have the faintest memory of it's really if there's if, if you're in a Chuck

137
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:51,340
E.

138
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,420
Cheese and it has any other room of any kind.

139
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,120
Yes, it's not a bathroom.

140
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,100
Right.

141
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,460
Don't go into a bathroom looking for old animatronic remnants.

142
00:05:59,700 --> 00:05:59,920
Right.

143
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:00,280
Yeah.

144
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:00,780
Our Chuck E.

145
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:06,380
Cheese growing up used to be a showbiz pizza, so it was not like that.

146
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,940
Oh, it was just it was just a room.

147
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:11,240
It was just a room and then room with table.

148
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:14,600
It was just there was there was the area you eat in front of the robot show.

149
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,380
And then it was just a big room for the games.

150
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,220
OK, OK.

151
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,540
And that's look, that's fine, too.

152
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,580
There's not it's not a problem.

153
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,340
That's fine.

154
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,480
It's a base model and it's great.

155
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,440
And if they've kept it up with the right style of.

156
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:25,680
Yeah.

157
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,500
I mean, why can you not have animatronics and light up dance?

158
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,920
But these things should not contradict each other.

159
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,260
Yeah.

160
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:36,820
I mean, I guess if they feel like that's what they have to do to keep the company afloat,

161
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:40,780
I suppose I'm more willing to accept it if it'll keep Chuck E.

162
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,720
Cheese in business because God knows how they still are in business, but they are.

163
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,360
They keep they keep surviving.

164
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,700
They thriving in some ways with their constant YouTube content and new songs.

165
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:55,460
And there's an album of every three months, seemingly.

166
00:06:55,460 --> 00:07:02,560
Well, and look like it, as I'm saying here, I've been now a bunch of times with my son,

167
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,960
Aaron takes them all the time to it.

168
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:10,540
It absolutely works as potentially cheap or free kids entertainment also, because,

169
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:16,860
you know, he barely my son barely wants to like actually play anything or do anything.

170
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:21,360
It's just kind of like run around and touch everything, jump on a merry-go-round,

171
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,060
decide not to go on the merry-go-round.

172
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,260
We take them off immediately.

173
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:29,920
So on a hot summer day, you're killing a lot of time and pretty cheap in there.

174
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:37,240
Assuming you assuming we don't start just like guzzling wine, the wine's bad enough that it's not tempting.

175
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:40,840
I could say that I haven't done that as a parent is have Chuck E.

176
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,080
Cheese wine on a genuine Chuck E.

177
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:43,900
Cheese child visit.

178
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,880
How much is a glass of wine at a Chuck E.

179
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,200
Cheese?

180
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:47,400
I don't know.

181
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:52,600
I don't think I don't think it's expensive, but you also know it's not.

182
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:53,100
Sure.

183
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:58,580
I'm just wondering what the what the upcharge is for your like Carlos Rossi or whatever.

184
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,420
Yeah, I don't.

185
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,660
Yeah, it's definitely in there.

186
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,140
It's definitely the kind of wine.

187
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:06,060
It's just it feels like it's it's just like a cherry or something.

188
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,040
More akin to a Kool-Aid.

189
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,740
People are not ordering it a lot.

190
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,560
So that's sitting.

191
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:11,980
Oh, I bet.

192
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:18,100
And the home I get well, and it's like employees opening it who possibly are not of drinking age.

193
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,880
And even if they are not allowed.

194
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:20,200
Yes.

195
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:25,400
And if they are drinking, then it's just kind of like whatever crap anyone's buying them.

196
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:28,540
They don't realize that you can't just leave wine sitting out.

197
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:30,560
And they they did.

198
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:36,260
These are not they're not fine vintners being hired at Chuck E.

199
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:36,560
Cheese.

200
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:41,580
I bet there was like a great wine menu and you could sit and listen to Dolly Dimple's play.

201
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:50,060
I well, I'm going to I'll counter that a little and say I don't know if it was great, but I bet it was more akin to the kind of wine you could get anywhere.

202
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:56,480
Yeah, wine was worse in the 70s, but you're getting the same thing there as you are at the nice sit down restaurant.

203
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:57,300
Fair enough.

204
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:57,740
Fair enough.

205
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:01,820
I'm thinking a lot of table wine, table wine with the wicker.

206
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,200
Yeah.

207
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,460
Kind of in the basket.

208
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:07,020
You know, yes, I don't know how to describe it.

209
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,020
I just I always know.

210
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,060
Italian restaurant decorations.

211
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:13,900
But at some point that was practical.

212
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:23,040
Jason, if you could go and blaze a big fat blunt right in front of the four little shavers and listen to their show, what would be better?

213
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,000
Yeah, sure.

214
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,860
Is Illinois recreational?

215
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,800
You can buy it.

216
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,480
I don't know about smoking it inside and no, we can't really smoke anywhere.

217
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:33,600
But it's a hypothetical.

218
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,600
Yeah, I think we should also we should standardize.

219
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,580
But there's different things that we say when we refer to Jason smoking.

220
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:42,980
And I think it should just always be smoke a big fat blunt.

221
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:44,480
Did you say blaze?

222
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,040
Did I say I think I said blaze?

223
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

224
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:47,360
Sorry.

225
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:51,560
So from now on, it's so when you where would you like to blaze a big fat blunt?

226
00:09:52,200 --> 00:10:03,340
Well, as usual, out of the way, like where I won't bother anyone or get the Leilani yourself in a Chuck E.

227
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,480
Cheese in a Chuck E.

228
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,040
Cheese from the 70s, I guess.

229
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:06,860
Oh, yeah.

230
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:09,540
Or just dream animatronic big fat blunt pairing.

231
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:16,420
You know, I don't I don't really like the smell of any kind of smoke like indoors, but I love smoking patio.

232
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,220
OK, so you'd want to go outside.

233
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:27,560
Yeah, I want to go outside and then come in and get comfy and enjoy the shavers like with a nice cool Coke Zero.

234
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,340
Enjoy zero sugar.

235
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:32,080
Why do you smell so funny?

236
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,300
And what are they opening with?

237
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,280
What's that song?

238
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,300
Yeah, what's going to hit?

239
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:37,900
What's going to hit different?

240
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:41,780
Like Lida Rose and they do like Lida Rose.

241
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,040
I'm home again.

242
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:52,580
Like the one that Harold had, they believe Harold Hill tricks the school board to do and to becoming a barbershop quartet at some point.

243
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:53,660
The music man.

244
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,820
And I think they do Lida Rose.

245
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,780
No, those harmonies are going to they're going to they're going to feel like 64.

246
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:00,640
Yeah.

247
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:01,080
Yeah.

248
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,360
After big fat blunt.

249
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:08,840
OK, so I was saying I was describing the floors, right?

250
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:19,000
So, you know that there's and floors one and two I got through, but I was stepping through this because floor three is not open to the public.

251
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:30,980
But I've looked into this and I know that floor three, I think I mentioned in a club three episode where I found this place that floor three was where managers from Chuck E.

252
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:34,000
Cheese had to come and learn how to manage Chuck E.

253
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,120
Cheese.

254
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:36,320
OK, so this was a classroom environment.

255
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:37,040
Oh, my God.

256
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:43,160
That, you know, where all the greats from across the nation learned Chuck E.

257
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:43,860
Cheese magic.

258
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,500
And now it is not open to the public.

259
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:48,920
It's just things that the I don't know if it ever was, I guess.

260
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,880
But, you know, we're having fun.

261
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,600
My son's having fun.

262
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:57,020
But something is gnawing at me, which is I don't know if I'm going to be back here.

263
00:11:57,020 --> 00:12:00,120
This is already my second visit to the San Jose Chuck E.

264
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:00,560
Cheese.

265
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,540
I want to know what's on that third floor.

266
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,260
And I'd heard things.

267
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:09,480
I've seen little like fits and starts of pictures basically.

268
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:15,800
And then I'm in the store and I start Googling this and I found a Reddit post on some deep Chuck E.

269
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:18,240
Cheese Reddit or maybe it was our Reddit.

270
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,120
Who knows?

271
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:23,140
And I've and somebody was asking, is there a way to get up there?

272
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:30,120
And I found a reply saying, well, I've a lot of the employees are really nice, actually.

273
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:33,640
And I've just kind of like been super nice to them, too.

274
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,520
And they've said, sure, we'll give you a little tour.

275
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:36,140
We'll let you go.

276
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:38,300
Well, they will show you the old Chuck E.

277
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:38,920
Cheese stuff.

278
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:39,420
Wow.

279
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,120
Because that's where it all.

280
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:45,940
None of the remnants are down where I am on the floor where the public goes like an idiot.

281
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,480
This is where I got to get.

282
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:51,220
So I'm trying to think like, what is my in?

283
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:54,320
How do I worm my way to the employees?

284
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,380
Only third floor.

285
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,120
Oh, my God.

286
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:56,440
Yeah.

287
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:59,800
How do I leave my family to go do that?

288
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:04,180
And then I realized, wait, I have an in with the manager.

289
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:13,880
And the in is that I met the manager a little while ago because when Aaron kind of exhausted from a long kids travel day,

290
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:25,540
gave me the reins for exactly 10 minutes, we went to go play Skeeball and my son got beamed in the head with a Skeeball and bled a little bit.

291
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:25,860
Whoa.

292
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:28,760
Don't worry. It sounds worse than it is just a little bit.

293
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,740
It didn't even alarm me when it happens.

294
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:34,720
So then when I bring him back out to her, she's like, oh, what's that?

295
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,780
Oh, yeah, it's just a little.

296
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,420
Hey, it's OK.

297
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:48,700
I should say this is a game that he requests and one of his favorite things to do at an arcade and arcade is to sit on the ground next to the Skeeball as they all land and clackety clack.

298
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:49,940
He loves the sound.

299
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,060
It drives him crazy.

300
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:56,720
He laughs and laughs and laughs and he likes them to like come down the ramp and land on him.

301
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:06,160
But of course, this is a recipe for some for either dad getting nailed in the balls or in this case, him getting nailed in the forehead and bleeding ever so slightly.

302
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,000
Not so bad.

303
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,820
But of course, I only have this.

304
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:12,440
I took over so quickly and he starts bleeding.

305
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:16,960
So she's like, will you go get like a like an alcohol wipe or something?

306
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,320
OK, yes, can do.

307
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,340
I owe you that much audience.

308
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,080
Don't judge me.

309
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:21,700
Look, it's happened.

310
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,080
A little injury, no injuries happen all the time.

311
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,780
Yeah, that's why I take them away from me.

312
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:26,160
Please.

313
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,020
I just will.

314
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:27,840
One question.

315
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:28,700
Yeah.

316
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,520
He threw the ball up and it came back down.

317
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,300
Well, you take them all.

318
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,840
You're not playing the real game.

319
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:39,480
You just kind of like taking them all going crazy like Van Hammerslee on Mr.

320
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:40,720
Show at the pool table.

321
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:43,860
Whoa, just like like stirring them all up.

322
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:51,660
And then he toss them all up and then a big barrage all comes down and they land in his lap and he laughs and let they go all over the floor.

323
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:56,360
I've got if employees are watching this, they must be like, Jesus, play the balls.

324
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:57,340
Yeah, yeah, they are.

325
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:57,640
Yes.

326
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:02,080
So the the the possibility of injury is is really high.

327
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,980
But we've done this a lot of times without injury.

328
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,720
Of course, it happens up there again.

329
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,980
Mile. It's very mild.

330
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,200
So I go.

331
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:18,260
I mean, that's what you know, it was the universe punishing you because it's antithetical to the spirit of the game to the game of ski.

332
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,280
Jason, I respect for the game.

333
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,920
I mean, you're right.

334
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:26,800
I wasn't I didn't even I wasn't scoring at all.

335
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:30,020
In the end, they're all just deposited up into the gutter.

336
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,780
So zero points are scored.

337
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:39,460
So if you're in it for the brinksmanship, yeah, for her, the eternal mystery, I'm not we're screwing up.

338
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:41,020
We're just we're just breaking all the rules.

339
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:49,320
Look, it's hard enough to get it up the top score in the middle, let alone those two on the sides, the mystery ones.

340
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:49,960
Oh, yeah.

341
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,960
I don't think it's a mystery.

342
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:56,620
I believe those are mysteries to me because I love it, but I'm not particularly good at it.

343
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,420
I think it says what number though.

344
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,380
I think it doesn't.

345
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:01,000
You're right.

346
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:05,360
Mike, you're logically correct, but I do like the spirit of the mystery hole.

347
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:06,180
Yeah, yeah.

348
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:08,000
I don't know what's going to happen.

349
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:09,520
Yeah.

350
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:13,680
Who actually nobody's ever gotten one is you don't know the whole thing might like start shooting fireworks.

351
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:19,500
I can tell you it sounds like though, Jason, when God closes the door, he opens a window.

352
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,360
Yeah.

353
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:23,080
Here as far as your relationship now with the manager.

354
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:23,960
Yes, exactly.

355
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:24,480
Thank you.

356
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,280
Thank you for that.

357
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:32,440
That's what I was thinking because I went up and I met her after I went and asked an employee for an alcohol wipe and they didn't know what that meant.

358
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:41,800
So they pointed me over to a manager who was having a meeting with several employees, which I had to go interrupt to get a small alcohol wipe.

359
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,320
So now this is all happened.

360
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,020
There's blood every day.

361
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,140
Chuck E. Cheese, what is it?

362
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:47,880
What's going on?

363
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,400
You would think maybe there's not.

364
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,440
And again, look, it's not getting on the ground.

365
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,040
All right.

366
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,160
It's barely the just a pinch.

367
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,440
Just a little kids not bleeding like Ric Flair in the seventies.

368
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:01,980
It was it was a controlled bleed.

369
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:02,640
Exactly.

370
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,640
Maybe not a purposeful one, but under control.

371
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:07,840
So I went talk to her.

372
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,560
She was very nice about it.

373
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:12,880
So when a little while later, I'm thinking I got to get up there.

374
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,400
I'm like, well, she was nice enough.

375
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:16,080
Maybe this is my shot.

376
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:21,360
So I go I it's gnawing at me here and says, you better go get this out of your system.

377
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:23,740
I'll make sure he doesn't get injured again.

378
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,120
I'll keep being a parent.

379
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,360
You go be a child.

380
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:34,040
And I I go up and I interrupt another meeting and I say, hey, another question.

381
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:39,040
Ah, and then the regret surges before the sentence even starts.

382
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:48,320
It's just I I've heard about some of the stuff up in the back and the third floor.

383
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,020
I've heard that there's things on the third.

384
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:51,960
And I really like Chuck E.

385
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,140
I like old Chuck E.

386
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:53,380
Cheese.

387
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:57,320
And I was and I've heard about some of the things that might be there.

388
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:04,380
And I was hoping is there any chance that I can she has started glaring at me, you know,

389
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:05,900
10 percent of the way through.

390
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,400
She knows where you're going on sentence.

391
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,060
Yeah.

392
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:08,260
Yeah.

393
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,500
And so she lets me get to the end.

394
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,480
She lets me make a full fool of myself.

395
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:20,000
And then she very, very nice person, but also very sternly just says, there's a lot of room for me.

396
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,460
I've heard rumors about what's going on up there about what's on the third floor.

397
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,340
And that's all they are is just rumors.

398
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,500
That's it.

399
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,140
There's nothing to see up there.

400
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:30,600
All right.

401
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,560
I've worked here for 15 years.

402
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,660
I know that there is nothing to see.

403
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,140
If there was something I would have seen it.

404
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:39,900
So I'm sorry, but I can't let you do that.

405
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:42,440
But there's don't worry about it because there is nothing to see.

406
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,560
It's really intense.

407
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:48,480
This is I feel a little ashamed, a little scared.

408
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:52,260
I the energy of this was so severe.

409
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:54,420
I mean, I assumed to know.

410
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,600
But then what I got was so heavy.

411
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,100
Wow.

412
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,080
What do you make of this?

413
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:04,500
The Ark of the Covenant has been placed in the hands of top men, top men.

414
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:08,080
It could even be the dial of destiny up there for all I know.

415
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:10,020
The dial of destiny up there.

416
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:13,880
I yeah, I don't I don't know.

417
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:14,540
Weird, right?

418
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,620
So this is where the story ends.

419
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:16,820
You didn't try to sneak up there.

420
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:19,960
I didn't try to although in the lead up to this, you're right.

421
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:24,140
I'm forgetting part of the story, which is that I checked every employee door first.

422
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,760
First, I tried to sneak.

423
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:27,820
I did the sneaking first and none of it worked.

424
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:30,140
I jiggled every door and none of them worked.

425
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:37,140
So this is kind of I've now been checkmated and I'm just left to wonder why was the energy so weird with that?

426
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,280
And then I remembered something.

427
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:43,460
This if Eagle Eagle eared listeners.

428
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:44,200
Sure.

429
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:44,840
Why not?

430
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:47,760
It may remember the first time that I ever talked about this.

431
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,640
The first that I heard about it when I just saw it in a book when I was in that car wash.

432
00:19:52,480 --> 00:20:05,700
The thing that it said was that this Chuck E. Cheese is haunted because supposedly a young girl jumped or fell out of the third floor to her death.

433
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:12,340
And I don't know if this story is true, but it's left it to where people think that this Chuck E. Cheese is haunted.

434
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,500
So I'm like, wait a minute.

435
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,880
That's what she thinks I was asking.

436
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:17,360
Yeah.

437
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,840
That's why it was all this weird stuff about rumors and there's nothing to see.

438
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:24,180
She thought that I was after the ghost stuff.

439
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,020
Right.

440
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:30,040
So now I'm we're driving away and I'm like, oh my God, that manager.

441
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,580
She thought I was a ghost weirdo.

442
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:36,120
I didn't convey that I'm a Chuck E. Cheese weirdo.

443
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:39,600
She was totally confused about the kind of weirdo I am.

444
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:41,760
What impression did I give?

445
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:45,060
Well, did you say you said you were a Chuck E. Cheese fan though?

446
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:47,320
That came out, but she might not have.

447
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,540
I'm not afraid you think?

448
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:52,000
I don't. And I also danced around it for no reason.

449
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:55,700
I have said I heard that there's old Chuck E. Cheese props.

450
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,280
Can I go see them?

451
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,340
Instead, I was like, I've heard things.

452
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:00,420
I've heard things.

453
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:03,380
I have an old De Niro impression of things.

454
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:07,420
And I was all weird and cagey.

455
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:08,820
So then she assumed she had to be.

456
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:14,540
So this means that she's dealt with this before that ghost hunters have tried to go in there.

457
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:15,600
Many times a week.

458
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:22,420
It sounds like if she has a kind of a speech prepared, it seemed pretty ready to go with her number of years of employment.

459
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,940
Wow. That's so interesting.

460
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:28,960
I wonder if your hypothesis is right and then it's just a ghost thing.

461
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,320
But I wonder.

462
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:32,260
Yeah, I wonder how many people are like,

463
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,080
What's the ratio of Chuck E.

464
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:39,160
Cheese weirdo to ghost person weirdo that wants to explore the third floor?

465
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,300
I don't know. And how are they hearing about?

466
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,540
Is this Chuck E.

467
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:46,500
Cheese San Jose Ghost Girl story that famous?

468
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:54,260
Was it on like, I mean, I know there's probably a lot of like ghost hunter shows that have had to populate hours and hours with fake stories.

469
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:56,780
Right, right. But so maybe was it on one of those?

470
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,780
And now it's on people's little little trip.

471
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:04,560
I don't know. There's probably a hundred of those shows.

472
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,380
There's no way to check all of them.

473
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:08,660
No, I wouldn't want to channels now.

474
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,160
Yeah, there's YouTube ghost hunters.

475
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:18,240
Never. And she thinks you're going to be pulling out like an electromagnetic meter or something.

476
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:23,640
And you're just hoping for like a shipping crate with Dolly Dimple's head in it.

477
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:27,680
You're looking for like Jasper Jasper's like old vest.

478
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:34,040
Yes, I want like I want the old sparkly dress that Helen used to wear.

479
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,480
Yeah, I just want to try it on. Of course I do.

480
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,880
All these clothes. It's a part of history.

481
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:43,660
Yes. Do I want to put it on and shimmy around like Helen used to get to?

482
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:45,000
Of course I do. Yes.

483
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:46,860
But then I'm going to go. Right.

484
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,440
I will. I'll never be back here.

485
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,080
I promise. I'm more likely to be back because you're not letting me do it now.

486
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:53,740
Yeah, right.

487
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:59,180
So I didn't get I didn't get up there, but I have watched YouTube videos.

488
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:01,960
So I do know what is up there.

489
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,060
And I guess it's no wouldn't have been any better to see it in person.

490
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:07,080
Who am I kidding? Of course it would have been, of course.

491
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:10,860
But can I tell you what what is up there? Yeah, because it is pretty good.

492
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:18,820
I mean, it's a bunch of like old artwork like murals that used to be on the wall, some of which are old characters.

493
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,920
There's Dolly Dimple's.

494
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:33,700
There's one where the king, the Elvis type character, the lion, is at like a drafting desk and he's hard at work and he looks stressed out.

495
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:39,100
And and Chuck is over his shoulder looking really angry at him.

496
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:45,740
Like he's not happy with the work that he's doing and only through the deciphering the view.

497
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:50,940
You have to stare at the image to know that it's because he's drawing a mouse trap and that's why.

498
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:58,500
But what it looks like is that he's like, like you're planning renovations to Chuck's house or something.

499
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,120
And like, that's never going to work.

500
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:03,460
I need a lot more secret doors.

501
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:05,160
I got a lot of shit to hide.

502
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:07,220
You contractors are all crooked.

503
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,100
I knew I shouldn't trust you.

504
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:11,340
This is why I never pay you.

505
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:16,400
I get you up here, get you working, then I steal your plans and I just build them on my own.

506
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,980
I should have just drawn it myself.

507
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,300
Give me the pencil.

508
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,980
I guess I got to do everything around here.

509
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,240
But Squally's pizza tastes like shit.

510
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,440
It's my recipe.

511
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,460
And if I let him cook it, he fucks that up too.

512
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:37,960
The best, the big centerpiece of it, though, is that there's a big mural.

513
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:41,840
This is on a YouTube channel for the user sets streets and eats.

514
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:46,900
And there's a big mural and it says the Royal Order of Rodents.

515
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:50,240
And it's a big gathering of a bunch of cartoon mice.

516
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,800
So Chuck's in there.

517
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:54,200
Mickey and Minnie are in there.

518
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:57,980
The Cinderella mice, Jock and Gus are there.

519
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:00,180
And Mighty Mouse is there too.

520
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,400
So it's a big gathering.

521
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:05,080
The Royal Order of Rodents.

522
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,620
And I don't know what they're doing.

523
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:07,980
They don't seem to be getting along.

524
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,600
They're just kind of all together.

525
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:16,200
But this was apparently up in the store with Mickey and Minnie and other Disney characters in it.

526
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,000
And then so that's up on the wall.

527
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:24,220
And then next to it is just a kind of crumpled piece of paper, not in a frame or anything, just a pin on the wall.

528
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:29,380
And this is a letter from the Walt Disney Company from 1989 saying,

529
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:33,720
We have noticed some photos of some displays in your store.

530
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:40,600
And we assume that this was done in innocence, but we now ask you to take them down immediately, motherfuckers.

531
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:43,180
Get this out of your store ASAP.

532
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,400
Signed Michael Eisner?

533
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:49,340
I mean, I think it did seem to be a female name of a lawyer.

534
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,180
I wish I could say it was Eisen.

535
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:57,100
But you know, he was staring over her shoulder like angry Chuck looking over the king.

536
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:58,980
Make it meaner.

537
00:25:59,160 --> 00:25:59,660
Threaten more.

538
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:00,340
Threaten her.

539
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,200
Threaten stronger language.

540
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:09,980
So anyway, that's is that a video with video or just like pictures, still pictures?

541
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:11,140
Those video. Yeah.

542
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:11,440
Yeah.

543
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,440
From what year?

544
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,820
I don't know.

545
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:14,300
I'm not sure.

546
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,900
A couple of years ago, within the last few years.

547
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:20,220
I wonder if there was just a point also where it was like no more tours.

548
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:21,680
Yeah, maybe.

549
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,320
So like something happened.

550
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:24,280
Yeah, right.

551
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:24,820
Something happened.

552
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,220
Some employee did something.

553
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:32,040
So then he smoked a big blazed, a big flat blazed, a big fat up there and up there.

554
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,780
And it was over.

555
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:37,980
Somebody said somebody tried to get Chuck blazed.

556
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:38,420
Yeah.

557
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:40,540
And have lightened part of the mural on fire.

558
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:44,780
And then it was like from now on, nothing fun is happening up here anymore.

559
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:54,820
There was another mural where it's Chuck and Minnie hooking up and then it got lit on fire by the blunt.

560
00:26:55,500 --> 00:27:01,380
So it's not the person painted it and then like ash.

561
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,960
They're they're right when they finished.

562
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:06,140
It's a shame.

563
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:10,300
Now it's just up to all of us to imagine that scene.

564
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:10,960
Yeah.

565
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:12,980
You'll never find out.

566
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,160
Take a memo.

567
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,400
Take a message.

568
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,280
I see you've got some artwork.

569
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:21,220
Chuckie doing Mickey's old lady.

570
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:22,500
Please.

571
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:23,100
Right away.

572
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:29,280
We have standards in our character design and we'd frankly rather not know what is going on under her skirts.

573
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:34,480
It is pulled up a bit high for our comfort and you could see too many parts for our comfort as well.

574
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,920
Signed Michael Eisner.

575
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:37,020
Yes.

576
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,860
Hands off Mickey's old lady or else.

577
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,160
Then a year later.

578
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:43,560
Hello.

579
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:43,960
You might.

580
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:44,460
Hello.

581
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:54,460
You might remember my letter from a year ago and I'm not pleased to see that there is now another mural in your store in which Chuckie cheese is doing things to me.

582
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,440
I get the message.

583
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:58,040
I understand.

584
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:58,860
I do it too.

585
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,120
I do it right back to you.

586
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,880
However, this is a place.

587
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:03,580
This is an establishment for children.

588
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:04,940
The acts being performed.

589
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:06,880
I only perform on my wife.

590
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:09,300
Only her and no one else.

591
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:12,840
I've made her a vow and I don't like to break it even in cartoon form.

592
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:18,060
I have a work relationship with Mickey and I would never fight him in such a manner.

593
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:19,620
I forget.

594
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:20,900
Was it Minnie or Mickey in the bit?

595
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,420
I can't remember.

596
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:27,020
I don't appreciate you depicting me doing sex acts with all of your characters and all of ours.

597
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:35,100
The Walt Disney Company owns hundreds of characters and I can't believe you took the time to draw me fucking all of them following our list of acts.

598
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:37,080
I would never perform on Chuck E.

599
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:37,460
Cheese.

600
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:38,800
Number one, Felatio.

601
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:41,340
Number two, analingus.

602
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,380
Number three, cigar stuff.

603
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:52,020
This is the world's largest Chuck E.

604
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,600
Cheese in San Jose, California.

605
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:54,380
Yeah.

606
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:58,020
Because Sestrates and Eats has been to a lot of Chuck E.

607
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:58,180
Cheese.

608
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,060
Oh, OK.

609
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:02,920
And found the various different shows and such.

610
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,460
Oh, he's a cataloger of the shows.

611
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:06,080
He's cataloging a lot.

612
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:06,340
Wow.

613
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:08,420
He's doing the Lord's work and I appreciate it.

614
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,740
There's one little thing and we'll get to the much nicer Gilroy Gardens.

615
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:19,520
But after there's a lot of filth at the top and the filth isn't done because I texted you guys something here.

616
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:20,340
Don't look yet.

617
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,380
Don't spoil it for yourselves.

618
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:24,960
I found, you know, because I'm just scouring this Chuck E.

619
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,140
Cheese for like old remnants of old Chuck stuff.

620
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:36,400
And I found a pretty old school little display in the way they got a lot of like big window display space to fill.

621
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:42,680
So they have to keep some old Chuck stuff up there just to even have anything to make sure that's not just empty.

622
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:49,420
So a pretty great display that it's like it's like an old movie theme.

623
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:49,960
Right.

624
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:57,480
And it's like a little little scene is being filmed with where Chuck, modern Chuck and Helen are having lunch.

625
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,100
They're having a nice lunch together.

626
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,700
And this is nice.

627
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:11,640
And then there's like I think there might be a camera and there's definitely film reels and like a clapboard and the clapboard says title show biz and me starring Chuck E.

628
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:16,640
Cheese location San Jose producer Pete Tenayuka.

629
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:18,980
I don't know who that is.

630
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:20,680
That's not a cartoon.

631
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:21,840
That's not one of their characters.

632
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,060
Maybe that's who started the branch.

633
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,000
I'm not sure.

634
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:38,080
The point is it's a little like movie themed thing and there's a big film strip and it has some pretty like usual suspects in terms of old classic movies to show.

635
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:41,120
There's Gone with the Wind and there's The Wizard of Oz.

636
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:55,720
But I now ask you guys to look at the picture that I sent you and just register when you see what I saw that was a tad alarming in this tribute to black and white Hollywood.

637
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,480
Just zoom around.

638
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,880
I think you'll I think you'll get it.

639
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:09,980
I think I think I I see Captain Kangaroo.

640
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:11,880
No they and that's just a nice thing.

641
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:14,700
Okay that's nice to see him.

642
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:15,420
Wizard of Oz.

643
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,180
Yeah keep going you're heading in the right direction.

644
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:18,220
Okay.

645
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,400
Is Bill Cosby in this?

646
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:19,980
Yeah.

647
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,800
Bill Cosby's up there.

648
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:24,060
You got a lurking Cosby.

649
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:27,220
It's a smaller picture so I wasn't sure but yeah.

650
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:28,440
And Culp right?

651
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:33,140
And yes and yes Culp you might remember from Cyber Mania 94.

652
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:34,740
It's a nice ride.

653
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:41,880
It's from I Spy which is a television show not a film so it should not be on a film reel.

654
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:43,420
So that's issue number one.

655
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:48,340
Issue number two is the continued presence of Bill Cosby in the window of their store.

656
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:50,880
This is in the windows out front basically.

657
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:54,460
I mean to be fair this doesn't look like it's been updated recently.

658
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,940
I don't believe so no.

659
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:58,440
I guess just you know.

660
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:02,640
Well I guess I'm going to address the manager specifically.

661
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:15,600
A lot to do a lot on our mind you know between needing to distribute alcohol wipes to briefly negligent parents and then having to help the same briefly negligent parents.

662
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:16,980
Yeah.

663
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:20,140
With their creepy questions.

664
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:25,860
She's got a lot on her plate but I would just say check your store for hidden Cosby's.

665
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,860
This could be the case with any.

666
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:32,260
I remember I've also speaking of world's largest I've also been to the world's largest McDonald's.

667
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:32,520
Oh yeah.

668
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:38,260
Which is on I Drive in Orlando and that's had a big redo since I was there and it was okay.

669
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,680
Well it was never okay but it's especially not okay.

670
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:45,620
There was there was a big Cosby in the store that I believe is gone now.

671
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:51,480
So if you're a world's largest store check for Cosby's every once in a while.

672
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,100
They check for gas leaks.

673
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:53,440
Yeah.

674
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:56,260
The plumbing is working and make sure you got no Cosby's.

675
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:59,360
I think that's why I see there maybe has been one there and you have no idea.

676
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:00,080
Yeah.

677
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:00,780
Wise words.

678
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:03,200
Largest target world's largest.

679
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:07,120
The hardware could be a Cosby's can be anywhere.

680
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:07,580
Yeah.

681
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:08,360
So yeah.

682
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,500
That's a good lesson.

683
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:12,540
If you're listening to this and you on the world's largest something.

684
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:14,460
Beyond the alert.

685
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:18,340
How I'm disappointed honestly that you didn't get to get up there.

686
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:21,420
So yeah I wish that I'd been hyping and I think don't ask the manager.

687
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:22,540
I think you got to ask.

688
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:23,280
Yeah.

689
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,620
I mean I should have.

690
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:24,920
Yeah.

691
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:26,740
I understand why you did it.

692
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:27,580
Just in hindsight.

693
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:28,820
It's the one that I'd met.

694
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,740
I met the other one who didn't know what an alcohol.

695
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:31,780
She's got all the keys.

696
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:32,700
Yeah.

697
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:35,180
I mean ultimately that's that's who you want to talk to.

698
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:40,760
Well I guess I'm going to have to go up to this area again which I would be happy to

699
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:48,600
because they have great places like Gilroy Gardens and you know maybe I felt like top

700
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:57,740
loading you know snarky or gross stuff here at the top because I don't really know how

701
00:33:57,740 --> 00:34:03,880
to I feel a little like you know vulnerable heading into this year.

702
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,260
Yeah.

703
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:07,360
Because this is I just love this place.

704
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:07,700
Yeah.

705
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:10,660
Like do I have a know how do you do this when you just love a play.

706
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:12,980
We got to take a page from Andrew Barth Feldman's book.

707
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:13,520
Yeah.

708
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,360
Just being excited about something.

709
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:15,740
Yeah.

710
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:21,920
But I don't don't we all use snark and jokes as armor and when that armor is stripped away

711
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:24,580
by a nice place like Gilroy Gardens what do you do.

712
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:25,700
Yeah.

713
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:31,360
I watched a few videos and I saw some people writing about it online referring to it as

714
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:40,420
like the most beautiful theme park in America because it it is seems to be you know a horticultural

715
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:42,160
like botanical garden.

716
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:42,860
Yes.

717
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,140
First and foremost.

718
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:45,200
Exactly.

719
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,120
It grew out of that.

720
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:53,180
It was that first and became a theme park in 2001 and has evolved since then.

721
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:57,360
But don't any of the gardens look shitty and we can make fun of the gardens like they look

722
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:01,500
like you know some trash hanging around or something like there's got to be some cynical

723
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,900
angle this podcast the ride.

724
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,320
Well we can roast the circus trees.

725
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,180
Okay.

726
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:06,480
Yeah.

727
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,780
Those whimsical pieces of shit.

728
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:12,180
There's a way trees are supposed to look okay.

729
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:18,680
If there's not a big branch if there's not like a branch what's the there's not a big

730
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:19,440
trunk trunk.

731
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,220
I don't want no holes in my trunk.

732
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:21,760
Okay.

733
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,020
We don't care.

734
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:25,320
Let's let's just tear these trunks up.

735
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:31,140
Oh people in the past just totally bemused by silly little Swiss cheese trees.

736
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:32,280
Yeah.

737
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:32,840
Yeah.

738
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,120
They didn't.

739
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:33,320
Yeah.

740
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,800
They didn't have our phones and our gadgets.

741
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,740
Those simpletons.

742
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,140
Yeah.

743
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:44,500
I would entertain them for a day seeing some wonderfully cultivated trees designed bent

744
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,360
into all kinds of whimsical shapes.

745
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:47,000
Oh shoot.

746
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,220
I what can I got.

747
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,340
I got nothing here.

748
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:51,040
I'm veering back into sincerity.

749
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:51,820
Yeah.

750
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:52,820
Yeah.

751
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:54,820
I guess I guess I just got to go with it.

752
00:35:54,820 --> 00:36:00,180
And you know what I really was I feel like okay I knew about Gilroy.

753
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:05,560
I've taken trips up north before and I've driven through Gilroy and the smell of garlic

754
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:08,160
has wafted into the car just passing by.

755
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:14,600
So I thought this is a silly place that smells like garlic and maybe I heard that there is

756
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:19,220
a theme park or something and I thought well that's got to be some that that's got to be

757
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:26,260
like what's the you know in it like a goofy movie where they go to the kind of podunk

758
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:27,260
clusters possum.

759
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:27,680
Yeah.

760
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:27,980
Yeah.

761
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:28,260
Yeah.

762
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:30,120
I'm like it's going to be like that.

763
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:30,380
Right.

764
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:37,680
But with garlic and all kinds of stuff that it's you know it's garlic milkshakes and garlic

765
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:42,980
waffles and all this shit that's not good and it's going to be janky and then it's not

766
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:43,900
that at all.

767
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:46,920
I think there are probably things like that in Gilroy.

768
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:51,720
I think there are a little like knickknack stores and they do a garlic festival.

769
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:56,480
And there's so I think I probably had seen photos of a lot of these things conflated

770
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,160
them in my heads in my heads.

771
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:07,860
I was I was of multiple heads about this subject and and thought that I was getting something

772
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:08,920
silly into snarkette.

773
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:11,040
But instead it's just what you said.

774
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:14,200
It is like I would say America.

775
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,100
Absolutely.

776
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:16,560
It is the most beautiful.

777
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:19,680
It's certainly the most beautiful park I have been to in America.

778
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:20,260
Absolutely.

779
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:20,660
Wow.

780
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:21,320
Yeah.

781
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:27,420
It seems like like I think Disney's Animal Kingdom beautiful landscaping.

782
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:29,180
It's been open for a while now.

783
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:31,480
So the trees are really grown in.

784
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:41,360
And this is because it started it was built over time by a family who sold their grocery

785
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,300
store chain.

786
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:42,940
Yes.

787
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:45,540
And then use the funds to build it.

788
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:51,640
And then slowly it was a nursery and then then it was you know for the employees of

789
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:56,360
the grocery stores and then they hired the Paramount Parks to manage it.

790
00:37:56,360 --> 00:38:00,180
Yeah. It's open for a little bit initially called Bonfonte Gardens.

791
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:02,880
That's the family Michael and Claudia Bonfonte.

792
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:11,300
They own Knob Hill Foods and it was a place for their employees to spend time which is

793
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:15,500
a very like old school that feels like a turn of the century idea.

794
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,600
That is how Hershey project.

795
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:19,260
Oh I heard she park started.

796
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:19,820
Yeah.

797
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:25,660
That was a play that was grounds like a nice picnic park for the sprawling factory.

798
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:26,960
Yeah.

799
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:27,440
Yeah.

800
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:30,580
To apologize for them getting chocolate long.

801
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:31,760
Yeah.

802
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,440
All day every day.

803
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:38,980
But he's yeah he's just he's a big tree fan.

804
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:43,720
He just really believes in the beauty and the power of trees and wants to communicate

805
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,140
this some out of the public.

806
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:48,560
And I think it is open a little bit as a botanical garden.

807
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:53,200
But then he realizes that the only way to make it economically viable is to add rides.

808
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:57,320
But how do we add rides and still keep it very beautiful.

809
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:00,800
And they definitely pulled that off.

810
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:08,480
It is also like for L.A. people or for you guys if you've been to Descanso Gardens or

811
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,740
Huntington Gardens one of these.

812
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:15,880
I mean it's like one of those spaces but with rides and a lot of them.

813
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:17,400
OK. I like those places.

814
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:18,140
I like them too.

815
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:22,160
But already I liked them pre-kid.

816
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,920
I loved them post-kid.

817
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:28,820
They're one like you know he wants to do is just kind of like roam free through a beautiful

818
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:29,400
place.

819
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:34,600
And so to get that plus attractions that are really well done it's great.

820
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,780
It's so great.

821
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,660
So yeah you're right that you OK.

822
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:41,860
Yeah. The history of it Paramount's part of it.

823
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:47,220
They're just operating it initially because I think this place is not going well from

824
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:48,520
2001 to 2003.

825
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:53,240
So they need somebody to take care of the theme park stuff who gets the theme park stuff.

826
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:58,920
And then that causes it to get folded into all that this history that we've gone over

827
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:02,900
with so many parks where it's Paramount but then Paramount is bought by Cedar Fair.

828
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:04,020
So it's one of those.

829
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:08,980
And then only recently did it shed the Cedar Fair relationship.

830
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:12,080
I think the contract ended in 2021.

831
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:13,260
Really recently.

832
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:23,080
A video I saw I think it's Cano B Coaster is the channel was talking about how they

833
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:29,060
were there in 2022 and they were still taking the Cedar Fair Platinum Pass that gets you

834
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:30,980
into every Cedar Fair Park.

835
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:32,460
Oh OK.

836
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:37,500
And we're still selling Fastlane I think is their line skipping.

837
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:37,900
They still do.

838
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,460
Yes it's the same branding of their Fastpass Skip the Line thing.

839
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:47,280
You see those same signs as you see in Great America but it's otherwise not related.

840
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:50,700
But there was a time where you could have gotten passes to all of this.

841
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:51,220
Yes.

842
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:52,720
Which should be great.

843
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:54,400
That's a great value.

844
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:57,920
There was you know there were things to like about Great America.

845
00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:00,160
But you add it to this.

846
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:04,660
I mean this truly if you're if you were listener if you were passing through this area and

847
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:09,780
you have to pick if I have not if you haven't gotten this just already take Gilroy Gardens

848
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:16,320
it's great because like I would say it was really like for experiencing new theme parks

849
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:20,180
that new to me it doesn't happen that often with me.

850
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:25,180
And so to like get a vibe and start like that that's something you only have your first

851
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:28,780
like 10 minutes in the right to do is just what is the vibe here.

852
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:32,800
And I was so bummed to realize Great America the first the first thing that occurred to

853
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,200
me was charmlous.

854
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,940
That went straight into my head.

855
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:37,620
I'm like I'm going to find things to do here.

856
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:40,780
We have some fun here but there is definitely not any charm.

857
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:47,460
And then the opposite when you go into Gilroy I didn't know what we were in for because

858
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:54,560
you're driving in through pretty landscape but also kind of like nondescript to some

859
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,080
extent a little brown.

860
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:59,900
I don't know is this just going to be like the way theme parks are plopped into some

861
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:01,100
kind of farmland.

862
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:06,760
And it's like pretty adjacent or there's something way in the background that's nice to look

863
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:07,020
at.

864
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:11,700
But instead this place you're just you're just suddenly in this lush oasis.

865
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,540
It is so green.

866
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:19,760
The mission accomplished on the trees beautiful trees everywhere.

867
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:25,740
The did like the Disney Berm ideas so like blown away.

868
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:30,400
But you know they have like a layer of trees sometimes while blocking the street or whatever.

869
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:35,120
But this is you don't know like you assume that forest just goes and goes you feel totally

870
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:40,060
the only like it's what it's it's what Efteling sounds like.

871
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:41,120
I feel like.

872
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:47,820
I what Jason was saying where it's you know you just are in genuine forests but that has

873
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:48,820
rides and stuff.

874
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:52,720
Maybe it's the closest we have in America to that possibly.

875
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,360
I what's the other.

876
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:59,660
What's the big oh just like waterfalls everywhere.

877
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:00,640
Great waterfalls.

878
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:02,360
Lake Lake is incredible.

879
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:03,500
Do I have one.

880
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:03,980
Would I.

881
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:08,100
I mean I'll just I would end up just showing you a picture of a nice lake and you would

882
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:09,440
say oh that looks nice.

883
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,420
So it might not be need to do that.

884
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:11,680
Wait.

885
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:12,700
Well hey I might as well.

886
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:13,020
Yeah.

887
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:13,800
Show us the photo.

888
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:14,380
Look at this.

889
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:15,080
Look at this.

890
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,140
I was ready to make fun of it but it's beautiful.

891
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:20,860
No you were going to use like this is I got Scott here finally.

892
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:23,080
You think that's pretty.

893
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:23,480
Yeah.

894
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:24,920
You think my puke is pretty.

895
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:27,700
I was going to throw up.

896
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,580
You can't can you look at that.

897
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:30,340
No it is.

898
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:30,960
That is great.

899
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:31,840
Yeah serene.

900
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:33,580
Then.

901
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:38,720
So you got a good vibe just from like before you're even in the play it just like the parking

902
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:41,000
lot is beautiful signage is great.

903
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:46,940
Then you get into the park proper and you are hit with this blast of music that is such

904
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:47,520
a delight.

905
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:48,220
Oh yeah.

906
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:51,640
This point I'm going to address very specifically.

907
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:58,160
Kevin from Telethon and my friend Tyler if you guys are listening you will be happy to

908
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:08,440
It is this wonderful soundtrack of Super Synthy 90s New Age that is not I will say it's not

909
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:11,100
like what I listened to necessarily.

910
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:11,540
Sure.

911
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:17,680
But for I mean OK it's basically it's like and thankfully somebody has cataloged some

912
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:23,500
of this on Spotify on a playlist called horticulture hymns the music of Gilroy Gardens.

913
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:28,920
I assume this is accurate because it sounds like what I heard but it's like I mean the

914
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:34,000
big names are Mannheim steamroller and Yanni and then there's a little bit of Mike Post

915
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:39,200
and then a guy named Steve Hawn and just this will give you the vibe a little bit Steve

916
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:39,480
Hawn.

917
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:40,560
This is some of what you hear.

918
00:44:45,848 --> 00:44:48,108
Big old, big powerful drums and then...

919
00:44:53,364 --> 00:44:56,464
Oh man, this is like Weather Channel or Hold Music or...

920
00:44:56,464 --> 00:44:57,204
It's like what?

921
00:44:57,424 --> 00:44:59,184
Weather Channel music or...

922
00:44:59,184 --> 00:45:00,804
Yes, Weather Channel is right on the money.

923
00:45:00,904 --> 00:45:02,624
Yeah, yeah, that feels totally right.

924
00:45:02,904 --> 00:45:04,444
It's like, it's very silly.

925
00:45:04,684 --> 00:45:06,324
It's definitely cheesy.

926
00:45:06,444 --> 00:45:07,764
It's definitely bombasty.

927
00:45:08,264 --> 00:45:10,344
But I don't want people to start thinking,

928
00:45:10,344 --> 00:45:11,744
I've already got caught some shit

929
00:45:11,744 --> 00:45:13,844
because I've said that I like Kenny G stuff

930
00:45:13,844 --> 00:45:15,384
on the podcast a little bit.

931
00:45:15,584 --> 00:45:17,764
Although that's one of those...

932
00:45:17,764 --> 00:45:19,744
Because I've seen comments that are like,

933
00:45:19,824 --> 00:45:21,744
Scott's going to scold people about music taste

934
00:45:21,744 --> 00:45:22,904
and he likes Kenny G.

935
00:45:23,284 --> 00:45:26,304
Hey, listen, the Kenny G that I'm talking about,

936
00:45:26,304 --> 00:45:27,444
you have not heard.

937
00:45:27,744 --> 00:45:31,224
I promise you, you have not heard the Kenny G that I mean.

938
00:45:31,404 --> 00:45:32,684
I know what you're picturing,

939
00:45:32,864 --> 00:45:36,484
but the Kenny G I like is some really good Kenny G.

940
00:45:36,824 --> 00:45:38,324
I have to take my word on this.

941
00:45:38,344 --> 00:45:38,864
What era?

942
00:45:39,044 --> 00:45:40,004
Early 80s.

943
00:45:40,004 --> 00:45:42,144
He was like wrapped up in...

944
00:45:42,144 --> 00:45:48,124
He started in legit like jazz fusion funk.

945
00:45:49,184 --> 00:45:51,664
I'm not just going to start playing it,

946
00:45:51,664 --> 00:45:55,504
but I swear, he was involved with this guy, Kashif,

947
00:45:55,864 --> 00:45:58,664
who did a lot of really great R&B producer.

948
00:45:58,964 --> 00:46:02,584
That's like Kenny G, I know it got cheesy.

949
00:46:02,904 --> 00:46:04,804
I'll get a little cheesy with Kenny G too.

950
00:46:04,804 --> 00:46:06,244
I'll listen to some Pure Mood.

951
00:46:06,304 --> 00:46:07,744
There's lots of Pure Mood's riffs online.

952
00:46:07,744 --> 00:46:09,204
You're not talking about Pure Mood though.

953
00:46:09,384 --> 00:46:10,424
No, no, I know, I know.

954
00:46:10,444 --> 00:46:11,984
I'm saying the cheesier stuff.

955
00:46:12,584 --> 00:46:13,744
Yeah, yes, totally.

956
00:46:13,964 --> 00:46:15,644
I'll listen to some whale songs.

957
00:46:16,064 --> 00:46:19,204
I admit, you know what it is if you're getting into that.

958
00:46:19,224 --> 00:46:23,804
But there is for sure some just legit instrumental funk

959
00:46:23,804 --> 00:46:25,864
that he was part of that is fantastic

960
00:46:25,864 --> 00:46:30,124
and some top tier music videos from back then as well.

961
00:46:30,344 --> 00:46:31,404
Before we grew the hair out,

962
00:46:31,504 --> 00:46:35,524
you're like Kenny Gorelick does not bear any resemblance

963
00:46:35,524 --> 00:46:36,904
to the Kenny G that I know.

964
00:46:38,004 --> 00:46:39,544
But anyway, look, I'm not going to pretend

965
00:46:39,544 --> 00:46:41,984
that I listen to a lot of Yanni and Mannheim Steamroller,

966
00:46:42,004 --> 00:46:44,464
but I have an appreciation for it.

967
00:46:44,584 --> 00:46:45,684
And I'll tell you,

968
00:46:46,004 --> 00:46:48,144
maybe I'll get some listeners back on board with this

969
00:46:49,044 --> 00:46:53,344
because where are you hearing early 90s Yanni and Mannheim

970
00:46:53,344 --> 00:46:55,924
Steamroller, you're hearing that in Epcot Center

971
00:46:55,924 --> 00:46:58,204
and maybe Tomorrowland as well.

972
00:46:58,204 --> 00:47:00,584
And when you hear it in this theme park setting,

973
00:47:01,244 --> 00:47:05,464
it's like where's Spaceship Earth, where's Horizons?

974
00:47:05,464 --> 00:47:07,284
It's gotta be around the corner.

975
00:47:07,524 --> 00:47:08,784
You hear that music and you're like,

976
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:11,344
I'm going to get edutained today.

977
00:47:11,764 --> 00:47:15,384
I'm an infert, I'm gonna see so many edutainers.

978
00:47:15,624 --> 00:47:18,984
Well, it sounds a little like the ending song

979
00:47:18,984 --> 00:47:23,784
with different pictures and tomato girl

980
00:47:23,784 --> 00:47:25,424
of living with the land.

981
00:47:26,104 --> 00:47:26,944
Certainly, yes.

982
00:47:27,084 --> 00:47:28,184
Yeah, absolutely.

983
00:47:28,504 --> 00:47:29,284
And you know what?

984
00:47:29,824 --> 00:47:31,944
This was all in my head for a lot of the,

985
00:47:32,164 --> 00:47:34,924
because this park is simple,

986
00:47:35,244 --> 00:47:40,724
it has aspects of educational, of edutainment.

987
00:47:41,024 --> 00:47:42,884
There is even a big greenhouse.

988
00:47:42,884 --> 00:47:45,644
And I'm like, why am I so enamored with this?

989
00:47:45,764 --> 00:47:48,744
And yet I've found myself so bored by living with the land.

990
00:47:49,044 --> 00:47:52,604
And maybe this is the gateway that I needed.

991
00:47:53,464 --> 00:47:56,684
Maybe I go back and appreciate living with the land

992
00:47:56,684 --> 00:48:00,964
a little more because I now know how to better,

993
00:48:01,464 --> 00:48:06,204
I've seen the fusion of theme park and farm

994
00:48:06,204 --> 00:48:10,804
that works for me and that worked for a little child as well.

995
00:48:11,504 --> 00:48:13,184
And maybe that's the step that I need.

996
00:48:13,404 --> 00:48:14,284
Just like, and again, listener,

997
00:48:14,284 --> 00:48:17,604
I will give you the gateways to the Kenny G

998
00:48:17,604 --> 00:48:19,564
that I like if you need them.

999
00:48:20,284 --> 00:48:21,764
Like the same, you need music to,

1000
00:48:21,984 --> 00:48:23,504
you're missing that middle step.

1001
00:48:23,624 --> 00:48:25,664
So maybe, I don't know,

1002
00:48:25,664 --> 00:48:27,464
maybe this is my gateway to living with the land.

1003
00:48:27,644 --> 00:48:28,024
Could be.

1004
00:48:28,084 --> 00:48:28,344
Oh, wow.

1005
00:48:28,564 --> 00:48:30,944
Maybe, I mean, this does have the,

1006
00:48:31,044 --> 00:48:33,524
is it the monarch garden that has the monorail

1007
00:48:33,524 --> 00:48:34,524
that goes through it?

1008
00:48:34,684 --> 00:48:35,984
Is that the big greenhouse?

1009
00:48:36,464 --> 00:48:38,804
I didn't end up going in there,

1010
00:48:40,804 --> 00:48:42,944
except that really fantastic part of the trip

1011
00:48:42,944 --> 00:48:44,664
was getting on a train,

1012
00:48:44,784 --> 00:48:47,384
because we got to prioritize trains for our three-year-old.

1013
00:48:47,564 --> 00:48:50,024
And we hadn't really been in the park much,

1014
00:48:50,404 --> 00:48:52,064
which this is a good way,

1015
00:48:52,084 --> 00:48:53,984
this would be a good way to do Disneyland, honestly.

1016
00:48:53,984 --> 00:48:57,524
How many people actually have gotten to Disneyland

1017
00:48:57,524 --> 00:49:00,764
for the first time in their lives and done the train first?

1018
00:49:01,044 --> 00:49:02,864
That'd be kind of a trippy way to do it

1019
00:49:02,864 --> 00:49:04,524
because you suddenly are like,

1020
00:49:04,684 --> 00:49:06,784
wow, this place goes and goes.

1021
00:49:07,564 --> 00:49:10,164
I've experienced bits and pieces of the theming,

1022
00:49:10,164 --> 00:49:12,484
and now I get to go do the details.

1023
00:49:12,804 --> 00:49:14,504
Be kind of a cool way to do it, I think.

1024
00:49:14,544 --> 00:49:15,084
Yeah.

1025
00:49:15,244 --> 00:49:18,304
Maybe I'll do that with the babies first.

1026
00:49:18,524 --> 00:49:18,904
Could.

1027
00:49:19,104 --> 00:49:22,584
Well, and the train's a good first one to do,

1028
00:49:22,904 --> 00:49:25,524
because it moves, but it barely moves.

1029
00:49:25,524 --> 00:49:27,564
You could not be scared by the train.

1030
00:49:27,644 --> 00:49:28,184
Hopefully not.

1031
00:49:28,184 --> 00:49:30,704
It's basically a room that moves a little bit.

1032
00:49:30,984 --> 00:49:32,824
That'd be, and it's maybe a cool way to do it.

1033
00:49:32,824 --> 00:49:34,484
But that's what we got to do here,

1034
00:49:34,504 --> 00:49:36,764
where we thought this place was dinky.

1035
00:49:36,924 --> 00:49:38,484
It was gonna end pretty fast.

1036
00:49:38,884 --> 00:49:41,404
And instead, this train ride keeps going and going.

1037
00:49:41,464 --> 00:49:42,304
You're like, you're kidding.

1038
00:49:42,604 --> 00:49:44,324
And they have this and they have this and they have this.

1039
00:49:44,524 --> 00:49:46,504
And then it goes inside the greenhouse,

1040
00:49:46,704 --> 00:49:48,164
which is a huge greenhouse.

1041
00:49:48,444 --> 00:49:50,544
And it's a real like, whoa moment,

1042
00:49:50,544 --> 00:49:51,884
because you don't know they have it,

1043
00:49:51,924 --> 00:49:54,324
and you're amazed that the train is going in there.

1044
00:49:54,564 --> 00:49:56,364
And then you're hitting waterfalls,

1045
00:49:56,444 --> 00:49:58,124
and then seeing that they have a whole water park

1046
00:49:58,124 --> 00:49:58,924
and everything too.

1047
00:50:00,224 --> 00:50:04,004
It's just, the scope of this place is really fantastic.

1048
00:50:05,284 --> 00:50:07,604
Let me just name some other stuff.

1049
00:50:08,364 --> 00:50:10,604
Swan boats, you got swan boats.

1050
00:50:11,824 --> 00:50:14,064
And then you got like, I mean, really what it is,

1051
00:50:14,144 --> 00:50:15,484
really the core of it,

1052
00:50:15,504 --> 00:50:17,364
and listeners will know if they've been there,

1053
00:50:17,724 --> 00:50:20,744
is it's just, it's as simple as this.

1054
00:50:21,024 --> 00:50:22,884
It's rides that are big fruits.

1055
00:50:23,284 --> 00:50:25,904
It's just big fruits, big strawberries.

1056
00:50:26,004 --> 00:50:28,124
They swing around, they get a little bit off the ground,

1057
00:50:28,144 --> 00:50:28,904
but not too much.

1058
00:50:28,924 --> 00:50:30,144
It doesn't scare your three-year-old.

1059
00:50:30,784 --> 00:50:33,664
There's a big silly symphony swings kind of thing.

1060
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:37,164
A giant swing mechanism, but it's a giant mushroom.

1061
00:50:37,924 --> 00:50:39,604
Like you can see, you can picture that shape.

1062
00:50:39,624 --> 00:50:40,484
That works great.

1063
00:50:41,724 --> 00:50:45,444
And I say that, and I'm like, well, isn't that like,

1064
00:50:45,484 --> 00:50:48,484
this place opened 2001.

1065
00:50:49,024 --> 00:50:51,224
There's a little bit of like an acoustic guitar,

1066
00:50:51,384 --> 00:50:54,204
plucky, mediocre jazz element

1067
00:50:54,204 --> 00:50:55,964
playing musically all over the place.

1068
00:50:56,224 --> 00:50:59,284
There's farm stuff, little simple rides

1069
00:50:59,284 --> 00:51:00,144
that are showing you what a fun.

1070
00:51:00,144 --> 00:51:03,784
This is, it's a little bit DCA 1.0.

1071
00:51:04,284 --> 00:51:07,324
That's, I don't know, I was thinking that a little bit,

1072
00:51:07,324 --> 00:51:08,064
and I was wondering.

1073
00:51:08,364 --> 00:51:09,504
In a good way, in the best way,

1074
00:51:09,584 --> 00:51:13,384
not in the like clashy, ugly signs way,

1075
00:51:13,764 --> 00:51:15,904
or like rides that they have fast way.

1076
00:51:16,044 --> 00:51:18,004
It feels, this whole place feels to me like,

1077
00:51:18,324 --> 00:51:20,744
if they had pulled off Bountiful Valley Farm.

1078
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:23,324
I was gonna say, it's like Bountiful Valley Farm,

1079
00:51:23,544 --> 00:51:25,264
but I didn't, which I never got to experience.

1080
00:51:26,044 --> 00:51:28,124
No, I don't know if it would change your mind

1081
00:51:28,124 --> 00:51:29,284
if you experienced it. Sure.

1082
00:51:29,364 --> 00:51:31,724
Cause you know what it didn't have? Rides.

1083
00:51:31,864 --> 00:51:34,184
Yeah. It was stuff that you climb on.

1084
00:51:35,384 --> 00:51:38,464
But this place, I mean, like why not,

1085
00:51:38,984 --> 00:51:40,924
like Eisner wants his farm area.

1086
00:51:41,024 --> 00:51:41,944
Yeah. He wants to show you

1087
00:51:41,944 --> 00:51:42,924
how a farm works.

1088
00:51:43,464 --> 00:51:46,944
Okay, do that, but then have a ride that's in a big apple.

1089
00:51:47,324 --> 00:51:49,384
Right? Like why, like, and of course,

1090
00:51:49,424 --> 00:51:51,984
now I brought this up partially because

1091
00:51:51,984 --> 00:51:53,604
there was a big orange.

1092
00:51:53,624 --> 00:51:54,504
I'll give them that.

1093
00:51:54,564 --> 00:51:57,324
They did have a big orange, but it wasn't enough.

1094
00:51:57,324 --> 00:52:00,384
And also the orange stinger was confusing.

1095
00:52:00,704 --> 00:52:02,184
Why oranges and bees?

1096
00:52:02,584 --> 00:52:06,344
These things did not, those don't go together to me at all.

1097
00:52:06,564 --> 00:52:07,324
I never understood.

1098
00:52:07,544 --> 00:52:08,444
That seems like two things.

1099
00:52:08,444 --> 00:52:09,604
Why would it have been a honeycomb?

1100
00:52:10,264 --> 00:52:11,624
Yeah. Wait, yes.

1101
00:52:11,684 --> 00:52:13,664
Big honeycomb. Yeah, absolutely.

1102
00:52:14,284 --> 00:52:15,104
Yeah, I don't know.

1103
00:52:15,204 --> 00:52:15,964
No answer.

1104
00:52:16,204 --> 00:52:18,964
Why is the giant orange by the seaside pier

1105
00:52:18,964 --> 00:52:22,964
not traditionally where orange groves would be found?

1106
00:52:23,364 --> 00:52:26,344
A swing set, an unadorned swing set,

1107
00:52:26,564 --> 00:52:29,904
you just put it in a seaside pier like the golden zephyr.

1108
00:52:29,904 --> 00:52:32,264
The golden zephyr makes sense as like.

1109
00:52:32,264 --> 00:52:33,324
Well, they got it right.

1110
00:52:33,504 --> 00:52:35,144
Now it's just like, you know,

1111
00:52:35,144 --> 00:52:38,984
swing ride with nice trimming, basically.

1112
00:52:38,984 --> 00:52:39,464
Yeah, basically.

1113
00:52:39,484 --> 00:52:41,044
They figured it out, but wait,

1114
00:52:41,084 --> 00:52:43,044
I never even thought about that, that oranges,

1115
00:52:43,604 --> 00:52:45,304
you know, oranges have to be inland, right?

1116
00:52:45,484 --> 00:52:48,124
I guess oranges are consumed by the sea.

1117
00:52:48,484 --> 00:52:49,424
They wouldn't have to be.

1118
00:52:49,664 --> 00:52:52,384
But the orange groves were taking a-

1119
00:52:52,384 --> 00:52:53,444
In Anaheim. In Anaheim.

1120
00:52:53,444 --> 00:52:55,324
There was plenty in Anaheim, that's true.

1121
00:52:55,524 --> 00:53:00,004
But also you're right, like steps away from the Malibuumer.

1122
00:53:00,564 --> 00:53:02,764
Look, there was a lot of issues.

1123
00:53:03,564 --> 00:53:04,004
There was a lot.

1124
00:53:04,004 --> 00:53:04,304
There was a lot.

1125
00:53:04,384 --> 00:53:05,224
He should have put it right,

1126
00:53:05,244 --> 00:53:07,484
and I'm sure it was just like an extra 50K,

1127
00:53:07,544 --> 00:53:08,764
and he was like, that's out.

1128
00:53:08,804 --> 00:53:09,844
I think so. Save money.

1129
00:53:09,844 --> 00:53:11,284
Yeah, yeah, I think they were.

1130
00:53:11,324 --> 00:53:12,364
They were. Nothing, yeah.

1131
00:53:12,464 --> 00:53:12,884
Nickel and doubt.

1132
00:53:12,884 --> 00:53:15,404
Well, they'd put a lot of muscle into suing Chuck E. Cheese

1133
00:53:15,404 --> 00:53:17,764
for various sexual photos,

1134
00:53:17,804 --> 00:53:19,544
so didn't have a lot of left over there.

1135
00:53:19,564 --> 00:53:22,204
McDonald's bailed our ass out with this bear invasion.

1136
00:53:23,404 --> 00:53:25,004
We'd have nothing without them.

1137
00:53:25,844 --> 00:53:27,864
And then you get, you know, you're more unusual.

1138
00:53:27,924 --> 00:53:28,944
You get artichokes.

1139
00:53:28,944 --> 00:53:30,384
So you get artichoke dip.

1140
00:53:30,704 --> 00:53:33,084
You're just sitting in big artichokes that swing around.

1141
00:53:33,144 --> 00:53:34,024
Great, love it.

1142
00:53:34,024 --> 00:53:35,184
We had a great time.

1143
00:53:35,504 --> 00:53:38,544
I can't give more than sentence long reviews of these,

1144
00:53:38,584 --> 00:53:39,964
but that's not what you're supposed to do.

1145
00:53:40,084 --> 00:53:44,284
They all, they aim for a real A ticket kind of thing,

1146
00:53:44,284 --> 00:53:45,304
and they deliver.

1147
00:53:45,404 --> 00:53:46,364
It's all great.

1148
00:53:47,284 --> 00:53:49,344
And then of course, garlic twirl.

1149
00:53:49,464 --> 00:53:51,264
And this is the one that I knew about,

1150
00:53:51,264 --> 00:53:52,444
and I thought it was all gonna,

1151
00:53:52,544 --> 00:53:54,264
I thought maybe this was the only ride

1152
00:53:54,264 --> 00:53:55,724
or something was garlic twirl.

1153
00:53:55,944 --> 00:53:59,524
And this is where it is a bunch of garlic bulbs.

1154
00:54:00,064 --> 00:54:01,364
And so it's like the teacups,

1155
00:54:01,484 --> 00:54:04,904
except it's more of a little room that they lock you in.

1156
00:54:05,084 --> 00:54:07,224
That is a weird part about this park I forgot,

1157
00:54:07,584 --> 00:54:09,824
that they closed the door,

1158
00:54:09,924 --> 00:54:11,024
and then when the ride's over,

1159
00:54:11,024 --> 00:54:13,344
you try to get out and you cannot get out.

1160
00:54:13,604 --> 00:54:17,144
And then the single employee has to go around

1161
00:54:17,144 --> 00:54:20,884
with the one key that is a really weird particular shape

1162
00:54:21,384 --> 00:54:24,564
like the Ikea screws thing.

1163
00:54:24,864 --> 00:54:26,944
It's like a really odd little implement

1164
00:54:26,944 --> 00:54:29,324
that only he can let you out with.

1165
00:54:29,824 --> 00:54:30,964
Or it's kind of like, you know,

1166
00:54:31,664 --> 00:54:34,424
what gets the plastic off of liquor bottles

1167
00:54:34,424 --> 00:54:35,644
at the grocery store.

1168
00:54:35,644 --> 00:54:39,064
Oh yeah, very specific, like proprietary technology.

1169
00:54:39,404 --> 00:54:39,864
An Allen wrench.

1170
00:54:39,864 --> 00:54:40,264
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1171
00:54:40,264 --> 00:54:42,124
Like where if this guy got,

1172
00:54:42,564 --> 00:54:46,784
like if he fell in the lake or a bird came by

1173
00:54:46,784 --> 00:54:47,904
and stole that thing,

1174
00:54:48,184 --> 00:54:49,984
you might be locked in the garlic bulb for hours.

1175
00:54:49,984 --> 00:54:52,984
There might be like 10 of those in existence.

1176
00:54:52,984 --> 00:54:53,704
In the world.

1177
00:54:53,784 --> 00:54:55,484
Yeah, because that's the rarest of rare.

1178
00:54:55,604 --> 00:54:56,924
You're not going into a hardware store

1179
00:54:56,924 --> 00:54:58,124
and making a copy of that.

1180
00:54:58,224 --> 00:54:58,824
No, I don't think you could.

1181
00:54:58,824 --> 00:54:59,544
You can't copy that key.

1182
00:54:59,644 --> 00:55:00,664
I don't believe so.

1183
00:55:00,664 --> 00:55:01,064
Yeah.

1184
00:55:01,104 --> 00:55:03,584
It seems like pretty space age technology to me.

1185
00:55:03,744 --> 00:55:05,704
I mean, you should, it would be funny to try,

1186
00:55:06,084 --> 00:55:07,944
but they have all those kiosks now

1187
00:55:07,944 --> 00:55:10,704
where you can make your own key duplicates.

1188
00:55:10,924 --> 00:55:12,944
So maybe some of the Gilroy Gardens employees

1189
00:55:12,944 --> 00:55:15,484
have tried to go to those places, get duplicates,

1190
00:55:15,584 --> 00:55:17,044
so that they can.

1191
00:55:17,604 --> 00:55:18,284
Open the door.

1192
00:55:18,444 --> 00:55:19,364
They were on the clock.

1193
00:55:19,364 --> 00:55:20,784
They got a slurpee.

1194
00:55:20,864 --> 00:55:21,564
Open doors whenever they want.

1195
00:55:22,004 --> 00:55:24,584
And they try to make a copy of the Allen wrench

1196
00:55:24,584 --> 00:55:29,264
at the 7-Eleven kiosk and it immediately started smoking.

1197
00:55:30,224 --> 00:55:33,704
Does not compute a killing self.

1198
00:55:35,384 --> 00:55:37,504
So can I get a Buffalo chicken roller

1199
00:55:37,504 --> 00:55:40,824
and also your thing smoking back there?

1200
00:55:42,364 --> 00:55:46,944
So yeah, you're in big garlic bulbs and they spin around

1201
00:55:46,944 --> 00:55:47,584
and that's great.

1202
00:55:47,604 --> 00:55:50,164
That's what you want out of the garlic theme park.

1203
00:55:50,224 --> 00:55:51,124
Great, delivered.

1204
00:55:51,244 --> 00:55:54,584
I didn't like when a bumblebee flew in,

1205
00:55:55,404 --> 00:55:58,684
especially given that there were not a lot of windows

1206
00:55:58,684 --> 00:56:01,064
and things, was getting a little claustrophobic in there,

1207
00:56:01,124 --> 00:56:02,144
but it flew out right away.

1208
00:56:02,344 --> 00:56:02,984
It was fine.

1209
00:56:03,104 --> 00:56:04,124
Can I ask a quick question?

1210
00:56:04,304 --> 00:56:06,404
If these rides were more indoors,

1211
00:56:06,464 --> 00:56:07,804
would you have been afraid of the size

1212
00:56:07,804 --> 00:56:09,064
of the vegetable or fruit?

1213
00:56:09,284 --> 00:56:10,184
Oh.

1214
00:56:10,504 --> 00:56:12,104
Were they not big enough?

1215
00:56:12,124 --> 00:56:13,384
Were they not that big?

1216
00:56:14,084 --> 00:56:15,324
Maybe I would have been afraid

1217
00:56:15,324 --> 00:56:16,984
if they had faces or something.

1218
00:56:17,364 --> 00:56:19,444
Yeah, I think in and of them,

1219
00:56:19,504 --> 00:56:21,444
no, I don't think I'm afraid of a big fruit.

1220
00:56:21,924 --> 00:56:25,104
What if you could imagine the size of the strawberry

1221
00:56:25,104 --> 00:56:26,604
and it's in this garage?

1222
00:56:27,784 --> 00:56:29,144
Well, the garage is small.

1223
00:56:29,704 --> 00:56:31,444
I guess it might bother me.

1224
00:56:31,964 --> 00:56:33,404
Yeah, yeah.

1225
00:56:33,824 --> 00:56:35,304
All right, I'm gonna give you that one.

1226
00:56:35,764 --> 00:56:39,504
But I don't think the theme park is gonna end up,

1227
00:56:39,604 --> 00:56:42,924
unless they do a haunt event where you go into,

1228
00:56:42,924 --> 00:56:44,224
and they do do a Halloween event,

1229
00:56:44,224 --> 00:56:45,464
but I don't know if it has anything

1230
00:56:45,464 --> 00:56:48,824
where you end up in a small room with a big scary fruit.

1231
00:56:48,824 --> 00:56:49,964
Yeah, probably not.

1232
00:56:50,204 --> 00:56:51,144
A rotting fruit.

1233
00:56:51,524 --> 00:56:53,144
Do you ever get afraid

1234
00:56:53,144 --> 00:56:55,784
when there's the biggest pumpkin contest?

1235
00:56:56,824 --> 00:56:59,904
I haven't been to one, so maybe on some level,

1236
00:56:59,904 --> 00:57:00,944
I am afraid of them.

1237
00:57:01,024 --> 00:57:03,544
I feel like I've seen big pumpkins, but.

1238
00:57:04,024 --> 00:57:05,624
Now imagine they're in this garage with us.

1239
00:57:06,184 --> 00:57:09,644
I wouldn't like a pumpkin that mostly filled the garage, no.

1240
00:57:09,644 --> 00:57:10,004
Okay.

1241
00:57:10,184 --> 00:57:11,144
No, I wouldn't like that.

1242
00:57:12,224 --> 00:57:15,564
And maybe I will, if I ever attend a big pumpkin contest,

1243
00:57:16,264 --> 00:57:19,724
I'll try to make sure that it's in a stable type of environment

1244
00:57:19,724 --> 00:57:20,924
or a hall.

1245
00:57:21,424 --> 00:57:24,584
If I see room, and especially if I see closet,

1246
00:57:25,024 --> 00:57:26,804
no way, I'm sorry.

1247
00:57:27,364 --> 00:57:29,984
You will have to get your pumpkin money from other people.

1248
00:57:30,344 --> 00:57:30,544
Okay, that's fair.

1249
00:57:30,544 --> 00:57:32,164
Okay, well, let me ask a question.

1250
00:57:32,244 --> 00:57:34,084
What is this giant plastic orb?

1251
00:57:34,144 --> 00:57:35,164
This is not a joke.

1252
00:57:35,304 --> 00:57:36,044
Yeah, that is, I know.

1253
00:57:36,544 --> 00:57:38,724
That's been in the corner of my eye

1254
00:57:38,724 --> 00:57:39,724
the whole time we've been talking.

1255
00:57:40,324 --> 00:57:42,444
That's a litter robot that broke.

1256
00:57:43,104 --> 00:57:47,004
We have two cats, so it's a more efficient way to.

1257
00:57:47,004 --> 00:57:50,404
That is a lot more sizable than I thought those things were,

1258
00:57:50,504 --> 00:57:52,084
but I understand it.

1259
00:57:52,944 --> 00:57:55,244
You clocked what I was saying.

1260
00:57:55,244 --> 00:57:56,904
We're talking about big things in a garage,

1261
00:57:56,984 --> 00:57:58,524
and that is taking up a lot of space.

1262
00:57:58,924 --> 00:58:01,924
What would you describe in fruit or vegetable terms?

1263
00:58:01,984 --> 00:58:03,924
What does that seem like?

1264
00:58:03,924 --> 00:58:05,404
Oh, good question.

1265
00:58:06,884 --> 00:58:09,884
Well, what's pretty circular?

1266
00:58:11,084 --> 00:58:11,704
A big pea.

1267
00:58:11,904 --> 00:58:12,384
A big pea, sure.

1268
00:58:12,684 --> 00:58:12,824
A big gray pea.

1269
00:58:12,824 --> 00:58:14,504
A big pea is good, yeah.

1270
00:58:15,824 --> 00:58:18,284
A pea is probably the most circular kind of thing,

1271
00:58:18,304 --> 00:58:25,924
and it looks like it's placed on a carrier

1272
00:58:25,924 --> 00:58:27,584
or like a display of some kind.

1273
00:58:27,584 --> 00:58:30,104
This thing looks like you would load your baby in

1274
00:58:30,104 --> 00:58:31,864
and shoot, if Krypton was exploding,

1275
00:58:32,044 --> 00:58:34,784
you would load your baby in and shoot your baby off to Earth

1276
00:58:34,784 --> 00:58:36,024
to save the baby.

1277
00:58:36,044 --> 00:58:38,524
I thought maybe it was a rocking thing.

1278
00:58:38,524 --> 00:58:38,844
Space cradle.

1279
00:58:39,224 --> 00:58:42,004
Like I thought maybe, oh, they put the baby in this thing.

1280
00:58:42,004 --> 00:58:42,924
It wasn't a baby thing.

1281
00:58:43,084 --> 00:58:43,564
Yeah, yeah.

1282
00:58:43,664 --> 00:58:44,284
Rocks, yeah.

1283
00:58:44,664 --> 00:58:47,504
If you saw the other side, if I turn it around,

1284
00:58:47,504 --> 00:58:50,264
and I could if you want, but if I turn it around,

1285
00:58:50,264 --> 00:58:55,664
you would see a lot of caked on litter

1286
00:58:55,664 --> 00:59:00,144
with that's got perma pea stickiness.

1287
00:59:00,384 --> 00:59:02,484
It's not a pretty scene.

1288
00:59:02,564 --> 00:59:04,904
Thing conked out on us, so we have to figure out

1289
00:59:04,904 --> 00:59:09,944
a new pea and poo disposal situation for the cats.

1290
00:59:10,624 --> 00:59:13,304
Your correct, Mike, that it is very Superman,

1291
00:59:13,544 --> 00:59:17,824
and we had this before our child showed up,

1292
00:59:17,824 --> 00:59:19,984
and it was definitely a fear that he goes,

1293
00:59:20,264 --> 00:59:23,024
rocket ship, tries to climb in the thing.

1294
00:59:23,024 --> 00:59:23,764
Yeah, yeah.

1295
00:59:23,764 --> 00:59:26,524
And then he also then gets in and says, sandbox.

1296
00:59:27,264 --> 00:59:29,904
We assumed big time curiosity.

1297
00:59:29,944 --> 00:59:31,984
I think we had to teach him early on.

1298
00:59:31,984 --> 00:59:34,464
This is the opposite of where you should go.

1299
00:59:34,604 --> 00:59:35,124
Yeah, smart.

1300
00:59:35,424 --> 00:59:35,924
Uh-huh.

1301
00:59:36,124 --> 00:59:36,524
Yeah.

1302
00:59:36,744 --> 00:59:38,844
Well, now you know about that.

1303
00:59:39,364 --> 00:59:42,244
You know what, while I'm looking in that direction,

1304
00:59:42,704 --> 00:59:46,104
let me, I'm gonna get up towards it

1305
00:59:46,104 --> 00:59:48,344
and bring something over here,

1306
00:59:48,384 --> 00:59:51,524
and this is a specific Gilroy Gardens,

1307
00:59:52,904 --> 00:59:55,264
I think one of the best facets of the park.

1308
00:59:57,104 --> 01:00:01,024
Here I am going on about artichoke rides and garlic rides,

1309
01:00:01,044 --> 01:00:04,164
but you might be thinking these are not the rubric

1310
01:00:04,164 --> 01:00:06,924
by which we judge theme parks, right?

1311
01:00:06,924 --> 01:00:07,684
Oh, I know where you're going.

1312
01:00:08,104 --> 01:00:12,104
We judge by, I mean, one of them is IP.

1313
01:00:12,224 --> 01:00:15,164
One of them is original IP, and that can be whatever,

1314
01:00:15,404 --> 01:00:18,944
and I'm sorry to say there's no dark rides here.

1315
01:00:18,984 --> 01:00:20,944
That's a disappointment, because I think they would pull off

1316
01:00:20,944 --> 01:00:23,324
a great dark ride, given the charm of the place,

1317
01:00:23,524 --> 01:00:27,324
but there are characters, and I'm gonna go fetch the character.

1318
01:00:27,464 --> 01:00:29,844
Yeah, I was hoping.

1319
01:00:30,244 --> 01:00:31,704
There he is.

1320
01:00:32,384 --> 01:00:35,044
Gil, the Gilroy garlic.

1321
01:00:35,124 --> 01:00:35,864
Wow.

1322
01:00:36,124 --> 01:00:37,464
Look at this guy.

1323
01:00:37,744 --> 01:00:38,864
Look at his sunglasses.

1324
01:00:39,344 --> 01:00:44,964
He, it is, he's a big garlic bulb wearing sunglasses,

1325
01:00:45,224 --> 01:00:50,004
and he's got a big smile, and until I was really analyzing,

1326
01:00:50,864 --> 01:00:52,884
why do I like him so much?

1327
01:00:52,924 --> 01:00:55,844
I really like him, and I saw photos of him,

1328
01:00:55,844 --> 01:00:58,284
and I thought, yeah, that looks a little stupid,

1329
01:00:58,284 --> 01:01:00,024
and then when I saw the toy,

1330
01:01:00,264 --> 01:01:02,484
I thought there's nothing stupid about this.

1331
01:01:02,664 --> 01:01:06,144
I really like him, and I think in analyzing it,

1332
01:01:06,484 --> 01:01:09,824
he's very Kool-Aid man, right?

1333
01:01:10,264 --> 01:01:10,544
Yeah.

1334
01:01:10,844 --> 01:01:16,224
Sunglasses, smile, big bulbous guy, big seat.

1335
01:01:16,564 --> 01:01:17,904
He's got a massive seat.

1336
01:01:18,064 --> 01:01:21,824
He's a rotund fella, but then kind of, you know,

1337
01:01:22,304 --> 01:01:24,664
it's whittled down to nothing up at the top.

1338
01:01:25,164 --> 01:01:28,684
Then he's just got like a burst of hair or leaves,

1339
01:01:30,284 --> 01:01:32,564
or a peel, I guess, whatever you wanna call it.

1340
01:01:32,584 --> 01:01:35,364
He's very 90s, I would say, in general.

1341
01:01:35,524 --> 01:01:39,484
That's the vibe from him, and that's why I'm so drawn to him

1342
01:01:39,484 --> 01:01:40,864
and his features immediately.

1343
01:01:41,144 --> 01:01:43,284
He, the first thing I thought of was cool spot.

1344
01:01:44,724 --> 01:01:45,304
Yeah.

1345
01:01:45,704 --> 01:01:46,444
Oh, the 7-Up.

1346
01:01:46,764 --> 01:01:47,464
Yeah, 7-Up.

1347
01:01:47,484 --> 01:01:49,424
Absolutely, for sure.

1348
01:01:49,964 --> 01:01:51,824
Just, you're right that it's very 90s,

1349
01:01:51,884 --> 01:01:53,284
where all you had to do in the 90s

1350
01:01:53,284 --> 01:01:55,644
is put a mouth and sunglasses on something,

1351
01:01:56,564 --> 01:01:57,504
and great, and you love him.

1352
01:01:57,684 --> 01:02:00,604
That's all it, it's like a couple of lines.

1353
01:02:00,724 --> 01:02:03,864
How few lines can we use to make you love

1354
01:02:03,864 --> 01:02:04,884
an inanimate object?

1355
01:02:04,944 --> 01:02:05,544
Right, right.

1356
01:02:05,744 --> 01:02:07,724
Let me throw him to you, because he is satisfying

1357
01:02:07,724 --> 01:02:08,144
to throw.

1358
01:02:08,204 --> 01:02:10,984
The way the limbs dangle on this toy,

1359
01:02:11,084 --> 01:02:13,264
I've been throwing him with the boy ever since.

1360
01:02:13,264 --> 01:02:15,124
Does he have, actually, I missed this,

1361
01:02:15,144 --> 01:02:16,924
does he talk at all in the park?

1362
01:02:17,304 --> 01:02:20,724
I did not see any, unless there is a show

1363
01:02:20,764 --> 01:02:23,144
that I'm not aware of, and if any listeners

1364
01:02:23,144 --> 01:02:25,964
are Gilroy Garden's heads, please make me aware,

1365
01:02:25,964 --> 01:02:28,504
because I would love to know what this guy sounds like.

1366
01:02:28,504 --> 01:02:31,644
You know what, he also reminds me of what are those little,

1367
01:02:31,944 --> 01:02:35,064
are they books, like Mr. Happy and Mr. Angry?

1368
01:02:35,924 --> 01:02:37,644
Those little small kids books.

1369
01:02:38,604 --> 01:02:41,104
And now, I'm gonna find out what they're called,

1370
01:02:41,144 --> 01:02:43,124
and then I'm gonna say that I've recently seen them

1371
01:02:43,124 --> 01:02:46,324
try to rebrand those as memes in a Walmart.

1372
01:02:47,364 --> 01:02:48,384
We were going up.

1373
01:02:48,384 --> 01:02:51,024
Aren't they the original emojis, right?

1374
01:02:51,084 --> 01:02:51,204
Yes.

1375
01:02:51,204 --> 01:02:51,704
Aren't they?

1376
01:02:51,804 --> 01:02:54,084
I've seen them as memes on Instagram.

1377
01:02:54,724 --> 01:02:55,084
Yeah.

1378
01:02:55,084 --> 01:02:56,664
It's, I don't know.

1379
01:02:56,984 --> 01:02:57,024
Mr. Angry?

1380
01:02:57,024 --> 01:02:59,664
I believe there maybe was a point in time

1381
01:02:59,664 --> 01:03:01,684
where they were gonna make a movie out of those.

1382
01:03:01,684 --> 01:03:02,904
Oh, I'm sure that's the case.

1383
01:03:03,504 --> 01:03:04,704
Mr. Yuck, is that one of them?

1384
01:03:04,704 --> 01:03:04,944
Yeah.

1385
01:03:04,944 --> 01:03:06,884
Or that's the poison control guy.

1386
01:03:06,884 --> 01:03:07,684
That's the guy.

1387
01:03:09,004 --> 01:03:10,144
Oh, have we done that episode?

1388
01:03:10,144 --> 01:03:11,024
This is very funny.

1389
01:03:11,024 --> 01:03:11,444
Mr. Yuck.

1390
01:03:11,484 --> 01:03:12,284
Counts, great.

1391
01:03:12,504 --> 01:03:15,924
The sunglasses are kind of hinged on some fabric,

1392
01:03:16,604 --> 01:03:18,964
and you pull them up and there's no eyes.

1393
01:03:19,044 --> 01:03:21,224
Yes, really weird, right?

1394
01:03:21,764 --> 01:03:22,584
Yeah, you got nothing.

1395
01:03:22,624 --> 01:03:23,664
There's not even dots.

1396
01:03:23,864 --> 01:03:25,284
You got absolutely nothing.

1397
01:03:25,464 --> 01:03:31,564
It makes him very strange looking, just like zero.

1398
01:03:31,724 --> 01:03:33,404
They saved some money not putting the dots there.

1399
01:03:33,424 --> 01:03:34,464
What does he do?

1400
01:03:34,764 --> 01:03:38,084
What does he do with zero with nothing representing eyes?

1401
01:03:39,404 --> 01:03:42,024
Yeah, my son's in an age where we're throwing plushes

1402
01:03:42,024 --> 01:03:43,804
all the time, and this is the most throwable.

1403
01:03:43,804 --> 01:03:48,724
Also, the limbs are just so satisfying to wave around.

1404
01:03:49,204 --> 01:03:50,904
I was having him fart a lot too.

1405
01:03:51,244 --> 01:03:52,384
We got a lot of farts going on,

1406
01:03:52,384 --> 01:03:56,184
so I know there was a lot of like, toot, toot.

1407
01:03:56,464 --> 01:03:57,864
That's what he's, yeah, yeah.

1408
01:03:57,864 --> 01:03:58,504
Is that his voice?

1409
01:03:58,684 --> 01:04:00,224
Yeah, toot, toot.

1410
01:04:00,644 --> 01:04:02,264
Does it, I don't know, does it add up

1411
01:04:02,264 --> 01:04:05,344
that a garlic guy would fart a lot?

1412
01:04:05,344 --> 01:04:06,384
Because he makes people fart?

1413
01:04:06,464 --> 01:04:09,904
I don't know if garlic makes, I guess depending

1414
01:04:09,904 --> 01:04:13,304
on your tolerance or your particular stomach, he might.

1415
01:04:13,304 --> 01:04:14,044
Well, it depends.

1416
01:04:14,204 --> 01:04:16,424
I mean, if a garlic, if an anthropomorphic garlic

1417
01:04:16,424 --> 01:04:19,364
is sort of brought to life by magic,

1418
01:04:20,044 --> 01:04:21,784
then I feel like maybe he doesn't fart,

1419
01:04:21,804 --> 01:04:25,164
but if there's, he actually has like a lower GI

1420
01:04:25,164 --> 01:04:27,164
and upper GI, like if he has a tract

1421
01:04:27,164 --> 01:04:30,344
and he actually has a bio, like there's a biological reason.

1422
01:04:30,344 --> 01:04:31,084
Wait, GI, what's GI?

1423
01:04:31,184 --> 01:04:33,164
I don't know, that's what the doctors say, right?

1424
01:04:33,164 --> 01:04:35,824
When they're talking about your intestines and stuff.

1425
01:04:36,164 --> 01:04:38,304
Yeah, I was gonna say, is garlic a thing?

1426
01:04:38,444 --> 01:04:39,244
Is it acidic?

1427
01:04:39,364 --> 01:04:41,504
Is that an acid reflux one?

1428
01:04:42,004 --> 01:04:43,004
For having garlic?

1429
01:04:43,204 --> 01:04:44,764
Oh yeah, maybe.

1430
01:04:45,664 --> 01:04:47,184
I'm gonna have to look up GI now.

1431
01:04:47,404 --> 01:04:50,224
Because I have learned that I am kind of susceptible

1432
01:04:50,224 --> 01:04:53,584
to like all the delicious high acidity foods,

1433
01:04:53,804 --> 01:04:58,264
tomato sauce, hot tea, hot coffee, you know.

1434
01:04:59,204 --> 01:04:59,844
Yeah, they can really.

1435
01:04:59,844 --> 01:05:00,244
I have some of that.

1436
01:05:00,564 --> 01:05:01,424
Wait, what are you saying?

1437
01:05:01,504 --> 01:05:03,044
Do they make you toot?

1438
01:05:03,664 --> 01:05:06,484
No, not really, much of a tooter.

1439
01:05:07,044 --> 01:05:10,024
Gil, get off the mic, don't call Jason a tooter.

1440
01:05:10,084 --> 01:05:11,044
He's not a tooter.

1441
01:05:11,044 --> 01:05:12,804
It's kind of a constant burning.

1442
01:05:13,004 --> 01:05:15,344
Oh yeah, no, this guy don't look like a tooter to me.

1443
01:05:15,664 --> 01:05:15,944
Yeah, okay.

1444
01:05:16,084 --> 01:05:18,684
Toot, no, that was you, I know that was you.

1445
01:05:19,344 --> 01:05:21,104
I know when you're talking.

1446
01:05:21,184 --> 01:05:23,424
This guy's got a 90s attitude too.

1447
01:05:23,484 --> 01:05:23,964
Yeah.

1448
01:05:24,104 --> 01:05:25,184
I'll say that.

1449
01:05:25,324 --> 01:05:26,704
Yeah, what can I say?

1450
01:05:27,824 --> 01:05:31,384
You know, before I had shades, not much attitude.

1451
01:05:31,824 --> 01:05:33,504
Also couldn't see at all.

1452
01:05:33,844 --> 01:05:37,224
Kind of put me in my place, I just sort of like rolled around,

1453
01:05:37,504 --> 01:05:41,044
couldn't get up or do anything or know what my life was.

1454
01:05:41,144 --> 01:05:43,124
But ever since I got these shades.

1455
01:05:43,504 --> 01:05:45,824
I'm a regular on Tough Trail with Gung Win.

1456
01:05:48,364 --> 01:05:51,824
Yeah, me and Norton, we'd get into some pretty big rift fests.

1457
01:05:52,444 --> 01:05:55,204
I was in the wet whack pack for a week, it didn't work out.

1458
01:05:55,484 --> 01:05:57,424
You know, it was a lot of fun, you know.

1459
01:05:59,684 --> 01:06:01,244
Let me add a morbid question

1460
01:06:01,244 --> 01:06:03,324
as you're holding the stuffed garlic.

1461
01:06:03,444 --> 01:06:05,424
Did you try the garlic fries?

1462
01:06:05,744 --> 01:06:06,784
I did not actually.

1463
01:06:06,784 --> 01:06:08,424
I heard that was a thing to get.

1464
01:06:08,864 --> 01:06:11,924
It seemed like the theme park food there was a lot of fried stuff,

1465
01:06:11,924 --> 01:06:13,084
a lot of bakery stuff.

1466
01:06:13,244 --> 01:06:15,324
Oh, I think this guy tried some earlier too.

1467
01:06:16,144 --> 01:06:17,004
Gil, stop.

1468
01:06:17,224 --> 01:06:19,404
No, I did not have garlic fries.

1469
01:06:19,924 --> 01:06:22,984
Those my current farts that are filling up the garage

1470
01:06:22,984 --> 01:06:24,344
are from other foods.

1471
01:06:24,344 --> 01:06:25,024
Different foods.

1472
01:06:25,104 --> 01:06:25,844
Healthier foods.

1473
01:06:26,604 --> 01:06:28,224
GI means gastrointestinal.

1474
01:06:28,224 --> 01:06:28,864
Oh, OK.

1475
01:06:28,964 --> 01:06:29,244
Yeah.

1476
01:06:29,244 --> 01:06:30,004
Oh, I should have known.

1477
01:06:30,104 --> 01:06:31,064
That should have known.

1478
01:06:31,184 --> 01:06:32,424
I mean, I should have known too.

1479
01:06:32,564 --> 01:06:34,224
You all should have known, you idiots.

1480
01:06:34,844 --> 01:06:35,364
Oh.

1481
01:06:35,604 --> 01:06:40,024
It feels like Will Arnett should play him in a big budget film.

1482
01:06:41,444 --> 01:06:43,644
Hey, this is Gil at CyberMedia 94.

1483
01:06:43,904 --> 01:06:46,264
Everybody's going nuts for NBA Jam up here.

1484
01:06:46,404 --> 01:06:47,144
Hey, cool it, kids.

1485
01:06:47,144 --> 01:06:48,144
Young Will Arnett.

1486
01:06:49,524 --> 01:06:52,384
An AI recreation of 24-year-old Will Arnett

1487
01:06:52,384 --> 01:06:54,524
should do the voice of Gil.

1488
01:06:55,444 --> 01:06:55,624
Right?

1489
01:06:55,664 --> 01:06:56,344
His name is Gil?

1490
01:06:57,164 --> 01:06:58,144
Yeah, Gil, that's right.

1491
01:06:58,144 --> 01:06:58,804
Gilroy, yeah.

1492
01:06:58,804 --> 01:06:59,244
Yeah, yeah.

1493
01:06:59,324 --> 01:06:59,884
Gilroy garlic.

1494
01:07:00,204 --> 01:07:00,684
Mm-hmm.

1495
01:07:00,684 --> 01:07:02,484
And don't forget my catchphrase, dude.

1496
01:07:04,644 --> 01:07:08,264
I also, my son has been, my son just started calling this guy

1497
01:07:08,264 --> 01:07:09,024
White Guy.

1498
01:07:09,384 --> 01:07:10,244
That's what he's been.

1499
01:07:11,204 --> 01:07:12,964
Throw White Guy.

1500
01:07:13,464 --> 01:07:15,204
And I don't have the heart to tell him

1501
01:07:15,204 --> 01:07:18,924
that White Guy has just, doesn't have the best ring to it.

1502
01:07:18,924 --> 01:07:19,484
Yeah, yeah.

1503
01:07:19,484 --> 01:07:20,204
These days.

1504
01:07:21,064 --> 01:07:22,144
Well, these days.

1505
01:07:23,244 --> 01:07:27,384
It's not something anybody is, I'm certainly proud to be.

1506
01:07:28,004 --> 01:07:28,724
Or should you be?

1507
01:07:28,944 --> 01:07:30,524
From the mouths of babes, you know.

1508
01:07:32,124 --> 01:07:32,564
To him.

1509
01:07:33,164 --> 01:07:35,324
Well, yeah, when you hear the phrase White Guy,

1510
01:07:35,404 --> 01:07:36,784
you probably conjure some bad stuff.

1511
01:07:37,064 --> 01:07:42,464
But to him, if you reset and a White Guy is just this cool

1512
01:07:42,464 --> 01:07:43,824
garlic and sunglasses.

1513
01:07:44,044 --> 01:07:45,124
Yeah, yeah, that's true.

1514
01:07:46,144 --> 01:07:46,644
Cool White Guy.

1515
01:07:47,524 --> 01:07:48,624
He knows his colors.

1516
01:07:49,844 --> 01:07:51,224
He does, yes, he is correct.

1517
01:07:52,824 --> 01:07:53,764
Gil's got a girlfriend.

1518
01:07:54,104 --> 01:07:56,524
I assume they're together, or at least a female equivalent.

1519
01:07:57,004 --> 01:07:58,364
It's the same mini relationship that

1520
01:07:58,384 --> 01:08:01,664
you can change it depending on what your needs are for a story

1521
01:08:01,664 --> 01:08:02,524
or something.

1522
01:08:02,644 --> 01:08:04,044
Oh, we fuck.

1523
01:08:05,544 --> 01:08:06,644
As a friend with benefits.

1524
01:08:09,084 --> 01:08:11,644
So situationship, I learned that term recently.

1525
01:08:11,844 --> 01:08:15,564
It's fairly not desirable.

1526
01:08:16,104 --> 01:08:16,864
What is it?

1527
01:08:16,864 --> 01:08:17,324
What does it mean?

1528
01:08:17,344 --> 01:08:21,464
I think it's like friends with benefits, nothing serious

1529
01:08:21,464 --> 01:08:22,364
kind of thing.

1530
01:08:22,924 --> 01:08:23,764
Situationship?

1531
01:08:24,804 --> 01:08:26,464
I'm going to look it up to correct myself.

1532
01:08:26,464 --> 01:08:29,624
Sorry if anyone's had to deal with that and it was unpleasant.

1533
01:08:29,684 --> 01:08:31,684
Don't want to just be flipping.

1534
01:08:32,064 --> 01:08:33,964
I've been flourishing my situationship.

1535
01:08:34,124 --> 01:08:36,924
And then this podcast that I listen to says that it's not

1536
01:08:36,924 --> 01:08:39,364
something that is beautiful.

1537
01:08:40,264 --> 01:08:43,464
The funny thing about that is just the elevated term for it.

1538
01:08:43,644 --> 01:08:44,044
That's all.

1539
01:08:44,224 --> 01:08:44,944
I'm not even judging.

1540
01:08:45,144 --> 01:08:47,424
Ship is a dressing up that I don't think it deserves.

1541
01:08:47,604 --> 01:08:50,884
Look, maybe now I'm getting into club random territory.

1542
01:08:50,944 --> 01:08:52,944
But then there's also a phrase I've heard recently too.

1543
01:08:53,244 --> 01:08:57,984
Ethical non monogamy is the phrase that is on a lot of.

1544
01:08:58,164 --> 01:09:00,924
Well, I'm an old man who just learned about it, Jason.

1545
01:09:01,344 --> 01:09:04,604
But again, these are very elevated terms for like, I want to have

1546
01:09:04,604 --> 01:09:06,104
sex with other people too.

1547
01:09:06,504 --> 01:09:09,484
I've been doing ethical monogamy for years.

1548
01:09:09,904 --> 01:09:10,804
Non monogamy.

1549
01:09:11,644 --> 01:09:16,124
I don't perform ethical non monogamy with my wife.

1550
01:09:17,684 --> 01:09:21,324
On our colorful array of classic characters.

1551
01:09:21,324 --> 01:09:25,144
I do not have a situationship with Minnie Mouse, Daisy Duck,

1552
01:09:25,364 --> 01:09:26,704
or Claire Bellacal.

1553
01:09:27,224 --> 01:09:30,484
Situationships can be defined as a romantic relationship

1554
01:09:30,484 --> 01:09:33,304
that lacks commitment and the associated norms

1555
01:09:33,304 --> 01:09:34,744
and expectations.

1556
01:09:35,004 --> 01:09:38,124
That's from Women's Health 11 Signs.

1557
01:09:38,304 --> 01:09:40,464
You might be in a situationship.

1558
01:09:41,524 --> 01:09:43,824
11 signs you're in a situationship

1559
01:09:43,824 --> 01:09:45,924
and how to handle it like a dating pro.

1560
01:09:46,284 --> 01:09:48,784
That's definitely going to be a TV show in the next six months.

1561
01:09:48,884 --> 01:09:49,604
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1562
01:09:50,304 --> 01:09:53,464
Situationship and then how quickly can they sell that

1563
01:09:53,464 --> 01:09:58,324
and then how quickly will it be on CBS and then gone after one season?

1564
01:09:58,324 --> 01:09:59,204
Yeah, sure.

1565
01:09:59,504 --> 01:10:03,184
How much money will they spend on one season of situationship

1566
01:10:03,184 --> 01:10:05,144
that will never be watched by anyone again?

1567
01:10:05,384 --> 01:10:06,164
I mean, a lot.

1568
01:10:06,264 --> 01:10:08,304
You know what Josh Radner's great is?

1569
01:10:08,464 --> 01:10:09,444
I mean, goddamn.

1570
01:10:09,824 --> 01:10:10,824
Who's Josh Radner?

1571
01:10:11,064 --> 01:10:13,224
Wasn't he the star of How I Met Your Mother?

1572
01:10:14,044 --> 01:10:15,184
I don't know.

1573
01:10:15,444 --> 01:10:16,804
Is that a man's name?

1574
01:10:17,364 --> 01:10:18,144
Forgive me.

1575
01:10:18,404 --> 01:10:20,464
I was not a watcher of this program.

1576
01:10:20,464 --> 01:10:21,664
Or not.

1577
01:10:21,804 --> 01:10:22,704
He's not father.

1578
01:10:22,804 --> 01:10:23,944
He's How I Met Your Mother.

1579
01:10:28,024 --> 01:10:29,364
He was the star.

1580
01:10:29,764 --> 01:10:31,144
I think Neil Patrick Harris.

1581
01:10:32,064 --> 01:10:35,584
Yeah, Josh Radner, Jason Sego, Colby Smulders, Neil Patrick Harris.

1582
01:10:35,884 --> 01:10:36,564
Sal Sinclair.

1583
01:10:36,944 --> 01:10:38,904
I know now the names of the other people.

1584
01:10:38,904 --> 01:10:40,244
Kristen Milati later on.

1585
01:10:40,244 --> 01:10:42,204
I didn't know her name, but I knew the other names.

1586
01:10:42,324 --> 01:10:43,644
I just didn't know Josh Radner's name.

1587
01:10:43,824 --> 01:10:44,304
I apologize.

1588
01:10:44,324 --> 01:10:46,464
What I meant was his quote is probably very high now

1589
01:10:46,904 --> 01:10:49,364
after heading up a very popular show.

1590
01:10:49,864 --> 01:10:50,124
You know?

1591
01:10:50,444 --> 01:10:53,564
Well, and to play a character with kind of mixed likeability,

1592
01:10:53,724 --> 01:10:56,004
like somebody willing to be in a situationship.

1593
01:10:56,064 --> 01:10:56,504
Yeah, right.

1594
01:10:56,544 --> 01:10:58,524
Well, then that's why we have to go to somebody who's cheaper,

1595
01:10:58,624 --> 01:11:00,144
like a Jason Sheridan.

1596
01:11:00,424 --> 01:11:01,844
Jason Sheridan is.

1597
01:11:01,844 --> 01:11:02,164
Oh, our first scale.

1598
01:11:03,784 --> 01:11:06,084
The first CBS sitcom star.

1599
01:11:06,084 --> 01:11:07,404
Situationship.

1600
01:11:07,884 --> 01:11:11,684
Jason is in a situationship practicing ethical nonmonogamy.

1601
01:11:12,144 --> 01:11:15,844
And it's 8 p.m. on CBS on Thursday night.

1602
01:11:15,844 --> 01:11:17,524
As long as you make it clear.

1603
01:11:17,644 --> 01:11:18,164
Oh, yeah, you're playing.

1604
01:11:18,164 --> 01:11:19,184
That is on TV.

1605
01:11:19,784 --> 01:11:21,224
I mean, a committed relationship in reality.

1606
01:11:21,224 --> 01:11:22,524
This is a TV show.

1607
01:11:22,624 --> 01:11:22,924
Oh, yeah.

1608
01:11:22,924 --> 01:11:24,824
You're playing Jason Sheridan, though, on the show.

1609
01:11:25,024 --> 01:11:25,624
Oh, OK.

1610
01:11:25,784 --> 01:11:26,564
That's your name.

1611
01:11:27,044 --> 01:11:28,004
But let me ask you this.

1612
01:11:28,224 --> 01:11:30,484
On your way to a committed relationship,

1613
01:11:30,644 --> 01:11:34,144
was there ever a window, be it a day or a week or a month,

1614
01:11:34,284 --> 01:11:36,564
or who knows, where you would have defined

1615
01:11:36,564 --> 01:11:39,184
this relationship as a situationship?

1616
01:11:39,204 --> 01:11:40,124
Was it ever a situationship?

1617
01:11:40,124 --> 01:11:42,444
Because we may have all, Lindsay and Erin,

1618
01:11:42,644 --> 01:11:45,324
but there was probably maybe just an afternoon

1619
01:11:45,324 --> 01:11:47,644
where you're like, well, for the sake of, you know what?

1620
01:11:47,744 --> 01:11:48,864
I think it's a situationship.

1621
01:11:48,924 --> 01:11:50,664
For the sake of the public record, no, it was always

1622
01:11:50,664 --> 01:11:53,004
a very specific, defined thing.

1623
01:11:53,464 --> 01:11:55,444
That's what I'm going to say while we're talking

1624
01:11:55,444 --> 01:11:56,664
on microphones that are being recorded.

1625
01:11:56,884 --> 01:11:57,764
This was your wife.

1626
01:11:58,004 --> 01:12:00,364
I think, yeah, we didn't.

1627
01:12:01,184 --> 01:12:04,064
We we got serious reasonably quickly.

1628
01:12:04,344 --> 01:12:06,904
We didn't really see any other people, but we were.

1629
01:12:07,524 --> 01:12:09,524
It was a little casual to start.

1630
01:12:09,584 --> 01:12:09,864
Sure.

1631
01:12:09,884 --> 01:12:11,804
So it was ethical monogamy.

1632
01:12:12,544 --> 01:12:14,424
I yeah, I think so.

1633
01:12:14,424 --> 01:12:18,064
I think it was a bunch of a couple of real neurotic little

1634
01:12:18,064 --> 01:12:19,764
weirdos trying to figure it out.

1635
01:12:20,264 --> 01:12:21,004
But yeah.

1636
01:12:21,004 --> 01:12:22,164
Always ethical.

1637
01:12:22,744 --> 01:12:23,224
You make sure.

1638
01:12:23,664 --> 01:12:25,584
I pride myself.

1639
01:12:25,744 --> 01:12:27,724
I'm a very ethical person, honestly.

1640
01:12:28,924 --> 01:12:29,184
Very.

1641
01:12:29,324 --> 01:12:31,324
Well, there are people who are going to learn all about it

1642
01:12:31,324 --> 01:12:34,744
at 8 PM on CBS on Thursday nights.

1643
01:12:34,884 --> 01:12:39,664
And yet, can't you like, you know that anyone who goes out

1644
01:12:39,664 --> 01:12:43,624
of their way to like tweet, see, I practice ethical monogamy.

1645
01:12:43,724 --> 01:12:46,904
You know, that person does not do it.

1646
01:12:46,904 --> 01:12:48,504
Or would not be not.

1647
01:12:48,884 --> 01:12:49,324
No, no, no.

1648
01:12:49,324 --> 01:12:51,944
I think if you brag about it like, no, I don't know.

1649
01:12:52,024 --> 01:12:53,664
I guess I just mean it's just the way I was raised.

1650
01:12:53,704 --> 01:12:55,464
I guess I believe in ethical monogamy.

1651
01:12:55,824 --> 01:12:59,024
That person has so many fairs.

1652
01:12:59,024 --> 01:13:01,704
Well, that's true because because because no one's even

1653
01:13:01,704 --> 01:13:03,304
asking about is your monogamy.

1654
01:13:03,404 --> 01:13:04,344
Yes, that's what I'm saying.

1655
01:13:04,364 --> 01:13:06,804
If you go out of your way, if you've just tweeted that

1656
01:13:06,804 --> 01:13:09,924
unprompted or said it in a conversation or on a date.

1657
01:13:10,764 --> 01:13:11,724
That's a red flag.

1658
01:13:11,824 --> 01:13:12,144
Yes.

1659
01:13:12,364 --> 01:13:15,004
John, this person is a sex addict.

1660
01:13:15,164 --> 01:13:16,464
That's like the John Lovett's character.

1661
01:13:16,524 --> 01:13:18,244
The liar would say that.

1662
01:13:18,244 --> 01:13:18,764
Yeah.

1663
01:13:19,204 --> 01:13:25,824
Anyway, I believe ethical monogamy with Roy or Royale.

1664
01:13:25,924 --> 01:13:27,324
It's Gil and Roy.

1665
01:13:27,664 --> 01:13:28,424
Right.

1666
01:13:28,764 --> 01:13:30,824
And Roy is defined as a tomboy.

1667
01:13:30,824 --> 01:13:32,084
OK, that's the name.

1668
01:13:32,144 --> 01:13:34,124
That's how they backed into Roy.

1669
01:13:34,204 --> 01:13:35,084
What's the full name?

1670
01:13:35,424 --> 01:13:35,564
Roy.

1671
01:13:36,004 --> 01:13:36,304
Gil Roy.

1672
01:13:36,484 --> 01:13:37,464
Royale.

1673
01:13:37,664 --> 01:13:38,204
Oh, Royale.

1674
01:13:38,204 --> 01:13:38,744
You said it.

1675
01:13:38,964 --> 01:13:39,104
OK.

1676
01:13:39,304 --> 01:13:39,824
Mm hmm.

1677
01:13:40,004 --> 01:13:40,264
OK.

1678
01:13:40,744 --> 01:13:45,264
Royale or Roy like R.O.Y.

1679
01:13:45,364 --> 01:13:46,824
E.L.L.E.

1680
01:13:47,284 --> 01:13:47,884
Oh, OK.

1681
01:13:48,144 --> 01:13:50,924
Royale. I've never heard that name like a Royale with cheese,

1682
01:13:50,924 --> 01:13:51,924
you know, in France.

1683
01:13:53,724 --> 01:13:54,044
Yeah.

1684
01:13:55,544 --> 01:13:58,544
Anyway, is this this original IP is good.

1685
01:13:58,984 --> 01:14:00,064
There's Halloween stuff.

1686
01:14:00,224 --> 01:14:03,964
They have I didn't watch a lot of these shows, but they got Wolfgang

1687
01:14:03,964 --> 01:14:06,564
Werewolf and Cranium, the mad scientist.

1688
01:14:06,564 --> 01:14:07,944
We got a lot of their events.

1689
01:14:07,984 --> 01:14:09,364
The great big boo.

1690
01:14:09,444 --> 01:14:09,984
Yeah.

1691
01:14:10,084 --> 01:14:11,484
Seems very charming.

1692
01:14:11,584 --> 01:14:13,904
That would be the time to go back up as Halloween time.

1693
01:14:14,184 --> 01:14:15,144
I would really like to.

1694
01:14:15,264 --> 01:14:15,664
And you know what?

1695
01:14:15,824 --> 01:14:17,704
And you know, they and of course, this is the kind of place that does

1696
01:14:17,704 --> 01:14:19,604
like the Christmas lights event.

1697
01:14:19,964 --> 01:14:23,884
If I was up there, if I was within an hour of this place, membership,

1698
01:14:24,084 --> 01:14:27,484
annual pass, whatever, I'm going to every special event.

1699
01:14:27,764 --> 01:14:29,744
Really wish I was I was there.

1700
01:14:29,884 --> 01:14:30,824
That's it. It's lovely.

1701
01:14:31,204 --> 01:14:31,584
Sure.

1702
01:14:32,024 --> 01:14:33,024
Do any other?

1703
01:14:33,324 --> 01:14:36,844
I did you get a chance to do the these look pretty cool.

1704
01:14:36,904 --> 01:14:38,424
There are a lot of modes of transit.

1705
01:14:38,424 --> 01:14:40,984
Did you do the Rainbow Garden round boats?

1706
01:14:41,304 --> 01:14:47,384
Yes, that is one of the most pleasant rides I've ever that also that one has me

1707
01:14:47,384 --> 01:14:48,884
that that almost felt to me.

1708
01:14:48,884 --> 01:14:51,804
I was thinking while I was on it, this is like a tunnel of love

1709
01:14:51,804 --> 01:14:54,224
that doesn't go through a tunnel.

1710
01:14:54,224 --> 01:14:56,424
Yeah. And there's no love.

1711
01:14:56,664 --> 01:15:00,164
Is it now it's on their big lake and it's just kind of a little.

1712
01:15:00,264 --> 01:15:05,464
It's like a rapids ride that doesn't really that is not raucous at all.

1713
01:15:05,464 --> 01:15:06,564
It is so gentle.

1714
01:15:06,564 --> 01:15:09,824
You just like slowly spin your way down this little path.

1715
01:15:10,024 --> 01:15:11,404
And it is so serene.

1716
01:15:11,524 --> 01:15:12,704
I know this sounds nothing.

1717
01:15:13,004 --> 01:15:14,684
That sounds like nothing as I'm saying it.

1718
01:15:14,684 --> 01:15:18,044
But I'm so glad you brought that one up as one of most pleasant rides.

1719
01:15:18,324 --> 01:15:22,064
And I was also thinking in the line how this is an episode we never did.

1720
01:15:22,084 --> 01:15:23,504
This is this would be a great podcast.

1721
01:15:23,524 --> 01:15:25,884
The ride, I think the tunnel of love.

1722
01:15:25,944 --> 01:15:27,704
Yeah. For Valentine's Day.

1723
01:15:27,804 --> 01:15:30,564
I think we floated this once. Really? Once.

1724
01:15:30,704 --> 01:15:33,444
But never obviously did it because I because the tunnel of love to me

1725
01:15:33,444 --> 01:15:35,384
is one of those room like

1726
01:15:35,984 --> 01:15:39,364
movies and TV for a long time would have you believe

1727
01:15:39,364 --> 01:15:43,324
that there are 100 tunnels of love in the world.

1728
01:15:43,764 --> 01:15:45,124
Are there two?

1729
01:15:45,224 --> 01:15:45,864
It's a good question.

1730
01:15:46,404 --> 01:15:48,284
Often like where did this come from?

1731
01:15:48,524 --> 01:15:51,224
Was there ever a time where there were lots of tunnels of love?

1732
01:15:51,464 --> 01:15:54,024
Because have you ever been in a place with a tunnel of love?

1733
01:15:54,284 --> 01:15:55,704
I think this is like a fake idea.

1734
01:15:55,704 --> 01:15:57,584
I don't think I have. Yeah. Maybe once.

1735
01:15:57,684 --> 01:16:03,204
I know the the appeal of the very dark boat ride,

1736
01:16:03,604 --> 01:16:08,484
I think was part of the appeal of the old mill at Kennywood,

1737
01:16:08,544 --> 01:16:10,564
which became Garfield's nightmare.

1738
01:16:11,164 --> 01:16:12,444
Did they? That's what's been in my head.

1739
01:16:12,604 --> 01:16:14,864
Did Kennywood have a tunnel of love?

1740
01:16:15,024 --> 01:16:17,904
I don't. I feel like it was just called the old mill.

1741
01:16:18,004 --> 01:16:21,744
OK. For, you know, it was an enclosed boat ride.

1742
01:16:22,444 --> 01:16:25,184
Then eventually they put big flats of Garfield in there.

1743
01:16:25,384 --> 01:16:27,924
Yes. Yeah. Garfield freaking the hell out.

1744
01:16:28,144 --> 01:16:30,144
Sodas. Yeah. Yeah.

1745
01:16:30,364 --> 01:16:32,544
Pizza. Terrifying.

1746
01:16:33,984 --> 01:16:37,484
But yeah, we should dig into that because it also the idea

1747
01:16:37,484 --> 01:16:42,204
that something like that would be romantic to anyone as portrayed

1748
01:16:42,204 --> 01:16:47,024
in media that there's like cupids and you go through hearts.

1749
01:16:47,024 --> 01:16:51,184
Yeah. What is the inside it that makes you feel romantic is a flat of cup.

1750
01:16:51,224 --> 01:16:55,184
Like a picture of cupid is what that's certainly what I always know.

1751
01:16:55,184 --> 01:16:57,944
See. And like, but it feels like it's only in cartoons.

1752
01:16:57,944 --> 01:17:01,224
Only to set up like scenarios. Yeah.

1753
01:17:01,224 --> 01:17:05,984
You know, I think at the in the past, I think it was one of those things

1754
01:17:05,984 --> 01:17:10,484
where it's like a couple can get some time alone in the dark

1755
01:17:10,484 --> 01:17:14,744
to to make out and fool around a little.

1756
01:17:15,184 --> 01:17:17,084
And we can't do this at our home.

1757
01:17:17,204 --> 01:17:19,004
How long we can't do that ride.

1758
01:17:19,544 --> 01:17:22,584
Just a few minutes. People were desperate back then.

1759
01:17:22,644 --> 01:17:24,004
For any privacy.

1760
01:17:24,224 --> 01:17:25,704
Wait, what year? What year?

1761
01:17:27,164 --> 01:17:30,624
In a time before we had these great phrases like situationships

1762
01:17:30,624 --> 01:17:32,144
and ethical non monogamy.

1763
01:17:32,444 --> 01:17:34,864
And people were more clear. We had no terms to define anything.

1764
01:17:35,584 --> 01:17:36,764
We can't. It's a quick.

1765
01:17:37,384 --> 01:17:42,004
They needed three minutes in a boat ride to kiss.

1766
01:17:42,864 --> 01:17:43,764
Couldn't they go in the car?

1767
01:17:43,824 --> 01:17:45,284
That was what the car was for.

1768
01:17:45,424 --> 01:17:47,604
If they take my car to get there. Yeah.

1769
01:17:47,744 --> 01:17:50,904
Yeah. The car would go park on a on a hill and neck.

1770
01:17:51,044 --> 01:17:54,264
And one of the least convenient situations.

1771
01:17:54,964 --> 01:17:57,864
Those are in general, just like, you know, being like on a being on a bench,

1772
01:17:57,864 --> 01:18:01,064
something where you can't, you know, like face to face.

1773
01:18:01,464 --> 01:18:02,784
Maybe I'm alone in this.

1774
01:18:02,884 --> 01:18:04,804
I think face to face is the best way to kiss.

1775
01:18:04,964 --> 01:18:06,704
Oh, you think so? Yeah, I don't know.

1776
01:18:06,704 --> 01:18:11,184
The whole craning your head facing the same way never did it for me.

1777
01:18:11,184 --> 01:18:13,884
I don't know. I like being locked right in.

1778
01:18:13,944 --> 01:18:19,764
I like to be in a shallow pool in a boat made of plastic and to

1779
01:18:19,764 --> 01:18:23,724
really be going at it hot and heavy, as they say.

1780
01:18:23,884 --> 01:18:28,244
So horrible creaking for the worst gears and

1781
01:18:28,244 --> 01:18:31,964
early animatronics and people yelling like,

1782
01:18:31,964 --> 01:18:35,444
it's getting rusty. I told you we have it.

1783
01:18:35,444 --> 01:18:38,144
We got to replace them. This thing's going to fall.

1784
01:18:38,904 --> 01:18:43,504
The common knowledge urban legend always say whatever you want.

1785
01:18:43,864 --> 01:18:48,104
That is a piece, I think, of like haunted haunted houses.

1786
01:18:48,344 --> 01:18:50,784
You get scared and you grab the person next to you.

1787
01:18:50,784 --> 01:18:54,824
And if you're with someone you like, you know, that was the appeal.

1788
01:18:55,064 --> 01:18:58,684
I never occurred to me because I was usually at the haunted mansion with my

1789
01:18:58,684 --> 01:19:00,744
family. And I'm like, well, I got to see this.

1790
01:19:00,904 --> 01:19:03,324
I got to see all the characters. I see the storyline.

1791
01:19:05,024 --> 01:19:08,984
Yeah, Jason, I don't got no game bugging me. Try to get up on me.

1792
01:19:09,104 --> 01:19:12,744
I got no comfort to give. I got to look at this. These creaky coffins.

1793
01:19:13,064 --> 01:19:18,544
Sitcoms and movies really convinced me that I would make a lot of new

1794
01:19:18,544 --> 01:19:23,384
friends and love interests on vacations. And that's really didn't occur.

1795
01:19:23,724 --> 01:19:26,604
Yeah, absolutely. Well, and that's what I'm saying is this tunnel of love.

1796
01:19:26,724 --> 01:19:29,084
And Jason, I think still think you're describing one thing.

1797
01:19:29,084 --> 01:19:31,864
You're describing a dark room where you can get a little,

1798
01:19:32,064 --> 01:19:34,104
get a minute for some hanky panky.

1799
01:19:34,244 --> 01:19:39,304
But I'm describing a rides where the lights are on and it's very romantic

1800
01:19:39,304 --> 01:19:44,724
on a date because there's pink hearts and right. Why would it be romantic?

1801
01:19:44,724 --> 01:19:48,644
Yes. Is there actually this anywhere? Has this ever happened?

1802
01:19:48,844 --> 01:19:53,364
I bet to me it feels like something a hundred years ago was at like some kind

1803
01:19:53,364 --> 01:19:56,984
of carnival show. And maybe it's what you describe.

1804
01:19:57,044 --> 01:20:01,084
Maybe it's just what Jason described is in it's a tunnel and it's there's not

1805
01:20:01,084 --> 01:20:06,544
much in there. And it's literally, it's just for two minutes of, of pleasure.

1806
01:20:07,024 --> 01:20:10,564
The most uninterrupted passion at two minutes.

1807
01:20:11,464 --> 01:20:14,704
I don't know. Because also if it's a carnival, you're not, it's not,

1808
01:20:14,724 --> 01:20:18,184
it's not easy to set up a boat ride in a carnival.

1809
01:20:18,304 --> 01:20:20,084
So it would have to be something that would last for a while.

1810
01:20:20,084 --> 01:20:23,584
That thing's dinky. That's just, it would have to be so small.

1811
01:20:24,184 --> 01:20:27,924
They just made another like in the downtime,

1812
01:20:27,924 --> 01:20:31,424
that's where they like bathe the animals. Yeah. Some carny.

1813
01:20:31,564 --> 01:20:33,944
It's a hose that he fills it up with.

1814
01:20:33,984 --> 01:20:40,384
Yeah. The carny perfer when he clocks out of animal washing and into ton of love

1815
01:20:40,444 --> 01:20:43,584
leering. Yeah. And it's, and yeah, let's be honest.

1816
01:20:43,604 --> 01:20:46,184
There's a carny inside there watching everything.

1817
01:20:46,564 --> 01:20:50,044
That's probably why they do it. Yeah. Yeah. The like,

1818
01:20:50,304 --> 01:20:55,724
cause what need do they have to like, I just want to give the couples a romantic

1819
01:20:55,724 --> 01:20:59,204
moment. Young lovers. Yeah. No way. You wanted to watch.

1820
01:20:59,264 --> 01:21:03,924
That's why you built the tunnel. I'm an ethical peeping Tom. That's what I,

1821
01:21:03,924 --> 01:21:05,804
that's what I'm doing.

1822
01:21:07,624 --> 01:21:13,024
Practice ethical non-closing ethical peeping

1823
01:21:13,024 --> 01:21:19,324
and ethical paper. Well, we'll, we'll figure this out. I w I think that's it.

1824
01:21:19,324 --> 01:21:22,304
That's an episode for sure. We, I'm genuinely curious to know,

1825
01:21:22,924 --> 01:21:26,764
are there, there've been a hundred or zero. I have no idea. Um, let me,

1826
01:21:26,764 --> 01:21:31,004
let me shout out a couple other things. Oh, they've, there's, uh,

1827
01:21:31,024 --> 01:21:33,904
some area of the park, they have this marble dinosaur. Um,

1828
01:21:33,904 --> 01:21:35,924
it's just a nice little piece, uh,

1829
01:21:35,924 --> 01:21:39,184
but made a little more distinct by the fact that it, it,

1830
01:21:39,184 --> 01:21:40,884
this is from knots Berry farm.

1831
01:21:40,904 --> 01:21:45,084
I discovered it when we were going back into the knots rides with Rachel Bloom

1832
01:21:45,084 --> 01:21:48,584
that outside of kingdom of the dinosaurs, they had this cool marble dinosaur.

1833
01:21:48,944 --> 01:21:51,784
They took dinosaur right out of there, uh, sent it up to Gilroy gardens.

1834
01:21:51,844 --> 01:21:56,284
I love when charming theme park things and get another life like the California

1835
01:21:56,284 --> 01:22:00,664
letters from old California adventure that are outside of what, like the capital.

1836
01:22:00,664 --> 01:22:01,164
Yeah.

1837
01:22:01,304 --> 01:22:03,184
Billion second as new.

1838
01:22:03,184 --> 01:22:08,224
Someone was given a speech at it one time in a deep pandemic. Yeah. Yeah. Um,

1839
01:22:08,224 --> 01:22:11,544
so I like to see that. Um, there is also my favorite ride.

1840
01:22:11,544 --> 01:22:14,844
My favorite was the last one we did barely got it in before closing. Uh,

1841
01:22:14,844 --> 01:22:19,304
it is called South County back roads and this is,

1842
01:22:19,904 --> 01:22:24,084
um, it's a car ride and I'll just cut to the chase

1843
01:22:24,084 --> 01:22:28,004
better than Autopia. Wow. Easily, easily.

1844
01:22:30,244 --> 01:22:33,744
I mean, this is no room of Autopia fans,

1845
01:22:33,744 --> 01:22:38,644
but what I think I appreciate is like the way that they make it better.

1846
01:22:38,644 --> 01:22:42,784
And there's nothing stopping Disney from doing some of these things. I mean,

1847
01:22:42,784 --> 01:22:45,604
they can't do that like inherent thing of this ride,

1848
01:22:45,604 --> 01:22:50,044
which is that you load from one station, but there's one track goes one way,

1849
01:22:50,044 --> 01:22:53,984
another that goes the other way. Um, one way wasn't working, which sucked,

1850
01:22:54,204 --> 01:22:56,364
but if, if both were going, you know, this thing's cooking.

1851
01:22:57,044 --> 01:23:01,704
And one way is 1920s cars and one way is 1950s

1852
01:23:01,704 --> 01:23:06,324
cars. And this is great. This is a good idea. We of course wanted fifties,

1853
01:23:06,364 --> 01:23:09,764
fifties sounded good to me, but if you want to be an old weird jalopy,

1854
01:23:10,104 --> 01:23:13,584
you could do that. Um, at this point audience,

1855
01:23:13,584 --> 01:23:18,624
we have stopped so many times for a cricket that will not shut the fuck up.

1856
01:23:18,884 --> 01:23:21,464
So you're just going to have to deal with the cricket for the rest of the episode.

1857
01:23:21,704 --> 01:23:25,744
I'm very sorry. You have no idea how many times we've tried to stop for the

1858
01:23:25,744 --> 01:23:28,844
cricket. We were throwing in the towel. This is a perils of recording in a garage.

1859
01:23:28,844 --> 01:23:30,664
This is from all the, um,

1860
01:23:30,664 --> 01:23:34,464
trash talk you've thrown at the Jiminy cricket from the recent Pinocchio movie.

1861
01:23:34,464 --> 01:23:35,344
Oh, I guess so.

1862
01:23:35,404 --> 01:23:39,504
You are now getting sort of backlash from the cricket community who are big fans

1863
01:23:39,504 --> 01:23:44,484
of Joseph Gordon Levitt's Jiminy cricket. All right. Well, maybe if I say, all right,

1864
01:23:44,484 --> 01:23:47,404
you know what? I think Jiminy was very charming.

1865
01:23:47,644 --> 01:23:52,764
I think he's better than the original. I think he's very handsome.

1866
01:23:53,804 --> 01:23:54,924
Beautiful face.

1867
01:23:54,924 --> 01:23:55,884
He sends the sarcasm.

1868
01:23:55,884 --> 01:24:00,844
I'm trying to think of something I can see. He adds to the stories rendered in

1869
01:24:00,844 --> 01:24:04,484
perfect CGI. He doesn't scare me in the least.

1870
01:24:04,784 --> 01:24:05,724
Okay. Great face.

1871
01:24:06,264 --> 01:24:10,264
Awesome face makes me comfortable to look at.

1872
01:24:10,484 --> 01:24:13,964
I've watched it many times since, not just the once.

1873
01:24:14,064 --> 01:24:15,764
Okay. If you still going,

1874
01:24:15,824 --> 01:24:18,704
it's almost like you want to make him like kind of tear up or something.

1875
01:24:18,924 --> 01:24:20,864
He's so thinks your comments are so beautiful.

1876
01:24:21,104 --> 01:24:24,744
Fine. I'll just sing all of when you wish upon a star.

1877
01:24:24,744 --> 01:24:30,064
That almost got him. Yeah. All right.

1878
01:24:30,064 --> 01:24:32,424
And almost made him stop talking. Okay. Or chirping.

1879
01:24:32,724 --> 01:24:37,124
Let's just, we'll just end this sooner than later. Here's the deal with this ride.

1880
01:24:37,144 --> 01:24:39,804
Yeah, it is. Okay.

1881
01:24:40,124 --> 01:24:44,044
The they take away the gas ability on the car.

1882
01:24:44,264 --> 01:24:47,084
So the speed is not controlled by you,

1883
01:24:47,944 --> 01:24:54,424
but the steering still is who kids can't even do the gas themselves on the

1884
01:24:54,424 --> 01:24:58,344
utopia. They want to steer. No kid is excited about, but mom,

1885
01:24:58,344 --> 01:25:00,944
I want you to do the gas. Okay. Actually, you know what?

1886
01:25:00,964 --> 01:25:05,564
I take this back because I was obsessed with power wheels and hitting the gas on

1887
01:25:05,564 --> 01:25:09,344
a power wheels car. Okay. So I think I would be a little disappointed,

1888
01:25:09,344 --> 01:25:13,484
but if it gets rid of like an issue and it's easy, fine.

1889
01:25:13,704 --> 01:25:16,744
I steering is more than enough to have a lot of fun.

1890
01:25:16,744 --> 01:25:20,624
But you sort of can't, do you ever remember going on the utopia and like,

1891
01:25:20,804 --> 01:25:23,244
Oh boy, the gas. Well, no, I,

1892
01:25:23,264 --> 01:25:27,104
to me the power wheels almost always seemed 10 times more fun than the utopia.

1893
01:25:27,164 --> 01:25:31,044
And I liked fi like, I like going on utopia fine cause you,

1894
01:25:31,184 --> 01:25:33,304
it was fun to have some control, but never,

1895
01:25:33,524 --> 01:25:37,224
maybe I tried a power wheels once when I was a kid and that felt like free.

1896
01:25:37,384 --> 01:25:41,664
I felt free in a power wheels versus utopia, which you still knew as a kid,

1897
01:25:41,664 --> 01:25:45,804
you were on a little rail and it wasn't a responsive pedal. Obviously.

1898
01:25:46,164 --> 01:25:49,504
Yes. It was like, it felt unsatisfying in a way.

1899
01:25:50,344 --> 01:25:53,184
Like wiggle room there, right? You know, like it's either,

1900
01:25:53,384 --> 01:25:56,564
it's all the way on or it's all the way off. It's not like you get some,

1901
01:25:56,564 --> 01:26:00,804
like half speed that's cool. No. So just take it away. No need to do that.

1902
01:26:00,804 --> 01:26:02,964
I'm not upset by that. I'm just remembering that I,

1903
01:26:02,964 --> 01:26:05,704
the idea of hitting the pedal was cool to me. Okay.

1904
01:26:05,824 --> 01:26:08,444
I do remember putting the pedal to the, yeah, but I think,

1905
01:26:08,444 --> 01:26:09,944
but a fair concession, right?

1906
01:26:10,124 --> 01:26:15,444
What's this car ride gas powered or was it just electric power through the rail?

1907
01:26:15,484 --> 01:26:18,624
Okay. So it didn't stink in the middle of a garden.

1908
01:26:19,824 --> 01:26:23,044
Yeah. It doesn't smell. And then just,

1909
01:26:23,224 --> 01:26:26,844
and then you have like actual stuff to look at along the way.

1910
01:26:26,844 --> 01:26:31,204
There's like different gas stations depending on which area you're in there.

1911
01:26:31,204 --> 01:26:34,584
And then you see like a motorcycle cop who's mad.

1912
01:26:34,764 --> 01:26:40,004
Then you get into this tunnel, bang, siren guys coming after you.

1913
01:26:40,244 --> 01:26:43,724
Wow. The littlest thing. If that happened at the end of utopia,

1914
01:26:43,944 --> 01:26:48,744
you got, you have a third act. Now there's like something that occurs in it.

1915
01:26:48,784 --> 01:26:53,324
Right. Great. That would be fun. Yeah. And then you, do you pull over or?

1916
01:26:54,004 --> 01:26:55,104
You just evade the police?

1917
01:26:55,684 --> 01:27:00,364
I, huh? Well, the story of this ride seems to be that you just, you get away.

1918
01:27:00,644 --> 01:27:04,024
You've taught all the kids now. Yeah. Yeah. Disobey.

1919
01:27:04,584 --> 01:27:08,364
I guess maybe, maybe, you know, I don't know. Hey, you know, or Dave distrust authority.

1920
01:27:08,384 --> 01:27:10,284
Hey, you know, okay.

1921
01:27:10,284 --> 01:27:14,764
Worst thing. So, okay. Good message to teach. Um,

1922
01:27:14,764 --> 01:27:15,924
a cab daddy.

1923
01:27:15,924 --> 01:27:20,604
A cab. Oh, okay. Oh, okay.

1924
01:27:20,604 --> 01:27:23,984
Robert F Kennedy jr.

1925
01:27:23,984 --> 01:27:28,644
I thought you were saying like a 1920s phrase. Hey cab daddy.

1926
01:27:28,644 --> 01:27:32,844
Oh yeah. Oh yeah.

1927
01:27:32,844 --> 01:27:35,984
Jason's second album.

1928
01:27:40,424 --> 01:27:45,144
Sunglasses are down. The door is on. I'm cradling one of those microphones.

1929
01:27:45,524 --> 01:27:49,184
Songs about those new fangled inventions. Cars. Yeah.

1930
01:27:50,484 --> 01:27:56,224
I like a cab daddy. You're like calling to the cab driver and you call him cab

1931
01:27:56,224 --> 01:27:59,384
daddy. Yeah. Well, and employee, like, oh yeah.

1932
01:27:59,384 --> 01:28:01,964
Cause who doesn't have a crush on the cab driver?

1933
01:28:01,964 --> 01:28:02,604
That's right. Yeah.

1934
01:28:02,604 --> 01:28:05,824
You only get a brief little window with them and don't you want more?

1935
01:28:05,884 --> 01:28:09,744
Do you want it to at least turn it into a situation ship? That's right.

1936
01:28:10,424 --> 01:28:11,904
Scott, let me ask the issue.

1937
01:28:11,904 --> 01:28:16,404
Notice one of the things notable for this park, they have its own web page,

1938
01:28:16,484 --> 01:28:18,884
the circus trees. They call them.

1939
01:28:18,984 --> 01:28:22,224
Um, yes. Circus trees. You know what? I have to admit,

1940
01:28:22,224 --> 01:28:24,924
I didn't super clock them while I was there.

1941
01:28:24,924 --> 01:28:27,944
I know that they have these and this is a big part of it and we haven't talked

1942
01:28:27,944 --> 01:28:30,464
about that yet. Um, yeah.

1943
01:28:30,464 --> 01:28:35,964
So this was like this roadside attraction from that area from long ago.

1944
01:28:36,164 --> 01:28:37,664
Yeah. It's moved around a lot.

1945
01:28:37,664 --> 01:28:42,664
It's a guy who kind of figured out a way to grow trees in certain shapes or

1946
01:28:42,664 --> 01:28:44,304
bending in certain ways.

1947
01:28:44,304 --> 01:28:50,724
Yes. Where he would take five trees and like guide them along different paths.

1948
01:28:50,724 --> 01:28:55,844
So they would go into like a diamond shape and then refuse at the top and become

1949
01:28:55,844 --> 01:29:00,264
one tree again. Yeah. Very Dr. Susie. You know, very,

1950
01:29:00,364 --> 01:29:03,464
they, and they have some at Sus Island and islands of adventure,

1951
01:29:03,464 --> 01:29:05,744
not circus trees per se, but trees.

1952
01:29:05,824 --> 01:29:10,924
Yeah. Yeah. We're due to a hurricane or something like that. A hurricane.

1953
01:29:11,304 --> 01:29:15,004
I think when we're two of them, yeah, they got the, the still,

1954
01:29:15,124 --> 01:29:18,144
a still living tree that had been kind of bent from hurricane.

1955
01:29:18,564 --> 01:29:21,684
Playing God with trees. Yeah. You don't approve.

1956
01:29:21,904 --> 01:29:26,204
I mean they might look cool, but if you really, she's, she's just these trees.

1957
01:29:26,464 --> 01:29:29,004
How do we know they want to grow like this? That's true.

1958
01:29:29,164 --> 01:29:32,184
And we, the trees don't have a way to tell us that they're suffering. Yeah.

1959
01:29:32,184 --> 01:29:33,744
And they live forever.

1960
01:29:34,444 --> 01:29:37,364
So they got to be like that for, yeah. If, yeah,

1961
01:29:37,364 --> 01:29:41,864
if we were bred to have like a, you know, a, a, a weird,

1962
01:29:41,944 --> 01:29:46,884
like wicker basket middle, right. Uh, with only, with there are like,

1963
01:29:46,884 --> 01:29:50,404
uh, uh, GI, uh, it's just, you know,

1964
01:29:50,524 --> 01:29:54,224
we used through in this bizarre fashion that might be very uncomfortable.

1965
01:29:54,284 --> 01:29:56,064
That's right. So yeah, I'm just thinking about,

1966
01:29:56,224 --> 01:29:59,804
I wonder how they're feeling about it. I hope. Okay.

1967
01:29:59,804 --> 01:30:03,444
I remember that this Dr. Moreau of trees. Yeah.

1968
01:30:03,504 --> 01:30:07,504
He was brought to justice. He's twisted experiments.

1969
01:30:08,764 --> 01:30:12,704
The circus trees started the happening, you know? Yeah.

1970
01:30:14,804 --> 01:30:17,084
All right. You've met the trees for the park.

1971
01:30:17,204 --> 01:30:21,244
Now meet the ones that I do things with. Yeah.

1972
01:30:21,824 --> 01:30:23,624
Yeah. You know what he was doing.

1973
01:30:24,664 --> 01:30:28,564
Ethical non-monogamy. Ethical non-mahogany.

1974
01:30:33,964 --> 01:30:37,604
Wow. Wow. You nailed it. You nailed it.

1975
01:30:38,624 --> 01:30:42,524
Um, let me not try to do much beyond that because that's, uh,

1976
01:30:42,524 --> 01:30:46,924
we should just get out on that. But I, but really one more thing before I go, um,

1977
01:30:47,144 --> 01:30:48,304
you would think that a park,

1978
01:30:48,324 --> 01:30:51,824
a regional park of this nature with off the shelf kind of rides that are very

1979
01:30:51,824 --> 01:30:53,964
nice, they're all very well done. Um,

1980
01:30:53,964 --> 01:30:58,124
you would not expect a place like this to have an animatronic show. Would you?

1981
01:30:58,284 --> 01:31:00,864
And yet, and yet, um,

1982
01:31:00,864 --> 01:31:04,164
I'll just cut to the chase of how I learned about this, which was that I,

1983
01:31:04,164 --> 01:31:08,404
I went to do the garlic bulb ride because that seemed like the important thing

1984
01:31:08,404 --> 01:31:12,584
to do. Uh, but it seemed a little scary for the boy. Uh,

1985
01:31:12,584 --> 01:31:15,684
it was a more intense, like more intense than the med tea party would be.

1986
01:31:15,944 --> 01:31:19,904
So they went off to look at some waterfalls or something. And, uh,

1987
01:31:19,904 --> 01:31:23,484
when I caught up to them, um, Aaron was like, Oh no,

1988
01:31:23,484 --> 01:31:29,884
I think you missed the last show of the animatronic singing fruits that do a

1989
01:31:29,884 --> 01:31:33,564
beach boys song. Oh no, no,

1990
01:31:33,564 --> 01:31:35,924
it was the last one of the day.

1991
01:31:36,224 --> 01:31:40,624
What could I want to see more on this earth than that? Um,

1992
01:31:40,924 --> 01:31:45,524
what a bummer. Um, and so from that description,

1993
01:31:45,604 --> 01:31:49,164
this it's basically it's a food rocks. They have a food right.

1994
01:31:49,344 --> 01:31:51,184
It's so much like food rugs. Wow.

1995
01:31:51,184 --> 01:31:53,184
There's even like that some of the,

1996
01:31:53,184 --> 01:31:57,504
some of the characters are in a fridge that opens up and closes great,

1997
01:31:57,504 --> 01:32:02,504
like down to that detail. And I think there's onions and tomatoes. Um,

1998
01:32:02,504 --> 01:32:06,724
you'll be happy to hear all of the songs are from before 1965.

1999
01:32:07,904 --> 01:32:12,184
Thank goodness. You got, they're all about salads toss, toss it up, baby.

2000
01:32:12,244 --> 01:32:16,584
Uh, run around fruit and then, and, uh,

2001
01:32:16,584 --> 01:32:21,104
and most of it is dialogue. Most of the,

2002
01:32:21,184 --> 01:32:25,844
the 10 minute runtime of the Santa matrona show is quiet dialogue.

2003
01:32:25,904 --> 01:32:30,424
So there's only three songs in it, but then it culminates in salads,

2004
01:32:30,424 --> 01:32:32,744
USA. Wait, what?

2005
01:32:33,004 --> 01:32:38,164
Surfing USA. Uh, what's that? That's a parody of surfing USA. Yes. Yeah. Okay.

2006
01:32:38,164 --> 01:32:40,944
Um, so, you know, they didn't exactly nail it.

2007
01:32:41,524 --> 01:32:45,064
Did they name the salads like Caesar and I don't think so.

2008
01:32:45,064 --> 01:32:45,764
I think it was just like,

2009
01:32:45,864 --> 01:32:50,204
cause then you can be healthy and having a good diet.

2010
01:32:51,264 --> 01:32:53,604
I want to die early.

2011
01:32:55,004 --> 01:32:57,264
I don't have a heart attack. Okay.

2012
01:32:57,264 --> 01:33:01,844
I think it was more in that neck of the woods. I would say if everybody had a,

2013
01:33:02,204 --> 01:33:06,244
was it just, if everybody had a salad, I would look, it was not the best.

2014
01:33:07,184 --> 01:33:11,804
Maybe just salad was said in every line. Okay. Um, it's not the best written show.

2015
01:33:12,004 --> 01:33:15,304
It's not the best animatronics you've ever seen. Yeah. But God damn it.

2016
01:33:15,304 --> 01:33:17,684
I'm so happy it's there. Wonderful.

2017
01:33:17,684 --> 01:33:22,744
This might be one of the only animatronics shows in this country built post

2018
01:33:22,744 --> 01:33:27,004
2000, right? Yeah. I guess how many are new? Yeah. Yeah. Good point.

2019
01:33:27,004 --> 01:33:31,184
This doesn't happen. We threw this away. This isn't part of our culture anymore.

2020
01:33:31,224 --> 01:33:35,404
Right. It isn't Gilroy. Right. And it's 23 years old at the,

2021
01:33:35,504 --> 01:33:38,504
what year is it? 22 years old at this point. But like,

2022
01:33:38,844 --> 01:33:41,104
yeah, that's still like the youngest, one of the youngest shows,

2023
01:33:41,384 --> 01:33:43,304
probably non Disney or universal.

2024
01:33:43,604 --> 01:33:47,524
I like you put it in tree terms. Yeah. You're like youngest. Yeah.

2025
01:33:47,524 --> 01:33:50,524
It's a fairly young animatronic show, but it's thriving.

2026
01:33:50,764 --> 01:33:55,544
It's going to have a nice life and positive spin on it. Yeah. Yeah. Um,

2027
01:33:55,544 --> 01:33:58,084
it's so great. It's so great. The cricket returned.

2028
01:33:58,184 --> 01:34:02,564
It's so great that the cricket return, which means we should wind it down. Um,

2029
01:34:02,564 --> 01:34:06,564
the cricket might be a new recurring character on the show. Yeah.

2030
01:34:07,304 --> 01:34:12,044
As we head into some summer nights, we try to avoid the heat and where we have

2031
01:34:12,044 --> 01:34:14,704
to, uh, we'll try to not have it be.

2032
01:34:14,704 --> 01:34:17,324
The cricket or heat sickness, heat vomiting.

2033
01:34:17,804 --> 01:34:22,624
So this ride was a, what this opened in 81.

2034
01:34:25,284 --> 01:34:28,784
Oh, the host sir. Oh, we got to restart the recording.

2035
01:34:29,164 --> 01:34:32,244
Mike passed out on top of the recorder.

2036
01:34:33,804 --> 01:34:36,044
That's the way when you hear certain cuts in the episode,

2037
01:34:36,064 --> 01:34:39,484
you won't know that four days passed because we all went to the hospital.

2038
01:34:39,504 --> 01:34:42,384
We all got saline. Yeah, we all got saline.

2039
01:34:43,904 --> 01:34:47,224
Sorry. I was going to say we all, we all went to like the,

2040
01:34:47,224 --> 01:34:51,864
the storefront or I think I've seen them popping up in casinos,

2041
01:34:51,904 --> 01:34:57,924
like the vitamin bar, basically like an IV bar where you go when you get

2042
01:34:57,924 --> 01:35:01,164
rehydrated. Yeah. We got liquid IV. I took it out at the wedding.

2043
01:35:01,304 --> 01:35:04,724
I did some of that. The wedding I just recently went to.

2044
01:35:04,884 --> 01:35:07,844
I did the liquid IV to get all like the electrolytes back.

2045
01:35:08,184 --> 01:35:11,684
This is an IV injection. Yeah, this is, yeah.

2046
01:35:11,684 --> 01:35:14,484
You're saying in Vegas they'll go stab you full of vitamins.

2047
01:35:14,624 --> 01:35:18,524
I, they can't, some of them, I have to look them up. I got to find them. Yeah.

2048
01:35:18,704 --> 01:35:21,964
Are you sure it's not like it's like a sexy nurse that gives you like a shot?

2049
01:35:23,624 --> 01:35:28,704
I think it can get vitamin B shots too. I think it's, I believe so.

2050
01:35:28,704 --> 01:35:30,184
Something stuck in your veins?

2051
01:35:30,564 --> 01:35:33,124
To get rehydrated from partying to us.

2052
01:35:33,144 --> 01:35:34,024
Does this sound right?

2053
01:35:34,264 --> 01:35:37,504
Let me tell you, I want to dive in on this. I really do,

2054
01:35:37,544 --> 01:35:40,824
but I'm pondering something right now because we're,

2055
01:35:40,824 --> 01:35:42,104
we're talking about cricket. Yeah.

2056
01:35:42,384 --> 01:35:45,924
The garage door has been open and closed over and over and all of a sudden.

2057
01:35:46,244 --> 01:35:49,884
And now smell the air guys. It's a skunk. Yeah.

2058
01:35:49,924 --> 01:35:51,984
Well this is a podcast to write first. There's a skunk.

2059
01:35:51,984 --> 01:35:55,024
And it's not because Jason's lit up a big fat joint.

2060
01:35:55,024 --> 01:35:56,424
I know what you're thinking.

2061
01:35:56,464 --> 01:35:58,224
And I'm not tooting. Okay.

2062
01:35:59,944 --> 01:36:04,444
Yeah, right. I didn't toot the whole time either. I didn't toot.

2063
01:36:04,804 --> 01:36:07,924
Hey toot toot. I, okay.

2064
01:36:07,924 --> 01:36:09,904
If that is not the sign we need to end this.

2065
01:36:09,904 --> 01:36:10,944
We do need to end it. I agree.

2066
01:36:10,944 --> 01:36:14,704
I know what it is. A skunk. All right. Well, look,

2067
01:36:14,764 --> 01:36:18,664
the point is Gilroy Gardens is great. It gets you in touch with nature.

2068
01:36:18,984 --> 01:36:21,284
The good kind of nature, the pretty kind of nature,

2069
01:36:21,364 --> 01:36:26,224
not an annoying cricket and a skunk that might start spraying if we don't wrap

2070
01:36:26,224 --> 01:36:27,944
this up soon. So.

2071
01:36:28,024 --> 01:36:30,544
What if we get Michael Iser to be a guest on the show and he comes into the

2072
01:36:30,544 --> 01:36:33,804
garage and there's a cricket and a skunk?

2073
01:36:34,924 --> 01:36:36,264
Pepe, Jiminy.

2074
01:36:37,224 --> 01:36:41,064
Well, if the weirdos, a Chuck E.

2075
01:36:41,084 --> 01:36:43,224
Cheese dad, they're drug.

2076
01:36:43,344 --> 01:36:47,984
They might say that he might start necking with him.

2077
01:36:47,984 --> 01:36:53,284
I see Flora. I get to was attracted to Thumper, not Flora from when that's

2078
01:36:53,284 --> 01:36:57,124
actually, you know, yeah, that was an episode we haven't released.

2079
01:36:57,124 --> 01:37:01,404
Well, only in comparison to other characters. It seemed natural to me.

2080
01:37:01,864 --> 01:37:03,524
Okay, look, we'll get into that later.

2081
01:37:04,224 --> 01:37:08,884
I would love to not wrap it up super quick, but there's a thousand reasons to

2082
01:37:08,884 --> 01:37:12,504
go to the gardens. So great. So great. Check it out if you're in the area.

2083
01:37:12,784 --> 01:37:17,604
Super charm. Go give Gil the high five and

2084
01:37:17,604 --> 01:37:22,104
see if he gives you a toot back. You survived podcast, the ride.

And oh God, guys, it's in. Oh no.

2089
01:37:36,984 --> 01:37:38,644
Oh, throwing up.

2090
01:37:38,644 --> 01:37:39,364
Oh no.

2091
01:37:39,364 --> 01:37:42,184
It's a bucket of white paint fell on my backside.

2092
01:37:42,484 --> 01:37:45,324
Now it looks like I'm a beautiful skunk. Oh no.

2093
01:37:45,524 --> 01:37:49,344
Jason and the skunk are creating some sort of situation with each other.

2094
01:37:49,944 --> 01:37:53,464
Oh no. They're not committed. They're not in a committed relationship.

2095
01:37:53,584 --> 01:37:56,064
I gotta explain this one. Ooh, I like the look of this.

2096
01:37:56,144 --> 01:37:58,764
Can I get in on this situation? Oh no.

2097
01:37:59,784 --> 01:38:03,304
I think he likes that they're stinky. At least the skunk is.

2098
01:38:03,304 --> 01:38:07,504
Jason, I can't speak for, I don't want to include him in that, but oh no,

2099
01:38:07,904 --> 01:38:11,304
a weird throuples happening on the floor of my garage. Oh no,

2100
01:38:11,304 --> 01:38:14,604
but it's not a committed throuple. It's loose.

2101
01:38:14,604 --> 01:38:17,824
It's not ethical at all. Oh God, I don't want to see this.

2102
01:38:17,884 --> 01:38:21,364
It's ethical though, if they explain it to each other before. That's it.

2103
01:38:21,364 --> 01:38:24,564
I'm getting out of here. Oh no, I fell into the litter robot.

2104
01:38:25,004 --> 01:38:29,024
I have cat litter in my eyes now. Stop there.

2105
01:38:29,384 --> 01:38:32,504
I go through his episode. No.
