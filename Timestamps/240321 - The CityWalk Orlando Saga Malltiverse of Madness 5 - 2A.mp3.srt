1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:01,540
Forever.

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:03,540
Dog.

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:10,640
When your town has made you frown.

4
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:14,400
When your square has made you swear.

5
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,980
When life gives you one more punch.

6
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:24,060
You need a dough that's soaked in Captain Grunge.

7
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:27,720
You need a place, a place to stroll.

8
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,700
With alcohol.

9
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:33,700
A place that features part of the Berlin Wall.

10
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,680
Where seam-punged robots sell chocolate snacks.

11
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:41,680
A place where you can tattoo your lower back.

12
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,720
So let's go take a walk.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,820
Let's all go to City Walk Orlando.

14
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:50,360
Tonight.

15
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:51,740
Tonight.

16
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:59,460
A daily.

17
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,440
Extremely necessary series.

18
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:04,700
Exploring the shops, restaurants.

19
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,980
That make up Universal City Walk Orlando.

20
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,740
Welcome to Podcast the Ride.

21
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:13,760
The City Walk Orlando Saga.

22
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:15,620
Multiverse of madness.

23
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,200
If you're a second gate subscriber,

24
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,640
this is one of two episodes that has appeared in your feed today.

25
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,460
We don't want to suggest an order,

26
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,880
but this will probably be the first one that you'll listen to.

27
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:32,860
Or the only one if you're not on the second gate.

28
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,880
Let's get into it.

29
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:34,560
I'm Scott Gardner.

30
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,160
This is Mike Carlson.

31
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,080
I'm Mike Carlson.

32
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:39,700
Welcome to the Margaritaverse of madness as well.

33
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,660
As far as today is concerned.

34
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:42,920
I don't know.

35
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,240
Maybe we'll talk to one of the guys here

36
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,760
and see if he disagrees with what I just said.

37
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:49,360
Just prepare for that, I think.

38
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:49,780
Sure.

39
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:50,220
Absolutely.

40
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:50,860
Jason Sheridan.

41
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:54,460
Yeah, I mean, I think the madness is starting to creep in

42
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:56,480
both on the recording of these.

43
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:00,860
And also fittingly for today's excursion.

44
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:01,860
Yeah.

45
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,780
Madness hit pretty quickly.

46
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,700
An operative word, I would say.

47
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,660
A key word in all of this.

48
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:11,580
But before we fully explain what's happening here,

49
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,600
let's see if we can summon him.

50
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,920
Wait, is there a special margarita?

51
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,300
I don't know.

52
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:18,460
Air ride, everybody.

53
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:19,540
Fins up.

54
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,780
Let's see if we can get him.

55
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:21,600
Is he here?

56
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,600
Boys, boys, fins up.

57
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,360
All right.

58
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,540
Fins up, sector keeper.

59
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:27,240
Welcome back.

60
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,180
Fins up also looks like you're praying.

61
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,180
Like you're putting a little prayer on top of your head.

62
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,360
That's if you go to the youth ministry mass,

63
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,140
you do fins up, a little God is an awesome God.

64
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:39,160
Yeah, that's right.

65
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:39,980
Oh, wow.

66
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,980
That one always got to me, I have to say.

67
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,360
I didn't take everything away from my church going years,

68
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,400
but God is an awesome God had a real power to it.

69
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,700
And the choreography.

70
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:54,340
Indeed.

71
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:55,340
Yes.

72
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,940
Pep and everybody steps.

73
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:01,860
So we are here as you dictated yesterday, yesterday,

74
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,840
kind of yesterday, you know, began the Buffett discussion.

75
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:11,560
And but now today we focus on the heart of it.

76
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,160
The core part of the brand, Margaritaville,

77
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,540
although I should let you issue the assignment.

78
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:18,780
Yes, yes, of course.

79
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,260
which takes us to where exactly Margaritaville alpha,

80
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:36,140
which of course is in Orlando, Orlando, because it was opened first.

81
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:36,720
You got it.

82
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:37,000
Yeah.

83
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:37,480
OK, OK.

84
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,260
Yes, we're following.

85
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:41,920
OK, as opposed to being the Omega, Omega, which of course,

86
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,200
which is in Los Angeles and Omega is in.

87
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,100
I don't know my Greek letters or whatever, but Omega is mean second.

88
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:48,560
Right.

89
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:49,460
That's what it means.

90
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,100
It must.

91
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:55,980
No, no, I guess alpha is one and Omega is two.

92
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:56,800
That's not right.

93
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,580
But I don't know if this even makes sense.

94
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:01,280
Omega.

95
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,020
It's too late to change the rule.

96
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:03,920
Yeah, you're right.

97
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:04,260
You're right.

98
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:04,980
You're declared them.

99
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,220
It's what it's going to be.

100
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,540
It's what we got to stick to.

101
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:07,720
OK.

102
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:13,540
All I remember is there was an X-Men comic called Alpha and an X-Men comic called X-Men Omega.

103
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:15,920
Oh, and those were the start and the finish.

104
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,120
That's all I remember.

105
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:17,820
Yeah.

106
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:18,520
Jason, you know what I'm talking about?

107
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,660
I do know what you're talking.

108
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:24,660
That's how you would differentiate between the start of an event or the end of an event.

109
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,040
Oh, yeah.

110
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:26,920
So beginning and end.

111
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,620
That's what it is.

112
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:28,820
That's what Alpha and Omega is.

113
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:29,560
It's perfect.

114
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,760
It's very clean.

115
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:35,820
But today, Alpha, if you do subscribe to the second game,

116
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,500
and we encourage you to at patreon.

117
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,400
com slash podcast, The Ride,

118
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:45,360
at the exact same time, if it all worked out, then Omega should have dropped Omega,

119
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:49,020
which will take us to City Walk Hollywood.

120
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:56,540
And the idea here is we are having the exact same meal on two coasts,

121
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,000
per your request yesterday.

122
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:02,340
In other cases, we could kind of do different things in the Alpha and Omega,

123
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,640
but this one has to be exact to the T.

124
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,100
Yes, that's right.

125
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,480
OK, that's fine.

126
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,520
We're ready to do it.

127
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:13,400
So I'm just catching up on the rules and the formalities,

128
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:18,320
one of which being let me get I'm going to clear 20 comments out of our feed really quick

129
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,260
because we are covering Margaritaville.

130
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:28,140
We don't know Eddie Burback, the YouTuber who went to every Margaritaville in the country.

131
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:32,420
He also went to every Rainforest Cafe, which provoked a lot of comments asking,

132
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,920
why is it not this guy?

133
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,100
And the answer is we've never met this man.

134
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,700
We have no shared friends with this man.

135
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:43,120
I actually did a while back try to reach out to his agents who were specifically very unhelpful.

136
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:46,760
So that is the reason I'll save you all the commenting.

137
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,300
We would love to have him on the show.

138
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:49,420
I like those videos.

139
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,200
They're good.

140
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:54,600
This journey he's on, is he also trying to escape hell?

141
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:57,400
Or get to it.

142
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:59,180
Yeah, yeah.

143
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:04,420
No, it's a similar self-inflicted punishment to what we do.

144
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:06,880
So a kindred spirit for sure.

145
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:07,780
We'd love to have him on.

146
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,540
If any listeners have a way, a connection to this person,

147
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:13,380
or if somehow he's hearing it by now, Eddie, come on the show, please.

148
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:15,060
But he's not here now.

149
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:20,080
So you can save the comments for the next thing that makes you upset about this.

150
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:24,920
I want to thank the listeners for thinking that we are more powerful

151
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:29,920
and are more all-encompassing as far as people knowing about us.

152
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,640
I want to thank them for thinking that about us.

153
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,700
They know everyone.

154
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,760
That we could just snap up.

155
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,660
They're the talk of the town.

156
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,380
They're wheelers and dealers.

157
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:44,640
But anyway, now that that is out of the way, we are here to focus on Margaritaville.

158
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:46,960
So many phrases to keep straight.

159
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:51,140
Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville City Walk Orlando.

160
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,500
We went and had a meal there.

161
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,720
What's the Alvo?

162
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,560
Sorry, Alfie.

163
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,400
I keep missing him.

164
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:06,960
OK, so this has always been, I feel like, a cornerstone of City Walk Orlando.

165
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,020
There from the beginning.

166
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,740
And it's this location.

167
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:15,620
Obviously, we've talked much about Margaritaville over the years

168
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:17,440
and then various Buffett things.

169
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,060
Of course.

170
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,140
Yesterday included.

171
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:26,940
But this is all the Orlando one has always been kind of looming large in my head.

172
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:30,260
I think because some of the first that we ever talked about any of this stuff,

173
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:35,500
Mike, you've always said, well, that's kind of the you didn't say Alpha,

174
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:41,760
but kind of you implied it's like the Alpha location because it's on the water.

175
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:48,940
It's relaxing it like maybe summons those island vibes better than some of the other Margaritaville locations.

176
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:49,520
Oh, yeah.

177
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:50,060
Yeah.

178
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:51,000
Yeah.

179
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:51,620
There you go.

180
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:56,100
The Navy Pier location, the Margaritaville location, which is near the water,

181
00:07:56,100 --> 00:08:00,160
is one of the most unpleasant restaurants I've ever gone to.

182
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:00,840
That's Chicago.

183
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:01,360
Yes.

184
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:01,920
Sorry.

185
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:02,280
Yeah.

186
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:02,700
Chicago.

187
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:06,340
And it's obviously right by Lake Michigan, but it's cramped.

188
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:09,060
And you're sitting outside and you're not like right by the water.

189
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:14,180
There's like multiple like different streets and pavements and people on bikes.

190
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,400
But then it's just it's unpleasant and and it's terrible.

191
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:21,640
I would say the food there was maybe not the greatest.

192
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:22,700
Yeah.

193
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:27,780
So so a couple of the ones I've gone to, I've been a little disappointed in the ambiance.

194
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:31,920
And then, of course, you go back to Orlando and you go, well, this is how it should be.

195
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,000
This is where you're living the life here.

196
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:34,980
Yeah, absolutely.

197
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:38,320
Well, and I think there was maybe kind of a disappointment.

198
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:42,180
You know, we're not we're going to talk about Hollywood as its own thing right now.

199
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:43,960
We're talking about it right now.

200
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,100
Listen to both episodes at once.

201
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,600
Back and forth, ping pong back and forth as much as you want.

202
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,600
As we get into our meals, let's try to do it in the same order so that you could know.

203
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:51,900
Yeah.

204
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:52,400
All right.

205
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,440
Scott's meal, Alpha Scott's meal, Omega Mike's meal, Alpha, Mike's meal, Omega.

206
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:56,140
Yeah.

207
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,400
It's an interactive experience for you if you want it to be.

208
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:02,760
But Hollywood sync up to God is an awesome guy.

209
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:10,340
If you hit play at the very beginning of the episode, you get on a different computer or speaker system.

210
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,220
Sync it all up.

211
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:16,320
If you're a Club 3 member, you can get a free download of God is an awesome guy.

212
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:21,880
We made a deal with I want to say Michael Smith, who's the maker of that.

213
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:22,200
I guess.

214
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:22,980
Yeah, I did.

215
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:23,820
I did guess.

216
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,180
Wow.

217
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,160
I am going to heaven.

218
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,120
Michael Smith, maker of our God is an awesome God.

219
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:29,980
We don't know Michael Smith.

220
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,860
Stop asking to have him on the show.

221
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:32,340
Yeah, I know.

222
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,540
Look, we look we know a lot of funny people out there, a lot of good people out there.

223
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:38,500
We don't know religious singer Michael W.

224
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:38,880
Smith.

225
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,560
We don't know him.

226
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:41,920
We love the open invite Michael W.

227
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:42,060
Smith.

228
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:42,800
Anytime he wants.

229
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,180
Anyway, Hollywood opens.

230
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,740
Hollywood completely landlocked.

231
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,020
You know, you're not even close to any of those.

232
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:52,360
They wish they had the Navy pier situation.

233
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,220
Yes, for sure.

234
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,740
Barely close to a path.

235
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:56,320
Yeah, no, I know.

236
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:57,520
So back in the corner.

237
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,240
And it's yeah, it's it's really tucked away.

238
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,520
It's really tucked away there.

239
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:08,100
So yeah, this this one, this Margaritaville in Orlando is always been my favorite that I've gone to, at least.

240
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:12,780
And I assume there's other I'd have to check the Eddie Burback video where he went to all of them.

241
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:15,080
Yeah, but there are some that are along.

242
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:20,080
I mean, I feel like a lot are on the beach or on a pier or in locations like that.

243
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:30,140
But of the ones we've gone to, is anybody is anybody like been the one that I don't because my count is Orlando, Hollywood.

244
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:36,020
I just walked through Navy Pier Vegas, which Vegas started me off with this brand.

245
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:37,540
I didn't have Hollywood yet.

246
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:37,960
Right.

247
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:41,820
So Vegas set the bar for me and I loved it.

248
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:45,720
I like I was kind of in the throes of discovering the whole Buffett verse.

249
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,940
It was new to me.

250
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,920
We'd all just been to this concert together.

251
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,040
Sectorkeeper to fill you in.

252
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:54,420
We all went to see Jimmy Buffett with Nick Weiger and Anthony Geo.

253
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:55,440
Yeah, yeah.

254
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,080
So that's been there and still with us.

255
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,200
Yeah, I was I was floating above.

256
00:10:59,280 --> 00:10:59,760
Oh, jeez.

257
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,920
Before we even met you.

258
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:06,140
But you just like crazy to think that we maybe met at certain time.

259
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:07,840
It is.

260
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:08,520
Yeah, yeah.

261
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:09,940
Like maybe we were.

262
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,760
Yeah, Jimmy Buffett together.

263
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:12,640
Yeah.

264
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,940
Crossing over in ways we never even imagined.

265
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:19,740
We could have been seeing the same comedy death ray on a Tuesday night at UCB.

266
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,440
That's yeah, very possible.

267
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,200
Just in a tiny little club, like getting to see Louie.

268
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,460
Like there's not even that many people.

269
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:30,060
He goes on to do Madison Square Garden, but it's just us and Louie.

270
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,080
And then you and me.

271
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,960
I mean, it goes comedians, comedian.

272
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,360
Amen.

273
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:37,100
That's what he was.

274
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:38,260
That's what he is is.

275
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:44,880
But anyway, I love Vegas just like hit me.

276
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,160
Yeah.

277
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,240
So hard because they got the whole thing there.

278
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,520
They got the volcano.

279
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:52,060
They got the show that goes to the song volcano.

280
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:52,420
Right.

281
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:54,920
Despite not being on the water, it's on the strip.

282
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,980
And that's exciting.

283
00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:00,060
I genuinely liked the the dish.

284
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,100
I think you would.

285
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,760
Mike had just been on Doughboys and talked about it.

286
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,380
And I think you guys were all pretty buzzing about lava, lava shrimp, which I thought.

287
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:10,900
And it did not disappoint.

288
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,960
I was like, is wait a minute.

289
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,140
So Margarita Ville is a good restaurant.

290
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,360
That is a surprise to me because how often are chain restaurants not?

291
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,780
That's what I thought in 2016.

292
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:20,220
Yeah.

293
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:22,220
And I hear it's coming here to Hollywood.

294
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,340
We're going to have it.

295
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:25,040
I'm going to be up there every week.

296
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,800
I'm never going to stop being there.

297
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:28,920
Yes.

298
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:29,820
Very exciting.

299
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:31,700
I had been to the other Vegas one.

300
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,600
Do we go to that?

301
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,740
Maybe we went to the Vegas one.

302
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:39,020
When we went to a party, we got off the bus behind it.

303
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,300
Oh, we went there first.

304
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,640
We took a mega bus.

305
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:42,040
Right.

306
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:45,860
Which lets you off at the link, which is like an outdoor promenade.

307
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,620
And we went to Guy Fieri's at last.

308
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:49,360
That was the last thing.

309
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,080
Yeah, we went.

310
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:53,420
We had a very defeated meal at Guy Fieri's.

311
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:55,040
We ordered the wrong things.

312
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,140
Well, I mean, that's a fair opinion.

313
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:03,880
We did Guy's Cheesecake Challenge at the end, which was party.

314
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,080
No, three of us.

315
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:05,700
OK.

316
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,700
What is that?

317
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:07,920
It's a big piece of cheesecake.

318
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:10,260
Big piece of still frozen cheesecake.

319
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:10,780
Yeah.

320
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,700
With chips and pretzels crushed upon it.

321
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:19,180
That's a way to go to a bachelor party and get your stomach pumped, I guess.

322
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:25,940
Well, you know, you do the cheesecake challenge and you get back on the mega bus back to L.

323
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:26,300
A.

324
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,120
That's it there and back.

325
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,240
That's the best of the party.

326
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:29,840
Yeah.

327
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:32,420
So I do like Vegas a lot, too.

328
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:33,180
I will say that.

329
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,960
At least the time we had there, I don't know what it's been.

330
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,140
I haven't been to that place in a while.

331
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:45,820
But with how highly I was regarding the Vegas location, how my marketable journey started with, it's actually a good restaurant.

332
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:48,140
Yeah, that just always left me.

333
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:54,500
Then what is this Orlando that Mike has been talking like if, you know, listeners can't see that.

334
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:57,800
But as Vegas is here, then Orlando is here.

335
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,300
It's up above the roof.

336
00:13:59,300 --> 00:13:59,980
What is higher?

337
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:02,480
What kingdom is higher than heaven?

338
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,700
What kind of like how could it be better?

339
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,080
The only the sector keeper could answer that.

340
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,820
Is there a better heaven than heaven?

341
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,800
Yeah, there's like a heaven plus.

342
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:13,520
Oh, OK.

343
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:14,000
Cool.

344
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,980
They name it like thousands of years ago.

345
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,980
They named it the way they named streaming services.

346
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,000
Now, that's right.

347
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,760
Yeah, there's ad free heaven.

348
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,040
Oh, just like no billboards.

349
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,000
Yeah, no billboards.

350
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:27,900
There are so in heaven you do have to see ads all the time.

351
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,680
You have to see ads still, you know, for communion, blood of Christ.

352
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:32,300
All right.

353
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:32,500
Right.

354
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,340
There's got to do there.

355
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:38,760
There is a commercial over the body of Christ right now.

356
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,320
That's very good.

357
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,860
Is it like sexy or something like a reverent?

358
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:46,940
Yeah, it's funny.

359
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,420
It's all I bet it's random.

360
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,140
It's random, man.

361
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,940
The people that are in.

362
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:53,520
Oh, man.

363
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,660
You get dead comedian.

364
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:56,880
Well, like Rodney Dangerfield up there with you.

365
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:00,680
And then you're looking around and he's Lincoln.

366
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:06,280
Rodney and Lincoln are in a commercial together and have been for body of Christ.

367
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,080
Oh, wow.

368
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:07,580
OK.

369
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,040
You can't get any respect.

370
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,560
This is for going to get the little pieces of bread.

371
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:12,840
They did an ad for that.

372
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,220
The one that's messed up right now is that I'm in.

373
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:21,580
I'm technically subscribed to heaven plus they had a Black Friday deal.

374
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:22,900
Oh, yeah.

375
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,220
Black Friday deal.

376
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,240
And was it Black Friday or Good Friday?

377
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,500
You're right.

378
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:29,860
It was a good Friday.

379
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:30,760
They call it there.

380
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:34,140
We should time portal to change that.

381
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:34,840
Oh, it's OK.

382
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:36,640
I think we can leave it.

383
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,280
Yes, there is a question.

384
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,000
There was a Good Friday deal.

385
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,580
And but, you know, it's weird.

386
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:47,920
You still wait when you wake up in the morning, you still have to watch 30 seconds of a commercial.

387
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:51,760
And when you go to bed at night, you still have to watch 30 segments of commercials.

388
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:55,040
You're paying premium, but you're still sneaking ads in.

389
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:55,300
Right.

390
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:55,640
Right.

391
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:56,140
Wow.

392
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:57,800
Well, heaven's got to make money somehow.

393
00:15:58,580 --> 00:15:59,240
That's true.

394
00:15:59,440 --> 00:15:59,960
That's true.

395
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:00,240
Yeah.

396
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:04,160
It's a lot to keep up an entire like supporting old cloud world.

397
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,300
I'm going off like the regular, you know, the question idea.

398
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:07,920
Right.

399
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:08,120
Right.

400
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,040
So it is gates.

401
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:10,640
Those cost a lot of money upkeep.

402
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,980
You got to put you know, you don't just build them.

403
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:12,860
You polish them.

404
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:13,380
Yeah.

405
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:16,120
It's Golden Gates and clouds, right?

406
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:16,960
Yeah.

407
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:17,880
More or less.

408
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:18,520
Golden Gates.

409
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,120
There's a Margaritaville.

410
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,340
Oh, no way.

411
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:21,740
Yeah.

412
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:25,060
Oh, let me edit my notes because I said 23 locations.

413
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:25,460
Sorry.

414
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,140
24 if we count.

415
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:29,100
But you got to be dead to know about that.

416
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:29,460
Epsilon.

417
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,500
That's Epsilon.

418
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:30,940
Epsilon.

419
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:31,920
Epsilon is heaven.

420
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:32,240
OK.

421
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:33,420
OK.

422
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:34,620
Is that a good one?

423
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,120
Is that of the that must have the volcano.

424
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,320
Oh, it's got it all.

425
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,520
And it's got it all.

426
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:40,200
It's good.

427
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:41,600
I bet that heaven one.

428
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:46,920
I think the big one of the big things that notches a Margaritaville up high ceilings,

429
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:52,940
high ceilings in Vegas and in heaven is no ceiling and no ceilings.

430
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:53,340
Yeah.

431
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:53,660
Yeah.

432
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:53,920
Yeah.

433
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:58,020
Even when I've been to I'm sure no one else has Atlantic City.

434
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:58,880
Oh, right.

435
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,140
I was asking who's OK.

436
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:00,720
I've never been.

437
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:01,140
No, no, no.

438
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:01,460
I don't know.

439
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:05,040
It's part of the resorts casino.

440
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:10,600
When it opened, they were like, check out the Margaritaville casino attached.

441
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:17,080
And I was like, oh, and I went and it's like two rows of tropical slot machines.

442
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,360
Like it's not quite a full casino.

443
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,640
That's Vegas, too.

444
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:24,740
You just like get their carpet pattern next to some slot machines.

445
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:25,100
Right.

446
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:25,560
Yeah.

447
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:29,600
So Atlantic City, it's you can enter from the casino

448
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,420
hotel or you can enter from the boardwalk.

449
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:37,020
And then on the other side of the boardwalk and like the beach dunes,

450
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:42,200
there is a pier, a little bit of a pier with a land shark barn grill.

451
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:44,960
So they have a separate like the loan home.

452
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:45,400
OK.

453
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:46,820
Have you eaten there?

454
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,040
I have not eaten there at that location.

455
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,240
I believe it's just open in the summers.

456
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,560
Oh, really?

457
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,680
Oh, you mean the land shark, the land shark.

458
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,360
Specifically, you have eaten at the Margaritaville.

459
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:57,500
I've eaten at the Margaritaville.

460
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:57,960
OK.

461
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:01,040
Is Landshark Margaritaville owned?

462
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:04,800
Yes, it's the land shark logger is yes.

463
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,780
It's a beer brand.

464
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:07,380
And I guess I guess bars.

465
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,020
Yeah, they start a separate land shark bars sometime.

466
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:12,620
And the land shark beer factors into some of the food.

467
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:16,140
And yeah, and there's there are also still, I think, but maybe certainly

468
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,720
at some point about a cheeseburger in paradise locations also that are not

469
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,880
branded Margaritaville, but they're owned by but are owned by.

470
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:25,560
Yeah.

471
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:25,960
Yeah.

472
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:29,280
Then there's like resorts that have been abandoned by the company.

473
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,400
Talked a little bit about that.

474
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:36,740
Yeah, there's iconography.

475
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,180
It's a little unclear.

476
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:43,700
I mean, the Orlando Margaritaville where we named a street is still there.

477
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,500
I think it's maybe seen better.

478
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,900
Has it seen better days?

479
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:48,440
Maybe it never saw good days.

480
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,800
It's possible to never seen good day.

481
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,680
Probably would have been a good place to hide out during covid

482
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:55,520
because there was no one around.

483
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:56,720
There was no one.

484
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,320
You want a whole resort to yourself.

485
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:02,020
But there was also a fair amount of loose electrical wiring.

486
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:04,720
So they were still building it.

487
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,480
They were still building.

488
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:10,460
Although also, can you imagine that you go to that to like the cigar bar

489
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:14,560
in May 2020 and it is just packed to the gills?

490
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:17,020
Yeah, don't go to the resort.

491
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,340
Go to the empty housing.

492
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:22,440
Go to like the big short empty housing neighborhood.

493
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:26,700
The weird narrow houses that look like the cat in the hat movie that aren't selling.

494
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:27,260
Yeah.

495
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:31,180
So Navy Pier, Atlantic City, what other?

496
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,700
So Tau Rho.

497
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:35,780
Whoa, they all got names.

498
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,780
Those are all the ones I've been to.

499
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:42,640
I think I've only seen Niagara Falls from a distance.

500
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,300
I wasn't into the brand yet.

501
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:46,360
I'm glad I am now.

502
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,100
Much fun has come from it.

503
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,520
I went to one in the Detroit airport once.

504
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:52,360
Oh, wow.

505
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,140
Yeah.

506
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,540
Our flight was going to New Jersey.

507
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,320
I should just say I was flying to New Jersey.

508
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:03,100
I don't need a stinkin plane.

509
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:11,960
And yeah, got delayed in the Wayne County Airport in Detroit.

510
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,960
Completely empty terminal.

511
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,520
The only thing open was the Margaritaville.

512
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,480
Oh, wow.

513
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:21,540
Emptiness, barrenness is associated with this brand.

514
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,900
Did you have a meal?

515
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,660
Well, I did not.

516
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:34,140
And it didn't seem like many people that the plane, even though there were literally no options, people walked the entire terminal and just walked right past.

517
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:34,840
Oh, no.

518
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:36,660
So it didn't peak.

519
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:38,040
Maybe it wasn't lunch or dinner.

520
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:40,240
Maybe it was in between time when you don't need to eat.

521
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,460
Yeah, yeah, maybe.

522
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:43,040
Maybe three, four.

523
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,840
But it was vibrant.

524
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:46,140
OK.

525
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:46,940
Yeah, yeah.

526
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:47,780
And ambiance must be.

527
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,140
Maybe that's the top ambiance.

528
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:49,740
I don't know.

529
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,680
I'd have to look it up.

530
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:53,820
But yeah, I set the bar for Detroit Airport.

531
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,380
Oh, another one.

532
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,940
Put an asterisk next to this one.

533
00:20:58,980 --> 00:20:59,820
Times Square.

534
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:01,300
Oh, wait, we've been forget.

535
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,680
Yes, we did an entire episode.

536
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:04,440
Yeah, I stayed there for days.

537
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:05,120
Yeah, that's right.

538
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,840
I think of that as its own thing, though.

539
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,460
It is.

540
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:13,140
But there is a Margaritaville restaurant, technically, that is.

541
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,540
Is that technically Margaritaville?

542
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,600
That is technically a Margaritaville.

543
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,580
And it's technically Times Square, I guess.

544
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,140
It's a number blocks away.

545
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:22,840
It's in Times Square?

546
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:28,100
Well, it's technically approaching the fashion district at that point, I think.

547
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,980
But yeah, it's near the…

548
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:35,880
You pass the Hard Rock that used to be the WWE restaurant.

549
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,220
That's right, yeah.

550
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:37,840
Wow.

551
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:43,700
And Jason and Jane stayed there, and every hour they would call and ask for new towels.

552
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:47,260
I remember that's part of the story.

553
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:49,140
Like, exaggerating as usual.

554
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:53,520
They were also calling down for the complimentary island water bottles.

555
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,040
Yes, the big thing was that the water…

556
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,840
I don't remember the name, but let's say Sally is who you're going by.

557
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,440
You knew the name of the desk person.

558
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:01,320
Sally, we need towels, Sally.

559
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,560
That was what you were saying.

560
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:02,900
We need more island water.

561
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:06,500
They had been chummy with the desk person because they were calling down so often.

562
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,940
Here's the thing.

563
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:13,300
New York hotels, when they only have two elevators, you're waiting those elevators for a while.

564
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:13,840
Oh, I know.

565
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:14,340
It was awful.

566
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:19,420
So we weren't going down for it sometimes when we could get an elevator.

567
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:24,200
Or you just go to the gym where they have a whole fridge of waters and towels.

568
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:28,420
Margaritaville Times Square Resort Hack.

569
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,000
Go to the gym.

570
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:30,620
Go to the gym.

571
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:39,060
And if you visit every location, you can turn in your stamp card for a little shot glass.

572
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,280
Yes, right.

573
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,160
I remember this.

574
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,660
And then hack number three, if none of that works.

575
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,680
Sally, Sally, Sally.

576
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:51,140
And you're not going to get this from Benny Burnsack.

577
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:52,020
What was his name?

578
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:52,960
Eddie Burback.

579
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,560
That's right.

580
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,660
He didn't go into the gym.

581
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:59,300
You can teach him about that if he was here.

582
00:22:59,300 --> 00:22:59,900
We're talking about water.

583
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,320
We're talking alpha, boys.

584
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,400
Yes, you're right.

585
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,260
Let's talk alpha.

586
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:05,840
So it's been built up in my head a lot.

587
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:08,700
And it's something I was really looking forward to, I would say, during this.

588
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:19,600
Like, OK, if we're just the point of this trip is to just plant roots at City Walk, then we can have a nice leisurely meal there.

589
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:24,400
And so when it came to passPeter, I was happy.

590
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:30,020
And going into it, and this is kind of like the full group.

591
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:37,760
This was the three of us and Jane as well and the level keeper, in fact.

592
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,220
Yes, he was there as well.

593
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:43,280
Yes, so we got to spend a little more time with him.

594
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,400
Wait, and Universal employee Adam.

595
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:47,620
Adam.

596
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:47,980
Yes.

597
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:49,400
Adam, yeah, Adam, correct?

598
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:50,040
Yes.

599
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,820
Yes, so Adam, Adam there as well.

600
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:58,080
And this was also Adam had like helped us out and let it take us to see some like exclusive behind the scenes stuff.

601
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,880
Yes, as he did the last time we were there.

602
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,760
So it was like, let us repay you.

603
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,020
Thank you.

604
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:06,860
With a meal and one of the finest establishments that there is.

605
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:09,540
So so so we got a group going.

606
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:15,980
We get in there and the OK.

607
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:20,080
Things about it about this specific location just before we go further.

608
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:22,700
You got you got the volcano thing.

609
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:23,700
You got the blender thing.

610
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:24,980
There's a video.

611
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,880
I forgot there's a burp that happened.

612
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:28,680
Yes, the burp.

613
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:30,240
Yes, that's part of the sequence.

614
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:30,600
Right.

615
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:34,700
The volcano burps and then a big big blender is filled up.

616
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:41,200
But I do you know, the volcano sequence is one of the dumbest, coolest things in any giant chain restaurant.

617
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,040
Yeah, I think I think it's a triumph.

618
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,260
And you got to give this one.

619
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,240
I don't know if we're competing the two against each other, but maybe vaguely.

620
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:52,620
Certainly got a notch this above Omega because they have the volcano.

621
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:53,440
Yeah, of course.

622
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:58,140
I mean, this thing, this should be the I mean, you know, we've recently talked Rainforest Cafe.

623
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:05,320
This is kind of the draw as far as like next level seeming like as far as the Rainforest Cafe is like a little thunderstorm or something.

624
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,540
But this is the big thing.

625
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:07,700
It's a real volcano.

626
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:08,480
It's not a real volcano.

627
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,800
It's a real working facsimile of a volcano.

628
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:13,960
Fiberglass volcano.

629
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:14,360
Yeah.

630
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:17,900
Is it better than I don't know if it's better than Rainforest Cafe.

631
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:18,940
I don't know if it's better.

632
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,780
I'm just saying that's like their trademark.

633
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:24,440
And this is this should be Margaritaville's trademark.

634
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,540
And this should be in all of the restaurants.

635
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:29,760
I'm saying it shouldn't allow them to be built without it.

636
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:30,020
Yes.

637
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:34,120
And it's this song volcano, one of his ten songs that people know.

638
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:35,720
That number keeps climbing.

639
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:38,480
People do not know ten of these songs.

640
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,900
There are like four songs.

641
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:40,860
Well, let's show.

642
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,440
OK, Sector Keeper.

643
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:43,880
Sector Keeper was at the concert.

644
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:46,120
Do people say the Big Six or something?

645
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,300
That's for Disney.

646
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,060
That's a Disney character.

647
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:48,540
No, no, no.

648
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:54,340
But there's a set of Jimmy's songs and sometimes the last one or two is the Big E.

649
00:25:55,120 --> 00:26:00,420
The Sector Keeper is more aware of Buffett than the common person, I would say.

650
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:05,120
How many of the Big Ten, ten songs people know?

651
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,360
Can you name?

652
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:07,140
Right.

653
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:12,100
And like Disney, they do locks him in the vault every once in a while.

654
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,800
Yeah, do vaulted ones count?

655
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,620
Some come in and out.

656
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:21,180
OK, so Margaritaville.

657
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,000
We got one.

658
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,080
Cheeseburger in Paradise.

659
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:24,960
Yeah, that's two.

660
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,180
Volcano.

661
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:29,780
Four.

662
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,000
That's one of the sad ones.

663
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:31,840
Volcano.

664
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,560
Did you already say Volcano?

665
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:34,420
I already said it.

666
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:35,340
That was third.

667
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,240
You just literally just said it.

668
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:38,680
I meant Volcano Omega.

669
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,060
You mean the live version.

670
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:43,260
Live version.

671
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:45,400
You have to though.

672
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:46,600
Which date though?

673
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,000
Now wait a minute.

674
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:51,120
It's like the Grateful Dead.

675
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,360
You got to have the dates.

676
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,840
You know, from the live tracks.

677
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:55,020
There's bootlegs.

678
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:55,780
Bootlegs.

679
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,960
So far, we're at four.

680
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,720
The number I said.

681
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,980
Math sucks.

682
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:01,940
OK.

683
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:02,460
Of course.

684
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:05,800
But math sucks is not one people know about.

685
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:07,220
That's one that Mike talks about.

686
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:08,980
How would he know about it then?

687
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:09,940
He's a ghost.

688
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:11,420
I don't really hang out with him that much.

689
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,920
Yeah, I've been staying with Jason mostly.

690
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,280
Yeah, he's still with Jason.

691
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:17,140
Five.

692
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:20,580
I think one of those is a bit of a cheat, but generously five.

693
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,660
We talked about one earlier.

694
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:26,260
We did the E.

695
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:26,980
Oh, that's going to help.

696
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:28,980
Oh, Finn's Up.

697
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:29,940
Yeah, Finn's.

698
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:30,580
Not the name.

699
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:31,160
Oh, OK.

700
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,160
Yeah, he got close.

701
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:33,420
Give it to him.

702
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,180
Yeah, all right, fine.

703
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:36,160
With hints, we're getting.

704
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:38,500
So with a lot of help, we have round two.

705
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,460
We've crested the way.

706
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:42,040
We're heading to the almighty easy to get 10.

707
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,740
There's a big sad one.

708
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:46,280
Sad one that involves us in travel.

709
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:47,420
This is too many hints.

710
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,680
I'm cutting off hints.

711
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,460
The more we hint.

712
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:52,220
Oh, goodness.

713
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,520
Oh, shoot.

714
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,260
Just start making them up if you can go hit it.

715
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:58,920
OK.

716
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,080
There's.

717
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,600
But you'll get pretty close.

718
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:03,660
There's.

719
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:05,920
Don't you dare whisper any to him.

720
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:06,320
Sorry, sorry.

721
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:08,260
I know I just I'm just helping with her.

722
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,380
His son tan slips.

723
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,000
Shit.

724
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:11,900
Yeah, there you go.

725
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:12,560
Yeah.

726
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:15,020
As far as I know, it's an slips.

727
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,420
So on the tennis slips, the blunt blunt.

728
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:18,220
Of course, I've heard.

729
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:19,420
Yeah, you're the show.

730
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:20,480
Yeah.

731
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,460
Oh, goodness.

732
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,720
Well, you can take your time.

733
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:23,980
You could.

734
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:24,900
He doesn't have to do it.

735
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:25,760
It might come.

736
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:26,280
It might come.

737
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:27,800
We'll call him out as we go.

738
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,500
We will prove the 10 commonly.

739
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:33,620
And then, of course, something that Mike has asserted that not only to common people know,

740
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,240
but it's of course, listeners to our show know.

741
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:39,120
Please now name Jimmy Buffett's guitarist.

742
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:40,160
Oh, yeah.

743
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,020
You know this.

744
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:42,860
Yeah, he knows this.

745
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,580
Of course, because he's a person in America.

746
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:45,480
He knows it.

747
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,280
And a supporter of podcast the ride.

748
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,400
We're not a one person subscribing.

749
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:50,620
Doesn't know the name.

750
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:52,260
People know Jimmy Buffett's guitarist.

751
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:57,560
Because when Jimmy played the bull, Jimmy left stage for a while to have wine.

752
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:58,240
That's right.

753
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:00,640
And I might have been fake wine, though.

754
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,800
Yeah, it might have been.

755
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:04,120
And this guy did a mini set.

756
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:04,600
Yeah.

757
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:04,720
Yeah.

758
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,860
And his name is?

759
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:06,960
It'll come to me.

760
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:07,340
It'll come.

761
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:07,820
Yeah.

762
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:08,100
Yeah.

763
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:08,960
OK.

764
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,680
He's under pressure here.

765
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,980
I don't want to put him under that kind of stress.

766
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:13,300
All right.

767
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:15,600
So we'll let you do a take home test.

768
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,000
OK.

769
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:19,180
All right.

770
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,960
I am impressed with it.

771
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:21,420
OK.

772
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,480
We got to Mac.

773
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:23,640
He knows.

774
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:24,640
Everybody knows.

775
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,080
They all obviously know.

776
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,320
Mac McAnally.

777
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:32,460
Are we allowed to say that you wanted to put Mac's name in the theme song?

778
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:32,960
I did, yeah.

779
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:33,560
I tried.

780
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:34,420
And I vetoed it.

781
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,220
Scott vetoed it.

782
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:42,040
I don't think one of the primary facets of these Orlando City Walk is Mac the guitar player.

783
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:46,640
Here are the songs known as the Big Eight.

784
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,100
Just to confirm.

785
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:48,640
The Big Eight?

786
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,340
The one with Alan Jackson, right?

787
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:51,660
Well, Alan Jackson wrote it.

788
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:51,860
That actually…

789
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:53,240
But it's a well known…

790
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,960
It was the only hit, maybe, of all this stuff.

791
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,520
It was the only number one hit, I think.

792
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:58,680
He's on it.

793
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,820
He appears on it, of course.

794
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:00,460
OK.

795
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:02,760
Margaritaville.

796
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,200
Let's go faster.

797
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:04,680
Faster.

798
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:05,780
We heard these.

799
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:06,640
Hold on.

800
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:11,200
Like this Yahoo article says, these will make you feel like you're on island time.

801
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:13,660
Remember, this can be a quick one.

802
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,680
Remember, this can be a quick one.

803
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,140
This can be a quick one.

804
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:15,740
That's adjacent.

805
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:17,620
Margaritaville.

806
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:18,840
Number three.

807
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:19,540
Come Monday.

808
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:20,140
Come Monday.

809
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:20,960
Finns.

810
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:21,800
Volcano.

811
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,720
A Pirate Looks at Forty.

812
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,560
Cheeseburger in Paradise.

813
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,400
Why Don't We Get Drunk?

814
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,180
I've never heard of that in my life.

815
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:31,660
I've been with you motherfuckers for seven years.

816
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:32,100
Why don't we get drunk?

817
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:34,120
I've never heard of Why Don't We Get Drunk?

818
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:35,440
That is not a Big Eight.

819
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,320
The lyric in that shit.

820
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:37,160
The last one.

821
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,140
The lyric in that.

822
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:39,280
Not in the eight.

823
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:40,460
I didn't say it was in the eight.

824
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:40,700
Wait, wait.

825
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
This is John who was in the eight?

826
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,120
Changes in latitude, changes in attitude.

827
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:43,420
That's fine.

828
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,100
That one's in.

829
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:44,340
Sure.

830
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:44,860
Great.

831
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:47,800
The lyric in that song is Why Don't We Get Drunk and Screw.

832
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:48,660
And screw.

833
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:49,040
Yeah.

834
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,060
Thank God they left it out.

835
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:50,440
Oh, Zegger Keeper knows.

836
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,000
I knew.

837
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,120
I did know that one.

838
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:56,640
I don't know it after hours and hours of Buffett content.

839
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,420
I didn't say it was a Big Eight.

840
00:30:57,540 --> 00:31:00,140
That's whatever article Jason's reading about the Big Eight.

841
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:05,420
Well, I'm reading Wikipedia and there's a Yahoo article that also lists the same song.

842
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,900
That article seems like it has a lot of ads because you're really scrolling through.

843
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:10,760
That is how it goes.

844
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:13,720
The older a website is, the longer the ads go through.

845
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,380
It's a 19 minute read.

846
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:19,560
There's a lot of ads and there's embedded videos for each song.

847
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,700
Why Don't We Get Drunk?

848
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:23,760
The chances of Jason getting distracted and clicking on the ads as well.

849
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,000
Like, oh, the Sears.

850
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:27,820
I got to help out, Yahoo.

851
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:30,200
$3 off at Rubio's.

852
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:33,080
Jason just downloaded and is playing Royal Match.

853
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:36,380
I've got to save the king.

854
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,500
Please help me.

855
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,420
Save the king.

856
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,300
Save the king.

857
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,700
Speaking of songs I've also never heard of, here's something that even though I was in

858
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:45,400
the restaurant, maybe this isn't something they do anymore.

859
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:46,900
Inside.

860
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:48,160
OK.

861
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,000
Intribute to the song 12 Volt Man.

862
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:57,080
The back of the bar was covered in car batteries hooked up to blenders that served boat drinks.

863
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,180
And then something about the volcano that we know.

864
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,340
12 Volt.

865
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,460
Does that do they do that?

866
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:04,880
And what's 12 Volt Man?

867
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:08,260
You get like boat drinks, the more iconic song.

868
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:11,860
It's a song.

869
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:13,880
I don't know that one by heart.

870
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,300
I've heard of it, though.

871
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:17,060
I can't remember how it goes.

872
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:21,680
I did not see if they did something special for the 12 Volt batteries, though.

873
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,420
I don't know if that's something that.

874
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,000
There's a lyric to this one.

875
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:27,520
Seldom found the trick to arithmetic.

876
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:29,920
So it's kind of a cousin of math sucks.

877
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:31,780
That's another.

878
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:35,640
That's like the third thing that he writes about is math being bad.

879
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,420
Don't forget there is a third thing.

880
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,260
The big three.

881
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:39,720
Boats.

882
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:40,440
Topics.

883
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:42,620
Boats, alcohol and math being bad.

884
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:44,460
Math is sucks.

885
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:48,500
So anyway, I'm getting excited because like, OK, we're going to have this ocean view.

886
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:49,800
We're going to see the volcano.

887
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:53,220
We're going to see the 12 volts, the batteries, all of this.

888
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:57,000
And then we get seated in kind of a perfunctory lobby.

889
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,580
We're like right at the front.

890
00:32:58,580 --> 00:32:59,640
First of all, yes.

891
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,400
Like it's a room.

892
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:02,560
We got seated in the worst spot.

893
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:04,760
I think you could possibly sit in this place.

894
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,420
It's pretty bad.

895
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:06,540
It was pretty bad.

896
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:06,900
It's right.

897
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:07,800
No, no ambiance.

898
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,000
It was like being in a waiting room.

899
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,140
Close to the bathrooms, which would prove valuable.

900
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:19,420
So there's there's almost like three sections to this place, I would say.

901
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,860
This kind of lobby area that is.

902
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:25,620
And then there's more tables as you go on the left side of the restaurant by the bathroom.

903
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:32,140
Then there's sort of the main show floor, which that's where you're getting their close like close up view of the volcano.

904
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:35,280
That's where the plane is overhead.

905
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:38,320
Of course, not the real hemisphere dancer.

906
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:42,160
Yesterday, yes, the other plane, the facsimile of it, but it's still like move.

907
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,540
It's still pretty impressive.

908
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,660
Yeah, so pretty impressive.

909
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:46,420
And the bar is right there.

910
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:48,100
And that's where the action is.

911
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,660
I think we should have requested that.

912
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:53,660
Or one of my favorite places is the porch.

913
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:57,420
The porch outside is where I true.

914
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:59,820
That's the first place I ever ate at this Margaritaville.

915
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,440
I ate at Sunset.

916
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,740
Sometimes they got a guy out there.

917
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:04,620
He's doing covers.

918
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:08,260
He's playing all your favorite songs, some by Jimmy Buffett.

919
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:10,500
Some by Stephen Jenkins.

920
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:15,060
Some all the all the hits you could possibly want.

921
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:17,260
And you know what?

922
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:20,020
There are points to this Margaritaville.

923
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:30,400
But in keeping with generally the Orlando situation, you're much more likely to find performers at this establishment than the Hollywood location, which I think always just has a sign on it.

924
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,400
Yes, stop people from coming on the stage.

925
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:33,500
There is a stage.

926
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,000
And I feel like the first few weeks we went.

927
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:37,300
Yes, there would be performers.

928
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:41,680
But long ago, long ago, they stopped programming new music there.

929
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:52,580
But yes, this Orlando, this Orlando porch, which I think is the best place to see and eat.

930
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:56,340
Margaret, you got the view of Jason's beloved Islands of Adventure there.

931
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,300
Yeah, you got you can see the water there.

932
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:00,920
That's kind of maybe my perfect spot.

933
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:08,700
So yeah, when they I wasn't even thinking, but they seated us literally like what felt like two feet from the open door where you walk in.

934
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:13,820
Yeah, just not quite very near the bathroom, but which is not the best for for ambience.

935
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,260
We were at least under like a bunch of sharks, like hammerheads and.

936
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:20,000
Yeah, yes, there were still things.

937
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:20,720
There's not nothing.

938
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:21,500
It's not nothing.

939
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,080
Yeah.

940
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:22,260
Yeah.

941
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:29,520
But but, you know, so first, so we, you know, we're settling into like not the best right environment, I would say.

942
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:35,500
This is also the day where most of Universal Studios Florida was down.

943
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:36,320
Yes.

944
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,100
Yes.

945
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:40,460
Important to note a like historic park wide.

946
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,360
Most rides are shut down.

947
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,160
Like six are left.

948
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,240
Thus, they are telling people don't come in.

949
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:49,440
Go to Islands of Adventure instead.

950
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:50,620
Turn around.

951
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:52,660
That park was like especially stressful.

952
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,060
Right.

953
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:56,120
And it was kind of surprisingly hot for being November.

954
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:57,300
Don't come in.

955
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:03,320
There were people because there weren't any like clearly there were no real stress on the only rides that were open in there.

956
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:08,120
They're like, if you're gay, if you got tickets to both, you might want to consider going on some adventure instead.

957
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,200
They were trying to get people to not come.

958
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:12,280
There was no way to stop Six Flags.

959
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:22,280
Six Flags would have a situation where like the water, something's broken with the water system and it can't cool any of the rides.

960
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:26,440
Any of the breaks and they'd be like, yeah, it'll be OK.

961
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:33,820
Or they have like one teen spraying like a little hose or like a little spray bottle on the rides as it comes in.

962
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,760
Or putting like ice, just dropping a piece of ice on one of the wheels.

963
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,520
And now there's no ice for the beverages.

964
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:41,720
Yeah, right, right, right.

965
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:42,140
Sorry.

966
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:44,280
No, the drink ice is now ride ice.

967
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,220
Chain reaction.

968
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:47,940
They need that hose to clean up leaves.

969
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,540
They can't grab the broom five feet away.

970
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:53,520
They need that hose.

971
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:58,100
So so your experience, boys, you think it was more crowded because of this?

972
00:36:58,880 --> 00:36:59,560
I think so.

973
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:02,900
I found it to be a pretty stressful morning in the parks.

974
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:05,360
Every year there was a layer of stress.

975
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:07,300
And the Riteville, too, was.

976
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,080
Oh, no, empty, dead empty.

977
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:16,140
Well, it also all of the morning's events kind of made it admittedly to where it's like two, three in the afternoon.

978
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:18,020
So we're there kind of a weird time also.

979
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:29,160
So let's start getting into what we ate because the drink order definitely already had something to it for me.

980
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,360
I ordered the perfect margarita.

981
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:33,340
I think I had another margarita.

982
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:38,960
I don't think I need to say what's in it, except that it's for margarita aficionados.

983
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,300
We might we don't have to say them out loud.

984
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:46,360
But once everybody if you took pictures of the menu or you look at the Orlando menu, we should note price.

985
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:50,400
Because if we're having the exact same thing, I am curious, are those prices the same?

986
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:51,580
This is 1425.

987
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:58,900
Just if you ever notice when we do the Hollywood one, radically different, just might be an interesting compare contrast.

988
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,920
But anyway, perfect margarita.

989
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:01,900
It shows up.

990
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:02,880
It's fine.

991
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:06,300
Well, first of all, these drinks took a long time.

992
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:08,180
These took a very long time.

993
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:11,460
I will say Waitress is like great.

994
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:12,880
She was so nice.

995
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:13,580
A lot of fun.

996
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:14,500
A lot of fun.

997
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:20,260
But it felt like she would forget about us for 30 minutes at a time.

998
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:22,760
Maybe she was just busy, though.

999
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:27,100
Yes, of course.

1000
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:27,880
Somebody into that.

1001
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:29,360
It's the management's fault.

1002
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,340
That's probably in some way.

1003
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:34,200
Another thing that might be I don't know if it's the manager's fault or whoever.

1004
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:35,980
I feel like maybe she was making the drinks.

1005
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,180
Also, I don't know.

1006
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:38,680
It's possible she was doing everything.

1007
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,520
Very possibly.

1008
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:44,340
It felt like things were when there would be things that needed to be fixed.

1009
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:46,680
They felt like they were fixed in a haphazard way.

1010
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,260
Let's just tease it like that.

1011
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:48,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1012
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:49,020
I agree.

1013
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:49,280
Yes.

1014
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:53,400
Making the drinks, cooking the food, setting off the volcano.

1015
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:55,520
All right.

1016
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:56,700
Go pour the green goo.

1017
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:57,560
Get it loaded up.

1018
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:01,780
The drink shows up and it tastes nice, but it has that thing.

1019
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:08,640
And this isn't the first time I've had this at a restaurant that serves margaritas, where sometimes I like the big wide margarita glasses.

1020
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:15,220
But sometimes you feel like, well, I sure did get four sips of that in between the ice.

1021
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:19,200
Yeah, like it's the ice spreads and fills out that glass so much.

1022
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:23,000
I really felt like this was not a single or a double.

1023
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:24,460
This was like this was a quarter.

1024
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:26,600
I got a quarter margarita and a lot of ice.

1025
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:33,300
Do you think maybe though it was like a Jon Taffer approved amount of alcohol as far as the restaurant still making money?

1026
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:35,700
Because he's very often worried about overpouring.

1027
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:37,420
Ice it up!

1028
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:38,560
Pour ice!

1029
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:40,640
You're doing it off ice!

1030
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:44,700
Don't sell blended because then you can't water it down with ice!

1031
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:47,000
That's why your wife left you.

1032
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:48,760
Taffer coming to main feed.

1033
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:49,780
I don't know if everybody heard it.

1034
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:53,340
You had to be on club three to hear, but Griffin free to come soon.

1035
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:55,620
Taffer one coming to main feed.

1036
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:57,400
I don't know if that's the words gotten out there.

1037
00:39:57,740 --> 00:40:00,940
Again, we're furious about this, but we don't want to do it either.

1038
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,540
But unfortunately, that's what has to happen.

1039
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:04,680
Drinks, fellas?

1040
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:08,740
Yeah, I had the Landshark logger pretty solid.

1041
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:09,840
I do like the beer.

1042
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:10,600
It's a good beer.

1043
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:14,480
And I wanted to get a very traditional meal.

1044
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,320
I'll just say that too.

1045
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:21,540
I won't say what I'm meaning yet, but I just wanted to because everybody's going to get different stuff because we really want to make sure we're all getting like a wide variety.

1046
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:22,880
Try to not repeat.

1047
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:26,760
Yeah, and I'm certainly I felt like I wanted to be traditional on this.

1048
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:27,120
Sure.

1049
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:30,220
So turkey mashed potatoes gravy.

1050
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,480
That was in his song, one of his songs.

1051
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:34,640
I would have ordered it.

1052
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,280
Thanksgiving meal in paradise.

1053
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:40,200
Stouffers.

1054
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:42,080
I get the wishbone.

1055
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:47,020
If he had lived a little longer, that song would have happened.

1056
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:47,600
He would have been.

1057
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:48,900
He's like, I'm out of ideas.

1058
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:49,420
Got to do it.

1059
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:56,580
When the AI takes over the deceased songwriters and bands catalogs, they will generate new songs.

1060
00:40:56,940 --> 00:41:00,320
It'll sub out French fries potato for mashed potato pretty quickly.

1061
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,780
That's a very easy switch.

1062
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:03,800
So, yeah, no, it's that.

1063
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:04,840
And that comes in a bottle.

1064
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:06,220
It's hard to screw that up.

1065
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:09,520
OK, you know, they don't get the bottle beer though, as opposed to they did.

1066
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:14,540
Let me just check the photo because now that you're saying that maybe someone else was drinking a draft.

1067
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,160
Maybe it was me.

1068
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:20,680
Maybe I'm misremembering because I've had so many land shark loggers over the years.

1069
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:21,560
I don't blame you.

1070
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:22,860
All the things I can say.

1071
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:24,460
I like the brand.

1072
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:25,160
Jason?

1073
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:27,920
I think, well, I was going back and forth.

1074
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:29,600
I wasn't sure if I was going to get a drink.

1075
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:31,280
And then I.

1076
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:34,520
After they all came, I went, you know what?

1077
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:36,580
I will get a drink, which was a mistake.

1078
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,220
And that took like another 20 minutes for me.

1079
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:50,600
I think I had the passion fruit guava cocktail, which I hadn't had a drink in a while, and it immediately made me lightheaded.

1080
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:55,380
OK, not in a good, not in a fun, not in a college drunk way.

1081
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:56,020
No, no.

1082
00:41:56,220 --> 00:42:00,720
Like, oh, maybe I shouldn't be mixing these daily steroids with alcohol.

1083
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:03,260
Like, maybe I shouldn't.

1084
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:07,480
Although they I think eventually were my savior, the steroids.

1085
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:10,000
Jason, Rick Flair used to do it all the time.

1086
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:11,740
You can't do it.

1087
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:12,620
Come on.

1088
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:15,480
I did have a bottle.

1089
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:16,520
They gave me a bottle.

1090
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:17,000
Yeah.

1091
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Did you want that or is that just that's how it happened?

1092
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:20,200
I like having the bar.

1093
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:22,100
I like the bottle because it's got the brand on it.

1094
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:24,280
I go in at a restaurant because I want that.

1095
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:27,320
I like I don't want beer at all if it's not.

1096
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:28,600
I actually don't drink.

1097
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:33,000
I don't disagree in most places other than that.

1098
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:33,660
You want below.

1099
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,000
That's an interesting little course.

1100
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:36,260
I want to see your land.

1101
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:39,800
You also get the consistency in the bottle.

1102
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:42,260
If you get a bottle at a restaurant, you know what you're getting.

1103
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:43,200
I love frosty glass.

1104
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,820
I'm not worried about though.

1105
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:45,880
Yeah, the frosty glass.

1106
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:48,800
I'm not worried about like they're going to pour it weird though.

1107
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:49,680
No, no.

1108
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:54,240
But if it's the end of a keg, if the end of it, I've had some like shitty beer.

1109
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:54,600
Sometimes.

1110
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:55,140
Yeah.

1111
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:56,320
But yeah, the big glass.

1112
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:56,700
I do.

1113
00:42:56,820 --> 00:43:00,140
The big glass is satisfying, especially if the glass is cold.

1114
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:00,640
Yeah.

1115
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:05,180
There's something about it that is more satisfying usually than a glass, a glass bottle.

1116
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:05,740
That's obviously.

1117
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:07,960
Well, I hope you liked it because you got to do it again.

1118
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,340
Well, I do.

1119
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:10,440
I did.

1120
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:11,540
I did and I will.

1121
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:16,120
Or just throw it out with no, or just request it not say anything and see what happens.

1122
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,220
Oh, good question.

1123
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:17,960
Oh, good point.

1124
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:19,920
You got to flash back to however you did it before.

1125
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:20,360
Okay.

1126
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,720
Is that bottom of a decoration on it?

1127
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:24,520
Well, it has the logo.

1128
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:26,140
Oh, on the top though?

1129
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:27,100
What do you mean?

1130
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:30,240
It's got like a lime in there with the little.

1131
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:30,960
A lime.

1132
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:31,340
Yeah.

1133
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:36,200
All right.

1134
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:36,680
Well, I will.

1135
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:37,100
You get a lime.

1136
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:39,580
That's part of the variable of repeating the meal.

1137
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:39,840
Right.

1138
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:40,580
Of course.

1139
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:42,420
Meals.

1140
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:44,960
Do we have an order?

1141
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,860
Who thinks they liked theirs the most?

1142
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:48,940
Mike.

1143
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:49,340
Okay.

1144
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:49,860
I think it's me.

1145
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:50,820
Let's go in opposite order then.

1146
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:53,240
So again, I'm really, I go, you know what?

1147
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:55,160
I have to be the traditionalist here.

1148
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:59,520
I have to be the one to really sample what like the chef would recommend, which I think

1149
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,360
is the cheeseburger in paradise.

1150
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:02,680
And I said.

1151
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:04,180
Which would the chef at Margaritaville.

1152
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:04,620
Yeah.

1153
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:05,640
What would the chef recommend?

1154
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:08,780
Also the server, also the host.

1155
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:12,720
Written in the largest font, like largest point size on the menu.

1156
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:18,960
She did mention the bartender a couple times, which is now making me think that was a fake

1157
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:19,280
out.

1158
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,820
It's like Trump's receptionist didn't exist.

1159
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:23,220
Yes.

1160
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:29,500
So I ordered and I said, look, if I'm going to do the cheeseburger in paradise, I'm going

1161
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:29,860
to do the cheeseburger in paradise.

1162
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:32,600
I want the most possible cheeseburger in paradise.

1163
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:35,020
So I ordered a double cheeseburger in paradise.

1164
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:39,580
A couple times a year I treat myself with a double cheeseburger.

1165
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:41,860
As a child, I think I've mentioned this before.

1166
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:47,280
I thought as I kept getting older, I would just keep adding patties to the hamburger.

1167
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:54,300
Cause I remember being like McDonald's having triple cheeseburger on the menu at one point

1168
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:55,360
and I was like 14 or 15.

1169
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:58,040
I was like, well, I think that's just what's going to happen.

1170
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:00,640
I keep getting more patties as I get older.

1171
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:03,720
Oh, finally 38.

1172
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:08,420
My mouth is like this big open.

1173
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:12,120
Your mouth is like a comber in the donuts scene in hell.

1174
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:15,800
So I go, you know what I'm doing?

1175
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:17,860
I'm doing the double cheeseburger in paradise.

1176
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:23,160
And I ordered it and it came and there was one patty.

1177
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:26,640
There was only one patty on the hamburger or on the cheeseburger in paradise.

1178
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:29,420
I mean, they do think math sucks.

1179
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:33,140
Very true.

1180
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:38,760
So normally I think I would have just eaten it.

1181
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:40,060
I don't, it doesn't bother me.

1182
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:45,940
I'm not, I very rarely ever send food back, but this was for a purpose.

1183
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:46,920
This is for a reason.

1184
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:49,720
So I said, I think, so I said, well, I'm so sorry.

1185
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:52,740
You know, like this was an, I don't, maybe she didn't hear double cheeseburger or whatever.

1186
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:55,320
She was very nice and she said, oh, I'll take it back with her.

1187
00:45:56,040 --> 00:46:01,240
And I do think pretty quickly she came back out and it was very clear.

1188
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:07,240
They had quickly like cooked a burger and thrown a piece of cheese on it and just sort

1189
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:12,620
of haphazardly laid it on top of the existing cheese.

1190
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:17,160
Not that they needed to make a new one, but the presentation really, there was no time

1191
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:19,720
taken to make it sort of look like an organic.

1192
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:20,120
Yeah.

1193
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:23,240
Those, those cheeses are not relating to anything.

1194
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:23,760
Yeah.

1195
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:24,060
Yeah.

1196
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:24,300
Yeah.

1197
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:27,000
So like, and they're like hanging off the side or whatever.

1198
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:28,720
And I was like, this funny.

1199
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:31,620
Um, but yeah, they, they clearly were just like, ah, shit.

1200
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:32,180
What?

1201
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:32,640
Yeah.

1202
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:33,580
I didn't hear him say it.

1203
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:33,760
All right.

1204
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:34,940
Well throw it on there.

1205
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:35,620
I don't care.

1206
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:38,440
Pick it up, throw it on there and send it back out.

1207
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:43,920
This is also a bold choice because chain restaurant patties aren't usually super

1208
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:46,780
flavorful, but are usually very thick.

1209
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:50,760
Well, they would prove to be very thick as well.

1210
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:54,560
Uh, um, but you didn't, I noticed you didn't jump on the flavorful.

1211
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:58,260
Well, here's what I'll say.

1212
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:04,220
Here's what I'll say is that as I was eating it, I was like, this tastes good to

1213
00:47:04,220 --> 00:47:04,560
fine.

1214
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:08,520
It was not the best cheeseburger I've ever, I've ever had, but it's pretty good

1215
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:12,880
or whatever, but the amount of meat is so much.

1216
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:14,860
I cannot finish.

1217
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:17,540
Like I will feel my heart shut down.

1218
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:19,920
If I eat all of this,

1219
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:23,260
but they did offer the double that wasn't out of nowhere.

1220
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:24,860
They do say make it a double or did you?

1221
00:47:24,860 --> 00:47:25,820
Yeah, no, I didn't order off.

1222
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:26,960
You didn't pull that out of no.

1223
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:27,240
Okay.

1224
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:27,680
Okay.

1225
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:29,500
I know the secret menu here.

1226
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:31,360
Throw another Patty on there.

1227
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:35,860
Uh, and I don't think the photo does a good job to convey that one of the patties,

1228
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:38,380
especially was like this thick.

1229
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:40,740
What's an inch?

1230
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:42,020
Yeah.

1231
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:42,740
Close.

1232
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,100
Probably a little under, but yeah.

1233
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:47,660
And then there, and then there was like a more normal sized Patty.

1234
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:49,460
They were both, they were mismatched.

1235
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:52,160
Kind of like a lazy dad at a barbecue.

1236
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:53,280
Yes.

1237
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:53,860
Yeah.

1238
00:47:53,860 --> 00:47:57,620
So like, yeah, dad was in the kitchen and he's like, ah, whatever.

1239
00:47:57,980 --> 00:47:58,420
Yeah.

1240
00:47:58,540 --> 00:48:00,380
They're in like, there's consistency.

1241
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:01,140
Who cares?

1242
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:05,260
And he wouldn't have had to worry because usually you're not stacking them together.

1243
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:05,740
Right.

1244
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:08,060
So no one would know that there was a difference.

1245
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:09,580
Literally they're on top of each other.

1246
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:10,180
You can tell.

1247
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:14,100
Um, so, but I'm eating this and I'm just like, the thing has fallen apart.

1248
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:16,200
And now like, I'm just left.

1249
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:19,780
I'm just left with these huge hunks of beef.

1250
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:24,060
Um, that like, and I've had, like, I'm eating, I've eaten all the bun.

1251
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:27,520
I've eaten the vegetables or like, whatever lettuce and tomato.

1252
00:48:28,220 --> 00:48:32,160
And it's just, there's so much meat that has a little cheese left in it.

1253
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,400
And I'm just like, I cannot finish this.

1254
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:37,540
Listen, it's going to go wild for these photos, by the way.

1255
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:38,220
Oh yeah.

1256
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:43,460
We got some of the best ancillary content you're ever going to see all month long.

1257
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:48,560
So I just remember going, okay, even though this, I have to stop now.

1258
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:52,920
I have to not completely finish this because it feels impossible to finish it.

1259
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:57,140
I don't want to spoil anything about everyone else's, but this was what six people.

1260
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:01,580
I don't think I've ever seen so much food left collectively on a table.

1261
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:02,640
Yes.

1262
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:05,260
It was shocking ways.

1263
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:08,320
Maybe two to three meals were had among the six.

1264
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:12,180
Does that kind of do it?

1265
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:12,460
Yeah.

1266
00:49:12,460 --> 00:49:14,820
So, so I will say like, okay, it was fine.

1267
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:19,000
I should not have pressed my luck and sent back for the extra Patty.

1268
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:21,140
That was not a good idea.

1269
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:25,600
I think perhaps if I hadn't done that, it would have been a much more

1270
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:27,920
pleasurable finishing experience.

1271
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:29,160
Pleasure.

1272
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:29,260
Yes.

1273
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:31,120
A pleasurable finishing experience.

1274
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:33,060
Again, in the annals of great Mike.

1275
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:34,100
Great things that I say.

1276
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:39,000
Let the record show that fine to good has been the highest praise of food.

1277
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:40,360
This entire saga.

1278
00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:44,440
We'll see.

1279
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:46,120
We'll see if we ever get above it.

1280
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:50,520
And also I asked Mike, I said, who do you think like there's the best?

1281
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:51,900
And that was the review.

1282
00:49:52,580 --> 00:49:52,880
Yeah.

1283
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:54,420
And that's by the for sure.

1284
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:56,280
By the way, I am the one who liked the meal the best.

1285
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:56,900
I think.

1286
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,400
I think Adam liked his.

1287
00:49:58,600 --> 00:49:59,420
We did not hurt.

1288
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:00,100
That's true.

1289
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:00,380
Adam.

1290
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:00,700
No, no, no.

1291
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:01,440
I think Adam made it right.

1292
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:01,780
Okay.

1293
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:03,080
I'm not totally sure what he had.

1294
00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:07,060
But the rest of us, I mean, this was the wall.

1295
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:08,880
Like this is the wall.

1296
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:09,460
We all.

1297
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:15,580
This is holding his cheeks like he's seen a ghost with a tunnel, with a tunnel painted on it.

1298
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:18,880
And we all just wily coyote did.

1299
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:21,460
Absolutely.

1300
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:21,940
Yes.

1301
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:22,560
Yeah.

1302
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:25,660
Do you, I let's let's stare each other down.

1303
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:26,340
Who do you think?

1304
00:50:26,580 --> 00:50:28,800
I don't really have like a story about mine.

1305
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:30,440
Well, that's the question.

1306
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:39,440
If we're going in ascending horror, I think Jane and I both ran into the same thing, which was, um, she got like.

1307
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:45,280
Uh, pasta dish and it got no chicken made a vegetarian.

1308
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:47,700
And she asked like, how spicy is that?

1309
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:52,860
And they're like, oh, we can put the chili oil on the side and it won't be spicy.

1310
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:53,920
And we got it.

1311
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:58,360
And she took a bite and she's like, it's really spicy even with the oil on the side.

1312
00:50:58,400 --> 00:50:59,340
And I took a bite.

1313
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:01,880
I'm like, yeah, that is pretty spicy.

1314
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,240
So she didn't get very far.

1315
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:07,040
Maybe it was read somehow as extra oil.

1316
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:08,140
I guess.

1317
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:09,900
But then I ran into a problem.

1318
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:14,780
So I would her jambalaya cause I was going to get fish and chips cause I didn't really have much of an appetite.

1319
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:16,440
And I'm like, oh, that's safe.

1320
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:18,140
And then I'm like, oh, that's so much oil.

1321
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:19,500
That's so much fried food.

1322
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:21,360
And I was like, okay, I'll get jambalaya.

1323
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:21,800
What's that?

1324
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:24,380
Just rice, chicken and, and do we sausage.

1325
00:51:24,460 --> 00:51:25,740
I got it with no shrimp.

1326
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:27,680
Uh, cause I don't eat shrimp.

1327
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:32,140
I, my family was convinced at a very young age, I was allergic to shrimp.

1328
00:51:32,220 --> 00:51:38,040
And I think it was just, we went to some shitty restaurants, but I've never braved it.

1329
00:51:38,820 --> 00:51:42,280
I've never, I've never, but I've had every other kind of shellfish.

1330
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:45,100
So I'm like, I can probably eat shrimp, but I just still have never.

1331
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:52,400
Are you allergic to the Bubba Gump shrimp character who even I just name, I already forget even the,

1332
00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:53,040
okay, there you go.

1333
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:56,820
I was going to say, we just, we've talked about it days ago and I already forget.

1334
00:51:56,900 --> 00:51:59,080
Jason, if you licked scampi, would you be okay?

1335
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:03,540
Um, I, well, there's a lot of grime on scampi.

1336
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:05,440
So I don't know if I would be okay.

1337
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:06,600
There's a lot of,

1338
00:52:07,310 --> 00:52:08,220
the allergies.

1339
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:10,730
If you were grime, I protect you.

1340
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:12,900
Cause you're not touching him.

1341
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:14,440
He's so grimy, you know,

1342
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:16,000
strengthen your tongue.

1343
00:52:16,060 --> 00:52:21,400
Jason, if you were post, uh, you were in a sort of a coital situation with scampi,

1344
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:22,120
would it be okay?

1345
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:22,860
An episode?

1346
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:23,660
What?

1347
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:24,780
The coital.

1348
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:26,640
Oh, yeah.

1349
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:31,080
You were in a coital situation with scampi, the Bubba Gump mascot.

1350
00:52:34,140 --> 00:52:36,020
I believe it's a phrase.

1351
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:37,000
Well, coital.

1352
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:38,800
Or you think when there's middle.

1353
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,900
You can't just say coital unless there's coital.

1354
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:41,440
Yeah.

1355
00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:42,620
Okay.

1356
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:43,140
Yeah.

1357
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:43,620
I don't know.

1358
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:50,040
When I started having an anaphylactic situation, if I was nailing scampi, I don't

1359
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:50,260
know.

1360
00:52:50,580 --> 00:52:52,980
Sector keeper has floated away from his chair.

1361
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:55,580
He's floated away.

1362
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:57,500
His spirit propelled.

1363
00:52:58,220 --> 00:52:59,320
He's losing strength.

1364
00:52:59,820 --> 00:53:04,300
Scott, this line of conversation was as unpleasant as my meal turned out to be.

1365
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:06,460
So I didn't get the fish and chips.

1366
00:53:06,820 --> 00:53:09,100
Instead, I got the jambalaya.

1367
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:15,640
So, okay.

1368
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:15,980
Sorry.

1369
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:16,480
Go on.

1370
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:16,620
Go on.

1371
00:53:16,620 --> 00:53:16,980
Sorry.

1372
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:17,360
Sorry.

1373
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:18,020
I'm back.

1374
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:18,460
I'm back.

1375
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:18,900
Okay.

1376
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:19,480
Okay.

1377
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:20,600
I don't want to derail.

1378
00:53:20,660 --> 00:53:20,900
Sorry.

1379
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:21,300
Go ahead.

1380
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:29,000
Um, I got the jambalaya and I took a couple of bites and I'm like, this is the

1381
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,620
spiciest goddamn thing I've ever eaten.

1382
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:33,720
And I have a tolerance for spice.

1383
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:35,480
Jane doesn't like spice.

1384
00:53:36,060 --> 00:53:37,780
I'm a little, I like spice.

1385
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:39,040
My stomach doesn't.

1386
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:42,080
So I try to go pretty easy on it.

1387
00:53:42,740 --> 00:53:46,180
And I've had a fair amount of Cajun Creole food.

1388
00:53:47,660 --> 00:53:49,540
So I, but I was not prepared for this.

1389
00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:54,060
So my mouth is suddenly on fire and now I'm feeling more lightheaded.

1390
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:55,080
Oh right.

1391
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:55,480
Oh yes.

1392
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:55,860
The light.

1393
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:59,260
So, uh, my mouth is on fire.

1394
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:01,040
I'm starting to have heartburn.

1395
00:54:01,180 --> 00:54:02,440
I'm feeling lightheaded.

1396
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:09,360
I believe I'm like having a tough time and I'm like extra vigilant about my

1397
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:14,520
health at the time, like I am trying to ret and I'm like, I don't think I can

1398
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:20,440
eat any, but like I like eat all, maybe like a third of it before I tap tap.

1399
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:21,140
Wow.

1400
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:21,580
Wow.

1401
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:22,020
Yeah.

1402
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:26,700
You know, like not to underline this situation over, but this may be important

1403
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:31,500
to note that you were like about a week out from being diagnosed with multiple

1404
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:33,320
sclerosis.

1405
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:37,240
So I was one meal is killing you.

1406
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:38,280
It's killing me.

1407
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:41,060
Now again, I had a few days of IV steroids.

1408
00:54:41,060 --> 00:54:45,720
I was on the pill steroids, so probably giving me a little bit of a

1409
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:46,920
cushion on the fall.

1410
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:50,920
So I don't think I was in bad shape.

1411
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:54,900
So if you're going to go to Margaritaville, just take steroids before.

1412
00:54:54,940 --> 00:54:57,220
Just take a couple of pills, steroids before.

1413
00:54:57,460 --> 00:55:01,060
Just get one of those boxes where it's like six to first day, then five, then

1414
00:55:01,060 --> 00:55:05,380
four, then get MS if you feel like you need to.

1415
00:55:05,620 --> 00:55:06,420
Provolactic steroids.

1416
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:07,040
Yeah.

1417
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:12,580
So, and make sure to use prophylacta if you are having intimacy with any chain

1418
00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:17,240
restaurant, you don't know chain restaurant, restaurant, if any, any shrimp

1419
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:17,720
coitus.

1420
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:18,700
Yes, yes.

1421
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:26,640
I don't know sector keeper.

1422
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:30,380
I didn't get the shrimp, but everything was spicy.

1423
00:55:30,380 --> 00:55:33,440
Did you know he called shrimp, he said, I didn't get the shrimp.

1424
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:35,740
That's when he's talking about scampi that way.

1425
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:36,980
That's so mean.

1426
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:39,740
No, I didn't get the shrimp in the dish.

1427
00:55:39,980 --> 00:55:40,700
I'm just saying.

1428
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:41,580
Right, right.

1429
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:42,640
No, we're talking about the dish.

1430
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:43,280
Is the dish.

1431
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:45,260
The jambalaya was spicier than the scampi.

1432
00:55:45,940 --> 00:55:48,560
And I'm not saying like, oh, it's so spicy.

1433
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:52,640
It was like, this is like a dull, unpleasant, it's like when you get a

1434
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:56,280
really spicy one, a buffalo, wow, when you eat one and you're like, oh,

1435
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:57,580
this is a weird, dull heat.

1436
00:55:57,740 --> 00:55:58,940
There's no flavor.

1437
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:00,140
It's just unpleasant.

1438
00:56:00,140 --> 00:56:02,660
Just the burning and not the fun taste.

1439
00:56:02,820 --> 00:56:08,600
I thought I was being responsible, not getting a plate of deep fried food.

1440
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:09,420
Yes.

1441
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:12,180
But wouldn't like the spice wouldn't have been the issue there.

1442
00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:12,840
So you know, wow.

1443
00:56:12,940 --> 00:56:16,020
So you went both of you avoiding spice ended up with a lot of spice.

1444
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:19,880
Jason, do you think that the ambiance helped or hurt?

1445
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:23,020
Do you think that made you, do you think it would have been better

1446
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:24,660
if you were in a less fun place?

1447
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:26,960
It was a little surreal.

1448
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:31,620
Oh, like the Jimmy hits playing

1449
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:36,820
as I'm like my head in my hand, like pounding ice water,

1450
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:40,820
because I'm just like, I just want and I had also eaten most.

1451
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:43,640
We had gotten like some appetizers.

1452
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:44,660
Oh, yes.

1453
00:56:44,820 --> 00:56:46,080
We missed those entirely.

1454
00:56:46,220 --> 00:56:48,680
Wait, we got and I don't have much to say about them.

1455
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:49,200
You know what?

1456
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:51,480
In an episode with a lot of negativity, I will say

1457
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:55,760
I do not have a lot of complaints about the

1458
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:57,400
lava lava shrimp.

1459
00:56:57,700 --> 00:56:58,480
I stand by it.

1460
00:56:58,620 --> 00:57:01,160
I think that whatever sauce they use, chili lime, a whole

1461
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:02,160
whatever is happening in there.

1462
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:02,780
Yes, I like it.

1463
00:57:02,780 --> 00:57:04,360
I look forward to having it again.

1464
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:04,740
I agree.

1465
00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:08,860
I the word is is it's spelled conch.

1466
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:11,660
How do you actually say this word conch conch?

1467
00:57:12,020 --> 00:57:12,160
Yeah.

1468
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:12,600
You know what?

1469
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:13,060
That's funny.

1470
00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:15,760
I would have probably said it the first way, but now that I'm self-conscious,

1471
00:57:15,820 --> 00:57:18,940
I just realized it's one of those that said different for no fucking reason.

1472
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:22,680
This was one of my requests because it's like, oh, you can only get these at some.

1473
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:25,300
Like this is mostly a thing you can get in Florida.

1474
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:26,180
Did you like it?

1475
00:57:26,340 --> 00:57:27,200
I did like it.

1476
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:27,700
All right.

1477
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:29,920
Carrots in those fritters for some reason.

1478
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:31,580
But you got pretzel sticks with it.

1479
00:57:32,020 --> 00:57:32,580
What's that?

1480
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:33,680
You're not a carrot guy, Jason.

1481
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:36,740
No, I just was confused whether there was too many carrots.

1482
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:39,020
I have to see if that's and I don't even know if they have it.

1483
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:40,260
We'll have to see if they have it in Hollywood.

1484
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:41,100
If it's a Florida thing.

1485
00:57:41,300 --> 00:57:42,060
I did like that.

1486
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:44,820
I like pretzel sticks with mustard sauce and house made queso.

1487
00:57:44,940 --> 00:57:46,940
And I liked the chips and guac.

1488
00:57:47,180 --> 00:57:50,360
So actually, I forgot the step that appetizer point.

1489
00:57:50,380 --> 00:57:51,620
We're feeling OK.

1490
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:55,080
And the icy drinks come out and we start having problems.

1491
00:57:55,300 --> 00:57:57,060
And then the main meal, we're having a lot of problems.

1492
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:59,640
Is appetizer point what they call it?

1493
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:03,000
That's just no, that was just a random combo.

1494
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:05,680
No, it's it's and again, one of one of Jimmy's songs.

1495
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:09,240
When it's so 97, that's sailing to app a tizer point.

1496
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:09,980
I'm out.

1497
00:58:10,260 --> 00:58:10,980
I can't.

1498
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:12,320
Appetizer point.

1499
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:15,200
I stepped in a bottle of artichoke dip.

1500
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:16,320
I'm mount hungry.

1501
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:17,920
I sailed the case.

1502
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:18,740
Oh, see.

1503
00:58:21,060 --> 00:58:22,220
So all right.

1504
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:23,520
So Jason's not looking great.

1505
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:25,580
I didn't I almost didn't realize where you were at,

1506
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:27,960
because I do have a video I took going around the table.

1507
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:31,700
And I did note that when I got to you, you just put your face in front of

1508
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:35,060
you, put your hand in front of your face and said, I don't want to be filmed.

1509
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:36,160
Yeah.

1510
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:37,460
A paparazzi scenario.

1511
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:41,100
Well, I think I was covered in sweat by that point,

1512
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:45,720
which was a mix of probably the food and like the last remnants of the heat.

1513
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:47,100
It was really odd.

1514
00:58:47,180 --> 00:58:48,800
We were stuck in heat for a while.

1515
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:52,820
OK, I look, I don't have a lot to say about my I got fish tacos,

1516
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:55,540
which I don't really go wrong with the most places

1517
00:58:55,540 --> 00:58:58,440
and where I've had good experiences at in Margaritaville.

1518
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:00,480
I think it's usually what I get there.

1519
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:05,620
I don't think I've usually paid twenty one ninety five for them.

1520
00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:06,840
But I don't know.

1521
00:59:06,940 --> 00:59:11,320
Look, we've I started going in 2016 and a lot has happened and a lot of inflation.

1522
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:16,220
And so anyway, it hasn't done me wrong before.

1523
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:20,680
But they show up and it is just bathing in.

1524
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:22,000
What is it?

1525
00:59:22,180 --> 00:59:23,700
What's a Kramer Kramer?

1526
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:27,980
It is it is taking such a thick, luxurious.

1527
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:28,660
Yeah.

1528
00:59:28,660 --> 00:59:29,520
Kramer bath.

1529
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:31,200
It's a lot of white.

1530
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:31,780
It is.

1531
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:32,020
Yes.

1532
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:33,680
The picture you're seeing it from afar.

1533
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:35,620
There's some more white in this.

1534
00:59:35,660 --> 00:59:37,620
You can't see fish, can you?

1535
00:59:37,820 --> 00:59:41,980
There's no it's like an extra white coleslaw.

1536
00:59:42,060 --> 00:59:46,820
You want to strip that there's a place in LA called Best Fish Tacos in Ensenada.

1537
00:59:46,820 --> 00:59:50,780
And they, you know, they they give you the

1538
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:55,620
cooked tortilla and the fish and you go over and you dress it how you want.

1539
00:59:55,820 --> 01:00:01,260
But traditionally, it's one strip of Kramer, one strip of red sauce or pineapple salsa.

1540
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:04,780
Does that come out of like one of those like icing tubes?

1541
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:07,620
You know, I'm talking about, or is there like there's a pump?

1542
01:00:07,660 --> 01:00:09,160
I think it's on places.

1543
01:00:09,340 --> 01:00:14,260
But if they make it for you, yeah, usually there's a strip of white sauce

1544
01:00:14,260 --> 01:00:20,040
kind of acts similar to tartar sauce to like add a creaminess, you know.

1545
01:00:20,140 --> 01:00:20,380
Right.

1546
01:00:20,540 --> 01:00:24,720
I'm also looking at this with a bit of fish that I see towards the end.

1547
01:00:24,740 --> 01:00:27,840
I don't think it was fried.

1548
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:29,680
I don't think they gave me fried.

1549
01:00:29,940 --> 01:00:31,620
Do you think they were like, I don't think I would have ordered.

1550
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:33,160
Was it blackened or grilled?

1551
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:37,060
I the menu only gives you the option seemingly for fried.

1552
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:40,300
And yet I think what's poking out the little bit you can see

1553
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:42,300
amidst the sea of white.

1554
01:00:42,300 --> 01:00:45,020
I think I don't think a very light beer batter.

1555
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:46,280
I don't know.

1556
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:47,540
That's extremely light.

1557
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:51,200
That looks more to me like that looks like blackened from a grill or something.

1558
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:53,360
Again, I'm not totally sure.

1559
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:57,140
Do you think that he put all he I'm just assuming there's a man behind

1560
01:00:57,140 --> 01:01:00,280
like cooking all this stuff that like fucked up and was just like, I don't know,

1561
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:04,720
throw the white stuff on it and they won't be able to see that it's not.

1562
01:01:05,060 --> 01:01:06,540
Just blind them with whites.

1563
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:07,360
Yeah.

1564
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:09,480
Hey, I don't know what hit them.

1565
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:13,500
No, this it looks like the blood that comes out of the androids and aliens.

1566
01:01:13,900 --> 01:01:14,780
Oh, yeah.

1567
01:01:14,780 --> 01:01:15,080
Yeah.

1568
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:17,480
Like an android died in the kitchen.

1569
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:18,300
Milky blood.

1570
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:20,640
And his head fell right next to my plate.

1571
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:23,060
And I I left a lot.

1572
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:27,260
There's so much left on this plate and entire tortilla because it's just soggy.

1573
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:27,880
Yeah.

1574
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:29,600
That was the after picture.

1575
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:31,240
Uh, yes.

1576
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:31,500
Yeah.

1577
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:32,860
So, yeah, entire tortilla.

1578
01:01:33,100 --> 01:01:33,840
I never touched.

1579
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:34,700
Yes.

1580
01:01:34,980 --> 01:01:35,220
Yeah.

1581
01:01:35,220 --> 01:01:35,400
Yeah.

1582
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:36,680
You're looking at a full plate.

1583
01:01:36,700 --> 01:01:38,640
It looks better than the one before, too.

1584
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:40,860
It was it looks more presentable.

1585
01:01:40,860 --> 01:01:41,220
Yeah.

1586
01:01:41,220 --> 01:01:41,440
Yeah.

1587
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:41,600
Yeah.

1588
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:42,900
You understand what you're looking at.

1589
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:43,260
Yeah.

1590
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:47,440
I should say I think Jane and I at some point in islands were like,

1591
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:49,260
yeah, kind of fading.

1592
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:50,680
Do you want to go back to hotel?

1593
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:52,820
Well, let's add a little energy.

1594
01:01:53,020 --> 01:01:54,240
We need to eat anyway.

1595
01:01:54,580 --> 01:01:55,880
We'll go to Mark.

1596
01:01:56,300 --> 01:01:58,220
We almost dodged this bullet.

1597
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:01,160
We almost were like, oh, we're going to eat the hotel.

1598
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:03,120
We may as well eat at Margaritaville.

1599
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:06,900
You know, well, we also though we you were a little bit probably cajoled into it

1600
01:02:06,900 --> 01:02:11,160
because the premise of let's let's like, you know,

1601
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:16,280
we discussed the possibility that you sector keeper would assign us

1602
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:19,100
having to have the exact meal to places.

1603
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:22,980
And when it ended, when it was passed down that it would be Margaritaville,

1604
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:28,580
it's just that that kind of like of all of the meals for this to happen.

1605
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:31,020
Now, this is and by the way,

1606
01:02:31,140 --> 01:02:34,640
we're recording this before we know what meal two is like.

1607
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:37,520
We now are going to have to go do this again.

1608
01:02:37,540 --> 01:02:39,260
What we have just described.

1609
01:02:39,620 --> 01:02:41,180
And I had totally forgotten.

1610
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:44,220
I was like, well, this Margaritaville has never steered me wrong.

1611
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:47,320
And then when I was thinking back on trips with my family,

1612
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:51,760
I remembered one trip where like the first day

1613
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:55,840
I met my dad and brother down there and my dad had like

1614
01:02:56,520 --> 01:02:58,560
basically a tooth dying.

1615
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:02,300
My God, he had a toothache and not because of the restaurant,

1616
01:03:02,300 --> 01:03:06,280
not because of the restaurant, but he made out with scampi.

1617
01:03:06,300 --> 01:03:10,860
And he has an allergic got into an emergency dentist appointment

1618
01:03:10,860 --> 01:03:11,600
the next day.

1619
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:15,160
And they I think they just gave me antibiotics and painkillers.

1620
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:17,540
And they're like, when you get back to New Jersey,

1621
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:20,440
you need a go to your regular dentist.

1622
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:22,180
So he went to a dentist in Orlando.

1623
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:22,880
Huh?

1624
01:03:22,900 --> 01:03:24,620
He went to an Orlando or a city walk.

1625
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:25,320
Here's the thing.

1626
01:03:25,380 --> 01:03:30,000
If you if you were in the city, what is this thing on

1627
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:31,380
first day?

1628
01:03:31,460 --> 01:03:32,520
I don't think they have a dentist.

1629
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:35,560
Islands of Adventure dentist at the top of the tower.

1630
01:03:35,900 --> 01:03:36,920
Menchie DDS.

1631
01:03:39,820 --> 01:03:43,020
Especially in a town like Orlando, there's a whole

1632
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:48,060
string of like you go to the front desk or you go to the concierge and go like,

1633
01:03:48,060 --> 01:03:49,420
I needed a doctor.

1634
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:50,620
I needed Dennis.

1635
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:54,560
And they're like, all right, call this number and they will put you in touch

1636
01:03:54,560 --> 01:03:56,340
with someone who can see you quickly.

1637
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:57,200
Yeah.

1638
01:03:57,200 --> 01:04:00,520
So he had a miserable meal at Margaritaville.

1639
01:04:00,740 --> 01:04:02,940
And then another time we were down there,

1640
01:04:03,020 --> 01:04:06,500
we got caught in the pouring rain and went into Margaritaville to eat.

1641
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:10,160
And he slipped on the water and like fell on his seat.

1642
01:04:10,860 --> 01:04:13,260
And we were all kind of everyone was kind of slipping.

1643
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:16,260
And like, but so I was like, oh, we had no,

1644
01:04:16,460 --> 01:04:19,220
it was hard rock that had never steered us wrong before.

1645
01:04:19,260 --> 01:04:21,060
We never had a bad meal at Hard Rock.

1646
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:22,380
I got confused.

1647
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:23,400
We didn't go to her.

1648
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:24,380
We didn't go.

1649
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:25,000
Yeah.

1650
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:25,600
Wow.

1651
01:04:25,700 --> 01:04:28,960
You have like a Kaiser Soze moment with Margaritaville.

1652
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:32,400
It just had never been me.

1653
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:35,400
I had never gotten it before, but I got hit.

1654
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:36,980
You're dead.

1655
01:04:38,580 --> 01:04:41,480
You know, we was fine every time, but like, yeah, it's just,

1656
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:44,660
I just remember I'm miserable in the Margaritaville.

1657
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:46,280
Well, boys, you're going bad.

1658
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:47,660
Yeah.

1659
01:04:47,900 --> 01:04:51,700
Great time to find that we have to do this exact thing again.

1660
01:04:51,700 --> 01:04:52,320
And you know what?

1661
01:04:52,460 --> 01:04:55,360
It's not just us here because as mentioned,

1662
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:58,360
well, I believe Jane will be joining us again.

1663
01:04:58,480 --> 01:04:59,600
I'm not making her.

1664
01:04:59,820 --> 01:05:00,080
You're not.

1665
01:05:00,300 --> 01:05:00,360
OK.

1666
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:00,700
All right.

1667
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:01,260
Never mind.

1668
01:05:01,260 --> 01:05:01,480
All right.

1669
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:02,420
Jane's out.

1670
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:03,460
Smart move, Jane.

1671
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:08,980
But another friend and for some of us, family will be joining us

1672
01:05:08,980 --> 01:05:11,500
as we go this very evening as we record this.

1673
01:05:11,500 --> 01:05:14,780
In fact, we will be joined by the level keeper.

1674
01:05:14,940 --> 01:05:19,360
But first, we need to get the level keeper's thoughts about

1675
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:21,960
his his alpha experience.

1676
01:05:22,140 --> 01:05:24,020
Let's see if we can bring him in now.

1677
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:27,380
Whoa, I know that noise.

1678
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:28,620
Boys, boys.

1679
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:29,720
Oh, he's back.

1680
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:31,240
The level keeper is back.

1681
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:33,860
The sector keeper disappeared in the level keeper.

1682
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:37,440
I guess you guys can't be in the same space or no.

1683
01:05:38,020 --> 01:05:40,080
He's scared away whenever he hears.

1684
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:40,700
Oh, yeah.

1685
01:05:40,820 --> 01:05:42,120
Trademark cowbell.

1686
01:05:42,140 --> 01:05:44,020
Your thing, you know, your thing.

1687
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:45,000
My thing.

1688
01:05:45,300 --> 01:05:48,420
I wasn't sure if it really was, but you've proven here that it is.

1689
01:05:48,420 --> 01:05:49,920
You always have it.

1690
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:50,780
It is cannon.

1691
01:05:51,060 --> 01:05:52,100
It's unavoidable now.

1692
01:05:52,380 --> 01:05:56,660
Boys, boys, I'm here to haunt you, much like our Margaritaville meal

1693
01:05:56,660 --> 01:05:58,940
from months ago still haunts me.

1694
01:05:59,260 --> 01:06:02,340
Well, yeah, we've been talking about what we had for a while,

1695
01:06:02,340 --> 01:06:05,760
but we were trying to recall your specific experience level keeper.

1696
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:09,240
What can you tell us about that that fabled Margaritaville one lunch?

1697
01:06:09,860 --> 01:06:13,480
Well, I, of course, got a grilled chicken sandwich.

1698
01:06:13,940 --> 01:06:15,640
Seems like something you can't screw up.

1699
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:18,580
Trying to order the plainest thing I could, basically.

1700
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:20,800
Yeah, basically the same chain of logic.

1701
01:06:21,220 --> 01:06:24,720
Grilled chicken breast, Monterey Jack cheese, applewood smoked bacon,

1702
01:06:24,820 --> 01:06:26,600
lettuce, sliced tomato, Dijon aioli.

1703
01:06:26,860 --> 01:06:28,260
Feels like a safe order, right?

1704
01:06:28,420 --> 01:06:29,120
You would think so.

1705
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:30,280
Yeah, it sucks.

1706
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:32,260
Oh, no.

1707
01:06:32,260 --> 01:06:33,760
Oh, you're kidding.

1708
01:06:34,080 --> 01:06:38,760
Poor physical composition, hard to handle and or bite.

1709
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:41,340
But applewood smoked.

1710
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:43,700
That's one of those phrases that means something, isn't it?

1711
01:06:43,700 --> 01:06:45,900
You know, it's not just some run of the mill bacon.

1712
01:06:46,100 --> 01:06:46,940
They took applewood.

1713
01:06:47,260 --> 01:06:50,800
They were there was rubbed in rubbed it with apples and wood.

1714
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:52,660
It's smoked and then smoked it.

1715
01:06:52,660 --> 01:06:55,340
That wasn't just they didn't just they smoked it like a cigar.

1716
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:56,040
Yeah.

1717
01:06:56,460 --> 01:07:01,480
My sandwich from memory was both very dry and soaking wet.

1718
01:07:02,300 --> 01:07:03,480
A conundrum.

1719
01:07:04,180 --> 01:07:04,640
Yeah.

1720
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:06,940
Yeah, that's wild.

1721
01:07:07,420 --> 01:07:09,660
How did your beverage go for you?

1722
01:07:09,660 --> 01:07:12,120
Well, my beverage got me drunk,

1723
01:07:12,220 --> 01:07:17,740
which took away some of the pain of the sandwich, which means not bad.

1724
01:07:18,460 --> 01:07:20,980
You're saying it's a passion fruit.

1725
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:27,680
I believe I got the passion fruit guava.

1726
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:29,040
Let me get this right.

1727
01:07:29,240 --> 01:07:30,660
But you saw you were between two drinks.

1728
01:07:30,700 --> 01:07:33,620
Somehow it didn't leave enough of an impression to remember forever.

1729
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:35,600
Fruit Guava cocktail.

1730
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:40,200
500 calories, which was margarita,

1731
01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:46,220
paradise passion fruit and silver tequilas, guava puree and homemade sweet and sour.

1732
01:07:46,540 --> 01:07:50,860
It also came with seemingly 27 maraschino cherry.

1733
01:07:52,260 --> 01:07:54,240
And those are big wide brimmed glasses.

1734
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:55,540
It's like a little cherry jacuzzi.

1735
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:58,080
No, it was just in like a straight up cup.

1736
01:07:59,340 --> 01:08:00,580
God, it wasn't even a fun.

1737
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:01,660
No, nothing fun.

1738
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:02,380
It's a glass.

1739
01:08:02,380 --> 01:08:05,980
But it definitely like kind of dull the pain of the meal.

1740
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:08,020
Well, that's good.

1741
01:08:08,340 --> 01:08:08,680
OK.

1742
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:11,800
Maybe that's the idea is like, well, look, margarita is in the name.

1743
01:08:11,900 --> 01:08:13,140
Yeah, that's the point of it.

1744
01:08:13,420 --> 01:08:14,800
And they won't even notice what they're eating.

1745
01:08:14,980 --> 01:08:19,680
My memory is that I felt so defeated after the meal that I went back to my hotel

1746
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:23,540
and did not even attempt to enter the theme parks again for the rest of the day.

1747
01:08:23,940 --> 01:08:24,260
That's right.

1748
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:24,900
We did not.

1749
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:25,220
Yeah.

1750
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:28,580
At any point after that, that was the end of our contact with you.

1751
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:30,260
So that means that you were

1752
01:08:30,260 --> 01:08:33,720
but then you were stranded and you couldn't like by not coming back,

1753
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:36,980
you didn't get to come back and enjoy the greatest spot for dining.

1754
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:37,860
City walk.

1755
01:08:37,980 --> 01:08:40,100
You must have been helpless without it.

1756
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:40,420
Yeah.

1757
01:08:40,420 --> 01:08:41,280
Well, I decided.

1758
01:08:41,660 --> 01:08:46,180
Let me see if I can make the margaritaville meal feel better in retrospect

1759
01:08:46,890 --> 01:08:49,800
by putting it up against an unworthy competitor.

1760
01:08:51,440 --> 01:08:55,780
So I went to the quote unquote Tiki bar at the Hilton Garden

1761
01:08:56,290 --> 01:08:59,960
or Orlando International Drive, which is a hut.

1762
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:02,400
That's pretty good, though.

1763
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:03,540
Or the pool.

1764
01:09:04,060 --> 01:09:04,320
Yeah.

1765
01:09:04,320 --> 01:09:09,240
A theming where I was regaled with such theming as a drunk guy yelling the N word.

1766
01:09:09,260 --> 01:09:09,920
Oh, God.

1767
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:11,940
And everyone else sitting around the bar

1768
01:09:11,940 --> 01:09:14,400
casually talking about how much they like Trump.

1769
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:16,380
No way.

1770
01:09:16,380 --> 01:09:19,200
You kept the secret from us until now, levelkeeper.

1771
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:22,420
And I ate a twenty dollar chicken quesadilla

1772
01:09:22,420 --> 01:09:24,720
that seemingly was prepared in a microwave.

1773
01:09:24,820 --> 01:09:27,980
And it was unquestionably better than my chicken.

1774
01:09:27,980 --> 01:09:28,420
Oh, no.

1775
01:09:30,100 --> 01:09:31,960
It really hit the spot.

1776
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:33,220
Oh, wow.

1777
01:09:33,700 --> 01:09:34,120
Wow.

1778
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:35,640
Oh, damning.

1779
01:09:35,860 --> 01:09:39,060
What a review with the cowbell of shame.

1780
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:42,400
The ambiance does sound worse for the quesadilla, though.

1781
01:09:42,440 --> 01:09:46,160
All I'm saying is that everything was stacked against the quesadilla.

1782
01:09:46,440 --> 01:09:47,140
I see what you're saying.

1783
01:09:47,540 --> 01:09:51,520
Yes, that horrible, horrible things happening as opposed to a fun volcano

1784
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:52,260
demonstration.

1785
01:09:52,260 --> 01:09:52,700
Correct.

1786
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:53,120
Right.

1787
01:09:53,220 --> 01:09:57,220
And yet, if you're judging purely food and you didn't end up feeling sicker,

1788
01:09:57,220 --> 01:10:00,840
you were improved by the end of the day as opposed to a new life.

1789
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:02,700
Oh, that's good to hear.

1790
01:10:02,820 --> 01:10:05,680
Well, and we're just glad that we could like get you in here,

1791
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:06,700
find out about that experience.

1792
01:10:06,780 --> 01:10:11,900
And then I because you will also be joining us as we repeat the meal.

1793
01:10:12,020 --> 01:10:14,940
Round two for Margaritaville Omega.

1794
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:17,860
You didn't know what you had gotten yourself into.

1795
01:10:18,700 --> 01:10:22,400
Double or nothing for Margaritaville, Los Angeles.

1796
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:25,060
The pressure is truly on.

1797
01:10:25,060 --> 01:10:28,840
And I also don't mean to like corner you here,

1798
01:10:28,860 --> 01:10:31,180
but I feel like a little bit of business has come up.

1799
01:10:31,300 --> 01:10:32,820
We've talked about you before.

1800
01:10:33,220 --> 01:10:35,360
Sector Keeper said good things about you.

1801
01:10:36,280 --> 01:10:36,280
OK.

1802
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:40,560
And as you know, people in your family have our kind of the key.

1803
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:44,040
We haven't gotten a good sense of the the keepers don't seem like a good bunch.

1804
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:46,320
But he said you're like he likes you.

1805
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:47,380
He gets along with you.

1806
01:10:47,700 --> 01:10:51,300
Could you imagine if I said the Gardner's don't seem like a good bunch?

1807
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:52,680
It's just from stories.

1808
01:10:52,680 --> 01:10:55,280
I heard a day to someone's ghost face.

1809
01:10:55,460 --> 01:10:58,820
I can point out the ends of the family that I don't feel the best about.

1810
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:02,760
It's just like they've taken advantage of him and his lottery winnings.

1811
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:03,980
And it doesn't seem like you have.

1812
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:06,980
But also something's up, though.

1813
01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:08,380
Mike, do you know what I'm talking about?

1814
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:08,980
I do.

1815
01:11:09,060 --> 01:11:11,900
But I think I think of where you're headed is there's a resolution

1816
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:14,420
that has already happened off, Mike, with me.

1817
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:15,360
Oh, yeah.

1818
01:11:15,380 --> 01:11:15,600
Yeah.

1819
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:16,960
I found the shirt.

1820
01:11:17,080 --> 01:11:17,980
Is that what you're talking about?

1821
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:18,320
Yeah.

1822
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:18,580
Yeah.

1823
01:11:18,820 --> 01:11:19,380
I've I've been.

1824
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:20,280
Yeah.

1825
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:20,740
Are you go?

1826
01:11:20,780 --> 01:11:21,780
Where has that all been going?

1827
01:11:21,780 --> 01:11:23,580
Oh, I was going to.

1828
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:27,340
I found I thought you had my CityWalk shirt level keeper

1829
01:11:27,340 --> 01:11:29,000
that you wore during the live show.

1830
01:11:29,240 --> 01:11:30,660
But no, I had stolen it.

1831
01:11:30,660 --> 01:11:33,260
Well, I didn't know if it was stolen or taken accidentally.

1832
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:36,740
This is OK, because when the sector keeper was saying

1833
01:11:36,740 --> 01:11:39,080
the level keeper is a good guy, I like him.

1834
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:39,340
Yeah.

1835
01:11:39,460 --> 01:11:40,940
Mike said, I don't know.

1836
01:11:41,060 --> 01:11:42,240
I'm not so sure.

1837
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:43,360
And you're sweet.

1838
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:44,660
So we're finding out now.

1839
01:11:44,860 --> 01:11:45,340
I have the shirt.

1840
01:11:45,420 --> 01:11:46,060
You did.

1841
01:11:46,240 --> 01:11:46,960
So what is it?

1842
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:47,760
This is Christ.

1843
01:11:47,980 --> 01:11:50,260
Was it just in another suitcase pocket?

1844
01:11:50,260 --> 01:11:51,740
It was actually in a drawer.

1845
01:11:51,780 --> 01:11:52,780
It was in a drawer.

1846
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:56,580
OK, I'm like tarred and feathered on a bunch of episodes

1847
01:11:56,580 --> 01:11:57,460
that are already.

1848
01:11:57,480 --> 01:11:58,320
Not a bunch.

1849
01:11:58,460 --> 01:11:58,780
Two.

1850
01:11:59,100 --> 01:12:00,140
Oh, not a bunch.

1851
01:12:00,340 --> 01:12:01,840
Too too many, if you ask me.

1852
01:12:01,860 --> 01:12:02,680
Not a bunch.

1853
01:12:03,020 --> 01:12:03,420
One.

1854
01:12:03,580 --> 01:12:04,980
And it was a brief comment.

1855
01:12:05,180 --> 01:12:07,080
Mike deserves the bell of shame.

1856
01:12:07,340 --> 01:12:08,160
Given the bell of shame.

1857
01:12:09,620 --> 01:12:11,520
Oh, Mike, how dare you judge it.

1858
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:15,040
We were told explicitly he's one of the good keepers.

1859
01:12:15,180 --> 01:12:16,960
I'm sorry to say that about your family.

1860
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:17,320
I wasn't.

1861
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:19,760
I definite about his stealing of the shirt.

1862
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:20,800
I said it's possible.

1863
01:12:20,820 --> 01:12:24,980
Also, I want to say a little backhanded, a little loaded to say one of the good ones.

1864
01:12:25,620 --> 01:12:26,860
No, I know.

1865
01:12:27,100 --> 01:12:27,280
I know.

1866
01:12:27,540 --> 01:12:29,700
I feel like some of the people you were at the bar with.

1867
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:34,440
I'm just saying that some of these keepers just said they've been taking advantage

1868
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:39,740
of our friend and she has he been taking advantage of us in turn by crashing at our homes.

1869
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:40,520
Possibly.

1870
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:40,840
A little bit.

1871
01:12:40,980 --> 01:12:41,260
Yes.

1872
01:12:41,380 --> 01:12:41,800
I don't know.

1873
01:12:41,860 --> 01:12:43,740
I'm confused about the entire.

1874
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:46,260
You got a complicated family.

1875
01:12:46,580 --> 01:12:46,580
Yeah.

1876
01:12:46,580 --> 01:12:49,060
I ask you to judge me as my own ghost boy.

1877
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:50,220
All right.

1878
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:51,120
Well, I'll try to.

1879
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:53,480
You're right, because I had a good time seeing the movie with you.

1880
01:12:53,480 --> 01:12:57,260
I had a good time at Margaritaville one, even though it didn't give us a good time.

1881
01:12:57,400 --> 01:12:59,620
I have my highest hopes for round two.

1882
01:12:59,660 --> 01:13:01,720
I think it's going to be better.

1883
01:13:02,280 --> 01:13:04,260
The best meal ever.

1884
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:06,300
All right.

1885
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:07,300
By level keeper.

1886
01:13:07,580 --> 01:13:10,060
We'll see you on the whole mega sector.

1887
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:11,080
All right.

1888
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:11,520
OK.

1889
01:13:11,680 --> 01:13:12,300
And he's gone.

1890
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:12,940
I guess.

1891
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:13,500
Can you guys.

1892
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:16,240
It's weird that he popped in and then you just you disappeared.

1893
01:13:16,420 --> 01:13:16,780
That's right.

1894
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:17,200
Yeah.

1895
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:17,360
Yeah.

1896
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:17,540
Yeah.

1897
01:13:17,540 --> 01:13:21,420
You guys can't be is it just maybe too much like like time time

1898
01:13:21,420 --> 01:13:21,960
cop rules.

1899
01:13:22,540 --> 01:13:23,020
Yeah.

1900
01:13:23,300 --> 01:13:24,220
What do you remember?

1901
01:13:24,460 --> 01:13:25,200
Wait, what are time?

1902
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:26,680
We're not to put you on the spot.

1903
01:13:26,680 --> 01:13:27,260
Oh, no, no.

1904
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:30,140
It's just like a Van Damme touches himself.

1905
01:13:30,140 --> 01:13:32,540
I think both Van Dammes die.

1906
01:13:33,080 --> 01:13:34,460
Oh, they can't touch each other.

1907
01:13:34,460 --> 01:13:34,920
Wow.

1908
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:35,120
Yeah.

1909
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:38,400
Oh, so then it makes sense that they couldn't they couldn't kiss.

1910
01:13:38,980 --> 01:13:39,620
No, no.

1911
01:13:39,780 --> 01:13:41,620
Two scampi's can't kiss either.

1912
01:13:41,860 --> 01:13:42,780
Oh, wow.

1913
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:44,560
Scampi's have time cop rules.

1914
01:13:44,620 --> 01:13:44,740
Yeah.

1915
01:13:44,740 --> 01:13:45,220
Love.

1916
01:13:46,280 --> 01:13:49,240
But of course, any of us could and should kiss scampi.

1917
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:49,520
Yeah.

1918
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:49,740
Right.

1919
01:13:49,940 --> 01:13:50,640
Got an allergy.

1920
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:51,320
Yeah.

1921
01:13:51,640 --> 01:13:56,600
Well, if you do remember, kiss one scampi, scampi alpha,

1922
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:59,320
and then you have to kiss another scampi, which is scampi omega.

1923
01:13:59,940 --> 01:14:01,400
It's more of a scampi.

1924
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:03,940
That's one of those like leveling things out in the multiverse,

1925
01:14:03,940 --> 01:14:05,920
keeping things even keeled.

1926
01:14:06,940 --> 01:14:09,280
So not a great experience for the level keeper either.

1927
01:14:09,540 --> 01:14:12,780
Let me add a couple dimensions to that.

1928
01:14:12,780 --> 01:14:15,680
No, I know you had to teleport out, but no, of course.

1929
01:14:15,700 --> 01:14:15,880
Yeah.

1930
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:16,400
What do you think?

1931
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:17,480
It wasn't it wasn't good.

1932
01:14:17,480 --> 01:14:20,180
And also, wait, so that means you didn't hear that this whole time.

1933
01:14:20,180 --> 01:14:24,080
You know, Mike's been accusing your cousin of stealing his shirt.

1934
01:14:24,120 --> 01:14:27,700
And then we found out when we talked to him, Mike had the shirt the whole time.

1935
01:14:27,700 --> 01:14:28,620
I got the airbrush.

1936
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:29,900
Yeah, I found it.

1937
01:14:29,900 --> 01:14:31,300
Where you found where was it?

1938
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:32,300
It was like deep in a drill.

1939
01:14:32,420 --> 01:14:33,820
I actually had put it away.

1940
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:36,040
Your shirt was with your other shirts.

1941
01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:38,320
You don't say my other deep in a drawer.

1942
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:40,500
Grabbed like a gun.

1943
01:14:44,260 --> 01:14:47,240
And fish way in there, way in there were my secrets.

1944
01:14:47,480 --> 01:14:48,800
I have really deep drawers.

1945
01:14:49,740 --> 01:14:51,340
So you wouldn't even like you can picture it,

1946
01:14:51,340 --> 01:14:53,220
but you're actually not picturing it less deep.

1947
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:54,720
That's what people like.

1948
01:14:55,220 --> 01:14:56,100
I like listening to the show.

1949
01:14:56,180 --> 01:14:56,680
I never met Mike.

1950
01:14:56,760 --> 01:14:57,540
Is he a nice guy?

1951
01:14:57,900 --> 01:15:00,400
Yeah, but he's got some deep drawers.

1952
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:01,800
He's got some deep drawers.

1953
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:05,400
So anyway, your cousin's being disparaged.

1954
01:15:05,460 --> 01:15:06,140
A lot's happening here.

1955
01:15:06,180 --> 01:15:08,840
Let me just add a little bit of aftermath because the meal,

1956
01:15:09,080 --> 01:15:11,260
I leave the meal not feeling great.

1957
01:15:11,260 --> 01:15:13,720
Also on this is really where it's becoming clear.

1958
01:15:13,720 --> 01:15:15,600
My voice is just ravaged.

1959
01:15:15,680 --> 01:15:18,480
Some of your guys are too, and I don't even know why.

1960
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:20,900
We're just all the day before been a very exhaust.

1961
01:15:20,940 --> 01:15:23,100
That's our Epcot food and wine day.

1962
01:15:23,720 --> 01:15:25,980
So everybody's like and the park is closed.

1963
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,020
That whole thing is happening.

1964
01:15:27,080 --> 01:15:29,180
So we're just like it was a breaking point.

1965
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:31,200
It was the wall, as Jason said.

1966
01:15:31,780 --> 01:15:32,880
Yeah, I especially at the what?

1967
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:35,740
Like, let me just take a bathroom break and maybe just kind of like

1968
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:37,540
splash a little water on my face.

1969
01:15:38,020 --> 01:15:40,420
And then at that exact moment,

1970
01:15:40,720 --> 01:15:42,860
because nonstop Jimmy Buffett music is playing,

1971
01:15:43,160 --> 01:15:48,280
I hear some familiar notes and I hear his cover of my very

1972
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:50,880
favorite Beach Boys song, Sail on Sailor.

1973
01:15:51,080 --> 01:15:53,020
I didn't know that he did sail on sailor.

1974
01:15:53,320 --> 01:15:55,200
Oh, OK, let's hear out his version.

1975
01:15:55,980 --> 01:15:57,720
Sorry, I know he passed away.

1976
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,080
This is dog shit.

1977
01:15:59,380 --> 01:16:03,360
You fucking like drenched everything that I like out of the song.

1978
01:16:03,540 --> 01:16:05,940
Virgins is more about being there.

1979
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:06,520
OK.

1980
01:16:07,080 --> 01:16:10,100
It's not necessarily that he was there.

1981
01:16:10,360 --> 01:16:13,280
I would have liked that the singing was way worse

1982
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:15,780
and the instrumentation was more simple.

1983
01:16:16,020 --> 01:16:17,980
Yell things instead of singing them when it was live.

1984
01:16:17,980 --> 01:16:20,180
But that's for the crowd that's there.

1985
01:16:20,500 --> 01:16:24,040
He might have been legally mandated to record it because it had the word sale

1986
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:25,960
not once, but twice.

1987
01:16:26,240 --> 01:16:27,380
The Beach Boys fell into that, too.

1988
01:16:27,380 --> 01:16:29,120
They started to be I've got summer in it.

1989
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:29,960
We have to do it.

1990
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:31,520
That's the only way we continue.

1991
01:16:31,740 --> 01:16:34,900
So that adds to the nausea for me.

1992
01:16:35,980 --> 01:16:38,200
You know, the jammed parks, it's crazy.

1993
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:41,740
And then then I take the the water taxi home

1994
01:16:41,740 --> 01:16:44,400
and I'm I'm I'm worn down.

1995
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:47,640
I know that I'm just going straight up to the bedroom.

1996
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:51,520
I and I get up there.

1997
01:16:52,120 --> 01:16:53,900
I just blackout curtains.

1998
01:16:53,960 --> 01:16:55,240
I'm just I'm in the dark.

1999
01:16:55,380 --> 01:16:58,760
I'm just I just need to be in the dark for a while here on a day

2000
01:16:58,760 --> 01:17:01,660
where we have theme park tickets and it's four p.

2001
01:17:01,660 --> 01:17:02,020
m.

2002
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:05,320
But I start feeling a little lonely in this moment

2003
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:07,880
because I did this trip solo.

2004
01:17:07,880 --> 01:17:09,320
I'm in the hotel room solo.

2005
01:17:09,620 --> 01:17:12,580
There was some thought given to, you know, my son's still young.

2006
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:13,120
He's three.

2007
01:17:13,180 --> 01:17:14,840
I don't think we're really going to we're going to bring him

2008
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:15,180
necessarily.

2009
01:17:15,320 --> 01:17:16,960
But it was we did think like,

2010
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:19,020
well, you know, we're going to go have a lot of fun in Orlando.

2011
01:17:19,220 --> 01:17:21,160
Maybe Aaron, my wife, should join.

2012
01:17:21,300 --> 01:17:22,360
Maybe she'd want to join.

2013
01:17:22,860 --> 01:17:25,440
And there was some consideration given to that.

2014
01:17:25,480 --> 01:17:27,720
And we talked about like and she was like, you know, what I'd like to do

2015
01:17:27,720 --> 01:17:31,440
is come for your guys live show and just do Universal.

2016
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:33,040
She didn't even want to set foot at Disney.

2017
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:34,620
Just do like a mini trip.

2018
01:17:34,620 --> 01:17:35,560
You just do a couple.

2019
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:39,420
And then once she heard once I started laying out

2020
01:17:39,420 --> 01:17:43,080
just how much City Walk was going to be part of this, she bailed out.

2021
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:43,740
Never mind.

2022
01:17:43,780 --> 01:17:44,760
I will stay at home.

2023
01:17:44,980 --> 01:17:45,380
Yeah.

2024
01:17:46,100 --> 01:17:49,380
And and I'm and at that point when she decided not to, I'm like, boy,

2025
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:52,400
I'm going to go have this big fun vacation without her.

2026
01:17:52,420 --> 01:17:54,040
And she's just going to be I feel so bad.

2027
01:17:54,180 --> 01:17:57,400
She's going to be just stuck doing all the parenting while I'm off

2028
01:17:57,400 --> 01:18:00,520
across the country, having the theme park time of my life.

2029
01:18:00,520 --> 01:18:04,020
Cut to the day that would have been her universal day

2030
01:18:04,020 --> 01:18:07,720
where the only thing she really wanted to do was our beloved ET adventure.

2031
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:12,520
She would not have been able to do it until maybe the very, very end of the day,

2032
01:18:12,520 --> 01:18:15,700
because it was shut down due to some water pipe breaking.

2033
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:17,580
So that would have been fucked.

2034
01:18:17,780 --> 01:18:19,660
Made all this so glad she didn't come.

2035
01:18:20,140 --> 01:18:22,480
Then I'm again, the premise being

2036
01:18:23,100 --> 01:18:24,860
I'm going to be having all the theme park fun.

2037
01:18:24,900 --> 01:18:26,920
And she's stuck parenting instead.

2038
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:29,680
She's like, I'm going to go have the best time that I can have.

2039
01:18:30,180 --> 01:18:31,540
I'll take them to nots.

2040
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:32,680
We'll see how that goes.

2041
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:38,520
Nots had just instituted an incredibly generous, very cost effective annual pass.

2042
01:18:38,860 --> 01:18:41,860
The cheapest annual pass you're going to find anywhere in theme park.

2043
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:44,520
So she activates that goes and use it.

2044
01:18:44,660 --> 01:18:47,820
So basically, I'm alone in the hotel room and I'm like, I got to check in with a family.

2045
01:18:47,900 --> 01:18:49,500
I'm missing the family right now.

2046
01:18:49,820 --> 01:18:52,500
Maybe, you know, she's she'll probably tell me like, oh, you know,

2047
01:18:52,500 --> 01:18:54,540
he wasn't sleeping and I'm exhausted.

2048
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:56,400
That'll make me feel like all right.

2049
01:18:56,420 --> 01:18:58,460
Instead, she says, we're at nots.

2050
01:18:58,460 --> 01:19:00,380
We're having a glorious day.

2051
01:19:00,500 --> 01:19:01,980
It could not be going better.

2052
01:19:02,180 --> 01:19:04,580
The chicken dinner restaurant was a huge hit.

2053
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:05,840
He ate all the fries.

2054
01:19:05,860 --> 01:19:07,460
He's got a big smile on his face.

2055
01:19:07,660 --> 01:19:09,160
Now we're going to go hit some rides.

2056
01:19:09,180 --> 01:19:13,360
And she sends me photos where he's beaming for the first time ever.

2057
01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:15,220
He's doing rides by himself.

2058
01:19:15,260 --> 01:19:17,380
There's little rides that an adult can't go on.

2059
01:19:17,380 --> 01:19:19,740
And he wasn't brave enough last time I went to nots.

2060
01:19:19,740 --> 01:19:23,780
Now he's in the little red Baron plane, the biggest smile I've ever seen.

2061
01:19:24,120 --> 01:19:25,160
Just a glow.

2062
01:19:25,460 --> 01:19:27,400
Then he's on a little truck ride.

2063
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:29,040
He's in the truck by himself.

2064
01:19:29,080 --> 01:19:31,060
He's so excited honking the horn.

2065
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:33,280
This ride is now gone.

2066
01:19:33,300 --> 01:19:34,280
They've taken it away.

2067
01:19:34,340 --> 01:19:37,680
Whatever the little truck ride was has been removed since this happened.

2068
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:41,920
I can never have this experience watching him in a little truck again

2069
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:46,920
because I am across the country in a darkened room, having eaten one of the

2070
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:51,760
worst meals of my life, which is also one of the most expensive meals of my life.

2071
01:19:52,060 --> 01:19:54,780
All the theme park fun is across the country.

2072
01:19:54,780 --> 01:19:57,520
And at this point, once the test text exchange has happened,

2073
01:19:57,520 --> 01:20:01,800
I try to take a little nap and I realize that I cannot do this.

2074
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:06,000
What I need to do is get up, go to the bathroom and throw up.

2075
01:20:06,440 --> 01:20:09,760
And I throw up a little bit of this food.

2076
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:11,500
It's not an explosive throw up.

2077
01:20:11,560 --> 01:20:13,060
Again, it was a very watery drink.

2078
01:20:13,180 --> 01:20:14,260
I cannot blame the sun drinking.

2079
01:20:14,380 --> 01:20:16,940
I'm not a person who throws up very often.

2080
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:18,500
I don't do it from drinking.

2081
01:20:18,520 --> 01:20:19,640
It's been many years.

2082
01:20:19,740 --> 01:20:22,120
I don't do it from just food ever.

2083
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:23,340
And it happened.

2084
01:20:23,340 --> 01:20:25,640
This was not necessarily food poisoning.

2085
01:20:25,880 --> 01:20:30,460
It was just a scenario of my body doesn't want this to be in me anymore.

2086
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:36,480
So here I am throwing up in the dark while my family is having the time of their

2087
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:38,920
lives across the nation.

2088
01:20:39,060 --> 01:20:41,660
You're describing is a very casual vomiting.

2089
01:20:41,980 --> 01:20:43,660
Yeah, I feel interesting.

2090
01:20:44,180 --> 01:20:45,640
The bit it's all it's honestly.

2091
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:47,240
And I haven't done this in a long time.

2092
01:20:47,240 --> 01:20:50,420
It's akin to a puking rally because I did rally.

2093
01:20:50,420 --> 01:20:51,340
We went and we're fun.

2094
01:20:51,340 --> 01:20:52,660
We did go on the adventure.

2095
01:20:52,660 --> 01:20:53,380
We do.

2096
01:20:53,380 --> 01:20:55,660
You and I had a little bit more fun that evening.

2097
01:20:55,660 --> 01:20:57,620
It's a laid back bar.

2098
01:20:57,880 --> 01:20:58,360
Yeah.

2099
01:20:58,360 --> 01:20:58,760
Yeah.

2100
01:20:58,760 --> 01:20:59,620
Buffett style.

2101
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:03,280
Just like, yeah, I'm puking quick little puke.

2102
01:21:03,620 --> 01:21:05,300
Am I remembering correctly?

2103
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:08,340
Did you eat this meal and then go on the Velocicoaster?

2104
01:21:08,740 --> 01:21:09,100
Yeah.

2105
01:21:09,160 --> 01:21:10,120
Oh, my God.

2106
01:21:10,460 --> 01:21:13,640
Well, that proves you had the best experience food wise.

2107
01:21:13,640 --> 01:21:17,240
You're remotely able to do that because I was even I was going through my phone

2108
01:21:17,240 --> 01:21:19,460
here just like after I took the photos from Margaritaville.

2109
01:21:19,460 --> 01:21:20,320
And I was like, oh, yeah.

2110
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:20,980
What did I do?

2111
01:21:20,980 --> 01:21:23,240
I mean, I'm in Port of Ventry.

2112
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:26,880
I'm just like taking photos in a Toon Lagoon.

2113
01:21:27,060 --> 01:21:32,320
I'm just loving like seeing gasoline alley and taking the gasoline smell in my nose.

2114
01:21:32,380 --> 01:21:32,820
God.

2115
01:21:33,100 --> 01:21:34,760
So like, yeah, it was a little bit of a heavy meal.

2116
01:21:34,760 --> 01:21:37,460
But I'm like I was on like Cloud 9 compared to everyone else.

2117
01:21:37,480 --> 01:21:38,400
You came back to life.

2118
01:21:38,580 --> 01:21:42,740
We blacked out for a couple of hours and we also were in a hotel room with two

2119
01:21:42,740 --> 01:21:46,720
queens that we were each like stretched out in our own bed.

2120
01:21:46,840 --> 01:21:48,420
Like, do not touch me.

2121
01:21:48,420 --> 01:21:53,580
And they knew the name of the person who worked at the desk there at the at the

2122
01:21:53,580 --> 01:21:54,760
hotel as well.

2123
01:21:54,760 --> 01:21:55,300
Oh, he knew.

2124
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:57,000
Oh, my God.

2125
01:21:57,420 --> 01:21:58,880
Now I'm blanking on her name.

2126
01:21:58,980 --> 01:22:02,040
No, who worked at the the restaurant.

2127
01:22:02,300 --> 01:22:04,240
OK, so she was really nice.

2128
01:22:04,420 --> 01:22:08,020
Learn the name of somebody at a hotel and shout them out on the podcast like they're

2129
01:22:08,020 --> 01:22:08,360
listening.

2130
01:22:08,580 --> 01:22:10,060
This this one was Sally.

2131
01:22:10,240 --> 01:22:10,580
Love you.

2132
01:22:10,740 --> 01:22:12,080
Thanks for the towel, Sally.

2133
01:22:12,720 --> 01:22:14,760
She she would always say hi to us.

2134
01:22:15,560 --> 01:22:18,560
She was always offering us water and drinks.

2135
01:22:19,020 --> 01:22:21,600
And she's like, oh, it's a boat to Sapphire Falls.

2136
01:22:21,640 --> 01:22:26,900
Basically, take the boat to rural Pacific and just take the footpath next to it.

2137
01:22:26,900 --> 01:22:28,580
And it's about the same amount of time.

2138
01:22:28,580 --> 01:22:31,100
If you hit the Margaritaville, you've gone too far.

2139
01:22:31,240 --> 01:22:32,600
I did hit the Margaritaville.

2140
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:36,480
Margaritaville next to one of the side entrances to CityWalk.

2141
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:38,540
There is a security gate right there.

2142
01:22:38,660 --> 01:22:41,640
How can anyone how can you even be thinking of any of this now?

2143
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:44,120
How are your spirits high enough to talk about it?

2144
01:22:44,120 --> 01:22:44,720
And it's good.

2145
01:22:44,820 --> 01:22:47,620
It's a hop, skip and a jump away from I'm fucking.

2146
01:22:48,380 --> 01:22:49,600
I'm at my lowest.

2147
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:51,060
I'm at my lowest of low.

2148
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:52,980
I don't have some nice lady at the hotel.

2149
01:22:53,180 --> 01:22:53,960
Take care of me.

2150
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:54,700
Give me water.

2151
01:22:55,120 --> 01:22:57,200
My loves are across the country.

2152
01:22:57,660 --> 01:22:58,760
I am in the dark.

2153
01:22:58,940 --> 01:23:01,280
I'm in the I'm in the dark as I recall this.

2154
01:23:01,360 --> 01:23:02,680
Having little pukes.

2155
01:23:02,900 --> 01:23:06,500
Having little pukes and they aren't as easy going as Jimmy makes them out to be

2156
01:23:06,500 --> 01:23:08,380
with his famous song, Easy Going Puke.

2157
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:11,740
The Duke of Puke, they call it.

2158
01:23:12,460 --> 01:23:14,920
There's a chill as the Duke of Puke.

2159
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:18,760
I should have brought the Tums and Pepto I travel with.

2160
01:23:18,780 --> 01:23:19,660
I should have.

2161
01:23:20,140 --> 01:23:22,340
Next I'll be next time I'll be prepared.

2162
01:23:22,520 --> 01:23:23,360
Have we talked sector here?

2163
01:23:23,400 --> 01:23:25,760
Will you allow me to ask a question about Tum Lagoon real quick?

2164
01:23:26,020 --> 01:23:27,280
Yes, of course, of course.

2165
01:23:27,480 --> 01:23:29,280
OK, I feel like your

2166
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:33,140
your food sacrifices have given you a little bit of wiggle room.

2167
01:23:33,140 --> 01:23:33,640
OK, great.

2168
01:23:34,020 --> 01:23:34,680
What is this?

2169
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:35,620
What is this?

2170
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:38,500
There's like a little kiosk that sells beer and like snacks.

2171
01:23:38,660 --> 01:23:40,700
But it says at the top, ale to the chief.

2172
01:23:41,340 --> 01:23:42,520
Do we know what this is?

2173
01:23:42,640 --> 01:23:44,780
Was there a comic strip called Ale to the Chief?

2174
01:23:44,900 --> 01:23:47,220
No, is that like a Hagar the Horrible nod?

2175
01:23:47,640 --> 01:23:47,820
Might.

2176
01:23:47,980 --> 01:23:48,900
That's what I'm wondering.

2177
01:23:49,180 --> 01:23:50,120
That's why I'm asking the question.

2178
01:23:50,980 --> 01:23:51,860
Viking helmet on her.

2179
01:23:52,180 --> 01:23:54,720
This is something you think the sector keeper might know.

2180
01:23:54,760 --> 01:23:58,220
No, I'm just I don't want to get in trouble for going out of the bounds of City

2181
01:23:58,220 --> 01:23:58,360
Walk.

2182
01:23:58,420 --> 01:23:59,200
That's why I'm asking.

2183
01:23:59,900 --> 01:24:01,060
So ale to the chief.

2184
01:24:01,220 --> 01:24:03,800
But it's just it's like a little hand that looks like Beatle Bailey's hand or

2185
01:24:03,800 --> 01:24:06,860
something holding a big beer mug.

2186
01:24:07,460 --> 01:24:10,680
And then it says down here slurp and snack or ale to the chief.

2187
01:24:10,700 --> 01:24:12,740
And I'm realizing now, what is that from?

2188
01:24:13,280 --> 01:24:14,580
What is ale to the chief?

2189
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:18,760
I think it just kind of sounds like a little gentle play on words.

2190
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,880
Well, it's like sounds like one.

2191
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:22,440
I.

2192
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:23,780
Yeah, you know,

2193
01:24:24,060 --> 01:24:25,840
Jason is determining that it is nothing.

2194
01:24:25,940 --> 01:24:26,940
It is not from anything.

2195
01:24:27,040 --> 01:24:29,340
It says it says J Ward on the website.

2196
01:24:29,660 --> 01:24:32,500
Somehow it has something to do with one of the with Rocky and Bullwinkle.

2197
01:24:32,760 --> 01:24:33,060
All right.

2198
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:35,180
Maybe it was like one of those fables or something.

2199
01:24:35,220 --> 01:24:36,820
Those other side characters.

2200
01:24:37,660 --> 01:24:39,540
OK, well, we'll we'll do a whole episode on it.

2201
01:24:39,540 --> 01:24:41,160
I just want to know if anyone knew the answer.

2202
01:24:42,340 --> 01:24:43,960
Is it presidential like that?

2203
01:24:44,340 --> 01:24:47,680
Well, I mean, obviously that's the reference, but it just has a picture of a guy

2204
01:24:47,680 --> 01:24:48,740
holding a hand.

2205
01:24:49,140 --> 01:24:51,320
But the building doesn't look looks like a shack.

2206
01:24:51,540 --> 01:24:51,780
Yeah.

2207
01:24:52,060 --> 01:24:55,140
This to me, this illustrates here I am beaten down.

2208
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:57,660
And then Jason saying it's right by the side entrance.

2209
01:24:57,740 --> 01:24:59,580
And here Mike's saying, ale to the chief.

2210
01:24:59,620 --> 01:25:00,300
What's that about?

2211
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:03,480
I don't know how you guys are able to maintain.

2212
01:25:03,800 --> 01:25:08,100
Well, he was just feeling like shit, but he rebounded quickly to being like,

2213
01:25:08,100 --> 01:25:09,540
this illustrates how it goes.

2214
01:25:09,540 --> 01:25:11,020
I get down, I stay down.

2215
01:25:11,080 --> 01:25:13,480
You guys bounce back up higher than before.

2216
01:25:13,680 --> 01:25:15,580
You're going to be back at this Margaritaville.

2217
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:17,700
You just no way you guys don't go back to it.

2218
01:25:17,860 --> 01:25:19,340
We went at a wrong time.

2219
01:25:19,500 --> 01:25:20,400
This is what happened.

2220
01:25:20,460 --> 01:25:21,580
It's not an institutional.

2221
01:25:21,580 --> 01:25:22,680
We just had opened.

2222
01:25:22,760 --> 01:25:25,480
Obviously, the B squad was working and you guys

2223
01:25:26,100 --> 01:25:27,040
ordered one.

2224
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:30,300
How great is the food at Hollywood?

2225
01:25:30,640 --> 01:25:32,120
The Hollywood food is OK.

2226
01:25:32,340 --> 01:25:33,560
I've never had a bad meal.

2227
01:25:33,740 --> 01:25:34,640
Sectorkeeper, hear that?

2228
01:25:34,780 --> 01:25:35,640
He said OK.

2229
01:25:35,640 --> 01:25:41,100
In fact, yesterday was the anniversary of us going to the Hollywood one.

2230
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:42,340
I got a Facebook memory.

2231
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:43,560
The anniversary of it.

2232
01:25:43,820 --> 01:25:43,820
When?

2233
01:25:44,120 --> 01:25:44,340
Which one?

2234
01:25:44,360 --> 01:25:46,240
The first time we went, I believe so.

2235
01:25:46,260 --> 01:25:49,240
As a group, Jason, I went before because we went to the opening and Sajami play

2236
01:25:49,240 --> 01:25:50,820
there, which we'll talk about on the other episode.

2237
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:52,840
But yes, it was.

2238
01:25:53,420 --> 01:25:54,880
I'll find the picture real quick.

2239
01:25:55,080 --> 01:25:55,380
You're talking.

2240
01:25:55,440 --> 01:25:57,080
Haven't you already talked about that?

2241
01:25:57,140 --> 01:25:58,620
You have to talk about that again.

2242
01:25:58,820 --> 01:26:00,560
There's no way that wasn't talked about.

2243
01:26:00,860 --> 01:26:02,240
I don't have I don't have to.

2244
01:26:02,300 --> 01:26:04,780
No way that wasn't talked about eight times or more.

2245
01:26:04,780 --> 01:26:08,880
Maybe 2017 and the fan club from San Diego.

2246
01:26:09,640 --> 01:26:10,080
Yes.

2247
01:26:10,220 --> 01:26:12,540
See, you know it was my guarantee.

2248
01:26:12,540 --> 01:26:15,660
It has been discussed once, if not twice, if not eight times.

2249
01:26:15,680 --> 01:26:17,440
I didn't say it hadn't been discussed a little bit.

2250
01:26:17,440 --> 01:26:20,180
I'm just saying, like for the true episode about the one in Hollywood.

2251
01:26:20,640 --> 01:26:23,420
Look, certainly an important piece of knowledge, a piece of information.

2252
01:26:23,560 --> 01:26:26,040
OK, so get the full context crucial.

2253
01:26:26,640 --> 01:26:27,420
All right.

2254
01:26:27,560 --> 01:26:29,340
Well, look, we have to do that.

2255
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:30,500
We still have to do that.

2256
01:26:30,580 --> 01:26:34,540
And tonight, after having heard now you've heard what meals we've had.

2257
01:26:34,540 --> 01:26:34,900
Yeah.

2258
01:26:35,060 --> 01:26:37,760
Listeners, now we have to go have these again.

2259
01:26:37,880 --> 01:26:39,880
The same meals, the same meals.

2260
01:26:40,040 --> 01:26:40,160
Correct.

2261
01:26:40,180 --> 01:26:43,840
This is what we have backed ourselves into of all the place.

2262
01:26:44,100 --> 01:26:44,580
Sectorkeeper.

2263
01:26:44,940 --> 01:26:46,640
I know it's an interesting experiment.

2264
01:26:46,920 --> 01:26:49,340
Could this not have been Vivo Italian Kitchen?

2265
01:26:49,820 --> 01:26:51,760
Could this not have been Ante-Hito's?

2266
01:26:51,860 --> 01:26:52,780
I'm sorry, boys.

2267
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:55,440
If those had alphas and omegas, but potentially.

2268
01:26:55,880 --> 01:26:57,520
Ante-Hito's made me sick too.

2269
01:26:57,580 --> 01:26:58,340
What am I talking about?

2270
01:26:58,360 --> 01:27:00,460
All of these places are not good.

2271
01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:03,860
So, you know, even if they did, even if they did,

2272
01:27:05,040 --> 01:27:06,400
no, you have to.

2273
01:27:07,400 --> 01:27:08,520
I'm sorry.

2274
01:27:09,220 --> 01:27:10,820
It's just something about the bar, right?

2275
01:27:10,940 --> 01:27:11,400
The state.

2276
01:27:12,840 --> 01:27:16,760
There's time jumps and there's there's flash points.

2277
01:27:17,100 --> 01:27:17,660
Yeah, yeah.

2278
01:27:18,140 --> 01:27:21,180
Yeah, it all makes sense.

2279
01:27:21,460 --> 01:27:22,880
Alpha is the omega.

2280
01:27:23,100 --> 01:27:24,440
Omega is the alpha.

2281
01:27:24,700 --> 01:27:26,560
And we're just for beta.

2282
01:27:27,640 --> 01:27:28,060
Yeah.

2283
01:27:28,600 --> 01:27:29,660
Well, that's true.

2284
01:27:29,800 --> 01:27:31,300
Yeah, no, that is correct.

2285
01:27:31,300 --> 01:27:36,360
OK, well, so I guess now listeners can get in their own flash point.

2286
01:27:36,740 --> 01:27:40,540
And all they have to do is go to the second gate, patreon.

2287
01:27:40,540 --> 01:27:42,000
com slash podcast.

2288
01:27:42,240 --> 01:27:47,240
The right right now they can hear about this exact same meal occurring at the

2289
01:27:47,240 --> 01:27:48,200
Hollywood location.

2290
01:27:48,300 --> 01:27:49,360
Should we get this?

2291
01:27:49,640 --> 01:27:50,300
We should probably.

2292
01:27:50,420 --> 01:27:50,680
Oh, yeah.

2293
01:27:50,700 --> 01:27:51,500
Wait, do you see it?

2294
01:27:51,500 --> 01:27:52,940
Sectorkeeper, do you see the sector stone?

2295
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:53,440
Is it coming?

2296
01:27:53,780 --> 01:27:54,900
Oh, my gosh.

2297
01:27:54,960 --> 01:27:55,620
Look at it.

2298
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:56,560
It's the sector.

2299
01:27:56,560 --> 01:27:57,280
It's forming.

2300
01:27:58,300 --> 01:28:01,500
It's a third patty with cheese.

2301
01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:02,400
Wow.

2302
01:28:03,100 --> 01:28:03,440
Wow.

2303
01:28:04,940 --> 01:28:06,820
My cheese is still in the wrapper.

2304
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:07,520
Yes.

2305
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:08,100
Look at that.

2306
01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:10,060
Not even just thrown on.

2307
01:28:10,220 --> 01:28:12,520
It's still in its plastic wrapper.

2308
01:28:12,660 --> 01:28:13,220
Wow.

2309
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:15,800
You can ask for it paper style.

2310
01:28:16,520 --> 01:28:20,520
So Jimmy's special to make sure you have that on the secret menu.

2311
01:28:23,320 --> 01:28:24,060
Hey, it makes well.

2312
01:28:24,060 --> 01:28:28,760
You know, look, by the time people are hearing this, you have this pirate is

2313
01:28:28,760 --> 01:28:29,600
looking at 40.

2314
01:28:29,980 --> 01:28:32,320
You have looked at 40 and it makes sense.

2315
01:28:32,620 --> 01:28:34,720
You as you age, you get more and more patties.

2316
01:28:34,780 --> 01:28:37,760
Maybe your 40s are the time to start having that third patty.

2317
01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:38,120
Third.

2318
01:28:38,260 --> 01:28:39,940
Well, I tried third pat.

2319
01:28:40,020 --> 01:28:41,840
I think it's time for four.

2320
01:28:41,860 --> 01:28:42,260
Sure.

2321
01:28:42,260 --> 01:28:44,800
A couple of years when I was 14, I had three.

2322
01:28:45,020 --> 01:28:46,320
Oh, you've already done three.

2323
01:28:47,020 --> 01:28:49,420
Well, McDonald's used to have a triple cheeseburger on the menu.

2324
01:28:49,440 --> 01:28:52,660
And I did it a couple of times because I assume you have to eat more.

2325
01:28:52,660 --> 01:28:58,200
I mean, I believe they're bringing back the what was called the grand back for a

2326
01:28:58,200 --> 01:29:02,080
little while, but like an XL Big Mac, they think it's already back.

2327
01:29:02,080 --> 01:29:03,940
Oh, what was that?

2328
01:29:04,220 --> 01:29:07,220
I just I don't like a ton of meat on it.

2329
01:29:07,220 --> 01:29:11,000
Places, though, everyone's doing the smash burgers.

2330
01:29:11,120 --> 01:29:13,720
Now place their stack in the smash burgers.

2331
01:29:13,780 --> 01:29:15,240
So you end up with a giant.

2332
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:15,960
They are.

2333
01:29:16,080 --> 01:29:16,760
What do you mean?

2334
01:29:16,920 --> 01:29:18,340
I keep now they're stacking.

2335
01:29:18,340 --> 01:29:20,940
Double smash burgers on the menu.

2336
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:24,400
But Big Mac has already two patties on it.

2337
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:25,540
I like that one.

2338
01:29:25,540 --> 01:29:27,560
I don't like the quarter pounder patty.

2339
01:29:27,660 --> 01:29:28,420
That's ridiculous.

2340
01:29:28,700 --> 01:29:30,260
Cut to Jason having this burger.

2341
01:29:30,320 --> 01:29:31,540
He's complaining about tomorrow.

2342
01:29:31,960 --> 01:29:35,500
Mike having it three times this week, it making you sick every time.

2343
01:29:35,700 --> 01:29:38,000
Next week, you both go back and do it again.

2344
01:29:38,440 --> 01:29:39,680
This is guaranteed.

2345
01:29:40,240 --> 01:29:44,100
I know we can still shape what's happening in the multiverse, but certain things we

2346
01:29:44,100 --> 01:29:47,360
know certain things can't be diverted from the infinite.

2347
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:51,080
The symbol, the symbol that Jason and I ride on.

2348
01:29:52,060 --> 01:29:55,040
You're writing a mobius strip of shitty food.

2349
01:29:56,380 --> 01:29:58,100
Well, we got to go write it tonight.

2350
01:29:58,180 --> 01:29:58,980
So let's get out here.

2351
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:00,160
Listen, we have to go do it.

2352
01:30:00,180 --> 01:30:01,620
But listeners, you can go here right now.

2353
01:30:01,720 --> 01:30:02,520
Go to the Patreon.

2354
01:30:03,480 --> 01:30:05,280
Besides that, you survived this sector.

2355
01:30:05,460 --> 01:30:08,460
Thanks to Aaron Gardner for the art, our own Mike Carlson and Zach Reno for the

2356
01:30:08,460 --> 01:30:09,000
theme music.

2357
01:30:09,420 --> 01:30:13,320
And now please head to the second gate to check out the matching meal

2358
01:30:13,320 --> 01:30:18,560
at CityWalk Margaritaville, Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville

2359
01:30:18,560 --> 01:30:21,740
