1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Forever...

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
...Dark!

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Darkness falls out on the street, Evil rears its head.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Get your crazy shake to go, And your fried donut bread.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The villains threaten this sacred place, This downtown shopping mall.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
We must defend the Lego store, And the Splitsville bowling balls.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The Downtown Disney or to you, We must protect our AP discount meals.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The Downtown Disney or to you, With secrets does the Earl of Sandwich conceal.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Boys, boys, my cousin has been taken by evil forces that have inhabited Downtown Disney.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
In order to find them, he will need to thoroughly discuss every aspect of the mall.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Stores, restaurants, both of the Starbucks.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
We have 18 daily, very necessary episodes and much to do so.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I will be there to guide you and keep your conversations from getting too off topic or boring.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
The Downtown Disney ordeal, Why do we do this to ourselves?

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Welcome to Podcast the Ride, the Downtown Disney ordeal, level four, stage two.

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
My name is Mike Carlson, joining me as always Jason Sheridan.

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Hello.

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
And Scott Gardner.

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Increasingly deteriorating, Scott Gardner.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Yeah, we're all on edge.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Our mental states are declining.

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
We're crammed together.

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
It's faster than city walks.

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:37,000
The dog senses it and he has gotten, I don't know other way to say it, nervously horny because of it.

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
He's humping me because he feels such a nervous energy.

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
So he's attacking me when I'm walking around here.

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
We are losing our minds this much and it's so tense in here and he hates it.

28
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
The dog that is.

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Anyway, we're going to do a good episode though today.

30
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Yes.

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
And a bright light, hopefully who's brought us things.

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
That's going to have to help the situation.

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'd have to think.

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Yes.

35
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
So we have a lot to talk about.

36
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Let's bring her in.

37
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You know, we're from Instagram, Twitter.

38
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
You're an influencer.

39
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Travel and leisure.

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm a journalist.

41
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
A journalist.

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
An actual journalist.

43
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I'm a journalist who's very vain and loves to take photos places.

44
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I think, but I mean, we're all influencers, you know, in a way.

45
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
That is true.

46
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
So, but this is Carly Weisel.

47
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Hello.

48
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
She's back.

49
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Oh, we are sleepy this morning.

50
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Me included, even though I only saw celebrities yesterday because it's LA, but we, we will

51
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
be up.

52
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
We are, we are going to have good energy.

53
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Well, and I feel like a UCB coach.

54
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
We're going to have good energy.

55
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I think we will because you brought us things, treats in relation to the first of the stores

56
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
we're discussing.

57
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
We've already been to a Starbucks many stages ago, but now we are discussing Starbucks

58
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
West.

59
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Starbucks West.

60
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
My personal favorite.

61
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Downtown Disney Starbucks.

62
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Cause there are so many, you can have a favorite.

63
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Yeah.

64
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Yeah.

65
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Does it also trump the in-park?

66
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I mean, are we allowed to discuss the in-park ones?

67
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Oh, well that's a question and we don't, oh, you're right.

68
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Well, we need to check in with our guide through all of this, the sector keeper who I imagine

69
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
would be strict about the boundaries.

70
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
He's told us very plainly that it goes from the sorcerer's hat where the hotel starts.

71
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Yes, yes, yes.

72
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Only through the, uh, the temporary galaxy's edge Honda that's sitting in the Esplanade.

73
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
So we can't cross outside of those bounds.

74
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I want to respect him.

75
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And I also want to respect him by him officially giving us our mission for today.

76
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Boys, boys, today's stages, Starbucks West and Shugaboo and come.

77
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Okay.

78
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Great.

79
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
All right.

80
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
So confirmed from the horse's mouth, Starbucks West.

81
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Um, your favorite of the, your favorite of the two, I guess we'll keep it to the two

82
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
in respect to his wishes.

83
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
How, what, uh, what, what is the difference to you?

84
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Like why is one superior to the other?

85
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
To me, I'm shocked that you don't know that there's a difference.

86
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
There is such a monumental difference between the big Starbucks and Starbucks West.

87
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,000
We know that there is a difference in like, uh, production design, ceiling height, and

88
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
the other one Starbucks West is not made out of old box cars.

89
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Uh, it doesn't have the screen.

90
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
The chalkboard.

91
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
What the hell is this screen?

92
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
We had a lot of fun.

93
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I'll be honest with the chalkboard.

94
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
We did.

95
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
We planted a wild figure it out, but we had a lot of fun.

96
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Yeah.

97
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
And there was some confusing thing where they were trying to send a postcard to the Disney

98
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Springs one in Orlando and that wasn't really conveyed.

99
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
No, thank you.

100
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Oh yeah.

101
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Yeah.

102
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Yeah.

103
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
These interactive things that don't work to trade.

104
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Yeah.

105
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Thousands.

106
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Um, so my personal favorite Starbucks.

107
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Um, so I like it because to me, Disneyland is not my home park.

108
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Disney world is even though I live in California and the vibe at downtown Disney West Starbucks,

109
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
downtown Disney West is that the full, the full legal name.

110
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Uh, it's more of a vacation vibe because it's so close to the hotel.

111
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
So typically you get people who are there for conferences who are just exiting Disneyland

112
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Hotel to get coffee in the morning.

113
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
You have the parents who stayed at the hotel who are like, and they're way into the park

114
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
at like seven 30 in the morning.

115
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
So to me, it's like this little wormhole to Disney world while still being on Disneyland

116
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
property.

117
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I 100% get that.

118
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Yeah.

119
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It's even designed to go in one door and get out the other.

120
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Like the flow is so good.

121
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It was a godsend on galaxy's edge opening day at five in the morning.

122
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
That's the main mobile orders and pick them up and saved our lives.

123
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Saved our lives with no sleep at five 30.

124
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
How, how good am I the way to get up that day?

125
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Yeah.

126
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Now I'm interested.

127
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Did you stay at the hotel the night before?

128
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Yes, we did.

129
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Okay.

130
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
See, that's what it is because usually, I mean, the walking path could change everything,

131
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
but usually you get all the nobodies on the tram getting off the tram.

132
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
They're not going to backtrack.

133
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
They're going to go to the big Starbucks.

134
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Right.

135
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
So this one's like a little secret.

136
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
It's like a little, like a hidden little bar.

137
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Like, Oh, there's another one.

138
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Yeah.

139
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Huh?

140
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Yeah.

141
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I feel like it's a better, a class of people that are more, they're better.

142
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Comfortable.

143
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Not better.

144
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I would say definitely more stressed out.

145
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Interesting.

146
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
And that is my level.

147
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Like I want people who are like, if I don't get coffee, I will not make it through the

148
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
day.

149
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Interesting.

150
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
So cause there's more people, there's more loafers at the other one.

151
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Cause I've loafed there.

152
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I made it on the other episode.

153
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I've loafed.

154
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I have my computer out, downtown Disney.

155
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Absolutely.

156
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I've hung out there with friends, you know, just getting coffees, just sitting for a little

157
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
bit, just taking a break from the parks.

158
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
You don't take a break from the parks at Starbucks, downtown Disney West.

159
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
It is in and out.

160
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
You are right.

161
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
It is one door in, one door out.

162
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
You are getting your coffee.

163
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
You need your high.

164
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
You are out.

165
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
But we went in the afternoon, Scott and I, when we were down there a few weeks ago and

166
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,000
it was, even though we mobile ordered, it was empty and it was relaxed.

167
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
It was still like nice, but there's just a standing bar.

168
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
There's a standing bar.

169
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
So you can like take a breather for a second.

170
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Absolutely.

171
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
You're not like lollygagging.

172
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Nope.

173
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
It is nice.

174
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
It's really, it's, I dare I say like the August cantina of Starbucks.

175
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
There's nowhere to sit.

176
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Like you can only stand, you get your drink immediately.

177
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Like it's somewhere to sit.

178
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
If you have a group of 10, absolutely bag.

179
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
And then you have like seven children.

180
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Sure.

181
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Sure.

182
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
A family big enough to fill that booth.

183
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
The groups of two are all punished with standing with physical labor.

184
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Yes.

185
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Have you, do you stand, what's your move?

186
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Is it standing in there or is it going elsewhere to drink?

187
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Usually, I mean, I got stuff to do.

188
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Sure.

189
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
We're on a gun.

190
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
We're on a gun.

191
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
That's the Disney World way.

192
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Oh yeah.

193
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
You get your coffee, you are gone.

194
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,000
But I, it was my, my savior during D23 Expo because I would wake up, I think I would leave

195
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
my hotel at 6 30 AM or something like that.

196
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I was staying in Disneyland hotel and I would go in and get my coffee and then go back to

197
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
my room to get ready.

198
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
So it was like, that's what I did on Galaxy's Edge Day.

199
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Yes.

200
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I went and picked up the coffee.

201
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I went through security to get coffee, went back out of security to go back to the hotel,

202
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
which is a very funny move.

203
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
That's an odd thing if for the on the go nature of it and for people at the hotel, you have

204
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
to go in and out of security.

205
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I have a lot of feelings about, listen, I like Disney being safe.

206
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I appreciate it.

207
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Yes.

208
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
But I hate waiting in a line.

209
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
So we'll catch 22.

210
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
And they've kind of eliminated, there's not, so we're not in the security checkpoints,

211
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
the very exciting security checkpoints.

212
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Right.

213
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
We can't discuss that yet.

214
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Okay.

215
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Oh, is that someone else's?

216
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Well, but yes, it's just us.

217
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I'm just kidding.

218
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I'm just kidding.

219
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Am I getting in on their bag or no bag stuff?

220
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
That's where I was going to head is that I feel like it used to be a little easier to

221
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
kind of cut if you didn't have a bag.

222
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
And now you're sort of stuck in behind the bag people.

223
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
This is the last thing I'll say about security.

224
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:52,000
But I looked forward to for an ungodly amount of time leaving my hotel room to go through

225
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
that security with no purse because I carry everything with me.

226
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I'm like a future Jewish mother.

227
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,760
So for me to be able to have a hotel room and only go in with like my phone and my hotel

228
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:04,000
room key, I looked forward to it for so long.

229
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Just to be like, I don't have a bag and then go to Starbucks.

230
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
It was a, it was a real highlight of expo.

231
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I'm free.

232
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I'm unencumbered.

233
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Yeah.

234
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,400
They really should have like a no bag lot.

235
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,400
Didn't they?

236
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,400
Or do I think of a different place?

237
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:22,520
They used to when they only checked bags before the metal detectors, you could cut if you

238
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,960
didn't have a bag.

239
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,360
Isn't there, there's honestly that we should really talk about this in the end of their

240
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,400
episode, but should there be like a TSA pre-check at Disney?

241
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,000
I would pay so much money.

242
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Yeah.

243
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
So much money.

244
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Scan my entire body.

245
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I don't care.

246
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Just let me in faster.

247
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Yeah.

248
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I can't wait.

249
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I can't wait for that Disney.

250
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I hear that.

251
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Would we even get, would we get approved us as childless men?

252
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Good quote.

253
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,960
I mean, I think if we pay the $175 we would.

254
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:48,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

255
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,960
Sure.

256
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,960
So yeah, if it just comes down to finances.

257
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,960
Yeah.

258
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,960
Yeah.

259
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:56,320
So like, do they have to prove the TSA runs a background check?

260
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,320
Yeah.

261
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,320
That's my theory about it.

262
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,320
Yeah.

263
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,320
It's just like, give them, give them money and please, you can, you can drink whatever

264
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,320
you want on the plane.

265
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,320
They Google you.

266
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,320
They Google.

267
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:11,200
And if you are not in like a small town newspaper crime blotter, they're like, yeah, okay.

268
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,600
So yeah, please Disney work on that.

269
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,600
Yeah.

270
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,600
Yeah.

271
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,960
We're going to have to confess to the sector keeper that we did a little bit of pre-security

272
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,960
check.

273
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,760
Wait, am I going to be in trouble with the sector keeper?

274
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,760
I don't.

275
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,920
That's delightful and terrifying.

276
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,560
He's a nice guy, but he likes his rules.

277
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,880
He likes his rules, but he's mostly focused on Jeweling.

278
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,000
Now he's gotten really into Jeweling.

279
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,120
Now that it's like for local and it went, when it was gone, like you got to get your

280
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,120
hands on it.

281
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,680
It just seems like he was hanging out with some bad actors who got him into some, uh,

282
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,680
some weird stuff.

283
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,240
He seems a little depressed.

284
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,240
Yeah.

285
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,240
He's in adolescence.

286
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,240
Oh no.

287
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:49,920
He's getting a little rambunctious, little rambunctious, but directionless.

288
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,200
I'm sorry sector keeper.

289
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,200
It's all right.

290
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,200
He's, he's, he's hanging in there.

291
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,200
He'll forget in a second.

292
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,200
We'll bring him back to Starbucks.

293
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,200
We'll bring him back.

294
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,200
It's good.

295
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,200
Well, with that, we're bringing you back to Starbucks.

296
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,080
This will, this will give me the opportunity to take a sip of what, uh, what you ordered

297
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:08,880
for me because I was like, what, uh, you asked us for Starbucks orders.

298
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,240
Wonderful to bring a really appreciate it.

299
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,240
Bringing us beverages.

300
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:18,040
And I was like, well, my order is usually just boring black coffee, but yeah, yeah,

301
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,040
completely.

302
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,040
So I was like, I need to do something.

303
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,520
I need to do something elevated.

304
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:26,640
I need to do, I just want to do exactly what Carly ordered.

305
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,920
And before I get into that, even, I feel like I'd be remiss if I didn't ask you about, especially

306
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:35,560
via a friend and listener, uh, Dave's soldinger was like, what are you going to have Carly

307
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,560
on again?

308
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,960
You got to ask her about that cold foam, uh, specific conversation I had.

309
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:44,320
So now that, that moment is now, uh, explain the cold foam.

310
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,320
Oh guys, listen, it's been a real journey this year.

311
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,360
That's mostly what I can say.

312
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:55,680
Um, the top line of it is that I have accidentally become an influencer for a Starbucks product

313
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,960
that I make no money from.

314
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:00,720
I have only been spending money and spending time.

315
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:06,280
Now I, uh, I don't even, there's so many layers to it, but basically, oh my God, it did all

316
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,840
started downtown Disney West.

317
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,840
I didn't even think about that.

318
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,840
Was that this one?

319
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,560
It all began at the downtown Disney West Starbucks.

320
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,560
Perfect.

321
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,560
And, and you know what?

322
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,480
I'm coming from the grand Californian and I turned left and not right.

323
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,960
So that tells you how much I love this Starbucks.

324
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,960
Oh yeah.

325
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,960
You got closer.

326
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,960
That's a further walk.

327
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,960
And the other one's more themes to where you were.

328
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,240
It's an easier transition on the ice.

329
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,240
Very busy.

330
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:30,960
Gets overwhelming that I don't want to wait in the line with the tram people.

331
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,960
I want to go to the hotel.

332
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,960
That's true.

333
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,960
That's the issue.

334
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,960
Yeah.

335
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,960
So I went there.

336
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,600
Oh, I think it was something like 70 weeks ago.

337
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,720
I just wrote a whole story about cold foam, which is why I happened to know that off the

338
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,720
top of my head.

339
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:47,400
So it was 70 something weeks ago, I went there and they were promoting this new drink, which

340
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,600
was called a cold foam cappuccino.

341
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,840
And my order everywhere I go has always been an iced latte with less milk.

342
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:57,960
So kind of, but if you say iced cappuccino, a lot of doofs will pour a hot drink over

343
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,960
ice.

344
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:03,320
And then you have someone once told me you can get very sick from like them pouring foamed

345
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,160
milk over ice and then you drinking it.

346
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,160
Sounds like it.

347
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,300
So I do this like milk, like I do this thing everywhere I go.

348
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:13,320
Which gets so annoying to have to get those out loud.

349
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:16,720
I already have a very difficult aura about me.

350
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,040
Like I seem like a handful.

351
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:23,760
And so it's a lot to roll in and be like, hi.

352
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,600
So for this to be on the menu was fantastic.

353
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:30,640
And then the cold foam itself was a product that never existed before.

354
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:34,280
They invented a whole new line of milk.

355
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:38,120
And what it is is the core cold foam is skim milk in a blender.

356
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,120
That's it.

357
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,120
That's it.

358
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,120
It's skim milk, but more fun.

359
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,120
Huh?

360
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,120
Give me textures.

361
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,520
It's kind of like a meringue.

362
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:49,480
It's sometimes if you get like a Pisco sour or whatever those are, like where it has like

363
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:52,400
a little egg white foam, it's like that, but just milk.

364
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,400
It's just milk.

365
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,400
There's no sugar in it.

366
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,440
I can't have a lot of sugar because it'll put me to sleep.

367
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,440
Like it's just milk.

368
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,200
So it was the perfect drink for me.

369
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:04,320
I was asking Lindsay about this before you got here and she said it's a little bit like

370
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,880
the butter beer foam.

371
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,880
There's a similarity.

372
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,880
Yes.

373
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,880
But keep in mind there.

374
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,880
It's just milk.

375
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,680
There's no chemicals in it.

376
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,920
It's truly milk in a proprietary blender.

377
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:15,920
It's just aerated?

378
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:16,920
Yeah.

379
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:17,920
It's just the air that makes the foam.

380
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,920
It's not like a strong as fuck blender.

381
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:19,920
Okay.

382
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,920
Because I have tried it.

383
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:24,040
So this whole thing has exploded in a way that no one anticipated.

384
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:27,280
Where now like even Starbucks you see they're like, we got a pumpkin foam.

385
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,120
Like they'll just keep shoving out new foams.

386
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,120
Oh.

387
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,120
So what is a pumpkin foam?

388
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,120
Pumpkin foam.

389
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:37,680
So the pumpkin foam is the new cream foam, which is it's like more sugary and it's based

390
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,680
on cream.

391
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,840
It's like pretty caloric.

392
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:44,400
But it's part of like their new pumpkin cream cold brew line.

393
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,060
It's just the seasonal.

394
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,160
It's like a pumpkin-y foam.

395
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,160
And what is cascassera?

396
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:54,240
Oh, cascara foam is it's not a word that any of us know and they act like we do.

397
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,280
When I was ordering these drinks, they were like, would you like cascara topping?

398
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,280
And I'm like, that's not a word.

399
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,280
Yeah.

400
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,280
That's not some obscure variant.

401
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,800
That's not like cousin or cinnamon.

402
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,600
I still have no idea.

403
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,680
Is it someone's last name?

404
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:12,120
I think it's like some like vanilla, et cetera.

405
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,120
Extract?

406
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,120
Sure.

407
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,120
Whatever.

408
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,080
It's like when some places use dulce de leche to mean just caramel.

409
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,080
Yes.

410
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,520
When it's like, well, that's not really what it is.

411
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,520
Yeah, just say caramel.

412
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,520
It's fine.

413
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:30,360
So that the cascara foam is it is cold foam with a cascara syrup that is topped with cascara

414
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,400
sprinkles, which tastes like sand.

415
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,240
Not in my bag.

416
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,920
But those are the big foams are like the ones that go on the cold brew, which are sweet

417
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,540
cream or salted cream.

418
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:44,960
Those are more of a cream based cascara is this is so boring is not milk with a syrup

419
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,960
in a topping.

420
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:49,320
Do you have any idea what we've been talking about for many, many episodes in a row?

421
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,640
This is on the higher end.

422
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,640
All right.

423
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,640
This is my life passion.

424
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:57,240
You think we had a lot of passion about curl surf?

425
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:01,440
Honestly, the curls are more interesting.

426
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:08,560
I mean, whoever thought you guys could riff for so long on those like the body goo massage

427
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,040
machines at City Walk?

428
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,040
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

429
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,440
It works that that lit up the passion.

430
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,800
And we have some exciting stuff coming.

431
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,360
I imagine there's gonna be a lot of passion about bath bombs.

432
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,400
A little bit down.

433
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,400
Oh, yeah.

434
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:26,400
Well, Jason and I both went to rinse and got something and we tried it.

435
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,400
So we'll talk about that later.

436
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,400
Coming soon.

437
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,400
Yeah.

438
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,400
So soon.

439
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,400
Jason, you're barreling through those donuts.

440
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,400
I am.

441
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:36,720
So Carly brought us all drinks and we'll go through and get everyone's order.

442
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:41,040
But I wanted to bring a little taste of Philadelphia today's reporting.

443
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:47,560
So we've got tasty cake, frosted mini donuts, football edition, tailgate tested, fan approved.

444
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:51,960
It's football edition because there are pictures of footballs and goal posts on the bag.

445
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:52,960
Why are they Philadelphia?

446
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,080
Oh, tasty cakes are from Philadelphia.

447
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,080
Oh, is that like a hometown?

448
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,400
Is that like a Lou Malnati's?

449
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:02,560
It's like a regional version of like hostess.

450
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,200
Do they literally make tasty cake in Philadelphia?

451
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,560
I believe there is still a bakery or two in Philadelphia.

452
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,560
Oh.

453
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,560
Pass that along.

454
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,560
Oh, thank you.

455
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,560
Take my mini donut.

456
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:17,520
And on a previous episode, I was talking about my love of donuts and like you can almost

457
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,520
get it.

458
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,520
I get a buzz.

459
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,520
I get a high.

460
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:23,880
If I can balance the right amount of like donut sugar and coffee caffeine.

461
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,880
Oh, yeah.

462
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,880
It's like I'm buzzing.

463
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,680
That's how I feel at like a wedding that's going too long.

464
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,280
And I'm like, do I take an Adderall?

465
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,080
What are we going to do here?

466
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,080
How did you bring us?

467
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,080
I don't know.

468
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,080
All two.

469
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,320
I mean, I am prescribed it.

470
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,960
I'm not familiar with that word.

471
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,280
Is that something that gets you high?

472
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,280
I only know of donuts and cupcakes.

473
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,760
I am prescribed the lowest dose and I never take it because I'm scared of medicine.

474
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:50,120
But a lot of people like to abuse it because it just it if you if you don't need it, then

475
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,480
it makes you a real loopy.

476
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,480
All right.

477
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,280
And if you need it, then you're like, oh, this is what breathing for a normal person

478
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,280
feels like.

479
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,280
Hmm.

480
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,280
Is it similar to Ritalin?

481
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,280
I have no idea.

482
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:08,440
I feel like it took over the popular consciousness where like Ritalin was Adderall is now.

483
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:11,120
Ritalin was never like a fun drug to do.

484
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,000
I feel like people do Adderall for fun.

485
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,240
Adderall has like a cool like we're going to study and then rage.

486
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,240
Like that's a trend.

487
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,240
Yeah.

488
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,240
Ritalin.

489
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,720
I feel like I knew people in college who would sell their Ritalin to door mates.

490
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,720
Oh, we do Ritalin?

491
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,760
We have people who sell Adderall.

492
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,720
Maybe it's like a generational thing.

493
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,720
Maybe.

494
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,720
We'll ask the sector.

495
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,720
He'd know.

496
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:33,520
I think I would like Adderall, but that's another podcast.

497
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,720
That's a whole thing.

498
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,720
I do not.

499
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,720
I do not abuse drugs.

500
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,720
I do not.

501
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,520
No, I don't do anything fun except for literally drink coffee.

502
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,920
We all abuse frosting.

503
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,560
Let's all just admit to it.

504
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:50,120
And the foam and the foam I like the best is the numbing foam in that drink at Oogis

505
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,120
Cantina.

506
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:55,520
You guys are like baiting me to give my true thoughts about the Cantina.

507
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,520
You say good thoughts.

508
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,640
It gave me a little bit of a headache, that drink.

509
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,640
It didn't burn.

510
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,640
It didn't do anything for me.

511
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,640
Well, here's the problem.

512
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,640
And this is again, sector keeper is going to be mad.

513
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,640
I'm so sorry, buddy.

514
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:10,760
But the foam itself is different strengths on different days.

515
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,200
It's not consistent because I've had.

516
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,840
It is just like the cold foam then.

517
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,840
Yeah.

518
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:17,320
So maybe they're different bartenders at Oogis Cantina.

519
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:21,200
So what I'm talking about, there's a foam in the fuzzy tauntaun that's supposed to numb

520
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,200
your mouth.

521
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,120
And some people have speculated it's like wasabi.

522
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:29,280
It is a buzz button foam, which is a like a sister of the Szechuan peppercorn.

523
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,280
OK.

524
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,280
Right.

525
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,280
Interesting.

526
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,280
I have a job.

527
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,280
Yeah.

528
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,280
Yeah.

529
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,280
You know real things.

530
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,280
Chinese cuisine, using Chinese cooking.

531
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,600
Szechuan peppercorn can be.

532
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:43,080
It's very big and oh, oh yeah, like Szechuanese food.

533
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,080
Yeah.

534
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,080
Yeah.

535
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,080
Sure.

536
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,080
But they don't.

537
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:50,000
I've had strong where it hits my lips and it goes numb immediately.

538
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,200
And I've had ones where it doesn't.

539
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,440
And that also like is out of me is having this drink about five times.

540
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:00,960
So that's exactly what the cold foam conundrum is, because the reason this whole thing exploded

541
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,960
and became a thing is that they never make it the same.

542
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,720
And Starbucks is whole brand is supposed to be like ubiquitous and everything is exactly

543
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,120
the same wherever you go.

544
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,120
Yeah.

545
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,120
Yeah.

546
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,120
Sure.

547
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,020
So there is this one drink at Starbucks that they were promoting so hard that nobody knew

548
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,020
how to make.

549
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:19,720
And they still don't know how to make it.

550
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:23,400
Well, because what you brought us today, you were not satisfied.

551
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,800
I won't blame the store.

552
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,120
I won't say the name of the store.

553
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,120
I don't even know where you went.

554
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:31,840
But everywhere but the Disney locations doesn't know how to make it.

555
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,840
Oh, oh.

556
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:33,840
Yeah.

557
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,840
Well, then let me try.

558
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,080
I guess we'll consider this a bad version.

559
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,200
This is a this is a bad time.

560
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,200
So we'll start off.

561
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,520
The first reason this is bad is because they didn't give you the sippy lid.

562
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,440
You need the sippy lid to enjoy the full foam.

563
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,440
Oh, oh, because you get it.

564
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,440
You get an all foam sit right at the top.

565
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,440
Yeah.

566
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,440
Taking your lid off, Carly.

567
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,440
Oh, I don't fuck around.

568
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,440
You get the hit.

569
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,440
Maybe I.

570
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,440
OK, OK.

571
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,440
So will you will you say what this order is?

572
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,440
So OK.

573
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:00,640
So to give some context, they ended up getting rid of the ice cold foam cappuccino about

574
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,960
a month ago.

575
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:06,800
So we when I say we I mean like me and all of my Internet friends who now have a private

576
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,800
Facebook group.

577
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,800
We talk about foam all day.

578
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,800
It's a lot.

579
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,480
If you guys want to join it, the links in my Instagram profile.

580
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,800
It's a it's a gas.

581
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,320
I honestly it's my favorite thing.

582
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,320
I'm very blessed.

583
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,640
It has made my life so much better.

584
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,640
But it's all fun.

585
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,080
There's no weird factions forming.

586
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,760
We're all just like sharing phones being like, you did it.

587
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:25,520
Or if someone gets a bad one being like, oh, no email customer service.

588
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,520
This sucks.

589
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,800
I believe in you.

590
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,800
Get them next time.

591
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,800
I get it.

592
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:33,680
It's it's really it is the coziest comfort comforting corner of the Internet.

593
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,680
I love it so much.

594
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,680
I love you guys.

595
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,680
It's great.

596
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,680
Keep it foam focused.

597
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,880
Just don't let people talk about, let's say, Star Wars.

598
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:40,880
Then they start to lose their mind.

599
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,960
That's just the rule of society.

600
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:50,280
It's like part Disney, part cold foam, part makeup recommendations.

601
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,720
So it's basically like all three quadrants of my brain.

602
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,720
Great.

603
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,720
Wow.

604
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,240
But so we have been trying to crowdsource a new order because the ice cold from Cappuccino

605
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,240
is gone and it has not been going well.

606
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,160
What I have been trying is iced espresso.

607
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:11,720
We order a an ice espresso in a venti with the rest cold foam, which I've gotten mixed

608
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,720
results.

609
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,720
This is my first time trying to do that with mobile order.

610
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,720
It did not go well.

611
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,320
So this is this is like a mid experiment.

612
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,840
This is not road tested, but you're on your way to something.

613
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:21,840
Oh, yeah, we're getting there.

614
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,920
We're getting there because the thing is you have to either get iced espresso and then

615
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:28,360
grow from there or an ice latte and then shrink from there.

616
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,360
OK, interesting.

617
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:33,960
So you're trying to almost figure out what is a foolproof way to order it.

618
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:34,960
Yes.

619
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,040
So you're trying to make it will be essentially idiot proof making it.

620
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,040
Yes.

621
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,040
So that's the kind of the experiment.

622
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:42,200
Not to not to infer that anybody who works there is an idiot.

623
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,800
No, I just that was the best way.

624
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,240
They ever hire an idiot.

625
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,040
If there's ever been an idiot that worked at a Starbucks, I can't even believe it.

626
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:55,080
But I don't want to deem someone a genius for properly whipping milk in a blender that

627
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,920
you press a button and walk away on.

628
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:59,760
Like it's a testy position.

629
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:04,000
But I mean, I've had managers chime in and be like, what you have to do is ask for foam

630
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,440
on four or ask for very dense foam to get the right consistency of cold foam on because

631
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,480
yours, Scott's melted already.

632
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,480
It's pretty thin.

633
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,480
Yeah.

634
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,480
Let me grab a sip while I can.

635
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,960
Foam on four is probably like the setting of the blender.

636
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,960
Yeah, right.

637
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:18,960
Yes.

638
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,280
So and a lot of that stuff you can't say in mobile order.

639
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,640
You can't be like, can you like an internal blending term?

640
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,640
Right.

641
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:31,800
So yes, we ordered a I ordered a tall double shot on ice, light ice in a venti cups that

642
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:36,360
you have extra room for cold foam, blonde espresso, add cold foam.

643
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:38,080
And I just got one espresso shot.

644
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,120
Now I like it.

645
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,880
It's delicious to me, but I don't know.

646
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,880
I don't know any better.

647
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,160
I'm no as I said, I'm like black coffee.

648
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:48,200
If I rolled in here with some real cold foam, it would blow your mind.

649
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:51,880
I ordered your old default a few weeks ago.

650
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,880
Oh yeah.

651
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,220
Ice cappuccino with cold foam.

652
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:58,560
And I think my issue was I should have still added a little half and a half because the

653
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:04,440
cold foam, the cold foam sits on top and with the sippy cup lid properly applied, I was

654
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:08,720
just getting a hit of foam and then really strong cappuccino.

655
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,240
And I need a little cream.

656
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,240
I need some cream.

657
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,240
Yes.

658
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,880
It's and that's the other problem is that sometimes you'd get espresso and then foam.

659
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:18,920
And sometimes you get a full latte with like a little foam.

660
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,400
Have you looked into getting?

661
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,840
I'm so sorry to everyone who thought they were going to like have some cool Disney.

662
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:24,840
No, no, no, no.

663
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,480
They know what we're doing here.

664
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,760
We've been making an apology in every episode.

665
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:33,400
So you're Jason and I were talking about moisturizing our face behind our beards for a few minutes.

666
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,680
Oh, that is not for me.

667
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,680
Yeah.

668
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:41,120
So have you looked into getting a blender that's that strong that could do it?

669
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,120
I have.

670
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,120
I have.

671
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,720
So at this point, Starbucks and I have DM'd.

672
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,680
We have been chatting.

673
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,680
Nice.

674
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:53,080
And again, like keep in mind in no point where they like here's $5 for the good work you've

675
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,080
done.

676
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,480
And I was just like, you can get any kind of foam.

677
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,840
And I wrote back and was like, actually, the ice cold from cappuccino is discontinued.

678
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,340
Can you fact check these three things?

679
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:03,360
And they were like, oh, you're right.

680
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,360
Geez.

681
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,520
So like, you know, what better?

682
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,680
You know, the product better than they do in so deep.

683
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:11,040
I'm like, I have had to fact check so many things directly with them because we're all

684
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,040
just so confused.

685
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,040
Wow.

686
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,240
But you know what?

687
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,440
That Starbucks is one of the ones that does it right.

688
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,440
Wow.

689
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,440
OK.

690
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,920
Are there any non Disney ones that you've had success or is it like, do you think the

691
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:26,280
level the the customer service is better at the quality standards?

692
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:31,200
I always recommend a high yield Starbucks because they usually have people who know what's up.

693
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,560
Not like we're not like the Starbucks in the Vons that that's going to be trouble with

694
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,560
this kind of thing.

695
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,560
No, no, no, no.

696
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:39,680
Union Station Starbucks, maybe unions.

697
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,680
Is that downtown?

698
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,680
Like downtown by the train station.

699
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,680
Oh, I've never been there.

700
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,680
Oh, OK.

701
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,680
I'm just saying like that's a high traffic area.

702
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:49,480
But you don't want one that's too busy because then it's going to be.

703
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,840
Airport's not going to be good.

704
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:54,720
Oh, no, no, no, I always every time every time I go to the airport where there's a Starbucks

705
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,800
because we fly American, so there's not always one.

706
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,360
My husband's like, don't do this.

707
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,800
And I'm like, but I need to know.

708
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,960
And he's like, just don't just don't do it because you're going to get it and you're

709
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,960
going to be pissed.

710
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:04,960
And it's all you're going to be talking about.

711
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:05,960
Wow.

712
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,140
And he gets the fallout.

713
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:10,000
He gets the radio, the Chernobyl radiation fallout.

714
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Why?

715
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Why?

716
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Just find a new drink.

717
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
And I can't.

718
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
I'm too in love with it.

719
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,880
Is there an app you could start that could like mark ratings of how the foam is on each

720
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,880
Starbucks?

721
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,720
That is heavy lift, but I like that idea.

722
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,720
Yeah.

723
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:26,920
It's mostly if you go and you say if you're very nice about it, I always recommend I made

724
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:30,680
a whole grid online to be like, here's tips of how to get the right order.

725
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,680
And it's just like, be nice.

726
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,400
Just like be very Midwestern.

727
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,200
Be like, I am so sorry.

728
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,200
This is what I'm ordering.

729
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,200
I'm so sorry.

730
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,200
Also, can the foam be extra dense?

731
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,200
I'm so sorry.

732
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,200
Also, can it be extra foam?

733
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,200
I'm sorry.

734
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,200
I love you.

735
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:48,160
You have found a new like I feel like the mobile ordering in the app was so to accommodate

736
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:51,320
people's crazy drink or like kooky drink orders.

737
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,320
They couldn't hold my crazy.

738
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:56,200
And now we have figured out like, oh, they got to iterate.

739
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,920
They got to they got stuff for the new app.

740
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,320
They need a note section.

741
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:04,720
Yes, because this is my thing with mobile ordering on the Disney app is you can't make

742
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,520
you can't order a la carte.

743
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,520
Yes.

744
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:11,600
You can't because like those corn dogs are like $2 less if you don't get the chips or

745
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,760
the dry apple slices.

746
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,760
Yes.

747
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,760
Yes.

748
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,760
Yeah.

749
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:22,480
And I guess people aren't might not be the most eloquent, like typing out instructions

750
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:27,680
on their phone or it might be hard to like if someone's trying to go do five orders at

751
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,680
once or like what is this?

752
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:32,360
You know, like one out of every 10 would be like, was Walt Disney a Nazi?

753
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:36,320
Like it would just be sure writing things in that are just bananas.

754
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:41,940
I mobile ordered a Taco Bell a while ago and I had four items and I changed everything

755
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,640
as much as I possibly could.

756
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:46,720
And when they pulled up my order on the screen, I heard the person laugh.

757
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:52,760
I heard them go like, like, and they're like, OK, well, pull up.

758
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,520
Taco Bell almost encourages it.

759
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,280
Taco Bell is the best mobile app.

760
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,400
That's the best mobile ordering app.

761
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,480
You can do anything.

762
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,680
You can use any ingredient and put it on anything.

763
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,680
Really?

764
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,680
It's unbelievable.

765
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,640
I can't know this because I have a nacho cheese problem.

766
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,640
And so I can't even go.

767
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,920
Well, I sympathize with that.

768
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:12,260
But I would encourage you to try it because it is the most you feel like you're a chef.

769
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:17,800
You're a Taco Bell chef and you can try different sauces from different things on other items

770
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,080
and make it all with beans.

771
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,240
You can do anything you want.

772
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:26,640
You're a little Remy in the hair of the chef operating a body to make what you want.

773
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,640
And the chef's just like, dude, come on.

774
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,200
Yes, for sure.

775
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,200
What's Remy's chef's name?

776
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,200
What's the guy's name?

777
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,200
Mark?

778
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,200
Don't know.

779
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,200
It's not Mark.

780
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,200
It's not Mark.

781
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,200
I know.

782
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,200
We keep calling him La Poo.

783
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,200
I don't care about the movies.

784
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,200
We care about the movies.

785
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:46,280
We care about the stores next to the parks that sometimes have images from the movies

786
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,280
in them.

787
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,600
We want to be exceptional podcasters.

788
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:54,560
Just like Brad Bird tells us in all his movies, we have to be the best.

789
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:58,400
Listen, I'm going to be like fired.

790
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,400
Oh, yeah.

791
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,400
Pull it up.

792
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,400
I don't know this.

793
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,400
So real quick.

794
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,400
It's like a ring.

795
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,400
I'd say his name is like Chauncey or something.

796
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,400
It's like kind of a sad name.

797
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,400
No, it's like, no.

798
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,920
Chauncey is a sad name.

799
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:08,920
I think it is.

800
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,400
Like a Chauncey garden.

801
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,400
Chaunceys are listening.

802
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:14,400
You've offended all of our Chaunceys.

803
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,400
Linguini!

804
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,400
That's more fun than that.

805
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:20,400
And everyone listening to this is probably screaming Linguini.

806
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:23,800
This is some old ass episode of Blues Clues, but I promise I know these things.

807
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,800
I promise.

808
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,800
I'm just not good on this.

809
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:31,560
If he were in the parks, well, he's in Paris and will be in Epcot, but if he were in California,

810
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,560
I would know his name.

811
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,280
Yeah, that's true.

812
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:36,560
So real quick, going through the rest of the drinks.

813
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:40,080
I went very wild with one of my defaults.

814
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,840
Grande iced coffee with soy milk.

815
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:42,840
I'm going crazy.

816
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:48,360
Which, I mean, from a guy known for like getting a sundae in crunch time, I'm shocked that

817
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:51,280
you have such a plain coffee order.

818
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:56,800
You know, I don't like a lot of sugar in my drinks.

819
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,960
You have to save it for every meal.

820
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,560
I have to save it for my treats.

821
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:06,000
So coffee, iced coffee with half and half, iced coffee with soy milk.

822
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,960
I like all the milks and I like to switch it up.

823
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,560
And I thought like, hey, I'm going to add soy milk in a little while.

824
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:14,280
I feel like the sun burns brighter when you say the word treats.

825
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,440
Oh, that's so sweet.

826
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,440
It went up.

827
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,440
Treats.

828
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,440
We all say treats.

829
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,440
You say treats.

830
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,440
Treats.

831
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,440
Treats.

832
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,320
You turn into a cartoon chipmunk.

833
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:28,280
What I like to do, I get the crate when I get a free, when I get enough stars for a free

834
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:31,520
drink or I get my free birthday drink, then I go crazy.

835
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,880
Oh, so what's your crazy free order?

836
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:40,080
I think it's like the biggest possible vanilla latte they'll give you with.

837
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:43,480
I think you can get away with a quad with an extra shot.

838
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,480
Oh yeah.

839
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,480
Yeah.

840
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,480
Yeah.

841
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,480
On the free ones.

842
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,480
Cool.

843
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,480
Yeah.

844
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,480
Oh, so you must be up when you get that.

845
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,480
Pretty up.

846
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,480
Yeah.

847
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:58,000
That kind of balances out because I feel like it's not as much as caffeine.

848
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,520
And then the sugar that that's the buzz.

849
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,440
The sugar brings it to the buzz.

850
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,600
Yeah.

851
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:07,320
And I was going to say cold, cold and cold brew makes me vibrate.

852
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,320
Oh yeah.

853
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,320
Cold brew makes my heart hurt.

854
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,320
Yeah.

855
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,320
Wait, I didn't get you there, right?

856
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,320
No, no.

857
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,920
Just regular ice coffee.

858
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:18,080
If regular ice coffee or cold brew, I will just default to regular ice coffee.

859
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,100
Some places they would just have the cold brew now.

860
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,080
So I'd like to, I need to add like a lot of ice and a lot of cream.

861
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,520
I don't need a colon cleanse.

862
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,520
Like I'm fine.

863
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,520
Just give me espresso.

864
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,800
I mean, it's hard though when Duncan does like the happy hour.

865
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,800
Oh, I'm sorry.

866
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,800
That's like a known thing.

867
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,800
Nobody's agreeing with that.

868
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:31,800
Like it's known that like if you have cold brew, you're just going to poop a lot.

869
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,800
Yeah.

870
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,800
Like cold coffee, like just black coffee.

871
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,800
No, but cold brew is like.

872
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,800
It just rolls through me.

873
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,800
Yeah, cold brew can be really intense.

874
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:40,600
That's what I'm, I think I said in a recent episode, I'm like afraid of cold brew.

875
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,600
I've never tried it.

876
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,600
You should be.

877
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,600
Yeah, okay.

878
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,600
Terrifying.

879
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:49,160
We recorded it in the afternoon recently and I went to Dunkin Donuts and I was going to

880
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,960
order an iced coffee and they're like, oh, $2 cold brews right now.

881
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,720
And I'm like, oh, okay.

882
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:56,280
And I felt okay.

883
00:31:56,280 --> 00:32:00,320
Cause I had, I think cause I had a lot of food in my stomach, but I was still like vibrating.

884
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,320
Oh yeah.

885
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,320
Fuck you up.

886
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,480
Like every year you kind of sick from food.

887
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:07,360
It's like 165 out of.

888
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:16,160
It's only when I am doing, it's only when I like, this is a bad idea, but I'm going

889
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,760
to do it anyway.

890
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:21,040
It's usually caffeine is like a caffeine imbalance.

891
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:24,200
I think you have more like I'm full sick.

892
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,200
Yeah.

893
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,200
I think more I'm full.

894
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:30,240
You go like, oh, I'm full, which is like a thing, a cartoon character says.

895
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,240
Yeah.

896
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:35,960
Cause like I go, I go on full, but like you, like, I see the change happen when you're

897
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:36,960
full.

898
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:37,960
Yeah.

899
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:41,120
He's got to put on maternity clothes for a couple hours and then change back to regular

900
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,120
car.

901
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,120
Like back me up here.

902
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:47,600
Sometimes you eat it too much and you get a tummy ache.

903
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,080
Are you also a Jew?

904
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,080
No, I'm not.

905
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,640
Oh, see that's a big Jew thing.

906
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:56,600
Oh, is that like, you know, I'm an Irish, so just afraid the potatoes are going to run

907
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,600
out.

908
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,680
There's like some old John Mulaney joke about it where it's like Jewish girls are just always

909
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:05,440
like my tummy hurts and it's very true.

910
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:10,120
I also, uh, I've always since I was a young child to the other thing is like, I can use

911
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:13,560
the powers of my mind to give myself a stomach ache.

912
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:15,760
Oh, it's like stress born.

913
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:21,400
Uh, sometimes, sometimes my mom, like probably as a joke, cause a child was like, you worry

914
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,400
so much.

915
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,680
You're going to give yourself an ulcer.

916
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:26,680
And I've just been waiting for like a couple of decades now.

917
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:29,240
Like I'm waiting for the, the ulcers are coming.

918
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:32,720
One of these days I will worry myself to an ulcer.

919
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:38,440
I will be like Roger Sterling drinking a big glass of milk, pouring vodka and ice.

920
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:40,160
Um, fantastic.

921
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,160
Yeah.

922
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:47,120
Let's talk about, let's talk about another weird thing.

923
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:51,080
Mike's, uh, let me explain what I usually do.

924
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:55,040
I honestly, I think I should have gotten a, I got a couple, I think it was like six scoops

925
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,320
of cane sugar, which is their recommend.

926
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,720
I should have done four.

927
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:03,520
Um, so I have a green tea and it is full of ice and strawberries.

928
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:06,000
Uh, and it's beautiful.

929
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,600
Six pumps of liquid sugar, which is what I meant.

930
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:11,760
You sent a screen grab of the last thing I ordered.

931
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:15,440
And then I was sort of thinking like, I kind of like four, usually better.

932
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:19,600
Here's the reason I have, uh, first of all, I started putting, wait, did two Carly, you

933
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,800
sent like, here's what it's gotta be.

934
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:25,360
Well Jason, Jason sent me so much at it.

935
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,360
I just sent the screen.

936
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,360
Yeah.

937
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:31,240
I thought it, no, I thought it was great.

938
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:35,480
It was, it's like the encapsulation of your taste.

939
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:42,080
I don't really drink coffee and maybe I started not drinking coffee when I had like a mitral

940
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:46,480
valve prolapse in my heart when I was 13 years old.

941
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,520
Guys, you're all, you're all so sick.

942
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,120
No, no, not sick.

943
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:55,680
But my heart was racing while playing basketball and the doctor was like, that's kind of a

944
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:56,680
normal thing.

945
00:34:56,680 --> 00:35:00,200
Uh, you know, you probably like kind of stay away from caffeine or whatever.

946
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:03,440
So my mom of course was worried that I was going to die.

947
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,540
So it was like no chocolate ever.

948
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:09,600
So like for years, anything, I mean, there's the minor amount of caffeine, anything that

949
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:12,360
remotely maybe was in the room with caffeine.

950
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,720
She was like, you can't have it.

951
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:16,600
Your moms are both worrying you into the grave.

952
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,600
Oh my God.

953
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,320
Uh, yes, that's true.

954
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:24,920
Uh, so, uh, so anyway, so for years I wasn't really having any chocolate or whatever.

955
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:28,280
And then, you know, as you grow into adulthood is when you start doing coffee and I didn't

956
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:32,880
really do coffee, but after a while, you know, I slowly was eating a little chocolate, doing

957
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,120
this, having a little tea, putting green tea back.

958
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:39,400
And so I'm still not having coffee, not, not really because of the heart thing.

959
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,880
Um, but I've just sort of stuck on green tea.

960
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,440
I never developed a taste.

961
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,440
I'm willing to try.

962
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,440
I'm willing to get into it.

963
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:49,480
So I kind of regret not getting the foam now, but in general, it was a bad foam.

964
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,480
It was a bad foam though.

965
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,960
So I guess I didn't miss so much.

966
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:56,920
But also like when I showed up to your place, you did a little like anxiety dance of like,

967
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,640
oh no, I got the tallest drink.

968
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,760
Like you felt bad about it.

969
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,160
I did feel a little bad about it.

970
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:07,640
Cause I, cause so basically I realized that I like drinks more for not for even the caffeine.

971
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:10,600
It's really just for having a bottle, a baby's bottle.

972
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,600
Yeah.

973
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:16,880
It's like a what boy boy, a visco girl.

974
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,720
Like the like what cool teens are now.

975
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:23,640
And one of the things that you carry a hydro flask, which is just like a fuck ton of water.

976
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,640
Yeah.

977
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,640
Okay.

978
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:30,040
But I think, and I, I mean, I think this is not uncommon to most people that there is something

979
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:35,400
it's instead of smoking, for instance, having a big drink and something to do is a little

980
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,880
way to calm yourself down.

981
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:42,880
So if, so if I go in and get a drink, I like to get a big one and then I like ice and strawberries

982
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,480
because there's something to chew on once the drink is done.

983
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,640
I love those weird special K berries.

984
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,640
Yeah.

985
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:49,640
Oh, wait.

986
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:50,640
Are you talking about these or?

987
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:51,640
Yeah.

988
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:52,960
Well, those are like the two places that sell freeze dried strawberries.

989
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:53,960
Oh, like the cereal.

990
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:54,960
Yes.

991
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:55,960
It's like special K or those.

992
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:56,960
Yes.

993
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,960
Yeah.

994
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:58,960
No, I, they're good.

995
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:03,320
So I drink this over the course of whatever, uh, you know, an hour, hopefully probably

996
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,320
30 minutes.

997
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:08,680
And then I chew all of the ice and I eat the strawberries.

998
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:11,720
So it lasts long, a long time.

999
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:14,320
And then I search for something to do when it's over.

1000
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:19,840
So your pursuit of a drip, a drink is meant to calm you down mission, not.

1001
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:25,000
No, it's a perpetual, it's a perpetual looking for something to do or drink.

1002
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:30,080
I honestly wasn't expecting like your full life story from your Starbucks order.

1003
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,840
And I love that it went that way.

1004
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,840
Yeah.

1005
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,680
I mean, I I'm trying to self-analyze.

1006
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:35,680
Maybe there's other stuff there.

1007
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,480
You are directing your compulsions.

1008
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,480
Yeah.

1009
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,480
To something.

1010
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,480
Yes.

1011
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:44,480
Like when I leave the house, I like to have like a sparkling water or a kombucha.

1012
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:48,080
I always like some, there's something nice about having it in your hand.

1013
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,560
I think you have a purse.

1014
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,160
Like you're not carrying anything.

1015
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,160
Usually not.

1016
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,160
Yeah.

1017
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,160
Maybe a backpack.

1018
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,160
But see, I have like everything in my back.

1019
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,160
Yes.

1020
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,160
And you like have this something about you.

1021
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:58,160
Do you feel like armed for the day?

1022
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:02,640
I mean, no matter what happens, like I got medicine, I got earplugs, I got head, like

1023
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,280
I have everything with me.

1024
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,280
So a concert's too loud.

1025
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,280
I'm good.

1026
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,280
I have a headache.

1027
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,280
I have medicine.

1028
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,280
Like I, if my stomach hurts, I have Pepto-Bismol.

1029
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,280
Like I have everything with me.

1030
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,280
I have all these things.

1031
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,280
Yeah.

1032
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,280
Yeah.

1033
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,280
I do that.

1034
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,280
Yeah.

1035
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,280
I do that.

1036
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,280
It's great.

1037
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,280
I like pens, a couple notebooks, etc. Pepto-Bismol.

1038
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,280
Yes.

1039
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,280
A tent.

1040
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,280
A battery, a sweater.

1041
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,280
Yeah.

1042
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,280
See, we're in the same fucking wavelength.

1043
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,280
Yes.

1044
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,280
Yeah.

1045
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,280
You need something to do.

1046
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,280
You got everything.

1047
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,280
Yeah.

1048
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,280
So I understand.

1049
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,280
Like if you leave the house all willy nilly with nothing.

1050
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,280
Yeah.

1051
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,280
Sometimes I feel a little, yeah.

1052
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,280
I don't know.

1053
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,280
It's just, I think it's a, it's a baby's bottle essentially is what it is.

1054
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,280
No, but it's like you have something, like you have something to hold.

1055
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,280
Yeah.

1056
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,280
So that is.

1057
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,280
And you're hydrated.

1058
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,280
Yeah.

1059
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,280
Yeah.

1060
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,280
For some, yeah.

1061
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,800
I mean, sometimes it just drives me out a little bit, but yeah.

1062
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,360
So that's the, that's the rationale behind it.

1063
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,120
I'm willing to get into foam.

1064
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,400
I'm pro foam.

1065
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,400
I've.

1066
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,400
You can get it on a tea.

1067
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,400
I can get it.

1068
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,400
That's weird though.

1069
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,400
Yeah.

1070
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,960
I don't recommend it, but people in the group who don't drink coffee have said it's okay.

1071
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:01,600
There's times at Starbucks where people say like, do you want that with whipped cream?

1072
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,600
Meaning iced tea.

1073
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,600
No, I don't.

1074
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,600
No, I do not want that.

1075
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,600
That seems weird.

1076
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,600
That's very strange.

1077
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,600
No.

1078
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,600
Yeah.

1079
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,600
I don't know.

1080
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,600
Yeah.

1081
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:14,600
They, they, they have the different sugars in here and like I've tried, I like Stevia.

1082
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,480
I've talked on the show about Stevia before.

1083
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,480
I like Stevia.

1084
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,480
I see.

1085
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,400
I don't like any of the artificial sweet ones.

1086
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,600
I like a diet Coke or Coke Zero.

1087
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,600
Too much Stevia.

1088
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,600
No.

1089
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,600
Yeah.

1090
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,600
For sure.

1091
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,080
Like I, it's, it's, but there's a, there's the other ones I don't like, whatever they,

1092
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:31,400
I forget the names of them, but Stevia is okay, but I can't have too much.

1093
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,400
Splenda.

1094
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,400
Yellow.

1095
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,400
I don't love.

1096
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,400
Yellow, pink, blue.

1097
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,400
Yeah.

1098
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,400
Yeah.

1099
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,400
It's yellow, pink, blue.

1100
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,400
I'm trying.

1101
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,400
I was doing diet Coke for a little while.

1102
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,400
I got to stop doing it.

1103
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,400
Okay.

1104
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:46,280
But I was forced to watch some Bill Gates documentary thing on Netflix yesterday and

1105
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,320
that dude is chugging diet Coke.

1106
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,320
Well so is our president.

1107
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,320
Oh, you know what?

1108
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,320
Point counterpoint.

1109
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,320
I'll take it.

1110
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,320
Okay.

1111
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,320
Yeah.

1112
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,320
He's getting, he's getting a lot done.

1113
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,320
I was like, should I be drinking diet Coke?

1114
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,320
He's great.

1115
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,320
He's doing, our president's doing fine.

1116
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,320
He's in great health.

1117
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,320
He is somehow still alive.

1118
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,320
I mean, you'd think.

1119
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,320
That is true.

1120
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,520
There's a Keith Richards thing with him.

1121
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:05,520
Yeah.

1122
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:09,680
But it's not just like everything's precarious, a hundred diseases are all fighting each other.

1123
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:10,680
Yeah.

1124
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:11,680
Perfect stasis.

1125
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:12,680
I guess that's a Mr. Burns.

1126
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:13,680
Yeah.

1127
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,680
The three Stooges syndrome.

1128
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,680
Everyone tried to get through the door at once.

1129
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,680
Yeah.

1130
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:18,680
Perfectly balanced.

1131
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:19,680
I don't think, yeah.

1132
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,560
I don't think that diet Coke is going to kill me or anything.

1133
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:25,160
I think it's just, it's better for me not to probably just overall.

1134
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:26,160
I think so.

1135
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,160
So anyway.

1136
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:32,480
Now, Carly, can you settle Mike and I were discussing the first Star Mugs.

1137
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,480
Oh, whoa.

1138
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,480
Lindsay.

1139
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,480
We got to pay this off.

1140
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,760
I was talking to Lindsay and she asked, like, yeah, totally.

1141
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,200
I know she has to support me.

1142
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,200
That's part of it.

1143
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,200
But like, she was like.

1144
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,200
Waivering allegiance.

1145
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,880
She will tell me if she disagrees with me.

1146
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,760
She totally knew what I was saying.

1147
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:47,760
So wait, we're settled.

1148
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:48,760
You were against me.

1149
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:49,760
Is that right?

1150
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:50,760
Well, no, I wasn't against.

1151
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:52,440
You met me in the middle, as I recall.

1152
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,440
I met you in the middle.

1153
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:57,080
I am against this being an issue worth discussing in the least.

1154
00:40:57,080 --> 00:41:04,120
So I don't appreciate the apps like Duncan and Starbucks who make you completely load

1155
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:09,160
10 more dollars on the card as opposed to just being able to load what you're paying.

1156
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:12,480
I think it's sort of a psychological trick to make you go, well, I have eight dollars

1157
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,480
on the app.

1158
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:16,280
I'll go back to Starbucks as opposed to maybe some other place you would go.

1159
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,280
Yes, yes, yes.

1160
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,160
And so what is what side is everyone on?

1161
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:23,800
Well, I was saying, I think I kind of get why they do that.

1162
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:27,600
If you do it in person, I think they'll let you load like five bucks.

1163
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:33,280
But I think the app should prompt you to if you're like a buck 50 short or two bucks short,

1164
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,960
say, do you want to load this?

1165
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:35,960
You agree with me, though.

1166
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:38,960
You want customizable amounts, not like full.

1167
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:39,960
It's 10 or 25.

1168
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:40,960
So I think I can settle this.

1169
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:41,960
Yes.

1170
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:47,160
I believe that if you have under $10, you can cash out.

1171
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:51,640
I believe because I was at Starbucks because this is my fucking life now is like taste.

1172
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:55,560
So trying to figure out how to get foam and like like a real investigative journalist

1173
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:56,560
about foam.

1174
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:00,400
So a Starbucks I recently went to had a sign that said we can no longer cash out under

1175
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,440
$10 here, but we'll mail you a check.

1176
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:06,720
So Starbucks will mail you a fucking check for like 70 cents.

1177
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,520
So Starbucks is like a bank.

1178
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:09,520
Yes.

1179
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:14,240
So there is a way to get reimbursed, but there is a way to make putting money on your Starbucks

1180
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:19,280
card work for you, which is if you park it downtown Disney and you load 20 bucks on your

1181
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,680
Starbucks card, you can get your parking verified.

1182
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:22,680
Yes.

1183
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:23,680
I saw you put that.

1184
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,680
I like this.

1185
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:25,680
Validated.

1186
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:26,680
That's what I meant.

1187
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:27,680
You get a check mark?

1188
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:28,680
Listen, I haven't slept in about six weeks.

1189
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:34,640
That is a great tip.

1190
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,760
A great tip for sure.

1191
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:39,600
So that in that sense, I'm like, take my money.

1192
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:40,600
Yes.

1193
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:43,000
That makes a lot of sense to do that because obviously you're going to use that.

1194
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:47,280
I'm just saying that I do find it a bit manipulative in these apps.

1195
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:50,840
One thing to remember is it's a business that's trying to get your money.

1196
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:52,280
They're manipulating me.

1197
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:55,520
I am keeping that in mind and they're being bad.

1198
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:56,520
They're being mean to me.

1199
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:57,520
Five dollars at a time.

1200
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:00,840
I mean, you're going to use it eventually.

1201
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:02,520
Yes, that's what I'm saying.

1202
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:03,520
But I understand that.

1203
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:07,320
Which is a very God like mentality for them to have to be like, you come back.

1204
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:08,320
Yes.

1205
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:12,640
But they're like leaving a thing at your apartment on a date, essentially.

1206
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:13,640
You have to come back.

1207
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:14,640
You know, like.

1208
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:15,640
The old Carlson trick.

1209
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:16,640
It's a trick.

1210
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:17,640
Oh yeah.

1211
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:22,160
All the dates I've been on.

1212
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,240
So I don't care.

1213
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:25,240
I don't care for the practice is what I'm saying.

1214
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:26,880
And I think a president should make it illegal.

1215
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:31,600
But you could fucking pay two dollars in cash if you want to sing.

1216
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:34,120
I like to mobile or I like to mobile order.

1217
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:35,120
Yeah.

1218
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:37,000
And I wish you could just load what you're going to spend.

1219
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
That's all.

1220
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
No, I get that.

1221
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
That's all I'm saying.

1222
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
I'll take it up.

1223
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
I'll email them.

1224
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,760
Next time you're talking to Starbucks, I customizable.

1225
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:46,760
I've been emailing PR in unacceptable amount.

1226
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:47,760
Yeah.

1227
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:48,760
Just make sure you confirm.

1228
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:52,280
PR people blast journalists with press releases.

1229
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:53,960
I can turn about as fair play.

1230
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:54,960
Yes.

1231
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:57,160
And unfortunately, Starbucks only sent me one ever.

1232
00:43:57,160 --> 00:44:00,160
And I went back and was like, hi, it's very nice to hear from you.

1233
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:03,680
Here's every question I've ever had.

1234
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:05,680
Well next time throw in this one.

1235
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:08,120
Yeah, I'll bring it up.

1236
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:09,120
Sure.

1237
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:10,120
I'm just interested.

1238
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:11,120
I'm interested.

1239
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:13,520
So they do this with electric car charging too.

1240
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:17,880
But I guess that one there are different brands of electric car charging too as well.

1241
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:18,880
So that's a whole thing.

1242
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:19,880
That's another.

1243
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:21,880
That's another episode.

1244
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:25,280
So Starbucks West, we love it.

1245
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:29,240
We love to see it closed briefly when they were going to bulldoze that building and then

1246
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:31,800
it reopened dark six or so months.

1247
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:32,800
I got to tell you.

1248
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:33,800
Very strange.

1249
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:34,800
Six months.

1250
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:35,800
Very strange.

1251
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:39,800
That whole area closed June 2018 and then reopened December 2018.

1252
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:40,800
I looked it up last night.

1253
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,160
I'm not just like some genius and you have it in your head.

1254
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:46,800
We have like notes in front of you have the dates and you know it was 70 weeks.

1255
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:49,800
All I did last night was be like, wait, when did it close?

1256
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:54,560
Because this is so it's because it's part of the complex that includes the AMC theaters.

1257
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:57,400
Yeah, there's a weird energy there now.

1258
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:58,400
Oh yeah.

1259
00:44:58,400 --> 00:44:59,400
It's a weird little ghetto.

1260
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,680
It's like a bit of like a failing mall.

1261
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:02,680
Not that it's at all failing.

1262
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:06,560
It's just like that vibe where you're like, oh, there's a lot of stuff here that's closed.

1263
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:08,720
What does that mean for the future of this space?

1264
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:11,440
Well, you know what it feels like is Tomorrowland.

1265
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:16,120
Giant spaces not unused.

1266
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:21,480
It does feel like the kid who leaves the hometown and on the way out, it's like, all right,

1267
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:25,480
you know, buddies, I'm going to go to New York City and be a star and then immediately

1268
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:28,000
burns out in six months and comes back.

1269
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,400
Can I make sandwiches again?

1270
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:32,400
I'm sorry.

1271
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:38,120
So bummed that that hotel didn't go because it was so they felt like the monorail was

1272
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:40,360
going to have like a beautiful home again.

1273
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:43,280
It would be like a cool contemporary resort vibe.

1274
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:46,400
It would have brought like so much new to that area.

1275
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,000
You know, I think it would have been a little cramped.

1276
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:53,360
Oh, I'm always on the team of new.

1277
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:57,400
And so I would have just loved to see like another hotel.

1278
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:59,680
There would have been like there would have been a top floor bar.

1279
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:01,240
Oh, it's so cool.

1280
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:02,240
Yeah.

1281
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:03,240
Yeah.

1282
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:04,240
Somewhere a new place to watch the fire.

1283
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:07,120
Like a what's the California Grill?

1284
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:08,120
Yeah.

1285
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:10,560
Contemporary would have been that kind of vibe.

1286
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:15,880
Does that imply that you are you are not a fan of that of the downtown Disney monorail

1287
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:17,160
station?

1288
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:22,000
I am upset that they have been closing it like there's tighter hours now.

1289
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Oh, yes.

1290
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:27,240
Also, I find it to be much less efficient than the monorail at Disney World.

1291
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:29,640
I think they load it really inefficiently.

1292
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:32,120
It's really so you like you think it'll be faster.

1293
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:35,280
And sometimes it is because you skip some security line and gets you into the heart

1294
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:36,280
of the park.

1295
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:37,280
It's you want to go straight to Space Mountain.

1296
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:41,680
So the problem is that they when you're boarding a monorail at Walt Disney World, they have

1297
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:45,240
different aisles, like sections.

1298
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:47,920
So you can like walk to like section one, two, three, four, five, six or whatever.

1299
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:52,840
And it lines up with the doors so that people get out one side and then you go in for that

1300
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:55,720
specific car of the monorail.

1301
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:57,820
And this way they load it like a regular queue.

1302
00:46:57,820 --> 00:47:01,380
So they have you all line up and then they feed people around and then you just desperately

1303
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:02,380
try to find a seat.

1304
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:03,380
OK, right.

1305
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:04,380
So it's a little it's a little more scattered.

1306
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:05,380
It's a little it's it's a mess.

1307
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:06,380
It's harder to get out.

1308
00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:07,380
It's a little messy.

1309
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:08,380
Yeah.

1310
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:09,380
It still uses windows.

1311
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:10,380
There's no air conditioning.

1312
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:11,380
Yeah.

1313
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:12,380
In those cars.

1314
00:47:12,380 --> 00:47:13,380
That's right.

1315
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:14,380
Yeah, just a crack.

1316
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:15,380
It's never bothered me.

1317
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:16,380
I don't know.

1318
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:21,720
I mean, our temperate weather besides the heart of the summer, it's pretty mild out here.

1319
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:28,080
So do we do we have more on Starbucks or do we keep moving on to move on to next door

1320
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:29,080
to the other mountain?

1321
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:30,080
What's our time, Sitch?

1322
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:31,080
Oh, we're good.

1323
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:32,080
Forty five minutes or so.

1324
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:33,080
Yeah, should be plenty.

1325
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:34,080
That might be enough.

1326
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:37,080
To cover sugar, boo, boo and go.

1327
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:43,500
I don't think we'll ever have enough time to talk about what the fuck is going on at

1328
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:44,500
Sugar Boo.

1329
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:45,500
Yeah, that's right.

1330
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:47,600
We're on the same page here.

1331
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:50,180
What's going on here?

1332
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:54,520
Maybe I should let them speak before we get in.

1333
00:47:54,520 --> 00:48:01,400
Scott, go back to life now that the gift card arguments have ceased to sugar, boo sugar.

1334
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:05,640
You know, let me let me describe it how they describe it.

1335
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:09,800
Sugar Boo and Co is a family owned boutique featuring uplifting art prints and charming

1336
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:16,080
home goods to whimsical paper products, handmade ceramics, candles, bath apothecary and stamped

1337
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:17,600
jewelry.

1338
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:18,600
Stamp jewelry.

1339
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:19,600
A what?

1340
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:22,000
How would we describe it?

1341
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,840
It's like a bunch of burlap with words on it.

1342
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:26,840
Gentrification commodified.

1343
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:33,360
That's what I would call it, this store keeps telling me that Elizabeth Warren has plans.

1344
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:34,360
I know she has plans.

1345
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:35,360
I like her.

1346
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:36,360
I know she has plans.

1347
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:37,680
Okay, stop telling me.

1348
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:39,720
Stop saying plans.

1349
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:49,880
It is like it's almost like a millennial version of bless this mess.

1350
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:52,280
Like that's the whole vibe of it, right?

1351
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:56,880
Like that's it's folksy like shit you buy in the cracker barrel.

1352
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:59,480
It's elevated.

1353
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:05,040
It's like kind of this weird midway point between Chip and Joanna Gaines and like Catholicism.

1354
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:06,040
I don't know what it is.

1355
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:07,040
There's a vague religious.

1356
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:10,360
It's like we have burlap sacks and also dream big.

1357
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:13,800
Like it's a lot of like what is what is happening here?

1358
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:16,840
I've honestly never I you know, I'm a young woman.

1359
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:19,760
It's kind of they're trying to make me you're the demo.

1360
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:20,760
You're the audience.

1361
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:23,600
I've never walked in there and been like, oh, this is not for me more.

1362
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:26,280
I've never been in a store more like a luxury store.

1363
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:29,920
Not even like I walked in and was like, there is nothing in here I could feasibly put in

1364
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:30,920
my home.

1365
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:32,840
I'm not sure I've met a person who this is.

1366
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:36,800
I think it's for it's not for the New York, L.A. person.

1367
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:37,800
Yeah, yeah.

1368
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:41,960
I think it's for people who want their like who have like farmhouse inspired homes who

1369
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:45,200
want like very like positive uplifting things in their home.

1370
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:46,200
Right.

1371
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:47,200
Sure.

1372
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:52,760
So it's like a little touch of like if I could get, you know, like like I'm not an artist,

1373
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:57,280
but if I could get some inspiring words from an artist or a poet or an author and let that

1374
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:59,520
and inject that into my day to day.

1375
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:02,640
You've ever said the phrase breakfast nook, you would.

1376
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:03,640
Sure.

1377
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:09,280
Yeah, I have a bachelor's degree, but I didn't do most of the reading and it's all well behind

1378
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:10,280
me.

1379
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:14,200
But I still I still think of myself as educated.

1380
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:16,160
Now I will say I think they do a very good job.

1381
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:19,120
Like they have cultivated such a tight brand.

1382
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:20,120
Yes.

1383
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:23,040
Because everything in there, you're like, this is all so cohesive.

1384
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:24,040
Very much.

1385
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:25,040
They have done a great job.

1386
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:26,480
Yeah, it's all it's all on point.

1387
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:28,720
But holy shit, what is happening?

1388
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:29,720
What is going on?

1389
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:30,720
I cannot.

1390
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:31,720
I do not know.

1391
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:38,640
I feel like it falls into one of two categories, and that is platitudes, imagined platitudes

1392
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:44,320
and then quotes or song lyrics removed from any context or meaning.

1393
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:50,780
So this first one, first category, my whole heart for my whole life.

1394
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:52,280
And I do not understand that.

1395
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:53,280
I don't know.

1396
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:55,560
On a tile, it's on ceramics.

1397
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:59,760
And then the the second category, daydream believer.

1398
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:00,760
So that's it.

1399
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:01,760
We got to talk about this.

1400
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:09,120
Yeah, because what what are the rights implications about this entire store?

1401
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:10,120
Exactly.

1402
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:11,960
What I looked into it last night.

1403
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:13,920
This is what I did on my cool Saturday night.

1404
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:17,960
I was like, are like, are these things are available?

1405
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:19,360
Are they public domain?

1406
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:20,920
Are they paying artists?

1407
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:21,920
What is happening here?

1408
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:27,160
And a lot I felt like they quote Maya Angelou Angelou Angelou Angelou Angelou Angelou Angelou

1409
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:28,880
is not public domain.

1410
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:29,880
No.

1411
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:30,880
Right.

1412
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:33,200
So are they are they operating like in secrecy?

1413
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:37,120
Or is this like is it literally like a store that brings those Disney construction walls

1414
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:38,120
to life?

1415
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:39,120
Like what is happening?

1416
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:43,380
Because one lawsuit bring them down.

1417
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:44,380
You would think so.

1418
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:48,560
Like Daydream Believer, as I know it is a monkey song.

1419
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:51,240
This one doesn't say anything about the monkey.

1420
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:52,240
Some of them do.

1421
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:54,240
Some of them say the artist.

1422
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:55,240
Yes.

1423
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:56,240
Oh, yeah.

1424
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:57,240
Were you that the thing with the guitar?

1425
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:58,240
Are we going to get to that?

1426
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:59,240
I imagine you noticed that.

1427
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:00,240
I think.

1428
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:01,240
Well, I hope not.

1429
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:02,240
Maybe I didn't.

1430
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:03,240
Maybe I didn't see it.

1431
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:08,960
But like, I wonder if Daydream Believer is something that is found in other media or

1432
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:10,320
other writing.

1433
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:13,600
And you can throw Daydream Believer without attributing it to anyone.

1434
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:15,040
They must have such a good lawyer.

1435
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:20,040
Yeah, because then there's like there's John Lennon like song lyrics, there's Beatles song

1436
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:21,760
lyrics and it does say John Lennon.

1437
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:28,680
So I wonder if there's some loophole for inspirational saying pieces of burlap that you could hang.

1438
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:32,800
If you attribute it, can you sell like what?

1439
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:34,720
I couldn't figure out if anybody's a lawyer.

1440
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:35,720
Please let us know.

1441
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:39,840
Well, like quotes in newspapers or magazines, they reference quotes.

1442
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:42,440
They don't have to pay rights for that.

1443
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:44,240
I mean, that's different because that's media.

1444
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:49,640
It's not an 18 dollar burlap cosmetic bag.

1445
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:53,920
Yeah, it's very unclear.

1446
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:54,920
There's Bob Dylan.

1447
00:52:54,920 --> 00:53:01,400
There's a yeah, like and there's there's like a Bob Dylan lyric on some sort of notebook.

1448
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:02,400
Yes.

1449
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:05,560
And it's like, you know, we also got to discuss the product range here.

1450
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:11,920
The product I got the most egregious thing I saw was this massive like eight by 10 leather

1451
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:13,280
cover notebook.

1452
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:16,080
Like it's not there's the traveler notebook.

1453
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:18,320
Yeah, I think that's the same.

1454
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:19,320
This one has an E.B.

1455
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:21,080
White quote on it.

1456
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:22,600
He was a weird dude.

1457
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:24,920
And then inside there's like big piece of paper.

1458
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:27,480
This is forty five dollars.

1459
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:30,680
And the other thing about all these notebooks, they smell like shit.

1460
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:32,400
They smell awful.

1461
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:36,440
There was some tasteful little pocket ones and I was like, oh, that's kind of not what

1462
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:37,440
to call my guy.

1463
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:39,080
I can smell I didn't bend down.

1464
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:40,080
Just wafted.

1465
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:41,080
It just hit me.

1466
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:42,080
It's strange.

1467
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:45,560
Like it seems like the whole mood of the store is you doing a fourth grade project where

1468
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:49,160
you have to like use tea to dye the edges of a piece of paper to make it look like the

1469
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:50,160
Declaration of Independence.

1470
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,160
Like that's the entire mood.

1471
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:55,240
But also like the phrases are the phrases on notebooks.

1472
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:56,840
I'm at least like, OK, you can use this.

1473
00:53:56,840 --> 00:54:00,540
The phrases on paper weights and like nobody uses paper now, but sure.

1474
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:01,720
And then I don't know if you guys saw this.

1475
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:04,400
Did you see the small quote cutouts?

1476
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:09,240
It was like an index card sized and they're just inspirational quotes that you pay a dollar

1477
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:10,240
fifty for.

1478
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:12,120
I thought that was decoration.

1479
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:13,840
And then I realized they were product.

1480
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:19,640
Yeah, I thought like you obviously get this free if you buy a two fifty glass frosted

1481
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:21,240
bottle and they're like, no, no, no, no, no.

1482
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:22,720
You have to pay to put that in the bottle.

1483
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:23,720
What?

1484
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:24,720
Yeah, they're a dollar fifty.

1485
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:27,720
And because I was going to bring you guys funny quotes in a little bottle.

1486
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:31,080
And I was like, this is getting very expensive stuff.

1487
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:32,080
You guys do not want.

1488
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:33,080
Yeah, we'd like that one.

1489
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:34,080
Someone like, oh, no, yeah.

1490
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:41,200
And then they sell a stack of them in like a gold wallet clip, I guess.

1491
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:43,960
And it was 30 bucks.

1492
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:46,040
I thought about getting everyone.

1493
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:47,880
Hello, darling notepads.

1494
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:49,720
And then they were eight fifty.

1495
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:56,080
I was like, OK, so that would be twenty four to twenty five fifty.

1496
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:57,080
It's so much money.

1497
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:59,080
But it is also like mom catnip.

1498
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:00,080
Yes.

1499
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:05,880
I could see a 45 year old version of myself going in there and being like, ah, finally,

1500
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:06,880
you'll get it someday.

1501
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:07,880
Yeah.

1502
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:14,080
But I don't think any notebook purchased here has ever been filled or like anyone is like,

1503
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:19,080
well, the notes for my novel that I completed are in my sugar notebook.

1504
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:25,920
I mean, I am in all fairness, keeping notes during the ordeal in a large Moleskine notebook.

1505
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:28,880
But I like them because they take a beating well.

1506
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:34,440
Like I can throw them in and out of bags and they they don't get fucked up.

1507
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:39,080
Usually like for other stuff, I use like a twenty five cent spiral down or composition

1508
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:40,080
book or legal.

1509
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:42,280
We talked before we both like legal pads.

1510
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:43,280
Yeah.

1511
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:44,280
Yeah.

1512
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:45,280
I also OK.

1513
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:48,000
The mom is a good justification.

1514
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,460
That is potentially an audience.

1515
00:55:50,460 --> 00:55:58,640
But who is the audience for two big canvases that don't line up or match or blend seamlessly

1516
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:06,880
that use a lot of rock quotes to form a guitar and then a different then like the inside

1517
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:11,200
the guitar shape is brown text and outside is black.

1518
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:12,380
Can I tell you something?

1519
00:56:12,380 --> 00:56:13,380
I don't hate that.

1520
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:14,380
You don't hate this.

1521
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:15,380
Really?

1522
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:16,380
I didn't see it.

1523
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:17,380
That's all the quotes.

1524
00:56:17,380 --> 00:56:18,380
This is all.

1525
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:20,920
Well, let me just like give you a taste of the kind of thing that it is.

1526
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:21,920
Sure.

1527
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:23,600
Bob said, don't worry about a thing.

1528
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:25,800
Otis said, try a little tenderness.

1529
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:28,680
Steven said, dream on until your dreams come true.

1530
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:30,760
David said, we can be heroes.

1531
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:32,880
Kat said, baby, it's a wild world.

1532
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:35,820
I just read about two percent of this.

1533
00:56:35,820 --> 00:56:37,080
Your name jumped out at me.

1534
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:39,400
Carly said, these are the good old days.

1535
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:41,200
I assume Simon.

1536
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:42,200
I guess so.

1537
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:43,200
Yeah.

1538
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:44,760
Jerry Lee Lewis said, hop in the car.

1539
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:46,160
We're going for the state line.

1540
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:48,240
I don't care how old you are.

1541
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:57,480
Led Zeppelin said, hey, let's fuck those fish.

1542
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:58,480
I don't.

1543
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:02,400
So I was I was like kind of adrift at what the point of this place was.

1544
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:07,480
And then I spent too much time on their website and it ends up that they operate a small vacation

1545
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:09,040
home slash wedding facility.

1546
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:10,040
What?

1547
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:13,040
And it's called Sugar Boo Farms because of course.

1548
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:14,840
Oh, like a little like ranch.

1549
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:20,360
Yeah, like a little farmhouse and then little little white homes that are basically intended

1550
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:22,440
for guests to stay during a wedding.

1551
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:23,440
One's a bunk bed.

1552
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:24,440
The rest are beds.

1553
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:28,160
They're all like white farmhouse interior and they have that art in there.

1554
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:31,520
And originally I was like, I was like, oh, of course, this place is nice because they

1555
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:33,120
don't have the sugar boost stuff in it.

1556
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:35,320
And then I realized like, oh, it's all sugar boost stuff.

1557
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:40,700
So in the context of a farmhouse in the south, I think it works great.

1558
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:47,000
That farmhouse would have voted for Obama a third time if they could.

1559
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:51,400
I'm trying to find there's a there's there's a sign here that says come in evening or at

1560
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:54,000
morning come when expected or without warning.

1561
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:58,540
A thousand welcomes you'll find here before you and the oftener you come, the more will

1562
00:57:58,540 --> 00:57:59,540
adore you.

1563
00:57:59,540 --> 00:58:02,060
And I'm trying to figure out where that's from.

1564
00:58:02,060 --> 00:58:04,480
And I'm finding like different versions of it.

1565
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:06,400
Like I wonder if they changed it.

1566
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:07,400
So they did enough.

1567
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:08,400
Yeah.

1568
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:11,000
Doesn't it feel like I don't know, like secular worship, though?

1569
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:14,600
It's like it's all inspiring and vaguely religious, but not.

1570
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:15,600
Yes, for sure.

1571
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:18,960
I mean, it's for sure not trying to offend any religion, but it is trying to give you

1572
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:19,960
the feeling of it.

1573
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:23,480
And then it's also taking baby boomer rock and roll and making you feel like those are

1574
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:25,800
wise passages from the scripture.

1575
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:29,000
Well, if you guys are interested, I did make a game.

1576
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,840
Yes, of real versus fake quotes.

1577
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:35,440
I almost ran out of time.

1578
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:36,440
What a guest.

1579
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:40,120
So just, you know, I'll say I'm you guess if it's real or fake.

1580
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:41,120
All right.

1581
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:42,120
Sure.

1582
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:45,280
How in a wake heart is an open heart.

1583
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:46,280
So a right on point.

1584
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:49,520
It's like, I think it's right.

1585
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:51,000
I think it's fake.

1586
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,000
It's fake.

1587
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,000
Wow.

1588
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,000
All right.

1589
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,000
But a good, a good approximation.

1590
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Did you write the fake ones?

1591
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Yeah.

1592
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Damn.

1593
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,000
I mean, you could that you could start selling that.

1594
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:02,680
I will say that this whole I walked in there was a little depressed that like nothing I

1595
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:06,040
ever write will ever be printed on a pillow and sold for more money than I'd make for

1596
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:07,040
a story.

1597
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:08,040
But like, sure.

1598
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:13,240
We'll go to T public and anything can be printed on a pillow or a lead of every galaxy's

1599
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:14,240
story I wrote.

1600
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:15,240
OK.

1601
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:16,800
Courage, dear heart.

1602
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:17,800
That's real.

1603
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:18,800
We saw it.

1604
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:19,800
Yeah.

1605
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:22,320
Oh, be in love with your life.

1606
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:23,320
Fake.

1607
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:24,320
Fake.

1608
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:25,320
It's fake.

1609
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:26,320
It's real.

1610
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:27,320
Oh, you know what?

1611
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:28,320
Wow.

1612
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:30,320
I never thought of it that way.

1613
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:32,520
You mean I should enjoy my life.

1614
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:34,360
Hope is the thing with feathers.

1615
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:38,440
Who it's so I heard feels fake to me, but I feel like I saw it.

1616
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:39,720
I think it's real.

1617
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:40,720
It's real.

1618
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:41,920
Yeah.

1619
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:45,240
This love is our love.

1620
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:46,240
Fake.

1621
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:47,240
Fake.

1622
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:48,240
Real.

1623
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:49,240
It's fake.

1624
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:50,240
Wow.

1625
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:51,240
Wow.

1626
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:52,240
Kiss your life.

1627
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:53,240
That one's real.

1628
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:54,240
I think it's real.

1629
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:55,240
It's real.

1630
00:59:55,240 --> 00:59:56,240
Wow.

1631
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:57,240
Thank you for gracing.

1632
00:59:57,240 --> 00:59:58,240
Oh, real.

1633
00:59:58,240 --> 00:59:59,240
Fake.

1634
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:00,240
Real.

1635
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:01,240
Fake.

1636
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:02,240
It's real.

1637
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:03,240
Oh, yeah.

1638
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:04,240
Gracing.

1639
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:05,240
Pray your prayer.

1640
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:06,240
That's right in the middle.

1641
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:07,240
I'm sure you did.

1642
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:08,240
I think it's generic enough that it's fake.

1643
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:09,240
I think it's real.

1644
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:10,240
It's real.

1645
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:11,240
Yes.

1646
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:12,240
How?

1647
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:13,240
I'm really glad you didn't think of gracing, by the way.

1648
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:14,240
I'm thankful for that.

1649
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:15,240
Each day is a gift and we are all Christmas.

1650
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:16,240
I think that's too religious.

1651
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:17,240
Fake.

1652
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:18,240
It's fake.

1653
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:19,240
Yes.

1654
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:20,240
All right.

1655
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:21,240
All right.

1656
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:22,240
I think I have two more.

1657
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:23,240
I read these other ones.

1658
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:24,240
I think I have three more.

1659
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:25,240
I think I have four.

1660
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:26,240
I think I have five.

1661
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:27,240
I think I have six.

1662
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:28,240
I think I have seven.

1663
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:29,240
I think I have eight.

1664
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:30,240
I think I have nine.

1665
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:31,240
I think I have nine.

1666
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:32,240
I think I have eight.

1667
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:33,240
I think I have nine.

1668
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:34,240
I think I have nine.

1669
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:35,240
That's all of them.

1670
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:36,240
All right.

1671
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:37,240
All right.

1672
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:38,240
I think I have two more.

1673
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:39,240
I read these other ones.

1674
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:40,240
I believe in pink.

1675
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:41,240
That's real.

1676
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:42,240
Real.

1677
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:43,240
That is real.

1678
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:44,240
You complete me.

1679
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:45,240
I don't think they're selling it.

1680
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:46,240
Fake.

1681
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:47,240
Fake.

1682
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:48,240
It's fake.

1683
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:49,240
All right.

1684
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:50,240
All right.

1685
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:51,240
I think that's it.

1686
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:52,240
I just saw one...

1687
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:53,240
Cherry said, you complete me.

1688
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:54,240
It would've worked.

1689
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:56,240
If they sold an item to the thing, though, you'd be like, yeah.

1690
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:58,160
They should do this with movie quotes and then all the...

1691
01:00:58,160 --> 01:00:59,160
Oh, yeah.

1692
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:00,160
That's good.

1693
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:01,160
That's good.

1694
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:02,160
That's really good.

1695
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:03,160
That's how they get the LA market.

1696
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:08,960
We could have, if we got an investor like, much like the Rick Wetzel and his partner,

1697
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:15,080
Bob Bill Phelps, Bill Phelps, I forget, we could have a store like this full of merch

1698
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:16,840
by the end of next week.

1699
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:19,160
Jason said counterpoint, you were wrong.

1700
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:20,160
Great.

1701
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:21,160
What?

1702
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:23,320
I'm saying we could come up with all the products in a day.

1703
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:26,160
I'm imagining a tapestry that's all of our quotes.

1704
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:27,160
Oh, okay.

1705
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:28,160
That's good.

1706
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:30,440
I just like changing my socks in the log.

1707
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:35,520
Wait, you know that I was concerned that I had gotten too sleepy and said something

1708
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:38,400
and five seconds later, I'm like, did I speak right there?

1709
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:40,920
You're sure your donut crashing my donut crash.

1710
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:45,840
Oh, I forgot they have one that says faith trust and pixie dust, which feels like copyright

1711
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:47,400
infringement on Disney ground.

1712
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:50,240
I feel like they're selling that a block down, right?

1713
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:52,200
Like it was, I, I, you know what?

1714
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:55,080
I didn't see it in the store, but it was on the website.

1715
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:56,080
Okay.

1716
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:57,080
Oh, sneak.

1717
01:01:57,080 --> 01:02:05,040
I found one that I think now that I look at it, I think it's kind of giving away the con

1718
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:10,020
and because it says you are my sunshine, my only sunshine.

1719
01:02:10,020 --> 01:02:13,920
You make me happy when skies are gray and it goes all the way through the rest of the

1720
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:18,720
song lyrics and it's screen print it, but it's screen printed in a way to look like

1721
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:20,520
you were running out of ink.

1722
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:25,440
So it's like, oh, like, oh, this is the last one in the batch.

1723
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:27,960
And I feel like that's too perfect.

1724
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:34,080
Like that would be the thing that, that is where homes figures out like, ah, it's fake.

1725
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:35,080
It's a trick.

1726
01:02:35,080 --> 01:02:38,840
I do kind of like, I think they do a very good job of what they do.

1727
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:39,840
I want to say that.

1728
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:40,840
Sure.

1729
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:41,840
Yeah.

1730
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:42,840
You're killing you, but it's not for me.

1731
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:46,440
It's very, yeah, they're very effective.

1732
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:52,200
They also aren't, uh, it's still not appealing to me, even though they have that perfect

1733
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:55,760
category of this kind of place, the I like wine shit.

1734
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:56,760
Oh yeah.

1735
01:02:56,760 --> 01:02:58,080
You're an I like wine guy.

1736
01:02:58,080 --> 01:03:04,840
Well, I'm certainly not that I do like wine, but I'm not going to buy a thing that says

1737
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:10,160
where, you know, the, like the, the, the sack that does its own spin out.

1738
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:12,040
That's like, okay, I'm just having wine for breakfast.

1739
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:15,400
That's one of the, it's like, I'm having salad for dinner.

1740
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:16,400
Okay.

1741
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:17,400
It's mainly grapes.

1742
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:18,400
Okay.

1743
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:19,400
All grapes, uh, fermented grapes.

1744
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:20,600
I'm having wine for dinner.

1745
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:25,360
Or also if I ever go missing, I would like my photo put on wine bottles instead of milk

1746
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:26,360
cartons.

1747
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:28,920
This way my friends will know to look for me.

1748
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:30,960
God damn.

1749
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:31,960
That's upsetting.

1750
01:03:31,960 --> 01:03:32,960
A lot of levels.

1751
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:35,600
I like the mild darkness of it all.

1752
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:36,600
Yeah.

1753
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:37,600
Yeah.

1754
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:38,600
If I go missing.

1755
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:39,600
Yeah.

1756
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:44,680
Look, I drink a ton of wine and I may go missing someday and put it on wine bottles.

1757
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:49,600
So my other drunk friends can find me and reach out to wineries who I'm sure will be

1758
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:51,720
willing to change their brand.

1759
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:54,200
Wineries famously not studgy.

1760
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:58,000
Can they just put a picture of a missing person on for one batch?

1761
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:02,800
See that's how generational it is because nobody under 20 now knows what photos on milk

1762
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:03,800
cartons are true.

1763
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:04,800
That has been a, yeah.

1764
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:10,120
Now there's just like competing photos of cows being like, we swear they're not tortured.

1765
01:04:10,120 --> 01:04:15,840
You know, instead of issuing an Amber alert for me, put my photo on a bottle of wine,

1766
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:20,280
put my photo on seamless.

1767
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:23,960
They put my photo under M cafe's menu and seamless.

1768
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:27,240
You'll find me or postmates.

1769
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:34,920
They sell something that I like the look of and it's called Mr. Giggle pants, hibiscus

1770
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:37,240
sugar for it's for cocktails.

1771
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:42,500
Oh, and it's got an elephant in hot pants and the elephant has a cocktail.

1772
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:47,160
And I think it's for like maybe the rim of a glass if you're making a cocktail.

1773
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:50,400
And I think I will get this because I like the sugar.

1774
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:53,880
I like the idea of making a fancy cocktail with a little sugar obviously.

1775
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:57,240
And I really like this elephant wearing hot pants.

1776
01:04:57,240 --> 01:05:01,720
So for both things, I will say this is maybe my favorite product at Sugarboo.

1777
01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:03,120
You guys went into the store, right?

1778
01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:04,120
Yeah.

1779
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:09,000
Did a small part of you feel like if you moved to Nashville, you would buy every single thing

1780
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,000
in there?

1781
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:14,880
In Nashville, honestly, if I went back in time and moved home.

1782
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:16,920
Went home to Chicago.

1783
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:19,120
Well but the suburbs of Chicago, there's a lot of that.

1784
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:20,720
We're from similar places.

1785
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:21,720
Yeah.

1786
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:25,540
So like there were a lot of, I feel like I went to a lot of kids houses that had stuff

1787
01:05:25,540 --> 01:05:26,720
like that as a child.

1788
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:27,720
Oh really?

1789
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:28,720
I think.

1790
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:31,520
I don't think we were as enlightened on the North shore of Chicago.

1791
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:36,720
You didn't have the spirituality of the northwest suburbs of Chicago.

1792
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:40,000
I was very enriched with these quotes.

1793
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:44,960
So yeah, that's why I found, honestly, it did feel like houses I've been in.

1794
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:49,280
I feel like Barrington, like nicer houses in Barrington probably have a lot of these.

1795
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:50,280
Oh really?

1796
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:51,280
Yeah.

1797
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:54,280
All of our nice houses were people who designed their own house in the eighties and then still

1798
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:55,280
had it.

1799
01:05:55,280 --> 01:06:00,760
So it was like really nice, but it looked like a set of like a Wall Street movie.

1800
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:01,760
Oh.

1801
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:03,160
Cause everything was like glass.

1802
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:04,160
Right.

1803
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:06,160
Can you give me some addresses and can I move there?

1804
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:07,160
Oh yeah.

1805
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:08,160
Highland park.

1806
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:09,160
Just there.

1807
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:10,160
Sounds good to me.

1808
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:11,160
I'm not from Highland park.

1809
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:12,160
I'm from a lesser suburb.

1810
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:13,160
Okay.

1811
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:15,480
But the houses there were divine.

1812
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:18,320
Here's just a mug that says a little less conversation.

1813
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:19,640
XO Elvis.

1814
01:06:19,640 --> 01:06:22,600
Like he's kissing us.

1815
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:27,720
I gotta say, the more I look at this stuff, I want to be like, yeah, this sucks.

1816
01:06:27,720 --> 01:06:29,440
And then I really want to buy it.

1817
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:30,660
Like it's working.

1818
01:06:30,660 --> 01:06:32,600
It's working on my lady brain.

1819
01:06:32,600 --> 01:06:34,760
There's one that says to the moon and back.

1820
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:37,520
Yeah, that's a thing, right?

1821
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:39,520
That made me think of honeymoon.

1822
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:42,520
Yeah, that's it.

1823
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:43,520
Okay.

1824
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:46,440
I guess that's a turn of phrase.

1825
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:52,880
It's a real phrase, but I also thought of Ralph or his wife with violence on the honeymooners.

1826
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:55,200
I'm a million years old though.

1827
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:56,200
So no, no, you're right.

1828
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:57,200
That is a real quote.

1829
01:06:57,200 --> 01:06:59,160
I just thought of the weird.

1830
01:06:59,160 --> 01:07:03,360
Wait, I'm looking at something with a very similar quote to it.

1831
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:10,040
I hate this one, like a sack pillow with fucking typewriter on it.

1832
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:11,040
Oh yeah.

1833
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:12,040
Yeah.

1834
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:14,320
That says to my sweet darlings, do you?

1835
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:19,400
So this is a pillow for meant to be given to multiple children to my sweet darlings.

1836
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:23,880
Do you see how much you are loved all the way around the world forever?

1837
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:24,880
And a day.

1838
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:26,320
And then it keeps going and going.

1839
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:27,680
Oh my God always.

1840
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:29,680
And then I don't see who it's attributed to.

1841
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:31,680
We don't like this stuff because we don't have kids.

1842
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:32,680
Yeah.

1843
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:33,680
We'd be like, I love you.

1844
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:34,680
Like you dream big.

1845
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:35,680
Like you're everything.

1846
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:37,400
Like you would have inspirational phrases.

1847
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:43,080
I don't think I would give my kids a, a pillow with the script font on it.

1848
01:07:43,080 --> 01:07:47,640
It's like how like my grandma buys me like crocheted blankets and say granddaughter with

1849
01:07:47,640 --> 01:07:49,200
like a poem on them.

1850
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:50,200
Sure.

1851
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:51,200
It's because we don't have children.

1852
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:52,200
We like don't know love.

1853
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:56,200
Like we don't know the sugar boo level of familial love.

1854
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:59,320
What do you mean we don't have love?

1855
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:03,720
We have opinions about Starbucks apps and we know a lot about a water skier.

1856
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:04,720
Sammy Duvall.

1857
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:05,720
Sammy Duvall.

1858
01:08:05,720 --> 01:08:06,720
Sammy Duvall.

1859
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:07,720
The child prodigy.

1860
01:08:07,720 --> 01:08:13,040
We're all just like garbage big city people who have creative jobs.

1861
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:14,600
We like don't have children.

1862
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:15,840
We're like, what do you mean?

1863
01:08:15,840 --> 01:08:17,800
Like you have to be an accountant and you don't like it.

1864
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:21,400
And then you come home and you just want like to be uplifted and you have like family and

1865
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:22,400
you love your children.

1866
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:27,120
I just want to hug a pillow of, I like, now I'm picturing the person who has this pillow

1867
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:32,200
and does not have two children and just like cradles it imagining two children.

1868
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:36,040
It's probably like a beautiful pottery barn couch with a slip cover.

1869
01:08:36,040 --> 01:08:38,720
I think I don't like this store because it's everything I'll ever be.

1870
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:39,720
Oh no.

1871
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:40,720
Interesting.

1872
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:42,920
There's tons of psychology in this episode.

1873
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:45,680
Like a clean woman who can handle white furniture.

1874
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:47,680
That's never me.

1875
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:50,560
That's never me.

1876
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:52,520
This stuff cleans itself too.

1877
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:55,340
So much of it is so tan and kind of like dirty looking.

1878
01:08:55,340 --> 01:08:59,440
You could spill as much coffee as you want on these things and it would seem like purposeful

1879
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:00,440
staining.

1880
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:04,880
It's very much an aesthetic that has been in style for a while and it appears to be

1881
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:11,640
in style and still, um, I get though, again, this keeps coming out of like, well, if you're

1882
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:17,320
on vacation and you want to splurge on something, I am sure sometimes people I've done it where

1883
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:22,080
it's like, oh, what if I got something for the kitchen or I got like a poster or the

1884
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:24,200
home furnishing, something like that.

1885
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:27,160
So it makes sense in the district.

1886
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:28,160
Yeah.

1887
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:31,720
It gives you a little like, oh, when you look at it, it's the same reason why we buy all

1888
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:33,400
the garbage we buy, I guess.

1889
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:34,400
Yeah.

1890
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:35,400
Yes.

1891
01:09:35,400 --> 01:09:41,880
I think we are probably all being, uh, elitist in a way by, uh, trashing this.

1892
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:48,240
We're being elitist by trashing this place where, uh, burlap sacks cost $26.

1893
01:09:48,240 --> 01:09:51,440
Well, that's true.

1894
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:52,440
The price is right.

1895
01:09:52,440 --> 01:09:53,440
I, I, you're right.

1896
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:54,440
This is a bit expensive.

1897
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:56,800
I forget who the other author, but definitely EB.

1898
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:58,920
I mean, EB White did a lot of stuff.

1899
01:09:58,920 --> 01:10:02,440
I mean, he did the, the, the Strunk and White book.

1900
01:10:02,440 --> 01:10:04,320
And then is he Charlotte's Web?

1901
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:06,240
Uh, is he coming?

1902
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:10,600
Is that, no, that's when he's, no, I think it's EB White is one of those, I think British

1903
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:11,600
authors.

1904
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:16,080
So I'm like, I think if I scratch a little below the surface, I'm going to find some

1905
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:18,440
weird quotes about the British colonies.

1906
01:10:18,440 --> 01:10:21,240
I'm going to find some uncomfortable stuff.

1907
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:22,240
Sure.

1908
01:10:22,240 --> 01:10:24,320
Like the, who is he?

1909
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:25,520
Who's James and the giant peach?

1910
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:26,840
Is that EB White?

1911
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:28,920
Guys, I truly know nothing anymore.

1912
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:31,680
Since starting this job, I can't answer any of these questions.

1913
01:10:31,680 --> 01:10:32,680
That's a roll doll.

1914
01:10:32,680 --> 01:10:35,280
My entire brain is like fast pass policies.

1915
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:37,160
I am not even a full human anymore.

1916
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:38,160
Roll doll bread.

1917
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:41,000
So I'm starting to realize I can't like talk to other people as well.

1918
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
No, I can't talk to anybody.

1919
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:44,000
Yeah.

1920
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,000
Yeah.

1921
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,800
Only the people listening to this right now.

1922
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:48,800
You're all we have.

1923
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:51,280
Hey listeners to my sweet darlings.

1924
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:56,200
Do you know how much you are loved all the way around the world forever in a day?

1925
01:10:56,200 --> 01:11:01,000
Yours always for people with warped brains.

1926
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:05,560
And let us tell you that life is the most wonderful fairy tale.

1927
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:09,240
The second most wonderful it's podcasting.

1928
01:11:09,240 --> 01:11:16,320
Now, Carly, I'm going to say my bad on this one because when I initially sent you the

1929
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:21,240
list for this sector, I included the Lego store and I fucked up.

1930
01:11:21,240 --> 01:11:23,560
I was looking at an earlier list.

1931
01:11:23,560 --> 01:11:25,840
No, no, no, Jason.

1932
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:30,400
This is clearly my father because there's multi we've had multiple confusing documents

1933
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:34,560
based on that what the sector keepers, the center keeper like gave us tablets essentially

1934
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:46,720
like God Moses and they were crafted aged tablets in the Google Docs format, which I

1935
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:53,720
have a bad tendency to look at on the iOS platform, which cuts off the whole name of

1936
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:54,720
it.

1937
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:57,400
So you didn't know whether you were looking at downtown Disney or deal game plan or downtown

1938
01:11:57,400 --> 01:11:59,480
Disney or deal record one.

1939
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:00,960
I made too many documents.

1940
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:03,040
They didn't sort out right on your foot.

1941
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:05,040
This has been what an ordeal.

1942
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:10,360
This has been wiki leaks mess of what's even happening.

1943
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:11,520
Techno terror.

1944
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:14,840
I copy and paste sometimes other documents into app.

1945
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:19,560
Like I run all of my stuff through Apple notes so I can get it no matter what I grab when

1946
01:12:19,560 --> 01:12:20,560
I'm going out the door.

1947
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:23,160
We don't think you're crazy for doing this on our end.

1948
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:25,000
And then when you learn what goes into it.

1949
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,000
Oh my God.

1950
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:29,000
I mean, it's work.

1951
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,560
It's so much work.

1952
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:31,560
Yeah.

1953
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:32,560
Yeah.

1954
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:33,560
It's a nightmare.

1955
01:12:33,560 --> 01:12:37,280
I take my work very serious.

1956
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:42,640
I stress myself out about work because I want to do a good job and I want people to enjoy

1957
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:43,640
it.

1958
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:44,640
Oh, thank you.

1959
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:47,920
And just now the only way that could be more meaningful is if you printed it on burlap

1960
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:50,600
and you do a great job.

1961
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:57,280
I'll type in around the shape of a guitar or if Optimus Prime or who do you want to

1962
01:12:57,280 --> 01:12:58,280
say you did?

1963
01:12:58,280 --> 01:12:59,280
They did a good job.

1964
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:00,280
Every character and all the characters.

1965
01:13:00,280 --> 01:13:05,800
But yeah, I like an expert issue where Professor X tells Cyclops he's proud of him.

1966
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:07,520
And I texted Mike when I saw it.

1967
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:08,520
It's like you see that?

1968
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:11,480
And then Professor X told him Cyclops was proud.

1969
01:13:11,480 --> 01:13:12,480
Optimus Prime.

1970
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:13,480
I just went on.

1971
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:14,480
We were at Horror Nights.

1972
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:15,480
Oh yeah, we were there.

1973
01:13:15,480 --> 01:13:19,640
And then I went on Transformers just so I could get a little of that Optimus Prime praise

1974
01:13:19,640 --> 01:13:24,440
that I desire so much when you go, your bravery is what's helped save.

1975
01:13:24,440 --> 01:13:25,600
And I was like, yes.

1976
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:26,600
I've never seen those movies.

1977
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:28,160
So that ride still makes no sense to me.

1978
01:13:28,160 --> 01:13:29,480
I have only seen the first one, I think.

1979
01:13:29,480 --> 01:13:30,480
It's kind of our take.

1980
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:31,480
I have no idea what's going on.

1981
01:13:31,480 --> 01:13:32,480
But I really like it anyway.

1982
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:33,480
It was fun.

1983
01:13:33,480 --> 01:13:34,480
It was fun.

1984
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:35,480
We went to Moe's.

1985
01:13:35,480 --> 01:13:36,480
Did you do us?

1986
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:41,480
No, because remember I left and then you're like, you like really manned up.

1987
01:13:41,480 --> 01:13:42,480
Whoa.

1988
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:46,400
No, because I was like, I'm getting the hell out of here.

1989
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:47,400
Like I'm done.

1990
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:48,400
I did my mazes.

1991
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:49,400
We did a knots.

1992
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:50,400
Yeah.

1993
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:51,400
And you were like, I'm going to go for it.

1994
01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:54,480
There was not a chance I was going in the Us House.

1995
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:55,760
The Us House was scary.

1996
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:58,000
Oh my God, of course.

1997
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:01,120
But you did Clowns and you did Ghostbusters, right?

1998
01:14:01,120 --> 01:14:02,120
I was with you in Ghostbusters.

1999
01:14:02,120 --> 01:14:03,680
What are you talking about?

2000
01:14:03,680 --> 01:14:07,280
I know you were with me in Ghostbusters, but I meant really just to clarify that you were

2001
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:08,280
in Clowns.

2002
01:14:08,280 --> 01:14:09,280
You're like Halloween Horror Nights gaslighting me.

2003
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:11,520
I have done three different mazes.

2004
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:15,160
I'm just trying to recollect exactly the situation.

2005
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:16,160
Three haunts.

2006
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:17,160
Three haunts.

2007
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:18,160
I did Fright Fest.

2008
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:21,680
I've done, but the listeners heard about me talking about that already.

2009
01:14:21,680 --> 01:14:26,680
So anyway, yes, I know you were with me at Ghostbusters, but then you did Clowns, right?

2010
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:27,680
Yeah, I did Killer Clowns.

2011
01:14:27,680 --> 01:14:28,680
Separately.

2012
01:14:28,680 --> 01:14:29,680
Okay.

2013
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:30,680
The Killer Clowns.

2014
01:14:30,680 --> 01:14:31,680
Yeah, because you went for it.

2015
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:32,680
I did Killer Clowns and went home.

2016
01:14:32,680 --> 01:14:33,680
Yeah.

2017
01:14:33,680 --> 01:14:36,160
And yeah, anyway, I don't know how we started talking about this.

2018
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:37,160
Yeah, why?

2019
01:14:37,160 --> 01:14:38,160
Wait, you were saying.

2020
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:39,160
The leg.

2021
01:14:39,160 --> 01:14:43,600
I think we have to we were talking about doing the Lego store, but the Lego store might be

2022
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:46,360
saved for another stage.

2023
01:14:46,360 --> 01:14:50,520
But then you because we had told you that you got us something from the Lego store.

2024
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:51,880
I love to come bearing gifts.

2025
01:14:51,880 --> 01:14:52,880
Wow.

2026
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:53,880
Okay.

2027
01:14:53,880 --> 01:14:57,360
So we can take this into our future travels and perhaps even use.

2028
01:14:57,360 --> 01:14:58,360
Yes.

2029
01:14:58,360 --> 01:14:59,360
This is the first.

2030
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:00,360
Okay.

2031
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:04,640
So the Sector Keeper has been giving us items to use against the bosses we've been fighting.

2032
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:05,640
Okay.

2033
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:10,440
So we survived battles with Rick Wetzel.

2034
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:13,240
We had some trouble with Ralph Brennan, but we're okay now.

2035
01:15:13,240 --> 01:15:14,240
Oh, good.

2036
01:15:14,240 --> 01:15:15,960
We're facing, I feel like some big ones coming up.

2037
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:17,960
So we need all the help.

2038
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:21,480
Tertia Joe turned out to not be a boss, except he did.

2039
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:27,760
I did lose a battle to or my stomach lost a battle with Tertia Joe long ago.

2040
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:30,560
See, you get the trouble.

2041
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:34,440
Once in a while.

2042
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:35,440
But so I don't know.

2043
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:39,320
This might be the first instance of a guest giving us an item that potentially come in

2044
01:15:39,320 --> 01:15:40,320
handy later.

2045
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:41,840
I'm not even going to be in more sector keeper trouble.

2046
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:42,840
Am I?

2047
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:43,840
No, no, no.

2048
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:44,840
No, this doesn't overstep his.

2049
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:45,840
We can get items from anywhere.

2050
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:46,840
Okay.

2051
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:50,800
He's dealing with crippling nicotine addiction right now.

2052
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:54,400
Well, I was going to get you guys something from Sugarboo and then was cheap.

2053
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:55,400
So I didn't.

2054
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:56,400
Yes.

2055
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:57,400
Yeah.

2056
01:15:57,400 --> 01:15:58,400
But I did make many figures that look like you guys.

2057
01:15:58,400 --> 01:15:59,400
Oh my God.

2058
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:01,400
I will deliver each one individually.

2059
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:05,360
I just wanted to be known that I spent too much time in this store.

2060
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:11,440
And very embarrassingly was like a truly like a lost woman in the Lego store.

2061
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:13,120
And someone came up and was like, do you need help with anything?

2062
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:16,280
And I was like, no, I'm just looking for a small gift for an adult.

2063
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:17,760
And then she's like, I follow you on Instagram.

2064
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:23,000
I was like, oh my God, this is like the worst moment of my life that I'm just like truly

2065
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:27,280
overwhelmed in this store drinking a gigantic Starbucks, which like you need both hands

2066
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:28,280
to shop at Lego.

2067
01:16:28,280 --> 01:16:30,720
And I like didn't know what to do.

2068
01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:36,680
You were like a mirror mic, like stressed about fun and caffeine and toys.

2069
01:16:36,680 --> 01:16:37,680
My career.

2070
01:16:37,680 --> 01:16:38,680
Yes.

2071
01:16:38,680 --> 01:16:39,680
We were meant to meet you.

2072
01:16:39,680 --> 01:16:43,720
I had a similar experience where I was buying some t-shirts at Target, but they were cheaper

2073
01:16:43,720 --> 01:16:44,720
on the app.

2074
01:16:44,720 --> 01:16:47,560
And so I was getting them to price match at checkout.

2075
01:16:47,560 --> 01:16:51,080
And the guy went, are you Jason from podcast?

2076
01:16:51,080 --> 01:16:54,120
And I was like, yes.

2077
01:16:54,120 --> 01:16:55,440
Thank you for listening.

2078
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:56,760
It's so nice to meet you.

2079
01:16:56,760 --> 01:16:57,760
Oh my God.

2080
01:16:57,760 --> 01:16:59,920
I cannot believe I am.

2081
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:02,520
This is how we are meeting the context.

2082
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:03,520
We are meeting under.

2083
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:07,080
I will give you your tiny mini things in one second, but I will mention that a few months

2084
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:09,880
ago someone DMed me and they're like, Hey, I saw you at Magic Kingdom.

2085
01:17:09,880 --> 01:17:12,800
I wanted to say hi, but you were screaming at your mom.

2086
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:16,960
And now whenever I'm with her, she's like, don't yell at me.

2087
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:17,960
And I'm like, you're right.

2088
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:18,960
I can't.

2089
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:19,960
Yeah.

2090
01:17:19,960 --> 01:17:21,760
Someone could be watching facing the public.

2091
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:22,760
Okay.

2092
01:17:22,760 --> 01:17:23,760
This is tiny Scott.

2093
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:24,760
Oh my God.

2094
01:17:24,760 --> 01:17:26,960
I want you to know, I spent a lot of time in these bins with like other snotty children

2095
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:29,480
being like, give me that little food.

2096
01:17:29,480 --> 01:17:30,480
This is tiny you.

2097
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:31,680
I think it really encapsulates you.

2098
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:36,720
Um, I don't know why something, if you want to describe it or I have, well, okay.

2099
01:17:36,720 --> 01:17:39,520
I'm, I have, well it's the hair is accurate.

2100
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:47,040
It's kind of a swish and I, I'm holding a squishy and a pizza and I'm winking.

2101
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:50,080
I got some, uh, fun, like jovial vibe.

2102
01:17:50,080 --> 01:17:51,080
Oh, thanks.

2103
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:52,080
Yeah.

2104
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:53,080
Yeah.

2105
01:17:53,080 --> 01:17:55,840
Hey, I try to be a big smiler and the cool jeans.

2106
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:57,680
I thought that you'd be like, these are my going out jeans.

2107
01:17:57,680 --> 01:17:58,680
If you have going out jeans.

2108
01:17:58,680 --> 01:17:59,680
Oh, sure.

2109
01:17:59,680 --> 01:18:00,920
I mean, I think I'm, I think I'm wearing them.

2110
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:05,880
Sadly, they aren't super fancy, but, uh, I dig this guy very much.

2111
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:06,880
Yeah.

2112
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:07,880
It makes me hungry for pizza.

2113
01:18:07,880 --> 01:18:10,640
It's good toppings on these great food options, but I did my best.

2114
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:13,400
I well, I could be hiding wine in the squishy.

2115
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:17,000
I can, oh, it's tiny Jason.

2116
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:18,000
This is great.

2117
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:19,000
Oh, I like this guy.

2118
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:20,000
All right.

2119
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:21,000
Tiny Jason.

2120
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:24,960
Oh, tiny Jason has a nice sweater, a nice Argyle.

2121
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:25,960
That's nice.

2122
01:18:25,960 --> 01:18:26,960
Fall look.

2123
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:27,960
Very fall look.

2124
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:29,720
I do very well in fall.

2125
01:18:29,720 --> 01:18:31,720
I do for clothing wise.

2126
01:18:31,720 --> 01:18:34,560
You mean you look good in fall?

2127
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:39,400
I think Jackie Johnson once said like, Oh, winter fall and winter clothing suits you.

2128
01:18:39,400 --> 01:18:41,600
Like I, I, I sweaters and jeans.

2129
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:42,600
You do well with the layer.

2130
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:43,600
Oh, thanks.

2131
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:44,600
Yeah.

2132
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:45,600
I feel the same.

2133
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:49,160
I don't, I think I look dorkier in shorts and stuff than like fall.

2134
01:18:49,160 --> 01:18:50,160
Yeah.

2135
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:51,160
Yeah.

2136
01:18:51,160 --> 01:18:52,160
Coats and shorts.

2137
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:54,240
I've got a pretzel.

2138
01:18:54,240 --> 01:18:56,560
My accessories are a pretzel and a big popsicle.

2139
01:18:56,560 --> 01:19:00,520
Yeah, that's the closest I could get to a churro sundae.

2140
01:19:00,520 --> 01:19:01,840
That looks like a weapon.

2141
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:07,480
Sadly, they didn't have any churro accessories, but I love my radioactive popsicle.

2142
01:19:07,480 --> 01:19:08,480
Yeah.

2143
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:09,480
And then the last one.

2144
01:19:09,480 --> 01:19:12,680
Oh, you're coming over to me holding a mic.

2145
01:19:12,680 --> 01:19:14,160
Like he's about to do a standup set.

2146
01:19:14,160 --> 01:19:15,160
Yes.

2147
01:19:15,160 --> 01:19:17,160
I just didn't want you to.

2148
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:18,160
Whoa.

2149
01:19:18,160 --> 01:19:19,160
Oh my gosh.

2150
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:20,160
A boombox.

2151
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:21,160
So yeah.

2152
01:19:21,160 --> 01:19:23,720
So we ran out of food, but Mike likes music.

2153
01:19:23,720 --> 01:19:24,720
Mike is.

2154
01:19:24,720 --> 01:19:27,320
It's kind of, I wanted to give it like a party vibe.

2155
01:19:27,320 --> 01:19:29,240
You're wearing a baseball shirt.

2156
01:19:29,240 --> 01:19:32,560
I was wearing a baseball shirt when we were at Horror Nights.

2157
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:33,560
Yeah.

2158
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:34,560
Yes, this is great.

2159
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:35,560
Thank you.

2160
01:19:35,560 --> 01:19:36,560
What is this?

2161
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:37,560
That's a large ice cream cone.

2162
01:19:37,560 --> 01:19:39,320
Oh, I thought it was an Olympic torch of some kind.

2163
01:19:39,320 --> 01:19:42,960
Yeah, it feels a little, but I thought it would be like, you'd be like, come on good boys,

2164
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:44,320
like holding your ice cream cone.

2165
01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:46,560
You do get the big ice cream cones too.

2166
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:47,560
That's true.

2167
01:19:47,560 --> 01:19:49,600
I do get, I will sometimes get a double scoop.

2168
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:50,600
Big cone.

2169
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:51,600
Big pop.

2170
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:52,600
Yeah.

2171
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:53,600
Thank you so much.

2172
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:55,760
I should have gotten the ice cream, but it just felt like you would like the sweater

2173
01:19:55,760 --> 01:19:56,760
and the pretzel.

2174
01:19:56,760 --> 01:19:57,760
You're like, it's fall.

2175
01:19:57,760 --> 01:19:58,760
I want a carp.

2176
01:19:58,760 --> 01:19:59,760
Sure.

2177
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:00,760
Yeah.

2178
01:20:00,760 --> 01:20:01,760
No, no, no.

2179
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:02,760
Makes total sense.

2180
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:03,760
And I'm the least sweets person, so the pizza's great.

2181
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:04,760
Yeah.

2182
01:20:04,760 --> 01:20:05,760
I'm wearing shorts, which I was wearing.

2183
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:06,760
I've been wearing shorts a lot lately.

2184
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:07,760
So that's perfect.

2185
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:10,560
Yeah, you used to never wear shorts until you're in a shirt now.

2186
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:11,560
Really?

2187
01:20:11,560 --> 01:20:12,560
Yeah.

2188
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:13,560
What made the sweat?

2189
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:14,560
Global warming.

2190
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:15,560
Honestly, I don't.

2191
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:16,560
We're going to have to go back to Mike's childhood for the story.

2192
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:17,560
It's like it's in his shirt pocket.

2193
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:18,560
I love that.

2194
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:19,560
Oh, you're the ace.

2195
01:20:19,560 --> 01:20:20,560
My little guy.

2196
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:21,560
Yeah.

2197
01:20:21,560 --> 01:20:24,640
It's like, honey, I blew up the kid.

2198
01:20:24,640 --> 01:20:25,640
This is.

2199
01:20:25,640 --> 01:20:27,520
You're taking your toy on a little pocket ride.

2200
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:28,880
Here's what's going to have to happen now.

2201
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:33,600
I have put off, and I'm sure we'll talk about this in LEGO, I put off ever collecting LEGOs

2202
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:34,960
because as a child, I loved LEGOs.

2203
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:35,960
I loved toys.

2204
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:36,960
There's a ton of toys upstairs.

2205
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:41,640
And I've always, I walk into this place and go, oh, I should buy a Star Destroyer.

2206
01:20:41,640 --> 01:20:43,240
I should buy a...

2207
01:20:43,240 --> 01:20:45,960
And now I feel like he has to go on missions with...

2208
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:47,880
Oh, like he needs a home, a LEGO home.

2209
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:48,880
Yeah.

2210
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:53,360
He's on missions with the Marvel characters, Star Wars characters, and teasing the LEGO

2211
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:58,080
friends, the LEGO specific characters they created named the LEGO friends who have their

2212
01:20:58,080 --> 01:20:59,080
own TV shows.

2213
01:20:59,080 --> 01:21:00,080
Come on, gang.

2214
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:01,080
Oh, that's come...

2215
01:21:01,080 --> 01:21:02,080
Wait, are we meeting another group of friends?

2216
01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:05,000
There's another IP specific in...

2217
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:08,640
Pandora has their own set of characters they've created called the Pandora friends.

2218
01:21:08,640 --> 01:21:09,640
Of course.

2219
01:21:09,640 --> 01:21:12,320
And LEGO has their own group called the LEGO friends.

2220
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:13,880
I went to LEGOLAND.

2221
01:21:13,880 --> 01:21:14,880
Yes.

2222
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:15,880
You're first.

2223
01:21:15,880 --> 01:21:16,880
You're playing first.

2224
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:21,040
Hop in, friends, hop in LEGO Mike's LEGO Chevy Volt.

2225
01:21:21,040 --> 01:21:23,160
Let's go.

2226
01:21:23,160 --> 01:21:30,640
Let's plug this into a trailer at Six Flags Magic Mountain and let's go.

2227
01:21:30,640 --> 01:21:34,400
Well, oh my God, this is all fantastic.

2228
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:40,960
And we're going to be much lesser in this gift exchange because I, in the flurry of

2229
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:41,960
doing these many episodes...

2230
01:21:41,960 --> 01:21:42,960
Have some more doughnuts.

2231
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:49,200
I forgot the thing that we got you, which is a tiny card from Sugarboo with an elephant

2232
01:21:49,200 --> 01:21:51,200
and it says, hats off to you.

2233
01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:53,280
Hats off to me?

2234
01:21:53,280 --> 01:21:54,280
To you.

2235
01:21:54,280 --> 01:21:56,600
And so we'll just need your address.

2236
01:21:56,600 --> 01:21:57,600
We'll just send it.

2237
01:21:57,600 --> 01:22:00,600
We'll send the tiniest postcard in the mail.

2238
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:02,360
Hopefully it isn't irregularly sized.

2239
01:22:02,360 --> 01:22:04,480
It almost just shreds it.

2240
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:07,880
It oddly is going to need like seven stamps, even though it's extremely small.

2241
01:22:07,880 --> 01:22:10,080
Oh my God, can't wait to get future mail.

2242
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:12,320
Yeah, yeah, you got mail to look forward to.

2243
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:17,000
And because of this gift, honestly, I think we should all make you some sort of burlap

2244
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:18,320
with a quote on it.

2245
01:22:18,320 --> 01:22:19,320
We should all personalize a message.

2246
01:22:19,320 --> 01:22:21,520
Oh God, if anything I said was worthy of permanence.

2247
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:22,520
Yeah.

2248
01:22:22,520 --> 01:22:24,920
Oh yeah, we'll find a quote from the episode.

2249
01:22:24,920 --> 01:22:28,760
Hey, what did Carly say that you think deserves to be on burlap?

2250
01:22:28,760 --> 01:22:29,760
Let us know in the comments.

2251
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:34,800
I hope it's not just me being like, come on four.

2252
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:35,800
This is how you'll be remembered.

2253
01:22:35,800 --> 01:22:39,680
It wouldn't be on my gravestone if I were to die this week, that's for sure.

2254
01:22:39,680 --> 01:22:41,360
Thank you for our little totems.

2255
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:44,280
Well, maybe for our creature, our little self.

2256
01:22:44,280 --> 01:22:47,600
Yeah, you know, future battle, if you want to like use those in place of yourself.

2257
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:51,480
Yeah, like an extra, like a one up, like an extra life or something.

2258
01:22:51,480 --> 01:22:53,480
Well, it's like having little avatars.

2259
01:22:53,480 --> 01:22:54,480
Yeah.

2260
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:57,000
So to keep our own bodies safe.

2261
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,920
Oh, I think this will definitely come in handy.

2262
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:01,800
So thank you so much.

2263
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:06,360
I and now it's bizarre that we'll talk about the Lego store later, but I think it's perfect.

2264
01:23:06,360 --> 01:23:09,720
That we, you know, we talked about us.

2265
01:23:09,720 --> 01:23:10,720
We didn't talk about Legos.

2266
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:11,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2267
01:23:11,720 --> 01:23:12,720
You know what?

2268
01:23:12,720 --> 01:23:13,720
I think it all, I think it all divided up fine.

2269
01:23:13,720 --> 01:23:14,720
Thank you so much for these things.

2270
01:23:14,720 --> 01:23:16,920
Carly Weisel, you survived podcast the ride.

2271
01:23:16,920 --> 01:23:18,320
Does downtown Disney or deal?

2272
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:20,560
I let's access through the gift shop.

2273
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:21,560
Is there anything you'd like to plug?

2274
01:23:21,560 --> 01:23:22,960
Yeah, find me in the internet.

2275
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:26,320
I'm a freelance journalist, so I work for a bunch of different places and write a bunch

2276
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:27,320
of different stories.

2277
01:23:27,320 --> 01:23:34,440

Nobody has my name.

2284
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:50,400
There's lots of perks.

2285
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:52,400
You know, it'll be written, right?

2286
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:53,400
I don't need to spell it.

2287
01:23:53,400 --> 01:23:56,040
Yeah, it will be in the title of this.

2288
01:23:56,040 --> 01:23:57,040
So yeah, I just check.

2289
01:23:57,040 --> 01:24:00,360

We'd love to have you.

2291
01:24:01,580 --> 01:24:04,080
It sounds like the most delightful club.

2292
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:05,080
It's true.

2293
01:24:05,080 --> 01:24:06,080
It's just a bunch of it's.

2294
01:24:06,080 --> 01:24:07,400
So it started like a week ago.

2295
01:24:07,400 --> 01:24:08,960
It's all positivity.

2296
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:12,520
And I hope it stays because it's just it is so nice.

2297
01:24:12,520 --> 01:24:14,600
Like as a midwesterner, I'm sure you understand.

2298
01:24:14,600 --> 01:24:17,800
And like your your guys is crew is all like nice and happy.

2299
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:21,600
It's so nice to like people that came from our thing and like there's some Pugassar at

2300
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:22,600
Crossover.

2301
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:23,600
There's a few people, I think.

2302
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:24,600
Wow.

2303
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:25,600
You're saying our Facebook group.

2304
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:27,800
Yeah, because I'm in your Facebook group and everyone is so nice.

2305
01:24:27,800 --> 01:24:32,000
Yeah, I think we have the same thing like seeing such positivity.

2306
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:33,000
Yes.

2307
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:37,080
On there when so much Internet and especially Facebook can be like a very dark place to

2308
01:24:37,080 --> 01:24:39,840
define these nice dark Twitter.

2309
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:40,840
Debatably dark.

2310
01:24:40,840 --> 01:24:41,840
Yeah.

2311
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:42,840
Instagram.

2312
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:43,840
Pretty positive.

2313
01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:46,360
It's mostly you putting stuff out.

2314
01:24:46,360 --> 01:24:47,360
It's not you having a conversation.

2315
01:24:47,360 --> 01:24:48,360
Yeah.

2316
01:24:48,360 --> 01:24:52,160
So I mean, I was in my DMS all day, but it was one way conversations with people.

2317
01:24:52,160 --> 01:24:53,400
And I was like, you guys all like the same stuff.

2318
01:24:53,400 --> 01:24:54,400
You should be talking to each other.

2319
01:24:54,400 --> 01:25:02,160
Like I'm like dealing with an ungodly amount of people about foam and pressed powder and

2320
01:25:02,160 --> 01:25:03,840
like Disney Park specifics like that.

2321
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:05,200
You guys should all be talking about these things.

2322
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:06,200
Let's make some friends.

2323
01:25:06,200 --> 01:25:07,480
You're making connections.

2324
01:25:07,480 --> 01:25:08,480
This is some sugar boo.

2325
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:09,480
Ask positivity.

2326
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:10,480
You should make some matches.

2327
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:11,480
You should make some love connections.

2328
01:25:11,480 --> 01:25:12,480
Well, wait a minute.

2329
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:13,480
In your group.

2330
01:25:13,480 --> 01:25:14,480
You're right.

2331
01:25:14,480 --> 01:25:15,480
Matchmaker matchmaker.

2332
01:25:15,480 --> 01:25:16,480
Make me a match.

2333
01:25:16,480 --> 01:25:20,680
Right after I got married, I was like, oh, I'm going to set everybody up now and had

2334
01:25:20,680 --> 01:25:22,760
all my single friends like email me if they wanted in.

2335
01:25:22,760 --> 01:25:24,120
And then I never did anything with it.

2336
01:25:24,120 --> 01:25:25,120
So you got busy with foam.

2337
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:26,120
Yeah, you're right.

2338
01:25:26,120 --> 01:25:29,120
Oh my God, like a phone wedding, like a phone party.

2339
01:25:29,120 --> 01:25:30,120
Oh, wow.

2340
01:25:30,120 --> 01:25:31,120
Fall in love over the phone.

2341
01:25:31,120 --> 01:25:34,960
Is it called is the whole group chat called a phone party?

2342
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:36,200
It has some hold on.

2343
01:25:36,200 --> 01:25:37,920
It actually has a truly unhinged name.

2344
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:42,960
I just got a puppy like six weeks ago, so I have not functioned.

2345
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:44,640
So the name is let me see.

2346
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:47,000
It's Facebook dot com slash group slash Carly Weisel.

2347
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,860
But the actual name it's loading.

2348
01:25:49,860 --> 01:25:50,860
It's loading.

2349
01:25:50,860 --> 01:25:51,860
It'll be worth it.

2350
01:25:51,860 --> 01:25:52,860
God, I hope so.

2351
01:25:52,860 --> 01:25:53,860
You need to look it up.

2352
01:25:53,860 --> 01:25:57,600
Carly Weisel, cool time, Internet virtual hangout party.

2353
01:25:57,600 --> 01:26:01,200
Well, which I think sums it up.

2354
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:06,920
I just found an old floppy disk of mine that I saved like six second wave clips of songs

2355
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:08,720
and like the Simpsons on.

2356
01:26:08,720 --> 01:26:11,840
It was called the super ultimate kickass disk.

2357
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:13,060
I would buy that.

2358
01:26:13,060 --> 01:26:15,560
So this is this feels like very I think 12 year old me.

2359
01:26:15,560 --> 01:26:16,560
Yeah, it's the spirit of this.

2360
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:17,560
I was just like, it's fun coming out.

2361
01:26:17,560 --> 01:26:19,880
And it had like and then it would be you click on it.

2362
01:26:19,880 --> 01:26:21,240
It's like it's all caps.

2363
01:26:21,240 --> 01:26:22,840
Yeah, baby dot wave.

2364
01:26:22,840 --> 01:26:27,040
It's just a scratchy file of Austin Powers saying, yeah, baby.

2365
01:26:27,040 --> 01:26:29,160
And that took up an eighth of the disk.

2366
01:26:29,160 --> 01:26:31,160
I think I had a great I think I had a wave file.

2367
01:26:31,160 --> 01:26:33,080
I love Austin Powers saying, yeah, baby.

2368
01:26:33,080 --> 01:26:38,160
I think I had before you could take the movie home or I think I replaced the sounds on my

2369
01:26:38,160 --> 01:26:40,760
AOL with that was a move.

2370
01:26:40,760 --> 01:26:41,760
You're right.

2371
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:42,760
Like that.

2372
01:26:42,760 --> 01:26:43,760
Yes.

2373
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:45,760
So every instead of you've got mail, you would say, yeah, baby.

2374
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:48,560
Yeah, I honestly think that's exactly what I did.

2375
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:49,560
Wow.

2376
01:26:49,560 --> 01:26:50,560
That takes me back.

2377
01:26:50,560 --> 01:26:51,560
Yeah.

2378
01:26:51,560 --> 01:26:53,320

2381
01:26:59,280 --> 01:27:01,440
You'll never guess who they fired this week.

2382
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:04,360
You'll never guess what entertainment they've closed this week.

2383
01:27:04,360 --> 01:27:09,800
Or which executive went from sitting in the left chair to their new job in the right chair?

2384
01:27:09,800 --> 01:27:12,680
I'm going to save all comment for that for my sci fi column for this week.

2385
01:27:12,680 --> 01:27:13,680
All right.

2386
01:27:13,680 --> 01:27:15,280
