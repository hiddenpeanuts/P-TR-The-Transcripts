1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,640
Warning, the following podcast involves a horrible football team owner.

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:13,360
The episode was recorded weeks ago before the horrible owner reluctantly agreed to change

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,960
his team's horrible name.

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,800
But that doesn't make him any less horrible.

7
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:22,560
Besides all that, get ready for an amusing discussion of the Six Flags Dancing Old Man,

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,600
Mr. Six, on Podcast The Ride.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:47,600
Podcast The Ride is coming.

10
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,280
I am your host, Scott Gardner.

11
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,920
I'm joined by Michael Carlson and also Jason Sheridan.

12
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,760
Mr. Six is the topic.

13
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,520
He's the old man from Six Flags.

14
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,880
The whole app will be like this for over 90 minutes.

15
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:04,720
Hey now, hey now, welcome to Podcast The Ride.

16
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:10,800
I mean, I've lost the momentum already, but just, you know, ask for the music if you guys

17
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,560
want to make any points, you know, set to that, to that intonation.

18
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,840
I was going to say, we like, we like to kill time.

19
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,520
We like, we like to kill time.

20
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,200
That was going to be my addition.

21
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,200
We like to podcast.

22
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,160
We like to podcast.

23
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,160
We like to podcast.

24
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,160
We like to podcast.

25
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,160
Yeah.

26
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,160
We can do, we can do the whole thing.

27
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,160
Certainly.

28
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:39,200
I'm happy to do the entire song in homage to, for the good boys, homage to the Venga

29
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,680
Boys, which is what this whole episode will be.

30
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,680
We're talking Mr. Six.

31
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,680
And as I said, in case you didn't know, that is the old man from Six Flags.

32
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:52,280
I think you could just as well call this episode the old man from Six Flags.

33
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:57,080
But ever since I learned that he had a name, it's impossible to not use it.

34
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,080
Mr. Six.

35
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,080
Mr. Six.

36
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:02,960
Yeah, I don't think I knew he was Mr. Six until recently.

37
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,600
That's new information, relatively new information to my brain.

38
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:11,920
I think I knew about it, but I forgot about his, his friend.

39
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,920
We'll get to his friend later.

40
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,200
We don't want to start with his little friend.

41
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,040
Yeah, that's, that comes later.

42
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,880
That comes much later.

43
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,640
After at least one villain, if not more villains.

44
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,640
I'm OK.

45
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:30,240
Yes, I've also stumbled upon the villains and I have some thoughts about the villains.

46
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:35,160
It's crazy whether it's like, yeah, it's a world, a villain in the world of theme park

47
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:39,360
comings and goings, who also happens to be one of the worst men in America.

48
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,880
Yeah, yeah.

49
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,280
And maybe more than one.

50
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,680
I don't know if we looked at the same thing.

51
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,040
I kind of kept going down this particular rabbit hole.

52
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,040
It's it's it's pretty crazy.

53
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:56,480
And I it's all I don't want to give away my personal thesis to this episode.

54
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,360
But I I'll just say, how do I preview it?

55
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,760
That I think it's I think you're in dangerous territory if you oppose Mr.

56
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,080
Six, I think the anti Mr.

57
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,120
Six side has some very unsavory characters.

58
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,680
And I'm not sure that that's where I want to be.

59
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,800
Yeah, I mean, I will go ahead and say I love Mr.

60
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:22,360
Six, and I think I'll even go so far as to say, I think that he gave us permission

61
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:30,960
to have fun again, to set our clocks to play time after the combination of 9-11 and the Iraq.

62
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,360
Jason, would you say that Mr.

63
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,400
Six allowed you to be weird?

64
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,080
Yes, Mr. Six allowed me to be weird.

65
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,560
I thought you'd be weird.

66
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,840
Yeah, I thought me to be weird.

67
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,760
Mm hmm. Which is something you can say, were he ever to die,

68
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,920
which is obviously a concern because he's very old.

69
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,120
And it's less of a concern because he's fictional.

70
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,280
However, as Mr.

71
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,480
Peanut taught us, fictional misters can die.

72
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,120
So we got to be afraid of anybody.

73
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:04,200
But if you know, you just have that ready to eulogize him with were he ever

74
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,120
God forbid to pass away. Right.

75
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,560
Now, should we all say, do we do we like it?

76
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,440
Should we all proclaim our feelings?

77
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:17,160
Like I I'm a little mixed on him, to be fair, to be frank, I should say.

78
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,680
I let you be frank.

79
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,800
Let me let me be frank for once on the show.

80
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,640
I I don't know that I loved Mr.

81
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,800
Six when I would see the commercials.

82
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,080
I was a little off put by him, to be honest.

83
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,520
I'm relieved to hear you say this, because this this was my opinion.

84
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,560
But but I'll just as a preview, I think my opinions evolved a little bit.

85
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:45,720
I was certainly heading into this thinking, is this going to be yet another scenario

86
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,200
where I'm against the ropes and I didn't really like the thing?

87
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:54,480
But I'm not even sure I'd say I am or was vehemently opposed.

88
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:58,040
But I think I'd be dishonest if I said at the first time I saw

89
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:03,360
this dancing old man to the Venga Boys song that I that my response was good.

90
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,160
Yes, I like this.

91
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:10,200
I can't I can't say that's honestly what happened in 2004 or so.

92
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,200
Yeah, I don't think it was an active thing.

93
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:15,040
I don't think I threw something at the television when he'd appear.

94
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,440
I just think I was more like, oh, OK, huh.

95
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:24,040
All right. And yeah, so I think I like him more now.

96
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,920
But I think at the time I was he was not high on my list.

97
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,760
And I discovered real quick, I don't know if anyone else watched this

98
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:37,760
an interview with the SVP of marketing at Six Flags, Angelina Vera Baracus.

99
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:41,600
And she said and she has a smile on her face while talking about Mr.

100
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,520
Six, because I'm going to paraphrase here.

101
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,120
She said some people really like Mr.

102
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:50,000
Six and some people don't like him as much.

103
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,560
And that's both good for us.

104
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,600
That's a mark of a character that has people talking.

105
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:02,000
Yeah, it's it's the old no bad press, you know, they're at least they're talking about.

106
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,840
Yeah, right.

107
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:09,400
So I think that it sounds like we all were playing right into the hands of marketing.

108
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:12,040
Some loved him. Some didn't love him.

109
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,160
I thought it was weird.

110
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,040
I think that was the reaction they probably most people probably had

111
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,640
and they thought most people would have.

112
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,520
It's like, oh, it's kind of weird.

113
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,600
What's up? But then you yeah, you are asking questions.

114
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:29,360
You're looking into it or, you know, I think I think that I can't deny

115
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,440
that I thought it was weird.

116
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,080
But I think I think I thought it was weird and kind of like a

117
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:41,240
like an underground comedy movie way, you know, or like like an all that way.

118
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,160
It was like something that would have been on all that.

119
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,160
Like, is it I think I was like,

120
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,760
it's definitely it's only odd and kind of grotesque, which is interesting.

121
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:53,440
That's the word I just had pop into my head to grotesque is the word.

122
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,440
I don't know. Is it just because it's like the makeup is weird?

123
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,400
I'm you know, after baby Aladar gate,

124
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,840
I'm relieved to be on the same page with you again, Mike,

125
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,760
to not be like off on an island by myself.

126
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,320
Well, this is how I look.

127
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:11,160
I maintain my credibility here that I'm not just trolling you about baby Aladar,

128
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:15,920
the baby dinosaur from the Disney movie dinosaur that no one likes is cute.

129
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:16,720
He is cute.

130
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,200
So that over explanation made me

131
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,280
question it again. Yes, I was just trying to in case a listener

132
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,480
was just tuning in for the first time.

133
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,480
I just wanted to make sure they were caught up.

134
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,400
Let's do some cliff notes.

135
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,000
Well, you know what I think?

136
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,760
Yeah, I don't think you are trolling me on that.

137
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:36,120
And we, you know, we did the the girlfriend test.

138
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,880
You asked Lindsey if she thought baby Aladar was cute and she said yes.

139
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,440
So they're like the people weren't part of the argument taking place.

140
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,200
But now I don't know what to think, because when that test happened,

141
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,000
I asked my wife, Erin, do you think baby Aladar is cute?

142
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,400
She said absolutely not.

143
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,800
So, OK, we're on the same page.

144
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,640
I asked her about Mr. Six loves Mr. Six.

145
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,800
Really? Yeah.

146
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:00,480
It's kind of against the mold that this this thing has been.

147
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:04,240
And, you know, and I'll say she's always she's a big influence on me taste wise.

148
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,600
And that was one of the first things that made me think,

149
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:10,160
do I need to give Mr. Six a second chance if my if my beloved wife,

150
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,000
Erin, with very good taste, likes him?

151
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,720
Maybe I got to think about this a little harder.

152
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,840
Well, let me ask, let me text Lindsey and see what she thinks about Mr. Six.

153
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,320
I did not ask her before this.

154
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,280
That's a good question. And elsewhere in pursuing opinions,

155
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:27,680
Jason, can I ask you if your opinion ever changed or evolved?

156
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:32,160
Or have you just been full tilt six stand since 2004?

157
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:36,760
I don't think I stand him that hard in his heyday.

158
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,280
But like now, I think he's great.

159
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:45,720
Now, I think more than ever, especially as like places start to open back up.

160
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:51,120
Now more than ever, I think the Six Flags, like the Six Flags brand needs Mr. Six.

161
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,960
Well, that's how they felt

162
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:58,240
whenever they brought him back the first time, which is maybe 2010, I think.

163
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:05,240
OK. Well, they brought him back kind of to distract from they made it a racism.

164
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:09,520
Oopsie. Yeah, I didn't see this.

165
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,200
Did you guys not see this? No.

166
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,800
OK, well, so we're jumping around to the timeline a bunch.

167
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:21,480
So we'll get to Mr. Six's first retirement

168
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,360
somewhere down the line.

169
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:29,400
They changed the tag lines they were going with to more flags, more fun.

170
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:34,120
And the person they had saying were flags, more fun,

171
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,960
and it was just the disembodied head of a yelling Asian man.

172
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,600
What? Yeah, I saw this. Yeah.

173
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,480
I'm sorry. I do remember those ads. Yeah.

174
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,240
And people were not.

175
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,520
We were like, what are you?

176
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,720
What's going on, guys?

177
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,040
What are you doing? What's this?

178
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:55,840
And they're like, oh, never mind.

179
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,680
Who said that? Mr. Six said it.

180
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,400
And then it was like, oh, hey, Mr. Six is back and he's talking now.

181
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:08,000
And then they brought him back in a very similar way where he's like

182
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,400
in a in a little shape.

183
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:14,080
He pops up in his head was disembodied as well.

184
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,280
Yes. Yeah.

185
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:19,480
They they had to use that after effects element.

186
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,840
So they put Mr. Six's head in there.

187
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,680
Hmm. Hmm.

188
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:28,080
So you're saying that the voice that was used, if I kind of recall the ads,

189
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:32,600
maybe the voice was a little questionable. Yeah. Yeah. Sure.

190
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,560
So suddenly,

191
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,600
somebody who was very divisive, then they do something much more divisive.

192
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:46,640
And now Mr. Six seems like safe ground, like very safe footing.

193
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:50,680
I've got an update on Lindsey's feelings about Mr. Six.

194
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:55,040
I said, I said, do you like Mr. Six, the old man, Six Flags mascot?

195
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:59,120
I sent a photo and she wrote in all caps, no, I hate him.

196
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:03,560
Boy, just flopping with Aaron on this issue.

197
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,000
Yeah. I huh. Interesting.

198
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,760
I don't think I I don't think I quite understand.

199
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:12,600
The I ask, I'm going to ask Jane and see what she says.

200
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:16,600
Yeah. Yeah. If it's a full reverse,

201
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,720
except it wouldn't be a total reverse because Jason, you really like Mr.

202
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,080
Six and you really like baby Aladar.

203
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:26,040
Yes. And she like she was pro Aladar.

204
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,480
I'm Aladar. Yes.

205
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,000
Yeah. So that what's not yet.

206
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,160
It's not a perfect mirror yet.

207
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,040
That's not I mean, it can't can't be, I guess.

208
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:37,880
Yeah, this one. You know, I think any election night of any kind

209
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:42,120
for the rest of time is going to be very stressful and not like kind of a fun

210
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,160
TV night of viewing anymore.

211
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,840
So I think we need things like this, like our personal electoral map

212
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,960
about issues like Mr. Six and baby Aladar.

213
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,520
Now we're waiting on the results from the Jane District.

214
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,480
Could be any minute now. It could swing this entire thing.

215
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,720
The world waits.

216
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,240
Yeah. So I think he's I bet

217
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,960
that he is more disliked than liked.

218
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,440
And I don't know if it's strong.

219
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:13,600
I don't know if it's people saying hate, but I would bet people go,

220
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,120
I don't know. And I don't think so. Not for me.

221
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,480
Mm hmm. Yes.

222
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,880
You think like parents probably don't like them.

223
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:24,080
I'm sure. Well, parents don't like him because he likes to have fun.

224
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,320
So I think that's another strike against them.

225
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:31,480
Parents want you to study and they want you to do your do your chores.

226
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:35,960
And this guy gets the drives a bus up to your house and tells you to get in.

227
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,400
That's one thing about it.

228
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,000
In his first appearance, he is

229
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:45,280
an old man stranger who pulls a bus up

230
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:48,120
outside your house and says, get in right now.

231
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,600
We're going to the roller coaster place.

232
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:55,120
And he doesn't and he doesn't talk right in that first ad.

233
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,760
He doesn't talk for a while.

234
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,120
He doesn't talk in all of like the first ads,

235
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:04,360
I think until he says more flags, more fun.

236
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,440
Right, right.

237
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,680
She says no.

238
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:12,880
And one of the reasons given is because he only has one outfit in his closet.

239
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,320
Whoa. That's oddly, oddly specific.

240
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,920
Does she? Well, because she hates Steve Jobs.

241
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,760
No. Well, because there's no there's a commercial.

242
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,880
There's like the Mr. Six Returns commercial.

243
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:29,160
He gets out of bed at a retirement community and he opens his closet.

244
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,480
And the only thing in there is the single tuxedo with the red bow tie.

245
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,360
Is it only one item or is it 20 of the same item?

246
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:41,040
No, it's just one. It's just one hanging suit.

247
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,640
So she hates him because he's poor and only can afford.

248
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,960
No, I think because that's weird.

249
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,800
Well, the other.

250
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,360
Can I read this? Can I read what you wrote?

251
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:56,240
OK, the real the main reason she says is she says,

252
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:00,960
no, I she does not like him because she knows that

253
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,320
under the makeup is just a well-dancing fuckboy.

254
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,200
I can see why you asked.

255
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:14,960
Not not the specific guy, just that I think she knows a lot of that type,

256
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,560
a lot of that sort of professional dancer type.

257
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:23,440
Oh, so she sensed like dancer desperation

258
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,360
and like the overdone way a dancer.

259
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,440
I know what you mean.

260
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,160
Like, you know what?

261
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,440
He I guess he has some of the energy of when

262
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,160
I mean, I guess anything else where there's like a fake old man

263
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:40,400
and then he's like struggling to walk, but then he busts break dance moves.

264
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,800
Like you can tell even when he's a fake old man, something's up.

265
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,920
Right. Yeah, yeah, I get I get that.

266
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,200
And then if you're seeing, I think that is part of the unnerving,

267
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:56,520
grotesque thing about it, too, is that it just visually it doesn't.

268
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,760
Your brain knows something's wrong.

269
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:04,120
Yes, exactly. I think you're one to like they know this is not a real old man,

270
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:07,280
obviously. But what is under it?

271
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:11,280
There's something so strange about that face and mask.

272
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:14,520
And you're you're like, is it is it a woman?

273
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,800
Is it a child?

274
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,360
I like you. I pretty unclear.

275
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,600
I think there was a rumor about it being a celebrity.

276
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,560
Do you guys know who I was?

277
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,080
It's not coming to me.

278
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,440
Hmm. I don't think I saw this.

279
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,760
There was some false rumor.

280
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:36,520
I want to say that Amy Poehler played him in an SNL sketch at one point in time.

281
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:39,600
In a Donald Trump hosted episode of SNL.

282
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,240
Oh, yes. No.

283
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,160
There is an apprentice sketch.

284
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,720
Oh, no.

285
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,520
Who do people think? I'll try to figure that out.

286
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:51,280
But right. I think that is some of the initial creepiness people have.

287
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:54,440
Like something is under there. But what?

288
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:59,720
Yeah. Yeah. Is it like a creature of some kind that's pretending to be a human?

289
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:03,960
Well, I bear a dancing bear.

290
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:08,040
I watched a lot like a collection of a bunch of the commercials,

291
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:13,600
and a lot of them share the themes of that same that first one,

292
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,160
you know, where it's like he pulls into a boring suburban street and he gets out

293
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:20,200
and he dances and then everyone else starts to dance.

294
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:25,280
But my favorite one was where like they do a scream parody

295
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:28,560
where a woman answers the phone like scared.

296
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,960
And then the the music starts playing through the phone.

297
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:35,480
And then he like burst in through the door.

298
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:40,680
And then they drive to a dark six flags like it's the whole commercials at night.

299
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,720
And they get chased by ghouls and goblins.

300
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,440
But then he dances with the ghouls and goblins.

301
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,280
And that's fun.

302
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:50,240
It all happens in 30 seconds time. Yeah.

303
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,640
Here, I think I have it up.

304
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,920
Mr. Six at Fright Fest is fun.

305
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:58,440
I do think that's maybe my favorite of all of these.

306
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:03,040
Oh, no, I'll go ahead and say this and pass the torch to you guys.

307
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:07,120
If you I'm a little light in my research of specific ads.

308
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,280
So so have at it.

309
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,160
If you know more about ads, take take lead.

310
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:17,080
Well, the the original ads, there were a few of them.

311
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:19,680
And as we were saying, he doesn't talk.

312
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:23,960
The first one is that he's like in an assisted living facility, essentially.

313
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,440
Anyway, Jason, am I right about this?

314
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,360
That's the first one. That's no, no.

315
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:33,040
The first one is like the minute and 30 second short film with a narrator.

316
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,680
You're right. That's right. Somebody.

317
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,080
So what do you do?

318
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,560
What's the gist of what the narrator says?

319
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,600
It's kind of like a Dr.

320
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:44,720
Susie in until one day a mysterious man arrived. Right.

321
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,800
Yes. Yeah. To like shake them out of it.

322
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,040
And I had forgotten.

323
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:53,920
And like when he gets off that bus in that first commercial,

324
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:58,280
he's like creaking and he's like moving really slow.

325
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,760
And and you're like, oh, what is this?

326
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:03,160
And then he breaks out the dancing.

327
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:06,440
That's what I'm saying. That part is weird off the bat.

328
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,400
You know, it's not an old man.

329
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,040
It's it's similar to stuntman acting.

330
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,240
When stuntmen have to do things that aren't the stunt, it's very over.

331
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:17,520
Even if it's just like walking across the street or pointed something and saying,

332
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,640
what's that? It's always not good.

333
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,320
He's doing sort of a Willy Wonka thing to a fake.

334
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:26,240
It's a fake out also. Yes.

335
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,080
Where you think maybe he's in worse shape than he really is.

336
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:33,200
I guess it's also like Johnny Knoxville's bad grandpa.

337
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:40,240
Mm hmm. Yes, I think that I think bad grandpa makeup is better

338
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,320
but later too.

339
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,760
So maybe it was more more advanced technology had come a long way.

340
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,480
Yeah. You know, it's really crazy in my

341
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,760
and I'll move off this as fast as possible.

342
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:58,080
But I actually watched an orbit for the first time all the way through.

343
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,960
And have you seen an orbit?

344
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,200
I have not. Can't say I have.

345
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,400
It's one of the things that makes it a rough watch is that Eddie Murphy plays

346
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,440
many parts and among them, he plays an old Chinese man.

347
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,640
And yeah, that's not good.

348
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:19,960
However, the literal the the literal makeup is unbelievable.

349
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:23,480
It might be the best makeup in the history of film,

350
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,840
which is what I think.

351
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,720
And it was nominated for an Oscar bizarrely.

352
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,280
I mean, all the makeup is great.

353
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:33,960
And it's Rick Baker who's done the Grinch and the thousand things we've talked about.

354
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:39,120
And it's just unfortunate that it's in this area, which is so not good.

355
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,600
I just if you're if you're just interested in literal prosthetics,

356
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,800
Norbert is is pretty amazing.

357
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,560
But I, you know, let me put as many warnings on top of that as I can.

358
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,520
You've qualified it, I think enough.

359
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,840
A lot less. Please let me.

360
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,800
I don't have time in a 90 minute episode to do all the qualifying.

361
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,040
Mm hmm. Well, we'll add it in the show notes, I guess, too.

362
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,840
Perfect. Yes. All right.

363
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,560
So the first those first series of commercials are the it's playtime commercials.

364
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,240
Yes. Yes. It's playtime.

365
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:12,600
He gave us permission to play again.

366
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,960
After our national trauma.

367
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,800
I believe the second commercial is what I was referring to as

368
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:23,160
where he's in the assisted living facility and he gets he gets

369
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,720
like awakened by a nurse.

370
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,760
And then we see his single suit.

371
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,520
Yeah. Is that it?

372
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,240
It's playtime one.

373
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:36,960
That is not in its playtime commercial in the in the play.

374
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,760
It's playtime branding. OK.

375
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:42,480
I like where he's dancing and then all the people in the Looney Tunes

376
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,400
characters run up behind him at the end of those commercials.

377
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,840
I like that. Yes. He's dancing with like Tweety Bird and Daffy Duck.

378
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,560
And then like children to a bunch of show a huge group.

379
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,840
And he does various things.

380
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:57,360
So it's like it's sort of unclear, like he's just a party mascot.

381
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,760
But also in one of the commercials, he's cleaning the park.

382
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:05,520
Yes. Buffing the roller coasters and sweeping up as well.

383
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:10,840
So he not only does he dance all day and all night with the Looney Tunes

384
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:14,520
and park guests, he's also part of the maintenance staff.

385
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,880
Yeah, his role is a little unclear.

386
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,080
I guess the ambassador of fun could cross over to needing to keep the park clean

387
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:26,040
because you're more in the mood to have fun if the place is clean.

388
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:29,000
That's true. I mean, I would it would also speak to, you know,

389
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,040
some staffing issues that Six Flags probably has across the country.

390
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,040
I mean, or honestly, the the

391
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,240
effort level of the teens that work there.

392
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,480
I would say it's largely due to some of the villains

393
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,040
we'll be talking about later in the in the podcast.

394
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,720
I think they might be the short, the short staffed nature of things.

395
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:55,160
Can we talk about what he's he's wearing?

396
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:59,480
I don't think the the audience, I think, I think if you're listening this far,

397
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,600
you know what he looks like.

398
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,800
But just just to just to say we did.

399
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:07,720
He is in a full tuxedo

400
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:14,040
where the jacket kind of hangs a little loose such that you can see his suspenders.

401
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,880
And there's always a bright red bow tie.

402
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:21,960
And and big, big, big, thick rimmed

403
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,560
glasses like a very I'm trying to think of it.

404
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,880
Is there another character who wears glasses like these?

405
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:32,640
I'm thinking of Dan Aykroyd and behind the candelabra as Liberace's manager,

406
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,040
but I'm sure there's a more famous example.

407
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,120
Mine is not a famous example.

408
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,080
It's but it's definitely what I think

409
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,880
Shelly Berman's character is Larry David's father on Curb Your Enthusiasm wears.

410
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,880
Yes, yes. Very good.

411
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,040
I want to see I want to say that I've seen

412
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:54,120
Carl Reiner wear glasses like this for a role, but the role is not coming to me.

413
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,160
Is it in one of the 11?

414
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:59,160
That's exactly what I just Googled and yet I couldn't find it.

415
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,840
Is someone else in Ocean's 11 in glass?

416
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,680
Elliot Gould. Oh, yeah.

417
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,360
Elliot Gould is wearing those big glasses.

418
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,960
Elliot Gould has the big glasses.

419
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,160
There we go. We got there. Thank you.

420
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,480
You know what a big one is?

421
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,920
These Coke bottle glasses. Junior Soprano.

422
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,000
Oh, yeah, yeah. Uncle June.

423
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,280
That's he looks the most like Uncle Junior.

424
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,280
Yes. Yeah.

425
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:23,560
Is that does this timeline add up that he was modeled after him?

426
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:26,240
Because now that you said that he looks exactly like him.

427
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:31,640
I I don't think they oh, they did do the joke where Uncle Junior is watching HBO

428
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,800
and curb is on and he's like, what am I?

429
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:36,160
That's what?

430
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:40,680
And he has like but I yeah, I'm surprised they never did.

431
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:43,040
Yeah, the timeline does line up.

432
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,040
But yeah, I think it's I think this is possible.

433
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:48,000
You're right that that that Mr. Six is based on this guy.

434
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,680
Yeah, really?

435
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:54,400
Because this helps explain why in an article that I have up,

436
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,280
it says that a New York City radio host wondered if Mr.

437
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:02,080
Six was actually Junior Soprano out on a bender.

438
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,920
Yeah. Damning words.

439
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,840
Sick burn. Wow.

440
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:13,600
It is surprising there is not an episode of The Sopranos where AJ fucks up in some way

441
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:18,600
and like Uncle Junior is the one who has to go to Six Flags and get him out of Six Flags jail.

442
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:22,200
Like posing as Mr. Six.

443
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,480
I mean, that'd be amazing.

444
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,240
But just like, well, Six Flags is right there.

445
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,680
It wouldn't be that far for them.

446
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:31,000
It's amazing they didn't go there.

447
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,200
They didn't go to enough theme parks on this.

448
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,560
No, they didn't.

449
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:37,880
There should have been like a Disneyland episode every season.

450
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,360
Oh, man. Disney World, like the ABC shows.

451
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,480
There should have been a Disney World Sopranos every season.

452
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,280
Well, this animal kingdom has so much to do.

453
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,680
A real safari.

454
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:57,720
I, Carmela Soprano, would be one to only stay at the Grand Floridian

455
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:00,080
and talk endlessly about how nice it is.

456
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,120
OK, so things are boring in this neighborhood.

457
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:07,400
And then an old man shows up in a bus and blasts some party music.

458
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,800
And that changes everything.

459
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:14,400
Why does that make you want to go to a theme park?

460
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,480
Yeah, well, the idea of partying

461
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:22,920
is funny to associate even with a theme park in my mind.

462
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,680
Like, we like to party.

463
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:29,200
I don't think of we're going to go on some rides.

464
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,680
To me, yes.

465
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:35,080
And any any theme park commercial, Disney included, that you see

466
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:37,440
where a bunch of people are partying in the streets.

467
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,680
This is rarely the feel.

468
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:44,440
Rarely does it feel like just an organic dance party has broken out.

469
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,600
Right. That doesn't that is not what I would describe.

470
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,320
Most people's theme park experiences. It's hot.

471
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:55,040
There's a lot of lines and their kids are screaming.

472
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,280
And we're going to go dance with an old man.

473
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:03,600
Or you watch other people dance and maybe you get to participate a little.

474
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,800
But really, they're more having the fun.

475
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:08,520
I don't know if I'm getting ahead of myself, but they did, of course,

476
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:12,360
bring him into the parks to have like a dance party with guests.

477
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:15,200
I don't know. I assume you guys saw that.

478
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,560
Yeah, I had to dig on the Internet Archive

479
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:21,480
because the the article linked on Wikipedia was gone,

480
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,280
but it was preserved on the Internet Archive.

481
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:26,240
You're talking about the Mr. Six lookalike contest.

482
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:29,520
No, I'm talking about an actual in-park Mr.

483
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:34,400
Six character that would organize like a dance party with sort of a hype man,

484
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:37,360
like teen that was around him that worked.

485
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,400
Oh, yes. Flags.

486
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,960
Yeah, they stuck him in all the parks.

487
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,240
Yeah, because he was so popular so quickly. Yeah.

488
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,080
This was a little later, too.

489
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,920
So I'm saying like they did try to get an actual like, quote unquote,

490
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,720
party going in the park.

491
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:53,280
But in general, if someone was like, hey, you want to go want to go to a party?

492
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,600
I would have been like, OK.

493
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:57,360
And I would have pictured like, you know, a party hat,

494
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,080
but not like going to the.

495
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,920
I like the picture of party hat.

496
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,000
Well, that's sort of the representation of my mind of what a party is,

497
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,440
is that fun little hat with the point at the top?

498
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:12,560
I was I was just trying to sum it up, of course.

499
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,720
It's pretty silly to be wearing a hat like that.

500
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,960
So, you know, yeah, fun.

501
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,960
You're in a heightened fun atmosphere, for sure.

502
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,960
If you're wearing a silly hat, you're going to have fun.

503
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,520
You're going to have a party.

504
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:26,880
But yes, I wouldn't associate that with like the cult, like the

505
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,720
I guess it would be hot black top at a six flags.

506
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,600
The poorly maintained buildings,

507
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,160
the rides that are fun yet scary

508
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:42,040
and the teens that work there that are apathetic and checked out.

509
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,880
Well, because I

510
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:49,600
the article that I have in front of me and I'm not saying I agree with this,

511
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:53,880
but it's maybe represents how I felt the first time I saw Mr. Six.

512
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:58,400
This is this, by the way, is this is from 2009 and this is Time Magazine

513
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:02,360
interviewing a critic for Adweek Time Magazine.

514
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,360
Took some time to discuss Mr. Six for a little while.

515
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:09,960
This is where this is the news is very different in 2009.

516
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:16,440
So just to just as a full hater, this is a Barbara Lippert from Adweek.

517
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:19,480
It's a pretty miserable piece of advertising.

518
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:22,680
It's as dumb as can be and talks down to us.

519
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:26,600
He's like an Elmer Fudd who never made it out into the country.

520
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,880
Not sure that that's not what's writing.

521
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,000
I don't know why this person is a professional.

522
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,280
You lady, you work in advertising.

523
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,560
You scumbag. Who are you to judge?

524
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,320
I come by. I'm completely on board with you there.

525
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,960
Just to continue.

526
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,960
And how does how exactly does a creepy old man in a bow tie

527
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,760
appeal to the kids that drive Six Flags business?

528
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:54,040
I don't think many 11 year olds relate to George Burns types.

529
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,200
OK, well, that's pretty funny.

530
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,200
I do like that.

531
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,520
So what's our response to that?

532
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:07,480
What is I because she's not I hated that Elmer Fudd joke,

533
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,800
but there's yeah, why?

534
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:12,640
Why is this? What does the old man have to do with it?

535
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,680
I think it's a hard question to defend.

536
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:20,040
Yeah. The only thing is, I feel like

537
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:23,640
maybe it was in vogue at the time in advertising to like

538
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:27,720
put something divisive up that really doesn't seem to make any sense

539
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,840
and would just like be burned in people's brain because this man's face,

540
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:36,520
this this haunting face was burned in my brain of like, OK.

541
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:40,080
But I didn't associate it with the brand in a good way.

542
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,520
So I think she's got a point here.

543
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,760
It wasn't doing anything that really made me go.

544
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:48,000
Oh, I would love to go have fun with that old man.

545
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:53,360
Well, I will say that I think it is a timeless teen thing

546
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:58,000
to like things that are funny because they're random.

547
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,120
Yeah, yes.

548
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:06,000
So in that respect, that I get that this is very much like a teen, like,

549
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,920
hey, everyone, it's an old man in a tuxedo dancing to

550
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:15,760
the Vengabas song, which is called We Like to Party, right?

551
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,840
Yes, it's officially called We Like to Party.

552
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:21,560
I always just called it the called it Vengabas or the Vengabas song.

553
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,320
Well, they're the Vengabois.

554
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,360
They are the Vengabois and they credit them.

555
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:29,240
So they sell themselves as Europe's number one party act on Twitter.

556
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:33,760
Right. And they make reference to the Vengabas in the song.

557
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,240
Yes.

558
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:39,320
Which I assume is like their Batmobile or their turtle party wagon.

559
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:44,440
Just the other day, they let us all know that the the party out

560
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:49,520
of their big hit album was now available for downloading and streaming.

561
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:53,200
Kind of a late late to the game on that Vengabois.

562
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:57,280
But now it's just now that's what it read like.

563
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:02,800
I didn't I didn't dig super far into it, but it did seem like it was now.

564
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,600
Maybe it's a remastered version of the album.

565
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,280
It could be remastered.

566
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,800
I mean, they still tour.

567
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,800
It was all the sessions.

568
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,400
All the sessions.

569
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:17,560
It was like a it was like pet sounds or blood on the tracks or something.

570
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:21,880
We want to hear every every every guitarist session on it.

571
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:26,800
Eight disc set, the demos, the different versions.

572
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:31,280
We were like a version called like we really like to party.

573
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,840
I think it's too much.

574
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,200
I think it is. It is sweaty.

575
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,560
No, an extra word.

576
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,760
Too much. Too many words.

577
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:45,400
You know, dance skis in there laying down a groove and then Del Mundo comes in like,

578
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:49,400
no, no, dance ski. No, no one would ever groove to this.

579
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,520
There should be a love and mercy about the Vengabois.

580
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:59,480
Yeah. And well, and there's there's like four or five members.

581
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,680
They seem to come and go.

582
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,960
So you need young and old versions of all of them.

583
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,160
Oh, yeah.

584
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:10,280
And Brian May on board because he produced the Queen movie.

585
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:14,160
I wanted some of that magic to be on this in this movie, too.

586
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:19,680
I think they might have some trouble making the film

587
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:25,160
because accurate information about the Vengabois is kind of at a premium.

588
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:28,080
I say this because I was on the Vengabois

589
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:33,280
Wikipedia, which said citation needed 42 times.

590
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:39,120
It was like weeds all over the article, which was not that long.

591
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:41,800
Who there's got to be.

592
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:46,240
I wonder who the number one Vengabois fan is in the world

593
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,560
that could maybe answer all these questions.

594
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,160
There's got to be somebody.

595
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,640
Hmm. Yeah.

596
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:54,320
He's probably like he's probably in like a big old Mr.

597
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,720
Seuss hat like Mr. Seuss, big old like cat in the hat hat.

598
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:02,680
You know, like the like the way we pictured ravers in 2002.

599
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,800
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

600
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,440
They very much look like that.

601
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:11,040
I mean, they're still rocking that all the picture like their profile picture

602
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:15,480
and like banner picture on Twitter, they look they look what you want.

603
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:20,440
Someone selling themselves as Europe's number one party act to look like, you know?

604
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,280
Yeah, the one that I'm looking at.

605
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:29,400
There's an aggressive amount of makeup on members, male and female.

606
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:34,400
There's like a there's a huge foam pink

607
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,640
cowboy hat with multiple sheriff's badges.

608
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,360
The other ones in like a dance version of he's a Marine

609
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:48,520
Marine National on his on his like Donald Duck, like Navy hat.

610
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,320
Yes. Yeah.

611
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:54,160
Even though it's then it's he's got his tassels, but then it's sleeveless

612
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:56,880
to show his rocket ship tattoo.

613
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:00,600
I've never found a LMAO so tasteful.

614
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:04,000
He's wearing like football shoulder pads, too.

615
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:08,920
He's got like a whole yeah, there's a lot going on on these in these outfits.

616
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:11,840
But leather, then leather and tassels.

617
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,720
Yes, there is a very upsetting photo.

618
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:22,520
I'm I'm worried if I don't stop looking at this Vengo boys photo, I might never stop.

619
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,400
There's a lot. Yeah, there's some

620
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:28,760
there's some pictures of them in like kind of all silver outfits, too, that I like.

621
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:32,480
And they kind of keep some of the same aesthetics like they still have

622
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,520
the cowboy hat.

623
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,880
It's just a smaller silver cowboy hat.

624
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:41,040
And then he still kind of has that like Navy hat, but it's a silver hat.

625
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:44,520
And he's got a like an anchor around his neck and now he's got a cape.

626
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:49,640
So I think they all keep sort of the same aesthetic with different outfits.

627
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,680
Hmm. OK.

628
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:54,160
So they have their theme that they stick to,

629
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:56,440
but it kind of changes through styles.

630
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:59,640
Right. That's my assumption about the Vengo boys.

631
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,400
A modern day village people.

632
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:05,960
What would the representation of, you know, law enforcement professions

633
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:10,040
and and the military and also not all boys?

634
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,760
Yes. No, not all boys.

635
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,520
Half not boys.

636
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,400
So it should be Venga people.

637
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,920
That's my pitch for them.

638
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:23,840
Can I ask, while you're if you it seems like

639
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:27,840
you already have Venga boys in a Google Image search, can you just add to that?

640
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,840
You already got Venga boys to just put in Chica

641
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:36,240
spelled like Cheetah, but with a K.

642
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:39,600
So C, H, E, E, K, A, H.

643
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:44,400
And now you will meet someone I met in the wick in their Wikipedia.

644
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:47,160
The fourth

645
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:49,200
not the four. It was for their fourth single.

646
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,760
They added a virtual member, the computer animated Chica.

647
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,600
Oh, like Gorilla's.

648
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:58,320
Yeah, they're doing a girl's thing. Yeah.

649
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,520
Way cooler.

650
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,720
I say this. I like Chica.

651
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:05,160
Yeah, I like Chica. I think I like Chica.

652
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,760
He I listen to the song.

653
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,920
He like raps in kind of like a computer.

654
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,360
Move your hands, stomp your feet.

655
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:18,960
He's like a, you know, the Stephen Hawking digital readout voice.

656
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:22,120
He's like that robot on the McGruff song.

657
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:24,040
Oh, yes. I'm glad I'm me.

658
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:26,040
You have to be safe.

659
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,240
You've got a lot going for yourself now.

660
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,480
You've got to keep your body strong, your mind sharp.

661
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:37,880
I think it's funny that Chica is considered a full member,

662
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,360
although separate from the band, because I'm seeing a

663
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,200
cover that says Venga boys featuring Chica.

664
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:48,640
She goes like Neil Young is to cross me stills Nash.

665
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,840
Oh, yes. Yeah.

666
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:53,960
A member, but outside she does his own thing, too.

667
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:54,760
Yeah.

668
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,280
I wonder, does Chica appear in any newer things

669
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:01,400
or is Chica sort of specifically just for this one song?

670
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:06,240
And have they spun out Chica into anything else?

671
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,920
Huh? I'm not sure.

672
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:11,920
Chica might be another IP we try to acquire at a certain point.

673
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,240
Yeah, it's like we're going to work by Chica.

674
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:18,000
Yeah, I think we could buy Chica is what I'm getting at.

675
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,600
And we could make our own Chica TV series.

676
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:25,520
You know him from the Venga boys and how he's free.

677
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,240
OK, wait a minute. Hold on a second.

678
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:33,400
I've stumbled on something that maybe is a reason we shouldn't buy Chica.

679
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,440
Oh, no. No.

680
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,680
All right. Urban Dictionary's definition of what Chica is.

681
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:45,000
The sound of a wingman wing woman keeping the driver awake by hand job.

682
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:49,480
What? I understand.

683
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:53,480
OK, here they have a little example from some dialogue they've written here.

684
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:57,400
Sam says, Benji, come with me to keep me awake.

685
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,760
Benji, how am I going to keep you awake?

686
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,040
Adrian, Chica, Chica, Chica.

687
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:08,440
And then a new then a fourth character, big boy dies from laughter.

688
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:09,720
Yes.

689
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,040
I don't understand.

690
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,840
I don't know what the Chica Chica means.

691
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,920
And does that sound that would only be

692
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:21,360
that would only be the sound if you were giving a hand job to like a loose doorknob.

693
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,880
That's not an automobile.

694
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:25,520
I don't know.

695
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,800
I don't think a penis makes a sound Chica Chica Chica.

696
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,760
Huh? I don't.

697
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:33,520
That is not the first thing I think of when I hear Chica.

698
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:38,920
I think of the you know, the first thing I think of is the Ferris Bueller song.

699
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,400
Chica, Chica.

700
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,000
That's what I think of.

701
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,400
Hmm. I don't think of giving a bus driver a hand job.

702
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,840
I remind it all that yellows.

703
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:55,840
Oh, yeah. And Venga Boys, Venga Bus is coming are are terrible songs

704
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:58,040
to have any kind of sex to.

705
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:00,560
Well, that's fair.

706
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,720
I mean, I think that's right.

707
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,000
I wasn't even thinking about that at all.

708
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Do you think anyone's ever like, well, you're ready?

709
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,080
Do you want to? Yeah.

710
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,560
Why don't we? Oh, yeah.

711
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,640
Oh, no.

712
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:21,840
That the Venga Boys video with Chica is very like sexy.

713
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:25,800
Like, there's a lot of people grinding on each other in a CGI nightclub.

714
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:28,200
What does Chica do? Is Chica getting involved?

715
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,320
Yeah, he's in the mix.

716
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,160
She's grinding on people.

717
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:35,640
Yes. And the Venga Boys like all dot like they all like

718
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:39,440
Jack in on computers like Jack in.

719
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:43,280
Jack, like Jason, like like in a matrix way,

720
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:46,320
like they all set up at like stations.

721
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:47,960
This video is great.

722
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:50,080
This is the future we were promised.

723
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:55,000
Yeah, one of them is a leather cowboy grooving out while watching

724
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:58,760
Chica run through a virtual hallway that says

725
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:03,600
with different doors that say gallery news download.

726
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:09,280
Chica, we should describe as like a little like television in his stomach.

727
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,520
He's like a green.

728
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,840
He's like an aqua color.

729
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,920
And he has a television in his stomach.

730
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,840
And he I don't know.

731
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:20,680
He looks like he also kind of looks like a reboot.

732
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,000
Yeah, very reboot.

733
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,240
He's their avatar.

734
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:27,920
The the Venga Boys are are dialing into the Internet.

735
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:32,400
And Chica is they're living vicariously through his nightclub experience.

736
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:36,080
Oh, yeah. This is this video is really like this is like a reboot.

737
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,800
If reboot went to like some dirty rave.

738
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:42,120
Reboot Triple X reboot and Triple X.

739
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:44,320
This is yeah, this is scandalous.

740
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:47,520
Jason, are you OK? Are you getting I'm a little

741
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:52,840
for Clempton and I yeah, I mean, I can see why

742
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,640
Chica never met Mr. Sex.

743
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:59,040
Like this is too bawdy for Mr. Sex.

744
00:40:59,200 --> 00:40:59,880
Oh, my gosh.

745
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:02,600
This is now he's like doing like leisure suit Larry types.

746
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,320
He's like a shorter guy and he's like walking up to women

747
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:07,840
and he's like giving them the eyes.

748
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,000
I got to turn this off.

749
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,040
This is too much for sensibility.

750
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:11,880
I'll spoil.

751
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:14,520
I'll spoil something for at some point, he pulls out a hose

752
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:17,560
and sprays everyone down.

753
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,680
I know we should.

754
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:22,960
Chica is not going to be purchased by the podcast, the ride LLC.

755
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:27,080
I will say that we did the body is check and yeah, too much.

756
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,440
Too much baggage, I think.

757
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:34,480
Marvel unless if there's a video of Marvel McFay grinding on CGI women,

758
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:35,880
then he's out, too.

759
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,840
But as far as we know, there's no video like that.

760
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,360
The video ends with the Vengo boys.

761
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:43,080
They all stand up and like

762
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:47,200
doff their caps to the camera and wave goodbye.

763
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:50,800
And then Chico waves goodbye and they turn their computers and the lights off.

764
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:54,440
They had to include that.

765
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,920
Yeah, wow.

766
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:01,320
It's it's creates full of shot close ups of digital butts and upskirts.

767
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,480
It's a very sexy music video.

768
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,560
Yeah, wow.

769
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:08,520
With very limited, but with characters, it's the kind of CGI where you say like

770
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:12,080
these characters would are probably like one foot tall, right?

771
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:15,240
There's no way they're tiny. They live in a computer.

772
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:17,800
Yeah, they're they're tiny for sure.

773
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:22,080
Yes, it's it's if you wish you were watching the CGI 90s

774
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:25,040
show reboot and wishing there was just a lot more butts,

775
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:30,160
a lot more butt on it, which I you know, a number of people were wishing.

776
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:31,520
Yeah, that's true.

777
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:34,240
I'm sure there's a lot of people going, oh, that's my dream.

778
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:36,320
I'm surprised I didn't hear about this sooner.

779
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:39,000
As always, do the DVNR check.

780
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,760
You know what? I will do the check.

781
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:48,080
So there's a comment that says that awkward moment

782
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:50,520
when the Venga boys predicted second life.

783
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:52,480
Hmm.

784
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:55,760
Not quite kind of accurate.

785
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,960
Why wasn't Chica in Ready Player One?

786
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:01,360
Oh, that would have been a perfect rep.

787
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:03,680
And yeah, he's in there. He's in the digital world.

788
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:06,920
Yeah. Yeah, they would have met him at some point.

789
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:10,160
Yeah. I mean, probably in the sequel that is probably not going to get made

790
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,840
because it didn't make enough money. Hmm.

791
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:15,800
I'm not seeing a ton of reboot.

792
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:18,680
Reboot might actually not be popular at all.

793
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,960
There's not any Mr. Six.

794
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:23,960
Like, that's a good question.

795
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:26,320
Gross stuff is there.

796
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:28,800
There is a term for this.

797
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,920
Is it rule? It's rule.

798
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:31,920
I forget what number.

799
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:33,000
Rule thirty four.

800
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,120
Are you going to search with our 34?

801
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:37,040
Is it the way to set the right number? Yeah. OK.

802
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,920
I think that's it.

803
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,200
Rule thirty four.

804
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,600
We don't think it is thirty four.

805
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:45,000
Thirty two. Seventy two.

806
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:48,000
I actually don't even know what the.

807
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,760
I'll search all the numbers, all the numbers.

808
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:53,080
OK, yes. I'm doing the dictionary.

809
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:54,160
It is rule rule.

810
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:56,640
Thirty four means if it exists, there's part of it.

811
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:59,040
OK, I see. OK.

812
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,720
Thirty four. Thirty four.

813
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,840
I'm I'm looking at this now.

814
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:05,360
So I should just look up Mr. Six rule thirty four.

815
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:07,760
Oh, my God.

816
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,760
You saw the dirty cartoons.

817
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:10,440
Oh, my God.

818
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:13,000
There's nothing to do with Mr. Six, but oh, it's really.

819
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:15,240
Oh, I don't even want to.

820
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:17,960
I can't describe. Oh, it's horrible.

821
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:20,080
Are you making this up, though?

822
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:22,920
No, no, this is just general.

823
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:25,480
I'll show you what I'm if you really want to see what I'm looking at.

824
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:26,920
It's disturbing.

825
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:28,440
Hmm. But it's not about Mr. Six.

826
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:29,560
We don't have to pay attention to it.

827
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:31,880
I don't think it has anything to do with Mr. Six.

828
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:33,760
No, it's all just like Tumblr crap.

829
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:36,920
Hmm. Oh, that's a haunting image.

830
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:38,080
I'll tell you that.

831
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:41,600
I mean, look, you can look Mr.

832
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:45,960
Six rule thirty four and do an image search and be horrified like me.

833
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:49,440
But please, if you are under a certain age, do not do that.

834
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:52,840
Do you have a more pleasant rule thirty four experience?

835
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:56,640
I just want to as it's coming up, I'm so proud of how much Moonbeam City

836
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:59,440
rule thirty four there is in its brief time.

837
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,360
Oh, my God, so much.

838
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:03,320
I'm so happy.

839
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:04,800
A lot of it is very good.

840
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,440
Like they could have been artists on the show.

841
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,800
Great work, everyone.

842
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:14,480
There's one of the character that I voiced, the news anchor Genesis Jones,

843
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,360
and he has a translucent news desk.

844
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:19,800
And if you look through it, he's got a big erect penis sticking out.

845
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:20,960
Oh, my God.

846
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:24,040
That's what I keep talking about, putting on my wall and framing,

847
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:26,440
which I always wanted to do and now probably should not do that

848
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:28,200
now that I have a child.

849
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,080
Yeah, you should probably not do that.

850
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:33,360
But maybe if you're in an office or office, yeah, for sure.

851
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:35,680
When you would take a meeting, have that up.

852
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:36,400
Definitely. Yeah.

853
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,840
And if I feel like that's going to be dicey or make anyone uncomfortable,

854
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:41,720
I could have like a little flag that flips up and covers it.

855
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:43,200
You know, just like I could.

856
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:44,320
I'll get up to a light switch.

857
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:46,200
I'll talk to somebody to do the wiring

858
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:49,000
so we can switch the the penis flag on.

859
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,680
Got to make sure that it's good, because like if you're in there

860
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:55,280
with like Jeffrey Katzenberg or something and like it malfunctions,

861
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:57,880
he's going to my office.

862
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,080
Well, yeah, I assume.

863
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:01,240
Well, what is this topsy turvy world?

864
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:04,880
It's like the whole world got flipped horizontal and vertical.

865
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:06,960
It's called a power play.

866
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:09,080
It's called a power play, Scott.

867
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:12,200
Well, well, look who has the power now, Mr.

868
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:13,480
Katzenberg.

869
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:15,960
He's like, I've been hearing about what you've been saying about Quibi,

870
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:17,400
and you're absolutely right.

871
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:22,160
And I'm here to humble myself and say, what would you do to fix it?

872
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:24,440
You're in charge of Quibi now.

873
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:26,480
Yeah, hell yeah.

874
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:27,600
Makes sense.

875
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:29,320
That should that should be me in Quibi.

876
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:32,960
Like I'm the guy I'm the guy who mouthed off in the meetings.

877
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:36,120
But then they like that because it shows that I have balls

878
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:39,360
and I'm willing to say what's on my mind.

879
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:44,080
And I guess my idea for how to fix Quibi would be to bring back

880
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:48,040
my own show, Moonbeam City, but have it be full of full frontal nudity.

881
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:50,840
Which is, of course, what you were.

882
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:52,920
That was the thing you tried to do from the start.

883
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:56,160
But I always always said no tension with Comedy Central.

884
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:57,840
Yes. Yeah.

885
00:46:57,840 --> 00:47:00,040
The rec penis is often as possible.

886
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,360
They had a problem with that.

887
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:05,560
Yeah, boy. Yes, I should have known.

888
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:06,720
Anyway, yeah.

889
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:11,640
Well, yeah, a future quibi in their desperation will be full of Genesis

890
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:13,320
Jones dicks.

891
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:15,760
Let's get let's let's veer out of here.

892
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:19,320
Let's let's unplug from the matrix like the Bunga Boys. Yeah.

893
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:21,640
What can we get to?

894
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:22,440
I will go all here.

895
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:24,160
Let's stay on the Bingo Boys topic.

896
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:25,680
And I will I will say this.

897
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:28,280
I think a lot of the reason that I didn't respond to this stuff

898
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:32,280
for a long time is I think that song is dog shit.

899
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:36,360
It is not one.

900
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:40,040
I put it in the same category, sort of like the like the novelty songs

901
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:43,560
around this time, and I know Barbie Girl is years earlier,

902
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:46,200
but I think Barbie Girl is like a way better song.

903
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:47,840
I absolutely agree.

904
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:52,000
And I'm still no fan of Barbie Girl, but there's like a there's there's a hook.

905
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:55,240
I think the musicians are more talented than the singers.

906
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:59,440
Like I have a song, I guess I have a soft spot for Barbie Girl, but yeah,

907
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:03,640
the Bingo Boys, we like to party was never it's sort of a drone.

908
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:07,040
Yeah, kind of just kind of goes on.

909
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:11,080
It's not so like they yeah, it's not there's not even like, yeah,

910
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:13,360
like as you're saying, a hook

911
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:15,760
for like a kind of a gimmick novelty song.

912
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:18,560
Yeah, I'm blue.

913
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:20,240
I'm blue by Aqua.

914
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:21,000
Who did blue?

915
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,320
I think I was 65.

916
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:25,600
No, no, no. I was 65.

917
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:26,960
Yeah.

918
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:30,520
My friends and I was just I was just going to mention I'm Blue.

919
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:33,960
My friends and I hated that song because we worked at a theater camp

920
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:39,920
on a college campus and they had TVs just in like the one like common area.

921
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:44,800
And it would just play music videos on a loop and it would play like I'm Blue,

922
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:48,600
like every hour like we would just go insane.

923
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:51,000
Like they were playing it so much.

924
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:52,320
Any song like this?

925
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:56,240
I don't quite understand how people listen to it at all.

926
00:48:56,240 --> 00:49:00,200
I find them so annoying, like such it's the definition of earworm.

927
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:04,240
But in a in a bad way where the worm like chews through your entire brain.

928
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:09,160
Yeah, I I'm I do think we like to party.

929
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:10,560
I'm really trying to search.

930
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:13,160
I think Blue was annoying to me.

931
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:16,160
But once in a while you'd listen to and go, OK, all right.

932
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:20,360
There's but I don't think there was ever a time with we like to party.

933
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:21,920
Guys, guys.

934
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:23,000
Wait, I'm sorry.

935
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,960
I feel 65 also has a digital member.

936
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:27,440
What?

937
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:31,560
I don't know his name, but he's in all look at do a Google image.

938
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:35,880
So we have to do it, I guess, an episode about digital members

939
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:38,200
of bands that are otherwise human.

940
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:39,800
Oh, wow. I feel 65.

941
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:41,320
So is it just this guy?

942
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:42,600
I hate this guy.

943
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:44,800
Hold on. Let me see. Oh, wait a minute.

944
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:50,280
Oh, you know, the guy with like a like an ammo belt around his chest or the ammo.

945
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:52,200
He's in like what I'm looking at.

946
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:55,080
He's in like a like a black leather skirt.

947
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:57,360
Oh, I see him now.

948
00:49:57,360 --> 00:50:00,880
Oh, he's like a really low fi mega mind.

949
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:08,080
He is like a euro like a euro dirty clubber mega mind.

950
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:13,080
I hate things like that, and I hate that for the fucking fraud.

951
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:16,440
The frog that seemed to rule Europe for a whole decade.

952
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:18,200
Crazy frog.

953
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:19,880
Who's crazy frog?

954
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:20,880
Mike.

955
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Response.

956
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:28,800
The better than rare rare rare rare rare rare rare rare rare rare rare rare rare.

957
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:30,320
Oh, what is it?

958
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:31,440
What are you talking about?

959
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:34,840
When I think of crazy frog, I think of Axel F, the like

960
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:37,840
the techno version of the Beverly Hills cops.

961
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:42,120
Wait, Jason, you're thinking of the hamster dance, aren't you?

962
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:45,080
Am I? Is that the hamster dance?

963
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:46,720
Crazy Frog had a whole album.

964
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:48,160
He had a bunch of songs.

965
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:50,640
Oh, man. Why don't I know crazy frog?

966
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:53,000
Oh, they're wait. This is crazy frog.

967
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:55,120
Huh?

968
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:58,120
I guess I really don't know crazy frog.

969
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:00,760
He looks familiar.

970
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:03,000
He looks like like an extreme video.

971
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,600
He looks like Gax or Crash Bandicoot or something.

972
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,320
I think he was way bigger in Europe.

973
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:13,480
And I spent I studied abroad and in right in the middle in 2005.

974
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:17,200
And I just remember seeing crazy frog everywhere, hearing that song everywhere.

975
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:20,400
Probably people playing crazy frogs album, crazy hits.

976
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:23,040
Yeah. Crazy Frog charted.

977
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:27,760
Wait, he covered We Like to Party, the Venga Boys.

978
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:29,080
Crazy frog.

979
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:31,160
What's new? What does he have to bring to it?

980
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:34,240
I was crazy frog going to do anything different that the Venga boys

981
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:35,080
hadn't already done.

982
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:36,240
Oh, my God, you're right. Here it is.

983
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:38,560
Crazy frog. We like to party.

984
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:40,640
He did the theme of Dallas.

985
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:44,800
I don't understand.

986
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:46,480
It's a confusing discography.

987
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:49,400
Crazy frog is crazy frog before the gorillas.

988
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:51,600
I don't remember.

989
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:55,200
Album came out in 2001, I want to say.

990
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:58,320
So did you thousand 2001.

991
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:01,200
So is who's the who's the so when you're up,

992
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:04,640
obviously it was a big thing to have a CGI character who started it.

993
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:05,640
Do we know?

994
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:11,320
I mean, it might have been started by the gorillas.

995
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:14,440
So did Damon Albarn, is he the innovator here?

996
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:16,520
Well, I think about this.

997
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:20,320
I feel 65 blue predated even that, of course.

998
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:22,760
Yeah, I was when I was in high school.

999
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:26,160
And I don't know where you include Paul Abdul's friend,

1000
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:27,920
MC Scat Cat in any of this.

1001
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:31,400
But, you know, it probably has to factor into the family tree somewhere.

1002
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:33,400
Yes, I think that's right.

1003
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:36,080
Well, this is a whole this is a whole day.

1004
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:38,280
Yeah, I know. We can't say now.

1005
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:39,520
We can't get lost.

1006
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:41,000
Oh, my God. The recording.

1007
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,760
There's multiple there's multiple blue CGI characters

1008
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:48,320
in the video for I feel 65 blue da body.

1009
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:50,680
No, multiple.

1010
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:53,240
Yeah, there's two in there and there's like a CGI spaceship.

1011
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:56,360
And this also predates Avatar.

1012
00:52:57,160 --> 00:52:57,760
Oh, wow.

1013
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:01,880
Not only all of this, including the gorillas stolen from my 65,

1014
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:04,880
as is the Avatar franchise.

1015
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:07,600
I feel 65 was ripped off left and right.

1016
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:12,440
John, we need we need to get like this situation like righted.

1017
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:14,520
This is this is bullshit.

1018
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:16,480
You know, there's that thing like, well, the Velvet Underground

1019
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:18,640
inspired everything that came after.

1020
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:21,640
This is like if the Velvet Underground also inspired Jaws.

1021
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:26,120
I agree without I feel 65.

1022
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:28,240
We don't have Father of the Pride.

1023
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:30,320
We don't have Game Over.

1024
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:33,480
You know, we don't have all of these wonderful cultural artifacts.

1025
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:38,600
Wow. Man, we need we need to look into I feel 65.

1026
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:41,680
All right, we'll go we'll go further into them and their company,

1027
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:44,080
the Bliss Corporation.

1028
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:49,560
I hate I hate threatening to move us away and then move us right back in.

1029
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:52,120
But I think I discovered the name of the character.

1030
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:53,840
Oh, no, please. No, that is relevant.

1031
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:57,200
Zorado.

1032
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:59,400
Zorotl.

1033
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:01,680
Zorotl.

1034
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:03,800
Oh, yes, I see it.

1035
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:06,880
Oh, it's it's spelled like, you know, very like, like Spanish.

1036
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:08,840
So with the T and the L next to each other.

1037
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:11,240
Zorotl. Where you're confused about how to pronounce it.

1038
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:13,920
Yeah, it's a character created by the Bliss Corporation

1039
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:17,880
and featured in the videos of Blue Dabadi, Move Your Body and Lucky in My Life.

1040
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:21,200
Wait, but he has a more full name.

1041
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:24,440
Zorotl Kuyo Kow Sushik the fourth.

1042
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:27,440
Yes, that's true.

1043
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:29,640
He was supposed to be a malicious character.

1044
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:32,480
But since he was designed with a funny, round body,

1045
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:37,520
the authors of the Blue Dabadi video decided to portray him in a tender,

1046
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:43,360
I guess, portray it as a tender change as a script and giving it a happy ending.

1047
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:44,440
Yeah, that's not a set.

1048
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:46,360
Now, wait a minute here.

1049
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:51,160
OK, I thought April 65 had been ripped off, but look, they did the ripping off.

1050
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:53,240
Think about this, a malicious character.

1051
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:55,760
But he's got a funny, round body, so they made him a friend instead.

1052
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:57,840
This is Grimace.

1053
00:54:57,840 --> 00:54:59,800
They stole it all from Grimace.

1054
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:03,800
Yeah, Grimace in the McDonald Land gang was stolen from Sid and Marty Croft.

1055
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,520
Right. So that so actually this trail of ripoffs.

1056
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:08,640
Wait, where does it end?

1057
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:12,120
We're saying that the Damon Albarn and the Gorillaz ripped off Sid and Marty Croft.

1058
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:15,200
Yes, that's basically it.

1059
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:17,200
We saw as does did James Cameron.

1060
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:20,480
Yes. And I think I full 65.

1061
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:22,880
Well, I think Sid and Marty Croft have a lawsuit on their hands

1062
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:25,800
with everyone in the entertainment industry.

1063
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:29,840
Yeah. McDonald's first off, they got to solve that one.

1064
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:31,280
Finally, they got to make that right.

1065
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:33,920
And then James Cameron. Yeah.

1066
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:35,840
All right. Now I'm exhausted.

1067
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:37,680
I know I am, too.

1068
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:39,160
Jason, you seem to have a plan.

1069
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:41,440
I'll let you run with it.

1070
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:44,280
Should we talk about I mean, Mike, as you started to say,

1071
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:47,600
Mr. Six was brought into the parks to dance with the people.

1072
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:50,160
There were local Mr. Six's, you know.

1073
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:56,960
And like any good theme park IP that marketing woman you referenced did talk about,

1074
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:59,640
especially when they were talking about bringing him back.

1075
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:01,440
They're like, well, he is our IP.

1076
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:04,920
We created him. He's like the only original character we have.

1077
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:09,320
So there's merchandise of Mr. Six.

1078
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:11,720
Did you guys come across this stuff?

1079
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:14,840
No, no. I think I missed it.

1080
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:17,280
Oh, you didn't see any of the Mr. Six merchandise.

1081
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:18,840
I think I just. Yeah.

1082
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:20,920
There's a lot on eBay.

1083
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:23,960
I just texted the T-shirt.

1084
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:26,720
This is like a design that's on a bunch of T-shirts,

1085
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:30,800
and then they just change at the very bottom in real small print.

1086
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:33,320
This one says Six Flags Great America.

1087
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:36,840
I saw Astroworld ones, too.

1088
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:38,760
These are very reasonably priced, too.

1089
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:40,880
This is like very reasonably priced.

1090
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:43,080
This is like 20 bucks for a new shirt.

1091
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:46,560
I might I might get that because that's my size.

1092
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:51,120
But then I found the same design, but he takes up the whole shirt

1093
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:53,080
and it's a little more upset.

1094
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:56,160
Like this should not be this big on a shirt.

1095
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:59,560
And this is while you send it, this is Mr. Six.

1096
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:03,920
He's kind of doing like jazz hands in the center of a roller coaster.

1097
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,960
That's the design we're looking at.

1098
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:09,440
Yeah. So as you can see, that's a small like chest sized one.

1099
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:14,240
And then this this other this blue one I just said is like very large.

1100
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:16,400
It is, but it's not as bad.

1101
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,240
I thought you were I thought you were heading for that.

1102
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:21,560
It was just his big face was the entirety of the.

1103
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:27,160
Oh, no. Oh, I wish they also had very dignified looking shot glasses

1104
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:30,360
that kind of had a more of an adult Mr.

1105
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:33,280
Six, kind of the silhouette Mr. Six.

1106
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:38,560
This is his his brown derby caricature.

1107
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:40,400
Yeah, his round derby caricature.

1108
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:46,120
You know, you got bobbleheads, of course, but then the best.

1109
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:48,680
You got the Mr. Six teddy bears.

1110
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:52,400
Oh, I'm dreading this.

1111
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:55,280
No, they're cute.

1112
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:57,320
I'm seeing. Oh, yeah, they're cute.

1113
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:59,880
All right, fine. Yeah, they are.

1114
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,240
Big old. He's been by.

1115
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:07,240
Yeah, he's they're in suits and big, shiny shoes

1116
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:12,360
that say six flags and it's playtime at the bottom and then big, big, thick glasses.

1117
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:14,920
Yeah. Oh, that are leather.

1118
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:17,920
And the leather kind of makes them look like, you know, like

1119
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:22,560
BDSM masks, but I won't hold that against the bears.

1120
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:24,480
Yeah, we can't go into that right now.

1121
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:27,080
We went too far. It's already been this episode.

1122
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:30,560
Yeah. And does the B and BDSM stand for body?

1123
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:33,760
It must. I won't look into it further, but it must.

1124
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:36,640
It stands for boys, comma, Venga.

1125
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:44,280
I'm seeing there's a I'm seeing T public has sort of like bootleg merch

1126
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:48,040
and one thing says hashtag save Mr. Six.

1127
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:52,080
Hmm. But he doesn't need saving now.

1128
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:54,440
Yeah, I guess. I don't know if they want to.

1129
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:56,040
This should be like bring him back, maybe.

1130
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:58,800
But there's some sort of a save Mr. Six movement.

1131
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:01,320
Hmm. It's on coffee cups.

1132
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:03,440
There's a bumper sticker.

1133
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:06,920
But he's I mean, he's they use him still

1134
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:10,600
currently, correct?

1135
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:12,840
I don't know. The last time moment.

1136
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:14,280
I don't think they're doing it right now.

1137
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:16,480
I don't remember the last time they've used him.

1138
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:23,400
I think I watched there was a 2017 like new at Six Flags video.

1139
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:25,600
Did you guys see this with an executive?

1140
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,200
No. And he's a bald man.

1141
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:33,960
And he said and just he basically said, and no, I'm not Lex Luthor.

1142
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:37,240
And then it cuts to a Lex Luthor shot from the Justice League ride.

1143
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:39,360
And he went and I'm not Mr.

1144
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:41,760
Six and it cuts to Mr. Six.

1145
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:43,800
And he goes, so don't ask me to dance.

1146
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:47,000
That's great.

1147
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:48,960
I like that.

1148
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:53,440
Well, you know how he factors into the parks is there are a couple

1149
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:56,080
attractions based on him.

1150
00:59:57,360 --> 01:00:00,200
There is a he is

1151
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:05,840
a sort of the figurehead of a kids play area

1152
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:09,400
at Hurricane Harbor here in California.

1153
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:12,120
And I think another one is another water park as well

1154
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:15,000
called Mr. Six's Splash Island.

1155
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:18,720
And it's one of those areas where, you know, it's like a little like

1156
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:23,440
fortress with a big bucket that fills up slowly and dumps every half hour.

1157
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:25,000
So it's one of those.

1158
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,480
And he is a big like plastic Mr.

1159
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:32,160
Six, and he's he's surfing these riding riding a big plastic wave,

1160
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:36,480
even though he's still in the full tuxedo.

1161
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:39,880
Classic Mr. Six doesn't even take the clothes off to surf.

1162
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:41,920
That's fun.

1163
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:43,560
Yeah, that's a lot of fun.

1164
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:45,560
And then he

1165
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:50,440
there was a ride called Mr.

1166
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:55,760
Six's Pandemonium that at some point in time

1167
01:00:55,960 --> 01:01:01,120
when they kind of turned against Mr. Six, it got renamed Tony Hawk's Big Spin.

1168
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:06,000
The same ride was somehow both Mr.

1169
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:10,360
Six and Tony Hawk, which I I don't like to make this accusation,

1170
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:13,440
but I think on Tony Hawk's part, this is a bit of stolen valor.

1171
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:18,880
Yeah, he shouldn't have accepted knowing he was stealing this from Mr. Six.

1172
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:20,760
Yeah, I don't know.

1173
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:24,560
There's a good there's a chance he wasn't aware, but I'd say there's

1174
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:30,040
yeah, probably a good 99.9 percent chance he wasn't aware.

1175
01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:33,880
But even if there was that one chance and he did it

1176
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:37,160
knowingly to fuck Mr. Six, shame on you, Tony Hawk.

1177
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:39,400
Yeah, I agree with that.

1178
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:41,880
It is interesting because it definitely felt like they were

1179
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:46,400
flirting here and there with really going all in on Mr. Six.

1180
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:51,440
Like, yeah, it felt like they were like it was like a lot of start and stop.

1181
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:54,920
And then they would like because he went away for a little while.

1182
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:57,480
And then when he came back into the park and when he talked,

1183
01:01:57,960 --> 01:02:01,160
that, as we were saying, was like kind of a maybe a fix,

1184
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:03,440
like a like a quick fix version.

1185
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:04,840
But then they were like, all right, we're back.

1186
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:05,920
We're all in on him.

1187
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:07,880
Obviously, they named some rides after him.

1188
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:09,520
And then they stopped it again.

1189
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:11,600
It feels like they needed to commit.

1190
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:13,520
And they did it. They they did.

1191
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:17,120
And for a brief time, he had a buddy named Little Six.

1192
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:21,800
No, a child who looked like Mr.

1193
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:24,280
dressed like Mr. Six.

1194
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:27,360
And he's introduced by Mr.

1195
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:29,280
Six walking along.

1196
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:33,400
And then he looks to the side of the screen and he goes, Little Six.

1197
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:35,880
And then Little Six is there dancing.

1198
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:39,920
Yes, Little Six, which.

1199
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:41,920
Yes, Scott.

1200
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:44,240
I think I don't I'm going to say I don't like Little Six.

1201
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:47,920
I'm not the biggest fan of Little Six.

1202
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:51,080
Now, I'll tell you what I'm OK with at some point.

1203
01:02:51,080 --> 01:02:54,560
You know, the one thing about Six Flags, they they're very much a

1204
01:02:55,040 --> 01:03:00,400
come on down like they do contests and stuff like a radio show.

1205
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:03,760
Like, come on down and sleep in the coffin.

1206
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:05,800
Stay in the coffin all weekend.

1207
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:10,480
They did a Mr. Six contest of like look like dancing

1208
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:15,640
and lookalikes and a child won twenty five hundred dollars.

1209
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:18,240
In this contest.

1210
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:22,560
That's great. And the young person one, I think he shaved his head for this.

1211
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:24,000
Is what I saw.

1212
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,080
So he looks pretty good. Yeah.

1213
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:27,520
His head looks good.

1214
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:28,840
You can see a big group.

1215
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:30,400
They flew people in.

1216
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:32,640
And some of these bald caps look like shit.

1217
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:35,640
Some of these costumes are wrecked.

1218
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:37,600
They're they're not great.

1219
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:40,280
But Jordan, the winner, Jordan Pope,

1220
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:44,000
thirteen of Prophet's Town, Illinois, won this contest.

1221
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:48,080
And Jim Crowley, the marketing director of Six Flags, Great America, said,

1222
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:50,960
Jordan truly embodies the spirit of Six Flags.

1223
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:54,640
He had Mr. Six's unique dance moves down to his science.

1224
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:57,600
The crowd went wild when he took the stage.

1225
01:03:58,280 --> 01:04:04,680
Well, I'm glad that he was rewarded more than the person who won the coffin

1226
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:07,520
challenge that was at Six Flags Fright Fest last year.

1227
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:09,480
When in case you don't know, I'm talking about we did.

1228
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:13,120
There's a Patreon episode of Anthony Geo and I went to Fright Fest at Six Flags

1229
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:16,960
where people would have to lie in a coffin on the grounds of Six Flags

1230
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:19,760
for like seventy two straight hours.

1231
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:25,840
And there a reward for that was a season pass to Six Flags and like five hundred

1232
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:28,200
dollars. I think it was six hundred dollars.

1233
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:29,680
Six hundred. OK.

1234
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:32,200
They always give out these weird amounts.

1235
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:37,600
They, I guess, were very happy with the response of Mr. Six.

1236
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:42,960
They said further, The buzz has far exceeded our original hopes for the campaign.

1237
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:47,440
We had no idea that America would embrace Mr. Six with this level of enthusiasm.

1238
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:51,600
The overwhelming response to his first appearance at our park in Gurney,

1239
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:54,920
Illinois, is a great example of this phenomenon.

1240
01:04:56,080 --> 01:04:58,720
They're so sure they're so confident.

1241
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:01,680
And where where's the proof?

1242
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:03,520
I guess this event.

1243
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:05,840
Two hundred individuals dressed like Mr.

1244
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:08,080
Six, trying to do his dance moves.

1245
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:10,560
It's a really good video. I'll say that.

1246
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:12,640
If you look up there, you can watch a video of Mr.

1247
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:15,760
Six look like gods. And then they have a parade, a parade.

1248
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:19,160
Oh, yeah. Entirely Mr. Six.

1249
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:22,360
One of them's writing a big Marvin the Martian canon.

1250
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:24,840
It's a lot of fun. Oh, great.

1251
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:27,800
I love it. Did people come out, though, for their love of the character

1252
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:30,120
or do they just want that money?

1253
01:05:31,040 --> 01:05:33,480
I would think it might be the money.

1254
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:34,600
Some of them, I'm sure.

1255
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:36,920
Some of them, I'm sure they just like Mr. Six.

1256
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:40,720
It's not always about the money.

1257
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:43,480
Yeah, you're right. Maybe I've grown cynical in my old age to think

1258
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:47,280
that people didn't want to come out just to celebrate their love of this character.

1259
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:52,800
I hope that that child did the right thing and put the money

1260
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:55,360
straight into a college fund and thought about his future.

1261
01:05:56,360 --> 01:05:59,120
Right. Because I mean, he

1262
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,320
I hope he was thinking like he would save so he would have that money

1263
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:06,320
when he was Mr. Six's actual age.

1264
01:06:06,320 --> 01:06:09,800
Yes, that's what he should be that reminder for all of us.

1265
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:13,640
And do we know I know Mr. Six's actual age as well.

1266
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:16,840
Oh, yeah. Because it was told to me in that video

1267
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:20,800
I referenced earlier by the person, the SVP of Six Flags.

1268
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:24,800
Mr. Six is 80 years old. Oh, my God.

1269
01:06:25,640 --> 01:06:28,200
She definitively says he's 80 years old.

1270
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:33,240
Hmm. So there's still that was in 2004.

1271
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:35,480
So I guess he's eternally 80 years old.

1272
01:06:35,480 --> 01:06:36,800
Yeah, I think that's sort of the idea.

1273
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:38,960
I don't think he's like 110 now.

1274
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:42,520
I didn't, by the way, I can't.

1275
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:45,160
It must be 30 years later.

1276
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:47,280
So something like that. Yeah, 2004.

1277
01:06:48,280 --> 01:06:53,040
You know, I think the like the lookalike contest, the merchandise,

1278
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:56,480
I think that's all pretty respectful of Mr. Six.

1279
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:59,360
Like this is the treatment of theme park character deserves.

1280
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:04,560
I have to say to the Wikipedia editors out there, the picture of Mr.

1281
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:10,720
Six on Wikipedia is just some jerk in a Halloween costume.

1282
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:14,680
That is not at all respectful to Mr. Six.

1283
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:18,480
Not the official commercial version. No.

1284
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:21,040
Hmm. Yeah, you're right.

1285
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:22,520
Yeah, it's just a bit.

1286
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:25,520
It says as such a Halloween costume based on his likeness.

1287
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:31,800
I mean, it's a pretty it's a decent Halloween costume, but come on, gang.

1288
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:35,480
Huh? Yeah, that's yeah.

1289
01:07:35,480 --> 01:07:38,520
I don't know why we should email Google about that.

1290
01:07:39,360 --> 01:07:43,800
I think I think I have problems with Halloween costumes in general.

1291
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:48,440
I'm going to send you guys a photo of one that's been bugging me since I saw it.

1292
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:53,640
Maybe this is getting getting me back into the unpleasant Aladar territory.

1293
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:54,800
I don't know what I'm looking at here.

1294
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:57,240
This is like a big rubber mask on a on a child.

1295
01:07:57,520 --> 01:07:59,000
It's not Little Six.

1296
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:02,320
It's separately a child's Halloween costume of Mr. Six.

1297
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:06,200
What do you think, though?

1298
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:08,400
Oh, yeah, I don't like that at all.

1299
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:11,640
All right. OK, few.

1300
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:12,680
You know what?

1301
01:08:12,680 --> 01:08:16,760
Now that I'm looking at it, I go to say

1302
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:21,080
that I'm starting to feel that it's horrible.

1303
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:23,880
Oh, few few.

1304
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:26,720
His like, what's wrong with the tongue?

1305
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:28,800
I don't know. Yeah, the tongue is like pressed.

1306
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:32,160
It's as if the tongue is coming from his upper gums.

1307
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:34,880
Yeah. What frightening.

1308
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:37,840
The glasses aren't even right.

1309
01:08:39,080 --> 01:08:41,280
True. And it's it's

1310
01:08:41,480 --> 01:08:44,320
it's it is a pretty good mask is the thing.

1311
01:08:44,360 --> 01:08:47,720
It's it's it's pretty high quality, but it kind of puts it into that

1312
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:49,160
uncanny valley territory.

1313
01:08:49,160 --> 01:08:50,800
Yeah, it's just it's unnerving.

1314
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:52,480
It's just unnerving.

1315
01:08:52,480 --> 01:08:53,960
That's the thing.

1316
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:55,960
And I think that's sort of the feeling about this.

1317
01:08:55,960 --> 01:08:57,760
Let me let me let me sidetrack real quick.

1318
01:08:57,760 --> 01:08:59,960
And we have a couple more things I'm sure to talk about, Mr. Six.

1319
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:04,280
But I was trying to think of other old man mascots,

1320
01:09:04,760 --> 01:09:10,480
other famous old care old people characters that promote products.

1321
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:13,240
And there are a lot of them.

1322
01:09:13,240 --> 01:09:17,160
And I think I like all of them more than Mr. Six.

1323
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:20,440
OK, should we give you like a yay or nay if we agree?

1324
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:23,240
Yes. Quaker Oatsman.

1325
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:26,960
Yay. Nay. Yay.

1326
01:09:28,320 --> 01:09:30,960
What's your problem, Mr. Six? Yeah.

1327
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:34,880
I got to see him dance first.

1328
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:37,920
Colonel Sanders. Yay.

1329
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:41,040
No, I. You don't like any of these.

1330
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:45,480
I feel like there's some gnarly stuff about Colonel Sanders.

1331
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:48,120
Well, yes, of course, there's no him.

1332
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:50,440
But yeah, the made up idea of him.

1333
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:54,640
Go away any problematic part of it, just the friendly,

1334
01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:58,480
sanitized version of the character.

1335
01:09:58,920 --> 01:10:00,800
I liked cartoon Colonel Sanders.

1336
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:04,600
I'm starting they're starting to lose me with all these like a million people play

1337
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:06,880
like I'm not there. Colonel Sanders.

1338
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:08,240
All right. That's OK. Fine.

1339
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:09,920
You're just being contrarian, though.

1340
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:11,840
Orville Orville Redenbacher.

1341
01:10:13,240 --> 01:10:16,880
Foof. I like him, but not CGI him.

1342
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:20,320
That's fair, Jason.

1343
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:23,160
I'm going to say that was a tie.

1344
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:25,680
I would say the same. You like them the same.

1345
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:27,680
I like him the same as Mr. Six.

1346
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:29,800
I don't think I've seen the CG version.

1347
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:34,760
All right. How about Mr. Whipple, the the old man

1348
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:39,600
who would say don't squeeze my charm in the toilet paper?

1349
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:44,800
Mm hmm. I need some refreshing on what's up with Mr.

1350
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:47,040
Mr. Whipple, Mr. Whipple.

1351
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:49,440
Here's a picture of him.

1352
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:50,800
This is before my time.

1353
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:52,880
I don't know. No, Mr. Sherman.

1354
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:54,920
But I like the idea of him.

1355
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:57,080
Again, there's probably problematic stuff there,

1356
01:10:57,600 --> 01:10:59,840
but just the idea of this old man.

1357
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:02,040
Why is there problematic stuff?

1358
01:11:02,040 --> 01:11:04,520
I don't know. I'm just saying I'm just I'm just getting it out of the way

1359
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:05,960
in case there is.

1360
01:11:05,960 --> 01:11:08,840
What did what? Because he's an old actor from the past.

1361
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:10,880
Well, Jason brought it up with Colonel Sanders.

1362
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:12,160
Then I was like, yeah, Jason's probably right.

1363
01:11:12,160 --> 01:11:14,920
All of these characters probably are in some horrible

1364
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:16,920
born out of some horrible tradition.

1365
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:19,560
No, why are you Colonel Sanders?

1366
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:21,760
Yeah, the man. Yeah.

1367
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:23,640
Yeah. What did Mr.

1368
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:25,520
What did Mr. Whipple do to anybody?

1369
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:28,040
Hey, I don't know what his affiliations were.

1370
01:11:28,040 --> 01:11:30,640
I don't know what Mr. Whipple did.

1371
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:33,760
I just don't to leap to that he's problematic

1372
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:35,880
with zero proof.

1373
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:38,280
Is it because he squeezes things?

1374
01:11:38,280 --> 01:11:39,600
Yes, I'd add.

1375
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:41,800
He kind of yeah, it kind of has creep vibe.

1376
01:11:42,280 --> 01:11:43,200
Yeah. What is it?

1377
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:44,720
What if here's here's a scenario.

1378
01:11:44,720 --> 01:11:46,800
I didn't watch all the Mr. Whipple commercials.

1379
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:49,200
Say there's one where he like grabs a lady's butt.

1380
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:52,080
Now I'm saying I like Mr. Whipple.

1381
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:54,080
There's going to be a whole controversy with podcasts.

1382
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:55,520
The ride. And I don't want that.

1383
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:58,640
I OK. But that's an if I think you got to leave it as an if.

1384
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:01,160
You can't assume that Mr. Whipple did anything bad.

1385
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:02,200
All right. That's fair.

1386
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:04,240
Innocence until proven guilty.

1387
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:06,600
All right. You're right. You're right.

1388
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:09,400
I apologize to Mr. Whipple, the Charmin man.

1389
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:12,240
What's this article on LexisNexis?

1390
01:12:12,240 --> 01:12:15,600
Mr. Whipple defends South African regime.

1391
01:12:16,160 --> 01:12:18,480
Oh, I was right.

1392
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:22,400
I'm seeing some weird polls that at some point in time,

1393
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:26,040
Mr. Whipple was more recognizable to Americans than

1394
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:30,000
than Jimmy Carter during his presidency.

1395
01:12:30,040 --> 01:12:31,200
Really?

1396
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:33,400
And yet we don't know him at all now.

1397
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:36,040
Huh? Interesting.

1398
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:38,400
They never. Yeah, they never recast him, I guess.

1399
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:39,800
They never did a new version.

1400
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:43,720
Or did a scary CGI version or had him dance to the Venga Boys. Right.

1401
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:47,680
All right. Mr. Whipple was for Charmin.

1402
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:50,000
He was replaced by the the toilet bears.

1403
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:53,560
Yes, that's true. He was replaced by the bears. Yes.

1404
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:56,920
I love those bears. Yeah. Love them.

1405
01:12:56,920 --> 01:12:59,960
Yes. OK. Cinnamon Toast Crunch Bakers.

1406
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:01,880
Bob Quello and Wendell.

1407
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:04,440
We never knew the names.

1408
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:06,560
I'm fond of them. I've always liked them.

1409
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:09,360
I was upset when they got rid of all three of them from the box.

1410
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:14,280
So, yes, I like that silence.

1411
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,320
No one would agree with me.

1412
01:13:17,320 --> 01:13:19,760
You weren't greeted with, yeah, yeah, hell, yeah.

1413
01:13:20,680 --> 01:13:22,280
Smoky Man 2.

1414
01:13:22,280 --> 01:13:23,680
I wanted some fist pumping.

1415
01:13:23,680 --> 01:13:25,920
It's interesting. I am sure

1416
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:28,480
if I could hear all the listeners listening to this live,

1417
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:32,080
I would hear a thousand, a few thousand people in silence

1418
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:33,920
after I made that statement.

1419
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:37,640
This one was sad because they got rid of like two of them.

1420
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:40,920
But then Wendell stuck around for a little while.

1421
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,320
Yeah. Wendell was still around.

1422
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:43,400
The other two were gone.

1423
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:45,720
And then I think Wendell is gone now, too.

1424
01:13:45,720 --> 01:13:48,920
I think they're totally gone. Yeah.

1425
01:13:48,920 --> 01:13:51,000
All right. Let me just do a couple more here.

1426
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:54,720
The most interesting man in the world.

1427
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:58,080
He's it feels like such a different category to me.

1428
01:13:58,080 --> 01:13:59,160
Yeah, I guess he is older.

1429
01:13:59,160 --> 01:14:01,600
Old man. Yeah, yeah.

1430
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:04,440
He might be a little he's not 80, but he's definitely up there.

1431
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:06,720
I like him.

1432
01:14:06,720 --> 01:14:09,760
Wait, so we're so and we're still I forgot we're supposed to be comparing to Mr.

1433
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:13,320
Six. I guess I like him.

1434
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:14,680
I don't know.

1435
01:14:14,680 --> 01:14:16,880
I wouldn't want to talk about him for two hours, though.

1436
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:19,840
That's fair. But he's not attached to a theme park.

1437
01:14:20,240 --> 01:14:21,440
Yeah. Yeah.

1438
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:22,640
I don't know. Maybe I do like Mr.

1439
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:25,240
Six more than the most interesting man in the world.

1440
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:26,680
OK.

1441
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:28,920
Jason.

1442
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:31,680
Uh, hmm. Yeah.

1443
01:14:32,840 --> 01:14:35,000
I don't know. I might have to go with Mr. Six on this one.

1444
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:38,200
Wow. The most interesting man in the world lost to Mr.

1445
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:38,960
Six.

1446
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:43,160
All right. Here's the last one.

1447
01:14:43,160 --> 01:14:45,080
A character I was not familiar with.

1448
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:47,760
The mascot of Fritos from like the 60s.

1449
01:14:48,360 --> 01:14:50,280
W.C. Frito.

1450
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:55,480
Whoa. I've seen this one come up.

1451
01:14:56,040 --> 01:14:58,520
He is basically a ripoff of W.C.

1452
01:14:58,520 --> 01:15:02,360
Fields and he promotes Fritos.

1453
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:04,920
Greetings, my little chip.

1454
01:15:04,920 --> 01:15:07,560
But these that's what he says in the picture.

1455
01:15:07,560 --> 01:15:09,760
I just ship for these.

1456
01:15:10,240 --> 01:15:15,720
Yes. And this photo that you sent of him, I think it's just a stain on an old

1457
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:20,360
magazine ad, but it does look like he shit the front of his pants.

1458
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:23,640
Yes, that is true.

1459
01:15:23,640 --> 01:15:25,800
It does look like a giant stain there.

1460
01:15:26,680 --> 01:15:28,920
In which case, I think Mr.

1461
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:31,040
Six for wearing a black clothes.

1462
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:35,520
So even if he is shitting himself in every single ad or appearance, we're none

1463
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:37,320
the wiser. I got to go with Mr.

1464
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:38,200
Six on this one.

1465
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:39,920
Wow. Mr.

1466
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:44,880
Six. I mean, Jason, yes, this one is funny just for like they stole someone's

1467
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:47,440
likeness and probably didn't pay any money.

1468
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:52,600
That was funny. This was funny for that and that they were probably like, oh, God,

1469
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:55,200
we got to get scared Americans.

1470
01:15:55,200 --> 01:15:58,920
They'll never try anything outrageous as corned chips.

1471
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:01,400
Get them something safe in there.

1472
01:16:01,680 --> 01:16:04,120
Let's try and convince them. Put WC Fields in there.

1473
01:16:04,120 --> 01:16:05,120
That'll comfort them.

1474
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:09,840
Between that and Charlie Chipplin.

1475
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:11,640
Oh, yeah, that was.

1476
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:17,080
Yeah, Charlie Chipplin, though, a lot of problematic stuff in his past.

1477
01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:18,200
Oh, true. Yeah.

1478
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:20,640
So he would not have held up.

1479
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:26,040
So, you know, if the listeners are listening and they have you, you have an old

1480
01:16:26,040 --> 01:16:29,600
man mascot character that you think I've left out here that you think is better

1481
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:31,200
than Mr. Six, please tweet at us.

1482
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:34,960
But you think, Mike, I'm sorry, you like all of those more than Mr.

1483
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:36,240
Six? I do. Yes.

1484
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:37,800
Every single one. Yep.

1485
01:16:38,240 --> 01:16:40,680
Hmm. So it's not insane.

1486
01:16:40,680 --> 01:16:41,680
It's not an insane thought.

1487
01:16:41,960 --> 01:16:43,360
I don't hate Mr. Six.

1488
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:45,040
I just he's unpleasant.

1489
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:47,600
Yeah.

1490
01:16:48,240 --> 01:16:51,160
And what do you do if you had to venture a guess what the listeners think?

1491
01:16:51,160 --> 01:16:52,520
Do you think the listeners like Mr.

1492
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:53,520
Six more than they don't?

1493
01:16:54,160 --> 01:16:55,160
I think it's split.

1494
01:16:55,320 --> 01:16:56,440
This one, I think, is split.

1495
01:16:57,040 --> 01:17:00,640
I was I was within 10 percent of my guess about Baby Aladar.

1496
01:17:01,680 --> 01:17:05,840
So I think it's probably, let's say,

1497
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:09,880
45 percent like 55 percent dislike.

1498
01:17:09,880 --> 01:17:10,880
We'll put the poll up.

1499
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:12,440
That's my guess.

1500
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:14,120
Ooh, maybe I'll lay a guess down.

1501
01:17:14,120 --> 01:17:15,480
I actually think it's going to be oddly.

1502
01:17:15,640 --> 01:17:17,720
I think 65 percent like.

1503
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:19,760
I think that's high.

1504
01:17:20,120 --> 01:17:23,040
Yeah, I think this is going to be a divisive one.

1505
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:25,960
I think it's going to get pretty close to even.

1506
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:29,080
But with more people disliking.

1507
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:33,680
The same PR person who you read a quote from earlier

1508
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:36,720
had another kind of highfalutin quote about him.

1509
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:41,400
There are definitely people who are not fans of him, but he has more fans than not.

1510
01:17:41,800 --> 01:17:42,800
Well, we'll find out.

1511
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:46,040
And at a time when there's all sorts of uncertainty,

1512
01:17:46,240 --> 01:17:48,640
people like the familiar and the known.

1513
01:17:50,160 --> 01:17:52,680
So that was said in whatever year that was said.

1514
01:17:52,680 --> 01:17:57,560
And certainly 2020 as we record this, it could not be a more uncertain time.

1515
01:17:57,720 --> 01:18:00,800
So how and everyone's asking, how does Mr.

1516
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:03,840
Six hold up in this even more uncertain of times?

1517
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:05,080
And we'll find out.

1518
01:18:05,560 --> 01:18:07,760
Hi, Mr. Could you imagine Mr.

1519
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:11,280
Six coming like leading

1520
01:18:11,440 --> 01:18:13,120
a new promotional push?

1521
01:18:13,240 --> 01:18:14,680
Six Flags is open.

1522
01:18:15,160 --> 01:18:16,440
They're all open.

1523
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:19,440
But Mr. Six has a mask on.

1524
01:18:19,880 --> 01:18:21,080
That's what America needs.

1525
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:23,320
People get a little lax with the mask usage.

1526
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:25,640
You know, it's time.

1527
01:18:26,040 --> 01:18:28,000
We need heroes wearing the mask.

1528
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:32,200
They need a trusted person saying, yes, is OK.

1529
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:35,080
Mask is good. Mask stops the spread.

1530
01:18:35,480 --> 01:18:38,160
And since they can't be the president,

1531
01:18:38,240 --> 01:18:41,200
who is maybe the only person more divisive than Mr.

1532
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:46,440
Six, we need a leader to show that if you're an elderly man,

1533
01:18:46,920 --> 01:18:48,240
wearing a mask is a good thing.

1534
01:18:48,240 --> 01:18:50,280
It's a strong thing to do. Right.

1535
01:18:50,280 --> 01:18:52,640
The president, of course, said masks are for losers.

1536
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,680
So that's a hill to climb. We have to get over that.

1537
01:18:56,320 --> 01:19:01,200
And what better way is to have a much more energetic older man

1538
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:04,760
show that it's working for him?

1539
01:19:04,760 --> 01:19:06,640
Masks are working for him.

1540
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:10,080
I do think Mr. Six is better favorables than the president.

1541
01:19:10,160 --> 01:19:12,400
I don't think that's in question.

1542
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:15,400
Should we be running him?

1543
01:19:15,400 --> 01:19:18,240
Is he maybe more electable than Biden?

1544
01:19:18,240 --> 01:19:20,080
Couldn't be worse.

1545
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:24,040
So it's a very similar candidate, honestly.

1546
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:28,360
And also, I mean, another good thing is that, you know, like here,

1547
01:19:28,360 --> 01:19:29,760
can somebody is better.

1548
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:32,920
Can you ask a question that might be asked of Biden in a bit?

1549
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,520
As what's the question they would ask Mr. Six in a debate?

1550
01:19:36,160 --> 01:19:38,960
Oh, that's a good political or more about theme parks.

1551
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,200
No political. Oh, OK.

1552
01:19:42,040 --> 01:19:44,640
What do you do to

1553
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:48,600
what do you do as far as health care to expand coverage to more Americans?

1554
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:50,200
Hmm.

1555
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:56,800
And he says he's dancing.

1556
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:57,600
He's dancing.

1557
01:19:57,600 --> 01:19:59,600
Yeah, everyone's loving it.

1558
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:01,400
The live approval ratings.

1559
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:02,680
Yeah, it's way, way, way up.

1560
01:20:02,680 --> 01:20:04,400
Yeah. Trump is angry.

1561
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:08,040
Trump's like down in his fist into his other hand,

1562
01:20:08,240 --> 01:20:10,320
girding his teeth.

1563
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:11,880
He's furious. He's having a heart attack.

1564
01:20:11,880 --> 01:20:13,680
He's he's keeled over.

1565
01:20:13,680 --> 01:20:15,160
Trump is being sent to the hospital.

1566
01:20:15,160 --> 01:20:18,080
That is how thoroughly Mr. Six is beating him in this debate.

1567
01:20:18,240 --> 01:20:21,640
He Trump tries to dance.

1568
01:20:21,640 --> 01:20:24,360
Oh, I want to say, I mean, yeah.

1569
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,600
I think that they should have a dance off to the Venga boys,

1570
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:33,000
and that should be what a debate is.

1571
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:36,560
It is. This is what a debate will be in like 20 years.

1572
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:38,760
But let's just have it happen sooner.

1573
01:20:39,200 --> 01:20:42,640
Two old men dancing.

1574
01:20:42,640 --> 01:20:44,760
And go see.

1575
01:20:44,760 --> 01:20:46,920
That's one of the things I like about Mr. Six.

1576
01:20:46,920 --> 01:20:49,680
Mr. Six moves like a Mr. Show character.

1577
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:54,200
He's like he moves like Choo Choo, the herky jerky dancer.

1578
01:20:54,240 --> 01:20:56,520
Like if you just let him keep going.

1579
01:20:57,440 --> 01:20:59,120
Yeah, that's true.

1580
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:01,160
Do we like the dances that he does?

1581
01:21:01,160 --> 01:21:04,960
That's maybe a good question to ask an hour and 10 in or whatever.

1582
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:07,960
I do. I do.

1583
01:21:07,960 --> 01:21:09,320
But it's a little too much.

1584
01:21:09,320 --> 01:21:11,720
It's a little too.

1585
01:21:11,720 --> 01:21:12,360
It's a little too.

1586
01:21:12,360 --> 01:21:15,640
Like if it was on so you think you could dance, I would.

1587
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:17,640
I think I would critique the dance.

1588
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:20,960
I would say, look, you know, you're you're obviously a talented dancer, Mr.

1589
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:23,360
Six, but you're putting a little.

1590
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:26,040
It's like a little too comedic for my taste in dancing.

1591
01:21:26,040 --> 01:21:27,720
I like a little bit more.

1592
01:21:27,720 --> 01:21:29,200
I like a little more sincerity.

1593
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:34,640
I like a little more sensuality as if it was a video by the group.

1594
01:21:36,040 --> 01:21:39,880
I call 65 or I know if I have

1595
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:41,440
bingo boys were the sexy one, I'm sorry.

1596
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:43,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1597
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:44,440
That's what I would say.

1598
01:21:44,440 --> 01:21:46,000
So I don't dislike the dancing.

1599
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,680
It's just a little too comedic in nature for me.

1600
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:52,840
Too funny.

1601
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:56,040
The problem with Mr. Six is his dances are too funny.

1602
01:21:56,240 --> 01:21:57,200
They're too funny.

1603
01:21:57,200 --> 01:21:59,600
I need a little more serious dancing from them.

1604
01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:02,440
They are funny. They're funny because they're random.

1605
01:22:02,640 --> 01:22:05,680
That's outrageous to see an old man dance that fast.

1606
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:09,120
That's true. I want to see him get it.

1607
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:12,240
You want it to be a motive and move it.

1608
01:22:12,240 --> 01:22:14,600
You want it to be like he should do.

1609
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:18,160
He and Little Six should put on blonde wigs like Sia

1610
01:22:18,320 --> 01:22:21,720
and do the very touching chandelier performance.

1611
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:24,120
I want the chandelier performance.

1612
01:22:24,120 --> 01:22:26,480
I mean, that would that would be great.

1613
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:27,640
Be a lady.

1614
01:22:27,640 --> 01:22:28,840
I want to see.

1615
01:22:28,840 --> 01:22:30,120
I want to see.

1616
01:22:30,120 --> 01:22:33,960
Anyway, I want a lady, an older lady six.

1617
01:22:34,760 --> 01:22:39,360
I want his like wife or girlfriend, and I want them to do them like Magic Mike

1618
01:22:40,040 --> 01:22:44,240
live dance that I saw in Las Vegas, where there's like water

1619
01:22:44,240 --> 01:22:47,120
pouring down from the ceiling and they're sliding around on their knees

1620
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:49,400
and they're like getting into it.

1621
01:22:49,400 --> 01:22:51,600
It was like a beautiful artistic expression.

1622
01:22:51,680 --> 01:22:53,880
Why would you want this all of a sudden?

1623
01:22:53,880 --> 01:22:56,400
This is this is going to get people to a theme park.

1624
01:22:56,560 --> 01:22:58,520
No, that's look, I'm not saying it's for them.

1625
01:22:58,520 --> 01:22:59,960
I'm saying that's for me.

1626
01:22:59,960 --> 01:23:04,360
You want it to be you the person who thinks like a robot

1627
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:06,760
monkey burping is to body.

1628
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:10,560
Suddenly you want a sensual dance

1629
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:14,080
with Mr. Six and a false made up Mrs. Six.

1630
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:15,720
It was not a body dance.

1631
01:23:15,720 --> 01:23:17,520
The dance was artistic.

1632
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:20,840
I'm talking about a specific Magic Mike live Las Vegas show.

1633
01:23:20,840 --> 01:23:23,480
The Lindsay and I saw it's a specific type of dance.

1634
01:23:23,480 --> 01:23:25,400
Yes. Is it maybe not for children?

1635
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:31,120
Of course. But it's not that body Vanga boys video with CGI butts.

1636
01:23:31,480 --> 01:23:34,360
This is a this is pure human expression.

1637
01:23:36,640 --> 01:23:37,720
Uh huh.

1638
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:41,160
So now Mr.

1639
01:23:41,160 --> 01:23:44,840
Six needs to be doing it with his elderly wife.

1640
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:48,200
I don't I don't want him to do the exact same dance.

1641
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:51,920
I'm just saying that that's more what I like in dancing.

1642
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:54,160
The question was, do we like his dancing?

1643
01:23:54,160 --> 01:23:55,480
That's all I'm saying.

1644
01:23:55,480 --> 01:23:58,640
I'm not going to maybe propose that at the next Six Flags board meeting.

1645
01:23:58,640 --> 01:24:02,680
But I'm just saying this is the dancing I prefer.

1646
01:24:04,040 --> 01:24:07,560
Can you find a video of the dance that you saw?

1647
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:08,040
I absolutely can.

1648
01:24:08,040 --> 01:24:11,640
Can we somehow superimpose Mr.

1649
01:24:11,640 --> 01:24:13,640
Six's face onto it?

1650
01:24:13,640 --> 01:24:15,880
And that will be the judge.

1651
01:24:15,880 --> 01:24:17,440
Yes, I there's a lot.

1652
01:24:17,440 --> 01:24:19,520
I actually have seen there's a couple of YouTube videos of people

1653
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:23,520
that have already done this for other commercials and superimposed Mr.

1654
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:25,520
Six's face.

1655
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:27,600
I'm going to find the dance I'm talking about.

1656
01:24:28,280 --> 01:24:29,080
I want Mr.

1657
01:24:29,080 --> 01:24:35,320
Six to dance with the vacuum cleaner like the is that Fred Astaire or Gene Kelly?

1658
01:24:37,640 --> 01:24:39,240
In those commercials, remember?

1659
01:24:39,240 --> 01:24:41,280
Oh, right, right, right.

1660
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:43,960
I have Fred Astaire, I think, but I could be wrong.

1661
01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:48,200
Yeah. You wanted him to be like in every ad, like earnest.

1662
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:50,840
That would be good.

1663
01:24:50,840 --> 01:24:52,080
I think for the real Mr.

1664
01:24:52,080 --> 01:24:53,880
Six has a little video with Mr.

1665
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:58,840
Six dancing with Danny Tieson, the performer who was under the makeup.

1666
01:24:59,960 --> 01:25:01,800
OK, so let's talk about this.

1667
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:05,000
Yes. And probably if you're if you're sitting still somewhere,

1668
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:06,920
you should go look out, just type in Mr.

1669
01:25:06,920 --> 01:25:12,760
Six Danny Tieson and prepare to have your mind blown.

1670
01:25:12,760 --> 01:25:14,560
Because, Mr.

1671
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:15,920
Who is in Mr. Six?

1672
01:25:15,920 --> 01:25:20,360
Is it like a weird child or a secret celebrity or something?

1673
01:25:20,360 --> 01:25:25,920
No, it's this like kind of just well built, good looking British guy.

1674
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:29,920
All right. I'm watching the video of the dance I'm talking about,

1675
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:32,000
and it is too sexy for Mr.

1676
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:35,720
Six. Oh, yeah.

1677
01:25:35,960 --> 01:25:36,960
You think so? Good.

1678
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:41,400
It's still a very good dance and very impressive because there's a lot of water going on.

1679
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:43,400
But it is like he can't.

1680
01:25:43,440 --> 01:25:46,000
It's called live sexy water dance.

1681
01:25:46,040 --> 01:25:49,680
Yeah, I knew it was sexy, but it's a little too much for Mr.

1682
01:25:49,680 --> 01:25:52,680
Six. This is going to ruin the makeup.

1683
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:55,560
First things first. Yeah, that's fair. That's fair.

1684
01:25:56,600 --> 01:25:58,200
There's too much like clothing removed.

1685
01:25:58,200 --> 01:25:59,640
There's no way we could do it, Mr. Six.

1686
01:25:59,640 --> 01:26:04,200
I'm just saying I was impressed with the the technicality of this,

1687
01:26:04,200 --> 01:26:06,800
the ability of the dancers, because it's like insane.

1688
01:26:07,160 --> 01:26:11,840
I'm just still confused because your glasses fog when there's like a May

1689
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:15,800
West joke, you know, show with animatronic critters.

1690
01:26:16,120 --> 01:26:19,120
And now you're telling me you love the sexy water dance.

1691
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:21,520
Look, it's buried somewhere in this brain.

1692
01:26:22,760 --> 01:26:24,920
Once in a while, it has to come out.

1693
01:26:24,920 --> 01:26:27,720
So I guess it came out at the Magic Mike show in Las Vegas

1694
01:26:28,280 --> 01:26:30,200
during the couple's dance in the water.

1695
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:32,200
That's all that's all I can say.

1696
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:36,440
That's why somewhere and it happens once every year.

1697
01:26:36,440 --> 01:26:40,000
It's like Ponfar with Spock on the on Star Trek every seven years.

1698
01:26:40,080 --> 01:26:42,080
I'm a little bit emergent.

1699
01:26:42,080 --> 01:26:44,440
I've moved by some sort of sexuality. Yes.

1700
01:26:46,440 --> 01:26:47,440
Oh, boy.

1701
01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:49,680
And it just happened to coincide with our Las Vegas trip.

1702
01:26:49,680 --> 01:26:52,840
Last year, when we saw the Eminem show and Magic Mike live

1703
01:26:52,840 --> 01:26:55,240
and David Copperfield with Blue 32.

1704
01:26:55,640 --> 01:26:56,640
Whoa, whoa.

1705
01:26:57,640 --> 01:27:00,160
That's a vacation you need a vacation from.

1706
01:27:00,160 --> 01:27:04,840
Yeah, it's confusing that I for 65 did the song blue

1707
01:27:04,840 --> 01:27:07,200
and then we're obsessed with blue 32.

1708
01:27:07,680 --> 01:27:08,800
Yeah, that is a good point.

1709
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:09,840
Yeah, that is a good point.

1710
01:27:09,840 --> 01:27:12,240
And then we couldn't figure out if it was a rule 34.

1711
01:27:14,240 --> 01:27:16,240
A lot to keep straight in this episode.

1712
01:27:16,240 --> 01:27:19,600
Rule 32 should be a different blue 32 based search.

1713
01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:21,720
Oh, no. OK, yes.

1714
01:27:21,720 --> 01:27:24,840
If if that rule is if David

1715
01:27:24,920 --> 01:27:29,640
Copperfield has an animatronic alien in a show,

1716
01:27:29,640 --> 01:27:32,800
there has to be porn of it. Yes.

1717
01:27:32,920 --> 01:27:37,200
Then every every every artist and listener to the show needs to make porn of it.

1718
01:27:37,960 --> 01:27:40,480
Yeah. Blue 32 wears a mask.

1719
01:27:40,480 --> 01:27:43,800
We've seen blue 32 in a mask. So. Oh, they did do that.

1720
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:46,600
Yes, he did put a mask on him on Instagram or something.

1721
01:27:46,640 --> 01:27:47,760
Yeah, that's true.

1722
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:52,600
Hmm. Oh, we bet Danny Tieson just to just to say it.

1723
01:27:53,480 --> 01:27:55,440
It's I don't know what else to say about this.

1724
01:27:55,440 --> 01:27:57,280
It's just bizarre.

1725
01:27:58,040 --> 01:28:01,440
I I don't know.

1726
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:04,600
He's maybe I have no thoughts about this.

1727
01:28:05,160 --> 01:28:07,720
Yeah, it's interesting, I guess.

1728
01:28:07,720 --> 01:28:09,720
But then that's kind of the end of that fact.

1729
01:28:09,720 --> 01:28:11,560
All right. So as a guy. All right.

1730
01:28:11,560 --> 01:28:17,760
Yeah. On on IMDb, I'm seeing that he is Judd Apatow's best film yet.

1731
01:28:17,800 --> 01:28:20,640
Oh, no. Sorry. That's just one of three King of Staten Island ads.

1732
01:28:22,440 --> 01:28:24,760
Oh, let's see. No, he just works a lot.

1733
01:28:25,640 --> 01:28:27,480
Hey, yeah, him. Great. Yes.

1734
01:28:27,480 --> 01:28:30,520
He works. We worked with the Kylie Minogue and

1735
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:33,360
Tom Jones.

1736
01:28:33,360 --> 01:28:37,080
I hope I hope for his sake, this character comes back so we can get more money

1737
01:28:37,080 --> 01:28:39,760
to get some more paydays here from the Six Flags Corporation.

1738
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:42,960
Yeah. How did this start again?

1739
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:44,280
I think he just got cast.

1740
01:28:44,280 --> 01:28:47,800
I he talked about I saw like a quote from him that he was like,

1741
01:28:47,800 --> 01:28:49,640
yeah, it was like a secret identity for a little.

1742
01:28:49,640 --> 01:28:51,080
No one knew I was doing it.

1743
01:28:51,080 --> 01:28:54,280
Like and yet people thought it was a kid or an old person or what?

1744
01:28:55,520 --> 01:28:58,760
Maybe the maybe they should expand the six universe

1745
01:28:58,760 --> 01:29:02,800
and have like a lot of different sixes, the whole family,

1746
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:05,040
like a whole like 10 person six family.

1747
01:29:06,120 --> 01:29:08,560
And then we could get in the mix for auditioning for these.

1748
01:29:08,560 --> 01:29:09,960
That's really where I'm going with this.

1749
01:29:12,240 --> 01:29:14,880
I could be his son. I could be his adult son.

1750
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:17,760
Well, where does that leave me and Jason?

1751
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:20,800
You could be his other adult son.

1752
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:24,080
Three. You got three sons each.

1753
01:29:26,240 --> 01:29:28,200
It was one single dad with three sons.

1754
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:32,040
So we're all his sons will all be his sons.

1755
01:29:33,120 --> 01:29:35,640
And then we have each we each have three children.

1756
01:29:36,720 --> 01:29:38,200
But do we all look like Mr.

1757
01:29:38,200 --> 01:29:40,120
Seryi, do we look like old bald men?

1758
01:29:40,640 --> 01:29:44,960
We do, but we look like a little there's like slightly less wrinkles. OK.

1759
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:48,240
So and maybe we have hair, maybe it's sort of the same face,

1760
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:51,640
little less wrinkles, and we have varying amounts of hair.

1761
01:29:52,240 --> 01:29:55,840
And do we get to leave before he does a sexy dance with our mom?

1762
01:29:57,400 --> 01:30:01,040
No, we have to stand around and watch and support her.

1763
01:30:01,440 --> 01:30:03,760
And cheer. The dance is just the usual dance.

1764
01:30:04,960 --> 01:30:08,320
But it's in water and they still take their clothes off. Yeah.

1765
01:30:12,120 --> 01:30:14,640
Yeah. So that's yeah, that's all part of it.

1766
01:30:16,360 --> 01:30:17,680
But it's a giant family.

1767
01:30:17,680 --> 01:30:20,160
It's a Brady Bunch size family.

1768
01:30:20,160 --> 01:30:22,480
A dog. Oh, yeah.

1769
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:24,680
Doggy six. Mm hmm.

1770
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:27,920
Mostly hairless.

1771
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:30,120
I mean, Chihuahua.

1772
01:30:30,120 --> 01:30:32,200
Yeah, just as wrinkly as Mr. Six.

1773
01:30:32,200 --> 01:30:32,920
Yeah, yeah.

1774
01:30:32,920 --> 01:30:34,520
Same big glasses.

1775
01:30:34,520 --> 01:30:35,960
No time. Yep.

1776
01:30:35,960 --> 01:30:38,400
Doggy six. Doggy six.

1777
01:30:38,960 --> 01:30:40,760
Michael six. Jason six.

1778
01:30:40,760 --> 01:30:42,880
Scott six. Great.

1779
01:30:45,640 --> 01:30:47,200
Fan art, please.

1780
01:30:47,200 --> 01:30:48,880
Fan art, please.

1781
01:30:48,880 --> 01:30:53,080
Um, so, uh, now do we

1782
01:30:53,080 --> 01:30:56,640
should we talk about that he went away and why he went away?

1783
01:30:56,960 --> 01:30:59,520
Yeah, yeah, we should do that.

1784
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:05,560
Um, I OK, so he's with 2004 to what?

1785
01:31:05,560 --> 01:31:08,640
2005. This wasn't that long, actually, all told.

1786
01:31:08,840 --> 01:31:13,640
But it seems like within like an 18 month span, he blew up so big.

1787
01:31:14,840 --> 01:31:15,800
They are using him.

1788
01:31:15,800 --> 01:31:19,840
I don't know if he blew up with the audience, but they're using him a lot.

1789
01:31:19,840 --> 01:31:21,600
He is. He is completely the face.

1790
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:23,360
I remember seeing him on.

1791
01:31:23,360 --> 01:31:25,560
They must have used him on Coke cans and stuff, right?

1792
01:31:25,560 --> 01:31:26,560
With tie ins.

1793
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:29,080
You definitely would see Mr. Six outside of six bags.

1794
01:31:29,680 --> 01:31:30,600
Right. Yeah, yeah.

1795
01:31:30,600 --> 01:31:32,720
I think for sure he was everywhere.

1796
01:31:32,720 --> 01:31:35,000
Yeah. Good morning, America, I think.

1797
01:31:35,200 --> 01:31:37,520
Really? Yeah.

1798
01:31:37,520 --> 01:31:40,080
Like as a sit down guest or did he just do a dance?

1799
01:31:40,880 --> 01:31:43,000
I'm sure he just did the dance.

1800
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:44,840
Maybe he taught them the dance.

1801
01:31:44,840 --> 01:31:47,240
Yeah, because he wasn't talking back then.

1802
01:31:47,240 --> 01:31:49,520
Yeah, yeah.

1803
01:31:49,520 --> 01:31:54,600
So but I guess, as we've said, he was always rather divisive.

1804
01:31:55,040 --> 01:32:00,560
And and then there was a change in management at Six Flags,

1805
01:32:00,760 --> 01:32:04,760
which started the domino effect of him going away.

1806
01:32:05,240 --> 01:32:10,640
There was a guy came on the board of Six Flags named Daniel Snyder.

1807
01:32:11,040 --> 01:32:14,680
Daniel Snyder to this day is the owner of the Washington Redskins.

1808
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
And one of the worst people in America.

1809
01:32:18,720 --> 01:32:20,560
That's that's that's about right.

1810
01:32:20,560 --> 01:32:23,800
Yes. He he's he took over.

1811
01:32:23,960 --> 01:32:26,320
He got on the board, got like a 15 percent share

1812
01:32:26,480 --> 01:32:28,840
and then started fighting with the rest of the board,

1813
01:32:29,600 --> 01:32:32,320
you know, criticizing them for all manner of things.

1814
01:32:32,320 --> 01:32:35,720
And eventually, essentially led a coup that put him

1815
01:32:35,920 --> 01:32:39,520
and another guy named Mark Shapiro in charge of Six Flags.

1816
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:46,440
So he he on November 29th, 2005, took over as the full owner

1817
01:32:46,680 --> 01:32:48,160
of the Six Flags parks.

1818
01:32:48,160 --> 01:32:52,640
The next day, the very first thing he did was retire.

1819
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:57,760
The Mr. Six campaign, because if there's anyone who knows

1820
01:32:57,760 --> 01:33:00,800
exactly when to retire a divisive mascot,

1821
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:03,800
it's the owner of the Washington Redskins.

1822
01:33:06,360 --> 01:33:07,800
But he couldn't wait.

1823
01:33:07,800 --> 01:33:10,760
We have to do he called the campaign pointless.

1824
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:11,960
He went away.

1825
01:33:11,960 --> 01:33:15,000
The it's playtime motto went away.

1826
01:33:15,480 --> 01:33:21,640
And they replaced it with a much catchier, friendly, clean, fast, safe service.

1827
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:24,320
You kept thinking it was going to be done. It wasn't done.

1828
01:33:24,320 --> 01:33:26,000
That's too many words.

1829
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
That's the third five.

1830
01:33:29,640 --> 01:33:34,080
Yeah, that wasn't it's dog shit like that ad campaign is just all.

1831
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:36,640
It's nothing like that's terrible.

1832
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:38,640
Yeah, yeah.

1833
01:33:38,640 --> 01:33:43,360
Now, to Jason's point, one of the worst people in America, Jason,

1834
01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:45,720
I don't know if either of you, I don't know if you guys looked further

1835
01:33:45,720 --> 01:33:51,600
into Daniel Snyder, but if if if you did throw in anything else,

1836
01:33:51,920 --> 01:33:57,120
you learned, but otherwise just sit back and prepare for me to pummel you with evil.

1837
01:33:57,120 --> 01:34:00,040
Oh, all right. Hit us. Hit us.

1838
01:34:00,040 --> 01:34:02,440
This guy. OK.

1839
01:34:02,440 --> 01:34:06,360
So just, you know, outside of the of the Six Flags thing,

1840
01:34:07,960 --> 01:34:11,280
owner of the Washington Redskins steadfastly refuses to change the name.

1841
01:34:11,280 --> 01:34:13,720
We cannot. He said a couple of years ago, put it in all caps.

1842
01:34:13,720 --> 01:34:14,760
I want you to put it in all caps.

1843
01:34:14,760 --> 01:34:16,880
We will never get rid of the name.

1844
01:34:16,880 --> 01:34:20,000
He would not sign Colin Kaepernick, even though they needed his

1845
01:34:20,600 --> 01:34:21,440
quarterback. I don't know.

1846
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:23,400
They needed they needed somebody good.

1847
01:34:23,400 --> 01:34:25,880
He was available and they wouldn't sign him.

1848
01:34:26,440 --> 01:34:30,680
He owns a yacht with an IMAX theater, not just a movie theater,

1849
01:34:30,680 --> 01:34:33,440
but an IMAX theater.

1850
01:34:33,440 --> 01:34:37,800
He gave one point one million dollars, not just to Donald Trump,

1851
01:34:37,800 --> 01:34:40,640
but to specifically Trump's inauguration.

1852
01:34:42,720 --> 01:34:44,920
Make sure it's to the inauguration.

1853
01:34:45,800 --> 01:34:49,520
So I hope three doors down was worth one point one million

1854
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:53,120
of your personal dollars.

1855
01:34:53,120 --> 01:34:56,600
When the recession hit in 2008, 2009,

1856
01:34:57,240 --> 01:35:01,040
he oversaw a campaign to sue season ticket holders

1857
01:35:01,040 --> 01:35:04,160
who were unable to pay for their season tickets,

1858
01:35:04,600 --> 01:35:07,040
including a 75 year old grandma.

1859
01:35:07,360 --> 01:35:09,520
So right there, he hates old people.

1860
01:35:09,520 --> 01:35:11,560
That's what he hates, Mr. Six.

1861
01:35:11,560 --> 01:35:15,480
He sues Redskins fans who are elderly.

1862
01:35:16,600 --> 01:35:19,000
The bad guy.

1863
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:22,720
He OK, there was this weird story where

1864
01:35:23,800 --> 01:35:28,960
he had a house with a slight view of the Potomac River in Washington,

1865
01:35:29,080 --> 01:35:30,240
but he wanted a better view.

1866
01:35:30,240 --> 01:35:33,320
So he worked with a crooked National Park Service official

1867
01:35:33,440 --> 01:35:38,040
to cut down 130 trees to improve his river view.

1868
01:35:38,200 --> 01:35:39,880
Oh, my God.

1869
01:35:39,880 --> 01:35:43,680
Yes. I think if any listener who knows the Redskins or follows

1870
01:35:43,680 --> 01:35:46,560
well, probably knows about this guy and what a mega piece of shit he is.

1871
01:35:46,560 --> 01:35:47,880
But it's all new to me.

1872
01:35:47,880 --> 01:35:52,920
That official who he worked with stepped down from the National Park Service

1873
01:35:53,280 --> 01:35:57,600
in 2015, he retired, but was brought back all of a sudden

1874
01:35:57,680 --> 01:36:02,360
to run our national parks by President Donald J. Trump.

1875
01:36:03,320 --> 01:36:07,600
Wow. The web of evil that this enemy of Mr.

1876
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:10,400
Six is tangled up in is amazing.

1877
01:36:10,760 --> 01:36:12,800
And let me add one more to it.

1878
01:36:13,480 --> 01:36:17,080
As I said, his day two of owning Six Flags,

1879
01:36:17,080 --> 01:36:19,640
the first thing he does, get rid of Mr.

1880
01:36:19,640 --> 01:36:21,040
Six, we got to get rid of Mr. Six.

1881
01:36:21,040 --> 01:36:24,840
Two weeks later, he decides to bring a buddy of his

1882
01:36:24,840 --> 01:36:27,720
onto the board of directors of Six Flags.

1883
01:36:27,920 --> 01:36:30,880
His old pal, Harvey Weinstein.

1884
01:36:30,920 --> 01:36:33,360
Oh, my God.

1885
01:36:34,280 --> 01:36:38,680
With the justification that why, by partnering with a Hollywood

1886
01:36:38,680 --> 01:36:43,400
titan like Harvey, now we can instead of, you know, Mr.

1887
01:36:43,400 --> 01:36:46,680
Six in the coasters, all we're doing is appealing to teenagers.

1888
01:36:46,680 --> 01:36:48,560
We need to get families into the park.

1889
01:36:48,560 --> 01:36:53,120
So now we can bring in kids with kid friendly characters

1890
01:36:53,120 --> 01:36:55,440
like from Weinstein's film Hoodwinked.

1891
01:36:58,280 --> 01:37:02,120
This is a real thing from an article he thought we're going to.

1892
01:37:02,160 --> 01:37:06,480
We have to. We have to give money to Harvey Weinstein for nothing

1893
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:10,400
so that we can license the all important hoodwinked characters.

1894
01:37:11,120 --> 01:37:13,880
Wow. Wow. Can you guys tell me?

1895
01:37:14,680 --> 01:37:18,120
Yeah. Well, and and well, and sadly, it's not even quite done.

1896
01:37:18,120 --> 01:37:22,320
But just before that, can you guys name any fact about Hoodwinked?

1897
01:37:22,320 --> 01:37:25,160
Any any thing? This was in 2005.

1898
01:37:25,640 --> 01:37:26,720
15 years down the line.

1899
01:37:26,720 --> 01:37:28,840
Can you say anything about Hoodwinked? I cannot.

1900
01:37:29,320 --> 01:37:30,960
OK, I think.

1901
01:37:32,880 --> 01:37:36,920
With the presence of Hood, it's a

1902
01:37:37,800 --> 01:37:40,920
like little red riding hood riff,

1903
01:37:41,320 --> 01:37:43,600
but it's right after Shrek.

1904
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:46,360
So it's all the characters

1905
01:37:46,840 --> 01:37:50,520
probably talking about how something is not even a thing.

1906
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,800
We're doing things that are funny because they're random.

1907
01:37:53,800 --> 01:37:56,080
Is that right? But there's other fairy tale people.

1908
01:37:56,120 --> 01:37:57,720
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, you know that.

1909
01:37:57,720 --> 01:37:59,800
Yes. A deconstructionist little red riding hood.

1910
01:37:59,800 --> 01:38:02,520
I don't know about the pop culture reference of it all, but I

1911
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:08,960
I did look up that there is a a bear police officer played by exhibit.

1912
01:38:09,720 --> 01:38:10,880
Hmm. I do like that.

1913
01:38:10,880 --> 01:38:12,280
I like the sound of that.

1914
01:38:12,280 --> 01:38:14,720
Yeah, I kind of do, too. Yeah.

1915
01:38:14,720 --> 01:38:17,160
Just wish you could put in a better movie.

1916
01:38:18,640 --> 01:38:19,840
But there are not.

1917
01:38:19,840 --> 01:38:23,400
Oh, I was thinking I was like, aren't there gnomes who fall in love?

1918
01:38:23,400 --> 01:38:25,560
And I'm realizing that is no me.

1919
01:38:25,560 --> 01:38:28,720
Oh, and Juliette, correct? Correct.

1920
01:38:29,080 --> 01:38:32,560
When I was explaining all this to Erin, I asked her the same question.

1921
01:38:32,560 --> 01:38:34,040
Can you tell me anything about Hoodwinked?

1922
01:38:34,040 --> 01:38:35,240
And she was like,

1923
01:38:36,120 --> 01:38:38,080
is it the one like with mooses?

1924
01:38:38,080 --> 01:38:40,520
And I said, no, that's open season.

1925
01:38:41,320 --> 01:38:44,600
OK, is it the one with like animals who are in the trash

1926
01:38:44,760 --> 01:38:46,440
that they want to be in a nice house?

1927
01:38:46,440 --> 01:38:48,600
And I said, no, that's over the hedge.

1928
01:38:50,160 --> 01:38:52,200
It is this is

1929
01:38:52,920 --> 01:38:55,240
it's pretty impossible to tell any of these apart.

1930
01:38:56,040 --> 01:39:00,400
Wow. Yeah, I know. I had no I didn't I could I'm not a single guess.

1931
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:05,080
Anyway, the the I mean, literally, there's been full articles like

1932
01:39:05,080 --> 01:39:09,920
here's the 16 shittiest things Dan Snyder has done while owning things.

1933
01:39:10,920 --> 01:39:13,920
One of the crazier ones while he owned Six Flags is that

1934
01:39:14,320 --> 01:39:18,880
he did a tie in with some mattress company so that for a little while,

1935
01:39:19,360 --> 01:39:24,800
Six Flags Great Escape in New York was selling mattresses in the theme park.

1936
01:39:25,320 --> 01:39:26,400
What?

1937
01:39:26,720 --> 01:39:30,360
Because of some deal he made, he did the same thing with the Redskins,

1938
01:39:30,360 --> 01:39:32,760
like by the official Redskins mattress.

1939
01:39:32,960 --> 01:39:37,680
And fans are walking by stores in the stadium like why are there mattresses here?

1940
01:39:37,880 --> 01:39:39,800
And then it happened in Six Flags, too.

1941
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:43,240
And the mattresses cost thirteen hundred dollars.

1942
01:39:43,440 --> 01:39:44,600
Oh, my God.

1943
01:39:44,800 --> 01:39:46,720
Who would why would you be in a theme park?

1944
01:39:46,920 --> 01:39:49,280
I mean, I guess I know they'll deliver it to you.

1945
01:39:49,480 --> 01:39:51,320
But what would ever make you think?

1946
01:39:51,520 --> 01:39:52,960
I better buy a

1947
01:39:53,920 --> 01:39:58,560
mattress, especially if it says Six Flags really big on it or well, I guess not.

1948
01:39:58,760 --> 01:40:00,640
This is where he fucked up because he got rid of Mr.

1949
01:40:00,840 --> 01:40:02,360
Six and if it just had Mr.

1950
01:40:02,560 --> 01:40:05,840
Six's face really big, everyone would buy it.

1951
01:40:06,040 --> 01:40:08,960
Well, now, yeah, that I would buy an ARP.

1952
01:40:09,160 --> 01:40:11,160
This guy is going to have to inhabit

1953
01:40:11,160 --> 01:40:13,360
the sector keeper and we're going to have to fight him.

1954
01:40:13,560 --> 01:40:15,160
Like that seems like

1955
01:40:15,920 --> 01:40:18,920
he is completely in league with those people.

1956
01:40:19,120 --> 01:40:20,520
I know he's going to have to fight him.

1957
01:40:20,680 --> 01:40:22,680
Going in league with those people.

1958
01:40:22,680 --> 01:40:27,440
I know we had fights with people who once we decided that they were villains and then

1959
01:40:27,440 --> 01:40:29,640
we looked into them and it turned out they were like fine.

1960
01:40:29,840 --> 01:40:31,000
Yeah.

1961
01:40:31,200 --> 01:40:34,000
Meanwhile, leaving Daniel Snyder,

1962
01:40:34,200 --> 01:40:38,840
Daniel Snyder, who, by the way, is not Daniel Snyder, the Nickelodeon producer,

1963
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:42,280
who's perhaps an even more evil person than Daniel Snyder.

1964
01:40:42,480 --> 01:40:45,400
Yeah. Just do a quick Google on that.

1965
01:40:45,600 --> 01:40:47,960
One of them should be just locked up on

1966
01:40:47,960 --> 01:40:53,560
general principle and the other should be locked up for everything they did.

1967
01:40:53,760 --> 01:40:55,880
Allegedly.

1968
01:40:58,440 --> 01:41:00,280
Sure, if you want to just Google.

1969
01:41:00,480 --> 01:41:01,440
Yeah.

1970
01:41:01,640 --> 01:41:03,640
OK, so

1971
01:41:03,920 --> 01:41:06,680
sorry, I'll make this part quick.

1972
01:41:06,880 --> 01:41:08,520
I'm reading about all this,

1973
01:41:08,720 --> 01:41:13,160
all this just to say this is the kind of person who opposes Mr.

1974
01:41:13,360 --> 01:41:17,000
Six and if I at one point in my life was someone who opposed Mr.

1975
01:41:17,040 --> 01:41:20,240
Six, do I want to be on the side of this motherfucker?

1976
01:41:20,440 --> 01:41:25,400
This guy is like destroying a forest to have a nicer view and hanging out with Trump

1977
01:41:25,600 --> 01:41:28,400
and Weinstein, a bunch of bulls.

1978
01:41:28,600 --> 01:41:32,400
He's also just continues to I think everyone's unhappy with his ownership of

1979
01:41:32,600 --> 01:41:36,080
the Redskins and he absolutely bungled Six Flags.

1980
01:41:36,280 --> 01:41:40,240
He only owned it for four years, in which time that was enough time for them to get

1981
01:41:40,440 --> 01:41:42,280
to Chapter 11.

1982
01:41:42,680 --> 01:41:46,240
Somehow Bill Gates was an investor in all this and he personally lost

1983
01:41:46,240 --> 01:41:50,040
one hundred and twenty two million dollars

1984
01:41:50,240 --> 01:41:53,600
because of Daniel Snyder, who lost his entire investment.

1985
01:41:53,800 --> 01:41:55,960
It was all blown. So he fucked up.

1986
01:41:56,160 --> 01:41:59,320
And then I'm reading an article like he got kicked out, as did the guy he installed

1987
01:41:59,520 --> 01:42:00,880
as president, Mark Shapiro.

1988
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,200
I thought I was done with the evil pummeling.

1989
01:42:03,400 --> 01:42:08,480
Mark Shapiro, who was for this amount of time, was the president of Six Flags,

1990
01:42:08,680 --> 01:42:11,800
who first of all, before I read you all this, here's what he thinks of Mr.

1991
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,160
Six. Well, we have to meet with the ad

1992
01:42:14,840 --> 01:42:16,800
company and evaluate where we are.

1993
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:18,440
The thing is, I don't know what Mr.

1994
01:42:18,640 --> 01:42:21,240
Six stands for. How does he represent the company?

1995
01:42:21,440 --> 01:42:23,320
What does he signify for our guests?

1996
01:42:23,520 --> 01:42:25,040
He's not selling an experience.

1997
01:42:25,240 --> 01:42:29,560
He's a gimmick. And I don't think a gimmick is the right way to sell Six Flags.

1998
01:42:29,760 --> 01:42:31,560
So fighting words.

1999
01:42:31,760 --> 01:42:35,680
Now, let me tell you, this guy is currently the president of Endeavor.

2000
01:42:35,880 --> 01:42:40,400
And if you pay attention to any Hollywood stuff, you'll know that Endeavor is the one

2001
01:42:40,600 --> 01:42:43,880
of the big four agencies that is careening towards bankruptcy.

2002
01:42:44,040 --> 01:42:46,160
They're like absolutely fucked.

2003
01:42:46,360 --> 01:42:49,000
He did cut his salary in half to help everybody.

2004
01:42:49,200 --> 01:42:53,680
So now he only makes one point five million dollars a year.

2005
01:42:53,880 --> 01:43:00,200
And from one of his jobs, the others being he's on the board of Live Nation,

2006
01:43:00,400 --> 01:43:06,480
Papa John's, uh, and a company called Equity Residential,

2007
01:43:06,680 --> 01:43:10,800
which is the top contributor to a pack that right now, as we speak, at the height

2008
01:43:10,800 --> 01:43:14,560
of the covid crisis is fighting housing affordability.

2009
01:43:14,760 --> 01:43:19,080
They gave so that he's on the board of a company that gave three million dollars

2010
01:43:19,280 --> 01:43:23,760
in rent money to fight rent being more affordable.

2011
01:43:23,960 --> 01:43:25,360
Um,

2012
01:43:26,240 --> 01:43:32,680
one more, um, you remember when Papa John said there was a day of reckoning coming

2013
01:43:32,880 --> 01:43:36,960
when he gave that weird, sweaty interview and said there will be a day of reckoning.

2014
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:39,720
It's all going to come out in that very same interview.

2015
01:43:39,720 --> 01:43:43,440
He said Mark Shapiro is a sex creep and should be in jail.

2016
01:43:43,640 --> 01:43:45,320
What?

2017
01:43:46,120 --> 01:43:49,720
Papa, he this the people who don't like Mr.

2018
01:43:49,920 --> 01:43:54,080
Six are so bad that Papa John thinks they're pieces of shit.

2019
01:43:54,280 --> 01:43:57,440
Is this the weirdest episode we've ever done?

2020
01:43:58,240 --> 01:44:00,960
We might have just between all of we all

2021
01:44:01,160 --> 01:44:04,040
just live watched digital butts in a Venga boys video.

2022
01:44:04,240 --> 01:44:07,680
And now I'm learning about Papa John's enemies.

2023
01:44:07,840 --> 01:44:10,280
I truly feel crazy right now.

2024
01:44:10,480 --> 01:44:11,720
Yeah, exactly.

2025
01:44:11,920 --> 01:44:13,800
We haven't read all of it. I am exhausted.

2026
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:17,280
So just let me let me just add up a couple of bullet points.

2027
01:44:17,480 --> 01:44:21,720
If the people who we the very first thing we must do is get rid of Mr.

2028
01:44:21,720 --> 01:44:24,520
Six, these are people that are good friends of Trump and Weinstein.

2029
01:44:24,720 --> 01:44:25,840
They've they're so creepy.

2030
01:44:26,040 --> 01:44:28,320
They've made enemies of Papa John.

2031
01:44:28,520 --> 01:44:35,360
They're currently on the wrong side of like the of housing affordability and

2032
01:44:35,520 --> 01:44:41,160
this racist mascot, they're like current villains who ran six legs into the ground

2033
01:44:41,360 --> 01:44:44,280
and yet are still like running the world.

2034
01:44:44,480 --> 01:44:46,480
These people are absolute pieces of shit.

2035
01:44:46,680 --> 01:44:48,160
And to stand against Mr.

2036
01:44:48,360 --> 01:44:49,640
Six is to stand with them.

2037
01:44:49,840 --> 01:44:50,960
I stand with Mr.

2038
01:44:51,160 --> 01:44:52,200
Six.

2039
01:44:52,400 --> 01:44:55,440
Well, now it's a political statement to like Mr.

2040
01:44:55,640 --> 01:44:58,200
Six and we have to stand up and say we love Mr.

2041
01:44:58,400 --> 01:45:00,320
Six. There's no other way.

2042
01:45:00,360 --> 01:45:01,760
There's no other way to be.

2043
01:45:01,960 --> 01:45:04,680
There's you're with him or you're against him.

2044
01:45:04,920 --> 01:45:13,280
Mr. Six lay low right now, but I believe will emerge one day soon to remind us

2045
01:45:13,480 --> 01:45:18,840
that it's not only playtime, but more flags equals more fun and potentially

2046
01:45:19,040 --> 01:45:21,240
also more rampant corruption.

2047
01:45:21,440 --> 01:45:22,840
But

2048
01:45:23,200 --> 01:45:27,440
I mean, who do you think fed all these leads to the press?

2049
01:45:27,640 --> 01:45:32,960
Maybe someone close, maybe an older, respectable man, well-dressed man.

2050
01:45:33,120 --> 01:45:35,240
You're saying he was a deep throat.

2051
01:45:35,440 --> 01:45:36,840
I'm saying Mr.

2052
01:45:37,040 --> 01:45:42,080
Six may be the mole, maybe like taking it down from the inside.

2053
01:45:42,280 --> 01:45:43,200
Wow. Damn.

2054
01:45:43,400 --> 01:45:45,960
Damn. Yeah. These bastards came in, fired him.

2055
01:45:46,160 --> 01:45:48,560
He didn't just dance away.

2056
01:45:48,760 --> 01:45:52,200
He fought for his livelihood and he won.

2057
01:45:52,400 --> 01:45:53,640
They left the cut.

2058
01:45:53,840 --> 01:45:55,200
This was an old West movie.

2059
01:45:55,400 --> 01:45:56,760
They fucking got out of Dodge.

2060
01:45:56,960 --> 01:45:58,640
And who was the last man standing?

2061
01:45:58,840 --> 01:46:00,560
Mr. Six was Mr. Six.

2062
01:46:00,640 --> 01:46:05,240
Maybe he was communicating these messages through the dancing.

2063
01:46:05,760 --> 01:46:09,440
Whoa. If we had looked into it and realized it wasn't just dumb, he was

2064
01:46:09,640 --> 01:46:14,960
conveying something and not just that, like if you let these people leave six

2065
01:46:15,160 --> 01:46:19,000
flags and go on to run the world and be in charge of your rent, they're going to

2066
01:46:19,200 --> 01:46:21,280
fuck you apart. Yeah.

2067
01:46:21,480 --> 01:46:24,600
He knew he knew in 2007.

2068
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:26,040
Wow.

2069
01:46:26,240 --> 01:46:27,360
Man. Yeah.

2070
01:46:27,560 --> 01:46:30,000
This is the weirdest episode we've ever done.

2071
01:46:30,160 --> 01:46:32,040
I will. Who knew that Mr.

2072
01:46:32,240 --> 01:46:35,320
Six would lead to all kinds of current corruption stuff?

2073
01:46:35,520 --> 01:46:38,400
I think Mr. Six, I will say, is conspicuously absent.

2074
01:46:38,600 --> 01:46:41,600
And I hope like Dave Chappelle, he will reemerge.

2075
01:46:41,800 --> 01:46:45,560
He's probably sitting and thinking about what can he say?

2076
01:46:45,760 --> 01:46:47,840
He's probably like he's biding his time.

2077
01:46:47,840 --> 01:46:49,320
But I know he'll be around.

2078
01:46:49,520 --> 01:46:51,560
We'll hear his comment on everything.

2079
01:46:51,760 --> 01:46:57,200
Yes. I mean, it'll be it'll be he's probably thinking of what dance to do.

2080
01:46:57,400 --> 01:46:59,600
What dance will heal this nation?

2081
01:46:59,760 --> 01:47:00,520
Yeah.

2082
01:47:00,720 --> 01:47:05,640
So I guess a hero will rise, I think.

2083
01:47:06,200 --> 01:47:10,120
I think that like Six Flags obviously owns a character.

2084
01:47:10,120 --> 01:47:12,080
Six Flags probably owns Marvel McFay.

2085
01:47:12,280 --> 01:47:16,120
I think maybe you could do an All Stars of Six Flags characters,

2086
01:47:16,320 --> 01:47:18,920
Marvel McFay, Mr. Six, Mrs.

2087
01:47:19,120 --> 01:47:24,760
Taz, all the characters, the Jim Carrey Riddler.

2088
01:47:24,960 --> 01:47:26,680
And Avengers must rise.

2089
01:47:26,880 --> 01:47:28,840
Yeah. Don't forget Little Six.

2090
01:47:28,920 --> 01:47:31,360
Little Six, of course.

2091
01:47:31,560 --> 01:47:33,360
And then

2092
01:47:33,560 --> 01:47:36,440
I'm trying to think of any of the original characters from their fear,

2093
01:47:36,640 --> 01:47:38,880
their fear fest that I can't think of.

2094
01:47:39,080 --> 01:47:41,400
Oh, well, one of those characters, too.

2095
01:47:41,600 --> 01:47:47,280
And they'll all be backed up by an army of poorly paid teens.

2096
01:47:47,480 --> 01:47:48,200
Yeah.

2097
01:47:48,400 --> 01:47:52,280
And that's that's who you want on your back.

2098
01:47:52,480 --> 01:47:54,720
Poorly paid teens saving your back.

2099
01:47:54,920 --> 01:47:57,080
Yeah, they got nothing to lose.

2100
01:47:57,200 --> 01:47:59,840
They're all they're all hopped up on vape juice and

2101
01:48:00,040 --> 01:48:04,520
yeah, fog juice, fog juice.

2102
01:48:05,960 --> 01:48:06,520
Yeah.

2103
01:48:06,720 --> 01:48:10,760
Anyways, it's so

2104
01:48:10,960 --> 01:48:12,520
I just I feel back to the corner.

2105
01:48:12,520 --> 01:48:13,760
I have I have to like them.

2106
01:48:13,760 --> 01:48:17,480
I'm pro him. And not only for all those reasons, but I also realize something.

2107
01:48:17,680 --> 01:48:19,840
I think I might have seen him the first time.

2108
01:48:20,040 --> 01:48:22,720
And like I say, you know, I thought I thought it was weird.

2109
01:48:22,720 --> 01:48:23,480
I thought it was weird.

2110
01:48:23,640 --> 01:48:27,520
He's weird in a bad way or random in a way that I don't like.

2111
01:48:27,720 --> 01:48:28,280
But you know what?

2112
01:48:28,480 --> 01:48:31,440
You know what he is, is he's not he's not IP.

2113
01:48:31,640 --> 01:48:34,720
He's not you know, he's original IP, his original Six Flags IP.

2114
01:48:34,920 --> 01:48:37,120
And he is a little weird and a little divisive.

2115
01:48:37,320 --> 01:48:41,560
And as soon as these corporate fat cats came in, they didn't understand him.

2116
01:48:41,760 --> 01:48:43,280
You know, we don't want him.

2117
01:48:43,280 --> 01:48:44,120
We need the guys.

2118
01:48:44,120 --> 01:48:47,360
We need something we can trust like the characters from Hoodwinked.

2119
01:48:47,560 --> 01:48:50,000
We need something that makes sense on a spreadsheet.

2120
01:48:50,200 --> 01:48:52,600
And Mr. Six doesn't make sense on a spreadsheet.

2121
01:48:52,800 --> 01:48:55,800
He's he doesn't make any sense at all.

2122
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:57,480
And that's why you have to support it.

2123
01:48:57,480 --> 01:49:00,000
I think supporting Mr. Six, whether or not you like him,

2124
01:49:00,200 --> 01:49:03,880
is to support the cause of keeping theme parks weird.

2125
01:49:04,080 --> 01:49:05,880
Right, right. I agree.

2126
01:49:06,080 --> 01:49:10,200
I think you're right. I think I think we could put that put the

2127
01:49:10,400 --> 01:49:13,080
Star Spangled Banner under that, as you were saying it.

2128
01:49:13,080 --> 01:49:14,880
That was such a beautiful statement, Scott.

2129
01:49:15,080 --> 01:49:19,560
I think that's a good point, because we all we all bemoan

2130
01:49:19,800 --> 01:49:22,920
the lack of original IP and weirdness in the parks.

2131
01:49:23,120 --> 01:49:25,920
Everything now has to be a big movie, you know?

2132
01:49:26,120 --> 01:49:32,080
And it is nice that this bizarre, random old man who's not really connected

2133
01:49:32,280 --> 01:49:35,560
to anything is related to Six Flags.

2134
01:49:35,560 --> 01:49:37,840
It would be nice to see him in the park still because you go,

2135
01:49:38,040 --> 01:49:39,920
well, I only get to see this old man here.

2136
01:49:40,120 --> 01:49:41,920
This is a special place.

2137
01:49:42,120 --> 01:49:43,920
There's a special character that I only

2138
01:49:44,120 --> 01:49:47,560
can experience in one of these wonderful Six Flags parks.

2139
01:49:47,760 --> 01:49:50,080
Like Figment and Dreamfinder. That's right.

2140
01:49:50,280 --> 01:49:54,840
I certainly like Figment and Dreamfinder more, but it is the same

2141
01:49:55,040 --> 01:49:56,600
syndrome we're talking about.

2142
01:49:56,600 --> 01:50:00,680
It's who gets characters you can only meet if you go to this specific place or like

2143
01:50:00,880 --> 01:50:03,400
19 specific places and maybe he's not there.

2144
01:50:03,600 --> 01:50:04,600
I don't know.

2145
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:06,600
Yes, I just be in the ads.

2146
01:50:06,800 --> 01:50:08,040
Look, I like him now.

2147
01:50:08,240 --> 01:50:09,600
I absolutely like him now.

2148
01:50:09,600 --> 01:50:10,880
Very good. Yeah, I just want to.

2149
01:50:11,080 --> 01:50:12,440
Yeah, let's let's expand it.

2150
01:50:12,640 --> 01:50:13,880
That's all I'm saying.

2151
01:50:14,080 --> 01:50:15,960
Yeah, yeah.

2152
01:50:16,120 --> 01:50:19,640
So Six Flags reopens at some point.

2153
01:50:19,840 --> 01:50:20,960
We want to see him there.

2154
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:25,320
We want to see him in a mask because he's a he's a role model and he can he can

2155
01:50:25,520 --> 01:50:27,040
lead the way.

2156
01:50:27,240 --> 01:50:29,160
But what else?

2157
01:50:29,360 --> 01:50:30,920
How can we expand his role?

2158
01:50:31,120 --> 01:50:33,280
Do we give him more rides?

2159
01:50:33,480 --> 01:50:35,480
Does he appear in the Justice League ride?

2160
01:50:35,680 --> 01:50:37,520
Does he join the Justice League?

2161
01:50:37,720 --> 01:50:39,120
I love that. That's great.

2162
01:50:39,320 --> 01:50:42,640
I think that's absolutely should happen.

2163
01:50:42,840 --> 01:50:45,080
I think, you know, what you could do is

2164
01:50:45,240 --> 01:50:50,200
you could sell a mask that's even more like that has more coverage.

2165
01:50:50,400 --> 01:50:52,920
That is just a rubber latex, Mr.

2166
01:50:53,120 --> 01:50:58,800
Six head that has sort of the same kind of masking properties in the nose and mouth

2167
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:02,640
area. So you have just everyone walking around with Mr.

2168
01:51:02,840 --> 01:51:04,560
Six faces on.

2169
01:51:04,760 --> 01:51:09,120
Whoa. So, you know, the theme parts are coming back and they're going to require

2170
01:51:09,320 --> 01:51:12,840
masks. You can't enter without a mask at Six Flags nationwide.

2171
01:51:12,880 --> 01:51:14,920
If you can't enter without a Mr.

2172
01:51:15,120 --> 01:51:16,280
Six mask.

2173
01:51:16,480 --> 01:51:17,320
Yes, you have to.

2174
01:51:17,520 --> 01:51:19,480
Yeah, you have to wear Mr.

2175
01:51:19,680 --> 01:51:20,680
Six on your face.

2176
01:51:20,880 --> 01:51:24,520
So it's just a bunch of sixes walking around.

2177
01:51:24,720 --> 01:51:28,600
It would be like Agent Smith in The Matrix.

2178
01:51:28,800 --> 01:51:31,360
I guess you'd have to wear the suit, too, to really make it look like that.

2179
01:51:31,560 --> 01:51:33,160
But maybe that's also part of it.

2180
01:51:33,360 --> 01:51:39,640
You have to wear a hazmat suit that looks like a black tuxedo with a bow tie,

2181
01:51:39,840 --> 01:51:41,080
which I like.

2182
01:51:41,240 --> 01:51:44,840
I put it out there that I want to go to Six Flags opening day in a hazmat suit.

2183
01:51:45,040 --> 01:51:48,920
If some sort of publication will pay for all of it, I will cover it.

2184
01:51:49,120 --> 01:51:50,920
But now I'd like to amend that, too.

2185
01:51:51,120 --> 01:51:56,840
I'd like you to pay for a tuxedo and a latex mask of Mr.

2186
01:51:57,040 --> 01:51:58,080
Six that I can wear.

2187
01:51:58,280 --> 01:51:59,280
Yeah.

2188
01:51:59,480 --> 01:52:03,120
But it has that has to be virus compliant.

2189
01:52:03,320 --> 01:52:08,840
Yes, it has to have inside the latex mask has to have one of the what is the N95.

2190
01:52:08,840 --> 01:52:10,440
What is that? Is that the name of the mask?

2191
01:52:10,480 --> 01:52:11,480
Yes.

2192
01:52:11,680 --> 01:52:13,280
Like the hospital mask.

2193
01:52:13,480 --> 01:52:14,040
Yeah, sorry.

2194
01:52:14,240 --> 01:52:16,840
34. I think you need an R34 mask.

2195
01:52:17,040 --> 01:52:18,240
OK, I will.

2196
01:52:18,440 --> 01:52:20,240
65 mask.

2197
01:52:20,920 --> 01:52:23,160
Those are all good masks.

2198
01:52:23,720 --> 01:52:25,920
Just take your pick, but you'll choose.

2199
01:52:26,120 --> 01:52:27,480
Yeah.

2200
01:52:28,520 --> 01:52:30,240
That's that's great.

2201
01:52:30,440 --> 01:52:34,040
You know, there's a powerful moment, I think, about a lot at the end of the film

2202
01:52:34,080 --> 01:52:42,600
Volcano, where ash has fallen on everyone in the Beverly Center area

2203
01:52:42,800 --> 01:52:48,640
where the volcano was erupting and a little girl is asking you, do you see your

2204
01:52:48,840 --> 01:52:53,320
daddy somewhere? And and she says, I don't know who's who.

2205
01:52:53,520 --> 01:52:56,840
Everyone looks the same

2206
01:52:57,040 --> 01:52:59,960
cuts around to everyone covered in ash,

2207
01:53:00,120 --> 01:53:03,760
the end, which should be a destructive act, but it's reminding everyone that we're

2208
01:53:03,960 --> 01:53:06,480
all human and that it's it's on.

2209
01:53:06,680 --> 01:53:11,040
We're all in this together, transcends the racial lines, age, everything.

2210
01:53:11,240 --> 01:53:13,440
And I think the same thing would happen

2211
01:53:13,640 --> 01:53:16,280
in this reopen six flags where everyone's in a Mr.

2212
01:53:16,480 --> 01:53:21,600
Six mask, a little kid would say, we're all the same.

2213
01:53:21,800 --> 01:53:23,200
We all scary.

2214
01:53:23,400 --> 01:53:24,840
We're all the same.

2215
01:53:25,040 --> 01:53:27,200
We're all a little a little creepy.

2216
01:53:27,200 --> 01:53:31,040
We're all a little test from Canyon Valley a bit.

2217
01:53:31,240 --> 01:53:34,440
But it's but metaphorically beautiful, though.

2218
01:53:34,640 --> 01:53:35,600
Yeah.

2219
01:53:35,800 --> 01:53:40,680
Mr. Six offered me the chance to buy a plastic soda cup I can refill all season

2220
01:53:40,880 --> 01:53:42,120
long.

2221
01:53:42,880 --> 01:53:45,440
Mr. Six offered me that if I buy a churro

2222
01:53:45,640 --> 01:53:50,320
for a dollar fifty, I'll get to stay in the park for six extra hours.

2223
01:53:51,160 --> 01:53:53,200
That's the real it's a real deal.

2224
01:53:53,400 --> 01:53:54,680
Yeah.

2225
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:57,200
The coffin challenge is different this year.

2226
01:53:57,400 --> 01:54:00,280
Mr. Six is in there with you.

2227
01:54:03,520 --> 01:54:07,000
Doing a very sensual dance.

2228
01:54:07,520 --> 01:54:10,280
It's raining on you in the coffin now.

2229
01:54:10,480 --> 01:54:13,600
There's water being poured into the coffin as you dance with Mr.

2230
01:54:13,800 --> 01:54:15,120
Six.

2231
01:54:16,840 --> 01:54:18,880
It's in question whether any of us could

2232
01:54:19,080 --> 01:54:23,520
survive the Mr. Six coffin challenge, but I will say that we've survived

2233
01:54:23,760 --> 01:54:25,920
podcast the ride.

2234
01:54:26,120 --> 01:54:27,840
I think that's I think it's beautiful.

2235
01:54:28,040 --> 01:54:29,880
This is the future.

2236
01:54:30,080 --> 01:54:33,600
I'll co-opt the thing that people say in a mean way on Twitter.

2237
01:54:33,800 --> 01:54:35,440
This is the future liberals want.

2238
01:54:35,640 --> 01:54:36,800
But I mean it.

2239
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:38,040
I want the future.

2240
01:54:38,240 --> 01:54:42,080
This is the future the left wants is a six flags where everyone's in a Mr.

2241
01:54:42,280 --> 01:54:44,280
Six mask. Yeah.

2242
01:54:45,160 --> 01:54:47,080
In confidence, I think.

2243
01:54:47,160 --> 01:54:48,360
I think this is going to take off.

2244
01:54:48,400 --> 01:54:49,720
This is going to get past the podcast.

2245
01:54:49,920 --> 01:54:50,840
This is going to be so popular.

2246
01:54:50,840 --> 01:54:54,040
People won't even know it comes from our podcast.

2247
01:54:54,240 --> 01:54:56,200
Oh, yeah. Where did that idea originate?

2248
01:54:56,400 --> 01:54:57,400
I don't know.

2249
01:54:57,600 --> 01:55:04,080
They say from three geniuses who didn't even want credit.

2250
01:55:04,280 --> 01:55:07,200
They just so selfless were they.

2251
01:55:07,400 --> 01:55:14,080
It's like in music videos where like music is outlawed, but then the people rise up.

2252
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:19,160
No fine like a very old Jason Sheridan and ask like, is it true?

2253
01:55:19,680 --> 01:55:22,440
Is it true that you and two other men

2254
01:55:22,640 --> 01:55:24,880
created this thing that made the world a utopia?

2255
01:55:25,080 --> 01:55:26,600
And Jason will go, it's true.

2256
01:55:26,800 --> 01:55:28,240
All of it.

2257
01:55:32,400 --> 01:55:36,720
Well, beautiful stuff for more very beautiful stuff.

2258
01:55:36,920 --> 01:55:39,000
And I'm sure a lot of great photos of Mr.

2259
01:55:39,200 --> 01:55:44,600
Six Halloween masks and different variants and creepy CGI,

2260
01:55:44,800 --> 01:55:47,280
sexualized music videos and Magic Mike dance.

2261
01:55:47,400 --> 01:55:51,800
This will all be available to you on our Twitter, on our Facebook or Instagram.

2262
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,560
And there's always three bonus episodes

2263
01:55:54,760 --> 01:56:00,240
every month over at podcast, the ride, the second gate at Patreon.com slash podcast.

2264
01:56:00,240 --> 01:56:01,160
The ride. Yeah.

2265
01:56:01,160 --> 01:56:04,800
And then rate and review us also on Apple podcast, because I always forget to say

2266
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:07,080
that, oh, and you know, right.

2267
01:56:07,080 --> 01:56:09,200
As you said that I saw something in my notes.

2268
01:56:09,400 --> 01:56:14,160
One thing that I missed, you know, you say, rate us.

2269
01:56:14,560 --> 01:56:17,240
We like to tell people to do specific things at the iTunes.

2270
01:56:17,440 --> 01:56:21,160
When Mr. Six was brought back post the

2271
01:56:21,360 --> 01:56:24,800
grim period of the most horrible men in America owning the parks,

2272
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:28,040
he was in charge of the funno meter.

2273
01:56:28,240 --> 01:56:33,600
He would rate how many flags different things were.

2274
01:56:33,800 --> 01:56:35,920
Somebody said he's our he's our raider.

2275
01:56:36,120 --> 01:56:37,560
He's Mr. Six is the raider.

2276
01:56:37,760 --> 01:56:39,960
That was a new way they thought to use him.

2277
01:56:40,160 --> 01:56:42,040
For example,

2278
01:56:42,520 --> 01:56:46,760
throwing baseball at your dad's crotch, two flags.

2279
01:56:46,960 --> 01:56:48,800
This is in an ad, I guess,

2280
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:53,800
riding a six legs roller coaster, six flags, more flags.

2281
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:54,920
Yes, that's right.

2282
01:56:55,120 --> 01:56:57,400
More flags equals more fun.

2283
01:56:57,600 --> 01:57:00,680
So should we adopt that?

2284
01:57:01,720 --> 01:57:02,760
Just.

2285
01:57:02,960 --> 01:57:04,240
Yeah.

2286
01:57:04,440 --> 01:57:10,720
I mean, the problem is that we're stuck in this authoritarian iTunes review system

2287
01:57:10,720 --> 01:57:15,080
where it's five stars and we can't customize it just for our reviews to make

2288
01:57:15,280 --> 01:57:17,440
it six flags. Yeah, right.

2289
01:57:17,640 --> 01:57:19,480
But you could write six flags.

2290
01:57:19,680 --> 01:57:26,000
You could say in the review written part, it's actually six flags that they get.

2291
01:57:26,200 --> 01:57:27,520
Yes.

2292
01:57:27,720 --> 01:57:32,360
So if you want to rate and review us, then say something, make it a question,

2293
01:57:32,560 --> 01:57:35,120
like something you like about the show,

2294
01:57:35,320 --> 01:57:40,480
listening to listening to three guys talk about a creepy old man for

2295
01:57:40,680 --> 01:57:45,560
an hour and a half, six flags, more flags, more fun

2296
01:57:46,560 --> 01:57:49,800
or whatever, fill in the blank of what you like about the show.

2297
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:50,840
Right.

2298
01:57:51,040 --> 01:57:52,480
Yeah. Anything you like.

2299
01:57:52,680 --> 01:57:54,000
Yeah.

2300
01:57:54,200 --> 01:57:56,880
But more Venga boys talk, please.

2301
01:57:57,080 --> 01:57:59,600
I'm sure that's going to be high on the list.

2302
01:58:01,440 --> 01:58:05,880
The promise of more Venga boys talk, six flags

2303
01:58:06,080 --> 01:58:07,680
should make no sense to anyone.

2304
01:58:07,680 --> 01:58:11,960
No one's going to read any of these and want to listen to the podcast, but whatever.

2305
01:58:12,160 --> 01:58:14,160
So we were flooding it with nonsense is what we want.

2306
01:58:14,360 --> 01:58:20,040
And if you think this is the weirdest episode, let us know if it's six weird flags.

2307
01:58:20,240 --> 01:58:21,720
That's a scale of weirdness.

2308
01:58:21,920 --> 01:58:26,640
How rated and what the amount of weird flags this episode is.

2309
01:58:27,240 --> 01:58:29,200
Sure. Well, we got our plan.

2310
01:58:29,400 --> 01:58:30,520
You've got your marching orders.

2311
01:58:30,720 --> 01:58:35,760
And while we should be wrapping it up, I did miss one thing and I kind of can't

2312
01:58:35,800 --> 01:58:41,360
help but throw this on because when we talked about doing this episode,

2313
01:58:41,560 --> 01:58:46,200
part of it came from the discovery that there was a different version of the

2314
01:58:46,400 --> 01:58:52,600
Venga Boys song that had a little bit of crossover with our friend Bugman.

2315
01:58:52,800 --> 01:58:58,120
So here to play us out is a from kids WB ad,

2316
01:58:58,320 --> 01:59:04,360
a customized version of the Venga Boys song that in this case is called

2317
01:59:04,520 --> 01:59:07,720
We like the Puddy.

2318
01:59:07,920 --> 01:59:09,960
Play us out, Tweety.

2319
01:59:10,160 --> 01:59:11,960
We like the Puddy.

2320
01:59:12,160 --> 01:59:13,840
We like, we like the Puddy.

2321
01:59:14,040 --> 01:59:16,080
We like the Puddy.

2322
01:59:16,280 --> 01:59:19,760
My Tweety calls me Tweety because I am a Tweety.

2323
01:59:19,960 --> 01:59:21,560
And Tweety has a Puddy.

2324
01:59:21,760 --> 01:59:24,560
And I say goody goody is me buddy.

2325
01:59:24,760 --> 01:59:26,440
We like the Puddy.

2326
01:59:26,640 --> 01:59:28,080
We like, we like the Puddy.

2327
01:59:28,280 --> 01:59:29,640
We like the Puddy.

2328
01:59:29,840 --> 01:59:31,240
I like the Tweety.

2329
01:59:31,440 --> 01:59:32,600
Whoops.
