hosts and audience alike

will soon have the definitive

25
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
answer to a decades-old

26
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
theme park mystery

27
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Is Michael Eisner the golfer

28
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,240
I'm Scott Gardner. This information is in my brain currently. It will soon be released

29
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:06,720
I'm like nervous as I say this honestly, I've been

30
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:14,080
Coming to the table with this and and to be able to share it with you Mike Carlson and you Jason Sheridan guys

31
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,160
Yeah, Mike Carlson here. This was so interesting because I you proposed this

32
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,320
Let me ask a question real quick

33
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:25,400
You proposed doing this episode and I said I wonder if he knows the answer and you did know the answer when you proposed

34
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:31,560
Well, it was on a short list. We were talking about what we do post saga getting back to theme park attractions

35
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,320
It was said do we want to do the second half of Soarin?

36
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:38,160
We owe the second half of Soarin and I was like, yeah, maybe yeah

37
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,960
I guess so and then I went and thought and I was like, yeah

38
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,520
I don't know if I want to do it unless I have the answer to this question

39
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:51,680
Yes, so I went and I explored I did some what you might call theme park journalism

40
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:56,760
Yeah, and I have the answer and I'm not even gonna back down from I'm not gonna say I think it's a good lead

41
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:02,120
Yeah, I've got it for sure. I did like a double intro. I feel like Jason you can get to say anything

42
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:08,640
How do you feel with this knowing that earth-shattering information? He's coming your way. I answer for Jason. He's scared

43
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,080
He's worried that sort of the glass house. He's built all of his theme park sort of imagination on top of I don't know

44
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,160
Why he's building it on top of a glass house, but that's what he did

45
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:23,240
It's all gonna come crumbling and crashing down that's what he's worried afraid you nailed it

46
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,720
You hit the ball grand slam, you know

47
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,160
Sort of put you in this position

48
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:34,600
It's funny cuz I I had a pin note for a few months cuz I had stuff

49
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:41,880
To talk about from first Soarin. Yes. Yes. Yeah. Yeah, I do too. Yeah, this is look work

50
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:46,200
We're this is this is the second part of our Soarin series. We're gonna focus on the world

51
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,120
Versions

52
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,440
But there's still things from a Soarin over, California

53
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:57,040
the original iteration of this the Disney hang gliding flying simulator attraction and

54
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:04,120
Among the many things that were talked about the first time was the debate about whether or not in the golf scene the Palm Springs scene

55
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:10,760
If then Disney CEO Michael Eisner made a cameo as the golf as a golfer who hits a ball

56
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,760
Towards the camera that it that is what we're dealing with here

57
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:20,040
There is going to be a conclusion to this and I think that that conclusion will come at the end of the episode

58
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:27,800
Yes, yes indeed to go out with a grand finale

59
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:35,520
Much like the fireworks at the end of all of the iterations of this attraction gotta save the fireworks for the end

60
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:40,760
The fireworks of discussing whether a then old and now even older man

61
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:45,980
Appears as a little guy here you squint at this one part of a ride

62
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:51,360
Yeah, but yeah, yeah, we're gonna know we will we will find out and I hope you guys aren't filled with fear now

63
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,160
I am still proceed and do the regular show. I'll be honest. I was projecting earlier. Yeah, I'm afraid

64
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:59,600
I've built all my dreams on top of a glass house. You put it on you put it on Jason

65
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:04,320
You were so afraid you put your fears on top as I often do with your glass menagerie

66
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,440
Menagerie inside it's all just gonna be a pile of broken glass

67
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:11,720
It will be a pile of broken glass that I will step in and roll on

68
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,080
It'll get in my skin and I will bleed after this episode. That's what I'm worried about

69
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,040
You know what though?

70
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:23,160
I listened to the first episode back and the one thing we need to make sure we put a pin in is doing an episode of

71
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,160
Michael Eisner's novel or autobiography

72
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:29,560
Camp. Yes. Yeah. Well, there's multiple books to go into

73
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:34,040
Yes, some of what came as the supposed proof of whether or not

74
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:38,920
Michael Eisner made a cameo in this ride. Yeah was that he went on Larry King

75
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,600
Promoting his book camp, which is about his days

76
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:50,240
As a boy as little Eisner which I believe is available in the Libby app from the LA library

77
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,400
But it's a bridged it is a bridge what you said on the other episode

78
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:02,080
Still haunted that's why I haven't like come on to listening. You're really gonna use the word haunts

79
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:10,160
How haunted are you his glass house is haunted? I cuz I I mostly I've been doing more audio books in the last few years

80
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,080
But I mostly like the unabridged first, of course

81
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,000
You need to get the raw details with the raw detail young Michael

82
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,360
But he does read his own audio book. So like

83
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,760
I'm Michael Eisner the man who's about to take your virginity

84
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,120
Is a raw yes

85
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:36,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's not a bridge a bridge is probably sanity totally unabridged

86
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:39,360
Yes, that's that's rated is the more common term

87
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,240
But yeah unabridged books, you know might leave in some of the some of the naughty stuff

88
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,080
A bridge is just about him in the canoe and stuff. Mm-hmm

89
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:52,920
Passages about his canoeing fucking in the canoe, but in the unabridged, okay

90
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:59,880
Yes, there's no fucking in the canoe all clean canoe rides clean safe. Nice canoe rides when it's abridged. Okay, right

91
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,120
No, I noted that too. All right

92
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,160
Well, it's good that we go back and we revisit these things because yeah fall through the cracks

93
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:12,640
Imagine how haunted to use Jason's term the listeners would be if we did not do a full thorough

94
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,640
examination of Michael Eisner's book camp

95
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,280
There really there is so much stuff to do

96
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:25,360
I mean, I'm always happy when when he is part of these episodes and part of these discussions

97
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,400
He's gonna be part of this one in a big way

98
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,920
But let's save that for the end because there's other stuff to get through

99
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:36,940
So as I said, it's our second episode about the sword and franchise. It started in California adventure

100
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:42,740
It's now in parks all over the world and that is kind of our focus today is the world version

101
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:47,900
There's a number of different names for that soaring around the world soaring fantastic flight

102
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:50,520
It's roughly the same ride film but different

103
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:56,420
Aspects to the the pre shows and even though even the ride films themselves in yeah

104
00:06:56,420 --> 00:07:02,660
But you know, this is kind of the rough division that they wanted to start peppering in this, you know

105
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:10,580
The only hit for California adventure really yes when it opens in 2001 and a hit big enough that they want to start putting it

106
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:16,140
In international parks, but is it weird to be in international parks and you're going over Camarillo

107
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:22,900
Landing at Disneyland, that's a big thing about the various soaring around the world

108
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:28,480
It it writes that last scene to like you're going over the place

109
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:34,740
You are every one of them gets a custom ending usually of the theme park

110
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:40,220
You're in but sometimes not not in the yeah in the case of Shanghai

111
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:44,320
but that said in sort of the

112
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:51,100
Non-strict confines of the Soren over, California episode back in September

113
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:56,020
We made it such that you know, we just we cut it off after two hours, you know

114
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:58,500
Hey, we can save that stuff for next time

115
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,540
Well, we're at next time before we move to the world

116
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:06,020
Is there stuff that we want to talk about from the original iteration of Soren?

117
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:09,460
Well, we didn't this is tough because we didn't get to the ending

118
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:13,140
We didn't even talk really about Tinkerbell. I don't know if we should just save that for the end of this

119
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:17,420
Because it's sort of similar. Mm-hmm, but I don't know some of my thoughts

120
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:22,500
Hey, if you're if you're if you're anchoring to talk tink then let's talk I am hankering. Yes

121
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:27,740
I think we didn't even discuss how do we feel about Tinkerbell showing up because this is a ride that does not have

122
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,820
Cartoon characters in it. It is human beings

123
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:35,220
Obviously, there's a little CGI in the first version in the Soren over, California

124
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:40,680
Which is the hang glider and I assume some other places I forget maybe the maybe the balloon well the golf ball

125
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:47,940
Yes, this controversial scene that they did not shoot a golf ball at a helicopter camera

126
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:50,940
No, that was soaring toward a golf ball. Yeah. Yeah

127
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:54,780
And that's that's one question. I don't know whether that proves

128
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:59,260
It is Michael Eisner or not. Do we think Michael Eisner was a good enough?

129
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:05,440
A crack shot. Yeah. Yeah. Yes to be that perfect to hit a moving target in the air

130
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:11,740
This isn't even something that regular golfers deal with no is to like they're they're thinking about the hole

131
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:17,460
But for a golfer to have to hit a moving target. This is more like skeet shooting. That would be awesome

132
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,460
I would really want to play golf if you had to hit

133
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:23,420
Moving aerial targets. Yeah, there's like a more like duck hunt

134
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:23,780
Yeah

135
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,900
Yeah, a hole in the front of like a

136
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:30,040
Helicopter and they would just swoop down and you try to get the hole for the ball in that hole

137
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:36,700
Yeah, that'd be awesome. It sounds insanely hard. Yeah, you're at now. You're you don't really have a putting option

138
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:43,900
This is almost this is like golf is yeah hole in one or nothing. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, which is the stakes are high

139
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:48,640
Mm-hmm. Well, look, I know the creator of slam ball. So maybe he would be interested in my new idea here

140
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:52,800
So it was an effortless drop knowing the creator of slam ball

141
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,540
I do these not commonly said thing on the shit something you've said a lot

142
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,560
Yes, and I still don't really know the ins and outs of it. I gotta know if that's true

143
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,320
No, it's but I've said this a couple times on the show. No one has asked any further questions

144
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:09,400
I was I was thinking how this has never been explored. It is something that I kind of want to keep moving

145
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:14,040
Bring it up now though. I don't do you know the full story already Jason?

146
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:20,020
I know a little bit and I remember slam ball is trampoline basketball. Yeah, no spike TV

147
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:24,760
Well, that's that's maybe one reason I've kept moving is that I don't actually know what slam ball is

148
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:29,720
Oh now I know it's I was like that's not the one with wheelchairs. Is it? No, that's a different thing

149
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
That it's just called wheelchair basketball

150
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,140
Isn't there there's like a documentary about it

151
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:38,480
Oh

152
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:44,020
No, I do not know the creator of murder ball. Okay. Well, I would have stopped you if it was the creator of murder ball

153
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:50,700
Set up outside of Universal Hollywood many years ago. Oh, yeah, I saw it. Yeah

154
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:56,680
Yeah, I saw that was actually next next like an accident actually though. I would didn't get there like VIP passes or something to it

155
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:59,220
But I'll score the VIP slam ball

156
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:05,540
I brought this up on the show before. Yeah, mine was also accident. Like I just walked by and saw the sets

157
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:11,260
So you guys ever stop and think about how lucky you are just an accidental pass by slam ball

158
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:14,300
Mm-hmm, and that's just a day in your lives in Hollywood

159
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:18,940
And I was there the day that Gavin Newsom stood by a minion and said that the pandemic was over

160
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:23,340
Didn't you miss it though? I didn't see it. I was down over a lot. Hey

161
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:29,260
Humble, you know, you aren't lucky all the time. That's true. I was what year was that? Oh

162
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:35,260
2012 right, is that right? No, it was 2021. I think 2021

163
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:43,040
Summer and Optimus was there too. Optimus was there. Yes. I assume that Lucy was standing next to Gavin

164
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:50,700
We would pecker probably she took her Vitamita, Vegemin mask off. Mm-hmm. They did the whole

165
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:57,180
Routine with the conveyor belt with Gavin Lucy and Gavin doing the chocolates. Oh, yeah putting them in the hat and stuff

166
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:02,940
Yeah, it was fun. Everything was that was even harder than being the governor. Just kidding actually, California

167
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:07,420
These times have been extremely trying even more than a fast moving chocolate machine

168
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:15,100
But that ends today because covet ends today let's french laundry is open for everyone now

169
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:19,900
Next let's say like next time I find a reason to crowbar and then I know the creator of slam ball

170
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:23,820
Let's explore it, but not now. I want to talk about tinkerbell. No save it for the camp episode

171
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:27,980
Um, how do we feel about tinkerbell in it? I don't know

172
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:30,620
You know, it's it's at the end if it was in the middle

173
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:32,620
Yeah, it would take me out of it

174
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:36,300
But we're already at disneyland. We're we're dealing with magic

175
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:41,820
The fireworks are also seem very fakie in all of them. Yes, not in a way that bothers me

176
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:49,500
but you know, it's I think we have reached magical realism by the end of soren and I have no objection to

177
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:55,020
Tinkerbell other than her being from my least favorite cinematic world. Sure

178
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:59,660
Um, I I don't i'm not mad when she shows up

179
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:07,180
I like I believe you I like tinkerbell. I'm not mad. I don't get mad every time I see her, but I don't know

180
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:12,860
That it would have been my choice. I don't think my I think I would have been in the room arguing against this

181
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,820
I understand ending up in disneyland, but

182
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:20,540
I don't know why we need a cartoon character in this

183
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,460
ride

184
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:26,620
I don't well, I don't maybe a child needs to be part of this conversation

185
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:33,820
Child a child in here. What about a man with a mind like a child? That's what i'm that's where i'm coming from here

186
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:38,800
Uh, uh, I just feel like there was a way to do it without tinkerbell

187
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,500
Because it doesn't it's you know what here here

188
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:46,540
If they had done like more of like a wonderful world of disney intro or something if patrick was not there

189
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,900
And like it made more thematic sense. They're like, oh tinkerbell's there

190
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:54,780
She's putting a little bow on the end of this thing. I just like she's giant. I guess in this screen, too

191
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,860
I don't like the scale of it

192
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:01,660
Again, I don't not like this. She's fine. I'm not upset by it, but it's not my choice

193
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:04,860
And I always feel like it not that it takes me out of it

194
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:09,820
But I feel like it's not really like a mismatch or something to me a little bit of a mismatch

195
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:13,500
I don't know. It just doesn't feel like the ride to have a cartoon character on

196
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:20,300
Am I crazy here in in around the world? Does she only show up in the american versions?

197
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:26,300
Oh, that's a good question. I haven't watched fantastic flight in a while. I watched all the endings and now I forget

198
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:34,140
Oh, well just let's thinker bell appears of no above like disney sea. No, I don't think so. Yeah, so I'm just magic

199
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:36,860
It's a magic kingdom thing. It's a castle park thing. Yeah

200
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,980
I don't know. I feel like

201
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:45,340
I should be coming in with like the hot opposite take you could say you like it me

202
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:49,500
This is something I have no feelings either way. Oh, okay, it's just something that's never

203
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:54,620
Bumped me interesting. I don't understand your pitch about you have to remove patrick

204
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:58,860
In order to make this work if it was like if there was some sort of like framing where it's like

205
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:02,460
Oh, this is a wonderful world of disney and now we're doing a travel log or something

206
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:07,420
That's sort of the premise of the ride because tinkerbell would be on that show and it's like she's putting a little bow at

207
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:11,660
The end of this ride where you're you're going through the actual tv show or something

208
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:16,380
Versus to be through the tv show. This is a pitch off the top of my head

209
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:20,060
I'm just saying a way to maybe make it make some thematic sense to me

210
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:25,820
You think she just kind of seems like an afterthought just showing up at the end a little bit of an afterthought

211
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:29,820
But also the way I read the ride when she does the little you know

212
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:36,060
The little magic thing at the end the magic swipe at the end. She blesses you she blesses you that almost feels like you're

213
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,780
Saying oh by the way, what we just did was magic

214
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:44,780
But everything up until that point is practical everything up to that point is sort of acting like this is a real thing

215
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:47,200
You're going on. Here's a pilot. We've got this contraption

216
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:54,700
Everything is practical except for the clouds at the very beginning the golf ball that comes toward you the hang glider

217
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:56,700
Practical in the sense that they're

218
00:15:56,700 --> 00:16:01,500
Like pretending that it's real. It's the real world. It's more the real world than it is

219
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:05,660
Like we have some we found a little uh, uh canister of pixie dust

220
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:10,860
And we're sprinkling it on these little seats and you put your your seat belt on and your dirty yellow strap

221
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:13,900
You tug on it and then we sprinkle you with pixie dust and you fly

222
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,380
the way it's sort of being like

223
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:20,460
Portrayed is that this is more of a practical

224
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:24,380
Fun trip through the world. Obviously you're teleporting to some degree

225
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:28,140
So there's magic involved obviously we don't know what this flying contraption is

226
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:32,300
I think more in fantastic flight they go more into what the details of it are

227
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:37,740
But it just feels like oh this was actually just some magic thing tinker bell did at the end. It almost is like

228
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:40,460
It comes in out of nowhere to me

229
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:45,660
And it makes it feel like well that kind of like you think it's a reveal that she made all the flying happen

230
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:45,980
Yeah

231
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:46,860
Why would she be there?

232
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:51,820
And why does she do it again and we transport back because you're a disneyland because tinker bell lives at disneyland

233
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:55,820
She comes up and says hi. Yeah, but it is the park for adults

234
00:16:56,460 --> 00:17:00,940
It is a park for you're right about that, but that's not where you are in that scene

235
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:06,860
You're above disneyland and you're above a castle a concert forever decorated for christmas

236
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:08,620
Mm-hmm

237
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:11,500
The most lights that way I think that's nice. Hello

238
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:16,220
She does a little her wand thing and then we all of a sudden transport back

239
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:21,820
Uh-huh. She's flying we're back down. That's her taking away your flying powers. That's her

240
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:26,700
That's her shutting the machines off. Sure. She begins that that's it's practical

241
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:29,420
She begins the power down procedure for the hang gliders

242
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:30,940
so

243
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:34,540
If there was a little hidden thing where she was like pixie dusting

244
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:39,180
The machines before we started then I would be comfortable with it if there was like a little easter egg

245
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:45,100
Where like she sort of sprinkled you wanted to wrap around you want less photos of like

246
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:49,820
Howard hughes in his how about this patrick is sort of doing the introduction

247
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:53,740
He has all the same lines that we love and then he goes he's like there's something in his pocket or something

248
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:57,180
He's like quiet down there quiet like there's a little like a

249
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:04,380
Tinkerbell he's shoving the pixie into his pocket because the pixie flight attendant is keeping a pixie

250
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:08,460
Well, maybe she can't breathe. She's in the what that happens to her

251
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:11,740
I think of peter pan a couple times right where she's in a pocket. I wouldn't know

252
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:15,180
Jason help me out here. How many times is tinkerbell in a pocket?

253
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:19,020
Well, I do under the camera up top my head. She gets caught in the pocket

254
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:22,460
Am I crazy? She gets caught in stuff sometimes. No, I think that's right

255
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:28,380
But yeah, so i'm just saying if there was a little bit like they were alluding to her first or the early part

256
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:32,620
Then it would make more sense or I guess if she just waved at us

257
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:36,060
And that was it and then then our machine

258
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:40,140
Powered down this but then you would be here saying

259
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:43,980
But in the why i've tinkerbell in there if she doesn't do the pixie dust

260
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:50,780
That's what tinkerbell is about. I think you'd be finding some problems. It's not no matter. We'll never know. We'll never know

261
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:57,260
I i'm never again. I'm not mad. I believe you i'm not don't raise your voice

262
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:02,380
To tell us that you're i'm not mad. I'm not mad. I I I think my

263
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,460
Objection my version of this is in this

264
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:10,700
Soarin around the world over the horizon whatever you want to call it

265
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:15,900
Sure is a little more like the soarin over the uncanny valley

266
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:21,900
Where it's like wait those animals are doing tricks. Yes, like that polar bear's dropping at the right point

267
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:25,980
Uh, it's far worse because then they're trying to sell it as realistic

268
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:32,140
Yeah, as opposed to just cartoon laid on top of uh, but you know just to close it out

269
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:36,300
I hear you. I think it's interesting. I also think

270
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:41,260
Who fucking cares? What do you mean? It's tick tickable shows up for one second. How could this possibly bother you?

271
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:49,020
I look i've i've expressed my feelings about it. I think it sort of invalidates everything we've gotten up until that point in the ride

272
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:54,140
and I think they could make some tweaks and it would make a little bit more sense why she's there and then she

273
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:57,980
De-blesses you and sends you back into the real world

274
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:02,700
Unblesses you that's the way I feel. I don't feel she's blessing us. She is like the sun

275
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:08,220
And you are icarus and you have you your hubris has gotten out of

276
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:15,340
She's sending you back down to earth, but at least she's humbling your fault. Yeah humbling you it's really a mental change

277
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:20,540
Yeah, she's we want to soar forever and she's like no way get out of here. That's my territory

278
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:25,500
I'm sure the moment where patrick in the pre-show captures her in a jar

279
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:29,420
As tinkerbell is constantly being put in jars

280
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:33,660
I'm sure that was cut for like bullshit budget reasons

281
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:37,500
That's possible. Yes, and that would help if they put it back in if they have some money left

282
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:42,460
From these new haunted mansion renovations they could do that and fix a big problem a big

283
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:44,620
Uh, it's gotta be from there

284
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:48,780
They have to come in under so they can put in a scene with patrick in a jar

285
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:53,420
I also what is up? Why are we by the way so familiar with patrick?

286
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:56,460
We're all saying so patrick and patrick if they're listening to sorry

287
00:20:56,460 --> 00:21:02,060
We mean patrick warburton the who's in the pre-show they listen to soren 2 they listen to soren 1

288
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:07,420
Yeah, I know. I think people know that it's just an odd choice. We've unilaterally made patrick, you know patrick

289
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:08,540
Yeah

290
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:13,020
So anyway, that's again not mad. I'm just saying there could be little fixes

291
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:18,320
And uh, like taking away the little bit of child whimsy

292
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:23,200
In an otherwise kind of adult ride you want to rip the cartoon fun

293
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,920
Right out of this instance. Yes, and if I was in imagineering at this point, I would have

294
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:31,040
Handcuffed myself to the desk until they took her out

295
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,800
But would have been your chair throwing i'm not mad moments in the office next time I see her

296
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:40,960
I won't be mad at her. Okay. Yeah, and the you know, just hey

297
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:45,280
I'm gonna i'm gonna clear these chairs before we get out of here today just to make sure one doesn't go flying

298
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,880
Okay, if you're if you're still this not mad at the end of the episode

299
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,800
I'll handcuff myself to the chair if something gets said in this episode that I don't like

300
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,800
And you'll have to take it back. That's fine. All right

301
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,360
We'll just we'll shut the lights out on you lock up the building

302
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:04,400
You have to live with the knowledge that i'm in here while you're sleeping in your beds

303
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:09,040
I mean we are gonna have to set the security codes. So try not to move around too much

304
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:13,280
Well, but when the police come i'll explain what they did what they did to me officers

305
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:19,680
What these gentlemen did why what they said first they didn't remotely understand why i'm properly

306
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:24,880
Not upset about a ferry at the end of a disney ride. Yeah, right then

307
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,440
um, here's here's what I want to

308
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,000
Say before we close out

309
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,200
California, yeah

310
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:39,520
My biggest block of information that I have to expel from my brain is about a kind of dry scene though a cool scene

311
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,240
Which is the scene with the aircraft carrier?

312
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,640
Uh, I believe you're in you're in long bay. No, no, no san diego. Why do I say i'm san diego?

313
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,600
You're in san diego in that scene and uh, you are flying over

314
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:57,140
You know, you're you're coming close to landing on the uss john c stennis

315
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:04,160
And I thought I gotta figure out if there's anything else here about this man or about this ship

316
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:11,520
And there is both so here is some story time for all of you about john c stennis first the man

317
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:16,740
Uh john c stennis was a mississippi senator from 1947 to 1989

318
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,520
If you can imagine

319
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:26,720
In those years the kinds of opinions that a mississippi senator might have had perhaps a segregationist perhaps

320
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:32,420
Opposed all of the uh important 1960s civil rights legislation

321
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,400
Uh, not a good man. Um a democrat

322
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:41,920
Uh, and yet still man, so this I don't know this proves to me that a democrat can be not a good guy

323
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,040
Well, they kind of the party's kind of swapped

324
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,720
I think he was also joking

325
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,480
The republicans were awesome in the 1960s. Oh, they rocked they rocked

326
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,240
Um, but anyway, I say that he's a democrat because it factors into

327
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,360
The story i'm going to tell here, which is his main

328
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,840
uh kind of

329
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,400
I don't know notability in history

330
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:10,240
Maybe uh, I mean one one part of history was all of these bad things that he did and the bad votes that he made

331
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,980
Yeah, but uh, the other thing about john c stennis is his uh participation

332
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,760
In the watergate scandal

333
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,360
Uh, so we're let's cut too late in the watergate scandal nixon is

334
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,440
Against the ropes a special prosecutor has been appointed and he wants nixon to hand over

335
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:36,720
His many hours of weirdly recorded tapes in the oval office, please give this to the special prosecutor's office

336
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,960
Nixon does not want to do this

337
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:42,800
Uh, because they likely incriminate him and also on the tapes

338
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:48,640
He uses a lot of foul language and racial slurs sure so he nixon's like, okay

339
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,920
Nobody's the american people are not going to hear these tapes

340
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:57,200
Uh, here's what but I want to help out. I am a helpful man me richard nixon

341
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,940
I will make you a compromise

342
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,200
We will do the stennis compromise

343
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:06,160
Um, this is probably if you're into the whole watergate story

344
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:10,800
You surely know this but I didn't know this step of it and this was the stennis compromise

345
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:18,240
Uh, you know, all right john c stennis. He's a democrat as you know, he's not he's not I should be a little bit nixon

346
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,720
He's not in my pocket. He's impartial, right?

347
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,880
Uh, so here's what we'll do

348
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:27,760
He will listen to the tapes and he'll give you the gist of what's on the tapes

349
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,960
We'll put him in a room with the tapes and then he will describe what he heard on the tapes

350
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:39,280
And then no one needs to hear the tapes and special prosecutor archivald cox said that seems weird

351
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,440
Uh, why would that be?

352
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:47,040
Why would he be a good person to do that? Because democrat he is democrat. He that is and then

353
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:51,760
Uh the special prosecutor keeps thinking and says wait a minute

354
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:58,080
Do you want him to give the gist of what's on the tapes because he's extremely old

355
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,720
almost deaf

356
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,840
and

357
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:06,960
Extremely medicated because earlier in the year he was mugged and shot. Oh my god

358
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:12,000
So here we have him nixon's idea of how to be fair is to get the most

359
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:18,800
Enfeebled man in washington a guy who's like his senses are not working in multiple ways

360
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:25,200
And he's just gonna listen to a tape and see what he retains or hears at all if anything

361
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,400
This is like a cohen brothers movie or something like it's really

362
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:32,960
This was cut from bernie after reading for being too on the nose

363
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:38,960
That's really funny. It speaks to the calm frame of mind of nixon at this time. What do we do?

364
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:42,640
Okay, we're gonna find a deaf guy who's a deaf guy and make sure okay

365
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,760
Why don't you have somebody mug and shoot him? Okay, wait cut that from the record

366
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:51,760
We're not gonna say that i'm the one who commissioned the shooting anyway, okay, um, so uh, yeah

367
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:59,280
The plan's crazy and paranoid the special prosecutor archibald cox rejected it nixon said okay

368
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:03,600
You're fired and that was the saturday night massacre

369
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:09,040
Oh, yeah, which was the big thing that showed the corruption of the office at this point

370
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:14,000
The kind of thing that trump did all the time and will possibly in the future

371
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,680
Or maybe not eat. I don't know. You won't even have to do it all the time

372
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,640
Very good point but at the time

373
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,400
This was a scandalous thing for a president to do and it involved this

374
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,960
Very stupid idea involving the man who the ship is named after wow

375
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,360
And now every time you go on this ride think about that

376
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,040
When you see that ship, yeah

377
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:37,440
You could hear nixon's voice in your head when you see this scene like oh what else how can we add to this?

378
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,600
We could spin him around real fast

379
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,800
Making me a lot of spicy food. How about that?

380
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:49,120
Freedom the freedom the spiciest hot wings we could find there was another great real quick off the off nixon

381
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,800
Nixon's of course his brother had the restaurant on harbor

382
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:57,520
Oh, that's right. Yes in the inner county near disneyland. There was a there was a nixon diner

383
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,160
Yeah, yes

384
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:03,920
And i'll shout out uh the bob gurr show that he's been doing on youtube where 20 baxter just did an interview and told a very

385
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:05,840
amusing

386
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,840
Walt and nixon's brother story

387
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:14,080
Really which got like he asked his brother to get nixon to come to the opening of the monorail

388
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,040
I believe or something

389
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:18,800
I I won't go in the full thing because I don't remember it obviously but uh, it's got a bunch of

390
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:24,480
New newer tony stuff in the sense that I haven't heard him say the same story. Oh 10 times

391
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:29,920
Like I have another it's not but does but does he do the hits does he tell the breck eisner?

392
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:35,600
No, breck eisner. No george lucas big snake story here. We're cooking. Okay. I was impressed

393
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:41,600
I was like, oh I haven't heard like a couple of these. Wow. Yeah. Wow new tony drops new tony drops. Yeah

394
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:47,360
Okay, so yeah bob it's on youtube. I don't know who's making it but bob gurr has a talk show

395
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:52,400
Yeah, I don't know. I don't know why I have not been uh watching this. I'll i'll check it out. Um,

396
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:58,160
Anyway, the uh, that's the man, uh john c stennis to get back to the ship

397
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:04,480
Uh, the name was approved by reagan on his way out of office like late in the second term

398
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:11,120
There's a lot of people now who want it to change due to his being a sure terrible segregationist and a racist man

399
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:19,680
However, there's some history of the ship that has nothing to do with any of this and that is the ship's participation in pearl harbor

400
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:27,200
Not the attack on pearl harbor, but the world premiere of pearl harbor held by the walt disney company

401
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:33,760
So this is weird. They must have filmed the scene for soren above the ship, uh late in in 2000

402
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,800
In preparation for california venture and then

403
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,440
may of 2001

404
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,600
pearl harbors

405
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:48,320
Landing in theaters everywhere. We got to celebrate. We got to go to pearl harbor of the ultimate pearl harbor party

406
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:53,920
Uh, so hey, why don't we get that ship that worked out so well for us? Well, it is in san diego. That's fine

407
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:00,400
Why don't let's uh have them take it all the way to pearl harbor, which they did it took five days

408
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:05,440
Yeah at the military's expense wow, really they paid yeah, well, but they would

409
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:10,960
Probably because the military probably gave them money for making pearl harbor. I'm guessing

410
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:15,920
Yeah, it's probably breaking. Yeah, it's one of those things where like as long as it's favorable

411
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:20,640
The military will pay for certain parts of movies. Oh, did that happen sometimes?

412
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,320
I don't know that that's actually what happened with pearl harbor

413
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:27,600
But there's like uh, there's articles about it where like if a certain as long as you like say the right things in a movie

414
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:31,760
It's almost kind of like you're doing an ad, huh? I don't know if that's the pearl harbor

415
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,080
at the very least get like

416
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:42,320
military liaisons and tanks right they'll give you they'll loan you tanks and jets and stuff and maybe a base or two. I don't know

417
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,240
Well, maybe armageddon or something could have been one of the other, you know

418
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:52,400
Sure. Yeah, it's possible. Isn't there like there's like a big battle at the end of bed knobs and broomsticks, right?

419
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:56,640
Maybe the military helped with that. It's very possible a bunch of like inanimate objects

420
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:02,640
Maybe the military advised it's very possible. Yeah, remember, um

421
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:08,480
So the patty jenkins was gonna make rogue one the star wars. I'll never forget that

422
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:13,440
Do you remember the teaser where she got out of a jet? Like it was like it wasn't rogue one

423
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:19,040
It was a separate show or well, no film probably was it called rogue squadron? It's called it's rogue squadron

424
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:24,960
Something that does did not ever exist or like the x-wings the video there was a lot of rogue one

425
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:30,960
Rogue squadron video game rogue squadron was of course the group of x-wings. Yes. And of course jason

426
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,760
Do you think I don't remember patty jenkins with the roller blades?

427
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:40,880
On the military base with the jet talking about why she's making rogue squadron only for it to be cancelled within a few weeks

428
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:44,880
Or something maybe not a few weeks. But uh, yes, of course, and then there's a rumor

429
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:49,200
It was back a couple weeks ago, but then somebody said no, it's not back. Oh, it's back and it's a trilogy

430
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:51,280
No, wait, it exists less than ever

431
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:58,160
It's very similar to like there's some you know, I like the first captain marvel movie, but there's some very like

432
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:00,780
blatant air force propaganda

433
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:07,600
It's like why what is that? Why why do we need to see them getting out of jets with cool jet stuff? Yeah

434
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:12,720
Top gun obviously has a good relationship. Yeah, that's all

435
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,960
I mean, it's you know

436
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,440
I with top gun two i'm trying to think

437
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:22,320
Well now they know I saw it I saw it and I like yeah, they did the movie remember if you saw it

438
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:25,840
Right in baby time. This is like a month after baby. I watched top gun two

439
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:31,600
Yeah, this is movie in this theater on a in at home at home. All right. Well, that's a more forgettable

440
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:36,720
Yeah, yeah. Oh, I saw it at city walk. Yeah, the thunder of the jet. I wish I was having a baby

441
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,680
But they did they did the smart bring her

442
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:44,400
They did the smart movie thing where it's like we're the good guys and we need to

443
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,440
We need to fly a mission against the baddies

444
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,800
Like the smartest thing ever. Yeah, not saying who the baddies are. Very generic. Uh-huh. Uh-huh

445
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:57,600
So yeah, so they could have been aliens for we don't even we don't even see human heads under those helmets

446
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,960
We don't know who the hell's in here

447
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:04,320
Did walt ever get the military to move a giant ship somewhere for some sort of promotional reason? I wonder

448
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:10,240
Like back in walt's day. It was on the to-do list probably they were satisfying 20 000 leagues or something

449
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,920
Do they have any subs?

450
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:18,640
Oh, I remember what I wanted to ask. Is this an active aircraft carrier? Is it decommissioned? I believe it's active

451
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,800
Okay, at least it was at the time. Yeah

452
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:27,040
But you know, it was not active on the night of the premiere in 2001 where it hosted such

453
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:33,220
Hollywood luminaries as ben afleck alec baldwin tom sizemore dan ackroyd

454
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:37,840
Courtney love lots of actual veterans and of course byron allen

455
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:42,160
Hell yeah, he's not in the movie, right? I've never seen pearl harbor actually

456
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:46,320
I don't think there's a byron allen. I don't know but maybe you know, I could play a general or yeah

457
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:50,480
No, I know that would have actually have been like I would have put that to the top of the queue if he's is

458
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,480
He acted in something. Um

459
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,640
Don't know that's a good question. Uh, uh, maybe in the early days. Yeah

460
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:59,760
Um, I know I did well something to dive into. Yep

461
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:05,760
Uh people are salivating for more byron allen. We will content. Yeah, my biggest question because it is funny that like

462
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:12,340
All right, hollywood head out to hawaii because we're having the pearl harbor party of a lifetime

463
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:19,520
And it did make it gave me a question on the way out the door, which is did the movie surfers go to the pearl harbor premiere?

464
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:24,880
Do you remember the disney channel movie surfers? Oh, no, I don't actually

465
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:28,960
Um, they're out of you know, it was like I don't know if any of them got famous or anything

466
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:35,280
But they were like, you know like they they'd send a bunch of uh, uh, cool confident teens to go cover movie premieres

467
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,680
Oh like red carpet like yeah

468
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:42,080
And I wonder if the movie I wonder if like the movie surfers ever did a you know

469
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,560
and we're and was it like a typical like

470
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:50,560
What's up guys psyched to be here with the great tom sizemore and we can't wait for pearl harbor

471
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,960
Did you know pearl harbor was based on real events?

472
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:59,680
Or did they acknowledge it and like hello everybody and welcome to a particularly somber movie surfers

473
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:05,280
Um, we're surfing a little slower today in honor of everyone who lost their lives on that fateful day

474
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,320
Did they ever do a touching tribute?

475
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:12,000
movie surfers on imdb lists from 97 to

476
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,560
2021

477
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,760
Do really it's a franchise is still it says jungle cruise

478
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:23,280
Like oh did movie surfers help promote the jungle cruise movie possibly

479
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:27,120
Wow, I haven't checked in in a while and I don't know what's on the disney

480
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:33,120
I don't know if the disney channel is just a test pattern today or I guess iqvc things are on it

481
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,280
I don't know. It's a home shopping thing

482
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:42,720
Um, yeah, it says episode guide on imdb 97 up like 97 episodes. Sorry of movie surfers

483
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,920
And this is what you're talking about. I can't imagine it's something different

484
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:52,960
but I it's got to be weirder today because at the time the surfing kind of referred to the

485
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:56,640
internet aspect of things that these are some like

486
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,280
tech confident to me

487
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,180
Who can go to?

488
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:08,400
Traditional movie premieres and post their findings on the internet where the fellow teens are you see what this says disney online podcast

489
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,480
Is there a movie online podcast?

490
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:16,800
Wow, and well like most uh film reviewing enterprises in america has

491
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:21,440
Movie surfers turned incredibly toxic and see the right wing. He probably

492
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:27,600
Would we if disney online podcast still exists I would leave forever dog in a second

493
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:33,360
I don't care. I will join disney online podcasts as long as they make the right offer

494
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,720
You know, well, I assure you they won't

495
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:42,480
Well, we gotta look at that famously cheap company the disney corporation

496
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:49,440
I'm sure each movie surfer was paid their their fair shake movie surfers is hard to search images only

497
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:53,680
Because you had to go through all the images and go like okay movie surfers

498
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:58,640
It's not johnny tsunami and it's not rip girl and it's not teen beach

499
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:02,720
And it's not teen beach, too. It's not a movie about surfers

500
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:07,760
Yeah, so they made a lot of a lot of beach movies movies really came back

501
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:14,320
So that's a famous ship. Yeah, it sure is. So yeah, don't just you know

502
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,120
Don't when you pass by that on the ride

503
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:20,320
Don't think that that was just involved in some like

504
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:24,720
Boring kind of like all right. This is going to be parked off the coast of guam or whatever

505
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,520
Right, you know thomas sizemore party bear

506
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:35,360
Dan ackroyd and presumably donna dixon had a blast that night probably that is also that

507
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:38,640
Feels like a very rich territory of like

508
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:45,760
Huh? I never really thought like who is this building named after like looking into like oh no

509
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,880
Yeah, I think um, well mccarran

510
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:57,040
The va the vegas airport is now harry reed airport and he was an okay guy because he really wanted to get those alien records out

511
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:02,960
But um the person was named before him mccarran. I think was a a bit of a nut job

512
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:09,280
Well, I think it's fair to say that if you if you are in a big expensive seeming building

513
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:12,640
With the name of a man on it. It's a bad man

514
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:17,280
Just a rule of thumb. I mean maybe not always good chance

515
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:25,040
Freeways if you're on if you're on a highway named after somebody, I don't know. That's uh, that's that's that's dicier

516
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,360
so maybe sometimes that's somebody who was

517
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:33,120
Killed on that stretch of road or said, you know that that one's iffier but the building

518
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:36,320
Definitely probably and and they're like that person

519
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:40,560
Uh murdered people and those bodies are buried in the basement of that building

520
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:46,160
Except for the john bon jovi rest stop in new jersey. Oh, yeah with all the

521
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:50,560
About the new jersey great residents charity work

522
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:58,240
He has his wine. We everybody likes hampton water. Everybody loves john bon jovi. Do you think everybody likes hampton water?

523
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:02,880
I assume they do. I've not tried. What was that based on? Let's back that let's source that

524
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,680
Well, let's not let's not source it

525
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:10,560
Well, what we should do is after that that chunk of info unless i'm missing anything

526
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:14,480
Uh, we should move on to the world. Yes, we're deep into it now. There was a lot

527
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,760
I feel like world gets hate

528
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:22,960
Most I think the cool opinion is to like california better. Yeah

529
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,280
and I

530
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:30,800
Slightly disagree. I think I like world but I think i'm just coming out hot here really interesting

531
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:35,760
I do think I like world better. Don't be mad at me. I know i'm throwing a lot of

532
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:39,760
Hardcore opinions around incendiary opinions today

533
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:43,920
But I think I like world better and I just want to put that on the table

534
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:47,600
Up front the only thing i've been mad at and I haven't had the wine

535
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:51,520
But my guess is that hampton water sucks. So i'm mad about that

536
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:56,480
Okay, but I just I should try it and know for sure that would just be we should do a hampton water episode

537
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:01,280
Um, well, all right, I should I should have let that I you know what you should have left that back at the rest stop

538
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,440
The wrestling chant, uh, you fucked up

539
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:08,880
I was clear and then I went backwards. No, no, no, I wasn't even thinking about an episode

540
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,200
I was going to say get some hampton water

541
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:18,560
For the uh, feek soren episode, but I didn't consider a whole exploration of the world of hampton water

542
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:22,000
Again, I think you know, I think we were I think we were fine where we were

543
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:26,720
I was saying it as something I was mad about incendiary opinion wise this one

544
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,400
I don't know. You know what I was going to come in with and it's less hot of a take

545
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:34,960
I think I would still vote california over world, but I think that

546
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,880
being

547
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:42,800
Mad at world. I don't quite relate to yeah, I don't think that I don't think that it's bad

548
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:48,160
I think we will talk about things that we don't like as much and maybe mike will disagree with those things

549
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:52,560
But I yeah would I vote for california over worlds definitely

550
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:58,560
But i'm not upset if I get to one of these and it's world. Yeah

551
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:04,800
Um, yeah, I don't know jason. What do you think? Um, I think I lean towards scott's opinion

552
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:08,560
I I I like california better. I think

553
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:13,040
I don't know if that's just the inclination of like

554
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,480
Well, it's it's much more

555
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:22,320
I don't know. It's shot on film and it went to those locations now. I did see the

556
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:27,440
Sizzle reel on the disney youtube channel of the helicopters

557
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:33,840
Flying over the world locations. They did it wall. They drove. They drove the helicopter the big wall

558
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:39,440
This is this is the most dismissive tone i've ever heard. They did it. They did incredible shot

559
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,440
He sounds like he's putting it out

560
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:44,240
They took a camera to the great wall of china

561
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:47,360
Wall of china, but this was hand-drawn animation. It was so

562
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,520
This is a beautiful shot. It's incredible. It's beautiful shots

563
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,960
There are some like there's some more cgi. There's some episode one level wipes

564
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,040
There's some episode one level

565
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:03,040
Transitions the wipes are my biggest issue

566
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:10,020
Yeah, I would say and just as as a reminder of what we're talking about the the first version sorenover california

567
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,880
You go to all these different locations

568
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:17,600
And I remember before I went on it thinking how do you transition from one to the other and it's just hard cuts

569
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:21,920
There really aren't transitions here. They decided to do these kind of digital

570
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:26,960
Stitch work moments where they find something like what's the one?

571
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:28,640
where

572
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:33,360
Um, why am I blank? What is it? That's something turns into balloons, correct?

573
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:39,760
Uh, what is what is it? That's around that then because oh it's the top of the taj mahal

574
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,360
Right, yes

575
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:46,640
The rounded shape of the top of the taj mahal becomes balloons in monument valley, right?

576
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:52,160
I look at those and think stupid the transitions are the silliest part to me

577
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:55,600
I think it's shocking how well the hard cuts work

578
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:59,840
In the original I forget if I said this in part one, but it reminds me of

579
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:06,320
How in many christopher nolan films if you see it in imax format?

580
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:12,400
It shifts back and forth giant sequences are shot imax which has a different size of frame

581
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:16,320
Than the rest of it and I remember the first probably dark knight

582
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:22,000
I was like, how's that going to work and it's just hard cuts and works fantastic. There's no it's so simple

583
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:27,680
They don't he doesn't need to do some weird morph between scenes. It's kind of crazy. You might you might not even notice it

584
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:33,680
It's so subtle and I think that's what I think something about the size of the room

585
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:41,360
Enables that where it's just so I don't know you're playing in such with such broad strokes that you can just do cuts that

586
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:47,440
That sweeping and sudden but yeah, uh, I don't know should have just been hard cuts

587
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,840
That is my probably my biggest qualm. I think but i'll say something

588
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:58,560
Uh, very positive. I think one of my favorite theme parks since like pumped into the ride

589
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:01,040
Is that sort of fruity?

590
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:05,520
Florally when you you fly over a fiji

591
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:10,480
That scent and it's I I believe in

592
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:13,280
It's in flight a passage, too

593
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:18,560
Um, which was refreshing. It's very refreshing cool

594
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:25,280
That magic candle company that sells different scents based on rides even as a note on the like

595
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,000
flying over fiji scent like this is very similar to the

596
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:34,720
Banshee flight scent like so i'm like, okay

597
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:40,080
Uh, it's a it's a really great scent. That is something that I would put in the

598
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,000
world's

599
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:47,600
Side of this debate. I think that while you know, we did us we did the fake smell final four

600
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:50,060
and I think that the

601
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:55,200
Citrus smell from california made it very far not the final but to the final two

602
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:00,720
Um, so I think that is the height of the good smell the orange smell

603
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:03,760
Yeah, uh is is the best of all of these smells

604
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:09,840
However, I think overall if you're averaging all of the smells and the innovation of the smells

605
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:13,540
I think the world smell game is better than california

606
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:18,880
Is that possible even though the best smell is in california? That's a good question because I really like

607
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:24,800
Fiji. Yes, I really like taj mahal. Yeah, I really like not really like I

608
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:32,480
I'm fine. I adore africa. I adore africa grass. Yeah, uh, I know I like it. I don't know

609
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:37,600
Um, I agree with I you know, I think you're right. I think you're right that the winner is in the fur in california

610
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:42,080
But uh overall what's the other one in california is like pine in the

611
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:48,080
There or is it is there a malibu? I've already forgotten. Did you say is there milk?

612
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:51,920
Malibu is there milk? Yeah, is there a milk smell?

613
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:55,680
Is it the part where they get a baby formula?

614
00:45:56,080 --> 00:46:01,120
Out of the rye when there's a nasty ass milk you drive by that you drive you drive by in the sky

615
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:04,080
By those cows and you smell milk remember that scene

616
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:06,080
um

617
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:10,160
Yes, the scents very good real quick scott back to your point of the transitions. I

618
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:13,920
I get why they were like, ah the they bother

619
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:19,840
Me a little bit in the first one. I could see that bothering somebody but what they did the way they did it

620
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:25,760
It's like there's a kite is a transition to another scene and the kite is so like cgi and fast

621
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:30,640
Yes, and takes you out of it because I think the hard cuts they were probably thinking like well

622
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:36,160
I don't want it to be so jarring that it takes people out of wherever they're immersed in whatever scene it is

623
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:40,000
but I feel like it maybe had the opposite effect because they did such like

624
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:47,760
Whimsical style cuts. Yeah with like a little like flourish with like a kite cuts you right to the next thing and it doesn't

625
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:53,920
It's it's more jarring and it takes me out of it more that one is jarring a simple fade

626
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,240
I think would have achieved what they

627
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:00,560
the best one to me is is uh from I believe

628
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:02,560
Fiji to

629
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:08,080
Iguazu the waterfalls. Yeah, that's the closest to a fit. That's just like matching the perspective

630
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:12,240
Right speed of the water. Yeah, and that one works pretty good to me

631
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:16,720
It almost like feels like an effect of the mist or something. Yeah, where as opposed to

632
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:22,960
Kite kite kite hurry up. Get up there. Wipe the scene. Hurry go right and like the desperately quick

633
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:29,840
Yes, they all feel too quick too. Just like the plane that like flies at you and transition coming in

634
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:31,200
It's too quick

635
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,200
It feels unnatural

636
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:38,160
Like it takes your brain out of it too because your brain goes. Oh, that's not real. That's not real the golf ball

637
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:40,640
I think tricks people still maybe if it's your first time

638
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:42,640
You go, oh

639
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:48,560
It's not until like the last five frames. Do you realize that that is fake like it's kind of done

640
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:50,320
Yeah, it's it's small enough

641
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:55,760
You know, it's like a small enough little detail that they get away with it as opposed to yes

642
00:47:56,160 --> 00:48:01,920
Like a a sky captain in the world of tomorrow playing flying into your face

643
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:07,520
Right out of nowhere. It wasn't visible in the frame. It's not like it even crept up fast. It's just like

644
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:10,800
I'm here. I gotta what to do. Here we go. Yeah, so so

645
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:12,800
Yeah, I

646
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:17,360
They would have been better if they just did like a transit like a star wipe. It would have been better

647
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:20,240
Now we're talking. Yeah. Yes. Yeah

648
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:24,260
Um, that's I mean it might have been more appropriate for california

649
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:30,480
To tribute not so much the film industry as the the public access video in yes

650
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:36,640
You know what the porn industry it'd be a subtle way to nod to the pornography made in the san fernando valley

651
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:44,080
To do star wipes and page peels. Yeah page peels. They should page peel every scene to the next

652
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:45,600
To the next place

653
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:51,680
I'd like to ask somebody re-edit soren and put in all all of the great wonderful wipes out there blinds the ones that are like

654
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:59,120
Yeah, like venetian blinds suddenly. I know split the screen into 14 parts the old like final cut express

655
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:02,880
Like things I use in college. Yeah, any of those perfect

656
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:07,680
Yeah, when you see those when you're getting ready to edit something well they have them here

657
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:09,920
Am I supposed to not use them?

658
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:15,360
Why would I I wouldn't be taking advantage of the program that I have possibly borrowed but possibly

659
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:19,280
Burned from the one copy that's going around this entire school

660
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:19,920
Yeah

661
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:27,600
That all all 100 people editing on are on the backs of this one set of cds and then like is it harder or easier to steal?

662
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:30,720
Editing software now. I'm not sure

663
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:37,680
Uh, i'm i'm a i'm a sucker in a dope and I pay the subscription for the adobe

664
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:41,760
Products and i'm positive. There is a way to because that's you know

665
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:45,040
It used to be that you'd buy a cd and now you have the program forever

666
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:53,440
They figured out that the money is in you never fully have it you pay them forever to have these products

667
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:56,880
It's a monthly subscription in which you get nothing new

668
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:59,360
That's like streaming services

669
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:05,600
Well, at least you get new shows. I guess that's you know, this is just you get to continue to have adobe audition

670
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:08,480
Uh, this is a dry point

671
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:09,680
But it's a it's a silly thing

672
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:14,960
I am positive that there is a way that I could hack my way to not paying this company anymore

673
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:19,840
Uh, but i'm just too good of a boy to go figure it out. I meant um

674
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:26,720
I meant in colleges. Is it easier with like, um we transfer and dropbox?

675
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:28,880
and google drive to just

676
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:34,960
Send someone the driver. It's you just have to have the code to like unlock a piece of software, right?

677
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:41,120
So I don't know how I do remember getting like a cd that was burned of some software and then people being like try one of

678
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:43,120
These 15 codes

679
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:46,960
And see if one of them works. Yeah, and i'm like, I don't know how you got these codes

680
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:51,520
But I will try them and then one would work. This is too much editing talk. Sorry. Sorry

681
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:54,320
But it is a lot of I mean

682
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:59,920
Editing plays such a big part in both easy tracks. Oh, yeah. Yes. There we go

683
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:04,720
Yeah

684
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:06,720
We did all just point at jason a lot

685
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:11,440
I've never been more frightened when someone was agreeing with me. No, no, that was us going. Yes

686
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:12,160
Good good good

687
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:17,520
You did transition us back into that was a transition as smooth as those in soren around the world

688
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,280
A seamless morph as if done by a quick moving plane

689
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:29,120
Editing does play such a big part in both of these things both of these sets of footage

690
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:33,040
But it this I feel like

691
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:35,760
around the world

692
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:40,660
Is a good reminder of like oh, yeah editing is so subjective

693
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:48,080
But you know something is wrong like like instinctively people whether they know editing or not they

694
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:50,800
Either they know when to go like

695
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:53,760
Or when they're like, oh, I don't really care about that

696
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:55,360
Well, you know what?

697
00:51:55,360 --> 00:52:01,280
I mean, yeah speaking as an editor it is true that like I mean, I think what I like to avoid

698
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:04,720
Is something that's so fast that it takes you out of it

699
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:05,120
Yeah

700
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:11,360
That like I don't like either it's got to be slow and graceful enough that you kind of like transition into it and accept it

701
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:15,760
Or there's just nothing there and I think that is the problem with some of these that play

702
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:21,360
I think if the plane took two seconds and not yeah point zero zero two

703
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:28,080
Uh, yeah, it's just uh, it's too fast. It's very jarring. Um, let's talk about uh stuff

704
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:33,840
In it though. Yeah, uh, and that's that's really what I mean something you'd have to give it up for this ride

705
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:35,840
Is that you do see?

706
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:38,480
um incredible sites that they

707
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:42,240
broadened the horizon of

708
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:46,720
What they can where they can take these cameras where they can take us

709
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:50,480
Using this technology not that camera rio wasn't great

710
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:56,160
We could have stayed in camera rio forever and looked at citrus groves forever and it would have been fine

711
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:59,520
We didn't even get to the outlet malls of camera rio

712
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:05,680
Uh, well, well that look that's a saga you're talking about. So we'll deal with that. Uh for many many days

713
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:11,200
2037 um, but yes you get to go

714
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:17,200
You know like just to sites that you will you may never get to see in your life and certainly not from

715
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:23,680
This particular perspective. So I think you got to give it up for this global version for uh, you know

716
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:30,000
Doing that for being like a genuine sightseeing adventure. Yeah, and the scope. Yeah, it definitely feels like oh

717
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,680
It's the bigger sequel. It feels the scope is bigger now and we're getting to do

718
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:35,440
It's just like the other one

719
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:39,680
But now we're really exploring the world like it does I feel like they

720
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:42,960
They made good on the they made good on the premise literally

721
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:47,440
It's soaring around the world, but it just it feels like the sequel in a way

722
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:49,920
Like it feels like they've upped the ante

723
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:53,520
Definitely. Yeah. Yeah. Um, so these start popping up in

724
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:56,080
2016

725
00:53:56,080 --> 00:54:00,900
And epcot had started showing the california version

726
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:06,980
Which at the time it felt a little bit strange, but of course now whenever they bring back california, everybody's like fuck

727
00:54:06,980 --> 00:54:10,580
Yeah, I think it's just you just got to keep that but you just got to like slot them in and out

728
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:14,260
Yeah, it's easy enough. You know, yeah, then it keeps excitement up for both of them

729
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:17,620
You get a break so that you can come back with open arms. Yes

730
00:54:18,260 --> 00:54:23,380
Although like maybe I kind of feel like it should just be california forever in california. Oh, really?

731
00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:25,780
You know what? Yeah. Oh, okay, because it's special

732
00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:28,660
They know it's now it's location specific and you got to go to

733
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:33,700
You got to travel the world to go to the world ones. That might be where i'm landing. Okay

734
00:54:33,940 --> 00:54:37,620
Yeah, I disagree but I would like it back and forth

735
00:54:37,860 --> 00:54:43,220
I don't know what a good distribution of months would be because like that's a whole we always have that are in custody

736
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:46,500
Yeah, because like obviously the whole debate over haunted mansion

737
00:54:46,660 --> 00:54:50,260
How many months should the overlay be and we all have opinions?

738
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:53,780
I think we all want a little less ideally sure of the overlay

739
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:58,340
But yeah, I half and half would be good for me even though I prefer world I think

740
00:54:58,980 --> 00:55:03,540
Yeah, I would I would accept half and half. Yeah every other month or six months six months

741
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:07,700
I think I think we're asking a lot of them to do the every other month. Yeah, I think so

742
00:55:07,860 --> 00:55:12,420
I mean it is interesting to see the switch over only took like

743
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:16,500
A day or two. Yeah, they didn't shut this down for a long time

744
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:20,260
No, I don't think it takes that long. No, I I think

745
00:55:21,220 --> 00:55:26,340
Um, all right fine six three months three months three months three like switch over every three months

746
00:55:26,580 --> 00:55:32,660
Well, I kind of like the way they do it a california adventure of when the food and wine festival starts in the new year

747
00:55:32,980 --> 00:55:36,900
Oh, and then they bring back california sure. Yeah, that's good

748
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:41,060
It's like they were they were also doing that. It's like uh food and wine

749
00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:48,980
We're bringing back that we're gonna have a very small room where you can watch seasons of the vine or narrated by germy irons

750
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:53,380
Germy you did call him germy. Oh, excuse me. Jeremy

751
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:59,620
Is it? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, okay. It was just the way you you know what I know, you know, his name is germy. I I

752
00:56:00,740 --> 00:56:04,180
Was blanking on his name until the last second. Oh, okay

753
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:12,180
And I was like, I don't think it was narrated by max von seidel, but I know it's one of the older actors

754
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:18,340
And then I remember germy irons. You were I thought you were saying you were wondering if it was uh, pepo irons

755
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:20,580
It's pepo irons

756
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:27,780
No, I thought max von seidel is going to narrated as death as his character from the seventh seal

757
00:56:27,940 --> 00:56:32,660
He's got to be I mean he's passed away, but he's got to be 40 years older than germy irons, right?

758
00:56:32,980 --> 00:56:34,340
He was an old guy

759
00:56:34,340 --> 00:56:38,900
That's true got about I mean germy irons probably seven years old. I don't know. We don't talk about this. Yeah

760
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:43,940
We really do. We do not over talking about next on site. Uh, uh, let's talk about these things

761
00:56:44,020 --> 00:56:47,620
Okay, so I think you know what? I think it's a uh, a really excellent first

762
00:56:48,260 --> 00:56:51,060
Moment, I think the the original one set the bar

763
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:56,660
That the the first thing you see really has to make you gasp because it's golden gate bridge and the first one

764
00:56:56,980 --> 00:56:58,980
And here you're looking at the matterhorn

765
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:04,340
Yeah, real matterhorn at the border of italy and switzerland in the swiss alps

766
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:08,660
I also think it's kind of neat this activates the like

767
00:57:09,220 --> 00:57:15,220
Uh genuine disney dork side of me that I think it's neat that this is one of several

768
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:19,460
Little nods to disney attractions within the world

769
00:57:20,740 --> 00:57:27,780
Right experience. Yeah, I completely agree and this is the type of reference to disney and the company that I like on soren

770
00:57:28,580 --> 00:57:32,260
This is not showing his cartoon is tinkerbell flying

771
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:34,740
but this is a little

772
00:57:34,740 --> 00:57:37,940
this thematically makes sense and then you can turn to

773
00:57:38,740 --> 00:57:44,820
A partner of some kind and go by the way, did you know this is a little reference to the matterhorn over in

774
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:51,300
We're looking at matt. I like this tone. We're looking at matt. That's real matterhorn as opposed to the fake matterhorn in park

775
00:57:51,860 --> 00:57:55,700
That's a clever. It's clever. It's clever. You're hitting you're hitting you gotta get right in

776
00:57:56,340 --> 00:58:00,340
Hey, hey dig into their legs. Could you shut up? We waited an hour for them

777
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:03,540
I'm like you're hugging you're holding a pencil

778
00:58:04,020 --> 00:58:09,700
Stop just stop stabbing my knee with that pencil on my yellow strap. You're tugging on my yellow strap

779
00:58:09,780 --> 00:58:12,180
It's gonna pull the seatbelt out. Are you trying to undo it?

780
00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:16,020
I can't just until you acknowledge this is cool

781
00:58:16,740 --> 00:58:22,500
This is a good reference. I will tighten this and tighten this for the rest of the ride until you tell me this is cool

782
00:58:23,140 --> 00:58:27,220
Has anyone tugged on the yellow strap so hard that they pulled the whole seatbelt out?

783
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:29,780
Like the strongest world's strongest man

784
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:32,100
Like it's maybe somebody

785
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:36,900
Google it. Oh my god. Yes, mike. It happened the entire row

786
00:58:37,140 --> 00:58:39,780
All of the rest of whom were children under five years old

787
00:58:40,420 --> 00:58:43,780
He was taking around as part of a make-a-wish foundation arrangement

788
00:58:43,860 --> 00:58:46,900
Wow, they all felt and they were all on the top row too. Oh my god

789
00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:49,220
Well, I was talking about before takeoff

790
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:56,180
So that's crazy to hear that I was just imagining a row of american gladiators all on soren

791
00:58:56,740 --> 00:58:59,860
And they tugged on the yellow strap and they ripped the seatbelt right out

792
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:06,820
They were all chanting matterhorn right matterhorn and so excited that they were yanking and yanking and the whole thing fell apart

793
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:12,260
So yeah, if you're a pro wrestler or an american gladiator, do not tug on that yellow strap too hard

794
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:14,500
Know your own strength turbo

795
00:59:15,780 --> 00:59:19,700
Um, I yes, I love the matterhorn reveal and it's a little

796
00:59:20,180 --> 00:59:23,060
We can talk about how the way like depending on where you are how the

797
00:59:23,540 --> 00:59:25,860
Some of these images are a little curved and a little

798
00:59:26,260 --> 00:59:30,820
Well, this is some of the and I know why is it now it happens at the golden gate bridge

799
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:32,500
It's part of the first one too

800
00:59:32,580 --> 00:59:37,460
But I and I don't know why it is more of a problem in the world version it just is

801
00:59:37,780 --> 00:59:42,020
I don't know what's going on. I know I don't know exactly either

802
00:59:42,820 --> 00:59:45,060
But if you're sitting in the right spot

803
00:59:45,620 --> 00:59:50,020
Yes, it's so fun. It's so cool. I love this reveal not to jump around too much

804
00:59:50,260 --> 00:59:55,380
Sure, I am convinced. I mean the the in this particular ride film where it is

805
00:59:55,380 --> 00:59:59,780
The biggest problem is clearly the eiffel tower. Of course. Yeah, I think you have to be

806
01:00:00,260 --> 01:00:03,540
Front row center you have to be dead in the middle maybe top

807
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:08,420
Maybe all three. Yeah, maybe all three's okay. Maybe all the centers are fine, but there are certain

808
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:10,660
angles

809
01:00:10,660 --> 01:00:13,860
from which it seems like the

810
01:00:14,580 --> 01:00:19,780
Eiffel tower is going into some kind of warp tunnel like it is being sucked into a black hole

811
01:00:20,580 --> 01:00:22,660
It is it is it is you might say

812
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:28,020
Unrecognizable as the eiffel tower a building that we all know goes straight up

813
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:31,620
Because sometimes you see it at a perfect c

814
01:00:32,260 --> 01:00:38,500
It's kind of crazy. It is is that do you think the high definition element of around the world?

815
01:00:39,140 --> 01:00:44,820
Do you think it's too clear and it's heightening the curve? Does that make sense though? I don't know

816
01:00:44,900 --> 01:00:50,340
I really don't I wish I could say one way or the other obviously if you're on the right or left like the

817
01:00:50,740 --> 01:00:54,340
Like the hard right or left like that's when it's like it warps more

818
01:00:54,660 --> 01:00:58,180
Is the screen curve it's because the screen is curved a little bit

819
01:00:58,660 --> 01:01:03,220
Where the screen didn't change? You know, you're right. That's the I I don't know all

820
01:01:03,700 --> 01:01:06,420
Maybe it's just maybe it would have happened more

821
01:01:06,980 --> 01:01:11,780
In the first ride film, but they you just don't look at as many tall pointy things

822
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:17,460
Maybe that's it. You're kind of more it's kind of more like landscapes, right? Yeah, and

823
01:01:18,100 --> 01:01:23,700
You know, it's pretty spectacular getting to go right up to that light on top of the eiffel tower

824
01:01:23,940 --> 01:01:25,780
It is a great moment

825
01:01:25,780 --> 01:01:30,180
But if you're in yeah, if you're down in the corner if you're in the basement of this ride

826
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:36,500
It is definitely a little weird. It's not weird enough to make me hate the ride. It is not however

827
01:01:36,980 --> 01:01:41,620
Um, but it's enough to make you curse eiffel in his foolish tower

828
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:46,340
Come up his cookies cotton has come up and see yet again

829
01:01:47,940 --> 01:01:51,560
Jason is now of course we haven't revealed the show he hates eiffel

830
01:01:54,020 --> 01:01:59,780
His famous tower why was why must history know his name and not mine? Carnegie would never

831
01:02:00,980 --> 01:02:02,980
Diddle daddle was such foolish

832
01:02:04,820 --> 01:02:06,820
Uh, jason, you should have your own tower

833
01:02:07,780 --> 01:02:10,020
Oh, I'd love to have a tower. Where would you have your tower?

834
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:13,060
Oh, I don't know

835
01:02:13,140 --> 01:02:19,700
Delaware county, pennsylvania outside of philadelphia. Okay, sounds good. And it's all my favorite spots tower of uh,

836
01:02:20,420 --> 01:02:21,860
hotcakes

837
01:02:21,860 --> 01:02:24,500
Oh and get some hotcakes in there, you know

838
01:02:24,740 --> 01:02:29,460
Just a tower of all the stuff you like kind of a big dagwood sandwich of all of your interests

839
01:02:29,460 --> 01:02:36,500
Tom jones diner that we used to go to after plays that smelled like cigarettes even after smoking doors was banned

840
01:02:36,740 --> 01:02:43,620
So that's in it. There's a diner in the tower in it sex hamburgers, uh bruster's ice cream

841
01:02:45,540 --> 01:02:50,340
All the great local landmarks bruster is franchised in in la now

842
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:55,860
In la very weird seeing a local, uh ice cream company. Yeah

843
01:02:56,980 --> 01:03:00,580
I do think I like they call the screen 180 degree dome screen

844
01:03:01,220 --> 01:03:05,060
So I think you're right that is like when you in that when it's like a dome screen

845
01:03:05,460 --> 01:03:09,860
It's if you have a long tall object. I just think it's like it's not gonna look right

846
01:03:10,180 --> 01:03:14,420
It's hard when you're coming at it from yeah, you're right. Yeah, it's being it's if it's being projected

847
01:03:15,300 --> 01:03:20,500
Curved well, I mean this this now begs a question and maybe I don't know if you can speak to this or not

848
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:23,460
But do you think that this kind of thing has been fixed?

849
01:03:24,740 --> 01:03:29,220
You know screen curvature wise at vegas's famous sphere same question

850
01:03:30,100 --> 01:03:36,180
Well, you know what? It's a good it's a good point. I have not seen the postcards show the the darin aronofsky show

851
01:03:37,140 --> 01:03:40,820
Um, I bet it hasn't I bet it's unable to be fixed

852
01:03:40,980 --> 01:03:46,820
But isn't but aren't there those moments like when you're in the tower of code that falls on you

853
01:03:47,140 --> 01:03:52,260
Yeah, uh in the u2 show, although that is that is now passed, but that's a part of the show

854
01:03:52,660 --> 01:03:58,740
Uh, but yeah, but isn't that but that's like you're that's something on a curved screen. That's that reads as

855
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:04,980
Uh straight lines like I feel like they're able to account for the curvature in a smart way

856
01:04:06,020 --> 01:04:08,820
Yeah, I guess that's true for that specific thing

857
01:04:08,820 --> 01:04:15,860
We're talking about which is when like a the whole sphere feels like it's a trash compactor of numbers coming down on you

858
01:04:16,340 --> 01:04:19,300
But I think it just looks I don't know. I it's a good question

859
01:04:19,380 --> 01:04:22,660
I don't think I think we'd have to play soren in sphere

860
01:04:23,300 --> 01:04:26,580
To know for sure which by the way is something they should do

861
01:04:26,660 --> 01:04:31,140
Let's do that. I postcards is kind of like that the darin aronofsky a lot of people have said is that yeah

862
01:04:31,700 --> 01:04:34,500
It's like a it's like a big sitting soren, right?

863
01:04:35,060 --> 01:04:38,580
So they should have had they should have had all the seats just be soren seats

864
01:04:38,820 --> 01:04:43,060
In this in sphere. Yeah, they did. Yeah, it is it is kind of crazy. They didn't make a move

865
01:04:43,460 --> 01:04:48,260
Yeah, yeah, it was probably on the drawing board, but 40 exit. This is I really shouldn't go on this tangent

866
01:04:48,340 --> 01:04:51,860
It's a lot of time, but I think I can do it quick. Um, I have to bring up when

867
01:04:52,580 --> 01:04:56,020
Uh, there was a lot of text threads going on during the grammys

868
01:04:56,500 --> 01:05:01,380
During the grammys there was a performance by u2 of their new song atomic city

869
01:05:01,940 --> 01:05:07,780
And it was kind of like a greatest hits a little bit of like all of the tricks of throughout their show

870
01:05:08,260 --> 01:05:14,580
Uh that like that, you know like all the many different projections that they would do throughout the the full run of the u2

871
01:05:14,980 --> 01:05:20,660
Sphere show and you expressed on a text chain mike that you were dissatisfied with the performance

872
01:05:20,820 --> 01:05:25,140
Yeah, because you felt that it misrepresented what was on the screen during atomic city, right?

873
01:05:25,220 --> 01:05:30,280
And I said what was on the screen during atomic city and you said I don't know I went to the bathroom

874
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:32,280
From

875
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:38,440
Well, all I know is that it wasn't the stuff they were showing because it was in other songs

876
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:41,080
We don't miss some of it might have been

877
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:42,520
Well

878
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:45,640
No, I don't think it was I just thought it was strange that you were defending

879
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:51,960
Atomic city's honor and here you were taking a piss all over it while you were actually there

880
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:57,080
Well, look, I guess you're right. They could have done a greatest hits of all the effects during atomic city

881
01:05:57,880 --> 01:06:03,560
But I bet I would bet a million dollars no way and that they used all the effects to make it look like

882
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:10,440
The number trash compactor was happening during atomic city. Let me ask just I mean you pay so much to go to these things

883
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:15,960
Um, do they have the projections on the toilet so you don't miss them

884
01:06:16,520 --> 01:06:22,680
In the 180 dome toilet screens, they should be projecting them down into the bowl. That's right

885
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:28,040
You know which works better if you're peeing then if you're into bono's mouth, basically

886
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:31,660
Well, you like have a live feed from his now. You're just being ridiculous

887
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:37,480
Being ridiculous, but uh to an effective end because I think that sounds really cool

888
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:40,120
I would love to pee into bono's mouth pee into

889
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:44,280
Pee on like tre Anastasia, whatever his last name is

890
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:50,440
Anastasia guitar not a musician of that caliber. Yeah, he's now bono. That's another

891
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:51,960
Thing

892
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:56,360
I fucked up. I can't think of tre's last name guys. I'm so sorry, but he's fished fished it for

893
01:06:56,920 --> 01:06:57,960
uh for

894
01:06:57,960 --> 01:07:02,360
Sphere shows that did the visuals looked awesome, too. Yes. Yeah, I I do

895
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:07,240
I I don't necessarily want to go to the shows, but uh, the visuals looked really awesome

896
01:07:07,320 --> 01:07:11,080
The big robot stuff and yeah, oh, yeah that robot looked really cool

897
01:07:11,080 --> 01:07:16,600
They really I feel like did uh did the homework and mainly they did not do any affronts to the

898
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:20,120
Memory of atomic city. No, not that I saw

899
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:23,800
But if like educate me, I don't know what happened at every show. Yeah

900
01:07:24,680 --> 01:07:29,880
Okay, we don't have to talk about everything in in all of these but let me just shout out some some scenes

901
01:07:30,580 --> 01:07:38,540
Greenland you're in a yeah world of ice bergs and ice patches your glaciers fjord

902
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,880
Uh east fjord greenland. I don't know if i'm saying that right

903
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:46,440
Uh, um, here is where we start getting a little nutty with our polar bears

904
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:50,840
Yeah, our transition whale we get a little a whale splash

905
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:54,360
That is one of the wipes and yeah, it's you know what?

906
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:59,080
I don't think you need it and now i'm going to be where you were with. Yeah tinkerbell

907
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:05,960
I think it's a little goofy. I agree with what jason said earlier. We're in canny. Yes, maybe maybe full cartoon

908
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:07,880
whales

909
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:09,720
uh, you know

910
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:12,360
Pyrocon was in it. Obviously i'd be very happy but besides that

911
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:16,840
Yeah, I don't think the animals themselves look bad

912
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:23,960
It's just like but you can tell again doing tricks. You're talking about editing. Yeah, it's just something's different

913
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:27,080
Something's wrong and I guess most guests probably wouldn't

914
01:08:27,620 --> 01:08:31,640
Articulate that afterward and it's all that was nice or whatever. But your brain is like

915
01:08:32,280 --> 01:08:34,280
That's not one of the chances

916
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:38,120
Yeah, you know what it all reminds me and I'm not that the cgi is

917
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:44,520
this bad but it activated the same it's the worst of it activates the same part of me as the

918
01:08:45,220 --> 01:08:47,220
monkeys in crystal skull

919
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:51,960
As well as the little is it like a a squirrel what pops up?

920
01:08:52,440 --> 01:08:55,560
That's really like a gopher a gopher like caddyshack gopher

921
01:08:56,280 --> 01:08:58,280
at the start of crystal skull

922
01:08:58,840 --> 01:09:02,600
And whatever face he makes is actually broader than the i'm all right dance

923
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:06,680
Yeah, it's actually sillier than caddyshack. There is like a squirrel cgi

924
01:09:07,240 --> 01:09:14,040
Yeah, or yeah go for cgi the start of crystal skull indiana jones and they these i'm just saying these animals would all be pals

925
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:20,280
I think I think that I think that the elephant throw in the grass would get along great with the indiana jones monkeys

926
01:09:20,680 --> 01:09:22,680
They're just all cut from the same cloth

927
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:27,640
Yeah, I it's it's just not my favorite and I think we're going to see a swing away from

928
01:09:28,440 --> 01:09:34,920
This sort of the need to like goofify it with cgi I think cgi is more effective when it's

929
01:09:36,040 --> 01:09:41,000
Realistic or you swing all the way and it's like very fantastical and right again uncanny valley

930
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:44,840
I think it's it's caught between I I don't know if you guys saw this like

931
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:49,660
It was just a short like how they did it but the david fincher

932
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:52,440
Uh netflix movie the killer

933
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:55,000
There is like he's riding a motorcycle

934
01:09:55,240 --> 01:10:00,280
Cycled through the city and I had no idea this was composite like it was

935
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:03,480
Some of it was cgi there. There are very

936
01:10:04,360 --> 01:10:08,840
Unique close-ups. I feel like and some of the riding through the city

937
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:16,200
Is cg and I I had no idea that's I think what it's and i'm sure there's a lot of there must be a lot of

938
01:10:16,340 --> 01:10:20,460
Effective invisible cgi in this ride that we just aren't noticing

939
01:10:20,940 --> 01:10:27,100
Um notably I always think about it in the disneyland parts where you're like what's past disneyland? I guess nothing

940
01:10:27,740 --> 01:10:33,500
What's up north of disneyland? Just a lot of black. I suppose. Let's not worry about whatever

941
01:10:33,900 --> 01:10:39,180
Office buildings and hotels we don't own up there. Yeah. Yes, so there's stuff like there

942
01:10:39,180 --> 01:10:42,060
Yeah, there's little like cleanliness things that they're doing

943
01:10:42,060 --> 01:10:45,980
I'm sure at all of these but that are that are more effective than like the the more showy

944
01:10:46,540 --> 01:10:51,340
Cgi like the plane in sydney, australia in the next part. That's I think the dumbest

945
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:56,700
I thought it was the animals, but I think that plane the plane is bad. There's a plane. I think it's

946
01:10:57,740 --> 01:11:01,340
Very dumb and takes away from uh sydney and that it's cool to be in that

947
01:11:02,060 --> 01:11:09,500
Part of the cg. Yeah, it kind of makes me think like it's like oh we need to put something dynamic in there and it's like

948
01:11:10,140 --> 01:11:12,140
Do you think whatever you?

949
01:11:12,780 --> 01:11:18,380
Edit in there is going to be more entertaining than uh the outback

950
01:11:19,260 --> 01:11:21,020
or the uh

951
01:11:21,020 --> 01:11:28,540
Mount kilimanjaro like yeah, the most majestic natural beauty you've ever seen it's like it's a little insecure

952
01:11:28,700 --> 01:11:32,780
Yeah, yeah, you know, maybe it's we might be looking at like notes here

953
01:11:32,860 --> 01:11:35,820
We might be looking at kind of like studio executive

954
01:11:36,540 --> 01:11:40,460
Like I don't know. I think you gotta hit them. I thought hey, it's 2016, baby

955
01:11:40,540 --> 01:11:46,460
The kids they some unfocused ran, but they play they play video games instead of seeing movies

956
01:11:46,780 --> 01:11:50,940
We gotta make this like a video game. What does that mean? I don't know. That's for you to figure out

957
01:11:51,340 --> 01:11:54,140
now, you know, it's like how magic is

958
01:11:54,780 --> 01:11:56,780
losing some of its

959
01:11:56,840 --> 01:12:02,400
Credibility as entertainment with movies and video games stealing kids attention

960
01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:09,580
You're kind of quoting the masked magician specials. Oh am I uh, which was the club three thing

961
01:12:10,620 --> 01:12:14,140
Check out club three check out the masked magician episode

962
01:12:14,780 --> 01:12:16,380
um, uh

963
01:12:16,380 --> 01:12:23,660
Now talking about natural beauty and a cool thing to see from a particular perspective. Uh, we see this bavarian castle

964
01:12:24,060 --> 01:12:27,180
Let me take a stab at pronunciation. Noishuan stein

965
01:12:28,140 --> 01:12:34,220
Noishuan stein castle in bavaria. Noishuan stein. Ah the eagle's nest hitler's lair

966
01:12:35,500 --> 01:12:37,500
Yep, you got it. It's not

967
01:12:38,460 --> 01:12:41,420
Yeah, so here is so history you're looking at the the castle where

968
01:12:45,020 --> 01:12:50,220
Soaring over hitler it's all famous hitler places you look closely you can see his rotting corpse

969
01:12:50,300 --> 01:12:52,300
Nobody ever went near it. Nobody touched it

970
01:12:52,700 --> 01:12:58,620
Uh shockingly well, but it's just a skeleton with a mustache on it cga. They cga skeleton in though

971
01:12:59,340 --> 01:13:01,340
They didn't put the real skeleton in there

972
01:13:02,220 --> 01:13:06,060
And it looks fake. Yeah. Well, I think it's really silly that it winks at you. Yeah

973
01:13:07,020 --> 01:13:10,860
Yeah, tinkerbell the tinkerbell carrying the skeleton

974
01:13:11,900 --> 01:13:13,260
At the end

975
01:13:13,260 --> 01:13:18,620
I see I know mike i'm gonna go on record. I think it's nice that tinkerbell is disposing of hitler's skeleton

976
01:13:18,620 --> 01:13:23,020
All right, you know, you're right. I like that hopefully going to drop it somewhere terry in a big pit of fire

977
01:13:23,100 --> 01:13:26,460
Somewhere where it'll never come back. I agree. Yeah. Yeah, I agree with that

978
01:13:27,500 --> 01:13:29,920
In a big pile of shit take it to a sanitation

979
01:13:31,100 --> 01:13:32,860
waste disposal place

980
01:13:32,860 --> 01:13:35,580
Uh, so the real history here is

981
01:13:36,460 --> 01:13:42,620
This is one of those disney nod things because here we are looking at the castle that most closely inspired

982
01:13:43,020 --> 01:13:46,620
Sleeping beauty castle cool. Tell your partner next to you

983
01:13:47,420 --> 01:13:50,780
Grab their thigh jab their legs bruise them

984
01:13:51,500 --> 01:13:57,820
If they leave the ride not blue and black on the leg then you have failed as a trivia provider, sir

985
01:13:57,900 --> 01:14:03,260
We're not going to let you use the single rider's line again if you keep accosting other guests

986
01:14:04,620 --> 01:14:06,940
I gotta do it to somebody with trivia with trivia

987
01:14:07,420 --> 01:14:09,900
This is a point in the ride and I I brought this up

988
01:14:10,380 --> 01:14:13,340
On this last soren episode and I think I completely forgot about it

989
01:14:13,580 --> 01:14:19,100
Because it's something I meant to bring up on other like big ride episodes is that there's a point in rides where

990
01:14:19,580 --> 01:14:21,740
Even if you're tired, you've been on the ride a lot

991
01:14:22,300 --> 01:14:27,660
The magic comes back you can feel that jolt and I would call it maybe like a magic point or something

992
01:14:28,060 --> 01:14:31,900
Where like even on the sleepiest day where you're not so into going on soren

993
01:14:31,900 --> 01:14:35,260
It's nine o'clock and you've been on soren a couple times this year. You're lucky. Whatever

994
01:14:35,740 --> 01:14:38,300
There's a point when you go. Mm. This is good. I'm back

995
01:14:38,780 --> 01:14:43,820
And I feel like it's the castle part of soren over the world really where i'm just like, yeah cool

996
01:14:43,900 --> 01:14:49,580
This feels cool. I feel immersed. It's cool to go around that castle. It looks like such an interesting part of the world

997
01:14:49,980 --> 01:14:52,140
Yeah, I don't ever see it because I don't travel

998
01:14:53,180 --> 01:14:56,700
But this is cool. Yeah, wait, no, no europe for either of you guys. Yeah

999
01:14:56,860 --> 01:15:02,860
I would like to go. Mm-hmm. And uh, well what you did, uh, you did japan. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, that's good

1000
01:15:02,940 --> 01:15:06,860
That's a good one. That's something. Uh, um, yes, there was a theme park in full

1001
01:15:08,220 --> 01:15:12,700
Well, I I mean, yeah, look i've i've also yeah, i've been to theme parks on all of my

1002
01:15:13,420 --> 01:15:19,180
of all any of my international travels, uh, uh, but um, yeah, you're looking at this you're also like

1003
01:15:20,460 --> 01:15:24,060
You know you're looking at this castle and you're like well this is and this makes me now

1004
01:15:24,060 --> 01:15:29,660
I have not you know, i've i've been to germany but this you know, this area what i'm looking at here

1005
01:15:29,660 --> 01:15:34,540
I'm like see why haven't I been here? This is great. This and this is like some real history

1006
01:15:34,540 --> 01:15:37,500
You know and I gotta get I gotta get out of my theme park mind

1007
01:15:37,580 --> 01:15:40,700
Yeah, and go see some real history like this castle

1008
01:15:40,700 --> 01:15:46,400
Which I can only assume is thousands of years old and is steeped in and then you look it up 1869

1009
01:15:47,100 --> 01:15:48,860
This is

1010
01:15:49,820 --> 01:15:52,220
Right around civil war this thing is built

1011
01:15:52,540 --> 01:15:54,060
It's really crazy

1012
01:15:54,060 --> 01:15:57,100
And this the the guy whose castle it is

1013
01:15:57,420 --> 01:16:04,540
I looked into king ludwig the second of bavaria who was married to jaja gabor

1014
01:16:06,140 --> 01:16:09,500
So that's prince von you're not far off. I was gonna say it's like that

1015
01:16:10,140 --> 01:16:11,900
It is like one of those weird

1016
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:16,860
Yes, like the you know when yeah when you're going to tour the liberace house or whatever and like and who are they?

1017
01:16:16,940 --> 01:16:23,100
They're a consulate to something. What is that? It's kind of like that because this was like a born into royalty

1018
01:16:23,980 --> 01:16:30,940
King who like I think didn't want to be doing it and was and got bored and shifty

1019
01:16:31,100 --> 01:16:33,900
And what can I do to make this interesting now?

1020
01:16:33,900 --> 01:16:40,940
the good end of this is that he was the main benefactor of richard vogner and like underwrote

1021
01:16:41,740 --> 01:16:47,260
Many of his works and a lot of other great like musical and theater works

1022
01:16:47,660 --> 01:16:52,940
So he like, you know get used his position to fund that kind of thing and also to fund like

1023
01:16:53,420 --> 01:16:59,100
Many fancy houses for himself despite already having the one right this what we're looking at in this

1024
01:16:59,660 --> 01:17:04,300
Ride is not a castle. He needed to have he was set on castles

1025
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:06,620
But just like had a lot of money to burn

1026
01:17:06,620 --> 01:17:10,620
But then he's like he's kind of like a michael jackson of his era because then he went broke

1027
01:17:11,660 --> 01:17:17,740
Like building more fancy stuff. Yeah, so he had no money to finance things like this that he did not

1028
01:17:18,220 --> 01:17:23,100
Need and he just like basically this guy he started to be known as the mad king

1029
01:17:23,820 --> 01:17:29,500
And wow he like that's the first stuff a professional wrestler known as the mad king

1030
01:17:29,740 --> 01:17:35,820
No, oh, yeah, but that's a nod perhaps perhaps a nod. I don't know. He's not quite doesn't sound like this guy

1031
01:17:36,540 --> 01:17:41,420
Um, he's really so yeah, I mean it's gay first. I'm like, why is this guy? What's wrong with him?

1032
01:17:41,500 --> 01:17:45,180
He's like, you know what? He's using his position of power to

1033
01:17:45,980 --> 01:17:47,500
to empower

1034
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:52,940
Uh great artists and architects much like the soon to be talked about again michael eisner

1035
01:17:53,420 --> 01:17:57,260
You know what? He's he's in this position to like leave his mark on the globe

1036
01:17:57,720 --> 01:18:02,460
Artistically by helping these other people as a benefactor. What's uh, and then you started reading more

1037
01:18:03,020 --> 01:18:04,380
I mean, he really only hurt himself

1038
01:18:04,380 --> 01:18:08,780
I feel like he started sleeping during the day and riding horses all night

1039
01:18:09,100 --> 01:18:13,980
He commissioned hundreds of plays that were for himself alone to watch

1040
01:18:14,460 --> 01:18:16,460
He would just sit in a room

1041
01:18:16,620 --> 01:18:19,100
Many many people on stage and then hooray

1042
01:18:19,980 --> 01:18:24,620
All right. Well, it's now it's uh, six a.m. Time for bed. Wow

1043
01:18:25,340 --> 01:18:29,020
He stopped talking. He communicated only in notes

1044
01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:31,500
Uh, you couldn't look him in the eye

1045
01:18:31,660 --> 01:18:33,980
Again, we're still i'm still feeling good about this. This is like prince

1046
01:18:34,060 --> 01:18:38,700
That's like the only he only he just asked other people to make the music and he didn't do it himself

1047
01:18:38,700 --> 01:18:44,380
Right, right. That's the memo steve harvey sent that out. That's a normal thing to do. Don't look me in the eye

1048
01:18:44,860 --> 01:18:48,700
You're busy. You've also outed yourself as a as a steve harvey supporter

1049
01:18:48,940 --> 01:18:53,740
And yeah, like i'd be a believer in everything that he does. Yeah, so he was just he was a steve harvey of his time

1050
01:18:54,140 --> 01:19:00,460
Um, but then ultimately it was the rampant spending and going into dead on castles and operas that he didn't need

1051
01:19:00,860 --> 01:19:03,820
Uh, which was the fuel to declare him legally insane

1052
01:19:04,220 --> 01:19:07,980
He was captured and deposed and taken to some kind of compound

1053
01:19:08,300 --> 01:19:13,420
Which had lots of bodies of water to prevent you from escaping if you had been declared insane

1054
01:19:13,580 --> 01:19:18,940
Like the marvel universe the raft or whatever like this super villain prison in the middle of the ocean

1055
01:19:19,660 --> 01:19:21,900
The i'm just talking about like a creek but

1056
01:19:23,020 --> 01:19:25,020
The rock I guess

1057
01:19:25,180 --> 01:19:27,900
And ultimately he's just like a this is just like an out of shape guy

1058
01:19:27,900 --> 01:19:30,700
He's probably not gonna make it out of the creek. So it's no it's not as cool

1059
01:19:30,780 --> 01:19:33,660
Yeah, yeah, it's not like trapping people in the middle of space. I see

1060
01:19:34,300 --> 01:19:39,980
Negative zone, but yeah, he no they didn't need that because I think immediately they took him there and then like two days later

1061
01:19:40,220 --> 01:19:43,980
He tried to escape and he drowned and it's unclear whether that was

1062
01:19:44,540 --> 01:19:49,660
Suicide or he just fully drowned or if it was a murder because there were maybe signs of

1063
01:19:50,140 --> 01:19:55,980
struggle, but then they said no that was him fighting the other guy and then he was he killed the guy and then

1064
01:19:57,180 --> 01:20:03,260
And then killed himself because of what and I think this is still in dispute whether uh, king ludwig

1065
01:20:03,740 --> 01:20:09,500
Died by suicide or was killed while trying to leave the combat. So the abstin of his day

1066
01:20:10,220 --> 01:20:12,220
The debate

1067
01:20:12,220 --> 01:20:14,220
The debate

1068
01:20:14,620 --> 01:20:17,180
Again, I didn't read the full history. Yeah, baby, you know

1069
01:20:17,660 --> 01:20:21,660
It's always safe to assume that there were a lot of bad things of that nature happening

1070
01:20:21,740 --> 01:20:26,300
But that didn't seem like the primary facet of this guy and I say good job

1071
01:20:27,660 --> 01:20:29,980
Paying for lots of plays that no one else got to see

1072
01:20:30,780 --> 01:20:33,660
Why is that right? This guy should not have been taken to this compound

1073
01:20:34,140 --> 01:20:36,140
Uh, he should not have been anywhere near this creek

1074
01:20:36,700 --> 01:20:41,420
Um, so anyway, yeah, that's all like pretty recent history at this castle

1075
01:20:45,500 --> 01:20:47,500
This was the summer home of a crazy man

1076
01:20:47,900 --> 01:20:48,700
Wow, yeah

1077
01:20:48,700 --> 01:20:55,020
Not that far just like only a couple decades before walt disney himself was born the magic and that's my magic point

1078
01:20:55,420 --> 01:21:00,060
That's the point where the magic of the ride will it's undeniable to me again

1079
01:21:00,620 --> 01:21:04,300
Yeah, because you feel the spirit of king king ludwig ludwig

1080
01:21:04,460 --> 01:21:11,260
Yes, madness gets you excited. It's got the bavarian monarchists in the show. They're gonna be pretty pissed at you

1081
01:21:12,940 --> 01:21:16,300
There's a few of them he's casting doubt on the ludwig story

1082
01:21:17,580 --> 01:21:24,300
Let's drown him at once and make it look like suicide. Do you know good bavarian voice probably? Yeah, it seems like right. Uh, I don't know

1083
01:21:24,300 --> 01:21:25,580
I don't know what i'm talking about

1084
01:21:25,580 --> 01:21:29,980
Um, I wonder like is the castle like is it tourist available?

1085
01:21:30,060 --> 01:21:34,540
Like can you because it's giant so you can do a tour of it. I believe so interesting

1086
01:21:34,620 --> 01:21:35,820
Yeah, I don't know that for sure

1087
01:21:35,820 --> 01:21:39,660
I just I assume you're assuming think about you know what you're looking at that shot on the ride and you're like

1088
01:21:39,980 --> 01:21:46,060
This is going to involve a lot of climbing or at least a shuttle that's going to really sputter on the way up there

1089
01:21:46,460 --> 01:21:50,540
Here on the ride. I just get to enjoy this and then i'm on to the next place

1090
01:21:50,540 --> 01:21:54,940
Well, that's what the whole joy of going to theme parks that transport you to places in the real world

1091
01:21:55,100 --> 01:21:59,740
That's the whole thrill of it. That's right knock stuff off. You go back out then you go out all that

1092
01:22:00,620 --> 01:22:02,300
and the headache

1093
01:22:02,300 --> 01:22:08,620
But wouldn't it be nice if there was like a like a little mini mall outside of the king ludwig castle like a like a city walk

1094
01:22:08,940 --> 01:22:13,500
And then the way that you discovered that there was like an abbey or was there an abbey road city?

1095
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:16,140
Oh, yeah, I forgot what it was called. Yeah, it was like liver walk or something. Yeah

1096
01:22:17,100 --> 01:22:18,780
Liverpool city walk

1097
01:22:18,780 --> 01:22:20,780
beetles themed everything

1098
01:22:21,260 --> 01:22:24,380
Um, I don't know. Well, you know like I mean there's truth

1099
01:22:24,620 --> 01:22:31,020
I mean vatican city is surrounded by the shittiest shopping district you've ever seen in your life. So very possibly

1100
01:22:31,260 --> 01:22:38,540
Um, yeah, no there there could very well be ludwig walk. They just disney just scrubbed that out. It's vatican city like

1101
01:22:40,060 --> 01:22:42,700
It's buying indulgences, right?

1102
01:22:43,340 --> 01:22:47,580
It's buying like groceries and stuff. I mean, I think that's part of it

1103
01:22:47,660 --> 01:22:51,580
So a hard rock cafe is there like I think it's I think I think it's all yeah

1104
01:22:51,580 --> 01:22:56,780
I think yeah, I mean not too far is I definitely saw the one in rome but vatican city specific

1105
01:22:56,780 --> 01:22:58,780
I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if you're looking at like

1106
01:22:59,260 --> 01:23:01,260
uh poorly photoshoped

1107
01:23:01,340 --> 01:23:03,340
T-shirts of the pope hanging out with tupac

1108
01:23:04,620 --> 01:23:07,340
I feel like it was that level next to a chipotle

1109
01:23:08,220 --> 01:23:11,600
Because I mean you gotta eat my infinite blessings to you deadpool

1110
01:23:14,860 --> 01:23:16,940
It's gotta be deadpool has to be within

1111
01:23:17,580 --> 01:23:19,340
200 feet of the vatican

1112
01:23:19,340 --> 01:23:25,180
It's on like a shirt or like it's pretty trashy pretty clearly. Yeah, it's gotta be I think so

1113
01:23:25,260 --> 01:23:28,940
I'm gonna look up pope and deadpool just while in case there's any

1114
01:23:30,300 --> 01:23:31,660
Let's see

1115
01:23:31,660 --> 01:23:36,220
Uh, well, there's pictures of there's somebody who like mashed them up who was a who was a pope deadpool

1116
01:23:36,460 --> 01:23:43,020
Well, of course, I like that costume. All right. So there's yes. Hey in keeping with the spirit of the man himself

1117
01:23:43,580 --> 01:23:46,300
Um the man deadpool and so in deadpool's name

1118
01:23:46,940 --> 01:23:49,280
Jimmy changa, jimmy wade wilson

1119
01:23:50,460 --> 01:23:52,460
Uh, I think you gotta

1120
01:23:52,780 --> 01:23:58,780
Kill him in jaro after this. Yeah, tanzania elephants. I like that. As I said, I like the smell here

1121
01:23:58,860 --> 01:24:05,420
I like the smell the grass. This is grass that I like and uh, it's good grass and then

1122
01:24:05,740 --> 01:24:08,780
Uh, but digital anime, I don't know. They aren't all so bad

1123
01:24:09,340 --> 01:24:14,060
They're running elephants is good. They're close to you and they're better than

1124
01:24:14,940 --> 01:24:20,220
Lion king slash mufasa coming to theaters end of year. That's true. But what isn't better?

1125
01:24:21,260 --> 01:24:27,180
True. I mean of all all art on earth. What isn't better than the new lion king questions?

1126
01:24:27,420 --> 01:24:32,700
I'll get look I haven't seen mufasa yet. Maybe mufasa takes it to another level. I don't know. Yeah

1127
01:24:33,180 --> 01:24:37,660
Well, very yeah, barry jenkins says it's about empathy. So there you go

1128
01:24:37,980 --> 01:24:43,260
So if you want, all right, if you want a movie about empathy mufasa is the place for you. I do want that

1129
01:24:44,620 --> 01:24:46,460
the great wall of china

1130
01:24:46,460 --> 01:24:48,220
Yeah, the best

1131
01:24:48,220 --> 01:24:51,980
Yeah, in my mind. Yeah, this is the best scene. Beautiful and also makes me

1132
01:24:52,860 --> 01:24:59,500
Hunger for a little more thrill even and like the way they they because they did a very dangerous seeming dive

1133
01:24:59,900 --> 01:25:04,540
By the wall. Yeah, get you to really kind of feel like you're like gonna kick a guy in the head

1134
01:25:04,540 --> 01:25:06,540
I think it's a cgi guy probably but

1135
01:25:07,180 --> 01:25:11,500
Uh, uh, you know what then it's one that I don't really notice if there's digital people in there

1136
01:25:11,580 --> 01:25:14,300
I don't know that's invisible. I don't know that to be a fact

1137
01:25:14,300 --> 01:25:18,940
I was just guessing though, but but um the way that it kind of soars you over that wall

1138
01:25:19,500 --> 01:25:21,260
I think is real cool

1139
01:25:21,260 --> 01:25:25,580
And I do go oh man wouldn't be fun if they like the whole thing was a little more of a thrill which

1140
01:25:25,980 --> 01:25:27,980
There's a big what patent?

1141
01:25:28,300 --> 01:25:32,460
That was just filed for a more aggressive soren by disney

1142
01:25:33,020 --> 01:25:38,540
Oh, that's the same. I caught this in passing. What it what can it do now that it basically can just fuck you up

1143
01:25:38,780 --> 01:25:42,940
And also soar you okay soars you and fucks you up a little bit more

1144
01:25:43,100 --> 01:25:48,860
Wow, so I think you can shake you around like a bad parent of a newborn. Yes, that is very much

1145
01:25:48,940 --> 01:25:51,740
That's the way in the patent. It's the office as it listed

1146
01:25:52,620 --> 01:25:53,580
um

1147
01:25:53,580 --> 01:25:57,100
Imagine that you're a parent with no regard for your own. Yeah. Yeah, like

1148
01:25:57,980 --> 01:25:59,420
That's what this ride will do to you

1149
01:25:59,420 --> 01:26:04,620
And it's also you're an audio cue that says i'm mad at you and i'm not gonna tell you why

1150
01:26:05,020 --> 01:26:07,820
And then you launch like you can I think it here it goes up

1151
01:26:07,900 --> 01:26:12,220
It's like you start from this and then you can like you all I don't know how to even describe this

1152
01:26:12,620 --> 01:26:17,340
It's like you're in the same row, but then you can go up along the side essentially

1153
01:26:17,900 --> 01:26:22,460
Of this mechanism and I think it can like kind of drop you and put you up

1154
01:26:23,100 --> 01:26:27,660
And then do more things with the seats. So I think it has like range of motion on some level

1155
01:26:27,740 --> 01:26:31,660
There's some like extra level of yeah, and I think maybe

1156
01:26:32,540 --> 01:26:35,420
Perhaps it can tip the seats itself or something. I'm not sure

1157
01:26:36,460 --> 01:26:39,420
But fucked up soarin. Yeah. No, it looks like you can do that

1158
01:26:39,420 --> 01:26:44,300
You can like tip there's a mechanism to like change the direction your actual like seats are going

1159
01:26:44,620 --> 01:26:51,260
Versus the way it is now where it's just you're all connected to the same contraption that moves you up or pushes you down a little bit

1160
01:26:51,260 --> 01:26:57,180
There's just a very small range of movement. It seems to be we wish they had this now so you could kick tinker bell in the head

1161
01:26:58,140 --> 01:27:02,220
Get out of here you pissed. Yeah. Well, maybe that's what they're building the new version of it

1162
01:27:03,180 --> 01:27:05,020
They'll do what we're all thinking

1163
01:27:05,020 --> 01:27:10,860
But I I think this is the most effective use of the old technology making you feel like oh cool

1164
01:27:11,100 --> 01:27:15,660
I'm really flying over this thing. Yeah. Well, there's such like there's such levels

1165
01:27:15,660 --> 01:27:19,520
They really like guide you along the yeah dips of that particularly

1166
01:27:20,140 --> 01:27:22,140
hilly section of the wall

1167
01:27:22,700 --> 01:27:24,220
Um, yeah

1168
01:27:24,220 --> 01:27:29,180
No, very cool until the kite comes in and until the kite comes in. I agree. Yes

1169
01:27:30,060 --> 01:27:31,900
which then you

1170
01:27:31,900 --> 01:27:37,980
You it's a bad cgi kite that transports you to a wonder of the ancient world

1171
01:27:38,300 --> 01:27:44,540
You go to the great pyramids and it's like I don't need a hard transition. It's the great pyramids

1172
01:27:44,860 --> 01:27:48,140
Yeah, you know, yeah. Yeah. No, let's let's not let's not goof it up

1173
01:27:48,700 --> 01:27:52,220
Um, yeah, I don't have much to say about that section. It's great. It's great

1174
01:27:52,380 --> 01:27:54,940
I don't that's not on my short list of places to go

1175
01:27:55,020 --> 01:27:58,540
I don't know if i'll make it there and if I do I certainly won't be able to like

1176
01:27:59,020 --> 01:28:05,020
Look at individual bricks on the very top of they really get you right in there

1177
01:28:05,420 --> 01:28:10,860
Yeah, you feel like you could kick a brick you could it feels like you kick a brick off the top of the pyramids

1178
01:28:11,900 --> 01:28:15,260
Nail some idiot down at the bottom. It's it's yeah, it's really

1179
01:28:16,220 --> 01:28:18,780
It's one of those where if you're on the right side or the left side

1180
01:28:19,180 --> 01:28:21,660
It feels like the pyramid is warped a little bit. Sure

1181
01:28:22,700 --> 01:28:25,660
But it does. I don't know. I don't know. There's something very

1182
01:28:26,060 --> 01:28:28,460
What is a word like where you just imagine?

1183
01:28:28,620 --> 01:28:32,540
You know exactly what all the bricks feel like because it feels like you get so close tactile

1184
01:28:32,620 --> 01:28:37,020
I guess tactile is the right one. So it's just like you see like the dust you see the dust

1185
01:28:37,020 --> 01:28:41,980
Yeah, it's it's really cool. And yes, you imagine i'm holding one of these bricks

1186
01:28:42,060 --> 01:28:44,220
I know what it would be like to hold one of these bricks in my hand

1187
01:28:44,940 --> 01:28:47,500
And I don't think they're gonna let you do that if you go they don't let you know

1188
01:28:47,500 --> 01:28:52,380
That's let's get that info out there security is there by the pyramids because it doesn't appear to be a ton

1189
01:28:52,460 --> 01:28:54,220
Well, they let me take a brick

1190
01:28:54,220 --> 01:28:57,980
Yeah, are you judging the lack of security on this ride footage?

1191
01:28:57,980 --> 01:29:02,140
Do you think they deleted the security from is there a big like perimeter on the pyramids?

1192
01:29:02,300 --> 01:29:06,540
I think access is limited to the pyramid. How do they limit it?

1193
01:29:07,980 --> 01:29:09,980
Don't go in there. It's the pyramids

1194
01:29:09,980 --> 01:29:11,820
Armed guards, you think so?

1195
01:29:11,820 --> 01:29:16,380
I mean, I guess they would have to because it's probably not at this point the most sturdy structure there

1196
01:29:16,380 --> 01:29:22,460
But do you think there's like a big perimeter with guards and barbed wire worried about this the stability of the pyramid?

1197
01:29:22,460 --> 01:29:24,460
All right, I didn't mean to insult this stability

1198
01:29:27,660 --> 01:29:29,660
I'm just saying they're they're old buildings

1199
01:29:30,060 --> 01:29:33,900
I I mean, I look there's a political unrest would have more

1200
01:29:33,980 --> 01:29:37,180
There's a bigger chance the luxor falls over in the next 10 years than any of that

1201
01:29:40,060 --> 01:29:45,820
I'm just saying though that like it's this building material that could be within the week that could happen any moment

1202
01:29:46,540 --> 01:29:49,420
depending on they're putting up a new like frito ad or a

1203
01:29:49,740 --> 01:29:53,340
Dorito ad on it and all the glass breaks from the weight of the sign

1204
01:29:53,980 --> 01:29:55,980
And they got to close the whole place down forever

1205
01:29:56,060 --> 01:30:01,820
Do you think president lcc of egypt has been approached of like hey, would you do this?

1206
01:30:02,620 --> 01:30:06,620
Would you do this on the great pyramid of giza big to read it turn into a big

1207
01:30:06,620 --> 01:30:08,620
Dorito

1208
01:30:08,700 --> 01:30:13,020
Big branded opportunity for the nation. I don't know. I don't think they've approached him and I think that's the problem

1209
01:30:13,660 --> 01:30:15,660
You know would calm your political unrest

1210
01:30:16,140 --> 01:30:18,140
uh gaming arena

1211
01:30:18,460 --> 01:30:23,740
Sure, I would love to game inside the actual pyramids. Yeah, that would fucking rock. Yeah

1212
01:30:23,980 --> 01:30:29,020
Yeah, be so sick most of these places on this ride. You cannot bet inside of

1213
01:30:30,300 --> 01:30:36,060
That's yeah, that's a problem in terms of security. The pyramids are heavily guarded 24 seven. That makes sense

1214
01:30:36,140 --> 01:30:39,260
Yeah, yeah, did you think there was a there weren't security guards?

1215
01:30:39,420 --> 01:30:43,900
I would guess it's just interesting because i'm gonna I just had the thought where i'm like, I wonder what it looks like

1216
01:30:44,620 --> 01:30:47,020
I wonder what it looks like around there because it would be such a

1217
01:30:48,040 --> 01:30:52,460
Protected site, but yeah, is it like is it like getting into a city walk?

1218
01:30:53,500 --> 01:30:56,460
Orlando where there's a security barrier. You got to go through it

1219
01:30:57,420 --> 01:30:59,900
You got to prove that you're not like you don't have a bag that says

1220
01:31:00,460 --> 01:31:03,100
A brick bag that you're going to steal a bunch of bricks in

1221
01:31:03,740 --> 01:31:06,460
Like an empty bag that could carry the weight of it

1222
01:31:07,100 --> 01:31:12,480
I don't know. Yeah, especially made like something you carry wine bottles in one that like has the compartments

1223
01:31:13,020 --> 01:31:17,180
This is clearly for bricks. I think those bricks are pretty large

1224
01:31:17,820 --> 01:31:20,620
I'm sure they are you got to have a big bag for one of them

1225
01:31:22,300 --> 01:31:26,940
Like a sedan size bag are they said are all the bricks sedan size

1226
01:31:27,020 --> 01:31:30,380
I don't know about all of them, but I think there's some pretty you got one of those

1227
01:31:30,380 --> 01:31:33,660
Well, i'm not gonna i'm not look i'm not gonna try to take the ones at the bottom

1228
01:31:33,980 --> 01:31:36,620
Yeah, no, what are you fool foolish? You got to go one from the top

1229
01:31:36,700 --> 01:31:40,700
Yeah, obviously you have to climb all the way to the top before the hopefully on that day

1230
01:31:40,860 --> 01:31:42,860
Not so many armed guards, right?

1231
01:31:43,100 --> 01:31:48,780
And you get one of those mattress bags to put a mattress in when you're moving and you just get the king size

1232
01:31:49,660 --> 01:31:51,900
You put them in one of those now that I look at yeah

1233
01:31:52,780 --> 01:31:58,300
Per jason's point. Yes, look at the size of a person next to what we're referring to as bricks

1234
01:31:58,620 --> 01:32:00,780
Sedan size was right on the money

1235
01:32:02,140 --> 01:32:05,260
All right, all right a real big bag two of those king-size man

1236
01:32:05,260 --> 01:32:08,220
You might need to put one put the bag in another bag that thing's not gonna

1237
01:32:08,860 --> 01:32:13,180
Furl up too neatly small bricks in a pyramid. There's I do have this question

1238
01:32:13,420 --> 01:32:17,580
Yes, I feel like you might have some smalls at the top. I think it takes all kinds

1239
01:32:17,660 --> 01:32:20,860
I think you got a number of are there any small? This is the most

1240
01:32:21,580 --> 01:32:25,660
The one who actually thinks like are just cringing right now at this conversation

1241
01:32:25,660 --> 01:32:27,660
If you know anything about

1242
01:32:28,140 --> 01:32:30,140
Bavarian monarch and serbanic scott

1243
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:35,900
Egyptologists are mad at mike. Well, I say bring it on they do not respect our bricks

1244
01:32:36,300 --> 01:32:38,860
They think that our bricks are small and not mighty

1245
01:32:39,660 --> 01:32:47,680
They can easily topple the president lcc's cabinet is furious at me for invoking his name during such tomfoolery

1246
01:32:49,180 --> 01:32:53,100
Yeah, then why'd you say it again? Yeah, we're gonna have to bleep all of those

1247
01:32:53,260 --> 01:32:57,900
I would you know, I would look maybe there'll be like a world i'll world travel one day and i'll go to the pyramids

1248
01:32:57,900 --> 01:33:02,300
Because i've always thought the pyramids were awesome. Like that's always yeah. I mean, it's obviously it's not

1249
01:33:02,860 --> 01:33:04,860
That's not an unusual thing to think

1250
01:33:05,580 --> 01:33:08,300
But still perhaps i'll go one day and try to steal a brick

1251
01:33:09,740 --> 01:33:13,820
Well, this is one of the you're very confident about certain abilities of yours in the checking arena

1252
01:33:13,820 --> 01:33:15,820
But you think you think you're getting out of there with a brick?

1253
01:33:16,140 --> 01:33:21,180
I guess maybe i'm not maybe i'm getting cocky. I guess I guess i'm probably not getting out of there with a brick

1254
01:33:21,660 --> 01:33:23,660
It seems like this

1255
01:33:24,300 --> 01:33:26,300
Yeah, okay. Oh wait, yeah now i'm

1256
01:33:27,180 --> 01:33:29,180
most of the blocks wage

1257
01:33:31,260 --> 01:33:36,140
I'm like let's let's be clear. I didn't think I was taking one from the bottom. I knew those were bigger

1258
01:33:36,700 --> 01:33:39,260
I didn't know they were all made up. I feel the same way though

1259
01:33:39,340 --> 01:33:43,820
And it's this is a hard thing to google quickly because the questions make me sound stupid

1260
01:33:44,140 --> 01:33:50,060
But I do wonder are some of the pyramid bricks also small it goes to a point. It's gotta be smaller

1261
01:33:50,860 --> 01:33:55,900
That's what I was saying imagine the effort to get the big the biggest ones up to the top

1262
01:33:56,540 --> 01:33:58,540
How small are the ones on the top?

1263
01:33:58,780 --> 01:34:03,100
Yeah, what's the smallest pyramid because it would have to at least be I don't know like

1264
01:34:03,880 --> 01:34:08,220
24 inches on the one on the top of my crate or it would be like four feet

1265
01:34:08,540 --> 01:34:13,180
How big does it have to be? Well now that I know that some of them are 25 tons all bets are off

1266
01:34:13,340 --> 01:34:18,620
They might not be anywhere near as small as you're describing. You need a whole brick. Can you just take a chip?

1267
01:34:19,420 --> 01:34:23,260
Can I just take it? Well, yeah, of course you could chip a piece off one of the bricks sure

1268
01:34:23,980 --> 01:34:27,580
Because they have to be falling off here and there but there's pyramids in mexico

1269
01:34:28,300 --> 01:34:34,300
Yes, that's true there start chipping. I'm sure they'll love that. I could just try to steal a piece of the luxor

1270
01:34:35,020 --> 01:34:40,860
To get my abilities uh heightened to get them just take a carrot top a banner

1271
01:34:41,260 --> 01:34:43,980
Yeah, well, I want a piece of the building take a body piece of the building

1272
01:34:44,140 --> 01:34:46,700
Oh, you want a piece of the brick that built the luxor?

1273
01:34:46,860 --> 01:34:52,780
Hmm, but you would you settle for here? Let's let's uh, let's compromise. Let's stennis compromise in the middle

1274
01:34:52,940 --> 01:34:55,660
Uh, just go cut off a piece of carrot tops hair

1275
01:34:56,140 --> 01:34:58,780
I mean that'd be cool to have right you might you know

1276
01:34:58,780 --> 01:35:03,820
He because he in a way built the building with his show and his comedy in his residency

1277
01:35:04,140 --> 01:35:08,460
And how cool would it be to have some of the famous carrot top of carrot top?

1278
01:35:08,780 --> 01:35:11,020
Yes, that's one of the modern seven wonders of the world

1279
01:35:11,020 --> 01:35:13,500
I would like that but I don't know that i'm ready for that type of heist

1280
01:35:13,580 --> 01:35:17,980
Did you mike did you stay there when we were in vegas did you stay I did stay there one night

1281
01:35:17,980 --> 01:35:24,460
Yes, so did you get to take the inclinator? We told this whole story. Yeah scary almost scariest

1282
01:35:25,100 --> 01:35:29,900
Things in my life going up that I just need a reminder. I just need a reminder because i'm like man

1283
01:35:30,220 --> 01:35:33,020
I almost died and jason didn't even care

1284
01:35:33,340 --> 01:35:37,120
Scary it was so fast and rattly and it lasted forever

1285
01:35:37,420 --> 01:35:41,260
And then the door didn't open right away and I was just like oh shit

1286
01:35:41,900 --> 01:35:47,660
Like i've never been and i've been in like those old elevators in an old building which where you got to pull the

1287
01:35:47,980 --> 01:35:51,340
Yeah, like like where you're just like this makes me very uncomfortable

1288
01:35:51,660 --> 01:35:57,500
That was like a walk in the park compared to this this felt like a runaway train a rickety runaway train

1289
01:35:57,740 --> 01:35:59,340
Yeah, right

1290
01:35:59,340 --> 01:36:04,140
You still do after that. Well, I would like to ride a fully functioning one

1291
01:36:04,540 --> 01:36:09,180
I don't know. I don't know if we can promise you that we can't guarantee that at the luxor

1292
01:36:09,420 --> 01:36:13,580
It seems like that is the last thing they can guarantee. Well when we go and we do the

1293
01:36:14,120 --> 01:36:18,220
universal horror permanent horror nights maze we'll all stay at the luxor and you'll do

1294
01:36:18,940 --> 01:36:21,980
You'll go up and then you will not we will not do such a thing

1295
01:36:22,540 --> 01:36:26,460
Well, i'm not saying not go i'm not i'm not getting in so i'm not getting no inclinator

1296
01:36:28,540 --> 01:36:30,540
In the last 10 years there's a there's a

1297
01:36:31,180 --> 01:36:36,460
Brand new hotel rooms that you can request I think and you think the inclinator is fresh

1298
01:36:36,780 --> 01:36:39,660
I think that is a normal elevator as it is a

1299
01:36:41,580 --> 01:36:45,820
That still doesn't make me want to stay at that shady weird hotel it is so weird

1300
01:36:45,900 --> 01:36:50,380
Yeah, new to a non-broken inclinator, huh? That fixes everything. Yeah, okay

1301
01:36:50,780 --> 01:36:56,940
Um, I okay that's that's giza. Wow boy have I never felt so stupid in front of the audience

1302
01:36:57,500 --> 01:37:01,020
I was with you. I thought some of the I thought some of them were small bricks

1303
01:37:01,100 --> 01:37:05,420
If you know if you can make us feel less stupid and tell us yes, there are some small bricks

1304
01:37:05,660 --> 01:37:11,100
Please do so because I feel humiliated now and mike really should so Taj Mahal

1305
01:37:12,380 --> 01:37:14,220
beautiful another

1306
01:37:14,220 --> 01:37:21,660
Beautiful majestic place. It's really nice. This is a nice. I know this feels I will complain and say it feels a little too

1307
01:37:22,200 --> 01:37:27,820
Digitally clean. Absolutely unless that truly is the natural beauty of the Taj Mahal

1308
01:37:27,820 --> 01:37:29,020
But I don't think so

1309
01:37:29,020 --> 01:37:34,940
Sydney feels a little like eerily too digital cleaned up and I think it really feels too. Is this all digital?

1310
01:37:36,140 --> 01:37:40,620
I don't want to say that. I just think it might not be but it feels like it could be

1311
01:37:41,100 --> 01:37:46,700
I think it's I think it's the base is real and then it's a lot of scrubbing. Yeah a lot of scrubby dub

1312
01:37:47,020 --> 01:37:52,540
Yeah, yeah, because that one feels definitely I still like the scene, but that's the one that most feels like cgi to me

1313
01:37:52,780 --> 01:37:59,660
Yeah, yeah, I really like that smell and I don't even I forgot the specifics with jasmine. Is that okay?

1314
01:37:59,660 --> 01:38:01,420
I think that's right. Great

1315
01:38:01,420 --> 01:38:06,140
This is what i'm saying. I think it's an unexpected smell and you kind of have to place it

1316
01:38:07,180 --> 01:38:09,580
Not that orange isn't unexpected. I just look

1317
01:38:10,380 --> 01:38:15,900
There's no reason to pit them against each other. The smell game on these attractions is wonderful

1318
01:38:16,220 --> 01:38:22,700
Yeah, they really did it jasmine is more subtle than the citrus scent. Yeah, which is pretty intense

1319
01:38:23,340 --> 01:38:27,740
Uh-huh on a bad way, but it's very forward and you know what let's talk

1320
01:38:28,540 --> 01:38:31,420
Music really quickly because it's the same base of music

1321
01:38:32,380 --> 01:38:36,540
Based on the jerry goldsmith score. He I believe had passed away by the time

1322
01:38:37,100 --> 01:38:39,100
The new score was being done

1323
01:38:39,580 --> 01:38:44,460
But it is certainly based on it's like different iterations of the theme

1324
01:38:45,820 --> 01:38:50,540
That he originally did and I like the different little movements of it. I like the

1325
01:38:51,580 --> 01:38:54,460
The more indian influenced music in this part

1326
01:38:54,460 --> 01:38:58,460
I really like the fiji the like the south seas

1327
01:38:59,260 --> 01:39:03,420
Uh, yeah, like they feel it's like it almost feels like entirely new music but still

1328
01:39:04,060 --> 01:39:10,300
Sort of tonally and it's not the hardest shift right but that's such a big part of something like that combo of

1329
01:39:10,940 --> 01:39:12,940
smell and music shift

1330
01:39:13,020 --> 01:39:15,020
I think I feel the most transported

1331
01:39:15,820 --> 01:39:20,380
In the fiji section of any of these that's maybe the second magic point

1332
01:39:21,020 --> 01:39:28,700
Yeah, you're like I can't help but be really immersed and we've done water scenes also because we talked in the last one about

1333
01:39:29,180 --> 01:39:32,620
How completely calm I feel in that dusk?

1334
01:39:33,180 --> 01:39:39,980
Scene the very the shimmering pink dusk sequence at the end of california. Yeah, so the water game

1335
01:39:40,620 --> 01:39:43,900
That you know, they got to step it up if they're gonna do a water sequence

1336
01:39:44,540 --> 01:39:49,180
In another soren and I think they they completely brought it. I don't know if it's better

1337
01:39:49,660 --> 01:39:54,540
But it's wonderful. It's it's a different type of water scene. And yeah water and greenery

1338
01:39:55,260 --> 01:40:00,060
You know, that's what I think that's just calming to most people like

1339
01:40:00,540 --> 01:40:06,540
Even the concept art or early pictures i've seen of the dream work stuff universal orlando. I'm like

1340
01:40:07,180 --> 01:40:12,620
Oh my god, there's so much greenery back there. That's so smart. That really looks like

1341
01:40:13,900 --> 01:40:18,140
It elevates the experience whether it's just play areas or not, you know

1342
01:40:18,300 --> 01:40:25,100
Yeah, I am. Oh god. I was just saying I am seeing enough people on claiming that it's all see that tajmal is all cgi

1343
01:40:25,180 --> 01:40:29,420
Really? Really? I don't know. There's not an official source here, but everyone seems to believe that

1344
01:40:29,900 --> 01:40:32,700
Well, look if there is a theme and we'll get back to this theme

1345
01:40:33,100 --> 01:40:38,700
Uh, you know, I I don't think we can automatically trust everything that we read about soren

1346
01:40:39,180 --> 01:40:44,380
On the internet. There's also some confusion some some element some elements of the pyramid

1347
01:40:44,780 --> 01:40:47,420
They some people feel those are the two most cgie

1348
01:40:47,580 --> 01:40:47,900
Really?

1349
01:40:47,900 --> 01:40:53,420
But don't you see at the end of the pyramids because I feel like you kind of see off into the city proper

1350
01:40:53,580 --> 01:40:57,340
I don't know how close it is to the pyramids. Yeah, that doesn't feel

1351
01:40:58,140 --> 01:41:01,420
Certainly that feels to me more like we're getting some reality here

1352
01:41:01,500 --> 01:41:07,020
But the tajmahal does feel like it could be completely cgi. Yeah, it's a little yeah a little little too much of a sheen

1353
01:41:07,660 --> 01:41:12,300
Um, I wait I skipped ahead monument valley or look where we go through

1354
01:41:13,020 --> 01:41:19,020
The one of the west and oh, yeah mitten buttes. They look like big mittens, I guess

1355
01:41:19,660 --> 01:41:21,580
In monument valley, arizona

1356
01:41:21,580 --> 01:41:25,020
This is another kind of disney nod because monument valley

1357
01:41:25,500 --> 01:41:29,500
And those rocks are the basis of the magic kingdom version of big thunder mountain

1358
01:41:29,660 --> 01:41:33,740
Yeah, so I like that they are nodding to the real world. It's like we're going backwards

1359
01:41:33,820 --> 01:41:38,940
We made fake versions of these things and now we go take you back to the real cars too

1360
01:41:39,500 --> 01:41:41,660
Monument valley. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah

1361
01:41:42,700 --> 01:41:44,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah

1362
01:41:44,220 --> 01:41:51,260
I'd have to think that um, there's a bird that wishes by and it's stupid but uh, uh, lao islands in fiji. Great

1363
01:41:51,500 --> 01:41:58,160
Uh that transitions you to igwazu falls. This is at the border of brazil and argentina

1364
01:41:58,300 --> 01:42:01,660
This is a place that I have been. Wow. Yeah early into

1365
01:42:02,140 --> 01:42:04,140
Aaron and I dating we took a

1366
01:42:04,540 --> 01:42:07,420
Really magical trip to I mean it was all great

1367
01:42:07,580 --> 01:42:12,960
Uh, uh all argentina, but in the dead center of it. We went to igwazu

1368
01:42:13,500 --> 01:42:18,380
Uh, this is one of the coolest things i've ever seen in my life and I I it makes me so happy to see it

1369
01:42:18,940 --> 01:42:25,100
On the ride and to get a little return and see it from a vantage point that you never could the vantage point that you get

1370
01:42:25,260 --> 01:42:30,000
Is unforgettable and it's just this long long series of catwalks

1371
01:42:30,460 --> 01:42:34,780
Uh, and we had like a real like, you know boat and atv adventure getting back

1372
01:42:35,020 --> 01:42:38,940
The whole thing was just such a big adventure and I remember that that night

1373
01:42:39,340 --> 01:42:42,940
We had just like a long long romantic dinner

1374
01:42:43,500 --> 01:42:47,500
Wine fueled talking about god knows what and at the end of it

1375
01:42:47,580 --> 01:42:53,020
All I know is that by the end of it we were both feeling this is the person I want to marry

1376
01:42:54,060 --> 01:42:59,600
Say it out loud then but we I mean there were hints of that before but we really knew it at igwazu

1377
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:05,120
And you like someone over california better after this is in the second version of the ride

1378
01:43:05,200 --> 01:43:08,160
Yeah, well, I don't know. Uh, uh, oh my god

1379
01:43:08,320 --> 01:43:14,240
This makes me want to tip this over. Yeah, I suppose. Wow. Um, yeah, I don't know. I look uh, uh, you know

1380
01:43:14,640 --> 01:43:18,320
Incredible indelible memories from your own life and travel sure but that those

1381
01:43:19,440 --> 01:43:22,480
The balloon transition is so silly

1382
01:43:24,080 --> 01:43:27,040
Uh, I that's great. I didn't even realize that story

1383
01:43:27,280 --> 01:43:31,760
Yeah, god if you get that shit that is a that's a world travel this is high high recommended

1384
01:43:31,760 --> 01:43:33,760
This is one of the this scene is so cool

1385
01:43:34,160 --> 01:43:38,800
And this also and the way the way the movement of the vehicle sort of pulls you back in that moment

1386
01:43:38,800 --> 01:43:41,040
I don't even I can't even describe it just the way

1387
01:43:41,440 --> 01:43:43,840
In which oh like it simulate like suddenly you stop because you know

1388
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:48,000
There's no this there hasn't really been a stop until exactly and they stop you right here and it really

1389
01:43:48,140 --> 01:43:53,520
Emphasizes what like the scope of what you're seeing and how cool it is and yeah music really hits there

1390
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:58,160
Yeah, that is the and you know what it's kind of that is the most that they just show

1391
01:43:59,120 --> 01:44:01,120
natural beauty in the world

1392
01:44:01,600 --> 01:44:02,640
and uh

1393
01:44:02,640 --> 01:44:07,440
And you know what and you know, because there's beauty throughout this but some of them are man-made landmarks and this is really

1394
01:44:07,920 --> 01:44:12,880
Just like hey, this is god's god's creation speak for yes what god has done

1395
01:44:13,280 --> 01:44:15,760
Uh, yeah, this is awesome. I this

1396
01:44:16,560 --> 01:44:22,720
I've already said favorites. Maybe this is the best scene in all the sorens in a way. Wow. I don't know

1397
01:44:22,880 --> 01:44:25,040
I just it's so cool. I think

1398
01:44:26,240 --> 01:44:32,000
I mean I like I I can't apply my own feelings about this place to it because I mean

1399
01:44:32,080 --> 01:44:35,840
I think fiji's wonderful and I think the dusk. No, I know those are great, too

1400
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:38,720
But there's something so yeah, everything we just said the movement

1401
01:44:39,040 --> 01:44:46,560
What about the scene in california where you're going over the 110 freeway and the footage is sped up by a thousand percent?

1402
01:44:47,120 --> 01:44:50,720
And if you look at the cars for too long you get a little bit dizzy

1403
01:44:51,280 --> 01:44:55,840
And it reminds you that the arena is now the crypto dot com

1404
01:44:57,440 --> 01:45:04,080
And how about bizarre that will always be unless they that changes unless that's ripped out in five months

1405
01:45:04,880 --> 01:45:09,460
That speed up I think was more novel in 2001 than 2024

1406
01:45:10,320 --> 01:45:16,240
Like we're too well because now they would plan on that and they'd shoot it in a way that accounted for that instead of

1407
01:45:16,720 --> 01:45:23,280
Right. Yeah, it's it's it's I don't know. It's sort of awkward and it's yeah processing it kind of I do like this better than that

1408
01:45:23,600 --> 01:45:27,200
Yes. Yeah. Yeah, no offense to the the 110 freeway

1409
01:45:27,760 --> 01:45:33,600
That's just all it's also like it's a stressful place to be the one living in los angeles. You try to avoid that freeway

1410
01:45:34,080 --> 01:45:39,440
Make you you try to make all of your decisions in your life to avoid that particular stretch of freeway

1411
01:45:39,920 --> 01:45:41,920
Yes, like you've fucked up if you're there

1412
01:45:42,480 --> 01:45:47,600
Hi, yeah go at downtown la is so much interesting like cool

1413
01:45:48,320 --> 01:45:50,960
history and architecture and

1414
01:45:51,920 --> 01:45:55,840
All of this awesome stuff. It is such a pain in the ass to get down there

1415
01:45:56,320 --> 01:45:58,240
truly if you want to cut

1416
01:45:58,240 --> 01:46:03,600
If you want like this some of the biggest driving tests of your life to cut across six lanes of traffic

1417
01:46:04,320 --> 01:46:05,840
on a freeway

1418
01:46:05,840 --> 01:46:09,460
To get to an exit once you get dumped off like the 101

1419
01:46:10,260 --> 01:46:15,140
The go to the 110 that's that's where you're going to find some challenges city all really breaks down

1420
01:46:15,300 --> 01:46:18,580
Yeah, it's the nerve center and the nerves are decaying

1421
01:46:18,580 --> 01:46:21,860
Yeah, i've done it enough now where I know the little there's a little tricks

1422
01:46:22,100 --> 01:46:24,500
But I don't have to get into it now or too deep into this episode

1423
01:46:24,580 --> 01:46:28,180
Yeah, can you instead describe the best way to get out of the burbank empire center?

1424
01:46:28,180 --> 01:46:33,860
I think that'd be much more of interest though. Haven't we done that already? I think I think the listeners go back towards the hotels

1425
01:46:34,420 --> 01:46:38,820
Yeah, okay. Oh great. Well, it's easy then it's quick and then there's lights. Yeah. Okay. Okay great

1426
01:46:38,820 --> 01:46:41,380
Yeah, we just I wanted to give some tip. Thank you. Yeah

1427
01:46:42,740 --> 01:46:49,620
bendy eiffel tower we talked about yeah, um, and here's where we start getting different between the

1428
01:46:50,720 --> 01:46:52,580
locations, yeah

1429
01:46:52,580 --> 01:46:54,020
because

1430
01:46:54,020 --> 01:46:55,540
disney

1431
01:46:55,540 --> 01:46:59,380
Cal disneyland california has the horrible wretched

1432
01:46:59,920 --> 01:47:02,580
Tinkerbell appearance the absolutely vile

1433
01:47:03,360 --> 01:47:04,740
appearance

1434
01:47:04,740 --> 01:47:06,740
Uh of the she devil herself

1435
01:47:07,460 --> 01:47:10,340
Um epcot you get

1436
01:47:11,380 --> 01:47:14,420
Okay. Wait a minute. Was it when it was the california ride film?

1437
01:47:14,500 --> 01:47:17,700
Did you just go to disneyland at the end of it and that was a little like

1438
01:47:18,100 --> 01:47:21,300
so then you get to go across the country and that's fun, but then

1439
01:47:22,260 --> 01:47:26,740
Seeing like the like the epcot of your dreams the purple pink

1440
01:47:27,300 --> 01:47:33,860
Perfect epcot now now preserved before they did all that stuff in communicor you get to like

1441
01:47:34,580 --> 01:47:37,140
When you're on this ride you get to go to epcot

1442
01:47:37,680 --> 01:47:39,360
circa

1443
01:47:39,360 --> 01:47:41,700
2006 I forget when they did it

1444
01:47:42,180 --> 01:47:46,340
Uh, but it's you know, I don't know. It's a beauty. It's a wonderful spaceship earth. That's all i'm saying

1445
01:47:46,900 --> 01:47:48,900
I yes, I

1446
01:47:49,300 --> 01:47:52,500
If I could choose I would always go to the epcot one

1447
01:47:53,380 --> 01:47:55,940
Just seeing epcot. Yeah at night

1448
01:47:56,660 --> 01:48:01,700
It's interesting the disney seat doesn't have a ton of nighttime lighting

1449
01:48:02,500 --> 01:48:04,740
I think because it's it's meant to

1450
01:48:05,700 --> 01:48:10,740
It looks tasteful, but it's not like super lit up like epcot is

1451
01:48:11,540 --> 01:48:13,540
Did you get that sense when you were there?

1452
01:48:13,860 --> 01:48:19,940
Like you mean just in general the lights at night the lights at night seemed to make sense for all the areas

1453
01:48:20,500 --> 01:48:25,780
But from above it wasn't that bright. Maybe you're going over the big body of water

1454
01:48:25,860 --> 01:48:29,700
So there's not that's true. Yeah, I mean, yeah, there was a lot of light. I don't know

1455
01:48:30,660 --> 01:48:32,900
My memory of it is that everything was perfect. So

1456
01:48:33,460 --> 01:48:34,420
Yes, yeah

1457
01:48:34,420 --> 01:48:40,340
No, the memory is that it's the greatest place i've ever been more than igwazu. Maybe

1458
01:48:40,980 --> 01:48:46,100
I mean aaron might agree with that. I I will just there is truly there is a feeling I get

1459
01:48:46,660 --> 01:48:54,100
Just hearing the word disney sea. It's just it's unreal which to that to that end we can go back to other ride films

1460
01:48:54,180 --> 01:48:55,940
But in disney sea

1461
01:48:55,940 --> 01:49:02,020
You know, this is one of the main things motivating doing a version that is not entirely set in california that they wanted to open it there

1462
01:49:02,580 --> 01:49:07,460
Uh soaring fantastic flight in asia. They stopped doing the n

1463
01:49:08,080 --> 01:49:14,580
Apostrophe, yeah, presumably is not something there is an equivalent of in any of those languages quite a translation

1464
01:49:15,140 --> 01:49:17,140
So soaring it is there

1465
01:49:17,780 --> 01:49:20,580
um, and if you can imagine

1466
01:49:21,220 --> 01:49:28,900
Uh disney sea did a version that's in the coolest looking building you've ever seen with the coolest architecture and set design you've ever seen

1467
01:49:29,380 --> 01:49:33,860
And incredible columns and every corner of the room you look at is really cool

1468
01:49:33,940 --> 01:49:40,500
And it makes you profoundly jealous that there is not really anything that good in the california parks at least and and and

1469
01:49:40,980 --> 01:49:44,580
You say like a full new story tied to a new character

1470
01:49:44,820 --> 01:49:52,340
I didn't say I didn't to see the society of explorers and adventurers. We get a new and now okay now here is where we do

1471
01:49:53,140 --> 01:50:00,820
Depart from our beloved patrick flight attendant. Yeah, who by the way since the last episode returned to the role did a little video

1472
01:50:01,300 --> 01:50:07,540
Uh at the california adventure soaring. It's nice to see him again. Nice to hear him saying all the stuff again and talking about the strap

1473
01:50:07,940 --> 01:50:09,940
um, so that was cool, however

1474
01:50:10,660 --> 01:50:12,660
They just I mean

1475
01:50:12,980 --> 01:50:17,700
I like soaring i'll always like soaring. It doesn't matter but soaring is a little bit of an industrial ride

1476
01:50:17,940 --> 01:50:20,340
You know, uh, you're kind of in a factory

1477
01:50:20,420 --> 01:50:22,420
You're sort of looking at walls

1478
01:50:22,420 --> 01:50:29,060
And there is a man who could be in a pre-flight a real pre-flight video telling you real pre-flight information here

1479
01:50:29,140 --> 01:50:31,940
We are transported to a wondrous world

1480
01:50:32,420 --> 01:50:33,700
or a

1481
01:50:33,700 --> 01:50:34,980
inventor

1482
01:50:34,980 --> 01:50:40,020
Uh, uh, like a woman from the past passionate about flight a dreamer

1483
01:50:40,580 --> 01:50:47,700
Weaves tales of fantastical flying machines and doodads and she's got a magical bird with her

1484
01:50:48,020 --> 01:50:53,540
And there's magic tricks in the pre-show. God damn it. I want this one. It's so good. I

1485
01:50:54,020 --> 01:50:54,980
She's got a paint. Yeah

1486
01:50:54,980 --> 01:51:00,660
She comes to life in a painting and there are all these like shadows on the wall in the pre-show that imagine in

1487
01:51:00,900 --> 01:51:05,060
I mean it reads in a video anyway, but can you imagine in person how?

1488
01:51:05,620 --> 01:51:08,660
Great that I bet that effect is like, oh my god, that's a screen

1489
01:51:08,900 --> 01:51:10,740
I'm sure you don't know until that second

1490
01:51:10,740 --> 01:51:15,620
Well in the bird is shadow and then it flies into the painting and it's an actual

1491
01:51:15,940 --> 01:51:22,420
Falcon and then goes back in goes back to shadow. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's incredible. It's so great

1492
01:51:22,740 --> 01:51:25,780
It's it's a real with little magic tricks

1493
01:51:26,260 --> 01:51:33,300
And that the pre-show is unbelievable and then kind of tops the other iterations pre-shows were in the territory of their tower of terror

1494
01:51:33,780 --> 01:51:35,780
Yes, yeah, we have it's so good

1495
01:51:35,780 --> 01:51:38,660
Why can't I not just say all this and say and that's neat

1496
01:51:38,740 --> 01:51:45,540
Why am I saying it with the tone of like god damn it? Ah, they got jealousy. Yes, my anger is but maybe

1497
01:51:46,320 --> 01:51:51,460
Unmaskable, it's just there. I want to be able to go on this version more often. Maybe one day

1498
01:51:52,160 --> 01:51:54,900
Camellia falco will be in that sea

1499
01:51:55,520 --> 01:52:02,020
Television show if it ever gets made. Yeah, and she'll be able to turn to the camera and go, uh, is that even a thing?

1500
01:52:03,380 --> 01:52:06,420
She'll be able to get the bird. That's like a consolation prize

1501
01:52:06,500 --> 01:52:11,780
Yeah, she'll be able like the bird will land on her hand and she'll go. Oh that just happened

1502
01:52:12,180 --> 01:52:16,900
That's with access to all of our flying machines and time travel possibilities

1503
01:52:16,980 --> 01:52:21,140
We must go and harvest the best quips from all areas of time

1504
01:52:21,620 --> 01:52:23,940
And all of the best quips come from the year

1505
01:52:24,560 --> 01:52:26,560
2014 and beyond

1506
01:52:26,820 --> 01:52:30,440
Let's scour the commercials of 2014 the advertisements

1507
01:52:31,220 --> 01:52:32,660
to find

1508
01:52:32,740 --> 01:52:40,260
My first it's like let's scour the advertisements of 2019 to see what the movies and films of 2013 were doing

1509
01:52:41,940 --> 01:52:47,540
My whirly gigs and birds don't just fly now they fly always

1510
01:52:48,900 --> 01:52:51,620
It's they fly now. Yeah, they fly of course

1511
01:52:52,100 --> 01:52:53,620
Uh, I it's so cool

1512
01:52:53,620 --> 01:52:58,020
I almost want to do I I don't want to do episodes on any of this stuff because I want to go but also

1513
01:52:58,260 --> 01:53:00,420
Yeah, I don't know you want to go on it first

1514
01:53:00,500 --> 01:53:03,140
Well, shanghai has a different story, too

1515
01:53:03,540 --> 01:53:09,380
You got a tribe that graces you with the power of flight. Well, we gotta do so you meet another magical woman

1516
01:53:09,380 --> 01:53:11,300
You meet a shapeshifter

1517
01:53:11,300 --> 01:53:14,980
It's a whole other like and she turns into a bunch of stuff

1518
01:53:15,620 --> 01:53:19,240
And she she turns into an eagle and a frog and a hummingbird

1519
01:53:19,620 --> 01:53:22,980
Because they have to make it that's the first soren in a castle park

1520
01:53:23,220 --> 01:53:27,380
They had to make it fantastical enough to fit in a place. That's all

1521
01:53:27,940 --> 01:53:32,740
World of wonder they couldn't just do a hanger and it seems like they did a really great job

1522
01:53:32,900 --> 01:53:34,900
You would give up patrick for this

1523
01:53:35,220 --> 01:53:38,820
For camellia. Yes, the other one seems neat. Um

1524
01:53:40,420 --> 01:53:46,820
You have to have it both coasts I have to yes, well look I think my ideal version would be that it's patrick and uh

1525
01:53:47,780 --> 01:53:50,760
Uh california in california forever

1526
01:53:51,300 --> 01:53:55,460
But you know, well it wouldn't make any sense and it already doesn't make a lot of sense in the land

1527
01:53:55,540 --> 01:54:01,700
Let's be honest. I don't think that suddenly like, you know, uh, you know, uh, yeah right next to that like

1528
01:54:02,660 --> 01:54:07,000
Unpleasant restaurant to be in that you gotta then then you go meet camellia falco

1529
01:54:07,940 --> 01:54:12,820
Um, so I don't know. I don't know they can stay what they are. I just just build this one, too

1530
01:54:12,900 --> 01:54:14,900
That's what I want two sorens

1531
01:54:14,980 --> 01:54:20,180
They gotta build that disneyland forward area. Just give me another soren. Give me the camellia falco one. It'll be fine

1532
01:54:20,260 --> 01:54:22,260
Got it. It's worth worth doubling up. Nice

1533
01:54:22,500 --> 01:54:29,540
Um, so that's what what have we missed there? Um you oh wait now tokyo

1534
01:54:30,660 --> 01:54:32,100
Wait a minute

1535
01:54:32,100 --> 01:54:36,500
In which oh, oh they replace paris with uh, just a view of tokyo at night

1536
01:54:37,140 --> 01:54:44,580
They don't do paris and there and the falcon appears several times at the beginning in the end. So you have magical character like

1537
01:54:45,280 --> 01:54:49,540
Characters running throughout yours. That's what you're saying. You want it at the beginning and end

1538
01:54:49,620 --> 01:54:54,180
There you go, but isn't it like even if you knew tinkerbell was coming then then she showed up at the end

1539
01:54:54,260 --> 01:54:58,100
You just say oh tinkerbell again. Shanghai also would be confused

1540
01:54:58,660 --> 01:55:01,220
Shanghai doesn't fly over the park. It flies over the

1541
01:55:01,780 --> 01:55:07,700
City scape at night. Yes of shanghai and you go right past the shanghai world financial center

1542
01:55:07,780 --> 01:55:10,020
The world's tallest building with a hole

1543
01:55:10,980 --> 01:55:16,820
It is there you go. I was I did have to rewind once or twice and go like does that building with giant hole on top

1544
01:55:16,820 --> 01:55:19,060
Got a big hole in it, but it's not a problem

1545
01:55:19,380 --> 01:55:24,660
It was it was meant to have one. I love the giant buildings with the hole in top or in the middle

1546
01:55:24,740 --> 01:55:26,740
It's a very cool building. It's cool

1547
01:55:26,740 --> 01:55:32,900
um, well, I think this loops us back around to the original point and uh,

1548
01:55:33,380 --> 01:55:36,340
Let me just kind of reset the stage a little bit of how we

1549
01:55:36,900 --> 01:55:41,620
We came to this point. So we did an episode about soaring over california back in september

1550
01:55:42,180 --> 01:55:44,340
and you know when you think of

1551
01:55:45,060 --> 01:55:51,620
Funny trivia about this ride one of the things you definitely think of is this thing of michael eisner

1552
01:55:51,940 --> 01:55:57,460
Being the golfer who hits the golf ball that flies at you in the palm spring sequence

1553
01:55:57,940 --> 01:56:04,500
Of that ride and I went into the episode not with any intention to like it had never occurred to me

1554
01:56:05,380 --> 01:56:08,260
To like that there could be anything up with that fact

1555
01:56:08,420 --> 01:56:13,620
I just I was like I want more I want more eisner as always

1556
01:56:14,020 --> 01:56:15,860
and I want like

1557
01:56:15,860 --> 01:56:22,420
Photos of him doing it. I want him sizing up golf clubs. I want video of him getting ready

1558
01:56:22,500 --> 01:56:26,660
I want the movie surfers talking to him on the set of so we're here on the set of soren

1559
01:56:26,980 --> 01:56:29,220
With disney's big cheese michael eisner

1560
01:56:29,860 --> 01:56:32,420
Um, so you're playing the golfer today. Tell me about that

1561
01:56:32,980 --> 01:56:35,940
Um, you know, I just I wanted more to bring to the table

1562
01:56:36,100 --> 01:56:42,580
But what I started finding was kind of distressing to me and i've gotten kind of a preview of this recently with this other

1563
01:56:43,220 --> 01:56:48,820
Issue that had come up that's still kind of unsolved of does space mountain have fans that simulate the speed of the ride

1564
01:56:49,300 --> 01:56:54,260
And I so i'd gotten a little practice with that and you know, we've been doing this show for a long time now

1565
01:56:54,580 --> 01:56:59,780
We get our sources from you know, you know, we we source information from like particular

1566
01:57:00,420 --> 01:57:06,180
Sources that we that we trust, you know people like jim hill theme park historian jim hill

1567
01:57:06,260 --> 01:57:08,260
That's a that's a place where we turn a lot

1568
01:57:08,660 --> 01:57:13,140
But with as with the fans with this issue, I was just not finding

1569
01:57:13,380 --> 01:57:13,860
Yeah

1570
01:57:13,860 --> 01:57:17,780
any sources that I try I was finding a lot of things that i'd put in the category of

1571
01:57:18,020 --> 01:57:22,420
That it's a really poorly designed website with lots of ads that look like the way ads

1572
01:57:23,140 --> 01:57:28,820
Started looking 12 years ago. Uh, and there are and it's and they'll be called like, uh, you know

1573
01:57:29,460 --> 01:57:31,460
dis bloggy mommies

1574
01:57:32,980 --> 01:57:35,220
It's and you're getting four of those ads at once

1575
01:57:35,380 --> 01:57:40,260
Yeah, yeah, yes, you know, I have to clear out all of the ads from all directions of the browser

1576
01:57:40,340 --> 01:57:40,820
Yeah, yeah

1577
01:57:40,820 --> 01:57:41,140
Yes

1578
01:57:41,140 --> 01:57:41,300
No

1579
01:57:41,300 --> 01:57:46,180
The things about to explode so that I can even clear them away to see the name dis bloggy mommies

1580
01:57:46,420 --> 01:57:50,660
It's buggy mommies dot mouse. That's the kind of thing that i'm looking at and i'm like

1581
01:57:51,140 --> 01:57:51,700
I don't know

1582
01:57:51,700 --> 01:57:58,340
I'm just not seeing enough of the kinds of sources that I think are credible and there might be i'm just not seeing them there

1583
01:57:58,660 --> 01:58:00,660
And I want to know definitively

1584
01:58:00,980 --> 01:58:04,500
And I and I want to encourage these places to not be in the

1585
01:58:05,140 --> 01:58:09,620
To be like jim hill and not like dis bloggy mommies. Let's make sure we know these things

1586
01:58:09,700 --> 01:58:12,180
Let's back them up with with photographic evidence

1587
01:58:12,500 --> 01:58:14,020
um, so

1588
01:58:14,020 --> 01:58:20,660
I decided to turn to a source that we all trust and that is jim hill people might have seen this

1589
01:58:21,060 --> 01:58:23,060
Uh online not long after

1590
01:58:23,540 --> 01:58:28,980
Our episode came out. I said, uh, let's get down to business jim hill. Do you

1591
01:58:29,940 --> 01:58:34,020
Believe or can you back up that michael eisner is the golfer on sorum?

1592
01:58:34,420 --> 01:58:40,580
And he presented a couple of thoughts that were sort of in my avenue of not necessarily

1593
01:58:41,140 --> 01:58:44,820
Uh believing it. Here's here's the thing that he said. Well, first of all, uh,

1594
01:58:45,380 --> 01:58:51,860
Somebody said at bf se sq said I hope my heart doesn't get broken

1595
01:58:52,020 --> 01:58:54,020
I've always believed this

1596
01:58:54,660 --> 01:58:58,820
And uh, that brings me to to a point because I asked the audience

1597
01:58:59,460 --> 01:59:03,220
What do we think soren golfer is eisner not eisner?

1598
01:59:03,680 --> 01:59:07,860
60 of our audience said they believe this is wow michael eisner

1599
01:59:07,860 --> 01:59:12,900
Where do you guys put it at that? I don't know. Where have you landed in your your personal belief system in this area?

1600
01:59:13,300 --> 01:59:14,980
I I

1601
01:59:14,980 --> 01:59:16,980
I don't think it's him. I think you did a good job

1602
01:59:17,540 --> 01:59:22,900
You've landed it. Yeah, I did not get anywhere definitive. No, I know now we're getting we're getting closer to the

1603
01:59:23,060 --> 01:59:27,140
Potential listening to the episode. I went. Oh, that's probably not I would love to be wrong

1604
01:59:27,380 --> 01:59:29,700
Uh-huh. I would I don't I would love to be wrong

1605
01:59:29,780 --> 01:59:33,620
I mean what a victory it would be for all of us in a couple minutes if that's where this went

1606
01:59:33,780 --> 01:59:35,780
Maybe it's where it's going jason

1607
01:59:36,020 --> 01:59:38,660
I would love to believe it's eisner

1608
01:59:39,540 --> 01:59:44,580
But I think we've encountered so many things of conventional wisdom

1609
01:59:45,300 --> 01:59:48,600
Just being like disney storytelling k-fabe

1610
01:59:49,160 --> 01:59:54,600
Oh sure, oh isn't that interesting that's so perfect and it's like yeah, it's too perfect

1611
01:59:54,760 --> 01:59:57,880
Yeah, it's not a little too perfect. Yes

1612
01:59:58,200 --> 02:00:01,960
So yeah, I asked audience and 60 percent of them believe it's eisner now

1613
02:00:02,040 --> 02:00:06,920
I'm gonna solve a mystery of something that might have seemed out of nowhere that I tweeted a couple days ago

1614
02:00:07,240 --> 02:00:10,600
I asked the podcast the right audience on twitter

1615
02:00:11,080 --> 02:00:15,800
Uh, this is gonna seem heavy and out of nowhere, but it's information we need for a future episode here goes

1616
02:00:15,960 --> 02:00:21,240
Do you believe in god? I was wondering what this was. I didn't tell you guys what it was about

1617
02:00:21,480 --> 02:00:23,880
every every now and then like like

1618
02:00:24,280 --> 02:00:30,280
Sometimes I just plum forgot like the inclinator or like the fake soren discussions

1619
02:00:31,080 --> 02:00:32,840
but I was like

1620
02:00:32,840 --> 02:00:36,040
Why did we reading about soren around the world and i'm like

1621
02:00:36,840 --> 02:00:38,840
We're not doing a god episode

1622
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:43,960
I've heard no people are wondering does this mean we're going back to to the arc encounter or something?

1623
02:00:43,960 --> 02:00:48,120
No, no, no, I wanted to compare contrast the eisner believe versus the belief in god

1624
02:00:48,680 --> 02:00:50,840
Listener amount of listeners who believe in god

1625
02:00:51,780 --> 02:00:53,000
definitively

1626
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:55,000
There's no way this is not accurate

1627
02:00:55,320 --> 02:01:01,960
According to the online poll 31 percent. Wow 31 percent of podcast the ride listeners believe in god

1628
02:01:02,580 --> 02:01:10,120
60 believe that michael eisner is the golfer in soren. That is the kind of is that is that double that is double?

1629
02:01:10,200 --> 02:01:13,400
Yeah, yeah, uh that that is that is what we are

1630
02:01:14,200 --> 02:01:17,480
Tampering with here. This is a deep more deeply held belief

1631
02:01:17,480 --> 02:01:17,960
Yeah, yeah

1632
02:01:17,960 --> 02:01:21,480
Some of the most deeply held beliefs that have ever existed on the globe

1633
02:01:21,880 --> 02:01:27,880
That is what we are starting to poke at to go back to talking about aliens and uap and all this stuff

1634
02:01:28,200 --> 02:01:30,200
some people feel that

1635
02:01:30,200 --> 02:01:35,960
This is information as far as aliens concerned or interdimensional travelers that should not be revealed to the public because what it will do

1636
02:01:36,040 --> 02:01:40,440
To them would be so catastrophic. It would affect their belief system

1637
02:01:40,600 --> 02:01:43,880
It would completely turn people's brains upside down

1638
02:01:44,200 --> 02:01:51,480
So the big argument that people say the people in the whatever the secret government make is we cannot do this

1639
02:01:51,880 --> 02:01:57,560
This is too important. We have to keep it quiet. We cannot tell people what's actually going on

1640
02:01:58,040 --> 02:02:02,440
so i'm not saying you should follow this as well when it comes to this eisner reveal, but

1641
02:02:03,160 --> 02:02:09,400
That's what some people believe maybe as far as the actual disclosure of aliens or interdimensional travelers

1642
02:02:09,640 --> 02:02:16,120
That's as silly now. Let's just all take a quick peek inside this arc that i've been sitting next to this whole show

1643
02:02:18,760 --> 02:02:22,760
Uh, I don't know you you raise an interesting point michael and now that you've said it

1644
02:02:22,920 --> 02:02:27,720
You know what you survive podcast the ride. That's the end of this episode. This will never be discussed. All right

1645
02:02:28,040 --> 02:02:30,440
Oh, okay. I feel good about that. No, no, we got it

1646
02:02:30,440 --> 02:02:38,200
We gotta turn everybody's brains upside down or not or we confirm right or what everybody and and me the silly the silly skeptic

1647
02:02:38,440 --> 02:02:43,720
Is proven wrong, but I start to get a little bit of fuel here because jim hill's backing me up a little bit

1648
02:02:43,720 --> 02:02:46,120
This person says I hope my heart doesn't get broken

1649
02:02:46,280 --> 02:02:52,760
He says what concerns me about this story is well, have you ever seen a photo of michael eisner playing golf?

1650
02:02:52,920 --> 02:02:54,760
I mean the guy's an obvious sports enthusiast

1651
02:02:54,760 --> 02:02:59,640
But when I just googled michael eisner and golf not a single image of disney's former ceo holding a club

1652
02:02:59,880 --> 02:03:02,280
Came up now. We kind of discussed this in the episode

1653
02:03:02,280 --> 02:03:06,360
This is one of my things when I went fishing in the supposed camp interview with larry king

1654
02:03:06,600 --> 02:03:12,440
I didn't find that instead. I found him talking to charlie rose and saying that he doesn't even like golf and then

1655
02:03:12,840 --> 02:03:19,640
Uh, madame jumbo jumps in there and the actual character from tumbo jumps into the replies

1656
02:03:19,960 --> 02:03:25,080
And finds this from disney war eisner had neither the time nor patience for golf

1657
02:03:25,240 --> 02:03:30,200
Though he'd occasionally played with his father and had a decent swing six months after joining bel-air

1658
02:03:30,360 --> 02:03:32,600
He had yet to sit foot on the course

1659
02:03:33,240 --> 02:03:36,680
Joins a country club because that's what you do when you're a ceo, right?

1660
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:41,080
But never put a spiky golf shoe into the grass

1661
02:03:41,720 --> 02:03:46,120
Um, so I don't know. I'm jim is adding to it a little bit

1662
02:03:46,200 --> 02:03:50,760
But still it does not get definitive here is the biggest thing that jim hill does

1663
02:03:51,240 --> 02:03:54,760
Uh in this conversation he uh brings up

1664
02:03:55,240 --> 02:03:57,880
Uh, he okay quote jim hill. Thank you jim

1665
02:03:58,840 --> 02:04:01,320
Okay, I just pulled out the media source book

1666
02:04:01,320 --> 02:04:08,040
I was handed by the disneyland resorts pr team when I attended the grand opening of dca back in february of 2001

1667
02:04:08,120 --> 02:04:13,640
First of all jealous of that would love to see that grand opening. Yeah, jim the places you've been grander than igua zoo

1668
02:04:14,760 --> 02:04:21,640
And this book says that rick rothchild directed the original iteration of soren. Let me reach out to him and see

1669
02:04:22,200 --> 02:04:25,080
Uh rick rothchild is a name. I was familiar with

1670
02:04:25,480 --> 02:04:28,200
Maybe we even brought it up in regards to soren before

1671
02:04:28,520 --> 02:04:35,560
Uh, this is an imagineering legend. Here are some of the things he was part of american adventure alien encounter

1672
02:04:35,880 --> 02:04:41,880
Star tours the adventures continue he led the team that came up with the idea for captain

1673
02:04:41,960 --> 02:04:49,240
io the backstory of captain io where they had to think of three ideas to present to michael jackson and george lucas

1674
02:04:49,560 --> 02:04:54,120
And one of them was a peter pan thing and thank fucking christ that one didn't get picked

1675
02:04:54,520 --> 02:04:59,160
Uh, but instead they landed on one that at the time they were calling the intergalactic music man

1676
02:04:59,560 --> 02:05:02,280
And michael and george were like that one for sure

1677
02:05:02,840 --> 02:05:06,600
and rick rothchild made that happen led to that happening and then

1678
02:05:06,840 --> 02:05:13,640
Uh most pertinent to us is that he directed the soren ride film, which I did not realize until jim brought this up

1679
02:05:13,720 --> 02:05:15,720
so now we've got

1680
02:05:15,880 --> 02:05:19,960
A pretty particular source that we can start working with here and I await

1681
02:05:20,360 --> 02:05:26,520
Jim reaching out to rick to come up with this answer. This does not happen and I don't hold this against jim

1682
02:05:26,920 --> 02:05:29,880
Uh a busy man sure, uh as am I

1683
02:05:30,600 --> 02:05:35,480
Frankly, but also I had to fucking know this this has been needed. This has been eating me up

1684
02:05:35,560 --> 02:05:40,520
Yeah, you guys said let's do soren like I do not want to do that soren too until we know this for sure

1685
02:05:40,840 --> 02:05:45,000
So I realized I had to make the connection but rick is not on a lot of the social media

1686
02:05:45,160 --> 02:05:49,400
I had to get on what I would call a not primary piece of social media

1687
02:05:49,720 --> 02:05:52,780
In order to reach out to imaginary legend rick rothchild

1688
02:05:53,480 --> 02:05:58,600
And right as we were recording an episode about phantasmic a couple of weeks ago

1689
02:05:58,680 --> 02:06:04,200
Wow, I opened a tab and like we were I was probably in the middle of a sentence and I just happened upon my email

1690
02:06:04,360 --> 02:06:08,360
And I saw you have received a written message from rick rothchild and I had to keep talking as if

1691
02:06:08,680 --> 02:06:14,440
That had not happened and like I wasn't very excited so professional. Uh, yes that shows you the kind of things, you know

1692
02:06:14,840 --> 02:06:18,120
It's like talking through an earthquake like not even letting it get to you

1693
02:06:18,840 --> 02:06:25,720
Uh, who knows the allure of tabs like even in the midst of a wonderful recording session

1694
02:06:25,800 --> 02:06:27,800
Oh, you try to not get a new tab

1695
02:06:27,960 --> 02:06:34,440
Yes, I know dazzling new information could be behind any turn any turn or uh, you know, uh, uh more

1696
02:06:34,840 --> 02:06:40,680
Deals for toys and cereal and stuff. Yeah. Yeah, I don't know how you turn off the notifications while we're doing this frankly

1697
02:06:40,840 --> 02:06:44,200
I've i've only bought a thing maybe once or twice

1698
02:06:44,840 --> 02:06:50,280
While doing the podcast you have purchased items once or twice. Oh, I wish I knew what they were

1699
02:06:50,280 --> 02:06:53,640
Yeah, I have not for a long time. Okay. Oh, that's good. You've been in the game

1700
02:06:53,720 --> 02:06:59,160
You know, I've been in zoom era. Look everybody got bored in zoom certainly in zoom era. Yeah, but anyway

1701
02:06:59,560 --> 02:07:04,280
Uh, yes mid record. I discovered that I had gotten the answer from

1702
02:07:04,760 --> 02:07:11,240
Great imagineer rick rothchild. He was there. We finally have an in-person source

1703
02:07:11,720 --> 02:07:13,000
Are we ready?

1704
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:14,280
to open

1705
02:07:14,280 --> 02:07:15,640
the arc

1706
02:07:15,640 --> 02:07:19,720
And discover the answer. Oh my god the official answer

1707
02:07:19,800 --> 02:07:26,120
This is where I had a feeling it was going to either you got the call sheet or you talked to a crew member

1708
02:07:26,600 --> 02:07:28,600
Yes, you know what and I was pursuing

1709
02:07:28,920 --> 02:07:32,760
Another lead and I want to shout out the people who were who were helping me with the lead

1710
02:07:33,160 --> 02:07:40,120
Uh, but I uh, let me let me do this one first the big one my correspondence with brick rothchild. Okay

1711
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:43,000
Uh, so, you know, he he said

1712
02:07:43,320 --> 02:07:47,800
Thanks for the note. Appreciate it complemented on some things and then we got into the business. Here we go

1713
02:07:48,360 --> 02:07:50,200
the answer is

1714
02:07:50,200 --> 02:07:51,880
That it is

1715
02:07:51,880 --> 02:07:53,880
a myth only wow

1716
02:07:54,360 --> 02:07:57,080
Wow, there it is. There it is the full message

1717
02:07:57,480 --> 02:08:03,080
Michael was not one of the golfers in the sequence we shot at the pga west golf course in palm desert

1718
02:08:03,560 --> 02:08:12,120
What michael did contribute was the additional financing to add a few final cg effects after screening my initial cut of the film

1719
02:08:12,520 --> 02:08:18,920
one of which was the golf ball that comes roaring up at us from the golfer who's teed off and

1720
02:08:19,560 --> 02:08:24,360
You of course know that when we added the golf ball, I asked for the mickey to be placed on it

1721
02:08:24,520 --> 02:08:29,160
It was our not so subtle mick hidden mickey in the film. Thank you for your nice comments

1722
02:08:29,400 --> 02:08:33,480
We talked a little more he gave me permission to read that on the show. Thank you rick

1723
02:08:34,120 --> 02:08:39,720
There you have it. Wow, wait till now michael eisner is not the golfer but in spirit

1724
02:08:40,600 --> 02:08:43,480
Well, this is the I know and as if people are feeling

1725
02:08:44,120 --> 02:08:50,840
Crushed by this news as if crushed by one of the now we know very heavy bricks from the pyramids of giza

1726
02:08:50,920 --> 02:08:53,800
Though I don't think there's some that aren't so heavy. Uh, but

1727
02:08:54,520 --> 02:09:01,560
Um, if if that info is depressing, uh, or shatters your your dreams as people have said untrue. I think jason is right

1728
02:09:01,960 --> 02:09:03,800
uh, I think that

1729
02:09:03,800 --> 02:09:08,520
By his approving that shot and making the ball fly at the camera

1730
02:09:09,080 --> 02:09:11,560
Isn't that in some way him?

1731
02:09:12,120 --> 02:09:19,720
Hitting the golf ball there would have been no golf ball without michael eisner giving the corporate. Okay and allowing for that

1732
02:09:20,280 --> 02:09:23,400
Uh that effect to be added so in a way

1733
02:09:24,040 --> 02:09:26,280
Isn't he the golfer and soren?

1734
02:09:27,160 --> 02:09:29,800
The answer is no, but it sounded like a nice thing to say

1735
02:09:29,880 --> 02:09:32,360
I thought I would cheer people up if I said something like that

1736
02:09:32,680 --> 02:09:39,320
Like lisa giving the book report about springfield and looking out and seeing everyone's faces. Well, look jason

1737
02:09:40,200 --> 02:09:41,960
That's something that you said

1738
02:09:41,960 --> 02:09:46,040
Uh online when I was in pursuit of this information you said this is like

1739
02:09:46,520 --> 02:09:51,800
the classic simpsons episode, uh lisa the iconoclast in which she learns that

1740
02:09:52,280 --> 02:09:56,040
Jebediah springfield the namesake of the town the founder of the town

1741
02:09:56,520 --> 02:10:02,360
Uh was in fact a murderous pirate and that everyone's myths about him were false and she goes to interrupt

1742
02:10:02,920 --> 02:10:04,920
the the big celebration of him

1743
02:10:05,720 --> 02:10:11,800
Where they they affirm that a noble spirit and biggins the smallest man and she has to get this information out

1744
02:10:12,040 --> 02:10:17,800
And when the moment comes she can't bring herself to do it because the myths about jebediah have meaning too

1745
02:10:18,360 --> 02:10:20,360
And that's why I would like to say

1746
02:10:21,080 --> 02:10:23,080
Michael eisner was

1747
02:10:23,160 --> 02:10:25,160
Michael eisner was

1748
02:10:25,320 --> 02:10:29,160
Great. I've been doing some research and michael eisner was

1749
02:10:30,120 --> 02:10:31,960
great

1750
02:10:31,960 --> 02:10:34,360
I just I just wanted to say that I just wanted to get that off the

1751
02:10:35,800 --> 02:10:37,480
I think look

1752
02:10:37,480 --> 02:10:40,920
There should there should have been a line in john lennon's imagine

1753
02:10:41,720 --> 02:10:46,600
Like what he's saying imagine there's no religion, you know, everybody would be living in peace today

1754
02:10:47,080 --> 02:10:49,080
Well, maybe this is a similar situation

1755
02:10:49,960 --> 02:10:54,440
Imagine people don't have the misconception that michael eisner hit the golf ball

1756
02:10:55,320 --> 02:10:59,960
Like what would the world be like today? They'd be all living. Maybe it's actually something that's bad

1757
02:11:00,680 --> 02:11:06,920
Maybe it's a belief that's actually holding humanity back and what you've done now is free everyone

1758
02:11:07,480 --> 02:11:12,200
From it. I hope so. You are a uap coming coming back

1759
02:11:12,680 --> 02:11:16,920
And opening our minds. I don't know what that is. But yes, isn't that mike's?

1760
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:22,760
That's well, that's the term for like a ufo now. Oh, okay. All right. Well, i'm not i'm not i'm no mike on this point

1761
02:11:22,760 --> 02:11:24,280
I don't know. So

1762
02:11:24,280 --> 02:11:26,600
so maybe what you've done now is you've

1763
02:11:27,480 --> 02:11:29,480
opened the eyes of the world

1764
02:11:29,880 --> 02:11:32,680
And perhaps society will be better from now on

1765
02:11:33,160 --> 02:11:38,360
I'd like to think so i'm trying to figure out how I mean, I think that you know, while we don't know his name

1766
02:11:38,840 --> 02:11:46,280
We now are not ascribing false qualities to michael eisner and taking away the excellent swing work of a great

1767
02:11:47,560 --> 02:11:48,840
day player actor

1768
02:11:48,840 --> 02:11:54,520
Right who was we were not nearly close enough to see the face of and I wish that I could tribute that person

1769
02:11:54,920 --> 02:11:59,640
Better, but if that person's out there and that's that's your father or someone who matters to you

1770
02:12:00,040 --> 02:12:02,200
Then now we can make sure that he gets his due

1771
02:12:02,680 --> 02:12:05,240
I mean not in the way not by name or anything

1772
02:12:05,240 --> 02:12:08,520
But just think there is an actor out there who was never given the proper credit

1773
02:12:08,600 --> 02:12:10,040
Well, then now we can do it

1774
02:12:10,040 --> 02:12:10,280
You know

1775
02:12:10,280 --> 02:12:14,760
We got to shine more light on the day players of the world and less on the ceos even the ones who we love

1776
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:16,840
I completely agree with you

1777
02:12:16,840 --> 02:12:19,720
Um, and there's two things. Yeah, like we at the very least

1778
02:12:19,720 --> 02:12:23,000
I would like to know the name of the actor who swung the golf ball. Yeah, number two

1779
02:12:23,800 --> 02:12:27,000
I want to find out who created this rumor

1780
02:12:27,640 --> 02:12:29,640
Yeah, and I want to get revenge

1781
02:12:30,120 --> 02:12:33,720
Yeah for giving us this false hope of this fun thing

1782
02:12:33,880 --> 02:12:34,360
Yeah

1783
02:12:34,360 --> 02:12:40,200
That we've all been you know, because yeah think about that before you get mad at me before the torches come for me

1784
02:12:40,760 --> 02:12:46,840
Really it should be mad at whoever lied about exactly and everybody who is complicit in that game of telephone

1785
02:12:47,080 --> 02:12:51,960
That's been going since the mid 2000s. I really do wonder where did this come from?

1786
02:12:52,040 --> 02:12:54,520
exactly was it a conflation of

1787
02:12:55,000 --> 02:13:00,200
Did some did somebody some was it a game of telephone of the story that rick told me right where?

1788
02:13:00,680 --> 02:13:04,120
That was a like special little touch that michael eisner made possible

1789
02:13:04,360 --> 02:13:08,760
And then a couple steps later it becomes that he is the one hitting the golf very possible

1790
02:13:09,480 --> 02:13:13,880
Is it just like one of the like the guides the disneyland guides or something?

1791
02:13:14,520 --> 02:13:17,640
Made it up like I don't like it could be anything. Mm-hmm

1792
02:13:17,880 --> 02:13:22,280
I hope that person was was rooted out for their lies. Yeah, because you know look

1793
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:25,480
It seemed like a more innocent time in the early 2000s

1794
02:13:25,480 --> 02:13:30,120
But now that we live in the era of fake news and falsehoods, right?

1795
02:13:30,360 --> 02:13:36,520
And this was you know, this is gonna have a big impact on our upcoming election if we don't start, you know rooting out

1796
02:13:37,320 --> 02:13:41,400
Lies and untruths, you know, these these things happened, you know

1797
02:13:42,020 --> 02:13:47,880
September 11th happened a guy who isn't michael eisner hitting a golf ball happened. That's right

1798
02:13:48,040 --> 02:13:50,040
Not everything is subjective

1799
02:13:50,360 --> 02:13:52,360
I agree and I think

1800
02:13:52,440 --> 02:13:53,480
jim

1801
02:13:53,480 --> 02:13:55,480
Hill we call on, you know

1802
02:13:55,800 --> 02:13:57,800
to find the offender

1803
02:13:58,360 --> 02:14:00,760
And to seek the ultimate

1804
02:14:01,800 --> 02:14:05,800
Mike is waving around that bowie knife. He usually has when recording

1805
02:14:06,360 --> 02:14:08,360
Jim, you know what to do

1806
02:14:08,440 --> 02:14:15,000
When you find out this person who created this vile rumor. Yeah initiate operation four

1807
02:14:15,720 --> 02:14:20,840
Which is where a blunt object is fired from a large distance at the head of a liar

1808
02:14:21,720 --> 02:14:24,220
Well, I call it operation. Uh, that's it exactly

1809
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:27,800
He knows what i'm talking about

1810
02:14:27,800 --> 02:14:32,600
I mean whoever did this undermines the entire thing, you know, we these stories, you know

1811
02:14:32,680 --> 02:14:39,000
Is that not what this sure this podcast became about uh, uh rants and jokes and sidetracks

1812
02:14:39,240 --> 02:14:43,960
But did it not start as a place for us to tell the facts that we know

1813
02:14:44,360 --> 02:14:50,760
That we've only told to our significant others who we are bruising in the seats next to us as we pound into their legs

1814
02:14:50,840 --> 02:14:52,360
Don't you know that's interesting?

1815
02:14:52,360 --> 02:14:55,960
We decided to take that and try to get an audience who wanted to hear it, right?

1816
02:14:55,960 --> 02:15:01,800
That's what this whole thing was originally based in is telling these sharing the uh, you know

1817
02:15:01,880 --> 02:15:09,000
passing along the oral history of these same three stories that are told about every ride and to learn that one of them was

1818
02:15:09,320 --> 02:15:14,520
Fake was completely fake for all this time the whole to quote sally field and mrs

1819
02:15:14,520 --> 02:15:17,400
Doubtfire the whole time the whole time the whole time

1820
02:15:17,880 --> 02:15:20,280
That's how I feel. I'm sally filled it up

1821
02:15:20,760 --> 02:15:23,800
And uh, and that's and I agree so before you get mad at me

1822
02:15:23,880 --> 02:15:28,520
We need to because this this person this rat who started this wrong story

1823
02:15:28,600 --> 02:15:33,160
Yeah, threatens to undermine the whole thing now. It's like we can't trust the you know

1824
02:15:33,240 --> 02:15:36,280
I mean, thank god some that the breck eisner stories

1825
02:15:36,680 --> 02:15:42,760
Uh, uh come from tony himself a source that we trust because otherwise I say if we if we can't

1826
02:15:43,160 --> 02:15:48,040
Pin these stories to a specific person who's who who we love and we're true

1827
02:15:48,120 --> 02:15:52,360
We trust over many decades then we got to question everything. How high up do you think?

1828
02:15:52,360 --> 02:15:55,080
Do you think josh demaro knows that it's not eisner?

1829
02:15:56,040 --> 02:15:57,480
Do you think he knows?

1830
02:15:57,480 --> 02:16:00,600
Hmm. Do you think he's I mean he's heard it at the very least

1831
02:16:00,920 --> 02:16:02,920
Do you think why why do you bring up him?

1832
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:08,840
I just wonder like do people in the company actually believe this is because this rumor again felt like fact

1833
02:16:09,080 --> 02:16:13,720
Of all the different things we ever talk about this one felt like the most fact it had never occurred to me before

1834
02:16:14,200 --> 02:16:17,720
The episode I didn't I didn't expect to be in to end up on this journey

1835
02:16:17,960 --> 02:16:23,000
I didn't expect to ultimately be the whistleblower on this. Yeah, although now that I am listeners

1836
02:16:23,080 --> 02:16:28,760
Please go update all pertinent wikipedia's and source me and podcast the ride appreciate it. Thank you

1837
02:16:28,840 --> 02:16:30,840
Yeah, and for now just say

1838
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:33,000
whoever made the lie

1839
02:16:33,320 --> 02:16:37,160
We've got top men looking into it the top man man

1840
02:16:38,360 --> 02:16:40,360
jim hill jim hill

1841
02:16:40,520 --> 02:16:42,840
Uh disney disney blogger slash assassin

1842
02:16:45,640 --> 02:16:47,640
Jim has that on his business card, I assume

1843
02:16:48,200 --> 02:16:50,200
Yeah

1844
02:16:50,360 --> 02:16:56,200
That's right, that's all right. That's where he's been making his money all these years. Yeah, he uses like assassin work. He uses one of us

1845
02:16:56,760 --> 02:16:57,640
uh

1846
02:16:57,640 --> 02:16:59,640
galaxy's edge of lightsabers

1847
02:16:59,720 --> 02:17:05,000
Or well and he has the john wick. He has the cool the gold coins. He also has gold coins. It will give you

1848
02:17:05,720 --> 02:17:11,160
Uh one hotel room or one assassination, you know, if you're if you're backs up against the wall

1849
02:17:11,160 --> 02:17:14,040
You could turn anything into a weapon. Um, yeah

1850
02:17:14,200 --> 02:17:16,920
We got we got to get him on it and and you know

1851
02:17:17,080 --> 02:17:21,800
I I hope that this information is is more interesting than it is disheartening

1852
02:17:21,800 --> 02:17:25,080
I hope that I haven't shattered anybody's uh vision of anything here

1853
02:17:25,160 --> 02:17:29,800
But one thing I just want to say for all the talk about like theme park journalism

1854
02:17:30,040 --> 02:17:32,040
I feel like I actually went did it

1855
02:17:34,520 --> 02:17:41,000
We can actually be a source on this thing, yeah, yeah, uh, you know people might be angry at us, but uh, I don't know

1856
02:17:41,480 --> 02:17:45,480
Uh this yeah, we we actually maybe for the first time

1857
02:17:45,960 --> 02:17:51,960
Yeah, we revealed something that is actually our that's really the victory of it here the things that we

1858
02:17:52,520 --> 02:17:53,400
uh

1859
02:17:53,400 --> 02:17:57,000
Squeeze people's legs to make sure they know about finally one of them comes from us

1860
02:17:57,160 --> 02:18:01,720
Right. Did you know that that golfer is not disney ceo michael eisner?

1861
02:18:01,960 --> 02:18:07,720
It's some guy whose name we don't know. Oh what I what are you telling me this? It seems like I need more context

1862
02:18:08,680 --> 02:18:14,600
No, actually I mostly yes, I would believe that most people on screen in a movie are like an actor or something

1863
02:18:14,840 --> 02:18:20,120
Yeah, well him too. Why would it be him? I don't know because for decades people said otherwise, but in fact

1864
02:18:20,600 --> 02:18:24,840
Okay, uh, it's it's like a within theme park where it doesn't this doesn't matter to almost anybody

1865
02:18:24,840 --> 02:18:29,240
But it's like proving that the thing about like the munchkin hanging themselves in the wizard, right?

1866
02:18:29,240 --> 02:18:30,440
Right, that's not true

1867
02:18:30,440 --> 02:18:35,960
It's like one of the like it's like we found one of these long held things and actually we're we're able to turn it over

1868
02:18:36,120 --> 02:18:38,120
And I apologize. I'm gonna try to do this

1869
02:18:38,440 --> 02:18:44,680
Really quickly because I when when all was seeming lost on this and I was seeing nothing but dis bloggy mommies saying no

1870
02:18:44,680 --> 02:18:50,440
It's him. It was people even told me that i've got definitive proof that it is it is him really and then didn't really

1871
02:18:51,160 --> 02:18:59,320
Follow up with it. Uh, um, so let me please credit call out the people who said because I I was googling it and

1872
02:19:00,280 --> 02:19:05,880
somebody said contrary to popular belief the golfer is not michael eisner and

1873
02:19:06,120 --> 02:19:10,040
I reached out to this person and uh, let me see

1874
02:19:10,760 --> 02:19:14,600
David kintonia is the uh, who is on

1875
02:19:15,400 --> 02:19:20,600
Instagram and does a lot of great parks posting actually. Let me try to find their handle

1876
02:19:21,220 --> 02:19:28,120
Apologize for the cut any of this if it's clunky qs underscore trips people might be following david already great

1877
02:19:28,920 --> 02:19:31,720
Disney photos and factoids and info

1878
02:19:32,680 --> 02:19:34,280
And when I reached out

1879
02:19:34,280 --> 02:19:36,680
He said hey, i'm a fan of the show

1880
02:19:37,400 --> 02:19:41,640
And I know this because I know somebody who works at the parks and has access to imaginary archives

1881
02:19:41,800 --> 02:19:47,000
And they were on the case about maybe I was wondering if this is gonna lead to like finding the call sheet or something

1882
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:49,320
right, uh, um, so that was like

1883
02:19:49,800 --> 02:19:54,520
Uh on the way, uh didn't end it but but I think they they would have been the source on this

1884
02:19:54,520 --> 02:19:59,160
So I I did have a a backup and somebody and david. Thank you for uh for giving me hope

1885
02:19:59,480 --> 02:20:05,960
Uh when I was feeling insane about it, but now we all know and not only that I reached out to david

1886
02:20:06,360 --> 02:20:11,800
And he said, uh, you know what? I really love the show and also you're right about that thing about cues

1887
02:20:12,200 --> 02:20:14,760
Uh, uh, every cue is ultimately skippable

1888
02:20:15,960 --> 02:20:20,920
So i'm feeling fucking great at this point. Let's bring him on bring him on bring him on the show

1889
02:20:21,800 --> 02:20:25,400
You come in here and you stand in your position. I'm gonna send jim hill after him

1890
02:20:25,400 --> 02:20:27,400
Yeah

1891
02:20:27,480 --> 02:20:30,840
So I think I think that's that do you guys do we do we feel okay?

1892
02:20:31,160 --> 02:20:33,400
Are we I mean I ask that to the listeners too

1893
02:20:33,640 --> 02:20:38,440
Or do we feel now that we've shattered something bigger than belief in god the only reason I feel okay is that I know

1894
02:20:38,760 --> 02:20:43,880
That sometime hopefully fingers crossed this year. The three of us will have to separately read michael eisner's camp

1895
02:20:44,280 --> 02:20:50,120
Yeah, and then do an episode so I feel like I have fun eisner things to look forward to what if we get into that?

1896
02:20:50,360 --> 02:20:54,280
Like one of us reads the abridged version and we're like, okay

1897
02:20:54,360 --> 02:20:59,800
Well interesting heartwarming tales the man is fascinating and greaves a great story

1898
02:21:00,120 --> 02:21:04,040
And then one of us reads the unabridged and it's like he says it's him

1899
02:21:04,280 --> 02:21:06,280
The proof has been in camp this whole time

1900
02:21:06,920 --> 02:21:12,040
If you ever see anybody out there if you ever see if that rat rick rothschild ever says it's not me

1901
02:21:12,760 --> 02:21:14,760
I

1902
02:21:14,760 --> 02:21:20,520
Wouldn't recorded right and please do not ever abridge this publishers of camp do not over my dead body

1903
02:21:20,520 --> 02:21:21,800
Do you take this out of the well?

1904
02:21:21,800 --> 02:21:24,600
I um, you know talk about doing things while recording

1905
02:21:24,600 --> 02:21:31,480
I borrowed both the ebook and the audiobook while we were you had to you had to get ahead of the line. I

1906
02:21:31,960 --> 02:21:33,080
Oh, yeah

1907
02:21:33,080 --> 02:21:40,440
Especially when this episode comes out. It's gonna be a big rush. Yes in all in all library digital systems across america. Yeah

1908
02:21:41,320 --> 02:21:45,000
Has there any guys did they try to adapt camp into any sort of show?

1909
02:21:46,280 --> 02:21:50,920
Young michael or do you think that's what the movie camp? I don't think it was the same

1910
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:56,440
I don't know. I don't think that's what that was but i'm just saying michael has company now. They make cartoons and stuff

1911
02:21:57,560 --> 02:21:59,240
What's the why not?

1912
02:21:59,240 --> 02:22:05,240
Yeah, all right. All right camp. Let's let's party any way you want it. That's the way you need it

1913
02:22:05,640 --> 02:22:09,000
And then yeah, he then he's like and he's making out with a couple babes sure

1914
02:22:09,080 --> 02:22:11,800
Yeah, and that's the and that's the story of how I saved summer

1915
02:22:12,360 --> 02:22:13,800
summer camp island

1916
02:22:13,800 --> 02:22:18,360
Uh, the cartoon network show is not based on michael eiser's book. I feel as far as I know

1917
02:22:19,960 --> 02:22:20,280
You know

1918
02:22:20,280 --> 02:22:22,760
But even but you know the things we thought were definitive now

1919
02:22:22,840 --> 02:22:27,480
Who knows if any of them maybe that whole thing has been ripping off stories from camp this entire time

1920
02:22:27,880 --> 02:22:34,200
Believe nothing. I dropped a coffee mug in the bottom says actually it is the basis for summer camp

1921
02:22:34,920 --> 02:22:37,880
How else are we supposed to think of a bunch of camp stories make them up?

1922
02:22:37,960 --> 02:22:40,200
No, we had to steal them from michael eisner's book

1923
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:45,800
Um, well there you have it. I did it. You did it within an inch. Give him a round of applause

1924
02:22:47,240 --> 02:22:48,120
Thanks

1925
02:22:48,120 --> 02:22:55,400
I it really it it overtook me. Uh, you know, I did I make it to uh, you know yarn all over my apartment

1926
02:22:55,480 --> 02:22:59,160
Not quite. Yeah, but I was going to if some of these things didn't come through sure

1927
02:22:59,240 --> 02:23:06,920
So I thank rick rothschild for coming through and for all the amazing stuff he did that shaped our childhoods indelibly and for soren
