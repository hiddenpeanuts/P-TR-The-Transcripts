1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
One, two, ready.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:10,000
There was darkness on the street, Ralph Brennan, he had won.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:18,000
He summoned the power of his jazz, and the podcast boys were done.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Now we're in the underworld, and I can't lie we're scared.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Ghosts of stores are all around, like the ruins of a builder bear.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The downtown Disney ordeal, a shuttered hog and does how must Jason feel?

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:53,000
The downtown Disney ordeal, what ghastly secrets does the house of blues conceal?

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Hello again, three long days in the underworld.

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:05,000
We find ourselves now in level X, stage three, trying to keep on trying to survive.

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm Scott Gardner, Mike Carlson, how are you?

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Dearest listener, how I long for the real levels and stages and not this underworld.

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
It's so much different.

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
So much different.

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Vastly not just arbitrarily different.

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Jason Sheridan.

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I like it down here, it's kind of a warm, humid heat.

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
And we know I'm fond of that.

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Well, I do.

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Yeah, your socks are soaking wet.

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I know.

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Maybe you're better off in the underworld.

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You know, maybe.

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I just, you know, I'm so stressed out and I'm like, you know, we're tired, we're running out of food,

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:47,000
and I just wish I could get a decent meal, get some remoulade or some beef lava nachos.

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Hopefully, I'm not sure where we're going today, but maybe some of that could be in the pipes, I hope.

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
But before that, let's introduce, oh my God, wait.

27
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I mean, surprise.

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Look who we ran into.

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I can't believe it.

30
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Hey, guys.

31
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Surprise.

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You're down here too.

33
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Oh my God, you're kidding.

34
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
It's a friend of the show, past guest of the show,

35
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
and person who since she was a guest on the show wrote an episode of The Simpsons.

36
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Julia Prescott is here.

37
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Hi, hi.

38
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
It's so good to be here.

39
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
You're out of breath too.

40
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Yeah, I've just been chasing around this labyrinth for days.

41
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I mean, I truly don't know what day it is.

42
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It's been so long.

43
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
We haven't even run into the labyrinth.

44
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Let's hope we don't fall into that or we'll never make it out.

45
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
That's another separate episode on my Patreon episode podcast.

46
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Oh my gosh.

47
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Hi, it's good to be here.

48
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Hi.

49
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Thanks for being here.

50
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It's nice to see a familiar face.

51
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
So good to see you again.

52
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
So good to run into you again.

53
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,000
And also, in terms of things that have happened since you joined us before,

54
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,000
you came and talked about a shopping center that's even worse than downtown Disney,

55
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
the Zia Village, Paris.

56
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,000
But recently, you had this very popular tweet that was in territory,

57
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
very familiar to us and to our listeners.

58
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I feel like I had to ask you about that.

59
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Are you talking about being rejected from a writing job and going to Disneyland alone?

60
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
That's correct.

61
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I went viral for being lonely.

62
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
My mom is very proud.

63
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
And I will say, you guys understand.

64
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I think that people thought...

65
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
The stories seem to be presented as like,

66
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:41,000
here's a woman who bought a ticket to go to Disneyland as a fuck you to whoever rejected her.

67
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
And I have a pass.

68
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I just want to get that out there.

69
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It was a very easy choice for me, as I mentioned, don't currently have a job.

70
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
So it was very easy to make that decision.

71
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
But yeah, getting like live tweeting the experience, I think resonated with some people.

72
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:07,000
But then something I didn't anticipate was I got another job rejection while I was mourning my previous job rejection at Disneyland.

73
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
And that shifted things and I believe kicked it into high gear.

74
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Geez, you added information during this event.

75
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Yeah, hey, the industry's fun, everybody.

76
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I feel like that's a microcosm.

77
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
That's what this podcast is in general, I feel like, is us.

78
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Well, we need to do something while we get rejected from doing it after.

79
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Why don't we talk about theme parks for a while?

80
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Yeah, that's a sort of can do attitude that young Emily Dickinson has on Apple TV plus is Dickinson Apple TV plus.

81
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Please sponsor this podcast.

82
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Is that is that an edgy Dickinson?

83
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Have you watched it?

84
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I was. It looks like the Dickinson who fucks.

85
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
That's what it looks like to me.

86
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
You are 100 percent correct.

87
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I was in an Apple store and I watched most of the pilot.

88
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Great.

89
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Wait, you watched it or just to watch the TV?

90
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Huh? Like it's a best buy in the 90s.

91
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Jason doesn't want to pay for Apple plus something.

92
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Yeah, you were waiting for the TV show to end.

93
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I was waiting for a friend to get their phone set up.

94
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,000
OK. And and so I was like fiddling around with all the Apple TV displays and I was like, oh, Apple TV is live.

95
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
And and I just started watching Dickinson.

96
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Hmm. And in the store like the Disney stores now they have stores.

97
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'm sitting on a.

98
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,000
You can watch you can sit and watch the shows like it's a like a porn video store.

99
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Yeah, I mean, it's just set up.

100
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
It's logged in.

101
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Apple TV. They want people checking out Apple.

102
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It just sounds like you're hanging out in the boyfriend gallows of this Apple.

103
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
That is exactly what I was doing.

104
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Yeah.

105
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
So yeah, Toby Hus plays her father.

106
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Already the strongest man in the world.

107
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Good for Toby.

108
00:05:51,000 --> 00:06:01,000
So funny you say that Toby, Toby has also very good on Haldin Catch Fire and he the Toby is a lot like I feel or maybe I should say the other way around.

109
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
There's somebody we're going to talk about in this episode who feels like a Toby Hus character.

110
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Hmm.

111
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:14,000
The perhaps the CEO of Rainforest Cafe Tillman for Tita Tillman for Tita.

112
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Yeah, feels very Toby Hussey.

113
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Which is his real name. I know it is, but it just sounds like I want to work in food entertainment.

114
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'm going to name myself something that vaguely sounds like a weird festive food dish.

115
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Or maybe he who didn't like people pronouncing it tit and he's like I have to can I say that it's got to get ahead of it because I'm in restaurants.

116
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Well, well, but wait a minute. Is that even I'm making a big leap at that.

117
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Yeah, you didn't talking about let's make sure let's get our official assignment from the Sector Keeper.

118
00:06:46,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Boys, boys, today's stage contains Rainforest Cafe, Yareba Yareba and the House of Blues.

119
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Best of luck, boys.

120
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
All right, I was right. I don't know.

121
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
You were right.

122
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Good luck at work.

123
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Rainforest Cafe and wait a minute.

124
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Now, this is actually funny that we bump into you and we're talking about the Rainforest Cafe.

125
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Don't you have some history with the Rainforest Cafe?

126
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
That's absolutely correct, Scott. Thanks so much for saying that.

127
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Yeah, I used to work at the Rainforest Cafe gift shop.

128
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I have to make that distinction at Downtown Disney.

129
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Which hopefully is in this level.

130
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
It's not right here to answer that question.

131
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Oh, yeah, yeah.

132
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I'm sure it'd be the most complicated possible answer.

133
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Why not? Oh, look at there's vape smoke that have just come up in a yes.

134
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
It's a Sector Keeper vape now.

135
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Sector Keeper vape.

136
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Vape vapor.

137
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
What's that?

138
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Does he want to die? Oh, he's a ghost. I forgot.

139
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
He's already. Yeah. So he's kind of already made of vapor.

140
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
He's kind of taunting us, I guess.

141
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Yeah. And that smells a little.

142
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I get a sense of a little bit of honey mustard on that.

143
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
A little bit of ranch maybe too.

144
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
He tries a lot of experimental.

145
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Yeah, I will say I just want to say immediately about my experience with the Rainforest Cafe.

146
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Darkest time of my life.

147
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Oh, no.

148
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I was a very depressed 19 year old who had just transferred to Chapman University

149
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
from a real shitty art school in the Bay Area.

150
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
And I transferred there and didn't have any friends at college.

151
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Partly because I was a transfer student, partly because I often fucked off

152
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
and went to Disneyland because I could because I worked at the Rainforest Cafe.

153
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:40,000
So this was like everything about my life and nothing about my life at the same time.

154
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
This is very strange because and I must have talked about this in the podcast before,

155
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
but I was deciding where to go for college.

156
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I was deciding between Chapman and LMU where I ended up going.

157
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
And I went and like, well, let me see what the area is like around Chapman.

158
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I would be close to Disney.

159
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
And I went down with a friend of mine and we got too high.

160
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
And I sat at the Rainforest Cafe and I freaked out and it made me not want to go.

161
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I was like, this is going to be my life.

162
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I'll just be like weird and alone and pretending I like weed at Disney all the time.

163
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
It truly that was the spot that changed my whole trajectory in a lot of ways.

164
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I was your sliding doors reality of that choice that you did not make.

165
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I made that choice and lived your life.

166
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Things are good now, but I would have had to live through a real miserable,

167
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
how many months stretch of time working at that store?

168
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Oh, yeah. I mean, I didn't work there for, I want to say longer than two semesters.

169
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
And I remember like going home for Christmas, home for Christmas.

170
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I lived in North Hollywood.

171
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
But like being like, all right, well, I'm going on winter break.

172
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
And I just remember my manager being like, okay, great.

173
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Will you come back in the spring?

174
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
And I went, sure.

175
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:01,000
And like never came back again and just like, you know, walked away from the fire as I lit it, you know, that kind of thing.

176
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
So we'll get into that.

177
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I want to say really quick something that I was delighted to remember today.

178
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Do you guys know the different names for the people that work at the Rainforest Cafe?

179
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Certainly not.

180
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
No, no. Oh, boy, please.

181
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Well, first you've got your Safari guides, which are the servers, which they, when I was working there,

182
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
made it very clear that they were different than the gift shop people.

183
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:31,000
There was some animosity that I didn't engage in, but it definitely was like some hierarchy levels.

184
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Then there are the tour guides, which are your hosts and hostesses.

185
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Because it's a tour, you're in a jungle.

186
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Yes, you're in a jungle.

187
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Then there are the Pathfinders, your retail sales associates, aka me.

188
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:51,000
And then you have your Navigators, which are the bartenders and your Safari Assistants, which are your bussers.

189
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:58,000
And if I'm sure you ever called the bussers a Safari Assistant, they would spit in your food because they were very much the low of the low.

190
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
And then you have the animal curators, which didn't have like their cutesy name.

191
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
But I did research and find that one woman was known as the Parrot Lady.

192
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,000
And she very much wanted that to be the first thing you called her and then like her name.

193
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
So it'd be like the Parrot Lady, Genie, you know.

194
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
So she, oh, right. So they were walking around with real parrots.

195
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Yeah, yeah. And all of the rainforest cafes at one point had real animals.

196
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:35,000
And I read somewhere that it cost them for each store, it was like a hundred grand a year to like pay for the people that were handling the animals

197
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
and to like feed the animals and stuff. And so slowly they're like, yeah, shit, this is unsustainable.

198
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
And then Dantus was one of the last that still had animals. And they did when I worked there.

199
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
They did little shows outside the restaurant, too. There's still, if you go there, a little stage.

200
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
There's still shows now that they do.

201
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Oh, what?

202
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Yeah. I want to say that I was there a couple months ago and, you know, Rainforest Cafe is all boarded up.

203
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:04,000
But then you still have like this woman with a parrot that comes out and tries to distract toddlers for like 10 minutes.

204
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
A woman with a parrot. Hang on. What's the proper name?

205
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Oh, the parrot lady.

206
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
The parrot lady. That's a classy title.

207
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Yeah.

208
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
What animals did they have when you were working there? Was it just parrots?

209
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Just parrots. And I want to say maybe a reptile or two. What did you say?

210
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
A tiger.

211
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:31,000
A tiger. And a tiger. Yeah, it was mostly birds. And then I want to say like some reptiles, like something that was very easy to sort of bring out.

212
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I will say that like the backstage area for working there, like you have to go, you know, through this little side gate and you walk down and then there's like this vending machine that isn't filled with anything that's vending machine-y.

213
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:54,000
It's just like packets of socks and shaving kits because of the Disney mandate for having your facial hair be trimmed a certain way.

214
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:06,000
And then you go down this like underground tunnel and you find yourself in a hallway where, you know, your normal manager people offices are and then you'll have the office for all the animals.

215
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,000
And that was just like such a weird thing to like pass on your way to a kitchen in a restaurant.

216
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:20,000
So I just remember that. And also just it's such a thrill to be a cast member in a backstage area. I just got to say.

217
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Oh, yeah, that's true.

218
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
That was really the only thrill about working there.

219
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Yeah, yeah. When you're in this like themed temple, but in like the boring part of it.

220
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I mean, that's always the dream to be in a themed place in a boring hallway.

221
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Exactly. I just want to have like authority at a place that I like am already really enamored with.

222
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
But then like that that wore off very quickly.

223
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Yeah, yeah, I can imagine. So your job as a... sorry, what was your title again?

224
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I was a Pathfinder.

225
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
A Pathfinder.

226
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
And I think I still have my outfit somewhere.

227
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Were you supposed to keep it? Probably not.

228
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I don't know.

229
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Yeah.

230
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
It sounds like you just ghosted them. You just walked out one day and didn't come back.

231
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:06,000
So I ghosted them. I mean, maybe I feel like I probably made a call because I'm very responsible.

232
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:19,000
But even then. But I also kind of ghosted. I worked very briefly at CityWalk at the Starbucks there for, I want to say, a brisk two weeks during Halloween Horror Nights.

233
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:31,000
And it was around the time of this age for me, too. But that was a whole other case where, and hopefully they've changed things, they would schedule you for 3 p.m. to question mark.

234
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:38,000
And you would just have to roll with it until you were done. So I ghosted on that a little bit, too.

235
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Understandably. Yeah.

236
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,000
But I did give it like a good two weeks. I was like, I don't know, maybe things are going to turn around. They just never did.

237
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I could get discovered by a Hollywood producer.

238
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Well, that was for sure not happening at the Universal CityWalk.

239
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Something resembling it.

240
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Was the outfit just like the safari tan?

241
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:04,000
It was. It was a safari tan shirt. And then you had your name tag. The shirts were always like two sizes larger than they told you.

242
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:14,000
So I was swimming in mine. And I want to say that I had to buy my own khakis and buy my own like those generic all black like Walmart service worker shoes.

243
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:20,000
And it just at the end of it didn't matter like how long the shift was. It could have been four hours. It could have been eight.

244
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I would be so exhausted because they just never want you to sit or do anything.

245
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I had to constantly just be rearranging plush frogs and like, you know, just like refolding shirts.

246
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:39,000
And honestly, because, you know, the gift shop is not an area where people are like, oh, goody, it's just like a place to kill time.

247
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:45,000
And so more often than not, we would have like teenagers that would like come in and like fuck our shit up.

248
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
And I'd be like, oh, sweet. Now I have something to do. And like actually really enjoyed it.

249
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Just being like, oh, because otherwise you're just like staring into space and hearing the same Calypso playlist.

250
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Like just reshuffle over and over and over, which I tried to find before coming over here today.

251
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:11,000
And I noticed this really bizarre trend on Spotify of like, I'm going to guess teens making playlists that they call Rainforest Cafe.

252
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
But it is not anything to do with Rainforest Cafe music.

253
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:21,000
And it has like Ariana Grande on it and other stuff. But they just call it that. It was weird.

254
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Yeah, like vapor wavy way of naming things. Yeah. Some weird like inside joke between like twelve teens.

255
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Interesting. Was there any like expertise that you needed to know?

256
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Did you need to know like the types of the animals or anything? Or is there any qualification?

257
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I'm so glad you asked me that. I mean, there was and there wasn't.

258
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:51,000
It was a bizarre place to work, which I'm sure you guys can relate in working like bizarre, even industry entertainment industry jobs.

259
00:16:51,000 --> 00:17:04,000
But where they like acted like we since we were working there that we had to be as obsessed or invested, I will say, in like tree frogs, the tree frogs.

260
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Yeah, because they have a whole like weird, you know, kind of Ronald McDonald esque series of characters that we were supposed to familiarize ourselves with.

261
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
We were just at the Schomburg location.

262
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I didn't write them all down, but I did note I at least took pictures of like there's like a crest in the store of like here's the great big one.

263
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Whatever. I don't have a number. You're talking about the wild bunch.

264
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Oh, that's the name. Wild. What is the frog's name? First and foremost.

265
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
The frog's name is Cha Cha Jason. Very good.

266
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,000
We love Cha Cha. Cha Cha is their Mickey. They fucking love Cha Cha.

267
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I have an item on the menu that is chicken shimmy cha cha's. What? Shimmy cha cha's.

268
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:55,000
If we're I mean, I imagine the menu portion of this conversation is going to be its own chapter.

269
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Yeah, yeah. A thing that stuck out in Schomburg to me, we found the clearance nook.

270
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Like there was a dead end of the store that was all the clearance items that featured what appeared to be a stairway carved into a cave with a dragonfly statue facing away from you.

271
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,000
And the dragonfly looked like it was I must descend these stairs so I may die.

272
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Like it just looked like the dragonfly was like Blair Witch in it, like just standing in the corner.

273
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:41,000
It reminded me of this this this weird like little like stairway corridor thing where hummingbirds keep getting trapped in my apartment building and my wife.

274
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,000
And now as a knows how to save them really well. But it felt like the same like this is this dragonfly is going to die.

275
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,000
If we don't get this nectar soon, it's going to get trapped in this weird little corner.

276
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Yeah, it's very yeah. Why? What the fuck? Why are facing away from you? Giant dragonfly?

277
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I feel like and listen, not to brag, but I've been in a couple of rainforest cafes and yeah.

278
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:10,000
And I feel like and we we can get into it. There was an ownership change.

279
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:16,000
The guy who originally founded it sold it to Landry's, I want to say, at the end of the 90s.

280
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Or maybe 2000 and he was very bummed about it. And then maybe this was him making a big stink about like they've changed everything. The menus different.

281
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I think that there is some truth to what did happen.

282
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:40,000
But I also feel like similar to what we see with a lot of these sort of corporate merger things and like how the second chapter after the merger or the acquisition is like never as shiny as the start.

283
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Because it's all like, you know, just thinking about the almighty dollar. So like corners are cut. And I feel like a lot of these restaurants were like, you know, made in very hasty ways.

284
00:19:51,000 --> 00:20:08,000
And so then you get the weird dragonfly statue that makes no sense and is almost Christ like or just things that are, you know, not really well thought out and which is so bizarre because especially with this rainforest cafe, it is in the shadow of greatness.

285
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
And yet great best themed environment.

286
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Yeah. And yet it still, you know, was falling short. And I do remember like the gorilla robot breaking down all the time and have a name.

287
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Oh, yeah, we should get in the wild bunch. Thank you so much for reminding me. That's Bamba.

288
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
The strong but very kind gorilla.

289
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Good to know that he's kind. Yeah. He's strong, but very kind. His brother is strong, but vicious, strong, but mean.

290
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Anyone else in the wild bunch you want to name check? Absolutely. There's Tuki. He's the amusing and curious baby elephant.

291
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:57,000
There's Nile, the crocodile with a large appetite for fun. This is some copywriting ass words by the way.

292
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Thesaurus. Yeah. Maya, the fearless jaguar is the protector of the rainforest.

293
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Then there's Rio, the swift and musical McCall who loves to sing and dance.

294
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Though I didn't see it when I was there.

295
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
What's the proof you love this? Excuse me.

296
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Iggy, the iguana is the oldest and wisest of the bunch. And then there's Ozzy, the wacky yet big hearted orangutan.

297
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:32,000
This is one of now many in our previous episodes back up where the light was in the main levels.

298
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:39,000
We've run into a lot of gangs in this. Who is it? There's Legos coming up.

299
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:46,000
There's the Pandora Charm. I forget the name of them already. Are they the Pandora friends?

300
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:53,000
It's been so long. We've been trapped here. There's Pandora original specific IP. For the jewelry?

301
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Yeah. That's right. What? That is insane. Charm characters.

302
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Did you cover the Anne Getty store in the underground? That was yesterday in the underworld.

303
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:12,000
We closed out on Anne Getty's. I was going to say it'd be really dark if Anne Getty's had a wild bunch.

304
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,000
They are the Pandora friends. Yes. The Pandora friends.

305
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Yeah. I don't want to know the names of these babies. I just want them to escape and be well.

306
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:29,000
No, those babies work for me. I'm on the other side. I want them to keep going, keep dancing.

307
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,000
If you're getting married at 21, you know where the Pandora vows are.

308
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Oh my gosh. There's a new Pandora friend. Since we came to the underworld?

309
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Get your credit card ready, 21 year old husband. Correct.

310
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think I brought up Bruno the Unicorn punk band Dangle Charm.

311
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
What? I don't remember that. Are they all this level of fun?

312
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Well, Bella Bot has a cute robot with a little bow in her hair or her metal head.

313
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,000
And then Pippo the flying pig. We heard that was, we talked about Pippo before.

314
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:13,000
The kids in the hall are suing currently. And the Peppa Pig people are right on the line.

315
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Oh yeah, yeah. They're both, they're working together.

316
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:22,000
But Bruno the Unicorn punk band, he has like a star over his eye like Kiss, but Kiss weren't a punk band.

317
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Bruno the Unicorn punk band? So it's a single Bruno, but he's got a Unicorn punk band?

318
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Well, we don't need to dissect this. Theodore Bear punk band as well. He's in the band as well.

319
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I think he plays the drums and there's Dino the dinosaur punk band. He plays the key tar in a punk band?

320
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I think they don't understand. This is like a Jim and the holograms definition of punk.

321
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Yeah. So there are three characters. They, perhaps I just missed them.

322
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,000
There were so many specific characters on the Pandora episode. It's good though.

323
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I'm glad we saw this because it's very important.

324
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I'm glad we get wifi here in the underworld.

325
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Yo, it's actually better here.

326
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
That's another good thing about the underworld. We're coming around to it.

327
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:11,000
While we're talking characters, I grabbed a bunch of pictures of Cha-Cha, the mascot walk around of Cha-Cha.

328
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Oh yeah, it's terrifying.

329
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
And he's different in every one.

330
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Oh my God.

331
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
There is no same snowflakes.

332
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:28,000
There's one Cha-Cha in that roundup of photos you have that's like the full body Cha-Cha, but the outfit looks like Cha-Cha's at home lounging.

333
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
He looks in his loungewear.

334
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
But then he's pictured with a young child.

335
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Holding a different Cha-Cha.

336
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
It just feels very unwholesome.

337
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Holding one of his babies.

338
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Does he look like, one of those look like Gex? Remember the video game character Gex?

339
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Oh I do. What platform was he from?

340
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
PS, the PlayStation?

341
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:50,000
I always remember being in a Fry's Electronics and discovering Gex and going, I guess I'm going to fall in love with Gex.

342
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
I didn't know Gex.

343
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Like I did Sonic.

344
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Gex is like, look how cool Gex is.

345
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Gex is cool.

346
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
What was his platform? Where was Gex from?

347
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
PlayStation and then I think maybe you could get it on a computer as well.

348
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
There was a sequel where he had like a tuxedo jacket on.

349
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Oh you could get him on all. It was on Game Boy and 6, 10, 64.

350
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Enter the Gecko.

351
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
I was more of a Sega Genesis kind of gal.

352
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Well I think Gex was a little bit after the Genesis.

353
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Maybe, yeah.

354
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
But perhaps he was on Sega Dreamcast.

355
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Cha-Cha looks like he's having fun.

356
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Yeah, there's something that's very appealing about Cha-Cha.

357
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:32,000
And I want to say, I remember my manager at the time being so excited to rattle off statistics of like, we sell the most Cha-Cha dolls.

358
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Out of the Tri-State area for rainforest cafes or something.

359
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
I was like, that's cool dude.

360
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
The 90s were a great time to be a tree frog.

361
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
It really was.

362
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Yeah.

363
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Yeah. I felt like every fifth t-shirt you'd see on a kid had a tree frog on it.

364
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
For sure.

365
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Well there was the whole environmental t-shirt racket that we got sold in elementary school.

366
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
So I certainly had.

367
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I felt like that helped something if you bought a t-shirt.

368
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Yeah, you bought a shirt.

369
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Do we all have that?

370
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Yeah, well that was sort of the same principles that Rainforest Cafe was started on.

371
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,000
And then like capitalism and corporate greed took over.

372
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:14,000
What's up with this original founder? Was it sort of a, was it kind of cooler and more well-intentioned?

373
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:27,000
I think a little bit, but it also, it's very interesting to sort of research these things sort of similar to Rockafire Explosion and those kind of like, you know, one kooky guy is starting something, stories.

374
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Wants to be a waltz essentially.

375
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Yeah, yeah. He actually, and I don't know fully what his background was before this.

376
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
I imagine he worked in businesses in some degree.

377
00:26:38,000 --> 00:27:00,000
But he had the idea for the Rainforest Cafe in the early 90s and decided that as like a prototype for what he wanted to sell investors on, he figured that a simple pitch with just, you know, printed images and the way you normally pitch a business could not do to fully sell the experience of the Rainforest Cafe.

378
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:10,000
So he decided whether it was his own house or he bought a new house, he completely converted a house to look like what would eventually be the Rainforest Cafe.

379
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Cool.

380
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I have, yes, I have some statistics where he used 3,700 extension cords to power 20 different sound systems, lights and fog. He had 40 tropical birds, two 150 pound tortoises, a baboon, an iguana, and a bevy of tropical fish.

381
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,000
He wrote a book called It's a Jungle in There about the way he started Rainforest Cafe.

382
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:42,000
And it took 20 different hook and ladders to put out that electrical fire.

383
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Exactly. Yeah. He, so he, oh, he also had a greenhouse lab installed on the roof of his house with like a full bar and tables.

384
00:27:51,000 --> 00:28:02,000
This is actually one of my favorite details. He also had real butterflies bred, quote, to determine how long they would survive and whether they would fall in the food.

385
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
So that's the kind of research my man did.

386
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Oh, God. I wonder what he determined.

387
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:21,000
This article also said, in this article, I got this information from atlasobscura.com, that his neighbor's guest, he was running either quote, a temple for devil worship or a bordello.

388
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:33,000
And the local power company thought he was growing weed because he had, I think this was in Minneapolis maybe, somewhere, he or Minnesota.

389
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,000
The first location was Mall of America. Yeah, yeah. It was like sort of in that region.

390
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:47,000
But he like won a record for like highest single owner gas bill or power bill at like something crazy, like $12,000.

391
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:53,000
So they were like, my man's growing weed for sure. This is also the go-go 90s.

392
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:58,000
And this is a hoarding of this guy would get evicted from the state at this point.

393
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,000
So he invited investors over and they were like, this guy's weird.

394
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Immediately. Yeah, we got to give this guy a few million to sell chicken fingers.

395
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Well, it's funny you say that, Jason, because eventually he convinced some guy, oh, his name was Lyle Berman, who eventually invested $1.2 million and then became immediately Rainforest Café's first chairman and CEO.

396
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:31,000
And they opened in 1994 at the Mall of America. But yeah, he described his process, the original guy.

397
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:38,000
I think his name is Steve Schussler. But he said that it was a very field of dream situation for him.

398
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:46,000
That was his business strategy. If you build it, they will come. And if you wreck a house, maybe some crazy billionaire will bail you out.

399
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,000
And is it going to pay for the removal of butterfly corpses?

400
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Oh my God, that is such a wild detail. But yeah, that's the guy who started the Rainforest Café.

401
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Wow. This is insane. And it's also insane. This is in the same, you know, this guy's tinkering in his private, heavily themed laboratory.

402
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Just as miles up the road, a young man named Prince built a compound where they could store any idea he had and where he could just have a few ideas left and right and nobody would judge him.

403
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Every room wired for sound. Yeah. He would record in the bathroom.

404
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,000
He would start singing a song in the bathroom. Every room with stuff Cha Cha.

405
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,000
I love Cha Cha. Do you think that Prince went to the Rainforest Café when it opened?

406
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:38,000
I hope he did. I hope he did. It must have been a like... Celebrate a birthday on any day because he doesn't track time or he didn't.

407
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Is there a Prince bootleg where he's like, I'm going to bring up my friend now. His name's Cha Cha. Cha Cha comes out and dances.

408
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Well Cha Cha was his protege for a long time. Yeah, of course. He put out a three disc CD album. You can only get it at Target.

409
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
He named Cha Cha. Yeah, he named Cha Cha.

410
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:01,000
And of course they made love. Tried to get him to star in the last Dragon sequel. Didn't work out.

411
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:07,000
But Prince Slee demanded, like called the Rainforest Café at 530 a.m. and said, like, are you open?

412
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:13,000
I got 70 people coming. Is that your Prince voice? Yes. It's just this.

413
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:18,000
I like it. You open? He's got like kind of that cheekiness. There's a couple different versions of Prince too.

414
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,000
There's the one where he's kind of like feeling a little cute. Yeah. I think that's the one you're talking about.

415
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Kind of cheeky. But then there's one where he's like, I feel like he's in a bad mood and he's like, no. Yes. Are you open?

416
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Like there's just nothing. He's not putting anything on it. And then there's an occasion where he's like animated, which is shocking to see.

417
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:42,000
But it's really fun to see that he's like a human being. Yeah. Because he was a human being. Yeah. Yeah.

418
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:50,000
It's really such a mystery. I just watched this incredible. I've been posting on Instagram these like stars reenactment shows that are so bad.

419
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Oh, yeah. There is one where the Prince looked incredible, like so the best and most Prince looking Prince of Berserker you could ever imagine.

420
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Then he speaks. He's playing pool with his dad. And then like, why do they give these people lines?

421
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Just don't do it. Because when he talks, it's like, well, I guess I lost that game. No.

422
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:14,000
What acts like 20 accents? What is this? Reenactment? Yeah. Should be.

423
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:22,000
He did a song to on my heart.

424
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:29,000
I'm sorry. Maybe I'm just like my father. And it's like B 52. Maybe I'm just like my father.

425
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:37,000
He's never satisfied. I feel like anytime we're tired, like Prince Prince honestly doesn't come up as much as he should, because I assume you and I are.

426
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Twenty four hours removed from a new piece of information or a new thing we've watched on YouTube, because I don't know for I'm 24 hours removed from seeing Morris Day talk about the last time he talked to Prince.

427
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Well, Prince told him he loved him and Morris. He got to say that. Yeah.

428
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:59,000
He said that Prince all of a sudden was like, I'm going to we're going to do a full tour of Europe and I'm going to like get behind you guys again or something.

429
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:04,000
And he's like, wow. And then he's like, hey, I love you, man. And more stay was like something is different.

430
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Did you read that New Yorker piece about him from the guy who was going to write his biography book that's out? Yeah.

431
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And like how that's like the last days were like the most heartbreaking because he could just sense because he wasn't not like Prince knew.

432
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:25,000
But like there was just a lot of things that were on the horizon. And he was like making all these promises. Yeah.

433
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:31,000
But of course, Prince weighed in on theme parks in the song Lady Cab Driver, where he's critical of the tourists at Disneyland.

434
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:39,000
He seems to be like, I don't think he liked it. Yeah. So in the context of this podcast, we have to say fuck Prince.

435
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Unfortunately, I'll say it. I'll say it. Fuck Prince. You have to. And as soon as this is done, I love Prince.

436
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,000
But for the dare you make that comment about the tourists at Disneyland.

437
00:33:48,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Yeah. That reminds me the one of the first times that I'm sure you guys have experienced this of like the first time there was a very clear record scratch of like, oh, other people don't enjoy theme parks like I do.

438
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:08,000
I was actually going to school at Chapman and had roommates that didn't go to school there, but like went to Cal State Fullerton, whatever.

439
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Feel like we found each other in Craigslist. And I remember talking to one of my roommates and just talking about like how much fun Disneyland is and like how I maybe have even gone to like get the job in Rainforest Cafe.

440
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:32,000
And my roommate saying that she hated Disneyland, that it wasn't fun. And her reasoning was that it's always busy. And what fun is that?

441
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:39,000
And my mind was completely blown. I was like, well, then you don't go when it's busy. Yeah.

442
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Most people do zero research on anything and they just expect to like, yeah, show up and it'll work. It'll be great. And it's like, hey, man, maybe look at like what just Google the phrase.

443
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:58,000
What time of day should I go to Disney? What time of year should I go to Disneyland?

444
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:05,000
I mean, and I'm not asking to go to isitpacked.com. Yes. But bookmark that in your browser.

445
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:15,000
It's such an easy Google. You can plan your day, your week, your year around it. Yeah. Just to write off a place for it being busy on a July day is absurd.

446
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:26,000
But even like a restaurant, like people get frustrated they can't just walk in. And it's like, well, do you make a reservation? Do you see if it's a walk in kind of place?

447
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Like, yeah. Yeah. So they should learn to love research and then they'll learn to love. And then I was like, don't talk to me until you've done it.

448
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:46,000
She's like, please leave. I was like, not a problem. She's not to go to the dining hall. You know, you go at noon.

449
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:56,000
You're right, Jason. You're right. You go at four p.m. Yeah. Can I connect back to Rainforest Cafe based on that tangent? I read that.

450
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:05,000
So the Rainforest Cafe opened in the Mall of America within a week. It was a three hour wait to be seated at any time of day. Yeah. What they said.

451
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I mean, I don't I don't want to sound like your roommate, but that sounds pretty shitty to me.

452
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Well, I mean, I would say that this situation is different because Rainforest Cafe is always shitty. Yes. Yeah.

453
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:24,000
You were to the store. Yeah. We haven't talked about the food and we probably not much to say about the food, but it's not good. It's really, really bad.

454
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:31,000
My family would eat there when we were at downtown, formerly downtown Disney in Orlando.

455
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:38,000
And I think we all looked forward to it and we all had a nice time. I cannot remember. I remember multicolored drinks. That's it.

456
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:45,000
I don't remember anyone going. This food is very good. How often do you how many times did you eat there?

457
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Between this and I think there was one briefly in somewhere in Pennsylvania. There's still one on the Atlantic City Boardwalk.

458
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:56,000
I think I've eaten at Rainforest Cafe like four times, four or five times.

459
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:06,000
I really briefly want to say that, like when I worked there, so in like the backstage area, we had like a break area that the servers and the people that worked in the retail would all hang out in.

460
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:18,000
And that's sort of where it felt the most like this high school divide because they would all hang out and be like gregarious on one side and all of the retail trolls like myself would just be like, you know, crouched over their little foods, food plates.

461
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:25,000
But they would give us free food, but it would always be for our shift. It would always be like very basic rubbery pasta.

462
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:30,000
But then if we wanted to buy something, it would be like a dollar for this or something.

463
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:44,000
But even still with that, like I just had I had to go walk through the kitchen every day to get to my shift and just seeing that kitchen was and the smell of the kitchen was really wretched.

464
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:58,000
And I also so in my research of coming over here today, I just looked, I googled Rainforest Cafe food and found a litany of Reddit threads of people talking about food poisoning and like all these terrible things.

465
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:07,000
But the best thing that I found, and this did not happen when I was there, but I'm delighted that it happened after somebody had a birthday dessert.

466
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Usually, I want to say that they would do that volcano brownie thing, which was fun at first and annoying after because you had to yell volcano every time I came through.

467
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:31,000
But somebody had a birthday dessert and what they brought out was a ice cream sandwich that you could buy at the store and or an ice cream truck with a single candle.

468
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:36,000
And I know that this is real because the Rainforest Cafe table is in the background.

469
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,000
I can send this to y'all and you can post it on your Twitter.

470
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,000
But it is the saddest thing I've ever seen in my life.

471
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:48,000
We have to show the listener the angle of the candle because it's not put in the cookie part.

472
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
It's like sticking diagonally out of the side.

473
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
That's crazy.

474
00:38:53,000 --> 00:39:06,000
I want to say that like they did this before because usually you'd be able to tell if they tried to stick the candle in the middle and you'd see a little bit of that resistance from the cookie.

475
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
But there's no resistance.

476
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,000
They have done this before and we're like, no, you got to go straight to the ice cream.

477
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,000
And it's this really limp, flaccid, terrible image.

478
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
The dullest ice cream sandwich you've ever seen.

479
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Ice cream candle at half mast to represent that you are almost dead as you celebrate your birthday.

480
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Oh, that is the saddest birthday you could imagine.

481
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Oh my God.

482
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
The food is the worst.

483
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:38,000
It might be up there in terms of Big Chain restaurant, one of the worst.

484
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,000
How many times have you eaten there?

485
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Well, now I'm wondering, have I ever actually?

486
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Oh, well, as far as what you mean, I know I've eaten there.

487
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
I did the once when I was too high.

488
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
So that spoiled that.

489
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Twice. I've eaten twice.

490
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Once in like 94 or 95 in Woodfield.

491
00:39:54,000 --> 00:40:00,000
And then when I got the hamburger to go to validate my parking after I saw Dick Van Dyke in the Disneyland parade.

492
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,000
And you're stuffing that on the way home.

493
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
And I ate it in the car.

494
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:09,000
And I do remember the food being bad in 95 when I have no palette whatsoever.

495
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Everything was good to us in 95.

496
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Yeah.

497
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
My children.

498
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Yeah.

499
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
And I remember some sort of long wait.

500
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
It felt like an event.

501
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Yeah.

502
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:21,000
And then I do just have a vague memory of like, this doesn't taste very good.

503
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Yeah.

504
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:28,000
I'd actually never been there before I worked there and didn't have any loyalties to it.

505
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,000
I just really wanted to work for the Disney Resort and would take anything.

506
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:39,000
But I want to say that there was a restaurant called the Amazon that was in I want to say Sherman Oaks.

507
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Do you guys know?

508
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
I never got to do this.

509
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
I remember that was bad.

510
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Oh, you didn't like it.

511
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
I liked it.

512
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:51,000
I just I think I had like dessert there once.

513
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Like we went there after eating dinner somewhere else and we're like, oh, this place looks cool.

514
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Yeah.

515
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:01,000
And I got like a still like undefrosted piece of like cheesecake or chocolate cake.

516
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Well, sometimes it was cool.

517
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
It was a mom and pop operation.

518
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
They had bad days.

519
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:12,000
But that basically was our like if that wasn't there, maybe we would have gone to the Rainforest Cafe.

520
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,000
But like as a kid, that was like our celebration place for a while.

521
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:22,000
I remember after my fifth grade graduation, like my mom treating me and my friends to a meal at the Amazon.

522
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
And we all got like our own personal pizzas, which were a big deal.

523
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,000
I think it had gone downhill by 2010.

524
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
I bet. I bet.

525
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
But it was a similar concept to the Rainforest Cafe.

526
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:39,000
It was like whoever whatever mom and pop, whatever person was just blatantly ripping off the concept of the Rainforest Cafe.

527
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:46,000
But they did have so it was all decorated with like fake plants on the inside, really immersive theming.

528
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
And I want to say like one animal robot.

529
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,000
There was a robot.

530
00:41:52,000 --> 00:42:03,000
There was also I remember as I talked about before, like noticeable for after I turned 21, the first place my dad and I had a beer was on the patio second floor of the Rainforest Cafe.

531
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,000
And it was the first time he had ever, ever been to Disneyland.

532
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
And it was where we could get it.

533
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Like it was a Friday night.

534
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Everywhere was packed.

535
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Yeah. And that was the only place we could get in.

536
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,000
And it was in October.

537
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:22,000
And the nights are cold in October sometimes in Los Angeles.

538
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:33,000
So like we were like cuddling by a heat lamp because it like dropped by the time we sat down to like by the time we had ended, it was fully cold nighttime.

539
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Great times. Great times.

540
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
It's a great place.

541
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:47,000
The it maintains. Do you realize that this is I mean not the newer not the ones in China, but the the original four Disney properties, it's at all of them.

542
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
There are two of them.

543
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Now it's gone. But Disneyland.

544
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
It opened in Disney World first.

545
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Two in Florida.

546
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:59,000
The one where we covered before the Paris place and Tokyo, the Xpery, the mall.

547
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Oh yeah.

548
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:06,000
It is it is it is such a there's such a Disney partnership with this terrible, terrible.

549
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,000
I guess they and I understand you go to it for theming.

550
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
But why does the food have to be so?

551
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Yeah.

552
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
How have they gotten away with it?

553
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
I don't know.

554
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Why can't it be as good as Chili's?

555
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Right.

556
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000
It would take very little for it to be halfway decent.

557
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
And it's it's so like egregiously bad.

558
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:26,000
And I don't know what it was like before the before Landry's took over.

559
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:31,000
It kind of feels like the same argument of like McDonald's fries used to be great before that lawsuit happened.

560
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Yeah.

561
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
I almost can't let you pass on that phrase.

562
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Why can't it be like Chili's?

563
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
I guess you're right, because Chili's is fine.

564
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
I love Chili's.

565
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
So it's also very consistent.

566
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
I don't find that to be true.

567
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
I've had terrible Chili's.

568
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:53,000
I don't know what it is about Chili's, but I it's my favorite of all those tiered level Olive Garden, whatever Applebee's.

569
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
I don't know.

570
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Chili's always delivers.

571
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
I always thought Fridays was.

572
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Red Robin was always the one that was the solid one for our family.

573
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Or is it Islands one of these?

574
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
I guess you could throw Islands in there.

575
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
I forget what I said Islands is one of these.

576
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
And to this day, Islands is like my way to go.

577
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
You get a little theming.

578
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
You get a little bit of theming in there.

579
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,000
And that free punch that like makes your teeth feel brittle.

580
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Oh, yeah.

581
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Well, as you said, if there has been like a well, it seems like it was always bad and always bad in Schomburg.

582
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:34,000
But if there has been a turn, at least away from the original philosophy, maybe some of it has to do with the Landry's Corporation and the inevitable to be mentioned Tillman Fertitta.

583
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
As I said, I watched interviews of this guy.

584
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
He's very Toby Husk.

585
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:43,000
He's like, like, yeah, I thought I would watch video of the what?

586
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
He's the CEO of.

587
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
He's that.

588
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Yes, he's in charge of Landry's.

589
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,000
He owns the Houston Rockets.

590
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,000
He also owns five gold nugget, gold nugget casinos.

591
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Yeah.

592
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Landry's also where we had the kerfuffle at the City Walk Saga.

593
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Bubba gum shrimp.

594
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Oh, yeah.

595
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
They're bubble gum points.

596
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Your points issue.

597
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
What else is it?

598
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,000
It's claim jumper McCormick and Schmicks.

599
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Oh, yes, that's right.

600
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Joe's Crab Shack.

601
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,000
A number of aquariums in Texas.

602
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,000
The Kemal Boardwalk in Kemal, Texas.

603
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Hmm.

604
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Hmm.

605
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Chart House.

606
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Chart House is them, which is pretty good.

607
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Pretty nice.

608
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Some of these are great.

609
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Yeah.

610
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,000
But why do we why do we know or care about Tillman Fertitta?

611
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Well, probably because when we were in Schaumburg, there were many, many copies of his angry

612
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:39,000
looking book in the retail store, their equivalent of where you were, Julia.

613
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,000
And if you go, I think you have this too, Jason.

614
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
I think we have the same screen grab.

615
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
I can't wait.

616
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:50,000
To rainforestcafe.com, at least as we record this, maybe not by the time the listener hears

617
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,000
it, but you are you immediately get a pop up ad of this book.

618
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Shut up and listen.

619
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Oh, no.

620
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,000
CEO and Houston Rockets owner Tillman Fertitta.

621
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
God, these fucking guys love to write books.

622
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
They love these kinds of fucking love it.

623
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Goldie books.

624
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Yeah.

625
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
I didn't just get this out of nowhere.

626
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
I worked for it.

627
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Which is not I mean, it's not somebody who doesn't have a chip on their shoulder does,

628
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:19,000
you know, like they obviously are trying to construct the narrative, you know, by their

629
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
terms.

630
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:26,000
So you also get this pop up at the website for Chart House for Bubba Gump Shrimp.

631
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Oh, my God.

632
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
For T-Rex Cafe.

633
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Oh, that we forgot that one.

634
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
For Joe's Crab Shack.

635
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Amazing.

636
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Not for Golden Nugget.

637
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,000
I'm assuming because there's so many regulations around gaming.

638
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:43,000
So this guy just shoving his book in people's faces.

639
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:49,000
I will say to this man's credit, I thought I'd watch it because this cover is so angry.

640
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:55,000
He just seems like he seems like he's presenting himself in sort of a Gordon Ramsay kind of

641
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,000
like the Hell's owner.

642
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:03,000
He's got like a Steve Jobs kind of half lit portrait.

643
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Right.

644
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Yeah.

645
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
They're all trying to be Steve Jobs in some way.

646
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
They love it.

647
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
They have such a boner for him.

648
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:13,000
He also wants to be like the prophet or one of these guys because he has there.

649
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:18,000
I didn't even realize there was three seasons of a show on CNBC hosted by this man.

650
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Yeah.

651
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Million dollar buyer.

652
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Yeah, I didn't know about this either.

653
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Yeah.

654
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
I never caught if we weren't.

655
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:28,000
I mean, it shows you how putting the books in the store do a lot because now Tillman Fertitta

656
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
could not be more on our minds.

657
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
So it does work and the pop up ads work.

658
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:39,000
But if you're there, if you're going to check out what's how is Joe's crab check price in

659
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:43,000
the crab right now, why do you want to hear about a billionaire's book?

660
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Yeah, right.

661
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,000
But of course it's because he wants to be as famous as all the people we just mentioned

662
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:51,000
because he's like the Rainforest Cafe isn't the star.

663
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
I'm the star.

664
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Tillman is the star.

665
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Yeah.

666
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
But it hasn't happened for him yet.

667
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,000
I mean, he's probably watching like Jon Taffer and going like, that's me.

668
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,000
That's what I do every time I walk into any business.

669
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
I could be him.

670
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Yeah.

671
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Tillman Fertitta.

672
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Do you guys know about the CNBC show West Texas Investors Club?

673
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
No, I don't.

674
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Don't like me.

675
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,000
That is co-hosted by Matthew McConaughey's brother.

676
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Oh.

677
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Rooster?

678
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Huh?

679
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Rooster McConaughey?

680
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
I think it's Rooster.

681
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Is that a true name?

682
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
I believe his real name is Rooster.

683
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
I think that's right.

684
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
Great.

685
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Yes, this is a show I used to watch of my old job and it's like good old boys.

686
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Did you have to watch it?

687
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
I did have to QC it.

688
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,000
I would QC it and we had it in multiple aspect ratios.

689
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
It's Rooster.

690
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
It's a Rooster McConaughey.

691
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
It's Rooster.

692
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:44,000
It's him and another guy who are very wealthy investing in like country business, you know,

693
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:49,500
real America businesses, which I feel like Tillman Fertitta would be in favor of.

694
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:51,500
He has a lot of thoughts about business.

695
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:54,000
Was anyone, did you look at the book?

696
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
No, I thought about it and I didn't.

697
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,000
I really probably should have like on the way from Orlando just bought the book, read

698
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,000
the book on the plane, but I didn't do it.

699
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Okay.

700
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
That long five hour ride.

701
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,000
I could have gotten a lot of shut up and listen in.

702
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:13,000
There's an app called Libby and that's like you borrow ebooks from the library.

703
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,000
I have cards at LA library and Burbank library.

704
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:20,000
So I'm like, well, surely I can get this book.

705
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,500
I could place a hold.

706
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:28,000
I could not borrow an ebook because there is currently a six week wait, six week wait

707
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
for this book.

708
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,000
But with Libby, you can read an excerpt.

709
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,000
So I read the introduction.

710
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Oh my God.

711
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Okay.

712
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
All right.

713
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:48,720
This is so this is from he explains everything that he owns and then he sets up in this book.

714
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:51,400
I want to share some of the key ideas and strategies.

715
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:55,800
I used to build an entertainment and hospitality empire that covers the globe.

716
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:58,300
To do that, I'd like to begin with a warning.

717
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:00,280
Be just like me.

718
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:02,760
Never ever stop worrying about your business.

719
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:03,760
Why?

720
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:08,040
Because when it comes to business and most everything else in life, there is a paddle

721
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:10,800
for everybody's ass.

722
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:13,160
Whoa.

723
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:17,800
And you never know when it's coming or where it's coming from.

724
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:19,400
I really do believe that.

725
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:24,800
I don't care if things are going well for you that you think you know it all.

726
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:26,720
Put this one thing in your head.

727
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:30,400
There is a paddle coming for your ass right now.

728
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:31,400
Wow.

729
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:37,960
I can hear those words at a Harvard Business School commencement speech, but I could also

730
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:40,400
hear it in a YMCA locker room.

731
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:41,400
Yeah.

732
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:43,200
Two same experiences.

733
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:47,180
So and he talks about the book is divided into five sections and stuff.

734
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:49,880
So that's the beginning of this like setup chapter.

735
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:50,880
Oh my God.

736
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:57,440
And then the very end of it, despite all my success, I walk around every day making sure

737
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:00,440
that the paddle doesn't get my ass.

738
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:01,440
Wow.

739
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:07,000
I can take a few taps, but I don't want a big squat.

740
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,600
No, I can take a few taps.

741
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:12,160
Neither do you.

742
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:17,880
So saying this in the nicest way possible, shut up and listen.

743
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:18,880
Let's get started.

744
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:19,880
Wow.

745
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:22,080
A big squat.

746
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:24,320
Who plays him in the movie about his life?

747
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:26,280
Oh, it's Toby Hus.

748
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:27,280
Toby Hus.

749
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:28,280
Toby Hus.

750
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:30,080
He's like, if you watch him, he's kind of like a folksy guy.

751
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:32,640
He seems nice, but he seems like he might fuck you over too.

752
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:33,640
Yeah.

753
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:34,640
Big squat.

754
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:36,280
Jason, do you remember when we- I can take a couple swats.

755
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:37,400
I can take a swat or two.

756
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:39,800
I can take like 19 swats a day.

757
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:41,560
Oh, you want to hit me in the swat spot?

758
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:42,560
Or 20?

759
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:45,720
Yeah, then my swat spot's getting soft.

760
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:49,320
We were in a- for a Vegas bachelor party, Jason and I were together and he was high

761
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:53,800
and he was worried that that German beer wench was going to give his bottom a big squat with

762
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:54,800
a paddle.

763
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:56,040
A literal paddle.

764
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:59,600
In that moment, it would have been fair to say there's a paddle coming for your ass.

765
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:00,600
Yeah.

766
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:01,600
Coming for my ass.

767
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:02,760
So he ran out of there.

768
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:07,520
And then probably the whole book is like, well, you know, giving a presentation to a

769
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:12,600
board of directors is like, well, they're like a bunch of paddles and you're like an

770
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:13,600
ass.

771
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:14,600
He only has one metaphor.

772
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:20,400
So when you're running a restaurant, the kitchen staff is like an ass.

773
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:23,880
I think this guy knows that.

774
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:26,960
And they're coming for you, the ass, if they're not happy.

775
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:31,080
There was a chapter called like, give the people what they want, parentheses.

776
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:35,920
It was something like, if they're watering eggs, give them eggs.

777
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:41,840
And on the Rainforest Cafe menu, there is a build your own omelet on the item.

778
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:42,840
Like on the dinner menu.

779
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:43,840
So you think there's a connection to that?

780
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:49,120
So I think there's connection because I think a paddle came for his ass when someone wanted

781
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:50,880
eggs and they weren't prepared.

782
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:55,440
I guess that's a weird menu item for a rainforest themed eatery.

783
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:57,400
I'll give him this.

784
00:52:57,400 --> 00:53:01,120
I heard the breakfast was okay at the MGM Grand one that is now closed.

785
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:04,200
So they might have done breakfast okay.

786
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:05,360
And that's the best comment.

787
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:11,760
It's pretty hard to like how like in an airport, like Romano's Macaroni Grill has to serve

788
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:12,760
breakfast.

789
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:17,760
Yeah, it's a different menu.

790
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:20,640
Could you go with you want a couple of paddled eggs?

791
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:25,680
It gets served on a paddle and people are asking questions like, well, I'm glad you

792
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:27,440
asked that comes from this book.

793
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:28,720
And they like upsell you.

794
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:29,720
Oh yeah.

795
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:30,720
Yeah.

796
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:31,720
Why paddles you ask?

797
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:34,160
Well, and then all your silverware is little paddle.

798
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:36,520
I wouldn't put it past them.

799
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:41,240
Part of my job there that I didn't mention is that, yeah, I was a Pathfinder retail sales

800
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:47,600
associate, but I also was tasked with interrupting people's celebratory meals by asking them

801
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:49,960
if I wanted a photo to commemorate the experience.

802
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:50,960
Oh yeah.

803
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:51,960
I had to do that.

804
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:55,920
You were to borrow Mary Holland's phrase, though it's not medieval times, your photo

805
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:56,920
wench.

806
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:57,920
I was a photo wench.

807
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:59,480
A rainforest photo wench.

808
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:01,440
I was so embarrassed to work there.

809
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:06,720
And so I mean, like interrupting someone's conversation is my worst fear.

810
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:08,440
Like, I hate it.

811
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:12,080
Even if it's like good friends, I'm like, I'll just wait until they look off into the

812
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:14,800
distance and then I'll swoop in.

813
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:17,300
But I had to do that over and over and over.

814
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:20,160
And there were a couple of occasions where like people that went to my college who I

815
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:23,160
didn't really know that well, but I know that like we knew each other.

816
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:26,240
I'd be like, hi, how are you?

817
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:29,360
I'm working here and interrupting them.

818
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:34,040
And no one ever asked for a printout of the photo because it cost so much, like very similar

819
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:37,980
to medieval times, or it's like 20 bucks for like one photo.

820
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:43,880
But the one time that somebody did want to like do the upsell and buy the photo, I was

821
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:44,920
like jubilant.

822
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:49,720
I was so excited to go back to my shitty manager and be like, look what I did.

823
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:51,920
I'm the best employee here.

824
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:57,680
But then, of course, the memory card got totally fucked up and ended up not happening.

825
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:04,560
And I had to apologize profusely operating a PC computer that was like years out of date

826
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:06,120
and be like, I hope it's here.

827
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:07,120
I swear it's here.

828
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:11,960
I took the photo and it's like this woman with her young daughter and I'm just like

829
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:12,960
breaking their hearts.

830
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:13,960
Oh, gosh.

831
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:14,960
Yeah, it was the worst.

832
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:16,720
You were asked for it and you couldn't do it.

833
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:17,720
Yeah, yeah.

834
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:20,640
That was part of the reason why I didn't look back when I walked away.

835
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:22,040
That's a Twilight Zone episode.

836
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:23,040
It was.

837
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:26,240
You must have felt there was a big old paddle coming your way.

838
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:27,240
Yeah, I know.

839
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:32,040
I want to say one more thing before we go into the story of the Rainforest Cafe of

840
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:37,180
the one highlight and something that my sister still brings up and we'll laugh about.

841
00:55:37,180 --> 00:55:42,880
One time I was working in the gift shop and there was a kid, I'll say about eight, this

842
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:48,480
little boy who was just running fucking ragged in the whole gift shop and knocking over everything

843
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:50,800
like problem child status.

844
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:53,520
And at first I was like, oh no.

845
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:59,240
But then the dad was like quickly darting behind him and he just kept shouting, hey,

846
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:01,680
hey, what would your sensei say?

847
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:05,520
Hey, what would your sensei say?

848
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:07,920
It's like the funniest.

849
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:13,520
I went from like, oh, fuck this kid to thank God I was here.

850
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:14,520
That was amazing.

851
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:19,600
And then the one time I saw a celebrity, Kelsey Grammer came in to have dinner with his new

852
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:22,920
young wife and their very young child.

853
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:23,920
Whoa.

854
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:27,000
So I bet Frazier was going to see his animal buddy, Niall.

855
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,000
You really was.

856
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Hey.

857
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Oh, you did.

858
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,000
I filed Niall way earlier.

859
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:34,000
I didn't have anywhere to put it.

860
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,120
There it is.

861
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:36,120
You can go home.

862
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:37,120
That was good.

863
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:39,120
We can break for lunch now.

864
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:40,960
Take a little snooze.

865
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:45,480
In case the sector keeper is coughing somewhere, is there anything we should get out before

866
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:46,480
we move on?

867
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:49,480
Well, I mean, the menu, we didn't talk about it.

868
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:52,120
The menu seems like a drag nowadays.

869
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:55,960
I just have the menu open from the Disney Springs location.

870
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:59,320
And it's like, you know, there's anaconda pasta.

871
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:02,320
There's rasta pasta.

872
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:03,640
There's a, where was the other one?

873
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:07,240
There's a dessert tribal cheesecake.

874
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:08,680
Yeah.

875
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:11,000
Which is like just regular cheesecake.

876
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Yeah.

877
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:18,080
I also read the sparkling volcano, which I mentioned previously, which the whole restaurant,

878
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:23,480
anyone that worked there would have to erupt and go volcano and like yell it together.

879
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:30,120
I used to work at Cold Stone before this, so I was very used to singing in a work environment.

880
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:35,800
But I read, so it was three wedge shaped brownies propped up by vanilla ice cream and whipped

881
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:39,040
topping on top, drizzled with chocolate and caramel sauce.

882
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:43,760
When I worked there on top of all that, they would have sparklers that would be going off

883
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:45,440
while they were walking through the restaurant.

884
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:52,400
I read recently they changed that to being just like, cause no sparklers, it's too dangerous.

885
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:57,040
So they just put like a little flag in it, which feels not the same.

886
00:57:57,040 --> 00:58:01,680
It doesn't even feel like a cocktail flag.

887
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:02,680
Okay.

888
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:03,680
Yeah.

889
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:06,840
Wouldn't it make sense if it was a flag for, you know, a place where the rainforest existed,

890
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:09,120
but I don't think that they went that far.

891
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:10,400
Had the friends on it.

892
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:11,760
No wild bunch.

893
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:13,560
It did not have the wild bunch.

894
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:16,000
Shasha says, happy birthday.

895
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:21,360
Oh, I also wanted to say one more thing that I read about the parrot lady.

896
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:22,360
Oh, please.

897
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:26,080
Oh, her name is Debbie Goodrich.

898
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:28,820
They would do offsite school programming.

899
00:58:28,820 --> 00:58:31,000
So like field trips to schools.

900
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,480
And this is like where it gets really sneaky.

901
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:33,640
And I'm like, Hmm, I see you.

902
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:35,000
And I like it.

903
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:38,000
They would do, they would, the apparently it would go and she would take all of her

904
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,440
parrots and animals and stuff, go to schools.

905
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:46,720
And then at the end of the presentation, they would give like one free kids menu item coupons

906
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:51,720
to all the kids and get them young and get them turned to their parents and be like,

907
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:53,760
cause it's only valid if an adult buys.

908
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:54,760
Right.

909
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:55,760
Have their own entree.

910
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:59,240
Go to a school and hand out quires for this bad restaurant.

911
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:01,520
I kind of, but I kind of liked that hustle.

912
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:02,520
Yeah.

913
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:03,520
Yeah.

914
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:04,520
Well, Tillman, Tillman would approve.

915
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:05,520
Yeah.

916
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:06,520
Yeah.

917
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:07,520
You're avoiding the paddle with that.

918
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:11,320
Do you realize also that just really quick that Tillman, Tillman Fertitta kind of in

919
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:15,040
the news right now, because there was this whole, the whole NBA.

920
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:16,040
Oh yeah.

921
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:17,040
Yeah.

922
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:18,040
Yeah.

923
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:19,040
Yeah.

924
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:20,040
Yeah.

925
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:21,040
Yeah.

926
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:22,040
Yeah.

927
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:23,040
Yeah.

928
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:24,040
Yeah.

929
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:25,040
Yeah.

930
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:26,040
Yeah.

931
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:27,040
Yeah.

932
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:28,040
Yeah.

933
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:29,040
Yeah.

934
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:30,040
Yeah.

935
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:31,040
Yeah.

936
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:32,040
Yeah.

937
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:33,040
Yeah.

938
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:34,040
Yeah.

939
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:35,040
Yeah.

940
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:36,040
Yeah.

941
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:37,040
Yeah.

942
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:38,040
Yeah.

943
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:39,040
Yeah.

944
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:40,040
Yeah.

945
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:42,600
I think there's a guy who like said general manager, you're on your own, Darrell Maury,

946
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:43,920
I think his name.

947
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:44,920
Yeah.

948
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:47,760
Tillman sort of like kowtowing to China a little bit.

949
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:48,760
Yeah.

950
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:49,760
Cause so.

951
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:50,760
Well.

952
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:55,240
And he apparently was off like, he was, he stayed pretty, he's shut up about the topic

953
00:59:55,240 --> 01:00:00,200
otherwise, but people have noticed on Instagram, he's liking a lot of posts saying that that

954
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:02,320
general manager should be fired.

955
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:03,320
Whoa.

956
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:05,200
So bleak.

957
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:07,000
That little sneaky, that weird like.

958
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,760
He's not a very alpha move.

959
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:09,760
He was friends with.

960
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:10,760
Yeah.

961
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:11,760
That's kind of.

962
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:17,280
It's Cindy was said he was friends with that one democratic center or congressperson.

963
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:20,640
But then he was also saying like the Trump, the deregulation from Trump is going to be

964
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:21,960
good for the oil business.

965
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:22,960
Yeah.

966
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:23,960
Here we go.

967
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:24,960
Yeah.

968
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:25,960
I have a feeling we know how this guy voted.

969
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:26,960
Yeah.

970
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:27,960
We'll plan to vote.

971
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:32,120
Well, but I also found a different, I found an interview with him from 2016 where, you

972
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:35,560
know, well, Trump is saying this and he says, I don't think we're gonna have to worry about

973
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:36,560
a president Trump.

974
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:37,560
Oh boy.

975
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:38,560
So.

976
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:39,560
I mean, he's certainly.

977
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:40,560
Where's he?

978
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:41,560
Where's he?

979
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:43,560
We all got paddled on our ass.

980
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:44,560
Yeah.

981
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:45,560
He might.

982
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:46,560
Not him.

983
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:47,560
He's rich enough.

984
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:48,560
He benefits.

985
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:49,560
He's got a huge tax cut.

986
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:52,840
He also bought the Rockets for the most anyone's ever bought a basketball team for.

987
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:53,840
How much?

988
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:54,840
2.2 billion.

989
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:55,840
Whoa.

990
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:56,840
And he tried to buy it in 1993.

991
01:00:56,840 --> 01:00:57,840
I don't know what's going on.

992
01:00:57,840 --> 01:01:04,160
That's like, I want to say like at least 200 million more than somebody paid for the Clippers

993
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:05,880
who runs the Clippers.

994
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:11,200
And he almost bought it in 93 for like 16 times less and he got outbid.

995
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:14,520
So that's how much a basketball team appreciates.

996
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:16,680
So if you're looking to invest, try a basketball team.

997
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:17,680
Oh my God.

998
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:21,280
I just can't imagine being so rich that you're like, well, I guess I'll buy a bunch of humans

999
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:24,560
to enact my master plan.

1000
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:26,520
And other rich.

1001
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:29,520
I mean.

1002
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:35,840
Is this guy friends with Cuban or do you think it's like when you get too magnet?

1003
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:37,360
It's like, no, you got to have positive negative.

1004
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:38,640
You can't have two positives.

1005
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:40,640
They really have each other.

1006
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:41,680
It might be a little bit of that.

1007
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:46,440
I imagine it'll be like a friendly yet contentious real housewives like relationship.

1008
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:47,440
Yeah.

1009
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:53,200
Either he's admiring Cubans, the work Cubans had done, or he's like, have you seen how

1010
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:54,200
Cuban looks?

1011
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:55,200
He looks like shit.

1012
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:56,760
I'm going to like some posts on Instagram.

1013
01:01:56,760 --> 01:02:03,360
I'm going to say that it's like depending on who's in his company, he can shit talk

1014
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:06,040
or move up the totem pole.

1015
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:13,520
Mark Cuban says Tillman for Tita got a bargain buying the Houston Rockets for 2.2 billion.

1016
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:14,520
Like respect.

1017
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:15,520
Oh, so some.

1018
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:16,520
Yeah.

1019
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:17,520
Well, wow.

1020
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:19,000
Well, then I take back everything I said.

1021
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:23,640
But Mark Cuban is no longer NBA is only Texas billion, Texan billionaire celebrity.

1022
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:25,440
So they are similar.

1023
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:26,440
So they're competing.

1024
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:27,440
Hmm.

1025
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:28,440
Yeah.

1026
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:29,440
But friendly rivals may be.

1027
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:30,440
Two way tie for last.

1028
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:31,440
All right.

1029
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:38,520
Are we moving on to a quick pit stop before sure evil figures?

1030
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:45,520
You're you're EBA, you're EBA, which truly this could this have been in the grab bag

1031
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:47,120
of Fallen Brothers, probably.

1032
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:51,200
But it's kind of in the you know, it was one of the bigger ones, one of the bigger box

1033
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:54,080
ones because workforce cafe is huge.

1034
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:55,200
House of Blues is huge.

1035
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:56,200
This one's here.

1036
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:57,200
It became.

1037
01:02:57,200 --> 01:03:02,840
Uh, Tortilla Joe's and it was more of a nightclub.

1038
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:08,480
It was it was more it was more of a live entertainment destination, I believe, which is why Tortilla

1039
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:13,200
Joe's is so huge and there is there are stages in there.

1040
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:14,200
Did you work there then?

1041
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:17,040
You would have haven't have done your EBA, your EBA.

1042
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:23,360
I think I worked there after when it was Tortilla Joe's, but I do remember your EBA, your EBA

1043
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:28,600
because I was a frequent I was frequent in downtown Disney quite often.

1044
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:29,600
Oh, yeah.

1045
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:31,160
And our next place we're heading.

1046
01:03:31,160 --> 01:03:32,160
Yeah.

1047
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:34,280
I knew it was owned by Gloria Estefan.

1048
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:35,280
Is that OK?

1049
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:36,280
OK, OK.

1050
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:37,280
And that's all I knew.

1051
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:41,680
Other thing because because in Florida is another thing called bongos Cuban cafe.

1052
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:43,720
Yeah, I think the other thing.

1053
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:46,000
Well, then, you know, I conflated the two.

1054
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,960
But I do remember it being there.

1055
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:54,240
And listen, like a lot of these places, my most familiarity with them is a place to get

1056
01:03:54,240 --> 01:04:01,120
validation for parking in the previous iteration of the downtown Disney parking rules, which

1057
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:04,800
they probably change because people like myself have exploited it so much.

1058
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:07,360
They seem to change it every six months.

1059
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:08,360
Yeah.

1060
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:09,360
So there are there.

1061
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:12,240
But for a while it was five hours free with validation.

1062
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:15,280
And so I would do the same bit every time.

1063
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:17,960
And if I was like with somebody I was dating, I'd be like, hang back.

1064
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:18,960
I don't want you to see this.

1065
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:25,040
I'd like go over to whatever hostess and be like, hi, I ate here earlier, but I forgot

1066
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:26,040
to get this validated.

1067
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:28,040
And they'd be like, OK, who was your server?

1068
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:33,240
I want to say his name was Chris.

1069
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:37,840
What did he look like?

1070
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:40,760
He had dark hair, I want to say.

1071
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:44,720
And then I would just like exasperate them until they stamped it.

1072
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:50,080
And I did get a couple times from I want to say the pizza place Naples.

1073
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:53,840
They would get really like, there's not a Chris that works here.

1074
01:04:53,840 --> 01:04:55,880
And like really be testy with me.

1075
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:59,160
But Yareba was a good spot.

1076
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:02,880
That's like being the prosecutor and catching the defendant.

1077
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:03,880
Yeah.

1078
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:05,400
Be like, OK, well then fuck me.

1079
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:08,160
And I'd like leave and do it two doors down.

1080
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:10,840
But that's all my memory of Yareba.

1081
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:12,800
Yareba was that it was they were a good mark.

1082
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:16,440
Like I bet a Chris works at the rainforest cafe.

1083
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:24,800
But also, I mean, if I did eat there, let's say I did, I would not remember the name of

1084
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:25,800
my server.

1085
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:27,640
I would not remember what he looked like.

1086
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:32,240
Not to say that I don't clock humans in the world, but it's just, you know, you're eating

1087
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:33,240
a meal.

1088
01:05:33,240 --> 01:05:34,240
So many things are happening.

1089
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:35,240
Yeah.

1090
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:36,240
Yeah.

1091
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:37,240
Yeah.

1092
01:05:37,240 --> 01:05:38,240
I'd be the same way.

1093
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:39,240
If I were working on the other side, I'd go check the receipt.

1094
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:40,240
Look at the receipt then.

1095
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:42,200
That'd be the way to know the name.

1096
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:46,640
But I don't want to be one of these snooties telling you your story is wrong.

1097
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:49,640
I never want to be on the other side of that.

1098
01:05:49,640 --> 01:05:53,480
I mean, it takes them two seconds to stamp a thing and like, I'm a nice lady.

1099
01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:54,480
Sure.

1100
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:56,280
I checked my pocket.

1101
01:05:56,280 --> 01:05:58,600
Oh, I think my husband has it.

1102
01:05:58,600 --> 01:05:59,600
Yeah, I've done that.

1103
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:00,600
I would say quite fast.

1104
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:01,600
Yeah.

1105
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:06,440
Just say, I swear to God, I give so much money to the Disney company and I will again in

1106
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:07,440
the future.

1107
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:08,440
Absolutely.

1108
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:12,160
If I could show you my whole phone photo history, they'll be getting money sooner or later.

1109
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:13,160
Yeah.

1110
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:14,160
They have the air I breathe.

1111
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:15,600
They have everything from me.

1112
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:18,040
My brain is controlled by them.

1113
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:21,800
This place seems to have had some trouble according to mousepad.com.

1114
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:22,800
I was also on mousepad.com.

1115
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:24,800
I was at Laughing Place.

1116
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:27,680
It seemed very positive.

1117
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:29,400
I think they just reworded the press release.

1118
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:31,400
I was at Bumper Car Boys.

1119
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:32,400
No, no.

1120
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:33,400
Never.

1121
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:34,400
What?

1122
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:35,400
They don't even care.

1123
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:38,400
They don't care about these red fronts.

1124
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:39,400
No.

1125
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:41,200
Yeah, I don't know.

1126
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:44,640
This place I think had to file for chapter 11.

1127
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:49,080
It got chased out entirely.

1128
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:55,600
What I found was that there was some discussion of what might replace it.

1129
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:59,960
On this old message board, somebody said an unsubstantiated rumor that maybe a P.F.

1130
01:06:59,960 --> 01:07:01,680
Changs will replace it.

1131
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:06,520
The next post down was, yes, yes, yes, I want a P.F. Changs there.

1132
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:09,760
The next one after that was, okay, calming down now.

1133
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:10,760
Breathe slowly.

1134
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:15,560
Don't get your hopes up too much about a P.F. Changs being at Disneyland.

1135
01:07:15,560 --> 01:07:16,560
Oh, no.

1136
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:18,560
I mean, I wish I had that kind of zest.

1137
01:07:18,560 --> 01:07:23,080
Meanwhile, the hollow shell of a former P.F. Changs is miles away from where we are recording

1138
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:24,080
this right now.

1139
01:07:24,080 --> 01:07:25,080
Yes, it is.

1140
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:26,080
Oh, at the mall you meet.

1141
01:07:26,080 --> 01:07:27,080
Yeah, that's true.

1142
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:28,080
That hasn't been replaced yet.

1143
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:29,080
No.

1144
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:30,080
Yeah.

1145
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:31,080
Everything moves so slowly.

1146
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:32,080
We were just talking about the last night in Burbank.

1147
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:33,080
Yeah.

1148
01:07:33,080 --> 01:07:34,080
As far as building and things.

1149
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:37,640
Yeah, I mean, IKEA is still not anything near the old IKEA.

1150
01:07:37,640 --> 01:07:40,640
It was a spirit Halloween part of it.

1151
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:44,280
Now there's just a bunch of dirty Teslas parked there.

1152
01:07:44,280 --> 01:07:50,200
I think the closest Tesla dealership is much farther away.

1153
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:51,200
At the Americana?

1154
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:52,200
No, at the IKEA.

1155
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:53,200
Yeah, there's a story.

1156
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:54,200
Oh, no.

1157
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:55,200
At the abandoned IKEA.

1158
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:56,200
There's just Teslas.

1159
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:57,200
Oh, yeah.

1160
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:58,200
They haven't been moved.

1161
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:03,960
So you just get valley dirt on them.

1162
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:09,440
There's a bunch of them in the parking garage too in the Burbank mall.

1163
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:11,000
They've bought space there as well.

1164
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:15,160
And then at the top of the Burbank mall parking garage, you can plug in the Teslas.

1165
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:16,160
Yes.

1166
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:19,600
But this isn't about the Burbank shopping area.

1167
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:20,600
No.

1168
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:21,600
Not yet.

1169
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:22,600
The media center.

1170
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:24,800
We know where this is all going.

1171
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:27,560
It seemed like they were trying to do a lot.

1172
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:30,560
Restaurant and nightclub.

1173
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:31,720
And an unknown brand.

1174
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:33,220
And an unknown brand.

1175
01:08:33,220 --> 01:08:37,040
Even though, I mean, you really can't bank on the street traffic or the foot traffic

1176
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:40,800
of downtown Disney being what is going to sustain your business.

1177
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:47,240
I think people want the planet Hollywoods and the rainforest cafes and the House of

1178
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:48,600
Blues, which we'll talk about later.

1179
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:51,280
But there's not really a lot catering.

1180
01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:58,200
This seems more like it was catering to the large Hispanic population in Orange County.

1181
01:08:58,200 --> 01:09:02,320
But besides this, there really hasn't been a lot, I feel like.

1182
01:09:02,320 --> 01:09:03,320
No.

1183
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:05,520
So you're letting down the community, you're saying?

1184
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:08,200
I'm not saying letting down the community.

1185
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:11,480
It's not like these aren't the most authentic.

1186
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:12,480
No, no.

1187
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:17,440
I'm just saying like some lips, you know, some, you know.

1188
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:20,560
No, I think you're onto something with that.

1189
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:23,360
CityWalk has kind of a similar concept, or at least they did.

1190
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:24,680
And now that's out too.

1191
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:25,680
But the Comanchos.

1192
01:09:25,680 --> 01:09:28,000
Oh, but now it's an Anohito.

1193
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:31,240
But it's a different cantina.

1194
01:09:31,240 --> 01:09:32,240
Lateral move.

1195
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:33,240
I like someone in Florida.

1196
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:35,280
That was great.

1197
01:09:35,280 --> 01:09:36,280
Which one in Florida?

1198
01:09:36,280 --> 01:09:37,280
Anohito.

1199
01:09:37,280 --> 01:09:38,280
Oh, you did it in Florida?

1200
01:09:38,280 --> 01:09:39,280
I sure did.

1201
01:09:39,280 --> 01:09:40,280
Oh, wow.

1202
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:41,280
Very good.

1203
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:42,280
I did it at One Night Before Horror Nights.

1204
01:09:42,280 --> 01:09:43,280
I had chips and drinks.

1205
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:44,280
Fun.

1206
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:50,880
Well, and didn't they also have the vodka that is famously associated with Crystal Head

1207
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:51,880
Vodka?

1208
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:52,880
Yeah.

1209
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:53,880
That's blues.

1210
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:57,880
Mr. Dan Aykroyd, I think we're ready to talk.

1211
01:09:57,880 --> 01:10:00,880
Going to blues.

1212
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:07,680
So it all starts with a young Dan Aykroyd and his love of the blues as a little boy.

1213
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:13,760
You see, when Dan Aykroyd was young, he was at the crossroads and he met a man.

1214
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:15,240
Oh, no.

1215
01:10:15,240 --> 01:10:17,240
Oh, God.

1216
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:23,720
Um, Julia, you also frequented the House of Blues.

1217
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:27,600
Because on the, okay, I mean, we'll have our things to say about, you know, the blues of

1218
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:32,360
it all, but it does seem like something that was successful about this House of Blues and

1219
01:10:32,360 --> 01:10:35,720
continues to be successful about the one that opened over at the Garden Wall.

1220
01:10:35,720 --> 01:10:37,840
They moved it to a different Anaheim Mall.

1221
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:43,840
And it does seem like it is a legit venue for OC, punk and ska and related genres.

1222
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:44,840
Yes.

1223
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:52,680
We were talking a little bit off mic about my ska days that went from, I want to say,

1224
01:10:52,680 --> 01:10:57,320
like the tail end of middle school through all of high school.

1225
01:10:57,320 --> 01:11:02,440
I spent, I grew up in North Hollywood and started going to ska shows.

1226
01:11:02,440 --> 01:11:09,000
And then like when I was around 15, 16, didn't have a car yet and begged my mom to let me

1227
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:17,600
take the 460 bus from downtown LA to Disneyland almost every weekend to go to, and that's

1228
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:18,600
a two and a half hour ride.

1229
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:23,320
At one point you stop in Downey and have to pay the bus driver more money.

1230
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:27,280
So I would do that almost every weekend.

1231
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:30,880
And I was really committed and I would go to ska shows and then stay at a friend's house

1232
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:32,320
and then come back on Sunday.

1233
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:36,840
So it was interesting now that I'm thinking about it, like I should have been with my

1234
01:11:36,840 --> 01:11:41,900
dad for weekend custody during these years, but I think we had switched it from weekend

1235
01:11:41,900 --> 01:11:43,960
custody to like him seeing me.

1236
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:46,280
We don't need to talk about my parents' divorce, but anyway.

1237
01:11:46,280 --> 01:11:51,480
But then you also, you were saying that you would go, then you went to college in OC and

1238
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:53,280
just went back up to LA every weekend.

1239
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:55,600
Yes, because it was a flip flop.

1240
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:59,680
I was obsessed with ska music and that was like sort of my precursor to then being in

1241
01:11:59,680 --> 01:12:01,000
the comedy scene in LA.

1242
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:05,480
So I mean, I guess it felt very similar, but kind of different.

1243
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:10,880
And then once I went to Chapman and lived in Orange County, then by just the way life

1244
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:13,440
is my focus shifted.

1245
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:14,720
I was in film school now.

1246
01:12:14,720 --> 01:12:15,720
I was an adult.

1247
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:21,400
I wanted to be a comedy writer and started doing standup in college and so, and then

1248
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:26,600
also was interning at Comedy Central and FX during that time, so I would drive home every

1249
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:27,600
weekend.

1250
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:31,440
So it was like a complete like parallel flip flop to my high school days.

1251
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:32,920
I would just go to LA.

1252
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:36,720
And so that's why I know literally three people from my college experience.

1253
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:38,480
You never had the time.

1254
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:39,480
Never had the time.

1255
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:40,480
Yeah.

1256
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:43,200
I just like bounced out of there.

1257
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:49,120
And yeah, so I saw a lot of shows at House of Blues that were ska shows, probably a couple

1258
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:54,240
errant punk shows, but I was mostly a ska kid because that was the safe place for a

1259
01:12:54,240 --> 01:12:56,520
theater kid like myself.

1260
01:12:56,520 --> 01:13:02,600
And that's where, you know, you go to an Aquabat show and before even the first band goes on

1261
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:07,480
stage, everybody's in the venue playing Duck Duck Goose because they wanted to pass the

1262
01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:09,000
time and be goofy.

1263
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,360
And that would happen every single time.

1264
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:13,360
That's what the crowds are like.

1265
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:15,320
The crowds were like at the Aquabat shows.

1266
01:13:15,320 --> 01:13:16,320
These are good boys.

1267
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:18,920
They are very good boys.

1268
01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:22,680
And those shows, I will say, like if you still go to an Aquabat show today, it's going to

1269
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:23,680
be fucking fun.

1270
01:13:23,680 --> 01:13:27,680
It's got a little bit of a wrestling kind of, you know, angle to it because they have

1271
01:13:27,680 --> 01:13:29,680
fights on stage in between songs.

1272
01:13:29,680 --> 01:13:34,600
I mean, they're doing the guar thing a little bit, but it's like guar wholesome style.

1273
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:38,880
They would have commercial breaks in the middle of their shows, which are really fun.

1274
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:43,620
I mean, all of this like fed into my young brain and was like, oh, comedy is great.

1275
01:13:43,620 --> 01:13:45,440
And like silly is valuable.

1276
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:51,120
And the band that dresses up and has fun with the videos and like, and it's not it's a big

1277
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:53,920
silly experience, the concert, not just we play songs and leave.

1278
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:54,920
Yeah.

1279
01:13:54,920 --> 01:13:58,880
It wasn't like this sort of shrugging performative, we're too cool kind of thing.

1280
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:04,620
And I will say like, and my sister liked Ska music too, but like she was definitely more

1281
01:14:04,620 --> 01:14:08,320
in like the tool corn hot topic goth camp.

1282
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:12,980
So maybe I plunged deeper into Ska as like a way to be like, this is mine.

1283
01:14:12,980 --> 01:14:18,160
But I enjoyed going to those shows because there always was a sense of play to them.

1284
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:22,200
And especially with yeah, Aquabats shows and real big fish shows, like they would tell

1285
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:25,280
jokes in between songs and just like have a goofy time.

1286
01:14:25,280 --> 01:14:27,140
And I'm a silly bitch.

1287
01:14:27,140 --> 01:14:30,300
And so I felt like very much at home.

1288
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:37,120
And I want to say also, so I also kind of did a rock star Mark Wahlberg thing with the

1289
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:40,600
Aquabats where I actually worked on the first season of their show as a writer.

1290
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:42,800
It was my second writing credit.

1291
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:48,460
And I want to say that like before they got their show, I was they did a show at House

1292
01:14:48,460 --> 01:14:50,560
of Blues and I got to go backstage.

1293
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:53,860
But the biggest I've been there.

1294
01:14:53,860 --> 01:14:58,400
But the biggest thrill was that they have monsters that come out in costume during the

1295
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:00,760
show and I got to dress up as one and like fight them.

1296
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:02,680
And that was really, really cool.

1297
01:15:02,680 --> 01:15:03,680
Oh, that is cool.

1298
01:15:03,680 --> 01:15:04,680
Yeah.

1299
01:15:04,680 --> 01:15:08,800
I was wondering like whoever ends up in animal costumes in the flaming lip shows, that must

1300
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:10,800
be like a huge deal.

1301
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:16,720
And it happened, I thought it would be this big grand thing and it was like, oh, we need

1302
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:17,720
a mud girl.

1303
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:18,720
Can you be a mud girl?

1304
01:15:18,720 --> 01:15:19,720
And it would be like, oh me?

1305
01:15:19,720 --> 01:15:20,720
Like, OK.

1306
01:15:20,720 --> 01:15:25,160
And like I overthought it and was like really trying to make a meal out of it.

1307
01:15:25,160 --> 01:15:26,160
This is my chance.

1308
01:15:26,160 --> 01:15:27,160
Yeah, yeah.

1309
01:15:27,160 --> 01:15:29,200
I'm auditioning for, you know, like Mr. Hollywood.

1310
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:30,200
No, it was really, really fun.

1311
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:34,800
It was funny how you mythologize these things and what you realize ultimately are like.

1312
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:35,800
It's so flippant.

1313
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:40,360
Friends just making decisions quick, but they're elevated and they're gods to you when you're

1314
01:15:40,360 --> 01:15:41,360
at work.

1315
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:42,360
Yeah, exactly.

1316
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:45,800
And that's what I think a lot when people go and whatever, there are shades to us that

1317
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:46,800
are different.

1318
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:49,920
But like when people are like, oh, yeah, they just hired their fucking friend to work on

1319
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:50,920
their show.

1320
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:55,040
I'm like, well, yeah, that's just those are how a lot of those decisions are made because

1321
01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:58,960
they want to know that the dynamic is going to be something they're familiar with and

1322
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:02,560
that they can just jump in instead of it being this like really awkward getting to know you

1323
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:03,560
phase.

1324
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:04,560
And I don't know.

1325
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:05,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1326
01:16:05,560 --> 01:16:08,160
It's usually that like, yeah, not merit based.

1327
01:16:08,160 --> 01:16:12,400
And that a creative, yeah, well, not a creative like outlet is like this.

1328
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:15,200
This fun house with my friend, like I'd be in his dreams.

1329
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:17,200
Everybody wants Empire Records, I want to say.

1330
01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:18,200
Sure.

1331
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:20,280
Yeah, we're all shooting for it.

1332
01:16:20,280 --> 01:16:23,640
So in this case, you know, I think something that we come back to with a lot of these with

1333
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:27,340
City Walk with Denton Disney is that a lot of these places feel like who would actually

1334
01:16:27,340 --> 01:16:33,360
go to the who would any of these places where why would this actually be like a hub or a

1335
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:34,880
place that you are all the time?

1336
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:39,640
And I guess in this regard, that was the blues was legitimate and the new one continued to

1337
01:16:39,640 --> 01:16:44,440
be like a genuine good venue in the county.

1338
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:45,440
Yeah.

1339
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:50,920
I mean, I think what you're saying, the local stuff for sure, that's that's sustaining it.

1340
01:16:50,920 --> 01:16:54,360
Did you look back, though, with the first couple of years of concerts at this?

1341
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:56,760
I mean, I know I know who opened it.

1342
01:16:56,760 --> 01:16:58,880
I know yellow card opened it.

1343
01:16:58,880 --> 01:16:59,880
Yes.

1344
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:02,360
But like Johnny Cash played really?

1345
01:17:02,360 --> 01:17:03,360
Wow.

1346
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:07,080
Ray Charles played the House of Blues in Anaheim.

1347
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:08,080
Whoa.

1348
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:09,600
I got James Brown.

1349
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:10,600
I got James Brown.

1350
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:13,240
I got Edda James a bunch.

1351
01:17:13,240 --> 01:17:15,640
Warren Zevon played the one.

1352
01:17:15,640 --> 01:17:16,640
All of these are at the one.

1353
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:17,640
Disney.

1354
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:18,640
Yeah.

1355
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:19,640
Wow.

1356
01:17:19,640 --> 01:17:20,640
2001, two and three.

1357
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:21,640
Dennis Quaid.

1358
01:17:21,640 --> 01:17:22,640
Oh, you got D Quaid.

1359
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:23,640
D Quaid.

1360
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:24,640
It falls off.

1361
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:28,140
I knew he did music and of course he was there.

1362
01:17:28,140 --> 01:17:29,360
You can for sure see it fall.

1363
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:34,200
I mean, Paul.

1364
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:36,320
That gives me an idea.

1365
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:37,960
It falls off a little bit.

1366
01:17:37,960 --> 01:17:38,960
Rebecca Black.

1367
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:39,960
Oh, Rebecca Black.

1368
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:43,200
Of course, our friend, Daughtry.

1369
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:44,200
I'm surprised.

1370
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:45,200
I'm surprised.

1371
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:46,200
Hold on.

1372
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:47,760
I'll get to who I thought you were going to show me in one second.

1373
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:51,000
Well, we might have the same one about that.

1374
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:55,200
Well, because it falls off a little bit and then it starts to get more like yellow cardy,

1375
01:17:55,200 --> 01:17:57,480
punk, Biss O'Kell, punk and ska.

1376
01:17:57,480 --> 01:18:00,760
But then you'll still get Hall and Oates playing fairly regularly.

1377
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:02,400
They're doing a good job.

1378
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:08,080
I felt like it operated really well as a venue and was like it was the biggest venue for,

1379
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:12,560
I want to say Orange County, except for maybe is it the Palace a place or no?

1380
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:17,440
The Grove is a place that's near like the block of Orange or something.

1381
01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:20,600
That's the one in the Angel Stadium parking lot.

1382
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:21,600
Yeah.

1383
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:25,560
It's like Carly Rae Jepsen there and that's a place that used to be called Tinseltown

1384
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:26,560
Studios.

1385
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:31,880
They had an old Hollywood dinner theater that collapsed in like four months.

1386
01:18:31,880 --> 01:18:34,080
Disney got Jack Lindquist founded it.

1387
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:35,080
There's probably a whole other.

1388
01:18:35,080 --> 01:18:36,960
But now it's just a concert venue.

1389
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:40,400
But weirdly, if you walk around and you're like, it's supposed to be like a backlot.

1390
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:42,560
Why is every font art deco?

1391
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:47,360
And that's why it was this awful idea for a dinner theater.

1392
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:48,360
Very sad.

1393
01:18:48,360 --> 01:18:51,160
I never got to see whatever Tinseltown Theater was.

1394
01:18:51,160 --> 01:18:53,360
You're at a Hollywood gala.

1395
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:55,360
You're the star.

1396
01:18:55,360 --> 01:19:00,440
But I'm wearing my checkered sneakers from the Skull Show.

1397
01:19:00,440 --> 01:19:01,440
It need not matter.

1398
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:02,880
We wear the tuxedos for you.

1399
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:03,880
Oh, great.

1400
01:19:03,880 --> 01:19:08,800
Can I just say really quick, I know this is massively off topic, but the soap opera Bistro

1401
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:16,280
needs to have its day in the sun because I was a very big appreciator of it and it was

1402
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:20,760
another like place that my family would go for celebratory meals.

1403
01:19:20,760 --> 01:19:22,100
We ate it up.

1404
01:19:22,100 --> 01:19:23,100
We loved it.

1405
01:19:23,100 --> 01:19:27,240
We thought that the improv was great and we were so bummed when it left.

1406
01:19:27,240 --> 01:19:29,720
Well, so I just want to put that out there.

1407
01:19:29,720 --> 01:19:33,560
OK, my other soap opera Bistro stands there with you.

1408
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:41,240
I've got a full photo album of us posing around the sets from the soap operas inside the hospital.

1409
01:19:41,240 --> 01:19:42,240
Yeah.

1410
01:19:42,240 --> 01:19:44,320
And my sister's full hot topic goth in them.

1411
01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:46,320
So I really want to show them to you.

1412
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:48,320
Oh, what a wonderful clash.

1413
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:49,320
Yeah, we got to do that.

1414
01:19:49,320 --> 01:19:50,320
There's a goth in the hospital.

1415
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:54,560
Well, I will also say about the House of Blues that I think it operated really well as a

1416
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:55,560
restaurant, too.

1417
01:19:55,560 --> 01:20:00,160
Oh, and maybe that's because of it being like a really strong chain in that regard.

1418
01:20:00,160 --> 01:20:06,040
But I don't recall having a particularly bad meal ever and always kind of being happy that

1419
01:20:06,040 --> 01:20:11,760
we ended up there, you know, that it was going to have some sort of Cajun chicken thing.

1420
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:12,760
Yeah, barbecue.

1421
01:20:12,760 --> 01:20:13,760
Yeah.

1422
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:14,760
They done OK?

1423
01:20:14,760 --> 01:20:17,040
A barbecue like walk up window.

1424
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:19,120
And I was shocked that I never ended up.

1425
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:22,400
Like I was reading about it and I was like, how did I miss that?

1426
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:25,560
Because like if I don't know what I want to eat, I will.

1427
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:29,400
I could set a pulled pork sandwich if I'm having a fun day like that.

1428
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:30,400
That's great ribs on the go.

1429
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:32,280
Yeah, it's always solid.

1430
01:20:32,280 --> 01:20:37,520
And I also will say that the decor was, you know, really evocative.

1431
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:42,520
It's like very like dimly lit and you can kind of just like feel like a cool rocker

1432
01:20:42,520 --> 01:20:46,000
as a young 12 year old Julia Prescott.

1433
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,680
Like you're at a roadhouse by the crossroads.

1434
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:49,680
Yeah.

1435
01:20:49,680 --> 01:20:51,400
Where the devil met you one day.

1436
01:20:51,400 --> 01:20:52,400
Yeah.

1437
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:59,080
Well, what you're seeing on the on the walls, the specific term they would use is southern

1438
01:20:59,080 --> 01:21:02,720
primitive primitivist folk art.

1439
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:08,160
And I know this because I went down a rabbit hole of not Dan Aykroyd, but the original

1440
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:15,280
guy who founded the whole not just this, but was also the co-founder of Hard Rock Cafe.

1441
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:16,280
Oh, yeah.

1442
01:21:16,280 --> 01:21:18,880
His name is Isaac Tigrit.

1443
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:20,640
Did anyone else look up anything about Isaac?

1444
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:23,720
I think you went deeper than we did, but I saw a little bit.

1445
01:21:23,720 --> 01:21:24,720
Same kind of name.

1446
01:21:24,720 --> 01:21:26,800
It's like from the same generator on Buzzfeed.

1447
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:27,800
Yeah.

1448
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:30,680
For Tita and Tigrit.

1449
01:21:30,680 --> 01:21:31,920
OK.

1450
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:37,800
You know how we always say about when Hard Rock Cafe comes up and it does a lot, it's

1451
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:39,360
always like, what is this brand?

1452
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:40,360
What is it?

1453
01:21:40,360 --> 01:21:42,800
Why is it like rock the planet and all are one?

1454
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:45,320
And I think it's because of this guy.

1455
01:21:45,320 --> 01:21:50,760
I think, yeah, he's very spiritual and there's a lot.

1456
01:21:50,760 --> 01:21:54,080
He now is like mainly about his devotion to this guru.

1457
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:55,720
Yes, this guru I saw.

1458
01:21:55,720 --> 01:21:56,720
OK, yes.

1459
01:21:56,720 --> 01:21:59,400
You know what the guru guru is?

1460
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:05,280
Sethia Sal Baba, who there seems to be some controversy about according to Wikipedia.

1461
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:07,200
But I don't you know, you don't know how that's vetted.

1462
01:22:07,200 --> 01:22:09,200
And I don't want to cast judgment.

1463
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:15,120
But I watched some videos with Isaac Tigrit, including a full hour that Access Hollywood

1464
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:20,640
devoted to the House of Blues and just a video where he just kind of talks and tells a story.

1465
01:22:20,640 --> 01:22:23,120
This is all on Isaac-Tigrit.com.

1466
01:22:23,120 --> 01:22:27,240
And these videos were posted to his personal Vimeo.

1467
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:32,660
And so this guy was involved before the Akroyd was.

1468
01:22:32,660 --> 01:22:37,040
He brought Akroyd on board and just like, you know, let me let me see if I can get into

1469
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:38,040
the voice.

1470
01:22:38,040 --> 01:22:40,160
He's kind of this like this sort of breathy.

1471
01:22:40,160 --> 01:22:45,920
He's like a Tennessee guy and just, you know, just kind of like loves to loves to meander

1472
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:49,400
and talk about what he tells the story about the Harak Cafe.

1473
01:22:49,400 --> 01:22:54,880
And he says how, you know, really, we were the first American restaurant in Europe in

1474
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:58,680
a way, because everything before we opened was very high society.

1475
01:22:58,680 --> 01:23:01,680
And we really became the first classless restaurant.

1476
01:23:01,680 --> 01:23:02,680
Classless?

1477
01:23:02,680 --> 01:23:05,960
Yes, this is part of the mythology in their menus.

1478
01:23:05,960 --> 01:23:09,080
There used to be that it was like we were just a couple of guys and we wanted a good

1479
01:23:09,080 --> 01:23:11,720
burger in England and we couldn't find it.

1480
01:23:11,720 --> 01:23:12,720
Good burger and barbecue.

1481
01:23:12,720 --> 01:23:13,720
It can't be true.

1482
01:23:13,720 --> 01:23:14,720
I don't know.

1483
01:23:14,720 --> 01:23:15,720
It might be.

1484
01:23:15,720 --> 01:23:19,840
That is such the fill in the blank orange in the story of so many businesses to make

1485
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:20,840
themselves more appealing.

1486
01:23:20,840 --> 01:23:23,680
And we were friends with some rock stars and they gave us some guitars.

1487
01:23:23,680 --> 01:23:25,400
We said we got we don't have any decorations.

1488
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:26,880
They put it up on.

1489
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:29,040
So old Clapton gave me a guitar.

1490
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:30,680
I put it up on the wall.

1491
01:23:30,680 --> 01:23:35,480
All this stuff is just these guys, these maniacs that are trying to like get these primitive

1492
01:23:35,480 --> 01:23:36,480
urges.

1493
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:40,680
They're trying to conquer Europe again, but they can't do it with an army.

1494
01:23:40,680 --> 01:23:44,920
They're trying to put a fucking restaurant with a guitar in there or whatever.

1495
01:23:44,920 --> 01:23:45,920
Manifest Destiny.

1496
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:46,920
Yeah, Rainforest Man.

1497
01:23:46,920 --> 01:23:51,320
Now this is done with many, many boring meetings with venture capital people.

1498
01:23:51,320 --> 01:23:56,260
And I guess the restaurants could be likened to a temple and they themselves are the gods

1499
01:23:56,260 --> 01:23:57,260
of them.

1500
01:23:57,260 --> 01:23:58,260
Yes.

1501
01:23:58,260 --> 01:23:59,260
And so the artifacts and the temple.

1502
01:23:59,260 --> 01:24:03,320
And he's he I mean, he goes on to explain that, you know, when I moved to England, there

1503
01:24:03,320 --> 01:24:07,720
was really no place where a baker and a banker were allowed to commune.

1504
01:24:07,720 --> 01:24:08,720
Oh, no.

1505
01:24:08,720 --> 01:24:09,840
That's what you know.

1506
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:12,120
That's what I think of the Hard Rock Cafe.

1507
01:24:12,120 --> 01:24:18,360
Just like where where societal differences melt away like cheese on a cheeseburger.

1508
01:24:18,360 --> 01:24:24,440
That what a pub is like, isn't that famously what the neighborhood?

1509
01:24:24,440 --> 01:24:33,400
You walk into the pub, it's all bakers, I want the bankers to come.

1510
01:24:33,400 --> 01:24:38,640
And that's why when we got off the ground, you know, now we're doing 20 million in sales.

1511
01:24:38,640 --> 01:24:41,280
And that's the point where we were no longer a restaurant.

1512
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:42,280
We were a culture.

1513
01:24:42,280 --> 01:24:44,280
We were a cultural phenomenon.

1514
01:24:44,280 --> 01:24:45,280
Wow.

1515
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:46,280
This guy.

1516
01:24:46,280 --> 01:24:50,320
Can I book you for a new podcast just to do that?

1517
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:58,400
I think, you know, it's very it's soothing to me to talk like this and I could see why

1518
01:24:58,400 --> 01:24:59,400
he does it.

1519
01:24:59,400 --> 01:25:05,100
And I, you know, maybe I need the zen of the guru to, you know, attain my inner Tigris.

1520
01:25:05,100 --> 01:25:08,840
But he so then then he then he goes on to talk about the House of Blues and where this

1521
01:25:08,840 --> 01:25:09,840
came from.

1522
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:14,720
And he said he talks about, you know, to take a recognizable entity, that being the blues

1523
01:25:14,720 --> 01:25:21,000
and to put an umbrella over it and to trademark it and say, this is where you can go to.

1524
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:26,640
This is the official destination for it's like you're putting a trademark on the blues.

1525
01:25:26,640 --> 01:25:27,640
That's weird.

1526
01:25:27,640 --> 01:25:29,920
And you're and who are you?

1527
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:32,480
And when you look him up, here's who he is.

1528
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:35,680
His father was a business partner of J. Paul Getty.

1529
01:25:35,680 --> 01:25:36,680
Oh, no.

1530
01:25:36,680 --> 01:25:39,920
His great uncle was one of the major.

1531
01:25:39,920 --> 01:25:43,460
It was like a Gulf Railroad Baron.

1532
01:25:43,460 --> 01:25:45,800
It's like such many generations old money.

1533
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:50,400
His father also built a place called the Memphis Pyramid, which is one of the big like I didn't

1534
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:53,920
really know about this before, but it's I guess it used to be a sports arena in Memphis.

1535
01:25:53,920 --> 01:25:56,480
And now it is the world's largest Bass Pro Shop.

1536
01:25:56,480 --> 01:25:59,160
It's like a Bass Pro Shop that is a theme park inside a pyramid.

1537
01:25:59,160 --> 01:26:00,160
Oh, with the hotel.

1538
01:26:00,160 --> 01:26:01,160
Yeah.

1539
01:26:01,160 --> 01:26:02,160
OK.

1540
01:26:02,160 --> 01:26:03,160
With the pyramid.

1541
01:26:03,160 --> 01:26:04,160
Yeah.

1542
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:05,160
Yes.

1543
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:06,160
The pyramid shaped building.

1544
01:26:06,160 --> 01:26:07,160
I didn't know about this.

1545
01:26:07,160 --> 01:26:08,160
I didn't know about any of this.

1546
01:26:08,160 --> 01:26:09,160
I want to cover that place, but just to keep blasting through.

1547
01:26:09,160 --> 01:26:10,160
OK.

1548
01:26:10,160 --> 01:26:14,600
So you're in with railroad money who wants a place where we can trademark the blues.

1549
01:26:14,600 --> 01:26:15,600
And where do you begin?

1550
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:18,280
How do you begin to create this temple for the blues?

1551
01:26:18,280 --> 01:26:21,380
And if we thought about it, and there was really only one place and that is Harvard

1552
01:26:21,380 --> 01:26:23,040
Square in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

1553
01:26:23,040 --> 01:26:24,040
Yes.

1554
01:26:24,040 --> 01:26:25,040
First location, baby.

1555
01:26:25,040 --> 01:26:29,200
I read that too, that it came from Harvard money.

1556
01:26:29,200 --> 01:26:30,200
It came from his money.

1557
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:35,800
Harvard, the school Harvard were those initial investors in the House of Blues.

1558
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:42,880
Along with Dan Aykroyd, along with Paul Schaefer, River Phoenix.

1559
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:43,880
I know.

1560
01:26:43,880 --> 01:26:44,880
Yeah.

1561
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:45,880
Jim Belushi and Aerosmith.

1562
01:26:45,880 --> 01:26:46,880
Yes, I was going to say Aerosmith.

1563
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:47,880
I saw, yeah.

1564
01:26:47,880 --> 01:26:50,880
Just a little honky tonk by the crossroads.

1565
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:53,600
By the old Harvard yard.

1566
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:56,960
Harvard students, I think of how funky they are first.

1567
01:26:56,960 --> 01:27:01,200
And then I go into the national lampoon, Harvard lampoon kind of legacy.

1568
01:27:01,200 --> 01:27:02,200
Yes.

1569
01:27:02,200 --> 01:27:03,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1570
01:27:03,200 --> 01:27:04,200
That's the order every time.

1571
01:27:04,200 --> 01:27:05,960
I stop because I'm laughing so much.

1572
01:27:05,960 --> 01:27:06,960
I know.

1573
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:08,960
My tummy hurts because I got the giggles.

1574
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:11,760
Do you ever read those collections of the Harvard lampoon?

1575
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:12,760
I'm just laughing.

1576
01:27:12,760 --> 01:27:13,760
You're laughing at me.

1577
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:14,760
I'm on a plane.

1578
01:27:14,760 --> 01:27:15,760
We all love it.

1579
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:16,760
I'm disrupting everybody.

1580
01:27:16,760 --> 01:27:17,760
We love it.

1581
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:20,440
You know, a million dollars isn't cool.

1582
01:27:20,440 --> 01:27:22,160
You know what is cool?

1583
01:27:22,160 --> 01:27:26,280
Eric Clapton's guitar and a collection of the lampoon, baby.

1584
01:27:26,280 --> 01:27:31,240
You know, it's like without, you know, without lead belly, there would be no Colin Jost.

1585
01:27:31,240 --> 01:27:39,840
So, OK, so he so he enlists Dan Aykroyd.

1586
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:45,720
This was his railroad money man and list Dan Aykroyd to start a blues place in Harvard

1587
01:27:45,720 --> 01:27:48,200
with Harvard money.

1588
01:27:48,200 --> 01:27:53,840
And then so then this video I'm watching transitions now who gets involved, but Danny Aykroyd himself.

1589
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:57,760
And he talks, he's at the opening and he says this is this place is a celebration of African

1590
01:27:57,760 --> 01:27:58,760
American vitality.

1591
01:27:58,760 --> 01:28:04,200
Oh, we are people who came from hard Scrabble times.

1592
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:07,320
And this is, you know, there's so many people, so many musicians out there, you know, they

1593
01:28:07,320 --> 01:28:11,040
hear a song like Whole Lotta Love by Led Zeppelin and they wonder where did it come from?

1594
01:28:11,040 --> 01:28:12,960
And I say it came from Led Belly.

1595
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:13,960
It came from Robert Johnson.

1596
01:28:13,960 --> 01:28:15,960
It came from Howlin' Wolf.

1597
01:28:15,960 --> 01:28:21,440
And this is the place where there is a permanent fixture to what is that voice to think?

1598
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:23,200
I've cornered the market.

1599
01:28:23,200 --> 01:28:24,960
You're doing your tape right now.

1600
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:28,960
It's a well, I said that Colin Jones remark would fuck me over in there.

1601
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:30,960
But the second gate, maybe.

1602
01:28:30,960 --> 01:28:32,960
Oh, yeah, I can do that.

1603
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:34,960
Maybe clubs not reviewing this.

1604
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:40,960
So you're not playing any of those people like Jeremy Renner is going to stop by.

1605
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:42,960
Knock, knock.

1606
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:45,960
I mean, maybe not right now.

1607
01:28:45,960 --> 01:28:49,360
Jeremy Redder, but in the past, like six months ago, you're saying he's going to play Trump

1608
01:28:49,360 --> 01:28:50,360
cabinet members.

1609
01:28:50,360 --> 01:28:51,360
Yeah.

1610
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:52,360
Yeah.

1611
01:28:52,360 --> 01:28:55,360
Or Negros Sebastian Gorkas.

1612
01:28:55,360 --> 01:29:02,360
OK, so but Dan Aykroyd and Isaac Tigrit are starting a blues.

1613
01:29:02,360 --> 01:29:06,360
It's just like and this just brings me to OK, we've talked about Aykroyd a lot.

1614
01:29:06,360 --> 01:29:09,360
I think we never miss an opportunity to stop and talk about Aykroyd.

1615
01:29:09,360 --> 01:29:10,360
Yeah.

1616
01:29:10,360 --> 01:29:11,360
Oh, wait.

1617
01:29:11,360 --> 01:29:16,360
Oh, let me also say this whole thing with the Memphis pyramid, I said the father, this

1618
01:29:16,360 --> 01:29:17,360
guy's father built the Memphis pyramid.

1619
01:29:17,360 --> 01:29:23,360
And at some point, suddenly, mysteriously, what showed up in the Memphis pyramid?

1620
01:29:23,360 --> 01:29:25,360
A crystal skull.

1621
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:26,360
Oh, no.

1622
01:29:26,360 --> 01:29:31,360
Isaac Tigrit is also a crystal skull guy, independently of Aykroyd.

1623
01:29:31,360 --> 01:29:33,360
So no wonder they came together.

1624
01:29:33,360 --> 01:29:35,360
They're both white blues guys.

1625
01:29:35,360 --> 01:29:39,360
They're both ruthless, ruthless businessmen.

1626
01:29:39,360 --> 01:29:49,360
And now I just want to let's talk about this this this Aykroyd and Belushi and Blues Brothers

1627
01:29:49,360 --> 01:29:52,360
thing, because we never miss an opportunity to talk about it.

1628
01:29:52,360 --> 01:29:53,360
We have to.

1629
01:29:53,360 --> 01:29:57,360
And like somebody asked, what is actually your deal with Avatar?

1630
01:29:57,360 --> 01:29:58,360
And I wanted to actually answer it.

1631
01:29:58,360 --> 01:29:59,360
And I thought about it.

1632
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:02,360
And here's my answer to why.

1633
01:30:02,360 --> 01:30:04,360
Why would we keep talking about the Blues Brothers?

1634
01:30:04,360 --> 01:30:05,360
I think it's this.

1635
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:10,360
I think that there is almost no piece of pop culture that has been less successfully passed

1636
01:30:10,360 --> 01:30:13,360
between generations than the Blues Brothers.

1637
01:30:13,360 --> 01:30:14,360
What is it?

1638
01:30:14,360 --> 01:30:16,360
Why am I supposed to like?

1639
01:30:16,360 --> 01:30:17,360
Is it supposed to be funny?

1640
01:30:17,360 --> 01:30:18,360
Is it supposed to be cool?

1641
01:30:18,360 --> 01:30:19,360
Is it supposed to be good music?

1642
01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:24,360
No one's ever explained this to me, because to me, it's a weird nether realm that's like

1643
01:30:24,360 --> 01:30:25,360
none of it.

1644
01:30:25,360 --> 01:30:29,360
And so, I mean, do you guys know?

1645
01:30:29,360 --> 01:30:30,360
Like, what?

1646
01:30:30,360 --> 01:30:32,360
I don't have the answer for you.

1647
01:30:32,360 --> 01:30:34,360
I had no affection for it.

1648
01:30:34,360 --> 01:30:35,360
I don't have any now.

1649
01:30:35,360 --> 01:30:37,360
And I love old SNL stuff.

1650
01:30:37,360 --> 01:30:38,360
I love it.

1651
01:30:38,360 --> 01:30:39,360
I love Dan Agra.

1652
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:40,360
I grew up loving Dan Agra.

1653
01:30:40,360 --> 01:30:41,360
Yes, of course.

1654
01:30:41,360 --> 01:30:42,360
Yes.

1655
01:30:42,360 --> 01:30:43,360
But this thing, I've never.

1656
01:30:43,360 --> 01:30:44,360
This is.

1657
01:30:44,360 --> 01:30:45,360
I think you're right.

1658
01:30:45,360 --> 01:30:46,360
Yeah.

1659
01:30:46,360 --> 01:30:50,360
Well, I think that it's because they are like very clearly costume characters that we see

1660
01:30:50,360 --> 01:30:53,360
at Universal Studios and we can identify, oh, those are the Blues guys.

1661
01:30:53,360 --> 01:30:54,360
They are the Blues Brothers.

1662
01:30:54,360 --> 01:30:56,360
But truly nothing beyond that.

1663
01:30:56,360 --> 01:31:00,360
But I do remember when Blues Brothers 2000 came out and they had a little kid.

1664
01:31:00,360 --> 01:31:04,360
I was at that age of like growing up in the Valley and wanting to be a kid actor.

1665
01:31:04,360 --> 01:31:06,360
I was like, oh, that's a role for me.

1666
01:31:06,360 --> 01:31:07,360
Even though it was already cast.

1667
01:31:07,360 --> 01:31:08,360
I think I might have thought the same thing.

1668
01:31:08,360 --> 01:31:09,360
Yeah.

1669
01:31:09,360 --> 01:31:10,360
Even though I'm like, I don't like this.

1670
01:31:10,360 --> 01:31:11,360
Yeah.

1671
01:31:11,360 --> 01:31:14,360
You're like, if I were to be cast in anything, I would like to be the kid in an adult comedy.

1672
01:31:14,360 --> 01:31:15,360
Yeah.

1673
01:31:15,360 --> 01:31:18,360
If I could show the Blues Brothers that I'm cool.

1674
01:31:18,360 --> 01:31:23,360
I was going to say, is it, which Kuhn writer tweeted about Prom King comedy?

1675
01:31:23,360 --> 01:31:24,360
Was it Andre?

1676
01:31:24,360 --> 01:31:25,360
Yeah.

1677
01:31:25,360 --> 01:31:27,360
But I don't disagree with what he's saying.

1678
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:30,360
No one disagrees with it, but it's supposed to be shoved in a drawer forever.

1679
01:31:30,360 --> 01:31:31,360
Yeah, of course.

1680
01:31:31,360 --> 01:31:32,360
Well, this is paywall.

1681
01:31:32,360 --> 01:31:34,360
I like Andre a lot.

1682
01:31:34,360 --> 01:31:37,360
That being said, Blues Brothers is Prom King comedy.

1683
01:31:37,360 --> 01:31:38,360
It is.

1684
01:31:38,360 --> 01:31:40,360
And there's so much old SNL that is-

1685
01:31:40,360 --> 01:31:41,360
We're going to dance around and do it.

1686
01:31:41,360 --> 01:31:42,360
Yes.

1687
01:31:42,360 --> 01:31:43,360
We're going to pretend like we're the Blues guys.

1688
01:31:43,360 --> 01:31:45,360
They were at least B's when this first started.

1689
01:31:45,360 --> 01:31:47,360
At least they looked silly.

1690
01:31:47,360 --> 01:31:50,360
And then they're like, you know what would be better if we didn't look silly?

1691
01:31:50,360 --> 01:31:51,360
If we looked cool.

1692
01:31:51,360 --> 01:31:52,360
I know.

1693
01:31:52,360 --> 01:31:55,360
If we thought that we were cool and if we had the top record and the top-

1694
01:31:55,360 --> 01:31:56,360
Yes.

1695
01:31:56,360 --> 01:32:00,360
There's so much old SNL of them all just thinking they're hot shit and the coolest people.

1696
01:32:00,360 --> 01:32:01,360
It's no different.

1697
01:32:01,360 --> 01:32:06,360
It's just there's a different version of it now coming out where it's like the comedy isn't

1698
01:32:06,360 --> 01:32:07,360
real.

1699
01:32:07,360 --> 01:32:08,360
The person's trying to look cool more than the-

1700
01:32:08,360 --> 01:32:13,360
Well, there's been this thing that's happened where I think the Lonely Island knew that

1701
01:32:13,360 --> 01:32:17,360
comedy rap is a dicey area, so we have to look very foolish.

1702
01:32:17,360 --> 01:32:18,360
Yes.

1703
01:32:18,360 --> 01:32:20,360
It's always going to be very self-deprecating and that's how we get away with it.

1704
01:32:20,360 --> 01:32:24,360
And then there's been generations since that are like, I'm cool and good at rapping.

1705
01:32:24,360 --> 01:32:25,360
Yes.

1706
01:32:25,360 --> 01:32:26,360
And that's what my comedy is.

1707
01:32:26,360 --> 01:32:27,360
Yeah.

1708
01:32:27,360 --> 01:32:31,520
Well, I mean, not to bring this into the conversation, but like the YouTube influencer culture of

1709
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:36,360
that I feel is a direct link to I got to be cool and also do this comedy thing.

1710
01:32:36,360 --> 01:32:40,360
They're worshiping Lonely Island and they missed a piece where they did comedy in it.

1711
01:32:40,360 --> 01:32:41,360
Absolutely.

1712
01:32:41,360 --> 01:32:42,360
Yes.

1713
01:32:42,360 --> 01:32:46,360
I think there's more comedy in every single Lonely Island song than there is in the entire

1714
01:32:46,360 --> 01:32:47,360
Blues Brothers.

1715
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:48,360
Yeah.

1716
01:32:48,360 --> 01:32:49,360
I just don't even try.

1717
01:32:49,360 --> 01:32:53,360
It's just not even- But are we supposed to think a Blues Brothers record is funny?

1718
01:32:53,360 --> 01:32:54,360
We're not, right?

1719
01:32:54,360 --> 01:32:55,360
No.

1720
01:32:55,360 --> 01:32:56,360
It's just too cool.

1721
01:32:56,360 --> 01:32:58,360
I think it's just straight like Blues covers.

1722
01:32:58,360 --> 01:33:04,080
Julia, what you said kind of hit on something for me of like, yeah, as a kid, I knew them

1723
01:33:04,080 --> 01:33:06,760
from, I knew they were guys around.

1724
01:33:06,760 --> 01:33:08,200
They were like in the ether.

1725
01:33:08,200 --> 01:33:14,080
I think in college I finally like got the Blues Brothers movie DVD from Netflix and

1726
01:33:14,080 --> 01:33:17,480
I liked it because it's such an oddball thing.

1727
01:33:17,480 --> 01:33:18,760
Like they're- Yeah.

1728
01:33:18,760 --> 01:33:22,960
Carrie Fisher's trying to kill them because she loves them and the Nazis.

1729
01:33:22,960 --> 01:33:23,960
There's a lot of antics.

1730
01:33:23,960 --> 01:33:25,920
I think they should get the movie a little more.

1731
01:33:25,920 --> 01:33:26,920
Yes.

1732
01:33:26,920 --> 01:33:32,680
But that said, I realized I don't have the context of like years of the first few years

1733
01:33:32,680 --> 01:33:38,120
of SNL where like it was like, it was so big.

1734
01:33:38,120 --> 01:33:39,120
It was so popular.

1735
01:33:39,120 --> 01:33:43,680
And that was supposed to be like, I mean, it couldn't have been their Wayne's World,

1736
01:33:43,680 --> 01:33:47,960
but we know it more of like, that was supposed to be their Wayne's World movie of like transitioning

1737
01:33:47,960 --> 01:33:50,800
from SNL to making this movie.

1738
01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:52,160
And I think they were still trying to figure it out.

1739
01:33:52,160 --> 01:33:57,000
And also like 70s comedies were really hit or miss.

1740
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,600
I don't think I understand Animal House really.

1741
01:33:59,600 --> 01:34:02,120
I think I'm not like huge on- Yeah.

1742
01:34:02,120 --> 01:34:06,200
I think Caddyshack probably holds it the best, but like Meatballs is like-

1743
01:34:06,200 --> 01:34:07,200
I know.

1744
01:34:07,200 --> 01:34:08,200
It's a total mess.

1745
01:34:08,200 --> 01:34:13,040
I think that like tone was like a big struggle for a lot of people because I think also,

1746
01:34:13,040 --> 01:34:18,120
not to be all film school, but like 70s American cinema was trying so hard to evoke French

1747
01:34:18,120 --> 01:34:22,360
New Wave and evoke other like European styles and like cinematography.

1748
01:34:22,360 --> 01:34:27,040
And so when you have like in one theater, the conversation playing to sold out audiences

1749
01:34:27,040 --> 01:34:30,680
and then you have a comedy in the next room, they're trying to be something different,

1750
01:34:30,680 --> 01:34:33,600
but also evoke that same kind of heat.

1751
01:34:33,600 --> 01:34:38,720
And I think that like the tone gets instantly lost with that because you can't be serious

1752
01:34:38,720 --> 01:34:40,560
and silly at the same time in that way.

1753
01:34:40,560 --> 01:34:47,040
It's like if you put Peckinpah's Wild Bunch next to Rainforest Cafe's Wild Bunch, which

1754
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:50,200
is a remake, I would love to be involved with.

1755
01:34:50,200 --> 01:34:51,200
Yeah, yeah.

1756
01:34:51,200 --> 01:34:53,760
I think you've just set up your next job.

1757
01:34:53,760 --> 01:34:55,800
The Rainforest Cafe internal video.

1758
01:34:55,800 --> 01:35:00,040
I mean, they'll need a new Insular product to sell once Shut Up and Listen is sold out.

1759
01:35:00,040 --> 01:35:06,600
Jason, I want to say I fucking hope some executive at Quibi is a Patreon subscriber so that he

1760
01:35:06,600 --> 01:35:08,440
can hear that pitch and fucking jump at the phone.

1761
01:35:08,440 --> 01:35:13,080
And I hope we make this happen and I hope Pauline Kale comes back from the dead and

1762
01:35:13,080 --> 01:35:14,080
murders me.

1763
01:35:14,080 --> 01:35:15,080
Yes.

1764
01:35:15,080 --> 01:35:19,040
I will write that Quibi series.

1765
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:22,360
Yeah, that would be great.

1766
01:35:22,360 --> 01:35:25,120
I just, I don't know, I just wanted to air some of that out.

1767
01:35:25,120 --> 01:35:29,240
And the other question I have is like, okay, so even let me say that I, let's assume that

1768
01:35:29,240 --> 01:35:32,440
we got on board and do think the blues brothers are cool.

1769
01:35:32,440 --> 01:35:35,200
I think their music is good music.

1770
01:35:35,200 --> 01:35:41,440
Am I then supposed to allow, let's say forever, forever, for decades and decades that the

1771
01:35:41,440 --> 01:35:47,840
brother of the fake blues guy gets to do blues forever because of who his brother was?

1772
01:35:47,840 --> 01:35:48,840
Yeah.

1773
01:35:48,840 --> 01:35:49,840
Excuse me?

1774
01:35:49,840 --> 01:35:52,840
Why is this okay?

1775
01:35:52,840 --> 01:35:55,280
I feel bad for Jim Belushi to a degree.

1776
01:35:55,280 --> 01:35:56,280
Why?

1777
01:35:56,280 --> 01:35:57,280
For many reasons.

1778
01:35:57,280 --> 01:35:58,280
But I also can't forgive that.

1779
01:35:58,280 --> 01:35:59,280
I think everybody's backing off.

1780
01:35:59,280 --> 01:36:00,280
I'm not backing off.

1781
01:36:00,280 --> 01:36:03,280
No, I don't want to back, I'm not backing off.

1782
01:36:03,280 --> 01:36:06,640
What do you, come on, this, this, it's not good.

1783
01:36:06,640 --> 01:36:08,760
None of this is good, what he does.

1784
01:36:08,760 --> 01:36:11,040
My mom likes him better than his brother.

1785
01:36:11,040 --> 01:36:12,040
She said that.

1786
01:36:12,040 --> 01:36:13,040
Okay.

1787
01:36:13,040 --> 01:36:14,040
Man.

1788
01:36:14,040 --> 01:36:15,040
All right.

1789
01:36:15,040 --> 01:36:16,040
We don't have time to get into that.

1790
01:36:16,040 --> 01:36:19,960
This is from the opening when House of Blues moved to the Garden Walk.

1791
01:36:19,960 --> 01:36:21,880
Here's a picture of them in 2017.

1792
01:36:21,880 --> 01:36:22,880
Yeah.

1793
01:36:22,880 --> 01:36:27,920
I just noticed a few minutes ago, if you zoom in, Ackroyd is wearing a custom crystal head

1794
01:36:27,920 --> 01:36:29,400
vodka leather jacket.

1795
01:36:29,400 --> 01:36:30,400
No.

1796
01:36:30,400 --> 01:36:35,880
He has like a motorcycle cap he wears sometimes in promotional appearances where he has the

1797
01:36:35,880 --> 01:36:37,840
crystal head vodka.

1798
01:36:37,840 --> 01:36:45,000
He, he doesn't, he's like a NASCAR driver with all the crystal head logos on him.

1799
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:46,000
Yeah.

1800
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:50,880
There's the Five Timers Club sketch monologue where he's the bartender and the, all behind

1801
01:36:50,880 --> 01:36:51,880
him is all crystal skulls.

1802
01:36:51,880 --> 01:36:54,880
Oh my God, I bet he had a tantrum for that too.

1803
01:36:54,880 --> 01:36:55,880
To call your shot.

1804
01:36:55,880 --> 01:36:56,880
Wow.

1805
01:36:56,880 --> 01:36:59,280
At Horror Nights, I said it, the crystal heads are everywhere.

1806
01:36:59,280 --> 01:37:00,280
Yeah.

1807
01:37:00,280 --> 01:37:02,720
Did you guys, have you had it before?

1808
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:03,720
I have.

1809
01:37:03,720 --> 01:37:04,720
No, I didn't like it.

1810
01:37:04,720 --> 01:37:09,480
I had it at Horror Nights and he claims, and I don't want to try to, you know, it's purely

1811
01:37:09,480 --> 01:37:11,280
distilled, it won't give you a hangover.

1812
01:37:11,280 --> 01:37:15,080
If there's no hangover, he goes, after five, I can't tell you what'll happen, but before

1813
01:37:15,080 --> 01:37:16,080
five, no hangover.

1814
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:19,000
And he gets like this whole thing of poured over magical crystals.

1815
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:20,920
Like he does a whole rap about it.

1816
01:37:20,920 --> 01:37:23,440
I had it, I don't know if I had enough.

1817
01:37:23,440 --> 01:37:25,680
I barely didn't feel, I didn't feel a buzz or anything.

1818
01:37:25,680 --> 01:37:26,960
It was mixed in with some sugar.

1819
01:37:26,960 --> 01:37:29,960
I didn't like that the taste was kind of nothing when I had it.

1820
01:37:29,960 --> 01:37:31,360
We should review it on a page.

1821
01:37:31,360 --> 01:37:33,600
I don't have a good idea.

1822
01:37:33,600 --> 01:37:34,600
It's fine.

1823
01:37:34,600 --> 01:37:37,600
I had a comedy boyfriend who tweeted.

1824
01:37:37,600 --> 01:37:38,600
I'm so sorry.

1825
01:37:38,600 --> 01:37:39,600
Apologies.

1826
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:44,120
I know I've had many, I'm sorry to say.

1827
01:37:44,120 --> 01:37:50,200
I had a comedy boyfriend who tweeted at them and then like somehow finagled a deal where

1828
01:37:50,200 --> 01:37:55,360
they shipped him boxes of it so he could make comedy videos promoting it.

1829
01:37:55,360 --> 01:38:00,180
And I think this was like early enough in brands engaging with quote unquote influencers

1830
01:38:00,180 --> 01:38:02,520
that they were like, and even goes.

1831
01:38:02,520 --> 01:38:07,840
Of course, inevitably we drank all the vodka or he drank all the vodka before shooting

1832
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:08,840
anything.

1833
01:38:08,840 --> 01:38:13,280
And then I just remember like a really slapped together like sketch, if you would call it

1834
01:38:13,280 --> 01:38:16,320
of crystal head vodka bottles filled with water.

1835
01:38:16,320 --> 01:38:20,080
Cause he just completely, yeah.

1836
01:38:20,080 --> 01:38:21,560
He'd guzzle down the supply.

1837
01:38:21,560 --> 01:38:24,960
Anyway, I think we broke up shortly after that.

1838
01:38:24,960 --> 01:38:27,600
The sketch was him skull fucking the crystal skull.

1839
01:38:27,600 --> 01:38:31,440
They're like, no, this campaign is canceled.

1840
01:38:31,440 --> 01:38:38,200
I feel like I remember sitting in his like garage converted living space and being like,

1841
01:38:38,200 --> 01:38:39,600
this is not long for this world.

1842
01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:42,920
I need to get out and see the sun.

1843
01:38:42,920 --> 01:38:43,920
There's a video.

1844
01:38:43,920 --> 01:38:44,920
I have it on DVD.

1845
01:38:44,920 --> 01:38:45,920
I ordered it.

1846
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:46,920
We haven't watched it yet.

1847
01:38:46,920 --> 01:38:49,360
I've seen it many times is Dan Aykroyd being interviewed about UFOs.

1848
01:38:49,360 --> 01:38:53,320
And I feel like we'll have to get a bottle of the crystal head and then do it.

1849
01:38:53,320 --> 01:38:54,320
Watch it.

1850
01:38:54,320 --> 01:38:57,560
And listen to all the blues record.

1851
01:38:57,560 --> 01:38:59,560
Have blues will travel.

1852
01:38:59,560 --> 01:39:01,120
The new, the newer one.

1853
01:39:01,120 --> 01:39:02,120
Yeah.

1854
01:39:02,120 --> 01:39:03,120
The recent one.

1855
01:39:03,120 --> 01:39:05,480
Cause he made a recent albums with Jim Belushi.

1856
01:39:05,480 --> 01:39:07,880
No, he had one that was like they're combined.

1857
01:39:07,880 --> 01:39:10,720
It was like 500 pounds of fun or something.

1858
01:39:10,720 --> 01:39:12,960
I mean, yeah.

1859
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:19,600
The way they're looking in that photo, I don't look, they also like move very slow.

1860
01:39:19,600 --> 01:39:24,160
Like that's what I look, I guess my expectation should be low for the blues brothers in 2019.

1861
01:39:24,160 --> 01:39:27,400
Like you see a video with that, like they still play the, they're willing to play the

1862
01:39:27,400 --> 01:39:30,080
inauguration, not the inauguration, the 4th of July.

1863
01:39:30,080 --> 01:39:33,720
It's to them and it's beach boys and Buffett and Stamos and Stamos.

1864
01:39:33,720 --> 01:39:34,720
Yes.

1865
01:39:34,720 --> 01:39:35,720
The triple B's, the holy be Trinity.

1866
01:39:35,720 --> 01:39:36,720
Yes.

1867
01:39:36,720 --> 01:39:37,720
Yeah.

1868
01:39:37,720 --> 01:39:38,720
Yeah.

1869
01:39:38,720 --> 01:39:39,720
No offense to any of these people.

1870
01:39:39,720 --> 01:39:49,400
But they like, they come out and just like steps like they feel like they're, they seem

1871
01:39:49,400 --> 01:39:50,400
like they're nervous.

1872
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:51,400
They're going to fall or something.

1873
01:39:51,400 --> 01:39:52,400
They are.

1874
01:39:52,400 --> 01:39:53,400
I'm sure they are.

1875
01:39:53,400 --> 01:39:54,400
Yeah.

1876
01:39:54,400 --> 01:39:55,400
But why do they get to do this?

1877
01:39:55,400 --> 01:39:56,400
Well, he doesn't want to drop his mouth.

1878
01:39:56,400 --> 01:39:59,080
The word again, you know, you got the mouth where it can go.

1879
01:39:59,080 --> 01:40:04,000
Boy, if I fell on the ground, it'd be hard scrabble time.

1880
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:12,200
That being said, it's like goofy as the actual living or I guess Dan blues brothers are the

1881
01:40:12,200 --> 01:40:18,480
way they brand that gift shop in the house of blues feels very different, but also very

1882
01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:19,480
like intriguing.

1883
01:40:19,480 --> 01:40:20,480
I don't know.

1884
01:40:20,480 --> 01:40:21,800
Am I just a gift shop person?

1885
01:40:21,800 --> 01:40:27,840
I remember like deeply considering an Elwood t-shirt several times.

1886
01:40:27,840 --> 01:40:30,280
They just make, they've got a good font.

1887
01:40:30,280 --> 01:40:31,480
I'm a sucker for a good font.

1888
01:40:31,480 --> 01:40:32,480
It is a good font.

1889
01:40:32,480 --> 01:40:36,920
We've told this is, we can't get too off the rails here, but we also discovered or I forget,

1890
01:40:36,920 --> 01:40:42,840
I think I discovered a year ago that there are two touring entities of the blues brothers.

1891
01:40:42,840 --> 01:40:47,400
There are the blues brothers proper, which is acro right in Jim Belushi.

1892
01:40:47,400 --> 01:40:51,600
But then there's also something called the official blues brothers review, which are

1893
01:40:51,600 --> 01:40:53,100
not them.

1894
01:40:53,100 --> 01:40:57,440
Two younger guys do the whole blues brothers act and they tour.

1895
01:40:57,440 --> 01:40:58,440
They're part of it.

1896
01:40:58,440 --> 01:40:59,480
Like they own it.

1897
01:40:59,480 --> 01:41:00,480
They own it.

1898
01:41:00,480 --> 01:41:03,280
So it's like, I think Nick money said he thinks kiss soon.

1899
01:41:03,280 --> 01:41:06,080
We'll just convert to a fully new kiss franchise.

1900
01:41:06,080 --> 01:41:07,080
It's a franchise.

1901
01:41:07,080 --> 01:41:08,480
Yeah, we, yeah, that makes sense.

1902
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:12,520
It'll be to bring it back to my house of blue Scott experience.

1903
01:41:12,520 --> 01:41:15,560
That reminds me a lot of safe Ferris and star pool.

1904
01:41:15,560 --> 01:41:17,000
Do you guys know about this?

1905
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:18,000
No.

1906
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:25,800
So safe Ferris lead singer, Monique Powell, there's a lot of words written online about

1907
01:41:25,800 --> 01:41:31,520
how she behaved in that band, which then led ultimately to the band's breakup.

1908
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:37,760
And literally all of the members, except for Monique started a new band called star pool.

1909
01:41:37,760 --> 01:41:42,680
And then she was not a part of that, but then, and then star pool toured around and they,

1910
01:41:42,680 --> 01:41:43,680
they slept.

1911
01:41:43,680 --> 01:41:45,600
They were good.

1912
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:53,560
And then years later, Monique got back into the game and tried to start a new band called

1913
01:41:53,560 --> 01:41:57,800
safe Ferris and like re-ups the website and everything.

1914
01:41:57,800 --> 01:42:01,440
And then immediately all the star pool people were like, uh, no, fuck that.

1915
01:42:01,440 --> 01:42:02,680
We are safe Ferris as well.

1916
01:42:02,680 --> 01:42:04,880
And you can't do this without our permission.

1917
01:42:04,880 --> 01:42:08,160
And then they got into a legal dispute back and forth.

1918
01:42:08,160 --> 01:42:12,320
And so that ultimately led to if you, for a period of time, if you logged onto the safe

1919
01:42:12,320 --> 01:42:16,760
Ferris website and maybe it still is up there, but like the first thing you see is like a

1920
01:42:16,760 --> 01:42:22,200
whole legal jargon notice that said like, um, like we are not associated with Monique

1921
01:42:22,200 --> 01:42:24,280
Powell, say Ferris, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1922
01:42:24,280 --> 01:42:28,800
And like did this whole like airing dirty laundry thing out for the world to see.

1923
01:42:28,800 --> 01:42:33,720
Um, Brandy Posey, uh, very really funny comic who's also a Scott kid would tell me she would

1924
01:42:33,720 --> 01:42:38,000
like give me live updates about the drama between Monique and the rest of safe Ferris

1925
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:42,560
and how it was tearing apart the OCE Scott scene on the website.

1926
01:42:42,560 --> 01:42:46,320
But yeah, I mean like she just woke up and was like, I'm safe Ferris.

1927
01:42:46,320 --> 01:42:49,200
I can just do this and we still have appeal.

1928
01:42:49,200 --> 01:42:51,920
There's a, well, what you're describing, the syndrome you're describing has to be

1929
01:42:51,920 --> 01:42:54,080
described as no homers club.

1930
01:42:54,080 --> 01:42:55,080
Yeah.

1931
01:42:55,080 --> 01:42:56,080
No homers.

1932
01:42:56,080 --> 01:43:02,200
And I, there's kind of a, like, there's probably a lot of bands you could put in the, in the

1933
01:43:02,200 --> 01:43:03,640
category of no homers club.

1934
01:43:03,640 --> 01:43:10,600
Like when like some of Van Halen reforms or kind of no homers clubs is ELO kind of like

1935
01:43:10,600 --> 01:43:11,600
that.

1936
01:43:11,600 --> 01:43:12,600
Right.

1937
01:43:12,600 --> 01:43:15,520
Well, ELO is like one guy that's besides Jeff Lane who actually matters in the rest of

1938
01:43:15,520 --> 01:43:16,520
the story.

1939
01:43:16,520 --> 01:43:17,520
Yeah.

1940
01:43:17,520 --> 01:43:19,400
The who is kind of turning into that because they're dead.

1941
01:43:19,400 --> 01:43:23,720
Not, not by their own, the ones where it's like, we got to figure out a tour, but without

1942
01:43:23,720 --> 01:43:29,920
that guy that we know sticks is kind of a no homers club for Dennis DeYoung.

1943
01:43:29,920 --> 01:43:31,160
Journey Queen by force.

1944
01:43:31,160 --> 01:43:35,360
I think if there's a, if you're at this death, no homers clubs and there's, they're alive

1945
01:43:35,360 --> 01:43:36,360
and we don't want to talk to them.

1946
01:43:36,360 --> 01:43:37,360
Journey is a no homers.

1947
01:43:37,360 --> 01:43:40,360
I'm more intrigued by they're alive and I don't want to talk to them.

1948
01:43:40,360 --> 01:43:41,360
Oh yeah.

1949
01:43:41,360 --> 01:43:42,360
Oh yeah.

1950
01:43:42,360 --> 01:43:43,360
You said, yeah.

1951
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:46,320
And then it's amazing that like Aerosmith is the same guys.

1952
01:43:46,320 --> 01:43:47,320
Truly.

1953
01:43:47,320 --> 01:43:48,320
Mike's so happy.

1954
01:43:48,320 --> 01:43:50,880
I'm so happy because I'm going to see that Deuce's wild tour.

1955
01:43:50,880 --> 01:43:52,880
I swear I'll go to Vegas to see that.

1956
01:43:52,880 --> 01:43:53,880
And.

1957
01:43:53,880 --> 01:43:55,400
They're just getting vitamin injections every day probably.

1958
01:43:55,400 --> 01:43:56,400
Oh yeah.

1959
01:43:56,400 --> 01:44:00,520
Say, Mike, do you know what kind of coffee they serve at house of blues locations?

1960
01:44:00,520 --> 01:44:02,280
Some sort of Aerosmith coffee.

1961
01:44:02,280 --> 01:44:07,840
They serve Rockin' and Roastin', which of course is Joey Kramer's coffee brands.

1962
01:44:07,840 --> 01:44:08,840
Wow.

1963
01:44:08,840 --> 01:44:09,840
I'm choking on my own spit.

1964
01:44:09,840 --> 01:44:13,320
Mike spit out his Rockin' and Roastin', his Columbia blend.

1965
01:44:13,320 --> 01:44:15,480
Your famous daily cup of Rockin' and Roastin'.

1966
01:44:15,480 --> 01:44:16,480
Oh my favorite, Joey Kramer's coffee.

1967
01:44:16,480 --> 01:44:20,680
That reminds me of, do you guys remember when David Lynch, I guess he still has this.

1968
01:44:20,680 --> 01:44:21,680
Oh, he has the coffee.

1969
01:44:21,680 --> 01:44:22,680
He has his coffee too.

1970
01:44:22,680 --> 01:44:27,720
I worked at a movie theater my freshman year of college and it was like an indie movie

1971
01:44:27,720 --> 01:44:28,720
theater.

1972
01:44:28,720 --> 01:44:31,720
So we had, I want to say, wow, fuck.

1973
01:44:31,720 --> 01:44:34,080
What was that movie?

1974
01:44:34,080 --> 01:44:35,080
This is not going to narrow it down.

1975
01:44:35,080 --> 01:44:36,080
Inland Empire?

1976
01:44:36,080 --> 01:44:37,080
Inland Empire.

1977
01:44:37,080 --> 01:44:38,080
Yeah.

1978
01:44:38,080 --> 01:44:39,080
I was like, what was that movie that was like three hours long?

1979
01:44:39,080 --> 01:44:43,720
Three hours long shot on a grainy digital video, which I actually think is probably,

1980
01:44:43,720 --> 01:44:50,040
I'm interested to revisit it, not for the plot, because I think that aesthetic is interesting.

1981
01:44:50,040 --> 01:44:52,040
I did not see the full movie.

1982
01:44:52,040 --> 01:44:54,920
Of course, when you're in movie theater and you're working concessions, you take a peek

1983
01:44:54,920 --> 01:44:56,060
inside.

1984
01:44:56,060 --> 01:45:00,640
But I will say that that movie, when we had it, I want to say for like a couple of weeks,

1985
01:45:00,640 --> 01:45:06,080
literally every single show, somebody would walk out at the hour and a half minute mark,

1986
01:45:06,080 --> 01:45:10,480
go to concessions with a glazed over look in their eye.

1987
01:45:10,480 --> 01:45:17,680
One guy, I remember went up to me and he goes, hey, I don't want to refund or anything,

1988
01:45:17,680 --> 01:45:20,840
but what's happening in there?

1989
01:45:20,840 --> 01:45:23,040
Can you just tell me?

1990
01:45:23,040 --> 01:45:25,360
I was like, I've never seen it.

1991
01:45:25,360 --> 01:45:26,360
Oh, fuck.

1992
01:45:26,360 --> 01:45:27,360
It's your job.

1993
01:45:27,360 --> 01:45:28,360
Yeah.

1994
01:45:28,360 --> 01:45:35,000
But I was going to say that like the best part of us having that movie was we all got

1995
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:36,720
bags and bags of David Lynch coffee.

1996
01:45:36,720 --> 01:45:39,240
So really, as a young freshman in college.

1997
01:45:39,240 --> 01:45:44,560
Yeah, we just got to take home and I was like sitting pretty with all these bags of David

1998
01:45:44,560 --> 01:45:46,280
Lynch coffee, which is pretty good.

1999
01:45:46,280 --> 01:45:47,280
Yeah.

2000
01:45:47,280 --> 01:45:49,280
Celebrity novelty coffee.

2001
01:45:49,280 --> 01:45:50,280
I dig it.

2002
01:45:50,280 --> 01:45:51,680
He seemed pretty hands on.

2003
01:45:51,680 --> 01:45:54,240
He seemed like actually invested in it.

2004
01:45:54,240 --> 01:45:57,280
You're saying Joey Kramer was not hands on?

2005
01:45:57,280 --> 01:46:00,600
I don't know enough about Joey Kramer to say I'm just going to the right thing.

2006
01:46:00,600 --> 01:46:06,720
Like in an Aerosmith song, he's the driving beach behind the enterprise.

2007
01:46:06,720 --> 01:46:10,760
So is it Aerosmith themed, is it just one roast or are there multiple roasts?

2008
01:46:10,760 --> 01:46:11,760
I think it's one roast.

2009
01:46:11,760 --> 01:46:13,640
I might have that roast in it.

2010
01:46:13,640 --> 01:46:18,600
But he represents all his favorite coffee regions from Ethiopia.

2011
01:46:18,600 --> 01:46:19,920
And I'm like, this is the same thing.

2012
01:46:19,920 --> 01:46:24,600
This is the blues man taking his like nativist blues art.

2013
01:46:24,600 --> 01:46:30,080
This is all of these billionaires like moving around.

2014
01:46:30,080 --> 01:46:38,400
Just trying to make their horrible, relentless, capitalist, terrible restaurant sound like

2015
01:46:38,400 --> 01:46:43,440
it has some sort of meaning to it other than just to make people go, ah, there's a cheeseburger

2016
01:46:43,440 --> 01:46:44,440
there, I guess.

2017
01:46:44,440 --> 01:46:45,440
Right.

2018
01:46:45,440 --> 01:46:48,880
It's sort of like it was mirrored with the trend of Tom's shoes and the one for one model

2019
01:46:48,880 --> 01:46:51,880
that happened later of like everything has to be one for one.

2020
01:46:51,880 --> 01:46:56,680
And then I know you guys all watch Shark Tank and all those shows because we all love The

2021
01:46:56,680 --> 01:47:02,040
Sharks, but then I feel like you'd see like a whole season of Shark Tank where every single

2022
01:47:02,040 --> 01:47:04,680
business model had that one for one.

2023
01:47:04,680 --> 01:47:07,720
And like slowly all the sharks were calling them out of like, this is unsustainable.

2024
01:47:07,720 --> 01:47:12,760
Why don't you get the first one good before you give out one?

2025
01:47:12,760 --> 01:47:17,160
Like just to try and seem like it reminds me of if you ever guys, if you guys ever saw

2026
01:47:17,160 --> 01:47:24,520
the blog Humanitarians of Tinder, it was a bunch of like bro-y douche bros like on Machu

2027
01:47:24,520 --> 01:47:30,360
Pichu like posing for their Tinder profile or like with indigenous children.

2028
01:47:30,360 --> 01:47:33,160
And it was bad, really bad.

2029
01:47:33,160 --> 01:47:35,400
This whole sector has been your children.

2030
01:47:35,400 --> 01:47:36,400
I know.

2031
01:47:36,400 --> 01:47:37,400
King of the rainforest.

2032
01:47:37,400 --> 01:47:40,360
Here's Isaac Tigret, the King of the Blues.

2033
01:47:40,360 --> 01:47:44,840
There's Joey Kramer, founder and chairman of, he's a coffee loving rock and roll hall of

2034
01:47:44,840 --> 01:47:45,840
famer.

2035
01:47:45,840 --> 01:47:50,040
He's pounded the skin since his early teens fueled by a love for music and a spirit, a

2036
01:47:50,040 --> 01:47:52,000
love of spirited beans.

2037
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:53,000
Wow.

2038
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:54,920
You, you said that all off the dome.

2039
01:47:54,920 --> 01:47:55,920
Yeah, really?

2040
01:47:55,920 --> 01:47:59,880
I kind of blacked out and I kind of like felt something.

2041
01:47:59,880 --> 01:48:01,920
Did you get inhabited like the sector keeper?

2042
01:48:01,920 --> 01:48:02,920
Yeah.

2043
01:48:02,920 --> 01:48:03,920
I got a rock.

2044
01:48:03,920 --> 01:48:04,920
I got a rock.

2045
01:48:04,920 --> 01:48:07,920
Jason, what are you driving?

2046
01:48:07,920 --> 01:48:13,640
Well, I'm, you know, I all this, all this kind of bummed me out, but there's a, there's

2047
01:48:13,640 --> 01:48:17,000
a bright shining star.

2048
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:22,760
The prophecy was fulfilled at House of Blues, of course, in 2003.

2049
01:48:22,760 --> 01:48:25,280
And Mike, I think maybe you were alluding to this.

2050
01:48:25,280 --> 01:48:26,280
2003?

2051
01:48:26,280 --> 01:48:27,280
2003.

2052
01:48:27,280 --> 01:48:28,680
I don't know if we are going in the same spot here.

2053
01:48:28,680 --> 01:48:31,120
Well, I'm talking about Bruce Willis and the Accelerators.

2054
01:48:31,120 --> 01:48:33,760
No, no, you've missed.

2055
01:48:33,760 --> 01:48:35,560
I will say, I'll tease this.

2056
01:48:35,560 --> 01:48:38,500
You've missed, I think unless you have something else coming up, you've missed another thing

2057
01:48:38,500 --> 01:48:40,800
I'm very excited about, but continue with this Bruce Willis.

2058
01:48:40,800 --> 01:48:41,800
I love this.

2059
01:48:41,800 --> 01:48:42,800
Bruce Willis and the Accelerators.

2060
01:48:42,800 --> 01:48:45,680
This was just the easiest screen grab from Getty Images.

2061
01:48:45,680 --> 01:48:50,640
There's a few more rows of Bruce Willis and the Accelerator shots.

2062
01:48:50,640 --> 01:48:53,160
And Bruce Willis 2003.

2063
01:48:53,160 --> 01:48:55,360
This must be kept for future generations.

2064
01:48:55,360 --> 01:48:57,200
They must know.

2065
01:48:57,200 --> 01:48:58,320
He's got the hat.

2066
01:48:58,320 --> 01:49:00,600
He's got the leather jacket, the sunglasses.

2067
01:49:00,600 --> 01:49:02,320
You know, he's got a mouth organ.

2068
01:49:02,320 --> 01:49:06,720
Well, I've been complaining about appropriation and such, but with Bruce Willis, he's the

2069
01:49:06,720 --> 01:49:07,720
real deal.

2070
01:49:07,720 --> 01:49:08,720
He's the real deal.

2071
01:49:08,720 --> 01:49:09,720
He's the real deal.

2072
01:49:09,720 --> 01:49:10,720
Bruno.

2073
01:49:10,720 --> 01:49:11,720
How do you, how do you spell Accelerators?

2074
01:49:11,720 --> 01:49:13,920
I want to see if we can find the set list here.

2075
01:49:13,920 --> 01:49:15,600
Oh, A-C-C-K-E-L-O-R-A-T-O-R-S.

2076
01:49:15,600 --> 01:49:23,960
You know, they're not archived very well on setlist.fm for whatever reason.

2077
01:49:23,960 --> 01:49:27,120
The setlist just say 35 minutes of bullshit.

2078
01:49:27,120 --> 01:49:30,640
Maybe they're in that Rainforest Cafe playlist I found on Spotify.

2079
01:49:30,640 --> 01:49:32,860
Track one, noodly shit.

2080
01:49:32,860 --> 01:49:34,680
Track two, indulgent shit.

2081
01:49:34,680 --> 01:49:35,680
Track three, fun time.

2082
01:49:35,680 --> 01:49:38,200
His song Fun Time, which is a real song.

2083
01:49:38,200 --> 01:49:44,000
I mean, if we're talking about genre of band, the no homers genre of band, I mean, of course,

2084
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,040
there's definitely the celebrity band.

2085
01:49:46,040 --> 01:49:47,040
Yeah.

2086
01:49:47,040 --> 01:49:50,520
Like I can't go to a karaoke bar, so I made a band.

2087
01:49:50,520 --> 01:49:52,760
Wait, there's a side argument breaking out.

2088
01:49:52,760 --> 01:49:53,760
What's going on?

2089
01:49:53,760 --> 01:49:54,760
No, no, no.

2090
01:49:54,760 --> 01:49:55,760
I'm just trying to see if I can find.

2091
01:49:55,760 --> 01:49:56,760
I'm just trying to get some clarification on Accelerators.

2092
01:49:56,760 --> 01:49:58,360
I just wanted to make sure I was spelling Accelerators right.

2093
01:49:58,360 --> 01:49:59,360
Just a light sidebar.

2094
01:49:59,360 --> 01:50:00,360
Just a light sidebar.

2095
01:50:00,360 --> 01:50:01,360
Yeah, no, no.

2096
01:50:01,360 --> 01:50:02,360
There was no argument.

2097
01:50:02,360 --> 01:50:03,360
I was not yelling at Jason.

2098
01:50:03,360 --> 01:50:04,600
Trying to bring us into one place here.

2099
01:50:04,600 --> 01:50:05,600
Yeah.

2100
01:50:05,600 --> 01:50:06,600
So I'm just trying to, thank you.

2101
01:50:06,600 --> 01:50:07,600
I'm sorry.

2102
01:50:07,600 --> 01:50:11,440
I didn't want to, I'm just desperate to find the setlist for this Bruce Willis concert.

2103
01:50:11,440 --> 01:50:15,840
It's the first time it's like Mighty Akron, something you invented to say.

2104
01:50:15,840 --> 01:50:16,840
Yeah.

2105
01:50:16,840 --> 01:50:19,520
Do you feel proud about Mighty Akron that you coined it?

2106
01:50:19,520 --> 01:50:20,520
Yeah, of course.

2107
01:50:20,520 --> 01:50:21,520
No question there.

2108
01:50:21,520 --> 01:50:22,520
Yeah.

2109
01:50:22,520 --> 01:50:23,520
Oh, I'm sorry.

2110
01:50:23,520 --> 01:50:24,520
It's A-C-C-E-L-E.

2111
01:50:24,520 --> 01:50:27,520
Are there multiple spellings out loud of Accelerators in this episode?

2112
01:50:27,520 --> 01:50:28,520
We've been recording for three hours.

2113
01:50:28,520 --> 01:50:29,520
Is there a number eight in there?

2114
01:50:29,520 --> 01:50:30,520
I can't even find.

2115
01:50:30,520 --> 01:50:40,920
While you're doing that, Mike, let's not ignore, this isn't the Anaheim one, but the LA area's

2116
01:50:40,920 --> 01:50:45,160
biggest House of Blues related event in 2003.

2117
01:50:45,160 --> 01:50:49,920
It's where an actress named Lana Clarkson met the great record producer Phil Spector.

2118
01:50:49,920 --> 01:50:50,920
Oh no, Lana, get out of there.

2119
01:50:50,920 --> 01:50:51,920
Oh, chance.

2120
01:50:51,920 --> 01:50:52,920
Oh no.

2121
01:50:52,920 --> 01:50:53,920
Well, I don't know the rest of the story.

2122
01:50:53,920 --> 01:50:58,640
It says that he took her home to his fabulous Alhambra Castle, and as far as I know, they

2123
01:50:58,640 --> 01:50:59,960
lived happily ever after.

2124
01:50:59,960 --> 01:51:00,960
Oh no.

2125
01:51:00,960 --> 01:51:04,760
I mean, you know, things are going fine if you're going to a castle in Alhambra.

2126
01:51:04,760 --> 01:51:09,040
I know, I was going to say, the distance between that and Sunset Boulevard.

2127
01:51:09,040 --> 01:51:10,600
Mike, did you have something else?

2128
01:51:10,600 --> 01:51:13,120
Did you have another major event that happened at the House of Blues?

2129
01:51:13,120 --> 01:51:18,600
Well, just a little minor one that you and I have had a fascination with it before.

2130
01:51:18,600 --> 01:51:22,280
There's a guy that we both really like.

2131
01:51:22,280 --> 01:51:23,280
His name is Buckethead.

2132
01:51:23,280 --> 01:51:24,280
Oh boy.

2133
01:51:24,280 --> 01:51:25,280
And he, you know Buckethead?

2134
01:51:25,280 --> 01:51:26,280
I think I do.

2135
01:51:26,280 --> 01:51:34,280
By the way, also, I feel like in Guns N' Roses world, there's been several no homers clubs.

2136
01:51:34,280 --> 01:51:35,280
Yes.

2137
01:51:35,280 --> 01:51:36,280
No Axels clubs.

2138
01:51:36,280 --> 01:51:38,880
Yeah, which man has the most no homers clubs?

2139
01:51:38,880 --> 01:51:42,480
I think they may have like caused four or five.

2140
01:51:42,480 --> 01:51:45,600
But Buckethead though, part of Guns N' Roses world.

2141
01:51:45,600 --> 01:51:51,060
Buckethead is a very good guitar player who wears a KFC bucket on his head and has like

2142
01:51:51,060 --> 01:51:54,040
a Jabberwocky mask on.

2143
01:51:54,040 --> 01:51:55,800
We should really call it a Buckethead mask.

2144
01:51:55,800 --> 01:51:57,680
Yes, that's true.

2145
01:51:57,680 --> 01:51:59,560
But he played the House of Blues.

2146
01:51:59,560 --> 01:52:02,440
The whole show is available on YouTube.

2147
01:52:02,440 --> 01:52:06,600
And I believe, and I have to look more into this, but Buckethead is a Parks fan.

2148
01:52:06,600 --> 01:52:07,600
Really?

2149
01:52:07,600 --> 01:52:08,600
What?

2150
01:52:08,600 --> 01:52:09,600
Yeah.

2151
01:52:09,600 --> 01:52:13,200
There's video of Buckethead playing like Haunted Mansion on his guitar, not in Anaheim mind

2152
01:52:13,200 --> 01:52:14,200
you.

2153
01:52:14,200 --> 01:52:19,880
And then he does a whole, he does a Disney medley at the end of his set in the Anaheim

2154
01:52:19,880 --> 01:52:20,880
House of Blues.

2155
01:52:20,880 --> 01:52:23,600
So I think Buckethead potentially future guest on the show.

2156
01:52:23,600 --> 01:52:25,800
Oh, I hope so.

2157
01:52:25,800 --> 01:52:31,800
So yes, I remember, I think the performance we were watching many years ago on my TV when

2158
01:52:31,800 --> 01:52:35,560
Lindsay probably had fallen asleep was Buckethead at the House of Blues.

2159
01:52:35,560 --> 01:52:36,560
We should have gone to see him.

2160
01:52:36,560 --> 01:52:37,560
We screwed up.

2161
01:52:37,560 --> 01:52:42,560
You guys stayed up and watched Buckethead videos and then Lindsay had gone to bed.

2162
01:52:42,560 --> 01:52:45,560
Yeah, I mean, maybe she was up, but I mean, she was probably checked out.

2163
01:52:45,560 --> 01:52:46,560
She wasn't mentally up.

2164
01:52:46,560 --> 01:52:47,560
Yeah.

2165
01:52:47,560 --> 01:52:50,560
You got to be able to hang if you're going to.

2166
01:52:50,560 --> 01:52:51,560
Right, right, I get it.

2167
01:52:51,560 --> 01:52:52,560
With the Buckethead boys.

2168
01:52:52,560 --> 01:52:53,560
With the boys, yeah.

2169
01:52:53,560 --> 01:52:54,560
Yeah, I got it.

2170
01:52:54,560 --> 01:52:55,560
It's just a boys club.

2171
01:52:55,560 --> 01:52:56,560
We stay up and watch Buckethead.

2172
01:52:56,560 --> 01:52:58,560
Yeah, no, I've been trying to get in, but you guys keep pushing me out.

2173
01:52:58,560 --> 01:52:59,560
But I'll keep going.

2174
01:52:59,560 --> 01:53:00,560
What's your favorite Buckethead song?

2175
01:53:00,560 --> 01:53:01,560
No, I got to go.

2176
01:53:01,560 --> 01:53:09,560
The famous Hollywood Boys Club is about like, you got to love Bruno and you got to love Buckethead.

2177
01:53:09,560 --> 01:53:11,560
And the Blues Bros.

2178
01:53:11,560 --> 01:53:12,560
Damn.

2179
01:53:12,560 --> 01:53:13,560
Blues Bros and Brunos.

2180
01:53:13,560 --> 01:53:16,560
I don't know what you need to say, Bruno.

2181
01:53:16,560 --> 01:53:19,560
I think you just invented a new t-shirt for podcast the ride.

2182
01:53:19,560 --> 01:53:22,560
With a harmonica and Blues Brothers sunglasses.

2183
01:53:22,560 --> 01:53:26,560
That's like the perfect deep cut that even people that think they like the podcast wouldn't

2184
01:53:26,560 --> 01:53:27,560
know.

2185
01:53:27,560 --> 01:53:29,560
They had to wade through this entire thing to get to it.

2186
01:53:29,560 --> 01:53:33,560
There's a credit thread like, at minute two hours and forty seven.

2187
01:53:33,560 --> 01:53:35,560
I think that's where we're at.

2188
01:53:35,560 --> 01:53:38,560
We have to, we also, we haven't, we got to find the sector.

2189
01:53:38,560 --> 01:53:39,560
Oh yeah, I forgot.

2190
01:53:39,560 --> 01:53:40,560
Oh yeah, I know.

2191
01:53:40,560 --> 01:53:41,560
What else do you have?

2192
01:53:41,560 --> 01:53:44,560
I just found newer Bruce Willis set lists.

2193
01:53:44,560 --> 01:53:46,560
What is it jamming to now?

2194
01:53:46,560 --> 01:53:49,560
Bruce, oh wait a minute, no, this isn't it.

2195
01:53:49,560 --> 01:53:50,560
Oh shit.

2196
01:53:50,560 --> 01:53:51,560
We have to go.

2197
01:53:51,560 --> 01:53:52,560
Just share what you found.

2198
01:53:52,560 --> 01:53:59,560
I just, it just says that he's played Fun Time in the two, it's only three concerts listed

2199
01:53:59,560 --> 01:54:01,560
on here and he's played them in every one.

2200
01:54:01,560 --> 01:54:02,560
He's played the song Fun Time.

2201
01:54:02,560 --> 01:54:05,560
If you don't know Fun Time, it's one of his best songs.

2202
01:54:05,560 --> 01:54:06,560
It's from the return of Bruno.

2203
01:54:06,560 --> 01:54:09,560
But these, this honestly, there's got to be an archive where you can find.

2204
01:54:09,560 --> 01:54:12,560
Sorry, I didn't mean to give everyone's hopes up that I found this.

2205
01:54:12,560 --> 01:54:13,560
Let's, we'll.

2206
01:54:13,560 --> 01:54:15,560
We'll suss it out on Twitter.

2207
01:54:15,560 --> 01:54:16,560
Yeah, yeah.

2208
01:54:16,560 --> 01:54:17,560
Yeah.

2209
01:54:17,560 --> 01:54:18,560
Okay.

2210
01:54:18,560 --> 01:54:25,560
Anyway, we need to, I hope that the Sector Keeper will grant us, grant at least you who

2211
01:54:25,560 --> 01:54:29,560
are not, you aren't responsible for finding the Level Keeper like we are.

2212
01:54:29,560 --> 01:54:30,560
Yeah.

2213
01:54:30,560 --> 01:54:34,560
You should be given passage back up to the surface.

2214
01:54:34,560 --> 01:54:35,560
Right.

2215
01:54:35,560 --> 01:54:40,560
And so with that, Julia Prescott, you survived Podcast The Ride.

2216
01:54:40,560 --> 01:54:41,560
Oh my God.

2217
01:54:41,560 --> 01:54:42,560
So glad we bumped into you down here.

2218
01:54:42,560 --> 01:54:43,560
Could have been real lonely.

2219
01:54:43,560 --> 01:54:45,560
And we never would have known about the Rainforest Cafe store.

2220
01:54:45,560 --> 01:54:46,560
Right.

2221
01:54:46,560 --> 01:54:48,560
And we wouldn't have been blind on that without a former Pathfinder.

2222
01:54:48,560 --> 01:54:49,560
It's a treasure trove to behold.

2223
01:54:49,560 --> 01:54:50,560
That was at Pathfinder, right?

2224
01:54:50,560 --> 01:54:51,560
I was at Pathfinder, yes.

2225
01:54:51,560 --> 01:54:52,560
You were our Pathfinder today.

2226
01:54:52,560 --> 01:54:53,560
Oh my God.

2227
01:54:53,560 --> 01:55:00,560
And I don't think we could have gotten back to the end of the path if we have without you.

2228
01:55:00,560 --> 01:55:04,560
Let's exit through the Rainforest Cafe gift shop.

2229
01:55:04,560 --> 01:55:07,560
Is there anything you'd like to plug?

2230
01:55:07,560 --> 01:55:09,560
Nothing particularly.

2231
01:55:09,560 --> 01:55:12,560
My Simpsons podcast around Springfield.

2232
01:55:12,560 --> 01:55:16,560
We did like a restructuring of the concept.

2233
01:55:16,560 --> 01:55:20,560
So it used to be called Everything's Coming Up Simpsons where we'd interview folks about

2234
01:55:20,560 --> 01:55:21,560
their favorite Simpsons episode.

2235
01:55:21,560 --> 01:55:28,560
And now we're doing a 20 episode season starting in January of 2020 where we interview Simpsons

2236
01:55:28,560 --> 01:55:32,560
writers and voiceover actors about non-Simpsons things that they've done.

2237
01:55:32,560 --> 01:55:33,560
So David X.

2238
01:55:33,560 --> 01:55:38,560
Cohen talking about Futurama, Tim Long talking about a movie that he just wrote and got

2239
01:55:38,560 --> 01:55:44,560
produced based on something he experienced in his life and talking to Al Jean about Teen

2240
01:55:44,560 --> 01:55:48,560
Angel, things that they've done like failed pilots.

2241
01:55:48,560 --> 01:55:50,560
Matt Selman punched up the Minions movies.

2242
01:55:50,560 --> 01:55:52,560
Want to talk to him about that.

2243
01:55:52,560 --> 01:55:55,560
So yeah, that's our new podcast.

2244
01:55:55,560 --> 01:55:57,560
It's going to be on the Maximum Fun Network.

2245
01:55:57,560 --> 01:55:59,560
And those are coming out 20 days in a row, right?

2246
01:55:59,560 --> 01:56:01,560
20 days in a row.

2247
01:56:01,560 --> 01:56:05,560
We're just banking them and then walking away from the flames.

2248
01:56:05,560 --> 01:56:06,560
Hissing them out.

2249
01:56:06,560 --> 01:56:12,560
Yeah. And then I guess you could watch my Simpsons episode in October 2020.

2250
01:56:12,560 --> 01:56:13,560
Yeah.

2251
01:56:13,560 --> 01:56:18,560
It's a tree house of horror unless that wasn't covered, which is very exciting.

2252
01:56:18,560 --> 01:56:20,560
And then you can find me.

2253
01:56:20,560 --> 01:56:21,560
Yeah, that's moving.

2254
01:56:21,560 --> 01:56:22,560
Yeah.

2255
01:56:22,560 --> 01:56:25,560
Yeah. It's like the coolest thing stacked on top of the coolest thing.

2256
01:56:25,560 --> 01:56:28,560
You can find me at Julia Prescott on all Twitter and Instagram stuff.

2257
01:56:28,560 --> 01:56:33,560
And I am usually very positive on both social media channels.

2258
01:56:33,560 --> 01:56:36,560
Not one of those snarky comedy folks.

2259
01:56:36,560 --> 01:56:40,560
Celebrating a loss of a job and going to the greatest, happiest place on earth.

2260
01:56:40,560 --> 01:56:48,560
I will also say for those curious, that me going viral for not getting a job did not get me a job.

2261
01:56:48,560 --> 01:56:49,560
There was no that.

2262
01:56:49,560 --> 01:56:54,560
Literally no one reached out and was like, so I hear nothing happened from it.

2263
01:56:54,560 --> 01:56:55,560
Of course not.

2264
01:56:55,560 --> 01:56:56,560
But of course not. Yeah.

2265
01:56:56,560 --> 01:57:00,560
But if you tweet about being the pathfinder and helping some people out of it.

2266
01:57:00,560 --> 01:57:01,560
You're right.

2267
01:57:01,560 --> 01:57:03,560
Helping people out of a dark, grim underworld.

2268
01:57:03,560 --> 01:57:06,560
That's got to be good for some old photos from that era.

2269
01:57:06,560 --> 01:57:07,560
Maybe I'll post.

2270
01:57:07,560 --> 01:57:09,560
Oh, please send them to us if you got them.

2271
01:57:09,560 --> 01:57:10,560
OK, so we will.

2272
01:57:10,560 --> 01:57:15,560
Julia, tread carefully as you exit the underworld because you never know where or when a paddle is coming.

2273
01:57:15,560 --> 01:57:19,560
Oh, boy.

2274
01:57:19,560 --> 01:57:20,560
Thank you.

2275
01:57:20,560 --> 01:57:22,560
Just some advice from a very successful friend of mine.

2276
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:23,560
Wait a minute.

2277
01:57:23,560 --> 01:57:24,560
Kind of a mentor.

2278
01:57:24,560 --> 01:57:25,560
I see a paddle coming right now.

2279
01:57:25,560 --> 01:57:26,560
Maybe you can jump.

2280
01:57:26,560 --> 01:57:28,560
No, no, I think it might be a good paddle.

2281
01:57:28,560 --> 01:57:31,560
Maybe you can jump off of it and it can propel you back up to the surface.

2282
01:57:31,560 --> 01:57:32,560
I'm going to try.

2283
01:57:32,560 --> 01:57:33,560
Here it is.

2284
01:57:33,560 --> 01:57:34,560
Go.

2285
01:57:34,560 --> 01:57:35,560
I did it.

2286
01:57:35,560 --> 01:57:36,560
Wow.

2287
01:57:36,560 --> 01:57:37,560
Wow.

2288
01:57:37,560 --> 01:57:38,560
And there she goes.

2289
01:57:38,560 --> 01:57:39,560
Bye, Julia.

2290
01:57:39,560 --> 01:57:40,560
Bye.

2291
01:57:40,560 --> 01:57:41,560
May your spirit ascend.

2292
01:57:41,560 --> 01:57:46,560
And now let's get another spirit in here and find out how the hell we get out of here.

2293
01:57:46,560 --> 01:57:49,560
Oh, great sector keeper, come to us.

2294
01:57:49,560 --> 01:57:51,560
Boys, boys, you did it.

2295
01:57:51,560 --> 01:57:52,560
You gave me strength.

2296
01:57:52,560 --> 01:57:54,560
You give me great strength.

2297
01:57:54,560 --> 01:57:55,560
Good.

2298
01:57:55,560 --> 01:57:59,560
I'm glad because we are dying to get out of this underworld.

2299
01:57:59,560 --> 01:58:00,560
Boys, you're so close.

2300
01:58:00,560 --> 01:58:04,560
I just received a text message from my cousin, the level keeper.

2301
01:58:04,560 --> 01:58:05,560
Good.

2302
01:58:05,560 --> 01:58:09,560
He only had one text left today on his cricket wireless prepaid phone.

2303
01:58:09,560 --> 01:58:10,560
Oh, right.

2304
01:58:10,560 --> 01:58:11,560
God, it really gets down there.

2305
01:58:11,560 --> 01:58:12,560
You get like four a day.

2306
01:58:12,560 --> 01:58:13,560
Yeah.

2307
01:58:13,560 --> 01:58:14,560
Yeah, barely.

2308
01:58:14,560 --> 01:58:15,560
Yes.

2309
01:58:15,560 --> 01:58:16,560
Yes.

2310
01:58:16,560 --> 01:58:17,560
But boys, you're doing so well.

2311
01:58:17,560 --> 01:58:19,560
I just want to give this to you because I sense a presence.

2312
01:58:19,560 --> 01:58:20,560
Oh, OK.

2313
01:58:20,560 --> 01:58:21,560
Oh, we need our weapon now.

2314
01:58:21,560 --> 01:58:22,560
Yes, you're right.

2315
01:58:22,560 --> 01:58:26,560
Oh, without further ado, boys, here it is, a business paddle.

2316
01:58:26,560 --> 01:58:31,560
Oh, yes, because you never know where or when a paddle is coming from your ass.

2317
01:58:31,560 --> 01:58:32,560
For your ass.

2318
01:58:32,560 --> 01:58:33,560
Huh?

2319
01:58:33,560 --> 01:58:34,560
For.

2320
01:58:34,560 --> 01:58:35,560
You said what?

2321
01:58:35,560 --> 01:58:36,560
You never know when a paddle is coming from your ass.

2322
01:58:36,560 --> 01:58:37,560
Oh, I got to read the book again.

2323
01:58:37,560 --> 01:58:38,560
I didn't learn enough.

2324
01:58:38,560 --> 01:58:39,560
That would be like a paddle.

2325
01:58:39,560 --> 01:58:42,560
You didn't do the listen part of shut up and listen.

2326
01:58:42,560 --> 01:58:43,560
I forgot to listen.

2327
01:58:43,560 --> 01:58:45,560
A paddle coming out of your ass.

2328
01:58:45,560 --> 01:58:50,560
Now that I'm also like, I'm glad we I'm glad you gave us a weapon now because there's so

2329
01:58:50,560 --> 01:58:53,560
many people who could be bosses here.

2330
01:58:53,560 --> 01:58:54,560
There was Tillman.

2331
01:58:54,560 --> 01:58:55,560
There was Tillman for Tida.

2332
01:58:55,560 --> 01:58:56,560
There was Tida.

2333
01:58:56,560 --> 01:58:57,560
Tida.

2334
01:58:57,560 --> 01:58:58,560
We never figured it out.

2335
01:58:58,560 --> 01:59:04,560
There was there was Isaac Tigrett of House of Blues fame.

2336
01:59:04,560 --> 01:59:05,560
I don't know who there's so many.

2337
01:59:05,560 --> 01:59:07,560
There's so many candidates.

2338
01:59:07,560 --> 01:59:09,560
I don't know who we're going to be facing here.

2339
01:59:09,560 --> 01:59:10,560
Boys.

2340
01:59:10,560 --> 01:59:11,560
Oh, it's happening.

2341
01:59:11,560 --> 01:59:12,560
Oh my God.

2342
01:59:12,560 --> 01:59:13,560
He's changing.

2343
01:59:13,560 --> 01:59:20,560
Oh, what?

2344
01:59:20,560 --> 01:59:27,560
What is this along?

2345
01:59:27,560 --> 01:59:29,560
I know this.

2346
01:59:29,560 --> 01:59:30,560
I know.

2347
01:59:30,560 --> 01:59:31,560
No.

2348
01:59:31,560 --> 01:59:32,560
Oh my God.

2349
01:59:32,560 --> 01:59:34,560
This sounds like non comedic music to me.

2350
01:59:34,560 --> 01:59:36,560
That's right, boys.

2351
01:59:36,560 --> 01:59:37,560
It's me.

2352
01:59:37,560 --> 01:59:38,560
Dan Aykroyd.

2353
01:59:38,560 --> 01:59:39,560
Oh my God.

2354
01:59:39,560 --> 01:59:45,560
Dan Aykroyd in the underworld has taken over the keepers.

2355
01:59:45,560 --> 01:59:46,560
I am from France.

2356
01:59:46,560 --> 01:59:49,560
He's doing all his famous lines.

2357
01:59:49,560 --> 01:59:51,560
The non blues related lines.

2358
01:59:51,560 --> 01:59:56,560
Oh, no, he's got his he's got his harmonica.

2359
01:59:56,560 --> 01:59:57,560
Jesus.

2360
01:59:57,560 --> 02:00:00,560
Look, we're trying to look.

2361
02:00:00,560 --> 02:00:01,560
I know.

2362
02:00:01,560 --> 02:00:03,560
I know you're a villain here to, you know, get in our way.

2363
02:00:03,560 --> 02:00:05,560
But also it's an audio medium.

2364
02:00:05,560 --> 02:00:09,560
Could you just like not play that thing constantly if that's possible?

2365
02:00:09,560 --> 02:00:11,560
I can't I can't help it, boys.

2366
02:00:11,560 --> 02:00:13,560
It's hard scrambled time.

2367
02:00:13,560 --> 02:00:15,560
Hard scrambled time.

2368
02:00:15,560 --> 02:00:17,560
You're not actually an old blues man.

2369
02:00:17,560 --> 02:00:19,560
I know you wish you were.

2370
02:00:19,560 --> 02:00:20,560
But I mean, you don't wish you were.

2371
02:00:20,560 --> 02:00:21,560
But you kind of pretend you wish you were.

2372
02:00:21,560 --> 02:00:23,560
Yeah, you're some white guy.

2373
02:00:23,560 --> 02:00:25,560
Elroy hit it.

2374
02:00:25,560 --> 02:00:26,560
Elroy.

2375
02:00:26,560 --> 02:00:28,560
He doesn't even remember his own shit.

2376
02:00:28,560 --> 02:00:29,560
Well, he's in the underworld.

2377
02:00:29,560 --> 02:00:30,560
He's being possessed.

2378
02:00:30,560 --> 02:00:32,560
Like he's possessing a ghost.

2379
02:00:32,560 --> 02:00:35,560
So he's probably getting like sort of the wires crossed.

2380
02:00:35,560 --> 02:00:38,560
I think he's thinking of well, the Jetson.

2381
02:00:38,560 --> 02:00:40,560
No, I think he's thinking of Elwood.

2382
02:00:40,560 --> 02:00:41,560
Yeah.

2383
02:00:41,560 --> 02:00:44,560
He's all scram.

2384
02:00:44,560 --> 02:00:47,560
He's so discombobulated.

2385
02:00:47,560 --> 02:00:49,560
Oh, wait, he's dancing again.

2386
02:00:49,560 --> 02:00:52,560
Boy, and that's dancing.

2387
02:00:52,560 --> 02:00:54,560
I am from France.

2388
02:00:54,560 --> 02:00:56,560
He's doing the clone headline.

2389
02:00:56,560 --> 02:01:01,560
It's like he's I feel like we can maybe get rid of this guy easily because I think he's dying already.

2390
02:01:01,560 --> 02:01:04,560
I think all of his memories are flashing through his brain.

2391
02:01:04,560 --> 02:01:07,560
He's got some good crystal head vodka.

2392
02:01:07,560 --> 02:01:09,560
OK, drinking his own vodka.

2393
02:01:09,560 --> 02:01:10,560
Drinking vodka.

2394
02:01:10,560 --> 02:01:12,560
All of the crystal head.

2395
02:01:12,560 --> 02:01:13,560
It's hard scramble time.

2396
02:01:13,560 --> 02:01:15,560
He's filtering it because he loves the filter.

2397
02:01:15,560 --> 02:01:17,560
He's filtering it through the harmonica.

2398
02:01:17,560 --> 02:01:18,560
That's right.

2399
02:01:18,560 --> 02:01:20,560
You're sucking it up straight out of the bottle.

2400
02:01:20,560 --> 02:01:23,560
I'm drunk.

2401
02:01:23,560 --> 02:01:25,560
OK, so wait.

2402
02:01:25,560 --> 02:01:28,560
You know why I love the blues?

2403
02:01:28,560 --> 02:01:29,560
Why is that?

2404
02:01:29,560 --> 02:01:31,560
Why Dan?

2405
02:01:31,560 --> 02:01:32,560
Lead belly.

2406
02:01:32,560 --> 02:01:34,560
Robert Johnson.

2407
02:01:34,560 --> 02:01:35,560
It's not an answer.

2408
02:01:35,560 --> 02:01:36,560
Howling wolf.

2409
02:01:36,560 --> 02:01:38,560
You're just saying the names of people.

2410
02:01:38,560 --> 02:01:39,560
This is co-op.

2411
02:01:39,560 --> 02:01:42,560
This is what you and your crooked partner, Isaac Tigrit, do.

2412
02:01:42,560 --> 02:01:46,560
You're taking your your your your stealing bits of culture.

2413
02:01:46,560 --> 02:01:47,560
And I am from France.

2414
02:01:47,560 --> 02:01:49,560
Nanu Nanu.

2415
02:01:49,560 --> 02:01:50,560
You're doing it again.

2416
02:01:50,560 --> 02:01:53,560
That is not not one of your properties.

2417
02:01:53,560 --> 02:01:59,560
You have a steel and shit you thought of your own alien thing, you don't need to think of another one.

2418
02:01:59,560 --> 02:02:00,560
That's stealing.

2419
02:02:00,560 --> 02:02:06,560
You boys come down here and yet you act like a little ghost friends going to push me around.

2420
02:02:06,560 --> 02:02:09,560
I ain't afraid to know ghosts.

2421
02:02:09,560 --> 02:02:13,560
Another line from one of the.

2422
02:02:13,560 --> 02:02:20,560
I think this guy sold his soul at the crossroads via comedy star because he makes me laugh.

2423
02:02:20,560 --> 02:02:21,560
I got to give him that.

2424
02:02:21,560 --> 02:02:22,560
All right.

2425
02:02:22,560 --> 02:02:24,560
Well, yeah, look, we all he makes all of us laugh.

2426
02:02:24,560 --> 02:02:25,560
Sure.

2427
02:02:25,560 --> 02:02:28,560
Of course, we've all enjoyed things about it, but I don't like this version.

2428
02:02:28,560 --> 02:02:31,560
I make you move.

2429
02:02:31,560 --> 02:02:34,560
I mean, he's a pro on that mouth organ, too.

2430
02:02:34,560 --> 02:02:36,560
Yeah, that's a mouth organ.

2431
02:02:36,560 --> 02:02:37,560
You could call it.

2432
02:02:37,560 --> 02:02:38,560
You planted that in his head.

2433
02:02:38,560 --> 02:02:40,560
He's never going to quit with a mouth organ.

2434
02:02:40,560 --> 02:02:43,560
That that's a sketch.

2435
02:02:43,560 --> 02:02:46,560
Oh, you're still thinking of sketches, I guess.

2436
02:02:46,560 --> 02:02:47,560
From all days.

2437
02:02:47,560 --> 02:02:50,560
Lauren's a mensch.

2438
02:02:50,560 --> 02:02:56,560
Lauren, Lauren made me wait four and a half hours before he'd say hello to me.

2439
02:02:56,560 --> 02:02:58,560
What a guy.

2440
02:02:58,560 --> 02:03:00,560
What I don't even understand that.

2441
02:03:00,560 --> 02:03:03,560
Sometimes I've heard stories where like Lauren makes you wait in like a lobby.

2442
02:03:03,560 --> 02:03:05,560
Sometimes I think it's a power move.

2443
02:03:05,560 --> 02:03:11,560
I guess we've heard these these guys have all told these stories a thousand times.

2444
02:03:11,560 --> 02:03:12,560
We don't need it.

2445
02:03:12,560 --> 02:03:13,560
We're on a quest.

2446
02:03:13,560 --> 02:03:16,560
We're on a we're on our own mission from God.

2447
02:03:16,560 --> 02:03:19,560
OK, we're on a mission from a higher power than God.

2448
02:03:19,560 --> 02:03:20,560
The Sector Keeper.

2449
02:03:20,560 --> 02:03:22,560
And we have a cousin to rescue.

2450
02:03:22,560 --> 02:03:24,560
We need to step out of our way.

2451
02:03:24,560 --> 02:03:26,560
Let's start getting those weapons ready.

2452
02:03:26,560 --> 02:03:29,560
We need to defeat you, Dan Aykroyd.

2453
02:03:29,560 --> 02:03:32,560
We've got an open container of skull.

2454
02:03:32,560 --> 02:03:33,560
OK.

2455
02:03:33,560 --> 02:03:34,560
Oh, his eyes lit up.

2456
02:03:34,560 --> 02:03:35,560
You want some dip, brother?

2457
02:03:35,560 --> 02:03:36,560
He might like that.

2458
02:03:36,560 --> 02:03:38,560
That might be something he wants.

2459
02:03:38,560 --> 02:03:41,560
Takes me back to the times when I was staying up till 6 a.m.

2460
02:03:41,560 --> 02:03:43,560
writing sketches with Chevy.

2461
02:03:43,560 --> 02:03:44,560
That's right.

2462
02:03:44,560 --> 02:03:46,560
He wrote Basamatic High on Skull.

2463
02:03:46,560 --> 02:03:48,560
That's not going to do us any good.

2464
02:03:48,560 --> 02:03:50,560
He's got a hand right into his hands.

2465
02:03:50,560 --> 02:03:52,560
Miss with the cranks.

2466
02:03:52,560 --> 02:03:54,560
What gave him the idea of Christmas with the Cranks?

2467
02:03:54,560 --> 02:03:56,560
The movie he wrote and directed.

2468
02:03:56,560 --> 02:03:58,560
Well, I mean, I just kind of want to get rid of this one.

2469
02:03:58,560 --> 02:04:02,560
It's a thin mint cookie bear filled with organ meat.

2470
02:04:02,560 --> 02:04:03,560
Mm hmm.

2471
02:04:03,560 --> 02:04:04,560
Mouth organ.

2472
02:04:04,560 --> 02:04:05,560
Sure.

2473
02:04:05,560 --> 02:04:06,560
Yeah. Yeah.

2474
02:04:06,560 --> 02:04:08,560
Root around in that for a little while.

2475
02:04:08,560 --> 02:04:10,560
Like playing around.

2476
02:04:10,560 --> 02:04:13,560
Oh, oh.

2477
02:04:13,560 --> 02:04:16,560
Oh, oh, oh.

2478
02:04:16,560 --> 02:04:18,560
I'm choking on my harmonica.

2479
02:04:18,560 --> 02:04:20,560
I am from France.

2480
02:04:20,560 --> 02:04:21,560
He's choking.

2481
02:04:21,560 --> 02:04:23,560
He's already full of Chicago sausages.

2482
02:04:23,560 --> 02:04:25,560
This is probably going to add to it.

2483
02:04:25,560 --> 02:04:26,560
Those are out there.

2484
02:04:26,560 --> 02:04:27,560
The Bears.

2485
02:04:27,560 --> 02:04:29,560
No, no, no.

2486
02:04:29,560 --> 02:04:31,560
He wasn't in a bears was he?

2487
02:04:31,560 --> 02:04:32,560
I know.

2488
02:04:32,560 --> 02:04:33,560
I think so.

2489
02:04:33,560 --> 02:04:34,560
Yeah, it's all.

2490
02:04:34,560 --> 02:04:36,560
George went.

2491
02:04:36,560 --> 02:04:38,560
Mike Myers Farley.

2492
02:04:38,560 --> 02:04:40,560
But this is I think though.

2493
02:04:40,560 --> 02:04:41,560
Jordan to Pippen.

2494
02:04:41,560 --> 02:04:43,560
Jordan to Pippen.

2495
02:04:43,560 --> 02:04:46,560
I think we're making him die here.

2496
02:04:46,560 --> 02:04:47,560
I think I know what to do.

2497
02:04:47,560 --> 02:04:49,560
Look, he's he's tipping over.

2498
02:04:49,560 --> 02:04:52,560
I think he like he's he's just tipping around on that one week.

2499
02:04:52,560 --> 02:04:55,560
See, I think I know what to do to blow him over.

2500
02:04:55,560 --> 02:04:59,560
Remember the last before we came down here, we got an instrument.

2501
02:04:59,560 --> 02:05:02,560
Oh, a Treme certified trombone.

2502
02:05:02,560 --> 02:05:05,560
Right. A New Orleans style and Chicago peep.

2503
02:05:05,560 --> 02:05:07,560
Chicagoans hate New Orleansians.

2504
02:05:07,560 --> 02:05:09,560
I found a rivalry.

2505
02:05:09,560 --> 02:05:11,560
I founded jazz.

2506
02:05:11,560 --> 02:05:16,560
You found jazz like you founded it like it was an institution.

2507
02:05:16,560 --> 02:05:18,560
I guess it is an institution.

2508
02:05:18,560 --> 02:05:20,560
Let's get that here.

2509
02:05:20,560 --> 02:05:23,560
I hear you toss me that Treme certified trombone.

2510
02:05:23,560 --> 02:05:28,560
I'm going to use the power of real New Orleans jazz to defeat your bullshit.

2511
02:05:28,560 --> 02:05:32,560
Fake Chicago by way of Canada.

2512
02:05:32,560 --> 02:05:33,560
Fake blues.

2513
02:05:33,560 --> 02:05:34,560
Here we go.

2514
02:05:34,560 --> 02:05:45,560
Yeah, get him.

2515
02:05:45,560 --> 02:05:48,560
Whoa, a stream is coming out of the trombone.

2516
02:05:48,560 --> 02:05:51,560
It's like a stream from a proton pack.

2517
02:05:51,560 --> 02:05:57,560
The paddles opening up like a trap.

2518
02:05:57,560 --> 02:06:00,560
I am from France.

2519
02:06:00,560 --> 02:06:09,560
It's going right for his bottom because you never know where or when a paddle is coming for your ass.

2520
02:06:09,560 --> 02:06:11,560
There it is.

2521
02:06:11,560 --> 02:06:13,560
The death blow.

2522
02:06:13,560 --> 02:06:17,560
Boys, boys, boys, you give me strength.

2523
02:06:17,560 --> 02:06:18,560
He's back.

2524
02:06:18,560 --> 02:06:26,560
Hey, I'm sorry we had to paddle your ass just now, but I guess it's better than when I beat the shit out of your skull in one of those earlier ones.

2525
02:06:26,560 --> 02:06:31,560
Oh, Scott, I'd rather you beat me than me be stuck in that man for another second.

2526
02:06:31,560 --> 02:06:32,560
Yeah, I'm sorry.

2527
02:06:32,560 --> 02:06:36,560
You had to like dance around in this sort of like white guy bluesy way.

2528
02:06:36,560 --> 02:06:38,560
That was that must have been humiliating for you.

2529
02:06:38,560 --> 02:06:40,560
It was so bizarre.

2530
02:06:40,560 --> 02:06:42,560
His mind was my mind.

2531
02:06:42,560 --> 02:06:47,560
And he kept thinking the Blues Brothers was funny.

2532
02:06:47,560 --> 02:06:48,560
Huh?

2533
02:06:48,560 --> 02:06:49,560
He truly is mentally poisoned.

2534
02:06:49,560 --> 02:06:50,560
Yes.

2535
02:06:50,560 --> 02:06:51,560
Is there anything?

2536
02:06:51,560 --> 02:06:52,560
Let me ask you this.

2537
02:06:52,560 --> 02:06:54,560
When you're being possessed, is there anything like that was actually fun?

2538
02:06:54,560 --> 02:07:00,560
Maybe like, did you actually kind of enjoy maybe like dancing to how and wolf?

2539
02:07:00,560 --> 02:07:02,560
Do you have an appreciation for how and wolf now?

2540
02:07:02,560 --> 02:07:05,560
I guess I do a little bit.

2541
02:07:05,560 --> 02:07:13,560
I mean, I as I was kind of going through the motions, I kind of realized maybe he didn't even really know what he was doing.

2542
02:07:13,560 --> 02:07:14,560
Okay.

2543
02:07:14,560 --> 02:07:16,560
So maybe he was just saying things.

2544
02:07:16,560 --> 02:07:17,560
Yeah.

2545
02:07:17,560 --> 02:07:18,560
It didn't feel like there's a lot behind it.

2546
02:07:18,560 --> 02:07:19,560
Yeah.

2547
02:07:19,560 --> 02:07:23,560
It's almost as if he didn't really know much about himself.

2548
02:07:23,560 --> 02:07:24,560
Huh?

2549
02:07:24,560 --> 02:07:31,560
Like he was just like taking the, he only had four remaining things he could remember about himself and then he just added other people's memories.

2550
02:07:31,560 --> 02:07:33,560
Boys, promise me that won't happen to you.

2551
02:07:33,560 --> 02:07:34,560
Yeah.

2552
02:07:34,560 --> 02:07:35,560
Yeah.

2553
02:07:35,560 --> 02:07:36,560
Oh yeah.

2554
02:07:36,560 --> 02:07:37,560
No, we will.

2555
02:07:37,560 --> 02:07:38,560
We all know who we are.

2556
02:07:38,560 --> 02:07:39,560
Yeah.

2557
02:07:39,560 --> 02:07:40,560
We'll know a few more things about ourselves.

2558
02:07:40,560 --> 02:07:41,560
Yeah.

2559
02:07:41,560 --> 02:07:47,560
And we will not sully our older, better franchise by in 20 years making podcast The Ride 2000.

2560
02:07:47,560 --> 02:07:48,560
Thank you, boys.

2561
02:07:48,560 --> 02:07:49,560
Thank you.

2562
02:07:49,560 --> 02:07:50,560
Yes.

2563
02:07:50,560 --> 02:07:51,560
That gives me strength.

2564
02:07:51,560 --> 02:07:58,560
That gives me so sad boys, if I found out you were doing something for the wrong reasons.

2565
02:07:58,560 --> 02:07:59,560
Yeah.

2566
02:07:59,560 --> 02:08:04,280
Well, I'm glad that you believe in artistic purity and I feel like that you understand

2567
02:08:04,280 --> 02:08:09,560
the true meaning of the blues that Akroyd and Isaac Tigrett lost sight of.

2568
02:08:09,560 --> 02:08:15,560
I think, yeah, I think, I think, boys, I think I see some light.

2569
02:08:15,560 --> 02:08:16,560
Boys.

2570
02:08:16,560 --> 02:08:18,560
Are we finally getting out of this place?

2571
02:08:18,560 --> 02:08:19,560
Boys, boys.

2572
02:08:19,560 --> 02:08:21,560
And I have reception.

2573
02:08:21,560 --> 02:08:24,560
I've received a text from my cousin, the level keeper.

2574
02:08:24,560 --> 02:08:25,560
We have reception.

2575
02:08:25,560 --> 02:08:26,560
Finally.

2576
02:08:26,560 --> 02:08:27,560
Yes.

2577
02:08:27,560 --> 02:08:28,560
Yes.

2578
02:08:28,560 --> 02:08:32,560
He says that through his cricket wireless prepaid phone that you've escaped the underworld,

2579
02:08:32,560 --> 02:08:33,560
boys.

2580
02:08:33,560 --> 02:08:34,560
Wow.

2581
02:08:34,560 --> 02:08:35,560
We're free to go.

2582
02:08:35,560 --> 02:08:36,560
Yes.

2583
02:08:36,560 --> 02:08:37,560
Yes.

2584
02:08:37,560 --> 02:08:38,560
Back on the we're leaving the paywall behind.

2585
02:08:38,560 --> 02:08:42,560
We're leaving the paywall behind and go watch your eyes, boys.

2586
02:08:42,560 --> 02:08:44,560
Well, Mr. Akroyd is here.

2587
02:08:44,560 --> 02:08:46,560
I got you something to protect him.

2588
02:08:46,560 --> 02:08:49,560
Why don't you put on these shades as you reenter downtown Disney?

2589
02:08:49,560 --> 02:08:50,560
Whoa.

2590
02:08:50,560 --> 02:08:51,560
I guess so.

2591
02:08:51,560 --> 02:08:56,560
As long as these aren't going to turn us into into a blues brother or nothing.

2592
02:08:56,560 --> 02:08:57,560
He's dead now.

2593
02:08:57,560 --> 02:08:58,560
Who cares?

2594
02:08:58,560 --> 02:08:59,560
All right.

2595
02:08:59,560 --> 02:09:02,560
Well, boys, let's hightail it out of here.

2596
02:09:02,560 --> 02:09:03,560
All right.

2597
02:09:03,560 --> 02:09:04,560
I think that's a good idea.

2598
02:09:04,560 --> 02:09:07,560
Hey, you sound a lot more like him.

2599
02:09:07,560 --> 02:09:11,560
We all sound more like him than he sounded like himself.

2600
02:09:11,560 --> 02:09:12,560
Yeah.

2601
02:09:12,560 --> 02:09:17,560
Well, let's go back up to the let's go back up to the top world and, you know, try to be

2602
02:09:17,560 --> 02:09:21,560
the bring the good spirit of Dan Akroyd up to the world.

2603
02:09:21,560 --> 02:09:24,560
We, you know, not bring the heavy stuff that we encountered down here.

2604
02:09:24,560 --> 02:09:25,560
Yeah, I think that's great.

2605
02:09:25,560 --> 02:09:26,560
Yeah.

2606
02:09:26,560 --> 02:09:29,560
Hey, look, a police car with a giant megaphone on top.

2607
02:09:29,560 --> 02:09:32,560
Oh, well, let's climb in that and cruise up out of hell.

2608
02:09:32,560 --> 02:09:35,560
Yeah, that's the fastest way to do it.

2609
02:09:35,560 --> 02:09:36,560
I think.

2610
02:09:36,560 --> 02:09:37,560
I think so.

2611
02:09:37,560 --> 02:09:38,560
It's got to be.

2612
02:09:38,560 --> 02:09:39,560
Wow.

2613
02:09:39,560 --> 02:09:40,560
Well, there you have it, everybody.

2614
02:09:40,560 --> 02:09:46,560
You survived podcast, the ride, the downtown Disney ordeal, the underworld.

2615
02:09:46,560 --> 02:09:47,560
Yeah.

2616
02:09:47,560 --> 02:09:53,560
And now we all get to travel back up to the surface again.

2617
02:09:53,560 --> 02:09:59,560
And, you know, we will now, sadly, those of you who are kind enough to, you know, to

2618
02:09:59,560 --> 02:10:03,560
give us some money to help us in this expedition.

2619
02:10:03,560 --> 02:10:08,560
Now we got to go commingle, you know, with the, you know, the cheapskates up there who

2620
02:10:08,560 --> 02:10:10,560
are only listening to the free episodes.

2621
02:10:10,560 --> 02:10:11,560
Yeah.

2622
02:10:11,560 --> 02:10:12,560
But that's OK.

2623
02:10:12,560 --> 02:10:13,560
I have forgiveness in my heart.

2624
02:10:13,560 --> 02:10:14,560
I feel the same way.

2625
02:10:14,560 --> 02:10:15,560
And it's good.

2626
02:10:15,560 --> 02:10:17,560
For a second when you said cheapskates, I was like, oh, you're insulting them, but they'll

2627
02:10:17,560 --> 02:10:18,560
never know.

2628
02:10:18,560 --> 02:10:19,560
That's true.

2629
02:10:19,560 --> 02:10:20,560
Because they didn't pay.

2630
02:10:20,560 --> 02:10:23,560
They didn't fork out the cash to come down here.

2631
02:10:23,560 --> 02:10:24,560
Yeah.

2632
02:10:24,560 --> 02:10:27,560
And hear other listeners and fans of ours be insulted.

2633
02:10:27,560 --> 02:10:28,560
Yeah.

2634
02:10:28,560 --> 02:10:31,560
Unless the Patreon listeners tell the others what you said.

2635
02:10:31,560 --> 02:10:32,560
Hmm.

2636
02:10:32,560 --> 02:10:33,560
Which is a real logic trap.

2637
02:10:33,560 --> 02:10:34,560
Which could happen.

2638
02:10:34,560 --> 02:10:35,560
I hope none of it happens.

2639
02:10:35,560 --> 02:10:36,560
I hope so, too.

2640
02:10:36,560 --> 02:10:40,560
The thing is, we survived these three bonus episodes and we can keep.

2641
02:10:40,560 --> 02:10:43,560
I mean, now I'm realizing we're not even.

2642
02:10:43,560 --> 02:10:44,560
We're halfway.

2643
02:10:44,560 --> 02:10:45,560
We have a lot more to go.

2644
02:10:45,560 --> 02:10:46,560
And I've realized something.

2645
02:10:46,560 --> 02:10:51,560
I'm starting to learn what a podcast is.

2646
02:10:51,560 --> 02:10:52,560
Oh, OK.

2647
02:10:52,560 --> 02:10:53,560
You didn't know.

2648
02:10:53,560 --> 02:10:54,560
You've done a lot of them, actually.

2649
02:10:54,560 --> 02:10:56,560
You've done a lot of podcasts.

2650
02:10:56,560 --> 02:10:57,560
Yeah, yeah.

2651
02:10:57,560 --> 02:11:00,560
But I'm starting to feel it in my heart.

2652
02:11:00,560 --> 02:11:01,560
OK.

2653
02:11:01,560 --> 02:11:06,560
What would you if you had to define it in like a class, a classroom?

2654
02:11:06,560 --> 02:11:10,560
Friends sitting for a long time.

2655
02:11:10,560 --> 02:11:12,560
Friends sitting for a long time.

2656
02:11:12,560 --> 02:11:14,560
Friends sitting for a long time.

2657
02:11:14,560 --> 02:11:19,560
I mean, it's good you learned that lesson now because we got to get back to Anaheim proper.

2658
02:11:19,560 --> 02:11:29,560
But thankfully, we've got a full tank of gas, half a pack of cigarettes, and it's dark out and we're wearing sunglasses.

2659
02:11:29,560 --> 02:11:30,560
All right.

2660
02:11:30,560 --> 02:11:31,560
That was a quote.

2661
02:11:31,560 --> 02:11:32,560
Yeah, that's the.

2662
02:11:32,560 --> 02:11:33,560
That's the.

2663
02:11:33,560 --> 02:11:36,560
That's not that iconic, is it?

2664
02:11:36,560 --> 02:11:37,560
I'm happy that I don't know that.

2665
02:11:37,560 --> 02:11:38,560
It's a good poll.

2666
02:11:38,560 --> 02:11:41,560
The only reason I knew it was a quote was because you were reading off your phone.

2667
02:11:41,560 --> 02:11:43,560
I wouldn't have known what you were talking about.

2668
02:11:43,560 --> 02:11:44,560
What are you talking about?

2669
02:11:44,560 --> 02:11:45,560
Oh, sorry, sorry.

2670
02:11:45,560 --> 02:11:46,560
We're in the underworld.

2671
02:11:46,560 --> 02:11:47,560
Sorry, I just.

2672
02:11:47,560 --> 02:11:48,560
We're leaving the dark.

2673
02:11:48,560 --> 02:11:49,560
We're going to the light.

2674
02:11:49,560 --> 02:11:50,560
We need these sunglasses.

2675
02:11:50,560 --> 02:11:55,560
I think there's only one thing to do is go back up to the surface world.

2676
02:11:55,560 --> 02:11:58,560
And go save some souls.

2677
02:11:58,560 --> 02:12:01,560
We're all going to be a bunch of soul men.

2678
02:12:01,560 --> 02:12:04,560
Good work, everybody.

2679
02:12:04,560 --> 02:12:05,560
All right.

2680
02:12:05,560 --> 02:12:07,560
The free episode.

2681
02:12:07,560 --> 02:12:12,560
I got a job.

2682
02:12:12,560 --> 02:12:16,560
I got to do the course.

2683
02:12:16,560 --> 02:12:19,560
You're not going to cut this part out.

2684
02:12:19,560 --> 02:12:20,560
We all agree.

2685
02:12:20,560 --> 02:12:21,560
We don't like to.

2686
02:12:21,560 --> 02:12:22,560
So.

2687
02:12:22,560 --> 02:12:28,560
More than.

2688
02:12:28,560 --> 02:12:33,560
No, he was not more than.

2689
02:12:33,560 --> 02:12:39,484
One more time.
