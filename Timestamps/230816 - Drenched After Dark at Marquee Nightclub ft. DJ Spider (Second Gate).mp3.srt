1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,800
Warning, the intro to this episode is being recorded from an actual loud

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:13,000
douchey Vegas pool party. Hey yeah, this is Podcast The Ride!

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,640
Yo, it's DJ MacFisto, we're here on Podcast The Ride The Second Gate, y'all, let's make

4
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,400
some noise, yeah!

5
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,400
Yeah.

6
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,400
Hey!

7
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,400
Morton Moore is coming.

8
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:47,640
My YouTube is about to play one minute of like ambient noise to put a baby to sleep.

9
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:53,800
Anyway, yeah, yeah, DJ Sheridan is here in the house, he's soaked to the bone with adrenaline

10
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,800
and water and Red Bull.

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,200
Yo, I'm just excited for the listeners who hit play and then started driving a car when

12
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,560
that started going off.

13
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,080
What do you mean? They were driving like they got so hyped up?

14
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,080
Driving off the road.

15
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,080
Oh, they drove off the road, oh, of course.

16
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,240
That's okay, man, you drive off the road, no problem, because we're here and we're drenched,

17
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,040
we're soaked with adrenaline and Red Bull.

18
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,040
DJ Scott.

19
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,680
Yeah, and some of those listeners may now be soaked in a river as they drove into a

20
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:26,560
bridge from the utter shock of suddenly hearing loud theme music, then hearing a horn right

21
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,840
after of course is going to cause a swerve and some time in a river.

22
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:37,080
Like Michael Scott following the GPS style.

23
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:41,520
But yeah, we're here at Second Gate, we're here to basically, you know, talk about what

24
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:47,560
it was like to be in Las Vegas, but specifically, you know, you're seeing the name of the episode,

25
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,600
which is very exciting.

26
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:55,840
Yeah, I'd say a major, you know, it's generally we'll do some trip report kind of stuff.

27
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,840
Yeah, yeah.

28
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:04,520
An emphasis, I would say on Mike's successful attempt to get some of us to attend a loud

29
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,240
douchey Vegas pool party.

30
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,320
Yes, and this is, I mean, I don't want to say, well, I guess I don't want to say yet.

31
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,320
Exactly.

32
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,320
I'll bury the lead a little bit.

33
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,320
Greatest episode ever.

34
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,320
Best episode ever.

35
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,120
Yeah, you know, whatever.

36
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:21,120
I won't take a victory lap yet is what I'm saying.

37
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,120
We'll get there or we won't.

38
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,120
Maybe we won't.

39
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,520
Maybe I'll hang my head in shame.

40
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,520
We'll see.

41
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,520
We're not really sure.

42
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:32,240
Either possibility is a reality in Sin City.

43
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,240
You know?

44
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,240
Yeah, that's true.

45
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,880
You're doing a victory lap or hanging your head in shame.

46
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,680
It's really the flip of a coin.

47
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,680
That's right.

48
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,960
Lady Luck, they call her.

49
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,960
That's right.

50
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:45,920
A cruel mistress if ever there was one.

51
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,240
Not Lady Liberty.

52
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,240
There's only a fake Lady Liberty.

53
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,480
Lady Luck is not Lady Liberty.

54
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:56,480
But you can meet Lady Luck after passing by the fake Lady Liberty.

55
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,480
Right.

56
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,280
Only in Sin City.

57
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,320
Only there are you sometimes happy and sometimes not.

58
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,320
That's right.

59
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,320
That's where it happens.

60
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,120
Everywhere else you're one or the other.

61
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,400
And it, yeah, depending on city, city by city, if you're feeling good or feeling bad.

62
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,280
Yeah, you should check a map.

63
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,780
See how they see what the...

64
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,640
Forecast is of moods.

65
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:21,140
Is there ever been a personification of Lady Luck?

66
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:22,140
Gotta be, right?

67
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,140
Somewhere.

68
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,140
Lady Luck.

69
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:26,020
Yeah, because Lady Liberty, we know what she looks like.

70
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,020
But Lady Luck?

71
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:32,860
I mean, it seems like something that Pixar's got to get to at some point as they head down

72
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:40,660
their checklist of abstract concepts that they can turn into actual characters for increasingly

73
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:41,660
diminishing returns.

74
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:43,860
Smaller and smaller box office results.

75
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:47,780
And the patriotic returns, but also it sticks around for a little while.

76
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:53,260
And box office watchers are totally perplexed by like, wow, people keep seeing this movie.

77
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:57,900
They didn't go see it the Thursday night it was released and forget about it, you know?

78
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:58,900
Sure, sure.

79
00:03:58,900 --> 00:03:59,900
Yeah, yeah.

80
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:03,140
Well, it's either, yeah, that happens and things just stick around because they're better

81
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,220
received than you think.

82
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:10,300
And families go see him or because they stick around because America has spoken and the

83
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:16,060
Patriots are rising up and saying God's children are not for sale and church groups are doing

84
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:22,900
the right thing and paying it forward for hundreds and hundreds of empty seats to experience.

85
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:28,220
I'm jealous of those seats, that those seats get to see the movie more times than we ever

86
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:32,020
could because we have obligations and shit to do.

87
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,020
Yeah, yeah.

88
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,020
It drives me crazy.

89
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,020
I'd love to keep seeing Sound of Freedom.

90
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:36,020
I hear you.

91
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:40,620
Can I ask, has Pixar ever done a movie about a sound before?

92
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:41,620
Hmm.

93
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:46,140
No, they've, hmm, doesn't sound familiar, does it?

94
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:48,100
Oh, sounds familiar could be the name.

95
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:51,860
They call it Sounds Familiar and like it's like some sounds like common sounds, streets

96
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:55,860
sounds sort of beeping and driving on gravel or whatever.

97
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:58,140
And then there would be like a Sound of Freedom as well.

98
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:00,140
Oh, that's a good one.

99
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:01,140
Oh wow.

100
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,140
The personification of freedom is a sound.

101
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:03,140
This is guaranteed.

102
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:10,620
Okay, so like tepid box office for them meets exceptional box office for weird, stuck in

103
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:15,380
a can for five years, Patriot movie with questionable information.

104
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:21,100
You tie those things together, I think, and you get maybe a volley above a Barbie.

105
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,100
That's right.

106
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,460
Sound of Freedom is in sound.

107
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:27,380
They can't be, well, I was going to say they could use Sound City, but that's already Dave

108
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:30,700
Grohl got to that, but sounds familiar.

109
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,500
Sound of Freedom is in Sounds Familiar.

110
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:37,820
Oh, they're going to be hearing the sound of Ka-ching, Ka-ching, Ka-ching, Ka-ching.

111
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:38,820
Yeah.

112
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,780
Sound that has to be faked in Las Vegas.

113
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:41,780
What would the call?

114
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:42,780
We missed the coins.

115
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,820
They don't have the coins anymore.

116
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,300
They don't have the cups with coins and they don't have coins anymore.

117
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,740
We talked about the cups already on the show.

118
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,060
The dirty cups and the dirty coins.

119
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,060
The old dirty coin cups.

120
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,460
But you used to get the dirty coin cups.

121
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,940
I remember to play with Sandcastle to make Sandcastle.

122
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:56,940
That's what I say.

123
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:57,940
Yeah, that's that's right.

124
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:05,100
Family members would go over to Atlantic City and people just walk out with the cups, you

125
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:08,260
know, they lost their life savings and now they have to show for it.

126
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:09,260
Yeah.

127
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,260
Wait a minute.

128
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:14,300
Starting to sound to be starting to sound to me like you can be up or down in a second

129
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,300
place.

130
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:19,140
Here we are saying it was only Sin City, but this is Atlantic City we're talking about.

131
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:24,060
Yeah, it seems like Lady Luck can shine or Lady Misery can shine as well.

132
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:27,340
Well, any any number of bodies of water as well.

133
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:30,220
Casinos, cruise ships, you know.

134
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,220
Hmm.

135
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:40,460
OK, so we're not only only in 20 to 30 places can you have high stakes fun or get all the

136
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:41,460
way down.

137
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,180
Canto Bite is one of those places.

138
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,180
Canto Bite for sure.

139
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,180
Yeah.

140
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,180
Yeah.

141
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,180
Casino.

142
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:49,100
A Casino Night Zone and Sonic the Hedgehog.

143
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,100
Oh, yeah.

144
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,100
Yeah, certainly.

145
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,100
Because you could get hit.

146
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,980
You could just drop into some lava.

147
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:56,620
Something we missed in this series was covering that.

148
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:57,620
Oh, we should do.

149
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:58,820
Would have been a good excuse to cover that level.

150
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,860
I was obsessed with Casino Night Zone as a kid.

151
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:02,260
That was my favorite Sonic level.

152
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:03,260
Wow.

153
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:05,420
Because you go into the I don't know if you ever played it because you go into like a big

154
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:10,700
slot machine and Sonic would spin around and then the three whatever pictures would appear.

155
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:11,700
That's exciting.

156
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:12,700
Yeah.

157
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:16,940
To be inside one like the pinball ride from the Sid and Marty Croft world, but better.

158
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:17,940
Yeah.

159
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:22,180
Jason, would you like slot machines better if you could go inside them to play?

160
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:24,220
So you're in like a little womb.

161
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,780
I can like them even better.

162
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:26,780
Yeah.

163
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:27,780
Yeah.

164
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,980
So like you take your beloved little shop of horse penny slots and instead of sitting

165
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:35,700
in a chair outside, there's a little hole at the bottom and you go into the machine

166
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:40,380
and then you're sort of like surrounded on all four sides and you can hit the button.

167
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,100
That sounds like a Willy Wonka dream.

168
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,100
Yeah.

169
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:46,380
It's not how I think I would want to play, but I was just wondering because it's more

170
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:47,380
like womb like.

171
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,460
It's a Willy Wonka.

172
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:53,380
It's a dream like it is for Mike TV when he goes inside the TV.

173
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:54,380
Right.

174
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:55,380
It's a dream.

175
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,060
It's a great thing that happens to him.

176
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,380
Yeah, exactly.

177
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:03,580
So yeah, let's let's talk a little bit just like some, you know, the stray thoughts, some

178
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:08,060
stray feelings about Las Vegas trip and then we'll get to the big main event.

179
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,860
I think I think that's the one to do.

180
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:10,860
Right.

181
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:11,860
Yeah.

182
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:16,300
Start with the Jason Sheridan and just give us a little bit of a recap of your time, your

183
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,820
stay, how the hotel amenities were.

184
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,140
Sure.

185
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,140
Everyone's asking.

186
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:22,140
Yeah.

187
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:23,860
The hotel, many's were pretty good.

188
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:26,180
We flew in Saturday morning.

189
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,180
Yeah.

190
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:34,060
We, you know, checked into the hotel kind of early, but like not early enough where there

191
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:35,980
are still rooms available.

192
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:39,540
You know, if you get there really early, they still have some stray rooms.

193
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:40,980
How early are we talking?

194
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:45,620
If you get to a hotel, I feel like around eight or nine a.m.

195
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:47,180
I have had good luck getting a room.

196
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:49,260
I think I think we got there.

197
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,260
That's so early.

198
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:52,260
Probably around 10 or 11.

199
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,980
This is radically different than how I travel.

200
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:55,980
Oh, I.

201
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:56,980
8 a.m. really?

202
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:57,980
Yeah.

203
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:58,980
I check.

204
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:05,540
I try to check in as early as I can, you know, because worst case you have like the full

205
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:10,780
day to do stuff or if the room's ready, you can take a little nap from getting there so

206
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:11,780
early.

207
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:15,860
Worst case is you're you're tired as hell and then you don't have anywhere to go.

208
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:16,860
Oh, yeah.

209
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:17,860
I was tired.

210
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:22,580
By the time we started doing tech for the show, I was very tired.

211
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:30,780
So I rallied, you know, we so we I think we got in the room like around two between two

212
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:31,780
and three.

213
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:32,780
This is the level of detail.

214
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:33,780
The listeners are.

215
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:36,780
Well, that's why I started with it first.

216
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:40,060
Shout out the numbers as Jason says them.

217
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:44,540
We got into the room and found the sink was immediately clogged.

218
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,740
So we had to call.

219
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,620
Hotel friend.

220
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:49,620
You have.

221
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:50,620
Did you?

222
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:51,620
Are you on a name?

223
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:52,620
We want to know.

224
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:53,620
We did.

225
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:54,620
Yeah, he was really.

226
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:56,740
He said a maintenance guy so fast and he didn't just dump Drano.

227
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:58,820
We like snake the sink.

228
00:09:58,820 --> 00:09:59,820
Wow.

229
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:03,180
And you watched him with like a watchful eye to make sure he is going to be a Drano.

230
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,180
He's Drano.

231
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,180
He's going to be.

232
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,180
Oh, he well.

233
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,860
And then he wrote his name down.

234
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,500
He's like, if you need anything else.

235
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,740
And then he scribbled something else and he gave us.

236
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:14,140
He's like, this is fifty dollars.

237
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:17,100
You can use this fifty dollar resort credit.

238
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,380
But he gave you his phone home phone number.

239
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,940
No, not his home phone number.

240
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,980
Like the name of who serviced it.

241
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:25,420
He's like, there's any other problems.

242
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:26,860
We're very sorry for the trouble.

243
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,980
I thought he was like, here's a real number.

244
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:31,060
And then he's like, if you need something, call.

245
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,060
Yeah.

246
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:34,060
And then he really meant like if you want drugs or something.

247
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:36,740
Oh, that had been then in your hookup.

248
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:39,660
Or yeah, but he just gave you a gift certificate.

249
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,140
Yeah, a little comp.

250
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,140
That's nice.

251
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,140
Yeah, you're up.

252
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:48,060
So I was up and then I immediately bet on the Phillies game that day.

253
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:53,300
And by the time we got to tech, I had lost fifty dollars because they lost one

254
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,300
nothing.

255
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,620
Up and down. Lady luck.

256
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:56,620
Up and down.

257
00:10:56,620 --> 00:11:00,220
Me and Vegas and 40 years, maybe 70 or so other places.

258
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,220
That's right.

259
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,580
So yeah.

260
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:06,220
So so you're that's the major only major issue you had with the room.

261
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,060
Everything else smooth.

262
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:09,700
Yeah, everything else was pretty smooth.

263
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,300
OK, god damn it.

264
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,780
OK. But how many?

265
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:18,260
But but but how many times the whole trip did you call and harass the front desk

266
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:21,660
for things? Well, called once for more towels.

267
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:22,820
OK, got it.

268
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,820
And they call the second time.

269
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:31,060
To get a late check out, which you now have to pay thirty dollars for,

270
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:35,380
which I had done late check out there before and I'd never had that experience.

271
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:37,900
They're on to you. They're on to you in your early arrivals.

272
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:41,100
These people trying to stretch these times that we said.

273
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,060
I tried to really lay it on thick at the front desk.

274
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:47,300
I was like, you know, we got in the room and the sinks immediately.

275
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:49,620
You know, we get a late check out.

276
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:54,100
And because I got the guy last year, like he's like,

277
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:55,820
I'm going to put that in the note.

278
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:56,900
Like he was winking.

279
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,260
The listeners can't hear the wink.

280
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,220
Just so you know. Yeah.

281
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,820
I'll add a sound effect.

282
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,260
Yeah. Yeah.

283
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:05,540
He's like, I'm sorry, you had trouble with the sink.

284
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:11,060
Like he he did that as a bit last year and gave us the freebie late.

285
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,660
Check out, you know.

286
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:15,620
Yeah. And you thought maybe you could run this back

287
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:17,980
and it didn't seem like it with the person was receptive.

288
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:22,380
He actively did not give a shit. Yeah.

289
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,900
Yeah. He's like, you can probably call.

290
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,900
You can call guest relations and see.

291
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:30,180
And I said, does that normally work?

292
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:32,420
And he's like, not my experience.

293
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:37,420
It's like, fair enough, how the person was like working against you. Yeah.

294
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:42,900
So you see Jason sees like four nights, three days at a hotel.

295
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:46,820
And he thinks a little bit he can be like, can that turn into

296
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,020
can that turn into close to six days?

297
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,220
Yeah. Oh, sure.

298
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:54,460
Hey, look, with these resort fees and we all deserve it nowadays.

299
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:56,140
I agree. Yeah.

300
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,780
You're thinking big.

301
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:01,540
That's we we are big adventure.

302
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:04,020
We hadn't done this. We got a couple's massage.

303
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,020
Oh, yeah. Let's hear this.

304
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:07,300
That was very fun.

305
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,100
I had never done that before.

306
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,420
Did you ever get a massage at all?

307
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:13,900
I'd like smaller L.A. places.

308
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:19,740
But this is like they give you a it gives you spa access for the full day.

309
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,340
Right. That's what Gabris was talking about.

310
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:23,500
Yeah. So what Gabris was talking about.

311
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,060
So like they walked us in.

312
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:29,380
They gave us each a robe like the women are on one side.

313
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:31,380
The men are on the other. Yeah. I hate to stop you here.

314
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:33,980
How was the road? The road was very nice.

315
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,820
It's a shame they don't have them in the room. You know?

316
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,660
But they are like they're like real soft.

317
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,580
They were very plush. Yeah.

318
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:42,900
One of the best robes you've ever had at a hotel.

319
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,540
It was like I thought five.

320
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:46,740
Three. Yes.

321
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:50,540
I think top three easy because I think it's a spa.

322
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:51,460
They want it to be.

323
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:55,860
It's not just like the great Californian like throwing up.

324
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:59,620
I don't know the listener to be able to imagine so that they sorry.

325
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:02,900
You want the listener to feel like they're putting on the robe Jason put on.

326
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:05,220
Yes, I do. OK. It was very nice.

327
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:09,140
And then and then the massage itself, they hold up like

328
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:12,460
they put you under a sheet and then a comforter.

329
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:14,940
Because you're new. Of course. Yeah.

330
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:20,460
And then they kind of pull back each section as they're doing each section.

331
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,620
It's a modesty thing.

332
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:24,660
It's a massage ever, Scott. No, no. Right. No. OK.

333
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,180
But it was very nice.

334
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:30,180
Pretty within two or three minutes.

335
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,660
You fell asleep.

336
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,660
No, no. I was awake.

337
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:37,620
Within two or three minutes, Jane was like, you can go harder.

338
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:40,020
And I was like, you can go a little softer

339
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,620
because I have a pretty gentle boy.

340
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:47,140
You know, I am pretty.

341
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:49,380
So you're you know, I've never done a couple's massage.

342
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:53,500
So so the setup is that there's two massage tables next to each other.

343
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:56,900
There they were reasonably like five or six feet apart.

344
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,020
Are you in the same room?

345
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:00,620
Are you like face to face so you could give each other a little kiss?

346
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:03,420
No, it's parallel. No, I I guess that

347
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:06,660
I asked not about a little kiss.

348
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,860
I was like, Jane, do we hold the hair?

349
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:11,220
And she's like, no, you don't hold the hair.

350
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,740
And yeah, what is it?

351
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:14,060
What makes it on you?

352
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,100
Because what's the like?

353
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,300
That's what I've always wondered is like, what's the benefit of it

354
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:20,380
being a couple's massage other than just you're in the same room?

355
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:23,060
Like why if you're not interacting, what's the point?

356
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:26,780
It's fair because two different different masseuses.

357
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:28,220
Maseuses. Yeah.

358
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:33,220
So and, you know, the nice perk, the little the lounge,

359
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:39,100
the co-ed lounge at the spa, you know, espresso, tea, snacks,

360
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:41,220
canned juice, canned.

361
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:42,140
Did you have any canned juice?

362
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,340
I had some canned juice.

363
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:44,180
Yeah, I agree.

364
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:47,180
Some romantic couples, canned juice.

365
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:51,100
When we came out, they had poured us champagne because we said,

366
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,180
oh, it's Jane's birthday next week.

367
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:58,140
We got a new apartment and they they had little chocolates and champagne for us.

368
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:59,900
How did you ever leave this place?

369
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,900
I don't know. I

370
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,900
yeah, I hung around.

371
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:07,180
We hung around for a little while.

372
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:10,140
Did you have like meals there?

373
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:11,700
No, you can't go that far.

374
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:14,100
Some chocolate, canned juice sandwiches,

375
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,340
chocolate, just got to rearrange what they have.

376
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:18,900
Party mix, snack mix, potatoes.

377
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:21,140
You can put some oil on that, make it like a sauce.

378
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:23,460
But that's technically intended for the bodies.

379
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:27,540
If you leave a piece of clothing behind, do you say, oh, I'm going to go back in there

380
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:30,380
and you can steal an extra day and go back into the spa area?

381
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,660
You can probably fudge it.

382
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,860
Yeah, but they would probably help you look for it.

383
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:38,540
That's true. Yeah, there was a lot of staff.

384
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:42,860
They were they were really checking in with you a lot if you needed anything or

385
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:46,780
because they have like in the in that spa area, they have like, what, a shower, a steam room.

386
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:48,540
There were showers.

387
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,660
Jane said the showers are really nice.

388
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:52,300
I just thought it was locker room showers.

389
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,660
And she was like, no, these are like spa.

390
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:55,940
Like they have stalls.

391
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:58,060
They had stalls. Yeah.

392
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:03,180
And there was both a steam room and a sauna and a soaking like hot tub.

393
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:05,460
And did you soak or sauna?

394
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:07,820
No, no, I was. Huh?

395
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,180
Why not sauna?

396
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:11,540
Oh, I don't like a dry heat.

397
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:15,100
I dry heat. I mean, this is dry.

398
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,220
Steam room is humid.

399
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,100
Steam room is steam.

400
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,460
But they have a steam. So you did the steam room.

401
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:22,300
They did have a steam. No, I didn't do the steam room either.

402
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:27,300
Why not? Because I was like, my limbs were like jelly after the massage.

403
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,380
Do you like a steam room?

404
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:32,140
No sauna? No.

405
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:33,260
OK, well, you have no.

406
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,380
I don't know. I don't know why this isn't my thing.

407
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,660
But I like a steam room a lot.

408
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:41,540
They were they were like, by the way, after we leave the lobby,

409
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:43,300
the lobby of the spa was very nice.

410
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:45,740
So they're like, by the way, no cell phones.

411
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:49,020
When we once we leave this lobby, because it is

412
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:54,900
nudity is allowed in the separate men and women's sections.

413
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:56,700
Right. But not in the communal area.

414
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,220
Not in the communal areas.

415
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:01,980
Sorry, listeners, no pics. No pics.

416
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:07,260
But I was like, oh, man, we should do we spots sometime.

417
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:10,180
We spot. Someone told us we should do we.

418
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:12,220
We spots. No, W.I.

419
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:13,900
Spots. Localizing, localizing.

420
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:14,780
It's a Los Angeles place.

421
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:16,380
It's a Los Angeles place.

422
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:20,900
But it has lots of different like rainforest room or different.

423
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:23,060
Oh, OK. Are they themed?

424
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,180
I think they're lightly.

425
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:26,260
Oh, well, we're going to do that and review it.

426
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,900
That's going to be main feed.

427
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,500
Yeah, that's like are you saying the three of us is that?

428
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,260
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

429
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:33,580
New to the we would like this.

430
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:36,100
I think I don't think this is like a very luxurious.

431
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:37,620
Yeah. Thing to do.

432
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,500
It doesn't have to be weird. I think so.

433
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,860
But is there a fear about it? No.

434
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:44,740
I don't know why I I'm also

435
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:48,100
I think I'm an uptight person.

436
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:51,780
And maybe I think maybe I'm like it's like an armor.

437
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:52,980
Maybe I got to keep it up.

438
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:56,340
Maybe they I probably don't allow myself to relax enough.

439
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,980
So it's probably be a good experiment to.

440
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:01,340
Yeah. You probably have like a glass of champagne before.

441
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:04,780
And then do you not do you not think that the three of us

442
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:06,700
doing that is weird on some level?

443
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:09,340
Oh, I don't know.

444
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:12,460
I mean, it's like women that go to a spa together.

445
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:16,940
I think it's maybe weird in like a like a culture, like a societal thing

446
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:19,700
that maybe if you really examine it, what's what's weird about it?

447
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,500
Yeah, but I'm not going to pin it all on that.

448
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,220
Are you really the three of you really?

449
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:26,500
I'm going to look you both in the eyes and say you think there

450
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:30,060
there would not be any moment of weirdness when the three of us

451
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:31,700
all together are in a spa.

452
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,300
It would be funny. Yeah, it'd be funny.

453
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,620
Yeah, I'm sure. That's what I'm fishing. Yeah.

454
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:37,460
And society has made us fit.

455
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:38,420
Has nothing to do with that.

456
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:39,700
It has everything to do with that.

457
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:42,380
Us, the three theme park boys are all funny.

458
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:44,580
Yeah, it's far together. Sure. I won't deny that.

459
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:51,060
I when he said, you know, I he had to be the rogue.

460
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:53,100
I had my, you know, clothes on.

461
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:57,540
And he's like, by the way, from back here on, you can be nude.

462
00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:00,860
And I wasn't really nude anywhere, but it was in the locker room.

463
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:03,420
I was like, this feels very powerful.

464
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:06,780
This feels very free because I feel freeing.

465
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:09,300
And then I went to I love the sound.

466
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:13,340
I went into the toilets and stuff and immediately saw an old man ass.

467
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:17,220
Like, I immediately saw an old man ass very comfortable with the nude.

468
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,100
Yeah, I'm not.

469
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,060
I'm not.

470
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:21,340
I've only done this a couple of times, but I'm not Mr.

471
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:22,580
Comfortable nude or anything.

472
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:24,620
I'm not like I'm not trying to act like I'm Mr.

473
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,380
Mr. Powerful over here.

474
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:27,860
I think it was the camper.

475
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:30,180
I think it was just like, oh, they're so nice.

476
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:32,540
Yeah, they're so nice. And I'm naked.

477
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:40,420
I also was like I when I got down there, I wasn't sure for a couple's massage.

478
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:46,100
Like we do to tip one per do you tip one amount or you tip both people?

479
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:51,620
And they were like, by the way, the tip is included in the bill up front.

480
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,780
And this goes to everyone working on you.

481
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:56,580
And I was like, that actually was a question I had.

482
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:58,700
So I'm glad that got solved.

483
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:00,500
So you can add it in like in the receipt.

484
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,660
Yeah. Or it's 20 percent.

485
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:04,460
Or they just give it automatically.

486
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:05,020
Automatically.

487
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:05,660
I see. Yeah.

488
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,940
All right. Well, it sounds good.

489
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:09,700
I mean, it sounds like you had a pretty good time.

490
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:11,020
It was good. Yeah.

491
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:11,700
Yeah. Were there in there?

492
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:12,540
No. What would you say?

493
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:13,220
Like shenanigans?

494
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:15,980
Did you do any other experiences sort of that?

495
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,460
Or worth talking about?

496
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:22,420
You know, I think well, I free play.

497
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:28,220
OK, so I was already I was already down from the Phillies game.

498
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:33,540
And I had claimed the my Vegas rewards.

499
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:37,980
I had claimed this is the app that Jason and I play that we get points.

500
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:41,860
And then if you have like a million points, you get fifty dollars or something.

501
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:43,140
It's like so many points.

502
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:48,620
Sorry. So all you have to do is be playing the game constantly for years.

503
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:50,140
And then you get 50.

504
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,300
That's right. Wow.

505
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:53,700
I think this is the bargain of the century.

506
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:56,780
Yeah. I claimed one hundred dollars.

507
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:57,740
Oh, you did one hundred dollars.

508
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:59,140
I did one hundred dollars.

509
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:01,020
Find out how much that how many points that is.

510
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:01,740
You keep talking.

511
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:06,340
And I played that on like a generic quarter machine

512
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:08,460
and then mostly on the little shop machine.

513
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,420
So you did go back to the little shop.

514
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:12,580
I think all my questions are about the little shop before.

515
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:14,420
You did get some little shop time.

516
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:15,900
I got some little shop time.

517
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:21,860
We played the one night and it's a little hard to tell with a free play,

518
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:24,180
because obviously free play, you just have to.

519
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:27,860
The way it works is you load up your player's card

520
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:31,100
and then you feed it like ten or twenty dollars.

521
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:35,900
And then every spin, it just refills that ten or twenty dollars.

522
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:41,940
OK, so at some point, it had the little shop machine up to one ninety five.

523
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:44,980
And I played it down to seven cents.

524
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:46,460
You were up.

525
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:47,580
So I was up.

526
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:51,500
And the reason I kept playing was I kept trying the max bet

527
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,820
because a little thing would pop up.

528
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:58,540
And it's like if you get all like I got all the columns, but one.

529
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:03,060
And it's like if you get this last column, you will win eight thousand dollars.

530
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:07,260
So I was trying to get that eight because I once played.

531
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:09,460
I'm sure I've talked about before.

532
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:11,700
I once played the little shop machine.

533
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:14,180
One like 50 or 60 bucks walked away.

534
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:18,140
And when I walked by a few minutes later, someone had won twelve hundred dollars.

535
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:20,420
Wow. Wow. I was like.

536
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:23,060
So and you lost how many months of sleep due to this?

537
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:28,860
I I was a little annoyed at myself that I didn't cash out.

538
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:32,500
My unofficial my feeling about if you're sort of a conservative gambler,

539
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:35,020
which I would think that all of us are. Yeah.

540
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:38,860
But I kind of feel like there's in the last couple of years,

541
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:42,020
I feel like the most you can do is double your money.

542
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:46,060
Like if you've doubled your money on a machine or at the table,

543
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:48,340
I kind of feel like you should walk away.

544
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:50,580
I don't know if there's any statistics to back this up.

545
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:55,060
That's good. But I think that's almost like that's the best you're going to do

546
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:56,020
in that sitting.

547
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:59,580
Some of the penny slots, if you bet a little and then start

548
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:02,580
betting Max Bet, you'll queue off a lot of the bonus.

549
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:05,500
Sure. I'm not saying it's not possible because obviously people at jackpots

550
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:08,140
and stuff. But if you're sort of just playing again,

551
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:11,460
conservatively, yeah, I kind of feel like if you're up double

552
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:15,060
or if you have you've won what you started with, you probably should stop

553
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:18,100
and take a break. That's a good rule of thumb.

554
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,420
Yes, I had never done.

555
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:23,220
I was mostly like, how is this free play worth it?

556
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:25,460
Because it's like house money.

557
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:29,460
So what's some of the things that happen in the Little Shop of Horrors game?

558
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:30,940
Oh, it's a success.

559
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:33,100
It cues little songs.

560
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:37,660
Audrey to songs from the movie or songs from the movie

561
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:39,420
or little scenes from the movie.

562
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:43,660
You think Menken's getting money every time you get a little jackpot?

563
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:45,740
Who's getting money? Menken, Elmenken.

564
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:49,220
Oh, maybe Howard Ashman and Elmenken wrote those songs.

565
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,820
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

566
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:57,940
We every time you get a wild, it makes Audrey to grow.

567
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:01,700
But that's how they get you to stay at the machine,

568
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:04,540
because if you get Audrey to real big,

569
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:08,900
you you get like 10 free game or 10 free spin.

570
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,100
Ten spins. Yeah.

571
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:13,340
Yeah. Did you did you get her a little big or a big?

572
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:15,460
I got her big a couple of times.

573
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:18,740
I got her all the way to cue the free spins a few times.

574
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:21,580
OK, OK. You did get you got Audrey all the way big.

575
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:27,860
Yeah. And then Jane, when we were doing a different free play at Bellagio,

576
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:34,140
Jane, we were playing the Wizard Vos machine and that cued like a wicked witch.

577
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:37,820
Seen, do you also do you get the wicked witch big?

578
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:39,740
Is it always getting regular size?

579
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:42,940
She's regular size, but she like takes over the screen.

580
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:45,980
Does the wizard have you said so? It sounds big.

581
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:49,740
That sounds like it's really a long camera.

582
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:52,260
Camera thing, though, or this is an actual.

583
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:53,780
Yeah, then. OK, OK.

584
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:58,780
Bellagio to I mean, Park MGM, one of the selling points is it's no smoking inside.

585
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:00,140
Yes. And which is nice.

586
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:03,620
Bellagio, it is a little fun to sit at the Wizard Vos machine

587
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:06,060
with a cigarette hanging out of your mouth. Did you do that?

588
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:08,020
I did do that with the little.

589
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:10,540
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, you, Jason, you have to take a photo of this next time.

590
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:12,300
You had a slot machine with a cigarette.

591
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:13,860
Just dangling. Yeah.

592
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:15,660
Or at least call us over.

593
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:16,660
At least so we could see it.

594
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:18,780
We don't have to. We're just taking over the screen.

595
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:20,980
It can be a photo.

596
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:23,300
It can be just for us. It doesn't have to be for social media.

597
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:25,060
Oh, that is true. Yeah.

598
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:27,180
I that's a good picture.

599
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:29,700
You like Dan Aykroyd in Ghostbusters.

600
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:32,820
He's got the one the cigarette hanging when he's like looking through the hall.

601
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:34,420
Very much that.

602
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:37,740
Did you? Real quick side note, I said this to you guys and you didn't respond.

603
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:41,700
But the Blues Brothers Khan has been postponed due to the ongoing writer

604
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:44,020
strike and actor strike.

605
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,900
I'm very sorry I haven't known.

606
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:51,300
Actually, I abstained from saying anything because I'm on strike as a writer.

607
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:55,660
So I felt like making a joke about it would have been an important breaking.

608
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:56,780
Yeah, exactly.

609
00:26:56,780 --> 00:27:00,100
Well, but if you read what I sent you, it says in there

610
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:02,980
that what was being planned for the Blues Brothers Khan was Dan Aykroyd's

611
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:05,140
final performance as a Blues Brother.

612
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:09,420
I think I think I actually did read it and I think you're wrong.

613
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:12,900
I think if you like, I could be wrong.

614
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,500
You could pull it up yourself and check it up.

615
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:17,580
Yes, because that that's that phrase struck me odd, too.

616
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:22,260
I think it's his final performance at the prison.

617
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:23,780
I think so.

618
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:28,580
Unless the sentence was it's his final performance as which fucking one is he?

619
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,340
Jake L.

620
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:30,620
L.

621
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:33,780
Wood. Yeah, it's his final performance as Elwood at the prison.

622
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:37,340
If it was saying that the prison will host the final performance.

623
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,220
What's the sentence?

624
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:40,500
Well, I see a little bit.

625
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:44,580
I was I was seeing what you're saying, but I'm not sure that it's that's the intent

626
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:47,300
because this is this will be Dan Aykroyd's final performance as Elwood

627
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:49,620
at the Jolie at prison.

628
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:53,620
So I guess we sound like it's just that he will never be.

629
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:55,100
Oh, would at the prison again.

630
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:55,780
No, you're right.

631
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:58,260
He had a pain in the ass to travel to.

632
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,380
Not if you're Dan Aykroyd.

633
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:03,540
You got to probably a helicopter that takes you all the way there.

634
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:07,260
Well, they had a giant skull that's been turned into a helicopter.

635
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:09,060
Oh, OK. Crystal skull.

636
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:10,860
Yeah, no, I see what you're saying.

637
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,380
It could be written wrong.

638
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:14,060
It could be poorly written or you could be right.

639
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:18,700
And he's just planning on never performing as Elwood at the prison again.

640
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:21,380
But he is any other casino.

641
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:23,500
He's willing to show up for the right amount of money.

642
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,660
Yeah, yeah, yes.

643
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:27,260
I mean, also, you've got SNL 50 coming up, you know.

644
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:28,780
Yeah, I guess you're right.

645
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:29,980
Maybe that's not going to be.

646
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:33,580
Oh, yeah. Maybe that's the out is he knows he's going to have to do it on 50.

647
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:34,940
And that'll be the final performance.

648
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:39,580
That's where he started. Light himself on fire on on live television.

649
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:41,740
What year? The show's dangerous again.

650
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:43,300
I'm killing myself.

651
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:46,180
What year is that? Is that 24?

652
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:48,780
I don't know. I do.

653
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:51,060
But yeah, it'll be in the next because it could be in the

654
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:53,500
two years in the first part of the TV season.

655
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:56,140
Yeah, no, you're probably right.

656
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:58,420
But I do. I think actually it makes a lot of sense that he's

657
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:01,860
because why wouldn't you have your final performance be at the prison

658
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:05,380
if not for the place where the character was created? Yeah.

659
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:07,180
So I think you you might be right.

660
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:09,620
We'll see. But I'll track it. Don't worry.

661
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:12,860
Well, just can you is there a common can you is there a comment

662
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:14,540
space in whatever you're looking at?

663
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:18,060
Can you ask if about the was this a grammatical error?

664
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:19,660
I can't. I will. Yeah. Right.

665
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:22,140
And this is Elwood's final performance. Let's see.

666
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:25,620
OK, I'm going to send a DM to the official Jake and Elwood.

667
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,860
We're doing this on the show. Yeah, I'll send it now.

668
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:31,300
And it looks like Judy Belushi wrote this post.

669
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,820
I think she signed it.

670
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:36,260
I can't imagine she's responding to the well, I mean, they're dealing

671
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:39,140
with so many angry people upset about the

672
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:42,540
you can't tell me that you can cancel the event,

673
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:45,020
but you can't crush Blues Brothers spirit forever.

674
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:47,780
OK, I'm going to send hi there.

675
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:51,300
I was wondering if Dan is retiring as Elwood permanently or just

676
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:52,340
I think it's my personal one.

677
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:53,940
OK, I just wasn't sure.

678
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:57,900
Yeah, this is just a I'm just a fan asking a question and we'll see if they respond.

679
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:00,780
OK, yeah. I mean, I don't want you to take longer writing this,

680
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:04,020
but I would kind of I kind of want you to say like the syntax of the sentence

681
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:07,380
confused me and as you could actually see, I can do that.

682
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:11,940
OK, I've written hi there was wondering if Dan is retiring as Elwood permanently

683
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:14,900
or just retiring from playing Elwood at the Joliet prison.

684
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,380
I'm going to send this to the official.

685
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:17,860
I'm going to send this to the official.

686
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:19,380
I'm going to send this to the official.

687
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:21,140
I was confused by the wording of the post

688
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:23,380
and just want a clarification. Thank you for your time.

689
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:27,180
Is there a Blues Brothers phrase I should add, like to show that I'm a true fan?

690
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:32,780
Where you're asking the wrong person, they say things in the movie,

691
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:36,340
you know, everybody meet.

692
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:38,060
What is that fucking song?

693
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:39,860
Everybody, everybody.

694
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:42,580
Yeah, which I just write Sweet Home, Chicago.

695
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:46,180
That's yes, Sweet Home Chicago comma Michael.

696
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:47,820
Michael.

697
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:48,820
Sweet Home.

698
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:52,500
What a sign off.

699
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,900
Yeah, Sweet Home Chicago.

700
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:58,900
That seems like something a like a Chicago news anchor would have done.

701
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,780
Yeah, yeah, OK.

702
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:04,300
I have sent it to the official Blues Brothers Instagram as a DM.

703
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:07,340
OK, and hopefully we get a response within the next few minutes.

704
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:12,500
Yeah, I mean, obviously, I mean, and you got a lot of alerts to wade through

705
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:15,060
already. Yeah, I mean, I noticed within the

706
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:20,260
350 pop ups that happened while we're still recording,

707
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:23,940
if you manage to get it, stop everything as rudely as possible.

708
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:26,020
Interrupt us. OK, yeah, of course I will.

709
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:29,580
Emergency, emergency, emergency within the episode.

710
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:31,660
Yes. Yeah, yeah, for sure.

711
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:36,780
So yeah, so free play, I noticed was 400000 points on that app.

712
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:40,180
And basically I have like 200000 and I played hardcore for like six months

713
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:43,660
and then I check in once in a while and I only ever got like 300000.

714
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:47,340
So Jason has said he has over a million, which is a lot of time.

715
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:51,140
Yeah. And again, what this gets you is one hundred dollars.

716
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:54,500
But it's free. It's free. Whoa.

717
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:58,220
Well, one hundred and fifty dollars, including the twenty five dollar

718
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:02,220
Konami free plays, which are different from regular free plays.

719
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,820
Yeah. So there you go.

720
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:05,300
And how much time do you think?

721
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:09,060
What was the amount of time in which this one hundred and fifty thousand hours?

722
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:11,180
Malcolm Gladwell's ten thousand hours.

723
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,140
Anything good in this?

724
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:17,180
We all wild away time during the lockdown months in our own special ways.

725
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:18,500
The answer is the lockdown.

726
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,740
So we're talking this is three years.

727
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:22,460
That's right. Oh, years of covid.

728
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:25,940
Yeah, I don't play as much recently.

729
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:27,220
And they can't get to you.

730
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:30,260
Can't get like an unlimited amount of points per day.

731
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:32,300
You got to come back every day.

732
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:35,580
Like they'll let you maybe earn like a couple thousand a day.

733
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:39,020
But I kept winning billions of the chips.

734
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:40,220
Right. So it can be a little quicker

735
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:43,860
if you're playing high level bets, essentially.

736
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:44,860
Mm hmm.

737
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:50,460
Um, I guys, I got to say, I'm having a lot of questions about the

738
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:55,660
the logistics, the the this this app.

739
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:57,060
I have some I'm not sure.

740
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:58,820
I'm glad you enjoy it. Yeah.

741
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:02,260
I don't know if this is the best use of your time, the best value.

742
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:05,180
Again, there's five apps. OK.

743
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:07,420
Jason's playing all five of the apps, too. Yeah.

744
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:08,860
I like to play around.

745
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:12,460
I would do between five apps for three years.

746
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:16,140
OK, what if I were to tell you some of them are real buggy?

747
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:18,380
Like some of them are pain in the ass.

748
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:22,380
I look I have no I can't throw stones for this

749
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:25,500
because I Jason certainly plays a lot of this more much more than I do.

750
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,700
But I you know, I've I've got my apps.

751
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:30,180
I've got my little things I do every day.

752
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:32,980
That you have all those time wasters.

753
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:35,540
Well, that's true. I'm just saying I'm not like more than anybody.

754
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:40,500
I don't know how you have found time to fit a child into a life of thousands

755
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,100
of apps and alerts. That's true.

756
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:44,180
I mean, I have to ignore a lot of them.

757
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:47,140
And then I had to take some off because, you know, sometimes you don't need

758
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:48,500
as many as you think you need.

759
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:51,060
I hope you wrote a nice letter to each and every one of them,

760
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:52,900
thanking them for their time. Yeah.

761
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:56,060
I a lot of things I play.

762
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:58,780
Teddy Ruxpin branded NFT

763
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,740
alerts dot com. Yeah.

764
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:05,180
I already have Moon.

765
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:06,620
It's like some weird sheep.

766
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:11,300
Mm hmm. I no longer need to purchase Teddy Ruxpin NFTs.

767
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:15,140
I have enough thrilled to see Teddy back in this world in the

768
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:16,540
exactly the media.

769
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:17,900
My digital should be digital.

770
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:20,380
Don't let this seem like any disrespect.

771
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:22,740
It's just that I'm a father now and God damn it.

772
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:24,540
My priorities have had to change.

773
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:26,340
You think I'm happy with it myself?

774
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:29,180
I'm playing a lot of Marvel Snap.

775
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:30,380
That is what I waste time with.

776
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:32,860
I haven't gotten into it yet.

777
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:34,620
It is so much fun.

778
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:36,900
It is a legit, really fun game.

779
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:39,460
There is like strategy and collecting stuff.

780
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:41,060
And there's a lot of it's really fun.

781
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:42,620
Yeah. I would say that.

782
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:44,700
But well, OK, so you would.

783
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:46,940
But does it earn you cold hard cash?

784
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:48,300
No, it does not.

785
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:49,900
So, yeah, you can't.

786
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:50,820
Yeah, you can't sell those.

787
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:53,940
Probably put 18 dollars worth of time into this game.

788
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:55,900
It's a good point. What do you get for it?

789
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:57,780
Nothing. Nothing. So.

790
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:59,860
So what was my other?

791
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:00,980
Oh, the

792
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:05,300
uh, uh, Jane and I, you know, we've been to Vegas

793
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:06,780
like four years in a row now.

794
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:09,380
And so we've seen the different seasons of the

795
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:13,220
the Blasio Conservatories are always really fun.

796
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:18,500
This season had a lot more like cool music, fun lighting.

797
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:23,660
They have giant like screens built into the floral arrangements now.

798
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:26,340
So very theme parky.

799
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:29,100
I made it over there and it's kind of like a it's

800
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:32,700
it's a little bit of like an island theme.

801
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:33,740
And, you know, I was on it.

802
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:37,020
I was getting sort of like Moana vibes from it.

803
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:40,220
And the question I had while looking at it, and I could be wrong,

804
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:45,300
but I was wondering, is this temporary Bellagio thing that resembles Moana

805
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:49,180
better than the eventual journey of water will be?

806
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:50,900
Probably. Yeah.

807
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:55,420
And you have to remember the Blasio Conservatory changes every season.

808
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:58,940
So you get a big lunar New Year one.

809
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:00,220
And you get a spring and fall one.

810
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:01,740
They're throwing this in the trash.

811
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:03,900
Yeah, you're saying, yeah, you're saying it's a temporary thing

812
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:06,700
and it still might be better than the permanent thing in Epcot.

813
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:09,260
I'm going to just because of the way things seem to be going.

814
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:12,820
Just generally the way the you know,

815
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:16,700
it's like I remember recently is that like Disneyland is announcing big

816
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,740
anniversary plans.

817
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:22,540
I forget which one they were even, but I just I just saw a video

818
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:25,180
where like everyone they were saying like, and guess what?

819
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:29,380
The lagoon in front of the castle is going to have two fountains in it.

820
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:32,740
And I saw a video of when I was there earlier in the year.

821
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:36,580
And I just kind of whipped by the fountain like this was a brag.

822
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:38,620
This is where Disney is at.

823
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:40,100
This is one of the only things they have.

824
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,420
Wow. Oh, yeah.

825
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:45,820
Little splashes like a miniature golf course lake would have.

826
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:49,820
Now, did you read the the it's probably years ago at this point.

827
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:54,100
There was an explanation of why the Moana thing was so delayed.

828
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:54,940
I don't know.

829
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:59,580
Which was that during the pandemic, it was difficult to get raw materials,

830
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:01,980
construction materials.

831
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:06,060
So some of the like steel and iron and what have you

832
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:09,860
that was allocated from Moana like shifted to other projects.

833
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:12,980
What you mean, like Velasco coaster, which they got done in the exact

834
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:15,060
same amount of time incredibly quickly.

835
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:17,300
I yeah.

836
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:21,900
I remember Jim Hill saying like steel girders were like going up in price.

837
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:24,300
Yeah. And Disney maybe didn't want to pay.

838
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:28,500
So I think like stuff got shifted to Tron or, you know,

839
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:33,460
what Tron they delayed it for an extra year to just to the swift build of Tron.

840
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:36,460
Yeah. I excuse I read.

841
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:40,340
And so Disneyland will never be complete as long as there is imagination.

842
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:45,580
Or if we run out of steel, we're just going to leave some things half built.

843
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:48,060
Sorry, you know, the price of steel crazy.

844
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,300
Pantel unprecedented.

845
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:52,780
You just leave the construction walls up long enough in Epcot

846
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:56,940
that you can start selling shirts of the construction walls.

847
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:59,940
You know, actually, some people are nostalgic.

848
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:03,500
Some people are kids are going to remember the construction walls

849
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,460
from their earliest memories. Yeah.

850
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:09,740
Did you finish your thought? I forget.

851
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:12,900
I think so. I was just saying, check out the Bellagio Conservatory.

852
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:17,740
It's always fun and it is open 24 hours a day. Yeah.

853
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:19,780
Like so much of Vegas.

854
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:24,980
Mm hmm. Yeah, it is a space you can walk through and I guess you know, so,

855
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:29,780
yeah, I guess that's what you know, it is like a it's a more themed thing

856
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:32,580
than most 24 hour things. It is. Yeah. Yeah.

857
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:34,740
But that's a little like and the lobby.

858
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:38,100
Keep in mind, folks, the lobby open 24 hours a day.

859
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:42,660
Only in Vegas. The cashier, the casino cashier.

860
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:46,300
And in Vegas, the doors do open 24 hours a day.

861
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:48,540
The player, the player's card.

862
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:51,700
They want you to sign up for it whenever you're there.

863
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:53,500
It's miraculous.

864
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,540
Check your windows in your rooms.

865
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:57,580
Try to open them at four in the morning.

866
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:59,660
They will open. It's Vegas, folks.

867
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:01,780
Not all of them. Not all of them.

868
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:05,060
No. And I only recently learned about do you know about

869
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:08,540
the because the hotel casino, the window trick?

870
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:13,260
No. Like they when you look at the Bellagio, it looks like

871
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:15,740
there's all the windows on it.

872
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:18,700
That's actually like two to four rooms.

873
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:21,420
You're seeing those.

874
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:24,260
Like when you're standing at the Bellagio Fountains

875
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:27,340
and you look up at the building, there's all these windows.

876
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,060
But that's a trick.

877
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:31,860
Like that window is one window.

878
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:35,420
One window is the window for like multiple rooms.

879
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:37,420
I see. So what is the trick?

880
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:38,340
Why are they tricking you?

881
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:41,220
You can't open the window, but on the outside, you can't open the window

882
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:42,940
from so far away.

883
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:46,220
I meant the shade, but just to clear that up.

884
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:48,220
But do you do you get what's being said here?

885
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:51,620
I think he's saying that like there'll be five room like there'll be like one,

886
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:53,260
two, three, four rooms.

887
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:56,300
And if you look on the outside, there's a panel that looks like a big window.

888
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,620
And from the outside, you would assume because it's so far away

889
00:39:58,620 --> 00:39:59,820
that that's one room.

890
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:02,460
But in fact, that big panel is covering four rooms.

891
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:06,220
Yeah. And I think there's different reasons for it.

892
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:11,020
I think one reason they like like Caesar's Palace has like six

893
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:13,060
hotel towers at this point.

894
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:15,460
There's some insane number of hotel rooms there.

895
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:18,900
But like Bellagio just looks like this one building,

896
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:21,900
but it's actually also thousands of rooms.

897
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:24,020
I don't know what they gain from this trick.

898
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:28,940
It's to trick you to think like stuff is closer together in Vegas.

899
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,660
Uh huh.

900
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:34,100
I I'm going to declare this trick is a pointless trick.

901
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,260
Why do they do the trick?

902
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:37,940
I don't know. I'm not sure.

903
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:41,580
It's like how casinos like didn't used to have a lot of clocks in them.

904
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:45,020
They were like, didn't have windows for you to see to the outside world.

905
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:49,220
It would make an aesthetic difference on certain buildings.

906
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:51,060
Would it be too busy, are we saying?

907
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:53,300
If there was lots and lots of little windows.

908
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:55,940
It would be smaller and it would give it a different look.

909
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:57,940
It would probably look shittier.

910
00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:01,820
And then there's ones like the winner, the encore, which is like

911
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:04,740
glass, like a big cigarette lighter.

912
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:05,700
It would look like tiny.

913
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:09,300
So, yeah, it would be like like a tic tac toe board versus

914
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:15,420
what's the old Minesweeper or something, you know, like big, big windows

915
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:17,180
versus tiny little ones.

916
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:20,180
Well, it's like it's like an easy Sudoku versus.

917
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:21,580
Yes. Super advanced.

918
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:25,220
And you want people to feel calm and not like overwhelmed by the amount of windows.

919
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,980
Mm hmm. I think I'm guessing Sudoku.

920
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:29,540
Has that ever come up?

921
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:30,660
I believe it is.

922
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:32,820
Let's lay it roll up our sleeves.

923
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:33,460
Roll up our sleeves.

924
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:35,540
We're too far in to go to a complete.

925
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:38,140
One through nine, baby.

926
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:42,140
Yeah, I think that was my it was a nice trip, you know.

927
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:45,300
Well, that's great. I'm glad the sink was the biggest mishap.

928
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:47,300
Yeah. But then you got.

929
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:49,180
And the charge for the late checkout.

930
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:51,700
Mm hmm. And I'm glad he did a thorough job with that snake

931
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:54,300
and he didn't do the lazy man's way out with the drain.

932
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:56,980
Yeah. Yeah. These other watch out if they pull the drain out.

933
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:58,900
He's fucking lazy.

934
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:01,660
Not him, but other people.

935
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:05,980
Yeah, because I did a snake for the kitchen or kitchen for the bathroom recently.

936
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:07,660
And did you buy a snake?

937
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:10,260
Yeah. Well, it's like a snake with like little prongs on it.

938
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:12,580
You ever done that and put it down your shower drain?

939
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:14,580
And it's just the nastiest thing you've ever seen.

940
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:17,460
You almost feel like an animal is going to come up stuck to it.

941
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:19,260
But it doesn't usually.

942
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:20,580
I don't think I mean, it didn't this time.

943
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:22,100
So there was no snake.

944
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:26,900
No, it wasn't real to a styled plant that had gotten very big from bonuses.

945
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:29,620
No, no, not in this instance.

946
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:31,100
OK, let me talk real quick,

947
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:32,980
because because, yeah, I had a mostly pleasant time.

948
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:33,820
A lot of things.

949
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:35,460
I was more tired than I thought I would be.

950
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:36,620
I was going to do a massage.

951
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:38,780
You didn't do that. I was going to do a couple of things.

952
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:42,580
Whatever. I ended up like kind of chilling out more than I thought I would.

953
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:47,700
But I did stop at a thing called Flyover Las Vegas.

954
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:49,780
Oh, I forgot. Yeah. Yeah.

955
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:53,180
And there's not a ton to say about it, but Flyover,

956
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:56,580
which I think a couple of listeners have recommended to us over the years, maybe

957
00:42:57,540 --> 00:43:01,860
is a fake Soren that is next to the Hard Rock Cafe

958
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:04,020
on the main strip of Las Vegas.

959
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:07,900
And these are increasingly common because I talked about doing one in Vancouver,

960
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:09,020
I believe. Yes.

961
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:11,500
So these are around for sure.

962
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:15,620
And yeah, I was walking by it and it was a Sunday afternoon.

963
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:19,300
I had just come from the MGM Grand Dushy Pool Party alone.

964
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:24,380
Oh, and basically, long story short, I got I got in free to that

965
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:27,980
because of the discotheque app, although I also got a coupon handed to me

966
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:29,500
while I was walking to the lobby.

967
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:31,780
I go to a pool party and go to a pool party for free.

968
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:33,940
I was like, yeah, all right.

969
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:34,620
So I went there.

970
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:37,940
And then the thing with the Dushy Pool Party is that they don't have a lot

971
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:38,980
of places for you to sit.

972
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:41,100
They want you to pay a thousand dollars, five hundred dollars

973
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:43,060
to get a cabana or something.

974
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:47,820
And it is unless you really want to commit to going into the water,

975
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:49,780
which it depends how many people are in there.

976
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:54,580
Being solo at these, not the easiest,

977
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:56,900
easiest thing in the world, believe it or not.

978
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:58,260
Did you make friends?

979
00:43:58,260 --> 00:43:59,660
Well, I didn't.

980
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:02,900
I thought about making friends, but then it's like

981
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:05,380
it's a big commitment.

982
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:09,780
It's a lot of energy to sort of try to make friends at the pool party.

983
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:12,820
And a lot of people that are really like jacked there.

984
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:14,540
There's always a couple, especially this one.

985
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:16,380
This was a daytime pool party.

986
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:19,220
This was the was it the mark or no, it's the.

987
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:20,900
Was it wet?

988
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:22,340
Well, they're all wet.

989
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:25,260
But you're asking was the name was the name.

990
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:26,020
It was.

991
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:26,820
Hold on. Let me sorry.

992
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:28,540
I wrote it down and I completely blanked.

993
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:29,580
It was. Yes.

994
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:33,820
Wet Republic, public wet Republic Ultra Pool, OK,

995
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:35,100
which is a cool name, by the way.

996
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:37,060
Ultra Pool is awesome.

997
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:38,420
That part specifically.

998
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:41,660
And you are on the hollowed ground.

999
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:45,180
You are where the MGM Grand Adventure is used to be.

1000
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:47,380
Oh, yeah. That is a very important place.

1001
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:51,060
Yeah. In the footprints of the mediocre sounding.

1002
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:53,340
Yes. Placeholder theme park.

1003
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:56,420
I had bought some bad flip flops at a Target in the middle of like

1004
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:59,860
a desert target on the way from San Diego to Las Vegas.

1005
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:04,340
And I wore them from New York, New York across the street to MGM Grand.

1006
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:08,420
You were you were flip flops on on the hot day.

1007
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:12,260
They were like elevated flip flops, but they were the least comfortable

1008
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:13,540
shoes I've ever worn in my life.

1009
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:15,260
So my feet are like throbbing.

1010
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:16,300
My God.

1011
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:17,940
So I get here. I go over.

1012
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:21,260
I have like a drink and you walk through New York, New York to the back.

1013
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:23,780
It's not as close as you would think it is.

1014
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:26,180
Even though it's actually farther away.

1015
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:29,020
Maybe the longest point away from the entrance.

1016
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:31,860
Yes, that is 100 percent correct.

1017
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:33,500
So my feet, I was like, this sucks.

1018
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:34,740
I should have just bought shoes.

1019
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:37,660
I should have bought like three hundred dollar shoes at some MGM

1020
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:41,940
Grand store or something and just wore like loafers back to the other hotel.

1021
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:43,380
I got them soaking wet.

1022
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:45,220
Yeah, I got them wet.

1023
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:51,660
There there is a smaller like city target next to the fly away Vegas.

1024
00:45:52,340 --> 00:45:53,340
Yeah, yeah, for sure.

1025
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:54,500
I should have gone over there.

1026
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:57,460
But at that point, it was like I was almost back and I was like, just whatever.

1027
00:45:57,460 --> 00:45:59,500
And I am the damage to my feet at this point.

1028
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:02,980
I know it's a limited selection because once I was a little buzzed

1029
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:06,020
and went in there looking for toys, I went in there.

1030
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:08,900
Oh, they don't have toys in Vegas.

1031
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:11,100
Yeah, it was a little in the city targets.

1032
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:12,660
The selections are very well.

1033
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:14,660
I didn't know it was a city target.

1034
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:17,540
It's hard to see how big it is from the distance.

1035
00:46:17,540 --> 00:46:20,420
There is no way that could have been big.

1036
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:22,220
Sometimes they will still have a toy section in the city.

1037
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:24,980
Target. It's just it's just you're not getting adult collectible.

1038
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:25,940
So you're not going to neck.

1039
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:27,460
You're not getting supers.

1040
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:29,180
Well, you might get a little super seven.

1041
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:32,580
The level of comfort, the constant reference to the apps

1042
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:34,820
and the specifics of the app that I've never played.

1043
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:37,220
The difference between Target and City Target.

1044
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:39,260
I've never heard this in my life. Really?

1045
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:41,220
City Target.

1046
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:42,660
There's a city target right over here.

1047
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:44,740
It's the one on Hollywood Way.

1048
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:46,620
Localizing. Yes. Yeah.

1049
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:50,180
And it's a smaller target than the regular targets.

1050
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:52,380
Yeah. It does not have a robust selection.

1051
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:54,420
Does it say City Target on the outside?

1052
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:56,300
In some places it does.

1053
00:46:56,300 --> 00:47:00,420
I think there's one you can see a sign in downtown LA might say.

1054
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:01,180
There's one.

1055
00:47:01,180 --> 00:47:06,740
So you would know as long as you saw one out of the 10 of them that say it on it.

1056
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:10,300
Jane and I just called the small one in Burbank, tiny target

1057
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:13,020
to differentiate from the very large target.

1058
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:13,660
They don't. Yeah.

1059
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:17,340
So basically the regular targets are.

1060
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:18,980
By the way, I should not have asked this.

1061
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:20,340
No, but you needed to know.

1062
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:22,980
I should have been realized I was heading down a seven minute

1063
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:25,140
avalanche of target difference questions.

1064
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:29,380
Teacher, teacher, I need an education is what you said in so many words.

1065
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:32,780
A regular, you know, you've seen a regular target, the one in the Empire Center.

1066
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:34,300
It's a big target.

1067
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:35,460
You get a big building.

1068
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:38,740
But if you see these other targets, you can see that they're like

1069
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:40,540
the ceiling is not as high, the building.

1070
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:44,500
And usually it's kind of like stuck as part of like something else.

1071
00:47:44,540 --> 00:47:47,260
I'm aware that there are big targets and small targets.

1072
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:50,260
The comfort with the phrase city target,

1073
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:53,780
you know, because they can plug it in like a city block somewhere

1074
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:56,260
and they can sort of just give you the essentials of what you would need

1075
00:47:56,260 --> 00:47:59,420
out of a target versus am I supposed to be familiar with this phrase?

1076
00:47:59,420 --> 00:48:02,020
If they don't, they don't use it consistently.

1077
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:04,340
And why are you guys so aware of the website?

1078
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:05,460
I think they use it.

1079
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:07,620
The target, you know, it's just one of the city targets.

1080
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:12,140
If you look up, you know, I follow retail trends a little recreationally

1081
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:15,060
every now and then, you know, I don't.

1082
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:19,540
For some reason, I just this is a word that has entered my lexicon.

1083
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:22,580
Con. Yeah. And so I don't.

1084
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:25,620
I really don't actually have a good explanation where it came from or when I heard it

1085
00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:30,740
or if it's official, what target would prefer you referred to these tiny targets as?

1086
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:33,380
Because maybe they like tiny target better at this point.

1087
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:34,260
I don't know.

1088
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:37,020
I mean, if their official branding is city target,

1089
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:41,020
but yeah, well, at a certain point there, they referred to things as city target.

1090
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:42,700
That is not where Jason and I both know.

1091
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:45,180
I know you're not hired to some extent.

1092
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:47,180
Yeah. Now, maybe they don't call it that anymore.

1093
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:48,820
Maybe they don't like branding at that.

1094
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:52,220
Maybe they should call it little target, little target, little target.

1095
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:53,540
Yeah. He's kind of bigger.

1096
00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:56,420
Target Junior hit the T's hard, baby.

1097
00:48:56,420 --> 00:48:57,300
Target.

1098
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:03,500
Target with the I guess, you know, I kind of like target.

1099
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:05,900
Are you going to target or target?

1100
00:49:06,140 --> 00:49:08,660
It's like I was, you know, I'm driving by Targs.

1101
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:10,500
Targs is just a no-frills.

1102
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:12,780
I need like a big decorative wicker basket.

1103
00:49:13,060 --> 00:49:15,660
I'm going to target. They don't have the home goods section.

1104
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:17,220
They do it or full target.

1105
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:18,460
Yeah. It's just target.

1106
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:21,700
And if it's just like a kiosk in a mall and it's just tar.

1107
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:24,460
It's just tar at that point. Yeah, yeah, it's just tar. Right.

1108
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:29,180
So anyway, it's good to know, though, that they don't have toys for the future

1109
00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:31,980
for me on the at the city target in Las Vegas.

1110
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:34,180
And you're like you're on this year, you're out on this year,

1111
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:36,700
you live in it up in Vegas and you know what's going to hit hard right now?

1112
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:38,620
A toy. You know what?

1113
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:42,460
At the same target I was in the desert, I was at Desert Hot Springs.

1114
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:44,500
I forget which target it was.

1115
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:46,980
And this is a desert target as opposed to a city target.

1116
00:49:47,180 --> 00:49:51,220
This was yeah, this is a desert target, which is unofficial name for

1117
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:53,940
Tundra Target, Forest Target.

1118
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:56,500
That's just my name. They all change based on the locale.

1119
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:58,700
Yeah, that's not corporate branding.

1120
00:49:58,860 --> 00:50:00,420
That's just what I'm calling it.

1121
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:01,820
But I call it Desert Target.

1122
00:50:01,820 --> 00:50:07,020
They I went up and I found the new McFarland Batman 66 Batgirl toy,

1123
00:50:07,220 --> 00:50:12,060
which does not have the Yvonne Craig likeness because the family is the estate

1124
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:13,140
wanted too much money.

1125
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:16,180
So they just use the likeness from the comic they've made of Batman 66.

1126
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:18,540
And I saw this and I was like, got to get it. This is great.

1127
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:22,300
I got my flip flops. I got my Batgirl toy and I scanned it.

1128
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:27,260
And a message came up that this is this is not able to be sold.

1129
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:29,660
This is breaking street date for the toy.

1130
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:31,260
And it was confiscated from me.

1131
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:37,460
And I was not able to purchase it by like a surly desert target security guy.

1132
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:42,060
Yeah, like wrapped in like big, like big whatever, like cloth and stuff

1133
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:43,980
to keep them safe from the elements.

1134
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:46,780
Look, maybe in a lawless city target, this would fly.

1135
00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:50,540
Right. We'd do things a little different here in Desert Target.

1136
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:53,100
Yeah. So I was not able to get that Batgirl toy,

1137
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:56,860
but I did get the shitty flip flops that hurt my feet.

1138
00:50:57,860 --> 00:51:00,580
So it get to ruin your body. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1139
00:51:00,580 --> 00:51:05,100
In a hundred and twelve degree weather to go to a pool party by yourself.

1140
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:08,860
I went to the pool party by myself and I sat on the cubbies

1141
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:12,300
where you can put your shoes for a while because that was the best option to sit.

1142
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:16,380
And I looked around and I went over to the bar.

1143
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:19,420
I went over the bar walking over a mile for.

1144
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:22,740
And then a guy with a nightstick beat the shit out of you

1145
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:25,100
because you just had the worst vibes.

1146
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:28,420
There's no way I ever have the worst vibes at a Vegas pool.

1147
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:29,860
Well, that's true.

1148
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:32,740
Even if I had a bad vibe.

1149
00:51:32,740 --> 00:51:34,580
So, you know, I went there too, because I was like,

1150
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:37,340
I don't know if I'm going to feel like going to the night pool party,

1151
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:39,700
which I've been talking about for weeks just because I was feeling tired.

1152
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:42,020
So I was like, I'll go over here and at least I'll give it a report.

1153
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:45,140
And I'm sitting on like the shoe, the shoe cubbies.

1154
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:47,100
And I'm like, I'm drinking like a beer.

1155
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:50,780
I had one beer and I was like, this happens sometimes where I go,

1156
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:52,980
do I know anybody here?

1157
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:56,500
Maybe I know somebody and I walk around and I'm like, well, no, you don't know.

1158
00:51:57,260 --> 00:51:59,380
Not really, but there's always part of you that's just like,

1159
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:00,300
maybe I know somebody.

1160
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:02,620
And I'm like walking by and I'm looking at the cat command is I'm like,

1161
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:06,340
don't know those people, don't know these people looking around.

1162
00:52:06,340 --> 00:52:08,420
And then like the pool is like a little too full.

1163
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:11,700
And I have like all my shit and they want to they want like sixty dollars for lockers.

1164
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:16,820
And I'm like, I don't I don't want to go in that pool for sixty dollars,

1165
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:19,620
essentially, to leave all my shit possibly staying.

1166
00:52:19,620 --> 00:52:22,620
Yeah. Even if I stay for an hour, it's like I could go to the other pool

1167
00:52:22,620 --> 00:52:24,940
and do that for free.

1168
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:29,580
So I basically, oh, yeah, I forgot sunscreen.

1169
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:31,180
Oh, my God.

1170
00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:33,820
That's my I forgot sunscreen.

1171
00:52:33,820 --> 00:52:36,180
Also, this is I was just really out of it on Sunday.

1172
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:39,100
And I went up and bought sunscreen,

1173
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:44,180
which I'll let you guys guess how much a douchey

1174
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:48,900
Vegas pool party charges for the spray sunscreen for sprays.

1175
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:51,620
Spray is actually helpful because I feel like it's a down a little bit.

1176
00:52:51,620 --> 00:52:54,900
But that makes it maybe to me forty five.

1177
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:58,500
Jason, I'll do I'll do prices right rules here.

1178
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:02,500
I'll go lower. I'll say 30.

1179
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:04,460
Jason, what's thirty seven dollars?

1180
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:06,540
Wow. Right in the middle.

1181
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:10,380
For some reason, I was like, it's like probably twenty five bucks and like thirty seven.

1182
00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:12,020
And I was like, that's really funny.

1183
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:15,740
You're painting a great picture of the cost ecosystem.

1184
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:18,420
Yes. So she Vegas pool. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1185
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:19,380
So I was I laughed.

1186
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:22,300
I walked around a little bit more and I was like, all right, I think I should go.

1187
00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:23,580
And then I left.

1188
00:53:23,580 --> 00:53:26,260
I did the long walk back through the casino.

1189
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:28,420
A longer walk than you were there for.

1190
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:29,980
Yeah, yeah. Longer than I was there for.

1191
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:34,580
And I was walking down the street and I went, oh, the fly over the fake soaring.

1192
00:53:34,580 --> 00:53:37,300
I go, you know what? Wait, sir, you're still in the flip flops.

1193
00:53:37,460 --> 00:53:39,540
Yes. Oh, my God. Yeah.

1194
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:42,900
So you in the in the immense heat. Yes.

1195
00:53:44,980 --> 00:53:48,020
In horrible shoes, you go to do a ride.

1196
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:51,900
Exactly. That's also that's a zone with like no shade to get over there.

1197
00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:53,820
Because we avoided that area.

1198
00:53:53,820 --> 00:53:58,460
That's like we're talking like where the it's with the former RIP.

1199
00:53:58,620 --> 00:53:59,740
It's still the M&M store.

1200
00:53:59,740 --> 00:54:02,260
But I lost my M&M Vegas, the movie. Right.

1201
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:04,340
Yes. So so I did that.

1202
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:07,620
It's it's not that was not such a bad walk from the outside MGM to this,

1203
00:54:07,620 --> 00:54:09,980
but it's still very awful heat.

1204
00:54:11,180 --> 00:54:12,180
And I was like, you know what?

1205
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:14,420
Maybe would cheer me because I wasn't feeling like bad or anything.

1206
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:17,100
I was just like, oh, that was kind of a waste.

1207
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:18,980
I go, maybe a ride.

1208
00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:21,020
Maybe I could do a ride right now.

1209
00:54:21,020 --> 00:54:26,140
So I walk in and you get the immediately like the theme park, cold air blast.

1210
00:54:26,340 --> 00:54:28,500
That's good. And the media, you feel good.

1211
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:30,540
I feel good. I go, who that?

1212
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:32,180
And there's a lot like neon lights.

1213
00:54:32,180 --> 00:54:35,460
Everything in there was like fairly clean for some Vegas thing.

1214
00:54:35,540 --> 00:54:37,060
Yeah. Which I was surprised by.

1215
00:54:37,060 --> 00:54:38,500
I don't know why.

1216
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:41,060
I guess because it's Vegas and pretty dirty to.

1217
00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:42,380
Yeah, that helps.

1218
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:44,940
So like no one's in there.

1219
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:47,380
It's empty. It's almost empty.

1220
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:49,740
Wow. And I go up and I go, I'll do one of these.

1221
00:54:49,740 --> 00:54:51,620
And there's like three different destinations.

1222
00:54:51,620 --> 00:54:53,500
And she's like, oh, yeah, OK, what do you want?

1223
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:56,740
It's like thirty eight dollars, which is a little pricey.

1224
00:54:56,740 --> 00:54:59,340
But OK, whatever. Vegas. One ride.

1225
00:54:59,340 --> 00:55:01,100
And I'm like, well, what's the best destination?

1226
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:05,060
She goes, well, Iceland is what is our favorite customers favorite.

1227
00:55:05,060 --> 00:55:06,420
I go, well, that's what I got to do then.

1228
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:09,980
I'm so confused. This isn't Las Vegas, because I'm aware of these.

1229
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:14,460
Like the one I did in Canada was like Soarin over Canada, whatever the fly over Canada.

1230
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:17,460
So this is just you're in Vegas, but go wherever.

1231
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:21,380
Yes, because really, what would be the Soarin over Las Vegas?

1232
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:27,220
I mean, the rare sight of the of the strip from the sky.

1233
00:55:27,220 --> 00:55:32,500
Yeah. Where can you see this other than in thousands and thousands of iterations

1234
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:36,860
in every stock video library and reality show that goes to Las?

1235
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:40,300
Well, I would expect strip from the sky Hoover Dam.

1236
00:55:41,420 --> 00:55:44,300
That is Grand Canyon for sure.

1237
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:49,820
They could have at least just ended in Vegas, like how Soarin ends at Disneyland, where you are.

1238
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:52,180
Yeah. So Iceland and then a little hit of Vegas.

1239
00:55:52,220 --> 00:55:56,700
Yeah. So I went into like this big lobby area and I'm like, oh my God, this place is huge.

1240
00:55:56,740 --> 00:56:00,100
This is huge. They have like two theaters, I think, maybe more.

1241
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:02,980
And there's a bar in the back.

1242
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:07,100
Oh, and there's just a massive area to like hang out and wait for your tickets,

1243
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:09,780
your your your flights to be called.

1244
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:13,020
And they have like kind of like little marquees.

1245
00:56:13,020 --> 00:56:14,860
I don't know if this is the one in Canada.

1246
00:56:14,860 --> 00:56:19,220
They have almost like little marquees, like movie theaters, like with a like digital time.

1247
00:56:19,220 --> 00:56:23,940
And you know what I actually was wondering if this is the former location of the Regal

1248
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:28,780
Theater that was there where I saw, I think it might be where I saw Jurassic World

1249
00:56:28,780 --> 00:56:32,580
and was very forgiving of it because I just had a free beer and burger.

1250
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:35,780
For me, I was oddly light on.

1251
00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:37,860
Yeah, I was just in such a good mood.

1252
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:42,580
And the the Lost Cactus is the name of the bar and lounge there.

1253
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:45,380
And I was like, already, I'm like, OK.

1254
00:56:45,380 --> 00:56:49,180
And I kept getting it kept like impressing me a little more because I almost expected

1255
00:56:49,180 --> 00:56:53,740
them to go, here you go, open up like a creaky door and I walk right on to like a seat

1256
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:55,260
and then do the thing.

1257
00:56:55,260 --> 00:56:57,220
But there's like all this waiting around and whatever.

1258
00:56:57,420 --> 00:56:59,540
And then I go in there.

1259
00:56:59,820 --> 00:57:01,900
I think I had a drink, too. I forget.

1260
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:04,380
Oh, I know. I had a drink from MGM.

1261
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:07,500
I was drinking it as I walked, which also makes you feel good.

1262
00:57:08,180 --> 00:57:10,700
Drinking out in public. Sure.

1263
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:13,500
So I go in there and pre show.

1264
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:18,100
Oh, oh, and I was like, OK, here we go.

1265
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:20,740
Pretty sure because again, I thought we were going right into the chairs

1266
00:57:21,140 --> 00:57:25,860
for the fake soren and it's got like the there's like a big circle sort of screen

1267
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:29,940
and it's dark in there and there's a voice like this that's talking.

1268
00:57:31,340 --> 00:57:35,740
Whatever. And it's like doing this and like, welcome to Iceland or whatever.

1269
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:38,060
And you're like, OK, yeah.

1270
00:57:38,060 --> 00:57:42,420
And I was like, really, I'm starting to get like really excited about this.

1271
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:44,660
This is cool. Yes, it is Maelstrom.

1272
00:57:44,980 --> 00:57:46,900
So and I'm trying to remember the order of events.

1273
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:49,100
So we so it like it's just explaining there's like a wood.

1274
00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:52,540
I think it starts with almost a static shot of a log cabin.

1275
00:57:52,540 --> 00:57:56,620
And there's like a little crackling fire, which is, of course, very great aesthetic

1276
00:57:56,700 --> 00:58:00,540
and a great like theme park ambience noise. Sure.

1277
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:03,700
And then there's this like, oh, welcome, blah, blah, blah, whatever.

1278
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:05,780
I should have recorded it. That was a mistake not to.

1279
00:58:06,620 --> 00:58:08,940
And then I can't remember what happened.

1280
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:11,540
I can't remember the order of events, but essentially this part like ends.

1281
00:58:11,660 --> 00:58:15,100
We go into another room for a second pre show, two pre shows.

1282
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:17,780
Oh, my God. Now I'm feeling great. Wow.

1283
00:58:17,820 --> 00:58:18,940
And this is like a pre show.

1284
00:58:18,940 --> 00:58:20,620
I don't know if you've ever been to like a it's usually like,

1285
00:58:20,620 --> 00:58:23,060
I think at a museum or something as you go.

1286
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:27,100
And there's like we all crowd around like a circle, like it's almost a circle theater

1287
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:33,100
with like a bar like I don't know what I'm blanking on, what this is called.

1288
00:58:33,380 --> 00:58:35,540
Basically, there's a there's a screen in the middle.

1289
00:58:35,540 --> 00:58:37,300
A porthole almost. Yes. Thank you.

1290
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:40,260
There you go. And it's like you're looking down and it's kind of like a screenish

1291
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:42,900
thing in the ground. And then there's a big screen in the middle.

1292
00:58:43,180 --> 00:58:46,580
And then like there's just, you know, bars to keep you from falling over.

1293
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:48,620
And you can like lean in the back or whatever.

1294
00:58:48,620 --> 00:58:52,300
And then there's more talk and there's a little like hint of what you're going to see.

1295
00:58:52,460 --> 00:58:54,300
And then the voice. Oh, the voice.

1296
00:58:54,620 --> 00:58:59,780
And then an original character appears like a CGI troll lady, like an old,

1297
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:04,500
no offense, old hag troll lady, which was very exciting.

1298
00:59:04,860 --> 00:59:08,460
And she's like she appears once and I was like, oh, wait, oh, who's that?

1299
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:10,820
I don't think she introduced herself, but I was very excited.

1300
00:59:10,820 --> 00:59:13,780
And I don't know that there's any footage of her online,

1301
00:59:14,140 --> 00:59:16,660
but they have original flyover characters.

1302
00:59:17,420 --> 00:59:21,060
I looked to my right, everyone's face, nothing blank.

1303
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:22,940
The only one who cares. Only one who cares.

1304
00:59:22,940 --> 00:59:25,860
But they were doing like cool effects like they'd show magma and like the ground

1305
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:28,660
would be like orange and it would light up.

1306
00:59:28,700 --> 00:59:33,460
And then we went into the theater and then it's it feels like you're in a weird

1307
00:59:33,460 --> 00:59:37,380
nightmare dream going on Soren essentially where like things aren't quite right.

1308
00:59:37,580 --> 00:59:39,220
Yeah. And I don't mean that.

1309
00:59:39,220 --> 00:59:41,140
They pretty much ripped off the mechanism.

1310
00:59:41,140 --> 00:59:44,740
It's exactly like Soren. It's just it's not quite like a little smaller.

1311
00:59:44,740 --> 00:59:47,140
It's like whenever you have a dream or you're going to a familiar place,

1312
00:59:47,140 --> 00:59:49,020
but everything's like a little off. Yeah.

1313
00:59:49,020 --> 00:59:50,300
And it feels weird.

1314
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:53,140
And but this wasn't bad. And like it wasn't I wasn't worried.

1315
00:59:53,140 --> 00:59:56,580
It was going to fall apart. It was just like it's not a big open area.

1316
00:59:56,580 --> 01:00:00,300
Like when you go on Soren and there's three rows or whatever, this is one row.

1317
01:00:00,780 --> 01:00:02,420
I couldn't quite tell the geography.

1318
01:00:02,420 --> 01:00:06,900
I think there might have been the seats under me, but this was not well attended.

1319
01:00:07,100 --> 01:00:10,660
This was not a well attended soaring adventure over Iceland.

1320
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:14,060
But at this point, then you get you.

1321
01:00:14,060 --> 01:00:15,220
It's exactly Soren.

1322
01:00:15,220 --> 01:00:17,500
Also, I should say the pre-show too has the exact same stuff.

1323
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:19,500
You're a little kid. Put the extra thing.

1324
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:23,660
There's a little kid that gives the thumbs up to the person who's explaining,

1325
01:00:23,660 --> 01:00:26,140
who's from Iceland. It's not Patrick Warburton.

1326
01:00:26,140 --> 01:00:27,460
But it's exactly the same thing.

1327
01:00:27,460 --> 01:00:30,660
Like, don't make sure if you're a little writer, like put the thing by your groin

1328
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:33,820
and put the snap through or whatever, whatever Icelandic actor.

1329
01:00:33,860 --> 01:00:35,980
Yeah. Dubbed putty. Right.

1330
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:40,100
And then, yes, it's Soren.

1331
01:00:40,100 --> 01:00:42,780
They stole it. It's so interesting. They stole it.

1332
01:00:42,820 --> 01:00:44,180
It's exactly the same.

1333
01:00:44,180 --> 01:00:47,980
How is Disney allowing notoriously litigious Disney?

1334
01:00:47,980 --> 01:00:50,140
And so strange. It's a good question.

1335
01:00:50,140 --> 01:00:53,900
This is happening all over the country because it was the world technology

1336
01:00:54,340 --> 01:00:55,860
developed by Disney.

1337
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:58,860
And I'm wondering if they're licensing the theater.

1338
01:00:58,860 --> 01:01:00,060
That's very possible.

1339
01:01:00,060 --> 01:01:02,260
The Disney's just making money off of it. Maybe.

1340
01:01:02,260 --> 01:01:04,820
They're like they're not worried about if it's not like competing.

1341
01:01:04,820 --> 01:01:06,780
It's not an Anaheim. Yeah.

1342
01:01:06,780 --> 01:01:07,740
They're not worried about it.

1343
01:01:07,740 --> 01:01:10,580
The show, the video, they're probably just like,

1344
01:01:11,020 --> 01:01:12,460
yes, it's just too who cares?

1345
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:13,820
No one's going to love. Yeah.

1346
01:01:13,820 --> 01:01:15,900
Yeah. So that maybe that's all it is.

1347
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:19,060
And then you get like a 10 minute Soren,

1348
01:01:19,580 --> 01:01:22,860
which that seems like for my recollection of Vancouver one.

1349
01:01:22,860 --> 01:01:24,740
It's like I'm ready to be done.

1350
01:01:24,740 --> 01:01:29,380
I am calibrated to want more like four from the ride that I know.

1351
01:01:29,460 --> 01:01:33,060
Well, it's the thing is there's an amount of tricks that it has

1352
01:01:33,060 --> 01:01:34,940
that it does run through.

1353
01:01:34,940 --> 01:01:36,900
So I wasn't upset to be there for 10 minutes.

1354
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:39,580
But at a certain point, you go that they've done the tricks.

1355
01:01:40,380 --> 01:01:42,780
You get you get hit pretty quickly with all the different tricks,

1356
01:01:42,780 --> 01:01:46,500
like making it feel like you're flying down sort of along with something.

1357
01:01:48,060 --> 01:01:52,300
And yeah, so I wouldn't turn down a 10 minute Soren,

1358
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:55,860
but you certainly get a nice brisk pace.

1359
01:01:56,220 --> 01:01:57,660
Sure. This is what this does.

1360
01:01:57,660 --> 01:01:59,780
This is cool with the real Soren.

1361
01:01:59,780 --> 01:02:01,860
Do you still have your drink where there are a couple?

1362
01:02:01,860 --> 01:02:03,180
No, I was not allowed.

1363
01:02:03,180 --> 01:02:05,060
That would have made everything awesome.

1364
01:02:05,060 --> 01:02:06,620
You could drink on Soren.

1365
01:02:06,620 --> 01:02:07,900
Oh, and the real one, too.

1366
01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:09,700
You could smoke a cigarette on Soren.

1367
01:02:09,700 --> 01:02:12,340
If you smoke weed on Soren. Yeah.

1368
01:02:14,900 --> 01:02:20,020
So the screen is like not quite as good to it's like just a little worse.

1369
01:02:20,020 --> 01:02:23,140
And I was like, I don't know why it's just a little worse.

1370
01:02:23,140 --> 01:02:25,140
It could be better.

1371
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:27,420
And I don't know what it is. Maybe it was like digital more.

1372
01:02:27,420 --> 01:02:30,380
Although the one at Disney is at least I don't know, actually.

1373
01:02:30,460 --> 01:02:32,220
And we have we done enough. We haven't done a Soren.

1374
01:02:32,220 --> 01:02:34,140
No, we have not done Soren. Soren's a big one.

1375
01:02:34,140 --> 01:02:35,860
Soren's a very big one.

1376
01:02:35,860 --> 01:02:37,740
So at this point.

1377
01:02:37,740 --> 01:02:39,180
So anyway, it's great.

1378
01:02:39,180 --> 01:02:41,700
I mean, it's if you like it and you're like a boozy and you're

1379
01:02:41,700 --> 01:02:44,980
it's you're on the right there, I would say go do it like.

1380
01:02:45,180 --> 01:02:46,820
And worth it even with that price.

1381
01:02:46,820 --> 01:02:48,140
I mean, you're just you're just paying a big.

1382
01:02:48,180 --> 01:02:51,100
Yeah, there's probably ways you can get a little cheaper

1383
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:52,700
if you look at those discount sites.

1384
01:02:52,700 --> 01:02:56,420
A pool party sunscreen or you're buying one ticket.

1385
01:02:56,540 --> 01:02:57,220
That's a good point.

1386
01:02:57,220 --> 01:02:59,980
Yeah. Is that saying 37 or something?

1387
01:03:00,380 --> 01:03:03,980
It's either or. So so yeah, you get original characters, you get two pre shows.

1388
01:03:04,380 --> 01:03:06,380
There's a themed bar there.

1389
01:03:06,380 --> 01:03:10,180
It's like you get a little theme park oasis in that really.

1390
01:03:10,180 --> 01:03:13,500
Not a nice screen than the least nice air conditioning.

1391
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:15,100
Yeah. So yeah.

1392
01:03:15,100 --> 01:03:17,540
If you yeah, three different locations, I would do it again.

1393
01:03:17,540 --> 01:03:18,980
I would go back.

1394
01:03:18,980 --> 01:03:20,900
So, huh? Yeah.

1395
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:22,060
It was it's really weird.

1396
01:03:22,060 --> 01:03:24,100
I wish there were more fake Disney rides in Les Vey.

1397
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:25,220
I wish there were more fake.

1398
01:03:25,220 --> 01:03:27,540
All there were there used to be as we've learned.

1399
01:03:27,540 --> 01:03:28,980
Yeah, that's true. All month.

1400
01:03:28,980 --> 01:03:29,900
And you know what?

1401
01:03:29,900 --> 01:03:32,660
And I'm not going to talk about this at length, but

1402
01:03:32,660 --> 01:03:36,740
one of my little in downtime on the last day, I did go to check out

1403
01:03:37,340 --> 01:03:39,980
Club 3 runner up fall of Atlantis.

1404
01:03:39,980 --> 01:03:41,780
Oh, yeah. Just forum shubs.

1405
01:03:41,780 --> 01:03:43,860
This thing was so much better than I thought.

1406
01:03:43,860 --> 01:03:46,780
Really? Yeah. Something I was confusing it with.

1407
01:03:46,780 --> 01:03:49,660
There was a different one at the forum shops, which is what I was

1408
01:03:49,660 --> 01:03:51,820
pushing where like a bunch of statues come to life.

1409
01:03:52,060 --> 01:03:55,180
And there's kind of a big like, be married.

1410
01:03:56,100 --> 01:03:58,860
It's OK, but kind of tedious.

1411
01:03:58,860 --> 01:04:00,580
Yeah, yeah. But this thing.

1412
01:04:00,580 --> 01:04:03,580
Oh, my God. I mean, it's pyro and big fountain splash.

1413
01:04:03,820 --> 01:04:08,180
And the moment when the Cheesecake Factory sign dims

1414
01:04:08,340 --> 01:04:11,180
so that the show can begin, that's really good.

1415
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:15,380
It goes through the atrium in the back of this fancy mall.

1416
01:04:16,340 --> 01:04:18,660
So, you know, I mean, we're going to have to.

1417
01:04:18,660 --> 01:04:21,980
That's something we'll do at some point, whether it's like a bigger

1418
01:04:21,980 --> 01:04:24,940
season's forum shop, sort of becomes a club three again.

1419
01:04:25,540 --> 01:04:28,620
So City Nights two is a question for the audience.

1420
01:04:28,620 --> 01:04:29,540
I think we do too much.

1421
01:04:29,540 --> 01:04:31,540
I think I heard of Vegas or do you want more?

1422
01:04:31,540 --> 01:04:33,340
I mean, there's we did certainly didn't hit it all.

1423
01:04:33,340 --> 01:04:36,060
So we will see.

1424
01:04:36,060 --> 01:04:39,140
And would you want to come to a Groove Blender again?

1425
01:04:39,940 --> 01:04:43,740
Which to that end really quick, just the people who came.

1426
01:04:43,740 --> 01:04:44,700
Thank you so much.

1427
01:04:44,700 --> 01:04:45,860
Oh, yeah. Thank you.

1428
01:04:45,860 --> 01:04:48,300
People came from so far away.

1429
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:52,860
People flew as far as a flyover ride.

1430
01:04:53,180 --> 01:04:58,180
Journey would take you from Iceland to come to the Groove Blender.

1431
01:04:58,780 --> 01:05:00,820
We did get an Alaska.

1432
01:05:00,820 --> 01:05:02,580
Yeah, yeah. And no, people.

1433
01:05:02,580 --> 01:05:04,700
I like, God, I ask.

1434
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:07,260
I not to sound all kiss assy.

1435
01:05:07,260 --> 01:05:10,820
I love our audience and the nice, nice people.

1436
01:05:10,820 --> 01:05:13,140
You lose are you loser with that link?

1437
01:05:13,140 --> 01:05:14,620
You know, you love them.

1438
01:05:14,620 --> 01:05:17,100
I'm going to say, oh, it's gross.

1439
01:05:17,100 --> 01:05:21,620
Nicest people and Eric, by the way, without saying much about it.

1440
01:05:21,620 --> 01:05:25,140
Listen, Eric, who brought us an insane.

1441
01:05:25,140 --> 01:05:26,300
Oh, right, right, right.

1442
01:05:26,300 --> 01:05:29,740
I fully distributed what Eric brought to you.

1443
01:05:29,740 --> 01:05:31,540
Yeah. Thank you, Eric.

1444
01:05:31,540 --> 01:05:33,900
I will I genuinely never forget.

1445
01:05:33,900 --> 01:05:35,260
I would do that. You brought.

1446
01:05:35,260 --> 01:05:38,140
I would do a couples massage with the audience as a whole.

1447
01:05:38,660 --> 01:05:39,380
So it wouldn't be weird.

1448
01:05:39,380 --> 01:05:41,860
So be all does they have to share one bench?

1449
01:05:42,180 --> 01:05:45,140
Yeah, they all have to be on one bench and I have to be on one alone.

1450
01:05:46,820 --> 01:05:48,900
And we asked you don't get to hold hands.

1451
01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:50,380
Yeah. Yeah. No holding hands.

1452
01:05:50,380 --> 01:05:53,780
Yeah. What else are we there?

1453
01:05:54,220 --> 01:05:55,140
I think we're there. Yeah.

1454
01:05:55,140 --> 01:05:57,940
So so basically, yeah, I did the flyover and I was like, OK, I did a little

1455
01:05:57,940 --> 01:06:00,420
I did a little pool party. That's great.

1456
01:06:00,420 --> 01:06:01,900
I did the ride. I go now.

1457
01:06:01,900 --> 01:06:05,740
I now if I don't go to this pool party tonight, I was like, not a big deal.

1458
01:06:05,780 --> 01:06:09,220
Yeah. And I won't worry about it because I can at least address

1459
01:06:09,540 --> 01:06:11,460
the douchey pool party on the show.

1460
01:06:11,460 --> 01:06:13,260
So it's I've already felt covered.

1461
01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:14,780
There's no need necessarily to do it.

1462
01:06:14,780 --> 01:06:17,980
Your thing. Yes. You Vegas the way you Vegas.

1463
01:06:17,980 --> 01:06:20,940
Exactly. So at this point, I go.

1464
01:06:21,740 --> 01:06:24,380
I have dinner with my parents who came to the show.

1465
01:06:24,660 --> 01:06:26,540
Your parents were there. We went to Italy

1466
01:06:27,660 --> 01:06:30,060
because I was like, you know, this best friend plays really good.

1467
01:06:30,060 --> 01:06:32,380
And then it's like, well, what do they have there?

1468
01:06:32,380 --> 01:06:34,500
Oh, yeah. I know the parent.

1469
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:36,420
And I'm like, well, it is curry fries that we had that

1470
01:06:36,420 --> 01:06:38,620
was last time we were there that were amazing.

1471
01:06:39,860 --> 01:06:41,100
Yeah. OK. All right.

1472
01:06:41,100 --> 01:06:42,500
I go, do you want to just go to Italy?

1473
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:46,220
Yeah, maybe we should just go because they have pizza and pasta.

1474
01:06:46,220 --> 01:06:47,740
I think for everyone. Yeah.

1475
01:06:47,740 --> 01:06:50,700
It's the same as having a toddler. Sure.

1476
01:06:50,700 --> 01:06:52,500
Yeah. A certain kind of pair.

1477
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:54,060
Yeah. My mom, not my mom.

1478
01:06:54,060 --> 01:06:55,820
And I would say now my mom either.

1479
01:06:55,820 --> 01:06:57,540
Wow. Yeah, it's dad.

1480
01:06:57,540 --> 01:06:58,660
My dad's of a certain.

1481
01:06:58,660 --> 01:07:00,060
Dad's are much more.

1482
01:07:00,060 --> 01:07:04,140
He would have done it because he feels like I shame him a lot for his eating.

1483
01:07:04,260 --> 01:07:06,820
Oh, so he was done.

1484
01:07:06,820 --> 01:07:07,980
And I really pressed.

1485
01:07:07,980 --> 01:07:10,860
He's got to prove then the way you've like you're told.

1486
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:13,180
You don't like Hans and then you decide you know what?

1487
01:07:13,220 --> 01:07:15,740
I hope he probably be embarrassed if he hears this.

1488
01:07:15,780 --> 01:07:19,300
He thought at first when he got to Italy that he couldn't eat there

1489
01:07:19,540 --> 01:07:22,620
because we said it was bad.

1490
01:07:22,620 --> 01:07:24,460
And then mom goes, yeah, your dad don't want to eat it.

1491
01:07:24,460 --> 01:07:26,660
Italy, because he said, you guys say it's bad.

1492
01:07:26,660 --> 01:07:28,220
So he was he didn't want to look like a fool.

1493
01:07:28,220 --> 01:07:29,700
And I go, what are you talking about?

1494
01:07:29,700 --> 01:07:31,140
I love Italy. No, I know.

1495
01:07:31,140 --> 01:07:32,060
I go. I go. No, no, no.

1496
01:07:32,060 --> 01:07:34,020
All three of us, I think, are big Italy fans.

1497
01:07:34,020 --> 01:07:36,300
And we're trying to figure it out for like hours.

1498
01:07:36,740 --> 01:07:40,340
And then my dad was like, oh, were you talking about Boca?

1499
01:07:40,340 --> 01:07:41,180
Yeah.

1500
01:07:41,780 --> 01:07:43,940
I go, oh, yeah, Boca de Pepe is the worst.

1501
01:07:44,540 --> 01:07:45,940
Yeah. Were you talking about?

1502
01:07:45,940 --> 01:07:47,420
Wait, Jason, fill in the first.

1503
01:07:47,420 --> 01:07:51,100
Pet. Oh, no, you didn't do it.

1504
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:52,580
Oh, my God. You said the wrong.

1505
01:07:52,580 --> 01:07:54,580
Was that on purpose? No.

1506
01:07:54,580 --> 01:07:56,260
I just repeated what Mike said.

1507
01:07:56,260 --> 01:07:58,420
No, you didn't. It's Pepe.

1508
01:07:58,420 --> 01:07:59,820
No, it's not.

1509
01:07:59,820 --> 01:08:01,900
No, Jason. Oh, my God.

1510
01:08:01,900 --> 01:08:03,460
You'd be doing this again.

1511
01:08:03,460 --> 01:08:06,100
I look at a website.

1512
01:08:06,100 --> 01:08:08,460
Look at it in person.

1513
01:08:08,460 --> 01:08:11,100
I can't believe even if we did

1514
01:08:11,300 --> 01:08:15,020
like an unnecessary next round of it.

1515
01:08:15,020 --> 01:08:17,020
And that is so great.

1516
01:08:17,020 --> 01:08:19,580
Yeah. Are you Googling to check?

1517
01:08:19,740 --> 01:08:24,980
Well, I'm I'm the closest one in city walks, so I am just looking.

1518
01:08:25,140 --> 01:08:27,780
Do you think do you do you honestly think in this moment, Jason,

1519
01:08:27,780 --> 01:08:31,180
that you are going to be proven correct after all this that you're going to share?

1520
01:08:31,180 --> 01:08:33,540
Like, well, guys, look what I found.

1521
01:08:33,540 --> 01:08:35,620
You go to Pepo dot com.

1522
01:08:35,620 --> 01:08:37,220
No, I know I'm wrong.

1523
01:08:37,220 --> 01:08:39,820
I wanted to see the correct spelling.

1524
01:08:40,100 --> 01:08:44,340
And the reason was I convinced myself it wasn't Beppo

1525
01:08:44,340 --> 01:08:48,340
because someone set the phrase B poll at some point.

1526
01:08:48,740 --> 01:08:51,740
So I'm like, it must not be the explain this last time.

1527
01:08:51,740 --> 01:08:55,780
And I was more confused by how you got confused.

1528
01:08:56,660 --> 01:09:01,860
The Google Translate used to run it through as B poll.

1529
01:09:02,180 --> 01:09:04,780
Run what through? What is this B poll?

1530
01:09:04,780 --> 01:09:06,940
Run the phrase Bucat to Pet.

1531
01:09:07,020 --> 01:09:08,820
Why were you running it through a translator?

1532
01:09:08,820 --> 01:09:10,500
Someone else did it. Who did it?

1533
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:12,700
I don't know. Someone tweeted it at me.

1534
01:09:12,700 --> 01:09:14,380
This is a long episode. I'm sorry.

1535
01:09:14,380 --> 01:09:15,300
We're going back to the beginning.

1536
01:09:15,300 --> 01:09:17,460
Oh, Scott's doing his work up thing.

1537
01:09:17,460 --> 01:09:21,220
This is going to take 15 minutes.

1538
01:09:21,220 --> 01:09:23,140
Listener, am I wrong?

1539
01:09:23,140 --> 01:09:25,540
Am I wrong, listener?

1540
01:09:25,540 --> 01:09:27,740
OK, start. What is B poll?

1541
01:09:27,740 --> 01:09:31,260
Start from I tell from the here once upon a time.

1542
01:09:31,260 --> 01:09:33,140
Tell the beginning of this story.

1543
01:09:33,140 --> 01:09:35,460
I have never understood B poll.

1544
01:09:35,460 --> 01:09:39,020
OK, so somebody was I'm trying to help here.

1545
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:42,100
It was trying to explain what the meaning of Beppo was,

1546
01:09:42,100 --> 01:09:43,980
because I think the first time we ever discussed this,

1547
01:09:43,980 --> 01:09:46,700
we were trying to figure out what it means.

1548
01:09:46,700 --> 01:09:47,460
Jason, am I correct?

1549
01:09:47,460 --> 01:09:50,380
Type the wrong thing into Google Translate.

1550
01:09:50,780 --> 01:09:53,540
You get Beppo whole.

1551
01:09:53,540 --> 01:09:57,260
OK, and at some point, if you want to, the spellings.

1552
01:09:57,260 --> 01:09:59,900
But what if you type what into Google Translate?

1553
01:09:59,900 --> 01:10:04,540
Type Bucat de Beppo is now was this done initially

1554
01:10:04,540 --> 01:10:06,860
because we wanted to know what the phrase meant?

1555
01:10:06,860 --> 01:10:07,740
That's what I think.

1556
01:10:07,740 --> 01:10:09,220
Yeah, that's what I think is going on.

1557
01:10:09,220 --> 01:10:12,060
OK, so this led you to what?

1558
01:10:12,060 --> 01:10:19,940
So Bucat de Beppo, which is the correct one, says Beppo whole.

1559
01:10:20,740 --> 01:10:25,140
But Bucat de Pepo says Beppo whole.

1560
01:10:25,940 --> 01:10:28,700
I just still get confused.

1561
01:10:28,700 --> 01:10:29,860
Why are you looking?

1562
01:10:29,860 --> 01:10:32,300
Why are you Google Translating the wrong name?

1563
01:10:32,300 --> 01:10:35,380
I'm trying to explain why I got this caught in my head.

1564
01:10:36,660 --> 01:10:40,900
But I still don't understand what would cause you to look up Beppo.

1565
01:10:40,900 --> 01:10:42,620
OK, hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1566
01:10:42,620 --> 01:10:45,340
So Italian is Bucat de Beppo is Italian.

1567
01:10:45,340 --> 01:10:46,900
OK, right?

1568
01:10:46,900 --> 01:10:47,740
I guess.

1569
01:10:47,740 --> 01:10:48,420
Yeah.

1570
01:10:48,420 --> 01:10:53,980
OK, so when you type Bucat de Beppo in for an English to Italian,

1571
01:10:53,980 --> 01:10:55,740
that's what you're talking about?

1572
01:10:55,740 --> 01:10:57,260
Yeah.

1573
01:10:57,260 --> 01:11:00,540
OK, so you type in Bucat de Beppo English to Italian

1574
01:11:00,540 --> 01:11:03,100
and it comes up Bucat de Beppo.

1575
01:11:03,100 --> 01:11:05,220
OK, it just comes up as Bucat de Beppo.

1576
01:11:05,220 --> 01:11:06,180
Is that what you're talking?

1577
01:11:06,180 --> 01:11:06,980
Is there something different?

1578
01:11:06,980 --> 01:11:09,980
I'm getting Beppo whole or Pepo whole.

1579
01:11:09,980 --> 01:11:12,060
Let me see what your phone looks like.

1580
01:11:12,060 --> 01:11:13,620
Yeah, what is the whole?

1581
01:11:13,620 --> 01:11:15,780
I don't know.

1582
01:11:15,780 --> 01:11:17,460
I need to see your phone.

1583
01:11:17,460 --> 01:11:21,740
Do you understand why we have no idea where any of this comes from?

1584
01:11:21,740 --> 01:11:24,540
I just never remember what the correct one is,

1585
01:11:24,540 --> 01:11:27,260
because I have been there one time.

1586
01:11:27,260 --> 01:11:31,300
But we don't go often, but we know the name.

1587
01:11:31,300 --> 01:11:34,220
I don't I understand because you certainly get a Taco Bell,

1588
01:11:34,220 --> 01:11:37,540
but I know it's not Taco Pell.

1589
01:11:37,540 --> 01:11:38,540
Paula Pell and Taco Bell.

1590
01:11:38,540 --> 01:11:40,740
There's one of those every mile.

1591
01:11:40,740 --> 01:11:44,140
Because I understand the sort of getting things stuck.

1592
01:11:44,140 --> 01:11:46,420
I understand that it is just funny.

1593
01:11:46,420 --> 01:11:49,940
And then the direct translation on their website, on Wikipedia,

1594
01:11:49,940 --> 01:11:55,020
says the name is the English is the name roughly translates as Joe's

1595
01:11:55,020 --> 01:11:56,740
small place.

1596
01:11:56,740 --> 01:12:00,900
OK, but why does any of this make you think that it's P and not B?

1597
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:02,100
I don't know.

1598
01:12:02,100 --> 01:12:07,780
I don't because I at some point, the translate said be pole.

1599
01:12:07,780 --> 01:12:11,820
So I was convinced it was never the second B.

1600
01:12:11,820 --> 01:12:15,140
I swear, every time you say people, it means less to me.

1601
01:12:15,140 --> 01:12:19,540
It's atomizing wherever people I think that what is happening here

1602
01:12:19,540 --> 01:12:25,860
is that there is a brain phenomenon where something becomes so like

1603
01:12:25,900 --> 01:12:30,580
you become almost so hyper aware of it that you end up overthinking it,

1604
01:12:30,580 --> 01:12:32,140
which is something I think everybody has had.

1605
01:12:32,140 --> 01:12:35,460
I can't I have had it where I can't think of an example.

1606
01:12:35,460 --> 01:12:36,460
You know what happens to me?

1607
01:12:36,460 --> 01:12:39,540
I don't remember which direction like how do you want your steak done?

1608
01:12:39,540 --> 01:12:42,980
I don't remember like how like which one's less pink and which one.

1609
01:12:42,980 --> 01:12:45,460
I have to recall what it is correctly every time.

1610
01:12:45,460 --> 01:12:47,580
Oh, like you don't know what rare mediums.

1611
01:12:47,580 --> 01:12:49,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's interesting.

1612
01:12:49,340 --> 01:12:52,140
Where like medium the medium is more cooked.

1613
01:12:52,140 --> 01:12:54,740
Yeah, that's I have to like run a little chart in my head.

1614
01:12:54,740 --> 01:12:56,940
I think that's what's obviously going on here.

1615
01:12:56,940 --> 01:12:58,900
It's just funny that it's happened.

1616
01:12:58,900 --> 01:13:03,980
And I will also say only this has never been discussed just out loud regularly.

1617
01:13:03,980 --> 01:13:07,100
It is only deep in episodes that aren't about Bucatabella.

1618
01:13:07,100 --> 01:13:09,860
I'm completely confused about B pole and all of that.

1619
01:13:09,860 --> 01:13:11,420
I don't know where that comes from.

1620
01:13:11,420 --> 01:13:13,300
So my Google Translate look.

1621
01:13:13,300 --> 01:13:15,380
No, no, you just turn it to it. It turned it off.

1622
01:13:15,380 --> 01:13:17,580
It turned into a different page when you showed me the phone.

1623
01:13:17,580 --> 01:13:18,780
Damn it.

1624
01:13:19,700 --> 01:13:22,220
I'm being gaslight by the alphabet people.

1625
01:13:22,220 --> 01:13:23,460
All right. I'm coming back over here.

1626
01:13:23,460 --> 01:13:29,620
I just think you need to like write an essay about why B pole is part of this or part of the confusion.

1627
01:13:29,620 --> 01:13:32,860
Italian detected to English Beppo hole.

1628
01:13:35,340 --> 01:13:36,780
This is a tangent. I just.

1629
01:13:36,780 --> 01:13:38,700
You wrote no, no, you wrote Bucatabella.

1630
01:13:38,700 --> 01:13:42,340
Wait, but Beppo is still the word.

1631
01:13:43,220 --> 01:13:45,860
It's not Pepo. There's no P. So why?

1632
01:13:46,460 --> 01:13:49,620
But if you if you type in the right word.

1633
01:13:50,420 --> 01:13:51,860
That is the right word.

1634
01:13:51,860 --> 01:13:53,260
You typed in Bucatabella.

1635
01:13:53,260 --> 01:13:54,340
That's right. Yeah.

1636
01:13:54,340 --> 01:13:56,860
And it said that hole is the right one.

1637
01:13:56,860 --> 01:14:02,140
So if you type in Pepo, why are you typing a fake word?

1638
01:14:02,140 --> 01:14:05,660
Why are you typing Pepo of where that doesn't exist?

1639
01:14:05,660 --> 01:14:07,500
Here's what I'll say. Here's what happened.

1640
01:14:07,500 --> 01:14:11,780
You were trying to figure this out and you type the wrong thing in.

1641
01:14:11,780 --> 01:14:13,780
And then it said Pepo hole.

1642
01:14:13,780 --> 01:14:17,340
And this is stuck in your head forever and is almost and I use this.

1643
01:14:17,340 --> 01:14:19,660
We were talking about something else unrelated.

1644
01:14:19,660 --> 01:14:22,860
There's a phrase I like that's in medicine and like vaccines

1645
01:14:22,860 --> 01:14:26,420
and stuff called antigenic sin, where the first sort of like,

1646
01:14:26,420 --> 01:14:29,580
so you get a vaccine, you've imprinted now on your immune system

1647
01:14:29,740 --> 01:14:32,300
how it's going to respond to like viruses forever.

1648
01:14:32,540 --> 01:14:35,220
When you saw this, you imprinted in your brain

1649
01:14:35,740 --> 01:14:38,900
like Bucatabella and you'll never be able to say the right thing.

1650
01:14:39,180 --> 01:14:41,380
It's literally permanently learned.

1651
01:14:41,380 --> 01:14:44,340
Permanently. That's my antigenic sin.

1652
01:14:44,580 --> 01:14:45,540
That's what I'm saying.

1653
01:14:45,540 --> 01:14:48,220
I have never heard you say the phrase antigenic.

1654
01:14:48,220 --> 01:14:50,300
I said it to Scott about something else a couple of months ago,

1655
01:14:50,300 --> 01:14:52,100
and he reacted in a like, oh, what are you?

1656
01:14:52,100 --> 01:14:54,380
What fucking weird thing are you talking about?

1657
01:14:54,380 --> 01:14:56,820
That sounds like something I would not want to hear more about.

1658
01:14:56,820 --> 01:14:57,860
Of course.

1659
01:14:57,860 --> 01:15:01,500
So essentially your brain is now learned Pepo and there's no going back.

1660
01:15:01,580 --> 01:15:03,060
No, there is never ever.

1661
01:15:03,060 --> 01:15:05,540
Maybe now you could say it and it would be right.

1662
01:15:05,540 --> 01:15:07,100
But I'm not even sure.

1663
01:15:07,100 --> 01:15:10,820
I think this is a microcosm of how like how flat earth thing happens.

1664
01:15:10,900 --> 01:15:12,620
Yeah, maybe. Yeah, sure.

1665
01:15:12,620 --> 01:15:14,420
You learn to genuinely believe.

1666
01:15:14,420 --> 01:15:17,700
Could you could you do know what it is right now?

1667
01:15:18,500 --> 01:15:21,380
Now I know it's that.

1668
01:15:22,220 --> 01:15:24,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1669
01:15:24,460 --> 01:15:26,100
Yes, great.

1670
01:15:26,100 --> 01:15:29,700
So we'll see in a couple of weeks if the long term

1671
01:15:29,700 --> 01:15:33,700
was that the surprise quiz is the organic, which it does on the show.

1672
01:15:33,980 --> 01:15:37,620
Just a little test tube of adrenochrome, you know,

1673
01:15:38,340 --> 01:15:41,580
that's how flat earth thing, you know, you know, the sound of freedom

1674
01:15:41,580 --> 01:15:43,700
and you drink a little endocrine cocktail.

1675
01:15:43,700 --> 01:15:46,060
I get you there. I bail out Fabian.

1676
01:15:46,260 --> 01:15:48,060
The bruiser was arrested.

1677
01:15:48,060 --> 01:15:49,860
I bail him out. You can reset.

1678
01:15:49,860 --> 01:15:53,660
Yeah, you can regrow the part of your brain that's permanently learned Pepo.

1679
01:15:53,740 --> 01:15:55,100
Yeah. Wow.

1680
01:15:55,100 --> 01:15:57,060
Now all it takes is flipping it around.

1681
01:15:57,060 --> 01:15:58,860
You just got to turn a letter around.

1682
01:15:58,860 --> 01:15:59,980
Oh, my God. Wow.

1683
01:15:59,980 --> 01:16:01,420
That was unreal.

1684
01:16:01,420 --> 01:16:05,420
This is our we still aren't the actual real topic.

1685
01:16:05,500 --> 01:16:06,780
Oh, my God. This would be I go in.

1686
01:16:06,780 --> 01:16:08,460
This is when we can knock out in like an hour.

1687
01:16:08,460 --> 01:16:10,460
I know. Who knew?

1688
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:13,700
You'll be on to know we'd be back in Pepo land.

1689
01:16:13,700 --> 01:16:15,540
Well, it won't be the last time.

1690
01:16:15,540 --> 01:16:17,340
Clearly won't be the last time.

1691
01:16:17,340 --> 01:16:19,780
And Mike's getting sunstroke of pool parties.

1692
01:16:19,780 --> 01:16:22,260
I'm like running the math on.

1693
01:16:22,260 --> 01:16:26,780
I am down bad from sports betting and free play, pushing my luck.

1694
01:16:27,820 --> 01:16:29,740
And bad is how much?

1695
01:16:29,740 --> 01:16:31,580
Hundred hundred bucks.

1696
01:16:31,580 --> 01:16:33,540
Oh, yeah.

1697
01:16:34,180 --> 01:16:36,300
The worst anyone's ever lost.

1698
01:16:36,300 --> 01:16:37,700
Wow. Penny.

1699
01:16:37,700 --> 01:16:39,260
I lost so many pennies.

1700
01:16:39,260 --> 01:16:40,660
I'm going to call it any slot.

1701
01:16:40,660 --> 01:16:42,300
I want it back. I want it back.

1702
01:16:42,300 --> 01:16:43,220
The next boo good.

1703
01:16:43,220 --> 01:16:45,620
A pee hole is what I'm going to be calling it from now on.

1704
01:16:45,740 --> 01:16:47,140
And what's it called, Mike?

1705
01:16:47,140 --> 01:16:49,540
Booga, the be whole.

1706
01:16:49,540 --> 01:16:53,020
No, you got Michael mixed up.

1707
01:16:53,340 --> 01:16:54,100
OK, we're doing it.

1708
01:16:54,100 --> 01:16:57,780
We talked about it so much now that I took a second to remember what it was.

1709
01:16:58,060 --> 01:16:58,900
I know.

1710
01:16:58,900 --> 01:16:59,700
Book of the best.

1711
01:16:59,700 --> 01:17:02,180
Oh, questioning all of it.

1712
01:17:02,180 --> 01:17:04,620
She's going to convince that you're going to all soon.

1713
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:07,100
You and all the listeners and the people who run the restaurant

1714
01:17:07,100 --> 01:17:09,940
are going to know the truth about what their restaurant is called.

1715
01:17:10,060 --> 01:17:12,180
OK, well, it's real quick, Scott.

1716
01:17:12,180 --> 01:17:14,580
I want my hamburger pretty pink.

1717
01:17:14,580 --> 01:17:16,060
What does that mean?

1718
01:17:16,100 --> 01:17:17,260
What would you order?

1719
01:17:17,260 --> 01:17:18,340
Let's say rare.

1720
01:17:18,340 --> 01:17:19,620
Very good. Very good.

1721
01:17:19,620 --> 01:17:20,500
All right. Yeah.

1722
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:22,540
Now, I'm just barely gotten there.

1723
01:17:22,540 --> 01:17:24,700
Hamburgers you probably shouldn't order less.

1724
01:17:24,700 --> 01:17:25,460
No, no, no.

1725
01:17:25,460 --> 01:17:26,420
That's a weird order to make.

1726
01:17:26,420 --> 01:17:28,900
You shouldn't think safer.

1727
01:17:28,900 --> 01:17:30,860
Depends where you're eating, I believe, though.

1728
01:17:30,860 --> 01:17:31,580
I guess.

1729
01:17:31,580 --> 01:17:34,820
Yeah, because like if you go to like when Umami burger was actually good out here,

1730
01:17:34,820 --> 01:17:37,100
you could get one that was pretty pink and pretty pink.

1731
01:17:37,100 --> 01:17:39,100
So if you hit it in that four month window.

1732
01:17:39,100 --> 01:17:41,220
Yeah, it was four months where it was safe to eat that.

1733
01:17:41,940 --> 01:17:43,780
And after that, no, it is pink as you want.

1734
01:17:43,780 --> 01:17:44,980
Nope. OK.

1735
01:17:44,980 --> 01:17:47,020
All right. Let's get to the oh, I'm exhausted.

1736
01:17:47,020 --> 01:17:49,620
But yes, let's actually it's Mount the Hill.

1737
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:55,100
So we went we did a little hang at what's the name of that?

1738
01:17:55,100 --> 01:17:57,580
Like speakeasy kind of little area.

1739
01:17:57,660 --> 01:17:59,020
Is this called Ski Lodge?

1740
01:17:59,020 --> 01:18:00,980
This was this place is called Ski Lodge.

1741
01:18:00,980 --> 01:18:01,340
Right. Yeah.

1742
01:18:01,340 --> 01:18:02,780
The gabris recommendation.

1743
01:18:02,780 --> 01:18:03,660
Thank you, Gabris.

1744
01:18:03,660 --> 01:18:06,140
You had been here about it in the cosmopolitan,

1745
01:18:06,380 --> 01:18:09,700
which he was hyping up to us his place.

1746
01:18:09,700 --> 01:18:10,500
Super Freak.

1747
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:13,300
Oh, is the bigger establishment that I still understand.

1748
01:18:13,300 --> 01:18:18,100
It's like we didn't do it like properly food wonderland.

1749
01:18:18,100 --> 01:18:19,300
I want to do it next time.

1750
01:18:19,300 --> 01:18:23,140
OK, I I went you have to go through it to find the bathroom.

1751
01:18:23,300 --> 01:18:24,940
OK. And it is a loud,

1752
01:18:24,940 --> 01:18:30,180
douchey nightclub that serves like three course Italian food.

1753
01:18:30,340 --> 01:18:34,140
OK, so you can get like a thirty six dollar chicken parmesan

1754
01:18:34,860 --> 01:18:40,140
and just the most like the loudest assault of lights and colors.

1755
01:18:40,700 --> 01:18:44,700
But you can also get the full menu at the ski lodge, which is much chiller.

1756
01:18:44,740 --> 01:18:46,620
But aren't there multiple rooms of it?

1757
01:18:46,620 --> 01:18:47,580
I think so. Yeah.

1758
01:18:47,580 --> 01:18:51,100
Rooms the show had not started yet, so I didn't really see any sword

1759
01:18:51,100 --> 01:18:53,020
squalorers or burlesque.

1760
01:18:54,100 --> 01:18:58,740
Yeah. I would like to fully commit to doing it, but I was eating it eatily.

1761
01:18:59,460 --> 01:19:01,420
Yeah. And so, yeah.

1762
01:19:01,420 --> 01:19:04,780
Yeah. We ran into your parents and we were we were.

1763
01:19:05,020 --> 01:19:07,340
You were all staying in the same hotel. Yeah.

1764
01:19:07,340 --> 01:19:11,380
And we were going to get a cab over to the Cosmopolitan

1765
01:19:11,860 --> 01:19:16,140
where we were meeting everyone and you guys were saying we're going to dinner.

1766
01:19:16,780 --> 01:19:18,580
It's like, OK, they might.

1767
01:19:18,580 --> 01:19:21,220
Yeah, we were running out of running. Yeah.

1768
01:19:21,220 --> 01:19:22,220
So that's yeah.

1769
01:19:22,220 --> 01:19:26,140
So you guys were already over there and I was eating my some kind of sandwich.

1770
01:19:26,860 --> 01:19:28,420
I forget what it was.

1771
01:19:28,420 --> 01:19:29,780
It's an Italian sandwich.

1772
01:19:29,780 --> 01:19:31,300
The sandwiches were good.

1773
01:19:31,300 --> 01:19:32,500
I agree. At Eataly. Yeah.

1774
01:19:32,500 --> 01:19:34,580
Thrilling stuff. Thrilling stuff.

1775
01:19:34,580 --> 01:19:35,780
Painting a picture.

1776
01:19:35,780 --> 01:19:37,500
All right. So it's a fake ski lodge.

1777
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:38,700
It was very neat.

1778
01:19:38,700 --> 01:19:40,740
Done with projection, although we were kind of on the other side,

1779
01:19:40,740 --> 01:19:41,700
so we couldn't see a lot of that.

1780
01:19:41,700 --> 01:19:44,060
But I like that spot. I recommend that spot. Yeah.

1781
01:19:44,900 --> 01:19:48,340
And so but we're there for a while.

1782
01:19:48,340 --> 01:19:52,020
And like and we had a bar and I had a big dinner before.

1783
01:19:52,020 --> 01:19:54,180
But that's a park MGM, which is unbelievable.

1784
01:19:54,180 --> 01:19:55,180
Yeah. Recommend that.

1785
01:19:55,180 --> 01:19:59,420
Very good. Geez, like super romantic and great food ever. Right.

1786
01:19:59,420 --> 01:20:01,780
But the so we're like we're coming in.

1787
01:20:01,780 --> 01:20:03,180
We've been drinking a lot already.

1788
01:20:03,180 --> 01:20:06,740
So we're not like we're teetering on like, what do we do now?

1789
01:20:06,740 --> 01:20:11,820
Yeah. So the fact that you were and we certainly had referred to like

1790
01:20:11,820 --> 01:20:15,620
Aaron was aware of the specter of the Dushy Vegas pool party.

1791
01:20:15,620 --> 01:20:18,380
Right. And she's saying, well, like, well, we're not going to be able to get in.

1792
01:20:18,380 --> 01:20:20,700
And I said, no, no, no. Mike is a checker.

1793
01:20:20,700 --> 01:20:24,660
Yeah. Mike has gotten a bunch of spots on a list already.

1794
01:20:24,660 --> 01:20:30,780
Right. So, you know, if it worked itself out, maybe we could pop into this place.

1795
01:20:30,780 --> 01:20:32,780
Right. I would say the odds were against it.

1796
01:20:32,780 --> 01:20:37,100
Earlier, but after a bunch of fun and drinking and ski lodge, which is great

1797
01:20:37,100 --> 01:20:41,260
with Eva and Doug Jones, our friend who was in town, which was a surprise when

1798
01:20:41,260 --> 01:20:44,300
we got there, now the mood's pretty great.

1799
01:20:44,340 --> 01:20:46,340
We're not wanting to wind it down.

1800
01:20:46,340 --> 01:20:49,940
And it was literally like right that you decided to go to a spot that was

1801
01:20:49,940 --> 01:20:53,420
literally feet away from where this pool party was.

1802
01:20:53,420 --> 01:20:54,660
That's what I didn't know.

1803
01:20:54,660 --> 01:20:55,820
I know it either.

1804
01:20:55,820 --> 01:20:59,900
And I went, oh, my God, Marquis Nightclub, not Marquis Day Club.

1805
01:20:59,900 --> 01:21:01,700
Different thing. When the sun goes down.

1806
01:21:01,700 --> 01:21:04,460
Yeah. Different Marquis all around.

1807
01:21:05,060 --> 01:21:07,220
But the fact that it was right there.

1808
01:21:07,220 --> 01:21:10,420
There. Yeah. Like, oh, well, that seems like, OK.

1809
01:21:10,500 --> 01:21:12,900
The God himself. And you guys had taken off.

1810
01:21:12,900 --> 01:21:14,780
Yeah, we were pretty tired.

1811
01:21:14,780 --> 01:21:20,700
We took off. We ate like appetizers and stuff at the ski lodge.

1812
01:21:20,700 --> 01:21:23,580
We had gotten a late lunch.

1813
01:21:23,580 --> 01:21:25,660
Do you know what noodles and company is?

1814
01:21:25,660 --> 01:21:26,980
Oh, 100 percent I do.

1815
01:21:26,980 --> 01:21:28,460
I had never had it before.

1816
01:21:28,460 --> 01:21:29,420
Jane was so excited.

1817
01:21:29,420 --> 01:21:31,740
We saw it like on the north end of the strip.

1818
01:21:31,740 --> 01:21:34,300
And I'm like, I don't think we're going to want to go out.

1819
01:21:34,900 --> 01:21:37,340
We saw it when we were coming back from Omega Mart.

1820
01:21:37,340 --> 01:21:40,420
And I was like, I don't think we're going to want to take a taxi up to like

1821
01:21:40,420 --> 01:21:42,820
the strap for noodles and company.

1822
01:21:42,820 --> 01:21:45,100
OK, but it was on Postmates.

1823
01:21:45,100 --> 01:21:46,100
So we got it delivered.

1824
01:21:46,100 --> 01:21:47,660
You got a post in Vegas.

1825
01:21:47,660 --> 01:21:49,020
Yeah, we got a post.

1826
01:21:49,020 --> 01:21:50,620
Wow. How did you say this earlier?

1827
01:21:50,620 --> 01:21:53,420
It's like half the price of most of the food in Vegas.

1828
01:21:53,420 --> 01:21:57,620
But I will say the meatballs at the ski lodge were some of the best I ever had.

1829
01:21:57,660 --> 01:21:59,140
Oh, there wasn't bad.

1830
01:21:59,140 --> 01:22:00,820
I mean, not bad. I like noodles and company.

1831
01:22:00,820 --> 01:22:01,980
It's a chain, basically.

1832
01:22:01,980 --> 01:22:05,500
Yeah, it's I have in the Midwest, but they wasn't like just bad pasta.

1833
01:22:05,580 --> 01:22:07,540
Well, no. Well, that maybe is closed.

1834
01:22:07,540 --> 01:22:09,740
You mean that's the no.

1835
01:22:09,740 --> 01:22:11,620
She she was like, I haven't had these.

1836
01:22:11,620 --> 01:22:15,100
Oh, she really wanted noodles coming specifically in the Midwest.

1837
01:22:15,100 --> 01:22:17,460
And it was in Florida when she lived both places.

1838
01:22:17,460 --> 01:22:20,300
So she got that and I got like mac and cheese with like

1839
01:22:20,820 --> 01:22:22,100
chicken cutlet on top.

1840
01:22:22,100 --> 01:22:23,660
And I was like, yeah, this is pretty good.

1841
01:22:23,660 --> 01:22:25,980
How how long did how much was a Postmates?

1842
01:22:26,580 --> 01:22:28,420
I was average Postmates.

1843
01:22:28,420 --> 01:22:31,140
Really? It was like 30 bucks, maybe.

1844
01:22:31,140 --> 01:22:32,980
OK, coupon or something.

1845
01:22:32,980 --> 01:22:34,980
OK, yeah, you always have to use a coupon with one of those.

1846
01:22:35,340 --> 01:22:37,580
Yeah. Yeah. It's great stuff.

1847
01:22:37,580 --> 01:22:43,220
So so anyway, I know what I want to say about what I want to say

1848
01:22:43,660 --> 01:22:47,340
is if somebody's ever thinking about like nightclub or pool party,

1849
01:22:47,740 --> 01:22:50,900
it seems much more daunting than it is now.

1850
01:22:50,940 --> 01:22:52,900
Well, I assume giant hassle.

1851
01:22:52,900 --> 01:22:55,860
It's so basically what it is like there's an app called Discotech

1852
01:22:55,860 --> 01:22:57,780
and there's other places and other apps.

1853
01:22:57,780 --> 01:23:00,740
And basically you also you could go up to the lobby and ask about it.

1854
01:23:01,060 --> 01:23:02,660
And really, the trick is this.

1855
01:23:02,660 --> 01:23:05,340
They want you in before peak times.

1856
01:23:05,380 --> 01:23:08,340
So as long as you get in line and everything's different,

1857
01:23:08,340 --> 01:23:11,620
but like a couple like the first couple hours of whatever the event is

1858
01:23:11,620 --> 01:23:15,420
in the hotel, they want you in there because they want you to sort of pad out

1859
01:23:16,260 --> 01:23:18,660
the the amount of people spending money versus the people

1860
01:23:18,660 --> 01:23:21,140
that are already like in a drop to grand on a cabana.

1861
01:23:21,580 --> 01:23:24,020
Yeah, I want the looky lose out quick.

1862
01:23:24,060 --> 01:23:27,820
Like, yes, you're going to bed, do your little pass and get the fuck out.

1863
01:23:27,820 --> 01:23:30,660
Right. So you can get into almost all of this stuff for free

1864
01:23:30,660 --> 01:23:34,260
if you go at the right time and you do like a little bit of work before.

1865
01:23:34,260 --> 01:23:37,020
And maybe not even because like the person who gave me the free ticket

1866
01:23:37,020 --> 01:23:41,780
to the MGM grand one was feet away from the actual place.

1867
01:23:42,260 --> 01:23:43,300
So they want you in there.

1868
01:23:43,300 --> 01:23:45,860
And it was like there was a cut off at three p.m. for the free tickets.

1869
01:23:46,420 --> 01:23:50,140
So if you ever want to just investigate it, you won't like.

1870
01:23:50,260 --> 01:23:51,980
I think people also think there's going to be like some trick

1871
01:23:51,980 --> 01:23:55,620
where they like make you spend a bunch of money and they will not do that.

1872
01:23:56,100 --> 01:23:57,980
A drink will be insane to buy.

1873
01:23:57,980 --> 01:24:00,500
But that's other than that, like if you ever want to check it out,

1874
01:24:00,500 --> 01:24:02,820
I would recommend doing it and getting on a list and going in.

1875
01:24:02,860 --> 01:24:05,940
Well, I think the daytime, the cutoff is probably three p.m.

1876
01:24:06,220 --> 01:24:07,340
three to six.

1877
01:24:07,340 --> 01:24:10,620
It's more tolerable to be outside in Vegas.

1878
01:24:10,820 --> 01:24:12,380
Sure. In the summer.

1879
01:24:12,380 --> 01:24:14,740
Sometimes they'll have the headliner come then, too,

1880
01:24:14,740 --> 01:24:20,100
if you're coming to see your favorite DJ or you're coming to see Tiesto.

1881
01:24:20,100 --> 01:24:20,660
Yeah, he's coming.

1882
01:24:20,660 --> 01:24:23,340
He's going to play three to six versus like the noon to three.

1883
01:24:23,500 --> 01:24:25,820
Now, why were you excited especially about this?

1884
01:24:25,820 --> 01:24:28,900
You said you were especially excited about DJ.

1885
01:24:28,980 --> 01:24:30,380
Well, it was not DJ Spider.

1886
01:24:30,380 --> 01:24:33,220
I was like I like DJ Spider fine.

1887
01:24:33,780 --> 01:24:37,140
But I was more excited about the fact that it was a nighttime pool party,

1888
01:24:37,140 --> 01:24:41,100
which I've never been to before and I think is the only one on the main strip.

1889
01:24:41,460 --> 01:24:44,180
So I was excited because I like because first of all,

1890
01:24:44,180 --> 01:24:47,700
it's only like 90 degrees at night in Las Vegas at that time.

1891
01:24:48,820 --> 01:24:49,980
And I like being in the pool.

1892
01:24:49,980 --> 01:24:53,460
I like really punishingly loud music.

1893
01:24:53,580 --> 01:24:56,580
And so all of that combined, I was just very interested in it.

1894
01:24:56,580 --> 01:25:00,340
And it's like at the top of the hotel, which is cool, or at least I'm like,

1895
01:25:00,740 --> 01:25:04,820
I don't know if it's a very top of it, but it's on like a deck or like a tower.

1896
01:25:05,020 --> 01:25:07,420
So you have nothing in particular, nothing against,

1897
01:25:07,420 --> 01:25:09,700
but nothing in particular to say about DJ Spider.

1898
01:25:10,100 --> 01:25:12,060
Well, we can talk about what he was playing.

1899
01:25:12,060 --> 01:25:13,100
I think that was him, honestly.

1900
01:25:13,100 --> 01:25:14,220
I don't know.

1901
01:25:14,220 --> 01:25:16,700
But you know, I mean, it's his personality.

1902
01:25:17,140 --> 01:25:18,620
I don't know.

1903
01:25:18,620 --> 01:25:20,060
Do you have anything specific about DJ

1904
01:25:20,060 --> 01:25:22,780
Smiter's personality now that what I had been looking up

1905
01:25:24,100 --> 01:25:27,460
in research times was DJ Snake and that is not who this is.

1906
01:25:27,460 --> 01:25:29,020
Oh, yeah, that's a different.

1907
01:25:29,020 --> 01:25:30,700
I know him on that producer.

1908
01:25:30,700 --> 01:25:34,700
Actually, I suddenly was like, I we were seeing DJ Snake.

1909
01:25:34,700 --> 01:25:38,380
No, we were not. No, just Spider DJ Snake is what?

1910
01:25:38,380 --> 01:25:40,260
Sorry by Justin Bieber, I think.

1911
01:25:40,260 --> 01:25:42,460
I think he's turned down many things.

1912
01:25:42,620 --> 01:25:46,420
So I was very impressed for a minute that we saw the guy did turn down for what.

1913
01:25:46,420 --> 01:25:47,780
But we did not know.

1914
01:25:47,780 --> 01:25:51,220
He might be on a remix of Despacito to the official song.

1915
01:25:51,220 --> 01:25:52,540
I'm sure he is. Hollywood.

1916
01:25:52,540 --> 01:25:54,420
Oh, Despacito was playing somewhere in Vegas.

1917
01:25:54,420 --> 01:25:55,540
And I was like, hell, yes.

1918
01:25:55,540 --> 01:25:57,220
Statistically, any time of day.

1919
01:25:57,220 --> 01:25:58,100
I love this.

1920
01:25:58,100 --> 01:25:59,580
It might have been by flyover.

1921
01:25:59,580 --> 01:26:01,220
That story could have been, oh, you know what?

1922
01:26:01,220 --> 01:26:02,700
A car was going by.

1923
01:26:02,700 --> 01:26:04,980
Yeah. And I was like, hell, yeah, I love cars.

1924
01:26:05,820 --> 01:26:06,460
Vroom, vroom.

1925
01:26:06,460 --> 01:26:09,900
Maybe they'll play the Despacito music video on the sphere.

1926
01:26:10,780 --> 01:26:12,140
The outside of the sphere.

1927
01:26:12,140 --> 01:26:14,420
Oh, that's what I could only imagine.

1928
01:26:14,460 --> 01:26:16,500
So so, yeah, we get into

1929
01:26:17,500 --> 01:26:20,580
we were leaving like and again, it's like feet away from where we were.

1930
01:26:20,780 --> 01:26:24,580
Yeah. And it was just like everyone sort of briefest window in which

1931
01:26:24,580 --> 01:26:26,780
I think we could have been pulled in and we were in.

1932
01:26:26,780 --> 01:26:28,180
Yeah. And it was just we were all for it.

1933
01:26:28,180 --> 01:26:31,420
There's always like a line where you pay because you can't just pay

1934
01:26:31,420 --> 01:26:32,340
and go into these things.

1935
01:26:32,340 --> 01:26:34,980
But again, if you just get out there a little early, you don't have to pay.

1936
01:26:35,220 --> 01:26:37,460
And we went into the VIP line or whatever.

1937
01:26:37,900 --> 01:26:43,340
And it was really this because this becomes you, me, Aaron and.

1938
01:26:43,380 --> 01:26:44,180
Yes. Right. Exactly.

1939
01:26:44,180 --> 01:26:45,740
So there's four of us going.

1940
01:26:45,740 --> 01:26:47,860
And I don't know if you want to say it.

1941
01:26:47,860 --> 01:26:51,340
I thought Aaron would say some funny stuff as we're going into the line.

1942
01:26:51,420 --> 01:26:52,140
I don't know.

1943
01:26:52,140 --> 01:26:54,860
She was there was about like a carding and under.

1944
01:26:55,300 --> 01:26:57,580
I thought she was being. Oh, yeah.

1945
01:26:57,580 --> 01:27:00,900
Making too big of a show of like, I'm a mother.

1946
01:27:00,900 --> 01:27:02,820
Look at me. I'm not.

1947
01:27:02,820 --> 01:27:04,780
Hang on, Aaron. Cut yourself a break.

1948
01:27:04,780 --> 01:27:06,580
Well, yeah, absolutely. Cut yourself a break.

1949
01:27:06,580 --> 01:27:08,420
Great, Aaron. Of course. Yeah.

1950
01:27:08,420 --> 01:27:12,260
But but really what I wanted to say that because I really liked

1951
01:27:12,300 --> 01:27:14,980
what the guy working there who was probably a young guy.

1952
01:27:15,220 --> 01:27:17,100
Oh, you don't know, because there was like a real young.

1953
01:27:17,100 --> 01:27:20,300
There's like a bunch of like mostly young guys, kind of like bouncer types

1954
01:27:20,300 --> 01:27:21,100
or whatever.

1955
01:27:21,100 --> 01:27:23,780
And Aaron says something about being a mother or whatever, being too old

1956
01:27:23,780 --> 01:27:27,100
to go through this. And of course, if we're all four of us are too old

1957
01:27:27,100 --> 01:27:29,340
to probably go to any of this stuff. Sure.

1958
01:27:29,340 --> 01:27:33,940
But this young guy, he goes, you guys are not the oldest people in here.

1959
01:27:35,060 --> 01:27:37,140
And he like kind of whispered it. OK.

1960
01:27:38,140 --> 01:27:41,380
He's like, he's like, he kind of was just like, don't worry.

1961
01:27:42,420 --> 01:27:43,660
Don't worry about it.

1962
01:27:43,660 --> 01:27:46,860
Which kind of reset the bar for us a little bit.

1963
01:27:46,860 --> 01:27:47,460
Yeah. Yeah.

1964
01:27:47,460 --> 01:27:50,580
Let me think that we would not be entering a world that we wouldn't

1965
01:27:50,860 --> 01:27:52,820
even begin to comprehend. Right.

1966
01:27:52,820 --> 01:27:57,220
Yeah. Perhaps Drenched After Dark would not be the most of the moment.

1967
01:27:58,220 --> 01:28:01,460
And like 21 year old thing ever.

1968
01:28:01,460 --> 01:28:03,580
Yeah. Music you've never heard.

1969
01:28:03,580 --> 01:28:06,220
Notes that have not even been invented.

1970
01:28:06,220 --> 01:28:09,180
You want to you understand this shit, old man. Yeah.

1971
01:28:09,180 --> 01:28:11,140
Yeah. Yeah. Music's going to drive you crazy.

1972
01:28:11,140 --> 01:28:13,540
You're going to throw yourself off the roof. Right. Right.

1973
01:28:14,060 --> 01:28:18,260
Hard to tell, though, because like when we got to the Cosmo, like I don't

1974
01:28:18,260 --> 01:28:22,700
I think I just come in from strip level or second level, like

1975
01:28:24,260 --> 01:28:25,780
pedestrian bridge before.

1976
01:28:25,780 --> 01:28:28,660
But like the taxi dropped us off right at the lobby

1977
01:28:28,980 --> 01:28:32,860
and the casino floor and the the floor with the restaurants and everything

1978
01:28:32,860 --> 01:28:36,260
were hopping that night. It was Sunday night.

1979
01:28:36,300 --> 01:28:37,700
But how old was everyone?

1980
01:28:37,700 --> 01:28:39,900
Well, that I mean, that's hard to say.

1981
01:28:39,900 --> 01:28:41,500
I just meant like the vibe.

1982
01:28:41,500 --> 01:28:44,540
I was like, I don't know if everyone's young or old, but this is

1983
01:28:44,980 --> 01:28:48,300
it's much more lively, I think, than other casinos.

1984
01:28:48,540 --> 01:28:50,140
Sure. I make sense.

1985
01:28:50,140 --> 01:28:52,220
The people were like a little more alive in that place.

1986
01:28:52,580 --> 01:28:53,580
Sure. The vibe there.

1987
01:28:53,580 --> 01:28:55,740
It's a party hotel.

1988
01:28:55,740 --> 01:28:59,980
So, yeah, we all we all make it real quick through security.

1989
01:28:59,980 --> 01:29:03,820
And I've described like the wrestling trip I took with Geo and Susser

1990
01:29:03,820 --> 01:29:07,100
and some other people, like when we went into their on the record club

1991
01:29:07,180 --> 01:29:08,460
and Park MGM. Yeah.

1992
01:29:08,460 --> 01:29:11,780
The people there, we got there a little too late and they were trying to keep us out,

1993
01:29:12,060 --> 01:29:14,380
trying to figure out ways to say we couldn't go in.

1994
01:29:14,380 --> 01:29:15,660
And it was like, no, we're on the list.

1995
01:29:15,660 --> 01:29:18,620
Yeah. OK. But dress code, dress code looking shit.

1996
01:29:18,620 --> 01:29:20,140
OK. Yeah, that's fine.

1997
01:29:20,140 --> 01:29:22,620
How many men are with there's six of us.

1998
01:29:23,260 --> 01:29:25,020
OK. Hold on a second.

1999
01:29:25,020 --> 01:29:28,260
And like just quick question, do any of you have a podcast?

2000
01:29:28,780 --> 01:29:33,060
OK. All of you are at least you have one of the rest of you are on them frequently.

2001
01:29:33,060 --> 01:29:34,220
OK. Yeah.

2002
01:29:34,220 --> 01:29:35,500
Fuck out. Yeah.

2003
01:29:35,500 --> 01:29:39,580
That was kind of the vibe when I went to that nightclub to we didn't go to.

2004
01:29:39,860 --> 01:29:42,460
No, we never went together. No, in not not together.

2005
01:29:42,460 --> 01:29:46,180
But like when Jane and I went to on the record once, we were like,

2006
01:29:46,180 --> 01:29:48,620
I they told us they sing at the front desk.

2007
01:29:48,620 --> 01:29:50,420
And the guy was just like,

2008
01:29:50,420 --> 01:29:53,060
ha, here, take a risk.

2009
01:29:53,340 --> 01:29:55,340
Like he was like, that is not correct.

2010
01:29:55,340 --> 01:29:56,900
Whatever they told you is not correct.

2011
01:29:56,900 --> 01:29:58,420
Just go up that escalator.

2012
01:29:58,420 --> 01:30:01,660
That kind of out of a few pre show like a bunch of non holding.

2013
01:30:01,860 --> 01:30:03,300
Yeah, yeah. I bet.

2014
01:30:03,300 --> 01:30:07,820
I bet as these things go on, the clientele get less hip and young.

2015
01:30:08,220 --> 01:30:10,500
Yeah. Yeah. Now, on the record, it really was cool at the time.

2016
01:30:10,500 --> 01:30:14,100
I didn't go on this time, but we saw Questlove DJ like from feet away,

2017
01:30:14,100 --> 01:30:16,620
which is really pretty cool.

2018
01:30:16,620 --> 01:30:18,620
And there's a light up like disco floor and stuff.

2019
01:30:18,620 --> 01:30:21,460
And there's like there's rooms in like a little speakeasy secret room.

2020
01:30:21,460 --> 01:30:24,340
Like that place is real legit cool.

2021
01:30:24,340 --> 01:30:26,620
So yeah, and we speak easy room in there.

2022
01:30:26,620 --> 01:30:29,980
I used to my Vegas reward one screaming like

2023
01:30:30,420 --> 01:30:33,700
I have this coupon for two free drinks.

2024
01:30:34,380 --> 01:30:35,740
That is a lot of room.

2025
01:30:35,740 --> 01:30:36,540
Yes.

2026
01:30:37,540 --> 01:30:39,580
And it worked. No, it did.

2027
01:30:39,580 --> 01:30:43,460
OK. Well, I respect you get when you start flashing this app around.

2028
01:30:43,460 --> 01:30:45,900
Yeah. Town. Yes.

2029
01:30:45,900 --> 01:30:50,020
Does not look like you're at the grocery store and you drop your coupon wallet.

2030
01:30:50,260 --> 01:30:53,100
All of the oh, no, my change is everywhere.

2031
01:30:53,100 --> 01:30:56,500
The free advertiser at Best Friend we used once, I believe,

2032
01:30:56,900 --> 01:31:00,180
elicited the reaction of, yeah, OK.

2033
01:31:02,100 --> 01:31:03,540
And they just wiped it off.

2034
01:31:03,540 --> 01:31:05,900
They were like, yeah, that's fine.

2035
01:31:05,900 --> 01:31:08,420
I only celebrating our bargains.

2036
01:31:08,420 --> 01:31:12,020
I only wanted to go off when we show a coupon.

2037
01:31:13,260 --> 01:31:14,980
Yeah, that would be nice.

2038
01:31:14,980 --> 01:31:17,980
So we but this was we were ushered through security.

2039
01:31:18,020 --> 01:31:20,020
We made it in so quickly.

2040
01:31:20,020 --> 01:31:23,020
I was worried like, oh, there's going to be a little bit of whatever waiting around.

2041
01:31:23,020 --> 01:31:25,700
No, not at all. They were like, yeah, we might have been out.

2042
01:31:25,700 --> 01:31:27,380
You know, then I saw on our end.

2043
01:31:27,380 --> 01:31:30,660
Yes. Yes. So, yeah, the the guy was definitely like, don't worry.

2044
01:31:30,660 --> 01:31:32,340
There's like a lot of old folks in here.

2045
01:31:32,340 --> 01:31:36,420
And then he washered us through and we like did security quickly back there.

2046
01:31:36,420 --> 01:31:40,220
And they threw us in an elevator and we were on our way up.

2047
01:31:40,500 --> 01:31:44,900
Yeah. And at that point, yeah, there's like there's an interior

2048
01:31:44,900 --> 01:31:47,340
like club thing that we walked through.

2049
01:31:47,340 --> 01:31:48,660
But really, I'm in there yet.

2050
01:31:48,660 --> 01:31:50,140
But you're trying to get to the pools.

2051
01:31:50,140 --> 01:31:55,020
But you're trying to go out to the pool because this is drenched after dark.

2052
01:31:55,180 --> 01:31:56,420
Drenched after dark.

2053
01:31:56,420 --> 01:32:00,980
Yeah. I knew you could even I know there was the technology to to drench after.

2054
01:32:00,980 --> 01:32:02,300
That's what I was so excited about.

2055
01:32:02,300 --> 01:32:06,700
So, yeah, we go out into this like kind of smallish, relatively smallish,

2056
01:32:06,700 --> 01:32:09,660
like obviously compared to like the MGM Grand pools or something.

2057
01:32:09,740 --> 01:32:11,340
It was a pretty modest. Yeah.

2058
01:32:11,340 --> 01:32:13,620
This has been a regular pool hotel.

2059
01:32:13,620 --> 01:32:16,020
It's not a sprawling one at all.

2060
01:32:17,260 --> 01:32:20,060
But, you know, good views.

2061
01:32:20,060 --> 01:32:22,380
You got great views, I would say.

2062
01:32:22,380 --> 01:32:24,740
It's kind of on the more kind of like, you know,

2063
01:32:24,740 --> 01:32:27,220
it's the less silly looking part of this.

2064
01:32:27,220 --> 01:32:30,540
It's kind of like city center and looking at the Dara where we're staying.

2065
01:32:30,820 --> 01:32:35,660
You get a great view of a part of the strip that I call the shit stack.

2066
01:32:36,020 --> 01:32:41,700
The shit stack is the big the tower that is all the chain restaurants.

2067
01:32:41,700 --> 01:32:43,220
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2068
01:32:43,220 --> 01:32:45,420
And Rainforest Cafe.

2069
01:32:45,420 --> 01:32:48,060
I feel like Hard Rock was in there, but isn't now.

2070
01:32:48,060 --> 01:32:50,420
You got a Taco Bell Cantina and a subway.

2071
01:32:50,700 --> 01:32:53,420
But I'm missing. I think I think Wild Wings is in there.

2072
01:32:54,300 --> 01:32:57,900
So we've definitely both been to that Taco Bell Cantina.

2073
01:32:57,900 --> 01:33:00,860
Yeah, I would not on this trip, but I've been in twice before, maybe.

2074
01:33:01,980 --> 01:33:04,500
Yeah. Yeah. So like, there's a cool there's a cool view.

2075
01:33:04,500 --> 01:33:07,700
That's a cool spot to sort of the whole shit stack and all.

2076
01:33:07,700 --> 01:33:10,300
Yeah, all lit up. Uh huh.

2077
01:33:10,300 --> 01:33:13,860
And I'm trying to remember other big like, I mean, we weren't in there

2078
01:33:13,860 --> 01:33:18,220
too long before there were some light up girls walking around.

2079
01:33:18,220 --> 01:33:21,580
Yes. And I didn't and I wasn't even telling you guys that oftentimes,

2080
01:33:21,580 --> 01:33:25,260
like, there'll be like some little show, some floor show or something.

2081
01:33:25,260 --> 01:33:30,620
Some light magic pixies walk around like Electro, like Spectro men.

2082
01:33:30,820 --> 01:33:32,660
Yeah. Spectro doll face.

2083
01:33:32,660 --> 01:33:34,300
But not on a float. They're just walking.

2084
01:33:34,300 --> 01:33:37,500
Three or four ladies walk around with just like light tubes

2085
01:33:37,980 --> 01:33:39,500
that are like covering them.

2086
01:33:39,500 --> 01:33:41,540
Sexual Spectro men.

2087
01:33:41,540 --> 01:33:42,940
I mean, it wasn't even that sexual.

2088
01:33:42,940 --> 01:33:45,660
I mean, it was just sort of like more of like a show girl.

2089
01:33:45,940 --> 01:33:47,140
That they are women.

2090
01:33:47,140 --> 01:33:48,660
Sure. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2091
01:33:48,740 --> 01:33:53,700
But it was the standard hotel, a hip spot in L.A.

2092
01:33:53,700 --> 01:33:58,980
used to have people in a a glass cage in the lobby, a glass display.

2093
01:33:59,060 --> 01:34:01,420
They would just sit there and read a book.

2094
01:34:01,420 --> 01:34:03,940
You know that. Well, oh, that's that's weird.

2095
01:34:04,620 --> 01:34:08,300
Was that for like sexy sexiness?

2096
01:34:08,300 --> 01:34:09,460
Was that the book reading?

2097
01:34:09,460 --> 01:34:12,220
I think so. It was just a person.

2098
01:34:12,220 --> 01:34:14,500
Well, Jason thinks reading is sexy. Yeah.

2099
01:34:14,500 --> 01:34:17,220
I it is fundamental for sure.

2100
01:34:18,660 --> 01:34:19,940
And fundamental.

2101
01:34:19,940 --> 01:34:23,220
I feel like I've just heard people talk about being a standard.

2102
01:34:23,220 --> 01:34:27,260
I mean, yeah, I just wasn't like no one was like grinding or no one was like

2103
01:34:27,340 --> 01:34:32,580
being sexual in what I consider that they were just like a lady in a regular

2104
01:34:32,580 --> 01:34:34,980
this is like bathing suit at the Tron.

2105
01:34:35,420 --> 01:34:36,980
Yeah. And it wasn't yet.

2106
01:34:36,980 --> 01:34:40,100
Like Michael Sheen's lounge.

2107
01:34:41,340 --> 01:34:44,100
They were just doing like their lifeguards is the pool.

2108
01:34:44,860 --> 01:34:45,820
There was. Yeah, yeah.

2109
01:34:45,820 --> 01:34:47,260
There was a regular lifeguard.

2110
01:34:47,260 --> 01:34:47,940
No, it was not.

2111
01:34:47,940 --> 01:34:50,580
Who was just holding a regular floaty.

2112
01:34:50,620 --> 01:34:53,820
Trench after dark is that in a picture, because anything goes.

2113
01:34:53,820 --> 01:34:56,500
And if somebody dies in that pool, they'll clean it up in the morning.

2114
01:34:56,500 --> 01:34:57,900
No questions asked.

2115
01:34:57,900 --> 01:35:00,900
Yeah. You are allowed to drown someone up there.

2116
01:35:01,020 --> 01:35:04,820
Yeah. So so yeah, there's like weird little stuff like that.

2117
01:35:04,820 --> 01:35:06,300
You get your you get theming.

2118
01:35:06,300 --> 01:35:09,180
You get like a logo for this this thing.

2119
01:35:09,780 --> 01:35:12,380
Little like zones to take photos.

2120
01:35:12,380 --> 01:35:15,740
We have a nice one of the two of us squeezed into a little chair.

2121
01:35:15,900 --> 01:35:19,060
Probably meant for like lovers to be on together.

2122
01:35:19,060 --> 01:35:22,100
Sure. This is this is us.

2123
01:35:22,100 --> 01:35:22,940
That's a good one.

2124
01:35:22,940 --> 01:35:25,340
A lot of good photos throughout acknowledging.

2125
01:35:25,340 --> 01:35:28,300
I think we're going to post into our socials and make sure we get the word out

2126
01:35:28,300 --> 01:35:29,740
about drenched after dark.

2127
01:35:29,740 --> 01:35:31,140
Yeah. Fine program.

2128
01:35:31,140 --> 01:35:32,020
They're running up there.

2129
01:35:32,020 --> 01:35:37,700
Oh, yeah. Did you get the photo at the photo op of Park MGM with the Maroon 5

2130
01:35:38,140 --> 01:35:40,340
logos? It was a phone booth.

2131
01:35:40,340 --> 01:35:43,180
And if you hit the dial pad.

2132
01:35:43,180 --> 01:35:44,100
Yeah, I did.

2133
01:35:44,100 --> 01:35:47,940
If you hit the dial pad, you would hear different Maroon 5 songs.

2134
01:35:49,060 --> 01:35:51,820
So you're telling me they invented a Maroon 5 machine.

2135
01:35:52,340 --> 01:35:54,660
This is the finest invention of the century.

2136
01:35:54,660 --> 01:35:55,980
There's a Maroon 5 step and repeat.

2137
01:35:55,980 --> 01:35:58,740
I'm so sick of picking up a phone and hearing my father.

2138
01:35:59,020 --> 01:36:01,660
Or important news.

2139
01:36:01,660 --> 01:36:04,940
I'm calling daddy becomes I'm calling Adam Levine.

2140
01:36:05,100 --> 01:36:06,860
To hear like this love or something.

2141
01:36:06,860 --> 01:36:11,660
Yeah. Yeah. Well, because the residency started right after we were there.

2142
01:36:11,820 --> 01:36:13,580
Do you like the song Sugar by Maroon 5?

2143
01:36:13,580 --> 01:36:15,900
Which one? Sugar Sugar.

2144
01:36:15,900 --> 01:36:18,020
To me and a planet.

2145
01:36:19,260 --> 01:36:21,140
It's like, oh, yeah, I like sugar.

2146
01:36:21,140 --> 01:36:22,140
I can't believe it.

2147
01:36:22,140 --> 01:36:25,340
That's the most like on in a Walgreens kind of song.

2148
01:36:25,340 --> 01:36:26,980
But yeah, I guess.

2149
01:36:26,980 --> 01:36:29,060
But I mean, it's like better than a lot of Maroon 5 songs.

2150
01:36:29,300 --> 01:36:30,700
I get with. Yeah.

2151
01:36:30,700 --> 01:36:33,300
Well, this is an strange scale we're using now.

2152
01:36:33,980 --> 01:36:35,820
We're being very apologetic, currently.

2153
01:36:35,820 --> 01:36:37,980
It's like, OK, but I mean, it's like an OK song.

2154
01:36:37,980 --> 01:36:41,660
I'm not so I'm not going to like stand it like I stand jaded or something.

2155
01:36:41,660 --> 01:36:43,260
But I'm just saying, OK.

2156
01:36:43,260 --> 01:36:46,460
I guess I would give it the same review I would give like to the

2157
01:36:46,700 --> 01:36:48,780
the sound of the air conditioning.

2158
01:36:48,780 --> 01:36:50,940
It is your rate. You know, it's something I don't mind.

2159
01:36:50,940 --> 01:36:52,820
The moves when I'm walking around the Walgreens.

2160
01:36:52,820 --> 01:36:55,260
I'm not a big moves like Jagger guy.

2161
01:36:55,260 --> 01:36:56,340
I would believe it or not.

2162
01:36:56,340 --> 01:36:58,820
I would write that song right between the air conditioning

2163
01:36:58,820 --> 01:37:01,300
and between the vests that I look at the employees.

2164
01:37:01,780 --> 01:37:04,060
OK, that's part of my Walgreens experience.

2165
01:37:04,060 --> 01:37:07,500
That's fair. Can I say can I say the the funny thing that you did?

2166
01:37:07,500 --> 01:37:09,300
When we were pretty we were in there.

2167
01:37:09,300 --> 01:37:10,980
Yeah, I'm not sure which one you mean, but.

2168
01:37:11,020 --> 01:37:14,260
Oh, well, so the way it's set up is there's like, again,

2169
01:37:14,260 --> 01:37:17,140
they're trying to sell you like thousand dollar cabanas to do bottle service

2170
01:37:17,140 --> 01:37:20,780
or whatever. And there's like a little extra deck with a couple of stairs.

2171
01:37:20,780 --> 01:37:24,220
And so people would go up there to their cabanas that they probably paid for.

2172
01:37:24,260 --> 01:37:25,780
But they were not really populated.

2173
01:37:25,780 --> 01:37:27,740
No, there was not. I just kind of wanted to see.

2174
01:37:27,740 --> 01:37:29,500
Could I just walk up there for a second?

2175
01:37:29,500 --> 01:37:31,260
Is it just a walking path? Right.

2176
01:37:31,260 --> 01:37:35,980
So you kind of like mischievously kind of like bolted up the stairs

2177
01:37:36,300 --> 01:37:38,500
and you were shut down so fast.

2178
01:37:38,500 --> 01:37:40,140
Are you going to be there?

2179
01:37:40,980 --> 01:37:43,180
Like it's almost like he felt this guy didn't pay.

2180
01:37:43,300 --> 01:37:44,580
I know this guy didn't pay.

2181
01:37:44,580 --> 01:37:48,140
I think you're I think you're hanging out in the graveyard

2182
01:37:48,140 --> 01:37:50,580
in the haunted mansion for longer than I.

2183
01:37:50,580 --> 01:37:54,060
Oh, I think it's it takes longer for an employee to yank you out

2184
01:37:54,060 --> 01:37:56,500
than I was yanked out of Caban land.

2185
01:37:56,620 --> 01:37:59,980
Buried yourself alive in the haunted mansion, like just by getting dirt

2186
01:37:59,980 --> 01:38:02,300
and pushing it on you by the time security came.

2187
01:38:02,300 --> 01:38:03,740
Do it quickly and in the shadows.

2188
01:38:03,740 --> 01:38:07,180
Yeah. Yeah. Spend a night as if you're you're buried alive.

2189
01:38:07,180 --> 01:38:10,900
Yes. Mansion. But these guys are watching like, oh, oh my God.

2190
01:38:10,900 --> 01:38:12,700
I could not have been faster.

2191
01:38:12,700 --> 01:38:14,100
And it wasn't the meanest.

2192
01:38:14,100 --> 01:38:17,380
But no. But these things got meaner. Sure.

2193
01:38:18,540 --> 01:38:20,820
See, I always have ready to go up.

2194
01:38:20,820 --> 01:38:23,900
Oh, I was just checking it out for next time.

2195
01:38:24,020 --> 01:38:26,580
Like, you know, that would have helped.

2196
01:38:27,340 --> 01:38:29,380
Sometimes it's a take your time.

2197
01:38:29,380 --> 01:38:32,660
You'd be amazed how often that works.

2198
01:38:32,780 --> 01:38:33,780
You know.

2199
01:38:34,340 --> 01:38:38,220
All right. Then take two more seconds and then get the fuck off of the stairs.

2200
01:38:38,380 --> 01:38:40,020
I was like, Scott, I got thrown out of here.

2201
01:38:40,020 --> 01:38:44,940
It was really funny to like ban ban from Drenched After Dark would be really good.

2202
01:38:44,940 --> 01:38:48,860
The main thing about the time that we entered and something that perked us

2203
01:38:48,860 --> 01:38:52,580
up when we got there was, wait a minute, we are arriving right at eleven thirty.

2204
01:38:52,580 --> 01:38:56,820
And from eleven thirty to twelve thirty, ladies drink free.

2205
01:38:57,140 --> 01:39:00,100
And it occurs to Aaron, I am a lady.

2206
01:39:00,260 --> 01:39:02,460
That means that all of my drinks will be free.

2207
01:39:02,460 --> 01:39:04,700
But we have already been hitting it pretty hard.

2208
01:39:04,700 --> 01:39:06,140
We've had dinner before.

2209
01:39:06,140 --> 01:39:08,300
She does not want to all you can drink.

2210
01:39:08,340 --> 01:39:10,220
And she wants to spread the wealth.

2211
01:39:10,460 --> 01:39:12,620
So she hatches a plan.

2212
01:39:12,620 --> 01:39:15,260
She kind of eyeballs how many bars are at this place.

2213
01:39:15,500 --> 01:39:16,940
I think there could be four.

2214
01:39:16,940 --> 01:39:22,060
Could I use my ladiness to get everyone a free drink?

2215
01:39:22,060 --> 01:39:25,540
Right. So she just peels off, leaving the three of us non ladies.

2216
01:39:25,540 --> 01:39:26,780
It was such a catch up.

2217
01:39:26,780 --> 01:39:30,220
Such a fun, like college era plan.

2218
01:39:30,220 --> 01:39:32,780
Like I made it. It was a really fun.

2219
01:39:32,780 --> 01:39:34,540
Yes. That's genius.

2220
01:39:34,540 --> 01:39:36,380
Yeah, it was really fun.

2221
01:39:36,380 --> 01:39:38,780
Wait to see if you like that.

2222
01:39:38,780 --> 01:39:40,580
Yeah, we really mobilized all of us.

2223
01:39:40,580 --> 01:39:43,220
That made me feel youthful in that moment, too, because I was like,

2224
01:39:43,220 --> 01:39:46,820
this is such a fun, like little scheming thing that we get to do.

2225
01:39:46,820 --> 01:39:50,540
But she seemed like she was having a fun time as a mother

2226
01:39:50,540 --> 01:39:52,020
with a generally early schedule.

2227
01:39:52,020 --> 01:39:55,340
Most times at eleven thirty, she is not awake at all.

2228
01:39:55,340 --> 01:39:59,900
Yeah. So we're hatching this crazy, this wild plan that takes us to twelve

2229
01:39:59,900 --> 01:40:02,060
thirty and gets us all drunker.

2230
01:40:02,140 --> 01:40:03,340
Yeah. Thrilled.

2231
01:40:03,380 --> 01:40:06,740
It's now it's the thrill of the hunt with my wife, who's away.

2232
01:40:06,740 --> 01:40:08,580
And we're going to have some fun.

2233
01:40:08,580 --> 01:40:09,700
So I'm thrilled.

2234
01:40:09,700 --> 01:40:12,900
So I'm just now I'm just now excited for any air and chickens that we get.

2235
01:40:12,900 --> 01:40:16,740
And, you know, I don't know if this ruins the drama,

2236
01:40:16,740 --> 01:40:19,940
but just with every check in, she is more and more successful.

2237
01:40:19,940 --> 01:40:22,100
She is so thrilled to be coming back.

2238
01:40:22,100 --> 01:40:26,940
Everything works. A massive cup of the two things they will give you for free.

2239
01:40:26,940 --> 01:40:28,980
Yes. Well, that's the way this is something.

2240
01:40:28,980 --> 01:40:29,700
Yeah. Yes.

2241
01:40:29,700 --> 01:40:32,340
I forgot that that she we put it like, what do you guys want?

2242
01:40:32,540 --> 01:40:33,900
Let's do it. What do you guys want?

2243
01:40:33,900 --> 01:40:35,060
OK, Chardonnay for you.

2244
01:40:35,060 --> 01:40:38,620
Each Manhattan on the rocks just up, if you could.

2245
01:40:38,660 --> 01:40:40,340
It was it was IPA for you.

2246
01:40:40,340 --> 01:40:41,940
Yeah, we're all like considering.

2247
01:40:41,940 --> 01:40:43,100
I guess I would.

2248
01:40:43,100 --> 01:40:45,100
What sounds good in the desert air?

2249
01:40:45,100 --> 01:40:46,060
Let's see.

2250
01:40:46,060 --> 01:40:48,300
And she walks up and like, let's see.

2251
01:40:48,300 --> 01:40:50,460
So do you have a Chardonnay?

2252
01:40:50,460 --> 01:40:52,500
Look, we got we got vodka and tequila.

2253
01:40:52,500 --> 01:40:53,340
Which one do you want?

2254
01:40:53,340 --> 01:40:55,020
I think she got a honey honey.

2255
01:40:55,020 --> 01:40:57,340
It's vodka tequila. Which one do you want?

2256
01:40:57,340 --> 01:40:59,660
Vodka. OK, I guess vodka.

2257
01:40:59,660 --> 01:41:01,180
It's well, look, as well vodka.

2258
01:41:01,180 --> 01:41:03,420
We're trying to trick a bunch of ladies to get here.

2259
01:41:03,420 --> 01:41:05,380
That's what we're doing. OK.

2260
01:41:05,380 --> 01:41:06,340
It's cheap.

2261
01:41:06,340 --> 01:41:09,380
We are taking all of our cheapest shit and shoveling it to.

2262
01:41:09,380 --> 01:41:10,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2263
01:41:10,980 --> 01:41:13,380
You want you want paint thinner or do you want?

2264
01:41:14,060 --> 01:41:16,620
Look, everything comes in a drum.

2265
01:41:16,620 --> 01:41:20,900
OK, everything is in a barrel or a drum and we ladle it out.

2266
01:41:20,900 --> 01:41:25,620
You want to the white drum or the gray drum on Listerine, Listerine or paint thinner.

2267
01:41:25,620 --> 01:41:27,900
What do you want, lady?

2268
01:41:28,900 --> 01:41:32,300
She's popping from bar to bar,

2269
01:41:32,940 --> 01:41:37,020
also enjoying soaking up the flavor and getting like seeing, well, how,

2270
01:41:37,020 --> 01:41:41,860
how Kurt will this next bartender be who has to wear a bikini

2271
01:41:41,860 --> 01:41:45,140
and deal with all of the worst people in the city? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2272
01:41:45,140 --> 01:41:46,060
All night long.

2273
01:41:46,060 --> 01:41:50,900
We aren't even close to how much worse it's going to get here in the midnight hour.

2274
01:41:51,100 --> 01:41:55,980
She'll also just get yanked into like where somebody is like trying to cut or something.

2275
01:41:55,980 --> 01:41:57,300
She just oh, yeah, yeah.

2276
01:41:57,300 --> 01:42:01,860
Or a woman really like aggressively grabbed her, pushed her to the front of the bar,

2277
01:42:01,860 --> 01:42:03,140
which is a good thing. Right.

2278
01:42:03,140 --> 01:42:05,340
With this weird like you're with us.

2279
01:42:05,460 --> 01:42:10,100
OK, you're with us as if to get ahead of the other people.

2280
01:42:10,340 --> 01:42:12,500
And I don't know what I'm being pulled in.

2281
01:42:12,500 --> 01:42:14,460
Yeah. And turn to the other people like you were here first.

2282
01:42:14,460 --> 01:42:19,380
I don't care. So, you know, so the Aaron who loves getting yanked around by

2283
01:42:19,380 --> 01:42:22,420
short shrill voiced ladies in order to change her.

2284
01:42:22,420 --> 01:42:25,100
Yeah. The worst alcohol you've ever had. Yeah.

2285
01:42:25,420 --> 01:42:26,900
She's having a blast.

2286
01:42:26,900 --> 01:42:29,900
We're exploring the space.

2287
01:42:29,900 --> 01:42:36,220
And I am happy to say with the music, probably still not at its volume zenith,

2288
01:42:37,220 --> 01:42:39,700
but we're still having to talk over it.

2289
01:42:39,700 --> 01:42:42,940
And like, so do we act any different at a loud Vegas

2290
01:42:43,380 --> 01:42:45,180
douchey pool party?

2291
01:42:45,180 --> 01:42:47,220
Well, then cut to Doug and I.

2292
01:42:47,220 --> 01:42:49,300
Yeah, I did like Gilroy Gardens.

2293
01:42:49,300 --> 01:42:51,340
Thanks for listening to the episode.

2294
01:42:51,340 --> 01:42:53,980
Well, you know, I was wondering why you didn't mention the

2295
01:42:54,140 --> 01:42:57,420
the people mover is a people mover that goes to the greenhouse.

2296
01:42:57,580 --> 01:42:59,620
Oh, I don't know. Maybe we're running it.

2297
01:42:59,620 --> 01:43:03,020
So it's just we were just doing podcasts, the right much.

2298
01:43:03,020 --> 01:43:04,780
But but screamed. Yeah.

2299
01:43:04,780 --> 01:43:07,140
But screamed over loud music.

2300
01:43:07,140 --> 01:43:09,780
I think you and I were both showing baby videos.

2301
01:43:09,980 --> 01:43:13,820
Yeah, because the baby got a Mickey doll and I was showing how adorable it was.

2302
01:43:13,820 --> 01:43:17,380
Well, I was showing, you know, my boy with Gil the girl.

2303
01:43:17,380 --> 01:43:20,100
Yeah, girl or a garlic boy. Sure.

2304
01:43:21,100 --> 01:43:22,100
So

2305
01:43:23,100 --> 01:43:28,580
so, you know, business as usual old 401K, but my mutual funds are doing better.

2306
01:43:30,860 --> 01:43:33,940
The interest rates are that's what kills you these days.

2307
01:43:35,580 --> 01:43:38,540
I so, you know, Aaron keeps popping in.

2308
01:43:38,540 --> 01:43:42,740
Eventually, the the the victory is complete.

2309
01:43:42,940 --> 01:43:46,900
She's so excited that she successfully got four rounds of horrible.

2310
01:43:46,980 --> 01:43:48,100
Oh, yeah.

2311
01:43:48,100 --> 01:43:50,580
We posted a photo of all of us making for

2312
01:43:50,660 --> 01:43:53,180
holding up four fingers.

2313
01:43:53,180 --> 01:43:54,300
She was thrilled.

2314
01:43:54,300 --> 01:43:56,500
She got to like do a little video game mission.

2315
01:43:56,500 --> 01:44:00,140
Yeah, this thing, which we really amped her up because I don't know that she wants

2316
01:44:00,140 --> 01:44:00,900
to be staying around.

2317
01:44:00,900 --> 01:44:04,660
She certainly wants to be on the move so that she does not get pushed around

2318
01:44:04,660 --> 01:44:09,820
by more girls and certainly not be talking to a lot of the men around there.

2319
01:44:09,860 --> 01:44:13,300
Sure. So she's psyched.

2320
01:44:13,340 --> 01:44:16,260
We're drinking after a night of very fine drinking.

2321
01:44:16,260 --> 01:44:18,100
We're drinking garbage. Yeah.

2322
01:44:18,100 --> 01:44:21,940
Loving it. And another college vibe of like, oh, we're drinking the worst alcohol

2323
01:44:21,940 --> 01:44:23,700
possible. But you know what?

2324
01:44:23,700 --> 01:44:25,340
It is it said it did not take.

2325
01:44:25,340 --> 01:44:28,780
It's not like I needed the full the full amount of time to warm up to this place.

2326
01:44:28,780 --> 01:44:33,180
As soon as I walked in, I was like, it's not my vibe, but I am so delighted

2327
01:44:33,180 --> 01:44:38,380
to be here. We're all getting to we're we're talking loud theme park talk.

2328
01:44:38,380 --> 01:44:39,900
Aaron's off on a mission.

2329
01:44:39,900 --> 01:44:45,140
It's so silly that we're here late for us, which equals extremely early.

2330
01:44:45,140 --> 01:44:46,900
My Vegas nightclub standard.

2331
01:44:46,900 --> 01:44:49,980
Yeah. But I it took no time to be sold on this.

2332
01:44:49,980 --> 01:44:54,180
My I was I was very quickly delighted to something because I, you know,

2333
01:44:54,180 --> 01:44:57,700
I've been questioning the loud, douchey pool party thing the whole time.

2334
01:44:57,860 --> 01:45:00,180
There's a part of me that wanted to like unravel.

2335
01:45:00,180 --> 01:45:02,860
Is this true? How can how can this be true?

2336
01:45:03,700 --> 01:45:07,620
But, you know, I don't know if I fully understand the concept of it,

2337
01:45:07,780 --> 01:45:09,900
but I certainly had a very good time.

2338
01:45:09,900 --> 01:45:12,020
Well, thank I'm glad I'm glad.

2339
01:45:12,020 --> 01:45:14,500
That's really what I wanted to say, because it is.

2340
01:45:14,940 --> 01:45:18,700
Yes, it's not necessarily my vibe normally.

2341
01:45:18,900 --> 01:45:21,580
I guess that's right. It's an escape is what it is.

2342
01:45:21,580 --> 01:45:22,940
But it's crazy nonsense.

2343
01:45:22,940 --> 01:45:24,540
There's like very loud music.

2344
01:45:24,540 --> 01:45:27,900
We didn't even talk about how like all the music felt like it's from 20 years ago

2345
01:45:27,900 --> 01:45:30,220
for some weird reason to to make us not feel too.

2346
01:45:30,420 --> 01:45:32,740
That's what I would say as we are as we are feeling like,

2347
01:45:32,740 --> 01:45:34,260
how could you even be guarding us?

2348
01:45:34,260 --> 01:45:35,740
We're obviously old folk.

2349
01:45:35,740 --> 01:45:38,220
And then every single thing they played. Yeah.

2350
01:45:38,220 --> 01:45:40,900
Was 10 years like Miss New Booty.

2351
01:45:40,900 --> 01:45:44,020
And you're like, this is not a new song. Very ancient song.

2352
01:45:44,020 --> 01:45:46,540
There was one that I didn't recognize, but it was in one of the videos

2353
01:45:46,540 --> 01:45:47,740
and I shazam did.

2354
01:45:47,740 --> 01:45:50,620
And it is the song Shake That Monkey by Too Short,

2355
01:45:50,620 --> 01:45:52,580
featuring Little John and the East Side Boys.

2356
01:45:52,580 --> 01:45:54,780
That's a 2003. Yeah. Yeah.

2357
01:45:54,780 --> 01:45:58,020
We got a gasoline in there at one. Yes. Yes.

2358
01:45:58,020 --> 01:46:00,220
We did get gasoline there, too. Yes.

2359
01:46:00,220 --> 01:46:04,700
So really, we're just at a place listening to different, very old music.

2360
01:46:04,700 --> 01:46:07,340
Very old music. Yes. For us.

2361
01:46:07,340 --> 01:46:10,300
And I was looking around and it is like I've been a lot of people

2362
01:46:10,340 --> 01:46:14,300
much closer to our age than they are to like fresh out of college kids.

2363
01:46:14,660 --> 01:46:15,500
Yes. Yeah.

2364
01:46:15,500 --> 01:46:18,100
It doesn't feel like the crowd there did not feel young.

2365
01:46:18,100 --> 01:46:20,380
Well, and Erin very quickly bonded with somebody.

2366
01:46:20,380 --> 01:46:24,460
She was like somebody struck up a conversation and she's relaying like,

2367
01:46:24,740 --> 01:46:28,100
I'm a mom. I left my I left my kid back.

2368
01:46:28,380 --> 01:46:30,380
She's off. You know, he's back in L.A.

2369
01:46:30,380 --> 01:46:33,580
And we're like, as if to say, like, I'm not supposed to be here.

2370
01:46:33,580 --> 01:46:35,780
Yeah. Guys like, are you kidding?

2371
01:46:35,780 --> 01:46:38,580
I've got tons of kids.

2372
01:46:38,580 --> 01:46:45,020
So Evan Susser, I went with us to the wrestling at Wrestling Vegas Trip,

2373
01:46:45,020 --> 01:46:48,580
and we went to a less aggressive pool party, which I've talked about.

2374
01:46:48,580 --> 01:46:51,220
And I was telling him about this trip and he goes, you know what?

2375
01:46:51,220 --> 01:46:55,700
I didn't say at the time he goes, I was skeptical of your douchey pool party, too.

2376
01:46:55,700 --> 01:46:57,140
And I didn't say anything.

2377
01:46:57,140 --> 01:46:59,340
He goes, but I loved it. We had a great time.

2378
01:46:59,380 --> 01:47:01,780
So it's interesting because he didn't he didn't he was playing it cool.

2379
01:47:02,020 --> 01:47:04,140
But he was like skeptical that that would be fun.

2380
01:47:04,180 --> 01:47:07,140
Wow. So I even think.

2381
01:47:07,380 --> 01:47:10,020
Could we play the song Vindicated by Dashboard

2382
01:47:10,020 --> 01:47:12,300
Confessional from the Spider-Man 2 soundtrack right now?

2383
01:47:12,340 --> 01:47:15,420
Well, you're the editor, so probably you're right.

2384
01:47:15,420 --> 01:47:17,580
You know, we could drop that.

2385
01:47:17,580 --> 01:47:20,540
And at a certain point, because there is a pool and the pool is kind of small.

2386
01:47:21,340 --> 01:47:22,220
But I think, Scott, I don't know.

2387
01:47:22,220 --> 01:47:24,140
I think you were like, you have to go in the pool.

2388
01:47:24,140 --> 01:47:27,780
It's yeah. Well, with mission number one achieved,

2389
01:47:27,780 --> 01:47:31,220
then a new mission had to be taken up.

2390
01:47:31,940 --> 01:47:34,980
So I know I got very like, pool, pool, pool.

2391
01:47:34,980 --> 01:47:37,940
Yeah. Not realizing you were in swim trunks.

2392
01:47:37,940 --> 01:47:39,820
Well, not really. I'm wearing the same shorts here.

2393
01:47:39,820 --> 01:47:42,260
These are not technically they're like athletic shorts.

2394
01:47:42,260 --> 01:47:44,500
OK, but they do look they're like kind of shiny.

2395
01:47:44,500 --> 01:47:46,380
Like it's not crazy.

2396
01:47:46,380 --> 01:47:48,380
It's not like jean shorts, shorts or anything.

2397
01:47:48,380 --> 01:47:49,780
I keep seeing these online.

2398
01:47:49,780 --> 01:47:53,180
Yeah, they're like swim short material, but without the netting.

2399
01:47:53,260 --> 01:47:55,060
Right. Actually do have netting, too.

2400
01:47:55,060 --> 01:47:57,180
They do. They're not supposedly swim short.

2401
01:47:57,180 --> 01:47:58,380
I don't know. They're close, though.

2402
01:47:58,380 --> 01:47:59,900
They're a cousin of swim shorts.

2403
01:47:59,900 --> 01:48:03,060
I just didn't know if it would make if you'd end up in like clothes

2404
01:48:03,060 --> 01:48:05,540
that would be weird in a pool, but you were already you were just.

2405
01:48:05,900 --> 01:48:09,140
Right. You took into account the possibility of getting drenched.

2406
01:48:09,140 --> 01:48:10,580
I actually didn't.

2407
01:48:10,580 --> 01:48:14,540
I was just wearing these and I started I bought a bunch of them a couple of weeks ago.

2408
01:48:14,540 --> 01:48:18,420
And so I was just wearing them by luck because I wasn't I would have worn a bathing suit.

2409
01:48:18,420 --> 01:48:21,420
I had a bathing suit with me. I would have worn that.

2410
01:48:21,420 --> 01:48:24,340
So but but yeah, these I was like, OK, this isn't so crazy.

2411
01:48:24,580 --> 01:48:28,100
Yeah. Like I'm the only thing would like maybe it wasn't designed for swimming

2412
01:48:28,100 --> 01:48:31,540
and like a go in there and like the color would melt into the water.

2413
01:48:31,540 --> 01:48:33,140
And I'd be embarrassed because I have green.

2414
01:48:33,140 --> 01:48:35,140
I seem like crazy, glowy effects.

2415
01:48:35,140 --> 01:48:38,340
Yeah. It's put in by the by the marquee people.

2416
01:48:39,220 --> 01:48:41,060
So, yeah, we start pushing it.

2417
01:48:41,060 --> 01:48:43,300
But you realize there's nowhere to put your stuff.

2418
01:48:43,300 --> 01:48:45,860
I don't know why we didn't just take your stuff, actually.

2419
01:48:46,100 --> 01:48:47,540
Maybe you didn't trust us.

2420
01:48:47,540 --> 01:48:49,940
I think you did eventually sort of keep an eye on it.

2421
01:48:50,820 --> 01:48:52,540
Oh, yeah. You dropped some stuff off.

2422
01:48:52,540 --> 01:48:57,180
But for sure, you like eventually got into the pool shirt off.

2423
01:48:57,180 --> 01:48:58,740
You did it. I did. Yeah.

2424
01:48:58,740 --> 01:48:59,580
Yeah. That's how you do it.

2425
01:49:00,540 --> 01:49:04,220
You start wading in, but holding all of your things above your head.

2426
01:49:04,220 --> 01:49:07,020
I was my I was holding a drink in my phone. Yeah. Yeah.

2427
01:49:07,020 --> 01:49:10,580
But because I yeah, but I wasn't like my shoes and socks were on the deck.

2428
01:49:10,580 --> 01:49:12,860
I wasn't holding my shoes over my head.

2429
01:49:12,860 --> 01:49:15,420
And no, not not all your things.

2430
01:49:15,420 --> 01:49:20,780
And I think I am dead asleep by this point with ancient aliens playing on the TV.

2431
01:49:21,020 --> 01:49:22,900
I'm full of macaroni and cheese.

2432
01:49:22,900 --> 01:49:26,500
Zach Baggins did come on the TV, did come on

2433
01:49:26,740 --> 01:49:29,300
history channel or whatever travel channel.

2434
01:49:29,860 --> 01:49:32,940
Mr. Haunted Museum, a guy.

2435
01:49:32,940 --> 01:49:37,020
I have a great video where I'm I'm filming you.

2436
01:49:37,660 --> 01:49:40,020
Both Doug and I are filming you because we're so excited.

2437
01:49:40,020 --> 01:49:41,940
Yeah, you're doing it.

2438
01:49:41,940 --> 01:49:43,740
You are getting drenched after dark.

2439
01:49:43,740 --> 01:49:47,620
And then so like I'm getting a shot of you wading in.

2440
01:49:47,620 --> 01:49:51,020
And then a guy taps me on the shoulder and says,

2441
01:49:51,700 --> 01:49:53,580
hey, you need to be filming over that way.

2442
01:49:53,580 --> 01:49:55,740
And I turn and like, huh, what?

2443
01:49:55,740 --> 01:49:58,260
And he's like, right there, that's what you need to be looking at.

2444
01:49:58,260 --> 01:50:03,060
And he points to somebody's big old booty.

2445
01:50:03,980 --> 01:50:05,820
And he was working.

2446
01:50:05,820 --> 01:50:07,340
Was he working there?

2447
01:50:07,340 --> 01:50:08,900
I'm not sure that I don't know.

2448
01:50:08,900 --> 01:50:10,620
I thought an employee was here.

2449
01:50:10,620 --> 01:50:11,700
That's funny, because I didn't know this.

2450
01:50:11,700 --> 01:50:15,220
I saw this go on and I thought an employee was just like being like,

2451
01:50:15,220 --> 01:50:17,700
hey, sir, you can't videotape people.

2452
01:50:17,860 --> 01:50:20,100
Oh, oh, oh. Or you can't take a video of them.

2453
01:50:20,100 --> 01:50:22,020
That's what I thought was happening. Started talking.

2454
01:50:22,020 --> 01:50:23,700
Yes. Yeah. Yeah. No, no, no.

2455
01:50:23,700 --> 01:50:26,820
That was somebody saying, hey, that's where you want to be pointing.

2456
01:50:26,860 --> 01:50:29,180
I think he worked because he was like kind of standing right by

2457
01:50:29,180 --> 01:50:32,140
where you would walk down into the stairs into the pool.

2458
01:50:32,820 --> 01:50:36,100
That's funny. Well, because if you're posting this on the socials,

2459
01:50:36,100 --> 01:50:38,860
I know one thing it's going to get people in here and another.

2460
01:50:39,060 --> 01:50:40,180
No offense, Mike. OK.

2461
01:50:40,180 --> 01:50:43,420
But I said, no, no, no, I'm filming my friend's ass right here.

2462
01:50:43,700 --> 01:50:47,020
And I started zooming in and you were having a laugh with him.

2463
01:50:47,260 --> 01:50:48,540
Yeah. Oh, no, it was a nice moment.

2464
01:50:48,540 --> 01:50:50,580
I thought this was this is very friendly. Yeah.

2465
01:50:50,580 --> 01:50:53,900
And you, I think, said like, you know, he's he's exploiting me.

2466
01:50:54,220 --> 01:50:57,580
He's he's trying to give you approval if he thought I was

2467
01:50:57,580 --> 01:50:59,460
you were doing something weird with me. Oh, yeah.

2468
01:50:59,460 --> 01:51:03,020
Mike's standing in the shallow and water up to his waist.

2469
01:51:04,580 --> 01:51:06,780
When you're tall, everything's the shallow sexiest image.

2470
01:51:06,780 --> 01:51:07,980
I'm filming my friend.

2471
01:51:07,980 --> 01:51:10,980
He's trying not to get his whole steady T-shirt wet.

2472
01:51:13,380 --> 01:51:14,980
Where is it into the pool?

2473
01:51:15,620 --> 01:51:18,260
He's got a little Keno from Turtles 2.

2474
01:51:18,260 --> 01:51:21,860
He's he's pretending he's swimming with a little Keno.

2475
01:51:21,980 --> 01:51:24,140
Oh, I broke even on keynote the next night.

2476
01:51:24,260 --> 01:51:27,500
Then I just sit at a bar and play forever. That's great.

2477
01:51:27,700 --> 01:51:29,500
You know, very like low stakes.

2478
01:51:29,500 --> 01:51:32,140
It's like bingo, essentially. Yeah. Yeah.

2479
01:51:32,140 --> 01:51:33,340
I thought it was funny with Gabris.

2480
01:51:33,340 --> 01:51:35,700
You're like, oh, you know what I want to know about now, Keno.

2481
01:51:35,700 --> 01:51:39,140
And I'm like the grandma game. Yeah, I don't know.

2482
01:51:39,140 --> 01:51:41,980
I knew there were all right, Gabris, bro to bro.

2483
01:51:41,980 --> 01:51:43,940
Tell me about that fucking Keno shit.

2484
01:51:43,940 --> 01:51:47,660
I lesser gave me good tips on Twitter, the different types of key.

2485
01:51:47,660 --> 01:51:51,940
There's like, is it like caveman Keno and like

2486
01:51:52,860 --> 01:51:56,180
there's different versions on most of those touchscreen machines,

2487
01:51:56,180 --> 01:51:59,460
which are very hard to touch.

2488
01:51:59,460 --> 01:52:01,980
Like they only kind of work.

2489
01:52:01,980 --> 01:52:03,940
My friends, right, right.

2490
01:52:03,940 --> 01:52:06,580
Stick to the buttons. The buttons work better.

2491
01:52:07,220 --> 01:52:10,540
How do you feel? Were you on top of the world being made it?

2492
01:52:10,540 --> 01:52:13,660
You're getting drenched. Your friends are on board.

2493
01:52:13,660 --> 01:52:15,660
I see. Yeah, yeah. I was happy with all that.

2494
01:52:15,660 --> 01:52:18,740
And then I went into the water and the only and I think I said this

2495
01:52:18,740 --> 01:52:23,220
when I got out, I was like in the water, I'm having like ten times more fun too.

2496
01:52:23,220 --> 01:52:24,140
And I was just alone.

2497
01:52:24,140 --> 01:52:25,780
And like at that point, I still I'm alone.

2498
01:52:25,780 --> 01:52:28,900
So I'm not going to like be there for like hours or whatever.

2499
01:52:28,900 --> 01:52:30,860
But I was like, it would be better if everybody was in the pool.

2500
01:52:30,860 --> 01:52:35,020
We could actually sit, stand and it would be more less weird.

2501
01:52:35,020 --> 01:52:39,100
So so no, in the pool was actually just as good as I thought at night,

2502
01:52:39,340 --> 01:52:43,420
drenched after dark on the top of some deck at a Vegas pool party.

2503
01:52:43,420 --> 01:52:45,980
Because Vegas pools don't stay open very late.

2504
01:52:45,980 --> 01:52:50,140
That's exactly why this is a novelty that I wanted to enjoy.

2505
01:52:50,140 --> 01:52:52,580
Close it off only for the elites. Right.

2506
01:52:52,580 --> 01:52:56,580
This night, we were among the elites for a little bit,

2507
01:52:56,580 --> 01:53:02,660
because then things started to turn a tad because it's getting a little more crowded

2508
01:53:02,660 --> 01:53:05,620
because like the hour of people they actually want. Right.

2509
01:53:05,620 --> 01:53:09,460
Or like people are starting to file in the cabanas, they're starting to fill up.

2510
01:53:09,780 --> 01:53:13,060
The hour has passed and Aaron successfully got us.

2511
01:53:13,340 --> 01:53:16,140
All of our drinks. But Doug is not quite through drinking.

2512
01:53:16,140 --> 01:53:20,420
So he goes to get a drink like normal and he returns and says,

2513
01:53:21,140 --> 01:53:26,740
Aaron, that was forty dollars for true crap for a cup of crap.

2514
01:53:26,740 --> 01:53:28,740
It was not a good cocktail.

2515
01:53:28,740 --> 01:53:33,820
So we realize and I think she may have ended up getting a fifth, actually.

2516
01:53:33,820 --> 01:53:35,340
Yeah, I think she did.

2517
01:53:35,340 --> 01:53:38,220
So I'm sorry, Aaron, I'm sorry I didn't give you that that full credit.

2518
01:53:38,220 --> 01:53:40,900
So five drinks in that hour.

2519
01:53:40,940 --> 01:53:42,740
First of all, what a speed demon.

2520
01:53:42,740 --> 01:53:46,220
And secondly, total savings, two hundred dollars.

2521
01:53:46,220 --> 01:53:48,580
Yeah, I know. So way to go.

2522
01:53:48,580 --> 01:53:49,940
We're scoring. Aren't we?

2523
01:53:49,940 --> 01:53:52,380
I think we're all up when you think of it that way.

2524
01:53:52,380 --> 01:53:54,060
I agree. Except for Doug.

2525
01:53:54,060 --> 01:53:56,740
Yeah, he's down bad. Crashing down forty dollars.

2526
01:53:56,740 --> 01:53:58,500
He's down bad. Yeah.

2527
01:53:58,500 --> 01:54:01,380
So little did we know how much Aaron saved us.

2528
01:54:01,380 --> 01:54:03,820
But then, you know, then we're talking about this and we're talking about,

2529
01:54:03,820 --> 01:54:06,060
wow, you really made it and you're putting your stuff back on.

2530
01:54:06,380 --> 01:54:08,820
And I know what I felt like.

2531
01:54:08,980 --> 01:54:13,580
We actually like found a good little like near the pool couch zone.

2532
01:54:14,260 --> 01:54:18,580
And we're talking and like, you know, and just all of us to be to actually be out

2533
01:54:18,580 --> 01:54:22,860
and having a good time, like, you know, the happy surprise of Doug being there.

2534
01:54:22,860 --> 01:54:24,220
The mood's so good.

2535
01:54:24,220 --> 01:54:26,820
And I feel like it was it was a conversation that was kind of like,

2536
01:54:27,140 --> 01:54:31,580
yeah, it's just nice to like change it up and get a little out, out, out, out, out.

2537
01:54:31,660 --> 01:54:37,260
And a meet and at that, that is a guy with a flashlight who just dives in

2538
01:54:37,260 --> 01:54:41,100
oh, like a jump scare in a maze.

2539
01:54:41,340 --> 01:54:45,700
Just all of a sudden out, out, out, out, shining flashlight, waving it around.

2540
01:54:45,700 --> 01:54:46,860
Yes, sir. Yes, yes.

2541
01:54:46,860 --> 01:54:48,460
And we are out as quickly as you could.

2542
01:54:48,460 --> 01:54:51,780
Like it took two seconds to be off of that couch. Yeah.

2543
01:54:51,780 --> 01:54:54,420
So if you go to this thing,

2544
01:54:55,740 --> 01:54:58,860
you know, be prepared to have a good time, but also be aware

2545
01:54:59,060 --> 01:55:03,380
that there are lurking flashlight monsters waiting to jump out

2546
01:55:03,380 --> 01:55:06,980
and push all mediocre looking men.

2547
01:55:07,580 --> 01:55:10,740
Back somewhere else, somewhere where they can't sit.

2548
01:55:10,860 --> 01:55:15,220
Horror nights are not scary farms, scare zone rules of like

2549
01:55:15,660 --> 01:55:18,780
you're safe in the restaurant usually safe in the pool.

2550
01:55:18,820 --> 01:55:21,740
Apparently, well, I can't speak for like three a.m.

2551
01:55:21,740 --> 01:55:22,740
I don't know what happened.

2552
01:55:22,740 --> 01:55:25,940
I don't like and again, I don't look I said mediocre there.

2553
01:55:25,940 --> 01:55:29,460
I don't mean to clearly, Mike, you are 1230 a.m.

2554
01:55:29,460 --> 01:55:31,420
Marquis Club hot.

2555
01:55:31,420 --> 01:55:32,980
I are you three a.m.

2556
01:55:32,980 --> 01:55:34,660
I don't know. I can't speak to that.

2557
01:55:34,660 --> 01:55:36,700
I haven't been there at three a.m.

2558
01:55:36,700 --> 01:55:41,380
Hot and the currency of hot at these places is oftentimes jacked.

2559
01:55:42,340 --> 01:55:44,780
So I will. I'm not jacked.

2560
01:55:44,940 --> 01:55:49,100
I told Gabris about this experience since he was encouraging us

2561
01:55:49,100 --> 01:55:50,300
to do some different stuff. Right.

2562
01:55:50,300 --> 01:55:51,980
Right. It's kind of the through line of that episode.

2563
01:55:51,980 --> 01:55:55,140
And I said, hey, we really like ski lodge and we really liked at the Cosmo

2564
01:55:55,340 --> 01:56:00,460
this nightclub until the mediocre man hunting flashlight people came.

2565
01:56:00,460 --> 01:56:03,940
And he said, well, I can't wait to be kicked out soon myself.

2566
01:56:04,780 --> 01:56:07,180
So, yeah.

2567
01:56:07,460 --> 01:56:11,220
And who know anybody out there unless you're very confident you're three a.m.

2568
01:56:11,340 --> 01:56:14,900
or you want to spend a grand on a kind of seat.

2569
01:56:15,020 --> 01:56:16,300
Yeah. Well, and that's the thing.

2570
01:56:16,300 --> 01:56:18,660
Then I was looking up, like, what are other people's experiences

2571
01:56:18,660 --> 01:56:20,060
like at this particular thing?

2572
01:56:20,060 --> 01:56:24,740
And I looked it up on Yelp and found somebody's receipt of like a regular night

2573
01:56:24,740 --> 01:56:29,180
where they did a bottle service of Tito's and then all the other things.

2574
01:56:29,180 --> 01:56:31,620
And I found a receipt before.

2575
01:56:31,740 --> 01:56:33,460
Oh, no, there is some gratuity in there.

2576
01:56:33,460 --> 01:56:34,460
You could go over.

2577
01:56:34,460 --> 01:56:37,740
But just the basic is three thousand dollars.

2578
01:56:38,340 --> 01:56:39,660
So yeah.

2579
01:56:39,660 --> 01:56:41,900
And we did not pay anywhere.

2580
01:56:41,900 --> 01:56:45,260
I actually I mean, all we paid was forty dollars.

2581
01:56:45,260 --> 01:56:47,260
And by we, I mean, Doug, Doug.

2582
01:56:47,260 --> 01:56:50,260
So only him, really. Yeah.

2583
01:56:51,060 --> 01:56:52,580
So there you go.

2584
01:56:52,580 --> 01:56:55,420
I think that's everything. But drenched after dark.

2585
01:56:56,900 --> 01:56:59,220
Listeners, if you're looking to go Labor Day weekend,

2586
01:56:59,380 --> 01:57:01,980
DJ Sour Milk is rolling in. Wow. Really?

2587
01:57:02,060 --> 01:57:04,060
You're going to want to check that out.

2588
01:57:04,620 --> 01:57:09,980
And yeah. Hey, you know, I didn't understand it, but then I understood it.

2589
01:57:09,980 --> 01:57:12,540
Would it alone? I don't think so.

2590
01:57:12,780 --> 01:57:14,540
Alone, I don't think that works. Yeah.

2591
01:57:14,540 --> 01:57:17,340
Well, we saw I went alone and I'm a fan of it.

2592
01:57:17,340 --> 01:57:19,660
And it didn't work. You know, it didn't quite work.

2593
01:57:19,660 --> 01:57:23,020
But but but with you and Doug,

2594
01:57:23,980 --> 01:57:26,980
who I love and and Aaron, who you know what?

2595
01:57:27,220 --> 01:57:30,380
You know what it really reminded me of is that being like out of the parents

2596
01:57:30,380 --> 01:57:33,980
routine in the biggest way for the really really drenched after dark

2597
01:57:33,980 --> 01:57:37,180
was the most out of the routine that we've been the whole time.

2598
01:57:38,060 --> 01:57:43,420
And it reminded me of how Aaron and I really bonded even before we were dating.

2599
01:57:43,420 --> 01:57:46,460
The first that the spark was ever there was

2600
01:57:48,180 --> 01:57:51,740
both of us connecting and snarking on the outskirts of parties

2601
01:57:51,740 --> 01:57:53,700
where we felt uncomfortable.

2602
01:57:53,700 --> 01:57:56,740
And it just it brought me right back to that. Yeah.

2603
01:57:56,900 --> 01:58:00,580
And Aaron, it was nice to be back where it all started.

2604
01:58:00,620 --> 01:58:03,620
And yeah, I love you. It was great to try to do it with you.

2605
01:58:03,700 --> 01:58:05,900
Well, I'm glad I could provide that.

2606
01:58:06,660 --> 01:58:08,860
I didn't do that. And I was just really loud music.

2607
01:58:08,860 --> 01:58:10,300
I like being about it.

2608
01:58:10,300 --> 01:58:13,340
It feels so and actually, you know, because I met Aaron in high school,

2609
01:58:13,340 --> 01:58:14,180
we were not dating then.

2610
01:58:14,180 --> 01:58:16,420
And what would we have been drinking in high school?

2611
01:58:16,420 --> 01:58:19,460
But shitty, shitty vodka, of course, so it really did.

2612
01:58:19,580 --> 01:58:23,420
Took us took us back to the roots and all of the exact same music was playing.

2613
01:58:23,580 --> 01:58:25,900
It's a look.

2614
01:58:25,900 --> 01:58:27,580
It's a magical place.

2615
01:58:27,580 --> 01:58:29,420
The douchey pool party.

2616
01:58:29,420 --> 01:58:31,220
It really is. I guess so.

2617
01:58:31,220 --> 01:58:34,820
Now, that all being said, am I going to go to another one ever again?

2618
01:58:34,820 --> 01:58:37,620
No, but very well did.

2619
01:58:37,820 --> 01:58:39,900
It did like it to give it a try.

2620
01:58:39,900 --> 01:58:41,340
We'll see, though.

2621
01:58:41,340 --> 01:58:43,220
Who knows what new things on the list?

2622
01:58:43,220 --> 01:58:45,980
Blender, too. Who knows what new pool parties?

2623
01:58:46,580 --> 01:58:49,780
Maybe they'll be like an like a dusk pool party.

2624
01:58:49,820 --> 01:58:51,460
That's specifically a dusk.

2625
01:58:51,460 --> 01:58:53,140
Maybe we host one by that point.

2626
01:58:53,140 --> 01:58:56,100
Well, I was like, how do these DJs get here?

2627
01:58:56,500 --> 01:59:00,340
Can we run like a scam and like become a DJ and then just like

2628
01:59:00,820 --> 01:59:03,500
get a trip to Vegas? I'm just like, who are these people?

2629
01:59:03,540 --> 01:59:06,740
And we just we can't be we can't even be like Jokey or little theme

2630
01:59:06,740 --> 01:59:08,140
park references or anything.

2631
01:59:08,140 --> 01:59:10,260
No, no, straight ahead. I'm DJ Tork.

2632
01:59:10,580 --> 01:59:12,180
You just need a word.

2633
01:59:12,180 --> 01:59:14,900
Yeah. And then you just play like in the club by 50 Cent.

2634
01:59:15,460 --> 01:59:18,220
It's 20 year old hits.

2635
01:59:20,820 --> 01:59:22,780
Yeah, I'm a DJ. Yeah, I play in the club.

2636
01:59:22,780 --> 01:59:25,100
And Jason is DJ Beeple.

2637
01:59:25,140 --> 01:59:29,740
Yeah, I was going to say I play timber and then there's a drop of just us

2638
01:59:29,740 --> 01:59:31,860
arguing with the restaurant is called.

2639
01:59:33,180 --> 01:59:36,180
You're an all pitbull DJ. Yeah. Yeah.

2640
01:59:38,100 --> 01:59:39,860
That's your gimmick. Well, does that do it?

2641
01:59:39,860 --> 01:59:41,140
I think it does. All right.

2642
01:59:41,140 --> 01:59:43,100
I think they really collected it all here.

2643
01:59:43,100 --> 01:59:44,620
We got drenched.

2644
01:59:44,620 --> 01:59:45,860
You got sure did.

2645
01:59:45,860 --> 01:59:49,020
You survived. You got drenched on podcast the ride.

2646
01:59:49,140 --> 01:59:50,900
Sin City Nights, the Fremont Gate.

2647
01:59:50,900 --> 01:59:53,100
Thanks for subscribing.

2648
01:59:53,100 --> 01:59:58,020
I think this is the final Fremont Gate as Sin City Nights winds down.

2649
01:59:58,900 --> 02:00:01,900
But other stuff coming as always, if you want to dig even deeper,

Yeah. You know, really, if anything, I'm just sad that it's no longer.

2653
02:00:16,220 --> 02:00:19,540
We can't have like the ultimate the true fun there because that place

2654

is no longer owned by James Dolan.

2655
02:00:22,580 --> 02:00:23,940
Sad. Yeah. Yeah.
